<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantage of a clear, comprehensive, and regu∣lar view of the <HI>FIGURES,</HI> the <HI>TYPES,</HI> and the <HI>PRE∣DICTIONS</HI> of scripture, is obvious. In the <HI>FIRST,</HI> we ob∣serve the surprising eloquence of Heaven, and discern al∣most every form in nature, a guide to, and an illustrator of inspired truth. By the <HI>SECOND,</HI> we perceive the whole substance of the gospel of Christ, truly exhibited in ancient shadows, persons, and things;—in laws apparently carnal and trifling. In the <HI>THIRD,</HI> we observe how astonishing∣ly inspired predictions properly arranged, and compared with the history of nations and churches, do illustrate each other; and modern events, as with the evidence of mi∣racles, confirm our faith in the oracles of God. The usefulness of what I have attempted, with respect to all the <HI>THREE,</HI> must be lest to the providence of God.</P>
<P>The subsequent <HI>MEDITATIONS,</HI> relate to the <HI>FIGURES</HI> of sacred writ. To avoid too peremptory parallels, and to awaken devotion, they are cast into the present form. The <HI>EMBLEMS,</HI> the signification of which appeared uncertain or DIVersified, are repeated under different heads. To shun interfering with <HI>TYPES,</HI> many rich <HI>EMBLEMS,</HI> as of <HI>ZION, PRIESTS, &amp;c.</HI> are wholly omitted, or but slightly touched. To shun a tiresome length, and a sinking dul∣ness, that which was just before hinted on a similar <HI>EM∣BLEM,</HI> is not seldom passed over; and the history of <HI>EM∣BLEMS</HI> is lest to be collected from the account of the <HI>OB∣JECTS</HI> which they represent; nor on <HI>THIS</HI> are ought but hints offered, and the enlargement is left to the reader's own meditation. What friendly indulgence is requisite to pardon mistakes, the peruser must judge. Meanwhile, it is hoped he will remember, that the espial of faults is much easier work than to avoid them.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK I. <HI>SCRIPTURE-language in general.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the manner of the East, the language of inspira∣tion abounds with the most striking and instructive figures. In noble and candid simplicity,—in bold allusion, not all the writings of men can vie with these oracles of God. Here,—as one would expect in the idiom of Godhead, the principal truths are brought down to the weakest capacity, that ignorance may have nothing to plead for excuse; others, chiefly predic∣tions, are often wrapped up in figures, obscure, and hard to be understood. Thus, till the fulfilment, the learned are forced to acknowledge their ignorance, and malicious opposers rendered incapable to stop the pre∣dicted event.</P>
<P>The figures of sacred language are either SIMPLE or COMPLEX. The former, without changing the native sense of the words, embellish the stile, enliven the re∣presentation, or illustrate the subject: the latter, while they ennoble the stile, and illustrate the subject, do also convert the terms, from their ordinary signification, to another connected with it.</P>
<P>Simple figures are, 1. A REPETITION of the same term or phrase; whether in the same, or in different sen∣tences
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
of a chapter, or section; as of MY, Psal. xviii. 1. 2. 3.; <HI>my</HI> God, Psal. xxii. 1. and cxviii. 28.; <HI>my help,</HI> Psal. cxxi. 1. 2.;<HI>—whatsoever things are,</HI> Phil iv. 8.; <HI>his mercy endureth for ever,</HI> Psal. cxxxvi.; <HI>Lord our Lord,</HI> &amp;c. Psal. viii. 1. 9. 2. DIVERSIFYING of the sense, while the sound is nearly retained. Thus, <HI>Walk in the flesh;</HI> and <HI>war after the flesh;</HI> agree pretty much in found, but differ vastly in sense. 3. CHANGING of the sense of a word in the same sentence. Thus <HI>good,</HI> in Matth. xix. 16. signifies, first, what is <HI>good</HI> and useful, in a limited sense; and then, what is infinitely and originally <HI>good: fruit of the vine,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 29. both signifies natural wine, and eternal happiness. 4. CONFORMATION of the sound of the terms, to the mournful, the joyful, the terrible, deterstable, or ami∣able nature of the subject. Thus the portion of the wicked is described in words sounding forth terror, Psal. xi. 5. 6.; the last day, in most dreadful language, 2 Pet. iii. 10. 12. 5. OUTCRIES of admiration, ab∣horrence, derision, commendation, wishing, pity, joy, grief; as, <HI>How great is his goodness!</HI> Zech. ix. 17. <HI>O wretched man that I am!</HI> &amp;c. Rom. vii. 24, <HI>O woman great is thy saith!</HI> Matth. xv. 28. 6. CORRECTIONS of what was just before asserted; as, <HI>Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</HI> Gal. ii. 20. <HI>Yet not I, but the grace of God,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 10. 7. In promises, the re∣ward; and especially that which is terrible in a threat∣ening, complaint, or oath, is sometimes partly SUP∣PRESSED: as, <HI>He shall be chief ana captain,</HI> 2 Sam. v. 8. <HI>I will drive him out,</HI> Gen. iii. 22. <HI>Wilt thou cast me off?</HI> Psal. vi. 3. <HI>Let me cease to exist,</HI> if I lie, Psal. lxxxix. 35. 8. Interrupting ADDRESSES: as, of Ne∣hemiah to God, chap. iv. 4. 5.; of God, by Joel, to the Hebrews, chap. ii. 12. 13.; of David to the moun∣tains of Gilboa; to the daughters of Israel; to Jona∣than, 2 Sam. i. 21. 24. 25. 26. 9. INTRODUCTION of speeches, real or feigned: as, of the chosen ruler of Judah, Is. iii. 7.; of their women, Is. iv. 1.; of the fir-trees, and of the dead, Is. xiv. 8. 9.; of hell and destruction, Job xxviii. 22. When these speeches are wicked, they are sometimes expressed, not as uttered by the author, but as they truly meant. Thus, sinful
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
means of relief are called <HI>a covenant with hell, and a∣greement with death,</HI> Is. xxviii. 15.: flattering prophe∣cies are called <HI>deceits,</HI> Is. xxx. 10.: false witnesses are called <HI>sons of Belial,</HI> 1 Kings xxi. 10. 10. QUESTIONS, expressive of absurdity, wonder, doubt, demonstra∣tion, expostulation, anger, insult, grief, negation, pity, desire, refusal, prohibition: as, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old?</HI> John iii. 4. <HI>How excellent is thy loving kindness!</HI> Psal. xxxvi. 7. <HI>Shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</HI> Gen. xvii. 17. <HI>Is anything too hard for the Lord?</HI> Gen. xviii. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 11. APPEALS to those who are argued against: as, of the apostles to the Jewish rulers, Acts iv. 19.; of Paul to the Galatians, chap. iii. 2. 12. RETORTION, or throwing back an accusation or objection, on the starter of it. So God throws back the charge of <HI>injustice</HI> on the Jews, who charged him with it, Ezek. xviii.: the Syrophenician woman pleads the character of a <HI>dog,</HI> thrown out a∣gainst her,—as an argument for mercy, Matth. xv. 26. 27. To repel the question, By what authority he act∣ed? Jesus posed the inquirers, <HI>Whether the baptism of John was from heaven, or of men?</HI> Matth. xxi. 23.—25. 13. PREVENTION of objections, by answering them be∣fore they be started: Thus the objection, of God's de∣serting his church, is prevented, Is. xlix. 14. 15. 14. An apparent YIELDING of that which an opposer pleads, in order to shew its absurdity; or its insufficiency to establish the point in dispute. So Paul grants the Jews to have great knowledge of the law, and a capacity to instruct others;—in order to shew them, how their sin in breaking the law was aggravated, Rom. ii. 17.—24. James grants the ungodly professor, that he <HI>had faith;</HI> but shews that the devils also <HI>believed and trembled,</HI> Jam. ii. 19. 15. ASSIGNATION of the reason of an action, or name. Thus, Paul was not ashamed of the gospel, because it was <HI>the power of God for salvation to believers;</HI> and it was so, because <HI>therein the righteousness of God was revealed,</HI> Rom. i. 16. 17. The law silenceth and condemns all men, because <HI>by it is the knowledge of sin;</HI> and therefore, <HI>by the deeds of it shall no flesh be justified;</HI> Rom. iii. 19. 20. No man can be saved by the law; <HI>because it worketh wrath</HI> in our corrupt nature against
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
God, and condemns us to his just wrath, Rom. iv. 14. 15. 16. Lively DESCRIPTIONS; which, as it were, pre∣sent the objects to our eyes, and other senses: as, of Tophet, Is. xxx. 33.; of Goliah, 1 Sam. xvii. 4.—6.; of God's compassion, Jer. xxxi. 20. Hos. xi. 7. 8. 17. DI∣GRESSIONS; in which the speaker, for a time, turns aside from his immediate subjects, and descants upon an object occasionally mentioned. Thus the apostles often turn aside to discourse concerning Jesus Christ: as Rev. i. 5.—8. Col. i. 14.—22. 18. TRANSITIONS; in which one part of the sentence respects that which went before, and another what follows. Thus, <HI>Covet ear∣nestly the best gifts,</HI> respects what precedes; and, <HI>I shew you a more excellent way,</HI> that which follows, 1 Cor. xii. 31. 19. CONTRASTS; in which subjects dis∣similar are compared, in order to mark clearly the na∣ture, value, or unworthiness of the one: so the condi∣tion of the wicked is contrasted with that of the righ∣teous, Psal. i. God's kindness, and mens unfruitful∣ness and wickedness, are contrasted, Is. v. 1.—4. Men and the Holy Ghost are contrasted, Acts v. 4. 20. COM∣PARISON of things, like or unlike, in order to argue from the one to the other. Thus Christ argues from the lesser to the greater, Matth. vi. 30. and vii. 11.; and that God is to feared rather than men, Matth. x. 28. 21. INDUCTION; by which compound things are represented in their various parts. And here there is, generally, an ascending, as to the object, or the lan∣guage. Thus the desolation of a country is described from the case of the fields, the inhabitants, people, priest, servant, master, seller, buyer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is. xxiv. 1. 2. 3. God's just judgment is represented in his reward∣ing the righteous, and punishing the wicked, Rom. ii. 6.—9. The resurrection is described, as partly to hap∣piness, and partly to damnation, John v. 28. 29. Christ's state is described, from the debased and exalted circumstances of it, Phil. i. 6.—10. Thus the sin or the judgment of men is often described, in a variety of particulars, Ezek. xxii. and xxiii. 22. CROWDING of various qualities or things into one sentence: as, of sa∣crifices, rams, bullocks, lambs, he-goats, vain oblations, new moons, sabbaths, assemblies, Is. i. 11. 13. 14.; of

foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justificati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, glorification, Rom. viii. 29. 30. 23. REDOUBL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>D REPRESENTATIONS; in which objects are represent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, first more obscurely, and then more plainly; as, <HI>Har the right; attend to my cry: give car to my prayer,</HI> Psal. xvii. 1.; <HI>Water,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> John iii. 5. <HI>Thy silver is become dross; thy wine is mixt with water;</HI> thy <HI>prin∣ces are rebellious, and companions, of thieves,</HI> Is. i. 22. 23. 24. CIRCUMLOCUTIONS; in which, for modesty, or to sweeten or heighten the language, the proper name of an object is avoided, and an indirect descrip∣tion is given in its stead. So a chamber-pot is called a <HI>vessel wherein there is no pleasure,</HI> Jer. xxii. 2. 8. Urine is called the <HI>waters of the feet,</HI> 2 Kings xviii. 27. Heb. Death is called <HI>the king of terrors,</HI> Job xviii. 14. 25. RE∣FERENCES; in which the words, or sense of another speaker, or writer, are quoted, or alluded to. Here the words are sometimes quoted, in a sense which they did not originally seem to bear; and sometimes the terms or the sense of DIVers passages are conjunctly quo∣ted into one.—Quotations or allusions abound in the New Testament, Matth. i. 23. and xxi. 4. 5. Acts vii. 43. <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.:</HI> concerning which, many excellent obser∣vations may be found in Carpzow's <HI>Defence of the Bible.</HI></P>
<P>Complex figures are, metonymy; synecdoche; meio∣sis; hyperbole; irony; metaphor.</P>
<P>By METONYMY, the name of <HI>one object</HI> is given to <HI>another,</HI> because of some <HI>connection,</HI> not <HI>similitude,</HI> be∣twixt them. Thus, 1. The name of the matter, the author, the cause, or instrument, is given to that which is produced from, or by it; or the name of the effect is given to the author, cause, or instrument. Thus the wood in the houses and furniture of Jerusalem is called a <HI>forest,</HI> Jer. xxi. 14. Ezek. xx. 46.; the tem∣ple, for its plenty of cedar-wood that grew in Leba∣non, is called <HI>Lebanon,</HI> Zech. xi. 1.; a heavenly frame is called <HI>the Spirit,</HI> Rev. i. 10.; the name of a father, as of Jacob, Moab, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is given to his posterity, Is. xliii. 22. and xvi.; a testimony is called the <HI>mouth,</HI> Deut. xvii. 6.; speech is called the <HI>tongue,</HI> Prov. xxv. 15.; the benefits God bestows are called his <HI>love,</HI> 1 John
<PB REF="10"/>
iii. 1. Contrariwise, Christ is called <HI>salvation,</HI> because he is the author of it, Gen. xlix. 18.; Esau's, taking Canaanitish wives is called a <HI>grief, i. e.</HI> a cause of grief, Gen. xxvi. 35.; the gospel is called <HI>the power of God, i. e.</HI> the instrument of exerting it, Rom. i. 16.; victory over the world is called <HI>faith,</HI> as faith obtains it, 1 John v. 4.; the transgression of Israel is called <HI>Samaria;</HI> and the high-places of Judah, <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> because these cities chiefly promoted wickedness and idolatry, Mic. i. 5; wisdom and knowledge are called <HI>stability,</HI> be∣cause they are the means of it, Is. xxxiii. 6. 2. The name of a subject is given to its adjunct; and of an ad∣junct to its subject. Thus a city, a country, the earth, the world, is put for the inhabitants of it, Jer. iv. 29. Gen. vi. 11.; a cup, for that which is contained in it, 1 Cor. xi. 25. <HI>This cup,</HI> &amp;c. Psal. xxxiii. 4.; a nest for the pullets in it, Deut xxii. 11.; the heart, for the desires, or other things, contained in it, Psal. lxii. 8.; <HI>Pour out your hearts.</HI> The name of a possessor, is given to what is possessed; so Christ's people are called himself, Matth. xxv. 35.—45. Acts ix. 4. 1 Cor. xii. 12.; so <HI>the Lord, i. e.</HI> what offerings belonged to him, is call∣ed Levi's inheritance, Deut. x. 9. The name of the thing signified is given to the sign; so the wine in the Lord's supper is called <HI>Christ's blood,</HI> or the <HI>New Testament in it,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 26.; and of the sign to the thing sig∣nified; the sovereign rule is called a <HI>sceptre,</HI> Gen. xlix. 10. The name of the quality is given to its subject; so a scarlet and crimson coloured thing is called <HI>scarlet</HI> and <HI>crimson,</HI> Is. i. 18. The name of that which is con∣tained, is given to that which contains it; so fields are called <HI>the upper and nether springs,</HI> Josh. xv. 19. 3. Names are put for the person or thing named; so the <HI>name</HI> of Christ, or of God, often signifies precisely <HI>Christ,</HI> or <HI>God</HI> himself, Acts iv. 12. Deut xxviii. 58. 4. Persons and things are named according to appear∣ance, not reality: so angels are called <HI>men,</HI> Gen. xviii.; Satan is called <HI>Samuel,</HI> 1 Sam. xxviii. 14.—20.; error is called a <HI>gospel,</HI> Gal. i. 6▪</P>
<P>By SYNCEDOCHE, 1. More universal terms are put for such as are more restricted: as ALL, for <HI>many;</HI> for all kinds; for the greater or better part, Matth. iii. 5.
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
and xix. 28.; <HI>the world,</HI> for the Roman empire, the Gentiles, the wicked, the Antichristians, Luke ii. 1. 1 John ii. 2. and v. 18. Rev. xiii. 8.; <HI>every creature,</HI> for men, Mark xvi. 15.; or the plural number for the singular, as <HI>children,</HI> for child, Gen. xxi. 7. 2. More restricted terms are put for such as are more extensive: as, <HI>one</HI> for all of the kind, Psal. i. 1.; <HI>yesterday,</HI> for time past, Heb. xiii. 8,; a limited number, as <HI>thrice, seven,</HI> or ten <HI>times,</HI> for frequently, 2 Cor. xii. 8. Psal. cxix. 164.; a <HI>thousand, five thousand,</HI> for an uncertain number, Is. xxx. 17. 3. A whole person, thing, place, or time, is put for an adjunct or part of it. So Christ is said to die; to be buried; when only his body died, and was buried, John xix. 42. and ii. 13.; <HI>world</HI> is put for <HI>Canaan,</HI> Rom. iv. 13.; <HI>north</HI> for <HI>Caldea,</HI> Jer. i. 13. <HI>for ever,</HI> for a <HI>long</HI> time, Dan. ii. 4. 4. A part of a person, thing, place, or time, is put for the whole of it. So <HI>souls</HI> denote human persons, Acts ii. 41; <HI>re∣surrection</HI> is put for Christ's whole appearance in our nature, Acts i. 22.; <HI>hour</HI> for a period of time, John iv. 23.</P>
<P>By MEIOSIS, a great deal less is expressed, than is really signified. Thus, in the negative precepts, much more is intended than is literally expressed, Exod. xx. 3.—17.</P>
<P>By HYPERBOLE, things are represented, as far more insignificant, great, glorious, or numerous, than they really are. So the Hebrew spies are represented as <HI>grasshoppers,</HI> Numb. xiii. 33.; the top of a tower or wall is said <HI>to reach to heaven,</HI> Gen. xi. 4. Deut. xi. 1.; the histories of all Christ's works could not be <HI>contained,</HI> rather <HI>perused,</HI> by the <HI>world,</HI> John xxi. 25.; the Is∣raelites are represented, as in number <HI>like to the sand on the sea shore, or dust of the earth,</HI> Gen. xiii 16. and xxii. 17.; so contentions are called <HI>wars,</HI> Jam. iv. 1.; plenty of milk, honey, and butter, or oil, is represen∣ted as <HI>rivers of it,</HI> Job. xxix. 6.; Saul and Jonathan are represented as <HI>swifter than eagles,</HI> and <HI>stronger than lions,</HI> 2 Sam. i. 23. The terms of this figure must al¦ways be understood with due limitation.</P>
<P>By IRONY, words are uttered with such an air, or other circumstance, as makes them bear a signification
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
quite contrary to their common one: as, <HI>Let them,</HI> the false gods, <HI>rise up and help you,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 38. <HI>Bless God, and die,</HI> Job. ii. 12. <HI>Rejoice, O young man,</HI> &amp;c. Eccl. xi. 9. <HI>Sleep on now,</HI> &amp;c. Matth. xxvi. 45. <HI>Cry a∣loud; for he is a God,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Kings xviii. 27. <HI>Go up and prosper; for the Lord shall deliver it,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Kings xxii. 15. When the irony is extremely sharp and reproach∣ful, it is called a <HI>sarcasm,</HI> as <HI>a goodly price,</HI> &amp;c. Zech. xi. 13. <HI>How glorious was the King of Israel to day!</HI> 2 Sam. vi. 20. <HI>He trusted in God,</HI> Psal. xxii. 8.</P>
<P>By METAPHOR, the names, qualities, and actions, proper to some persons or things, are ascribed to other persons or things, because of some <HI>likeness</HI> between them. These of rational beings, are ascribed to other rational beings; so Satan is called a <HI>god;</HI> ministers <HI>angels,</HI> &amp;c. Those of inanimate things, to other inanimate things; so, God's purpose, or gospel, is called a <HI>foundation,</HI> &amp;c. These of living creatures, to things without life: so the creation is said to <HI>groan,</HI> to <HI>travail,</HI> to <HI>will,</HI> &amp;c. Those of things without life, to such as have it; so Christ is called a <HI>way,</HI> a <HI>door,</HI> the <HI>truth,</HI> &amp;c.—That, by comparing the volumes of nature with the oracles of God, we may be alway, and every-where, surrounded with spiritual monitors. No figure is more frequent than this: nor is there almost any thing in nature, from which it is not drawn. Particularly, 1. From RATIO∣NAL BEINGS: as <HI>God, holy angels, devils;</HI> chiefly from men, in their PARTS, <HI>soul, body, flesh, blood, bones, head, face, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, cheeks, locks, hair, neck, shoulder, back, belly, hands, loins, bowels, navel, bosom, knees, legs, feet;</HI> in their RELATIONS, <HI>marriage, husband, spouse, men, women, virgins, young men, fathers, mo∣thers, sons, daughters, children, babes, widows, masters, servants, kings, judges, captains, subjects, soldiers, army, shepherds, teachers, merchants, Caananites, Arabians, Sodom, Gomorrah, Babylon, Egypt;</HI> in their ADJUNCTS, <HI>life, health, strength, beauty, wounds, sickness, leanness, lameness, blindness, plague, consumption, death, burial;</HI> and in their SENSATIONS, of <HI>seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling hunger, thirst;</HI> with their RELATIVES, <HI>comely, green, red, white, black, ugly, sweet, bitter, loathsome, hard, soft;</HI> in their ACTIONS, to <HI>eat, drink, stay, stanp,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<HI>walk, run, gird, care, fight, steal, rob, beget,</HI> &amp;c. 2. From BEASTS, <HI>fowls, birds, eagles, pelicans, owls, doves, hens, sparrows, flies, bees, locusts, grasshoppers, lions, unicorns, leopards, bears, boars, wolves, foxes, hinds, harts, roes, goats, kids, horse, bullocks, kine, heifers, asses, wild-asses, dromedaries, dogs, swine, sheep, rams, lambs, dragons, serpents, asps, vipers, scorpions, worms, spiders, fishes;</HI> with their ADJUNCTS, <HI>tail, horns, teeth, wings, scales, sting, fat, milk;</HI> and ACTIONS, to <HI>bite, sting, swallow, tear, fly,</HI> &amp;c. 3. From THINGS CELESTIAD, <HI>heaven, firmament, light, sun, moon, stars, clouds, vapour; shadow, darkness, rain, dew, wind, hail, snow, thunder, tempest, lightning, rainbow,</HI> &amp;c. 4.

<P>To understand Metaphors, it must be observed, that the foundation thereof is LIKENESS between the things from which the metaphor is drawn, and that to which it is applied. When this likeness is exhibited in one or a few expressions, it is a SIMPLE METAPHOR, When it is pursued with a variety of expressions, or there is a continued assemblage of metaphors, it is called an AL∣LEGORY. When the resemblance is harsh and far fetch∣ed, as to <HI>set a voice,</HI> it is a CATACHRESIS. When it is couched in a short saying, obscure and ambiguous, it is called a RIDDLE. When it is couched in a short say∣ing commonly used, it is termed a PROVERB. When the metaphoric representation is delivered in form of a history, it is a PARABLE. 2. Because every thing has various qualities and operations, one thing may be the metaphorical emblem of persons or things different, or contrary: so a LION is the emblem of God, of Christ, of Satan, and of men, good and bad. 3. The diffe∣rence between the emblem, and the object of the meta∣phor; that is, between that from which the metaphor is drawn, and that which it exhibits, renders it impos∣sible for any metaphor fully to represent its object, and absurd to expect, that an universal similitude betwixt the emblem and the object should ever be found. 4. Hence it sollows, that to squeeze metaphors, by run∣ning the parallel further than truth and decency, with respect to the emblem and object, will admit, is not to illustrate, but to discredit and darken the mysteries of God. 5. Nay, in the sacred metaphors, one particular is generally the <HI>principal</HI> thing thereby exhibited. THIS, by the attentive reader or preacher, should, from the circumstances of the text or context, be especially enquired after, and considered</P>

<P N="3">3. God is compared to a FATHER <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Jer. iii. 4.</NOTE>. In the first person of the adorable Godhead, he, from eternity, be∣got our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the contriver, pur∣poser, former, and preserver of all things. He is the
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
author and source of all light, knowledge, glory, mer∣cy, and goodness. From eternity, he chose into the number of his children; in time, he spiritually begets all his ransomed people: he bears, preserves, and com∣forts them; he nourisheth them with the flesh and blood of his Son; with the fulness of his love; the influence of his Spirit; and the sincere milk of his word: he clothes them with the imputed righteousness of his Son; the robe of implanted grace; and of a glorious gospel∣conversation. Never is he judicially wroth with any of his saints; but, to astonishment, loveth and delights in their persons, their graces, and good works: never doth he hurt; but saves and defends them from sin, Satan, and the world. He is especially tender of them, when they are weak and afflicted. Himself he propo∣seth for their copy and pattern: in every point of due behaviour, in all spiritual knowledge, godliness, and honesty, he trains them up and instructs them; readi∣ly he hears their requests; grants them every good thing; preserves them from evil, that it may not defile, hurt, or grieve them: his honourable name he puts upon them; his holy Spirit within them; and appoints his angels and ministers to guard, direct, and supply them. In all their ways, he leads them, takes them by their arms, teaching them to go: his word is their rule; his Spirit their com∣forter, instructor, and guide: his church and ordinances are his chamber of fellowship with them; his heavenly mansions he assigns for their habitation; affectionately he remembers and cares for them, even while they seem to be cast out of his sight; graciously he forgives their transgressions; he bears with their infirmities; and ten∣derly he sympathizes with them under their troubles; he is exceedingly grieved and dishonoured by their offences; and he wisely and kindly corrects them on ac∣count thereof; every one of them he enriches with his fulness, and makes heirs of his kingdom. In the pro∣mises of his word he dispones; in due time, he actually bestows salvation, endless, unsearchable glory; nay, his infinite Self, for their everlasting inheritance.—Be thou, JEHOVAH, <HI>my father,</HI> and the <HI>guide of my youth,</HI> my Fa∣ther of glory, mercies, and comforts.</P>
<P N="4">4. God is compared to a MASTER and HOUSEHOLD∣ER.
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
By him every mansion of heaven and earth was erected and furnished; by him is the whole family of angels, men, and every creature, ordered and settled. To every one he hath assigned his proper law, his stati∣on, and work. Angels and men he hath peculiarly connected with himself; and, by laying before them the most enriching and agreeable rewards, and the most shocking and fearful punishments, he engageth them to be faithful in their respective rank and service. His fa∣mily he instructs and protects. Every thing necessary for their peace, their health, and happiness, he richly provides. Those who are unruly, he corrects and pu∣nisheth. Wicked angels, and incorrigible men, he ex∣pels from his house. He hath appointed a day, in which he will call every rational servant to account, for his trust and conduct. His peculiar family is his church among men: to this he gives peculiar laws: this he governs, protects, and corrects; and rewards or puni∣sheth every member according to his work.—Lord, may I dwell in thy house, and be still praising thee. Every where is a hell, if I am absent from my God.</P>
<P N="5">5. God is compared to a KING. How infinite is his dignity; extensive his renown; great his power; ab∣solute his authority! To every reasonable creature he gives laws and wisely governs, righteously rewards, or punisheth them. Heaven is his palace and throne. An∣gels and saints are his honorary guards. All creatures are his armies. DIVine glory and greatness are his crown. Infinite power, justice, and love are his sceptre. Eve∣ry lawful court on earth, every man's breast, and the general judgment, are his courts of judicature: consci∣ence, magistrates, and ministers, are his deputies. The saved nations of mankind are his queen, his children. The ancient, the everlasting <HI>council of peace</HI> is the PRI∣VY, the governing fource of his whole administration. Our adored Mediator is his Secretary, his Minister of state. The scriptures of truth are the statutes of his kingdom, and the authentic records of his reign. The sentences of free forgiveness, of undeserved happiness, or of everlasting damnation, are the momentous edicts which proceed from his throne.—"Thou art my King, O God, command deliverance for Jacob."</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="27" REF="31"/>
6. God is compared to a JUDGE. With infinite wis∣dom and prudence; with unblemished equity, <HI>terrible majesty,</HI> unbounded authority, power, and courage, he maintains the honour of his sacred laws. Effectually he fists every man and devil at his bar: solemnly and con∣vincingly he chargeth them with their proper deeds: authoritatively he pronounceth, and infallibly he exe∣cuteth upon them, the most righteous sentences, corres∣pondent to the precept and the sanction of his law. It is at the highest peril, if I, if any creature, despise him; pretend to appeal from him; or find fault with his de∣cisions.—Lord, "enter not into into judgment with thy servant," upon his own works; "for in thy sight no living can be justified."</P>
<P N="7">7. God is a swift WITNESS. How exact is his know∣ledge of all things! he is infinitely true and faithful. Solemnly, by subscription and oath, he attests the in∣spired declarations of truth; the glad tidings of great joy; the record concerning his Son,—That in him there is eternal life for sinners of mankind, even the chief. In opposition to my wretched unbelief, he testifies to my heart, <HI>I am God, even thy God.</HI> At the tremen∣dous peril of calling, of attempting to make the <HI>God of truth a liar,</HI> a perjured person, do I, and do you chil∣dren of men, hesitate a moment to believe the <HI>joyful sound?</HI> Your whole conduct he knows; and according to his remembrance of it shall you be quickly judged, and your eternal state fixed. Even now, ye wicked, he testifies of your guilt by his judgments upon you; by his word unto you: but suddenly he shall declare it to your face; publish it to the world; and hasten your end∣less ruin. If God be my witness, what manner of person ought I to be "in all holy conversation and godliness?"</P>
<P N="8">8. God is compared to a CAPTAIN, and called the LORD OF HOSTS. It is his to levy, to march, to mus∣ter, and manage every army upon earth. It is his to appoint, to arm, to strengthen, direct, and make all his creatures to fight against his enemies; and to pro∣tect his chosen subjects. He enlists his people under his banner of truth, and of love. He teacheth them the spiritual warfare; gives them the whole "armour of righteousness, on the right hand and on the left▪" and
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
directs, encourageth, and enableth them to use it aright. To every one he prescribes his proper station and work; chuseth for them the field, and manner of conflict; safe∣ly he leads them on; secures them from death; heals their wounds; procures them complete victory; and be∣stows on them an everlasting reward.—Let me alway follow him, and fight under his protection.</P>
<P N="9">9. God is stiled a MAN OF WAR, or expert warrior. With unbounded wisdom, equity, power, and courage, he manageth every temporal, every spiritual warfare on earth. His chosen people he conquers by the sword of his Spirit, and the power of his grace. His, and their enemies, he seasonably, secretly, suddenly, boldly, and furiously attacks, routs, and destroys. Thus he advan∣ceth his honour; extends his peculiar dominion; pro∣tects his friends; and enricheth them with his spoil.—Against my corruptions, Lord, draw out the <HI>spear and shield;</HI> stain all thy raiment with their blood.</P>
<P N="10">10. God is likened to a GIANT; because of his un∣bounded might, bold courage, and awful terror. No creature is able, nor without infinite peril dares to op∣pose him. With ease he dismays, discomfits, and rains his enemies. Fearfully he often corrects his friends, and makes them to tremble under his hand. "Stand in awe," my soul, "and sin not Fear him that is able to cast soul and body into hell-fire; yea, I say, Fear him?" And be thou strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</P>
<P N="11">11. God is compared to an HUSBAND. By the invi∣tations of his word, and exercise of his providence, he wooeth his chosen people. He enters into marriage cove∣nant with them, and they become his. He <HI>dwells with,</HI> and in <HI>them, according to</HI> his infinite <HI>knowledge</HI> and love, Other members of the visible church are united to him by external relation, and share of his common favours: but those he peculiarly provides for, counsels, comforts, protects, and cherishes: nor doth he ever leave them, or forsake them.—Is my Maker my husband! is the Lord of hosts his name? the God of the whole earth MAY he be called.</P>
<P N="12">12. God is compared to an HUSBANDMAN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John xv. 1. Is. v. 1.—6.</NOTE>. The

universal frame of nature, the whole vineyard of his church, and outfield wilderness of this world, is of his plantation; and is under his care and management. This he DIVideth, hedgeth, defends, plants with men, good or bad, as he pleaseth. According to the benefits he bestows, is the fruit he requires. In the rich pastures of prosperity are many sinners, through their own cor∣ruption, fed for the slaughter of endless ruin. His own Son he planted in the barren soil of our nature; raised him up a <HI>plant of renown,</HI> the <HI>growth,</HI> the <HI>branch</HI> of the Lord: in death he cut him down, and trode him to dust, in the wine-fat of his indignation: he raised him again, and <HI>gave him glory; that our faith and hope might be in God.</HI> At infinite expence of power, love, care, meritorious suffering, and DIVine intercession, he plants, he manageth, the vineyard of his church. The <HI>stones</HI> of Heathenism, Popery, and like abomina∣tions, he gradually digs out. The <HI>wine-press</HI> of ordi∣nances, he graciously erects. Her members he DIVides into their proper place and station. With rules of go∣vernment, and with his special protection, he <HI>hedgeth</HI> her about. He sows her with the <HI>good seed</HI> of his word, and plants her with his precious saints. Every one of these he forms into a fruitful field, and delightful <HI>vine∣yard</HI> for himself. By breaking, by melting, and re∣moving their hardness and obduracy, he digs out the <HI>stones</HI> of their heart: by convincing, enlightening and renewing influence, he ploughs up its <HI>fallow ground</HI> and sows therein the <HI>good seed</HI> of his grace. It is thine O JEHOVAH, to weed, to prune thy vineyard, by sanc∣tified affliction, and sin-killing influence: to water it with the heavenly dew, the blessed rain of thy word and Spirit: thine to purge the world, by rooting out, by lopping off the noxious, the luxuriant transgressors; and to water it with the drops of prosperity. Angels, ministers, and magistrates, are employed to labour in, cultivate, and protect thy husbandry. Thine all-seeing eyes are ever on it, to shew thyself strong in the behalf of them that fear thee. But such as bring not forth good fruit, wilt thou give up to the stroke of thy wrath, and at last to the vengeance of hell fire.—May I, Lord, be thy <HI>husbandry:</HI> plant me in Christ; <HI>sow</HI>

<P N="14">14. God is compared to a GUIDE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlviii. 14.</NOTE>. The proper course of every creature he fully understands; and di∣rects them in their respective motions.

<P N="15">15. God is compared to a HUNTER <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job. x. 16.</NOTE>. How great is his activity; he slumbers not, nor sleeps; quickly his vengeance overtaketh his enemies; nor can any escape out of his hand.

<P N="16">16. God is compared to a BUILDER <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 4.</NOTE>. In his e∣ternal purpose he wisely planned; in time he skilfully formed, the whole structure of heaven and earth, and all that is therein. Upon his own power and will he laid the foundation. Gradually he finished, and mar∣vellously he connected, and adorned his work. Wisely he rears up the body of every animal for its particular use. In a gradual, a well-connected, comely, and mar∣vellous manner, he fashions the bodies and persons of men. By increasing their number and prosperity, he builds up particular families on earth. According to his eternal purpose, he raiseth up, strengthens, and embellisheth the nations: and when they are corrupted and wasted with sin, he pulls them down, and rears up

others in their stead. In his everlasting love, in the blood of his Son, he lays the foundation of our salva∣tion, and of his church, and of the work of grace in his people's hearts. Gradually he carries forward the erection, till it be perfected in that endless felicity, that <HI>house eternal in the heavens,</HI> which he hath prepared and furnished for them that love him.</P>
<P N="17">17. God is compared to a POTTER <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is. lxiv. 8.</NOTE>. With in∣finite care and skill he formed all things according to his purpose and pleasure. In the most different forms, and for the most different ends, he fashioned his creatures. Many of them he formed out of the clay and dust of the earth. Some angels and men he sovereignly ap∣pointed to everlasting honour; others, for their sin, to everlasting shame and contempt. At his pleasure, he disposeth of things, of persons, and nations; and won∣derfully he preserveth them amidst their native frailty and weakness—Never, my soul, say to him, Why hast thou made, why hast thou used me thus?</P>
<P N="18">18. God compares himself to a TRAVAILING WO∣MAN <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Is. xlii. 14.</NOTE>.

<P N="23">23. God compares himself to a MOTH and ROTTEN∣NESS <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hos. v. 12.</NOTE>. Secretly, insensibly, and gradually, he often, by his judgments, wastes mens spirits; their gifts; their privileges; and property; and renders them use∣less and contemptible.</P>

In him we may boldly defy our adversaries; and in him we must for ever abide: for O the fearful, the eternal, the unavoidable danger of those, who, in the moments of death, of judgment, are found without him!

<P N="35">35. God is compared to a STRONG-HOLD and FOR∣TRESS <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Psal. xviii. 2. 3.</NOTE>. In him is all fulness of spiritual defence, armour, and provision. It is impossible to batter down, scale, or undermine, the ETERNAL; and with infinite hazard do any attempt it; or to hurt these who are in him. It is only his to be the protector of his people.

<P N="41">41. God is called an EXCEEDING GREAT REWARD; and EXCEEDING JOY <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gen. xv. 2 Psal. xliii. 4.</NOTE>. Our enjoyment of him is the proper reward of Christ's righteousness imputed; and the gracious reward of our holy obedience: He infinitely surpasseth every other privilege. Nothing, my soul, is worth thy joys, or lovely as thy God: He infinitely transcends our comprehension, and desert. He is the cause and object of such solid, pure, and spiritual joy, as in sweetness, usefulness, and duration, far exceeds the joy of child-birth, of marriage, of harvest, of vic∣tory, of friendship, or of recovery of what had been lost.—Rejoice, my soul, in the Lord, and again rejoice.</P>

As Mediator, he is his Father's servant, his prin∣cipal attendant; sits at his right hand; is admitted into ineffable nearness and intimacy with him; Clearly he alway beholds, and with infinite pleasure and delight is he always beheld by, him; God's heart and eyes are on him continually. It is thine, O Jesus, to excel in ho∣liness, in activity, wisdom, and strength: thine to be sent on the principal errands of Heaven; and to pu∣blish the most important messages of God to men. He is the great MICHAEL, who is as the mighty God; who saves, protects, and delivers his people; and re∣strains and conquers his foes: the Angel that appear∣ed to the ancient patriarchs; and was with the Hebrews in the wilderness. His having <HI>power over fire,</HI> imports his absolute dominion over all the judgments of God, and the angry contentions of men; and his coming in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them who know not God, and who obey not the gospel.

<P>His <HI>house,</HI> is his church; which he planned; which he built and furnished; which he rules, protects, and with pleasure dwells in <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Song i. 17.</NOTE>.

4. Christ is often, especially by himself, called the SON OF MAN <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv. 14.</NOTE>; to denote the reality of his human nature; his astonishing debasement; and his amazing delight in it.—But did God indeed dwell with man! dwell in manhood upon earth!

<P N="5">5. Christ is compared to an HEAD <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Col. 1. 18.</NOTE>. His people, like hairs, are rooted and grounded, and do grow up in him. In the purpose of God, they were chosen in him; in the new covenant, they were represented by him. He is the great honour and beauty of, and di∣rects, governs, and conveys nourishment to, all his saints;—who are joined to him by faith. It is his to add ho∣nour and dignity to, and to rule over his church, which is united to him by his word, his ordinances, and mi∣nisters.—Is this <HI>Carmel-like</HI> head, this lofty, pleasant, fruitful, and all-exhibiting Immanuel; this <HI>crimson like,</HI> this sin bearing, this suffering, this royally-exalted Je∣sus, my one head? <HI>my Lord, and my God?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Christ is called a MEDIATOR, or DAYS-MAN <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 5.</NOTE>. He is God and man in one person; a truly middle per∣son between God and us. How infinitely wise! how peaceful and condescending! how just! how merciful! how impartial, faithful, and well affected towards both God and men! Necessarily chosen to reconcile his Fa∣ther's honour with our happiness, he effects it by satis∣fying his offended justice with his righteousness and blood; by staying our enmity by his Spirit and love.—If I refuse his mediation, am I not infallibly left to the severity of the broken law, and incensed vengeance of God? Kiss, receive, my soul, the Son, lest he be an∣gry. Obey his voice; beware of him; provoke him not.</P>
<P N="7">7. Christ is called a SURETY <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 22.</NOTE>. At his Father's call, he, from eternity, became one with us in the eye of the broken law: kindly he undertook for us: infal∣libly he secured the full payment of that obedience and satisfaction which we owed to his Father's law and ju∣stice. Kind to astonishment, he took our whole debt
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
upon himself, and erased our name from the bond: kindly he said, If thou, Father, if thou, justice, admit me, let these go their way: what they owe thee, put it on mine account.—Never, my soul, go about to esta∣blish thine own righteousness: never thus attempt to thrust Jesus's name from thy debt-bond, to insert thy own: never repine, that when I had nothing to pay, he frankly undertook all; and in <HI>due time gave his life a ransom for many.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Christ is compared to a FATHER <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Is. ix. 6.</NOTE>. By his suf∣ferings, the travel of his soul; by his resurrection from the dead; by the influence of his Spirit; by the incor∣ruptible seed of his grace and word; he, in our regene∣ration, begets us again to a lively hope: his image he puts on us, and calls us by his new name. By his word and Spirit he teacheth, and guides us in the way where∣in we should go. By his power, his angels, and mini∣sters, he guards and protects us from danger. With his "robes of righteousness, and garment of salvation," he covers our nakedness, and adorns our person. With his <HI>flesh and blood,</HI> his person, obedience, and atonement, he refresheth and nourisheth our soul: and for drink, he giveth us his <HI>love, which is better than wine.—</HI>Thrice blessed Father of the fatherless, stay of the orphans! when both father and mother forsake me, do thou take me up.</P>
<P N="9">9. Christ is called a TESTATOR <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 15. 16.</NOTE>. In his unbound∣ed affection to his poor kinsmen, he, as our dying Re∣deemer, irreversibly disannulled our obligation to the broken law; and before witnesses, before God, angels, and men, he, in the latter will of his blessed word, so∣lemnly bequeathed to us his whole fulness, his purcha∣sed blessings. By his death he confirmed; with his name he signed; in the inspired records he registered; in the ordinances of the gospel he publisheth; in the sa∣craments he seals, his donation: He himself, his Fa∣ther, his blessed Spirit, are the faithful executors thereof.—Search, my soul, the Scriptures, they are the Testament of a DIVine Father, of a bleeding Redeemer; let them be sweeter than honey to my taste: Can I,

<P N="10">10. Christ is compared to a BRIDEGROOM and HUS∣BAND <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Math. xxv. 6. 2 Cor. xi. 2.</NOTE>. With his Father's consent, he, with infi∣nite wisdom and prudence, fixed his love on sinful men. His friends and servants, the prophets, and blessed Bap∣tist, he sent before him to intimate his gracious designs. In the fulness of time, he assumed our nature. To pay our debt; to disannul our marriage with sin, Satan, and the broken law: to conquer and slay our spiritual foes; to prepare for himself and us a wedding garment of e∣verlasting righteousness;—he laid down his life.—In the gospel he demands and wooeth our heart. Notwithstand∣ing our base birth, our froward temper, our lothsome appearance, our brutish ignorance and folly, our po∣verty, weakness, unworthiness, our infamous character, and the affronts and injuries without number, we do him, he, to the endless admiration of angels and men, intimates his love to us, offers and presents himself for our spiritual husband. In the promise he proclaims his intention of marriage: with unmatched earnestness and patience, he invites, he intreats, he urgeth our heart to accept him. With the motives, of our absolute necessity; of his own excellency; his high dignity; his unfading comeliness; his unsearchable riches; his dying, his giving, his almighty love,—he enforceth his suit. The love tokens of ordinances, of common spiritual ope∣rations, being given, he, in the moment fixed by his ancient purpose, breaks our union to the broken covenant, to our lusts, to Satan, and to a present evil world. With pleasure and joy he unites, he espouseth us to him∣self; he giveth us an interest in his person, and all that he hath; he arrays us with the robes of his righteousness and grace; he forgiveth our offences; he covers our infirmi∣ty; and supplies our need. Kindly and prudently he abides with, cherisheth, delights in, defends, enricheth, ennobles, and favours with due direction, warning, re∣proof. At last, with solemn pomp, and with amazing joy, he transports us, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, into his celestial mansions, that we may be
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
ever with him, to behold his glory, and become per∣fectly like him, by seeing him as he is.—Listen, ye children of men, "all things are ready, come ye to the marriage. See that ye refuse not him that cometh," that wooeth, "from heaven. My beloved is mine, and I am his."</P>
<P N="11">11. Christ is compared to an HEIR, or FIRST∣BORN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 12. Col. i. 5.—18.</NOTE>. He is the eternal Son of God. He hath the most honourable, full, and unchangeable right to his Father's whole property. He is the support, the ho∣nour of his family, in heaven or in earth. Him hath his Father solemnly infeoffed in all that he hath, and blessed him above all blessing and praise. It is his to portion out every creature, chiefly his ransomed bre∣thren and sisters of men▪ and <HI>out of his fulness do we all receive, and grace for grace.—</HI>For ever, in all things, let him have the pre-eminence. Ah! alas! that he was so lately born in my heart!</P>
<P N="12">12. Christ is compared to a BROTHER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 1.</NOTE>. He is a true descendant of Adam, and wears the same human nature with us. O how he loveth, how bound, how ready to teach, to help, relieve, and protect us! Nor, however worthy, exalted, and honourable he be, is he ashamed to own his fraternal relation to us. How plea∣sed in converse, in fellowship, in familiar intimacy with us! He is a <HI>brother born for adversity:</HI> in days of tribu∣lation, he shews the most distinguished kindness; he af∣fords the most speedy and signal relier.—Never, O Possess∣or of all fulness, shall thy bowels suffer me, thy base, thy sinful, thy indigent brother, to perish for want! Jesus, <HI>thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy Father's chil∣dren shall bow down before thee.</HI> When I find thee with∣out, in this evil world, let me kiss; let me embrace; let me openly avouch thee; let me <HI>bring thee to my mo∣ther's house, to the chambers of</HI> that church <HI>that conceived me.</HI></P>

<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
by which he sheweth them his kindness! How wisely he considers their case! With his love, that thinketh no evil; with his imputed atonement; he covers our nakedness, and conceals our infirmity. It is not thine, adored Redeemer, to say, <HI>Be warmed and filled;</HI> but to give what is neeedful, even <HI>above all that we can ask or think.</HI> It is thine, to warn us of out danger; to re∣prove our mistakes: surely thy smiting shall not break my head, but be a precious oil to me. It is thine, to help us in trouble; to turn all our bed in our sickness; to comfort us when cast down. In death, and at the awful bar, it is thine to stick closer to us than a bro∣ther: though all men forsake us, yet wilt not thou. It is thine, rather to die for us, than to deny us in any wise;—it is thine to solve our doubts; to give us coun∣sel in perplexity; to allow us frequent messages of thy love; to impart to us, the secrets of thy providence, thy covenant:—thine to delight in our, ah thrice-un∣worthy company: It is thine always to seek our true welfare; to be highly grieved when we slight thy fa∣vours; to count them, who hate us, thine enemies, and avenge them as such.—"This is my beloved and my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem." Let me shew myself friendly; mine own friend, and my Father's friend, my soul, forget, forsake thou not.</P>
<P N="14">14. Christ is a LAWGIVER <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. ix. 21.</NOTE>. He gives law to eve∣ry creature in heaven and on earth. All the laws of in∣spiration derive their origin from him.

It is his to give us the law of faith, fulfilled not by doing, but by belie∣ving on him that justifieth the ungodly; to give us the moral law, without an annexed sanction of eternal life or death; to give us the new commandment, to love one another. And from regard to his authority, must we ransomed subjects obey; for, though <HI>dead to the law</HI> as a covenant, we are not <HI>without law to God,</HI> but <HI>un∣der the law to Christ.</HI> O Jesus, "how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.</P>
<P N="15">15. Christ is called a KING <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. cx. 5. Rev. xv. 3. and xix. 16.</NOTE>. As God he hath a natural right to rule over all; as Mediator, he hath gi∣ven

to him "all power in heaven and on earth." It is his to prescribe rules for his kingdom of the church, and see to the execution thereof. It is his to erect, maintain, and order his kingdom; his to subdue to himself, to pardon, to rule, honour, reward, and pro∣tect, his people; and to observe, restrain, conquer, and punish, his and their enemies, as is good in his sight.

He is the high favour∣ite of Heaven; entirely acquainted with all the DIVine secrets. Nor is any thing transacted by his Father, without his express concurrence. In harmonious con∣cert. with his adored Father, and blessed Spirit, he devised, he fixed, the whole plan of our redemption, and every concern thereof, without ever needing assistance from the wisdom of creatures. His whole conduct is infinitely reasonable and wise in itself, though often dark and mysterious to created, chiefly to carnal, reason. It is thine, O Jesus, to advise and direct us in every hard and intricate case; to acquaint us savingly with the laws, the statutes, the gospel-edicts, of Heaven. It is thine to shew us the weakness or validity of our claim, and of our evidence of right to the inheritance above;—thine to manage every important concern of our spiritual marriage, our peace, or prosperity, to thy honour and our endless advantage.—Shall <HI>I bless the Lord, that gave me counsel,</HI> and made <HI>my reins</HI> to <HI>instruct me,</HI> in the secret watches of the night!</P>

By his own righteousness, and as the sovereign head of the church, he alone enters into the temple, the presence of God. How extensive is his dominion, and redoubled his glory in heaven and earth! Under his evangelic, his mistennial reign, magistrates, ministers, and people, do justice; work righteousness, and cheerfully exert themselves, and their substance, to promote his honour. It is his to bear the whole expence of offerings for his chosen subjects:—His to offer him∣self an atoning sacrifice; and to enable them to offer their persons and service, <HI>living</HI> and <HI>acceptable sacrifi∣ces to God:—</HI>His to cause his own person sacrifice, and fulness, to be duly exhibited, and spiritually received, on every proper and solemn occasion. He is alway in the <HI>midst of</HI> his people, to protect them from every foe; sympathize with them in every trouble; supply them with every necessary grace; assist them in every holy service; and to be constantly seen and enjoyed by them.

In the name of JEHOVAH, the <HI>great King,</HI> whose <HI>name is dreadful among the Heathen,</HI> he came perfonally <HI>in the flesh;</HI> and, in the gospel, still comes spiritually to our world. With infinite wisdom, untainted faithfulness, unspotted integrity, and tender affection to God, and to men, he solemnly proposeth the terms, lays the foun∣dation of, and completes the blessed treaty of everlasting peace and friendship; of spiritual marriage and traffic, between his almighty Father, and us sinful, rebellious, and self-ruined men. Think, my soul, how it grieves him, when his proposals are slighted! how he leaves the despisers to wonder and perish, under the fury of his Father's just vengeance! to whom, at the end, he will deliver up the kingdom, and render an exact account of his management and success.—If this <HI>Ambassador of peace weep bitterly;</HI> if by tears, by groans, by blood, by death, he beseech me to be reconciled unto God; O my foul, beware of him; obey his voice; provoke him not; he will not pardon my wilful, my final, transgressions; for my Father's name is in him.</P>

In his Father's name and authority, he, with unlimited wisdom, impartial equity, almighty power, and undaunted courage, maintains the honour of the DIVine law, and the peace and order of his subjects. By passing and executing proper and season∣able sentences, he renders himself infinitely terrible to offenders. It is his to recognize every man's deeds, and

to reward or revenge, as they are good, or bad. Now, every conscience, every church ruler, is deputy under him. At the last day, every man, every apostate angel; shall be publicly fisted at his decisive tribunal. By the testimony of God and of their conscience, shall he fully evince; and openly shall he declare, what they have been, or done. According to his righteous law, shall he pro∣nounce and execute their sentence; dismissing the wick∣ed <HI>into everlasting punishment,</HI> but <HI>the righteous into life eternal.—</HI>Meditate terror, ye obstinate transgressors, "behold, he cometh with clouds; every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: all the <HI>wicked</HI> kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. <HI>Now, now</HI> is the accepted time; <HI>now,</HI> is the day of salvation:" <HI>now,</HI> embrace him as your offered, your all-sufficient Saviour; so shall ye be for ever delivered from him, as your angry Judge. If you neglect this, how shall you "abide the day of his coming, in flaming fire, to take vengeance on all them that know not God, and who obey not the gospel?"

<P N="20">20. Christ is an ADVOCATE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 1.</NOTE>. According to his Fa∣ther's appointment, he openly invites sinful men, parti∣cularly his children, to commit their spiritual causes into his hand. Kindly, freely, readily, and often undesired, he undertakes them, as far as equity permits. With in∣sinite skill, integrity, faithfulness, boldness, care, and success, he pleads them at his Father's bar, notwithstand∣ing all that a broken law, a malicious devil, or guilty conscience, can alledge to oppose him. Insisting on the unanswerable plea, of his finished righteousness, of his own and his Father's honour, love, promise, his inter∣cession alway prevails, obtains the gracious pardon of every crime, the full claim to, and perfect possession of, all that grace, and that glory, allotted and established by the laws of the new covenant,—Hail, my soul, <HI>Jesus</HI> "is able to save <HI>me</HI> to the uttermost; seeing he ever li∣veth

By his Father's commandment, he, in the display of his ho∣nour, his valour, his wisdom, faithfulness, and strength, cheerfully, openly, and boldly proclaimed war with sin, Satan, and a carnal world. Armed with zeal, with righ∣teousness, with power and wrath, he, in his incarnation, his death, resurrection, ascension, his spiritual and se∣cond coming, fights with, conquers, and spoils them; enriching his friends with the prey. It is thine, O Jesus, with <HI>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,</HI> with the gospel-<HI>arrows,</HI> of deep conviction, of saving il∣lumination and heart-melting influence, to subdue thy people, and make them <HI>willing in the day</HI> of thy <HI>power.</HI> It is thine, to cause them enlist under they banner, and take hold of thy covenant:—Thine to teach their <HI>hands to war,</HI> and their <HI>fingers to fight,</HI> with principalities, powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places; and to <HI>mortify the deeds of the body,</HI> and <HI>crucify the flesh,</HI> that they may live:—Thine to array them with the military robes of thy righteousness and grace, and to equip them with <HI>the whole armour of God.</HI> It is thine to appoint each his particular station and work, and direct them to watch, march, attack, or retreat; to <HI>watch</HI> against temptation; <HI>lust against the flesh; resist the devil;</HI> or <HI>flee youthful lusts.</HI> It is thine to encourage their heart, with the hopes of victory, and of <HI>an exceeding great re∣ward.</HI> Thine to provide their spiritual provision; to shew them the enemy; prudently discover their force, and point out their stratagems.

In the wilderness of a natural state, and of a present evil world, he meets with his chosen. In their regeneration, he converts them from the error of their way; makes them to enter in at the strait gate; and brings them into himself, the way that leadeth unto life. He abides with, comforts, assists, goes before, and shews a pattern to them; and by his word and Spirit directs them in every case, till they enter into the joy of their Lord.

In consequence of DIVine appointment and furniture for his work, he, by his word and Spirit, faithfully and infallibly reveals to men his Father's will; chiefly, what relates to a future state, and the way to it. How un∣bounded, and exact, is his knowledge of the DIVine mind. It is his to have "compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way:" with astonishing pa∣tience and care, freely to teach them the mysteries of the kingdom. It is his to inform his people, how to cleanse themselves from iniquity; how to avert DIVine judgments; how to war with their spiritual foes, and to assure them of success therein. It is his to solve all their doubts; and speak a word in season to them that are weary. It is his to confirm his mission with miracles, obvious to the world; and with almighty influence, felt by the heart. It is his to appoint and qualify every true teacher in his church. And ah the fearful doom, that awaits such as neglect to attend his instructions! O ye sons of men, whether you hear, or whether you forbear, you shall know that a prophet was among you!—God forbid that our Prophet should be without honour in his own country.</P>

Being DIVinely called, he, with the utmost fidelity and clearness, declares to men the whole truth of God, ne∣cessary to be known, and nothing else. Solemnly he confirmed it, by his own, and his prophets and apostles miracles, almost innumerable. Solemnly he confirm∣ed it, by his own suffering and death. Solemnly he confirms it, by his oath and sacraments; by the testi∣mony of his Spirit to mens conscience, and by the attesting course of his providence in the world.

It is truly thine to confirm thy mission and doctrine with miracles, benevolent, great, and many; to confer the Holy Ghost, by laying on of thy hands; to be equally concerned with all the churches; and to be properly succeeded by none in thy office.

In the greatness of his wisdom and power, he, in the counsel of peace, came UP, and engaged for us. In his incarnation, he came UP, and assumed our nature.

In his resurrection, in his ascension, he went UP, and took possession of everlasting felicity in our name. In his in∣tercession, he stands UP, as our advocate, to "appear in the presence of God for us." At last he will <HI>break through</HI> and come in the clouds.

By convictions, he digs and ploughs it. By gospel-offers and gracious influences, he fattens it. With his full flood of DIVine doctrines, and spiritual grace, he waters it. By cutting off unruly professors, by death, or by church-censure; by purging out unruly lusts, and irre∣gular practices; by means of sanctified afflictions, good laws, and gracious influences, he prunes and weeds it.

Tenderly he binds up our painful wounds; and by his promise applieth his blood, his righteousness, and grace to our soul. To prevent, or recover from, sainting fear and despondency, he pours out his Spirit, sheds abroad his encouraging, supporting, and refreshful love in our heart, by the Holy Ghost.

In his DIVine person, he is possessed of the same infinite power with his Father and blessed Spirit, In the union of his of his infinitely different, his opposite natures; in God's punishing him for our sin, and supporting him under it; in his numerous miracles; in his bearing our sins, and rendering full satisfaction for them; in his rising from the sealed, the watched grave, as our quickening head; in his ascending to glory, and sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; in his eternal and ever-prevalent intercession; in his judging the world, and executing his decisive sentences; in his removing our guilt, by justification; in his removing the power and filth of our sin, by regeneration and sanctification; in his bearing with our unnumbered infirmities and provo∣cations; in his preserving us from dangers, snares, and temptations, more than the hairs of our head; in his bearing us to a state of unspotted holiness, and everlast∣ing joy; is the almighty power of God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, vigorously exerted, and illustriously displayed.

<P N="59">59. He is called the WISDOM of God <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 24. Prov. viii. and ix.</NOTE>. As the second person in the adorable Godhead, he is infi∣nitely wise and prudent. As Mediator, he is the foun∣dation of all the counsels of God. In the constitution of his person; in his saving offices, relations, and acts;—how clearly is the <HI>manifold wisdom of God</HI> manifested! Here natures, infinitely distinct, are closely, are inse∣parably joined. Here, in the purpose, the promise, the purchase, and application of our redemption, mercy meets with truth, righteousness and peace kiss each other. Here DIVine justice is satisfied in the nature that sinned. Satan is conquered in the nature which he cor∣rupted.

Sin is condemned and destroyed, while the sinner is acquitted and saved. Sin, the worst of all things, occasions the highest honour to God, whom it had offended; and the greatest felicity to transgressors, whom it had ruined. The innocent, the holy One and the Just, is justly condemned, and punished; while un∣godly criminals are righteously acquitted, accepted, and rewarded with endless and inconceiveable bliss. Ever∣lasting life to the betrayers and murderers, flows from the death of God. Sinners are saved according to the riches of his grace, and yet in equity most strict. Temptations and troubles are made to work for us, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. And in thee, O Jesus, are "hid all the treasures of wisdom and know∣ledge," to be communicated to men.—Whatever there∣fore thou art to Jews or Greeks, be to me the "wis∣dom of God, and the power of God."</P>

O his kindness in inviting, in seeking and saving that which was lost! in convincing, in enlightening, in converting, and espousing us to himself! in forgi∣ving our sin, accepting our person, and cleansing our nature! in supporting our spirit, cheering our heart, and allowing us the most familiar fellowship, and endless intimacy with himself? O the love of God to him, and to us, in giving him to us, our surety, our husband, our portion!—O blessed channel of JEHOVAH'S love to us, and of our's to him! blessed author, cause, and ob∣ject of our love! and who, in thy person, thy nature, thy names, thy qualities, thy office, relations, appea∣rances, states, words, and works, art <HI>altogether lovely!</HI> Despised, detested, be my love, that is not fixed on thee.</P>

<P N="62">62. Christ is called the WORD of GOD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John. i. 1. Rev. xix. 13.</NOTE>. He is the express image of his Father's person and mind. In the council of peace he spoke for us; undertook as our surety. In the beginning he spoke of all things out of nothing. In his intercession with the Father, he ever speaks in our behalf. By his word and Spirit, he speaks to our ear, our heart. He is the author, the interpre∣ter, the witness, the subject-matter and scope of God's written word.

<P N="63">63. Christ is called the MERCY <HI>promised</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 58. 72. 73.</NOTE>. With∣out controversy, he is the greatest blessing ever promised, offered, or given by a gracious God, to sinful wretched men.

Freely, without constraint, without request, without defert, without hope of any requital, <HI>without money and without price,</HI> God, in the council of peace, and in his debased estate, gave him for us as our surety and ran∣som. Now, in the gospel invitations and promises, he giveth him as a complete, able, willing, and ready Sa∣viour, a glorious husband, and everlasting portion to us,

Is there not in him all <HI>inexpressible,</HI> all inconceivable goodness, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge? is he not made of God to us <HI>unspeakable</HI> fulness of wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. How <HI>unspeakably</HI> pre∣cious and useful is he in his person, office, and work! From what <HI>unspeakable</HI> corruption and misery; and to what <HI>unspeakable</HI> holiness and felicity doth he save us! How <HI>unspeakably</HI> his entrance into our heart endears God to us; maketh room for him in our soul; and worketh in us gladness, and joy <HI>unspeakable,</HI> and full of glory! And through what <HI>unspeakable,</HI> inconceivable duration, shall he abide with us as our God, and our all! "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift."</P>
<P N="65">65. Christ is called the COVENANT given to the peo∣ple <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xlii. 6. and xlix. 8.</NOTE>. He is the foundation, the framer, the finisher, the fulfiller, of the <HI>new covenant.</HI> He is the surety, the Mediator, the priest, the trustee, the testator, the prophet, interpreter, messenger, witness, and king of it. Its condition he undertook and performed: its blessings he purchased; and is the substance and glory thereof. All of them were primarily promised to him, and lodged in his hand. According to the terms of it, he bestows them upon sinful men, who, being clothed with his righteousness, and quickened by his Spirit, do, in his strength, lay hold on it, enter into the bond of it, and perform the gratitude required by the law of it. Blessed covenant, thou art "all my salvation, and all my desire."</P>
<P N="66">66. Christ is called our PEACE <HI>(a).</HI> From eternity he devised the matter, the means, the measure of our peace with God; with our conscience; with neighbours; with angels; with animals; with creatures unnumber∣ed. With his blood he purchased it. His continuance in our nature is the unceasing pledge and security of it. His advocacy before God procures and maintains the actual possession of it. In the blessed gospel he preach∣eth it to them "that are far off, and to them that are near." In our new birth, our pardon, our acceptance, our adoption, sanctification, and endless felicity, he, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mic. v. 5. Eph. ii. 14.</NOTE>

The Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and song: he also is become my salvation.</P>

By his incarnation, his death, his resurrection, and spiritual in∣fluence, he recovers us from the sting of a natural, and from the power of spiritual and eternal death. The ho∣nour of the DIVine perfections, and broken law, man's

He is the life-giving source, and author of our faith, our hope, our repent∣ance, love, and new obedience. It is his to revive our languishing graces and comforts; to restore the expiring life, beauty, and order of his church; to quicken the dead, and bring them out of their graves; <Q>some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.</Q> He that believeth on him, though he were dead, yet shall he live.</P>
<P N="70">70. Christ is called the LIFE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 20.</NOTE>. He is the living God, who giveth life and breath unto all things. In his wisdom and love he devised; by his obedience, suf∣fering, and death, he purchased; in himself he exempli∣fieth; by his intercession he procures; from his fulness he giveth; by his word and Spirit he conveys and maintains; and himself and fulness are the matter, and his glory the end of—our life of justification, holiness, comfort, and endless felicity. It is his to revive us again; restore our fainting soul; and render us lively and active in the service of God.—Is my <HI>life hid with Christ in God,</HI> that when he who is my life shall appear, I may <HI>also appear with him in glory?</HI> Am I <HI>crucified with Christ,</HI> and <HI>yet live;</HI> and <HI>yet not I, but Christ liveth in me?</HI> Is the <HI>lise that I live, by faith on the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me?</HI></P>

Being coeval with his eternal Father, that DIVine Sun, how sweet, pleasant, incomprehensible, bright, and glo∣rious! He giveth the power of vision; is the cause, means, and first object of spiritual knowledge; is seen in his own influence, and by his own light. It is thine, O <HI>light of life,</HI> to diffuse beauty, cheerfulness, joy, and life, among thy people. It is thine, by thy presence, to chase away the shadows and darkness of ignorance, corruption, and wo. Without thee, every thing ap∣pears to lose its beauty and comeliness; and existence, enjoyments, creation, nay, Godhead, appear an unsight∣ly,

It is thine to discover things in their true nature: and hence how hated, how shunned by men, whose foolish heart is darkened; whose deeds are evil! It is thine, without contracting any defilement, to pe∣netrate, to shine into, defiled churches and souls. How swift thy approaches to, and thy motions in our heart! And as the lightning cometh from the east, and shineth unto the west, so shall thy coming, O Son of man, be.—Blessed author, purchaser, price, repository, be∣stower, substance of all our light, spiritual and eternal; <HI>when I sit in darkness,</HI> be thou <HI>a light unto me;</HI> my everlasting light, my God, my glory.</P>

Breaking up and appearing for us in the council of peace; breaking forth towards us in ancient promises and types;—in his actual incar∣nation;—in his obediential life, bloody death, and glo∣rious resurrection; visiting us in the gospel-revelation; manifesting himself to us in the moment of conversion, of renewed discoveries of his love, of death, and at the last day, he, after a sad, cold, and dark night of igno∣rance, corruption, trouble, or death, doth in a most so∣vereign, certain, free, gradual, and irresistible manner, rouse, refresh, quicken, and enlighten his people or church; and manifest his own glory; and introduce a pleasant, a happy day, of love, of grace, of power, of salvation, of spiritual espousals, of life, of liberty, of everlasting felicity, rest, admiration, and praise.—Dawn, O DAY-SPRING, on my soul, on the world.

<P N="73">73. Christ is called the SUN <HI>of righteousness, with heal∣ing in his wings</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mal. iv. 3.</NOTE>. All things are obvious, naked, and open to him.

How cheerfully! how freely! how regularly! how constantly! how unweariedly! how powerfully! how extensively! he communicateth his con∣vincing, his enlightening, his heart-penetrating, warm∣ing, and melting; his soul-quickening, healing, refresh∣ing, directing, and fructifying; his sin-withering, and consuming influence! How truly is he the restful centre of all things, chiefly of you redeemed, and of all your concerns! How fast fixed in his sphere! No principa∣pality nor power, nor sin, nor trouble, nor death, shall ever pluck him from his station, in the new covenant,—in the third heaven,—in the church,—or in my heart; nor ever arrest his course. Not ten thousand <HI>lamps</HI> of or∣dinances, ministers, or graces; not ten thousand <HI>moons</HI> of creation, but his countenance alone, can give day to my soul. It is thine, O blessed Sun, to bring life and immortality to light; to guide our feet in the way of peace. Oh, how sweet to walk in thy light, and work out our salvation with fear and trembling! It is thine, to warm my cold affections, to melt my frozen heart, to enkindle my soul into an unquenchable flame of love. It is thine to dispel my clouds of ignorance, guilt, desertion, temptation; and to chase these shadows as far as east is distant from the west. It is thine to gild my clouds of trouble, and make my darkness, my death, my grave, to smile. It is thine to cheer my heart, call forth my flowers of grace, make them cast out their roots, and spread their smell as Lebanon. None, O Jesus, remain in darkness, but those who shut their eyes to thy illumination. Ye sons of sloth, you offspring of darkness, awake from your sleep; arise that Christ may give you light. It is high time for you to awake; the day of your life is far spent; now is your damnation, if mercy prevent not, nearer than when you were conceived. How different, Lord, the tendency of thy solar, thy gospel-light! how it operates according to the nature of those on whom it shines!

Dazzled with thy glory, that excelleth, my eyes lose sight of created comely scenes; I tread the moon of this world under my feet: I count all but loss, but dung, for the excellency of Christ Jesus my Lord: all my powers cry out, "O Lord, who is like unto thee?

<P N="81">81. Christ is compared to an APPLE-TREE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song ii 3.</NOTE>. In usefulness, for honouring his Father, and saving his people; in comeliness and beauty, he infinitely tran∣scendeth angels and men: he is the darling, the chief, care of Heaven. His honour is easily injured; he is readily touched with the injuries, done to his children. For us, he bears the wholesome, the sweet, the savoury, the cooling, the refreshing, the healing, the love exci∣ting, apples of everlasting righteousness, of pardon, ac∣ceptance, regeneration, adoption, sanctification, of spi∣ritual, peace, comfort, and endless happiness. How savoury! how medicinal, are the very <HI>leaves</HI> and blos∣soms of his word and ordinances, to those who labour under the sense of their spiritual emnity, ignorance, pride, hypocrisy; malice, envy, unbelief, legality, earthly mindedness; of heart-wandering, deadness, or other inward plagues! If by faith we touch the hem of his garment, we shall be made whole. But if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OMECITRON TREE be here meant, Christ is compared to it, for his greatness and excellency. In the produc∣tion, how bitter tasted to him were his fruits, which are so fragrant to us! and amidst what bitter tribulations

we now experience their delightful sweetness! How constantly ripe! how effectual a remed against the poi∣son of sin! How they strengthen, and perfame our spi∣ritual breath!—Sit, O my soul, under his shadow with great delight, and let his fruit be sweet to my taste.</P>
<P N="82">82. Christ is compared to a CEDAR-TREE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song. v. 15. Ezek. xvii. 23.</NOTE>. How infinite the depth, the firmness of his root; his Godhead, and even the establishment of his Mediatorial person and office! How high! how excellent! how strong, firm, and incoruptible! how ever flourishing and comely! In his incarnation, he grew as a root out of dry ground. In his humiliation, how exposed to storms and suffering! How complete! how extensive and refreshing the shadow of his protection and righteousness! How abundant his fulness of sap!—of grace and virtue! How manifold his use in erecting the temple! the church! the new∣covenant building of mercy! and the frame of grace in our heart! How sweet! how fragrant to our soul, his person, his office, his relations, his names, his ordinan∣ces, righteousness, and grace!—Is he to me as "Le∣banon, excellent as the cedars!"</P>
<P N="83">83.

Being exalted too the right hand of the Majesty on high, how he bends downward his boughs of promises and influences, that he may dwell with, and be apprehended and held fast by the debased transgressor, the humble soul! how perpetually verdant; "the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever!" How un∣fading his glory! How free from every knot of corrup∣tion! How unbounded his sap, his fulness of grace and of glory! In him it pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell. How completely he protects his chosen from the heat, the storm of almighty vengeance, and of the temptations of Satan! How he exposed his head, his heart, for our sake!

<P N="84">84. Christ is compared to an OLIVE TREE, or two OLIVE BRANCHFS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. iv. 11.—14.</NOTE>. How infinite is the fulness of grace, which resides in his complex person.

And what a sure emblem of perfect peace between God and my soul!—If I hear of him in the gospel, it is the voice of the Lord, saying, "Peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near," If I believe; if I feel him in my heart; God keeps me in <HI>perfect peace:</HI> his covenant of peace shall not be broken.</P>
<P N="85">85. Christ is compared to a CLUSTER OF COPHER, <HI>in the vineyards of Engedi</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song. i. 14.</NOTE>.

If it signify the <HI>cypirus,</HI> or sword-grass; Christ resembles it in his fruitfulness, his savouriness, his mar∣vellous virtue to strengthen our soul, and to heal the bites, the stings, the wounds made by the old serpent. If it mean <HI>dates,</HI> the fruit of the palm-tree; Christ re∣sembles them in his wide-spread renown, his infinite sweetness, and nourishing virtue. If it denote <HI>balsam;</HI> Christ resembles it in his preciousness, his acceptable∣ness, his sweetness and fragrancy, his preserving, his all∣healing, and nourishing virtue. If it be <HI>camphire;</HI> Christ resembles it in his good savour, his healing, his reviving, and exhilarating virtue.

Blessed Vine, why, after thy fruitfulness, wast thou cut down! why burnt in the fire of thy Father's wrath! not for thine, but for our barrenness, our unprofitableness. Why wast thou trodden in the wine-press of his indignation? why was thy soul troubled, squeezed, and pressed out of measure!

<P N="87">87. Christ is compared to a ROOT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. liii. 1. Rev. xxii. 16.</NOTE>.

In the winter of spiritual indiffe∣rence, deadness, darkness, desertion, and in the storms of persecution, temptation, and trouble, how effectually he preserveth them from total withering! Against him, in his person, office, righteousness, and grace, do our e∣nemies with their axe of opposition principally strike.—Blessed <HI>Root of David,</HI> and of every other creature, es∣pecially of these of the household of faith, neither storm, nor drought, nor axe, nor age, can despoil thee of thy vigour, thy freshness.

With honour to God, and happiness to men! He is a TOP BRANCH, sprung of David's royal family; and in himself most excellent and honorable; higher than kings of any land, He is the <HI>branch of the Lord,</HI> raised up by, cared for, and fruitful to the glory of, God. He is a <HI>branch of righteousness;</HI> for the display of his righteousness, God sent him into the world, raised him up, and made him bring forth, an <HI>everlasting righteousness,</HI> for our justification; and by his influence are all his children made righteous in good works.</P>
<P N="89">89. Christ is called the PLANT OF RENOWN raised up by God <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. 29.</NOTE>. In his ancient purpose, in his incarnation and death, God planted him: in his resurrection and ascension, he raised him up, and gave him glory: In the preaching of the gospel, in the esteem and affection of his people, he continueth to exalt him: at the last day he will raise him up to judge the world, and thereby display his astonishing height and grandeur. In his pedigree, his person, his natures, names, his qualities, offices, relations, and work, how infinitely famous! for antiquity; for deep humiliation; for excellent beauty; for never-fading verdure; for nourishing and medicinal virtue; for refreshful savour and shadow; for astoni∣shing fruitfulness in every necessary, every useful bene∣fit; how widely is he renowned!—O publish his name; <HI>declare his doings among the people;</HI> ascribe ye greatness to our Christ; let every one to another, "the fathers unto the children, declare his truth.

<P N="90">90. Christ is called the ROSE OF SHARON, or field <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 1.</NOTE>. In his birth, he grew out of David's withered root; he grew up in the field of this world, and was therein ex∣posed to contempt, trouble, and death. In the field of his word and ordinances, he is to be found as the free, the common Saviour of men. In his person God-man, how beautiful and glorious,—the honour of creation!

His character, offices, his relations, righteousness, and grace, how savoury and refreshful! how effectually, if applied, they cure our heart-burning enmity and ma∣lice! our spiritual blindness, despondency, and con∣sumption in sin!</P>
<P N="91">91. Christ is called the LILY OF THE VALLEY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 1.</NOTE>. Once he was planted in a debased state, in the low val∣ley of our world. To the most wretched sinners he is offered; and in the humble heart he takes up his abode. How infinitely savoury, pure, comely, and fruitful! How high; yet how meek, lowly, and condescending! What an effectual remedy are his influences, against our spi∣ritual pride, faintness, blindness, hardness of heart, or any like plague! None of the diseases of Egypt, O Sa∣viour, shall come upon me; for thou art the Lord my God, that healeth me. Under my foolish, my sinful at∣tempts, every ailment is hopeless; but thou hast <HI>power over all plagues;</HI> when <HI>thou wilt, thou canst make me whole.</HI></P>
<P N="92">92. Christ is compared to a BUNDLE OF MYRRH <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 13.</NOTE>. How unbounded and unsearchable! how well connected, and inamissible, his fulness of righteousness and grace! how it endears him to his Father, and to his people! how it pleaseth, refresheth, beautifieth, perfumes, puri∣fies,—prevents corruption, heals and anoints their soul! Bitter indeed, O Redeemer, were thy sufferings to thee! bitter is our cross, which attends thy coming to our soul! but, thyself, how precious an offering to God, and how precious a gift of God to men!—O, till the night of trouble, of time, be finished, lie between my breasts; dwell near my heart: lodge amidst the embra∣ces of my faith and love!</P>
<P N="93">93. Christ compares himself to a CORN OF WHEAT, cast into the ground, that it might die and bring forth much fruit <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John xii. 24.</NOTE>. In himself how pure, precious, and substantial! how sweet and durable!—In his incarna∣tion he fell into the earth; in his suffering and exit he died; but rose again, and grew up to amazing heights of exaltation. Innumerable glories he brought forth, to himself and to his Father: innumerable blessings he brought forth, for the wholesome nourishment of our

<P N="94">94. Christ is called the FIRST-FRUITS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv.</NOTE>. First in order of nature, and as the pledge of our resurrection, he rose from the dead. How transcendent and incom∣parable is his excellency! How solemnly was he himself, and, by him, are his saints, consecrated to the service of God. On that day the first-fruits of barley were offer∣ed, he rose from the grave. On that, upon which the first-fruits of wheat were offered, he returned to bless the nations in the power of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="95">95. Christ is compared to a GREAT ROCK <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxxii. 2. Matth. xvi. 18. Matth. vii. 24. 25.</NOTE>. How infinitely high! how firm! unchangeable! and invin∣cible!

What a furnished herbary of medicinal simples <HI>for the healing of the nations!</HI> What a sure foun∣dation of our hope! our endless felicity! What a safe, a lofty, a curious residence! where no enemy can annoy us! where we are sheltered, protected, and refreshed, with DIVine perfections and providences! where we en∣joy the most clear, extensive, and pleasant prospect of the whole fulness and ways of God! Blessed <HI>Rock higher than I;</HI> more excellent than mountains of prey; suffi∣cient to overshadow me! Lofty <HI>munition of rocks,</HI> cause my soul to mount up, and reside in thee; so shall I see the King in his beauty, and the land that is very far off: bread shall be given me, and my water shall be sure.

Planted in him, how we abound in the <HI>fruits of righteousness,</HI> to the praise of the glory of his virtue and grace! But if the word signify CRIMSON, Christ resembles it, in bearing our sins, in suffering their punishment; and in receiving his royal and glorious reward. Suppose, my soul, thou shouldst resist unto blood, striving against sin, let thy conversation be in heaven, whence I look for the Sa∣viour: let the fruits of the Spirit in all goodness be in me, and abound; so shall I never fail.</P>
<P N="97">97. Christ is compared to LEBANON, that goodly mountain on the north of Canaan <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song v. 15.</NOTE>. How infinitely higher than angels and men! How far ascended above all heavens! How great! how unfading his comeliness and excellency! how pleasant to behold!

What cleansing and refreshful streams of mercy flow from his bowels! How fully he protects our promised land, our new-covenant state, from the northern blasts of devouring wrath! And happy! hap∣py! in him are no dens of lions, no lodging of leopards.—Be thou my residence, my <HI>dwelling place in all gene∣rations.</HI></P>

How conceived and born into human nature by a virgin, who knew not a man! To make way for his spiritual kingdom, he overthrew the Heathenish empire of Rome, and subdued the nations to himself. A time cometh, when the knowledge of him shall cover the whole earth, as the waters cover the sea; when the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of

JEHOVAH chose him to be our Mediator, and tried him in the fire of his indignation. The saints choose him for their husband, their ALL; and try him, by depend∣ence on him, in their conviction, their temptations, and fiery troubles.</P>
<P N="100">100. Christ is called ONE STONE, <HI>upon which are seven eyes</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Zech iii. 9.</NOTE>. How infinitely firm and durable! How di∣stinguished and unmatched!

How fixed on him are the <HI>eyes</HI> of the blessed Spirit, to take of his, and shew it unto us!

They are graven on his heart. He was DIVinely constituted their kind representative and surety, and appointed to appear in the presence of God for us. In respect of manifesta∣tion, how deep engraven, on his person and office, are the perfections of God! How gloriously engraven on his humanity, the adorning graces of the Holy Ghost! In his debasement, how was he marked with wounds and bruises! how DIVinely made perfect through suffer∣ing! In his exaltation, how DIVinely is he marked with glory and honour!</P>
<P N="101">101. Christ is called a <HI>stone of stumbling,</HI> and <HI>rock of offence</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 8.</NOTE>. Provoked at his humble birth, his debased life, his ignominious death, and sorry retinue of disciples; at the holiness of his law, the searching and evangelic nature of his doctrine; at the simplicity of his ordi∣nances, the meanness and misconduct of his followers;—the Jews, and many others, to their spiritual hurt, to their everlasting ruin, refuse to embrace and obey him. <HI>Blessed,</HI> O Jesus, <HI>is he, whosoever is not offended in</HI> thee.</P>
<P N="102">102. Christ is compared to a WAY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 6. Is. xxxv. 8.</NOTE>. By his Fa∣ther's royal appointment, he came into this world. He removed every impediment of our access to God, and left us an example to walk in his steps.

In THIS, all who hear the gospel, are fully warranted to enter and walk; and by him they are graciously received, freely supported, perpetually directed, and finally ushered into

<P N="103">103. Christ is compared to a GATE and DOOR <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John x. 9.</NOTE>. By the wisdom, the power, and authority of God, he is constituted the proper means of our admission to the church, and the offices thereof: the only means of our access into a gracious state, or into the knowledge, fa∣vour, and presence of God: the sole means of our de∣fence from the storm of DIVine wrath, or the violence of our spiritual foes. Through him alone, JEHOVAH be∣stows his gracious alms of a full salvation, on those de∣stitute sinners, who apply for the same: and in him alone, our prayers and services are accepted. Now, in the promises, the invitations, and offers of the gospel, he is wide opened to men; <HI>him that cometh to</HI> him, he <HI>will in no wise cast out.</HI> At death, this exhibition will be shut to us; and at the judgment, to all his despisers: and for ever shall those, who are found without him, be confirmed in their miserable estate. He is represented as several, as <HI>twelve gates, three</HI> looking towards every airth: he is preached to sinners in all the ends of the earth; and O their free, their abundant access to God by him! He is represented as <HI>gates of pearl:</HI> for, O his unbounded preciousness and excellency, in his person and mediation! And, blessed be the Lord, he is open night and day; in every case, a ready means of access to God. They that come to him, shall, in spiritual li∣berty, <HI>go in and out,</HI> and find pasture; but shall <HI>no more go out</HI> from their gracious state.

Charge me, my conscience, to be a keep∣er at home, that my HOUSE may guide me: never let me be a bird wandering from her nest.</P>
<P N="105">105. Christ is compared to a COVERT and HIDING∣PLACE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. iv. 6. and xxxii. 2.</NOTE>. Secretly and mysteriously, in his person, righteousness, power, and love, are the persons, the life, safety, happiness, and comfort of his people, hidden and infallibly secured, from the avenging fury of an angry God, and against all danger and hurt, from sin, Satan, the world, death, or hell.—Am I hidden in him? Let rains come, and winds of temptation blow; no evil shall come near me. Quickly, O mine enemies, shall you seek me, and shall not find me; nay, even now, whither I go, ye cannot come; for having entered into his heart, his hand, the Lord hath shut me in.</P>

<P N="108">108. Christ is compared to a REST, or RESTING∣PLACE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 28. Psal. cxvi. 7.</NOTE>. God hath prepared him for sinful men, wearied with fulfilling their lusts, with bearing their troubles, with enduring the shocking views of their sin, and their punishment. The imputation of his righteous∣ness removes our burden of guilt. The faith, the sensible perception of it, removes our burden of legal conviction. The effectual intimation of his love makes our heart to cease from her sinful and legal courses; and delivers it from its burdens of carnal care. The faith of his un∣stinging our trouble, our death, and of his sympathizing with us therein, and making them to work for us a "far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory," removes their oppressive load. The faith of his veracity pledged in his promise, dispels every despondent fear, relative to our own or the church's true interest. In him we enjoy the firmest establishment in grace; the most powerful security against spiritual wandering; the fullest satisfac∣tion to all our desires; and the sweetest refreshment, joy, and comfort to our soul.—Return to this rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</P>
<P N="109">109. Christ is represented as God's HABITATION; his <HI>resting place;</HI> his THRONE of <HI>grace</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 19. Heb. iv. 16.</NOTE>. Not only is the Father in him, by mutual coexistence of nature; but he is eminently and eternally glorified by, satisfied with, delighted in, and rejoiceth over him, as our Mediator.

<P N="110">110. Christ is compared to a FOUNDATION <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. xxviii. 16.</NOTE>. First, in order of nature, his person, his office, his righteous∣ness, and intercession, are placed by his Father, as the firm, the eternal principle, support, security, and orna∣ment of his whole dispensation of mercy and grace; and of every doctrine, ordinance, and true member, of the church; and of all our religious worship and service;

<P N="111">111. Christ is called the CHIEF CORNER STONE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 20.</NOTE>. He was indeed despised and rejected by the Jewish builders, their rulers in church and state: but, by his person, his office, his relations, his righteousness, his in∣tercession, power, and love,—the whole new-covenant building of mercy, the whole temple of the church, Jewish or Gentile, militant or triumphant, the whole structure of grace in every believer's heart, is mysteriouf∣ly and beautifully united, regulated, adorned, supported, strengthened, and preserved.—Blessed Corner-stone, cement my soul to thee.</P>
<P N="112">112. Christ is compared to a NAIL <HI>in a sure place</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxii. 21.—24.</NOTE>.

<P N="113">113. Christ is represented as FOOD INDEED, and BREAD OF LIFE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John vi. 55. 43.</NOTE>. Being broken and bruised for our sins; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rodden in the wine press of his Father's wrath; roasted in the flames of his indignation; his person, his righ∣teousness, and saving benefits, are the most excellent, the wholesome, pleasant, nourishing, the strengthening and medicinal, the universal, absolutely necessary, and never-surfeiting provision of our soul, which begets, restores, maintains, and perfects our everlasting life. "Bread that cometh down from heaven," true, sub∣stantial provision, given of God to us, starving sinful men: may I, with all saints, daily by faith receive thee, with earnest desire, particular appropriation, and inward delight.<HI>—Evermore give us this bread.</HI></P>
<P N="114"><PB N="103" REF="107"/>
114. Christ is called the HIDDEN MANNA <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 17.</NOTE>. Him∣self and his fulness are the heavenly, the DIVinely pre∣pared, the free, the all-suiting provision, on which his chosen people are for ever nourished and fed. How invisible and unknown to a carnal world! How much at present unknown to the saints! How incomprehensi∣ble in any state, to angels or men!—Ever may my soul have this <HI>bread to eat,</HI> which the world knoweth not of.</P>
<P N="115">115. Christ is compared to RAIMENT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 14. Rev. iii. 18. and xix 8, Math. xxii. 11. 12.</NOTE>. How exactly suited to our condition, are his imputed righ∣teousness, and imparted grace! How they hide, they re∣move, our sinful deformity, guilt, and pollution! How they protect from scorching heat, from freezing cold, and every other spiritual hurt! How comely and ac∣ceptable they render us before God, angels, and good men! What spiritual health, what warmth of affection to good, they promote! How they qualify us for good works, and distinguish us from the rest of the world! They are "white raiment, fine linen, clean and white!" How pure and beautiful! How comely a badge, that we are <HI>more than conquerors</HI> of sin, Satan, and the world; and do <HI>always triumph</HI> in him; are at peace with God; are <HI>kings and priests,</HI> unto him; and always called to rejoice in him, as the God of our salvation! How they extract our corruption, and refresh our heart! They are a <HI>wedding-garment,</HI> applied in the moment of our mystical marriage to Christ. And how transcendent their richness, and beauty! How ornamental to our person and nature. How far preferable to any other covering! His righteousness imputed, is the ground of our joy; the foundation of our right to the prefence and favour of God. His grace imparted, is the occa∣sion of our spiritual joy; the mark of our union to Christ; and the substance of our meetness for his fellowship, and of our becoming a joy and rejoicing to him.—Not only profess but <HI>put on,</HI> O my soul, "the Lord Jesus, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts there∣of:" let my garments of a holy, cheerful conversation, be <HI>always white,</HI> and let my <HI>head,</HI> my heart, <HI>lack no ointment</HI> of his grace.</P>

<P N="117">117. Christ is called the PEARL <HI>of great price</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 45. 46.</NOTE>. How wonderful his DIVine, his human generation! Who can declare it?

How precious not millions of worlds; not the obedience of angels or men; but only thine own bleeding righteousness, can pur∣chase our title to thee. Yet, alas, how few possess, de∣sire, or know, thine excellency! Having found thee in the gospel, let me deliberately consent to sell all, disesteem all, forego all, to "win Christ, and be found in him," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d he in me the hope of glory.

<P N="119">119. Christ is compared to a TREASURY or STORE∣HOUSE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 19.</NOTE>.

Without receiving him, we obtain no saving benefit; and in embracing him, we obtain all inexhaustible stores of grace and glory.—Fear God, my soul, "there is no want to them that fear him."</P>

<P N="122">122. Christ is compared to a STAFF, a STAY, or SUP∣PORTING friend <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 5.</NOTE>. By dependence on his righteous∣ness, his power, his love, his intercession, and faithful∣ness, his chosen people are supported under their bur∣dens, of guilt, of corruption, or trouble; and enabled to walk up through this wilderness-world, to the high, the promised land of endless felicity.

<P N="127">127. Christ's love is LIFE, and BETTER THAN LIFE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxx 5. and lxiii. 3.</NOTE>. It is the source, the begetter, the restorer, the maintain∣er, and perfecter of our spiritual life; the bestower, conserver, and substance of our eternal life. How inex∣pressible its comforts! How it sweetens my natural exist∣ence! heals my maladies! redresseth my grievances! en∣richeth my soul with God as her portion! and enrap∣tureth my heart!

<P N="129">129. Christ's love is compared to a BANNER <HI>displayed in a banquetting-house</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 4.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Metaphors respecting the Holy Ghost.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Holy Ghost is compared to an AMBASSA∣DOR <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 7.</NOTE>. Agreeable to the dispensation of the new covenant, he is sent by; he comes in the name of Jesus Christ, the King of nations, and of his adored Father. And with infinite wisdom, power, and solem∣nity, he, in the word of the gospel, proposeth to our soul, a treaty of peace with God, of marriage with Christ, and of traffic with heaven. Powerfully he per∣suadeth us, heartily to accept of it; and, by sealing us up to the day of redemption, he irreversibly ratifieth the agreement. And alas! how vexed, how grieved with our rejection of his proposals; our resistance of his mo∣tions, and his striving with our conscience!<HI>—Grieve not,</HI> my soul, <HI>the holy Spirit, by whom</HI> I am <HI>sealed to the day of redemption.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Holy Ghost is called an ADVOCATE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 8. 9. 10. Rom. viii. 16. 27.</NOTE>. By his word, and by the miracles and common operations which attend it, he pleads the cause of our adored Re∣deemer against an evil world. By his saving discoveries and influences, he pleads it in our heart, against our corrupt lusts and affections; and against the false and injurious allegations of Satan. According to the will of God, he maketh intercession for the saints, exciting them to prayer; enditing their requests; directing and enabling them to present them at a throne of grace; and wait for the gracious answer of them.—Blessed pleader, make intercession for and in me, <HI>with groan∣ings, which cannot be uttered.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Holy Ghost is compared to a TEACHER <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 26.</NOTE>. Possessed of a comprehensive, an infinite knowledge of
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
all things; and, notwithstanding the most fearful con∣tempt and opposition, he, with amazing skill, care, kindness, and patience, seasonably and effectually in∣spired, and still opens up the mysterious doctrines, laws, promises, and threatenings of the oracles of God, and sixeth them in our memory and heart. He sheweth us the sinfulness and misery of our fallen state: sheweth what and whose we are. He enlightens our mind in the knowledge of the person, the offices, the relations, righ∣teousness, power, and love of Jesus Christ: and instructs us how to receive and improve him, as made of God to us <HI>wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</HI> He teacheth us the way to manage our heart, our time, our gifts, our grace; and how, therewith, best to pro∣mote the glory of God, and our own, and our neigh∣bour's real and lasting felicity. His presence, how in∣estimable a blessing! his absence, how fearful a plague! When sinners remain hardened in sin, how often he ceaseth striving with their conscience, and giveth them up to the lusts and imaginations of their evil heart.—O unparallelled Instructor, "open thou mine eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of thy law." Instruct and teach me in the way wherein I should go.</P>

Possessed of a perfect knowledge of the wilderness and sea of a present evil world, and of the course proper for every believer while in it, he comes to them in their time of need, continually abides with them, dwells in their heart, and by his word and influence, leads them to the promise, the person, the blood and righteousness, power and fulness of the Redeemer; he en∣courageth their spirit; directs them to their duty; and points out the dangerous errors, habits, and practices which they ought to avoid: he protects them from the assaults of sin, Satan, and the world; and at last brings them safe to the desired habitation of endless felicity.—To thee, O good Spirit, I resign my blind, my bewildered soul; lead thou me to the land of uprightness: Let me no more complain of rough ways; it is the Lord who leads me about, to humble me, and to prove me, and to do me good in my latter end.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Holy Ghost is called the COMFORTER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 26.</NOTE>. How kindly he sympathizeth with the saints in their manifold afflictions! he comes to, abides with, and is highly desired and esteemed by them. Tenderly he examines our case, reproves what is faulty, and enableth us to wash off its guilt in a Saviour's blood, and in his strength, mortify the deeds of the body, that we may live. In his word he seasonably presents the most sweet, substantial, and sure grounds of spiritual comfort: that Jesus the Son, the sent of God, hath borne our griefs, carried our sorrows, satisfied for our sins, and brought in an everlasting righteousness to cover our guil∣ty souls: that, well pleased for his righteousness sake, God, who loveth us with an everlasting love, doth in the promise give himself to be our God: that in the new∣covenant promises, the whole fulness of God is brought near and secured to our soul: that our manifold troubles flow from redeeming kindness, are light and short; but useful to promote our sanctification, and work for us an exceeding and eternal weight of glory: that we shall be for ever with the Lord, filled with his fulness, and made like him, by seeing him as he is. These he determines and enables our heart to apply, and so quickens, sup∣ports,

<P N="8">8. He is compared to a DOVE or TURTLE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. iii. 16 Song ii. 12.</NOTE>.

How firmly he cleaveth to such as are once joined to him! How swiftly he flies to relieve and comfort them! How affectionately he delights in them! how convincingly he informs their conscience, that the winter-storm of God's wrath is past, and the floods of his vengeance are dried up! And, by resting on Christ and his members, how mysteriously be conveys his quicken∣ing, sanctifying, meekening, and refreshful influence!</P>
<P N="9">9. He is called the POWER or FINGER <HI>of God</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 34. and xi. 20.</NOTE>.

<P N="10">10. He is compared to FIRE, and called <HI>the spirit of burning</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. iv. 4. Acts ii. 3. Rev. iv. 5.</NOTE>. How powerfully his influence penetrateth into the inmost recess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of our soul! How it enlightens our mind; melts, softens, and subdues our will; purgeth our conscience; warms and quickens our affections; comforts our heart; consumes our dross, rendering us <HI>holy as he is holy,</HI> and enabling us to ascend in heavenly desires, affections, and meditations! But alas! how hin∣dered, obscured, and quenched, by carnality of mind; by sensuality; sloth, or presumptuous sinning! He is represented by <HI>cloven tongues of fire</HI> sitting on the apo∣stles,
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
to denote his qualifying them, zealously, success∣fully, and in DIVers languages, to preach the everlasting gospel. He is called <HI>seven lamps of fire,</HI> to denote his perfect fulness of enlightening and heart-warming influ∣ence.</P>

His influences are represented by a <HI>rushing mighty wind;</HI> to signify, that nothing can withstand their power. They are called <HI>four winds;</HI> to denote their abundant va∣riety; their fitness and readiness to answer every man's case.

and render them susceptible of impressions by the word, and providence of God! How sweetly they refresh our languishing soul; quench our sinful thirst after carnal things; nourish our new man; render us strong in gra∣cious habits, and fruitful in every good word and work! God's <HI>pouring out</HI> this water, denotes his liberal and abundant communication thereof.

How fructifying, enriching, adorning, and protecting! How, on some occasions, they over flow the banks of ordinances, which are their ordinary chan∣nels! By these, how sweetly we trade with God, in receipt of his free favours, and returns of holy duties; and with men, in the exercise of charity and brotherly kind∣ness! by them, how sweetly are we separated and di∣stinguished from carnal men; are protected from our spiritual enemies; and at last carried out into the ocean of endless felicity! He is called "living waters; wa∣ter of life; a well of water, springing up to everlasting life." His influences are ever fresh and running; and do beget, restore, maintain, and perfect the life of our foul. His "proceeding from under the temple; from Jerusalem; from under the throne of God, and the Lamb; <HI>his</HI> running beside the altar in the midst of the city towards the east, to water the valley of Shittim; <HI>and</HI> running into the dead sea, causing every thing to live, and be fruitful; healing every thing except the marishes, and continuing both summer and winter;" imports, that his saving influences are the fruit of Jesus' death, and of God's being pacified and pleased in him; that they are easily and equally accessible to all that are in the church; that they water the lowly, fructify the barren, quicken the dead, and make all that are ordained to eternal life to revive, and live by faith on the Son of God; that they are to be obtained, and do attend the saint, in every case, pleased, or distressing.—Blessed

How, blessed Spirit, it refresheth my languishing heart, and restores me again! How it fills me with joy and gladness; strengthens me in the Lord my God; enables me to run in the way of his com∣mandments, when thou hast enlarged my heart; makes me to rejoice in God my Saviour, rejoice in tribulation, and fill my mouth with his praise all the day! How it emboldens me to come near unto God, even to his seat, and plead my very sinfulness and crimes, as an argumeat for mercy! Refreshful with this wine, I seek out my spiri∣tual enemies; and in the name of the Lord destroy them. Though ten thousands rise up against me, in this I am con∣fident: dauntless, I resist the devil, till he flee from me; crucify: he flesh, with its affections and lusts; glory in the cross of Christ, by which the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</P>

<P N="18">18. The Holy Ghost is compared to a SEAL <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 13. and iv. 30.</NOTE>. By the application of his word and gracious influences, he, with infinite power and authority, changeth our heart, making us holy as he is holy. He stamps the authority of Heaven upon the histories, the doctrines, the laws, the promises, threatenings, and predictions of scripture; and unfolds, or conceals them from men as he pleaseth. He confirms the new covenant with his chosen, confirms them in their gracious state, seals them up to the day of redemption, and hides, secures, and distinguisheth them from the rest of the world. Nay, it was he that fur∣nished and marked out our adored Jesus to his mediatory office. At your highest peril, do you, sons of men, counterfeit and break this seal, by adding to, or taking from the terms or sense of his word; or by indulging yourselves in hypocrisy and lust.—If I name the name of Christ, let me depart from iniquity.</P>

They most wickedly slander God to men, mis∣representing his wisdom, his power, holiness, justice, goodness, mercy, and truth;—his doctrines, his laws, purposes, promises, threatenings, and providence. In order to obtain his permission to hurt and destroy, they often maliciously accuse men to God! How often to mens own consciences, they falsely accuse them, saints as hypocritical dissemblers; and convinced persons as chargeable with the unpardonable sin! How actively, though secretly, they suggest the reproachful thoughts and speeches so common on earth! Till I choose to be a devil incarnate, let me <HI>speak evil of no man.</HI></P>

<PB N="120" REF="124"/>
and extensive is their power and dominion over Jews, Heathens, Mahometans, and nominal Christians, these large, but blind and ignorant tribes of mankind! Igno∣rance and delusion are the support of their power and influence; men being all naturally ignorant of God, are subject to them, till effectually called from darkness to God's marvellous light: and where, on earth, the light of inspired truth is unknown, or obscured, they openly govern.—Ah, how these <HI>other lords have had do∣minion</HI> over me! But now, Lord, will I <HI>only make men∣tion of thy name.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They are compared to WARRIOURS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 7.</NOTE>. Armed with the permission of God and their own malice, they with the utmost fury and fraud, oppose the work of God, in his church and in the souls of men; they cast terri∣ble, destructive, and fiery darts of temptation into mens hearts, and fiery contentions and persecutions into the visible church: How often, with open violence, they attack the people of God: Or, under some innocent or holy appearance, they lay snares for their life: Proud, daring, unwearied and cruel, they alway thirst for our ruin: constantly they watch in their own defence, and seize every advantage against our soul. How often they take captive, and cruelly use the most precious saints! How haughtily they triumph in every defeat given to the church, and her true members!—But, fresh sprinkled with Jesus' blood, strong in his might, resist, my soul, the devil, and he shall flee from thee.</P>
<P N="4">4. They are called BELIAL, <HI>without yoke, profit, or ascent</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 15.</NOTE>.

How detestable is their behaviour, to every one holy and pure! With what pleasure they perform mischief; what injury they do to Christ's sheep in this world! And how often, un∣der the form of goats, satyrs, and other hairy animals, have their Heathenish votaries adored them as gods of this world.</P>
<P N="8">8. Evil angels, especially their chief, is called SATAN, <HI>the malicious, obstinate, impudent adversary</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job i. and ii.</NOTE>. How burning, shameless, and implacable, is their malice towards God, or towards men!

To the most part of men on earth he gives law and governs, directs, and influenceth them; and by their ignorance, profaneness, dissimulations, idolatry, and superstition, is he cheerfully and zealously worshipped and served. Other evil spirits, wicked magistrates, and ministers,

are his angels, messengers, attendants, and deputies, whom he sends forth to act in his name. Transgres∣sing against God, and injuring of the souls of men, are his acceptable worship. Sinful oaths, witchcraft, sor∣cery, charming, necromancy, are his solemn appoint∣ments. Superstitious seasons are his sabbaths, his festi∣vals. Wanton balls, stage-plays, drunken clubs, con∣ventions for idolatry, or will-worship, are the solemn assemblies of his adorers. "Come not, my soul, into their secret: mine honour be thou not united."</P>
<P N="10">10. Satan is transformed into an ANGEL OF LIGHT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 14.</NOTE>. Once he was so; and how often, while he seeks to pro∣mote the vilest crimes, doth he put on the most shining pretences to eminent knowledge, wisdom, evangelical liberty, holiness, or zeal!—Be not, my soul, ignorant of, or inadvertant to his devices.</P>
<P N="11">11. He is called the PRINCE <HI>of the power of the air</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 2.</NOTE>. Such evil spirits as partly reside in, and fly about in the air; such unstable men as labour and feed on airy and unsubstantial fancies,—are under his rule and direction. And, at God's permission, he can raise aerial storms and tempests.—Is my God in the heavens! what pleas∣ed him he hath done: Die not then, my soul, for want of heavenly and substantial wisdom: ask it of God.</P>
<P N="12">12. He is called the FATHER <HI>of lying and liars</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John viii. 44.</NOTE>. By him was deceit and falsehood conceived and brought into the world. By him it is affectionately cherished, protected, encouraged, and rewarded with momentary, but earnal profit and pleasure. He first rendered men wicked and deceitful; and by them he is naturally, cheerfully, and readily honoured and obeyed.—Behold your parent, you children of falsehood and guile; be a∣shamed; return; do so no more.</P>

<P N="14">14. Satan in called a STRONG MAN ARMED, <HI>that keep∣eth the house in peace</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 29.</NOTE>. Armed with his own malice, with the DIVine permission, with the curse of the broken law lying on men's conscience, and with the dominion of sin over our heart; he, with great power, activity, care, and craft, maintains his work of wickedness in us, and his authority over us; confirms and promotes our ignorance and unconcern; bolts our heart with carnality, enmity, unbelief, or despair, till Jesus Christ, who is stronger than he, in the day of his power come, recal his permission, awaken our conscience, enlighten our mind, remove the curse, subdue our corruption, and so spoil him of his armour and goods.—Search, my soul, and look, who is thy guardian; who keepeth thee.</P>
<P N="15">15. Satan is compared to a TRAVELLER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth xii. 43. 44. 45.</NOTE>. Con∣stantly he walks <HI>to and fro</HI> in the earth, to spy oppor∣tunities of mischief; to tempt and ruin men. Often, for a while, he seemingly departs from wicked profess∣ors, with-holds his gross suggestions, or even stirs up to the external performance of religious exercise. After employing himself a while in the heart of real believers, where there is less corrupt moisture to work upon, or in dry and withered Heathenish countries, he returns to those whom he had deserted, and hurries them more fu∣riously than ever into wickedness.—Why, to entertain him, didst thou, Hebrew monarch, defile the wife of thy faithful hero; his <HI>one lamb, that lay in his bosom?</HI></P>
<P N="16">16.

In the field of creation, he first sowed the seeds of iniquity. His cursed temptations he daily sows in our heart, to produce the good-checking tares of sinful lusts. By him is the seed of open abominations, contention, idola∣try, and will-worship, sown among men. He is the true parent of every tare-like, every naughty person in the church.—How, Lord, hath thy enemy sowed tares in my soul, while I slept! Nor shall they be weeded out, till I die.</P>

With astonishing and unwearied care, alertness, and fraud, he allures, he indiscernibly spreads his entangling nets of temptation; transforms himself into an angel of light; employs false teachers, wicked rulers, and de∣ceitful men, to ensnare and ruin our souls. And how often we are unawares entangled and undone!—Lord, deliver me as a bird, as a roe, from this hunter; from the snare of this fowler.</P>
<P N="18">18. He is compared to a LION <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 8.</NOTE>. How terrible is his roaring, his temptations to the watchful saint! How infatiable in doing mischief! With what vigour, vio∣lence, and cruelty, he ever seeks to devour the souls, especially of his opposers!—Blessed <HI>Lion of the tribe of Judah,</HI> for me, tear him in pieces, while there is none to deliver him: make me <HI>sober and vigilant;</HI> because he <HI>goeth about seeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. He is called a great DRAGON <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. xx. 24.</NOTE>. How terrible is his appearance! How shocking his fierceness! his bloody cruelty! How outrageous his fury and malice against mankind, chiefly against Christ and his follow∣ers, who dare to oppose him, and trample on his autho∣rity! How suddenly he assaults! How infectious and deadly are his bites, his breathing, his temptations to our soul! In the night of debasement, how he bit and bruised, though not infected the heel, the manhood of Jesus Christ! In the night of ignorance, desertion, and trouble, how he assaults the children of men!—When, Lord, wilt thou bruise; when shall I tread the lion and the dragon under my feet?</P>
<P N="20">20. Satan is called an OLD SERBENT <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. xx. 2.</NOTE>. In the form of a serpent, he anciently seduced mankind. In this form, have they since frequently adored him! How filled with the poison of sinful corruption, wherewith he infects and ruins the children of men! How astonishing his subtle deceit! How deep rooted his envy! How im∣placable his malice!

Ought not the watching over, the feeding, the guiding, the cleansing, the eternal salvation thereof, to be our great care; our principal business! For, what am I profited, if I gain the whole world, and lose my own soul?</P>
<P N="20">20. It is compared to a SHIP <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">If. 54. 11.</NOTE>. How curious its frame! How great its worth! How extensive its use! With what care ought it to be bottomed in Jesus and his covenant! to be cleanfed from all silthiness of flesh and spirit! and often repaired with new strength and grace from the fulness of Christ! How incapable to move heavenward, without the gales of the Holy Ghost! In the troubled sea of this world, how exposed to swelling billows of adversity! to rocks of temptation! to robbe∣ries of Satan and wicked men! How carefully are its motions to be watched, and its course directed by the word of God! To secure a happy landing on the shores of immortality, how necessary is a firm anchoring of faith and hope in Jesus, the Rock of ages, within the vail! Alas! how many, the neglect of proper bottom∣ing on Christ, the neglect of proper ballast of humbling grace, and of proper care about spiritual things, bring to make shipwreck of the doctrines of faith, and of a good conscience! and to drown themselves in everlasting perdition!—O to swim for ever in the deeps of ever∣lasting love, where there is neither brink, nor bottom, surface, nor shore!</P>
<P N="21">21. Man's soul is compared to a HOUSE or PALACE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 20.</NOTE>. The understanding faculty is the windows: the recep∣tive capacity is the door: the will, in her supreme re∣gard, is the throne: sin or grace is the furniture: di∣vine persons, or infernal fiends, are the inhabitants. Christ's <HI>knocking</HI> for entrance <HI>at the door of it,</HI> is his alarming it by his providence; inviting it by his word; and striving for it, by the common operations of his Spirit. To <HI>open the heart</HI> to him, is to receive his in∣structive

light into the mind, and embrace him and his given fulness as excellent, with our desire and will.—Ah, my soul, what bolts of ignorance, Atheism, enmity, pride, attachment to self-righteousness, worldly minded∣ness, shut thee fast against him!</P>
<P N="22">22. Man's soul is compared to a TREASURY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii. 18. Matth. xiii. 52.</NOTE>. How secret and undiscovered to the world! How furnished with things deemed precious; and which are indeed of everlasting consequence! with her contents, we trade with God, and with men.—O could I, out of the good treasure of my heart, bring forth things new and old!</P>
<P N="23">23. Man's soul or conscience is compared to a CAN∣DLE or LAMP <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. xx. 27.</NOTE>. How ufeful, enlightening, and searching, her power! At the infinite knowledge of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, must her understand∣ing be lighted. And how small, in comparison thereof! Ah, how neglect to improve our light, occasions our walking in dark ignorance; our falling into snares, and tumbling headlong into eternal misery!</P>
<P N="24">24. Man's conscience is compared to a JUDGE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 20. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. To our conscience it belongs to enquire into our state, our thoughts, words, and actions; compare them with the law of God; and according thereto, condemn our wickedness, and sentence us to correction or punishment on account of it; and approve what is good, and assure us of a proper reward for it. May my conscience be sprinkled with Jesus' blood; may my life be by faith on him, a constant looking to, and following his steps: so shall not my heart reproach or condemn me while I live.</P>
<P N="25">25. Man's conscience is compared to a WITNESS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 1. and ii. 15.</NOTE>. How privy to all our conduct! When faithful, upon what strict examination it giveth clear testimony of the fact, and the form, of our actions, whether they be good or bad! If it live drousy, ignorant, and inatten∣tive to the nature of our qualities, our thoughts, our words, or actions; or is swayed in its testimony by any bribe, any consideration of carnal pleasure, honour, or advantage; how horrid its wickedness! and what a plague to the possessor! When faithful, what secret a∣bominations, or excellencies, it manifests! Hence, how

reproached; how abused by the wicked! And how lo∣ved by; and what a trusty friend, protector, and com∣fort to them, who live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world! How horrid the crime of stifling or denying its evidence! of muzzling its mouth, by mad rushing into further abomination! or of attempting to bribe it with some carnal or legal motive! My con∣science, let me deal tenderly with thee; he that touch∣eth thee, toucheth the apple of God's eye. Be thou, in a Saviour's blood, purged from dead works, enlight∣ened by his word, quickened by his Spirit, and softened by his love: so shalt thou be to me a faithful reprover on an obedient ear; thy smiting shall be a precious oil to me; with joy and gladness shall I hear thy declara∣tions at the decisive, the awful, bar.</P>
<P N="26">26. Man's conscience is compared to an INTIMATE COMPANION <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. iv. 4.</NOTE>. What important hints and interest∣ing news, it can ever declare unto us! What a candid reprover, or kind comforter! How useful to promote our holiness and felicity, is true friendship and intimacy with it! In the secret watches of the night, and on every important affair, how necessary is converse with, and deliberate consultation of it!—Turn aside, even now, my soul, and ask how this companion doth. Ask, what inward change have I felt? what important choice have I made? what spiritual mercy do I need? what is my great motive? whither do my affections bend? am I born from above? is my heart married to Jesus? i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it right with God? what have I done? what hath the Rock of Israel done to me? whence have I come? and whither should I now go in point of duty? and whither shall I go into the eternal state?</P>
<P N="27">27. Man's conscience is compared to a SERPENT, a gnawing WORM <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eccl. x. 8. Mark ix 44.</NOTE>. By presenting our crimes, by con∣demning and upbraiding for them, it stings and torments our soul. You despisers of Jesus, how, at last, shall your now blind, now bribed, now seared conscience, awaken upon you? For your breaking over the hedge of the DIVine law, how shall it bite you like a serpent, and sting like an adder! How call your sin to remembrance, and slay your soul!

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Metaphors respecting saints.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE saints are likened to GOD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. xii. 8.</NOTE>. They are <HI>made partakers of,</HI> and have fellowship with <HI>the DIVine nature.</HI> How spiritual their mind! how real their wisdom! their sanctity! How transcendent their excellency above their neighbours! How powerful their interest, their prayer, in the government of the world! By weeping and suplication they have power with God, and prevail; they command him concern∣ing his sons and his daughters, and the work of his hands: for their sakes the days of tribulation are shor∣tened; and they have power to smite the earth with plagues as often as they will. All are theirs, and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are compared to ANGELS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ibid. 1 Pet. i. 4.</NOTE>. How near a people to the Most High! How real and efficacious their views of his glory! How intimate with Heaven! "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him." How they run the way of his commandments, hearken∣ing to, and declaring the voice of his word! In the fu∣ture state, how marvellous their spiritual wisdom and strength! How perfect in holiness! How fully disen∣gaged from every nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l relation, and carnal concern! How uninterrupted; how ready, how cheerful, unwea∣ried, and universal, their service to God and the Lamb! "What manner of person ought I then to be, in all holy conversation!"</P>
<P N="3">3. In respect of different degrees of grace, they are likened to men of a different age <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 12.—14.</NOTE>. Weak saints are called BABES and LITTLE CHILDREN. They cannot live comfortably without pleasant frames. How apt to be easily tossed to and fro, with temptations! with eve∣ry wind of doctrine! How weak and unfit to digest and
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
feed on the deeper mysteries of God's word! or, with∣out frequent staggering, to continue in the course of their duty! Sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of a moderate standing and experience in grace, are called YOUNG MEN; because of their vi∣gour; their alertness; and ability to attack and fight the <HI>good fight</HI> of faith, with Satan, with their lusts, and with a present evil world. And how upright their sta∣ture; their conversation! how heavenly! how ready to run in the way of God's commandments! Aged emi∣nent saints are called FATHERS. How multiplied their experience of Jesus kindness! How distinguished their sagacity in knowing his voice and way! How prudent their foresight of danger; and ready hiding of themselves under his wings! how tender their love to weak saints! How earnest their endeavours to instruct, admonish, and give them an inviting pattern of gospel-holiness.</P>
<P N="4">4. In respect of different attainments, Saints are com∣parable to WOMEN of different stations in life <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song. vi. 8. 9. and i. 5. and iii. 11.</NOTE>.

How small their boldness and confidence before him! How ready to be slavishly afraid, that every trial shall sink them; every temptation se∣duce them from Christ! Others of some standing, to CONCUBINES: For, how legal their disposition! How powerful their spirit of bondage! How much influenced in duty by legal hopes of heaven, and servile fears of hell! How limited the beauty and cheerfulness of their spiritual practice! How few distinguished visits and views of Jesus' love they enjoy▪ Strong, believers are com∣parable to QUEENS.

<P N="5">5. Saints in general are compared to WOMEN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song. i. 8. 10. 11. 16. 17. and iii. 6.</NOTE>: for their beauty, as adorned with Jesus' righteousness and grace; for their weakness; their tender affection; their subjection to manifold infirmities, troubles, and
<PB N="140" REF="144"/>
dangers on earth. The human body, especially of wo∣men, in its members and adjuncts, is often used to re∣present their endowments and concerns. Their head upon them as <HI>Carmel,</HI> or <HI>crimson</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song. vii. 5.</NOTE>, signisies Christ himself as a lofty, a bleeding Redeemer; or, their top grace of hope, founded in his blood, supported by faith as a neck, and animating their spirit, and preserving it from sinking; and which looks at things that are hea∣venly, distant, and eternal. Their <HI>hair on their head,</HI> as a flock of goats, and as purple <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song. iv. 1. and vii. 5.</NOTE>, may signify their numerous, their beautiful, their adorning, though small, and self-undervalued, holy thoughts, words, and deeds, that spring from Jesus' fulness, and our assured hope of seeing him as he is. Their <HI>locks</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 7.</NOTE>, represent the beauty and connection of their gracious exercises. Their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song. iv. 1. and vii. 4.</NOTE>, are their spiritual knowledge and their faith by which they discern supernatural things, and are exceeding∣ly beautified before God. These are as <HI>doves eyes,</HI> come∣ly, chaste, and fixed on Jesus their husband. Their <HI>eyes being within their locks,</HI> implies their modesty; and how unseen their grace is to a carnal world. Their being <HI>in their head</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eccl. ii. 14.</NOTE>, denotes the propriety, useful∣ness, and excellency of their knowledge. Their <HI>ears</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Is. lv. 3.</NOTE>. denote their attention to, knowledge of, and obedience to, Christ's voice, in his word. Their <HI>nose like the tower of Lebanon looking towards Damascus</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Song. vii. 4. 8.</NOTE>, is their holy courage; their prudence, and their spiritual discern∣ing; whereby their conversation is mightily adorned; themselves rendered stately, and majestic; their worst, their Syrian-like adversaries are watched and dismayed; and their pleasant savour of inward grace is manifested. The <HI>smell of their nose like apples,</HI> imports, that they relish heavenly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piritual things; and that the exer∣tion of their inward grace in holy desires, edifying speech, or useful conversation, is extremely agreeable to Christ and his people. Their <HI>cheeks</HI> and <HI>temples as a piece of a pomegranate</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Song. i. 10. and iv. 3.</NOTE>, denote their holy blushing; and their humble, sober, and chaste conversation; which in a di∣stinguished manner adorn them. The <HI>rows of jewels,</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
on their checks <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10.</NOTE>, may signify the laws of Christ; which are exemplified, and his graces exerted, in their holy humble practice. Their <HI>mouth being a deliver∣er</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prox. xii. 6.</NOTE>, imports, that by their prayer and godly instruc∣tion, many are refined and preserved from snares and trouble. Their wholesome tongue being <HI>a tree of life; health; honey and milk under their tongue;</HI> and <HI>their lips feeding many</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 4 and xii 18. and x. 21.</NOTE>, imports, that, by their fer∣vent supplications and spiritual conference, many are graciously quickened, refreshed, healed, and nourished; and themselves kept in vigour and health; and prepared for eternal life. Their <HI>lips</HI> of knowledge and in∣struction, are as a <HI>precious jewel,</HI> or <HI>choice silver</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prov. xx. 15. and x. 20.</NOTE>; comely, precious, and useful.

Their <HI>lips are as a thread of scarlet</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 3.</NOTE>: their gracious converse, their earnest prayer, and grate∣ful praise, turn upon Jesus' bloody death; are present∣ed to God through his bleeding righteousness; and are a sure token of the soundness of their inner-man. Their <HI>teeth like an even-shorn, newely washed, and fruitful flock</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 2.</NOTE>, are their DIVinely-cleansed faith, and spiritual meditation, whereby they chew the bread of life, and render themselves truly holy, and fruitful in good works; or their holy, regular, and prudent zeal, by which they are active in raising up monuments of praise, and a seed to serve the Lord Christ. Their <HI>neck</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 4 and vii. 4.</NOTE>, is their faith, by which they are united to the Redeemer as their head; re∣ceive nourishment from him; and return their love and praises to him; and are exceedingly beautified before him. The <HI>chains of gold about</HI> it <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10.</NOTE>, are the precious and ever∣lasting promises which it embraceth; the blessings which it receiveth; the graces which it actuates; and the gifts which it improves. Their <HI>shoulder</HI> and <HI>back</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxix. 3.</NOTE>, are their strength and patience; or that wherein they are exposed to burdens, scourges, and suffering. Their <HI>hands and fingers dropping</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
<HI>with sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song v. 5.</NOTE>, are their faith by which they touch, and receive Christ, and work by love; and which,—O with what refreshful, and purifying virtue,—attempts to open the heart to him. Their <HI>breasts like young roes, towers, or clusters of grapes</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 3. 8. and viii. 10.</NOTE>, are their love, their affection, and desire after Christ, and their edifying talk and conduct; whereby their soul is beautified, and endeared to Christ; and whereby others are refreshed, helped, encourag∣ed, and nourished, with the <HI>sincere milk,</HI> and spiritual, wine of his word and grace. <HI>Betwixt their breasts</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 13.</NOTE>, is in their, heart, their most endeared embrace. Their <HI>heart is at their right hand</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eccl 1. 2.</NOTE>; they execute their purposes with dexterity and dispatch. Their <HI>merry heart,</HI> or good conscience, <HI>doth good like a medicine</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii. 22. and xv. 15.</NOTE>, promotes their foundness, and strength, natural, chiefly spiritual, and eternal; and <HI>is a continual feast,</HI> affords eminent and unceasing satisfaction, joy, and pleasure. Their <HI>bowels</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Col. iii 12.</NOTE>, are mercy, kindness, long-suffering, gentleness. Their <HI>belly like an heap of wheat, set about with lilies</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Song vii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, may denote their particular application of Jesus Christ, and feeding on him for spiritual nou∣rishment; and their tender concern to bring forth, and win others to him; both which are eminently and plen∣tifully connected and adorned with solid, savoury, and flourishing promises and fruits. Their <HI>navel as a round goblet full of liquor</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 2.</NOTE>, may signify their ever-receiving appetite and desire after Jesus Christ; whereby nourish∣ment is conveyed to their tender grace. The <HI>joints of their thighs like curious jewels</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 1.</NOTE>, are their valuable, their holy principles of faith and love; which being cu∣riously framed by the Redeemer, enable them with de∣cency, pleasure, and exactness, to walk in his ways. Their <HI>seet</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 1.</NOTE>, denote their affections, and well-ordered conversation: their <HI>shoes on their feet,</HI> denote the gospel of peace, as it were supporting, animating, and inter∣woven with their affections and practice; that with spi∣ritual freedom, courage, and safety, they may walk by
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
gospel-influence, and according to gospel-rule. Their <HI>feet only need to be washed</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John xiii. 10.</NOTE>; the justification of their person is at first complete; but the guilt of daily sins in their soul and practice, ever needs to be washed away. But the <HI>washing of feet,</HI> pled in excuse, for not readily receiving of Christ <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song v. 3.</NOTE>, is indifference about gospel-truth, and weariness of spiritual exercise. The saints being <HI>black, but comely;</HI> the <HI>fairest among women</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 5. 8.</NOTE>, imports, that though in their own view, though in them∣selves, and as surrounded with infirmities and trouble, they be unsightly, yet, as adorned with Jesus righteous∣ness and grace, and in his kind estimation, they are ex∣ceeding comely and beautiful. Their glorious <HI>garments,</HI> wrought with embroidery of gold, and <HI>of fine linen</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlv. 13. 14.</NOTE>, are his righteousness and grace; and the holy conversation founded thereon. It is their conversation-garment they <HI>wash and make clean in the blood of the Lamb</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. vii. 14.</NOTE>; by improving it as the sole ground of their hope, of their pardon, salvation, and acceptance with God. But the <HI>putting off the coat,</HI> which indisposeth them to receive Christ <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Song v. 3.</NOTE>, is indifference about him and his righteous∣ness, leaving off first love to him, neglect of command∣ed duty, inclination to carnal ease, and spiritual sleep. Unfaithful ministers <HI>take away</HI> the saints <HI>vail from them</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Song v. 7.</NOTE>: they expose their infirmities; deny them the faithful preaching of imputed righteousness; corrupt them from the simplicity of truth; and draw them to a compliance with the superstitious devices of men. Their <HI>borders of gold</HI> and <HI>studs of silver,</HI> for their robes <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Song i. 11.</NOTE>, are the precious and permanent blessings, graces, and gifts, which flow from their Mediator's righteousness; and which shine in their holy conversation. Their <HI>green bed</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Song i. 16.</NOTE>, is the comely, the refreshful, the flourishing and fruitful church, new covenant, scriptures, ordinances, and peculiar fellowship with Christ. Their <HI>perfumes</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 6.</NOTE>, are the graces given them. The church below, the hea∣vens above, are their <HI>house,</HI> and residence <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Song</NOTE>. Their

<P N="6">6. The saints are compared to ROYAL PERSONS, <HI>kings, queens, princes, princesses</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 6. Psal. xlv. 9. 13. 16.</NOTE>. Begotten of God, the King of all the earth: begotten of Jesus, the King of kings, by the travail of his soul; they possess royal blood, are <HI>partakers of a DIVine nature,</HI> endowed with a living principle of grace derived from Christ; are royally edu∣cated at his school of sacred inspiration, spiritual influ∣ence, and sanctified trouble; are disposed to a free, a ge∣nerous, and princely service of him; are married to him in the day of his power; and from him receive their honour, their fulness, and their title to an endless crown. How royal their <HI>apparel</HI> of imputed righteousness! im∣planted grace! and holy conversation! How royal their <HI>nourishment</HI> of his flesh and blood; of <HI>all the fulness of God!</HI> How royal their <HI>palace</HI> of his invisible church, his celestial mansion! How royal their <HI>chariot</HI> of the new covenant and gospel of God! How royal their <HI>rest</HI> in his well-guarded bed!

How royal the <HI>crown</HI> of DIVine loving-kindness and tender mercy, which they wear, and the triple <HI>crown</HI> of glory, life, and righteous∣ness, which they expect! How royal their <HI>throne,</HI> being raised up together, and made to sit together in heaven∣ly places, in, and with Christ Jesus! How royal their <HI>council,</HI> the ADORED THREE speaking in the scripture! How royal their heart! set upon things above, and not upon things of the earth! How royal and extensive their influence in managing and protecting the world, ruling the nations with a rod of iron, bearing rule over their own spirit, and conquering Satan and their lusts!—O marvellous, that by the grace of God I am what I am!</P>
<P N="7">7. They are a ROYAL PRIESTHOOD <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE>.

<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
and praise, of holy services, and broken hearts; and if called, of their life, for the honour of his name.</P>
<P N="8">8. They are called PROPHETS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal cv. 15. 1 John ii. 20. 27.</NOTE>. They know much of God's mind in comparison of others; and faithfully ought they to declare it unto others: Chiefly about fu∣ture things are they concerned; and from inspired reve∣lation, have they a solid and certain knowledge thereof.</P>
<P N="9">9. They are called a CHOSEN GENERATION, or KIN∣DRED <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE>. In Christ, before the world began, JEHOVAH chose, and ordained them to eternal life. By his grace he renders them choice and excellent. Of his own will, by the soul-travail of his Son, and the regenerating in∣fluence of his Spirit, he begets them again; espouseth them to Jesus, as their husband and brother; adopts them into his family, and constitutes them fellow-mem∣bers with angels and ransomed men.—Thou hast not, my soul, first chosen him, but he hath chosen thee.</P>
<P N="10">10. They are called a HOLY NATION <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE>. In whole they are a very numerous body, and closely connected, <HI>members one of another.</HI> Unfailing faith in a Redeemer, and unceasing love to one another, being their bonds of union, how firm and lasting is the duration of their body! Christ is their King in the midst of them, and their am∣bassador at the court of heaven. Fellowship with him, receiving out of his fulness, and loving one another, are their gainful traffic. Angels, and implanted graces, are their armies, DIVine attributes and promises, are their strong holds and fortifications. Resistance of sin, Satan, and the world, is their warfare. The heavenly oracles are their laws. Attendance on DIVine worship and ser∣vice, their tribute. And how holy are they in their birth; their state; their statutes; vows; purposes; and conversation!</P>
<P N="11">11. They are called a PECULIAR PEOPLE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE>. What a numerous, a flourishing body, whom God hath made the objects of his peculiar love! whom he hath purcha∣sed with the peculiar price of the blood of his Son! whom he subdues to himself, by a peculiar warfare of kindness and mercy! whom he hath enriched with pe∣culiar blessings! whose hearts are inhabited by peculiar

guests; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! whom God hath formed for himself, to shew forth his peculiar praise! whom he watches over, day and night, with peculiar care! and prepares for, and assures of peculiar mansions of joy! And O how different their pedigree; their foun∣dation; their government; their spirit; their way; their end; from that of the men of this world!</P>
<P N="12">12. They are a people that DWELL ALONE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiii. 9.</NOTE>. In God's predestining purpose, they have a distinct situa∣tion and place. They alone are set as a seal on Jesus' heart and arm. They alone are within the bond of the new covenant, and pale of the invisible church. And it is yours, ye ransomed, to avoid all unnecessary inti∣macy with carnal men; to study a contrariety of con∣duct; and to seek the unknown, but happy attain∣ment of secret fellowship with God. Let me live a∣lone from the world: but let the Father and the Son come unto me, and manifest themselves to my soul.</P>
<P N="13">13. They are CITIZENS and FELLOW-CITIZENS with the saints <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 19. Phil. iii. 20.</NOTE>. Solemn is their admission into the visi∣ble church. Glorious are their privileges: they are the objects of Heaven's distinguished care. Great is their gospel-freedom from the law as a covenant, and from the yoke of human impositions; gainful their traffic with Christ; great their honour in bearing his image and badge; comely their order; binding their common laws; strict their connection; and tender their care, one of an∣other: peculiar the right of their seed to an interest in Heaven's distinguished benefits. They are citizens of the church-triumphant; their burgesship, their conver∣sation, is in heaven. They are born from above; have their names written in heaven, in the Lamb's book of life: Being made free by the Son, they are free indeed. Their stock, their treasure, their heart are in heaven: in heavenly things they trade; in good and perfect things that come from above: they set their affections on these things that are above, where Jesus is at the right hand of God. Shortly shall THERE be their endless residence; they shall see the King in his beauty, and dwell in his pre∣sence.—Canst thou, my soul, instruct thy celestial lineage; speak the heavenly dialect of cordial praise?

His image is engraven, his name called upon, and his Spirit put within them. Dearly he loves them. Every thing necessary for time and et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnity, he provides for them. In every danger he protects; in every part of conduct, in every good word and work, he directs them: and for their faults, chiefly their stubbornness, he corrects them.

<P N="16">16. Saints are compared to BABES <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 25. 1 Pet. ii. 1.</NOTE>. In them∣selves how exceeding helpless, weak, and insignificant! How exposed to danger! but wonderfully protected and preserved by God. In what imperfect degree, they

here possess all the graces of the perfect, the glorisied saints! How native; how earnest, their inclination to pray; to suck <HI>the sincere</HI> milk of God's word! How carefully, by Christ, by his angels, and ministers, are they watched, guided, and guarded! If not hindered by their peevish temper, how quick is their spiritual growth, about the time of their heavenly birth! How innocent, meek, harmless, and humble they are; How candid and sincere in their faith; their love; their Chri∣stian profession, and holy obedience! Except, my soul thou become as a little child, thou shalt in no wise en∣ter into the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P N="17">17. They are called SONS; HEIRS; FIRST BORN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 4. 5. 6. Heb. xii. 23.</NOTE>. For a time indeed they continue in a low condition, and retain much of the Spirit of bondage; but solemnly are they separated to the service of God, as his peculiar pro∣perty. How bleeed are they with all the best blessings of his righteousness, his grace, and salvation. How princely and exalted is their dominion over the rest of the world! What a substantial blessing and honour are they to them. How sure and sweet is their title to the everlasting inheritance.—Rejoice, my soul, I am an heir of God, and joint heir with Christ: nor can sins, nor devils, nor wicked men, disinherit me. God is my Fa∣ther, my tutor, my ALL. His covenant is my charter; thrice surer than heaven or earth.</P>

How single their love to Jesus Christ! How chaste their adherence to him! How sound and uncor∣rupt in the faith! How sincere in their worship! How pure in their heart and life! How candid their care to avoid temptations to, and appearances of evil! How dis∣posed to blush at the best of their services!

have his image on them; are nearly connected with, dearly beloved, and tenderly cared, and provided for, by him. They are <HI>daughters of Jerusalem, children of Zion.</HI> In the true church, they are born; and by means of her ordinances and ministers, is their spiritual birth accom∣plished. On her spiritual provision of gospel-truths, and new-covenant blessings, they are nourished. With the garments of salvation, DIVinely granted to her, they are clothed. In her they abide; and are governed, di∣rected, protected, and perfected. If I am such, why should I wear the attire of an harlot? why whorishly turn aside by the flocks of thy companions?—When, O my Brother, shall I find thee without, on thy great white throne, that I may kiss thee, may embrace thee, and not be ashamed? When shall I come to the Jerusa∣lem above, <HI>which is the mother of us all?</HI> When shall we, the ransomed of the Lord, return and come to Zion, with songs, and everlasting joy on our heads, and sorrow and sighing flee away?</P>
<P N="19">19. They are CHILDREN OF PROMISE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 28.</NOTE>. From eternity their birth, their life, their endless felicity, was promised to our adored Redeemer. Not by natural in∣fluence, but by the gospel-promises and fulness thereof, are they spiritually begotten, born, suckled, nourished, directed, supported, carried, healed, revived, restored, comforted, and sanctified. And highly they esteem and delight in the promises.—Let these thy words be found by me; let me eat them; and let them be <HI>to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.</HI> Never let me <HI>forget thy statutes, for by them thou hast quickened me.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. They are called Christ's SEED, the TRAVAIL <HI>of his soul</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. liii. 11.</NOTE>. By his infinite labour and suffering, and from his fulness of virtue and grace, they are brought forth unto God. His honour they represent; his name they continue; and to all generations, they are the joy and rejoicing of his heart. On the very substance of his person, his flesh and blood, that he gives for the life of the world, he feeds and nourisheth their soul.—Lord Je∣sus, am I so dear to thee? am I the offspring of thy love; thy blood; thy grace? Detested then be my heart, if it love father, or mother, more than thee.</P>

21. Saints are called BRETHREN <HI>(c),</HI> In the same purpose of God, all of them are chosen. All of them have God for their Father; the church for their mo∣ther; Christ for their elder brother. Their grace, their profession, their practice, is similar. Their love is mu∣tual. They are <HI>Christ's brethren:</HI> they have one Fa∣ther with him. They are ineffably near to him, and precious in his sight. In so far as their finite nature ad∣mits, they share with him in his grace, his office, and work. How quickly, my Lord, shall I hear thee say, "Inasmuch as ye did it to the least of these my bre∣thren, you did it unto me."</P>
<P N="22">22. They are Christ's BRIDE and SPOUSE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John xx. 17.</NOTE>. In infinite kindness he chooseth them for himself. Hearti∣ly and deliberately they accept of him, as their head and husband. All their sinful debt was charged upon him; and he, by his obedience and sufferings, answered for it. Highly he loveth; faithfully he dwells in, tenderly he sympathizeth with; sufficiently he provides for; fully he protects them. How deep is his interest and con∣cern in their persons, graces, temptations, and troubles. How glorious is their interest in his person, his righte∣ous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, honour, and fulness. How highly they esteem; tenderly they love; ardently they desire; humbly they serve him; and hardly do they bear his frowns! How mutual is their joy and rejoicing over one another! How mindful are both of their marriage contract, the <HI>covenant of peace!</HI> By distinguished fellowship with him, they become fruitful in the works of righteousness. Openly, before angels and men, shall their nuptials, at the end, be celebrated. Then shall they enter into the palace of the King, and shall abide.

Receiving from God many noble endowments, time, ta∣lents, opportunities, how they rush into apostacy from him! and waste these gifts in soul-runing fellowship with Satan and his agents! When by trouble, and by sharp conviction, they are forced to consider their case; nothing spiritually good they have, or can do. No more pleasure in sin, or in creatures, can they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd. Now the most urgent necessity, accompained with an attractive persuasion of God's all-sufficiency and readi∣ness to help, determines them to attempt an humble return to him as their Saviour and Master, and a can∣did confession of their sin, and earnest supplication f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r mercy. How the all-gracious Father, his bowels of compassion, yearn towards them! How, in their distant, their lothsome, their dreadful condition, he in mercy runs to meet them! With what arms of mercy he em∣braceth them! with what kisses of forgiving love he melts their heart, and determines it to a truly gospel-repen∣tance, and confession of sin! By the ministry of the word and Spirit, how graciously he decks them with the <HI>best robe</HI> of imputed righteousness; adorns them with the <HI>gold-ring</HI> of his everlasting favour, Spirit, and grace; feasts and nourisheth their soul with the sweet, the ten∣der, the all-fattening flesh and blood of his sacrificed Son! What unending joy now commenceth among di∣vine persons and holy angels; that fallen men, utterly lost, as to safety, happiness, or usefulness, are recovered! those dead in trespasses and sins are quickened, and e∣spoused to Christ!</P>
<P N="24">24. Peevish saints much resemble the prodigal's EL∣DER BROTHER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 25.—31.</NOTE>. Being DIVinely preserved from the more scandalous crimes, and serving God from their youth, in a tender and unbleameable practice; how sin∣fully they sometimes fret at JEHOVAH'S sovereign con∣duct, in giving newly-converted profligates surprising measures of grace, surprisingly familiar intimacy with himself; while he rarely bestows on themselves, such sensible experience of his love, as exhilarates their heart,

and determines them with pleasure to talk of his good∣ness! Alas! ye froward, when will ye grow wise? should your eye be evil, because God is good? Do you well to be angry, that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound?"</P>
<P N="25">25. The saints are compared to JUDGES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 2. 3.</NOTE>. En∣dowed with wisdom, power, and authority, they set themselves for the defence of the heavenly statutes. By self examination they judge themselves, that they be not condemned with the world. By their sound prin∣cipals, and holy lives, they condemn the world that li∣eth in wickedness. At last they shall sit as assessors with Christ in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al judgment of evil angels and wicked men.—Shall this, Lord, be my honour, who have so often yielded to Satan, and defiled myself with his wicked agents on earth!</P>

Having <HI>tast∣ed that the Lord is gracious;</HI> having heard his voice, seen his glory, and his mighty deeds; they bear wit∣ness, that he is God all-sufficient, possessed of every per∣fection, and suited to every case. Having <HI>seen the Son,</HI> believed on him, and handled the word of life, they testify, that he is the DIVinely-sent, the able, the ever∣ready and compassionate Saviour of the world. Ha∣ving <HI>seen an end of all perfection,</HI> and felt the unsolidity and evil of the world, they declare, that "vanity of vanities, all that cometh is vanity and vexation of spi∣rit." Having felt their heart, and seen their life, they attest the former to be "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked;" and the latter, in its best estate, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilthy rags. Having felt the virtue of Jesus' word, they testify, that his "law is the truth; <HI>his gospel</HI> the power of God unto salvation; <HI>his</HI> commandment spiri∣tual, holy, just, and good." Faithfully they bear wit∣ness, even against themselves.

How liberally educa∣ted at his school, and taught to profit! How pompous their riding in his new-covenant chariot, on his <HI>white horses,</HI> his evangelical promises, and in company with him their KING! They indeed love to work righteous∣ness; but live not by their labours, but on God, as their inheritance, their portion; on the delicate provision of Jesus' fiesh and blood. How goodly their dwelling! the Most High is their habitation. How numerous their attendants; angels and men! How readily every thing works for their good! What burdens of labour, difficulty, and trouble, they can sustain, without being rendered wretched or miserable! How well they can forbear their full portion, till the end of time! How exalted their fellowship with DIVine persons; with an∣gels and saints! How the view of their wealth embold∣ens them to approach the throne of grace; the commu∣nion of saints; and the mansions of bli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s! and roughly to resist temptations from sin, Satan, and the world!—What am I, or what is my father's house, that God hath brought me hitherto; raised me out of the dung∣hill, and made me to sit with princes!</P>
<P N="28">28. They are called POOR or POOR IN SPIRIT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxviii. 10 Matth. v. 3.</NOTE>. Not only are they generally poor in worldly circumstan∣ces; and all, in themselves, destitute and despicable be∣fore God; but how unworthy, wretched, and polluted, in their own eyes! What students of contentment with a low condition in the world! With what humility, they look on all their righteousness as loss and dung; reckon themselves less than the least of all God's mercies; less than the least of all saints; and the chief of sinners! With what cheerful pleasure, they live solely on the free, the sovereign grace of God in Christ; and reckon it their great honour and happiness, to be the eternal dy∣vors thereof!—Let greedy swords fight on for wealth; I can be poor: but, Lord, I beg to sit, and sup, and smile with thee.</P>

<P N="30">30. They are compared to HARPERS <HI>harping with their harps,</HI> and singing a new song, which none but themselves can learn <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv. 2.</NOTE>. How skilfully; how sweetly they sing of mercy and judgment! Knowing that all things flow from redeeming love, and work for their eternal advantage; in ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y thing they give thanks. How cordially; how pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly they praise their loving, their eternal FAIR; their endless ALL; in sine, their GOD!—Am I redeemed; redeemed to him; redeemed with blood DIVine? O may I lose my useless tongue, when it forgets to praise!</P>
<P N="31">31. They are compared to MERCHANTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 46. Rev. iii. 18.</NOTE>. Christ the pearl of great price, the sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gold, the <HI>treasure hid in the field</HI> of revelation, they seek out, buy, deliberately accept of, as their own; the gift of God to them. The truth they buy; deliberately credit; and, at the hazard of every thing dear in a world, retain. The time they redeem, they carefully improve, because the days are evil. With wisdom, with care, with pleasure, with de∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and hope of endless advantage, they deal in spiritual and heavenly things. With knowledge and deliberation, they commission them by prayer; bring them home by faith; and receive them <HI>them with much affection, and joy of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Cheerfully they give their bill, their determined purpose, in his strength, to render unto God thanks for all his mercies. Grace, glory, God himself, in all his fulness, is the subject of their traffic. <HI>Freely, without money and without price,</HI> is the heaven fixed rate of every commodity. Christ is their factor in the far, the heavenly, country. Prayers and supplications, with strong cries and tears, are their letters of trade. Exceed∣ing great and precious promises are their invoice; their bill of lading. DIVine ordinances are the port, the
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
exchange, the market, where they carefully attend. Faith in the promise is the ship, the porter, which brings home their goods to their soul. A conscience purged in Jesus' blood is their accomptant. Their understand∣ing and memory are their journal and ledger. Self-ex∣amination is their inventory of their stock, their stating of accompts. Improving of grace received, in holy and beneficent exercises, is their sale. Carefully ought they to keep distinct records of the true state and frame of their soul, and of God's mercies to them, and their sins against him. Speedily ought they to pay their vows, their bills of gratitude. As their trade prospers or lan∣guisheth, they ought to rejoice, or mourn.—Learn, my soul, this gainful business; this trade, making many, making all its users rich; this trade, that can never be hurt by the number of sharers; this trade, for which dis∣appointments, straits, poverty, and guilt, may be im∣proved, as a qualification.</P>
<P N="32">32. They are compared to SOLDIERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—19.</NOTE>.

It is theirs to distinguish themselves from others; to moderate their affections and care about worldly things; to cease from their former sinful and legal labours; and, with singleness of heart, with pru∣dence, patience, submission, courage, care, and activity, to follow the Captain of their salvation in their respec∣tive stations; to know his word; without hesitation o∣bey his command; endure hardship; espy the strata∣gems, watch the motions of spiritual enemies; improve every advantage against them; shew no pity to any of them; but, by means of Jesus' death, believed with ap∣plication, resist Satan; crucify and kill the body of sin, with its affections and lusts.

<HI>be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;</HI> en∣courage yourselves in your leader; in the certainty of your victory; and the reward of your warfare.

<P N="33">33. They are compared to WATCHMEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxx. 5. 6. Prov. vi. 23.</NOTE>. In their respective towers and stations they wait upon, and watch <HI>for God, more than they that watch for the morning.</HI> Carefully they observe the approach of spiritual danger, and cry to the Lord for relief. It is yours, ye ransom∣ed, to watch unto prayer, and other duties; to wait, to prepare for, and lay hold on every opportunity there∣of; to watch in duty, keep your heart, in its disposi∣tion and aims, because <HI>out of it are the issues of life;</HI> and to watch for the answer of prayer, and fruit of good works. It is yours, to watch against the roaring lion, and his serpentine agents: to watch with Jesus as your Lord, your defence, pattern, companion, and guide: to watch for him, coming in the Spirit, and in the clouds; for blessed are they, <HI>whom, at his coming, he shall find watching.—</HI>Listen, my soul, the Master cometh; the Judge standeth at the door; gird up thy loins; watch and be sober: watch with him thy one hour of life: watch and pray, that thou enter not into temptation.</P>
<P N="34">34. They are compared to WRESTLERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 12.</NOTE>. Being anointed with the Holy Ghost, and sisted in the view of angels and men, they wrestle with profane persons, testifying against, and opposing their wickedness, and patiently enduring their reproach and persecution. They wrestle with persons heretical and erroneous; watching against their snares, refuting their error, and endea∣vouring to censure them on its account: They wrestle with evil angels, and sinful lusts: hating, resisting, cry∣ing

for deliverance from them, and studying to have every inward corruption utterly destroyed. In humble and earnest supplication, they wrestle with God: taking hold of his strength, pleading his promise, and relying on the blood and intercession of his Son, they insist for his favours, and refuse to let him go till he bless them.—Be thou, my soul, "strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus." Let no discouragement drive thee from his mercy-seat. Fill thy mouth with arguments, even with thy need, thy guilt, thy perversness; order thy cause before him.</P>
<P N="35">35. They are compared to WALKERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. x. 12.</NOTE>. Being DIVinely brought into Jesus <HI>the way of holiness,</HI> in which <HI>the way-faring man shall not err,</HI> in the sight, in the company, under the awe, and with a regard to the glory of God; in the continued application of a Re∣deemer's blood; in the strength of the grace daily re∣ceived out of his fulness; under the constraining power of his love; they,—with great pleasure and healthful∣ness, follow his pattern, obey his law, make progress in gospel-holiness, distance from sin, Satan, and an evil world, meetness for, and nearness to the celestial glory. Being brought at last into the mansions of happiness, they, with unceasing pleasure, peace, purity, honour and triumph, for ever attend the Lamb of God, in all his glorious discoveries of himself.—My soul, having "re∣ceived the Lord Jesus, walk in him; walk up and down in his name; walk humbly with thy God;" at last thou shalt <HI>walk with him in white;</HI> for in him thou art worthy.</P>

To succeed, my soul, be∣gin it, as early as possible. Put on the light, the pliant robes of Jesus' righteousness and grace.

evil heart of unbelief and thy predominant lusts. Be∣ware of "surfeiting and drunkenness; be not high∣minded, but fear." Ever fix thine eye on Jesus as thy way, thy pattern; on his law as thy rule; on his Spi∣rit as thy guide; on death as thy goal; on endless fe∣licity as thy prize. Stumble at no temptation, afflic∣tion, reproach, presecution, desertion, or inward weak∣ness; but with integrity, vigour, and unwearied dili∣gence, proceed in thy course; daily apply a Saviour's blood; <HI>grow in grace; abound in the work of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="37">37. They are compared to PILGRIMS or TRAVEL∣LERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 10.</NOTE>. Finding no rest for their soul on earth, they, at first, carefully consider the cost, the difficulty, the danger of their journey to heaven; wisely they put on the light, the new, the defensive, and unwasting <HI>gar∣ments of salvation;</HI> and take to them the <HI>whole armour of God,</HI> for their safety against foes. Wisely they re∣ceive Jesus and his fulness, as their gold, their treasure, to bear their expence. They receive his Father for their companion; his Spirit to be their guide; his word to be their director and compass; his love, his power, and pro∣mise, for their supporting staff. Carefully they ask for the <HI>good old way</HI> of holiness; and continue walking there∣in: sweetly they drink out of its <HI>wells of salvation;</HI> and refresh themselves, but not tarry in the inns of ordinances built thereupon. How DIVersified is their condition! Now, their duty is pleasant and easy; anon, it is rugged and difficult. Now, they enjoy fine weather of peace and prosperity; clear views of Jesus countenance, wide prospects of his loveliness and love; clear discoveries of the vanity of this world, of the happiness of their pre∣sent, and of the glory of their future state: anon, they are distressed with cold winters of trouble, storms of temp∣tation, dark nights of desertion and disorder, that they know not what to do, or whither to go. How often fearfully pinched for provision! How often the wells of promises seem dry, and inns of ordinances are found em∣pty! How often are they exposed to the gazing, ridi∣cule, and malice of carnal men! How often, by Satan and their lusts, harassed and robbed of their grace, or its evidence! How often tempted to turn back! But,

through every tribulation, they push forward to the city, the celestial kingdom, of God; and with so much more cheerfulness, if they enjoy the company of emi∣nent saints.—May I "go from strength to strength, <HI>till I</HI> appear before God in Zion."</P>
<P N="38">38. They are called STRANGERS and SOJOURNERS with God on earth <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix. 12.</NOTE>. How strange to carnal men, is their state of union and communion with Christ! How strange their birth from above! their having God their Father! Christ their husband! glorified saints their prin∣cipal people! In what strange; what celestial country, are their portion, their inheritance, their hopes, their affections, their thoughts, their desires! With what strange robes of DIVine righteousness, implanted grace, and gospel-holiness, they are decked! What strange ar∣mour of God they have put on! How strangely they speak the spiritual language of prayer and praise! pour out their hearts, behave as becometh the <HI>high calling of God!</HI> walk with Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whom the world see and know not! feed on the strange pro∣vision of Jesus' person, righteousness, and benefits! How employed in the much-unknown labour of numbering their days; of considering their last end; of ploughing up the fallow-ground of their heart; of sowing to them∣selves in righteousness; of buying without money and without price; of denying and loathing themselves; of warring with principalities, powers, and spiritual wick∣edness; of renouncing the profit, pleasure, and honour of this world; of extracting good from evil, and sweet out of bitter; of loving their mankind-enemies, and rendering them blessing for cursing! How unsatisfac∣tory their outward enjoyments! What a <HI>gazing stock</HI> to the men of this world! And how despised, reproached, and harassed by them!—Be content, my soul, it is e∣nough that God hath sworn, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." In all, my straits, he is a present help. In all my affliction he is afflicted, so he is my Saviour.</P>
<P N="39">39. They are called BUILDERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jude 20.</NOTE>. According to the rule and line of God's inspired word, they, by faith, lay themselves and their whole salvation upon Christ,
<PB N="160" REF="164"/>
the foundation laid in Zion; and in his strength, build up themselves, in their most holy faith and gospel con∣versation; adding one degree of grace, one good word and work to another: and build up the church, by elu∣cidating DIVine truths; winning souls to Christ; spread∣ing abroad the savour of his name; and lifting up his praise.—So build, my soul, and thou shalt be able to finish.</P>
<P N="40">40. They are compared to THRESHERS, or THRESH∣ING INSTRUMENTS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xli. 15. 16.</NOTE>. In Jesus' strength, and by re∣peated acts of faith and hope, of repeutance and love, of humility and self-denial, they, <HI>by little and little,</HI> con∣quer their spiritual enemies, and bring down <HI>the moun∣tains</HI> of wicked men, evil angels, sinful corruptions, ma∣nifold dangers and difficulties, which stand in their way of serving the Lord, or enjoying fellowship with him. Astonishing! shall <HI>worm I</HI> beat them small as dust? Let me then <HI>rejoice in the Lord,</HI> and <HI>glory in the holy One of Israel.</HI></P>
<P N="41">41. They are compared to STEWARDS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 9.—12</NOTE>. To their peculiar care hath God committed the vineyard of their own heart, and station in the world and church. A va∣riety of gifts, graces, ordinances, and opportunities hath he bestowed upon them, to be improven according to the rule of his word. Solemnly hath he charged them to be faithful, and to study the welfare of others; quick∣ly he will call them to account for their conduct; and righteously will he reward them according to their works.—How quickly, my soul, shall he cause me <HI>give an account of</HI> my <HI>stewardship; for</HI> I <HI>must be no longer steward!</HI> Are all my accounts clear, and balanced with Jesus' blood?</P>
<P N="42">42. They are compared to SERVANTS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. vii. 3.</NOTE>. How so∣lemnly are they engaged! How deeply obliged to serve the Lord Christ, in whatsoever he shall command them! With what lowliness of mind, what faithfulness, grati∣tude, and evangelical <HI>respect to the recompence of reward,</HI> are they to do the will of God in all things! It is yours, ye redeemed, to remember that all your gifts, your graces, are from God, and to be used to his glory; and to resolve upon giving him an account thereof.—Bore

<P N="43">43. They are called INHABITANTS OF THE GAR∣DENS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 13.</NOTE>. Being associated into particular congrega∣tions and worshipping assemblies, they make an open, a continued, a stedfast profession of Jesus' truth; and with constancy, delight, and diligence, they attend upon, and improve his ordinances; and are chiefly busied in keep∣ing and cultivating their heart and conversation.</P>
<P N="44">44. They are compared to FARMERS OF VINE∣YARDS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 12.</NOTE>. To them hath God, in a subordinate re∣spect, committed the vineyard of their own heart and of his church; and to their advantage the fruitfulness there∣of greatly redounds. It is therefore theirs, carefully to keep their vineyard; to watch over themselves and their work; to labour earnestly, in denying ungodliness and worldly lusts; and in living soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. It is theirs to study regu∣larity and distinctness in their religious course. It is theirs to improve every event, every faculty, and gift; to prune off every luxuriance, mortify every lust, avoid every doubtful and dangerous practice; and by a belie∣ving dependence on the tree of life, in the midst of the paradise of God, to prop every good word and work. It is theirs to promote the purity, peace, and prosperi∣ty of the church, and to render unto Christ, the princi∣pal, the supreme glory of all they are, and do:</P>
<P N="45">45. Saints are compared to SLAVISH KEEPERS of other mens vineyards, to the neglect of their own <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 5.</NOTE>. How often are they, by their mother's children, their indwell∣ing corruptions, and hypocritical professors, forced and decoyed into a base submission to human impositions, in the service of God; to sinful and carnal courses; to too eager interfering with worldly affairs, or with spiritual things in a selfish and carnal manner! How often, is their watchfulness over their heart, their resisting and mortifying of their lusts, their due cherishing and exer∣cising of their grace, hereby sinfully and shamefully pre∣vented! How often doth their being in public office, in

church or state, occasion much sinful neglect of personal piety!</P>
<P N="46">46. They are represented as CARRIED ones <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xlvi. 3. 4.</NOTE>. Being lame in themselves, Jesus apprehends them, takes them up, and in the chariot of his covenant and church, and on the white horse of his gospel-promise, and in the hand of his providence, and on the shoulder of his pow∣er, and in his bosom of intimate fellowship, and in his heart of endeared affection and care, notwithstanding their manifold filthiness, provocations, and infirmities, bears them <HI>up</HI> under every burden; bears them <HI>out</HI> a∣gainst every opposition; bears them <HI>on</HI> in the course of their duty; bears them <HI>in</HI> to the throne of grace; and <HI>home</HI> to their eternal rest.</P>
<P N="47">47. They are represented as HIDDEN ones <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxiii. 3.</NOTE>. How unknown to the world, and even to themselves, is their excellency; their gracious state; their spiritual attain∣ments: and especially their future glory! How hid∣den,—how secret favours, are their election, their rege∣neration, their pardon, acceptance, adoption, and in∣ward comfort! How secretly; how mysteriously and safely are their persons, their state, their life, their por∣tion, and treasure, laid up in the word, the heart, the hand, the life, the honour of Christ, and of God in him!</P>
<P N="48">48. They are represented as SEALED ones <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. vii. 3.</NOTE>. By electing love, by effectual calling, by their justification, and by the daily influence of his Spirit, they are highly honoured of God, and appropriated and confirmed to his use; and distinguished from the world. Safely hid and <HI>preserved in Christ Jesus,</HI> how graciously are they enabled to make an open confession of his truth! How often protected from common calamities! How marvel∣lously saved amidst eminent troubles!</P>
<P N="49">49. They are called UPRIGHT ones <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song i. 4.</NOTE>. How their heart, their affections, tower towards God, and heaven∣ly things! With what candour they study to be what they seem! and to live without allowed guile! to be universally sincere in their behaviour towards God and men!</P>
<P N="50">50. They are called WISE MEN <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Psal. xciv. 8. 12.</NOTE>. Being instruct∣ed
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
by Christ, they make the best choice, choose for their portion the whole fulness of God; pursue the best course, follow after <HI>the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</HI> They walk in Christ, the best way; and with God, the most excellent companion. They espouse Christ the best husband; and live on his flesh and blood, the most wholesome and nourishing provision. Being acquainted with the mysteries of God's word and provi∣dence, taught of God <HI>to profit,</HI> made <HI>wise unto salvation,</HI> and <HI>learned in every state therewith to be content,</HI> they intend the most noble end of his glory, and their own happiness; and prosecute it in the best manner, and by the most proper means.—Hast thou, my soul, <HI>so learned Christ?</HI></P>
<P N="51">51. They are compared to STRONG men <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 10.</NOTE>. Being strengthened in and by the Lord Jesus, they can bear heavy burdens without repining; can walk in God's way without wearying; run in the path of his com∣mandments without fainting: can attack and conquer the strongest corruptions; resist the devil; overcome the world; and bear rule over their own spirit.—Rejoice, my soul, <HI>I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.</HI></P>
<P N="52">52. They are represented as CARNAL men <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 14.</NOTE>. Alas! what power hath their remaining carnal corruption over them! How much they fulfil their sinful lust! How compassed with fleshly infirmities! How sadly are their hearts attached to worldly things! What envy, strife, and contention, too often abound with them!—Truly <HI>the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</HI></P>
<P N="53">53. They are represented as FOOLISH <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 25.</NOTE>. Alas! how often they mistake their way; neglect their duty; act contrary to God's honour, and their own interest; grieve their friends, and please their enemies! How of∣ten they act without thought; complain of, or praise, what they know not! How often have I been brayed in the mortar of adversity; yet hath not my foolishness departed from me!</P>
<P N="54">54. They are represented as CAPTIVES, <HI>sold under sin</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 23. 24.</NOTE>. How often do Satan, and their lusts, prevail
<PB N="164" REF="168"/>
over them; drag them from God and their duty, and into the slavish service of sin! How they buffet them for the least refusal! How they abuse and maltreat their soul!—Blessed be the Lord, who bringeth back his cap∣tives, even when, with stupidity and unconcern, they are like men that dream. Quickly, O my soul, shall the <HI>prey be taken from the mighty,</HI> and <HI>the lawful captive be delivered.</HI></P>
<P N="55">55. They are represented as PRISONERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxlii. 6.</NOTE>. How often are they shut up and confined in the prison of trouble; of prevailing corruption; of fearful tempta∣tion; of dark desertion! How are their shameful crimes evidenced; and their souls connected with the basest companions! How are their light, their liberty, their honour, their happy fellowship, their spiritual warmth and comfort taken from them! Is it not thine, O Jesus, to bid us go forth and shew ourselves? Is it not thine, with the key of thy promise, and by the power of thy grace, to open our prison-doors, and bring us forth, that we may glorify thy name?</P>
<P N="56">56. They are compared to KILLED and CRUCIFIED men <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 17. 36.</NOTE>. O the killing providences! the destructive, rage of inward corruption! the violent temptations of Satan! the persecutions of the world, with which they are trysted! They are <HI>crucified with Christ;</HI> in his death he represented them; and by the application of his a∣tonement to their conscience, is their old man, their in∣ward corruption, gradually and painfully mortified. They are <HI>crucified to the world,</HI> and it to them. Gra∣dually, and not without paln and shame, are they weaned from the world as a portion, or any necessary part of it, and as dead malefactors are they despised by the men of it.</P>
<P N="57">57. They are compared to DYING and DEAD men <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 4. 6.</NOTE>. Not only are they worthless in themselves, mortal in their bodies, and plagued with an inward body of death; but by the application of Jesus' righteousness and grace, their relations to the broken law, as an husband and go∣vernour; to Satan, as a prince and father; to sin, as a pleasure and trade; and to the world, as a portion and treasure; are destroyed, and finally cut off. Hence they cease from sinful works; and from going about to esta∣blish
<PB N="165" REF="169"/>
their own righteousness: and are <HI>buried together with Christ;</HI> share the sweet repose that flows from his death; in consequence whereof they rise to newness of life.</P>
<P N="58">58. They are represented as LIVING men <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE>. O the mysterious inward motions of their heart! O their agreeable breathing and desiring after Christ, and living by faith on him! O the sweet light, liberty, pleasure, and other enjoyments of which they are made capable! How manifold their frames! How various their relations to Christ and to one another! And how they work out their salvation with fear and trembling!—Lord, may I live and praise thee.</P>
<P N="59">59. They are called a REMNANT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xi. 16.</NOTE>. How few in comparison of the rest of mankind! How often they chiefly consist of the poor and dregs thereof! How often are they wonderfully preserved, when the wicked are cut off!</P>
<P N="60">60. They resemble ISSAC <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 28.</NOTE>. They are the spiri∣tual, the promised seed of Abraham; the special, the distinguished seed of Heaven, the offspring of Jesus' in∣tercession. By means of the promise, and notwithstand∣ing insuperable-like difficulties, they are spiritually con∣ceived and born. How delightful a joy and rejoicing to God their Father, and to their mother the church! Be∣ing mercifully recovered from death, by the slaughter of God's provided burnt-offering, they love not their lives in opposition to his will. How fadly harassed by their bastard brethren! But being heirs, they at last enter in to possess <HI>all the fulness of God.</HI></P>
<P N="61">61. They are compared to JACOB <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Zech. xii. 8.</NOTE>. Being freely chosen to salvation, they <HI>strive to enter in at the strait gate</HI> of union to Christ, and renovation of their nature; and struggle for glory, honour, immortality, eternal life. Being blessed in the robes of Christ, their elder brother's imputed righteousness; guarded of angels; highly e∣steeming their spiritual birthright and blessing; they wrestle with God, and also prevail: and through mani∣fold tribulation and death, go to the everlasting land of promise.—Call thyself, even now, my soul, by the name

of Jacob: subscribe with thine hand unto the Lord; and sirname thyself, by the name of Israel.</P>
<P N="62">62. They are compared to DAVID <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xliv. 5</NOTE>. Being ex∣alted from the lowest degree, they sit with <HI>the Prince of the kings of the earth.</HI> Wisely they conduct themselves: though striplings and weak in themselves, they are <HI>strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;</HI> and notwith∣standing fearful guilt, and difficulties innumerable, they are <HI>more than conquerors through him that loved</HI> them.</P>
<P N="63">63. They are like unto LAZARUS in the para∣ble <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 19.—26.</NOTE>. How generally poor and contemptible, in the view of the great men of the world! How often the bru∣tal creation work together for their good! At death, how readily angels convey their souls to the heavenly mansions, where the damned inhabitants of hell have access to know their glory, and fruitlessly wish the least share of it!</P>
<P N="64">64. They compare themselves to BEASTS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxiii. 20.</NOTE>. For, O the stupidity, earthliness, filthiness, perverseness, mis∣chievousness, unsightliness, which they discern in them∣selves!—Lord, what a monstrous beast, a wretched system of beasts, am I before thee! "Nevertheless I am con∣tinually with thee; thou holdest me by my right hand: thou wilt guide me with thy counsel while here, and afterward bring me to <HI>thy</HI> glory." O let thy robes of salvation remove my unsightliness; thy blood wash out my filthiness; thy instruction remove my ignorance and folly; thy Spirit undo my earthliness and carnality; thy love shed abroad in my heart, root out my stub∣bornness and malice!</P>
<P N="65">65. They are compared to FOWLS OR BIRDS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ezek xvii. 23. Song. ii. 12.</NOTE>. How DIVersified are their cases and frames! The conversation of some, how tender and comely! Of others, ah, how carnal and unsightly! How, being supported by the air, the influence of the Holy Ghost, they mount and move among heavenly things! How exposed to storms and wants! By what amazing instinct, they take up, and return to, their rest in the person, the offices, relations, righteousness, and love of Christ, the <HI>tree of lise,</HI> the <HI>unconsumed bush,</HI> and the <HI>rock of ages!</HI> Under the sha∣dow
<PB N="167" REF="171"/>
of his protection and promise, how sweetly they sometimes sing!—O when shall the sweet singing of birds, the ransomeds full concert, of <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> and <HI>Ho∣sannas,</HI> come!</P>
<P N="66">66. They are compared to EAGLES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xl. 31. Psal. ciii. 5.</NOTE>. How glo∣rious; how royal their spiritual dignity among men! How solid their knowledge of the most dazzling, the most deep, and distant things! Renewing their strength and beauty after spiritual decays, and carried by Jesus their parent, how unweariedly, on wings of faith, of love, and holy desire, they mount up towards God; comfort themselves in him; make him, <HI>the munition of rocks,</HI> their habitation, from whence they overlook clouds and storms of trouble! How earnestly they espy and desire the presence, and feed on the slain Lamb of God! grovel no more, my soul; arise fly away to Je∣sus, to the crag of <HI>the Rock which is higher than I.</HI></P>
<P N="67">67. They are compared to DOVES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. lx. 8.</NOTE>. How weak and timorous in themselves! but being justified in Jesus' righteousness, and sanctified by his grace, how comely! How pure in their new nature and spiritual feeding! How harmless, loving, and affectionate! How chaste their desire toward Christ! How fruitful in good works! How great their delight in fellowship with him, and his people! How tenderly they weep over his death! How inconsolably thy mourn for his absence! How diligent∣ly they endeavour to gain others to his cause! How swift; how high; how heavenly, their motions of faith, love, and holy conversation! how sweet; how safe their abode in the <HI>secret place</HI> of Jesus' purpose, pro∣mise, righteousness, power, and love! How they fly to him in every time of danger!—May my life, my last end, be like theirs! May I be "a dove in the valley, mourning for mine iniquities."</P>
<P N="68">68. They compare themselves to OWLS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. cii. 6.</NOTE>: because of their uncomeliness in themselves; their love to dark∣ness; their mournful and unpleasant cries; and because they are so forsaken, contemned, and hated by others in the world.—On earth, Lord, am not I as <HI>a pelican of the wilderness, and owl of the desert?</HI> O when shall

<P N="70">70. They compare themselves to chattering CRANES and SWALLOWS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxxviii. 14.</NOTE>. How mournful their lamentati∣ons! How broken their notes of praise! How strange∣ly varied their speech! Sometimes like <HI>cranes</HI> they roar; anon like <HI>swallows</HI> they peep, and speak as it were out of the dust.—Lord, who knowest my brutal language, my whisper, my roaring, let my groans, my cries, <HI>come up with acceptance on</HI> thine <HI>altar;</HI> for how can I sing thy song in a foreign land!</P>
<P N="71">71. Saints are compared to CHICKENS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiii. 37.</NOTE>. How weak and insufficient in themselves! How exposed to danger, contempt, treading down, and destruction! But, how kindly called, warmed, comforted, protected, and provided for, by the Son of God! How sagaci∣ously they discern his voice, and follow him! How sweetly they eat and drink out of his fulness! and lift up their heads and hearts in his praise!</P>
<P N="72">72. They are compared to LIONS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mic. v. 8. Prov. xxviii. 1.</NOTE>. How great their influence in the world; their spiritual royalty; their strength; their boldness and courage; and their conquest of sin, Satan, and the world! How eminent their gratitude, and their mutual affection! How com∣passionate to penitent and submissive sinners! And how often dreadful to the spirits of wicked men!—Invested with thy righteousness, O Jesus, let me towards God, angels, and men, be "bold as a lion, that turneth not away for any: let me tear the arm, and the crown of the head," of every indwelling lust and sinful practice.</P>
<P N="73">73. They are compared to a COMPANY OF HORSES <HI>in Pharaoh's chariots</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song i. 9.</NOTE>. Being chosen from among men, to everlasting honour and happiness, they are bought with the infinite price of Jesus' blood; they feed on the <HI>fruit of the earth,</HI> the finest of the wheat; on his

How comely; how stately; majestic; strong; courageous; and esteemed of their Lord! How tamed, and broken in heart, by his Spirit! In the easy yoke of his law; in the chariot of his church; and with the bands of his love; how beautifully and regularly yoked together! And with what order, harmony, cheerful alertness, and speed, do they honour him; running a race of holy obedience, fighting his battles with Satan and their corruptions; and being the means to spread his fame, and enlarge his conquests on earth! Art thou, my soul, the Lord's <HI>good∣ly horse in the battle?</HI></P>
<P N="74">74. They are compared to HARTS or HINDS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlii. 1. and xviii. 33.</NOTE>. In their new man, how pure, lovely, pleasant, loving, and grateful! How exposed to danger and trouble! How inveterate the enmity between them and the old serpent, and his seed! How fearfully these fasten upon their soul, amidst carnality, and spiritual sloth and deadness! And how hardly they get rid of them! When hunted by these persecutors, how ardent is their desire of spiritual refreshment from Jesus' fountain of life! In his strength, and as swiftened by his grace, how gloriously they over∣leap, and overcome every tribulation, every difficulty! How JEHOVAH'S voice assists them in bringing forth their good works, and young converts!</P>
<P N="75">75. They are compared to OXEN and CALVES, <HI>fatted in the stall;</HI> or <HI>of the yoke</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mal. iv. 2.</NOTE>.

Shine forth, O <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> on my soul: so shall I grow up, be fat, and full of sap; and ay be flourishin.</P>
<P N="76">76. They are called Christ's SHEEP and LAMBS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 15. 16.</NOTE>. Being chosen, purchased, formed, fed, and owned by

How they know and obey Christ's voice! rest under his shadow, in the noon-tide of trouble! follow his ex∣ample! mutually love, and, in the fold of his church and worshipping assemblies, associate together! And how fruitful in good works! and in winning others to him! How exposed to danger, diseases, and storms! How apt, of themselves, to feed on the rot-grass of sinful corrup∣tions, and carnal enjoyments! How apt to follow bad example, and go astray from the pastures, and paths of their great Shepherd!—Lord, give to me eternal life; and suffer none to pluck me out of thy hand.</P>
<P N="77">77. They are compared to LOST SHEEP RECOVER∣ED <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 4.—7. Psal. cxix. 176.</NOTE>. Finding them by nature afar off, and wander∣ing from God on mountains of iniquity, of vanity, and worldly enjoyments, Jesus, by the conviction and illu∣mination of his word and Spirit, seeks them out, lays them on the shoulders of his power and love, and with great joy, brings them into his new-covenant state. When afterward they wander into sins and snares, he sends forth his light and his truth, to find out, lead, and bring them back. By repeated reproofs, corrections, convictions, and displays of his glory, he seeks them out and apprehends them; and in his arms of mercy, and bosom of love, he bears them home to himself; and at last to the mansions of bliss.—Lord, when I have wan∣dered till I know not where to find myself, do thou seek and find me; recover, lead, bear, and carry me.</P>

And how useful and medicinal to men is their holy con∣versation!</P>
<P N="79">79. Young saints are likened to KIDS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 8.</NOTE>.

<P N="80">80. They compare themselves to DOGS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 27.</NOTE>.

<P N="81">81. They are required to be wise as SERPENTS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. x. 16.</NOTE>.

<P N="132">132. They are compared to SALT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 13.</NOTE>. Being inte∣rested in the everlasting covenant of salt, they have the perpetual, incorruptible, and purifying word and grace of God, in their heart. They are a vexation, and un∣easy burden to wicked men; but an useful mean of pre∣serving nations and churches, from universal corruption and ruin.</P>
<P N="133">133. They are the SUBSTANCE <HI>of a land</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. vi. 13</NOTE>. They alone, are therein valuable.

<P N="134">134. They are like unto PURPLE HAIRS on the head <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 1. and vii. 5.</NOTE>. They are weak and insignificant in themselves, ready to be tossed to and fro; but being deep rooted in Jesus, the head of the church, they derive their security and nou∣rishment from him; are carefully preserved by him; and rendered an ornament to him, and to his body the church. Being DIVinely washed in his purple blood;

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Metaphors respecting wicked men.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WICKED men are called DEVILS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John vi. 70.</NOTE>. Having fallen from their first estate, they are become false accusers of God and his people; malicious, constant, and cruel enemies to them. How they delight to do evil! to lie, murder, and to the utmost of their power, tempt others to sin! How forsaken, and abhorred of God! How fast ripening for everlasting punishment!—How justly, Lord, mayst thou address me; "Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou favourest not the things that be of God; but the things that be of men!"</P>
<P N="2">2. They are compared to a HUMAN BODY. Their <HI>head</HI> denotes their power and authority.

<P N="3">3. Wicked men are called CHILDREN <HI>of the devil, of disobedience, of wrath</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John viii. 44. Eph. ii. 2. 3.</NOTE>. By Satan's agency they be∣came sinners, and daily wax more and more sinful. In the wickedness of their heart and practice, they bear his express image: cheerfully they obey his will: readi∣ly they imitate his example: greatly they delight to enjoy fellowship with him, in his temptations. Alas how they are filled with, and given to disobedience, to wrath, and emnity against God! And how condemned to, and infeoffed heirs of everlasting punishment!—Was I such? and hath grace made me "a child, <HI>an</HI> heir of God, <HI>and</HI> joint heir with Christ!"</P>
<P N="4">4. They are represented as the SOLDIERS <HI>and angels</HI> of Satan <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 7.</NOTE>. Enlisted under his banner, by voluntary consent to his service; wearing his livery of sinful prac∣tices; equipt with his armour of ignorance, enmity, and manifold lusts; they, at his direction, to the everlasting hazard of their soul, fight against the strivings of God's Spirit, in their conscience; and with deceit and violence oppose, persecute, and seek to ruin his cause and interest in the earth; and have for their present wages, the pro∣fits and <HI>pleasures os sin,</HI> which are but <HI>for a season;</HI> and hereafter everlasting punishment, with the devil and his

<P N="5">5. They are represented as HUNTERS and FOWL∣ERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. With the outmost vanity, craft, and cruelty, they tempt and force one another, into sinful, into soul∣ruining courses. How often they wickedly undermine their neighbour's character, property, station, or life! How they hunt and persecute the people of God!</P>
<P N="6">6. They are represented as MURDERERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. By sin they destroy themselves: they ruin their friends and neighbours; they attempt to assassinate their maker: many of them <HI>crucify the Son of God afresh.</HI> nor, with∣out shedding of his blood for, and application of it to them, can their sin be forgiven.—How, Lord, hast thou apprehended me, thy <HI>betrayer and murderer,</HI> and washed me from my sins in thy blood! How kind my remission! <HI>Grace, grace, unto it!</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. They are represented as LIARS and DECEI∣VERS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. How <HI>deceitful above all things,</HI> is their heart! How early they <HI>go astray speaking lies!</HI> How they de∣light in, and promote false temptations, and errors; "sporting themselves with their own deceivings!" With what vain hopes, and empty shadows of virtue, they be∣guile themselves and others!

<P N="8">8. They are compared to DRUNKARDS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. With what care, desire, and delight, they seek after the plea∣sures of sin; embrace every opportunity to obtain them; and count nothing, no not the salvation of their soul, too dear a price, to purchase them! How often, after being sensibly hurt thereby, or pained with inward ter∣ror and conviction on their account, do they, as greedi∣ly as ever, return to their sinful course! How vainly merry! How stupid, outr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gious, and careless, about their great business, they are thus rendered!</P>

contrary to the natural dictates of conscience, they burn in "the lusts of the flesh, and of the mind;" abuse themselves with the vilest whoredom and departure from God; and draw on themselves his tremendous and fiery vengeance.—Ah! how long, hath my life been among the UNCLEAN!</P>
<P N="10">10. They are compared to THEIEVS and ROBBERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 8. 9.</NOTE>. How craftily, cruelly, and shamelessly, though often secret∣ly they waste their time and strength; and risk their eter∣nal savation, in robbing God of his due honour, love, esteem, worship, reverence, and time; in depriving their neighbours of their due regard and property; and them∣selves of their solid happiness and comfort! And how dreadfully are they taken at last, arraigned, condemn∣ed, imprisoned, and tormented in hell!</P>
<P N="11">11. They, chiefly hypocrites, are called BASTARDS and MOTHERS CHILDREN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 6. Song. i. 6.</NOTE>. Though they be the children of God by creation and common providence; or by outward profession; they are not born from above They have no indwelling principle of faith in, or love to God; nothing of his moral image in them. Only from▪ a principle of slavish fear or legal hope, do all their ap∣pearances of obedience proceed. They hate the true children of God, and are without all title to the promised inheritance of everlasting felicity. Hypocrites are child∣ren of the church, but not of Christ the husband thereof.</P>
<P N="12">12. They are represented as PRODIGALS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 10.—16.</NOTE>. How quickly; how sinfully; how unreasonably, they waste their time, their talents and opportunities, to the abo∣minable purposes of dishonouring God, of defiling their neighbour, and of ruining their soul! And so at, or before death, reduce themselves to terrible straits and inward torments; and not seldom to outward misery and want! Ah, amidst these pinches, to what slavish service of Satan, to feed his swinish lusts, have I hired myself! But blessed be the Lord, who made me outrun my service; and fly to his offended, but gracious self, as my sole relief.</P>
<P N="13">13. They are represented as FOOLS and SIMPLE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 22.</NOTE>. They have no true knowledge to direct their course;
<PB N="190" REF="194"/>
they hate it, and despise the means of it: they prefer the husks, the dung, the dust, the spider's web, the wind of self-righteousness, of sinful pleasure and worldly enjoyments, to God, to Christ, to his righteousness, grace, and glory. They heartily mock at sin; at eve∣ry thing of eternal moment; and ridicule what they know not. Readily they fret at every thing like to be truly useful to them: thoughtlessly they go on in their course; they prefer their body to their soul, time to e∣ternity; and choose to provoke and dishonour God ra∣ther than man: headlessly they ensnare themselves in Satan's temptations; and, to avoid momentary fancied evils, rush into infinite and everlasting misery.</P>
<P N="14">14. They are represented as MAD, and POSSESSED of the devil <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 17. Matth. xii. 43.</NOTE>. In their heart, Satan and his angels re∣side, and render them <HI>deaf,</HI> incapable to hear God's voice in his word and providence; <HI>dumb,</HI> unfit to pray to, and praise God; <HI>outragious</HI> scoffers and despisers of DIVine things; rebels against God, their best friend; rejecters of his righteousness and salvation; furious ha∣ters of such as would instruct and admonish them; em∣ployed, in wounding and murdering their own souls, and these of others; and in improving Christ and the gos∣pel, as occasions of their deeper damnation.—Lord, <HI>my name is</HI> LEGION; but do thou, with authority, com∣mand the unclean spirits to come out.</P>
<P N="15">15. They are represented as POOR and WRETCH∣ED <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 17.</NOTE>. By sin they have lost every thing good: they have no spiritual provision of their own, to live upon: no money of good qualities or works, to procure any: no robe of righteousness to cover them: no habitation to yield them a residence, or shelter from the storm of God's wrath: no true friend in the creation, to assist or comfort them: they owe infinite debt, and have nothing to pay it: they are polluted and mischievous; cannot cease from sin: nor are they one moment unexposed to inexpressible and endless wo.—Astonishing "grace of our Lord Jesus, that though he was rich, yet, for our sakes, he became poor; that we through his poverty might become rich!"</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="191" REF="195"/>
16. They are represented as DEBTORS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 24.</NOTE>. Never do, nor can they, in the least degree, render unto God, the debt of perfect obedience, which they owe to his law; nor even the debt of gratitude which they owe, for his mercies; hereby they fall under a debt of infinite satis∣faction to his offended justice. Ah! how they deny, excuse, or extenuate their debt! How they hate their all-glorious Creditor! How they abhor; how they study to shift, and forget, their account; and the future, the solemn, seasons of reckoning; their death; their eternal judgment! How ready every moment to be clapt up in the prison of hell! And yet, alas! how merciless to those who injure them!—Lord, hast thou forgiven me <HI>ten thou∣sand talents!</HI> shall not I love thee much! And for thy sake love, and do good to, such men as hate and injure me.</P>
<P N="17">17. They are represented as WEAK and WITHOUT STRENGTH <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6.</NOTE>. They cannot think a good thought; cannot speak a gracious word; nor perform an accept∣able deed: they cannot work out their own happiness: they cannot cry, nor breathe, nor look to Jesus, for his purchased salvation: they cannot take hold of his strength, and make peace with him: they cannot receive it, when offered, nor even cease from rejecting it: in fine, they cannot cease to do evil, or learn to do well. Lord, without thee, I can do nothing; let my suffici∣ency be of God.</P>
<P N="18">18. They are represented as BLIND <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 17.</NOTE>. They see not the <HI>light of life;</HI> discern not the <HI>Sun of righteous∣ness;</HI> have no true knowledge of spiritual objects: no∣thing is nearer them than God and his unspeakable gift, and there own heart; yet nothing is less known to them. Ah, how often they stumble and fall into sin, without any proper cause! How constantly they wander out of their proper course, and mislead those that follow them! How useless is the clearest dispensation of the gospel to them! How utterly destitute are they of all true com∣fort! How often given up to judicial and eternal dark∣ness!—Lord, open thou mine eyes, that I may see won∣drous things out of thy law.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="192" REF="196"/>
19. They are represented as NAKED <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 17. 18.</NOTE>. They have no law-fulfilling righteousness, to cover them before God; no inward grace; no holy conversation to adorn them; no spiritual armour to defend themselves from their foes. Hence, how perpetually exposed to the cold, the tempest, the stroke of DIVine wrath! to the stings of their own conscience! to the injuries of sin, of sinners, of devils, and death! How shamefully the filthiness of their heart daily discovers itself in their practice! How unfit they are for every holy duty; for every honourable company!—When I was thus naked, how, Lord, didst thou array me in "fine linen, clean and white, which is the righteousness of the saiuts!</P>
<P N="20">20. They are represented as SLOTHFUL SLUG∣GARDS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 6.</NOTE>. How averse to their proper work! How prone to delay it, and excuse themselves from it, with very trifles! How averse to have their conscience a∣wakened and excited by the word, the Spirit, or the providence of God! How they waste precious time, in doing nothing, or worse! Wise indeed, they are in their own conceit, and faintly desirous of happiness, as they fancy it; but their languid attempts never issue in the change of their nature and state: Their hearts they neither keep nor cultivate: their talents and opportu∣nities they never improve for the glory of God, or their own real good: and how often by mere shadows and fancies of difficulty, are they discouraged, from follow∣ing out the appearance of any thing substantial!—Lord, how often have I, while starving, hid my hand in my bosom; and would not bring it to my mouth, with the offered fulness of thy Son!</P>
<P N="22">22. They are represented as CARNAL and FLESH∣LY <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 14</NOTE>. Alas! how they prefer the momentary con∣cerns of their body, to the eternal ones of their soul! How they attempt to nourish and satisfy their soul, on outward enjoyments! How fixed under the reigning power of indwelling sin; and given to make <HI>provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof!</HI> How given to <HI>fleshly lusts,</HI> that they know nothing, enjoy nothing, love nothing, seek nothing, but the <HI>things of the flesh!</HI>

They are <HI>in the flesh;</HI> fixed in their corruption, as a state, and prison. They <HI>walk after the flesh;</HI> act from carnal, corrupt principles, motives, and ends; and in a carnal, corrupt manner; taking delight in wickedness, and proceeding from evil to worse. They <HI>war after the flesh;</HI> by carnal inclinations, their zeal and their con∣tention are influenced and directed; and by carnal me∣thods they prosecute their purpose.—No wonder, they "that are in the flesh cannot please God."</P>
<P N="22">22. They are called STRANGERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xliv. 9.</NOTE>. They are strangers to God; to the true knowledge of him in Christ; to the fear and love of him; to his converting grace, and saving fellowship. Strangers to Christ, in his person, natures, offices, righteousness, and work: strangers to the way of peace, life, and salvation through him; to faith in, love to, and fellowship with him: strangers to the Holy Ghost, in his person; in his work of regeneration, sanctification, and comfort; in his gra∣ces of hope, humility, repentance, resignation, zeal, self-denial: strangers to themselves, to their own hearts and the sinful plagues thereof; to their own lives, and the defects and abominations thereof: strangers to the nature, the exceeding sinfulness, the deceitfulness, and ruinous consequences of sin; and to the only method of atonement and puricfiation from it: and, in fine, stran∣gers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the gospel, the truths, the ways, and people of God.—Let me bless the Lord, who took the <HI>stranger</HI> in; and let me acquaint "myself now with him, that thereby good may come unto <HI>my</HI> soul."</P>
<P N="23">23. They are represented as UNCIRCUMCISED <HI>in heart, in flesh, and ears</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xliv. 9. Acts vii. 51.</NOTE>. Never were they pricked to the heart for sin; never was its filthiness discovered, or hard∣ness removed; never were they filled with shame and self-loathing on account of it: never did they renounce their own righteousness, or put off the body of sin: never, were they taught by the grace of God to deny ungodli∣ness and worldly lusts; to abstain from fleshly lusts that war against the soul; but continue carnal, savouring and minding the things of the flesh, walking and warring after it; trusting in carnal and outward privileges, never were their ears spiritually opened to hearken and hear,

that their soul might live.—Circumcise my heart, O Jesus, to love thee: To hate thee is my saddest hell.</P>
<P N="24">24. They are represented as OUTCASTS, <HI>and</HI> FAR OFF <HI>from God</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. lvi. 8.</NOTE>. Naturally they are rejected by him; driven from his intimacy, favour, and protection. They are sustained as abominable; exposed to all evil and danger, no man careth for their soul. The multitude of their sinful inclinations and acts, do more and more se∣parate them from communion with, and conformity to God.—Let <HI>the Lord that gathereth the outcasts of Israel,</HI> gather me to himself.</P>

In their earliest mo∣ments, they are rejected of God, as altogether guilty and lothsome in his sight. How universally unpitied; unhelped! How unable to help themselves, or to ask for relief! How covered with the guilt! how stained with the filth of sin! How they wallow in their own blood, in the mire of filthy lusts! their heart, their mind their conscience, their whole course, being defiled. How devoid of the salt of grace!

<P N="78">78. They are represented as God's HAND; ROD; SWORD; AXE; HAMMER; BOW <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. x. and xiv. Psal. xvii. 13. 14.</NOTE>.

<P N="81">81. They, chiefly hypocrites, are compared to LUKE∣WARM WATER, and a CAKE <HI>not turned</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 16.</NOTE>. How often they mingle the true religion with a bad! have a pro∣fession, without true grace or good works!

How often his judgments torment, and burn them down to the lowest hell! How, there, shall his wrath kindle, and burn them for ever!

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Metaphors respecting faithful ministers.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FAITHFUL ministers are compared to AN∣GELS <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 20.</NOTE>. How distinguished their spiritual comeliness! their knowledge and wisdom! their dig∣nity, power, and authority! By them God executeth his will, and publisheth his mind to men. With what pleasure, activity, readiness, submission, and faithful∣ness, they unweariedly fulfil his commandment, praise his name, attend his throne of grace, pry into the my∣steries of redemption, watch over and comfort the saints; and excite, and in their station concur with the
<PB N="210" REF="214"/>
other DIVine executors of God's judgments against An∣tichrist! But at their peril, do men expect, that they should resemble angels, in living on earth without fault, or without food.</P>
<P N="2">2. They correspond to WINGED SERAPHIMS, <HI>attending an enthroned Redeemer, while the train of DIVine excellen∣cies and influences fill the temple of his human nature, and purchased church</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. vi. 1.—7.</NOTE>. They are <HI>fiery ones,</HI> are the light of the church, and burn with zeal for the glory of God. Their being <HI>on, above,</HI> or <HI>near to the throne,</HI> signifies their living near Jesus Christ, in spiritual fellowship with him, and possessing the office next to him in the church. Their <HI>six wings,</HI> import their eminent readiness, alacrity, and speed in his service. Their <HI>covering of their face and seet,</HI> imports their insufficiency to comprehend tho bright glory of his person, office, and work; and their being ashamed of their best services, in his sight. Their constant crying, <HI>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts,</HI> im∣ports, that the great end of a gospel-ministry, is to dis∣play the holiness of God, and promote holiness among men. <HI>The moving of the posts, at the sound of their cry,</HI> denotes the shaking of nations, trembling of conscience; and melting of heart, which attend the preaching of Christ. The <HI>taking a live coal from the altar, and laying it upon the mouth of the convicted prophet, for the purging away of his sin,</HI> implies, that Jesus' atonement applied, by means of the gospel ministry, quiets the conscience, and sanctifieth the heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. They resemble the FOUR BEASTS in John's, and the CHERUBIMS, and LIVING CREATURES in Ezekiel's vision <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. iv. 6.—9. and vi. 1.—7. and xv. 7. Ezek. i. and x.</NOTE>. Their number FOUR, imports the sufficiency of them in every age, to answer the purposes of God in all the ends of the earth. Their <HI>fulness of eyes within and without,</HI> imports their having a deep insight into spiritual cases, into the plagues of the heart, and the operation of the DIVine Spirit in it; and into what God hath said to, hath done, doth, and will do, for the church; and into her duty and danger in every case. It too, especially their <HI>eyes in their hands and wings,</HI> im∣ports the wisdom and circumspection of their behaviour.
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
The <HI>four faces,</HI> import, that, like <HI>men,</HI> ministers are to be comely in their conversation, affectionate, sympathi∣zing, meek, prudent, sagacious; like <HI>lions,</HI> bold, coura∣gious, and terrible to evil-doers; like <HI>oxen,</HI> tame, pa∣tient, hardy, laborious; and like <HI>eagles,</HI> intelligent, hea∣venly-minded, and active in their work. Their <HI>streight feet, and soles like those of a calf,</HI> denotes their upright gospel-conversation, and fitness to tread out the corn of God's word, for their hearers. Their having <HI>hands un∣der their wings,</HI> imports the correspondence of their practice, with their solemn professions and engagements. Their <HI>wings being stretched upward,</HI> implies their de∣pendence on Christ for furniture and direction. Their <HI>covering of their bodies and feet with their wings,</HI> imports their blushing at themselves and their work before God. Their appearance like <HI>lamps</HI> and <HI>coals of fire,</HI> marks their zeal for the glory of God, and their communicating light and knowledge to men. Their running <HI>straight forward as a flash of lightning,</HI> imports their integrity, quick progress, and majesty in their work. Their <HI>go∣ing along with the wheels,</HI> implies their constant connec∣tion with, and attendance on the rolling churches; the same spirit is in both; and as they are dull, or active, so ordinarily are the churches. Their <HI>voice like many waters extending to the outer court,</HI> imports the powerful and extensive spread of the gospel, chiefly among the Gentiles. Their warning people <HI>to come and see,</HI> when the seals are opened, implies, that the gospel preached; tends to cause men consider the word and providence of God. <HI>The man in the firmament above them, incircled with fire and a rainbow,</HI> is Christ, as the glorious and majestic head of the church, and of the new covenant, inspecting, helping, upholding, and governing them. <HI>The voice from the firmament when they stand or let down their wings,</HI> is Christ's quickening and encouraging them to their work. <HI>The taking out fire from between them, to cast upon sinners,</HI> implies that contempt of Christ, and his gospel-ministry, especially hastens, and enhan∣ceth flaming vengeance upon a land. One of these beasts giving the <HI>seven vials</HI> to be poured on Antichrist, im∣plies, that according to their word, and by their means, shall that <HI>man of sin</HI> be hastened to his ruin.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="212" REF="216"/>
4. They resemble the PRIESTS in Ezekiel's vision of the gospel-temple <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xlii. 1.—18. and xliii. 19.—27. and xliv. 9.—31. and xlvi. 20.</NOTE>. Their being the <HI>sons of Zadok, not of the Levites that went astray,</HI> implies their being true and blameless children of Jesus Christ, <HI>the righteous;</HI> and faithful preachers of his atonement, as the great substance of the gospel; and that such as have fallen into scandal, are not rashly to be admitted to the mini∣stry. Their <HI>eight day's consecration,</HI> implies their en∣trance on their work with much deliberation, abundant application of Jesus' blood, and vigorous study of gos∣pel-holiness; their having <HI>distinct chambers for themselves,</HI> imports that their office is strictly circumscribed by the DIVine law; and that none are to interfere with their work or benefice, but such as are truly sent. Their <HI>highest chambers being most straitened,</HI> imports, that the most eminent ministers in the church, are ordinarily most hated and exposed to trouble on earth. Their being "clothed with linen, not with wool, or any thing that causeth sweat," imports their being clothed with Jesus' righteousness, and not with their own fatiguing and and defiling works; and that their doctrine must be pure, not erroneous and unsavoury; that their conver∣sation must be holy, not offensive, stupid, or slothful; nor their ministry their burden. Their <HI>linen bonnets and breeches,</HI> denote their gravity, their modesty, their chastity, and freedom from Antichristian whoredom. Their <HI>laying aside their fine robes;</HI> and <HI>wearing others before the people,</HI> imply that though they must only ap∣pear before God in the righteousness of his Son; yet, by their holy conversation, they must recommend holiness to their hearers and neighbours. Their "not sactify-the people with their garments," may imply that they must not allow the people to usurp their office; nor pretend, by their holiness, or their bodily apparel, to convey any sanctity, merit or safety to them, as Anti∣christians do. Their "not shaving their heads, or suffer∣ing their locks to grow," imports their abstaining from Popish superstition, and from worldly pride and wan∣tonness. They must beware of being intoxicated with drunkenness and carnal care. They must marry
<PB N="213" REF="217"/>
such women only, as are of good report. They must teach the people of God, and compose differences be∣twixt them. They must avoid immoderate sorrow for deceased friends. And plentifully they must nourish their souls on Christ and him crucified. And plentifully are they and their families to be maintained by their people. Their <HI>boiling of the sin-offering and trespass-offe∣ring,</HI> denotes their digesting gospel-truth in their heart and judgment; and their preparing of their discourses before they preach them.</P>
<P N="5">5. They are called RULERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 7. 17.</NOTE>. How eminent their excellency, usefulness, and authority in the church! Being chosen by their people, it is theirs wisely, meek∣ly, kindly and carefully, to govern her members and matters, according to the laws of Christ, her king; and duly are they to be loved, obeyed, honoured, prayed, and provided for, as his vicegerents.</P>
<P N="6">6. They are represented as AMBASSADORS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 18. 19. 20.</NOTE>. Sent by King Jesus to propose and negociate with sinful men a treaty of peace with God, of marriage with himself, and of traffic with his fulness; with all authority, ear∣nestness, wisdom, singleness, and faithfulness, they must adhere to their instructions; and study, by their candid and honourable deportment, to promote it. Deeply must they be affected and grieved, if it do not succeed. Always ought they to be in readiness, to render an ac∣count of their conduct to God. With the utmost hear∣tiness and humility, ought the children of men to re∣ceive them and their message. If their person be de∣spised, their character injured, or their embassy rejected, to what DIVine vengeance it exposeth the guilty! And what a fearful presage of approaching wrath, is God's calling them fast off from their work!</P>
<P N="7">7. They are represented as WITNESSES <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John xv. 22. Rev. xi.</NOTE>. With fidelity, distinctness, boldness, and impartiality, they testify to men, that which they have seen and heard concerning Jesus Christ and his truths; and according to the word of their testimony, shall you nations be ac∣quitted or condemned at the judgment-seat of Christ. Under Antichrist they are <HI>two witnesses;</HI> few, but suf∣ficient,
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
powerful with God; but <HI>clothed in sackcloth,</HI> mourning and distressed,</P>
<P N="8">8. They are compared to PARENTS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor iv. 15.</NOTE>. How great is their dignity and authority in the visible church! With what ardent love, earnest desire, fervent prayer, and la∣borious ministration of the gospel, they promote the spi∣ritual birth, instruction, reproof, safety, nourishment, and rule of the saints! How tenderly they care for, sympathize with, and exemplify godliness, to church∣members! How mightily grieved with their miscarriages! And how tenderly to be loved, esteemed, and revered, by them! What a loss to be deprived of them!</P>
<P N="9">9. They are represented as WOOERS; and FRIENDS <HI>of the Bridegroom</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John iii. 29. 2 Cor. xi. 2.</NOTE>. By Christ's appointment, and with a single regard to his interest, and to the souls of men, they propose to them an offer of spiritual marriage with him. With every gaining consideration of their necessity, and of his excellency, honour, riches, beauty, and love, they prudently, faithfully, and earnestly en∣force the proposal. To him they return an account of their diligence. With what sorrow their hearts are fill∣ed, if the treaty succeeds not! With what joy, if it do! How delighted to hear the Bridegroom's voice! And how averse to be loved in his stead!</P>
<P N="10">10. They are called WARRIORS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 3. and iv. 8.</NOTE>. Being solemnly enlisted under Jesus' banner of truth and love, distin∣guished with the livery of his call to, and furniture for their work, clothed with his righteousness and grace, armed with the <HI>whole armour of God,</HI> nourished with his influence and provision, in face of difficulty and danger, they employ themselves in the vigorous defence of his church, ordinances, and truth. Skilfully they must wield and push the <HI>sword of the Spirit,</HI> and of church disci∣pline and government, launch the spear and dart, and the arrows of DIVine truth, against every spiritual enemy. Never must they entangle themselves with worldly busi∣ness, carnal offices, or temptations; but vigorously make war on the kingdom of Satan; pull down his <HI>strong holds</HI> of sinful lusts, abominable errors and hateful practices; and endeavour to conquer sinful men to Jesus Christ, the

Saviour. So shall they obtain a <HI>crown of righteousness,</HI> and reward of eternal life.</P>
<P N="11">11. They are called WATCHMEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 17. Ezek. xxxiii. 7.</NOTE>. Being placed by Jesus Christ in an high and important station; it is theirs faithfully, and impartially, to watch over the souls of church-members; to observe their state, their case, and walk; to watch over the truths and institutions of Heaven, that none be corrupted or lost. It is theirs to notice the variation of the times and providences of God; to observe the motions and approaches of every spiritual enemy, that, during the night of distress, and of time, they may give us distinct, early, and full warning of our duty and danger. Of what infinite importance is their work to the souls of men! What labour and danger at∣tend it! But if they desert it, give up themselves to ne∣gligence and sleep in it, how guilty are they of the blood of souls! and how exposed to the most tremendous vengeance of God!</P>
<P N="12">12. They are represented as TRUMPETERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. lviii. 1.</NOTE>.

And call them to attend the ordinances of his worship! With what undaunted boldness and distinctness, they warn them of their faults, and their danger; direct and encourage them in their spiritual conflict with their indwelling sin, with Satan, and with a present evil world! and shew themselves pat∣terns of bravery and diligence therein!</P>
<P N="13">13. They are represented as LEADERS and GUIDES <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 1.</NOTE>.

14. They are called PASTORS; SHEPHERDS; BISHOPS; or OVERSEERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. 4. Acts xx. 28.</NOTE>. They are DIVinely appointed, and solemnly engaged, carefully to lead the flock, the mem∣bers of Jesus' church; tenderly to feed them with his truths and ordinances; oversee, watch over, defend, and keep them together; and to separate from among them the scandalous and openly wicked. And from their flock ought they to receive a proper subsistence. From Jesus shall they receive an everlasting reward.</P>
<P N="15">15. They are called BUILDERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 11.</NOTE>. Being DIVinely instructed and appointed by Jesus, the sovereign Archi∣tect of the church, they must clear off the rubbish of false doctrine, and sinful customs. Every doctrine, in∣struction, and example which they exhibit, they must establish on Christ the foundation, and his sure and im∣moveable word. The corner-stones and pillars of fun∣damental truths, they must especially confirm; and must closely connect their whole doctrine, and conduct there∣with. Carefully must they attend the rule of inspira∣tion in all that they do. Incessantly, skilfully, and ear∣nestly, they must promote the conviction, the illumina∣tion, the union to Christ, the justification, sanctification, comfort, and endless felicity of their hearers. Were not you, prophets and apostles, <HI>wise master-builders,</HI> con∣cerned in laying the foundation, and principal matters of the church of God?</P>
<P N="16">16. They are represented as FISHERS OF MEN <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xlvii. 10. Matth. iv. 19.</NOTE>. With what labour, care, skill, and exposure to danger, they cast the net of the gospel, into the sea of this world, and spread it upon sinners, that they may draw them to Christ! It being adapted to their various conditions, some are hereby caught in reality; others only in ap∣pearance.—When, O Jesus, wilt thou direct them to cast the net on the right side of the ship, that a multi∣tude may be inclosed! When shall the whole dead sea of this world be covered with these fishers! When shall the souls they catch be, like the fish of the great sea, countless in number; and exceedingly DIVersified in case!</P>

It is theirs to take the foxes; to call false teachers to account; to refute their error, censure and reject such as are obsti∣nate in evil ways. It is theirs, to promote the gracious implantation of sinners into Christ; to reprove, refresh, comfort, enourage, and direct the saints, who are the beloved, the darling vineyard, and garden of God.</P>
<P N="18">18. They are compared to STEWARDS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1. Luke xvi. 1.—1.</NOTE>. Being entrusted by Jesus with the charge of his oracles, his or∣dinances, his house and family of the militant church, and the souls of men pertaining to it; it is theirs, care∣fully to oversee whatever is done; to assign each mem∣ber his proper business; and, in due season, give him his proper provision, his portion of promises, threatenings, reproof, censure, encouragement, or comfort. To Jesus they must give an account of their conduct. And how terrible their condemnation, if they corrupt or conceal DIVine truth! if they disorder, pollute, or break the peace of the church! if they waste their time, their ta∣lents, their opportunities, to sinful or insignificant pur∣poses! Or, if they beat, despise, reproach, or unjustly censure their brethren and fellow-servants.</P>
<P N="19">19. They are represented as SERVANTS and LABOUR∣ERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. ix. 37.</NOTE>. Being solemnly engaged to, and hired by Je∣sus, to occupy in his church; it is theirs, by every pro∣per method, however base or difficult to the carnal eye, to promote his glory, and the spiritual edification or men. Always, and in all places, they are to be very diligent, humble, obedient, single, and faithful, in their work. Always they are to exert their whole power and skill; and seize every opportunity; that, by the public or private dispensation of the gospel, they may be in∣strumental, in plowing up the fallow-ground of mens hearts; in plucking them as brands out of the burning; in hewing them off from their oldc-ovenant root; in ga∣thering them to Jesus; and promoting their heavenly course. Patiently they are to bear whatever burden of work, of trouble, or persecution, God may lay upon
<PB N="218" REF="222"/>

<P N="20">20. They, as the ancient prophets, are MEN or GOD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 6. 1 Tim. vi. 11.</NOTE>. By God they are chosen, called, and fitted for their work. Near him they stand in their office. Near him they live in their holy conversation; and are his deputies, his distinguished representatives, and pe∣culiar property on earth. He is the subject-matter, and the obvious end of their work. The injuries done to them, he will sharply resent. For he that despiseth them, despiseth him that sent them.</P>

How noted their harmonious af∣fection! How equal their power and authority assigned them by Christ! How earnest their endeavours, and happy their success, in winning souls to him!

By them how sweetly are declared the riches of his grace, and manifold other excellencies, in them that believe! and the abundance of his wisdom, power, holiness, and equity in them that perish! Dreadful thought! Ye sinners; shall God; shall a Saviour be exalted in your endless damnation, if you refuse him?</P>
<P N="27">27. They are represented as a SPECTACLE <HI>to angels and men</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 9.</NOTE>. How exposed to open view, on the theatre of this world! Ah, what SIGNS, against which the contempt, the obloquy, the malice, the persecution of men, and rage of devils, are especially discharged!

What blessed means of discovering men to themselves: shew∣ing them the plagues of their heart, or the grace that hath been given them! What means of discovering to men the excellencies of Christ, and the glory of God in him! how unhappy; how devoid of spiritual light and consolation; the places where they are not! How

dreadful when this light is turned into darkness; and ministers are ignorant, or replenished and clouded with error!</P>
<P N="29">29. They are compared to STARS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 20.</NOTE>. In the firma∣ment of the church Jesus hath planted them, and fur∣nished them with DIVersities of gifts and graces, for the adorning of it; and for refreshing, quickening, instructing men; for leading them to himself; for guiding them,—while, amidst this bewildering world, they wander in the night of trouble and time; or, amidst the swelling seas of manifold temptations and trials, they sail to the home and haven of endless felicity! How they are held, supported, and directed, by Jesus, in his right hand! How high in their station and office! How near to God and heavenly things are their motions and course! How easily beclouded their glory! How readily; how wide-discovered their shameful blots!—O when shall the e∣ternal day break; that stars may disappear, shadows flee away, and Christ be ALL IN ALL!</P>
<P N="30">30. They are compared to CANDLES and LAMPS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 15.</NOTE>. In themselves how insignificant! But being formed, and, from the sire of Jesus' light and love, lighted by the Holy Ghost, with gifts, office, and grace; how useful, during the night of time, to enlighten a dark world! How necessary, that they should appear, and shine publicly! How generously they spend themselves in illuminating others! How often moved from one nation and place, to another! When, Lord, shall candles be extinct, and never-wasting glory shine!</P>
<P N="31">31. They are compared to CLOUDS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. v. 6.</NOTE>. Receiving their gifts, their grace, their office, from the ocean, the fulness of Christ; what appointed means of conveying the rain, the dew, of DIVine truths and influences, to men! Nor can they be useful, but as God pleaseth. Are they not a kind of vail interposed between weak-sighted mortals, and his dazzling brightness! How ex∣posed to observation, and to tempests of trouble! How supernatural and speedy their motions! How heavy the judgment, when they are removed from a land, or their usefulness DIVinely restrained!</P>

<P N="33">33. They resemble PILLARS; POSTS; and BEAMS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 17. and iii. 10. Gal. ii. 9.</NOTE>. How strong in gifts and grace! How well fixed, and founded on Christ!

For the security and glory of his church; for the observation of his principal foes, they are erected, and strengthened by Christ, and on him as their sure foundation. How high is their station! How upright, heavenly, firm, and constant, ought they to be in it! How abundantly furnished with spiritual armour! and ready, by dispensing the gospel, to confer it to others! They are especially to watch against, and oppose, their most dangerous spiritual enemies. And like a <HI>tower of ivory;</HI> how pure; how comely; how self consistent, and firm, are their doctrine and conversation!</P>
<P N="35">35. They resemble CHARIOTS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Zech. vi. 1.—8.</NOTE>. How glorious, curious, and costly, their erection and office! By them, in gospel-ministrations, Jesus' name is carried before the Gentiles; and he, in a royal and majestic, a quick, easy, and triumphant manner, rides through the world; subdues, and shews his glory, and love to his chosen; conquers his spiritual opposers.—In their bloody suffer∣ing, and flaming zeal, they resemble a <HI>chariot with red horses.</HI> In their abject outward appearance, their self-denial, their insight into spiritual mysteries, they re∣semble a <HI>chariot with black horses.</HI> In their holy lives, their pure doctrines, and spiritual conquests, they re∣semble a <HI>chariot with white horses.</HI> In their DIVersity of gifts and graces, they are like to a <HI>chariot with grizzled and bay horses.</HI> In the apostolic age, they resembled the first chariot.

<P N="37">37. They resemble a ROUND GOBLET full of mixed liquor <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song. vii. 2.</NOTE>. How distinguished is their capacity and perfection!

<P N="38">38. They are compared to SALT <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 13.</NOTE>. By their holy conversation; by their faithful dispensing of gospel doc∣trine, worship, discipline, and government; they check corruption, and error; they preserve persons and churches from rottenness, unsavouriness, apostacy, and ruin; they preserve nations from general profaneness, and desolating strokes. How incorruptible and lasting their office! How calculated to prepare the redeemed for the feast of their God! How carefully they search mens wounds, for the healing of them! Hence what an eye-fore and trouble to the wicked and scandalous! But if, by carnality, unholiness, or sloth, ministers lose their own savour, none are more hopeless; none more useless; none more ripe for eternal fire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Metaphors respecting false teachers, and unfaithful ministers.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FALSE teachers are represented as MESSENGERS and SPIRITS OF DEVILS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 15. Rev. xvi. 14.</NOTE>. By Satan they are sent, excited, directed, and actuated. His honour and interest they promote and maintain. And in filthiness, in pride, in malice, in slander of the saints, in active wasting of the church, and in ruining mens souls, they imitate his example.</P>
<P N="2">2. They, chiefly some principal ones, are called AN∣TICHRISTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 John. ii. 18.</NOTE>. They oppose Christ in his person, his office, his righteousness, his intercession, his instruc∣tion, his laws, his conquests, his government, and the end of his work.</P>
<P N="3">3. They are represented as FALSE PROPHETS and APOSTLES, and some of them as false Christs <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 1. Matth. xxiv. 24.</NOTE>. Pre∣tending a commission from God, and often a distin∣guished one; sometimes to be the Messiah, they, in his name, publish their false doctrines; attempt to erect false churches; claim uncommon power; pretend di∣stinguished gifts and grace; prophesy of future events; promise to themselves and their followers liberty and peace, when swift destruction cometh upon them.</P>
<P N="4">4. They are represented as MURDERERS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Zech. xi. 5.</NOTE>. By ne∣glecting to warn the wicked of their evil ways, and to promote their repentance, by false doctrines; by wick∣ed example; and by unfaithful dispensing of DIVine or∣dinances, they destroy the cause and interest of truth; crucify Jesus afresh; and ruin the souls of men.</P>
<P N="5">5. They are represented as PIMPS, and WHORISH WOMEN <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 20.</NOTE>. With the utmost impudence, craft, and carnal enticement, they decoy multitudes to go a who∣ring from God and his ways, and to defile themselves, "fulfilling the lusts of the flesh and of the mind."</P>
<P N="6">6. They are represented as angry MOTHER'S CHIL∣DREN,

and OUTRAGIOUS WATCHMEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 6. and v. 7.</NOTE>. Being ori∣ginally members of the church, but never born of God, they hate his true children. With their enslaving er∣rors and will-worship, they go about to oppress and hinder them from their proper work. Sadly they ha∣rass and wound them, reproach their conduct, expose them to injury, and attempt to rob them of their all-covering vail, Christ and his righteousness.</P>
<P N="7">7. They are represented as Christ's COMPANIONS or rivals <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 8.</NOTE>. Whatever love to, and connection with him, they pretend; they heartily hate him; set themselves on a level with him; seek to undermine his interest, and despoil him of his subjects, his bride. Never, O Jesus, permit me, whorishly and wickedly, to turn aside by their numerous flocks.</P>
<P N="8">8. They are represented as THIEVES and ROBBERS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John x. 1.</NOTE>. Without any regular mission from Christ, or call from his people, how often they rush into the ministerial func∣tion! How often they rob the Redeemer of his due ho∣nour, as ruler, as priest, or prophet of his church! How wickedly they rob the saints of their spiritual privileges, and confer them upon others! rob men of their gospel-provision! and attempt to sell them into the slavery of Satan!</P>
<P N="9">9. They are called DECEIVERS and SEDUCERS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 13.</NOTE>. They deceitfully mingle the gospel of Christ with their own inventions; and, having thus corrupted it, impose it upon their hearers for pure and genuine truth. Un∣der high pretences to friendship, to piety, to peace, to knowledge, or zeal, they decoy men into corruption and error; and bring on themselves and their followers sud∣den destruction.</P>
<P N="10">10. They are represented as BLIND WATCHMEN; BLIND GUIDES <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is. lvi. 10.</NOTE>. Being destitute of the saving know∣ledge of Jesus, and his truth, they presumptuously pre∣tend to direct the principles and practice of others; and with them fall into sudden ruin.</P>

<P N="12">12. They are called HIRELINGS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John x. 12.</NOTE>. Not from ge∣nuine affection to Jesus or his people, do they labour in the ministry; but to procure carnal favour, honour, pleasure, or gain.

<P N="13">13. They are represented as FOOLISH BUILDERS <HI>of hay and stubble</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 12.</NOTE>.

With what amazing greed, covetousness, cruelty, and craft; and with what shifts, evasions, and self-inconsistencies, unnumbered, they, especially in the night of persecution, trouble, or carnal security,—spoil God's vineyard! unsettle weak and young professors! ruin mens souls! and promote Satan's interests; till they be restrained by providence, checked by faithful censure, or cut off by death! And ah, how often are they proudly stupid under these checks!</P>
<P N="19">19. They are represented as LAZY, GREEDY, DUMS DOGS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. lvi. 10. 11.</NOTE>.

How marked with outward gran∣deur; with usurped authority; and superstitious reve∣rence of the mob! How noted their plausible pretences to piety; their affected courtesy; their lustful effemi∣nacy; their fawning flattery and smoothness; and their enticing of multitudes to spiritual whoredom! How di∣stinguished their cruelty and fraud in destroying the souls, the bodies, and the estates of men! How breast-plated with hardness of heart, searedness of conscience, and with civil and ecclesiastic laws and immunities in their favour!

<HEAD>CHAP XI. <HI>Metaphors respecting the true church.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE church, in connection with her head, is called CHRIST <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 12.</NOTE>. Jesus is her head, hus∣band, and <HI>all in all.</HI> From his love, his blood, his in∣tercession, and Spirit, she wholly proceeds. To him, as proprietor, she wholly pertains. To his person every true member is united. And to his honour do all her saints, her laws, her ordinances, and offices tend.</P>
<P N="2">2. She is compared to a HUMAN BODY, or WOMAN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 5. 8. 9. 10. 11. 13. and iv. 1.—5. and vi. 5. 6. 7. and vii. 1.—5. and v. 2. Rev. xii. 1.</NOTE>. She is united to Jesus as her Lord and head, whence her honour, her laws, her ordinances, her nourishment and life are derived. She consists of innumerable members, all closely connected with him, and with one another; who feel one another's affliction, sympathize with one another's infirmities, care for one another's welfare, and are in constant readiness to serve one another. Gradually she increaseth in strength and extent; till she attain the perfect stature of the glorified state. Like a woman, she is subject to manifold weakness and trouble on earth. Christ himself being her <HI>head,</HI> her <HI>eyes</HI> may signify her illuminating doctrines founded in him; or her ministers, who, being rooted and grounded in him, signally adorn her appearance, observe and direct her members, watch against her enemies, express her sorrows, and pry into the mysteries of the gospel. Her <HI>hair</HI> may signify her converts, especially young ones, who, however weak and easily tossed, are by faith fixed in Christ; like <HI>locks,</HI> knit to one another in love, and are an ornament and honour to Christ, and his church. Her <HI>nose,</HI> may represent mi∣nisters in their spiritual discerning, and relish of DIVine things; in their exposure to danger, and their watching against enemies; and who, while the church is sound, are a pleasant, refreshing, and <HI>apple-like</HI> savour of Christ to others; and by them her breath issues forth, towards God, in prayer and praise. Or may not her <HI>nose,</HI> signify
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
her slately and majestic ordinances, awful to her ene∣mies, ornamental and savoury to saints? Her <HI>temples,</HI> may signify her rulers, who, by humble and prudent management of her discipline and government, add to her comeliness. Her <HI>cheeks,</HI> may denote her whole out∣ward and visible appearance. Her <HI>scarlet lips,</HI> may re∣present preachers and their gospel-ministrations, chiefly versant about Jesus Christ, as bearing, and crucified for, our iniquities. Her <HI>teeth,</HI> may denote ministers as chew∣ing, as meditating on, the bread of life, and rendering it fit for use to the very weakest members. Her <HI>neck,</HI> may represent them as immediately subject to Christ her head, as adorned with golden gifts and graces; and as the useful means of exalting him, and conveying nou∣rishment from him to us: or it may denote the inspired oracles, which, adorned with connected, durable, and precious doctrines, laws, and promises, unite us to him; and, from his fulness, convey breath and nourishment in∣to our soul. May not her <HI>breasts</HI> signify her pastors and teachers; her two inspired testaments of heaven; her two sorts of ordinances, ordinary and solemn; her two sacramental seals of the new covenant; which adorn her form and appearance, and convey the sincere milk of DIVine truth and gospel-influence, to nourish the infantile children of God? May not her <HI>navel</HI> denote ministers, as placed in the midst, in the principal station of the church; as mightily conducive to her health and strength; and the distinguished means of nourishing her children in their spiritual formation? Her <HI>belly</HI> may signify the word and ordinances of Jesus Christ, in which his chosen are DIVinely conceived and formed into new creatures: or it may signify her saints, who are the substance in the midst of her. May not the <HI>joints of her things,</HI> signify her curiously formed young converts, running in the ways of holiness? Or may they denote sound standards; or the all-covering robes of Jesus' righteousness? These mightily tend to promote her regular and comely ma∣nagement. May <HI>her feet, beautiful with shoes,</HI> denote her pastors, as fixed in the faith of the gospel, and bold∣ly, readily, and beautifully running to and fro, to pub∣lish it? or her private members, as well instructed, and powerfully influenced by the glorious gospel, and readily
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
running in the paths thereof? Her being <HI>black, but come∣ly, fairest among women,</HI> implies, that however she be deformed by hypocrites and persecutions, yet, as order∣ed by, and conformed to Jesus Christ, she is truly beau∣tiful and glorious. Her <HI>sleeping while her heart waketh,</HI> implies all her members, except a few choice ones, fallen into carnal security, and sad ignorance. Her <HI>crown of twelve stars,</HI> implies her open and honourable profes∣sion of the doctrines of the prophets and twelve apostles of the Lamb. <HI>Her chains of gold, rows of jewels, bor∣ders of gold, and studs of silver,</HI> may represent her vari∣ous and well-connected laws, doctrines, promises, ordi∣nances, gifts, and graces, which are bestowed upon her, by her husband Christ. Her <HI>clothing of the sun,</HI> signi∣fies him as her righteousness, protector, and glory. Her <HI>vail taken from her by outrageous watchmen,</HI> may signify her intrinsic power and government; her civil protec∣tion from the state; or her useful doctrine of Jesus' im∣puted righteousness. Her <HI>having the moon under her seet,</HI> implieth her renouncing Jewish ceremonies, and contemning earthly customs and portions.</P>
<P N="3">3. The church is compared to a VIRGIN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. lxii. 4. 5.</NOTE>. How pure in her doctrine! her ordinances! How abhorrent of whorish idolatry and will-worship!

<P N="4">4. She is likened to a WIFE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. iii. 14.</NOTE>. She is solemnly espoused to Christ, by outward profession, and by parti∣cipation of the sacraments; and thus brought into fel∣lowship with him, and a general interest in his person and benefits. Hereby, how highly she is exalted and secured against total ruin! In her, his will is manifest∣ed; and all her true members have special union and communion with him. And is it not the indispensible duty of every one, to obey and please him in all things; to desire his presence with her; and to be exceedingly grieved, when he is dishonoured and provoked?</P>

was born in her; became a member of her; and is by her crowned with numbers of converts, with unfa∣ding honour, and endless praise. Being married to him, and obtaining his presence in ordinances, she, travailing in birth, by the painful labours of ministers and others, brings forth a generation of saints; nourisheth them with the <HI>sincere milk of the word;</HI> instructs them in the found principles of truth: dearly she loveth, tenderly she pities them, and the more as they resemble Christ: their proper work she assigns them; from danger she defends them: highly she reckons herself honoured by their good behaviour; and by spiritual censure she corrects them, when unruly. The Gentile world was long a <HI>barren woman,</HI> which brought forth no children to God; but now produceth more than the Jewish, which was long the Lord's espoused bride. The gospel-church is a <HI>free mother,</HI> freed from the law as a covenant, and from the yoke of ancient ceremonies: she <HI>travails in pain</HI> by spiritual pains, and endurance of manifold trouble and persecution: the <HI>man children</HI> brought forth by her, are Jesus, with his honoured agent Constantine, the first Christian emperor, and his other bold and resolute saints: these are <HI>caught up to God, and to his throne;</HI> Christ ex∣alted to his right hand; Constantine to the imperial throne; the primitive saints to the celestial mansions; or specially honoured and protected on earth. Satan and his agents, particularly the heathen empire of Rome, are the <HI>dragon,</HI> which waits to devour her children, and to persecute herself. Her <HI>place,</HI> DIVinely <HI>provided for her in the wilderness,</HI> is her afflicted state under Anti∣christ, in which God protects her for 1260 years.</P>
<P N="6">6. She is compared to an ARMY <HI>with banners</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 4.</NOTE>. Having private saints for her common soldiers, spiritual rulers for her officers, Christ for her Captain general, his person, his truth, and love, for her banner, to ga∣ther, distinguish, direct, and encourage her bands; they, being armed with her graces and ordinances, resist, conquer, and spread terror among her spiritual foes.</P>
<P N="7">7. She is represented as a NATION <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. lx. 21.</NOTE>. She is a du∣rable, numerous, well regulated, protected, and enriched society. Jesus is her king; angels and ministers, her
<PB N="233" REF="237"/>
guards: Jesus' word is her history and laws; his new covenant and its blessings are her inheritance; receiving out of his fulness, and improving it in holy exercises, her trade; DIVine ordinances her houses and tents. The <HI>two armies</HI> to be seen in her, are hosts of DIVine perfections, and angelie spirits, standing in her defence; hosts of inward graces and lusts conflicting in her true members; and hosts of zealous saints and untender hy∣pocrites opposing one another.—O when shall a <HI>nation be born at once!</HI> a little one become a <HI>strong nation! the righteous nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in</HI> to the heavenly Canaan!</P>
<P N="8">8. She is compared to a CITY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xxvi. 1.</NOTE>. Upon himself, as her foundation, Jesus Christ hath built her: curiously he formed her plan, and exactly he executes it: with the wall of his power, his protection and laws, he surrounds her: He hath appointed all her regulations and customs: himself is her chief magistrate; her officers are his de∣puties: what an innumerable company, that no man can number, are her inhabitants! and how active; labori∣ous; high fed, and richly clothed, are her true mem∣bers! how DIVersified and rich these privileges, in which they have all an equal, an everlasting interest! In freely receiving the fulness of God, from the land that is afar off, consists her gainful trade: in the midst of her, in the channels of ordinances and promises, runs the all-adorning, all-protecting refreshful, cleansing, healing, and commercial <HI>river of life:</HI> in her, Christ, his Father, and Spirit, reside: he, his angels, and ministers, watch over and defend her; that <HI>the gates,</HI> the powers <HI>of hell, shall not prevail against</HI> her.—O how much were it for her advantage, that her inhabitants tenderly loved and and clave one to another, as her adversaries daily be∣siege her, by temptation and persecution! But alas! while on earth, what a mixed multitude of treacherous hypocrites remain in, and plague, and pollute her!</P>
<P N="9">9. She is compared to a FAMILY or HOUSEHOLD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 10. Matth. xxiv. 45. and xxv. 15—30.</NOTE>. Being separated from the rest of the world, God is her father; Christ is her elder brother, glory, and manager; angels and church officers are her servants and stewards.
<PB N="234" REF="238"/>
In her are saints, young and old; weak and strong: to each is DIVinely appointed his proper work, station, and privilege; and how comely, when with order, har∣mony, skill and delight, they apply themselves thereto! How DIVinely are all her members instructed, aparel∣led, defended; and, on every proper occasion, called to worship their God. She is like to a <HI>family of ser∣vants:</HI> how orderly hired, admitted, and connected, are, or ought her members to be! All of them are sub∣ject to Jesus' authority, and bound to advance his ho∣nour: To them, in very different degrees, he intrusts the talents and pounds of office, opportunity, gifts, and graces, that they may occupy therewith, till he come again: Such as improve them, shall be propor∣tionally honoured and rewarded: such as do not, but, as it were, <HI>hide</HI> them <HI>in a napkin,</HI> shall be self-condem∣ned, and cast into eternal ruin. How deeply are all indebted to Jesus! but finding they have nothing to pay, how ready is he frankly to forgive them! How absurd then for them to revenge petty injuries upon one an∣other! If he forgive me my <HI>ten thousand talents,</HI> what torment, what damnation I deserve, if I resent on my my neighbour the petty wrong, which his tongue or hand have done me! If while my Lord delayeth his coming, I beat, reproach, unjustly censure, or perse∣cute my fellow-servants, shall not I have my <HI>portion with hypocrites?—</HI>Pray, my soul, for this family of God; for <HI>they shall prosper that love her.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. She is compared to a DOVE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 15.</NOTE>. How great her purity! her simplicity! her innocency! her comeliness! her chaste affection towards Christ her head! how single her adherence to his truths and ordinances! How she flies to him in distress, and mourns for his absence! How pleasant the consociation of her members! How noted her fruitfulness in young converts! How eminent her weakness in herself; and her exposure to enemies!</P>
<P N="11">11. She is compared to a THRESHING OX <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mic. iv. 13.</NOTE>. By her shall God subdue and break in pieces all her ene∣mies; and render the whole earth servants to him, and to his Christ. Her <HI>iron horns,</HI> and <HI>hoofs of brass,</HI> are the power, authority, courage, and vigour, wherewith

<P N="12">12. She is compared to a FLOCK of sheep or goats <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. xxxvi. xxxvii. Song i. 7. 8.</NOTE>. How great the usefulness, purity, fruitfulness, unity, and affection of her true members! Of themselves, how weak to oppose! how unwatchful against their spiritual enemies! How tenderly loved, cared for, protected, healed, led, and nourished by Jesus! Ah! how often infection spreads among them! most being readier to follow example than precept. How beneficial are good patterns! and how hurtful are bad! Her <HI>ews with young</HI> are persons distressed in mind, are ministers travailing in birth, till Christ be formed in mens hearts. Her <HI>lambs</HI> and <HI>kids,</HI> are young converts, or professors, who are to be fed besides the <HI>shepherds tents</HI> of ordinances. She is <HI>Christ's flock;</HI> all her true-members he chose, purchased, gathers, conquers, feeds, protects, and cares for: and how many rich favours do even her nominal professors receive from his hand! She is <HI>one flock,</HI> wholly united in her one head, Christ; a <HI>beautiful flock,</HI> ador∣ned with his word, his ordinances, righteousness and grace; a <HI>little flock,</HI> small in comparison of the rest of the world; a <HI>flock of slaughter,</HI> exposed to fearful perse∣cution and trouble. Her <HI>watering troughs, high moun∣tains,</HI> to feed on, and <HI>green pastures,</HI> are the lofty, the ever refreshing, and delightful word and ordinances of Christ. Her <HI>still waters,</HI> are the deeps of his everlasting love, meritorious blood, and DIVine influences, which run in the channels, and among the hills of DIVine ordinan∣ces. Her <HI>fold,</HI> is church-fellowship, DIVine ordinances; and gracious communion with himself. The <HI>footsteps of the flock,</HI> are the pattern of former saints; or the ordinances in which they walk.</P>
<P N="13">13. She is compared to an OLIVE TREE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hos. xiv. 7. Rom. xi. 17.</NOTE>. How perpetual her verdure and sap! How good and abun∣dant her fruit! How delightful her spiritual comeli∣ness, grace and light; and the peace, with God, with conscience, with creatures, which is exhibited and en∣joyed in her!</P>
<P N="14">14. She is compared to a VINE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hos. xiv. 7.</NOTE>. Being planted,
<PB N="234" REF="240"/>
pruned, watered, and preserved by Jesus' power, she, in herself contemptible, weak, and useless, in him a∣bounds with spiritual sap of DIVine truths and influen∣ces, spreads in the world, and brings forth the well-join∣ed, the useful, and refreshing fruits of holy men, of spiritual graces and good works, to the praise and glory of God! And, alas! how these particular assemblies and members which remain unfruitful, dishonour God, pro∣voke his wrath, and hasten their own disgrace and ruin!</P>
<P N="15">15. She resembles a BUSH BURNING, <HI>and not consu∣med</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Exod. iii. 1.—6.</NOTE>. To carnal men, she appears insignificant and contemptible: in this world, she is ordinarily low and exposed to afflictions: to such birds of mankind, as flee to the Lord Jesus, and sing to his praise, she is the common receptacle: notwithstanding of, nay, often a∣midst the fireiest trials and presecutions, she flourisheth with holy persons, graces, and exercises; painfully, though innocently, she pricks and plagues those who injure her.</P>
<P N="16">16. She is compared to a LILY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 2.</NOTE>. How comely and useful in her author, her laws, ordinances, and real members! Though weak in herself, how rooted in Christ! How glorious and great in him, as her head! How fruitful in the production of saints! How high and heavenly her nature and tendency! To what heights of perfection shall she attain! How delightful and dif∣fusive her favour, when the <HI>fulness of the Gentiles shall come in,</HI> and <HI>the whole earth be filled with the knowledge of the Lord!</HI> And though now she be <HI>among thorns,</HI> expo∣sed to troubles and evil men; yet how quickly shall she be transplanted to the celestial paradise of God!</P>
<P N="17">17. She is called the FULNESS OF CHRIST <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 23.</NOTE>. Her true members are his mystical body, through which he becomes a complete mediatorial head and husband, and in whom he fully manifests his mercy, kindness, and love.—Surprising! am I for ever to have Jesus for my fulness! and to be <HI>the fulness of him, who filleth all in all!</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. She is called HEAVEN <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rev. viii. 1. and xi. 12. 15. and xiv. 6.</NOTE>. She is the gate of entrance to heaven. In her, God, and his holy people re∣side;
<PB N="237" REF="241"/>
and the latter are fitted for the paradise above. Her laws, ordinances, and privileges, are of a heavenly ori∣gin, nature, and tendency. Christ and his oracles are her <HI>sun;</HI> his instituted ordinances her <HI>moon;</HI> HE, her <HI>morning-star;</HI> ministers and saints, her connected con∣stellations.</P>
<P N="19">19. She is compared to the SUN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 10.</NOTE>. How constant and abiding! <HI>the gates of hell</HI> cannot prevail against her. How delightfully the wonders and mysteries of God are displayed in her! How glorious her spiritual ap∣pearance! Nor is any saving light communicated to the world, but by her means! Her complex frame is clo∣thed with the laws and ordinances of Jesus, the <HI>Sun of righteousness;</HI> and her true members with his righteous∣ness and grace.</P>
<P N="20">20. She is compared to the MOON <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 10.</NOTE>. From Jesus Christ she receiveth all her light of inspiration, ordinances, and grace. Amidst various changes of outward circumstan∣ces, amidst unnumbered spots and imperfections, she, during the night of time, communicates the light of life to our darkened earth. How marvellous her influ∣ence upon the rise and fall of nations, in the SEA of this world! As Jesus' face shines upon her, so is the measure of her light: but when carnal schemes and poli∣tics interpose between her and him; how is her glory eclipsed! how many witness her shame!</P>
<P N="21">21. She resemblesh the MORNING <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 10.</NOTE>. How plea∣sant and refreshful, though imperfect, her light! How gradually from the beginning to the end of time, shall it increase, till it issue in the noon-tide blaze of ever∣lasting brightness! But, my soul, did not the church <HI>look forth as the</HI> MORNING, in the patriarchal age? Did she not appear <HI>sair as the</HI> MOON, when clothed with the numerous, moon-ruled, and fading ceremonies of the Jewish dispensation? Did she not in the apostolic,—and shall she not in the millennial, and the eternal pe∣riod, appear <HI>clear as the</HI> SUN?</P>
<P N="22">22. She resembles a SHIP <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. liv. 11.</NOTE>. How curiously built and furnished by Christ, for conveying his people thro' the sea of this world, and of manifold troubles, to the haven of glory! How skilfully ought she to be directed
<PB N="238" REF="242"/>
and managed, according to the compass of inspiration! How necessarily influenced, by the gales of DIVine in∣fluence! Alas! how often bewildered with the mists of delusion; and tossed by waves and storms of perse∣cution, DIVision, temptation, and trouble! What numbers, who once entered by a formal profession, are shaken out of her, by storms and death! Nor do any, but God's chosen and sanctified ones, by her means, arrive safe at the heavenly harbour.</P>
<P N="23">23. She is compared to a NET <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 47.—50.</NOTE>. How mean her materials! but how curiously connected her members, ordinances, and forms! With what labour and skill, Jesus and his agents cast her into the sea of this world, to catch and draw men to himself! And how often they remove her from one place to another! What multi∣tudes are sometimes, by his direction, therein appre∣hended! some of whom are real saints, <HI>good fishes;</HI> o∣thers hypocritical and <HI>bad!</HI> Quickly, in the last judg∣ment, shall she be drawn to the shore of the eternal state; where <HI>the good</HI> shall be gathered to Jesus' mansions; and <HI>the bad</HI> thrown away into the furnace of his wrath.</P>
<P N="24">24. She resembles Solomon's CHARIOT <HI>of the wood of Lebanon</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 9. 10.</NOTE>. Of men, rendered precious, fragrant, strong, comely, and durable, by his grace, hath our glorious King Jesus, our prince of peace, formed her. Ministers, shining in useful gifts and grace, are her <HI>silver pillars.</HI> The excellent, glorious, and everlasting per∣son of Christ, is her <HI>bottom of gold.</HI> Her <HI>covering of purple,</HI> implies her being washed in his blood, clothed with his righteousness, royally dignified by his kindness, and exposed to bloody suffering for his sake. Her be∣ing <HI>paved with love,</HI> implies, that his love is exhibited and applied in her; and that his people walk in love towards him, and towards one another.</P>
<P N="25">25. She resembles the WHEELS <HI>in Ezekiel's vision</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ezek. i.</NOTE>. How great her excellency and usefulness! how noted her moveableness from place to place! Through mens opposition, what a noise do her motions make in the world! May not their <HI>roundness</HI> import her perfection in her kind? their <HI>four faces</HI> imply knowledge, heavenli∣ness, courage, and patience in labour? the dreadful
<PB N="239" REF="243"/>
<HI>beight of their rings</HI> denote majesty, extent, and awful∣ness to opposers? May not their <HI>colour of the sea, or be∣ryl,</HI> mark out her fluctuating condition upon earth; and the excellency and beauty of her true members? their <HI>not turning as they went,</HI> represent her progress towards perfection, and the gracious perseverance and growth of her saints? May not their appearance as <HI>a wheel within a wheel,</HI> imply her curious structure, with respect to the particular worshipping assemblies, com∣prehended in her? May not the <HI>crying to the wheels</HI> import the necessary awakening and exciting of the church, by the word and Spirit of God? and the <HI>moving of the wheels by the Spirit of the living creatures,</HI> imply, that the churches must be animated to their progressive work, by the zealous diligence of ministers, and the in∣fluences of the DIVine Spirit, who is in them?</P>
<P N="26">26. She is called a SPRING SHUT UP; a FOUNTAIN SEALED <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 12.</NOTE>. How remarkably is she often protected by God! All her true members are graciously separated and preserved for him, as his <HI>hidden ones,</HI> and peculiar property! All her inspired oracles, DIVine ordinances, and valuable blessings, are safely reposited and secured in her. Nor are they bestowed on, or made known to the rest of the world.</P>
<P N="27">27. She is compared to a MOUNTAIN or HILL <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxx. 6. Song iv. 6. and viii. 14.</NOTE>. How immoveably rooted in Christ! How impossible to destroy her! How distinguished her excellency! How amazing her height, and extensive her prospect, into di∣vine, deep, and distant things! With what contempt do her saints overlook every thing without her, as low and trifling! In her spring the instituted <HI>wells of salvation,</HI> and runs the <HI>river of life.</HI> In her grow God's chosen plants, <HI>trees of righteousness</HI> and life, and fruitful vines. In her he is worshipped in spirit and in truth. In her, his ransomed flocks richly feed, on the pastures of gospel-ordinances! How safely preserved and sheltered by the Rock of ages! She is a <HI>mountain of myrrh, and hill of frankincense: mountains of spices.</HI> How fragrant, pre∣cious, purifying, and perfuming the virtue of her ordi∣nances, blessings, graces, and good works! How Jesus
<PB N="240" REF="244"/>
delights in her! and bestows on her true members sweet communion with himself</P>
<P N="28">28. She is compared to CARMEL; LEBANON; and SHARON <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xxxv. 2. and lxv. 10.</NOTE>. Jesus, the <HI>tree of life;</HI> and his Spirit, the <HI>water of life;</HI> are in her: the Rock of salvation, the Rose of Sharon, and Lily of the valley, are enjoyed in her! What fragrant and lasting verdure; what plea∣sant pasture, amiable prospect, and delightful rest, he, in her, creates for the souls of men!—In her, what plants of God; what flowers of grace, smell sweetly, blossom, and bring forth fruit!</P>
<P N="29">29. She is a little LITTLE STONE <HI>cut out of the moun∣tain without hands, which breaks to pieces the kingdoms os the world, and becomes a great mountain, filling the whole earth</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii. 34. 35.</NOTE>. Christ her Head, in his manhood, was formed by the transcendent power of the Holy Ghost. Wonder∣fully, not by human force, is she raised up in the world. By the sovereign power, and free grace of God, are her true members digged from their natural state, and brought from among the residue of mankind. Implored by her fervent prayers, shall the righteous Lord bring terrible destruction upon her opposers. When wealthiest empires are overturned, she, however small and despised, shall continue, and gain ground by their ruin. In the last days, when the Chaldean, Persian, Grecian, Roman, and Tartarian empires, are no more; she shall extend to all the kingdoms of the earth; and in her lofty or∣dinances shall all flesh see the salvation of God.</P>
<P N="30">30. She is compared to a GARDEN; ORCHARD; VINE∣YARD <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. v. 1.—5. Song iv. 13. 14. and viii. 11. 13. Is. xxvii. 2. 3. Matth. xx. 1.—16. and xxi. 33.—44.</NOTE>. At infinite expence of love, of power, and blood, Jesus purchased her from the justice of God. The heart of her chosen members he plows up; removes their stony hardness; and every other bar in his way. Regularly he plants her with his saints, his ordinances and grace. By the hedge of government and discipline, he defends and separates her from the rest of the world. By the shining of his countenance, and the application of his love, he warms and nourisheth her. With the ri∣ver, the rain, the dew of his word and Spirit, he waters
<PB N="241" REF="245"/>
her every moment. With his truths and blessings, he fattens her. By his angels, his ministers, his providence, he watcheth over, and keeps her night and day, lest any hurt her. How dear is she to him! and how he de∣lights to walk in her! What officers and members he hires to labour in her! No feed, but that of his word, he allows to be cast into her. To none, but the choice seed of his saints, he allows access to her fealing ordinances. By a faithful administration of his institutions, and by manifold persecutions and afflictions, he weeds and prunes off her corruptions. Every plant, or member is required to bring forth much fruit. And to what distress, spiritual drought, and everlasting dan∣ger, doth their want of it expose them! How often, for cumbering his ground, for living unprofitably and wickedly in his church, doth he cut down professors, and cast them into endless sire! How often, for their spiri∣tual barrenness, and noxious corruptions, he unhingeth particular churches! takes away their hedge of protec∣tion and government! gives them up to Heathenish, and other abominations! and suffers the wild beasts of wicked men to waste and deform them at pleasure! No∣where are such noxious weeds, such corruptions produ∣ced, as in an uncultivated church. How quickly the nettles and briers of heresies, hateful practices, and wicked men cover her face, and render her a lodging of Satan, and his serpentine seed! The church is indeed smaller, but more useful than all the rest of the world. For, like a <HI>vineyard of red wine,</HI> amidst bloody persecu∣tions, she produceth persons and works, which cheer the heart of God and man: Like an <HI>orchard of pome∣granates, spikenard, and all the chief spices,</HI> she produceth saints unnumbered, precious, savoury, and useful, and in attainments and conditions, very DIVersified. These bring forth the rich, fragrant, and medicinal spices, and fruits of holy graces and good works. The <HI>keepers</HI> and <HI>husband-men,</HI> to whom Christ lets out his vineyard, are her offi∣cers, who are to cultivate her, and return him proper revenues of honour for the talents, opportunities, and charge affigned them. How miserably did God destroy the Jewish keepers, who abused his prophets and servants, and murdered his Son; and gave the vineyard to the
<PB N="242" REF="246"/>
Gentiles! Christ's having her <HI>at Baal-Hamon,</HI> imports, that now the access to her is large; and multitudes enter. His <HI>having a thousand, and the keepers two hun∣dred,</HI> implies that he is to have the chief glory; and his ministers their respective subsistence and honour. His <HI>hiring labourers to work in her at the third, the sixth, the ninth, and eleventh hour,</HI> implies, that in different ages of the world, as the patriarchal, ceremonial, apo∣stolic, and millennial; and in very different seasons of life, his chosen are converted, and made to labour in his work; and at the end, all of them shall receive the <HI>penny,</HI> the enriching, the gracious reward of eternal life. From her various worshipping assemblies, she is sometimes re∣presented as <HI>gardens,</HI> or vineyards.</P>
<P N="31">31. She is compared to a SOWN FIELD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 1.—8. 24—30.</NOTE>. Jesus, her proprietor, sows her with the good seed of his word. Some of it falls on hearers, stupid, careless, and expo∣sing themselves to every temptation, as a <HI>way side;</HI> and, by Satan and his agents, is quickly devoured, and snatch∣ed from their memory and affection. Some of it falls upon hearers hard in heart as <HI>stony ground:</HI> who, though at first they receive it with joy and affection, and seem to commence a flourishing profession and practice, yet being scorched by persecution or trouble, they quickly wither. Some of it falls upon carnal worldlings, whose thorns, whose earthly cares and lusts, choke and render it unfruitful. Some of it falls upon renewed hearts, who, in very different degrees, bring forth fruit unto God. In her grows up the <HI>good wheat,</HI> the saints sown by Jesus Christ; and the <HI>tares,</HI> hypocrites, and seducers, sown by Satan in the night of ignorance, indifferency, trouble, or time. Nor men, nor angels, can, or are now DIVinely warranted, fully to separate the <HI>tares</HI> from the <HI>wheat.</HI> But, at the last-judgment, a full, a final separation shall be effected; the saints being gathered into God's hea∣venly storehouse, and the wicked cast into unquench∣able fire.</P>
<P N="32">32. She is compared to a THRESHING FLOOR <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. iii. 12</NOTE>. Here the corn of precious saints, and the chaff of hypo∣critical dissemblers are mingled together in her; nay, the
<PB N="243" REF="247"/>
corn of grace and chaff of corruption cleave close to one another; and by threshing influences, troubles, and per∣secutions, her ordinary attendants, must the chaff be gradually separated from the wheat. In her, how quickly one generation passeth away, and another cometh in their stead! Blessed Boaz, it is thine to lodge on this thy <HI>floor,</HI> which thou hast chosen, purchased, and prepa∣red. It is thine to purge it with the fan of thy word, of thine influences, and of stormy providences. What chaffy multitudes of rebellious Jews, and apostate Chri∣stians, have thy fanning judgments hurried into fearful destruction! What millions shall thy trying procedure at the last day blow into endless ruin!—Be thou, my soul, solid grain, that no trouble, nor death, nor the eternal judgment, may blow me away from Christ and his saints.</P>
<P N="33">33. The gospel-church resembles the INHERITANCE OF ISRAEL, in Ezekiel's vision <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek xlvii. and xlviii and xlv. and xlvi.</NOTE>. All her borders are exactly circumscribed in the purpose, the covenant, and word of God. In her the true Israelites, his chosen people, reside. How noted the regularity and harmony of their respective stations and conditions! How often do Danites, distinguished and early sinners, become the first, and the most highly privileged saints! What equal access for Jews and Gentiles to her fellowship! What shares of common gifts and grace, sojourning hypocrites often obtain! How regularly is their proper work, pro∣vision, and honour, assigned to her officers, her priests, and Levites! With what equity do, or shall those ru∣lers execute her government and laws! How active and successful shall they be, as <HI>fishers of men</HI> in the dead sea of this world! How glorious are her watering and fruc∣tifying truths, institutions, and influences, which, issu∣ing from the temple, and through the death of Jesus our Lord, do, in different periods, gradually increase, and on every hand produce <HI>multitudes of trees,</HI> of lively, flourishing, and fruitful saints! How deplorable their end, who reap no benefit thereby! They shall be cursed into sourness, into barrenness, and endless ruin! In her how high the honour; how abundant the portion of her prince and Mediator; at whose expence, her feasts, her
<PB N="244" REF="248"/>
ordinances, are observed! In midst of her dwells JEHO∣VAH, and shares the centrical portion, the supreme ho∣nour and glory of all.</P>
<P N="34">34. She, especially in the latter days, resembles the NEW JERUSALEM in John and Ezekiel's visions <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. and xxii. 1. 2. Ezek. xl. 2. and xlviii. 30. 10 35.</NOTE>. Her <HI>descending from God out of heaven,</HI> marks her hea∣venly, her DIVine erection, nature, and tendency. Her situation on the <HI>south side of an hill,</HI> may denote her free∣dom from the chilling blasts of persecution and trouble; and her eminent enjoyment of the influences of her all-warming Sun of righteousness. Her appearance as a <HI>jusper-stone,</HI> imports her purity and comeliness. Her <HI>high wall round about,</HI> is her DIVinely-prescribed laws and government; and her DIVinely-bestowed salvation and protection from wo. Her <HI>twelve gates of pearl,</HI> three towards each airth, mark out Jesus as equally accessible to finners from every end of the earth. Her <HI>twelve foundations of different precious stones,</HI> represent him, and his glorious truths, declared by his apostles, as suited to support sinners in every case. Her <HI>sour-square</HI> form, signifies her stability, comeliness, and order. Her being <HI>eighteen thousand measures round about,</HI> and having <HI>twelve thousand furlongs on every side,</HI> import her nume∣rous members, and vast extent. Her having <HI>no temple in her,</HI> denotes the abolishment of the Jewish ceremonies. Her having no <HI>need of the sun, the moon, or the light of a candle,</HI> signifies her having no need of temporal pow∣er, worldly pomp, and dim ceremonies. Her <HI>river of life in the midst,</HI> is the gospel and Spirit of Christ. Her <HI>tree of life</HI> is Christ himself. Her <HI>streets and broad ways</HI> are his ordinances. Her <HI>light</HI> is the Lord God and the Lamb. Into her shall multitudes come, and obtain di∣vine light, knowledge, joy, and happiness; and from her special fellowship, shall wicked and scandalous per∣sons be carefully secluded: and this shall be her <HI>name,</HI> her <HI>renown,</HI> the LORD IS THERE; there DIVine persons delightfully reside; there DIVine perfections are signally displayed, and DIVine gifts and graces bountifully con∣ferred.</P>
<P N="35">35. She, especially in the latter days, corresponds
<PB N="245" REF="249"/>
with the TEMPLE in Ezekiel's vision <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xl. to xliv.</NOTE>. How sur∣rounded with the strong <HI>wall</HI> of DIVine perfections, of love, and power! of salvation and government! How exactly every thing in her is <HI>measured</HI> according to the <HI>line</HI> and <HI>reed</HI> of God's purpose and word! Its <HI>stairs</HI> of ascent at the thresholds, signify our gradual increase in gifts and grace; and our gradual entrance into the vi∣sible and invisible church, and to fellowship with God; and the various means of obtaining it. The <HI>courts</HI> may represent the church as visible; the <HI>sanctuary,</HI> in her in∣visible state, or the <HI>outward court,</HI> may signify her vi∣sible, and the <HI>inner court</HI> her invisible state. The <HI>sanctuary</HI> her eminent fellowship with God in Christ. And the <HI>separate building</HI> at the west end, the eternal state of glory, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; nor hath it entered into the heart of men to conceive of. The <HI>side-chambers</HI> of the temple and court, may signify particular churches, worshipping assemblies, and institu∣ted ordinances, where Jesus resides, and reveals his my∣steries; protects and allows intimate fellowship to his people. <HI>The enlarging of the upper stories of some of these chambers, by their jutting into the principal wall,</HI> implies, that the more holy, heavenly, and dependent upon God, churches and persons are, in attending ordi∣nances, the more extensive is their gospel-liberty. The <HI>priests chambers in the outward court towards the north,</HI> may mark their distinct functions in the church; or the Protestant churches in Europe and North America. Their <HI>narrowing as they ascended,</HI> implies their being the more exposed to persecution, according to their emi∣nency; or that, in the Protestant churches, there shall be great decays, as to number and quality; and that in the second, and especially the third age after the Reforma∣tion, few eminent members or ministers shall be therein found. The <HI>void places between and before the chambers,</HI> may represent the abundant access there is to Christian churches and ordinances; the light, liberty, and whole∣some air of influence there enjoyed; and that our whole life is to be an improving of ordinances past, and a pre∣paration for these in view. The <HI>equal size of the cham∣bers,</HI> exhibits the equal privileges, power, and authority
<PB N="246" REF="250"/>
of churches and ministers; and the substantial identity of ordinances. The <HI>posts and pillars</HI> in this temple, may represent fundamental truths, evangelical promises, faith∣ful ministers, and zealous saints; which establish and strengthen the church. <HI>Cherubims and palm trees al∣ternately mixed,</HI> may represent ministers and saints at∣tended by angels; and all prying into the mysteries of redemption, stying in the active service of God, or pa∣tiently bearing loads of labour and trouble, and obtain∣ing victory over spiritual enemies. The <HI>foundations and pavement</HI> may represent Christ, and his inspired oracles, as the foundation of the church, and of every true mem∣ber, grace, and good work, therein. The large <HI>gates, doors,</HI> and <HI>porches,</HI> signify Christ as the means of our abundant access to God. But the <HI>porch of the sanctuary</HI> may exhibit him as a supporter, hiding-place, and house of prayer, for his people: and the appropriation of <HI>the east gate to the prince alone,</HI> may signify, that he alone approacheth straight forward to God, by his own merit; and is the Head of the church, who may go in and out from his people and ordinances, as he pleaseth. <HI>The windows</HI> may represent ministers and ordinances, by means of which we share the light and air of life. The <HI>identity of things, and measures on various sides,</HI> ex∣hibits the identity of Christ, and his word and ordinan∣ces; and the similarity of his people in every part of the world. The <HI>altar of burnt-offering,</HI> represents Jesus in his all-purchasing blood and righteousness. <HI>That of incense</HI> represents him in his all-procuring intercession. The <HI>chamber for washing the sacrifices,</HI> may denote the ordinance of baptism, in which the saints, these spiritu∣al oblations, are washed by the blood and Spirit of the Lamb. The <HI>eight tables of hewn stone, with the knives on them,</HI> may signify the DIVinely appointed, the stand∣ing, and often-dispensed sacrament of the Lord's supper, in which Christ crucified, and our sins, the cause of his death, are affectingly presented to our spiritual view. And may not the <HI>flesh-hooks</HI> denote the promises and or∣dinances of the gospel, as exhibiting and bringing near to us, our crucified Redeemer? May not the <HI>singers and Levites</HI> signify true Christians, who rejoice in, bless the Lord, and labour in his service? May not the <HI>priests</HI>
<PB N="247" REF="251"/>
signify ministers, who present Christ to us; and saints, who by faith present him to God, and surrender them∣selves to his service? May not the <HI>five hundred reeds of measure on every side of the court,</HI> signify the extent of the church in the latter-days; and the considerable di∣stinction to be kept up between her and the world? Doth not <HI>the whole limit thereof round about, being most holy,</HI> import, that all her ordinances are holy and spiritual, not ceremonial and carnal; and that holiness ought to be the shining quality of every member in her?</P>
<P N="36">36. She is compared to an HOUSE or PALACE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. ix. 1.—5. Is. liv. 11. 12. Rev. iv. 6. and xv. 2.</NOTE>. Curiously Jesus contrived her whole form. Upon his own person, word, and righteousness, he lays her foun∣dation. With his chosen, his lively, and precious stones, hewn out of the dark quarry of nature, by his Spirit; quickened, formed, and polished by his grace; and, ce∣mented together by himself, his love, his blood, and or∣dinances, he rears her up. With sacred statutes, with provision of gospel-truth, with unsearchable blessings, he richly furnisheth her. What a place is she of secrecy, safety, rest, devotion, and spiritual feasting! To prevent her decay and ruin, how frequently is she repaired with new generations of saints, and supplies of grace! Her <HI>being founded on the tops of the mountains, and exalted above the hills,</HI> implies, that, remaining for ever founded on Jesus Christ, the Rock of salvation, she shall be most firmly and conspicuously settled in the world, that mul∣titudes may flow unto her. Her <HI>foundation of sapphires,</HI> is Christ, infinitely pure, precious, glorious, and durable; and his truths. Her <HI>pavement of fair coloured stones,</HI> is him as the all glorious foundation of our holy walk; or, it is saints of the lowest order beautified in him. Her <HI>windows of agates,</HI> may signify painful and success∣ful ministers, who convey light and knowledge to her, from her glorious Sun of righteousness, and her oracles of inspiration. Her <HI>doors and gates of carbuncles,</HI> are Jesus in his awful authority, fiery sufferings, and glori∣ous exaltation, as the means of our access to God; or they are a love-working and zeal-inflaming faith, by which we join ourselves to him and his church: and may they not also represent the zealous endeavours of
<PB N="248" REF="252"/>
ministers to try persons, and admit to sealing ordinances only such as are visibly saints, and faithful? Her <HI>borders of pleasant stones,</HI> are her precious, her comely, well fixed, and durable saints, ordinances, discipline, and go∣vernment. Her <HI>cedar beams and pillars,</HI> are the fragrant, firm, and lasting ministers, saints, promises, and ordi∣nances, by which she is adorned and supported. Her <HI>rafters and galleries of fir,</HI> are her shadowy, refreshful, and comely ordinances of DIVine grace, in which we ap∣prehend, retain, and walk with Christ. Her <HI>chambers</HI> represent her ordinances as the means of secret, sweet, and satisfying communion with Christ; and of his bless∣ing us with his peculiar protection and presence. Her <HI>wine-cellar, hanqueting house, and bed,</HI> are the scriptures, the covenant of grace, and especial fellowship with Christ; by which we are sweetly refreshed, strengthened, satisfied, delighted, instructed, and rendered fruitful in good works. Her <HI>table</HI> is the ordinances of God, on which his fulness is exhibited to us. Her <HI>throne of grace,</HI> is Jesus, as the fulfiller of all righteousness, in whom God is for ever well pleased and rests. <HI>The sea of glass before the throne, mingled with fire,</HI> on which the saints for ever stand, and are bold before God, is Jesus' all cleansing, all-supporting blood, as flowing from his flaming love, and applied by his <HI>Spirit of burning;</HI> or it is the gospel applied by the Spirit to our conscience, for encouraging us to bold appearances, and servent supplications before God.</P>
<P N="37">37. She is compared to an INN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 34.</NOTE>. For accomoda∣ting and refreshing the people of God in their heavenly journey, she is erected. In her, ministers are appoin∣ted to wait on the travelling saints, and afford them medicine, milk, or strong meat, as their case requires. Are not the two inspired Testaments; are not ministe∣rial gifts and graces, the <HI>two pence</HI> bestowed by our kind Samaritan upon these <HI>hosts</HI> on earth, for the assistance of his people? And is not everlasting glory their addi∣tional reward?—Beware, my soul, of resting in ordi∣nances or attainments; but hasten forward to thy long home, the <HI>better country</HI> above.</P>
<P N="38">38. She resembles a CHAMBER and BANQUETING∣HOUSE
<PB N="249" REF="253"/>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 4. and ii. 4.</NOTE>. How richly furnished with every thing comely and useful! with all the nourishing fulness of God! In her, how sweetly Jesus manifests himself to his people! feasts them with his goodness! allows them his intimate fellowship! reveals to them his secrets! and protects them from their enemies!</P>
<P N="39">39. She resembles a GREEN and WELL-GUARDED BED <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 16. and iii. 7. 8.</NOTE>. What sweet communion have the saints here with Christ, and with one another! How sweetly here be dwells, and rests in his love! With what amazing pleasure he here declareth it to us, and maketh us to enjoy its endearing fruits! Is it not here, that saints and graces are begotten; are born; are nourished; and ap∣pear with constant verdure, glory, and freshness! What armed guard of infinite perfections, of holy angels, and faithful ministers, surround her on every side; all deter∣mined, during her night of trouble and time, to protect her in safety, and to execute vengeance on her enemies.</P>
<P N="40">40. She is compared to a WALL <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song viii 9. 10.</NOTE>. Being esta∣blished in the faith of his word, cemented by his person and blood, and by their mutual love and spiritual fellow∣ship, her true members are built on Christ the founda∣tion. In them, and in her whole form, she is erected straight heavenward. How strong in him! and what an useful means of protecting men from the storms of temptation and wrath! What a separator between pro∣fessed saints and profane sinners! <HI>Her towers</HI> are the o∣racles, ordinances, and ministers of God; by which she opposeth her spiritual enemies, when they come in like a flood. <HI>The silver palace built upon her,</HI> implies her being the honoured habitation of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and that, by her means, we ascend to the celestial state.</P>
<P N="41">41. She is compared to a DOOR <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 9.</NOTE>. In her, Jesus the <HI>door,</HI> the way, the truth, and the life, is exhibited; and the <HI>door</HI> of faith, the door of gospel offers, and of mens hearts, is opened. She is the <HI>door</HI> of passage to the inner-chambers of endless felicity. Nor ought any, but visible saints, to be admitted into the chambers of her sealing institutions. And is she not DIVinely inclo∣sed
<PB N="250" REF="254"/>
with the <HI>cedar-boards</HI> of ordinances, providences, and graces!</P>
<P N="42">42. She is compared to a GOLDEN CANDLESTICK <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 20.</NOTE>. How great her beauty and value! From Christ the light of life her gifts and graces are lighted; and by her doctrine, discipline, and holy conversation, she com∣municateth the light of instruction to others. Her si∣tuation in the world is often varied; and in the morn∣ing of endless glory, her present form shall be laid aside. Her <HI>oil</HI> is the gospel and grace of God. The <HI>pipes</HI> of conveyance, are faithful minstrations of truth. The "two olive-trees, that empty the oil out of them∣selves," may signify ministers, who communicate go∣spel-truth to others; or Christ's natures and offices, by which the Holy Ghost is communicated to men.</P>
<P N="43">43. The church is like unto a FIRE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Obid 18.</NOTE>. In her dwells the Spirit of judgment and burning. In her, the word of God is like unto fire, inflaming and melting the hearts of men. In her, what multitudes are refined from their drossy corruptions! How terrible and de∣structive is she to her enemies!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Metaphors respecting Antichrist, and other false churches.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. CORRUPT Churches are called FLOCKS <HI>of Christ's companions</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 7.</NOTE>. In mighty numbers they are gathered, nourished, directed, and governed by his opposers and the doctrines, and laws to which they attend, and their customs and conduct, are the reverse of those that are appointed by him.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are called SYNAGOGUES OF SATAN <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 15. 16. Hos. viii. 8.</NOTE>. In them he dwells; and by them he is worshipped. In them his doctrines are believed; his laws observed; and his ordinances attended; and his followers assemble for fellowship in error, delusion, and wicked practices.</P>
<P N="3">3. They resemble LUKEWARM WATER, and a CAKE NOT TURNED <HI>(e).</HI> Pretending some regard to DIVine truths and ordinances, but wanting the love of them, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 9.</NOTE>
<PB N="251" REF="255"/>
they mix idolatry, and other corruptions, with some remains of God's true worship; they fear him, and serve their own god's; and so render themselves abominable to him and his people; and are in the utmost hazard of being spued out of his mouth, into everlasting ruin.</P>
<P>Why they are compared to <HI>old men</HI> with grey hairs without knowing it; and to <HI>roaring lions; rapacious birds; corrupt carcases; barren vineyards;</HI> and <HI>empty vines.</HI> See in Jews, chap. xiii. § 2. No 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Antichristian state, or Papacy, is called a MAN OF SIN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">a Thess. ii. 3.</NOTE>. How wonderfully it is connected in its parts! How marvellously all of them sympathize with, and support one another! What pretence it makes to reason, and to the advantage of mankind! The Pope, who overseeth, directs, and governs, is the head; his sub∣missive and wickedly-active clergy are the hands, and their common subjects the feet. And how monstrously sinful and wicked is the whole system of his doctrines, laws, worship, miracles, offices, officers, and courses!</P>
<P N="5">5. Antichrist is called the SON OF PERDITION <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. ii. 3. 2 Tim. iii. 1.—7.</NOTE>. By the destructive vengeance of God on men, for not receiving his truth in the love of it, was the rise thereof permitted. The Pope, and his thorough paced a∣gents, go about, seeking whom they may devour. Their doctrine, their laws, and example, effectually tend to the everlasting ruin of multitudes. Their beloved, their habitual labour, is to destroy the souls and bodies of men. The period of their power is a <HI>perilous time;</HI> for they have consciences seared as with a hot iron, igno∣rant, and stupified; they speak lies in hypocrisy; pro∣mote doctrines of devils, forbidding to marry, and to enjoy meats which God hath prepared for use; they are lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, blasphemers dis∣obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without na∣tural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, inconti∣nent, intemperate, fierce, heady, high minded, despi∣sers and haters of those that are good.</P>

what amazing craft, filthiness, and flattery do the Pope and his factors, seduce multitudes into error, ido∣latry, will worship, and other parts of spiritual whore∣dom with them! For this end, how they deck up their offices and cause, with the most plausible pretences to piety and reason! How they delude men with the most engaging outward appearances of earnal pomp and splendor! Under pretence of chastity, how they decry marriage, and yet wallow in all manner of uncleanness! The <HI>scarlet-coloured beast, with seven heads and ten horns,</HI> upon which she rideth, is the blasphemous and bloody empire of Rome, which had seven different forms of government; and is now DIVided into ten principal sovereignties, over which the Pope did, or doth ex∣ercise his power. <HI>The many waters on which she sitteth,</HI> are the noisy multitude of people, subject to her autho∣rity. Her <HI>purple and scarlet clothing,</HI> marks out the purple livery of her cardinals; her amazing pride; her high pretences to more than royal sovereignty; and her bloody presecution of the saints. The <HI>golden cup, full of filthiness, in her hand,</HI> is the unhallowed means which the taketh to ensnare and defile the souls of men. Her <HI>name on her forehead, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth,</HI> imports her high pretences to lying wonders, and her astonishing impudence in the filthiest crimes. Her being <HI>drunk with the blood of saints,</HI> implies her cruel and bloody persecution of them, her delighting to murder and mas∣sacre them. The <HI>burning of her flesh with fire by the ten kings once subject to her,</HI> implies their angry, utter, and fearful destruction of the Papal constitution, power and revenue, in the time appointed by God.</P>
<P N="7">7. Antichrist is called SODOM <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. What pride, ful∣ness of bread, and abundance of idleness, are with her numerous devotees! What shocking bestiality, Sodomy, fornication, adultery, and every other fleshly and mental impurity, prevail in Popish countries! Do not you, Antichristian clergy, for a pitiful price, allow men to practise the vilest abominations? What numbers of li∣censed stews are at Rome? Are you not lovers of plea∣sures more than lovers of God? How often you creep
<PB N="253" REF="257"/>
into mens houses, to defile their spouses and daughters with your whoredom and error! <HI>Past feeling,</HI> how you abandon yourselves to all uncleanness, to work it with greediness! And shall not you, and your followers, like Sodom, be set up as monuments of wrath, <HI>suffering the vengeance of eternal fire?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Antichrist is called EGYPT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 8.</NOTE>. How terrible is the Popish oppression of, and murdering the saints! How fearful their destruction of the souls of men! How shocking and cruel, the slavery of their subjects! How absurd their superstition! How base their idolatry in worshipping waxen wafers, images of a cross, relics of dead men, pretended or real, old rags, or chips of wood, <HI>&amp;c.!</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Antichrist is called BABYLON THE GREAT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvii. 5.</NOTE>. How astonishing and wide-spread the Popish power and dominion! How did their agents captivate and en∣slave the nations and people of God! What magic, ido∣latry, superstition, persecution, and murder, abound among them! And shall not this state and system be overthrown by the special providence of God! and Rome, its principal seat, be reduced to a lasting ruin! The <HI>tenth part of this city ruined by an earthquake,</HI> is a part of the Romish state, perhaps Italy, overturned by the fearful judgments of God.</P>
<P N="10">10. Antichrist is compared to a BEAST <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiii.</NOTE>. What stupidity, absurdity, and ignorance, prevail in his doc∣trines, laws, and members! Its <HI>rising out of the sea,</HI> imports his obtaining of power amidst times of trouble, confusion, perplexity; and over multitudes of unsettled subjects of the Roman empire. Its <HI>seven heads,</HI> signify seven forms of government used at Rome, and issuing and concentering in the Papacy. Its <HI>ten horns,</HI> are the ten kingdoms subject to Popery. <HI>Names of blasphemy in the forehead,</HI> imply open reviling of God and his truths; and of Christ, in his office and work. Its <HI>feet of a bear,</HI> imply excessive cruelty; firm retention of votaries; and outrageous murder of men, in their soul, body, and name. Its <HI>appearance of a leopard,</HI> imports craft, cruelty, and being spotted with abominations un∣numbered. Its <HI>mouth of a lion,</HI> imports the roaring
<PB N="254" REF="258"/>
forth of frightful threatenings; and the powerful exer∣cise of devouring influence. The <HI>healing of one of its wounded heads,</HI> implies the restoration of power to the city of Rome in the person of the Pope, after the He∣ruli and others extirpated the imperial; or the restoring to him the power which he lost at the Protestant refor∣mation. This first beast represents Antichrist in his civil influence. His <HI>rising from the earth in form of an∣other beast,</HI> may denote the rise of his power ecclesiastic, from obscurity, by carnal means, and to promote earth∣ly and carnal ends. Its <HI>being like a lamb,</HI> imports his pretence to innocency, purity, and usefulness; and his usurpation of Christ's office as a Surety and Priest. Its <HI>two horns,</HI> denote his connected civil and ecclesiastic power and authority; or his power of order and doc∣trine, bniding and loosing, in the church. Its <HI>speaking like a dragon,</HI> imports his terrible curses, censures, ex∣communications, and interdicts against his opposers. <HI>His causing men to make and worship an image of the first beast,</HI> may signify his obliging them to reverence the poor shadow of authority restored to Rome by the Popish clergy. His <HI>mark in mens hands,</HI> implies their swearing to, or practising his abominations. His <HI>mark on their foreheads,</HI> implies their bold and daring profession of his errors, idolatry, and superstition. <HI>Six hundred three∣score and six, the number of his name,</HI> marks out the Latin church, whose Latin service was appointed in A. D. 666. The letters of this number from LATEI∣NOS and ROMIITH, that is, Latin and Romish. The apparently regular construction of this number, may denote the seeming regularity of the Antichristian sy∣stem of doctrines, offices, officers. Or (twenty five) the square-root of this number, may point out the arti∣cles of the Popish creed, and their multitude of other matters regulated by twenty-five.</P>
<P N="11">11. The Antichristian state is represented as a HABI∣TATION OF DEVILS, A CAGE OF EVERY UNCLEAN BIRD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xviii. 2.</NOTE>. In her Satan and his angels reign. Her principal mem∣bers are a kind of devils incarnate. Her whole system is constituted of unclean doctrines, worship, offices,
<PB N="255" REF="259"/>
officers, customs. Shall it not at length appear so to men? Shall not Rome, the revered seat of her dignity, become an unsightly desolation?</P>
<P N="12">12. The Antichristian state is represented as a VISIBLE WORLD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi.</NOTE>. Her <HI>earth</HI> may signify her fundamental articles of the pope's supremacy, infallibility, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Her <HI>sea,</HI> the honour and gain made by that religion. Her <HI>rivers and fountains,</HI> her learned men, and their writ∣ings in her defence. Her <HI>sun,</HI> the civil authority that animates and supports her. The <HI>seat of the beast,</HI> her general constitution; or the dwelling of the Pope. Her <HI>mountains and islands,</HI> her deep rooted remains of doc∣trine, worship, discipline, and government, together with her monasteries and consecrated dignities. Or may the <HI>earth</HI> signify Germany and Poland, these inland countries? the <HI>sea,</HI> Portugal, France, and Spain, which are almost surrounded with sea? the <HI>rivers and foun∣tains</HI> of water, the north parts of Italy, which abounds with rivers? the <HI>sun,</HI> the Emperor, or King of France, the <HI>seat of the beast,</HI> the middle part of Italy, perhaps the same with Aarmageddon? the <HI>islands and mountains,</HI> Sicily, Malta, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> The <HI>vials poured out thereon,</HI> and the <HI>Hail and earthquakes,</HI> are the terrible harassing, and overturning judgments of God, sent to destroy her.</P>
<P N="13">13. The POPE is compared to a GOD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. ii. 4.</NOTE>. By adding to, or taking from the word and worship of God; by pretending to pardon sin, or indulge men in it; by u∣surping Christ's headship over his church, and opposing his person, office, and grace; by usurping authority over the civil magistrate, enthroning and deposing him at pleasure; and by working pretended miracles to con∣firm their abominations, he and his agents set themselves in the room of, and <HI>exalt themselves above God.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. The Pope is called the ANGEL <HI>of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew and Greek is a destroyer</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. ix. 11.</NOTE>. Be∣ing sent, excited, and directed by Satan, he promotes the interests of hell; ripens multitudes for its everlasting destruction; and with amazing craft and vigour, per∣secuteth the saints, who oppose his designs; and is a
<PB N="256" REF="260"/>
fearful stumbling-block to the Jews, and ruinous plague to the Gentiles.</P>
<P N="15">15. He resembleth the KING in Daniel's vision, who <HI>doth according to his will, magnifies himself above every God,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dan. xi 36.—39. Rev. xix. 19.—21.</NOTE>. Making his own pleasure his sole su∣preme rule of conduct, he exalts himself above magi∣strates, angels, and the true God; blasphemes his Ma∣ker;—at once contemns the idols of the ancient Hea∣then, and the God of the primitive Christians. Lawful marriage he vilipends, and prohibits to his clergy. In∣stead of, and together with the true God, he honours the images of angels, the relics and pictures of saints; offers them rich presents; and, for gain, pretends to assign them their respective countries, cities, occupations, and cases, in which they are to oversee, protect, and bless. He rules over great multitudes, which being assembled by him, do, with him, fight against the Lord Jesus Christ; but, in the end, shall be wrathfully overcome, and ruined, and the followers of Jesus enriched with their spoil.</P>
<P N="16">16. He resembles the LITTLE HORN in Daniel's vi∣sion, <HI>which had eyes, spake perverse things and subdued three horns</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dan. vii. 8.</NOTE>. His power was inconsiderable at first, but he quickly made himself master of three sovereign∣ties, the dukedom of Rome, the exarchate of Ravenna, and the region of Pentapolis. With amazing craft and circumspection; with numerous spies, prying into the councils of men; with terrible blasphemy, boasting, perfecution, and curses, he did and doth promote his unhallowed interests.</P>

<P N="1">1. ALL nations are represented as the TWO SONS of a family <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxi 28.—32. Luke. xv. 11. 32.</NOTE>. The Jews are the ELDER, the Gentiles the YOUNGER. The former, God, by his word, required to <HI>work in the vineyard</HI> of his church. Fairly they engaged, and readily they promised, to serve him; but quickly broke their engagement. Long the latter lived in open rebellion; but, at last, influenced by his con∣verting grace, they repented and complied with his call. Long, like prodigals, they deserted their Father's fa∣mily and church, till deep sense of their spiritual need brought them to themselves, and made them enquire what they should do to be sayed. How readily then did JEHOVAH meet them in mercy! embraced them with love! arrayed them with the <HI>best robe</HI> of his sons righ∣teousness! feasted them with his flesh and blood! adorn∣ed them with his ordinances and influences! But why, ye Jews, did you repine at his honouring them above you, who had long been his peculiar children and ser∣vants! Was it not meet, that there should be an abun∣dant display of heavenly bounty and gladness, when God's so-long <HI>lost children were found?</HI> when your so∣long <HI>dead brethren were made alive?—</HI>Rejoice ye Gen∣tiles, with his people, for to him we seek; in him we trust; and his rest shall be glorious.</P>
<P N="2">2. All nations are compared to the SMALL DROP of a bucket, DUST <HI>of the balance,</HI> and NOTHING before God <HI>(a).</HI> How small, insignificant, unsubstantial, <HI>(b)</HI> Is. xl. 15. 17.

<P N="3">3. The Gentile nations, before the spread of the go∣spel, are called a LITTLE SISTER <HI>without breasts</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 8.</NOTE>. Though many of their progeny were chosen by, and in the purpose of God united to Christ; yet they made no appearance as a church, had no breasts of inspired ora∣cles, DIVine ordinances, or gospel-ministers, wherewith to edify the souls of men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Perhaps the Gentile nations are compared to a BARREN, DESOLATE, and <HI>refused</HI> WOMAN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. liv. 1. 4. 6. and lv. 1.</NOTE>. And they are called a NATION which <HI>Christ knew not.</HI> Before his death, they, for many ages, produced almost no children to him. They were deserted and rejected by him. He took no peculiar notice of them; brought them into no church-relation to him. But, blessed be the Lord, more have now been the spiritual children of this barren wo∣man, than ever were of the Jewish church.—But perhaps this <HI>barren woman,</HI> signifies the church during Christ's personal presence with her on earth. And the <HI>children of the desolate being more than they of the married wife,</HI> Implies, that after Christ's withdrawment to heaven, the converts to him should be most numerous.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Gentiles, before the spread of the gospel a∣mong them, are called FOREIGNERS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 20.</NOTE>. They were without visible interest in, or connection with God in Christ; and destitute of the offers of his grace, the doc∣trines of his word, or the laws of his kingdom. They had no spiritual fellowship with his holy nation; no claim to his covenants of promise; no hope of a Mes∣siah, or salvation by him, or of a resurrection to eternal life; but were destitute of the knowledge, the image, the fear, the worship, and saving fellowship of God. Thrice happy! that those, who were once afar off, are brought nigh by the blood of Christ! But ah! what multitudes of persons and nations still remain in that wretched condition!</P>
<P N="6">6. Nations without the church, before, or after the

Not plowed with his influence; nor fown with his word, ordinances, or grace; nor hedged about with his special government and protection: no <HI>way of holiness</HI> that leadeth to life; no flocks of con∣verted men, nor their footsteps; no sweet fruits of holy men, or truly righteous works; no wells of salvation; nor green pastures of evangelic institutions; no bread of life, were, or are there to be found.—But alas! what evil beasts! what wicked angels and men! what per∣plexity and unsettledness of mind, how to satisfy an immortal soul! what surrounding hazards of eternal consequence! what blasts of conquering temptation, and wrathful calamity! what mists of ignorance, idola∣try, profaneness, delusion, and will-worship abound!</P>
<P N="7">7. Particular nations are compared to the UNI∣VERSE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxiv. Mark xiii. 24. 25. Psal. lxxxii. 6. Rom. xiii. 4.</NOTE>. The more glorious part of their members and laws are the <HI>heavens,</HI> and <HI>luminaries</HI> thereof; and the rest the <HI>air,</HI> the <HI>earth,</HI> and the <HI>rivers.</HI> The magi∣strates are represented as <HI>God,</HI> as <HI>children,</HI> as <HI>ministers of God;</HI> because in his name, they rule over, and are re∣vered and obeyed by their subjects. The <HI>sword, which they bear not in vain,</HI> is their power and authority to protect the innocent, and punish the offenders.</P>
<P N="8">8. Particular nations are represented as FAMILIES <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxvii. 8. 9.</NOTE>. The country as the <HI>mother;</HI> the magistrates as <HI>fathers,</HI> who cherish, govern, protect, and provide for the people; who are the <HI>children,</HI> the <HI>sons,</HI> or <HI>daughters.—</HI>Sometimes the principal city is represented as the <HI>mo∣ther;</HI> and the lesser cities, suburbs, or villages, are termed the <HI>daughters.—</HI>Sometimes for likeness of man∣ners, natural relation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one nation is designed the <HI>sister</HI> of another.</P>
<P N="9">9. They are compared to HARLOTS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. xxiii. 15. 16. Nah. iii. 4. Ezek. xvi. and xxiii. Jer. iii.</NOTE>. What de∣ceitful and base methods they often take to promote their trade, their power and authority! How often they boast of, and seduce those around to, idolatrous and whorish departing from God! How justly God execu∣eth

<P N="10">10. They are compared to TRAVAILING WOMEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xxiii. 4. Jer. vi. 24. Hos. xiii. 12.</NOTE>. How often! how suddenly! how terribly pained, and tormented, with DIVine judgments! How often pained, in attempting to perform their purposes! How often they travail, without bringing forth any deliverance! How often they bring forth wickedness! Ye nations, how gracious are you <HI>when pangs</HI> of adversity <HI>come upon you!</HI> Then perhaps you return, and enquire right early after God; but how often then are you rejected by him!</P>
<P N="11">11. They are compared to <HI>animal bodies</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. vli. 14. 15. and i. 5. 6. and vii. 20. and xvii. 4. and xxix. xi. Lam. iv. 20.</NOTE>. Ma∣gistrates and honourable persons are the <HI>head,</HI> which adorns, directs, and manageth them. False teachers, and the low mob, are the <HI>tail</HI> and <HI>seet;</HI> most useless and contemptible. No <HI>soundness from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head,</HI> implies the sinful corruption, or the distress of all ranks, high and low. The <HI>head sick,</HI> and <HI>the heart faint,</HI> implies, that the rulers, and most ac∣tive and animating persons, are corrupted, perplexed, and discouraged. To <HI>shave off the hair of the beard, the head and feet,</HI> is shamefully to cut off, and carry captive, both great and small <HI>Fatness,</HI> implies abundance of men, wealth, or prosperity. <HI>Leanness,</HI> imports fewness of persons, and poverty of condition. <HI>Paleness,</HI> implieth shame and confusion. To <HI>wax old,</HI> is to lose courage, vigour, strength, or authority.—Magistrates are the <HI>breath of their nostrils,</HI> by which their life, vigour, and influence are maintained.</P>
<P N="12">12. They are represented as systems of BEASTS of the field, air, or sea <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dan. iv. 12. Ezck. xxix. and xxxi.</NOTE>.

Sometimes <HI>horns</HI> denote their kings, who defend their own subjects, and harass others.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="261" REF="265"/>
13. They are compared to HERDS and FLOCKS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxiii. Ezek. xxxiv.</NOTE>. The country is their fold and pasture. Magistrates are their <HI>shepherds,</HI> who watch over, protect, govern, and provide for their subjects. Great men are their <HI>rams, he-goats, bulls, kine;</HI> and if in prosperity rendering them conspicuous and strong, they are represented as <HI>fat</HI> or <HI>fed.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. They are likened to HEIFERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xv. 5. Jer. xlvi. 20. and xlviii. 34.</NOTE>. <HI>Fair</HI> and <HI>fat heifers</HI> represent them in their glory and prosperity. <HI>Heifers taught,</HI> represent them as accustomed to subjec∣tion. <HI>Backsliding heifers,</HI> represent them as perversely apostatizing from God. To cry, or <HI>lift up the voice, liks an heifer of three years old,</HI> is to cry and wail very bit∣terly and outrageously.</P>
<P N="15">15. They are compared to the FIRMAMENT, for their conspicuous appearance and glory <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi. 12. 13. 14. and viii. 10. 12.</NOTE>: for their di∣stinguished brightness and influence; rulers and great men are represented as the <HI>sun, moon,</HI> and <HI>stars.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. They are compared to a COUNTRY <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxii. 3.</NOTE>.

The constitution of government is the <HI>foundations.</HI> And DIVine judgments are represented as <HI>storms, droughts, earthquakes.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. They are compared to a SEA, or WATERS <HI>rush∣ing</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is. xvii. 12. Jer. xlix. 23. Rev. vii. 1. Is. lx. 5.

<P N="18">18. They are likened to a FOREST <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hos. ii. 12. Ezek. xx. 46.</NOTE>; because of the multitude of persons, cities, and villages.

state! Cities are the <HI>boughs</HI> and <HI>branches.</HI> Multitudes of people are the fruit. <HI>Two or three berries left,</HI> signi∣fy a small remnant saved in the vintage of desolating judgments.—A <HI>forsaken bough,</HI> is a desolate city. To <HI>glean, and turn the hand into the basket,</HI> is gradually to destroy, or lead captive the remnant left at the first. To <HI>plant the vineyard with strange slips,</HI> is to bring in foreign people, doctrines, or customs into a nation.—Lord, how easily canst thou plant or pluck up, destroy <HI>branch and rush, in one day!</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. They are likened to HEATH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 6. and xlviii 6.</NOTE>, to represent their barrenness; witheredness, and contemptibleness; and their not profiting by the means of prosperity or grace.</P>
<P N="21">21. They are likened to a CROP of corn <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xvii. 5.</NOTE>; for their multitude of persons; their comeliness; glory; and promising usefulness. <HI>Gleaning of ears,</HI> implies the care of a conquering enemy to kill, or carry captive, the whole nation.</P>
<P N="22">22. They are likened to STUBBLE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxiii. 13. Is. xlvii. 14. Jer. xiii. 24. Nah. i. 10.</NOTE>, to denote, that they are brought to the utmost contempt; are trodden down by their enemies; or have only an insignificant remnant left. They are represented as <HI>dry stubble,</HI> to imply their ripeness for the judgments of God, and no∣thing else. They are represented as <HI>stubble before the wind,</HI> to mark how easily and quickly they shall be driven out of their place.</P>
<P N="23">23. They are compared to CHAFF, or <HI>chaff of the moun∣tains</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. xvii. 13.</NOTE>, to represent how insignificant they are; how readily exposed to storms, and changes of lot; and that the higher they rise in pomp and greatness, the more obnoxious they are to ruin.

<HI>horns that scattered Judah,</HI> are the Samaritans, Am∣monites, Arabians, and other nations who harassed them, after the captivity. <HI>Ten horns</HI> upon one beast, signify ten kingdoms or sovereignties formed out of the Roman empire.</P>
<P N="25">25. They are likened to a POTTER'S VESSEL <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xviii. 1.—10.</NOTE>. It is thine, O JEHOVAH, to form them as thou pleasest; thine to appoint them to honour or dishonour. How base are they in themselves! but how curious thy forma∣tion of them!

<P N="1">1. THE Jews are likened to an ELDER SON <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 11. 26.—32. Matth xxi. 28.</NOTE>. They were God's <HI>first-born;</HI> first of the na∣tions, he distinguished them in his favour: readily they professed the highest regard to the DIVine law, and came under the most solemn engagements to obedience; yet after continuing many ages in peculiar relation to God, they wilfully despised his counsel, and rejected the Mes∣siah; sinfully they fretted, and many of them blasphe∣med, because, under the gospel, the Gentiles were more highly favoured of God than themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. They resemble the RICH MAN in the parable <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 19.—31.</NOTE>. Glorying in their wealth, their numerous rites and tra∣ditions; their relation to God, and their pious ancestors; they contemptuously rejected the debased Saviour; while unclean publicans, harlots, and Heathens, received him. Notwithstanding all their pomp, the flaming vengeance of God came upon them. Terrible and hopeless were the torments and miseries into which they were plunged; nor could the covenant made with Abraham their ance∣stor yield them any relief; nor could their desperate

wishes obtain further evidence of Jesus Messiahship, for themselves, and their various sects; or for their bre∣thren of the ten tribes.</P>
<P N="3">3. They are likened to an INFANT <HI>lying in blood; vile, unpitied, unassisted of men, but quickened, furnished, a∣dorned, and espoused of God</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xvi. 1.—15.</NOTE>. Not for their righ∣teousness' sake, but for his name's sake, he raised them up from an idolatrous, polluted, and despicable origin. Marvellously he preserved and multiplied them into a nation in Egypt. Though they were contemned and hated of all around, he honoured them with his peculiar favours and laws; entered into solemn covenant with them; supported their arms of power and influence, and taught them to walk in his law; gave them a pleasant land flowing with milk and honey; formed them into the then only church; and into one of the most honour∣able kingdoms that ever existed.</P>
<P N="4">4. They are likened to a DELICATE WOMAN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 2.</NOTE>. How proud of their distinguished privileges! How un∣prepared for, and unable to endure adversity, when they were exposed to it by the Chaldeans!</P>
<P N="5">5. They are represented as a MOTHER AND FAMILY IN BONDAGE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 25.</NOTE>; to mark out their subjection to the ceremonial law; their lying under the power of sin, Sa∣tan, and the broken law; and their exposure to sad distress and slavery for their rejecting of Christ.</P>
<P N="6">6. They are likened to an HARLOT <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ezck. xvi. and xxiii. Jer. iii.</NOTE>. Contrary to equity, to decency, and to solemn covenant with God, they forsook his law, worshipped idols, and polluted themselves with every abominable course. Treacherously they distrusted and rejected the Lord, imitated the ido∣latry, and relied on the assistance of the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Chaldeans. For a while, these of Judah and Benjamin condemned the enormities of Sodom and of the ten tribes; but, though warned by their destruc∣tion, they at last surpassed them in wickedness, and so justified their conduct. They had a <HI>whore's forehead,</HI> rushing impudently on sin; and of their own motion, and at their own expence, seeking after sinful connection with the Heathen, and communion with them in their
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>
false worship. Long God hired them with a goodly land, and favours innumerable, to be for him and not for another; but, provoked with their treacherous crimes, he punished them by the hand of those nations which they had so fondly relied on, and imitated: he cast them out of their church relation to him, and refused to shew them mercy. But rejoice, you feed of Jacob, you shall be as though you had not been cast off. In the wilder∣ness of adversity God shall speak unto your heart; and make you return to your former husband, with whom it was better with you than now. "Though the vision tarry, wait for it; for at the end it will speak, and will not tarry."</P>
<P N="7">7. They are represented as a WOMAN <HI>cast into the midst of an ephah, with a talent of lead above her, and carried by winged women to the land of Shinar</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. v. 5.—11.</NOTE>; to denote, that after filling up the measure of their ini∣quity, God should cause them to feel the fearful weight thereof, and by his blast of wrath, and instruments there∣of, should carry them out of Canaan, and for many ages fix them in a state of dispersion, unsettledness, and fearful misery.</P>
<P N="8">8. They are likened to a <HI>person with</HI> GREY HAIRS, <HI>without knowing it</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hos. vii. 9.</NOTE>. What tokens of weakness and guilt! what signs of approaching ruin were among the ten tribes before their captivity! What multitudes of prevailing abominations! What furious contentions! What murdering of kings and nobles! What multi∣tudes of lesser judgments unsuccessful, none of which were laid to heart!</P>
<P N="9">9. They are likened to a person HALF STRIPPED of her clothing <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiii. 22. to 26.</NOTE>. When the Chaldeans invaded their country, and led them captive, how was their land strip∣ped of her inhabitants! and they stripped of their wealth, their honour, their safety! How exposed to shame and disgrace! And what abominable filthiness was revealed by their punishment!</P>
<P N="10">10. They are compared to the <HI>men of</HI> SODOM <HI>and</HI> GOMORRAH <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. i. 10.</NOTE>. How abandoned to unnatural lust! How shameless in sinning! How ready their people to

<P N="11">11. They are likened to a SPECKLED BIRD, against which all the fowls around assembled <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xii. 9.</NOTE>. How distin∣guished from others, by their ordinances, laws, and cu∣stoms! And how hated, and sought for to destruction, by the nations around! And, alas! how spotted with their own corruptions! But the word rather signifies a TALONED RAPACIOUS FOWL, and represents them as ready to persecute God's saints; ready to abuse his mercies, by flying in his face, breaking his laws, and tearing his honours; on which account, he gathered the nations against them, to destroy them.</P>
<P N="12">12. They are represented as LIONS, as RORING LIONS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mic. v. 8. Jer. xii. 8. Ezek. xix.</NOTE>. In their ancient glory, and in the time of the Maccabees they did; and, in their return from their present dispersion, they shall boldly encounter and sur∣mount every difficulty, subdue every opposer, strike ter∣ror and dismay into all around. But in the days of Je∣remiah, how outrageously they roared against God, his prophets, his ordinances, his word, and providences! Their state is likened to a LIONESS. After Josiah's death, she furnished the throne with Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Je∣heiachin, and Zedekiah; who, for their outrageous op∣pression of their people, their roaring against God and his servants, and the like, are called <HI>lions;</HI> and by the kings of Egypt, and Babylon, were successively taken, removed from their station, and disqualified for injuring their subjects.</P>
<P N="13">13. They are likened to WILD ASSES and DROMEDA∣RIES <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 23. 24.</NOTE>. Refusing subjection to the yoke of God's law, they vainly wandered after their own fancies, snuff∣ed up the hurtful and unsubstantial idolatries and delu∣sions of the Heathen; lustfully traversed all their ways, unsettledly following now, one idol and wicked course; anon, another.</P>
<P N="14">14. They are likened to a THRESHING OX, <HI>with horns of iron, and hoofs of brass</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mic. iv. 13.</NOTE>. In the time of the Mac∣cabees they did; in the beginning of the millennium,

they shall, by the assistance of Heaven, push off, resist, and tread down their opposers.</P>
<P N="15">15. They are likened to WILD BULLS <HI>in a net</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. li. 20.</NOTE>. How filled with perplexity and rage, when God brought them into the entangling bands of the Assyrians and Chaldeans! With what brutish stupidity, they poured forth their roaring complaints! How effectually every attempt to rescue themselves, entangled them more and more!—Ah! how like my soul under trouble!</P>
<P N="16">16. They are likened to an HEIFER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hos. x. 10. 11.</NOTE>. God <HI>taught them,</HI> by giving them his laws. He <HI>passed over their fair neck,</HI> by encouraging them with prosperity, or by alarming them with adversity. He made <HI>Ephraim to ride,</HI> by strengthening the ten tribes against Judah in the days of Jeroboam the second, and of Pekah the son of Remaliah; or made them <HI>to be rode upon,</HI> by giving the Assyrians power to captivate and oppress them. Judah's <HI>ploughing,</HI> and Jacob's <HI>breaking his clods,</HI> may import the Jews slavery in Chaldea. Their <HI>ploughing wickedness, reaping iniquity, and eating the fruit of lies,</HI> imply their proceeding from evil to worse, and receiving at last the due reward of their crimes; when like <HI>back∣sliding heisers,</HI> they had long persisted in obstinate apo∣stacy from God.</P>
<P N="17">17. They are represented as <HI>abused, lost, and scatter∣ed sheep</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. 16. Jer. l. 6. 7.</NOTE>.

How, in their captivity, driven from their pasture in the promised land! scattered one from another! exposed to injuries unnumbered! destitute of order, and without solemn assembling to worship! Once, what a <HI>beautiful flock,</HI> a comely church and nation, cared for, nourished, and protected of God! But, especially since the death of Christ, what a <HI>flock of slaughter</HI> and misery!</P>
<P N="18">18. They are likened to VIPERS; SERPENTS; SPI∣DERS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. lix. 5. 6.</NOTE>. How full of deathful malice and corruption! How desperately set upon, and crafty in doing mischief! Their idolatrous courses, and laboured schemes of self-preservation, were a <HI>weaving of spiders webs;</HI> might en∣tangle others, but were insufficient for every good pur∣pose.
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>
Nay, as <HI>cockatrice eggs, breaking forth into vipers,</HI> infallibly procured their ruin.</P>
<P N="19">19. Particular tribes of Israel are likened to particu∣lar ANIMALS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gen. xlix. Deut. xxxiii. 17. 21. 22.</NOTE>. Judah to a LION, because of their distinguished royalty, power, and furious destruction of of their enemies. Joseph's seed to a YOUNG BULLOCK, because of their glory, their strength; and their royalty among the ten tribes. Ah, how changed, when, like <HI>silly doves without heart,</HI> without hope, wisdom, or care, to avoid the destruction and ravage of the Assyrian bands! Issachar to an ASS, for their strength, patience, and la∣bour in husbandry. Dan to a LIONS WHELP <HI>and</HI> SERPENT, for their daring courage in war, and their craft in de∣stroying their enemies. How like a <HI>lion's whelp,</HI> when leaping to the borders of Bashan, to take Laish! How, in Samson, did they, like a <HI>serpent,</HI> bite the horse heels, and make the Philistines on their temple, and otherwise, to fall backward! Benjamin to a <HI>ravening</HI> WOLF, for their warlike courage, and their readiness to take the prey from their enemies. Naphthali to a HIND <HI>let loose,</HI> because of their kind and lovely behaviour, their bra∣very in war, and their expedition in business. Gad to a LION, because of their daring boldness, and their safe dwelling beside enemies.—Ah, how sin changed the con∣dition of those Jews! made them under trouble <HI>roar like bears; mourn sore like doves; hiss as serpents; wail as dragons;</HI> and <HI>enlarge their baldness as eagles!</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. They are likened to the HAIRS of a man's head <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek. v. 1.—4.</NOTE>. How weak and insignificant! The <HI>shaving</HI> or <HI>cutting them off,</HI> imports the killing or carrying them captive; or the unhinging of their church and state by the Chaldeans. The <HI>third part burnt in the midst of the city, pourtrayed by Ezekiel on a tyle,</HI> represent about a <HI>third part</HI> killed by famine and pestilence within Jeru∣salem, during its siege by the Chaldeans. The <HI>third part</HI> smitten about with a knife, represent them who were slain by the Chaldeans. The <HI>third part scattered in the wind,</HI> represent them who were taken captive; a <HI>sew of which</HI> being left in the land, and by their going down to Egypt, and thus bringing upon themselves the suspicion of having murdered Gedaliah, Nebuchadnez∣zar's

<P N="22">22. They are likened to BARREN FIG-TREES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 6.—9. Matth. xxi. 19. Jer. xxiv.</NOTE>.

For forty years after his death, his intercession procured the sparing of them, till by his gospel, and lesser strokes, he had <HI>digged and dunged about</HI> them. But continuing barren, they were, by the axe of the Roman troops, cut down, and <HI>quickly withered away</HI> under his curse.

<P N="23">23. They are likened to a VINEYARD and VINE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. v. 1.—6. Ezek. xv. Deut. xxxii. 32. 33.</NOTE>. God gave them the fertile land flowing with milk and honey. The stony and stubborn Canaanites he digged out from before them. The <HI>wall</HI> and <HI>hedge</HI> of his pro∣tection and law he assigned to them. The <HI>wine press</HI> of his tabernacle, temple, and ordinances, he built among them. With the <HI>rain</HI> of his oracles, the <HI>dew</HI> of his fa∣vours, he watered them. Originally they were a <HI>right seed;</HI> a <HI>choice vine;</HI> the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God's friends, who commanded their households to walk in the way of the Lord; but how sadly they <HI>degenerated into the plant</HI> of a <HI>strange vine;</HI> became like the Heathens around!

without good fruit, and so only fit for, and exposed to the fiery vengeance of God <HI>bringing forth fruit to them∣selves,</HI> seeking their own carnal ends, not the glory of God, in whatever they did.

<P N="24">24. They are likened to DEW, and represented as a BLESSING amidst the nations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mic. v. 7. Is. xix. 24.</NOTE>.

<P N="25">25. They are likened to STICKS or STAVES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvii. 16.—19. Zech. xi. 7. 10. 14.</NOTE>. The <HI>joining of two sticks,</HI> denotes the uniting of the posteri∣ty of Judah and Benjamin, after their Chaldean or pre∣sent captivity, with the other ten tribes. The <HI>staff of beauty</HI> is the blessed gospel granted to them; or the glorious constitution of their church and state. The <HI>staff of bands</HI> denotes their mutual affection and harmony. The <HI>breaking of these two staves,</HI> imports God's depri∣ving them of the gospel, and of their ecclesiastic and na∣tional state, and giving them up to furious contentions and disorder. The <HI>instruments of a foolish shepherd,</HI> de∣note the ruinous devices of their leaders and pretended Messiahs; or the oppressive measures of the Romans and others towards them.—Lord, these who despise thee, shall be utterly ruined and contemned.</P>
<P N="26">26. They are represented as a CARCASE <HI>gathered to by the eagles</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 34.</NOTE>.

<PB N="271" REF="275"/>

The appearance, the hope, and the desire of their restora∣tion, were almost extinct But by Cyrus' proclamation, and the influence of Heaven, their graves of distress were opened; the impediments in their way were removed; their spirits were animated to return to their country, and resettle their nation. At present their condition is still more wretched, and apparently hopeless; but by the <HI>wind</HI> of the Holy Ghost, and the favourable <HI>breath</HI> of smiling providences, shall God recover them from it. Lord, hasten thy work, that we may see it.</P>
<P N="28">28. They are represented as REPROBATE SILVER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 30.</NOTE>. In Jeremiah's time, and at present, amidst all their fair pretences, how useless and unworthy!

<P N="29">29. They are likened to BOTTLES <HI>filled with wine</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiii. 12.</NOTE>. By the Chaldean troops God filled them with calamity, perplexity, and astonishment. And ah! what <HI>broken bottles;</HI> whose breaches God alone could heal and repair!</P>
<P N="30">30. They are represented as a VESSEL, <HI>wherein is no pleasure</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hos. viii. 8.</NOTE>. How wretched, base, and shameful, their captive state!

<P N="33">33. JERUSALEM, their principal city; and Samaria, the metropolis of the ten tribes, are represented as MOUN∣TAINS or HILLS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. viii. 3. Amos vi. 1.</NOTE>; because they were built on hills; and were conspicuous in glory and wealth.</P>
<P N="34">34. Jerusalem is represented as a <HI>city pourtrayed on a tile</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek. iv. 1.—8.</NOTE>; to signify its contemptible and weak condition before the Chaldeans took it. The <HI>iron pan</HI> surrounding this protrait, signified God's determinate purpose to punish the inhabitants; and the Chaldeans fixed rage against, and their safe and determined siege of the city. Ezekiel's "lying three hundered and ninety days be∣fore this portrait on his left side, and forty on his right to bear the iniquity of Israel and Judah," signified that in the Chaldean destruction of Jerusalem, God would have an eye to the Jews continuance for <HI>three hundred and ninety years,</HI> in approving the sin of the ten tribes; and their having grievously rebelled themselves, during <HI>forty years</HI> of Manasseh's reign, or from the thirteenth year or Josiah, to the eleventh of Zedekiah.</P>
<P N="35">35. She is compared to a FOUNTAIN <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 7.</NOTE>. Ah how herinhabitants cast forth and diffused wickedness, through every part of their conduct! and spread evil courses in∣to the cities and country around!</P>

<P N="38">38. She is called a CUP OF TREMBLING and BURDEN∣SOME STONE to her enemies <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. xii. 2. 4.</NOTE>. What terror and overthrow did the Maccabees spread among her besi∣gers and enemies! How happy, firm, and fixed, shall be the Jews millenial state! With what oppressing trou∣ble, madness, astonishment, and ruin, shall God smite their opposers, who attempt to exclude them from their ancient land!</P>
<P N="39">39. The JEWISH PRINCES are likened to LIONS; and their judges to RAVENING WOLVES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mic. iii. 2. 3.

Their "eating the flesh of God's people; flaying off their skin; breaking their bones in pieces," imply, their taking every me∣thod to oppress and deprive them of their substance. Their <HI>not gnawing the bones in the morning,</HI> imports their voracious delight in cruelty; and speedy execution of it without delay.</P>
<P N="40">40. The Jewish governors are likened to a HEARTH OF FIRE <HI>among wood;</HI> and a TORCH OF FIRE <HI>in a sheaf</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Zech. xii. 6.</NOTE>.

<P N="3">3. They are likened to FISHES <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxix 3.—5.</NOTE>.

<HI>and fro,</HI> to shew himself strong in the behalf of such as fear him. By the <HI>breathing</HI> of his powerful influence, he quickens and restores; and by the angry <HI>blast of his nostrils,</HI> are men consumed.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is represented as God's WAY; PATH; GOINGS; and FOOTSTEPS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxvii. 19.</NOTE>. Herein with pleasure he display∣eth his power, and gradually fulfils his purpose. He <HI>cometh</HI> to men, to relieve, comfort, and punish them.

To <HI>look after God;</HI> or <HI>see his goings,</HI> is, with reverence, attention, and delight, to observe, consider, and remem∣ber the works of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. God's providence is compared to CLOUDS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xix. 1. Psal. xcvii. 2.</NOTE>. How lofty; marvellous; and incomprehensible! How pregnant with events! How swift and DIVinely directed the motions of it! To the wicked, how terrible the in∣fluence, and sometimes the appearance!

<P N="5">5. It may be compared to WHEELS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. i.</NOTE>; to represent the quick and easy motion; and the mysterious nature, and frequent changes of it. How quickly it humbles the lofty, and exalts such as are low! Like the wheels of a machine, how exactly it regulates all things in na∣ture! These wheels having <HI>four faces,</HI> may mark out providence, as respecting all the ends of the earth; and as exercised with great tenderness, patience, knowledge, and power. Their <HI>uniform likeness,</HI> imports the uniform tendency of providences. Their appearance as of a <HI>wheel within a wheel,</HI> imports its mysterious and intricate conduct.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Metaphors respecting God's covenants with man.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. <HI>Metaphors respecting the covenant of works.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE covenant of works made with Adam, and all his seed in him, is called a LAW <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19. 10.</NOTE>. It comprehended the whole duty of man; was inforced with DIVine authority; was not an agreement betwixt, equals, but enjoined by God to man as his subject. It is called a <HI>fiery law.</HI> Amidst fiery flames, it was pub∣lished from Sinai; it occasions fiery rage in our heart against God; and worketh for us, a fiery and everlast∣ing ruin. It is a law <HI>weak through the flesh,</HI> as by reason of our corruption, it cannot justify or save us. It is a <HI>law of sin and death,</HI> as by it the offence abounds; and sin reigns unto death, temporal, spiritual, and eternal.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is represented as a RIGID MASTER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 8.</NOTE>. How extensive and hard are its requirements of us! Without affording or allowing us any spiritual strength, or nou∣rishment, it demands that we should perfectly fulfil its precepts, holy, just, and good, spiritual, and exceeding broad; and satisfy its unbounded penalty for our past offences. If we continue not in all things commanded; if we keep it not constantly in every point and degree; it curseth us to endless misery; and employeth our con∣science to eondemn, lash, and torment us.—Alas! O Je∣sus, how long I foolishly preferred this hard bondage to thy easy yoke and light burden!</P>
<P N="3">3. It is represented as a HUSBAND <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 1.—4.</NOTE>. We were so∣lemnly married to it in Adam. Heartily we approve the match, going about to establish our own righteous∣ness; and, notwithstanding its rigour, and the danger attending our connection with it, how desperately we cleave to it, live under it, and pretend attempts to ful∣fil
<PB N="294" REF="298"/>
it, till Jesus, by applying to our conscience his law-magnifying righteousness, renders it <HI>dead to us,</HI> destitute of all power to condemn or hurt us; and us <HI>dead to it,</HI> freed from relation to it, love of it, or delightful at∣tempts to serve it!—Better, O my foul, dwell with a brawling woman in a strait house, than with this husband in a wide palace of outward prosperity. Flee therefore to Jesus; tarry not, lest thou be consumed. Avoid this broken law; pass not by him; never glean in his field; come not near the door of his house.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is represented as a PREGNANT WOMAN <HI>gendering children to bondage</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 24.</NOTE>. As many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse of slavery to Satan, the world, and their sinful corruptions. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their coarse provision; the husks of sinful and sensual pleasures! their wretched apparel; the filthy rags of self-righteous∣ness, and curse of Almighty God! their hard servitude; weary and heavy laden, <HI>serving DIVers iusts,</HI> and labour∣ing in the fire for very vanity! Ah! their sorry wages! To them is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever! Yet the slavery being natural, how is it loved and fol∣lowed! Notwithstanding all that God hath done for my soul; notwithstanding his changing and emptying me from vessel to vessel, what remains of this mother's blood runs still in my veins! How my comfort ebbs and flows with my frame! the challenges of my conscience mar my believing assurance! the prevalence of sin, or pride of grace, cheeks my exercise of faith on Christ! my de∣fects in duty mar my peace! Alas! how I undervalue Jesus person and blood! How straitened am I in reli∣gious exercises! How discouraged and fretted in almost every condition! How ready to go straight from duties to the service of lusts!</P>
<P N="5">5. It is called the STRENGTH OF SIN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 16.</NOTE>. From the strictness of its precept, and severity of its penalty, dis∣covered to the conscience, indwelling sin taketh occasion to rage more violently against God, Its curse con∣demns us to lie under the power of spiritual death in trespasses and sins. And thus, as it were, enableth our indwelling sin to command, work in war against, wound,

condemn, and slay us. O tremendous mystery! The holy law condemning us to a death in sin! to a lying under the power of sinful corruption, as the chief branch of our punishment! O horrid monster sin! which taketh <HI>occasion</HI> from the holy, just, and good commandment, to work in me all manner of sinful concupiscence! O mad legalist, to seek liberty and salvation by the <HI>mother of bondage!</HI> to seek purification by the <HI>strength of sin!</HI> Won∣der no more, my soul, that the preacher of our good works, as the ground of acceptance with God, renders people licentious in their life. The curse of the Al∣mighty is upon it; how can it then bear good fruit! How can the <HI>strength of sin</HI> reform the world? How can the source of hell open heaven for us?</P>

<HEAD>II. <HI>Metaphors respecting the covenant of grace.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The covenant of grace is compared to a RAIN∣BOW <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. iv. 3. and x. 1.</NOTE>. As a token that he is well pleased in Christ, and that floods of vengeance shall no more return to de∣stroy his people, God hath established and exhibited it. How sweetly it comprehends all, and more than all, the beauties of creation! reflects the glory, the heavenliness, the refreshing virtue, the royal majesty, and bloody suf∣fering, of my Sun, my Shield, my incarnate God! and gilds all the clouds of providence with his redeeming love! Here I behold him ALL IN ALL, even of my gloomy cross! Here I see JEHOVAH'S bow inverted; his wrath turned away from me, and pointed against the prince of the power of the air, and my other enemies. Blessed covenant, how high! but how condescending to men of low degree! How near! how wide-stretched thine arms to receive us men, <HI>earthly, sensual, and devilish!</HI> Him that cometh unto thee, shall in no wise be cast out. Short-lived, indeed, are our sensible views of thy bright∣ness; yet how pleasant presages these, of an abundance of rain! of times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord! Arise, my famished, my scorched, my withered soul, eat and drink; there is a sound of abundance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain; <HI>to-morrow</HI> shalt thou be for ever deluged with the

loving-kindness of God. Blessed agreement, by Jesus' sacrifice wast thou established, and for ever dost thou en∣circle his and his Father's head; they are ever mindful of thee; and regulate all their work by thee. O dar∣ling of my soul, shall not then my heart and eyes be for ever fixed on thee!</P>
<P N="2">2. It resembles <HI>Solomon's</HI> CHARIOT <HI>of the wood of Lebanon</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 9. 10.</NOTE>. Herein Jesus manifests his infinite royal∣ty, power, and wealth; hereby he conveys his chosen to his heavenly country; and conquers, and captivates every opposer. How precious, durable, firm, and fra∣grant its whole frame! Its <HI>pillars of silver,</HI> are its solid, substantial, shining, precious, and unchangeable pro∣mises. Its <HI>bottom of gold,</HI> is the infinitely pure preci∣ous, and everlasting perfections of God, and person of Christ. Its <HI>covering of purple,</HI> is his bleeding righteous∣ness, the condition of it. Its <HI>mid pavement of love,</HI> its source, heart, and substance, is the unbounded love, grace, and mercy of a God in Christ.—In thee O bles∣sed chariot, how sweetly; how safely; how quickly I ride to glory! How I overleap every mountain of dif∣ficulty in my way! How, all along the passage, my heart melts with love to him; that so loved me, and gave himself for me! and my tougue shouts the Re∣deemer!</P>
<P N="3">3. It resembles a BED, <HI>guarded in the night by three∣score valiant men of Israel</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 6. 7. 8.</NOTE>. Instated in this, O Je∣sus, we sweetly rest with thee, and mutually embrace one another, and are by thee rendered fruitful in good works. Here all we the chosen children of God are begotten, nourished, and warmed. To <HI>guard</HI> us during the night of trouble and time, we are attended by thy powerful perfections, mighty angels, and faithful mini∣sters.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is represented as a BUILDING and BANQUET∣ING HOUSE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxix. 1. 2. Song ii. 4.</NOTE>.

<P N="5">5. It is represented as a TESTAMENT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 22.</NOTE>. Here God dispones all things into Christ's hand; and he he∣queathes them to us sinful and unworthy men. By his blood and death it is confirmed; and all its promises are, in him, <HI>yea and amen,</HI> to the glory of God. Nor can any disannual or add thereto.—O thrice-honourable title to eternal life! Be it "all my falvation, and all my desire, though he make it not to grow."</P>

God hath spoken; hath written; hath sworn in his holiness, I <HI>will rejoice.</HI> In believing ex∣pectation, I will DIVide, I will commence the enjoy∣ment of, my unbounded felicity.

<P N="1">1. GOD's word is compared to an INSTRUCTOR, COMPANION, and COUNSELLOR <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 24. 98.</NOTE>. It con∣tains the whole revelation of his mind to us. In teach∣eth
<PB N="298" REF="302"/>
us every useful truth; abides with us in every case; comforts us in every grief; directs us in every perplexi∣ty.—Blessed counsellor, let me commit myself wholly to thee; depend on thee; and readily receive thy dictates. When I lie down, speak thou to me. When I rise up, and walk by the way, talk thou with me.</P>
<P N="2">2. It resembles the NECK of a human body <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10. and iv. 4.</NOTE>. Thereby the church is joined to Christ; her life main∣tained; her food conveyed from him; and her spiritual breath of prayer, praise, and preaching, transmitted. Adds not this greatly to her comeliness! and is it not <HI>chained about</HI> with golden promises, ordinances, and blessings?</P>
<P N="3">3. The scripture resembles a mother's BREASTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 14. and iv. 5.</NOTE>. It consists of two sacred testaments, between which, as the meeting centre, Jesus lodgeth during the night of time. How these adorn his mystical body; and convey the spiritual milk of saving knowledge, and gracious influence to her members!</P>
<P N="4">4. It is represented as a mother's BELLY <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 2.</NOTE>. By its influence are saints and graces begotten, quickened, and nourished, in this their weak state; and hereby are they hid and protected from danger.—Till my <HI>glorious birth</HI> into the heavenly state, may I lie and feed here!</P>
<P N="5">5. It resembles <HI>two</HI> TWIN-ROES <HI>feeding among li∣lies</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 3.</NOTE>. How fresh, comely, and glorious, are its two inspired testaments! How harmoniously connected! How they feed, or dwell, upon Christ and his people! How thick planted with lilies of precious promises.—My soul, let them to be thee, as the loving hind and plea∣sant roe; let their breasts satisfy thee at all times, and be thou alway ravished with the love of Christ in them.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is called STATUTES <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix. 8.</NOTE>. By God's infinite wisdom, it is framed; by his sovereign authority, it is ratified and published; and is indispensably obligatory on our conscience.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is called a LAW <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix. 7.</NOTE>. Every article of it is stamped with the authority of the one lawgiver, able to save alive, or destroy. It sufficiently teacheth, directs, and binds us to an holy practice. To our unspeakable

advantage, we conform to it; and to our inexpressible hurt, we walk contrary to it.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is called JUDGMENTS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix. 9.</NOTE>. O the wisdom and knowledge of God displayed therein!—By it he now judgeth our actions; requireth us to judge ourselves; and by it he will judge us at the last day.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is called TESTIMONIES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix. 7.</NOTE>. Solemnly and faith∣fully it declares to us every momentous truth concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning ourselves and our neighbour; and it is attested by the sacred oath of Fa∣ther, Son, and Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is represented as a TESTAMENT <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 11.</NOTE>. It is the last will of our crucified Redeemer. It is immutably confirmed and ratified by his death; and therein he hath graciously and distinctly bequeathed to us all his inestimable blessings, his fulness of righteousness, grace, and glory; and left us all the important rules of our conduct.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is compared to LIGHT <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ix. 50. 105.</NOTE>. How heavenly its origin!

How penetrating, purifying, quickening, dis∣covering, and directing, its virtue!—While I have this light, let me walk in it, lest darkness come upon me. Do thou, Jesus, open mine eyes, that I may see won∣drous things out of thy law.</P>
<P N="12">12. It is compared to a LAMP <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 105.</NOTE>. Lighted by the inspiration, and shining by the oil-like influence of the Holy Ghost, it irradiates dark places of the earth, and dark corners of our heart. How different the degrees of its brightness, as it is more or less carefully snuffed and preserved from alteration or misinterpretation! How ea∣ly and often removed from one place to another! How often do ministers therewith light up Jesus' friends to their celestial chambers, and return themselves to the blackness of darkness! It is a light only suited to the night of time, and small in comparison of the bright vi∣sion and glory to be revealed.—It is a <HI>lamp ordained,</HI> DIVinely set up, to publish the excellency, and draw men

<P N="13">13. It is compared to a FIRE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxiii. 20.</NOTE>. How absolutely necessary in our cold earth! How powerfully it pene∣trates into, illuminates, warms, melts, softens, quick∣ens, comforts, and purifieth our heart! burns up our in∣ward corruption, and conforms us to its own likeness! Ye ministers of God, keep it not back from your peo∣ple, lest it be in your bowels, as a tormenting, a bur∣ning fire. Ye sons of men, meditate and muse there∣on, that its fire may seize you; cause your heart to burn, while Jesus openeth to you the scriptures. Quench not its influence by bloody crimes, by presumptuous rebellion against God; nor by wallowing in sin, and drinking up iniquity; nor by earthly mindedness and sensuality; nor by neglect to administer due fuel, in the exercise of reading, hearing, meditation, and prayer.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is compared to RAIN and DEW <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 2.</NOTE>. How heavenly and DIVine its origin! How gradually and ir∣resistibly it is revealed to the church, and applied to the heart! How numerous its articles of history, prophe∣cy, promise, threatning, doctrine, and law! How sea∣sonably it descends, in the night of time and distress, or morning of gracious opportunity! How pleasant, come∣ly, refreshful, restoring, softening, and often insensible its application to our soul!—Let thy doctrine, O Jesus, drop as the dew, and distil as the rain; so shall we <HI>re∣vive as the corn, grow as the lily,</HI> and cast forth our roots as Lebanon.</P>
<P N="15">15. It is compared to WATERS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. lv. 1. Zech. xiv. 8. Psal. xxiii. 2. and xlvi. 4.</NOTE>. It, chiefly its promises, being furnished with the Father's love, the fulness, merit, and grace of the Son, and the unboun∣ded influence of the Holy Ghost, powerfully sound, and run into our heart; bear down all sinful opposition; spread into all our inward powers, and outward prac∣tice; and among all the various nations of men. How suitable to the case of every one, sinner or saint! How effectually it cools our burning lust! quencheth our car∣nal desires! purgeth off our filth! beautifieth our heart and life! refresheth, nourisheth, strengthens, heals, molli∣fies,
<PB N="301" REF="305"/>
quickens, and fructifieth our foul. <HI>Christ's sprink∣ling us</HI> with this water, imports his gradual, close, care∣ful, and plenteous application thereof to our heart, and conscience; to purge us from dead works, to serve the living God.</P>
<P N="16">16. It is represented as SEED, or GOOD SEED <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mark. iv. 1.—20.</NOTE>. How precious, useful, and necessary! With what care and skill, doth Jesus, its producer and sower, in every age and case, delightful, or stormy, cast it into his church, and the hearts of his people! that it may bud and grow up, it must be hid in our heart; dwell in us richly; and be covered with meditation and prayer: nor, immediately after it is sown, must we expect, sen∣sibly to perceive and enjoy its good fruits. The frost of affliction and temptation is useful, to deepen its root, and kill the weeds of corruption, that spontaneously spring up in our soul in order to choke it. But chief∣ly, the warmth of the Sun of righteousness, the rain and dew of the blessed Spirit, and the influences of the moon of instituted ordinances, concur to promote its growth. If it be early and abundantly sown, and if the earliest buds of corruption be carefully nipt, it prospers the more: if superficially received, either Satan and his agents, quickly catch it away; or our promising ap∣pearances quickly wither; or the thorny cares of a pre∣sent life, choke the word, and render it unfruitful. What abundant fruit did an handful hereof, sown by the apostles, on the barren <HI>mountain</HI> of our Gentile-world, produce!</P>
<P N="17">17. It is compared to WHEAT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxiii. 18. Song vii. 2.</NOTE>. How noted its value! its purity and solidity! its duration and power to endure storms! How wholesome, healing, and nou∣rishing its influence! Is it not <HI>an heap of wheat set a∣bout with lilies?</HI> How large its fulness, and DIVersified its truths! How surrounded with fragrant, flourishing, and medicinal promises; and with ransomed men, feed∣ing thereon! Do not all its truths centre in Jesus, <HI>the lily of the valley?—</HI>What then, is the unsubstantial chaff of vain imaginations to this wheat, saith the Lord!</P>
<P N="18">18. It is compared to FOOD <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. iv. 4.</NOTE>. How absolutely
<PB N="302" REF="306"/>
necessary to support our inward, our spiritual life! How plentifully provided by God! How all-suiting! how nourishing and strengthening to our heart! How na∣turally the children of God turn to, and seek after it! and with what frequency and pleasure they receive it!—Was it, my soul, ever found, and eaten by thee? Was it the joy and rejoicing of my heart? Do I <HI>live, not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God!</HI> Do I more carefully, more fre∣quently, attend the repast of my soul, than of this mor∣tal worm, my body? Happy I, that though the meat be cut off from the field, there is enough in my Fa¦ther's inspired granary, and to spare. Eat, my soul, that which is good, and delight thyself in fatness. Bread shall be given me, and my water shall be sure. No drought nor heat can smite; no east wind can blast the field of his promises. No poverty, idleness, or guilt, can break my title to his provision. Work not therefore thy own works, but believe, eat, drink, and be merry; for thine eternal TO-MORROW shall be as this day, and <HI>much more abundant</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. It is compared to HONEY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix. 10</NOTE>. How glorious its origin! Here, by the amazing skill, care, and la∣bour of an incarnate God, the quintessence of creation, of more than ten thousand creations, of Godhead, is prepared for us! How ravishing its sweetness! delight∣fully sickening my heart, and rendering even troubles sweeter than honey to my taste! How effectually it soft∣ens our inward powers! searcheth and heals our spiri∣tual sores! recovers from inward consumptions! purgeth and nourisheth our soul! Yet ah! how lothed by ma∣ny, who have access to it!—John's little book was <HI>sweet in his mouth, but bitter in his belly.</HI> With plea∣sure he received the knowledge of future events; but was grieved to think of the foreseen adversities of the church of God.—Be thou, my soul, a busy bee, gather∣ing honey from every inspired flower; so shall that which is set on my table be full of fatness; full of ra∣vishing sweetness. For ever, I shall feed on pure, on redeeming Godhead, as my ALL IN ALL.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="303" REF="307"/>
20. It is compared to MILK <HI>sincere</HI> and uncorrupt∣ed <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 1. Heb. v. 12.</NOTE>. O its purity and sweetness! its nourishing, restoring, healing, and purifying influence! How much desired and valued by the saints! how proper food in their earthly and infantile state! what noble remedy under their spiritual consumptions! O the abundance! Here, for abundance of milk, every one may eat, may wash his steps in butter. Butter and honey shall every one eat, that dwells in our new covenant-land, that they may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.—The more plain truths of God's word are likened to <HI>milk,</HI> while the rest are compared to <HI>strong meat.</HI> The weakest saints can spiritually understand, receive, and digest, the former; while only those, who are grown in grace, and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, can understand, feed on, and improve the latter. Lord, I must feed, with the weakest, on thy plain promises. And O how plain! plain! pleasant, they are to my heart?</P>
<P N="21">21. It is compared to GOLD; FINE GOLD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 72.</NOTE>. How pure, precious, solid, and durable! How glorious, use∣ful, enriching, adorning! How substantial and weighty, containing much in few words! How thoroughly tried, amidst flaming persecutions, fiery trials of enraged oppo∣sers; and in the fiery-like experience of the saints! What a sovereign medicine to heal our running sores of corruption! What a sovereign cordial to revive, and re store a drooping spirit! Covet earnestly, my soul, this best thing, this gold, that shall keep me; and shall, in all cases and countries, pass current, between me and my God.</P>
<P N="22">22. It is compared to SILVER TRIED <HI>in a furnace, and seven times purified</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. xii. 6.</NOTE>. How pure, precious, shining and useful! O the seven-fold flames of trouble and persecution that it hath endured! And was it not, O blessed Jesus, refined to the highest in thy fiery death?—Didst thou, my soul, ever find dross in him, or his word?</P>
<P N="23">23. It is likened to a RICH SPOIL and TREASURE, a HERITAGE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 162.</NOTE>. It is the fruit of Christ's victory over
<PB N="304" REF="308"/>
sin, Satan, and the world. It contains an inexpressible fulness of grace and glory; <HI>all the fulness of God,</HI> suf∣ficient to enrich millions of destitute sinners. How highly valued, and safely secured by Christ, and his people! He hides it in his hand; and they hide it in their heart. Evermore, Lord, let me follow thee, to DIVide this spoil; to share this inheritance, as an heir of Christ.</P>
<P N="24">24. It resembles a PLOUGH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hos. x. 12.</NOTE>. Being DIVinely ap∣plied to our heart, it <HI>breaks up the fallow-ground,</HI> breaks the roots of corruption, and prepares us for receiving the good feed of grace. The more obdurate our heart, the more powerful, deep, and close must the application of the word be. How proper for its more effectual operation, is the winter of adversity, and the spring∣tide of youth! How necessary that every application be attended with the rainy influences of the Holy Spirit!</P>
<P N="25">25. It is compared to a ROD and STAFF <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxiii. 4. and xlv. 6. and cx. 2.</NOTE>. By it Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, hints his will, draws, directs, supports; and comforts his people. When I walk through the troublous valley of the shadow of death, let this rod and staff comfort me; so shall I fear no evil.—It is <HI>the rod of Christ's strength,</HI> and his SCEPTRE <HI>of righteousness.</HI> By it he displays, his power, equity, and finished righteousness, in the conviction, conversion, and sanctification of his people; and by it he displays his sovereignty, authorizeth his ordinances, and testifieth his kindness to his people; and orders destruction for his enemies.</P>
<P N="26">26. It is compared to an HAMMER <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxiii. 29.</NOTE>. By it God beats and breaks our hard hearts; fastens in them the nails of convincing influences, of regulating precepts awing threatenings, sanctifying and encouraging pro∣mises.—When thy words, O Master of assemblies, are by thee fixed in my soul, I am prickt to the heart; all my powers cry out, What shall I do to be saved? Give me Christ, or else I die.</P>
<P N="27">27. It is compared to a SWORD, and called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sword of the Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlv. 3.

<PB N="305" REF="309"/>
our conscience, slays our lust, pierceth and subdues our heart. How excellent its metal and form, for the spiri∣tual warfare. By managing it aright, we, through the Spirit, convince or silence the erroneous, defend our soul, overcome our spiritual enemies, subdue the slavish-fear of death, mortify our lusts, glorify God, and promote ourselves to everlasting honour.</P>
<P N="28">28. It is likened to BOW and ARROWS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlv. 45.</NOTE>. By means thereof, God powerfully, suddenly, and often somewhat imperceptibly, convinceth, converts, and subdues sinners to himself.—Lord, cause the arrows of thy truth and influence, stick fast in the heart of thine enemies, to make the people fall in subjection under thee!</P>
<P N="29">29. It resembles the TOWER <HI>of David builded for an armoury, whereon hang a thousand shields of mighty men</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 4. and vii. 4.</NOTE>. How strong, invincible, and glorious! How richly furnished with all the armour of God! Here is <HI>the sword</HI> of sufficient arguments against every tempta∣tion and error; <HI>the shield</HI> of God himself, and of faith in him, to avert every fiery dart, or deathful push; <HI>the girdle</HI> of faithful promises and DIVine truths, to fortify and encourage our heart; <HI>the breast-plate</HI> of imputed righteousness, and sanctifying grace, to secure our soul; <HI>the helmet</HI> of a well grounded <HI>hope of salvation,</HI> the <HI>shoes</HI> of gospel-principles, and the <HI>artillery</HI> of manifold pray∣ers. Choose, O my soul, thine armour from hence: there is none like it; Lord, give it me.</P>
<P N="30">30. The scriptures resemble a BANQUETING HOUSE, <HI>where the guests are embannered with Jesus' love</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song li. 4.</NOTE>. By bringing us into the spiritual knowledge thereof, what stores of reposited blessedness he discovers to us! How sweetly he feasts, refresheth, strengthens, and animates, to the spiritual warfare, with his love, which is better than wine!</P>
<P N="31">31. They are compared to Solomon's <HI>green and guard∣ed</HI> BED <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song i. 16. and iii. 7. 8.</NOTE>. What sweet rest in, communion with, and sanctifying and fructifying influence, do we therein receive from Jesus Christ, while DIVine perfections, holy angels and vigilant ministers, unnumbered, do

guard and defend us, till the cold, dark, and dangerous night, of trouble and time, come to an end!</P>
<P N="32">32. God's word is compared to a WAY or PATH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">3 John. 4.</NOTE>. Planned by the wisdom of God, owned by the King of kings; it points out the way to obtain the heavenly country and city. It supports the saints, who with pleasure and progress follow one another, in attending to, depending on, and walking therein.—Here walk, my soul, so shall I never be ashamed. Nor let me have greater joy, than to see Zion's children walking in the truth, more and more receiving it into their heart, and practising it in their life.</P>
<P N="33">33. It is compared to a RULE, REED, or MEASURING∣LINE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xl. &amp;c.</NOTE>. It is indeed contemned by a carnal world, but is the exact, the useful, the DIVinely appointed standard of all the forms and ordinances of the church, and of every part of our conduct; and by which we shall be judged at last.—Alway, therefore, my soul, enquire <HI>what saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="34">34. It is compared to a GLASS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii 18.</NOTE>. Through it, we behold our own insufficiency and filthiness, the glory of God in Christ, the momentous reality of eternal things, and the true path of holiness that leadeth to eternal hap∣piness. Behold in this glass, my soul, thyself, and be humbled; behold the glory of Christ, that thou mayest be changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. Nor be thou a forgetful hearer, that quickly forgets what manner of appearance he saw.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Metaphors respecting law and gospel; which are the two principal parts of God's word: The law teach∣eth us what duty God requireth of us; and the gospel, what blessings be freely giveth to us.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1. <HI>Metaphors respecting the law.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE law is represented as a SCHOOLMASTER <HI>to bring us to Christ</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ii. 14.</NOTE>. The moral law shews us our need of him, for by it is the knowledge of sin; it
<PB N="307" REF="311"/>
demands of us that righteousness which we can only find in him; chargeth us to embrace him, as soon as he is revealed and offered; and prevents our quiet resting in any thing till we find him. Darkly the ceremonial law pointed out the mystery of Christ, and by hard services, and carnal ordinances, led to his person, righteousness, and grace, as the fulfilling end of its types and shadows.</P>
<P N="2">2. The law is called a KILLING LETTER <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 6.</NOTE>. No law of itself, can give us any life; but kills our vain hopes and imaginations. Sin taketh occasion from it, to abound, and promote our spiritual death. The mo∣ral law as a covenant, condemns us to all manner of death in sin and wo. Simply considered, the ceremonial law consisted of lifeless rites and services, which, used without respect to Christ, entailed curses and death upon its sub∣jects, as they led them away from the fountain of life, to their own righteousness; by which they could not live. Howbeit, God's punishing Israel, by <HI>giving them statutes that were not good,</HI> is not to be understood of the ceremonial law, but of God's giving them up to obey the sinful edicts of Jeroboam, and his idolatrous successors.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is called a LAMP and LIGHT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 23.</NOTE>. It plainly points out our duty, and blemishes in heart and life. And how pleasant to be directed by it in Christ's way!</P>
<P N="4">4, It is called a PATH and WAY <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 32.</NOTE>. Being planned by God, and plain in itself; we are to exercise ourselves in it, by making progress towards the city of God. How <HI>peaceful!</HI> Great peace with God, and with their own conscience, have all they who love and walk in it; and when a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. How <HI>plain!</HI> no∣thing shall offend them, who walk therein. How <HI>plea∣sant</HI> to walk together in unity, with DIVine persons, and fellow saints! How <HI>holy, just, and good!</HI> None but holy persons, the redeemed of the Lord, walk there; nothing but holy exercises is a walking therein. How <HI>spiritual!</HI> unseen but to the spiritual man, and walked in, by ser∣ving God in the Spirit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh! How <HI>strait!</HI> exclu∣ding
<PB N="308" REF="312"/>
every unregenerate person, and every sinful thought, word, or deed. How <HI>exceeding broad!</HI> requiring duties unnumbered, in every circumstance of heart and life. How <HI>safe!</HI> the way-faring man, though a fool, shall not err therein. It is a <HI>way of life;</HI> walked in by the living in Jerusalem; a way wherein life is ever communicated and which leadeth to life as an eternal, but gracious re∣ward. It is <HI>above,</HI> is heavenly, in its origin, nature, and tendency; and by it we depart from hell which is be∣neath. Here, let me ever run, when God enlargeth my heart.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is compared to a HEDGE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eccles. x. 18.</NOTE>. Thereby God limits our motions, and points out, whether we may, or may not go. To what hurt in his work, and what pu∣nishment in the issue, doth the breaker of it expose him∣self! The old serpent, the devil, the serpent of a sting∣ing conscience, and the serpent of God's judgments, shall bite him.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is represented as a YOKE; BANTS; CORDS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. ii. 3.</NOTE>. By DIVine authority, it restrains our sinful liberty and madness; and keeps us to our station and work. How galling to our corrupt nature and lusts! and at what endless peril, we attempt to shake it off, by refusing obedience to it! The law as a rule, in the hand of Christ, is an <HI>easy yoke and light burden;</HI> it is lined with his re∣deeming love, sweetened with his pattern, attended with communication of his strength, and enforced with a glorious and free reward, to the weakest attempt, if sin∣cere, to draw therein.—Why then, my soul, art thou as an unruly <HI>bullock unaccustomed to this yoke?</HI> Why so ma∣ny criminal attempts to shake off the yoke, and burst the bands? why this resisting of the Lord, and strug∣gling to evade his authority? Is it not HE, who lays my <HI>meat,</HI> my <HI>life,</HI> my <HI>all,</HI> to me? The law, of ceremonies, and <HI>as a covenant of works, is a yoke of bondage:</HI> the for∣mer chained down to burdensome services innumerable; and the latter rigorously demands what we can never perform.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is called the LAW OF LIBERTY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. ii. 3.</NOTE>. To obey it as a rule, is the privilege of those only whom God's <HI>(c)</HI> Jam. i. 25.
<PB N="309" REF="313"/>
Son hath made <HI>free indeed.</HI> The obedience of love to it as a rule, springs from our freedom from the law as a covenant, and is the very quintessence of our honourable and delightful liberty.—Lord, my true freedom from sinful slavery lies in being thy filial subject. Truly I am thy servant, I am thy servant; thou hast loosed my <HI>bands.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. It is called the ROYAL LAW <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 8.</NOTE>. Being established by God, the universal Sovereign, it extends to all his ra∣tional subjects; nor, without high treason, can it be broken. <HI>It is not made for a righteous man,</HI> is not made to curse and condemn him. Nor have the truly righ∣teous nation any immediate connection with it, <HI>as a covenant,</HI> it being dead to them, and they to it, by Jesus Christ's fulfilling it in their stead.</P>
<P N="9">9. The law of the wise is called a FOUNTAIN <HI>of life</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 14.</NOTE>. The DIVine law, which every wise man at∣tends to, as his rule, and the instructions which wise men give to others, are means of exciting them to apply to Christ, the resurrection and the life; means of quicken∣ing, reviving, and restoring spiritual life; means of mens escaping the second death, and preparing for life eternal.</P>
<P N="10">10. The ceremonial law is called CARNAL <HI>ordinances,</HI> and <HI>a</HI> CARNAL <HI>commandment</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 10. and vii. 16.</NOTE>. It prescribed carnal and fleshly rites; and carnal or natural descent entitled to the privileges thereof.</P>
<P N="11">11. The ceremonial law is called a PARTITION-WALL <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 14. 15.</NOTE>; because of the great distinction which it made between the Jews and Gentiles; nor, till Jesus re∣moved and abolished it by his death, was any consider∣able number of Gentiles brought into the church of God.</P>
<P N="12">12. The ceremonial law is called ENMITY <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 14. 15.</NOTE>. The sacrifices therein required, manifested God's indignation at sin, and the enmity between him and sinful men. Its burdensome services occasioned the Jews hatred of God to increase more and more. The distinction it put be∣tween Jews and Gentiles, occasioned enmity between the two.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="310" REF="314"/>
<HEAD>II. <HI>Metaphors respecting the gospel.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The gospel is called the SPIRIT <HI>that giveth life</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 6.</NOTE>. It contains spiritual blessings and promises. It comes from, is attended by, and is the great means of convey∣ing the Spirit of God to us. It effectually penetrates our soul and spirit. By it the Holy Ghost quickens dead sinners, shews them their way of life by Christ; heals their deadly, their sinful wounds; works a lively faith in their soul, to look to, and live upon him. It is the food that supports the spiritual life; the cordial, that revives and restores the heart under every drooping circumstance.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is represented as the WHITE HORSE, upon which Christ and his people ride <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi. 2. and xix. 14.</NOTE>. O its purity, glory, and comeliness! By it Jesus proclaims peace to men, and subdues them to himself. On this, in the apostolic age, he went forth conquering; and in the Millennium he shall go forth, more eminently, to conquer the hearts of his people. Then, in accomplishment of, and as animated, supported, and dignified, by gospel-promises, shall mul∣titudes follow him, and promote the destruction of An∣tichrist.</P>
<P N="3">3. It resembles <HI>Solomon's</HI> CHARIOT <HI>of the wood of Le∣banon</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 5. 10.</NOTE>. Being framed by Jesus, for the safe, the easy, and honoured conquest, and conveyance of his people to heaven; how pure, precious, glorious, fra∣grant, and lasting! Its <HI>pillars of silver,</HI> are its comely, useful, and enriching truths and promises. Its <HI>bottom of gold,</HI> is its substantial and precious foundation-truths, or the infinitely precious person of Christ, and God in him. Its <HI>covering of purple,</HI> is the doctrine of justifica∣tion through Jesus' blood; and of the cross endured for his sake. Its <HI>inward pavement of love,</HI> is the unmatched kindness and mercy of God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, running through every truth and promise there∣in contained.</P>
<P N="4">4. Its promises are like LILIES <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 7. and vii 2.</NOTE>. O their plea∣santness,
<PB N="311" REF="315"/>
glory, fragrancy, and height! How fruitful of everlasting blessings! How full of medicinal virtue, for the healing of our soul! How condescendent, and suited to our low, our wretched condition!—Blessed field of inspiration, how these every where abound! How they bend their blessed head towards mean, de∣based, <HI>earthly, sensual, devilish</HI> me! How they refresh mine eyes, and rejoice my heart! How rank they smell of Jesus, the Lily of the valley! And truly, as lilies a∣mong thorns, so are they to my soul, amidst her troubles, and her created comforts.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is called the GRACE <HI>of God that bringeth salva∣tion,</HI> and GREAT SALVATION <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11. Heb. ii. 3.</NOTE>. It flows from, disco∣vers, and includes the rich, free, and undeserved favour of God, and the blessed fruits thereof. It publishes, brings near, offers, and is the means of applying, a cost∣ly, extensive, and everlasting salvation to men.—Trust thyself, my soul, to this word of his grace, fail not of this grace, nor receive it in vain; let it enter and cap∣tivate my heart; so shall I never be a root of bitter∣ness, bearing gall and wormwood, whereby many are defiled.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is called the POWER <HI>of God unto salvation</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 16.</NOTE>. By it, God displays his amazing power, in the contri∣vance, in the purchase, and application of our redemption. Thereby he exerts the exceeding greatness of his power, in convincing, in converting, in forgiving, sanctifying, and comforting his people. By means of it our rebel∣lion is quashed; our enmity slain; Satan dislodged; corruption subdued; bars of iron, and gates of brass, strong impediments, broken and removed; nations re∣formed; men, furious as outragious beasts, tamed; and deep-rooted and earnestly-held abominations, abolished. Come, blessed <HI>day of power;</HI> come forth, <HI>blessed rod of Jesus' strength,</HI> then shall the people be willing; God shall raise children out of worse than stones to Abraham. Nothing is too hard, when his power is present to heal them.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is called the WISDOM <HI>of God in a mystery; the manifold</HI> WISDOM <HI>of God</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 7. Eph. iii. 10.</NOTE>. How <HI>manifold</HI> its doc∣trines
<PB N="312" REF="316"/>
and promises! How manifold the instances and rays of DIVine wisdom in each! and the various times and seasons in which, and persons to which, it is display∣ed! It discovers how wisely JEHOVAH acted, in chusing the persons, in whose redemption grace would peculiar∣ly shine; in founding his choice upon his own mere love, that the promises might be sure to all the seed; in laying our help upon one that is mighty, that it might never fail; in bringing about our salvation in a way, that produceth glory to himself in the highest, peace on earth, and good will towards men; in a way, by which Satan is shamed, sin condemned, sinners saved; the un∣godly justified, and ungodliness destroyed; iniquity for∣given, and full vengeance taken on our inventions; in a way, by which our redemption is all of mercy, and all of justice; all of merit, and all of grace. O sweet myste∣ry! beyond archangels comprehensive ken!</P>
<P N="8">8. It may be called the KISSES <HI>of Christ's mouth</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 2.</NOTE>. From him, its doctrines and promises proceed; and bear the stamp of his authority. How sweetly they attest his peace and reconciliation! declare and vent his love! How effectually they delight our soul! ravish our heart! and excite our affection and love to him!—Let Jesus kiss me, with one, with all <HI>the kisses of his mouth;</HI> apply one, apply all his promises to my heart, to kindle it wholly into a flame of love to himself!</P>
<P N="9">9. It is called a LAW <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. ii. 1. 2. Rev. vii. 2. and iii. 27.</NOTE>. It is the will of a sove∣reign God, proclaiming his edicts of peace and pardon. It engageth him to bestow his blessings on us; and binds and determines us to receive his grace, and obey his commands. Nor shall it ever be repealed, because Jesus <HI>hath an unchangeable priesthood.</HI> It is the <HI>law of the Spirit of life in him,</HI> as by it, the Holy Ghost, as dwelling in, sent by, and taking of the things of Christ, to shew them to us, begets, preserves, restores, increaseth, and perfects our spiritual life; secures us of, and pre∣pares us for eternal life. It is the <HI>law of faith,</HI> the seed, the means, the ground and standard of our faith. <HI>It comes forth out of Zion and Jerusalem;</HI> flows from Christ as the temple and habitation of God; and from Jerusalem did its New-Testament dispensation proceed,
<PB N="313" REF="317"/>
and spread among the Gentiles.—O may I meditate on this law, day and night; may it be better to me, than <HI>thousands of gold and silver!</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. It is called <HI>good</HI> TIDINGS <HI>of great joy</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. iii. 8. Luke ii. 10.</NOTE>. O the necessary, the useful, the suitable, the important, the delightful, and ravishing news which it brings from heaven to sinful men! Tidings of righteousness, pardon, and acceptance, to the guilty! Tidings of purification to the polluted! of health to the diseased! of liberty to the enslaved and imprisoned! of clothing to the na∣ked! of food to the hungry and starving! of light to them that sit in darkness of distress and ignorance! of riches to the poor, comfort to the mourner, peace to the traitor, life to the dead, and salvation to the lost! How often have these good news from the far country been as cold water to my thirsty and weary soul! It is called the <HI>gospel,</HI> or <HI>good tidings of God;</HI> it proceeds from him, declares his love and loveliness; promotes his honour, and brings men to him: It is called the <HI>gospel of Christ,</HI> as he is the principal preacher, the substance and end of of it, in whom all the articles of it are <HI>yea and amen to the glory of God:</HI> It is called the <HI>gospel of ministers,</HI> as they preach and publish it. It is the <HI>gospel of peace,</HI> as it proclaims the peace of God to us, and the means thereof; and reconciles our heart to him, and to one another in love. It is the <HI>gospel of salvation,</HI> as it pro∣claims, brings near, offers, exhibits, and is the means of applying, the great, the everlasting salvation, to our soul. It is an <HI>everlasting gospel,</HI> as it shall be dispensed till the end of time; and its fruits shall remain for ever. It is the <HI>gospel of the kingdom</HI> of grace; and which brings men, who believe it, to the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is called a MYSTERY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii. 9. 1 Tim. 3 iii. 16. Matth. xiii. 11.</NOTE>. O the incompre∣hensible truths which it reveals! That there are three persons in one Godhead, or DIVine essence: That the Son of God was manifest in the flesh; suffered the just for the unjust, that he might bring sinners to God; died for our offences, and rose again for our justification; was exalted as a Prince and Saviour, to give us repentance and remission of sins; sent to bless us, make us the
<PB N="314" REF="318"/>
righteousness of God in him, and dwell in our hearts by faith; that being crucified with Christ, we might live by faith on him, and have the world crucified to us, and we to the world. Is not every doctrine thereof an unsearchable deep, shown only by the Spirit of God, and which even a wise man cannot find out to perfec∣tion! O the height, the depth, the length, and breadth of the love, the wisdom, and knowledge of God, inclu∣ded therein! It is the <HI>mystery of godliness,</HI> which founds and promotes conformity to, and reverence of God; ho∣liness in heart and life. The <HI>mystery of the kingdom,</HI> known only in the kingdom of grace and glory. Pant thou, my soul, for the fellowship of this mystery of Christ; with angels, desire to look into it.</P>
<P N="12">12. It is likened to a TRUMPET <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xxvii. 12.</NOTE>. With great skill it ought to be preached. How majestic and plea∣sant its joyful sound! its agreeable declarations! How sweetly! how loud it proclaims the approaches of King Jesus to men! and their deliverance from sin and wrath by him! Of what unbounded importance are its decla∣rations! and how distinct! It warns us to flee from the wrath to come; invites us to Jesus, the <HI>Saviour and great One.—</HI>Quickly may it be blown over all the earth; that such as are ready to perish, may come and worship before the Lord of hosts.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is compared to RIVERS <HI>of living, and all-quickening water</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek xlvii. 1.—4. Joel iii. 18. Zech. xiv. 8. Psal. xlvi. 4.</NOTE>; because of its freeness, fulness, purity, perpetuity, and patency to all; and for its cleansing, beautifying, protecting, refreshing, and en∣riching virtue. By it Jesus begets, preserves, restores, promotes and perfects, the spiritual life of his people, and brings them to eternal life. <HI>This river proceeds from the temple, and runs by the altar of God;</HI> flows from his love, and through the blood and sacrifice of his Son. <HI>Gradually it increaseth from a bubbling drop to an unpass∣able sea.</HI> Before the flood, it was very small in appear∣ance; but gradually it increased by new revelations, till, in the apostolic age, it became like a river. Before Je∣sus' resurrection, it was inconsiderable, in respect of its appearance in the apostolic and millennial age. It <HI>runs</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="319"/>
<HI>into the dead sea, and valley of Shittim;</HI> spreads among dead and barren Gentile nations, and into cursed, bar∣ren, and lifeless hearts. It <HI>makes every thing to live whithersoever it cometh;</HI> had, and shall have, an amazing success in quickening dead sinners, and reviving dying saints; but heals not <HI>marishy places</HI> of reprobate men. <HI>The flourishing and fruitful trees growing on the side of this river,</HI> are Jesus the tree of life, and his comely and useful saints. <HI>The multitude of fishers from Engedi even unto Eneglaim, and the multitude of fishes caught by them in the dead sea, when this river hath run into it,</HI> are mi∣nisters preaching, and multitudes hearing and receiving the gospel, through the world, from one end to the other. Its <HI>running both in summer and winter,</HI> implies its being constantly preached and applied, whether in times of prosperity or trouble, with the church, or any particular member thereof It <HI>maketh glad the city,</HI> the church <HI>of God,</HI> by its <HI>streams</HI> of declarations, offers, in∣vitations, and influences.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is a WELL, or <HI>wells of salvation</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xii. 3.</NOTE>. O the depth of its doctrines and promises! Without faith, I can draw nothing from them. O their perpetual fulness of influence! of blessedness and salvation! How sweet∣ly calculated to delight, refresh, nourish, restore, heal, quicken, and fructify my heart! And is not salvation their sum, their <HI>all in all?</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. The gospel is compared to a NET <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 47. 48. 49.</NOTE>. How cu∣rious its frame and contexture! How base and despi¦cable in the view of carnal men! What an occasion of trouble and disturbance, in the sea of this world! With what skill, care, and vigour, it must be cast and mana∣ged, in the preaching of it! To what fatigue and storms, are its constant, its faithful preachers exposed! How seldom, they, <HI>at first,</HI> perceive their success in preaching it! It is the stated means of drawing sinners out of their natural and worldly state, to Jesus Christ. Fishes small and great, sinners less or greater, persons poor or rich, are caught therein. Teach thy ministers, O Jesus, to cast this net on the right side of the ship, that a mul∣titude may be inclosed; it is impossible the net can
<PB N="316" REF="320"/>
break. Quickly, my soul, shall JEHOVAH draw it to land; the mystery of God shall be finished; the gospel no more dispensed. Then shall the good fish, such men as were caught by the heart, be conveyed to the para∣dise of God. These, who were only caught by a heady illumination, and outward profession, shall be cast into endless fire.</P>
<P N="16">16. It is compared to a GRAIN <HI>of mustard-seed, which grows up into a very large stalk</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 31. 32.</NOTE>. At first, its disco∣very and dispensation were small and despised; but it hath, or will, overspread the whole earth. To what mul∣titudes is it the means of refreshing and comfort! What numbers shall profess subjection to it! How increasing its influence in our heart! At first, perhaps scarce dis∣cernible, it quickly fills the whole. What multitudes of graces are refreshed! What good works are brought forth, under the overshadowing influence thereof!</P>
<P N="17">17. It is compared to LEAVEN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 33.</NOTE>. However un∣pleasant and despicable it be to carnal men; yet being inlaid in the world, it continueth to spread its influence, till the whole earth be filled with the knowledge of the Lord. Being inlaid in mens heart, it spreads its virtue, enlightening the mind, purifying the conscience, re∣newing the will, softening the heart, inflaming the af∣fections, and fixing the memory, till the whole be there∣by sanctified.</P>
<P N="18">18. It is compared to LIGHT, and a GLASS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. lx. 1. 2 Cor. iii. 18.</NOTE>. What ravishing, though imperfect views of JEHOVAH, in his greatness and love; of Jesus in his comeliness, office, relations, righteousness, power, and grace, do we here obtain! What prospect of life and immortality! We look not at the things which are seen, which are tem∣poral; but at the things which are not seen, which are eternal; we see, that henceforth is laid up for us a crown of righteousness; that we shall awake with Jesus' likeness; and shall be for ever with, and like him; for we shall see him as he is.</P>
<P N="19">19. It resembles the TREASURE <HI>hid in the field</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 44.</NOTE>. How inestimably precious, containing all exceeding great and precious promises, comprehending all inesti∣mable

benefits, all the unsearchable riches of Christ! When possessed, how it enricheth, felicitates, ennobles, and emboldens towards God! encourageth and enables to resist wicked lusts, angels, and men! <HI>In the field</HI> of inspiration it lieth hid, and must be digged up by care∣ful search, meditation, and prayer. And for its sake, are the oracles of Heaven worth ten thousand worlds to my heart.</P>
<P N="20">20. It resembles CHAINS OF GOLD, ROWS OF JEWELS, BORDERS OF GOLD, and STUDS OF SILVER <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10. 11.</NOTE>. How well connected! how comely, precious, firm, durable, enriching, and adorning, are its doctrines and promises to the scripture and church; and to every true member thereof! How they strengthen and adorn the neck of my faith! render my <HI>cheeks,</HI> my countenance, my blush∣ing graces, beautiful and comely! and make my con∣versation-garments, shew splendid and glorious!</P>
<P N="21">21. It is compared to SHOES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 1.</NOTE>. It supports our soul, our grace, our walk; influenceth our affections; marks our liberty, and our royal greatness. The more fixed we be in the faith thereof, the more pleasantly, safely, and swiftly, we proceed in our spiritual journey; and tread Satan, the old serpent, and his agents, under our feet.</P>
<P N="22">22. Its leading truths resemble a FOUNDATION <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 19.</NOTE>. Being fixed on the testimony of God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, it is impossible that they can sink or fall. How gloriously they support and embellish the whole remaining oracles of God! And on them build my soul; build, you saints, your whole hopes of eternal felicity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Metaphors respecting the gospel-dispensation, and or∣dinances thereof.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Metaphors respecting the gospel-dispensation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE dispensation of God's grace, especially under the New Testament, is called the KING∣DOM OF GOD; the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mark i. 14. and Matth. xx. 1.</NOTE>. O the majestic sovereignty, state, and royalty of God therein manifested! O its beautiful order, strength, and dura∣tion! and the honourable privileges therein conferred! What multitudes are thereby connected, and united un∣der Jesus their head! God is the deviser, the establisher, the manager, and his glory the end of it. It is heaven∣ly in its origin; it resembles heaven in holiness, come∣liness, and order; and prepares men for entrance into the heavenly inheritance of the saints in light. The New Testament dispensation is more God-like and heavenly than the Old; holiness is the universal <HI>law of the house;</HI> and its privileges are more spiritual and sanctifying.</P>
<P N="2">2. The gospel dispensation in the apostolic age is re∣presented as a MARRIAGE-DINNER; and that chiefly in the glorious Millennium, is called the MARRIAGE SUPPER <HI>of the Lamb</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 1.—14. Luke xiv. 15.—24. Rev. xix. 7.—9. Matth. viii. 11. 12.</NOTE>. The former is indeed towards the end of time, but nearer its middle than the other, which shall but take place before the last judgment. God hath <HI>killed his oxen and satlings;</HI> hath slain his own Son, to he our provision; hath prepared all possible blessings; and invites every sort of sinners to espouse his Son, and accept of his fulness. From trifling and carnal motives, the Jews, when first invited, refused to receive this mer∣cy and favour; For this they were excluded from the church, and the ordinances thereof; themselves massac∣red by the murdering Romans, and by one another; and their city burnt with fire. But thrice happy! God extended his invitations to the destitute, the wicked, and infamous Gentiles, in whatsoever city or nation they are found! O now our rich provision! our amazing
<PB N="319" REF="323"/>
joy and happiness! our honourable fellowship with God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; with angels, ancient patriarchs, and eminent saints, while the Jewish <HI>chil∣dren of the kingdom</HI> are cast out! How fitly our enter∣tainment prepareth us for our work in the end of the world! qualifieth us to lie down in our dusty beds of the grave! and to enter into our eternal rest! How great JEHOVAH's earnestness to have his house filled with de∣stitute sinners! Upon his invitations what multitudes have entered, and <HI>yet there is room.</HI> By setting before us the sinfulness and misery of our natural state, Jesus' excellency, ability, and readiness to save, and using eve∣ry method to persuade our conscience, he requires his ministerial servants <HI>to compel</HI> us to come in, that his house may be filled. But dreadful shall be our endless misery, if we live in his church, without putting on his Son, as our <HI>righteousness and sanctification!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is represented as the <HI>letting out of a vineyard to husbandmen</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxi. 33.—43.</NOTE>. In the ceremonial form thereof, God gave it to the Jews, and sent his prophets to demand, that they should give him the glory due to his name; these being injuriously maltreated, he sent his Son, whom, it might have been expected, they would reverence and regard; but they murdered him, that they might live as they listed. For these things God miserably destroy∣ed the Jewish nation, and gave the gospel to the Gen∣tiles, that they might bring forth fruits of good works, answerable to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is compared to the <HI>hiring of labourers at differ∣ent hours, to work in a vineyard, and giving all equal wages</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xx. 1.—16.</NOTE>. In the morning of the patriarchal, in the noon-tide of the ceremonial, at the <HI>ninth hour</HI> of the apostolic age, in the <HI>eleventh hour</HI> of the future Millen∣nium, or thousand years reign of the saints, multitudes are DIVinely invited, and brought to Christ, and to his work in the church. Nor shall the eternal blessedness of the former exceed that of the latter. Murmur not, ye Jews, <HI>who bore the burden</HI> of eremonial rites, <HI>and the heat</HI> of laborious service; murmur not, ye primitive Christi∣ans, who <HI>bore the burden</HI> of troublesome work, and <HI>the heat</HI> of scorching persecution; may not JEHOVAH do with
<PB N="320" REF="324"/>
his own as he pleaseth? Is not the whole reward of so∣vereign grace? Let not your eye be evil, because his is good. In the early morning of life, are not some; in its middle or noon are not others; in its evening of old age, are not others, though more rarely, called and drawn to Christ? May not a sovereign God impart to all an equal share of his endless bliss; his gracious reward?</P>
<P N="5">5. It is compared to a <HI>great man's giving pounds or talents to his servants, as he departs to a far country, that they may occupy till he return, call them to an ac∣count, and render them rewards, according to their re∣spective improvement</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 14.—30. Luke xix 11.—27.</NOTE>. Ascending up on high, to receive for himself a kingdom, Jesus committed to men, the precious and useful <HI>pounds</HI> and <HI>talents</HI> of DIVine scrip∣tures, of gospel ordinances, of manifold opportunities of grace and happiness, of holy offices, gifts, and gra∣ces; to some in a greater, to others in a lesser degree. These he requires them to improve, <HI>alway abounding in the work of the Lord.</HI> At the end, he will come, and reckon with them. Such as having real grace, have improven their talents, shall be highly and proportion∣ally rewarded with everlasting honour and joy. Such as, having no real grace, through hard thoughts of Je∣sus, have not improved their gifts, offices, and oppor∣tunities, shall be self-condemned, and cast into endless misery.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the end of the world, it is like to <HI>the calling of wise and foolish virgins to meet the Bridegroom</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 1.—13.</NOTE>. Though, church-members be like virgins in outward purity, in blamelessness of life, and soundness of princi∣ple, and in apparent modesty, and self-denial; yet alas how many of them are not <HI>wise unto salvation!</HI> What multitudes foolishly name the name of Christ, without receiving him into their heart! At the end of time, how dreadful shall be the sloth and security, of both saints and hypocrites! Ere they are aware, Christ shall sum∣mon them to judgment. Happy then, those, who have <HI>oil</HI> of true grace, attending their lamps of profession! their glory shall be brightness; their lamps trimmed; their grace perfected; and themselves shall enter into
<PB N="293" REF="325"/>
immediate and everlasting fellowship with Christ! but oh unhappy these, who have lamps, but no saving grace! None can then be given them; no creature shall be able or willing to help them. They shall be irreversibly ex∣cluded from the fellowship of Christ; and shut up in everlasting torments, where there shall be <HI>weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The gospel-state of the New-Testament church is represented as a REST <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv. 3.</NOTE>. How fully is our free and complete justification through the blood of Jesus therein displayed! and how powerfully applied! how happily we are therein liberated from that servile frame of spirit, which was so common to the Jews, in their worship! The yoke of troublesome ceremonies is no more impo∣sed; nor is our conscience burdened or perplexed, con∣cerning the punctual observance thereof. But the spi∣ritual and easy institutions of the gospel, attended with gracious freedom, strength, and assistance, are come in their room. Blessed rest of heaven! blessed form of wor∣ship, never to be changed in time, and wherein JEHO∣VAH manifests his rest in Christ, and in his love to∣wards us!</P>

<HEAD>II. <HI>Metaphors respecting gospel-ordinances.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GOSPEL ORDINANCES resemble a <HI>woman's</HI> BREASTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song. viii. 1. 10.</NOTE>. They are of two kinds; ordinary and sealing: and these last are now two; baptism and the Lord's supper. How delightfully they adorn the church; and nourish her true children, to everlasting life, with the <HI>sincere milk</HI> of God's word! How delight∣fully, <HI>during the night</HI> of time, Jesus lieth between, and is found in them!</P>
<P N="2">2. They resemble TWIN ROES <HI>feeding among the li∣lies</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song. iv. 5.</NOTE>. How harmonious! how well connected! how comely, pleasant, and pure! how opposite and ruining to the old serpent, and his agents! and how often at∣tacked and wrathfully injured by them! How delightful∣ly maintained! and as it were sed among the promises, and doctrines of the glorious gospel!—And thine it is,

<HI>O Lily of the valley,</HI> and <HI>thy lilies among thorns,</HI> with pleasure to feed therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. They resemble CHARIOTS; LITTERS; and HOR∣SES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. lxvi. 20.</NOTE>. In a swift, majestic, and glorious manner, Jesus therein approacheth to our heart; and triumphant∣ly rides through, and appears in the world. And by them he easily and honourably transports his chosen people through it, to their better, their heavenly coun∣try.</P>
<P N="4">4. They resemble MANDRAKES, or DUDAIM <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 13.</NOTE>. How savoury, medicinal, cooling, and refreshing to our soul! How comely and delightful to our spiritual eye! How effectually they enkindle our love to Jesus and his people! and render us fruitful in good works! Yet alas! how many, by means thereof, lull themselves into such spiritual sleep, as nothing but the flames of hell can awaken them!</P>
<P N="5">5. They resemble SPIKENARD <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 12.</NOTE>. However low and contemptible they seem to carnal men; yet to saints how precious, fragrant, and useful! How they warm our heart, comfort our soul, strengthen our appetite, and cheer our spirit! And truly, O King of kings, it is thy sitting with me at thy table, in intimate fellowship, that makes this <HI>spikenard</HI> send forth its smell, and refresh my soul!</P>
<P N="6">6. They resemble WATERS; and WELLS <HI>of salva∣tion</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. lv. 1. and xii. 3.</NOTE>. How easy, unhampered, and free is my ac∣cess to them! How effectually, by them, Jesus purifies my conscience, and nourisheth my heart! refresheth all my inward powers! cools my lust! and satiates my de∣sire! When I am enabled to enter into their spirit, would I, for ten thousand worlds, forsake their <HI>cold-flow∣ing waters, which come from another place?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. They are compared to MOUNTAINS and HILLS <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 6. Joel iii. 18.</NOTE>. How hard to ascend them aright! In them, how wide is our prospect of eternal things! How they exalt us above the grovelling world! and bring us to the con∣fines of heaven! What noble shadows and wells of spi∣ritual refreshment we find in them! What a glorious
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
forest, Christ the tree of life, and his unnumbered trees of righteousness growing up under his shadow! What blessed river of JEHOVAH and his love, of Jesus and his blood, and of the DIVine Spirit and his influences, that <HI>makes glad the city of our God!—</HI>What pleasant and wholesome air of DIVine breathings! What rich pasture for Jesus' chosen flock is here to be found! What need, carefully to descend from them to worldly concerns, lest we fall, stumble, and be broken, snared, and taken! They are <HI>mountains of myrrh, and hills of frankincense.</HI> What fragrant, medicinal, quickening, and refreshful truths, and breathings of heaven, we there enjoy! But take heed, my soul, even there the serpents lurk. How often you corruptions, you fiends, have I seen you! have I felt your deadly influence, at the very top! in the highest ordinance, and in the best frame! But when felt I these <HI>mountains drop with new wine,</HI> ever fresh, redeem∣ing love; and <HI>these hills flow with milk,</HI> of heart-warm∣ing and restoring grace; and these channels <HI>flow</HI> with the <HI>water</HI> of life, and the <HI>fountain come out of the house of the Lord, and water the valley of Shittim;—</HI>water my debased, earthly, barren heart?</P>
<P N="8">8. They may be called the PATHS <HI>of Christ's flock</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 8.</NOTE>. In them the saints, as they have access, walk with plea∣sure and progress towards the heavenly country.</P>
<P N="9">9. They are likened to SHEPHERDS TENTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In their outward appearance, they are but coarse and de∣spicable. They are easily removed from place to place; they are only calculated for the wilderness of this world; and to them, ye ministers of Christ, ought constantly to attend.</P>
<P N="10">10. They are represented as the COURTS; the HOUSE; the TEMPLE; TABERNACLE; and ALTAR of God <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxiv. 10. and xliii. 3. 4.</NOTE>. There his glory is seen, his presence enjoyed, and his benefits conferred, through Christ, as crucified for us; and in them we offer ourselves spiritual sacrifices to him.</P>
<P N="11">11. They are called STREETS and BROAD WAYS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 2.</NOTE> At the infinite expence of Heaven, they are prepared for men. How carefully to be kept pure and entire! How beautiful and straight! How useful to lead us to
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
the palace of the mighty King! And what multitudes have free access to walk and trade therein!</P>
<P N="12">12. They are represented as TOWERS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 10.</NOTE>. How high and heavenly! How strong and useful for assisting the saints to defend themselves against sin, Satan, and the world! How richly furnished with all spiritual armour!</P>
<P N="13">13. They are likened to CHAMBERS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 4.</NOTE>. Here Christ and his people dwell together. Here they rest, and are refreshed; here he secures and defends them. Here he comes to, and is familiar with them; manifests himself, and makes known the secrets of his covenant. Here they secretly pour out their hearts; worship the Lord of hosts; eat meat which the world knows not of; and labour not in vain in the Lord.</P>
<P N="14">14. They are called a BANQUETING-HOUSE, or HOUSE OF WINE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 4.</NOTE>. What rich stores of everlasting love, and DIVine consolations, are contained in them! And how often therein, are the saints refreshed and ravished with the fulness of God!</P>
<P N="15">15. They resemble RAFTERS <HI>of fir</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song i. 11.</NOTE>. How straight, comely, and self consistent! How heaven-pointed, per∣manent, flourishing and refreshful! How usefully and delightfully they support and connect the church, and establish her true members, in their most holy faith, and their gospel-conversation!</P>
<P N="16">16. They may be compared to GALLERIES. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 5.</NOTE>. Are they not the pleasant, the magnificent, lightsome, and lofty means, in which King Jesus walks, and converseth with his people? is held in their spiritual embrace? and feasts them on his infinite fulness?</P>
<P N="17">17. But the word rendered <HI>galleries</HI> and <HI>rafters,</HI> sig∣nifies also WATERING-TROUGHS <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Is. lv. 1.</NOTE>, to which gospel-ordinances may be compared, because therein Jesus wa∣ters and refresheth his followers, his flock, with his wa∣ter of life, drawn from the deeps of his everlasting love.—So, Lord, evermore refresh my soul.</P>
<P N="18">18. They are represented as MARKET-PLACES at the WATER; as PLACES OF CONCOURSE; as GATES; and DOORS <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 21. and viii. 1. 2. 3 4.</NOTE>. In them Jesus stands and invites multi∣tudes
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
of sinful men to receive his benefits. In them he distributes his prepared goodness to the poor, sells with∣out money and without price. In them we are to wait for him; and, by them, we enter into fellowship with him, and go into the heavenly mansions.</P>
<P N="19">19. They are compared to WINDOWS and LAT∣TICES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 9.</NOTE>. By them the church is beautified, enlight∣ened, and refreshed. In them we enjoy the light of life, which cometh from above; obtain the prospect of spiritual and eternal things; and are refreshed by the north and south breezes of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="20">20. They are compared to KEYS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xvi. 19.</NOTE>. By a proper use of Christ's doctrine, discipline, and government, the church, nay, heaven itself, is ministerially opened to, or shut against, the sons of men.</P>
<P N="21">21. They resemble a GREEN and well-GUARDED BED <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 16.</NOTE>. Being surrounded by DIVine perfections, and holy angels; attended by saithful ministers, what safe and sweet rest and fellowship with Christ may we enjoy in them! O how our hearts are warmed with his love! How we recruit our strength! and renew our youth even as the eagles! How sweetly we enjoy the sleep of God's beloved! do cease from our sins, our self-righteousness, and worldly labour! and are rendered fruitful to God in the works of holiness!</P>
<P N="22">22. They are compared to a TABLE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song i. 12.</NOTE>. To display his munisicence, Jesus framed them; and furnisheth them with all the blessings of his new covenant. With de∣light and pleasure, he continues ever present in them, to meet with, speak to, and feast his people with his flesh and blood. Truly, that which is set on it is <HI>full of fatness.</HI> For in this mount, on this table, doth the Lord of hosts make for all people, saints and sinners, Jews and Gentiles, a <HI>feast of fat things, full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined;</HI> JEHOVAH, in all his fulness and love; Jesus, in his person, offices, righ∣teousness, and grace; and the blessed Spirit in all his characters, operations, and influences.—Lord, may this table never become our trap; let never DIVine or∣dinances tend to the hardening of our heart.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="326" REF="332"/>
23. They resemble ROWS <HI>of</HI> JEWELS <HI>on the cheek</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10.</NOTE>. How mysterious their order, and DIVine their connec∣tion! How they adorn the church's outward form! and make the saint's face to shine!</P>
<P N="24">24. They resemble CHAINS OF GOLD <HI>about the neck</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. How precious, durable, and firmly, connected! How closely they adhere to, and illucidate the scripture! warm, support, and protect our faith!</P>
<P N="25">25. They resemble BORDERS OF GOLD, with STUDS of SILVER <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song i. 11.</NOTE>. How precious all! but some more im∣portant than others! How comely and durable! How enriching to the saints, and ornamental to the church! How attended by, and productive of, well-tried, ho∣nourable, and precious gifts and graces!</P>
<P N="26">26. They are represented as a DIGGING and DUNG∣ING about sinful men <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 8.</NOTE>. Being attended with con∣vincing providences and influences, they import and manifest the most astonishing patience, pains, and care, of the Most High towards men; and render us inexcu∣sable, if, notwithstanding, we continue in our spiritual barrenness.</P>
<P N="27">27. Gospel truths and ordinances are represented as a TRUST <HI>committed to men</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 20.</NOTE>. How solemnly! How DIVinely, and with proper gifts attending, are they com∣mitted and entrusted to ministers and private Christians, that they may be preserved pure and entire, from gene∣ration to generation! And at the peril of our honour and life, do we betray or lose any of them.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1. <HI>Metaphors respecting God's favour.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GOD's free favour and grace is compared to a KING <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom v. 21.</NOTE>. Where sin reigned unto death, it reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ. With what amazing glory and sovereignty, it acts; and doth whatsoever it pleaseth! Every DIVine person, perfection, purpose, and providence, concurs to promote its honour. Every creature is employed to ad∣vance its designs. It conquers every foe; subdues to it∣self every chosen sinner of mankind; rules with absolute dominion in every saint; and receives from him a tri∣bute of endless praise.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is likened to an overflowing SEA or RIVER <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii. 18. 19.</NOTE>. O its height, depth, length, and breadth! It passeth knowledge. It reacheth from eternity to eternity; from hell to heaven! It bears down all opposition; washeth away every stain; covers every mountain of guilt and misery; spreads into every person, power, and con∣cern, of an elect world, and maketh glad the whole city of our God.—Blessed river! boundless ocean! be thou the sole source of my happiness. Let all my well-springs of promises and ordinances be in thee; and cause eve∣ry thing whithersoever thou comest, even my dead heart, to live.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. <HI>Metaphors respecting the change of our state.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The change of our state is represented as a CALL∣ING <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 1</NOTE>. By Jesus' gospel-invitation, we are therein
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
powerfully called, and drawn from Satan to God; from darkness and ignorance to God's marvellous light; from sin to purity and holiness; from misery to happiness; from earth to heaven; in fine, from the fellowship of the law, and our lusts, to the fellowship of God's Son.—Arise, my soul, <HI>the Master is come, and calleth for thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The change of our state is represented as Christ's SEEKING and FINDING us out <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth xviii. 11. 12. 13.</NOTE>. With amazing love, care, and skill, he pursueth us by his word and provi∣dence. By his servants, he sends forth his word, that, in various forms and expressions suiting every case, it may run speedily; and, through the Spirit, hit our par∣ticular condition, touch our conscience, and draw our heart. Having thus apprehended us, he brings us to his presence, instates us in his favour, and restores to us the felicity and usefulness of which sin had deprived us.—Lord, when I know not were to find myself, do thou seek and find me.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is called a MARRIAGE, or ESPOUSALS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 11.</NOTE>. In consequence of our Redeemer's preparing himself for us, by undertaking our cause, assuming our nature, clo∣thing himself with wedding robes of finished righteous∣ness, fulfilled in our stead; in consequence of his pre∣paring a place for us, by blood and intercession; and of his wooing us by the word of his gospel, he, in the predestinated moment of power, and his time of love, breaks our natural union and affection to the broken law; to Satan and our corrupt inclinations; and by his Spi∣rit enters and dwells in our heart; and enableth us to accept of him, as our only, our everlasting husband. As such, he hath fellowship with us in bearing our guilt; and in our infirmities and afflictions; in our grace and exercise; and we with him in his righteousness, strength honour, and work. Mutually he and we dwell with, esteem, love, desire, delight in, rejoice over, and mani∣fest our mind one to another.—O blessed marriage! the joy of Jesus, and of my soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is represented as an IMPLANTING or INGRAET∣ING <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom vi. 5.</NOTE>. It is by the amazing patience and labour of God, we are cut off from the stock of the fallen Adam; are closely united to, rooted and grounded in Christ;
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
made partakers of his death and resurrection; and so revive, and bring forth fruit unto God.—Here being planted, O my soul, thou shalt cast forth thy roots as Lebanon.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is represented as a CONQUEST <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlv. 3. 4. 5.</NOTE>. Finding us the subjects of the law, and of Satan, the world, and our lusts, filled with rage and enmity against him and his people, Jesus Christ, with infinite power, wis∣dom, and patience, attacks our soul with the sword of his Spirit,—his word; fastens in us the arrows of con∣vincing and heart-drawing influences; slays our enmi∣ty, by his powerful promises and bleeding love; constrains us to yield our souls, take his easy yoke upon us, and consent to be his willing, affectionate, and obedient sub∣jects.—So, Lord Jesus, conquer multitudes; conquer me.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is represented as a LIBERATION <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Zech. ix. 11. 12.</NOTE>. Finding us in a most wretched, shameful, and slavish captivity, to Satan and our sinful corruption, and in the unclean, unwholesome, unhappy, cold, dark, disgraceful, and confining prison of our natural state; Jesus powerfully overthroweth the dominion of our enslavers in us; loo∣seth the chains of our guilt, by the application of his all pardoning blood; breaks the fetters of our lust, ig∣norance, and enmity, by the power of his grace; and bestows on us the most glorious freedom, honour, and rest.—Out of prison, I come to reign.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is represented as a DEATH <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 19. 20.</NOTE>. Herein we partake of the influence of Jesus' death. Our old man receives his mortal wound, of which he afterward dieth daily. In it our hopes of happiness by our own works, our relation and love to the law as a covenant, our uni∣versal study to serve it, our superlative regard to sinful and earthly things, painfully expire.—So may I die, that I may live unto God.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is represented as a BURIAL <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 12.</NOTE>. In it, we par∣take of the virtue of Jesus' death and burial; and are conformed to him. We commence God's hidden ones, whose glory doth not appear; and are rendered con∣temptible

<P N="9">9. It is called a RESURRECTION <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xx1vii 1.—14.</NOTE>. Being by na∣ture in the most earthly, withered, dry, lifeless, and lothsome condition, Jesus, by his Spirit of life, quick∣eneth us; causeth us to pass from death to life; brings us from our graves of condemnation and lust; clothes us with the white robes of his righteousness and grace; and qualifieth us to work and walk with God, angels, and good men.—So let a poor sleeper in the dust, a∣wake and sing.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is called a CREATION <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii. 10.</NOTE>. Unassisted by any creature, Jesus, by his almighty power and word, forms the ever-abiding structure of grace, the <HI>new crea∣ture,</HI> out of nothing. His work he commenceth in the forming of spiritual light and knowledge. Daily he adds new ornaments thereto, till, against the Sab∣bath of eternal rest, it be fully perfected.—So, Lord, <HI>create in me a clean heart,</HI> and <HI>renew a right spirit with∣in me.</HI></P>

Therein God forms a <HI>new creature,</HI> directly opposite to our indwelling corruptions, of ignorance, unbelief, en∣mity, and the like; makes all things new. He fur∣nisheth our mind with <HI>new</HI> light, thoughts, and designs. He imparts to our conscience, purity, penetration, softness, tenderness, activity. He bestoweth on our will, <HI>new</HI> inclinations and desires. He sets our affec∣tions on <HI>new,</HI> spiritual, and heavenly objects. He fixeth in our memory <HI>new</HI> treasures of DIVine truths and gra∣cious experience. In fine, he giveth us a <HI>new heart;</HI> and makes his <HI>new Spirit</HI> to dwell within us. By his grace he disposeth us to relish and choose <HI>new compa∣nions;</HI> and to lead a <HI>new,</HI> holy, humble, self-denied conversation, of charity and love, out of a pure consci∣ence, and from faith unfeigned.</P>

12. It is represented as a SECOND, a HEAVENLY BIRTH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John iii. 3. 5.</NOTE>. Of the incorruptible seed of his word and grace, Jesus, our spiritual Father, begets us again to a lively hope. Curiously and wonderfully, we are con∣formed to his image! Without our preparation or as∣fistance, there is formed a marvellous contexture of grace, a <HI>new man.</HI> We are made partakers of a DIVine and heavenly nature. By his painful sorrow and suf∣fering, by ministers painful labours, and with our own painful experience, we are born and brought into the <HI>new,</HI> the heavenly world, of a <HI>new-</HI>covenant state, and become related to God, angels, and saints.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is called a CIRCUMCISION, <HI>not of the flesh, but of the heart</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 11. Deut. xxx. 6.</NOTE>. Therein God, by his word and Spi∣rit, sharply pricks and wounds our heart and conscience; exposeth to us our spiritual nakedness and guilt; cuts off the reigning power of indwelling corruption; pre∣vents our after pollution; manifests and confirms our interest in his covenant; and gives us a constant and a∣biding mark of our relation to him. And without it, we are exposed to endless destruction.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is called BAPTISM <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. iii. 11.</NOTE>. Therein we are graciously received into covenant with God, and enti∣tled to the privileges of his people. Therein, washed in Jesus' blood, and purified by the influence of his Spirit, we solemnly receive God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as our Parent, Saviour, Sanctifier, and <HI>all in all;</HI> and cheerfully dedicate ourselves to his ser∣vice.—My soul, hath Jesus baptized me with the holy Spirit, and with his fiery and sin-purifying influence?</P>
<P N="15">15. It is called a TURNING or CONVERSION <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 18.</NOTE>. Therein we are DIVinely turned from the paths of hell to the ways of heaven; from darkness to light; from guilt to righteousness; from sin to holiness; from slavery to freedom; from poverty to wealth; from rebellion and enmity, to favour, acceptance, and intimate friendship with God; from distance to nearness; from sinful sick∣ness and weakness, to spiritual foundness and strength. So turn me, Lord, and I shall be turned.</P>

<HI>God's dear Son</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 13.</NOTE>. By his grace Jesus lays hold upon us; bears us in the arms of his power and love; carries us into a new-covenant state; in which we are only subject to him, and not to the broken law, raging de∣vil, or reigning lusts.</P>
<P N="17">17. The work of grace in mens heart is called the KINGDOM OF GOD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 20.</NOTE>. In the day of his power, Jesus invades and enters our heart; by his word and Spirit, he overthrows the strong holds of inherent corruption; overturns the reigning power of Satan and our lusts; conquers every faculty of our soul; fixeth his palace and throne, and writes his law in our inward parts; erects the judicature of a purged, enlightened, and tender conscience: he entitleth us to all his fulness and trea∣sure; enters us into league with his omnipotent perfec∣tions, mighty angels, and useful creatures on earth. Storing our inward powers with his DIVine armour, he disposeth and enableth us to wage war with sin, Satan, and the world. Thrice blessed kingdom, consisting not in meat and drink; but in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost!—Thrice happy and honoured is my soul, if this kingdom, that cannot be removed, be within me!</P>
<P N="18">18. The change of family herein is called ADOP∣TION <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 5. 6.</NOTE>. Finding us children of the devil, and heirs of wrath, God, in infinite mercy and kindness, puts us among his children of angels and saints; and giveth us an undoubted and everlasting title to all the privileges of sonship. His name he puts upon us; his Spirit in us; and his image on us. His angels he appoints to guard, and his ministers to inspect and instruct us. Our prayers he hears, our requests he grants, and allows us familiar boldness and intimacy with him. He teacheth, directs, feeds, clothes, arms, protects, comforts, and cor∣rects us. Irreversibly he bequeaths to us the everlasting, the <HI>pleasant land, and goodly heritage of the hosts of na∣tions,</HI> the whole fulness of God. O astonishing! when guilt, pollution, and enmity, might have justly provo∣ked his endless detestation, he said to my soul, <HI>Thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldst; wilt thou not</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
<HI>front this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?</HI> When, as an infernal fiend, I replied, <HI>What have I to do with thee?

I</HI> WILL be to him <HI>a Father, and he</HI> SHALL <HI>be to me a son.</HI> How could my enmity, my inward rock, with∣stand such melting love!—Straight all my powers cried out, My Father; my Guide; my God; my ALL.</P>
<P N="19">19. Our new covenant state is called a REST <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 28.</NOTE>. Here, in Jesus' blood, as the means of protecting our soul, and appeasing our conscience; in his power, as an antidote against every fear and danger; in his love and loveliness, as the all-satisfying object of our desire; in his faithful promise, as our infallible security for glory, honour, immortality, eternal life; we rest safe from eve∣ry wrathful event and enemy. There is no condemna∣tion to us. No evil can befal us. God and his crea∣tures are in a covenant of peace with us. In this hap∣py state too we rest from slavish service to the broken law; and from our sinful fulfilment of the lusts of the flesh and of the mind.</P>

<HEAD>III. <HI>Metaphors respecting the pardon of sin.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Pardon of sin, which is often put for the whole of our justification, is represented as God's <HI>being merciful to our unrighteousness</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. viii. 12.</NOTE>. It is entirely of his free, rich, and sovereign grace and mercy, that he doth not avenge, but forgive our unrighteousness of heart or life. O grace, grace unto it!</P>
<P N="2">2. It is represented as a COVERING <HI>of sin</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxii. 1.</NOTE>. By the imputation of Jesus' righteousness for our robe, our guilt is so hid and covered, as no more to expose us to God's revenging wrath; nor can it justly annoy our conscience with legal horror.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is called a REMISSION or FORGIVENESS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 31.</NOTE>. Therein God most fully acquits us of the charge of our crimes; secures us against the avenging and wrathful
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
punishment thereof; and removes every legal bar, that obstructs our hope, our happiness, or comfort.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is represented as God's NOT REMEMBERING <HI>our sin</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xliii. 25.</NOTE>. Having pardoned it, Gôd no more continues to charge or punish it upon us; but allows us as emi∣nent friendship, familiarity, and fulness of blessings, as if we never had sinned. How often, my soul, hath he taken me into his bosom, as if I had been an innocent angel!</P>
<P N="5">5. It is represented as his BLOTTING OUT of sin <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 1. 9.</NOTE>. Upon the imputation of Jesus' blood to our person and conscience, our sinful debts, and the demands of satis∣faction for them, are so dropt from the book of God's judicial remembrance, that neither he, nor the broken law, nor our conscience, have the least remaining ground to charge them upon us, in order to require satisfaction for them.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is represented as his <HI>casting our sins behind his back, or into the deeps of the sea; and his putting and re∣moving it far from us</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. xxxviii. 17. Mic. vii. 19. Psal. ciii. 12.</NOTE>. For when it is pardoned, he neither will, nor can charge it upon us; nor suffer any wrathful punishment to come near us. Our sins are buried the deeps of JEHOVAH'S love and Jesus' blood; nor ought fears of DIVine curses or condemnation in the least to dismay us. Jesus hath taken away the <HI>hand∣writing</HI> of law-charges of guilt, as well as of ceremo∣nial ordinances, that was against us, and hath nailed it to his cross, from whence it can never be loosed.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is represented as a PURGING <HI>away of sin, through the sprinkling of,</HI> or <HI>washing us in clean wa∣ter</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvi. 25.</NOTE>. By the saving application of Jesus' infinitely pure and purifying blood, the legal guilt of our sin is completely removed from our conscience; and a suffi∣cient foundation is laid for purging away its moral filth, by the Spirit of sanctification.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is represented as God's <HI>making our scarlet and crimson-coloured, our hideous crimes, white as snow and wool</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is. i. 18.</NOTE>. By the imputation of Jesus' blood and righ∣teousness,

all their terrible appearances do, as it were, evanish; and purity, peace, righteousness, and rest, suc∣ceed in their room.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is compared to the <HI>dispelling of a cloud, or thick cloud</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xliv. 22.</NOTE>. Hereby, God alone removes the guilt of our numerous, our innumerable, and frightful crimes; re∣moves the ground of our gloomy apprehensions of his threatened vengeance, which, by nature, hangs over our head; gives us access to see himself in mercy, and comfort; and to obtain delightful views, and well-grounded hopes, of the heavenly glory.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is represented as the <HI>giving us a white stone, with a new name written on it</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 17.</NOTE>; in allusion to an ancient custom of the Greeks, their voting sentences of absolution, by casting into a vessel white stones, where∣on was sometimes written the name of the person absol∣ved. God giveth us our sentence of pardon, in the pure, peaceable, glorious, and everlasting promise of the gospel, directly pointed and applied to our heart. Hath God done so to me? Then let me never be merciful to any iniquity; let me never cover my transgressions as Adam; let me never forgive my wicked self; let me remember my evil ways, and be ashamed and confound∣ed for all that I have done; let my sin be ever before me.</P>

It is the immediate effect of Christ's living in us by his Spi∣rit; it is a mysterious, pleasant, and profitable mercy, maintained by the constant, the quickening influence of Heaven, the daily application of Jesus' flesh and blood.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is represented as God's WASHING <HI>us in water,</HI> and PURIFYING <HI>us in fire</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. iv. 4.</NOTE>. By the continued ap∣plication of Jesus' word, his blood and spirit; and by manifold troubles, temptations, and persecutions, he gradually, skilfully, and powerfully purgeth out our sin∣ful corruption, till we become like gold tried in the fire; whiter than snow; without spot, or wrinkle, or
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
any such thing.—Having these exceeding great and precious promises, O my soul, cleanse thyself from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is represented as God's SUBDUING <HI>our iniqui∣ties</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mic. vii. 19.</NOTE>. By the application of the blood of the Lamb, by the Almighty Spirit, and the all-conquering word of his grace, applied to, and working in our heart, he gradually weakens, and puts out our inward nations of lusts, enableth our graces to tread upon them, and oc∣cupy their room in our heart, our speech, and behavi∣our.</P>

Being DIVinely drawn and ad∣mitted, we therein, with secrecy and safety, enjoy emi∣nent familiarity with him; are refreshed and nourished with his delicate provision; are enabled and encouraged to utter all our complaints into his bosom; and have the secrets of his covenant and promise, and sometimes of his purpose and providence, unfolded to our soul.—"O send forth thy light, and thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to thine holy hill; then will I go to God's altar, to God mine exceeding joy."</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4. It is called the KISSES <HI>of Christ's mouth</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 2.</NOTE>. By his various promises, how sweetly are his everlasting kindness, mercy, and grace, manifested to our soul! How powerfully this testifieth and assures us, that tho' he was angry, his anger is turned away, and he com∣forteth us! With what delightful influence it animates and enhanceth our love to him!</P>
<P N="5">5. It is compared to LIFE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxx. 5.</NOTE>. How agile, alert, and active, it renders our soul in the work of God! How pleasant! how mysterious and useful!—Life, O Jesus, lieth in thy favour; natural life is but a death, a hell, without thy presence and love. I live, if I stand fast in the Lord.</P>

<P N="1">1. THE inward principle, or implanted habit of grace, is called the SPIRIT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.

It is called an <HI>hidden man;</HI> it is hidden from Satan, that he cannot destroy it; from the world, that they cannot understand it; from other saints, that they cannot certainly discern it.

How softened by the love! how readily im∣pressed with the word and providence of God! how readily it bends under his influence; and resigns to his sovereign will!</P>
<P N="7">7. It is called LIFE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 10.</NOTE>. By the breathing of his word and Spirit, God alone forms it. How pleasant, precious, and honourable is it! and how comely and active in serving God, and in promoting our own happiness, it renders our foul!</P>
<P N="8">8. It is called LIGHT <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 8.</NOTE>. To us, how mysterious and incomprehensible is its nature! From the Sun of righteousness it wholly proceeds. And how pure, pe∣netrating!—how active, refreshful, enlightening and directing to our soul! What a blessed prelude and ear∣nest of everlasting felicity!</P>
<P N="9">9. It is INCORRUPTIBLE SEED conveyed into our heart by the word of God <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 23. 1 John. iii. 9.</NOTE>. Being, with DIVine labour and wisdom, planted and sown in our heart, watered with the rain and dew of the holy Spirit, and warmed with the love, the rays, of the Sun of righteousness, it never rots, or consumes; never gives place to sinful lust; but flourisheth as corn and trees; and, though in different degrees, brings forth fruit into everlasting life.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is a ROOT <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Matth. vii. 17. 18. and xii. 33. and xiii. 21. Mark. iv. 28.</NOTE>, into which the word of God is spiritually ingrafted; and which, being of an abiding and fixed nature, produceth many Christian tempers, and gracious exercises, and grows up very gradually.</P>
<P N="11">11. It resembes a GRAIN <HI>of mustard-seed</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 31. 32.</NOTE>. From the smallest beginnings, it grows up, till it be exceed∣ing strong, visible, and useful, for the seasoning and improvment of providence, and for the protection of our soul. How sweetly this less than handful of seed, cast into the tops of mountains, into our rocky barren heart, shakes with fruit! O how the particular graces flourish! how the good works abound!</P>
<P N="12">12. It resembles an HEAP OF WHEAT <HI>set about with lilies</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 2.</NOTE>. O the excellency; the abundance; the va∣riety
<PB N="343" REF="349"/>

<P N="11">11. It is compared to SPIKENARD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 12.</NOTE>. How low and contemptible, in the view of carnal men! but how precious and fragrant to Christ and his saints! How ef∣fectually it warms, nourisheth, preserves from corruption, strengthens and refresheth our heart! When Jesus, our King, is sensibly present, how sweetly it sends forth the smell thereof, in heavenly desire, and holy exercise!</P>
<P N="12">12. It may be compared to MANDRAKES <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 13.</NOTE>. In e∣very form, how delightful, fragrant, and comely! How powerfully it cools our indwelling lust; our fiery pertur∣bations of soul! heals our spiritual maladies! attracts our affections to Jesus! and renders us fruitful in good works!</P>
<P N="13">13. It resembles all <HI>pleasant fruits, and chief spices of camphire, calamus, saffron,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 12. 13.</NOTE>. What a flourish∣ing, fragrant, and delightful garden of God, it renders our wilderness soul! How DIVersified its various forms of faith, of hope, of love, repentance, humility, pati∣ence, resignation, and the like! How rare, precious, and pleasant! How effectually it cheers our heart! pre∣serves from spiritual corruption and rottenness! How ever green, incorruptible, and growing! How whole∣some and medicinal to our soul! And do not some par∣ticular graces, of faith, hope, love, like calamus, camphire, and myrrh, ascend on high, mount toward Jesus and heavenly things; while repentance, self denial, patience, resignation, like spikenard and saffron, couch beneath?</P>
<P N="14">14. It resembles <HI>all manner of</HI> PLEASANT FRUITS, <HI>new and old, laid up at our gates for Christ</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 13.</NOTE>. O the abundance and variety of particular graces! How con∣stantly they receive new supply from Jesus' fulness! and add to their former growth! And for his pleasure and honour, their whole exercise in DIVine ordinances, and

manifestation to the world, is designed and calculated.</P>
<P N="15">15. It is compared to GOOD GROUND <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 8. 23. Luke viii. 15.</NOTE>, on which the <HI>good seed</HI> of God's word being sown, brings forth a∣bundance of fruits of holiness, to the honour of God, and the advantage of our soul.</P>
<P N="16">16. It is compared to <HI>all the</HI> POWDERS <HI>of the merchant,</HI> or <HI>apothecary</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song iii. 6.</NOTE>.

How rich and costly! purchased by Jesus' blood; compounded by his skill; and received out of his fulness; how effectually they perfume our nature and work! and render it amiable to God and his people!</P>
<P N="17">17. It is compared to SALT <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 50.</NOTE>. It is of a durable and purifying nature. It pricks, pains, and puts away our corruption. It preserves us from becoming rotten, unsavoury, and noisome in our disposition and practice. It heals our soul; and testifies our friendship and recon∣ciliation with God. Be you, my heart, my speech, my work, always seasoned with it.</P>
<P N="18">18. It is compared to LEAVEN <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 33.</NOTE>. However weak, and inconsiderable at first, it gradually, powerfully, and often insensibly, conquers and transforms our whole heart and life, into its likeness and image!</P>
<P N="19">19. It is compared to a CHAIN OF GOLD <HI>about the neck</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10. 11.</NOTE>; consisting of the precious, solid, lasting, and DIVersified links of knowledge, hope, humility, meekness, love, repentance, zeal, thankfulness, contentment, sin∣cerity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> beautifully connected. It flows from, and depends on our spiritual <HI>neck</HI> of the promise, and word of God, and surrounds, adorns, and strengthens the <HI>neck</HI> of our faith.</P>
<P N="20">20. It resembles ROWS OF JEWELS <HI>on the cheek;</HI> BOR∣DERS OF GOLD <HI>with</HI> STUDS OF SILVER <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. How di∣stinguished the value, the purity, the adorning and en∣riching virtue of these various graces! In what comely order, and beautifying influence, they appear in an holy, humble life! How agreeable, when these <HI>golden bor∣ders</HI> are attended with <HI>silver gifts,</HI> and holy fruits, of the Spirit!</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="345" REF="351"/>
21. It is called a GOOD TREASURE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 52. and xii. 35.</NOTE>. It is very pre∣cious, useful, and enriching; and by means of it, we are enabled to give much glory to God, and do much good to men.</P>
<P N="22">22. It, with its attending benefits, are like GOLD TRIED <HI>in the fire</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 19.</NOTE>. How precious, pure, substan∣tial, satisfying, and durable! No fiery oracles of hea∣ven, no furnaces of fiery troubles, can destroy them; but discover their distinguished value. May I ever lay up this gold as the dust; and as the stones of the brook.</P>
<P N="23">23. It is compared to a ROBE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 24.</NOTE>. Skilfully it is fra∣med by the power and wisdom of God. Effectually it warms, adorns, and protects our heart. My soul, be thou clothed herewith. Let it adorn my inward pow∣ers, and shine forth in my conversation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Metaphors respecting particular graces, knowledge, faith, hope, love, repentance, zeal, humility.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>I. <HI>Metaphors respecting knowledge.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SPiritual knowledge is a FOUNTAIN OF LIFE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It shews us the nature of life, spiritual and eternal, and the means of attaining it. It refines and sanctifies our, natural life; is the means of spiritual; and the means, beginning, and earnest of eternal. It teacheth and en∣gageth our heart to receive Jesus, the resurrection and the life, into our heart; and it is eternal life to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.</P>
<P N="2">2. Saving knowledge and true faith resemble EYES and EARS <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 4. Is. lv. 3.</NOTE>. Thereby our souls are adorned and beau∣tified. Thereby we discern the truth; behold the per∣son, and apprehend the work of Christ, and his Father. We espy our path of duty, avoid dangers, and obtain exactness in our work. We attend to, and hear the voice of the Son, the word, the providence of God; hear, that our soul may live; hearken and hear, for the time to come; are led out, to realize, and prepare for, an eternal state.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="346" REF="352"/>
3. They resemble DOVES EYES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 15. and iv. 1.</NOTE>, because of their purity, their clearness, their loveliness, meekness, single∣ness; their chaste affection to Christ, and quick discern∣ing of wholesome provision to our soul.</P>
<P N="4">4. They may be compared to the FISH-POOLS <HI>of Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 4.</NOTE>, because of their beauty, their perspicuity, their unmoveableness, their abundant supply from Jesus, the Fountain of living wa∣ters: and for their tendency to discover ourselves to us; that we may thereby be induced to hearty repentance, holy modesty, cordial humility, and eminent self-denial.</P>
<P N="5">5. Spiritual knowledge, prudence, and faith, re∣semble the NOSE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 4. 8.</NOTE>. By them we relish the fragrancy of spiritual things; discern the noisome nature of sin, the dangerous approach of our spiritual enemies, and the unsavouriness of created enjoyments. By these is our religious appearance exceedingly beautified. By the exercise thereof, do our apple-like smelling breath of holy desires and endeavours, mark the inward sound∣ness of our heart.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>II. <HI>Further metaphors respecting faith.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="5">5. Faith is our spiritual MOUTH <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxi. 10.</NOTE>. Thereby we taste and see that God is good: we receive Jesus as the food of our soul: we express our mind to God in prayer and praise; and to our neighbours, in holy and edifying converse; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is our spiritual TEETH <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 6.</NOTE>; by which we chew the bread of life in holy meditations, heavenly desires, and assured persuasions of his being the all-suited, the all-comprehending, and unspeakable gift of God to us.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is our spiritual NECK <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Song i. 10. and vii. 4.</NOTE>; which joins us to Jesus our glorious Head; is the means of our corre∣spondence with, and receiving nourishment from him; supports our towering grace of hope; and renders us stately and glorious.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is our spiritual HANDS and ARMS <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Song v. 5.</NOTE>; by which
<PB N="347" REF="353"/>
we receive and embrace the all-glorious Redeemer; hold him fast by his promises, work out our salvation with fear and trembling; war against, and conquer our spiritual foes; and how pleasantly it drops <HI>with the sweet-smelling myrrh</HI> of Jesus' influence, when he gra∣ciously opens and draws out our heart!</P>
<P N="9">9. It resembles a <HI>newly-washed, even-shorn, and fruit∣ful</HI> FLOCK <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song iv. 2.</NOTE>. How self-consistent, are its various acts! all washed in a Saviour's blood and Spirit! all fed in the pasture of his word; and bringing forth a∣bundaut fruits of holiness to the honour of God!</P>
<P N="10">10. It is like the TOWER <HI>of David, builded for an ar∣moury</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song. iv. 4.</NOTE>. How inexpressibly high, firm, and im∣pregnable! and useful to defend our souls; or annoy their foes! How richly stored with all the armour of God! Like a <HI>tower of ivory,</HI> how self-consistent, pre∣cious, comely, and strong! And <HI>like the tower of Leba∣non looking toward Damascus;</HI> it, with our spiritual knowledge and prudence, chiefly watches against, and opposes our unbelief, our pride, our legality, and other <HI>Syrian-like</HI> principal enemies of our soul.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is compared to a SHIELD <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph, vi. 16.</NOTE>. Depending on, and improving God in Christ as our Shield, and our ex∣ceeding great reward, it turns every way, and eminently contributes to protect our inner-man, from all the fiery darts of the devil.</P>
<P N="12">12. It is compared to GOLD TRIED in the fire <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 7.</NOTE>. How pure, precious, durable, and useful! How tried in the fire of God's probatory word! and in the fire of temptation and trouble! It is <HI>much more precious than gold.</HI> It is the purchase of Jesus' blood; the distin∣guished gift of JEHOVAH's hand. It adorns our soul, conforms us to the image of God. It furnisheth us with spiritual life, liberty, health, nourishment, and glory, from the fulness of Christ. Nor can thieves, or any creature, deprive us of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. Faith and loveresemble <HI>two towering</HI> BREASTS <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 10.</NOTE>. How near and comely their connection! What mutual and affectionate embracers of Jesus, the beloved! All
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
the night of trouble and time, he lies in their midst.—What an abundant source of edification to others around! How sure a token of our ripeness for the celestial marriage with Christ, is their eminent growth in our soul.</P>
<P N="14">14. They resemble TWIN ROES <HI>feeding among li∣lies</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 3.</NOTE>. What harmony, loveliness, and vivacity are in them! What opposition to Satan and his serpentine seed! What sad harassment and trouble, they, especially in a day of carnal security, receive from those! But how glorious and surprising, though difficult, are their conquests! How delightfully they dwell in the heart of <HI>lily-like</HI> saints, and are nourished among the <HI>lilies</HI> of gospel-truth!</P>
<P N="15">15. They resemble WINGS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xl. 30.</NOTE>. In the exercise thereof, by the breathing of the Holy Ghost, we fly above this world, and its earthly concerns; above the clouds of ignorance, guilt, and affliction; and ascend to Jesus, our exalted Saviour, and the things above.</P>
<P N="16">16. They are compared to a BREAST-PLATE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 8.</NOTE>. Constantly and effectually they protect our heart from Satan's temptations, or the hurt thereof; and from the hurt or horror of trouble.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>III. <HI>Metaphors respecting hope.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="2">2. Hope resembles a HEAD <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 5.</NOTE>. Supported by faith as a neck, it mightily tends to preserve us from sinking amidst waves of adversity. It is an especial seat of our spiritual vivacity, courage, and beauty. And, when lively, it produceth an unnumbered multitude of good works.</P>
<P N="3">3. It resembles CARMEL <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. How heavenly its height, foundation, and object! How wide its prospect of the promised land! and of the sea, the ocean of endless duration! How noted its fragrancy and fruit∣fulness.</P>
<P N="4">4. It resembles CRIMSON <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. <HI>Christ</HI> crucified <HI>is our hope,</HI> the author, foundation, and object of it. Through his bloody death, we obtain a <HI>good hope,</HI> are begotten
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
through his resurrection to a <HI>lively hope;</HI> and to be with him for ever, is the sum, the all, for which we hope.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is an ANCHOR <HI>sure and stedfast, entering into that within the vail</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 19. 20.</NOTE>. Through well-grounded hopes of heaven our souls are secured, that no weight can sink our spirit; no storm of temptation can drive us away; no floods of tribulation can hurt or dismay us. Fix, my soul, thy anchor, thy hope, to a strong faith within thee; cast it forth of thyself. Fix it in Jesus, the immoveable rock, and the unseen scenes of a distant, a celestial world.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is compared to an HELMET <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 8.</NOTE>. What signal protection and safety it affords to our soul! How ter∣rible it renders us to our spiritual enemies! How bold and undaunted in fighting with, resisting, and attack∣ing them!</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>IV. <HI>Metaphors respecting love; four of which are joined with those of faith.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="5">5. Love is compared to DEATH and the GRAVE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>. It conquers our heart, and every opposer: renders us dead to our lusts, our righteousness, our wisdom, our will, our carnal profit or honour. It disposeth us to die for the honour and testimony of Jesus, and for the spiritual interests of his people. Like the grave, it se∣parateth us from the world, and insatiably hungers and thirsts after the fulness of Christ.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is compared to COALS OF FIRE, <HI>that have a most vehement flame:</HI> and zeal for Christ is likened to a <HI>con∣suming fire which eats us up</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 6. Psal. lxix. 9. and cxix. 139.</NOTE>. Our love being fixed on a known, though unseen Redeemer, how it melts our heart! inflames our desire after him! purifies our soul from the dross of corruption! insatiably presseth after further fellowship and conform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty with him! Nor can floods of ungodly men, of persecution, affliction, temp∣tation, desertion, corruption, or law-terrors, quench or destroy it. True zeal burns up, not these around us,
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>
with carnal contention, and angry reviling; but our own heart, with grief and concern that Jesus is disho∣noured; and with earnest desire and endeavour to have him exalted.</P>
<P N="7">7. Love and harmony among brethren in nature, office, or profession, is like OINTMENT and DEW <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxiii. 1. 2. 3.</NOTE>. How it refresheth, exhilarates, beautifies, and spiri∣tually fructifies themselves and others around!</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>V. <HI>Metaphors respecting repentance.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Repentance is represented as a BROKENNESS and RENDING <HI>of heart</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 17. Joel ii. 13.</NOTE>. How, therein, the hammer of God's word and providence breaks our heart to pieces! How our whole soul is pressed and pained with views of her own sinfulness! How ready to be melted with Jesus' love, and formed as he pleaseth!</P>
<P N="2">2. It is represented as an ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 17.</NOTE>. While looking on a crucified Christ, we mourn, and in his name request forgiveness, how highly God regards our exercise! how readily he grants our petitions!</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>VI. <HI>Metaphors respecting humility.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Humility is represented as an ORNAMENT and ROBE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 4. and v. 5.</NOTE>. Eminently ought it to appear in our whole conversation, which is thereby rendered valuable, come∣ly, and glorious, in the view of God, angels, and men.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Of the exercise of grace.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. OUR exercise of implanted grace, is called a DY∣ING <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 6. 7. and viii. 13.</NOTE>. Thereby our love to, and our acti∣vity in the service of sin, Satan, and the world, do, by virtue of Jesus' death applied to our heart, and through the painful exercise of repentance, gradually weaken, abate, and cease. May I die to sin daily. May I, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="351" REF="357"/>
2. It is represented as a LIVING <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE>. Proceeding from God the fountain of life, how pleasant, honour∣able, active, and useful it is; for advancing his glory, and our own and others eternal advantage! Christ, in his person and fulness, is the food which we receive by faith. God is our dwelling. He, his angels and saints, are our companions. Holy desire, prayer, and praise, are our spiritual breath. Obedience to Jesus' law, is our motion and work.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is represented as a CALLING; an OCCUPATION; VOCATION; or BUSINESS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John vi. 26. Phil. ii. 13.</NOTE>. To proceed therein, we must know the mysteries of the gospel, concerning Je∣sus, in his person, his offices, relations, benefits, and or∣dinances; and concerning ourselves, in our state, our qualities, and duties. We must have a stock of impu∣ted righteousness, implanted grace, and exceeding great and precious promises. We must understand the nature and worth of spiritual and heavenly things. We must daily attend to the exercise of holiness, as our great, our important work. We must carefully abide at home, keeping our heart, watching over, and ordering our conversation. Frequently, by self-examination, we must distinctly state our business, our accounts; and clear them by application of Jesus' blood. Our stock being his, his glory is to be intended in every thing we do. Always ought we to thrive in grace, and know that we do so. No labour or pains are to be spared, that we may perfect holiness in the fear of God. How signally do quick returns of prayer, and eminent communications of grace, increase our stock, and animate our diligence! And how rich shall this blessed occupation render us, in our last end! Godliness with contentment is great gain, <HI>having the promises of this life, and of that which is to come.</HI> Apply to it, my soul, in every branch thereof; so number thy days that thou mayest apply thy heart unto wisdom, and learn God's truth; plough up the fal∣low ground of thy heart, accepting his rod and word for thy conviction and contrition. Deny thyself; a∣wake, shake off thy drousiness and sloth; beware of prodigal wasting of JEHOVAH'S bounty; whatsoever things are needful, whatsoever things are lovely, and of

<P N="4">4. It is represented as a WALK or JOURNEY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 6. Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE>. With hope and earnest desire to obtain the better country, we therein choose Jesus and his law for our way, and with pleasure proceed from one degree of grace, or act of ho∣liness, to another, till at length we appear before God in the heavenly Zion. It is a <HI>walking in Christ,</HI> a prac∣tical abiding and increasing improvement of his person, righteousness, and fulness: it is a <HI>walking after the</HI> SPI∣RIT; directed and influenced by the Holy Ghost; it is a <HI>walking with God;</HI> beholding, loving, trusting in, receiving all from, and resting satisfied in him. It is a <HI>walking humbly and mournfully</HI> with him, in the faith of his presence with us, as our God, our Father, our Friend, and our Guide; daily loathing, and mourning over our corruptions and offences done to him. It is a <HI>walking before</HI> him; with reverence of, and as in his immediate prefence, and in hope of direction and reward from him. It is <HI>a walking in his name,</HI> as his servants, influenced by his power and promise, directed by his law, and intended to his honour. It is an <HI>upright walk,</HI> our purpose and practice uniformly concurring to advance the glory of God. It is <HI>a walking circumspectly, redeem∣ing the time;</HI> attending to every circumstance of our practice, that we may regulate it, by the DIVine law; that we may value time as a precious jewel, and under a deep sense of former sinfulness and sloth, exert our whole care and might to improve our present opportu∣nities, to the glory of God. It is a <HI>walking with the wise;</HI> making those who are taught of God our patterns and companions in every good word and work.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is called a RACE <HI>set before us</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 1. 2.</NOTE>. In the word of God, is the way, the troubles attending, the method of course, the pattern, and prize, <HI>set before us.</HI> The race plot, is this present world; the prize, the heavenly glory; the path, Jesus and his law. Being supported by and looking to him, as our forerunner and pattern, we must labour and suffer for him; and with agility,

readiness, cheerfulness, vigour, and patience, press for∣ward, from one degree of grace to another, till we be∣come perfect, as our Father which is in heaven is perfect.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is called a GOING UP <HI>through the wilderness leaning on the beloved</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 5.</NOTE>. Finding no rest, ease, or satisfaction, in this desart world, or in the barren be∣wildering state of sin, or condition of estrangement from God, we must turn away our desire, our delight, and expectation therefrom; and in a state of union to, exercise of intimacy with, and dependence on Jesus' person, righteousness, and strength, walk-in him, and his word, as our way; and with assiduous labour, vigour, and prudence, surmount every towering impediment of ignorance, unbelief, of temptation, persecution, deser∣tion, of terror and guilt; following on to know the Lord, till we are set down on his right hand.</P>

Therein is our whole man, soul, body, and spirit, with skill, courage, patience, and preseverance, to op∣pose, fight against, and by all possible means, seek the destruction of indwelling lust; to fight against Satan, resisting and labouring to overcome his temptations; to fight against the world, trampling on its alluring entice∣ments, despising its frowns, opposing its wicked errors, and abominable practices; and against multitudes of afflictions, patiently enduring them. It it a <HI>good fight.</HI> It is for the <HI>good</HI> cause of God and truth; under a <HI>good</HI> captain, Jesus Christ; it is to be performed in a <HI>good</HI> method, according to the law of God, with the good armour of God, and in the good and well-grounded hope of a good victory and spoil, an inestimable crown of glory, life, and righteousness. It is a <HI>fight of faith,</HI> fought to maintain the doctrine of <HI>faith once delivered to the saints;</HI> and by the grace of faith, is standing, and victory therein signally obtained.</P>

<P N="9">9. It is compared to the GROWTH of persons, herbs, and trees <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 15. Hos. xiv. 5. 7.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding our frequent sickness, and sad blasts of temptation, and frost-like prevalency of indwelling lusts, the daily application of Jesus, as our bread of life, and of the watering and warming in∣fluences of his Spirit and love, make holiness in heart and life pleasantly and insensibly to revive and increase, till we be ripe for everlasting glory, having attained the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</P>
<P N="10">10. True godliness is called the FEAR <HI>of the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxi. 10.</NOTE>. With a reverential fear of, and love to him, are all its exercises and blessings attended. And truly this is the <HI>beginning of wisdom;</HI> a beginning to choose the better part, never to be taken away.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is called WISDOM <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Prov. ii. 2.</NOTE>. Hereby we choose the best friend, companion, husband, and portion; dis∣cern the things that differ; follow after righteousness, peace, charity; and run in the way of God's command∣ments. And by improving Jesus Christ, as our righ∣teousness and strength, take a proper method to per∣form gospel holiness, and obtain the DIVine acceptance thereof.</P>
<P N="12">12. The path of the just is represented as SHINING LIGHT, <HI>shining more and more unto the perfect day</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prov. iv. 18.</NOTE>. From small beginnings, their knowledge, their holi∣ness and comfort gradually, mysteriously, and pleasant∣ly increase, till they be swallowed up in the noon-tide brightness of eternal glory. Nor can any cloud over∣take them, which shall not be quickly removed. Sure∣ly then their path is <HI>pleasant, plain,</HI> clearly laid down in God's word, and without these snares and stumbling blocks which lie in the way of the wicked. Surely this is a <HI>way above,</HI> wherein heavenly things are chiefly attended. A <HI>way of life,</HI> marking life spiritual, and preparing for life eternal.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="355" REF="361"/>
13. Holy exercises resemble LILIFS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song vii. 2.</NOTE>. Numbers of them spring from one root or principle of faith. How pure! comely! high! and heaven bending! the better they are, the more humility and self denial are mixed with them.</P>
<P N="14">14. Holy exercises, real religion, and true wisdom, are a TREE OF LIFE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 18. and iv. 13.</NOTE>. They shew a heart quicken∣ed by the Spirit of God; and do bring forth the good fruits of spiritual liveliness here, and of life eternal, hereafter.</P>
<P N="15">15. Holy exercises are called the GREEN FRUITS <HI>of the valley;</HI> and the BUDS or FRUITS of the saints, these trees of righteousness <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Song vi. 11.</NOTE>. In consequence of our im∣plantation into Christ, and union with him, they gra∣dually, one after another, appear in our life, and are but imperfect, while we continue on earth.</P>
<P N="16">16. Holiness of life is called a SOWING <HI>in righteous∣ness;</HI> a SOWING <HI>in tears,</HI> and to <HI>the Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prov. xi. 18.</NOTE>. In practising it, we, in the solid hope of eternal glory, carefully work righteousness;—amidst grief and sorrow, we follow the dictates and operation of the Holy Ghost; and act as influenced by, and to the advantage of our new nature. And O what mercy, joy, and immortal happiness, we shall reap in the final, the eternal har∣vest!</P>
<P N="17">17. The fear of the Lord is a FOUNTAIN <HI>of life</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 26.</NOTE>. How refreshing its influence! What endless glory! In what immortal life will it break forth at last! From thee, O <HI>fountain of living waters,</HI> is my life, my fruit found.</P>
<P N="18">18. Wisdom, or real religion, is represented as an ORNAMENT; and righteousness as BRIGHTNESS <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Is. lxii. 1.</NOTE>. How precious in itself! how dearly purchased with Jesus' blood! How notably it adorns our nature and life! maketh our face and conversation to shine! and will issue in the brightness of everlasting glory!</P>
<P N="19">19. Experimental knowledge of real religion is like HONEY and the HONEY COMB <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 13.—16.</NOTE>. How sweet and ra∣vishing!
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
Nor can any one know the excellency there∣of, without tasting it; strangers do not intermeddle with the saints joy.</P>
<P N="20">20. True religion is compared to SILVER, and an HID TREASURE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. ii. 4.</NOTE>. How comely, precious, and en∣riching! How unknown to most of mankind! With what diligence it is to be sought for! With what joy the finding of it fills our soul, and in what happi∣ness it ends.</P>
<P N="21">21. Prayer is represented as MEDITATION; SUPPLI∣CATION; INTERCESSION; CRYING <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. 4. 1. 1 Tim. ii. 1.</NOTE>; to denote the solid judgment, deep humility, familiarity, and ear∣nestness, therein to be exercised.</P>
<P N="22">22. It is represented as a <HI>pouring out of the heart; lift∣ing up of the soul to God; breathing and panting for him</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxii. 8. and xxv. 1. Lam. iii. 56.</NOTE>; to denote the inward fervency proper therein.</P>
<P N="23">23. It, with some other religious worship, is called a <HI>standing,</HI> a <HI>kneeling,</HI> a <HI>bowing,</HI> a <HI>falling down</HI> before the Lord <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal xcv. 6. and cxxxiv. 1.</NOTE>; in allusion to the gestures therein used; and to denote the reverence proper to attend it.</P>
<P N="24">24. Praising of God is represented by SHOUTING; and by SOUNDING or PLAYING <HI>on musical instru∣ments</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is. xii. 6. Psal. cl.</NOTE>; in allusion to the service of the Jewish tem∣ple; and to mark the solemn sweetness and joy of heart included in this exercise.</P>
<P N="25">25. Humiliation for sin is represented as a <HI>putting on</HI> SACKCLOTH; as an ABHORRING <HI>of one's</HI> SELF; a <HI>lying,</HI> or ROLLING <HI>one's self in the</HI> DUST; a <HI>putting our</HI> MOUTH <HI>in the</HI> DUST <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Joel. i. 13. Job xlii. 6. Lam. iii. 29.</NOTE>. To denote the shame, the sense of unworthiness, the fear and blushing before God, inclu∣ded therein.</P>
<P N="26">26. Beneficence to others is called a WATERING them; a SCATTERING; a CASTING BREAD <HI>upon the waters</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Prov. xi. 24. 25. Eccles. xi. 1.</NOTE>; to mark, how it refresheth and nourisheth the poor object; how liberally, and without prospect of requital, it is to be exercised.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Metaphors respecting sin, the opposite of grace, in its nature, its state, course, kinds, temptations.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. <HI>Metaphors respecting sin in general, or as inherent.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE indwelling sin of our nature is compared to a KING and MASTER <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 21.</NOTE>. With great force and authority, it ruleth in, and over the wicked. Their heart is its palace and throne; devils, wicked men, and worldly things, are its armies and guard; every method of opposition to God is its law. By an amazing, powerful, and constant urgency, it mightily compels its unregenerate subjects to do whatsoever it list∣eth, however vile or slavish; nor can any created pow∣er subdue and conquer it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is compared to a WARRIOUR <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 23.</NOTE>. Armed with the curse of the broken law, delivering us up to spiritual death, it, with the utmost subtlety, aversation, opposi∣tion, enmity, and violent rage, fights against God, his Son, his Spirit, his word, and grace; and, with restless violence and crafty stratagems, alway exerts its influ∣ence, to subdue our whole man into an entire slavery to itself.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is compared to a MAN <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 22.</NOTE>. It spreads through every part of our soul and body; fills our heart with all <HI>unrighteousness, unbelief, pride, debate, deceit, malignity,</HI> high, vain, and vile imaginations and affections. In our mind, it is ignorance, vanity, pride, error, and craf∣tiness; in our conscience, it is searedness, partiality, or rage; in our will, weakness, aversion, and enmity to every thing good; in our affections, it is earthliness, fil∣thiness, disorder. It fills our mouth with cursing and bitterness; renders our ears open to error and filthiness; our eyes apt to behold vanity, <HI>lifted up,</HI> and <HI>full of adul∣tery;</HI> our hands apt to perpetrate evil; and our <HI>feet swift to shed blood.</HI> It is an <HI>old man.</HI> It is in us from our conception; and is alway pre-existent to our grace.
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>
And however crafty, peevish, and proud it be; yet in the saints, it is in a weakened and languishing condition.</P>
<P N="4">4. Indwelling lusts may be called our MOTHER's CHILDREN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song i. 6.</NOTE>. By our mother we are conceived and born in them. They have no origin or allowance from God our heavenly Father. Alas! how they grow up with us from our birth! What a cursed intimacy is be∣tween them, and our soul! Alas! how they render us the <HI>keepers of the vineyards!</HI> how they entangle or force us into the most base and servile courses, to the neglect of our own heart, practice, office, or interest!</P>
<P N="5">5. It is represented as a WITNESS or WRITTEN TE∣STIMONY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiv. 7. and xvii. 1.</NOTE>. How deeply it is engraven on our heart! How irrefragably its reign there, and our habitual vo∣luntary commission of actual transgressions, testify be∣fore God, and our awakened conscience, that we are unregenerate enemies to our Maker! children of Satan! incapable to recover ourselves! unripe for heaven! rich deservants, and infeoffed heirs of endless misery!—and testify, that God is righteous in correcting and punish∣ing us!</P>
<P N="6">6. It is represented as an uncommon DECEIVER <HI>(d).</HI> It deceiveth and renders deceitful all mankind; renders our heart deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; renders it more deceiving to us, than Satan himself. It promiseth us pleasure and profit in offend∣ing God; and maketh us imagine that we enjoy them, while we are consumed by it; and that we procure wealth, while we lose our soul, and every thing good or useful, and pierce ourselves through with many sorrows. How often it persuades us that we obtain liberty, while we enslave ourselves into the cruellest bondage! that we are men of wisdom, while we wax blind and ignorant! that we make religion our great business, while we wal∣low in sin, heartily loathing, and detesting every thing good! that inward wickedness is of small account! that sin may be repented of, and turned from, at pleasure!—How often it hurrieth us, from one extreme to another! How strangely it adorns the vilest abominations with specious names, fair pretences, and honourable appear∣ances; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 13. Jer. xvii. 9.</NOTE>
<PB N="359" REF="365"/>
and makes them pass for duties and virtues! How often it employs us in attempting to deceive God, and compassing him about with lies, in our profession, our prayer, our praise, and other religious exercise! How effectually it renders us deceivers of ourselves; the wick∣ed to their everlasting ruin; and the saints, notwith∣standing their saving illumination, solemn resolution, and drawing love, to a woful perverting of their way, dishonouring their God, and wounding their soul!</P>
<P N="7">7. It is compared to a THIEF <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 30.</NOTE>. How it robbed all mankind in Adam of their honour and happiness! How craftily it steals away our time, our opportuities, our concern for eternal happiness! How insensibly, or violently, it robs us of our peace, honour, riches, and rest! Alas! how it carries us out of God's way! wounds our soul! binds us hand and foot! and renders us incapable to pursue after it, raise an outery against it or cry to God, for just vengeance on it! It is the com∣mon impoverisher and murderer of mankind, and the terror of every saint, who, being possessed of spiritual treasure, desires in all things to live honestly. How nu∣merous, the false names of virtue, which it assumes! and in the night of ignorance, of delusion, temptation, de∣sertion, how effectually it attempts, and succeeds in, its unhallowed and shameful work!</P>
<P N="8">8. It is compared to a WHORE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">James i. 13. 14.</NOTE>. Ah! how cun∣ningly it enticeth and leads us from God, to comply with our lusts! how it conceiveth and brings forth ac∣tual crimes! and so conceiveth and brings forth our en∣hanced ruin. Cursed be she, in her basket, and in her store, and in the fruit of her womb. Blessed be he, who taketh her little ones, her first motions, and dasheth them to pieces. May iniquity, in every form, stop her mouth; hide herself as ashamed: may her partisans stop their mouth; and with grief and blushing confess themselves guilty before God.</P>
<P N="9">9. Sin is compared to an EVIL-DOIR, <HI>nailed to, and crucified on a cross</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 6.</NOTE>. In the saints, not only God, but the man himself, condemn it; and take vengeance upon it for its murderous, its thievish crimes: and,
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
through the death of Jesus applied to their heart, it is, in a shameful, lingering, and painful manner, condemned and mortified: nor shall it ever save itself, and come down from this cross: It shall die, and not live, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.—Shameless robber, wicked murderer of my God, why have my heart-strings so long lapped thee round! why have I so long at∣tempted to hide, and protect thy guilty head!</P>
<P N="10">10. It is called a BODY OF DEATH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 24.</NOTE>. O the varie∣ty of lusts which are therein marvellously compacted; and mutually subordinated to the support and tendency of one another! Alas, what cursed members of atheism, pride, envy, malice, unbelief, ignorance, legality, covet∣ousness, lasciviousness, intemperance; are comprehended in it! Ah! what a noisome and infectious system of death is it, in itself! How it renders us spiritually dead! and exposeth us to temporal and eternal death! <HI>Wretch∣ed man, that I am, who shall deliver me from</HI> it!</P>
<P N="11">11. Indwelling lusts are FOXES <HI>that spoil the vines</HI> of Jesus' church and people <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song ii. 15.</NOTE>. How secretly they lodge! how are they connected with earthly things! how noted their craft and deceit! the crookedness of their paths! their desperate stubbornness under trouble and convic∣tion! their friendship with the old serpent, and his seed! Alas! how filthy, noisome, and abominable! how readily they pretend to be graces, virtues, or innocent things! how insatiably voracious! how unweariedly set upon mischief! how hurtful to saints, chiefly weak ones, and their tender graces; by attempting to unsettle, or root them out; or by depriving them of their sap! Alas! how they peel God's choice vine! strip his trees of righteousness! tread them down! gnaw off their blos∣soms of holiness! and mar them with earthly cares! what inexpressible care, and persevering labour, it takes to hunt out and destroy them!—Lord Jesus, take for me, <HI>these foxes, even the little foxes;</HI> hunt them out, with thy good Spirit: starve them in their dwellings: let me <HI>make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</HI> Catch them in the trap of thy promises; <HI>hide thy word in my heart, that I may not sin against thee.</HI>
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>
Deluge, my soul, their horrid den, with a plentiful ap∣plication of thy blood and grace: inflame my heart with thy love: on these <HI>foxes</HI> cast burning coals, and indignation strong: <HI>persecute and destroy them from un∣der these heavens; thy curse unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Sin is called WITCHCRAFT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 1.</NOTE>. In what fearful league with Satan, it enters and fixeth our soul, and en∣ticeth us to worship him! With what infernal influence and envy, it deceiveth, wastes, and ruins our whole man! When convinced of our wickedness, and danger, how unable and unwilling it rendereth us to escape! What diabolical opposition and objections it raiseth against the faith and honour of God's truth! And how effectually it excites and teacheth heretics to subvert our souls, and seduce us from the truth as in Jesus!</P>
<P N="13">13. It is called REBELLION <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xv. 23.</NOTE>. How opposite is it to the law and authority of God, our rightful Sovereign, and our solemn vows to be his! What fearful disorder it makes in the world! What a daring attempt to dethrone the Almighty! to put down his laws and dominion! to deprive him and his chosen friends of their life! and to set up its own, and the throne, laws, and government, of Satan!—Alas! <HI>vile rebellion, as the sin of witchcraft!</HI> But, O Jesus, who receivedst gifts for men, even for the rebellious, that God the Lord might dwell among them, why should my soul continue to rebel against thee, my Saviour! to commit high treason against my God! Why expose herself to endless wo? Shall neither mer∣cies melt, nor terrors awe? Why should I revolt from under thy yoke? O forgive me, for I know not what I do.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is called a WANDERING and STRAYING from God <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. lviii 3.</NOTE>. Thereby we lose our first estate; go out of our proper way; do, we know not what, or why; go, we know not whither; turn our back on the Most High; lose his favour, presence, and blessing. Alas! to what inexpressible danger we are exposed! How ready to hearken to false guides! How hard, nay impossible for us, to return to God, of our own accord!—Lord, bring
<PB N="362" REF="368"/>
me back from Bashan hill, and from the deeps of the sea!</P>
<P N="15">15. It is called WHOREDOM <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. iii. 1.</NOTE>. Thereby we break our covenant-marriage with God; admit Satan, the world, and our lusts, into his room; by whom we con∣ceive, and bring forth the infernal progeny of sinful de∣sires, and wicked courses. How base and shameful in its nature! Ah, how it takes away, hardens, and stupi∣sieth our heart, making us refuse to be ashamed, when we commit abomination! What wretched pleasure we take therein, while our strength is thereby insensibly wasted! and we exposed to poverty, infamy, and endless death!</P>
<P N="16">16. Indwelling sin is called LUSTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">James iv. 1.</NOTE>. What a va∣riety of sinful inclinations and dispositions, are therein comprehended! How restlessly and unweariedly it chooseth! how violently, unreasonably, and secretly, it pusheth us into the most sinful and shameful acts! In the saints, how it lusteth and warreth against the grace of God! In others, how often it renders them like <HI>fed horses, dogs,</HI> or <HI>swine,</HI> with the impetuous violence of fleshly lust!—When it speaketh fair, believe it not; there are seven abominations in it.</P>
<P N="17">17. It is called a LAW OF SIN <HI>in our members</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 23.</NOTE>. Ah, its power and authority over us! How it obligeth and forceth us to study conformity to its dictates; and to fulfil its lusts, employing the powers of our soul, to commit sinful acts!—O were I but fully dead to this law, that I, might live unto God! When I would do good, how sadly is evil present with me!</P>
<P N="18">18. Sin is called INIQUITY or UNRIGHTEOUS∣N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 19.</NOTE>. It is the very reverse of the righteous nature, and holy and just law of God. It is an universal rob∣bery and fraud; by it we rob God of his due honour, love, obedience, and regard; ourselves of our holiness and felicity, and of every proper means to regain it;—our neighbour, of all true love, esteem, and regard;—and the very creation of its proper ease, use, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onour.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="363" REF="369"/>
19. Sin is called WICKEDNESS and ENMITY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Zech. v. 8. Rom. viii. 7.</NOTE>. Ah! the inveterate, unreasonable, and fixed malice, against God, and the welfare of creation, which is contained in it. Nor can it be transformed into any other shape. Lord though enmity cannot be changed, yet slay it, and change my heart! Alas! is hatred my return for thy redeeming love!—Why, my soul, art thou proud! why art thou at ease! Enmity against God is all thou canst directly call thine own! Long, long my sin, thou hast dwelt too near my heart! Hence, to eternal dis∣tance, flee!</P>
<P N="20">20. It is called UNCLEANNESS; an ABOMINABLE THING; an ABOMINATION; an HORRIBLE THING <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Zech. xiii. 1. Jer. xliv. 1.</NOTE>. It is the very reverse of the beauty, comeliness, and purity of God; it is the murderer of Jesus Christ: it defiles every thing it toucheth; renders the plowing and prayer of the wicked an abomination: it spreads through our whole man; renders our person, heart, and prac∣tice, ugly and noisome to God, that, in our natural state, he cannot look towards us without the utmost ab∣horrence; nor can his angels or saints delight in, or be∣hold us with pleasure.—Direful monster, may I never look upon thee, without detestation and horror! Far may I flee from thy presence, and lothe myself for thy sake! O the omnipotent virtue of that blood which cleanseth from all sin! that can wash the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> into comeliness! the lothsome, the worse than <HI>wallowing sow,</HI> into purity!</P>
<P N="21">21. It is represented as a FOLLY and MADNESS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. xiix. 13. and lxx ii. 19. 20. 21.</NOTE>. How stupid and unteachable! How unreasonable, cruel and mischievous to ourselves and others, it renders us! By it we reject God the chief good; rage against the Almighty; presumptously rush on his neck, and upon the bosses of his buckler. How effectually it trans∣forms us into proud and <HI>prating fools!</HI> Ah, how de∣stitute of delight in wisdom! it is too high for, and ha∣ted by us. How we despise a God, <HI>a Father's instruc∣tion!</HI> How Christ crucified, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, and every spiritual thing, are <HI>fool∣ishness</HI> to us! neither we can by nature know them; for
<PB N="364" REF="370"/>
they are spiritually discerned! So fast is <HI>folly bound up in our heart,</HI> that even rods of manifold correction drive it not far away. Our <HI>heart is at our left hand</HI> set upon earthly and sinful objects; its proper resolu∣tions are saint, and ill put in practice. Its <HI>eyes,</HI> its thoughts, and desires, <HI>are in the ends of the earth,</HI> set upon vanity, or things we have no concern with. Though deceitful above all things, how fondly we <HI>trust it!</HI> Alas, how we <HI>hate reproof!</HI> how we <HI>rage and are confident,</HI> in proceeding from evil to worse! How right in our eyes is our evil way! What a <HI>sport</HI> to many, <HI>to do mischief!</HI> What <HI>anger</HI> against God, against a gra∣cious Saviour, and blessed Spirit, against our neighbour, <HI>resteth in our bosom!</HI> is, with pleasure and delight, lodged and entertained in our heart! What outrageous <HI>wrath</HI> and passion, <HI>heavier than the sand,</HI> is often rouzed in our breast! In the multitude of our words, how ma∣nifest our folly! In our mouth, how <HI>unseemly</HI> are <HI>pa∣rables</HI> and <HI>excellent speech!</HI> How unconcernedly uttered! and how inconsistent with our practice! In our mouth, what <HI>a rod</HI> of proud boasting, and arrogant calumny! How readily our <HI>lips enter into contention,</HI> meddling with strife, with vain jangling, and idle disputes not pertaining to us! Alas! how often our mouth <HI>seeds upon,</HI> takes pleasure in, and in the most plentiful man∣ner pours forth and proclaims <HI>foolishness,</HI> vain, empty trifles! How wickedly it <HI>uttereth slander; casteth abroad arrows and death</HI> in bitter words; and saith, <HI>Am I not in sport?</HI> Alas! how often the <HI>instruction</HI> given by our lips and our life <HI>is</HI> but absurd <HI>folly!</HI> How often is our <HI>mouth</HI> the means of <HI>destruction</HI> to ourselves and others, How often we <HI>answer a matter</HI> to God, or to men! <HI>before we hear,</HI> consider, or understand it!

How often we <HI>die for want of wisdom!</HI> and have <HI>shame</HI> given us for our <HI>promotion!</HI> How often our <HI>prosperity</HI> hardens, and tends to <HI>destroy</HI> us! How rarely do <HI>hundreds of stripes</HI> make any proper impression upon us! Nor, though <HI>brayed in a mortar</HI> of adversity, doth our <HI>foolish∣ness</HI>

While under the reigning power of it, the rain of di∣vine ordinances, and seed of inspiration, are lost upon, and harden us. Ministers, who are sent to hew us, with the hammer of God's word, and troubles, make no proper impression upon us, till Jesus break our heart with his power, and melt it in the fire of his Spirit and love.—Lord, am I such hell-hardened steel, that mercy will not melt me! No; overcome by bleeding love, I dissolve, I melt beneath the crofs.</P>
<P N="24">24. It is called FLESH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE>. It is of a bafe, vile, worthless, and putrifying nature. It is conveyd to us with our body; and is much influenced, modified, and exerted thereby. It renders us carnal and fleshly; make us <HI>to mind,</HI> love, think of, and chiefly care for, <HI>the things of the flesh;</HI> to dwell <HI>in the flesh,</HI> under its absolute power and authority; to <HI>walk after</HI> it, accord∣ing to its dictates and inclinations; and to <HI>war after</HI> it, from sinful ends and motives, and in a carnal, mali∣cious, and passionate manner.</P>
<P N="25">25 Sin is called a STRONG HOLD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 4. 5.</NOTE>. How advan∣tageous is its situation, and deep its foundation in our heart! How dreadful its impenetrableness! unclean∣ness! extent! steepness! and height! How numerous the deep pits of its entangling snares! How abundant its provision for a sinful life; and its fulness of infernal armour! How many and secret its means of communi∣cation with Satan and the world! He is the governor; our predominant lust is the citadel; our actual trans∣gression the outworks. Lord Jesus, demolish it; raze, raze it, to the foundation; heap up mounts of redeem∣ing grace, and take it.</P>

Thereby he fights against the DIVine Sa∣viour, when he is coming to rescue and deliver us. Ig∣norance and slupidity are his helmet; unbelief and lega∣lity his shield; pride, unconcern, obstinacy, and despair, his breastplate; enmity and error his sword.—Lord, spell him of this armour, wherein he trusteth.</P>

The latter, our ploughing and prayer not excepted, it ren∣ders abomination to the Lord. Nor, like old leaven, is sin good for any thing, but to defile.</P>
<P N="28">28. It is compared to POISON <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal cxl. 3.</NOTE>. It inflames our heart with enmity, malice, and rage, against God and men. Quickly it infects and corrupts our whole man. It begets an infatiable thirst after sinful and earnal plea∣sure and profit. Like the poison of asps, how effectual∣ly it lulls us asleep! And, however pleasant and taking it be at first, it becomes painful and mortal at last. Be∣ing of itself contrary to their new nature, it is painful to the saints. Being agreeable to the nature of the wicked, these venomous beasts, it breeds them no pain, but in its consequences; nor can it be expelled, but by the convincing, illuminating, and sanctifying oil, or in∣fluence of the Holy Ghost.</P>

From the old serpent, the devil, it proceeds; and renders afflictions, death, and every thing in the system of nature, hurtful and deadly to us. How infectious its poison, spread∣ing into, and corrupting all our powers, and poisoning every act and enjoyment in our natural state! At first, its wounds feel pleasant; but, in the end, how pain∣ful and tormenting! Nor, without faith in the slain Re∣deemer, exalted on the pole of the gospel, can they be healed, or the corruption rooted out.—Thrice blessed HE, who sucked the venom of my wounds into himself, bearing mine iniquities, that I might obtain health and cure; might have death, trouble, and every thing

And ah, how inveterate! how envenomed! how deep, spreading, and extensive! How filthy, noisome, and infectious! How painful, shameful, and deadly a wound! Alas, how it weakens our soul! mars and withers our beauty! how it hinders our proper exercise, and pollutes all that we do!—Lord, heal my lothsome disease, my painful wounds, that stink, and are corrupt: my folly makes it so.</P>
<P N="32">32. It is a PLAGUE and LOTHSOME DISEASE, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Kings viii. 38. Psal. xxxviii. 2.</NOTE>. It is the corrupt humour of our soul; and a heavy judgment on mankind. How mysterious in its nature and source! How quickly it overspreads our whole na∣ture and life! How shameful, nauseous, and of itself desperate, the disease! How abominable it renders us to God and good men! and mars our fellowship with them! Alas! by its influence, how is our soul pined away, and weakened! Our heart swells with pride and self conceit. Our voice, our converse, our prayer, our praise is disagreeable. Our breath stinks with idle and corrupt communication. Our bowels burn with desire after sinful pleasures, and carnal enjoyments. Our inner man is dead while we live; and daily casts forth the putrid stuff of abominable actions!</P>

Sprung from the eating of forbidden fruit, how it affects our heart; and thence spreads into our whole man, and every con∣cern! How it extends to our whole race, and sickens the lower part of the creation for our sake! How gra∣dually it weakens our soul! hastens our eternal death! restrains and unfits us for our work! How dangerous, if it be long continued in! When felt, how grievous to be borne! But ah! what multitudes lying under it, are in a perpetual rave, or moonstruck madness, till ever∣lasting burnings bring them to their senses!—My soul, when I see my sickness, and my wound, let me call Je∣sus

<P N="34">34. It is represented as a DEATH <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 1.</NOTE>. Hereby our happy relations to God and his creatures are broken and dissolved. Hereby we are rendered incapable to desire, think, or act, to any good purpose. Hereby we lose our beauty and freshness. Our whole man is turned into a repose and repast of infernal vermin, of fiends and cor∣ruptions. We forget God, and our everlasting concerns; are altogether lothsome and abominable; and bring forth fruit to eternal death.—Alas! how this death worketh in me! Not often, but alway I am in it; not a step betwixt my soul and it! Who shall deliver me from so great a death! Who but thee, O Jesus, who quickenest the dead, and eallest things that are not, as though they were!</P>
<P N="35">35. It is compared to a FIRE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. ix. 18.</NOTE>. How fearfully it inflames our heart with lust, with enmity, and rage a∣gainst God! How furiously and effectually it consumeth our soul! How impossible for any creature to withstand or quench it! How terrible to such as are graciously a∣wakened! But what millions are devoured by it in their sleep! How often on earth it burns up thorns and briers of wicked men! and consumes forests, whole nations and armies, with flaming destruction! How it burns the reprobate world into endless fire! Lord Jesus, quench it in me, in thousands, with thy blood.</P>
<P N="36">36. It is compared to a CLOUD and THICK CLOUD <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. xliv. 22,</NOTE>. Ah, how innumerable, as the particles of a cloud, are its lusts and acts!

How fearfully it threatens us with thunderbolts, and sweeping deluges of DIVine wrath! Ye saints, how it damps your spirits! forebodes storms of chastisement! While under the cloud, how often your hearts quake with the voice of thunder! What darkness and shadow of death are over your soul! By thy forgiving grace, by thy shining rays, by the

How fearful and inconceivable its weight! If it fall on us, by conviction or punishment, how it crusheth and sinks our soul toward the lowest hell! How fearfully it interposeth between God and us! What noxious spirits and curses do, as it were, reside therein! Almighty Sa∣viour, who wast once willingly crushed under its weight, in mercy come leaping over it to my soul; melt it down with thy love; touch and waste it away by thy grace; remove, overturn it; cast it into the deeps of forget∣fulness, the deeps of thy precious blood. O to see thy bleeding love prevail, till the highest mountains of my guilt and corruption be covered! O for a firm faith, effectually to bid this mountain remove, and be cast in∣to the <HI>deeps of the sea!</HI></P>
<P N="38">38. It is compared to a VINE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ezek. vii. 10. and xviii. 2. Jer. xxxi. 30.</NOTE>. Alas how it flourisheth and spreads its branches! what clusters of a∣bomination and misery it produceth! how sour, hurt∣ful to all, disagreeable to every sensible soul, are its grapes! its actual transgressions! In the issue, how fearfully they set the teeth on edge! fill us with anxiety and pain! How often <HI>wickedness</HI> grows up <HI>as a tree,</HI> is had in reputation! and <HI>pride buds!</HI> But the <HI>blossom shall go up as dust;</HI> the fruit is unto shame and death; the tree, with its fruits, hastens us to eternal ruin.—Ah! how its roots are fastened in me, <HI>as with a band of iron and brass!</HI> Lord Jesus, lay the axe of thy word and rod thereto! Blessed earthquake, blessed storm of death, make haste, dissolve my frame, tear up my sin by the root, let my <HI>wickedness be broken, and cut off as a tree.</HI></P>
<P N="39">39. It is compared an EVIL TREASURE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 35.</NOTE>. Its great residence is the hidden cabinet of our heart. How carefully we keep and conceal it as a sweet morsel un∣der our tongue! Ah! how we daily live upon it! How many are proud of, and reckon themselves en∣riched

by it! How inexhaustible its fulness! with what mad haste do many laboriously increase it, adding sin to sin, till the measure of their iniquity be full! and treasuring up for themselves, wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God!</P>
<P N="40">40. It is represented as a DEBT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth vi. 12.</NOTE>. It includes our neglect of that obedience we owe to God's law; it in∣volveth us in the obligation of infinite satisfaction to his justice. The longer we continue therein, the debt the more. increaseth. And ah! how fearfully it occasions our hatred of God, our creditor! our aversion to self-examination! our abhorrence, and sometimes terror, of death and judgment, our times of account! How it exposeth us to the arrest of conscience, the prison of hell, and the endless fury of an angry God! O awful, unbounded debt, which God alone can pay! nor he, but at the expence of his wealth, his blood, his life? O his grace in forgiving me, his enemy, my ten thou∣sand talents! Let not me continue in sin, because grace doth abound.</P>
<P N="41">41. Sin is called a REPROACH <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 34.</NOTE>. How clearly it manifests our base birth, that we are of our father the devil! and our base heart, that it is <HI>little worth,</HI> and <HI>set upon mischief!</HI> It exhibits us as treacherous, liars, haters of God, murderers of ourselves, <HI>filled with all unrighteousness,</HI> abominable, and unclean.

How often our sinful methods of relief and happiness involve us in further trouble! How often are our sins plainly marked on our judgments! or we are given up to our lusts, to punish us for our former wickedness!</P>
<P N="43">43. It is represented as a WEIGHT and BURDEN; and perhaps as a TALENT <HI>of lead in an ephah</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxviii. 4. Zech. v. 7.</NOTE>. How

What multitudes it sinks to the deeps of DIVine judgments, and of the lowest hell! How it crusheth the hearts of persons convinced! bruifeth and breaks their bones, and makes them wea∣ry of their life! What an oppressive load to the saints! None but thee, O Jesus, could sustain its weight; nor thou, without sweating, groaning, and dying, under its guilt; nor can any other remove it from my soul!</P>
<P N="44">44. It is compared to a BOND; BAND; CHAIN; YOKE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. lviii. 6.</NOTE>. Ah! what crimes it supposeth or includes! what slavery it imports! what punishment it forebodes! How effectually it confines our soul, and restrains her from acting or moving in the way of holiness! How it binds men to Satan's door-posts! fixeth them in his pri∣son; causeth them to draw in his plough; and dig up mischief! Ah! how many reckon these chains of dark∣ness, ignorance, and misery, their honour; a chain and ornament of grace to their neck!</P>
<P N="45">45. It is compared to GARMENTS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 9.</NOTE>. How fully the habits and acts of sin encompass our whole nature and life! How often they plainly mark what, and whose we are! How they contribute to warm our inward lust! How fearfully they are lined with the DIVine curse! How sadly they protect our heart from God's arrows of conviction; and prevent our penitential shame! Though our best deeds be but filthy rags, how often we take pleasure in, and glory of them!—Lord Jesus, remove these <HI>filthy garments,</HI> and give me <HI>change of raiment.</HI></P>
<P N="46">46. It is compared to a SPOT in garments, or the like <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 5.</NOTE>. It is altogether vile and unsightly. It mars all the beauty of our heart, and spoils the robes of our conversation. It defiles our best duties: nor can it be washed out, but by Jesus' blood and Spirit.—By his mercy and truth applied to my soul, and his causing me to imitate him therein, may my spots be washed out: and by fearing him, may I depart from evil.</P>

How often doth our sun go down at noon! our comforts forsake us, when we least expected it! In trouble, how heartless; cold; painful; and dangerous to live! What delusive meteors of vain fancies, and flattering temptations, blaze abroad! What wild beasts of hurtful inclinations range around, seeking whom they may devour! How slowly time seems to move! How drowsy and stupid our souls of∣ten become! And how often is the darkness and dan∣ger greatest, before the day-spring of deliverance ap∣pear!</P>
<P N="16">16. It is compared to DARKNESS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lam. iii. 2.</NOTE>.

How unpleasant and unactive it renders our life! What wandering and stumbling it occasions! How different its degrees, though it can still become worse! How grievous, especially to those who have tasted the pleasures of an opposite lightsome prosperity! How often it is such a mixture of mercy and judgment, that it is hard to say which prevails in it! Yet, let me reverence it; it is the doing of the Lord, let it be won∣drous and acceptable in mine eyes; It is his <HI>pavilion</HI> and <HI>secret place;</HI> let me therein behave as in his imme∣diate presence; let me <HI>feel after him;</HI> though clouds and darkness be round about him, judgment, mercy, and truth, go before his face.</P>

How painful to endure! how often they kill such as are not rooted and grounded in Christ! how they nip the weeds of corruption in the saints; and cut off the vermine of earnal professors from among them! How effectually they render difficult our way to the heavenly kingdom; and, proportional to their severity, sweeten the spring-tide of glory, when it cometh! A∣dored Jesus, how tremendous was thy winter of suffer∣ing! thy soul was troubled, amazed, and very heavy, sorrowful even unto death. O shocking winter that be∣stormed, that pained, that froze to death, him who is the Almighty God! But rejoice, my soul, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; Jesus hath suffered, and entered into his glory. The winter of my unrege∣neracy is past; quickly shall all my winters of raging corruption and trouble be finished, and one eternal spring ensue.</P>

Out of God's treasures of indignation, they are brought forth; and by his power and wisdom, they are governed; devils

How often, my soul, are the deeps like to swallow me up! how often am I deprived of the smiles of Jesus' love! perplexed with ingratitude to him! afraid of his just wrath! oppressed with his judg∣ments! harassed in conscience with fears of utter rejec∣tion? with temptations of Satan, and prevalency of in∣ward corruption!—But rejoice, Jesus was nights and days in the deep, that he might pave my <HI>deeps</HI> with his everlasting love. His way is in the sea, and his path in the mighty waters; and from all my great deeps shall he draw me out. Though now <HI>deep call unto deep;</HI> all his waves and billows go over me; yet his loving-kindness will the Lord command in the day-time.

23. Trouble is compared to a WILDERNESS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hos. ii. 14.</NOTE>. How difficult to live in it! how exposed to enemies, snares, and temptations! how hard to discern our state and condition; or find a way of escape! how many are our wants! how rough our way!—While I am here, may JEHOVAH feed me with his hidden manna; lead, humble, and prove me; and do me good in my latter end.</P>
<P N="24">24. It is called a VALLEY; a BOTTOM; a VALLEY <HI>of the shadow of death</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Zech. i. 8. Psal. xxiii. 4.</NOTE>. Therein, how debased is our condition! how ready are we to be trodden upon! What preludes of death! What terrors often surround us therein!—Yet in this low valley hath not my soul or∣dinarily most moisture? and is she not most fruit∣ful? Let me then never fear trouble or death, while I have a Christ with me.</P>
<P N="25">25. It is compared to PITS; NETS; SNARES; STUM∣BLING-BLOCKS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. vii. 15. and x. 9.</NOTE>. How wickedly do Satan and his agents often prepare them for us; and draw us into them! How unprepared and suddenly, do we often fall into them! How often are we so entangled, that endeavours to extricate ourselves do but inveigle us more and more! How often we rage as wild bulls in a net! How often we are overthrown, hurt, and bruised by them! How sadly they stop our way, and render us unsightly!</P>
<P N="26">26. Is is compared to a PRISON; STOCKS; or CHAIN <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxlii. 6.</NOTE>. It restrains our liberty; marks our guilt; promotes our shame, fear, pain, disquiet, and often connection with bad companions. It is thine, O supreme Judge, to cast us into, and deliver us from it. Our attempts to escape at our own hands, do but add to our misery.—My soul, quietly bear thy shame; accept the punishment of thine iniquity; be <HI>still,</HI> amidst thy trouble, till God himself bring thee out.</P>
<P N="27">27. It is compared to a BED <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 22.</NOTE>. Our spirit it con∣fines; our activity it restrains. Under it, how sick, uneasy, unsightly, lean, destitute of courage or comfort are we!</P>
<P N="28">28. It is compared to a FIRE; a FURNACE; FLAMES; an OVEN <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Zech. xiii. 9.</NOTE>. How often it breaks forth suddenly!
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
how quickly it spreads! how terrible its alarms! how hard to stop, and painful to endure it! As good sub∣stance, the saints are only melted and purified; as stub∣ble, the wicked are destroyed, and hastened to eternal fire. It makes mens <HI>faces like flames;</HI> fills them with reddening terror and rage. It makes them <HI>blacker than a coal;</HI> deprives them of their joy, their glory, and ho∣nour. It renders them <HI>like bottles in the smoke,</HI> quite unsightly, and almost useless.—When I pass through the fire, be thou, Jesus, with me; so shall I not be burnt, nor the flame kindle upon me.</P>
<P N="29">29. It is compared to ARROWS; to a SWORD; and other weapons of war <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job. vi. 4.</NOTE>. Afflictions are launched from the bow of God's providence, and managed and directed by his hand. How numerous and well-aimed! How often do they secretly and unexpectedly strike, wound, pierce, and pain our body or soul!—How often, O Lord, have thine arrows stuck fast in me, and thine afflicting hand pressed me sore! how often have the poi∣son thereof, the torment and fear arising therefrom, ex∣hausted the joy, courage, and ease of my spirit!</P>
<P N="30">30. It is compared to a ROD or SCOURGE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Job. ix. 34.</NOTE>. What a painful and grievous consequence of sin! It is sent to cause us consider our evil ways, and turn to the Lord: Kindly we ought to receive it, and carefully to improve it. How often it proves beneficial to promote our con∣viction, and conversion to God! Such as being often corrected, harden their neck, shall be suddenly destroy∣ed, and that without remedy.—Correct me, O Lord, but in measure; and let thy rod drive all my sin, my foolishness, from my heart.</P>
<P N="31">31. It is compared to a WOUND; DISEASE; LEAN∣NESS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. i. 6. and xxiv. 16.</NOTE>. How sharply it pains us? how sadly it con∣fines, and abridgeth our liberty! spoils us of our glory and fulness; and renders us weak and unsightly! Alas! by neglect to receive and digest my spiritual provision; by sinful anxiety; by immoderate care about earthly things; by taking satisfaction in carnal and sinful plea∣fures; by manifold diseases of sin and sorrow, what a
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>
lean, a deformed skeleton am I! <HI>My leanness, my lean∣ness! wo unto me.</HI></P>
<P N="32">32. It is represented as a thing CROOKED <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eccl. vii. 13.</NOTE>. In the inward or outward case of our person; in the case of our family, our friends or enjoyments, how uneven, dis∣similar, disagreeable, and uncomely, it renders our lot! O the unnumbered crooks of mine! By thy favour, blessed Jesus, thou liftest me up; and by thy rebukes thou castest me down: but eternity shall make even all.—Let not then my soul endanger herself, essaying to <HI>make straight, what be hath made crooked.</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. It is called a CROSS <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth xvi. 24.</NOTE>. Like the ancient cross∣es, to which malefactors were fixed, it stretcheth, pains, and exposeth us as shameful malefactors in God's sight. It crosseth our hopes, desires, designs, and attempts: we look for good; but evil comes: we seek light; and be∣hold it is darkness.—May all my trouble be the <HI>cross of Christ</HI></P>
<P N="34">34. It is compared to a BURDEN and WEIGHT <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. xxx. 27.</NOTE>. It oppresseth and sinks our spirits; it lowers our circum∣stances. It renders us uneasy in life, and unsit for ex∣tensive action. If burdens be imposed, if plowers plow upon my back, it is the grief, the load which the Lord hath appointed me: let me therefore patiently bear it; be dumb because he doth it. Jesus bare my griefs, and carried my sorrows: he hath borne and carried; and even to old age he will bear, and he will carry, and he will deliver me. Be thou, my soul, a follower of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</P>
<P N="35">35. It is called a YOKE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is. x. 27.</NOTE>. How closely it cleaveth to us, and joins us together! firmly we are fixed there∣in; sadly is our spirit often galled thereby. Neverthe∣less it obligeth us to follow the course appointed for us, in the providence of God. It is a <HI>yoke of transgression</HI> wreathed about our neck, by our iniquities; for though hand join in hand, the sinner shall not go unpunished.</P>
<P N="36">36. It is called a HOOK; and BRIDLE <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is. xxxvii. 29.</NOTE>. By ap∣plying it to men, and painfully tormenting them there∣with, God, at his pleasure, restrains them from their in∣tended purposes; drags them through the world, and
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
the DIVersified circumstances thereof; and at last draws them into the eternal state.</P>
<P N="37">37. It is compared to a FAN; and SIEVE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xv. 7. Is. xxx. 28.</NOTE>. There∣by God tries and discovers what we are; tosseth us up and down; separates sinners from the saints in the church; for <HI>what is the chaff to the wheat?</HI> Hereby ho fans and sifts our hopes; for what is the chaff of vain imaginations to the comfortable oracles of Christ! Hereby he scatters families and nations before him, lighter than the small dust of the balance. It is a <HI>sieve of vanity,</HI> as God therein shews mens emptiness; sets them one against another; and spreads destruction a∣mong the nations.—Lord, sift thy chosen as thou wilt, none shall be lost.</P>
<P N="38">38. It is compared to GALL; and WORMWOOD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. iv. 15.</NOTE>. How bitter and disagreeable to nature! But, being mixed with mercy, how profitable it is to the saints! It kills our inward vermine of corrupt inclinations; it brings down our pride; purgeth off our filth; cures our spiritual barrenness and deadness; and enlargeth our appetite and desire after Christ.—O the height, the depth, of the wisdom and knowledge of God, who by <HI>gall and wormwood</HI> ushers in sweet Jesus, and his glory, to my heart!</P>
<P N="39">39. It is compared to a CUP, full of liquor <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxv. 15.</NOTE>. God exactly measureth it out to men; and every one must take his share. How often it maketh us stagger as drunken men, not knowing what to do; nor whither to go? How often it renders us stupid and enraged! How often it causeth us vomit up our shame, confessing our wickedness, parting with that which we had sinfully gained; or pouring forth our blasphemous rage against the DIVine Manager of all plagues! How often it is a <HI>cup of fury,</HI> proceeding from the revenging wrath of God! making men <HI>drunk with their own blood;</HI> stupified with their miseries! How often it is <HI>a cup of trembling and astonishment,</HI> making us quake and faint at the thought of receiving, or of continuing to drink it!—Adored Redeemer, what a cup was thine! a <HI>cup of trembling,</HI> filled with <HI>wine of astonishment!</HI> a <HI>cup full</HI>
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>
<HI>of the fury of the Lord,</HI> full of thine own blood! a cup deep as hell, and broader than the sea! O how my heart is wonder-struck! How melted to hear thee cry of it, <HI>The cup that my Father giveth me, shall I not drink it?</HI> to see the wring out the bitter dregs thereof, and drink them out for whom! for ME.</P>
<P N="40">40. The afflictions of Christ and his people are called their BAPTISM <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xx. 22. 23.</NOTE>. Through these they are dedicated to God; put off their connections with sin, and the mortality that attends it. How, Jesus, wast thou strait∣ened, till thy baptism was accomplished! How thy bowels heaved within thee, to find a vent in love, in sighs in groans, in blood, in death, for men! for ME!—Heave all my powers; burst thou mortal frame with love; with longing for my Christ.</P>
<P N="41">41. The overthrow of nations or churches is repre∣sented as a <HI>rolling together the heavens; a turning the sun into blackness; and the moon into blood, and causing the stars to fall</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiv. 29. Rev. vi. 12. 13. Is. xiii. 10.</NOTE>; to mark the shocking and fear∣ful manner in which their frame is dissolved and broken to pieces; their luminaries perish; their idolatrous ob∣jects of worship are disgraced; their magistrates and ministers ejected, and barbarously murdered; their or∣dinances, laws, and statutes, are abolished.—These, my Lord, shall perish; but thou shalt endure: they shall be changed! but thou art the same, and thy years have no end.</P>
<P N="42">42. The overthrow of nations and churches is com∣pared to an EARTHQUAKE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 13.</NOTE>. How terrible and de∣structive! How it makes mens hearts to fail and quake for fear! How dreadfully it rends asunder the whole frame of government! How furiously and suddenly are magistrates, ministers, and great men, these exalted and overtopping mountains, private persons, these plain fields and useful rivers, thrown out of their re∣spective stations and enjoyments!</P>
<P N="43">43. The overthrow of a nation or church is likened to an HARVEST and VINTAGE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Joel iii. 13. Rev. xiv. 15. 20.</NOTE>. Men being ripe in, and having filled up the whole measure of iniquity, which DIVine patience intended to bear with, God cuts
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>
them off from their standing. The wicked he casts in bundles, or multitudes, into hell-sire: the saints he either preserves in life, or by death carries them home to himself. Ah! what pricking thorns, and blasting whirl∣wind, do many then reap, as the punishment of their crimes!</P>
<P N="44">44. Civil punishment is called a WHEEL brought o∣ver the wicked <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xx. 26.</NOTE>; Alluding perhaps to some an∣cient method of torture; and in order to represent its easy execution, and bruising influence.</P>
<P N="45">45. Church-censure is called a ROD <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 21.</NOTE>. It is in∣tended to correct men for their sin, and to reclaim them from it to Christ; and it is to be applied with tender affection, meekness, equity, and prudence.</P>
<P N="46">46. Lets and impediments in the way of performing an enterprize, are called <HI>mountains; gates of iron and brass; the sea; the river Euphrates; and streams of Egypt</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Is. xl. 4. and xlv. 2. and xi. 15. Rev. xvi. 12.</NOTE>. Because they signally stop and hinder the execution of designs. But lie what will in the way of performing the promise, thy power, O Jesus, shall remove it, in the time thereof: mountains shall leap aside; seas and rivers shall dry up, at the rebuke of thy countenance.</P>

<P N="1">1. HUMAN life is compared to a POST <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Job. ix. 25.</NOTE>. Night and day, it swiftly passeth forward; nor can any thing stop its progress one moment. Ye sons of men, improve every moment thereof. Rise early in the morning of it, to follow hard after God. Rest on no present enjoyment. If you come not up to Jesus, in due time, your eternal life must go for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is compared to the FLIGHT <HI>of an eagle hasting to her prey</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Job. ix. 26.</NOTE>. With the utmost swiftness it passeth away, scarce leaving the marks where it hath been.

At JEHOVAH's pleasure, how quickly are we cut down by untimely death! or withered by old age!—But shall not my life, hereafter, <HI>revive as the corn, and grow as the lily?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is compared to a WAY and JOURNEY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 25.</NOTE>. How much trodden! how constantly pursued! how quickly ended! My soul, while thou art in this way, agree with God. Let my whole way point towards eternal bliss.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is compared to a FEAST <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. v. 8.</NOTE>. In it God giveth some a cup of consolation and prosperity; to others he giveth bread of affliction, a cup of adversity and wo. Whichsoever my Father giveth me, let me cheerfully drink it. If I am in Christ, my life is a continual feast.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is compared to a <HI>valuable</HI> MERCHANDISE <HI>to be redeemed</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 16.</NOTE>. Eternal and unbounded felicity or mi∣sery depends on every moment of it. By the enjoy∣ment of God, every moment may be rendered more valuable than the whole earth. Sensible of its impor∣tance, deeply concerned that we have lavished so much of it on Satan, the world, and our lusts, we are to be doubly careful in improving the rest.—My soul, how hath time lien heavy on thine hand! How often hast thou been straitened how to dispose of it! How often by unnecessary sleep, by idle converse, by vain and wicked devices, hast thou murdered its most sacred moments! are its few years too long to love Christ! too long, to prepare for eternity! too long, to secure the salvation of an immortal soul! Hearest thou, my soul, what murdered moments witness against thee? Must my life go, for theirs! O dear-bought sleep, if it cost me a restless eternity in hell! O costly hour for drinking a bottle, if rapid with an eternal drinking of of unmixed wrath! O ill purchased hours for a ball,
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
horse race, or stage-play, if they cost me everlasting fellowship in fire with the devil and his angels! O dear bought opportunity of an idle visit, or onedifying chat, if it cost me endless weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth! Will the momentary enjoyment of a sensual plea∣sure, common to me with the beasts, countervail the damage of unceasing torment? Should I, by giving my heart, my care, my time, to the world, gain the whole of it, what will it advantage me, if I lose my soul?</P>
<P N="7">7. It is compared to SWIFT SHIPS <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job. ix. 26.</NOTE>. How quickly it passeth away, and carrieth us into the ocean of eternity! And how many in it imagine every thing moving but themselves! How often bestormed, and brought to the brink of ruin!</P>
<P N="8">8. It is compared to a SHPEHERD'S TENT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">If. xxxviii. 12.</NOTE>. E∣ternity apart, how mean it appears! how easily our lot therein is changed! How easily is life itself dissol∣ved and finished!</P>
<P N="9">9. It is compared to a WEEK or DAY <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job. vii. 10</NOTE>. Therein we are to be laboriously occupied, securing our present and future felicity. Its duration is fixed; and, at the end thereof, we shall enter on the restful sabbath of e∣verlasting happiness, or fearful night of unceasing mi∣sery. My soul, do I pass my days in the wrath of God? or in his fear?</P>
<P N="10">10. It is compared to YESTERDAY, and a WATCH <HI>of the night</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc. 4.</NOTE>. Quickly, and often amidst darkness, perplexity, and trouble, it passeth away, and cannot be recalled.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is compared to a SPAN and HANDBREADTH <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix. 5.</NOTE>. How short its measure! how precisely fixed by God is its duration! and ought not its brevity and uncertainty to be ever before us!</P>
<P N="12">12. It is compared to a TALE <HI>that is told</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc. 9.</NOTE>. How little useful impression it maketh upon our minds! To how little purpose hath the past been spent! How little abiding sense we have of what we do in it!</P>

and empty! How sadly past, before we are rightly sen∣sible of enjoying it! To how little purpose are we ei∣ther pained or pleased in it! What multitudes therein never think a serious thought, nor bestir themselves to one good work!</P>
<P N="14">14. It is compared to a DREAM <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job. xx. 8.</NOTE>. How filled up with idleness and vanity! How many in it are employed in they know not what, nor for what end! How are their minds stuffed with empty imaginations, that they are, or shall be happy! that they are Christians indeed, and are employed in good works! yet how all turns out <HI>vanity and vexation of spirit!</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. It is compared to the WIND <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Job. vii. 7.</NOTE>. How unsub∣stantial! how swiftly, insensibly, and irresistibly, it passeth away, and returns no more!</P>
<P N="16">16. It is compared to a weaver's SHUTTLE <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job. vii. 6.</NOTE>. With what rapidity do its moments run along! and at last, as a web, we are cut out of the world, by death!</P>
<P N="17">17. It is compared to a CLOUD <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 9.</NOTE>. Notwithstand∣ing its promising appearances, how quickly is it spent! and to how small account! How much driven away by the blast of DIVine wrath! It never returns; and with what terror, may many look thereat!</P>
<P N="18">18. It is compared to a VAPOUR <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">James iv. 14.</NOTE>. It, as it were, riseth out of the earth. How extremely weak, frail, and fleeting! How tossed to and fro with the least breath of DIVine providence! How quickly it ex∣pireth almost as soon as it exists!</P>
<P N="19">19. It is compared to a SHADOW <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eccles. viii. 13.</NOTE>. O its emp∣tiness and uncertainty! how quickly it goeth away, and never returns! I hear of <HI>a time to be born, and a time to die;</HI> but of none to live. Why, Lord, should I then boast of it?</P>

OPPORTUNITY, or the season of God's doing much for a person or people, and gi∣ving them eminent access to receive his benefits, is call∣ed an HOUR <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John. v. 25.</NOTE>. Its period and duration are precisely fixed by God. O how short, when compared with e∣ternity! And, at our infinite hazard, do we lose a mo∣ment thereof, in vanity or wickedness.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is called a DAY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 7.</NOTE>. How fixed and short! Only during the continuance thereof, the sun of pros∣perity, or of sacred inspiration, shines upon us. Its morning is, when the mercy signally commenceth: Its noon is, when at its greatest brightness: Its evening is, when it is at its finishing point; Ah, how is the day of gospel-opportunity detested by multitudes, who hate its light because their deeds are evil! How often is it bestormed with trouble and persecution! and becloud∣ed with the rise of error and delusion! When it draws to a period, how the warming influence of the Sun of righteousness, and his word, abates! what shadows of error, ignorance, and empty forms of religion increase! what faithful, laborious, and shining ministers, are cut off, and succeeded by naughty ones! What dewy drops of DIVine judgment, spiritual and temporal, begin to fall! What spiritual drowsiness! what cooling and a∣batement of love to God, and to one another! what weariness of religious exercise and spiritual watchful∣ness takes place! What contentious and bloody appea∣rances do showy professors, these empty clouds, make in the church! What mountains of guilt, offences, and separation, interpose between us and our all-glorious SUN! How gradually the light of knowledge and truth decreaseth! how the windows of DIVine ordinan∣ces are shut, and disregarded as useless! How eminent saints, these birds of paradise, drop their notes, and
<PB N="400" REF="406"/>
retire to their heavenly rest! and prophane owls, and other doleful creatures, men wicked and erroneous, boldly appear! To these tokens, what fearful night of wo succeds! When Jesus, our blessed Sun, withdraws himself, how bulks the moon like world in our heart! starry ministers, with their artificial light of gifts and modes, are all in all. How fall these stars, and be∣come earthly, senfual, devilish! What deceitful pre∣tenders, as blazing meteors, fly! What dark igno∣rance; what bemisting delusion; what works of wick∣edness abound! what idle sloth; what still stupidity; what wandering and stumbling prevail! How unused and inffectual is the glass of God's word! How bolted are mens hearts to Jesus the Lord!—O my soul, while it is called to day, hear his voice; harden not thine heart. Now is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation. Alas! the day is far spent, the night cometh, wherein no man can work. In Zion, a night is come; behold, it is come.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is called a MORNING and DAY BREAK <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xxi. 12.</NOTE>. How pleasant, and for a time growing, the <HI>shine</HI> of provi∣dential smiles or scripture light!

How boldly <HI>walk abroad</HI> the children of God, and early seek after him; while, as ashamed, the wicked hide them∣selves in obscurity, or put on masks of dissimulation!</P>

How sweetly the Holy Ghost, the celestial turtle, bespeaks our heart in the ordinances of the gospel!

Blessed period, when the winter-dispensation of Jewish ceremonies was finished; when thousands at once were gathered to their risen Lord;

<P N="5">5. It is compared to a SUMMER <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. and x. 5.</NOTE>. How comely, fragrant, flourishing, and effective, professors and ordi∣nances, then appear! How fast the redeemed, and their graces, ripen for the harvest of death, and the wicked, with their sins, for endless ruin! This, this, my soul, is the principal season of time. In it work out thy salvation with fear and trembling. Work the work of God, by believing on his Son; or, at the end, be ex∣posed to <HI>everlasting shame and contempt.</HI></P>

In different periods, how different are the appearance and duration of this opportunity! How often, in this harvest, is the increase much smaller than was at first expected!—If I waste it in vanity and sloth, what starving winter of unceasing vengeance awaits me!</P>

What though, through ignorance, stupidity, and self∣conceit, I should have no bands in it, I launch forth into eternal fire! I fall into the hands of an angry God! I leap blindfold into the horrors of damnation!—But, am I in Christ? Return then, O death, that I may look upon thee; where is now thy terror and thy sting? To me, how deeply dipt! how richly deckt in blood DIVine? Sweet angel of my Father's love, sent to con∣vey me to his arms! Tasting a Saviour's love, I could launch successive souls into eternity fast as the mo∣ments fly!</P>
<P N="2">2. It is compared to a WOLF <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlix. 14.</NOTE>. How it preys up∣on mankind; cuts them off; and consigns their bodies to the grave, to be the prey of vermine!</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="403" REF="409"/>
3. It is called a WARFARE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eccl. viii. 8.</NOTE>. With what arrows of pain and fear, it attacks mankind! With what per∣plexity, what struggling of nature, thy use to oppose it! Nor is there any <HI>discharge in this warfare;</HI> no e∣scaping of death. "It is appointed for men once to die, and after that the judgment."—Boldly war, my soul; it is with a conquered foe.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is called a DEPARTURE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 23. Eccl. xii. 3—6.</NOTE>. By it we leave our worldly friends, and stations; and enter into the un∣seen state of endless misery or happiness. We leave our younger and equals on earth; and are gathered to our fathers; you ransomed, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; nay, <HI>to God the Judge of all, and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant;</HI> and you wicked, to your father <HI>the devil, and his angels.</HI> Chiefly in old age, the pro∣gress of this exit is as follows: the hands and arms, these <HI>keepers of the house,</HI> become weak, and tremble; the once <HI>strong</HI> legs bow themselves, and bend under the weight of the body, the teeth, which <HI>grind</HI> and bruise our food, rot, fall out, and lose their power of chewing; the eyes, which as it were, <HI>look out at win∣dows,</HI> become dim, and darkened; the jaws close; the voice and breath become so low, as to be scarce dis∣cernible; foundness of sleep ceases, every thing disturbs it; the ears become dull; nor doth any ability or relish for <HI>music</HI> remain: the ssightest labour becomes difficult and terrible; every thing, though light as a <HI>grashopper is a burden;</HI> at last the nerves shrink; the veins, the arteries, the brain, and even the heart, that <HI>fountain</HI> of life, forbears to circulate the blood, that vital juice. Thus man goeth to his <HI>long home,</HI> the grave; and where is he!</P>

<P N="6">6. It is represented as the DISSOLVING <HI>of a house or tent</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 1.</NOTE>. Therein the earthly tabernacle of our bo∣dies are, and often gradually, demolished; and what

<P N="7">7. It is compared to a FLOOD <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. xc. 5.</NOTE>. Gradually, speedi∣ly, violently, irresistibly, and often to their great terror, it carries men into the ocean of ETERNITY. Ah! how many have their sandy foundation, their ill-founded hopes of everlasting happiness, overturned by it, and are carried into the depths of hell! Blessed Jesus, thou art my sure hope; no floods of death, no gates of hell, can prevail against thee; thou hast swallowed up death in victory.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is compared to REST <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Job. iii. 13. 17.</NOTE>. It finisheth mens enterprizes; makes them cease from their worldly em∣ploy; and how sweet and refreshing to the labouring saint! Hasten, my soul, to this rest, that the Lord may deal bountifully with thee. Thrice easy death! thrice easy grave, if I lie in his arms! There shall I rest from my sins, my burdens, my labours; there shall every wicked one cease from troubling, and tossed I, as a ship at anchor, lie at rest.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is compared to SLEEP <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 14.</NOTE>. Thereby the bo∣dies of the saints rest in hope, while their souls are occupied in the high praises of our God; the bodies of the wicked rest from labour in the prison of the grave, while their souls are tormented in hell. Lo! how these die in the midst of their work! those not till it be end∣ed! These, sore against their will! those, cheerfully! These multitudes, on the brink of Tophet; those, in Jesus' arms, far from danger. None shall for ever con∣tinue under the power of natural death, but in the re∣surrection be awakened; "some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt."</P>
<P N="10">10. It is compared to DARKNESS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Job x. 21.</NOTE>. It hides men from the view of the world. And alas! what terror, perplexity, and confusion often attend it! How many it conveys to infernal and utter darkness, where there is <HI>weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth!</HI></P>
<P N="11"><PB N="405" REF="411"/>
11. It is compared to SILENCE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xv. 1.</NOTE>. It finisheth our converse with men; husheth all our noise and bustle on earth; makes our remembrance to cease in this world,—My soul, be now silent before the Lord; be still and know that he is thy God: so shall I with joy descend to the house of silence.—When death hath lost his sting, how kind! how soft his cold embrace! how gladly would I rush into his arms!</P>
<P N="12">12. The death of the wicked is represented as a DRIVING or HURLING AWAY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 32.</NOTE>. How violently, in∣voluntarily, and with infinite danger, are they forced from their present enjoyments, and furiously cast into everlasting damnation! and alas! <HI>driven away in their wickedness,</HI> reigning in them, and charged upon them, to suffer <HI>the vengeance of eternal fire!</HI></P>

How much desired and expected by watchful saints! What darkness of carnal security will immediately precede it! With what striking tokens will it be ushered in! What full discovery it will make of our thoughts, words, and deeds! How undesired and terrible to wicked angels and men! How gladly would they hide themselves, and flock to their dens; but cannot! How brightly shall Jesus, our eter∣nal <HI>Sun,</HI> arise in the clouds! How alertly shall man∣kind leap from their sepulchral beds! How sweetly sing the saints, these birds redeemed!

Then shall some awake with joy and gladness; others with trembling and horros.—How precious, O Jesus, are the thoughts thereof to my soul! for what time so∣ever I awake, I shall be with thee: I shall behold thy face in righteousness, and be satisfied with thy likeness. How often I now awake with nought, but sin, but earth, in all my thoughts! But then my faults, my lusts, shall wake no more. I shall waken full of glory, full of God. Hark, my soul, the trumpet sounds, <HI>Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is compared to the REVIVING and FLOURISH∣ING of vegetables in the spring <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Is. xxvi. 19.</NOTE>.

Not one bewintered careless heart shall be found in creation; thousands long dead, shall now revive, spring up, and appear in their proper form. How Jesus, and his flowery nations, deck the earth!

The dead shall be raised, the living changed, the world judged; the wicked shall depart into everlasting punishment, and the righteous into life eternal; <HI>the earth, and the works therein, shall be burnt up!—</HI>O <HI>great day,</HI> honoured with the appearance of the great God!

<P N="2">2. It is compared to a REAPING TIME; a HARVEST-DAY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 39.</NOTE>. What great and important business shall be done thereon! How universally shall all nations be ga∣thered, and settled on a new bottom! How completely shall the wicked be separated from the righteous and by multitudes cast into hell-fire, to reap the fruit of their wickedness! With what enrapturing pleasure and gladness shall the redeemed reap the fruit of JEHOVAH's promises, and receive the all-gracious re∣ward of every good work! How triumphantly shall they enter into God's barn of everlasting glory and rest! It is thine, O Jesus, and thine, O saint, to go forth weeping, bearing precious seed, and to return re∣joicing, bring your sheaves with you. Go, my soul, into the house of mourning, rather than the house of mirth. They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.</P>

3. It is compared to a DAY OF ASSIZE or AC∣COUNT <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 30.—46. Rev. xx. 11. 15.</NOTE>. Pompously then shall Jesus, our appoint∣ed Judge, sit down on his awful bench, call, and in proper order sist before him all nations, and exhibit the most exact representation of their case. The saints being acquitted, shall be his assessors in judging others; the wicked shall be arraigned, and their guilt fully evinced. Then every thought, word, and deed of the children of men, must be accounted for; and upon clear manifestation of their state and conduct, shall just sentence and immediate execution proceed.—Great Judge, I kiss my lips, that I can give a right answer; <HI>It was exacted, and thou answerest it: all my faults were thine.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is compared to a MARRIAGE-DAY <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. xix. 7. Psal. xlv. 13. 14.</NOTE>.

Their <HI>clapping hands, shouting, singing,</HI> or <HI>rejoicing,</HI> denote the glorious works of God done on earth, and the abundant reason which saints have to express their joy and gladness.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is compared to a SEA <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 47.</NOTE>. What noise, dis∣quiet, disorder, and danger prevail in it!

snares and agents. How often thunderstruck, and be∣stormed by the judgments of God! How devoid of a right way to happiness! and filled with false and dan∣gerous paths! How overspread with briers and thorns, of wicked men, and of sinful entanglements! How bemisted with fogs of ignorance, perplexity, delusion, and crimes! How unsettled, troubled, and fearful their case, who dwell therein! and have it for their portion! Blessed be the Lord, who hath caused ri∣vers of gospel-ordinances and influences, to <HI>break out in the wilderness, and streams in the desart;</HI> hath therein planted his ransomed trees of righteousness; hath opened a <HI>high way,</HI> a <HI>way of holiness,</HI> Jesus and his law, <HI>for the redeemed</HI> to walk in; hath caused <HI>an handful of corn,</HI> a little of his word, sown on <HI>tops of mountains,</HI> upon most unpromising places and persons, to bring forth abundance of good fruit; hath built a city, whose citizens abound; and who will make the wilderness to <HI>blossom as the rose;</HI> to possess the ex∣cellency of Carmel and Sharon; the whole earth be∣ing filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</P>

What persons and things, most DIVersified in form and circumstances, grow up in it! How intermixed are saints and sinners! JEHOVAH owns and inspects it; many useful providences and ordinances he bestows upon the people of it; and at last reaps it by death and judgment. How exposed to inroads of Satan! Ye saints, it is your field of battle, where you war with the dragon, and fight with princi∣palities and powers.

We receive it, not as purchasers thereof by any work of ours, but as <HI>heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ;</HI> as the sons and daughters of Jesus, who purchased it with his blood. And oh all comprehending, pleasant, incorruptible, and undefiled <HI>inheritance of the saints in light,</HI> in which we <HI>inherit all things!</HI> are <HI>filled with all the fulness of God!</HI> enjoy Godhead, in the face and person of Jesus Christ, to the utmost stretches of our wish! But will God in every deed make me, an <HI>un∣matched heir of wrath,</HI> meet to be a partaker of the glory of his inheritance in the saints! Was it purchased with the blood; is it disponed in the testament, and ratified to me by the death of the Son of God! Hath he, by his intercession, sued out my right to it! Hath he, by his Spirit, infeoffed me therein!</P>

Nor sin, nor Satan, nor trouble, nor any bad thing of this world, is there found; but every thing good is for ever enjoyed in its highest perfection! There God shall be our sole monarch; Jesus our sole minister of rule and direction! DIVine persons, holy angels, and <HI>just men made perfect,</HI> our sole companions; Jesus' palace and throne, our only residence; JEHOVAH's everlasting ful∣ness, and love, our sole fountain and sea; the DIVine Spirit, with his immortal joys, our only rivers and streams; Jesus our ever present all accessible, and all bearing <HI>tree of life;</HI> unblasted, ten thousand fold glory, our only crop; God and the Lamb our only <HI>light,</HI> our unclouded, our unsetting <HI>sun;</HI> the unvailed face of an incarnate God, our only oracle and ordinance; God in him, our only provision, our only treasure; full con∣formity

Here JE∣HOVAH, Jesus, and his ransomed ones, in their proper order, for ever reign! angels are the honorary retinue! they and saints the celestial hosts! Perfect holiness in every will, is the law; unceasing hosannas, the mirth. Here God, the universal monarch, is immediately en∣joyed; the victories of his love for ever celebrated, and his unsearchable riches laid out to common use.

His perfections, purposes, and the person and office of his Son, as exhibited by the apostles, are <HI>the twelve</HI> jewelly <HI>foundations</HI> thereof. Christ, the pearl of great price, as preached to all the ends of the earth, is the <HI>twelve gates</HI> thereof.

Toilsome labour is no more; but our endless employ of contemplation, love, wonder, and praise, is unmixed pleasure. Here want is neither felt nor feared; no enemy is to contend with, or danger to come near us. But the work of Jesus' righteousness is peace, and the effect of it. <HI>quietness and assurance for ever.</HI> His people shall dwell in a <HI>peaceable babitation, and in quiet resting-places.</HI> Hasten, my soul, to this rest, that remaineth for the people of God; for the Lord shall deal bountifully with thee.</P>

With what joy shall we recount the deeds, and behold the glory of our DAY'S-MAN, that MIRACLE of wonders! that COMPEND of all things! that BEAUTY, HONOUR, and TRIUMPH! nay, ECLIPSER of the glory of creation! that MARROW of our love! LIFE of our joys!

O could my soul leap out, and drop her duller clay! scarce should a harp above aim at a sweeter or a higher song.—Hosanna to the Son of David; Hosanna in the highest.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. <HI>Metaphors respecting hell.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HELL is called a LAKE <HI>that</HI> BURNS <HI>with fire and brimstone</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rev. xx. 10.</NOTE>. Here men, like the ancient So∣domites, are constituted monuments of DIVine vengeance. Here every power of their soul, every member and sense of their body, is tormented in the flames! Here, ye children of disobedience, shall your lusts for ever rage in desire, and find nothing to satisfy them! no not a dry morsel; no not a drop of water to cool the tip of your tongue. When the arrows of the Almighty stick fast in you; when the lashes of conscience torment you; when devils insult, and conscience upbraids you, for throwing away your heavenly birthright, your God, and your glory; for incurring the vengeance of eternal fire, for an empty sip of polluted joy; with what anguish shall you bewail the infinite, the irrecoverable loss! with what horror shall you behold the frowns! with what envy, hatred, and malice, shall you tremble under the hand of an angry God!</P>
<P N="2">2. It is compared to TOPHET <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Is. xxx. 33. Matth. v. 22. Cr.</NOTE>, a valley near Je∣rusalem, where the Jews burnt their children to Molech, and the angel slew 185,000 Assyrians in one night. How near to the heavenly Jerusalem is the state of the damned! with what infuriated rage, madness, and an∣guish, they behold the happiness which they once de∣spised! How terrible their torment! how horrid their outcries!—Alas! who shall live when the Lord doth this!</P>
<P N="3">3. It is compared to a BURNING FIERY FURNACE, that cannot be quenched <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 42.</NOTE>. How terrible its appear∣ances! How exquisite and universal its torments! how painful and penetrating! And O shocking thought,
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>
FOR EVER! Ye sinners in Zion be afraid; let fearful∣ness surprise the hypocrites. Who among you <HI>shall dwell with devouring fire!</HI> who shall <HI>dwell with everlast∣ing burnings!</HI> While there is hope, flee, flee from the wrath to come. <HI>New is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation.</HI> God having raised up his Son Jesus, sends him to bless you, in turning you from your ini∣quities. But if he is rejected, how shall every offer of him, like oil, enrage the flames upon you, and, like ser∣pents, for ever inwardly sting you!</P>
<P N="4">4. It is compared to a PRISON <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 19.</NOTE>. Here transgress∣ors are for ever shut up to the fury of Almighty God; are exposed to the most shocking disgrace and contempt; sink under guilt and condemnation; have no rest, day nor night, but are tormented with the devil and his an∣gels. You minions of gaiety, consider the issue of your madness; FOR EVER, if mercy prevent not, God's un∣mixed wrath shall be your drink, your food; the howl∣ings of the damned your music; enraged fiends your inseparable companions.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is called a BOTTOMLESS PIT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rev. ix. 11.</NOTE>. How incon∣ceiveably dreadful, and durable, is the misery thereof! Amidst what inexpressible consternation and despair, do its inhabitants for ever sink into deeper scenes of tor∣ment and misery.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is represented as UTTER DARKNESS; and BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matth. viii. 12.</NOTE>. In it there is no glim∣mering of patience, mercy, or hope; but endless wicked∣ness, perplexity, anguish, torment, and terror.—Kiss now, my soul, the Son of God, lest he be angry, and I perish from the way.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is compared to a STORM <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. xi. 6.</NOTE>. O the violence, irresistibleness, and unsupportableness of DIVine wrath, raining upon them <HI>snares, fire, brimstone, and an hor∣rible tempest!</HI> Ah! how their souls tremble at the thunder-claps of vengeance! and are tossed by the fury of Almighty God!</P>
<P N="8">8. Infernal torments are compared to SALT <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 49.</NOTE>. Ah! how painful, penetrating, and permament! How power∣fully
<PB N="418" REF="424"/>
are the damned supported in existence under them! How exquisite their sensation of them! But stop, my soul, these doleful ideas;—How great his LOVE, who bore my hell for me! Being shed abroad in my heart, let it be a killing salt to every lust; a con∣suming fire to every corruption. God forbid, that sin which digged, which kindled, my Saviour's hell of wo for me, should be my pleasure, or my jest!</P>
