<HEAD>TRUTH and FALSHOOD: A TALE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IT chanc'd, one crouded levee day,</L>
<L>That TRUTH, who seldom loves to stray,</L>
<L>Wander'd, so authors grave report,</L>
<L>Along the park, and strol'd to court.</L>
<L>That very day mal a propos,</L>
<L>But things sometimes will happen so,</L>
<L>Her rival FALSHOOD thither came,</L>
<L>Who little thought to meet the dame;</L>
<L>Together there they press'd along,</L>
<L>And mingled in the motley throng,</L>
<L>There, as they never cou'd agree,</L>
<L>They jostled for precedency;</L>
<L>Quarrel'd like other female foes,</L>
<L>While bitt'rest taunts alternate rose.</L>
<L>"Madam, quoth FALSHOOD, why so rude▪</L>
<L>"I wonder you will here intrude;</L>
<L>"It wou'd be look'd on full as well,</L>
<L>"If you wou'd keep within your cell;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
For surely a more aukward mien</L>
<L>"Or simpler look was never seen;</L>
<L>"Henceforth retire, unhappy maid,</L>
<L>"Thy influence lost, thy pow'r decay'd,</L>
<L>"Thy triumphs o'er, thy pride suppress'd,</L>
<L>"Ev'n thy religion grown a jest;</L>
<L>"Dispute not for precedency,</L>
<L>"But yield to fashion and to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS as she spoke they chanc'd to spy</L>
<L>The graceful B—D passing by:</L>
<L>TRUTH view'd her fav'rite with delight;</L>
<L>She saw and kindled at the sight:</L>
<L>"Now slave (she cry'd) thy taunts forbear</L>
<L>"Behold my pow'r, my influence there;</L>
<L>"Hear ev'ry tongue in her commend</L>
<L>"The sister, daughter, mistress, friend,</L>
<L>"The mother kind, the tender wife,</L>
<L>"All that can soften human life;</L>
<L>"Above thy poor delusive wiles,</L>
<L>"She scorns thy arts, and hates thy smiles.</L>
<L>"Prepare to conquer or to yield;</L>
<L>"For now I dare thee to the field.</L>
<L>"Try all thy shifts, thy subtle lies,</L>
<L>"All that thy malice can devise;</L>
<L>"If thou canst taint her spotless fame,</L>
<L>"Or cast a shade o'er B—D's name;</L>
<L>"Henceforth remember I agree</L>
<L>"To be thy slave and follow thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<L>THUS spake fair TRUTH, with conscious pride;</L>
<L>Indignant FALSHOOD thus reply'd;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"THE danger's great, the task is hard,</L>
<L>"But conquest is my sure reward.</L>
<L>"If I can get my tale believ'd,</L>
<L>"And thou confess the world deceiv'd,</L>
<L>"Henceforth, remember, thou agree</L>
<L>"To be my slave and follow me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS said, away the goddess flew,</L>
<L>And summon'd all th' infernal crew;</L>
<L>ENVY, with looks of deadliest hate,</L>
<L>And RANCOUR eager for debate,</L>
<L>ILL-NATURE curst, SUSPICION sly,</L>
<L>And gaping fond CREDULITY,</L>
<L>And CALUMNY with iron lungs,</L>
<L>And SLANDER with a thousand tongues.</L>
<L>"Now, my illustrious friends, (she cry'd,)</L>
<L>"Your zeal and loyalty be try'd;</L>
<L>"Now let your ardent love be seen,</L>
<L>"To serve your mistress and your queen;</L>
<L>"Forge me a bold and impious tale,</L>
<L>"O'er truth and virtue to prevail;</L>
<L>"To please the mischief-loving mind,</L>
<L>"And sooth the malice of mankind;</L>
<L>"To shew your all-subduing art,</L>
<L>"And leave a sting in B—D's heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<L>SHE spake; and lo! at her command</L>
<L>The VICES all, a faithful band;</L>
<L>Each to his impious task assign'd,</L>
<L>In dreadful amity combin'd.</L>
<L>B—D <HI>is false,</HI> SUSPICION cry'd;</L>
<L>B—D <HI>is false,</HI> the crowd reply'd;</L>
<L>Quick ran the tale in whispers round,</L>
<L>And babbling eccho caught the sound;</L>
<L>The world was glad to be deceived,</L>
<L>And many doubted, more believ'd;</L>
<L>Pronounc'd the crime already known,</L>
<L>In hopes 'twou'd mitigate their own.</L>
<L>The sage PRUDERIA shook her head;</L>
<L>"'Twas strange! 'twas passing strange indeed!</L>
<L>"But we are women, women all,</L>
<L>"And like our grandam EVE must fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FLIRTILLA vow'd "'twas something odd</L>
<L>"A truth so bold should steal abroad;</L>
<L>"She never lov'd those virtuous wives,</L>
<L>"Who lead such tame domestic lives;</L>
<L>"And always fear'd some darling sin,</L>
<L>"Some guilty passion lurk'd within.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus CALUMNY each tongue inspir'd;</L>
<L>THUS SLANDER ev'ry bosom fir'd;</L>
<L>Ingenious MALICE play'd her part,</L>
<L>The poison ran through ev'ry heart,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y"/>
And sold to infamy and shame</L>
<L>The noblest and the fairest name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FALSHOOD triumphant left the town,</L>
<L>And pleased to W—b—n hasted down.</L>
<L>She met the vanquish'd goddess there</L>
<L>Retir'd to sooth the injur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d fair,</L>
<L>And with a smile insulting said;</L>
<L>"Now wilt thou yield, presumptuous maid?</L>
<L>"Thy conq'ror now, thy mistress see,</L>
<L>"Arise, my slave, and follow me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"I come, (fair TRUTH with scorn reply'd)</L>
<L>"To damp thy hopes, and check thy pride,</L>
<L>"Go to that vile detested seat,</L>
<L>"Where malice, pride, and folly meet;</L>
<L>"But let no more thy rashness dare</L>
<L>"To blast the good, or wound the fair;</L>
<L>"For know, I mean to meet thee there.</L>
<L>"What will thy little arts avail,</L>
<L>"When TRUTH shall come to thwart thy tale?</L>
<L>"Soon will thy triumphs then be o'er,</L>
<L>"Thy vain delusions please no more;</L>
<L>"Brighten'd by thee her spotless mind,</L>
<L>"As the pure gold by fire refin'd,</L>
<L>"Shall with superior lustre shine,</L>
<L>"And all her virtues more divine;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
"B—D shall press her to his arms,</L>
<L>"And smile at her exalted charms;</L>
<L>"Thy pious purpose shall commend,</L>
<L>"And thank thee as his warmest friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"BUT to be just, I own thy pow'r,</L>
<L>"And from this great important hour</L>
<L>"My duty I shall better know,</L>
<L>"And learn instruction from a foe.</L>
<L>"Henceforth I'll borrow arms of thee,</L>
<L>"Thy zeal and active industry;</L>
<L>"Cautious thy steps I will attend,</L>
<L>"My injur'd vot'ries to defend;</L>
<L>"To bring a balm for virtue's aid,</L>
<L>"And heal the wounds which thou hast made;</L>
<L>"To brush thy cobweb arts away,</L>
<L>"Dispel the cloud, and gild the day;</L>
<L>"I'll serve, to set my fav'rites free,</L>
<L>"And <HI>follow</HI> but to <HI>conquer</HI> thee.</L>
