<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Archbishop ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>GEORGE ABBOT, was born October 29th, 1562, at Guildford, in Surrey, of very wor∣thy parents, remarkably distinguished by their steady zeal for the Protestant Religion, for their living long, and happily together, and for their singular felicity in their children.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Maurice Abbot, was by trade a Clothworker, and settled at the town of Guildford, in Surrey, where he married his wife Alice March, and suffered for his stedfastness in the Protestant Religion, through the means of Dr. Story, who was a great persecutor of such persons in the reign of Queen Mary. But these storms being blown over, they passed the remainder of their days quietly, living together fifty-eight years. She deceased September 15, 1606, and he September 25, the same year, the former being eighty, and the latter eighty-six years of age. They left behind them six sons, of whom Robert the eldest, was then one of the King's chaplains, George, had been thrice vice-chancellor of Oxford, and their youngest son Mau∣rice, was at this time an eminent merchant of the city of London.</NOTE></P>
<P>While his mother was pregnant with this son, she is said to have had a dream which proved at once an omen, and an instrument of his future fortunes. Her dream was this. She fancied she was told in her
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
sleep that if she could eat a Jack, or Pike, the child she went with would prove a son, and rise to great preferment. Not long after this, in taking a pail of water out of the river Wey, which ran by their house, she accidentally caught a Jack, and had thus, an odd opportunity of fulfilling her dream. This story being much talked of, and coming to the ears of some persons of distinction, they offered to be∣come sponsors for the child, which was kindly accept∣ed, and they had the goodness to afford many testi∣monies of their affection to their godson while at school, and after he was sent to the university. Such was the good effects of his mother's dream.</P>
<P>When he was grown up to an age proper for re∣ceiving the first tincture of learning, he was sent with his elder brother Robert to the free school, erected in their native town of Guildford, by K. Edward VI; and having passed thro' the rudiments of Literature, under the care of Mr. Francis Taylor, who had then the direction of that school, he was in 1578 removed to the university of Oxford, and entered a student in Baliol College. On November the 29th, 1583, being then bachelor of arts, he was elected probationer fellow of his college; and afterwards proceeding in the faculty of arts, he entered into holy orders, and became a celebrated preacher in the university. He commenced bachelor of divinity in 1593, and pro∣ceeded doctor in that faculty, in May, 1597: and in the month of September, of the same year, he was elected master of University College. About this time it was, that the first differences began between him and Dr. Laud, which subsisted as long as they lived, and was the cause of great uneasiness to both. On March 6, 1599, he was installed dean of Win∣chester, in the room of Dr. Martin Heton, who was
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
preferred to the bishoprick of Ely: Dr. Abbot be∣ing then about thirty-seven years of age.</P>
<P>In 1600, he was vice-chancellor of the Universi∣ty of Oxford, and distinguished himself while in that high office, by the opinion he gave with respect to the setting up again the cross in Cheapside, about which there were great disputes, but in the end he carried his point against Dr. Bancroft, then Bishop of London, and afterwards Archbishop of Canter∣bury; which gained him great reputation as appears by a tract published on that subject.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>The cross at Cheapside was taken down in the year 1600, in order to be repaired, and upon this occasion, the citizens of London desired the advice of both universities on this question; Whether the said cross should be re-erected or not? and Dr. Abbot, as vice-chancellor of Oxford, gave it as his opinion, that the crucifix with the dove upon it should not be again set up, but approved rather of a pyramid, or some other matter of mere ornament, for the reasons assigned in his letter. In this determination he acted consistently with his own practice, when in his said office he caused several superstitious pictures to be burnt at the market-place of Oxford, and among the rest, one in which was the figure of God the Father, over a crucifix, ready to receive the Soul of Christ; and he professes in this letter, that he was moved to such proceedings by his own ob∣servation and experience. <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">I remember, says he, in that col∣lege (Baliol) where I first lived, a young man was taken pray∣ing, and beating his breast, before a crucifix in a window; which caused the master and fellows, to pull it down, and set up other glass. Which example, makes me nothing doubt, but that the cross in Cheapside hath many in the twilight and morning early, who do reverence before it, besides Cam∣pian, whose act is famous, or rather infamous, for it. And, I am informed, that so much hath been signified by the neighbours, or inquest, making presentments concerning the circumstances of this cause. By all which, I do conclude, that it is a monument of their superstition; a great induce∣ment, and may be a ready way to idolatry; and that there can be no tolerable use of this matter, which may be able to countervail the dangers and obloquy arising upon the retain∣ing of it; and so much the rather, because it is perceived that many evil affected men do make their advantage from hence, to insinuate into the minds of their credulous hearers, that it is a token of the return of their faith again into this land, since their monuments are not extinguished in the chief street of our greatest city.</P>
</LETTER> He afterwards desires, that the reader would observe, he says, the magistrates are to redress such enormities: <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">For, continues he, I do not permit inferior men to run headlong about such matters; and to rend, break, and tear, as well within, as without the churches; which was that which Luther reprehended, but the advice and consent of superior powers is to be had herein, that all things may be done decently and in order.</P>
</LETTER> He held it therefore necessary, that they should apply to the Archbishop of Canterbury (Whit∣gift) and to the Bishop of London (Bancroft) for instructions. The issue of the matter was, that the cross only was erected again, without either the body, or the dove, which was agree∣able in the main to the sentiments of the vice-chancellor, and the heads of houses at Oxford.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
In 1603, he was again chosen vice-chancellor of the university, and discharged that office a second time with general approbation. In 1605, he was a third time vice-chancellor. In the succeeding year, he is said to have had a great share in the troubles of Laud, who was called to an account by the vice-chan∣cellor, Dr. Ayry, for a Sermon of his preached before the university; and that year likewise, he lost his father and mother.</P>
<P>In 1608, died his great patron Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset, Lord High Treasurer of England, and Chancellor of the University of Oxford, sudden∣ly at the council table, at whose funeral, Dr. Abbot preached a sermon, which was afterwards printed, and generally commended. After his decease, Dr. Abbot became chaplain to George Hume, Earl of Dunbar, and Treasurer of Scotland, one of King James's early favourites, and who had all along had
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
a very high share in his esteem, and with him he went this year into Scotland, in order to assist in the exe∣cution of a very important design, for establishing an union between the Churches in that kingdom, and this, wherein he behaved with so much prudence and moderation, as gained him a very high character, and is thought to be the first step to all his future preferments.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>There is no point in which all the writers who mention this Prelate, more clearly agree, than in this, that his journey to Scotland, brought him into that height of favour with the King, which so suddenly raised him in little more than three years, from Dean of Winchester, to Archbishop of Canterbury; yet it has so fallen out, that hitherto, his transactions in Scotland have lain so much in the dark, that it is a very difficult thing to discern how he merited by them, so high a share of the Royal favour. To explain therefore this hitherto untouched point, and set this matter in a clear light, shall be the business of this note, the rather because it will shew how unjustly this great man has been charged with unfriendliness to the establishment of the Church of England, and coldness in regard to the Hie∣rarchy. King James had suffered so much before his accession to the Crown of England, from the spirit and power of the Presbyterians in Scotland, that he was greatly set on restoring the ancient form of government by Bishops in that kingdom; the care of which was principally entrusted to the Earl of Dun∣bar, to whom Dr. Abbot was now chaplain. That noble Lord, who is by all writers allowed to have been both the wisest and best man of all the favourites of that nation, had proceeded so far in this matter two years before, as to obtain an act for the restitution of the estates of Bishops, but the Presbyterians made so steady a resistance, that the consequences which were hoped from the restoring of that order, were in the utmost danger of being disappointed. But by the skill and prudence, the sound sense, and great moderation of Dr. Abbot, these difficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties were removed, and the clergy of Scotland, who had refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to admit the Bishops for their moderators in their church synods, were brought to a better temper, and things put into such a train, as afterwards produced the entire establishment of the Episcopal Order in Scotland; for which the King had been so long struggling, and to so little purpose. The account given by the famous historian of the Church of Scotland, (David Calderwood) sufficiently proves the truth of what has been ass∣erted. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'About the end of June, (1608) says he, the Earl of Dunbar came from court, and with him two English Doctors, Abbot and Higgins. Dr. Maxy, one of the King's chaplains came by sea. It was reported that no small sums of money were sent down with him, to be distributed among the minist∣ers and some others. The English doctor seemed to have no other direction, but to persuade the Scots that there was no substantial difference in religion, between the two realms, but only in things indifferent, concerning government and ceremonies: and to report, that it was his majesty's will, that England should stand as he found it, and Scotland as he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft it. But when he came to St. Andrews, Mr. Robert Howie, a man of a seditious and turbulent spirit, declaimed against the discipline and government of our Kirk; and then they utter∣ed their mind in plain terms: no order was taken with so manifest a breach, after the last conference. This was the policy of the aspiring Bishops, to cry peace, peace, and to crave silence of their opposites; when, in the mean time, they minded not to be silent themselves, when they found occasion.'</Q> This very clearly proves, that it was by a kind and moderate, not a haughty and severe, behaviour, that the English doctor, as he calls Dean Abbot, won so much upon the Scots ministers, as to bring them into a compliance with the King's desires; so that in two years afterwards, the Lord High Treasurer, Dunbar, who was entirely governed in this matter by the advice of his able chaplain, procured an act in the Ge∣neral Assembly, by which it was provided. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King should have the Indiction (or calling) of all General Assemblies. That the Bishops, or their deputies should be perpetual Mo∣derators of the diocesan synods. That no excommunication, or absolution, should be pronounced without their approbation. That all presentations of benefices should be made by them; and that the deprivation or suspension of
ministers should be∣long to them. That every minister at his admission to a be∣nefice, should take the oath of supremacy, and canonical o∣bedience. That the visitation of the diocese, shall be per∣formed by the Bishop or his deputy only. And finally, that the Bishop should be moderator of all conventions, for exer∣cisings or prophesyings, which should be held within their bounds.'</Q> All which were afterwards ratified and confirmed by authority of the parliament of that kingdom. Such were the merits of Dr. Abbot in this respect, and so great justice was there done to them by his noble patron, the Treasurer, in the report he made to his majesty, of the Dean's behaviour in this respect, that, in conjunction with the service rendered his majesty, by giving his unquestioned testimony in the affair of Gowry's conspiracy, (of which a full account shall be given in the succeeding note) he was raised so high, and so firmly fixed in the esteem of his royal master, as that no opposition could prevent his arriving at the supreme dignity in his profession. As a proof of his advancing his fortune by this means, and not otherwise, it may not be amiss to transcribe the observation of a contemporary historian, (Speed) after Dr. Abbot was raised to the archiepiscopal dignity, who tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the first preacher, and the first in that embassage, which King James sent into Scotland, to establish those neighbouring Churches, was he, whose eminency both for place and piety, is now worthily foremost in guiding our own; and whose blessed travels in that service, as they were acceptable to God, his majesty, and that nation; so are they a document to others, how powerful and admirably successful true learning is, where it is guided with true prudence; and where piety and the love of God's glory, is linked with charity and zeal of man's good.'</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
While he was at Edinburgh upon this occasion, a
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
prosecution was commenced against one George Sprot, Notary of Aymouth, for having been con∣cerned in Gowry's conspiracy eight years before, for which he was tried before Sir William Hart, Lord Justice General of Scotland, condemned and execu∣ted. A large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge, and a narrative prefixed thereto, by Dr. Abbot, who had been eye-witness of all that passed, and this was published at London, in order to settle the minds of the people, with regard to that conspiracy; which had hitherto been looked upon as a very mysterious affair, and about the reality of which there had been very great doubts.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>There had been very great doubts.</HI>] It is a difficult thing to give a clear account of this matter, within the short compass of a note; and yet the importance, as well as curiosity of the subject, very obscurely treated by most of our historians, as well as its close connection with the history of Dean Abbot's life, render it absolutely necessary. The conspiracy was framed by John, Earl of Gowry, son to that Earl of Gowry, who had been executed for surprizing the King's person at Ruthen Cast∣le, in 1584; and carried on with great diligence and seerecy. The Scheme was to invite the King, upon some pretence or other, to the Earl's house at Perth, and there to make sure of him. This design was executed on Tuesday August 5, 1600, when the King was brought thither by Mr. Alexander Ruthen, brother to the Earl, accompanied by some persons of quality, under pretence of seeing some chymical experiment; and for this purpose after dinner, being brought to a chamber at the top of the house, Mr. Alexander Ruthen shut the door, and suddenly fell to upbraiding the King with the death of his father, for which he was now to make satisfaction; and, after this speech, left him for some time to the mercy of the execu∣tioner, who refused to do that office, though Alexander return∣ing had, if this man had not hindered him; but the King with much struggling got at last to a window, and cried out so loud, that the lords and gentlemen of his retinue heard him, and came to his assistance; the Earl himself was killed by Sir Thomas Ereskine, the captain of the King's guard, as he was going to help his brother, and Alexander Ruthen was dispatch∣ed by Ramsay, one of the King's pages, who being well ac∣quainted with the house, came by the back-stairs time enough to preserve his master. When the ministers of Edinburgh were desired to assemble the people, and give God thanks for this deliverance, they excused themselves, as not acquainted with the particulars; and when they were pressed only to make known to the people, that the King had escaped a great danger, and to excite them to thanksgiving:—they answered, that they were not very well satisfied, as to the truth of the matter; and that nothing was to be uttered in the pulpit, but that which might be spoke in faith. Upon this, the council order∣ed the Bishop of Ross to assemble the people, to declare the whole affair, and to make a prayer of thanksgiving, which was done accordingly. In November following, a parliament was held at Edinburgh, in which the estate of Gowry was confis∣cated, the whole family attainted; and the 5th of August esta∣blished by act of parliament, for a day of thanksgiving in all succeeding times. After King James's accession to the throne of England, he appointed a weekly commemoration, by a Tuesday's sermon at court: and now, on the execution of this Sprot, an account of his share in the conspiracy was published, with a preface to the reader, subscribed by Dr. Abbot, and full as large as the account itself. As this little tract is become very scarce, it may not be amiss to give some passages from it, in order to set this matter in a clearer light. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There are few in this island, says he, of any understanding, but have heard of the traiterous, and bloody attempt of the Earl Gowrie and his brother, against the person and life, of our most blessed Sovereign. Wherein albeit there were such evidences, and arguments, as that any man who would have taken notice thereof, might have been sufficiently informed therein, even at the very first, and afterward, by the clear depositions (for most pregnant circumstances) and ample attestations of many persons of honour, and quality; the parliament of that king∣dom took full knowledge thereof, and accordingly proceeded to the forfeiting of the whole estate of that Earl, and of his heirs for ever: yet some humorous men, whom in that respect, I may justly term unthankful unto God, and undutiful to their King, out of fond imaginations, or rather, if you will, se∣ditious suppositions of their own, did both at home and abroad, by whisperings and secret buzzings into the ears of the people, (who were better persuaded of them than indeed there was cause) employ their wits and tongues, to obscure the truth of that matter, and to cast an imputation where it was least deserved. Which, when God had permitted, for the space of some years to ranckle and fester in the bowels of those who were the authors of it; the same God, in his wis∣dom, at last meaning to cure them, if they would be cured, of that malady, discovered that in the same treason, although carried never so secretly, there were other confederates, of whom hitherto the world had taken no kind of knowledge. And albeit two of the persons interested in that business, were lately dead, and departed unto far greater torment, than all the earth could lay upon them, (unless they died repentant) yet it was apprehended, that a third party remained, who had foreknowledge of that conspiracy, and was able to utter much of the secrets of it: one George Sprot, a notary, inhabiting at Ayemouth, a place well known in that county. Which matter, or some part thereof, being made known to an honour∣able person, [the Earl of Dunbar] a most faithful servant to His Majesty: first, by some words that fell from Sprot himself, and afterwards, by some papers found upon him; it was so wisely carried, and so prudently brought about, by the great care and diligence of that nobleman (God Almighty blessing the business) that so much was revealed, as followeth in this treatise, upon the acts to be seen, which are here set down at large, word for word, as they agree with the process origi∣nal, and other examinations, that such as have been averse, may at last receive satisfaction. Touching all which I shall say nothing, but only report that which befel upon the day of his death, when he suffered for that treason. Having then the sentence passed on him, upon Friday, August 12, 1608, in the forenoon, and publickly being warned to prepare him∣self to his end, which must be that day after dinner, he most willingly submitted himself unto that punishment, which (as he then acknowledged) he had justly deserved. And being left to himself, till dinner time was expired, then came to him into that private place where he remained, some of the reve∣rend bishops, diverse lords of the Session, two of the English ministers there employed by his majesty, with diverse other ministers of the town of Edinburgh. Before whom he first acknowledged and avouched his former confession to be true, and that he would die in the same; and then falling on his knees, in a corner of that room where he and they then were, in a prayer to God uttered aloud, he so passionately deplored his former wickednesses, but especially that sin of his, for which he was to die, that a man may justly say, he did in a sort, deject and cast down himself to the gates of Hell, as if he should there have been swallowed up in the gulf of des∣peration: yet presently laying hold upon the mercies of God in Christ. he rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed himself, and strangely lifted up his soul unto the throne of grace, applying joy and comfort to his own heart so effectually, as cannot well be described. In the com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting of this coafolation into his inward man, he burst out into tears, so plentifully flowing from him, that for a time they stopped his voice. The sight, and hearing whereof, wrought so forcible an impression in those persons of honour, and learned men, who beheld him, that there was scarce any one of them, who could refrain tears in the place, as diverse of themselves that day did witness unto me.—After∣ward being brought to the scaffold where he was to die, he uttered many things, among which, I observed these: He acknowledged to the people, that he was come thither to suf∣fer most deservedly; that he had been an offender against Al∣mighty God, in very many respects; but that none of his sins were so grievous unto him, as that, for which he must die; where in, notwithstanding he was not an actor, but a conceal∣er only. That he was ingyred (involved) in it by the Laird of Rastalrig, and his servant, the Laird of Bour, both which, he said, were men that professed not religion. Whereupon, he exhorted men to take heed, how they accompanied with such as are not religious; because, said he, with such as make not profession of religion, there is no faith, no truth, no holding of their word, as himself had tried and found. But touching the treason, for the concealing whereof he was condemned, he added, that he was preserved alive to open that secret mystery which so long had lain hid. That God had kept him since that attempt of the Earl Gowrie, from very many dangers, but notedly from one, when being in appa∣rent hazard of drowning, he was strangely delivered; which, said he, was God's work, that I might remain alive unto this happy and blessed day, that the truth 
might be made known. And now I 
confess my fault, to the shame of myself, and to the shame of the devil; but to the glory of God. And I do it not either for fear of death, or for any hope of life (for I have deserved to die, and am unworthy to live) but because it is the truth, which I shall seal with my blood. My fault, saith he, is so great, that if I had a thousand lives, and could die ten thousand deaths, yet I might not make satisfaction, that I shou'd conceal such a treason against so gracious a King. These, and the like words, when he had spoken upon one side of the scaffold, he turned him to the second side, and afterward to the third (that all the people might hear) where he spake to the same purpose as formerly he had done.—And here, being told by the said ministers, and other persons of quality, that being so near his departure out of the world, it concerned him to speak nothing but the truth, and that upon the peril of his soul: he answered, that to the end that they should know that he had spoken no∣thing but the verity, and that his confession was true in every respect, he would (at the last gasp) give them some ap∣parent token for the confirmation of the same. Then fitting himself to the ladder, the executioner cometh to him, and as the manner is, asking forgiveness of him; with all my heart, saith he, for you do but your office, and it is the thing I desire; because, suffering in my body, I shall in my soul be joyned to my Saviour. Ascending up to the ladder, he desired the people to sing a psalm with him, which they did with many a weeping eye. He named the 6th psalm, and beginning, or taking it up himself, in every verse or line thereof, he went before the people, singing both loud and tunably unto the very end. Then once again confirming and avowing his former confession, he covered his own face, and, commending his soul to God, he was turned off the ladder; where hanging by the neck some little while, he three several times, gave a loud clap with his hands, that all the standers-by might hear, which was the sign or token (as it seemeth) which he a little before had said, that he would give at the last gasp, for the rati ication and avowing of those things, which by his con∣fession he had so many times declared and delivered. These things were done in the open sight of the sun, in the King's capital town, at the market-cross in Edinburgh, in the pre∣sence os diverse thousands of all sorts; of the nobility, of the clergy, of the gentry, of the burgesses, of women and children, myself, with the rest of the English ministers, stand∣ing by, and looking on, and giving God the glory, that after so long a space as eight years and eight days (for so it was by just computation, after the attempt of Gowrie) he was pleased to give so noble a testimony unto that, which by some maligners, hath been secretly called in question, without any ground or reason. I have reported at length those particu∣lars, which I heard and saw; which that honourable person∣age who wrote this treatise following, doth somewhat more bric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y deliver, but yet both of us very truly, as thousands can witness.'</Q></P></NOTE></P>

to be encountered in this northern nation, that it gave

the fittest person, to put things again into the right channel. The case was this, his majesty being en∣gaged in the mediation of peace between the crown of Spain, and the United Provinces; by which the sovereignty of the latter, was to be acknowledged by the former: he demanded the advice of the con∣vocation then sitting, as to the lawfulness of espou∣sing the cause of the States. Upon this opening, they launched at once into the wide sea of politicks, and instead of satisfying the King's Scruples, excited new jealousies and apprehensions, as appears by a very singular letter written by him to Dr. Abbot, upon this subject<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>A very singular letter written by him to Dr. Abbot, upon this subject.</HI>] This Letter from the King, to Dr. Abbot, was first published on occasion of the famous dispute between Dr. Sher∣lock, Dean of St. Paul's, and his adversaries, on his taking the oaths to King William III, after some hesitation, and ground∣ing the defence of his conduct on (Bishop) Overall's Convoca∣tion Book. It is not necessary here, to enter at all into the merits of that dispute; but as the letter has a close connection with the history of the Archbishop's life, the reader will not be displeased to see it.<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Dr. Abbot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot abstain to give you my judgment of the proceed∣ings in the convocation, as you will call it; and both as <HI>rex in solio,</HI> and <HI>unus gregis in ecclesia,</HI> I am doubly concerned. My title to the crown, nobody calls in question, but they that neither love you nor me, and you may guess whom I mean; all that you, and your brethren, have said of a king in pos∣session (for that word, I tell you, is no more, than that you make use of in your canon) concerns not me at all: I am the next heir, and the crown is mine by all rights you can name, but that of conquest; and Mr Solicitor, has sufficiently expressed my own thoughts, concerning the nature of kingship; and concerning the nature of it, <HI>ut in mea persona,</HI> and, I believe you were all of his opinion, at least none of you said any thing contrary to it, at the time he spoke to you from me: but you know all of you, as I think, that my reason of calling you together, was to give your judgments; how far a christian, and a protestent King, may concur to affist his neighbours to shake off their obedience to their own sovereign? Upon the account of oppression, tyran∣ny, or what else you like to name it. In the late Queen's time, this kingdom was very free in assisting the Hollanders, both with arms and advice, and none of your coat ever told me, that any scrupled at it in her reign. Upon my coming to England, you may know that it came from some of your∣selves, to raise scruples about this matter; and albeit, I have often told my mind concerning <HI>jus regium insubditos,</HI> as in <HI>May</HI> last, in the star chamber, upon the occasion of Hales's pamph∣let; yet I never took any notice of these scruples, till the affairs of Spain and Holland forced me to it. All my neigh∣bours call on me to concur in the treaty between Holland and Spain, and the honour of the nation will not suffer the Hol∣landers to be abandoned, especially after so much money and men spent in their quarrel; therefore, I was of the mind to call my clergy together, to satisfy not so much me, as the world about us, of the justness of my owning the Holland∣ers at this time. This I needed not to have done, and you have sorced me to say, I wish I had not; you have dipped too deep, in what all kings reserve among the <HI>arcana imperii;</HI> and whatever aversion you may profess against God's being the author of sin, you have stumbled upon the threshold of that o∣pinion, in saying, upon the matter, that even tyranny is God's authority, and should be remembered as such. If the King of Spain should return to claim his old pontifical right to my kingdom, you leave me to seek for others to fight for it, for you tell us upon the matter beforehand, his authority is God's authority, if he prevail.</P>
<P>Mr Doctor, I have no time to express my mind further on this theory business; I shall give you my orders about it by Mr Solicitor, and until then, meddle no more in it, for they are edge tools; or rather like that weapon that is said to cut with one edge, and cure with the other: I commit you to God's protection, good Dr. Abbot, and rest</P>

It does not appear what effect this letter of the
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
King's produced, but in all probability it answered his majesty's end in writing it, as it is an incontest∣able proof of the confidence he had in the person it was written to. At least thus much is certain, that Dean Abbot, stood so high in the King's favour, that on the death of Dr Overton, Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, which happened the latter end of April, 1609, his majesty thought of Dr. Abbot for his suc∣cessor, and he was accordingly consecrated Bishop of those united sees, on December 3, in the same year.</P>
<P>But this it seems did not appear in the King's eyes a sufficient recompence, for the services rendered him by so able a man; and therefore, before he had set a month in this bishoprick, he was translated to Lond∣on, that see becoming void by the death of Dr. Tho∣mas Ravis, and he was accordingly removed thither on the 20th of January following. It was but a short time that he possessed both these bishopricks, and yet in that short time, he so remarkably distin∣guished himself by the diligent performance of his function, by constant preaching, and by expressing the utmost readiness to promote learning, and learned men, that he obtained a general good character, as appears from several memorials of those times<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>As appears from several memorials of those times.</HI>] While he was Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield, it appears, that he sollicited Abp. Bancroft, to bestow a prebend upon Dr. Thomas James, who was Sir Thomas Bodley's Librarian at Oxford. In the year 1610, Thomas Tisdale, of Glimpton, in Oxfordshire, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> bequeathed five thousand pounds to Dr. George Abbot, then Bishop of London, Sir John Bennet, and Dr. Aray, to purchase lands for the maintainance of seven fellows and six scholars; which money was laid out in the purchase of two hun∣dred and fifty pounds a year. Afterwards, Richard Wightwick, B. D. rector of East-Isle, in Berkshire, gave lands to the yearly value of one hundred pounds, for the maintenance of three fellows, and four scholars; upon which, the trustees before∣mentioned, having repaired, and, in a manner, rebuilt Broad-Gate-Hall, in Oxford, procured in the reign of King James, upon their petition setting forth these facts, a charter of Mort∣main, for seven hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> to this new founda∣tion, which was called Pembroke College, in respect to William, Earl of Pembroke, then Chancellor of the University; and for our Prelate's activity in accomplishing this affair, Dr. Thomas Clayton, who was the first master of the new college, wrote him a very handsome letter of acknowledgement, which is still extant. See Ward's Lives of the Professors of Gresham Col∣lege, fol. 1740. p. 210. in August, 1610, he consecrated the new church-yard, on the west side of Fleet-Ditch, the around of which had been given to the inhabitants of St. Bride's parish, by the Earl of Dorset. His zeal, and indefatigable diligence, in the publick exercise of his function, were so remarkable, and the conduct of his private life so exemplary, as well as irre∣proachable, that we find him celebrated by an eminent poet. [J. Davis of Hereford, in his Scourge of Folly, &amp;c. in honour of many noble and worthy Persons,] for uniting the wisdom of the serpent, with the innocency of the dove: which was not only true of him then, but in the whole succeeding course of his life; wherein it may be truly said, that as his abilities raised him to preferment, so nothing but his rigid virtue and incorruptible probity, exposed him to those storms of envy and malice, which, however they might affect his fortune, could never shake his constancy or prejudice his reputation.</NOTE>.</P>

While the good Bishop was thus employed, a new opportunity offered of the King's testifying his esteem of, and confidence in, this worthy person, by the Archiepiscopal See of Canterbury's becoming vacant as it did, on the 2d of November, 1610, by the death of Dr. Richard Bancroft.</P>
<P>The court Bishops immmediately cast their eyes upon the celebrated Dr. Lancelot Andrews, then Bishop of Ely, and pointed him out to the King, as one sufficiently qualified to take upon him the go∣vernment of the Church; and they thought this re∣commendation
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
joined to the King's known regard for the parts and piety of this eminent man, enough to secure his promotion to the Primacy; but either the King himself thought of the Bishop of London, or he was proposed to him by his old friend and patron, the Earl of Dunbar; and therefore, without taking the advice of those prelates, his majesty prefer∣red Bishop Abbot to the throne of Canterbury, in which he was seated on the 9th of April, 1611; and on the 23d of June following, was sworn of his ma∣jesty's most honourable privy council.</P>
<P>Thus we see him, before he had arrived at the age of fifty, exalted to the highest dignity of the Church, and celebrated by one of his con-tempora∣ries, and a bishop too, [Godwin] for his learning, eloquence, and indefatigable diligence in preaching and writing, notwithstanding the great burthen that lay upon him, from the necessary attendance on the duties of his high office; especially presiding in the high commission court, which sat weekly at his pa∣lace, and his regular assisting at council, which, while his health permitted, he never failed.</P>
<P>At this time, he was in the highest favour both with Prince and people; and appears to have had a principal hand in all the great transactions in Church and State; he was never esteemed excessively fond of power, or desirous of carrying his Prerogative, as Primate of England, to an extraordinary height; yet as soon as he had taken possession of the archbishoprick, he shewed a steady resolution in the maintainance of the rights of the high commission court, and would not submit to Lord Coke's prohibitions.</P>
<P>He likewise shewed his concern for the interest of the Protestant Religion abroad, by procuring his majesty's application to the States General, against
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
Conrade Vorstius, whom they called to the Profess∣orship of Leyden; in which affair Sir Ralph Win∣wood was employed: and when it was found diffi∣cult to obtain from the States that satisfaction which the King desired, his Grace, in conjunction with the Lord Treasurer, Salisbury, framed an expedient for contenting both parties.</P>
<P>In all probability this alarmed some of the warm churchmen at home, who were by no means pleased with the King's discountenancing abroad, those opi∣nions which themselves favoured in both universities; but, whatever their sentiments upon this matter might be, Archbishop Abbot seems to have had as great concern for the Church, as any of them, when he thought it really in danger, as appears by a short and plain letter of his to Sir Ralph Winwood, about one Mr. Amias, who had been appointed preacher in the English congregation at the Hague, of whom the Bishop says, that he was a fit person to breed up the captains and soldiers there in mutiny and faction, and, consequently, very unfit for his office.</P>
<P>His great concern for the true interest of religion, made him a zealous promoter of the match between the Elector Palatine, and the Princess Elizabeth; and that Prince being here in the beginning of the year 1612, his Grace thought fit to invite the nobi∣lity that attended him to an entertainment, at his ar∣chiepiscopal palace at Lambeth, where, though un∣invited and unexpected, the Elector himself resorted, to shew his great respect for the Archbishop, and was so well pleased with his welcome, that when he feast∣ed the members of the privy council at Essex House, he shewed particular respect to the Archbishop, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who attended him.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth of February following, the
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
marriage was solemnized with great splendor, the Archbishop performing the ceremony on a stage e∣rected in the middle of the royal chapel; and on the tenth of April, his Electoral Highness returned to Germany; but before his departure, he made a pre∣sent of plate to the Archbishop, of the value of a thousand pounds, as a mark of the just sense he had of the pains his Grace had taken in the accomplish∣ing his marriage; and as an additional mark of his confidence, he wrote to him from Canterbury, in relation to the causes of that discontent, with which he left England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>To the causes of that discontent, with which he left Eng∣land.</HI>] The Prince Elector Palatine, a little before he left Eng∣land, addressed himself to the King, in hopes of obtaining the enlargement of the Lord Gray, who had been a long time a prisoner in the tower; but this application so little pleased the King, that he told him roundly in answer, he marvelled, how he should become a suitor for a man whom he neither knew, or ever saw; to which the Prince Elector answered, that this was true, but that he was recommended to him by his uncles, the Duke de Bouillon, Prince Maurice of Nassau, and Count Hen∣ry, who were well acquainted with him. In all probability, this, instead of giving the King satisfaction, filled him with new apprehensions; for his reply was in a very quick stile, Son, said he, when I come into Germany, I promise you not to im∣portune you for any of your prisoners. This was so far from operating favourably in behalf of Lord Gray, that he was soon after more closely restrained, upon pretence of some private conversation he had with one of Lady Arabella's women, which proved after all to be no more than an amorous intrigue. These particulars we learn from a letter written by Mr. Chamberlaine to Sir Ralph Winwood, dated May 6, 1613, and he adds, <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">It is thought the Prince Palatine, went not away so well satisfied, being refused in diverse suits and requests: and I hear that from Canterbury he wrote to the Archbishop, complaining, <HI>That the King did not use him like a son, but rather like a young∣ling, or childish youth, not to he regarded.</HI></P>

The concern his majesty had shewn for removing Arminius first, and then Vorstius, had given their favourers in Holland so much uneasiness, that the famous Hugo Grotius, the great champion of their cause, was sent over to England, to endeavour to mitigate the King's displeasure, and if possible, to give him a better opinion of the Remonstrants, as they began then to be called; and we have a very singular account of the man, and of his negotiation, from the pen of the Archbishop<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Of the man, and of his negotiation, from the pen of the Arch∣bishop.</HI>] This is contained in a letter from his Grace to Sir R. Winwood, dated June 1, 1613, from Lambeth: it contains a great variety of curious particulars, some of which follow. <LETTER>
<P>You must take heed, how you trust Dr. Grotius too far, for I perceive him to be so addicted to some partialities in those parts, that he seareth not to lash, so it may serve a turn. At his first coming to the King, by reason of his good Latin tongue, he was so tedious, and full of tittle-tattle, that the King's judgment was of him, that he was some pedant, full of words, and of no great judgment. And I myself, dis∣covering that to be his habit, as if he did imagine that every man was bound to hear him, so long as he would talk, (which is a great burthen to men replete with business) did privately give him notice thereof, that he should plainly, and directly, deliver his mind, or else he would make the King weary of him. This did not so take place, but that afterwards he fell to it again, as was especially observed one night at supper at the Lord Bishop of Ely's, whither being brought by Mr. Ca∣sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bon, (as I think) my Lord intreated him to stay to supper, which he did. There was present Dr Steward, and another Civilian, unto whom he flings out some question of that pro∣fession, and was so full of words, that Dr Steward afterwards told my Lord, that he did perceive by him, that, like a smatterer, he had studied some two or three questions, where∣of when he came in company he must be talking to vin∣dicate his skill; but if he were put from those, he would shew himself but a simple fellow. There was present also, Dr Richardson, the King's professor of divinity in Cam∣bridge, and another Doctor in that faculty, with whom he falleth in also about some of those questions, which are now controverted among the ministers in Holland. And being matters wherein he was studied, he uttered all his skill con∣cerning them: my Lord of Ely sitting still at the supper all the while, and wondering what a man he had there, who never being in the place or company before, could over-whelm them so with talk for so long a time. I write this unto you so largely, that you may know the disposition of the man, and how kindly he used my Lord of Ely, for his good entertainment.—You will ask me what is this to you? I must tell you therefore, that you shall not be without your part. At the same time that Sir Noel Caron was together with Grotius, being now to take his leave of the King, it was desired of his majesty, that he would not hastily give his judgment con∣cerning points of religion, now in difference in Holland, for that his majesty had information but of one side, and that his Ambassador did deal partially, making all reports in favour of the one side, and saying nothing at all for the other. For he might have let his majesty know, how factious a generation these contradicters are; how they are like to our Puritans in England; how refractory they are to the author∣ity of the civil magistrate, and other things of like nature, as I wrote you in my former letter. I doubt not but Grotius had his part in this information, whereout I conceive you will make some use, keeping these things privately to your∣self, as becometh a man of your employment. When his majesty told me this, I gave such an answer as was sit; and now upon the receipt of your letters, shall upon the first occasion give further satisfaction. All things rest there as they did, and I, as ready to do you all good offices, remain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

In the spring of the year 1613, the affair of the Charterhouse was settled, and at the close of the month of June, his Grace, and the rest of the trus∣tees, took possession of that place, pursuant to the will of Mr. Sutton; and if this gave the Archbishop,
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
as no doubt it did, great satisfaction, an affair that happened about the same time, disturbed him not a little.</P>
<P>This was the famous case of divorce between the Lady Frances Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suf∣folk, and Robert, Earl of Essex, her husband; which has been always considered as one of the great∣est blemishes of King James's reign, though the part acted therein by the Archbishop of Canterbury, added much to the reputation he had already acqui∣red, for unshaken and incorruptible integrity.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Unshaken and incorruptible integrity.</HI>] This affair of the divorce, was by the King referred to a court of delegates, consisting of his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of London, Winchester, Coventry and Litchfield, and Rochester, Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Thomas Parrey, Sir Daniel Dunn, Dr John Bennet, Dr Francis James, and Dr Thomas Edwards. This affair was drawn out into a great length, and many accidents happened in the course of it, which gave the Archbishop infinite disquiet. He saw plainly, that the King was very desirous the Lady should be divorced, and, on the other hand, he was in his judgment directly against the di∣vorce. He laboured all he could to extricate himself from these difficulties, by having an end put to the cause some other way than by sentence, but it was to no purpose; for those who drove on this affair, had got too great power to be restrained from bringing it to the conclusion they desired. The Archbi∣shop was told, that a predecessor of his, which was Archbishop Grindall, had suffered about Dr. Julio's divorce, and so might he; but this, however, did not at all move him; on the con∣trary, he prepared a speech against the nullity of the marriage, which he intended to have spoken in the court at Lambeth, Sep∣tember 25, 1613, but he did not make use of that speech, be∣cause the King ordered them to deliver their opinions in few words. He continued, however, inflexible, with regard to his opinion, and therefore, when sentence was pronounced, the court was divided in the following manner.</P>

<P>To justify his conduct in this matter, the Archbishop drew up the reasons which induced him to be against the sentence, which King James thought fit to answer himself, and wrote also a letter to him upon that subject, in which there are some things that are very singular, and therefore worthy the reader's notice. <LETTER>
<P REND="margSglQuotes">After that I had fully perused and rightly considered of all your papers, I found your principles so strange, and your doubts so far sought, that I thought it necessary, as I have already said, to set down unto you my observations upon them. But to conclude my letter with that plainness that be∣cometh one of my quality; I must freely confess, that I find the grounds of your opposition so weak, as I have reason to apprehend, that the prejudice you have of the persons, is the greatest motive of breeding these doubts into you; which pre∣judice is the most dangerous thing that can fall in a Judge, for misleading of his mind. And the reason moving me to this apprehension, is partly grounded upon your last words to me at your parting from Windsor, and partly upon a line
scraped out in your paper of doubts, for I am sure you think me not so blunt a secretary, but that I can read a line so scra∣ped out. In your last speeches with me, you remember you told me, what assurance you had of the Earl's ability out of his own mouth, which you said you could not but trust, be∣cause he was so religious a nobleman. But when I told you of the other party's contrary affirmation, you remember how you used the word of iniquity, and how far your interlined line seems to have a harmony with this word, yourself can best judge. Now then if I would ask you what proof you have of the one's religion more than the other's, you must answer me by judging upon the exterior; and how deceivable that guess is, daily experience teaches us: but with a holy protestation, that I never knew any thing but good in the young Earl.

possibly leffen the King's favour to him in some res∣pects, but he still retained a great share of it, as ap∣pears by the raising his brother to the see of Salisbury, in the year 1615; but with Queen Anne, he stood always on the best terms possible, as we learn from himself, in a passage of a work of his transcribed in the following note.</P>
<P>He made use of his interest with her majesty, when all other applications had failed, to engage her to recommend Mr. George Villiers, so well known af∣terwards in the world, to his majesty's favour, for which at that time, the young man was so grateful as to call him father, and to desire his advice as to his behaviour, which the Archbishop very freely
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
gave him; and it had been very happy for him if he had always followed those councils<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>If he had always followed those councils.</HI>] We have this very remarkable passage from the Archbishop's own pen, in the discourse he wrote upon his disgrace, under the reign of King Charles. In that discourse he observes, that it was one of King James's maxims, to take no favourite but what was recommend∣ed to him by his Queen, that if she afterwards complained of this Dear One, he might answer, it is long of yourself, for you were the party that commended him unto me. Our old master, says the Archbishop, took delight strangely in things of this nature. He says that Queen Anne was graciously pleased to give him more credit than ordinary, and therefore when others had sollicited her in vain, he was applied to; but for some time her majesty would not listen to his persuasions, or think of re∣commending Villiers, for which she often gave him those rea∣sons. My Lord, you and the rest of your friends know not what you do, I know your master better than you all, for if this young man be once brought in, the first persons that he will plague must be you that labour for him, yea, I shall have my part alfo; the King will teach him to despise and hardly in∣treat us all, that he may seem to be beholden to none but him∣self. Noble Queen (cries out the Archbishop after reporting this fact) how like a prophetess did you speak! The rest of the story being but short will appear best in the Archbishop's own words, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In the end, says he, upon importunity, Queen Anne condescended, and so pressed it with the King, that he assented thereunto; which was so stricken while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roh was hot, that in the Queen's bed-chamber, the King knighted him with the rapier which the Prince did wear. And when the King gave order to swear him of the bed-chamber, Somerset, who was near, importuned the King with a message, that he might only be sworn a Groom;—but myself and others that were at the door, sent to her majesty that she would per∣fect her work, and cause him to be sworn a Gentleman of the chamber. There is a lord or two living that had a hand in this atchievement; I diminish nothing of their praise for so hap∣py a work, but I know my own part best; and on the word of an honest man, I have reported nothing but truth. George went in with the King, but no sooner he got loose, but he came forth unto me in the privy-gallery, and there em∣braced me: he professed that he was so infinitely bound unto me that all his life long he must honour me as his father. And now he did beseech me that I would give some lessons how he should carry himself. When he earnestly followed this chace, I told him I would give him three short lessons, if he would learn them. The first was, that daily upon his knees he should pray to God to bless the King his master, and to give him (George) grace studiously to serve and please him. The second was, that he should do all good offices be∣tween the King and the Queen, and between the King and the Prince. The third was, that he should fill his master's ears with nothing but truth. I made him repeat these three things unto me, and then I would have him to acquaint the King with them, and to tell me when I met him again, what the King said unto him. He promised me he would; and the morrow after, Mr. Thomas Murrey, the Prince's tutor, and I standing together in the gallery at Whitehall, Sir George Villiers coming forth and drawing to us, he told Mr Murrey how much he was beholden unto me, and that I had given him certain Instructions, which I prayed him to rehearse, as indifferently well he did before us; yea, and that he had acquainted the King with them, who said, they were instruct∣ions worthy of an Archbishop to give to a young man. His countenance of thankfulness for a few days continued, but not long, either to me or any other of his well-wishers.

Towards the close of the next year, the famous Antonio de Dominis, Archbishop of Spalato, took shelter here, from the persecution with which he was threatened by the Pope, for discovering his dislike both of the doctrine and discipline of the Church of Rome, and was very kindly received by his majesty, who was pleased to order the Archbishop to entertain him, which he did with generous hospitality, till he was otherways provided for by the King. His Grace

<P>In the spring of the year 1618, <HI>viz.</HI> on the second of March, our good Archbishop lost his brother the Bishop of Salisbury, and before his grief was well over for so near a relation, he met with fresh disturb∣ances from the King's declaration for permitting sports and pastimes on the Lord's day, which was dated at Greenwich, May 24, 1618<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The King's declaration for permitting sports and pastimes.</HI>] The declaration runs thus, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That for his good people's lawful recreations his pleasure was, that after the end of Divine Service, they should not be disturbed, letted, or discouraged, from any lawful recreations: such as dancing, either men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreations: nor from having of May-games, Whitsun-ales, or morrice-dances, and setting up of May-poles, or other sports therewith used; so as the same be had in due and convenient time, without impediment or let of Divine Service: and that women should have leave to carry rushes to the church, for the decoring of it, according to their old custom: withal prohibiting all unlawful Games to be used on the Sundays only, as bear-baiting, bull-baiting, enterludes, and at all times, in the meaner sort of people, by law pro∣hibited, bowling.'</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This declaration was ordered to be read in church∣es, and the Archbishop being accidentally at Croy∣don in Surrey when it came thither, had the courage to forbid it's being read, which however the King winked at, notwithstanding there were some about him, who let no opportunity slip of irritating him against this prelate.</P>
<P>The council of Dort set this year, to which were sent from hence in the beginning of the month of

October four commissioners, and amongst them Dr Hall, Dean of Winchester, with whose health the climate of Holland disagreeing, he returned, and Dr Goad, the Archbishop's chaplain, was sent in his place.</P>
<P>The end of this year proved as disagreable to the Archbishop as it's beginning; in Autumn, the Queen, his gracious mistress, falling ill of that dis∣temper, which, after a tedious sickness, brought her to her end on the first of March following.</P>
<P>The Archbishop himself began also to grow in∣firm, and finding himself less fit for the affairs of the world than he had been, resolved, while he had still strength, to enter upon a great and good design, which he had long meditated as a testimony of affection to his native town of Guildford, where on the fifth of April, 1619, he laid the first stone of his hospital, and afterwards nobly endowed it; a par∣ticular account of which will be given.</P>
<P>It was towards the end of this year, that the Elector Palatine accepted of the crown of Bohemia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasioned great disputes in King James's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some desiring that his majesty should not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in this matter at all, from a foresight that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t would produce a war in Germany; others again believing that both natural affection to his son and daughter, and a just concern for the Protestant in∣terest, ought to have engaged his majesty warmly to support the new election.

<OPENER><SALUTE>To Secretary NAUNTON.</SALUTE><SALUTE>Good Mr. Secretary,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE never more desired to be present at any consult∣ation, than that which is this day to be handled, for my heart and all my heart goeth with it; but my foot is worse than it was on Friday, so that by advice of my physician I have sweat this whole night past, and am directed to keep my bed this day.</P>
<P>But for the matter; my humble advice is, that there is no going back, but a countenancing of it against all the world; yea so far as with ringing of bells and making of bonsires in London, so soon as it shall be certainly understood, that the coronation is past, I am satisfied in my conscience that the cause is just, wherefore they have rejected that proud and bloody man; and so much the rather, because he hath taken a course to make that kingdom not elective, but to take it from the donation of another man. And when God hath set up the Prince that is chosen to be a mark of honour thro' all Christendom, to propagate his gospel, and to protect the op∣pressed, I dare not for my part give advice, but to follow where God leads.</P>
<P>It is a great honour to the King our Master, that he hath such a son, whose virtues have made him thought fit to be made a King. And methinks I do in this and that of <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> foresee the works of God, that by piece and piece the kings of the earth that gave their power unto the beast (all the word of God must be fulfilled) shall now tear the whore and make her desolate, as St. John in his Revel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion has s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retold. I pray you therefore, with all the spirits you have to put life into this business; and let a return be made into <HI>Germany</HI> with speed, and with com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, and let it be really prosecuted, that it may appear to the world, that we are awake when God in this sort calleth us.</P>
<P>If I had time to express it, I could be very angry at the shuffling which was used towards my Lord Doncaster, and the slighting of his embassage so, which cannot but touch upon our great master who did send him; and therefore I would never have a noble son forsaken for respect of them, who truly aim at nothing but their own purposes.</P>
<P>Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>triking in will comfort the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> will honour the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave,</HI> will strengthen the union, will bring on the States of the Low-Countries, will stir up the King of Denmark, and move his own uncles, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Duke <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bouv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> together with <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ville</HI> (a rich Prince in <HI>France</HI>) to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in their shares; and <HI>Hungary,</HI> as I hope, (being in that same cause) will run the same fortune. For the means to support the war I hope <HI>providebit Deus:</HI> the parliament is the old and honourable way, but how assured at this time I know not; yet I will hope the best: certainly if countenance be given to the action, many brave spirits will voluntarily go. Our great master, in sufficient want of money, gave some aid to the Duke of <HI>Sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> and furnished out a pretty army in the cause of <HI>Cleve.</HI> We must try once again what can be done in this business of a higher nature, and all the money that may be spared is to be turned that way. And perhaps God provided the jewels that were laid up in the Tower, to be gathered by the mother for the preservation of her daughter: who, like a noble Princess, hath professed to her husb∣and, not to leave herself one jewel, rather than not to main∣tain so religious and righteous a cause. You see that lying on my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d I have gone too far; but if I were with you this should be my language, which I pray you humbly and heart∣ily re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent to the King, my master, telling him, that when I can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd, I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o do his majesty some service herein.

The next year was in a great measure spent in de∣bates
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
and negotiations upon this subject, in which the King took a great deal of pains with little effect.</P>
<P>The Archbishop's declining state of health, ma∣king exercise a thing not only convenient but necess∣ary for him, he was wont in the summer to make a tour into Hampshire for the sake of recreation, and being invited by the Lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzil upon the edge of Berkshire, and not far from Hartford Bridge, his Grace met there with the greatest misfortune that befel him in the whole course of his life; for hunting in this park on the twenty∣fourth of July, he let fly a barbed arrow from a cross-bow at one of the deer; which unfortunately struck one Peter Hawkins, my Lord Zouch's keep∣er, who was quite out of the Bishop's sight, and had been warned more than once to keep out of the way, in the left arm, by which wound a large blood-ves∣sel being pierced, he bled to death in an hour's time. This unforeseen accident threw the Archbishop into a deep melancholy, tho' he was not conscious to him∣self of the least inadvertency or indiscretion, neither did this wear off in time, but throughout his whole life he observed a monthly fast on a Tuesday, the day on which this fatal mischance fell out, and settled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow, which soon procured her another husband.</P>
<P>This affair made a very great noise, and there wanted not some to represent it in a sinister light to King James, but his majesty gave his judgment of matter in a short and clear sentence, <HI>An angel,</HI> said he, <HI>might have miscarried in this sort.</HI> When he was afterwards informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident, he wrote him a consolatory letter with his own hand, in which a∣mongst
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
other things he told him, that <HI>he would not add affliction to his sorrow, or take one farthing from his chattels or moveables which were forfeited by law.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbishop immediately on this misfortune retired to his own hospital at Guildford, there to wait the decision of the great point as to the irregu∣larity, which some imagined he had incurred, for it happened very unluckily that at this juncture, there were four Bishops elected but not consecrated, <HI>viz.</HI> Dr John Williams, lord keeper of the great seal, to the see of Lincoln; Dr John Davenant, to that of Salisbury; Dr Valentine Cary, to that of Exeter; and his old antagonist Dr William Laud, whose preferment, on this occasion, he had warmly oppo∣sed, to that of St David's; and all, except Dr Da∣venant, scrupled the Archbishop's capacity to lay hands on them till he was cleared from all imputa∣tion as to this fact. The King being informed of this, directed, in the beginning of October follow∣ing, a commission to the ten following persons, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord Keeper; the Bishops of London, Winch∣ester, and Rochester; the Elects of Exeter and St Davids; Sir Henry Hobart, Lord Chief Justice of the common pleas; Sir John Dodderidge, one of the justices of the King's bench; Sir Henry Mar∣tin, Dean of the Arches; and Dr. Steward; to consider and resolve the three following questions. 1. <HI>Whether the Archbishop was irregular by the fact of involuntary bomicide?</HI> The Bishop of Winchester, the two Judges, and the two Civilians, were very clear that he was not irregular; the other five thought he he was. 2. <HI>Whether that act might tend to scandal in a churchman?</HI> The Bishop of Winchester, the Lord Chief Justice Hobart, and Dr Steward, doubted; all the rest agreed, that a scandal might be taken tho'
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
not given. 3. <HI>How his Grace should be restored, in case the King should follow the decision of those commission∣ers, who had found him irregular?</HI> All agreed that it could not be otherwise done than by restitution from the King, but they varied in the manner. The Bishop of Winchester, the Lord Chief Justice, and Dr Steward, thought it should be done by the King, and by him alone, in the same patent with the par∣don. The Lord Keeper, and the Bishops of Lond∣on, Rochester, Exeter, and St David's, were for a commission from the King directed to some Bishops. Judge Dodderidge, and Sir Henry Martin, were desirous it should be done both ways, for abundant caution. This return was made to his majesty on the tenth of November 1621, and accordingly a pardon and a dispensation both bearing date at West∣minster, the twenty-second of November, passed the great seal, by which his majesty assoiled the Arch∣bishop from all irregularity, scandal, or infamation, (if any was incurred) and declared him capable of all metropolitical authority, as if this accident had never happened. Such was the close of this business, after a great variety of proceedings, and many ar∣guments published on both sides<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>And many arguments published on both sides.</HI>] As the case was absolutely new, and such a one as naturally afforded room for talkative and busy men to display their abilities; there was nothing surprizing in the noise this accident made, or the vari∣ous constructions put upon it by different people, according as their notions or their prejudices led them. The Archbishop being sensible of all this, either wrote himself, which is most probable, or caused to be written, a very short piece under this title, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'An apology for Archbishop Abbot, touching the death of Peter Hawkins, the Keeper, wounded in the park at Bramzil, July 24, 1621, by an unknown hand.'</Q> It was sent on the eighth of October 1621 to Sir Henry Spelman, who, on t e nineteenth of the same month, returned an answer to it, which discovers full as much severity as learning.

Hacket] that the fact was much discoursed of in foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, especially amongst our neighbours the Sorbonnists, who disputed it three several times in their schools, and concluded the accident to have amounted to a full irregula∣rity, which is an incapacity to exercise any ecclesiastical act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Yet all this could not satisfy the minds of those who had scrupled the power of laying on hands, and therefore they petitioned the King, that they might not be compelled to wound their consciences by sub∣mitting to such a consecration; and, in compliance with their desire, the Bishop of Lincoln was conse∣crated in King Henry VII's chapel, on the eleventh of November, by the Bishops of London, Wor∣cester, Ely, Oxford, and Llandaff; and the Bish∣ops of Sarum, Exeter, and St David's, in the chapel of the Bishop of London's palace, on the eighteenth of November, by the same reverend Prelates.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that his Grace was at all lessened, by the suggestions of his enemies, in the King's favour, or his courage in any degree abated, by the troubles he had met with<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in any degree abated, by the troubles he had met with.</HI>] Bishop Hacket, in his Life of Archbishop Wil∣liams, p. 68. says, the Archbishop was wont to dissent from the King as often as any at the council board, and that his Majesty loved him the better for his courage and sincerity.</NOTE>.

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been too long silent, and am afraid, by my silence, I have neglected the duty of the place it hath pleased God to call me unto, and your Majesty to place me in: but now I humbly crave leave, I may discharge my conscience towards God, and my duty to your Majesty; and therefore I beseech you freely to give me leave to deliver myself, and then let your Majesty do with me what you please. Your Majesty hath propounded a Toleration of religion, I beseech you to take into your consideration what your act is, what the consequence may be; by your act, you labour to set up the most damnable and heretical doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Whore of <HI>Babylon.</HI> How hateful it will be to God, and grievous to your good subjects, the professors of the Gospel, that your Majesty who hath often disputed, and learnedly written against those heresies, should now shew yourself a Patron of those wicked doctrines, which your pen hath told the world, and your conscience tells yourself, are superstiti∣ous, idolatrous, and detestable. And hereunto I add what you have done, in sending the Prince into Spain, without consent of your council, the privity and approbation of your people; and although you have a charge and interest in the Prince, as son of your flesh, yet have the people a greater, as son of this kingdom, upon whom, (next after your Majesty) are their eyes fixed, and welfare depends; and so tenderly is his going apprehended, as (believe it) however his return may be safe, yet the drawers of him into this action, so dangerous to himself, so desperate to the kingdom, will not pass away unquestioned, unpunished. Besides, this Toleration which you endeavour to set up by your proclama∣tion, cannot be done without a parliament; unless your Ma∣jesty will let your subjects see, that you will take unto your∣self, ability to throw down the laws of your land at your pleasure. What dreadful consequences these things may draw afterward, I beseech your Majesty to consider, and a∣bove all, lest by this Toleration, and discountenancing of the true profession of the Gospel, wherewith God hath blessed us. and this kingdom hath so long slourished under it, your Majesty do not draw upon this kingdom in general, and yourself in particular, God's heavy wrath and indignation.</P>
<P>Thus in discharge of my duty towards God, to your Ma∣justy, and the place of my calling, I have taken humble leave to deliver my conscience. Now, Sir, do what you please with me. </P>

<P>This letter is likewise printed by Arthur Willson in his hist∣ory, with this re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lection, both on the King and the Archbishop. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Thus did our Solomon in his latter time, (though he had fought with beasts at Ephesus, as one saith of him) incline a little too much to the Beast: yet he made his tale so good to the Archbishop of Canterbury, (what reservations soever he had) that he wrought upon the good old man, (afterwards) in conclusion of the work, to set his hand as a witness to the articles.'</Q> Upon this, another historian of the same reign [S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderson] takes upon him to insinuate, that this long letter to the King, was penned to please his disciples, and copies given to publish in print after his decease; for, says he, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd doings of it till now, in our last days; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'for Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, was the first man that signed to the postcript, which attested those articles of the marriage, and so did all the privy council.'</Q> Then speaking of the excuse made by Mr Willson, for the Archbishop, this writer adds, <HI>I can tell him there were two other Bishops, John, Bishop of Lincoln, and Lancelot, Bishop of Win∣chester, men of far greater merit, and high esteem, and evener conscience, that subsigned with him.</HI> But in this fact he is mist∣aken, for Lancelot, Bishop of Winchester, did not sign, more willingly than the Archbishop. The apology of the other historian was also unnecessary, for the articles which the Arch∣bishop apprehended, and wrote against, were private articles, as appears plainly from the whole transaction printed in Rush∣worth's collection, vol. I, p. 85,—101. But another great writer, [Heylin] gives quite another turn to this whole affair, for he owns that the letter came abroad, not in these last times, as Sanderson calls them, but at the very time it was supposed to be written, yet he denies that the Archbishop was the author of it, and suggests, that it was only fathered upon him, that it might make the greater impression upon the people.</P></NOTE>. The King however remained
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
fixed in his resolution, and the articles agreed on for
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
the said marriage, were sworn to, in the presence of the Archbishop, and other great officers of state, notwithstanding which they never took effect.</P>
<P>The Archbishop thenceforward assisted but seldom at council, being hindered chiefly by his infirmities, but in the King's last sickness he was called for, and attended with great constancy, and received the highest marks of the King's confidence, to the very last moment of his life, and was near him when he expired, on the twenty-seventh of March 1625.</P>
<P>At the coronation of King Charles I, the Arch∣bishop, as his office required, set the crown upon his majesty's head, tho' he was extremely weak, and much troubled with the gout, but thenceforward he visibly declined in the King's favour, and the Duke of Buckingham, who was his declared enemy, watched for an opportunity to make the Archbishop
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
feel the weight of his displeasure.</P>
<P>This was at last taken, for his refusing to license a sermon, preached by one Dr Sibthorpe, Vicar of Brackley in Northamptonshire, to justify and pro∣mote a loan, which the King had demanded. This sermon was preached at Northampton, in the Lent assizes 1627 before the Judges at Northampton, and it was transmitted to the Bishop, with the King's directi∣on, to license it, which he refused to do, and gave his reasons for it; notwithstanding which, the sermon was licensed by the Bishop of London, (Dr Moun∣taigne) after many things had been corrected therein, from the lights given by the Archbishop's objections, for which however it was resolved that he should suffer. Discourses of this nature were so loud at court, that some of his Grace's friends overheard and reported them to him, upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at Croydon; a month before his usual time. On the fifth of July, Lord Con∣way, who was then Secretary of State, made him a visit, and intimated to him, that the King expected he should withdraw to Canterbury, which the Arch∣bishop declined, because he had a law-suit at that time with that city, and desired he might rather have leave to go to his house at Ford, five miles beyond Canterbury, which was yielded to; and on the ninth of October following, the King granted a commission to the Bishops of London, Durham, Rochester, Oxford, and Bath and Wells, to execute archiepiscopal authority, the cause assigned being no more than this, <HI>That the Archbishop could not at that time, in his own person, attend those services, which were otherwise proper for his cognizance and jurisdiction.</HI> Some writers have pretended, that his supposed irre∣gularity, occasioned by the Death of Peter Hawkins,
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
was revived; but the commission which is extant on record shews the contrary, nor indeed was that affair ever thought of afterwards; but the Archbishop did not remain long in this situation, for the necessities of the times rendering a parliament necessary, his Grace was sent for about Christmas, and not only restored to his authority aad jurisdiction, but, on his coming to court from his palace at Lambeth, was received when he quitted his barge, by the Archbishop of York and the Earl of Dorset, who conducted him to his majesty, where, having kissed the King's hand, he was desired not to fail the coun∣cil chamber twice a week. His Grace sat in that parliament which began on the seventeenth of March following, and continued in the full exercise of his office ever after, of which it may not be amiss to take notice in this single instance. On the twenty-fourth of August 1628, he consecrated Richard Montagu, to the see of Chichester, a man who had been remarkably busy in supporting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pretence of his irregularity, and at this consecration Dr Laud, then Bishop of London, assisted, which is the clearest proof that can be, that no doubts stuck longer as to his irregularity, even with those who loved him least.</P>
<P>In parliament, the Archbishop maintained his credit in as high a degree as any of his predecessors, and it is more than probable, that the knowledge of this procured him such marks of respect, as were at this time afforded him by the court. When the Petition of Right, that great pillar of the English liberty, was under consideration, the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury delivered the sense of the house of Lords thereupon, at a conference with the house of Commons, and at the same time, laid

before them such propositions as their Lordships had agreed upon, for which, thanks were returned, in set speech, by Sir Dudley Diggs.</P>
<P>The interest of Bishop Laud was now so great at court, that he drew up a scheme of instructions, which having the King's name at the head of them, were, in the month of December, 1629, transmitted to his Grace, under the pompous title, <HI>His Majesty's instructions to the most reverend father in God, George, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, containing certain orders to be observed and put in execution, by the several Bishops in his province.</HI> These instructions his Grace com∣municated to his suffragan Bishops, in which, as Heylin observes, he acted <HI>ministerially;</HI> but to shew that he still meant to exercise his own authority in his own diocese, he restored Mr Palmer and Mr Udnay to their lectureships, after the Dean and Archdeacon of Canterbury had suspended them; and, in other respects, softened the rigour of those instructions, which were contrived to enforce the particular no∣tions of a prevailing party in the Church, which the Archbishop thought a burden too hard to be borne by the tender consciences of those who made the fundamentals of religion their study, and were not so zealous for forms.</P>
<P>His conduct in this and other respects, is said to have made his presence unwelcome at court, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o indeed it seems to have been, for upon the birth of Charles, Prince of Wales, (afterwards King Charles II,) which happened on the 29th of May, 1630, Laud, then Bishop of London, had the honour to baptize him as D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an of the chapel, notwithstanding that the Archbishop of Canterbury is the Ordinary of the court, and the King's houshold, wherever it is, are regarded as his parishioners; so this was
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
visibly as much a slight upon the Archbishop, as an act of favour towards his antagonist.</P>
<P>The Archbishop however was proof against all such accidents as these, and went on doing his duty without fear or favour, and yet one of the last acts of his life plainly shews, that he was very far from being so indifferent towards the discipline and cere∣monies of the Church of England, as some have represented him. This act of his was an order dated the third of July 1633, requiring the parish∣ioners of Crayford in Kent, to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, on their knees, at the steps ascending to the communion table.</P>
<P>We may well stile this one of his last acts, since a month a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terwards, <HI>viz.</HI> on the fourth of August in the same year, he deceased at his palace of Croydon, worn out with cares and infirmities, at the age of seventy-one.</P>
<P>He was buried according to his own express direction, in the chapel of our Lady, within the church dedicated to the holy Trinity, in his native town of Guildford in Surrey. Soon after his de∣cease, a noble monument was erected over his grave with the effigies of the Archbishop in his Episcopal robes, and over that his Parliament Robes, in white marble, lying under the Arch supported by six black marble pillars of the Dorick Order, raised on pedestals of books piled up. In niches, at the East end of the Monument, are two figures, over their heads, thus, <HI>Hinc Lumen</HI> [<HI>Hence Light</HI>], <HI>Hic Gratia</HI> [<HI>Here Grace</HI>].

The general historians of those times ran much into writing of characters, and that which Hammond l'Estrange bestowed upon the Archbishop, has been copied into various works. Dr. Heylin, in his life of Abp. Laud, makes use of it to express what he did not care should fall from his own pen, though upon other occasions, he has treated this writer in his history very freely. Lloyd, in his State Worthies, has copied that character without naming his author,
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
and to say the truth, it is from thence, that most of the strokes of satire bestowed upon the memory of this great man have been stolen; [see the notes [<HI>q</HI>] and [<HI>r</HI>] and yet how little suitable that character is to the person for whom it was drawn, the reader will easily perceive from the piece itself<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>From the piece itself.</HI>] The historian writes thus. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Not long after his return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> aged and self-fear, <HI>George Abb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> the titular Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> went to his everlasting home, <HI>August</HI> 4.

This was the height of what I dare report his failings reached to: that he was a ringleader of that sect which lately appeared desperate proselytes, loth I am with a late author [Sanderson] to affirm, warrant I have none to leave so ill a savour upon his fame, nor can it be infallibly inferred from these men, their being then in favour with him.

<P>His charity and publick spirit ought certainly to have been set in a clearer light, than hitherto they have been, by the friends to the Church; the rather, because a writer, remarkable for his keenness, [Heylin] has been pleased to assert, that <HI>marks of his∣benesaction we find none, in places of his breeding and preferment;</HI> which is at once an unjust and unchristi∣an aspersion, as will be made appear<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>As will be made appear.</HI>] The Archbishop loved hospi∣lity, and living as became a man of his rank, he tells us himself, in his narrative, that this was recommended to him by King James, and that he never forgot his majesty's in∣junctions upon that head, neither is it the Archbishop alone that mentions this, but even some who did not wish him very well, and who plainly intimate, that among the rest of his faults, he was thought to live too high, to have too much company, and to become thereby too popular. <HI>Life of Abp.

This hospitality of his, together with the troubles he met with, must have hindered him from growing rich, and consequently, put it in some measure out of his power to shew his publick spirit in other respects, how much soever it might be his inclination. Yet some instances we find of his generosity in this way, at least enough to falsify Heylin's reflection; for besides his noble and well-contrived charity at Guildford, he gave to the school of arts in Oxford, one hundred pounds at one time, and fifty pounds at another. In 1619, he bestowed a large sum of money on the library of Baliol college, for augmenting the number of books, and re∣pairing the building. He built a fair conduit in the city of Canterbury, for the convenience of the inhabitants. He like∣wise intended to have left a yearly revenue for the support of that conduit, if he had not been deterred by the ungratesul usage he met with from the Mayor and corporation, as may be seen in the will. In 1624, he contributed to the founding of Pembroke college in Oxford. He discharged a debt of three hundred pounds owing from Baliol to Pembroke College. About the year 1632, he gave one hundred pounds to the library of University college. For the other, see the Arch∣bishop's will.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THAT worthy Prelate did surely deserve a better representation to posterity. He was a very wise and prudent man, knew well the temper and disposition of the kingdom with respect to the ceremonies and power of the church, and did there∣fore use a moderation in the point of ecclesiastical discipline, which if it had been followed by his successor, the ruin that soon after fell on the church might very likely have been prevented. His being without any credit at court from the latter end of King James's reign will bring no dishonour on his memory, if it be consider'd that his disgrace arose from his dislike of, and opposition to the imprudent and corrupt measures of the court at that time, and from an honest zeal for the laws and liberties of his country which seem'd then to be in no small dan∣ger, and it was a part truly becoming the high station he then bore. His advice upon the affair
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
of the Palatinate and the Spanish match shewed his knowledge of the true interest of England, and how much it was at his heart; and his behaviour and sufferings in the next reign about the loan and Sibthorp's sermon as they were the reasons of his disgrace at that time, so ought they to render his memory valuable to all who wish not to see the fatal counsels and the oppression of those times revived in this nation. The Duke of Buckingham was his enemy because the Archbishop would not be his creature, and the church perhaps might have been thought to have been better govern'd, if he had stooped to the Duke and given in to the wantonnesses of his power: but he knew the dignity of his cha∣racter, and loved his country too well to submit to such a meanness, tho' very few of his brethren had the courage or honesty to join with him in this, and if the Archbishop himself is to be credited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide his Narrative.</NOTE>, his successor's rise was by the practice of those arts this good man could not bend to. As to his learning we need no better testimony of it than his promotion by King James, who had too much affectation that way to prefer any one to such a station who had not borne the reputation of a scholar; but there are other proofs of his sufficiency in this, even for the high place he held in the church. If he had some narrow notions in divinity, they were rather the faults of the age he had his education in, than his, and the same imputation may be laid on the best and most learned of the reformers. His warmth against popery became the office of a Protestant Bi∣shop;
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
tho' even towards Papists there is a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rushworth's Collections, vol. 1st. page 243.</NOTE> remark∣able instance of his mildness and charity, which shewed that his zeal against their persons went no farther than the safety of the state required. His parts seem to have been strong and masterly, his preaching grave and eloquent, and his stile equal to any of that time. He was eminent for piety and a care for the poor, and his hospitality fully answer'd the injunction King James laid on him, which was to carry his house nobly, and to live like an Arch∣bishop. He had no thoughts of heaping up riches; what he did save was laid out by him in the erecting and endowing of an handsome Hospital for decay'd tradesmen, and the widows of such, in the town of Guildford in the county of Surrey, where he was born and had his first education; and here I cannot omit taking notice that the body of Statutes drawn by himself for the government of that house, is one of the most judicious works of that kind I ever saw, and under which for near one hundred years that Hospital has main∣tain'd the best credit of any that I know in Eng∣land. He was void of all pomp and ostentation, and thought the nearer the church and church-men came to the simplicity of the first christians, the better would the true ends of religion be served, and that the purity of the heart was to be preferred to, and ought rather to be the care of a spiritual go∣vernor, than the devotion of the hands only. If under this notion some niceties in discipline were given up to goodness of life, and when the peace of the church as well as of the kingdom was preserved
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
by it, 'twas surely no ill piece of prudence, nor is his memory therefore deserving of those slanders it has undergone upon that account. It is easy to see that much of this treatment has been owing to a belief in the admirers and followers of Archbishop Laud, that the reputation of the latter was encreased by depreciating that of the former. They were in∣deed men of very different frames and the parts they took in the affairs both of church and state as difa∣greeing. In the church, moderation and the ways of peace guided the behaviour of the first, rigour and severity that of the last. In the state they se∣verally carried the like principles and temper. The one made the liberty of the people and the laws of the land the measure of his actions, when the other, to speak softly of it, had the power of the Prince and the exalting the prerogative only, for the found∣ation of his. They were indeed both of 'em men of courage and resolution; but it was sedate and temperate in Abbot, passionate and unruly in Laud. It is not however to be denied that many rare and excellent virtues were possessed by the latter; but it must be owned too, he seems rather made for the hierarchy of another church and to be the minister of an arbitrary Prince, and the other to have had the qualifications of a Protestant Bishop and the guardian of a free state. Thus much I thought was due to the character of this good man, not only for the sake of justice, but as an offering of gratitude to his memory for the great and lasting obligations the town of Guildford (to which I have some re∣lation) lies under to him. And what I have here said of him I am amply justified in, from several

accounts delivered down of him, from letters and other pieces of his own in Rushworth's Collections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1.</NOTE>, and from the Statutes of his hospital before-men∣tioned, and other memorials of his worth which are there preserved.</P>

<HEAD>THE WILL OF <HI>GEORGE ABBOT,</HI> Late Lord Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> 1632.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Name of Almighty God from whom a∣lone cometh my help, I George Abbot by the Providence of God Archbishop of Canterbury, considering with myself the certaintie of that decree that it is appointed for all men to die once, and weighing the uncertainty of that hour when my Lord and Great Master will call for me, being now in reasonable health and perfect memory, I praise God for the same, and being willing to dispose of myself, and of that small portion of wealth which the Lord in mercy hath lent unto me, do make this my last Will and Testament as followeth.</P>
<P>FIRST, I do thank the God of Heaven and Earth, for bringing me from meaner estate to a place of some note in his church, which by his mercy and unspeakable goodness I have laboured to discharge to my power in simplicity of conscience, having ever in my memory that great and last day of ac∣compt, when all mens bodies shall stand before that
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
tribunal of Christ, and in the mean while not for∣getting that saying of the Prophet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxvi. v. 11.</NOTE>, <HI>Quid retribuam Domino?</HI> because in so many troubles as this in∣constant world doth afford his Divine Majesty did ever protect and uphold me, and so I trust that high and great God will out of his incomprehensible love do unto the end. Then I commend my soul unto the blessed Trinity, the Father who created it, the Son who redeemed it, the Holy Ghost who in some measure hath sanctified it, beseeching that God in Trinity and the same Trinity in Unity to receive it into the kingdom of heaven there to reign for ever for Jesus Christ's sake, by whose death and bitter passion only which that unspotted and inno∣cent lamb did suffer for the sins of the world, I stedfastly hope to have full and free remission of all my offences, according to the truth of the gospel now by his great mercy published in this famous Church of England, which I hold to be the best framed pattern of all the Churches in Europe, and according to the doctrine which in my life-time for full forty years together (when I write this) I have taught in my preaching and maintained in my wri∣ting, and in the verity whereof (because it is groun∣ded upon the sacred scriptures of the old and new Testament) I hope to appear with chearfulness and confidence before the throne of God.</P>
<P>I commend my body to the earth in assured hope of a joyful resurrection, desiring to be buried in the Trinity Church at Guildford which is near unto my Hospital, that in the same town where my flesh had the beginning thereof, it may rest as the <HI>depo∣situm</HI> of my love to that place; but I leave all
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
circumstances of my interring and funeral to the judgment and discretion of mine Executors.</P>
<P>I give to the Poor of the parish of Lambeth thirty pounds; and to the Poor of the parish of Croydon twenty pounds; both these sums to be disposed according to the discretion of mine Execu∣tors, and if it may be it is best that they should be directed to some permanent use.</P>
<P>I have heretofore given to the Mayor and his Brethren at Guildford one hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Letter to the Corporation of <HI>Guildford.</HI></NOTE>, which sum is in their hands, or at least in their disposing, I declared it so at first and my desire is that it should be preserved to a perpetual use, to be lent by five and twenty pounds a man to four several tradesmen in that town, to set poor men on work; I would not have these sums to be lent but upon good se∣curity, and to hold for two or three years at the most, without any interest or consideration (saving paying for making the bonds) and then to be lent from time to time to other traders there, with this proviso upon the bonds that if any of the borrow∣ers to die before the end of the term for which the money is lent, that the sum be repayed or delivered back to the Mayor and his Brethren within three months after his decease.</P>
<P>To him whosoever shall succeed me in the Arch∣bishoprick I give all the pictures and maps now hanging in the gallery at Lambeth, together with my barge, praying him not to grieve my Executors for dilapidations, since it appeareth to the world how careful I have been in repairing all the houses belonging to the See of Canterbury, beyond that which my predecessors have done in the memory of

man, and that I have bestowed divers thousands of pounds upon the same, as may well be seen by books of accounts truly kept concerning those expences, besides the care which to my great charge I have had for the preservation of the woods of the Arch∣bishoprick standing in Kent and Surrey, which I have so spared beyond my predecessors, that I have bought timber to the value of some hundreds of pounds to repair my houses, because I would not cut young trees, but let them grow up to the benefit of my succcessors; and being now fair I leave it hum∣bly to his Majesty's consideration, whether it be not fit that my successor and successors to enter good bond into the exchequer not to cut any timber, saving for necessary reparations of his own houses, which was the course holden in Queen Elizabeth's days especially for the Bishoprick of Winchester, and not unfit elsewhere to be followed. I have many books in the great study or library at Lambeth marked with these two letters G C, I bequeath those to that library to the use of the Archbishops of Canterbury in succession; and I appoint that a catalogue should be made of them, and sent to the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral church in Cant∣erbury to be there kept, and a transc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipt or copy thereof to remain in the library at Lambeth; the cost of this I leave to my Executors, but pray Mr. Baker my secretary to take some pains therein for that which shall remain unperfected by me, which I hope shall not be much, yet in that which shall be I would have Mr. Baker to take the advice of my hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hold chaplains being with me in house at the time of my death; and because I am not ignorant that by falsehood, cavils in law, or some negligence, not only those books given by me, but those which

were left by my Lord Bancroft may be diverted from the use of my successors, and so this great and good work be frustrated, as far as in me lieth I do in the name of that dreadful and Almighty God, who is the rewarder of all men's deservings be they good or be they evil, lay it upon the soul and conscience of him and them that shall succeed me in this Arch∣bishoprick, that to the best of their power by all means they keep that library and all the books safe as I have done, and I pray God to bless all them that have that good mind, and to divert and hinder all those that have any intendment to the contrary, and this I pray not only for and concerning my suc∣cessors but all other persons whatsoever,</P>
<P>My next general care is of my servants among whom I do not know any unhonest or unworthy man, my will for them is that my houshold should by my Executors be kept together at my charge for the space of one month after my decease, that men may have some time to dispose of themselves. And to begin with the poorest; I do give two hundred pounds to be divided by my Executors unto forty yeomen or inferior of my servants by five pounds a year. And I give forty pounds more to supply any forgetfulness of mine towards such as have served me; or if the sum beforenamed do not hold out, those last moneys to be disposed by the discretion of mine Executors towards gentlemen or yeomen where they shall see fit, and according to what proportion they shall hold most convenient; those to whom I give particular legacies are to have none of this two hundred and the forty pounds, but my servan s at Croydon are to be taken in. To such gentlemen
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
as at the time of my death shall serve me in house, and have no portions or named legacies, I give to each of them a gold ring to the value of forty shil∣lings to wear in remembrance of me. And I in∣treat my successor whosoever he shall be to enter∣tain so many of my servants as he shall need, assu∣ring him that he can not have more honest and serviceable persons to attend him.</P>
<P>To Sir Edmond Scott I give my little silver clock, and a trencher salt of gold without a cover, which remaineth among my plate, and this he must re∣ceive as a memorial of my love, because otherwise by my means he is not ill provided for, although if if it were more he is worthy of it.</P>
<P>To Mr. Richard Brigham, the controller of my house, I give my four coach mares, and one hundred pounds in money, he knoweth that I have not been altogether forgetful of him in my life-time, but all that I have done is too little, because his faithful∣ness, diligence, and discretion hath been such in serving me that my estate by his means hath been the better within doors and without.</P>
<P>To my two chaplains attending me in mine house I give my pictures and maps in the gallery at Croy∣don, to be divided between them; and to each of them a ring of gold of forty shillings. And such another ring I give to my chaplain Master Edward Abbott of Loarkin.</P>
<P>To my secretary Master William Baker, as honest a man as ever served any master, I give my gold ring with the table diamond to wear in remembrance of me, praying him to take some pains to perfect up the catalogue of my books given to the library at Lambeth, that it may orderly appear to posterity what I have left there, according to the care that I
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
did take for the books left by my predecessour the Lord Bancroft the founder and first beginner of that library; I give him also the great inlayed cabinet of wood standing in the Queen's chamber at Lambeth, the keys whereof lie in the old desk which standeth in the study, which is next to the closet near the chapel.</P>
<P>To Master Richard Line I bequeath my lesser gold chain, and twenty pounds of money if he owe me so much at the time of my death; I have done something for him in my life-time according to my ability, and it may fall out that I may do more.</P>
<P>To Master William Sherman I give a gold ring with a turtoyse in it which I have ready lying by me, and a piece of gilt plate of thirty ounces, I have not altogether forgotten him heretofore in some other matters.</P>
<P>To honest John Goodwyn I give one hundred marks in money, and my big clock which useth commonly to stand in my chamber; I have much desired to leave him some office or matter of con∣tinuance, but God hitherto hath not offered me the means to do it according to my desire.</P>
<P>To Ralph Watts who long hath served me pain∣fully and diligently I give also one hundred marks in money, and a gold ring with a turkoise in it; I have done something for him besides, but I wish it were much more.</P>
<P>To Walter Dobson my receiver, and the receiver of the archbishoprick, I give twenty pounds, and the ring with the West-Indian sapphire which I have used to wear having my arms cut in it; I hope he hath not utterly lost his time under me, and therefore he will be content with this remembrance of
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
him. I leave him also my little written book with the blue strings, wherein are set down the leases and woods, and provisions belonging to the archbishop∣rick, I would have him keep it to himself for it may be of good use unto him.</P>
<P>To George Aisme, my page and godson, I give ten pounds, and one of the summer nags which I have running amongst my horses.</P>
<P>To Master John Harte, sometime solicitor of my causes, I give all the arrearages of young Livesays wardship, if any be behind; and I give him also a gold ring with a turtoise in it.</P>
<P>I bequeath to Robert Clarke, yeoman of my horse, ten pounds. And so much I give also to George Hollist.</P>
<P>I give moreover to Master Francis Harton, Ma∣ster John Goodwin, and Ralph Watts, the remainder of young Peyton's wardship to be equally divided amongst them as it hath been heretofore. To Wal∣ter Dobson I give that which is left of Turvey's wardship <HI>(videlicet)</HI> fifty shillings yearly. And to George Hollis the remainder of Pole Wheeler's wardship so long as it doth continue, I do not know the time but it is fifty shillings by the year.</P>
<P>To Sir Dudley Diggs, my antient pupil in Ox∣ford, I give my ring set with an orient sapphire, and all my antique coins of gold, silver, and brass which are in my study at Lambeth.</P>
<P>To Sir Henry Martin, dean of the arches, and my good friend, I bequeath all my serpentine cups and vessels, which I give him that when he seeth ruseth t h em he may think of me.</P>
<P>To Master Serjeant Hendon, my old Oxford acquaintance and friend, careful in my law-business, I give the fair bible which lieth in a white box,
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
standing in that room wherein I have heretofore or∣dinarily studied while I remained at Lambeth.</P>
<P>To the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury I do give five and twenty of those books which now re∣main in my study at Croydon, and I do give five and twenty more (to be taken after the other from thence) to the Dean and Chapter of Winchester to be put into their several libraries, and these I wish my Executors to choose out with the privity and some advice of the Dean or Vice-Dean of those churches for the time being, supposing that they wish to have such books as be not in their libraries already.</P>
<P>For Baliol college I have done divers things al∣ready, and if God send me life I have a purpose to let them taste something more of my courtesy.</P>
<P>There is a lease of two houses which was taken in the name of my brother Sir Morris Abbot, as he very well knoweth, my will is that my executors do so order it that twenty pounds yearly out of the benefit arising by that lease, be paid to my bro∣ther John Abbot of Guildford during his life, if the lease do so long continue; and other twenty pounds yearly arising from that lease I appoint to be paid to the wife of Peter Hawkins sometime of Bramsil in Hampshire, for so long as the said wo∣man doth live and no longer. What benefit may be made by the renewing the under leases, together with the remainder of the time after the decease of my brother John and the wife of Peter Hawkins, I give to my nephew Mr. Maurice Abbot of the Inner-Temple, and I pray my executors that these things may be truly performed according to my honest meaning.</P>
<P>To Sir Nathaniel Brent, and his wife my kinswo∣man,
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he daughter of my brother Doctor Abbot sometime Bishop of Salisbury, I give a piece of gilt plate of thirty ounces. And I do further declare that it is my purpose and intent, that one paper or instrument under my hand and seal made for her benefit and now in her custody, should take place according to the conditions and time therein specifi∣ed; this paper beareth date the tenth of January one thousand, six hundred and twenty. And my will is that the like paper should be available and take place in behalf of Master Edward Leonthorpe sometimes my servant. I do leave power sufficient to my executors to see these things performed.</P>
<P>I do give also to the said niece of mine the Lady Martha Brent, the gilt bason and ewer which the Lord Thomas Earl of Dorset, sometime Lord Trea∣surer of England, and in his life-time my honour∣able good master gave unto me by his will as a legacy; they may easily be known because they have engraven upon them the arms of his lordship.</P>
<P>I bequeath to my brother Sir Morris Abbot Knight my great silver hour-glass with the case where∣in it is kept, as a special remembrance of me.</P>
<P>To his son my nephew Master Maurice Abbot, student of the Inner-Temple, I do give my bigger chain of gold to wear when he seeth cause, and other∣wise to keep in memory of me. I give to him all the profits that may be raised of the lease of the Priory of Dover, which in his name is taken of the Archbishop of Canterbury to make use of it to himself after my decease; and there be some petty leases now fit to be demised the benefit whereof I give unto him. He knoweth what I have done for him besides, and I doubt not but he will safely keep a paper of directions which I have heretofore given unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="76"/>
To my brother John Abbot I bequeath twenty pounds, and to his wife a piece of gilt plate of twenty ounces. To their daughter Sarah Sàye, I give twenty pounds, and a piece of gilt plate of twenty ounces. And I give to my other niece Da∣maris Bingstey a piece of plate of thirty ounces gilt. To John Abbot their brother I give a ring of forty shillings and no more, because I have otherwise provided for him already, God send him to use it aright, and to perform those things which by writing I have given him in charge.</P>
<P>I had a purpose to have left some yearly revenue for the maintenance of a conduit which I built in the town of Canterbury, but the mayor of that city and his brethren by the instigation of two or three persons have used me so unrespectfully and ungratefully, that I have held it fit to alter that purpose.</P>
<P>To the clerk of my kitchen — Shelton I give ten pounds. And so much to George Hodges, Also ten pounds to William Harrison my taylor.</P>
<P>I do give to Master Simon Hayward that serveth me fifty pounds.</P>
<P>To the Princess the Lady Elizabeth, daughter to my old lord and master King James of England, I give one hundred pounds to make a pretty cup of gold, in token of my dutiful respect and service to her princely dignity.</P>
<P>I do give to my niece Margaret Marsh one hun∣dred pounds to bestow upon some jewel to be worn in memory of me. And the like sum I give, and to the same purpose, to my niece Mrs. Elizabeth Tre∣sham. And the like sum I give to my niece Mrs. Mary Diggs. And so much to my niece Mrs. Mar∣tha Abbot, be she married or unmarried. I be∣queath
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
to my nephew Mr. Edward Abbot, Mer∣chant, for his wife, one hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I designed afore two hundred pounds to be distri∣buted among my poorer servants, at the rate of five pounds a man, I do now add unto it two hundred pounds more to be divided amongst them, so that there will be ten pounds a year for each of them.</P>
<P>To James Sowthis I do give for a legacy twenty pounds.</P>
<P>Touching the hospital erected by me in Guildford where I was born, and my parents of good me∣mory long inhabited; I have finished the main building, and if there be any thing of decency or ornament convenient to be added thereunto, if God permit me life I shall accomplish those also. I have procured from my old sovereign King James of bless∣ed memory a gracious mortmain, and I have de∣vised statutes for the good government thereof, which I have caused formerly to be set down, and I have sent them to the hospital; I may peradventure add some small things unto those statutes during my life but if after my decease any thing appear not to be perfect, I leave the charge of the explaining the same unto my executors, to whom I leave a power to change circumstances if necessity so require, provi∣ded that they keep the substance of mine intendment. My purpose in the first place is to maintain there one master of the hospital, twelve poor brothers, and eight poor sisters all aged persons of honest re∣port. But my intent in the second place is that some manufacture be set up in that town of Guildford, to find work for the younger sort of people. And to that end I have begun the work already, and be∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owed a good stock upon it. For the prosecution of this manufacture I crave the furtherance of the
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
mayor and his brethren in that town, wishing that they will jointly agree together for the best course to promote that business, the honour will be God's, the reputation will be theirs, and will be a great benefit to that town if their poor be set on work. I would have my executors and the master of the hospital ever willing and ready to help forward mine inten∣tion, and if they all look at the public and not too much at the private, God will give a great blessing unto it. I have appointed a room for the work-house, and I hope it be already fitted thereto. For the en∣dowment of the poor of the hospital I have bought land at Merrow, of one Master Harwood, and I have already passed it to that house; if there be no such conveyance made, I do by this my will give that land to the master and brethren of that hospital. I have bought also of one Master Goodwin lands at Me∣redin, or lands called Meredin, to the rent of forty pounds by the year. And of one Constable I have bought land at Horsham, yielding rent to the value of forty pounds by the year. These two parcels I do give to my hospital for ever, and I would have my executors to help forward those donations of mine if there be cause, but no way to hinder them. I have bought of Thomas Hill land at Ewhurst for the yearly rent of twenty-seven pounds, ten shil∣lings; if it shall seem fit to Mr. George Duncan to have this land changed, I shall not be against it, so that there be as much land for value, and a good title laid in lieu of it; but be it one or the other I give it to my hospital. For the upholding of the manufacture set up by me in Guildford I do give one hundred pounds a year for ever to the said my hospital, (that is to say) threescore pounds a year bought of Master Bishe, and forty pounds by
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
the year lying at Charlewood and bought of one Polsdon; and howsoever perhaps I do not hitt on the right names of the sellers, or the places where these lands lie, I will that it be no hinderance to this my donation or donations, but that the possessi∣ons be made good to the master and brethren of my hospital. I intended for the maintenance of the poor of my hospital two hundred pounds by the year, and now by the releasing of certain wood ground bought of one Bromfield of Katherine-Hill near Guildford, there wanteth the rent of twelve pounds ten shillings yearly charged upon my hospital. If I provide not this in my life-time, I require my exe∣cutors to supply it with speed; but I am upon a bargain in Sussex, which I hope shall clear it up all. And whereas my good friend Sir Nicholas Kempe did by his last will and testament, give five hundred pounds to be bestowed on some good work as I should think meet, I here declare that I have be∣stowed that whole sum upon some of the lands be∣fore-mentioned to be bought and conveyed to my hospital, which I do being warranted thereunto not only by the general words of his will, but by par∣ticular signification from himself, for he was present when I laid the first stone of the chapel for that hos∣pital and gave me one hundred pounds towards the work, and since from to time, and lately before his death being with me at Croydon, he voluntarily assured me he would be mindful of that house and foundation; and whereas he doth not in his will specially name the hospital, I conceive the reason of it out of true ground to be, because he did not know whether I would have any man's name used in the founding of that house and corporation be∣sides mine own; but I declare him now a principal
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
and the only benefactor of moment to that place, and I have caused mention to be made of it in the statutes of that house that he did confer to that foundation six hundred pounds, which to posterity will be an honour and memorial to that good knight sometime an officer in the archbishoprick and to me.</P>
<P>For the performance of this my last will and testament I must appoint some person or persons to take care, I having a good part been mine own ex∣ecutor, having already distributed with mine own hands much of that little which God hath given unto me. But yet for the further accomplishing of that which I intend, and for the disposing of my funeral, I appoint my executors my brother Sir Morris Abbot Knight, and my nephew Mr. Mau∣rice Abbot of the Inner-Temple, Barrister, not doubting but care will be taken that all things shall be performed according to my true meaning above expressed. Whatsoever is remaining (my funeral charges excepted) be it money, bonds, plate, debts, cattle, or other moveables will fall to mine executors, who I doubt not but will take pains for the per∣formance of my will, and among other things will look that my note books which are written with mine own hand, be safely kept. Such legacies as I have given to my servants I wish to be satisfied with all convenient speed, especially to those who are the poorer of them; and the like I declare for that which is by me bequeathed to the parishes of Lam∣beth and Croydon. There is no great matter to be done to my hospital, but if any small thing be re∣quisite I would have it done as soon as may be.</P>
<P>So beseeching Almighty God to increase the
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
number of his faithful, to abate more and more daily the strength of antichrist and popery; to send peace and prosperity to this island; to bless our sovereign my most gracious lord and master the king with long life and happiness, and to send him a fair and plentiful issue; I commend my soul again and again to the mercy of my most blessed Saviour and Redeemer.</P>

<HEAD>A WORTHY AND MEMORABLE LETTER, RECEIVED From the Lord of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> his Grace.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Memorand. That the letter underwritten being sent to this Town, before this day, by the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, his grace, for special reasons is or∣dered to be registered on Record, and followeth in these words, viz.</OPENER>
<P>AFTER my hearty commendations, I do not live so far from you, but that I many times do enquire of the state of your town, which, because it was the place of my beginning, I cannot chuse but have in extraordinary recom∣mendation. And understanding that it hath not pleased God to give unto it that flourishing estate for trade and traffique which I have known it sometime to have, I have often, both in medi∣tation with myself, and in consideration with some of my friends, your well willers, debated by what means I might give the best furtherance unto the same, wherein if I shall acquaint you with my thoughts, you will bear with me, because they all proceed from a good mind toward you, and if I erre in any thing, upon information I shall quickly be reformed. First therefore you must know, that
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
considering my perpetual expence, my means are not great, to bring about some such thing as my heart hath desired, as perhaps for the erecting of some hospital, as my most worthy predecessor the Lord Archbishop Whitgift did at Croydon, the like whereof would require a full purse, and long continuance of time in the place which I hold, whereof no man can take to himself any assurance, since we are daily in the hand of God, and enjoy our breath, but at his pleasure. But in this I do not forget, that this may be a relief for some few aged folks, but the generality of the town is not the better for it, whereas if the corporation did thrive and flourish, those poor and aged people, would easily be maintained by the charity of such as be of best ability.</P>
<P>Some other time, my mind hath run upon bestowing of some stock upon the town, that men who do trade, might have some money lent them for two or three years, freely, putting in some good security to the Mayor and his brethren to repay the same again, that so the stock may go from hand to hand, and be preserved to posterity. But here I have thought that if trade be not good, this can little avail, for a well meaning man may be de∣cayed, and not only lose that which is lent unto him, but that also which he hath of his own, and then to force sureties to pay his debt, is to weaken the estate of other who did undertake for him. Upon these and the like deliberations, I have thought then with myself what course there may be taken for the advancing of trade amongst you, which will set the poor on work, and may be a benefit unto the common-wealth, and the thing which I most pitch upon is clothing, because both
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
town and country hath been accustomed thereunto. And yet herein I confess that the making of your kersies doth give me little satisfaction, because sometimes they are up for the price, and sometimes they are down; and as far as I can learn by the Merchants which deal for cloth, there is not great hope in that kind of any certainty hereafter.</P>
<P>So that this putting me to seek further, I have entred into consideration, whether it were not good to fall to the making of stuffes, as they call them; as Say, Serge, Dorincks, Durance, Perpetuana, and other of that kind, which might employ the wool growing thereabout, and exercise the people in Labour. And here I find as many difficulties, for it is a great attempt to alter the trade of a Town so far from the former course thereof; and perhaps a glutt of them may cause them to be as ill vented as other cloths are now.</P>
<P>Thus out of my love to the place of my birth, and to you all, I stand distracted what to do, if God should make me able to effect any thing for you; but after all those ways above-named, my meditations have fallen upon this, whether in pro∣bability the making of broad cloth, either blues or mingled, or white, be not a likelier trade to thrive than that which is now used; and if there may be appearance thereof, (for certainty I know there is none in any mortal thing) the greatest will be to alter the tools which now are, as Racks, Mills, &amp;c. into those which are convenient for the making of broad Cloth; now in this methinks I may give you some help, If I shall do as the low Countrymen lately have promised to do to their people, the more to invite them to the making of cloth, That is, to bestow four or five pound upon
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
every man that will set up a loom at first; and in like proportion to the alteration of Mills, and other instruments fit for that whereof I speak, which, if God do bless me, I shall be willing to do to some reasonable quantity, if it may do good unto that corporation, the welfare whereof I so much desire.</P>
<P>My request unto you Mr. Mayor, and to your brethren, is, that you will think upon these things, and meeting together at your own oppor∣tunities, deliberate what may be most available for the place wherein you live, which I would have you to beat, and beat again with yourselves, and others, before you return me an answer, lest if any alteration should hastily be, and it should have ill success, blame should be laid upon me when I have not deserved it. And if you can find out any other matter, than those which I have thought upon, if they be not of too great Charge, I shall upon Consultation, easily condescend unto your de∣sire, for I have a meaning to do you some good, as God shall send me life, and afford me ability.</P>
<P>In token whereof, I have now dispatched away one hundred pounds, which I trust my Country∣man Mr. Robert Parkhurst, will see by exchange conveyed unto you. And this money I would have to be no way employed, but to be laid up in safe custody, until such time as I shall give order for the using of the same, upon such resolution as I shall receive jointly from you. And so thanking you for sundry remembrances, which at several times I have received from you, I forbear at this time to be further troublesome to you, but leave you to the good blessing of the Almighty.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE HOSPITAL, AT <HI>GUILDFORD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Hospital which the Archbishop so nobly endowed, at Guildford, stands over-against Trinity Church; it is built of brick in a qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dran∣gular form, with a noble tower at it's entrance, and four turrets over the gate. In the south east corner of the quadrangle are genteel apartments for the master; on the west side are apartments for the brethren, and on the east for the sisters. The chapel at the north east corner, is spacious and high roofed, and has two large gothic windows of painted glass very well stained, representing as follows. The north window has four lights, divided with stone work: in the first, Isaac is sending Esau for venison, Rebecca behind; and from a window, at a distance, Esau is discovered hunting. See <HI>Genesis</HI> 27th ch. Underneath is this inscription.<Q><L>Natu priorem praeferens</L>
<L>Paterni amoris impetu,</L>
<L>Coeca errat indulgentia.</L>
<L>Natura non dat gratiam.</L>
<P><PB N="80" REF="89"/>
<HI>By the impulse of paternal affection, blind Indulgence preferring the elder, errs, but nature does not grant the favour.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>In the second, Rebecca is instructing Jacob to obtain the blessing, and underneath<Q><L>Vtero gemellos dum tulit</L>
<L>Edocta mater coelitus</L>
<L>Docet minorem vt occupet</L>
<L>Natale priulegium.</L>
<P><HI>The mother, being inspir'd from Heaven, while she bore the twins in her womb, advises the younger to obtain the blessing.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>In the third, Isaac blessing Jacob; Rebecca behind.<Q><L>Benedictionis proemium</L>
<L>Pascentium, haud captantium est</L>
<L>Subest{que} decreto Dei,</L>
<L>Non ordini natalium.</L>
<P><HI>The reward belongs to those who feed; not to those, who eagerly desire it; and is conferred according to the Decree of Heaven, not according to Birth-right.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>In the fourth, are Isaac, Esau, Jacob, and Rebecca; Esau with the savoury meat, threatening Jacob.<Q><L>Maior minori irascitur,</L>
<L>Sibi; praereptum dolet,</L>
<L>Quod poscit ortu debitum.</L>

<P>In the first light of the East Window, is Jacob's ladder, <HI>Genesis</HI> 28. and underneath the following.<Q><L>Saxum reclinatorio,</L>

<P><HI>A stone is for his pillow, and Heaven for his teaster: here the ladder of heaven is seen, and the dreams of the pious are holy.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>In the second, Laban embracing Jacob; Rachel behind with her sheep, the well, &amp;c. Chap. 29. verse 13.<Q><L>Primo receptus comiter.</L>
<L>Pascit peregrinos greges,</L>
<L>Sub lege dura seruiens,</L>

In the fourth light, Laban's covenant with Jacob, behind are tents, with his wives, children, &amp;c. Chap. 31, verse 43. &amp;c.<Q><L>Domum remigrans, inuidum</L>

<P>Near the top of the window, are three angels holding scrowls, with this inscription;<Q>DO PAUPERIBUS. REDDO DEO. QUID <LB/>RETRIBUAM DOMINO? HIC VOTA RESOLVAM. <P><PB N="83" REF="93"/>
<HI>I give to the poor. I restore to God. What shall I return unto the Lord? here will I pay my vows.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>Underneath these, are four human figures, with escutcheons on their breasts; wherein there are the arms of York, France, Lancaster, and Scotland. There are beside these, several different coats of arms, and over the north window, this date, 1621. Near the chapel is a spacious dining room, at the upper end of which is a half length picture of the Archbishop, and near him another of Sir Nicholas Kemp, Knt. which, by the warm stile of the paint∣ing, must be Paul Vansomer's. Under his picture is his coat of arms: Gules <HI>three Garbs</HI> Or, <HI>a Bor∣dure engrail'd of the second.</HI> Underneath the dining room, is a hall for the use of the brethren and sisters. Over the gate, is the master's dining room, and in the top of the tower, with iron grates before the win∣dows, is the treasury. On scrolls in many of the windows are these words:<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans 8. chapter, 15 verse.</NOTE> CLAMAMUS ABBA PATER.</Q> There are likewise two large kitchens, and other rooms, with exceeding good cellars under the whole building. The garden adjoins to the House, is walled round, and well planted.</P>

Seeing that the most reverend father in Christ, and our most faithful counsellour George, by divine Providence, Archbishop of Cant∣erbury, Primate of all England, and Metrapolitan, out of a pious and liberal disposition, hath determined in his mind to found and erect at his own expence, a certain Hospital, in the Town of Guldeford, in the county of Surrey, for the perpe∣tual habitation of poor and needy men and women, there to be maintain'd, and for the employment of others in manufact∣ure in handicraft trades, and in labour, to be instructed and bred up to their own proper employments, and sor the site of the said Hospital, at his own proper costs, has prepared and built in the town of Guldeford, a certain house with necessary buildings, courts, and gardens, for the reception and habita∣tion of such poor and others, and has humbly besought us to grant unto him (as far as in us lies) our royal favour to the erecting, founding, and establishing the said Hospital. Know ye, that we graciously favouring and wishing well to such a laudable work, that the full intention of the charity and piet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this most reverend father may have its desired effect, most worthy of such a man of our special grace and certain know∣ledge,

<P>FORASMUCH as every Christian Man is bound according to the measure of grace and mercy which he hath receiv'd from God, to render back again to his Eternal Father such tokens of grateful∣ness and thankfulness as are in his power, and I George Abbott, Archbishop of Canterbury, from the mere mercy of the Blessed God, besides the in∣ward graces of his Holy Spirit, having been parta∣ker of some earthly and worldly benefits more than most of my birth and rank hath attain'd unto, I have held it agreable with my duty to leave behind me to posterity some monument of my thankfulness to my Creator, and some testimony of my faith in Christ Jesus, which if it bring not forth some fruits to his glory, is to be held but as a dead and unprofi∣table faith; And therefore my affection leading me
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
to the town of Guildford, wherein I was born, and where my aged parents lived many years in good repute, I have thought upon erecting an Hospital there, which I have dedicated to the Blessed Trinity. And intending that poor people should be maintained therein, think good to lay down certain Statutes and Ordinances, which shall be for the governing of the Master, Brothers, and Sisters there, as also of all other persons who are therein to be placed; and of the guidement of the possessions and rents, which God hath and may enable me to bestow upon the same. In the name therefore of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who directs my Pen aright, I thus begin.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Master and his Office.</HEAD>
<P>THERE can be no body of people be govern'd but there must be a head, to direct and oversee all the rest of the members. This head I appoint to be the master, whose office shall be to rule and govern all the rest with mildness and love, if it may be; otherwise moderate severity if there be just cause.</P>
<P>He shall require of the brethren and sisters the due observation of the ordinances and statutes; he shall keep one key of the common chest, and another of the Evidence House, that nothing be done there without his knowledge; he shall cause the gate of the hospital to be open'd and locked at due times appointed, and night by night shall have the key brought unto him, he shall be present when any one is admitted, and whensoever wages or allowances are to be paid; he shall be careful to preserve and defend
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
the lands and inheritances of the house, and to that end shall see the evidences well and safely laid up; he shall see that all entries be duly made in the ledger book: he shall look in time to all reparations and all other good husbandry of the hospital, being careful that no fire or candle be dangerously kept; if any lodging be void, he shall keep the key thereof till it be deliver'd to some brother or sister which is newly to be admitted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Quality of the Master.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Master of the Hospital I appoint to be a man fearing God, of good name and fame, of fifty years of age at the least, born or having lived twenty years before in the town of Guildford; which I will have evermore to be understood within the compass which is governed by the Mayor, and no otherwise; he shall be at his election or nomination a single or unmarried man, and so shall continue so long as he remaineth Master; and if he thinks fit to marry, and doth so indeed, I appoint that on peril of the breach of his oath, he leave the place, within three days, to a new election or nomination. If any person hath been Mayor of the town, and hath governed with good report, he shall be capable of this place; and so shall the minister who is parson of Trinity church in Guildford, although he was not born in the town, so that either of these be single men, and furnished with the rest of the conditions named in this chapter; he shall as near as may be a provident man, acquainted with the affairs of the world, especially for letting or selling of land, or turning it to the best benefit of the place where he is master.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the manner how the Master shall be chosen or appointed.</HEAD>
<P>I Do reserve unto myself, the nomination of the Master, so long as it pleases God that I shall live; and after my decease I appoint, that if the place shall be void by the death, resignation, or expulsion of the former Master, that then the Vice-Master, or in his absence the Senior Brother, shall, as soon as may be, give notice to the electors that the place is void, that so they may meet to∣gether in the chapel of the hospital to make a new choice. The electors I appoint to be five; the Mayor of Guildford (or in his absence his deputy); the Parson of Trinity parish (and if he be not in town, the Parson of St. Nicholas parish); and three of the brethren of the hospital, that is to say, the Vice-Master, and the two Senior, or most an∣tient Brethren; and look on whom the greater part of these five shall agree, he shall be admitted to the place of master; these shall proceed without favour or affection, or without any corruption whatsoever, direct∣ly or indirectly, as in the presence of God, who judg∣eth righteously touching the good or evil actions of all men in the day of Christ. This election I appoint to be within four and twenty hours of the being void of the mastership, or at least within that space after it shall known that the place is void. And if within that time it be not supplied by a new election, I then order, that by way of devolution it shall fall to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to be nominated by him according to my statutes; and if the See of Canterbury be void, or the Archbishop <HI>sede plena</HI> shall not design the Master within twelve days, then it shall be in the
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
omination of the Bishop of Winton, for the time being, and if that See be also void, or the bishop <HI>sede plena</HI> shall not appoint the Master within seven days, then Sir George Moor, of Loseley, Knt. or after his decease, the heir of his house, whoever he shall be from time to time, shall have the sole appointing and designing of the Master; which, if it be not compleated within five days, the choice shall return to the first five electors. When the election, or nomination is thus passed, the person elected, or nominated, shall in the presence of all the brethren of the house, in the Chapel of the Hospital, take first the oath of sovereignty and obedience to the King's Majesty, his lawful heirs and successors, as by law prescribed, and then this oath here ensuing.</P>
<P>I A. B. from henceforth, so long as I shall con∣tinue and remain Master of this Hospital, shall and will by God's assistance, do my best endeavours to perform, fulfil, and obey the statutes, ordinances, and constitutions of the same, so far as they concern me, and shall do my best, that the rest of the brethren andsisters, as also all others that are under me, do keep and observe the same; I shall not hereafter at any time procure, or willingly give assent unto the hurt, endangering, or endamaging of the said hospital, in the hereditaments, or any of the moveable goods thereof, or in any thing that may concern the estate or welfare thereof; but to my best skill and power, shall defend, promote, and set forward the benefit and commodity thereof while I live. So help me God in Christ Jesus.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Vice-Master.</HEAD>
<P>THE Master, and the five senior brethren that be at home, shall, the morrow after Michael∣mas day, yearly, choose a Vice-Master, one of the gravest and best understanding, who shall govern in the master's absence, as is prescribed in these statutes; and the rest of the brethren and sisters shall for that year, yield unto him a regard and due respect; the election shall be made by the major part, where the master's voice shall be accounted two. And at the end of the year, he shall have a stipend of thirteen shillings and four-pence out of the common chest; he shall keep one of the keys of the evidence house, and another key of the common chest; and in the absence of the master, he shall night by night, have the keys of the hospital brought unto him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the poor Brethren and Sisters who are capable of that Place.</HEAD>
<P>THE Head being thus settled, the members are to be added which must compleat the body. On the right side, I put the poor men whom I call brethren, and on the left side, the poor women whom I term sisters. I ordain, that such as are to be nominated into these places be persons of good name and fame, no drunkards, or noted for con∣tention, no lepers, or such as have any contagious, infectious, or incurable disease; none such as at any time have been known to have begged from door to

door; but such as in their younger years have honestly laboured, and by age, impotency, or other hand of God, be grown poor, and fallen to decay; such only as have been born in the town of Guildford, or at least have lived there for twenty years before; I will that they be threescore years of age, before they be chosen; single, and unmarried persons, and so to remain; else if they do afterwards marry, by virtue of their oaths, they are to leave the hospital, and all interest they have therein, within two days; and among these, I would have preferr'd such as have born office, or have been good traders in the town, whereby they have set others on work, if any of them be fallen into poverty; such as have been soldiers, sent, or chosen out of Guildford, and have ventured their lives, or lost their blood for their prince and country; and if any be of my kindred, or have served my father, or me, I would have them to be capable, although they were not born in Guildford, nor be of the age above-named, so that at one time, there be not above three of my kind∣red, or more than three at once that have been my servants, and so that otherwise they be qualified as before.</P>

<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The manner of choosing the Brothers and Sisters.</HEAD>
<P>THE Nomination of these during my life, I re∣serve to myself; but after my decease I appoint that the first place that falleth void, be it brother or sister, be filled and named by the mayor of Guild∣ford, or in his absence by his deputy; and the second place, by the master of the hospital, or in his
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
absence by the master of the free school, in Guild∣ford, and so turn after turn; the third, by the mayor, or his deputy; the fourth, by the master or school∣master, and so forward for ever. I do ordain that this nomination be perfected and accomplished within four and twenty hours, after the known death or avoidance of any formerly possessed with the place; and if the mayor, or deputy, for their turns, do not design the person to be supplied within the space above-named, then my will is, that the parson of the parish of St. Nicholas do appoint him, or her, that is to succeed; and if the master of the hospital, or the schoolmaster do not design for their turns, the person to be supplied by them within the space aforesaid, then my will is, that the parson of Trinity parish do appoint him or her that is to succeed; and if the said person be not at that time at home, then the master of the hospital; which, if he be not then at the nomination shall fall to the parson of St. Mary's church, in Guildford; all which nominations I would have to be as in the presence of God, without corruption, or filthy lucre; without favour, or si∣nister affection; for I give unto these persons this power only upon trust, and not to make a gain of that which I have spared from my back and from my belly, and from my kindred, and from some other good use in some other place, to bestow for God's sake on the poor members of Christ in this town; the Lord forbid that any man should abuse this my charity, for which he did never sweat or labour.</P>
<P>The manner of these nominations I ordain to be, that the mayor, master of the hospital, or other person, in whom the power of appointing or design∣ing
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
for that turn is, do come into the Chapel of the said Hospital, and there before four, or more of the brethren, do name him or her, whom in his conscience he findeth fittest; which being done, the master, or vice-master shall conduct the person so named to the chamber which is void; which he or she shall presently enjoy, but not have any other allowance of the house, till the end of one quarter of a year; the money that is to be saved being to be put into the common chest of the hospital, to supply reparations, law-suits, and other casualties; but after the end of three months, the brother or sister design'd, shall in the chapel of the hospital, before the master, or vice-master, first take the oath of allegiance, or obedience to the King's Majesty, as by law it is prescribed, and then this oath ensuing.</P>
<P>I A. B. from henceforth, so long as I shall remain a member of this hospital of the Blessed Trinity, in Guildford, shall and will, by God's assistance, do my best endeavour to fulfil and keep the statutes and ordinances of the same, so far forth as they concern me; I shall be obedient to the master of the hospital, in all reasonable and honest things; I shall not at any time willingly procure or give assent unto any indan∣gering or endamaging of the said hospital, either in the estate, hereditaments, or moveable goods thereof, but to my best power and skill, shall defend and set forward the welfare and commodity thereof whilst I live. So help me God in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Here I think fit to add this. That because it may fall out that there be not men or women of three∣score years of age, and single persons in the town to supply such places as are void, (as in my own life∣time I found once by experience that there were not)
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
I do give licence, that in such case, and no other, some aged married man or woman be chosen, which is of quality and conditions otherwise agreable to my statutes; but in the choice of such a person, I will have the consent of the mayor of Guildford, the master of the hospital, and the parson of Trinity parish, all concurring, because I will not have this done but upon necessity. This man or woman shall have the weekly allowance os the house, and nothing else, and shall be called by the name of an out-bro∣ther, or an out-sister.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Service of God.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG or above all things that such persons as remain in the hospital are to do, it is first to take care that God be served, who is the giver and continuer of all good things. The master therefore of the hospital shall so often as he conveniently can, read some part of divine service, according to the book of common prayer, morning and evening, in the chapel of the hospital, to the brethren and sisters, and give God thanks, for their founder, and all other God's benefits and blessings; and this to be every day, except those hereafter mentioned; and if the master does not perform it himself, then the vice-master, (whom I would have always chosen such a one as can handsomely read) or in his absence, such a one of the brothers as the master shall appoint, shall without grudging perform that office, there can no man be too good to serve God. On the sabbath-days, festival-days, Wednesdays, and Fri∣days, at morning and evening prayers, and at Sa∣turdays
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
at evening prayers, all the brethren and sisters of the hospital being at home and not sick, (except the porter, who is to tarry at home to keep the house in the absence of the rest) shall repair two and two in orderly fashion to Trinity church (which is near unto them) and there devoutly pray with the rest of the congregation, for the preservation of the king's majesty, his children and issue when God send∣eth them, as also for the happiness and prosperity of his kingdoms, and hear the word of God preached and read, and there be partakers of the Lord's supper at least thrice every year; and to the end all persons that are able may be present at prayers in the chapel or parish church, the master, or vice-master in his absence, shall weekly appoint one to note such as are absent from prayers, who shall daily give their names to the master, or in his absence to the vice-master; and if any without a sufficient cause to be allowed by the master, or in his absence by the vice-master, be not present at prayers, he or she shall for the first time forfeit one halfpenny, for the second a penny, and so for every time after for each month, to be abated and defaulted from their allowance at the pay day happening next after such their default of these forfeitures, one third part to be employ'd to the porter for that month, and the other two to the common chest; but in case any one without such cause as is aforesaid, shall be found to have been absent seven times in one month, he shall for the first time that he is found so offending, forfeit all his allowance of the house for one fortnight; and for the second time he or she shall have an admonition solemnly given them by the master and vice-master, which shall be entred into the ledger book; but if after three such ad∣monitions,
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
the same person shall be found again to have offended in the same kind, he or she shall then for a negligent and incorrigible person, be expelled from the hospital, never to be received there again; for why should any one who will not serve God, be thought fit to be in this body. After my departure out of this world, I appoint that a commemoration or thanksgiving should be said at prayer time, daily in the chapel, for me as the founder of this hospi∣tal, and for Sir Nicholas Kempe, Knt. who was a benefactor to this house; the substance of this com∣memoration to be, that they thank God for raising up unto them such a founder and benefactor, and do pray God that they use aright such benefits, as by their means have been, and are bestowed upon them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is a Copy of the Thanksgiving.</P>
<P>Most gracious God, we yield thee all humble and hearty thanks for all these fatherly mercies, and outward comforts thou hast prepared for us; particularly that it hath pleased thee to move the heart of the most Reverend Father in God, George Abbot, late Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, who for the worship and service of God, and the relief and comfort of the poor, founded and erected this hospital; and also we thank thee for raising up Sir Nicholas Kempe, Knt. that in his life∣time, and at his death, was to this house a worthy benefactor; Grant O Lord, that we may spend and use these thy mercies a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght, to thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and glory; and that others by their good examples, may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up to works of charity, and that both they and we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord and Saviour.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>THE Eye of the governour doth best direct th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things that are under his charge, and therefore tis fit that the master of the hospital be present continually, if it may be, but because ne∣cessary business may call him sometimes away, I allow unto him for his own affairs (if he have cause) two months in the year, to be taken jointly or se∣verally at his discretion, so that always when he goeth to lie two nights out of town, he do enter it into the ledger book; when he is abroad in business of the hospital, either for law-suits or to visit the possessions of the hospital I account him not absent; if his private necessities enforce his absence for more than two months, if he shall before the greater part of the brethren at home shew a reasonable cause, which shall be approved by them first, and then by the mayor of Guildford, I give unto him one month
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
more, to be registered in the ledger book; but be∣yond this none shall have further power save the archbishop of Canterbury for the time being, whom I beseech to be moderate herein, and so to provide that by the absence of the master the hospital be not suffered in any sort to run into dilapidations of building or estate. To each brother and sister I allow the space of two months absence in the year, if they have cause to use it jointly or dividedly, but so that they ask leave of the master, or in his ab∣sence of the vice-master, whom I would not have to be difficult in granting them leave, the time of their going forth shall be recorded in the ledger book; and to the end that the members of this house may not be much flirting abroad but remaining at home as is fit for aged folks, I appoint that no brother or sister being absent for any whole week from the hospital shall have any more than half their weekly allowance, and this not to be neither unless the master and vice-master do give approbation there∣unto. The master, brethren, and sisters are not to lodge any where in Guildford but in the hospital, and if any brother or sister without a sufficient cause to be allowed by the master, or in his absence by the vice-master, shall lodge out of the house, for the first time he or she shall forfeit two-pence, for the second time four-pence, for the third time eight-pence, for the fourth time two shillings and six-pence, and for the fifth time the whole next month's allowance, these forfeitures to be to the common chest, for the sixth time such is to have a solemn ad∣monition to be entered in the ledger book, for the seventh offence in any one year which shall be count∣ed to begin at the feast of St. Michael another ad∣monition is to be given and entered; but if within

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. That no Strangers lie within the Hospital.</HEAD>
<P>AS on the one side I have been careful that those os this society should lodge within the house, so my desire is as great that such as are stran∣gers should not lie within the hospital; I have pro∣vided that no married persons be of this body, but experienced in other places hath taught me that fa∣thers and mothers are not unwilling to draw their children and kinsfolk unto them, which will be both a burden and disturbance to the house, and so will the receiving of other strangers be, besides the di∣sorders that cannot be foreseen; I do therefore ordain that no person whatsoever shall be lodged in the hos∣pital, or continue there one whole night saving the master, and the brethren, and sisters, except they be necessary servants of the house only; I allow the master, or in his absence the vice-master in extremity of sickness and not otherwise, to give leave to any brother or sister to have one person of their kindred, or otherwise, to watch with them besides the help that they shall have from the rest of this society, but if any brother or sister do openly or secretly suffer any person to lie or continue all the night in their chambers or any other place in the hospital, and be thereof convicted, he or she shall for the first time forfeit the whole allowance of a month to the com∣mon

To the master of the hospital I give leave to entertain a servant or two for his necessary uses, but such as he will be answerable for to the society; and because the lodgings provided for him hath convenient rooms, and sometimes there may be extraordinary concourse to the town, as when the court lieth near, or at the time of the assize, or in some other cases which can∣not be foreseen, I do permit unto him to lodge either his friend or some other person or persons of quality, so that it may not be longer than for four or five nights; and the same liberty I allow to be used to my brother Sir Morris Abbot Knt. or to any of his children or children's children if they should have occasion to see Guildford, provided always that none of these bring any detriment or expence to the hos∣pital.</P>

<P>I Have caufed this house to be substantially built, and with God's blessing, together with those who shall enjoy it at the fame time, may continue long without great need of reparations. If any thing be amiss in the main work I would have it presently amended, least neglect at the first bring on further decay; to this end I ordain that yearly on the Mon∣day next following the feast of St. John Baptist, the master or vice-master in his absence, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hree other of the brethren whom he shall think apt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for

If in any private room of the hospital any glass win∣dow be broken, or any other decay be by wilfulnefs or negligence, that brother or sister whose the room is shall at his or her charge see it amended within the space of a month, upon warning given by the master or vice-master, within which time if it be not done, the person whose default it was shall for every week forfeit four-pence, to go the common chest. If the glass of any public room be broken, it shall be enquired of who was the cause thereof, and if it be found, the party offending shall make it up again; and if it cannot be discovered who it was, it shall be repaired at the charge of the hospital. But for the better preservation of all glass in the house, I do utterly forbid the keeping of any dog within the hospital or precincts thereof, upon pain to the party offending, of forfeiting five shillings to the common chest for every day; and in this I require the master and vice-master upon their oaths to be very severe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. How their Lands shall be demised, and with what Cove∣nants, &amp;c. How their Woods are to be kept, and both Woods and Lands surveyed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lands or Houses which I give to the hos∣pital are intended by me to be for the good there∣of, and that in perpetuity, if God be so pleased; I do therefore in this chapter lay down such conditions as are fitting to be observed in their demise; as first, that no lease or any other grant shall be made of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments belonging to this hospital, unless the master, vice-master, and besides them the greater part of the brethren do yield their consents thereunto, nor unless the full accustomed yearly rents thereof, according as I do leave it, be thereupon reserved and payable quarterly, or at the least half yearly, at or within the said hospital; and such lease or grant shall not be above twenty and one years from the making of the same by the hospital, and with reservation of all timber trees. And in the same lease shall be contained the true and perfect parcels and quantities of land by common estimation, with the buttalls and boundalls thereof, if conveni∣ent it may be; secondly, there shall be in every such lease or grant a proviso contained, that the farmer or tenant shall pay the rent at the hospital within twenty days next ensuing any one rent day limited for pay∣ment thereof, without any demand to be made fur∣ther. In each lease or grant to be made, covenants of this effect shall be, first that the lessee at his own cost shall not only repair, and if need be, re-edify all edifices thereupon, and so well re-edified and repaired shall leave them at the end of the term, but shall
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
also from time to time hedge, fence, ditch, and scour the ground, according to the usual courfe of husbandry of the country where the lands do lie; secondly, that the said lessees shall bear, pay or dis∣charge, or save harmless the said hospital, of and from all charges, ordinary or extraordinary; going out or to be paid by reason of the lands demised, or of any parts thereof; lastly, that the lessees betwixt every eighth and ninth year of the said term, shall make or cause to be made, and written fair in parch∣ment, and delivered up to the master at the hospital, a true and perfect terrier, containing the name and quantity, by estimation, of every parcel of ground demised, the manner of the situation, and lying of the same towards other lands, and the names of the present owners of the lands which are of any side, abutting upon the ground demised; I do ordain and appoint that the said hospital upon any reservation or otherwise, shall not increase their rents or revenues of those lands I shall give unto them, to any higher or greater proportion than as the rents thereof now are, and according to that rent they are now let for, unless it fall out that upon necessity, which cannot be avoided, some one of their farms do diminish in their rents, which I ordain shall be moderately sup∣plied, by raising somewhat upon some other farm which may well bear it, for I desire that my hospi∣tal shall keep up the rent wherewithal I do endow it; but I do charge the conscience of the master and brethren, that they be very wary and careful before they make any such alteration. I do also ordain, that in renewing and letting of leases, the present farmers and tenants be always preferred, doing reasonably for the benefit of the hospital, as other men will do. And amongst the rest, I would have those especially
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
favoured who have their leases from myself, or by my direction; and also I do ordain and appoint that such money as they shall raise or make up on the fine of leases, shall be divided into two parts, the one moiety to be distributed between the master, bre∣thren, and fisters, equally, saving that the master shall have a double portion of the other moiety, to be put into the common treasury for the bearing of public burthen, as suits of law, reparations, or the like. For the underwoods, if they be not in my time leased out, I would have to be cut in due sea∣son, and yearly look what profit is made thereof, that it should be accounted as part of their revenue, and go to the common charges of the house; but no timber trees to be sold but upon great necessity, or apparent shew of decay, and the money arising there∣of, to be put into the common treasury, not to be expended but upon great occasion.</P>

<P>THE revenues and rents of the house shall be reserved in the hospital, by the master, vice-master, and the other clavigers or key-keepers, and they shall give their acquittance for it; if either of these places be void, or any of them be out of town, or so sick that they cannot be present at this receipt, then in their stead shall be called the next two bro∣thers in antient, that are able to stir abroad, they ta∣king unto them, if neither of them can write, some of the brethren that can write, or some other honest person who is able to write, and presently upon the
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
receipt of the rent, an entry shall be made thereof into the ledger book, and then immediately shall the money be laid up in the common chest, there to re∣main until there be occasion for payments to take it out again. When any quarter is ended, the next day if it be not Sunday, or if it be so, then the next day following, the clavigers, or chest-keepers, shall assemble in the master's lodgings, and taking forth of the common chest so much money only as is to be distributed, they shall pay unto each brother and sister their several due allowances, a note of the re∣ceipt thereof being presently made in the ledger∣book; and if any be sick, or absent, it shall be paid to such a brother as he or she shall make their attor∣ney, and then shall the master also receive his allow∣ance. If besides the quarterly wages or allowance, there happen any occasion for disbursements of mo∣ney otherwise, as for reparations, or suits of law, or some such like thing; this shall be inserted into the ledger-book, the day being named, and the occasion, and in whose presence, and to whom 'twas delivered, together with the hand or mark that received it.</P>

<P>THERE's nothing that maketh any corporation so to flourish, as good husbandry, and diligent looking to the state thereof; and if I your founder, in the course of my life had not been provident that way, how should I have been able to build this house, and endow it with possessions? and therefore I do appoint that on the twenty-ninth day of Octo∣ber, which was the day whereon I was born, yearly,
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
the master, vice-master, clavigers, and two others of the brothers who are most antient, and be in no office, or key-keepers, shall meet together in the master's lodgings, and there shall examine what rents or money of the common stock hath been received that year, as also what have been spent every way, and if they have exceeded in any expence, which God forbid, they shall be careful to set some course that in the year to come, it be more frugally and thriftily carried, and if there be any surplusage of money beyond the expence of the year past, which ended at Michaelmas, they shall carry that up to be put in the common chest; and they shall always at the time of their accounts set down in the ledger book, what the stock of money is which remaineth over and above the expences of the year; these accounts I ordain to be ended before Allhallows day yearly; if the nine and twentieth day of October fall on the Sunday, then the accounts shall begin the morrow after. When the accounts are ended, the master or vice-master shall in the hall upon Allhallows day, declare to all the brothers and sisters what the whole sum of the receipts was the year past, what also was the sum of that which hath been expended, and what remains in stock of the house the year twelve-month before, and what is the remainder this present year, that all of them may praise the diligence and faith∣fulness of those that manage the money, or dispraise it if there be cause. If there be found to be any arrearages in any of the accountants hands, the same shall either presently be paid, or within three days at the farthest be delivered to the clavigers to be laid up in the common chest, upon pain of loss of the next month's allowance of him that shall be so be∣hind; but if after the said three days be expired, the

whole arrearages shall not be paid within thirty days, that party in whom the default is, shall lose his place, and be sued in law for the arrearages remaining. I do ordain, that none of the money belonging to the common chest shall, upon pain of perjury in all those that give consent thereunto, be lent out to any person whatsoever, either within the hospital, or without; for no man's particular case is to be pre∣ferred before the publick good of the house, before order and will of me the founder.</P>

<P>THE Benefits that the master is to reap by the hospital, shall be twenty pounds in money, to be received at equal portions, at the four quarters in the year, the lodging assigned unto him, a livery gown, and a double portion of such dividend in money, as is to arise by fines taken for renewing of leases, when it shall fall out. I appoint to every brother and sister, two shillings and six-pence, to be weekly paid to them, their chamber, and their livery, besides such money as may arise by letting of leases hereafter, and from the poor men's box; and con∣cerning gowns, this I do ordain, that once in two years, against Allhallows-tide, there be bought cloth good and strong, of price about nine or ten shillings, the London yard, out of the which the master shall have the allowance fit for a large gown, and each brother and sister so much as will make unto them a reasonable gown, according to the tallness or sta∣ture of the party that is to wear it; in these gowns they may go to the Trinity church, or other place where the sermon is to be; the badges are to be ac∣counted to belong to the hospital, and must descend to those that come in from time to time; and if any

die, his or her gown is to be left to the use of those who shall succeed, that the hospital be not driven to buy liveries, but at the time appointed; notwith∣standing when new gowns are bought and made, it shall be at the will of every one to cut out their old, or dispose of them at their pleasure. The master is to take care of these things, as also of buying seacoal or charcoal every year that may serve for the publick use between Allhallows-tide, and our Lady-day in Lent; if this be got in, in the sum∣mer-time, it will be cheaper because the ways are fairer; when the wood that I bought of Bromfield shall be grown fit, I appoint that such fuel as may be taken of it, be used without spoil in the cutting, and this will save some money which is otherwise to be laid out. I do appoint, that yearly, on Christ∣mas-day, there be expended ten shillings amongst the company, publickly in the hall, in remembrance of the birth of our Saviour Christ; and the like sums on Easter-day; as also upon Whitsunday; that the ma∣ster, brethren, and sisters, may with thanks to God lo∣vingly rejoice together; and I appoint other ten shil∣lings, to be bestowed upon the twenty-ninth day of October, yearly, in commemoration of the birth-day of their founder.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. Touching the Manufacture to be set up.</HEAD>
<P>IN the procuring of my letters of mortmain, one principal matter intended by me, was to set up some manufacture in the town of Guildford, that young people might be set on work, and that by tra∣ding that place might flourish as heretofore it hath
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
done; I have taken order, if God do bless it, for lands of one hundred pounds by the year, to be purchased for that purpose, and when it be done, I intreat the mayor of Guildford, and his brethren, solemnly to meet once or more times in the year, and to call unto them such wise and discreet persons, as they shall think fit to advise, whereupon this employ∣ment may best be fastned, as or hemp-knitting of stockings or waistcoats, or any other laudable trade that may be for the common-wealth of that corpo∣ration in particular; and I do pray these persons which shall so meet, to think upon orders to be set in writing for the digesting of the work, and how once at least in the year there may be an account taken how this manufacture doth prosper, and what is from time to time to be altered, added, or amend∣ed in the project; if God save my life, I shall think upon the advancing and establishing of this my in∣tendment, which I do earnestly desire that a be∣ginning may be given to the work. For the erecting and continuing of this manufacture, I do appoint the land at Charlwood, bought of one Polesdon, which is let for forty pounds yearly, which rent I order to be applied only to that purpose; and in like manner, I appoint the lands at Burstow, bought of Mr. Bishe, and being rented at sixty pounds a year, to be employed solely for this manufacture, so that I do ordain, this 100<HI>l</HI> by the year shall not be mingled with any other money of my hospital, but the rent thereof to be put into a chest by itself, and all ac∣counts appertaining thereunto, to be kept and re∣served by themselves; I appoint, that upon this chest be written and fastened in paper, The Chest for the Manufacture, and three locks and keys shall be
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
thereunto, which keys shall be kept by the master, vice-master, or senior key-keeper; and in this chest shall always be a great ledger-book, wherein shall be set down what money for the manufacture is receiv'd in, and what is laid out, and the account at the end of the year shall be there kept, that it may be seen how the benefit by the trade increaseth or decreaseth. I do not tye them that have the charge of this work to any one certain trade, but give them power at the end of the year, which I wish to be on the tenth or eleventh of November, to alter it if they find reason for the same, but appoint, that such alteration shall not be, but upon great deliberation and good grounds, least by too much shifting all comes to nothing. I do ordain, that some discreet man who dwelleth in the town of Guildford, and writeth a fair hand, be chosen for a clerk to write down things necessary for the stablishing this work, and for this I appoint him to have twenty shillings yearly at or upon the tenth of November; and if the work do prosper, it shall be in the power of the overseers for this work to better his pay, so that it do not exceed twenty shillings more in any year.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. The Proportion of the Rent of the Hospital, and the Allowances of them.</HEAD>
<P>THE mentioning of the clerk's fee for the ma∣nufacture, doth put me in mind to set down an establishment of the revenues for my hospital, and the expences which must issue out of the same. The lands then that I have endowed it withal, the rents whereof I would never have increased or decreased
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
if it may be, are these; the lands at Merrow which was bought of Mr. Goodwin, by the year forty pounds; the land at Ewhurst, bought of Thomas Hill, by the year twenty-seven pounds, ten shillings; the lands at Horsham, bought of Constable, by the year forty pounds; the wood land bought of Brom∣field, by the year twelve pounds, ten shillings; in the whole sum, this amounteth to by the year to two hundred pounds; out of these receipts I do make this proportion of yearly allowances, to the master of the hospital by the year, twenty pounds; to twenty poor brothers and sisters, two shillings and sixpence a piece, by the week, which in the year amounteth to one hundred and thirty pounds; to the vice-master, yearly, thirteen shillings and four pence; to the two relievers of the impotent, thirteen shil∣lings and four-pence; for four gaudy days, forty shillings; for the clerk to record things, and for reading the statutes yearly, twenty shillings; to the parson of Trinity-church, yearly, thirty shillings; the total of all which expence, amounteth to one hundred and fifty-five pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight-pence; there remaineth then over and above, yearly, the sum of forty-four pounds, three shillings, and four-pence, which I ordain to this use; that once in two years, there should be bought sixty yards of cloth London measure, to make new gowns, for the master, brothers, and sisters, which clothing may be strong, good cloth, and may arise in the whole to a∣bout thirty pounds, whereof fifteen pound was saved the year before, and fifteen pounds to be taken out of the rent of that year when the gowns were bought; out of the rest of the surplusage of the revenue, I appoint fuel to be bought yearly, which is to be burnt in common for the relief of the poor brothers
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
and sisters, from All-hallowtide to Easter, which may amount to about; if any wood or coal be had towards this, out of the lands bought of Bromfield, it may save so much money otherwise; but I do order, that the said lands of Bromfield be so disposed of, that it may yield rent, or wood, or coal, to the proportion before set down by me, that the hospital may honestly enjoy that which I have paid for. When all these expences are issued forth, there will be a convenient surplusage remaining, yearly, for the stock of the house to bear law-suits, reparations, or other publick charge of the hospital, which will be more increased by such money as will arise out of the quarter's pay, which is forborne upon the coming in of every brother and sister at the first; and this stock I ordain to be so carefully kept for the publick, that if the master, or any brother, shall take out for any employment, the value of one shilling, or upwards, upon any occasion or colour, I appoint, that being convicted thereof before the Archbishop of Canterbury, he shall presently, by the said lord archbishop, be expelled the house. When this stock ariseth to one hundred pounds, I would have that sum carefully kept in gold, against time of extremity, and none of it to be taken out with∣out great cause, and yet then upon the first opportunity to be made use of again, because I hold it conveni∣ent, that this my foundation should not be without one hundred pounds lying by against any great need, which I hold fit to be kept as a secret of the house, and not to be revealed by the master, or any brother of the house, to any stranger whatsoever; the rest which is above this hundred pound, is to be a run∣ning stock safely kept, but upon necessary occasions
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
money to be taken out for the publick use of the hospital from time to time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. The Explanation of a Clause in the second Chapter of these Statutes.</HEAD>
<P>'TWAS in the year of our Lord, 1619, that I first intended the building of this hospital, and then minding the good of the town of Guild∣ford, in laying down the persons that should be ca∣pable of places in my foundation, I declared, that such as were born, or did dwell twenty years in Guildford; I would have Guildford to be under∣stood, that alone which was under the government of the town, and not otherwise, wherein I did strait∣en the extent of the place, 'twas not want of charity to others, but to increase my favours to the inhabi∣tants thereof in desiring that there should be provisi∣on for them, and somewhat to spare, if God were so pleased; now since that time I had quite established my work, I do hear, that the mayor and his bre∣thren have endeavoured to enlarge their jurisdiction, and have gone about to draw under their government some places adjoining, as if they were hereafter to be members of that corporation, and consequently capable of such benefits, as may arise by the govern∣ment of that town. I will not dispute whether this endeavour be well or no, for I have nothing to do with it, but for avoiding of controversies in future times, I do hereby declare, that my settled purpose and meaning, is, that from henceforth, I app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t none to be capable of my hospital, which was not born, or lived in Guildford, the town of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u ldford
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
being taken as it was in the year 1620, and not ac∣cording to any addition that hath been made since, or may be hereafter. Whereafter, if I should be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>manded a reason, it were a sufficient answer to ask as it is in the gospel, 'May I not do what I will with my own?' but I have many other causes and reasons to declare, as I now do, as first, I keep myself to my first purpose and intention; secondly, 'twas the good of Guildford, old Guildford as it was, when I was born, and my parents lived in it, that I did seek which I did know would be greater to the poor of that place, when it was kept restrained within itself, and not communicated to any other; thirdly, it is well known that I was born in the parish of St. Ni∣cholas, in that town, unto which parish are belong∣ing many houses in, and about Katherine-hill, unto whom, notwithstanding, I did not enlarge my bene∣volence, because they were not under the government of the mayor, and my desire was, and is to keep my charity within bounds, that after my death, things may go on quietly, and there be no variance or controversy. Now if I have thus restrained the place where I was born, it shall not be well if any other neighbours shall murmur thereat, or be discon∣tented therewithal. I do therefore charge the master and brethren of the hospital, that they never give way to any importunity, that may or do cross this my explanation and declaration.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ROBERT ABBOT, Bishop of <HI>SALISBURY.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="153"/>THE LIFE OF Bishop ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS learned and humble man, was born <HI>anno</HI> 1560, and bred up under the same school-ma∣ster, with his brother the Archbishop; till being sufficiently qualified for the university he was sent to Baliol College in Oxford, <HI>anno</HI> 1575.</P>
<P>In 1582, he took his Master of Arts degree; be∣came a noted preacher there, also a constant lecturer at St. Martin's Church, in the Quadrivium, and sometimes at Abingdon in Berkshire.</P>
<P>His preferment was remarkably owing to his merit, particularly in preaching; notwithstanding the distinction which some have affected to make, be∣tween the talents and tempers of these two brothers; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That George was the more plausible preacher, Robert the greater scholar; George the abler states∣man, Robert the deeper divine: gravity did frown in George, and smile in Robert:"</Q> such the quali∣ties of this Robert evidently were; that upon the first sermon he preached at Worcester, he was made lecturer in that city, and soon after rector of All-Saints there; and upon a sermon he preached at Paul's Cross, he was presented to the rich benefice of
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
Bingham in Nottinghamshire, by one of his auditors, John Stanhope, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and it is observed, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'As dew dropping on mowen grass refresheth it, and maketh it spring anew, so his labours in his pasto∣ral charge much refreshed the consciences of true converts, which had felt the scythe of God's judg∣ments, and made them <HI>spring</HI> up in <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>new∣ness</HI> of life; again, as dew distilling in silver drops mollifieth the parched ground, so his heart melting into tears in many penitential exhortations mollifi∣ed the stony hearts of those who had been before most obdurate in their sins; and again, as dew that falls from heaven returns not thither back again, but enricheth the soil, and makes fruitful the earth; so his pains wheresoever he bestowed them were never steril, but brought forth much fruit of comfort both to himself, and of knowledge in the mysteries of salvation to his hearers.'</Q></P>
<P>In 1594 he became no less eminent for some of his writings; particularly, against a certain Papist, on the Sacrament. He then took his degrees in divinity; that of Doctor being completed in 1597.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of King James I, he he was made chaplain in ordinary to him; and this King so well esteemed of his writings, that, with the second edition of Dr. Abbot's book <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Antichristo,</HI> in 1608, his majesty ordered his own commentary upon part of the Apocalypse to be printed: an honour, which that King did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom. And, in truth, the Doctor's pen had now brought him also into general esteem, for what he had hitherto published in Defence of Willi∣am Perkins's <HI>Reformed Catholic,</HI> against Dr. William Bishop, now a secular priest, but afterwards, in the Pope's stile, a titular Bishop, of the Aërial Diocese
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
of Chalcedon. It is asserted by Dr. Featley, in his life of Abbot, that he has herein given that William Bishop as great an overthrow, as Jewell to Harding, Bilson to Allen, or Reynolds to Hart. At the end of this excellent work is added a particular treatise, he soon after writ, intitled, <HI>The true ancient Roman Catholick;</HI> which he dedicated to Prince Henry; to whom it was so acceptable, that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand, and promised his assistance, upon the next vacancy, to advance him higher in the Church. And though by that Prince's untimely death the Doctor lost some hopes, yet, in course of time, his deserts found other friends to do him that justice.</P>
<P>In 1609, he was unanimously elected master of Ba∣liol College. Here it is observed of him, that he was careful and skilful, to set in this nursery the best plants; and then took such care to water and prune them, that in no plat, or knot, throughout the University of Ox∣ford, there appeared more beautiful flowers, or grew sweeter fruit, than in Baliol College, while he was ma∣ster. His diligent reading to his scholars, and his con∣tinual presence at public exercises, both countenanced the readers, and encouraged the hearers. These regu∣lations and improvements he further wrought, by e∣stablishing piety, which had been much neglected; re∣storing peace, which had been long wanted; and making temperance more familiar among them, which had been too great a stranger in that society.</P>
<P>In May 1610, we find him nominated by the King, among the first fellows of his majesty's Royal College at Chelsea, then newly founded, and design∣ed as a kind of fortress for controversial divinity; being thus, as it were, engarrisoned, with the most able and select champions for the Protestant cause,
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
against all assaults of Popery: and in November the same year, he was made prebendary of Normanton, in the church of Southwell.</P>
<P>Upon his preaching a sermon before the King, during his month of waiting at court, in 1612, when the news of Dr. Thomas Holland's death was brought from Oxford, his majesty named him suc∣cessor in the Thealogical Chair, usually called the King's Professor of Divinity; but he modestly re∣fused the same, till his brother procured a mandate from the King for him to hold it. Some notable circumstances we meet with of him in this station<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Some notable circumstances,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in this station.</HI>] Among the rest, while he was Professor in the chair at Oxford, was, his preaching a sermon before the university; in which, he so sig∣nificantly laid open the oblique methods then used by those who secretly favoured Popery, to undermine the Reformation; and Dr. Laud, then present, was so notoriously suspected to be one who used those methods, as to have the said reflections applied by the whole auditory to him; that in great vexation he wrote to his patron, Dr. Neal, then Bishop of Lincoln, (therefore about the year 1614) to know whether he should not make a direct reply to it. The passage Laud objected to, was, that Abbot should say, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There were men, who, under pretence of truth, and preaching against the Puritans, struck at the heart and root of that faith and religion now establish∣ed among us; which was the very practice of Parsons and Campian's counsel, when they came hither to seduce young students; who, afraid to be expelled, if they should openly profess their conversion, were directed to speak freely against the Puritans, as what would suffice: so these do not expect to be accounted Papists, because they speak only against Puri∣tans; but because they are indeed Papists, they speak no∣thing against them: or if they do, they beat about the bush, and that softly too, for fear of disquieting the birds that are in it.'</Q> Hereupon, Laud, in his letter to the said Bishop of Lincoln, complains, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he was fain to sit patiently at the rehearsal of this sermon, though abused almost an hour to∣gether, being pointed at as he fat; yet would have taken no notice of it, but that the whole university applied it to him; and his friends told him, he should sink in his credit, if he answered not Dr. Abbot in his own: nevertheless, he would be patient; and desired his Lordship to vouchsafe him some direction.'</Q> But as we hear not that Laud did answer it, the Bishop might perhaps vouchsafe him rather directions to be quiet.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
and herein, he has had the character given him of a profound divine, most admirably well read in the fathers, councils, and schoolmen; and a more mo∣derate Calvinian, than either of his two predecessors in the divinity-chair, Holland and Humphrey, were; which he expressed by countenancing the Sublapsa∣rian way of predestination.</P>
<P>Lastly, upon the King's perusal of his <HI>Antilogia,</HI> against the <HI>Apology</HI> for Garnet, and the fame of his incomparable lectures in the university, upon the King's supreme power, against Bellarmine and Suarez, (printed after his death) his majesty, when the See of Salisbury fell void, sent his <HI>Conge d' Elire</HI> for him to the Dean and Chapter.</P>
<P>Thus, as he set forward, one foot in the temple of virtue, his other still advanced in the temple of ho∣nour, though indeed, but leisurely; which is impu∣ted to his own humility; the obstruction of his foes, who traduced him for a Puritan, (though cordial to the doctrine of the Church of England) and the unwillingness of some friends to adorn the Church with the spoil of the University, and mar a Pro∣fessor to make a Bishop.</P>
<P>He was consecrated by his own brother the Arch∣bishop, on December 3, 1615, in his chapel at Lambeth. Herein equalizing the felicity of Seffridus, some time Bishop of Chichester, who being a Bishop himself, also saw his brother, at the same time Arch∣bishop of Canterbury.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158"/>
Other bishopricks were voiced upon him; but the business of the nullity before-mentioned, in his bro∣ther's life) made a nullity for a time in his Grace's good intentions; insomuch, that King James, when the Doctor, newly consecrated Bishop of Sarum, came to do his homage, said pleasantly to him, Abbot, <HI>I have had very much to do to make thee a Bishop; but I know no reason for it, unless it were, because thou hast written against one;</HI> alluding to the name of the Po∣pish priest before-mentioned.</P>
<P>In his way to Sarum, he made a farewel oration at the university, with great applause. We have some fragments of it preserved, in the original Latin, in Hollandi Her. Angl. and Featley's Life of Abbot; and a translation thereof, or epitome in English, by Lupton, in his Hist. of modern Protestant Divines. His brethren, the heads of houses, and other Ox∣ford friends, parted with him on the edge of his diocese with tears for grief; and the gentry of Sarum received him with those of joy. The next Sabbath∣day following, he offered his <HI>first fruits in the temple,</HI> taking for his text, the words of the Psalmist 26. 8. <HI>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</HI></P>
<P>After he had verified the Words of his Text in the person of David, his Sermon ended, he verified it in himself, and made a demonstration that he loved that house of God, <HI>not in tongue only and in word, but in deed and verity;</HI> for observing the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed, through negligence, and the covetousness of those who filled their purses, with that which should have stopped the chinks, he used such means with the prebendaries, as drew from them five hundred pounds, which he applied to the reparation of the church; and then laboured to re∣pair

the congregation, both by doctrine and disci∣pline, visiting his whole diocese in person, and prea∣ching every Sabbath-day, whilst his health would permit, either in the city, or in the neighbouring towns; but this was not long, for my author tells us, that preaching on John 14. v. 16. <HI>I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</HI> many of his hearers, presaged his departure from them; so indeed it proved his last and farewel sermon, for soon after he came out of the pulpit, he was seized with most dreadful fits of the stone in the kidneys, which were brought on by that sedentary course he had accust∣omed himself to, by his close application to study, so that his hour-glass, contrary to others, the <HI>sooner ran out, by being stopped.</HI> But in all the bodily tor∣tures of his last fit, his soul was at ease; for the assurance of heavenly things, caused him most chear∣fully to part with earthly, and the quick sense he had of the <HI>powers of the life to come</HI> deaded the sense of his bodily pains. There were many came to visit him on his death-bed, and among others the Judges being then at Sarum in their circuit, to whom he spared not his christian admonitions; and amongst many points he discoursed on before them, insisted very much upon the benefit of a good confcience, rendering many thanks to his Creator for the great comforts he felt thereby now in his extremity, and admo∣nished all that heard him, so to carry themselves in their most private and secret actions as well as in their publick, that they might obtain that at the last which would stand them in more stead, than what all the world could afford besides. Having, when death approached, summoned his domesticks, and with broken speeches in the language of a dying man, beginning to make a profession of his faith, his
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
friends persuaded him to refrain, it being manifest in his writings; he yielded to their advice, and signed all his works with these words; <HI>That faith which I have defended in my writings, is the truth of God; and in the avouching thereof I leave the World.</HI> Thus with exhortations, benedictions, and the pains of his di∣sease, quite worn out, he lay as it were slumbering, with now and then a short ejaculation; and at length, with eyes and hands uplifted for the space of two or three hours, after some weeks continuance in that dreadful disorder, he gave up the ghost, on March the 2d, 1617, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, with these words; <HI>Come Lord Jesu, come quickly, finish in me the work that thou hast begun; into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit, for thou hast re∣deemed me: O God of truth, save me thy servant, who hopes and confides in thee alone: let thy mercy, O Lord, he shewn unto me: in thee have I trusted, O Lord, let me not be confounded for ever.</HI></P>
<P>He had not completely filled this see two years and three months, being one of the five Bishops which Salisbury saw in six years; and was buried over against the Bishop's seat in the cathedral. Dr. Featley who was his domestic chaplain, tells us, that he had so endeared himself to the inhabitants of Sa∣lisbury by his diligence in his pastoral charge, by his hospitality and bounty to the poor, and lovely and lowly carriage even towards his inferiours, that he was universally lamented.</P>
<P>He had been twice married, the last time with some displeasure to the Archbishop, about half a year after his promotion to the said see. He left one son, or more, and also one daughter named Martha, who was married to Sir Nathaniel Brent, Warden of Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on College in Oxford; and their daughter Mar∣garet,

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Sir MORRIS ABBOT, LORD-MAYOR OF <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="164"/>THE LIFE OF Sir MORRIS ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P>MORRIS ABBOT, the youngest son of Mr. Maurice Abbot, of Guildford, and brother to Robert and George beforementioned, was bred up to trade, and became an eminent merchant in the city of London, but was more remarkably distin∣guished, by his applying himself to the direction of the affairs of the East-India company, and his ear∣nest attention to whatever might promote the exten∣sive commerce of this nation, or strengthen her fo∣reign colonies.</P>
<P>In this quality, we find him one of the commissi∣oners employed in the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty with the Dutch East-India company, by which the Molucca Islands, and the commerce to them, is declared to be two thirds belonging to the Dutch East-India company, and one to the English.</P>
<P>This treaty was concluded at London, on the seventh of July, 1019, and ratified by King James, the sixteenth of the same month, and is as remarka∣ble a transaction as any in that reign.</P>
<P>It was in consequence of this treaty, and in order to recover the goods of some English merchants, that Sir Dudley Diggs, and Morris Abbot, were sent over into Holland, in the succeeding year, 1620, but with what success does not appear.</P>
<P>He was afterwards one of the farmers of the customs, as appears from a commission granted in 1623, to him and to many other persons, for administ∣ering
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
the oaths to such persons, as should either de∣sire to pass the seas from this kingdom, or to enter it from foreign countries.</P>
<P>In the succeeding year, 1624, he was appointed one of the council, for settling and establishing the colony of Virginia, with very full powers for the government of that colony, as by that commission appears.</P>
<P>On the accession of King Charles I, to the throne, Mr. Abbot was the first person upon whom he con∣ferred the honour of knighthood, and so great was his interest at that time in the city, that we find him chosen to the first parliament called in that King's reign, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1625, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir Heneage Finch, and Mr. Robert Bateman.</P>
<P>In 1627, he was one of the Sheriffs of London, with Henry Garway; Sir Cuthbert Hacket, being then Mayor.</P>
<P>About the year 1635, he erected the monument to the memory of his brother the Archbishop, in his native town of Guildford.</P>
<P>In 1638 he was Lord-Mayor of the city of Lond∣on; on which account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here was published by Sir T. Heywood, a description of his solemn entry.</P>
<P>On the tenth of January, 1640, he departed this life. No farther particulars are to be met with, ex∣cept that he was a great lover and encourager of trade, as well as fortunate therein.</P>
<P>He had a son whose name was George, fellow of Merton college in Oxford, and who took the degree of Bachelor of Law in 1630.</P>
