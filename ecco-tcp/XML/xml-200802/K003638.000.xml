<HEAD>AN EVENING's WALK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>NE summer's eve, when ev'ry swain was hous'd,</L>
<L>When Sol had scarce one glimmer left behind,</L>
<L>Each little star, faint glitt'ring, cast a ray,</L>
<L>And spangled o'er the dusky robe of night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fond of the scene, I wander'd far from home,</L>
<L>O'er leafless lawns, and flower-breeding vales,</L>
<L>Till weary nature slacken'd in my steps,</L>
<L>And made me halt upon a friendly bank.</L>
<L>Calm thro' a bridge there ran a peerless stream,</L>
<L>That scarcely mov'd the ozier's slender wand:</L>
<L>Here I took my stand, and view'd the solemn scene.</L>
<L>The bat had been an hour on the wing,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="12"/>
Chasing the night-fly and the buzzing gnat:</L>
<L>The purblind owl had left the ancient tower,</L>
<L>Prowling with flossy wing along the mead.</L>
<L>Anon, as out of Chaos, shot a ray</L>
<L>Of chearing light, quiv'ring o'er the hills▪</L>
<L>As yet too weak to struggle with the dark;</L>
<L>Or, as th' Egyptian queen, far off beheld,</L>
<L>Shot her first beams on the Italian shore,</L>
<L>Her brilliant train reflecting on the waves,</L>
<L>Making the Tybur like a golden sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Clouds that o'er-hung the horizon, unseen,</L>
<L>Appear'd in view, like silver-skirted troops</L>
<L>Waiting the up-rise of the queen of night.</L>
<L>Slow she approach'd, and smil'd upon the world,</L>
<L>Op'ning fresh landscapes to my wond'ring eyes.</L>
<L>Philomel now chear'd the embow'ring grove,</L>
<L>The woodlark too, mistaking it for day,</L>
<L>Join'd her sweet notes with emulating strains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Near to my left there stood an ancient pile,</L>
<L>By wasting time, and savage war defac'd,</L>
<L>Like a reduc'd and hoary-headed chief,</L>
<L>Commanding awe even in destruction.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="13"/>
On its slinty sides deep-dy'd ivy clung;</L>
<L>Its roof was capt with velvet-grounded moss,</L>
<L>And round its base, wild weeds and flowers grew,</L>
<L>The stinging nettle with the briars blend,</L>
<L>The secret haunt of adders and of toads.</L>
<L>Thro' the wide breaches of the rock-built walls</L>
<L>Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down</L>
<L>Upon the verdant slope, in lines direct and clear,</L>
<L>Reflecting on a dimpled brook below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A solemn silence now o'erspread the globe,</L>
<L>Save when the minnew wanton'd on the stream,</L>
<L>And left a circle spreading to the brink.</L>
<L>Anon, as wind from out some hollow cave,</L>
<L>A deep-felt sigh from out the ruins came,</L>
<L>As from a heart just bursting with its load,</L>
<L>Which streight was answer'd with a voice of woe,</L>
<L>Like sorrow soothing the more sad despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A while I stood, in doubt, to know the cause,</L>
<L>Or to retreat, lest some deluding fiend,</L>
<L>Aping the voice of grief, meant to destroy.</L>
<L>At length resolv'd, with caution I approach'd,</L>
<L>O melting sight! my wounded heart ran o'er</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="14"/>
And empty'd at my eyes.—A mournful pair,</L>
<L>The woeful part ners of affliction sat,</L>
<L>On the low basis of a mould'ring urn</L>
<L>And open'd to my view a tragic scene.</L>
<L>Conceal'd, I stood, observing their distress;</L>
<L>She, in her lap, an infant cherub held,</L>
<L>A lovely boy, the offspring of their loves.</L>
<L>Her eyes were bent with sorrow on the babe,</L>
<L>While in her face the little dear one smil'd,</L>
<L>And then, with tears of misery and love,</L>
<L>She clung him eager to her throbbing breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wretched husband on her neck reclin'd,</L>
<L>Striving to chear his melancholy dame,</L>
<L>Feigned a hope, tho' foreign to his heart:</L>
<L>But when he found despair had seiz'd her soul,</L>
<L>His tears burst forth, and bath d his manly cheeks,</L>
<L>And on his bended knees he trembling fell,</L>
<L>Lifting his eyes with anguish 'gainst the sky,</L>
<L>With invocations loud, and agonizing sighs,</L>
<L>Imploring heaven for a ray of peace,</L>
<L>Till his loud accents shook the vaulted roof,</L>
<L>And reft his tortur'd breast.—I cou'd no more,</L>
<L>But flying to his aid with heart distress'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="15"/>
He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me,</L>
<L>And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd;</L>
<L>Like the fierce tyger, assail'd by hunters</L>
<L>In his dreary den, he stood defensive o'er his young,</L>
<L>Shielding 'em from danger. With humble voice</L>
<L>And friendly tears I mov'd him to attend,</L>
<L>And listen patient to the voice of pity.</L>
<L>Joy then, with fear and admiration mix'd,</L>
<L>O'erspread each face, and as I spake, they blest;</L>
<L>Hope, like the sun that clouds had long o'erveil'd,</L>
<L>Flush'd on their cheeks, extinguishing despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye woeful pair let your suspicions cease;</L>
<L>If the base world has put ye out of door,</L>
<L>If friends forsake and creditors pursue:</L>
<L>If you once more can trust a thought to hope,</L>
<L>And think it possible to meet a friend,</L>
<L>Tell me your story, and you yet shall find</L>
<L>That fate relents, and ceases to afflict.</L>
<L>Tho' here to you a stranger I appear,</L>
<L>To mercy I am none; to see another wretched</L>
<L>Makes me wretched too: by serving others</L>
<L>I still myself oblige, and meet reward,</L>
<L>Ample reward, a tranquil happiness!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="16"/>
Seeing others so, by me made happy.</L>
<L>I'd rather wipe the tear of grief away</L>
<L>Than add a ruby to a monarch's crown,</L>
<L>And win a Prince's promise for my pains.</L>
<L>If fate's not giv'n you over to despair,</L>
<L>And you'll accept of friendship once again,</L>
<L>Chear your sad hearts—let ev'ry fear subside,</L>
<L>Nor doubt a stranger yet may prove a friend;</L>
<L>If you'd be happy, tell me but in what,</L>
<L>I'll try my ev'ry means to make ye so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou gracious being! (if thou art human)</L>
<L>For thou speak'st with a celestial tongue,</L>
<L>Let me embrace thee;—O! pardon me, too,</L>
<L>That I assail'd thee with the threat of death,</L>
<L>When thou but meant to save me from his shaft;</L>
<L>For O! thy words were welcome to my soul</L>
<L>As mollient dews that fall upon the mead,</L>
<L>When parching Sol has curled each verdant blade;</L>
<L>Thou hast preserv'd to me the dearest rose</L>
<L>That ever scented gale, the sweetest bud</L>
<L>That ever eye beheld, or tempted death to kill,</L>
<L>(This drooping fair one, and her smiling boy,)</L>
<L>For they have suffer'd more than I dare tell,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="17"/>
And to repeat, is more than I can bear:</L>
<L>She once, alas, was fortune's favourite</L>
<L>And Minerva's pride, the tender fondling</L>
<L>Of a wealthy pair—O! sad remembrance;</L>
<L>Provoking tears! when will ye cease to flow!</L>
<L>These eyes have long been strangers to a smile;</L>
<L>Excuse me, friend, if they disgust thee.</L>
<L>We sing of others woe, but cry our own;</L>
<L>My heart has gushed at a thousand veins,</L>
<L>To see the sufferings of a matchless wife—</L>
<L>There was a time, when this forsaken held</L>
<L>At such an hour would have giv'n delight,</L>
<L>When solitude and night would give a scope</L>
<L>To thought, and yield a pleasing melancholy</L>
<L>To the jaded mind, o'ercharg'd with pleasure</L>
<L>And variety; but now, how dreary and sorlorn</L>
<L>It seems; and as we tell our mournful tale,</L>
<L>With double horror echoes back each word,</L>
<L>Mocking adversity, in hollow sounds,—</L>
<L>Telling us over what is death to hear.—</L>
<L>Such tale as mine, good friend, I oft have read,</L>
<L>Such woeful scenes have oft been play'd;</L>
<L>With sympathizing heart I've heard and seen,</L>
<L>And dropp'd a tear for the oppress'd and brave;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="18"/>
But ere I'd slept the fiction fled my breast,</L>
<L>And time would leave no traces on the mind.</L>
<L>When we become the objects of distress,</L>
<L>Remembrance stamps it with an iron seal</L>
<L>Upon our hearts, and ev'ry thought is death.</L>
<L>But to my story, 'tis my friend's desire—</L>
<L>I am no stranger to this gloomy pile,</L>
<L>I oft have paid a visit to these walls,</L>
<L>And oft admir'd the romantic form,</L>
<L>When the fair morn invited me abroad,</L>
<L>When fertile nature dasy'd ev'ry hill,</L>
<L>And ev'ry meadow blush'd a purple hue:</L>
<L>When thrushes sang, and linnet, charm'd the grove;</L>
<L>My heart then drank in pleasure at my eyes,</L>
<L>And felt no interrupter by the way,</L>
<L>No wretched thought to dash it back again.—</L>
<L>My father was a man of wealth and note,</L>
<L>(And held a mansion in a village by)</L>
<L>A better ne'er gave being to a son:—</L>
<L>I having read of mighty things abroad,</L>
<L>Of ancient Rome and grand Cairo's court,</L>
<L>The wealth of India and Egyptian wilds.</L>
<L>With thirst for novelty and desire,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="19"/>
I urg'd my father, and at length prevail'd,</L>
<L>That he would let me venture on a tour,</L>
<L>And prove the truth of hist'ry and report.—</L>
<L>'Tis six years since I left my native home;</L>
<L>Since when, so many wonders I have seen,</L>
<L>That curiosity at last grew sick.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Returning home, I cross'd the mighty Alps;</L>
<L>A deadly sickness seiz'd me on the way,</L>
<L>And made me seek for succour and a <HI>friend;</HI></L>
<L>A greater rarity than all I'd met.</L>
<L>An ample dwelling open'd to my view,</L>
<L>To which I bent my way, and shelter ask'd,</L>
<L>And was receiv'd at once a welcome guest.</L>
<L>With mild compassion they beheld my state,</L>
<L>And strove to chear me with a friendly voice.</L>
<L>Dismounting here, I would have enter'd in,</L>
<L>But that my feet their wonted use deny'd:</L>
<L>My limbs gave way, and let me to the ground;</L>
<L>When this dear fair came running to my aid;</L>
<L>She rais'd me up, and led me careful in,</L>
<L>And ev'ry day a true attendance paid:</L>
<L>When I was strugling with the pangs of death,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="20"/>
And with consoling hope she'd drop a tear,</L>
<L>Imploring heaven to preserve my life.</L>
<L>Her supplications did at length prevail.</L>
<L>No sooner had I▪ conquer'd one compeer,</L>
<L>But found my heart was with another ta'en,</L>
<L>Love, to whom I soon submitted, and embrac'd.</L>
<L>And made my hostess partner of my life,</L>
<L>But here partaker in affliction too;—</L>
<L>Her father was a Briton, once of wealth,</L>
<L>And held a mansion in that happy isle,</L>
<L>Till revolution and domestic broils</L>
<L>Destroy'd his lands and plunder'd all he had,</L>
<L>(Save a few stores, in secret he had saved,)</L>
<L>Putting himself and family to flight,</L>
<L>To seek for refuge in a foreign land.—</L>
<L>The action robb'd the good man of his life,</L>
<L>And in distress the mournful widow left,</L>
<L>With this fair comforter to buffet life,</L>
<L>And shield her from a base ensnaring world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here eighteen months I liv'd in social joy,</L>
<L>And in the desert found the dearest wife.</L>
<L>The kindest mother ever man cou'd boast,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="21"/>
Her better spirits so outworn by grief,</L>
<L>That made her frame, like frozen lillies, fade,</L>
<L>Recline and droop unto the earth again.</L>
<L>Not having heard one tiding from my friends</L>
<L>For many a day, we for England made;</L>
<L>And ere we reach'd the shore, the wind blew high,</L>
<L>And frowning Neptune on the surface foam'd,</L>
<L>Throwing up wat▪ry m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untains in our way,</L>
<L>And, in his anger, dash'd us on a rock:</L>
<L>Some twenty perish'd in the yawning deep,</L>
<L>But we escap'd, to meet a harder fate.</L>
<L>We sav'd our lives, but saw our cargo sink:</L>
<L>No sooner had I stepp'd with pleasure on the shore,</L>
<L>But met the tidings of my father's death.</L>
<L>From one misfortune often comes a crowd,</L>
<L>For some malignant enemy of mine,</L>
<L>Inform'd the good man I had long been dead.</L>
<L>And ere he died, he chose another heir,</L>
<L>And left him all his fortune and estate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, each glaring circumstance arose,</L>
<L>And fill'd me with surprise: I ask'd his name,</L>
<L>"Landore, he cry'd, a wealthy neighbour here."</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="22"/>
Landore! ye mighty Gods, how just!</L>
<L>I am that heir thy worthy father chose,</L>
<L>And for his friendship and his love to me,</L>
<L>I'll give his son his fortune back again.</L>
<L>I had enough before to make me happy,</L>
<L>And but resign that superflux to him</L>
<L>Which fate had chosen me steward to a while,</L>
<L>To quit my claim upon a just demand.</L>

<HEAD>SUNDAY, A POEM.</HEAD>

<L>HAIL holy day, by heav'nly laws design'd</L>
<L>A consolation to all human kind,</L>
<L>To man and brutes a day of peace and rest,</L>
<L>Wou'd man but own his duty, and be blest:</L>
<L>As when the harp, in Jesse's golden days,</L>
<L>Tun'd ev'ry Sabbath to Jehovah's praise,</L>
<L>By holy prophets, and by virgins strung</L>
<L>When truth and faith inspir'd ev'ry tongue;</L>
<L>Or when his son, with eloquence divine,</L>
<L>(The greatest favorite of the sacred <HI>Nine)</HI></L>
<L>Made the proud Saul, whene'er he touch'd his strings,</L>
<L>Bow his stiff neck, and own the King of Kings.</L>

<L>Observe the present age,—how vain, how strange!</L>
<L>How true sang he, who told us, "all things change,"</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="28"/>
A puny race of infidels and fools,</L>
<L>True slaves to vice, and fashion's gaudy tools;</L>
<L>Strangers to virtue, enemies to fame,</L>
<L>Except in foreign dress, or foreign name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Lord sends forth his hopeful heir to roam</L>
<L>To foreign climes, to bring new fashions home:</L>
<L>Caught with their manners and their taste, he burns,</L>
<L>And after six years travel, he returns</L>
<L>A flimsy fop, a coxcomb and a fool,—</L>
<L>A greater dunce than when he left the school:</L>
<L>Quick at intrigue, to gamble, or to sight,</L>
<L>A debauchee, if not a s—te.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Britain and France with emulation try</L>
<L>T' outdo each other in absurdity.</L>
<L>For here at home what vast excess we see</L>
<L>In city fops, and city quality:</L>
<L>Is there a folly introduc'd at court,</L>
<L>But streight on swiftest pinions of report,</L>
<L>It thro' the city in a trice is fann'd,</L>
<L>And introduc'd,—for taste, at second hand?</L>
<L>With cards and routs their Sunday is employ'd,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Christian virtue is destroy'd.</L>

Mode will bewitch, all eyes may plainly see,</L>
<L>And nothing charms like flimsy gaiety:</L>
<L>In all degrees, at ev'ry age, we find,</L>
<L>There's nought like fashion captivates the mind:</L>
<L>Do but observe the rich Sir Traffick's wife,</L>
<L>Old and deform'd, upon the verge of life,</L>
<L>With fulsome art, she rolls her faded eyes,</L>
<L>And thinks to make a conquest ere she dies;</L>
<L>While in their dress there's no distinction seen</L>
<L>'Tween sixty-six, and she of gay sixteen.</L>

<L>But to my theme; my muse at random strays,</L>
<L>And with a tedious prelude, she delays</L>

<L>I'll tack about, and to it, like a man.—</L>
<L>We raise subscriptions and new churches build,</L>
<L>But heaven knows how seldom they are fill'd.</L>
<L>Shou'd Sunday shine a summer's day, and fair,</L>
<L>Behold what legions round the town repair;</L>
<L>What flocks to Richmond and to Windsor drive,</L>
<L>And buz and sip, like drones about a hive,</L>

<L><PB N="20" REF="30"/>
On hackney'd steeds, the giddy blockheads fly,</L>
<L>Who kindly drag 'em home, perhaps, and die:</L>
<L>Of all the slaves dame nature's giv'n us here</L>
<L>There's none so noble, treated so severe</L>
<L>As the kind steed, that's ever yet been curst,</L>
<L>To have his last load greater than his first.</L>
<L>When worn with hunger, slav'ry and age</L>
<L>Finds still a harder journey to engage;</L>

<L>My Lord a mile or two to take the air.</L>
<L>But such is fate, when useless and grown old</L>
<L>To some unfeeling monster he is sold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each needy wretch his thirst for taste declares</L>
<L>Whene'er he speaks, but more by what he wears;</L>
<L>Oft is the fancy of some brainless prig</L>
<L>Couch'd in the choice of his enormous wig,</L>
<L>And oft we learn the tenor of the fair</L>
<L>By the sly glance, or belle-affected air.</L>
<L>Is there a nymph that Fortune will not own,</L>
<L>That beauty might indeed have stamp'd have shown?</L>
<L>Behold her sailing in the pink of taste,</L>
<L>Trump'd up with powder, frippery and paste,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="31"/>
Resolv'd 'gainst fortune, beauty's force to try,</L>
<L>(The greatest powers now beneath the sky,)</L>
<L>Rather than fate her conquest shou'd impede,</L>
<L>She'll not retreat, tho' virtue's sure to bleed.</L>

<L>They marry next, and find themselves undone:</L>
<L>Soon shifts the scene, the passion next is cloy'd,</L>
<L>And all their promis'd happiness destroy'd.</L>

Now look with sorrow at their former state,</L>
<L>And curse the burden of their present fate.</L>

<L>He, at a distance, from the crowd retires,</L>
<L>She, at a distance, leaves her gay desires.</L>

<L>Some thoughtless turn shou'd cruelly reveal,</L>

<L>Nor vainly try, with self-imagin'd charms,</L>

<L>'Tis Emina's! 'tis her's alone!—</L>
<L>Then to the world, good night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, like the barbed-shafted dart,</L>
<L>It plunges thro' my breast,</L>
<L>Fast bleeds within, my wounded heart,</L>
<L>But here I'll give 'em rest.</L>

<L>O cruel fate! I cannot bear</L>
<L>To look upon her grave;</L>
<L>Strike me to earth, nor longer spare</L>
<L>A love-destracted slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! I feel my blood retire,</L>
<L>My eyes grow dim apace,</L>
<L>The fates have heard my last desire,</L>
<L>We'll in the grave embrace.</L>
