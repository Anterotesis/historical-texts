<P>THERE is no person whose patron∣age a Work of this kind may so properly claim, as Your's; Your pri∣vate life having done so much honour to the moral part, and Your public one such justice to the principal Characters, represented in our Author's writings.</P>
<P>Your action has been a better com∣ment on his Text, than all his Editors have been able to supply. You mark his beauties; They but clear his blots. You impress us with the living spirit; They only present us the dead letter.</P>
<P>There is one striking similarity be∣tween Shakespeare and You, in a very uncommon particular: He is the only Dramatic Writer, who ever alike ex∣celled
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
in Tragedy and Comedy; and we may without flattery venture to af∣fim, That you are the only Performer who ever appeared with equal advan∣tage, both in the Sock and Buskin.</P>
<P>If I had an higher opinion of this Work than I have, I should have still but an higher inducement for addressing it to You.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many writers of our nation, who have by their talents contributed to entertain, inform, or improve our minds, no one has so happily or universally succeeded, as he whom we may justly stile our first, our greatest Poet, Shakespeare. For more than a century and a half, this Author has been the delight of the Ingenious, the text of the Mo∣ralist, and the study of the Philosopher. Even his cotemporary writers have ingenuously yielded their plaudit to his fame, as not presuming it could lessen theirs, set at so great a distance. Such superior excellence could never be brought into a comparative light; and jealousy is dumb, when competition must be vain. For him, then, they chearfully twined the laurel-wreath, and unrepining placed it on his brow; where it will ever bloom, while sense, taste, and natural feelings of the heart, shall remain amongst the characteristics of this, or any other nation, that can be able to construe his language. He is a Classic, and cotemporary with all ages.</P>
<Q><L>True Nature's Drama represents all time;</L>
<L>Though old the last, the first retains its prime.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>But amidst all this burst of applause, one single discordant voice is faintly heard. Voltaire has stood forth his opponent. One might imagine such a writer to have had taste enough to relish his <HI>poetical beauties,</HI> at least, tho' possibly some doubt might arise about his sympathy with his <HI>moral ones.</HI> But he unfairly tries him by Pe∣dant laws, which our Author either did not know, or regarded not. His compositions are a distinct species of the Drama; and not being an imitation of the Greek one, cannot be justly said to have infringed its rules. Shakespeare is a <HI>model,</HI> not a <HI>copy</HI>; he looked into nature, not in∣to books, both for men and works. 'Tis learned ignorance, therefore, to quote the antient ex∣emplars against him. Is there no spring inspired, but Aganippe's font? No raptured vision, but on Parnassus' mount? The Grecian Bards them∣selves had conceived a more liberal notion, in this particular, who, by making <HI>Phoebus</HI> the God of Poetry, seem to have acknowledged in∣spiration to be universal.</P>
<P>But as it may shew more impartiality upon this subject, to oppose one French authority to another, I shall here quote against M. Voltaire, the Abbé Le Blanc's opinion of our Author, in his <HI>Letters on the English Nation,</HI> written to his Friend.
<Q>He is, says he, of all Writers, an∣tient or modern, the most of an original. He is truly a great genius, and Nature has endowed him with powers to shew it. His imagination is rich and strong: he paints whatever he sees, and embellishes whatever he describes. The Loves in the train of Ve∣nus are not represented with more grace, in
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
the Pictures of Albanus, than this Poet gives to those that attend on Cleopatra, in his de∣scription of the pomp with which that Queen presents herself to Mark Antony, on the banks of the Cydnus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The reputation of this Author is so great, that I shall not be surprized if you suspect me of exaggeration in this account of him. Those of our nation who have ever men∣tioned him, have been content to praise, <HI>with∣out being capable of judging sufficiently of his merits.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To the further honour of our Author be it said, that a Lady <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> of distinguished merit has lately appeared a champion in his cause, against this <HI>minor critic,</HI> this <HI>minute philosopher,</HI> this <HI>fly upon a pillar of St. Paul</HI>'s. It was her example which has stirred up my emulation to this at∣tempt; for I own that I am ambitious of the honour of appearing to think, at least, though I despair of the success of writing, like her.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope, in the Preface to his edition of this Author, says,
<Q>Of all the English Poets, Shakespeare must be confessed to be the fairest and fullest subject for Criticism, and to afford the most numerous, as well as most conspi∣cuous, instances, both of beauties and blemishes, of all sorts.</Q>
And again:
<Q>I cannot, how∣ever, but mention some of his principal and characteristic excellencies; for which, not∣withstanding his defects, he is justly and deservedly elevated above all other Dra∣matic Writers.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8"/>He might have added the following obser∣vation, from Longinus, to his remarks, who says, that
<Q>In reading Homer, Plato, or any other of the great geniuses of antiquity; whenever we happen to meet with passages which appear to be unintelligible or absurd, we ought fairly to conclude, that were they alive to explain themselves in those places, we should to our confusion be convinced, that the ignorance or error lay in our own conceptions alone.</Q>
Horace, too, may be re∣ferred to upon this occasion, who indulgently says, that <HI>The blaze of fine writing gilds o'er its blots.</HI> Such was the candor, such the modesty, and such the deference, shewn by Antient Com∣mentators to the works of literature or genius. The brightness of the sun concealed its spots from them; but second-hand critics, to speak in the words of a modern Author, <HI>peer through a smoked glass to observe them.</HI></P>
<P>The learned and ingenious Doctor Johnson has given us a just and beautiful simile, on this subject:
<Q>The works of a correct and re∣gular writer, says he, is a garden accurately formed, and diligently planted; varied with shades, and scented by flowers. The com∣position of Shakespeare is a forest, in which oaks extend their branches, and pines tower in the air, interspersed sometimes with weeds and brambles, and sometimes affording shelter to myrtles and roses; filling the eye with awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endless diversity.</Q></P>
<P>This last-mentioned Editor is the only one who has considered Shakespeare's writings in a
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
moral light; and therefore I confess myself of opinion that he has best understood them, by thus pointing to their highest merit, and noblest excellence. And from several passages in the Doctor's Preface, particularly where he says, that
<Q>From his writings, indeed, a system of <HI>social duties</HI> may be selected; for he who thinks reasonably, must think <HI>morally</HI>;</Q>
as well as from frequent reflections of my own, respecting the oeconomical conduct of life and manners, which have always arisen in my mind on the perusal of Shakespeare's works, I have ventured to assume the task of placing his Ethic merits in a more conspicuous point of view, than they have ever hitherto been pre∣sented in to the Public.</P>
<P>My difficulty will not be <HI>what to find,</HI> but <HI>what to chuse,</HI> amidst such a profusion of sweets, and variety of colours; nay, sometimes, how to separate the moral from the matter, in this Author's writings; which are often so con∣texted, that, to continue Doctor Johnson's allegory above quoted, they may be compared to an intermixture of the physic with the kitchen garden, where both food and medi∣cine may be culled from the same spot.</P>
<P>Shakespeare is not only my Poet, but my Philosopher also. His anatomy of the human heart is delineated from <HI>nature,</HI> not from <HI>me∣taphysics</HI>; referring immediately to our intui∣tive sense, and not wandering with the school∣men, through the pathless wilds of theory. We not only <HI>see,</HI> but <HI>feel</HI> his dissections just and scientific.—The late ingenious Lord Lyttelton, speaking of Sakespeare, says,
<Q>No author had
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
ever so copious, so bold, so creative an ima∣gination, with so perfect a knowledge of the passions, the humours, and sentiments of man∣kind. He painted all characters, from heroes and kings, down to inn-keepers and peasants, with equal truth, and equal force. If human nature were quite destroyed, and no monu∣ment left of it, except his Works, other Beings might learn what man was, from those writings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dialogues of the Dead.</NOTE>.</Q>
And Ben Johnson had long before said of him:
<Q><L>Nature herself was proud of his designs,</L>
<L>And joyed to wear the dressings of his lines.</L></Q></P>
<P>Shakespeare seems to possess that happy and peculiar kind of superiority over all other Dramatic Authors, that the ancient poets and historians confessedly bear above the modern ones, with regard to the genuine characters, manners, and sentiments, of the persons exhibited in their respective writings. In the first, we see the <HI>men of Nature</HI>; in the latter, but <HI>the children of the Schools.</HI></P>
<P>The world at present is held more in tram∣mels, than it formerly was.—From our modes of education, policies, and breeding, our con∣duct and demeanor are become more sophisti∣cate, our minds less candid, and our actions more disguised. Our modern literary painters represent us such as we appear; but the genuine unadulterate heart can be moved by no affection, allied by no sympathy, with such factitious personages, such puppets of polity, such automata of modern refinement. Hence, love, friendship, patriotism, are long since be∣come
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
the obsolete sentiments of chivalry and romance. But in all the representations of Shakespeare, we are sensible of a connection; his whole Dramatis Personae seem to be <HI>our acquaintance and countrymen</HI>; while in most other exhibitions, they appear to be <HI>strangers and foreigners.</HI> Doctor Johnson, upon com∣paring the Tragedy of Cato with one of our Author's plays, says justly, that
<Q>Addison speaks the language of <HI>Poets,</HI> but Shake∣speare that of <HI>Men.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Doctor Warburton says,
<Q>Of all the literary exercitations of speculative men, whether designed for the use or entertainment of the world, there are none of so much impor∣tance, or what are more of our immediate concern, than those which let us into a knowledge of our nature. Others may exer∣cise the reason, or amuse the imagination; but these only can improve the heart, and form the mind to wisdom. Now, in this science our Shakespeare is confessed to oc∣cupy the foremost place; whether we con∣sider the amazing sagacity with which he investigates every hidden spring and wheel of human action; or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge, in the just and lively paintings which he has given us of all our passions, appetites, and pursuits. These afford a lesson, which can never be too often repeated, or too strongly incul∣cated.</Q></P>
<P>Shaftsbury, though severe, I think rather too much so, against Shakespeare's faults, al∣lows, that
<Q>By the justness of his moral, the
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
aptness of his descriptions, and the plain and natural turn of several of his characters, he pleases his audience, and gains their ear, <HI>without a single bribe from luxury or vice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Author's poetical beauties have been already selected, though they needed it not, as they are undoubtedly so striking as scarcely to require the being particularly pointed out to any Reader capable of conceiving or relishing them; but a single line, sometimes a word, in many instances throughout his Works, may convey a hint, or impress a sentiment upon the heart, if properly marked, which might pos∣sibly be overlooked, while curiosity is attend∣ing to the fable, or the imagination transported with the splendor of diction, or sublimity of images.</P>
<P>There is a Moral sometimes couched in his Fable, which whenever I have been able to discover, I have pointed out to the Reader; and from those pieces where this excellence is deficient in the Argument, as particularly in his Historical Plays, where poetical justice cannot always obtain, human life not being the whole of our existence, I have given his moral and instruction in detail, by quoting the passages as they happen to lie detached, or referring to the scope and tenor of the dialogue.</P>
<P>In these remarks and observations I have not restricted myself to morals purely ethic, but have extended my observations and reflections to whatever has reference to the general oeco∣nomy of life and manners, respecting prudence, polity, decency, and decorum; or relative to the
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
tender affections and fond endearments of hu∣man nature; more especially regarding those moral duties which are the truest source of mortal bliss—domestic ties, offices, and obliga∣tions.</P>
<P>This code of morality has an advantage over any other of the kind, on account of its not being conducted systematically. In all books that treat upon these subjects, the precepts are disposed methodically, under separate heads or chapters; as Ambition, Bravery, Constancy, De∣votion, and so on to the end of the alphabet; which mode, though useful on account of re∣ferences, or as a common-place book, cannot be near so entertaining, and consequently so well able to answer the <HI>utile dulci,</HI> as a work of this sort, where the documents rise out of the action immediately before our eyes, and are constantly varying with the quick shifting of scenes, per∣son, and subjects; where love sometimes fol∣lows war, jealousy succeeds friendship, parsi∣mony liberality; and so proceeding throughout the intire <HI>quicquid agunt homines</HI> of human life.</P>

<HEAD>THE MORALITY OF SHAKESPEARE's DRAMA ILLUSTRATED.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The TEMPEST.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Play, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, which in all the latter editions immediately follows it, are considered by Dr. Warburton,
<Q>as the noblest effort of that sub∣lime and amazing imagination, peculiar to Shake∣speare, which soars above the bounds of Nature, without forsaking Sense; or, more properly, car∣ries Nature along with it, beyond her terrestrial limits.</Q></P>
<P>He has, indeed, in both these exhibitions, created Beings out of all visible existence; or, as he has him∣self most beautifully expressed it,
<Q><L>Given to airy Nothing</L>
<L>A local habitation, and a name.</L></Q>
Yet by the powers of his genius has he contrived to make these chimeras of his brain think, act, and speak, in a manner which appears so suited to the anomalous personages his magic has conjured up, that
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>
we readily adopt them into the scale of Nature, from a presumption, that were they really to exist, they would probably resemble the characters which his wand has endowed them with.</P>
<P>These two plays are generally supposed to have been the first and second of his writing; though I believe there are no dates remaining, to confirm this opinion; which can therefore be founded only on the idea, that his youthful imagination must naturally be thought to have been more sportive and exuberant, than his riper judgment might have permitted the indulgence of. And here, indeed,
<Q><L>She wantons, as in her prime,</L>
<L>And plays at will her virgin fancies:</L></Q>
though, if I may be allowed the liberty of a criti∣cism about this matter, I should be rather inclined to suppose this Play to have been one of his latter performances, as all the <HI>unities</HI> are so strictly pre∣served in it.</P>
<P>But though both these pieces possess all the <HI>lesser merits</HI> of poesy, they are not so much suited to the pur∣pose of my present undertaking, especially the second, as several others of the same author; for the most material events, in both, being principally conducted by <HI>machinery,</HI> or supernatural agency, produce rather astonishment than reflection: so that unless we adopt Dr. Johnson's remark, in the first scene of the Tem∣pest,
<Q>it may be observed of Gonzalo, that being the only good man that appears with the King, he is the only one who preserves his chearfulness in the wreck, or his hope on the island,</Q>
there is not so much to be collected from them, as I could wish, to be placed to the score of Morality. However, all that can be extracted from either, referrible to this head, shall be diligently pointed out to the reader. With this view I shall lay the Fable of this Play before my reader, for the sake of the Moral, which may be so fairly deduced from it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="19"/>Prospero, a duke of Milan, having been ex∣pelled his dominion, by the usurpation of his brother Anthonio, confederated with Alonzo, a king of Na∣ples, is committed to the mercy of the winds and waves, in a rotten bark, accompanied only by his daughter, Miranda, a child of three years old; but has had the good fortune to escape, and be landed on an uninhabited island; where the first scene is laid, and the intire action continued, during the whole representation.</P>
<P>About twelve years after this event, Anthonio, with Alonzo, Ferdinand his son, and other attendants, being on a voyage together, are driven out of their course, by a storm, and wrecked upon this island, but escape alive on shore; where the Prince, meeting with Miranda, falls in love with her, and a reci∣procal passion is conceived on her part, also.</P>
<P>Prospero, having thus got his enemies within his power, on their repentance, generously forgives them their cruelty and injustice, recovers his dukedom again, and the marriage of the lovers confirms an alliance on both sides.</P>
<P>From this short story I think the following <HI>general Moral</HI> will naturally result: That the ways, the justice, and the goodness of Providence, are so frequently manifested towards mankind, even in this life, that it should ever encourage an honest and a guiltless mind to form hopes, in the most forlorn situations; and ought also to warn the wicked never to rest assured in the false confidence of wealth or power, against the natural abhorrence of vice, both in God and man.</P>
<P>Many of the unforeseen events of life, which ap∣pear to us but accident or contingency, may possibly be parts of the secret workings of Provi∣dence,
<Q>All chance direction which we cannot see;</Q>
and have oftener been remarked rather as chastise∣ments of vice, than as reliefs from misery. We are
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
sensible in our own nature, of a stronger impulse to resent the first, than even to commiserate the latter. How much higher, then, must this sentiment rise, in the Author of that very nature! In wretchedness there is no contagion, 'tis but particular and tempo∣rary: the effects of vice are general and eternal.</P>
<P>Part of a speech in this play may be better quoted here, than elsewhere, as it refers so immediately to this subject.</P>
<Q><STAGE>ARIEL, <HI>speaking to the Conspirators.</HI></STAGE>
<L>But remember,</L>
<L>For that's my business to you, that you three</L>
<L>From Milan did supplant good Prospero;</L>
<L>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</L>
<L>Him and his innocent child; for which foul deed,</L>
<L>The Powers, <HI>delaying, not forgetting,</HI> have</L>
<L>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,</L>
<L>Against your peace. Thee, of thy son, Alonzo,</L>
<L>They have bereft; and do pronounce, by me,</L>
<L>Lingering perdition, worse than any death</L>
<L>Can be at once, shall step by step attend</L>
<L>You and your ways; whose wrath to guard you from,</L>
<L>(Which here in this most desolate isle else falls</L>
<L>Upon your heads) is nothing but <HI>heart's sorrow,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And a clear life ensuing</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act III. Scene iv.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>Let us now proceed to the particular maxims and sentiments which occur from the several parts of the Dialogue.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="act">
<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Miranda, speaking of the shipwreck, thus ex∣presses her sympathetic feelings for the wretched.</P>
<Q><L>O! I have suffered</L>
<L>With those that I saw suffer: A brave vessel,</L>
<L>(Who had, no doubt, some noble creatures in her)</L>
<L>Dash'd all to pieces. O! <HI>the cry did knock</HI></L>
<L><HI>Against my very heart.</HI> Poor souls, they perish'd!</L>
<L>Had I been any God of power, I would</L>
<L>Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere</L>
<L>It should the <HI>good ship</HI> so have swallowed, and</L>
<L>The freighted souls within her.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="5" REF="21"/>There is something in the fond expression of <HI>good ship,</HI> in the last line but one, which strikes me with an idea of a peculiar tenderness in her compassion for the unhappy sufferers.</P>
<P>Prospero, confessing the mad folly of trusting his reins of administration into other hands, says,
<Q><L>The Government I cast upon my brother,</L>
<L><HI>And to my State grew stranger.</HI></L></Q>
And again, speaking of the same person,
<Q><L>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</L>
<L>How to deny them; whom to advance, and whom</L>
<L>To trash for over-topping; new created</L>
<L>The creatures that were mine; I say, or changed them,</L>
<L>Or else new formed them; having both the key</L>
<L>Of officer and office, set all things in the state</L>
<L>To what tune pleased his ear; <HI>that now he was</HI></L>
<L><HI>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And sucked my verdure out on't.</HI></L></Q>
In continuation,
<Q><L>And my trust,</L>
<L>Like a good parent, did beget of him</L>
<L>A falsehood in its contrary as great</L>
<L>As my trust was; which had, indeed, no limit:</L>
<L>A confidence <HI>sans</HI> bound. He being thus lorded,</L>
<L>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</L>
<L>But what my power might else exact; like one,</L>
<L>Who having, unto truth, by telling oft,</L>
<L>Made such a sinner of his memory,</L>
<L>To credit his own lie, he did believe</L>
<L>He was, indeed, the Duke; from substitution,</L>
<L>And executing the outward face of Royalty,</L>
<L>With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing,</L>
<L>To have no screen between the part he played,</L>
<L>And him he played it for, he needs will be</L>
<L>Absolute Milan.</L></Q></P>
<P>In this account of the Duke's weakness, with the natural consequences attending it, the Poet has af∣forded a proper lesson to princes, never to render themselves cyphers in their government, by too dan∣gerous a confidence in their favourites; but ever to consider those persons, to whom they depute the se∣veral offices of State, as <HI>ministers,</HI> in the <HI>literal</HI> sense of the word, only, not in the <HI>political</HI> one.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="22"/>When Prospero describes the hazards and difficul∣ties of his forlorn voyage, Miranda tenderly ex∣claims,
<Q><L>Alack! what trouble</L>
<L>Was I then to you?</L></Q>
To which he, in a kind of extasy of fondness, re∣plies,
<Q><L>O! a cherubim</L>
<L>Thou wast, that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,</L>
<L>Infused with a fortitude from Heaven,</L>
<L>(When I have decked the sea with drops full salt;</L>
<L>Under my burden groaned;) which raised in me</L>

<P>Here the Poet finely points to that virtue of true manhood, which serves to strengthen our fortitude and double our activity, when objects, whom the ties of Nature, or the sympathy of affections, have en∣deared to us, require our solace or assistance in distress or danger.

<P>Here the too general dissipations of life are hinted at, and those parents censured, who transfer the pious duty of their children's education to merce∣nary preceptors; except in the meaner articles of it, the arts, exercises, and sciences. Too few attend to the higher and more interesting charge, of forming the mind and directing the heart to their proper objects; and fewer still, in deputing it to others, seem to regard the chief requisites, of character, or capacity, in those they intrust with this office, look∣ing upon competent scholarship to be alone suffi∣cient.</P>
<P>But a liberal education, as far as it extends in Col∣leges and Schools, does not always give a liberal

<Q>Grow with our growth, and strengthen with our strength.</Q>

<P>This passage furnishes a prudent and necessary reflection to the mind of the reader, that man's suc∣cess in life often depends upon some lucky and critical occasion, which, suffered to slip by, may ne'er return again.

<P>Doctor Johnson, in a note upon this passage, has given us the traditionary system of the Hebrews re∣lative to the Fallen Angels; which has afforded me a hint, that tempts me to consider the tenor of this scene in a more interesting light, by observing upon the impatience of Ariel, a condemned spirit, claiming, under his servitude, the <HI>promised redemption,</HI> before he had fulfilled the commands of his master. This allusion, whether Shakespeare intended it or no, is so obvious, that there would not require the

<P>Gonzalo, comforting and cheering up the spirits of his companions in the wreck, speaks with a be∣coming resignation and proper gratitude towards Providence:
<Q><L>Beseech you, Sir, be merry—you have cause,</L>
<L>So have we all, of joy! for our escape</L>
<L>Is much beyond our loss: our hint of woe</L>

<P>An uncouth or severe manner of giving reproof, or offering advice, is very justly, and with equal good sense and tenderness, reflected upon by Gon∣zalo, in the following passage:

<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Trinculo most humourously ridicules the passion of the English for strange sights, in the following re∣flection, on seeing Caliban lying asleep on the ground, whom he takes for a dead sea-monster, just cast ashore by the working of the waves.
<Q>Were I in England, now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holy-day fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster <HI>make a man</HI>; any strange beast there <HI>makes a man.</HI> When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.</Q>
<PB N="9" REF="25"/>
Not, however, that this foible can fairly be in∣duced against us, as a national reflection, by any means; for it is not peculiar to this, or any other particular people, but will be found to be the com∣mon disposition and idle curiosity of mankind, in general. There is another piece of sarcasm, also, thrown out, in the same speech, as unjust as the former: <HI>When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar.</HI> No nation on the globe is more distin∣guished for charity, humanity, and benevolence, than the English are, at present. And this must have been always their characteristic; for manners may refine, but cannot create, virtues. Polishing may give taste, but feelings come from nature.</P>
<P>After Trinculo has recovered from his fright, and finds Caliban to be but an harmless savage, so very simple as to believe Stephano to be the Man in the Moon; he says,
<Q>By this good light, this is a very shallow monster—<HI>I afraid of him?</HI> a very shallow monster. The man i' th' Moon? a most poor credulous monster.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis to be observed, here, that he was not charged with having been afraid, nor did any one know of it, but himself; and it was this very consciousness that forced such a bravado from him. This is Doctor Warburton's remark. 'Tis a just one, and may be rendered general, by observing, that, upon all occasions, too prompt a defence of ourselves, is a sort of self-accusation.</P>

<L>Or night kept chained below—</L></Q>
<P>A little after, old Prospero, being better acquainted with the fallibilities of human nature than the young lovers were, repeats the same caution to Ferdinand, again:
<Q><L>Look, thou be true; do not give dalliance</L>
<L>Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw</L>

<Q><STAGE>Theseus <HI>to</HI> Hermia.</STAGE>
<L><HI>To you your father should be as a God,</HI></L>
<L>One that composed your beauties; yea, and one</L>
<L>To whom you are but as a form in wax</L>
<L>By him imprinted; and within his power</L>
<L>To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</L></Q>
<P>In this speech, the pious notion of the Antients, with regard to this relation, while genuine Nature was their sole Preceptor, is fully expressed. Here the duty of children to their parents, is indeed car∣ried to the height; and yet, methinks, not at all too far. They are the objects of our earliest affections, of our first deference, of our primary obligations. Even superstition, in this case, as far at least as im∣plicit obedience extends, exceeds not true devotion.</P>
<P>The Decalogue was originally written on two ta∣bles; five in each. The first refers solely to Reli∣gion; the second, to Morality, only. To honour our parents, therefore, as falling within the former line of obligations, is, by this distinction, made one
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
of our <HI>pious</HI> duties; as through them we honour the Creator, who ordained this relation between us. This precept, then, should seem to have a double tie upon us, as partaking both of <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>morals</HI>; and there∣fore, however the latter bond may chance to be cancelled, the first ought never to be dispensed with.</P>
<P>In fine, there is something so fond and endearing in the idea and exercise of a child's obedience and deference towards a parent, that how rotten must the root be, or how blighted the branches, if such a tree should fail of producing its natural fruit!</P>
<P>Thus far, by way of general reflection, only; for I must, notwithstanding, admit, that the particular instance of the daughter's compliance, exacted by the father, in this piece, of resigning an husband of her own choice, <HI>upon equal terms,</HI> and accepting another, chosen arbitrarily for her, <HI>by caprice merely,</HI> was too severe a trial of obedience. Egeus here, like Abraham, would sacrifice his child at the altar, not only without the command of God, but contrary to his express purpose, proclaimed aloud by the voice of Nature, and further confirmed from the deduc∣tions of virtuous affection, free will, and rational election.</P>
<P>When I said that the duty of a child was <HI>natural,</HI> I did not mean to invest the parent with an authority which <HI>was not so</HI>; and I cannot blame Hermia, therefore, upon the severe laws of Athens being de∣clared to her, for the chaste and spirited resolution she frames to herself on that occasion.</P>
<Q><L>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</L>
<L>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</L>

</SP></Q>
<P><PB N="18" REF="34"/>Hermia had used no arts, no coquetry, to allure her lover from her; for, as she expresses it, just after, in the same dialogue,
<Q>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</Q>
She had, indeed, happened to have done her an <HI>injury,</HI> but <HI>no wrong</HI>; and therefore the forsaken maid shews her justice in plaining her own ill fortune, only, without expressing the least manner of resent∣ment against her unoffending rival.</P>
<P>Hermia, in the same scene, alludes to the magic power of love, which concenters all our ideas in one, making us prefer a cottage to a palace, and a desert to a grove, according to the situation or circum∣stances of the object of our affections. After having declared the purpose of flying her country with her lover, she adds,
<Q><L>Before the time I did Lysander see,</L>
<L>Seemed Athens like a Paradise to me.</L>
<L>O then, what graces in my love do dwell,</L>
<L>That he hath turned a heaven into hell?</L></Q></P>
<P>And Helena, afterwards, carries on the same idea, in the following lines:
<Q><L>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</L>
<L>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</L>
<L>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</L>
<L>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind;</L>
<L>Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste:</L>
<L>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste,</L>
<L>And therefore is love said to be a child,</L>
<L>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</L></Q></P>
<P>Theseus too, in a passage of his speech, in the first Scene of the Fifth Act of this Play, accords with the above sentiment:
<Q><L>While the lover all as frantic</L>
<L>Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.</L></Q></P>
<P>And Shakespeare has hinted a moral, on this latter subject, with regard to irregular or ill-placed affec∣tion, as Dr. Warburton has justly observed,
<Q>by as fine a metamorphosis as any in Ovid,</Q>
in the last line of the following speech, in the second Scene

<P>The case of such <HI>unfortunate</HI> persons,
<Q><L>Of those whom Phoebus, in his ire,</L>
<L>Hath <HI>blasted</HI> with poetic sire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swift.</NOTE>,</L></Q>
is certainly very hard. Persons who apply their minds to letters, must unavoidably neglect their temporal concerns; and those who employ their time in the reformation or entertainment of the world, should be supported by it—Not by merely accidental and precarious emoluments, but upon some more permanent foundation; like the Clergy, who have had a provision made for them, for the same reason as above; and the name of <HI>Clerk,</HI> tho' now appropriated to the latter, was formerly the common appellation of both. The honour of such an establishment would be considerable to a State, and the expence but small—<HI>for the numbers are but few.</HI></P>
<P>Theseus expresses a just sentiment in a prince, when Philostrate, the Master of his Revels, objects to his being present at a play, which the affections of the lowest rank of the Athenian citizens had framed for the celebration of his nuptials.</P>

<HEAD>THE Two Gentlemen of Verona.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fable of this Play has no more moral in it, than the former, nor does it make us much amends, either by the number, or variety of its documents. I would, therefore, have passed it by, as some of the editors have done, on the suppo∣sition of its not being one of Shakespeare's; but that I thought any thing which had ever been imputed to that author, had a right to claim a place in this Work; unless the rejection of it were established upon better grounds, than the diversity of opinions about its authenticity, among the Commentators.</P>
<P>And, indeed, were I to offer any doubt upon this point, myself, it should not be so much from the objections adduced by the editors, as on account of the unnatural inconsistency of character, in the person of Protheus; who, in the first Act, and during above half the second, appears to stand in the most amiable and virtuous lights, both of morals and manhood, as a fond lover, and a faithful friend; and yet suddenly belies his fair seemings, by an infidelity toward the first object, and a treachery with regard to the second. 'Tis true, indeed, that in the latter end he expresses a sort of contrition for his crimes; but yet this still seems to remain equivocal; as it does not appear to have arisen from any remorse of conscience, or abhorrence of his baseness, but rather from a disappointment in his pursuit, and an open detection of his villainy.</P>
<P>There are but few instances of this kind, that I remember to have met with, throughout the drama of Shakespeare; for however he may sport, as he often does, with the three <HI>unities</HI> of Aristotle, <HI>time,
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
place,</HI> and <HI>action,</HI> he seldom sins against a fourth, which I am surprised the Critics have not added, as being worth them all—namely, that of <HI>character</HI>; the tenor of which is generally preserved, from first to last, in all his works. This consistency is re∣quired in the epic, and why not insisted on in the dramatic poem, I cannot conceive.</P>
<P>I am venturing, I own, beyond my purpose; but I am tempted here, upon mentioning his breach of the unities, to observe, that the Commentators do our author great injustice, to examine him by the cold rules of artful construction. Shakespeare's writ∣ings resemble the antient music, which consisted in <HI>melody</HI> alone, without regard to <HI>harmony,</HI> which is a science of much later invention; and it has been remarked, that the original airs of every country, which charm a natural ear most, have been those that give offence to <HI>modern composers,</HI> by an utter neglect of the <HI>counter-point.</HI> The compositions of our Bard have the same beauty, with the same defect. He ought, therefore, never to be considered but under the description which Milton has given of him;
<Q><L>Our sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,</L>
<L>Warbling his native wood-notes wild.</L></Q>
Would they restrain him within the precincts of art, the height, the depth of whose imagination and creative genius found even the extent of Nature too streightly bounded for it to move in?</P>
<Q>Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new.</Q>
<P>Like an eastern monarch, his word was law, his will and pleasure edicts and decrees. But there are certain <HI>mechanists</HI> in criticism, who have no other way of judging, but by applying the <HI>rule</HI> and <HI>compass</HI>; like antient gardeners, who trimmed their forest-trees into cones and cylinders, and reduced winding brooks to square canals. A man must be <HI>born</HI> a critic, as well as a poet; but, at this rate, he may be <HI>bred</HI> both.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression to the subject which lies more properly before us, at present.</P>

SCENE I.</HEAD>
<P>The great necessity and benefit of Travel are properly recommended, and marked by apt phrase, in the first speech here; which opening, with the addition of a few other passages, seems to promise more than, I am sorry to say, the rest of the piece is responsible for. And it is this circumstance which has induced the critics to suspect this Play not to have been originally one of Shakespeare's, but only re∣vised and enriched with fragments, by him; as it may be deemed to be not <HI>a jewel,</HI> but only <HI>a lump of paste,</HI> set round <HI>with sparks.</HI></P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Valentine.</SPEAKER>
<L>Cease to persuade, my loving Protheus;</L>
<L>Home-keeping youth <HI>have ever</HI> homely wits—</L>
<L>Were't not affection chains thy tender days</L>
<L>To the sweet glances of thy honoured love,</L>
<L>I rather would intreat thy company</L>
<L>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</L>
<L>Than (living <HI>dully sluggaraized,</HI> at home)</L>
<L>Wear out thy youth in <HI>shapeless idleness</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forming neither manners, nor character.</NOTE>.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The tenderness and solicitudes of friendship are well and fondly expressed in the reply:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Protheus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu;—</L>
<L>Think on thy Protheus, when thou haply seest</L>
<L>Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel—</L>
<L>Wish me partaker in thy happiness,</L>
<L>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,</L>
<L><HI>If ever danger do environ thee,</HI></L>
<L>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayer;</L>
<L>For I will be thy bead's-man, Valentine.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P><HI>If ever danger do environ thee</HI>—This line strikes me with a peculiar beauty. Protheus desires to be con∣sidered as a sharer in his friend's weal or woe, during absence; the first he mentions without any reserve,
<Q><L>Wish me partaker in thy happiness,</L>
<L>When thou dost meet good hap—</L></Q>
But when he comes to speak of the latter, he ap∣pears to catch himself up, as if alarmed even at the idea of his danger, and seems to have begun his prayers for him, already.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="43"/>But not to quit the first subject hinted above, only to re-assume it again, I shall introduce a speech from the fourth Scene following, though somewhat out of its place, here; where Panthion, speaking to the father of Protheus, tells him the opinion of another person about him and his son.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Panthion.</SPEAKER>
<L>He wondered that your lordship</L>
<L>Would suffer him to spend his life at home,</L>
<L>While other men of slender reputation</L>
<L>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out;</L>
<L>Some to the wars, to try their fortunes there;</L>
<L>Some to discover islands far away:</L>
<L>Some to the studious Universities.</L>
<L>For any, or for all these exercises,</L>
<L>He said that Protheus, your son, was meet;</L>
<L>And did request me to importune you</L>
<L>To let him spend his time no more at home;</L>
<L>Which would be great impeachment to his age,</L>
<L>In having known no travel in his youth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthonie.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nor need'st thou much importune me to that,</L>
<L>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</L>
<L>I have considered well his loss of time,</L>
<L><HI>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Not being tried and tutored in the world.</HI></L>
<L>Experience is by industry achieved,</L>
<L>And perfected by the <HI>swift</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Would not <HI>shew</HI> be a fitter word, in this pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e?</NOTE> course of time.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>But to return to the first Scene, again. In this and many of the subsequent ones, the several parts of which shall be quoted as they follow in order, to prevent the interruption of the subject, our Author has truly described the nature, the effects, the anxieties, the weaknesses, the extravagancies, and the miseries, of the passion of love, most philoso∣phically, poetically, and experimentally.</P>
<P>Valentine, persuading Protheus to quit his mis∣tress, and accompany him on his travels, says:
<Q><L>To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;</L>
<L>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth</L>
<L>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights—</L>
<L>If haply won, perhaps an hapless gain;</L>
<L>If lost, why then a grievous labour won;</L>
<L>However, but a folly bought with wit;</L>
<L>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="44"/>Love is your master, for he masters you;</L>
<L>And he that is so yoked by a fool,</L>
<L>Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valentine.</SPEAKER>
<L>And writers say, as the most forward bud</L>
<L>Is eaten by the canker, ere it blows;</L>
<L>Even so by love the young and tender wit</L>
<L>Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud;</L>
<L>Losing his verdure even in the prime,</L>
<L>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</L>
<STAGE>Protheus, <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<L>He after honour hunts, I after love;</L>
<L>He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;</L>
<L>I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.</L>
<L>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me;</L>
<L>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</L>
<L>War with good counsel, set the world at nought,</L>
<L>Make wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Valentine, after his falling in love, to Protheus:
<Q><SP>
<L>I have done penance for contemning love;</L>
<L>Those high imperious thoughts have punished me</L>
<L>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans;</L>
<L>With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs—</L>
<L>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</L>
<L>Love hath chaced sleep from my enthralled eyes,</L>
<L>And made them watchers of my own heart's sorrow.</L>
<L>O, gentle Protheus, love's a mighty lord,</L>
<L>And hath so humbled me, as I confess</L>
<L>There is no woe to his correction;</L>
<L>Nor to his service, no such joy on earth.</L>
<L>Now no discourse, except it be of love;</L>
<L>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep,</L>
<L>Upon the very naked name of love. . . . . .</L>

<L>Pity the dearth that I have pined in,</L>
<L>By longing for that food so long a time.</L>

<L>But when his fair course is not hindered,</L>
<L>He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,</L>

<P>There are two other passages in this Play, which I have not included among the above number of quo∣tations; because, though they relate to the same sub∣ject, yet not falling within the description of the passion, but the artful or sinister conduct of it, only, I have reserved to a place by themselves.</P>
<P>The first is, where Valentine replies to the Duke, who asks his advice how to gain a coy mistress.</P>

of man. Second nature is more than a match even for the first. In this philosophy lie the manifest and manifold advantages of a good education, which alone forms the different manners allotted to the sexes, rendering men brave, and preserving women chaste.

<P>In this passage Valentine is justly commended f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his proper and becoming manhood, in vindicatin the right both of his love and honour, at the hazar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his, comparatively, meaner life.

<P>I CANNOT see what moral can be extracted from the fable of this Piece; but as the author of it seems to have thought otherwise, I shall present the reader with his idea on this subject, in his own words; where the Duke passes sentence on Angelo, his deputy, for his double villainy:

<Q><STAGE><HI>Lucio,</HI> on seeing his friend carrying to prison.</STAGE>
<L>Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Claudio.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>From too much liberty,</HI> my Lucio, liberty;</L>
<L>As surfeit is the father of much fast,</L>
<L>So every scope by the immoderate use</L>
<L>Turns to restraint: our natures do pursue,</L>
<L>Like rats that raven down their proper bane,</L>
<L>A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Again, in the next Scene:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<L>We have strict statutes, and most biting laws;</L>
<L>The needful bits and curbs for head-strong steeds;</L>
<L>Which for these nineteen years we have let sleep;</L>
<L>Even like an o'er-grown lion in a cave,</L>
<L>That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,</L>
<L>Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,</L>
<L>Only to stick it in their childrens sight,</L>
<L>For terror, not to use; in time the rod</L>
<L>Becomes more mocked, than feared; so our decrees,</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="52"/>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;</L>
<L>And liberty plucks justice by the nose;</L>
<L>The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart</L>
<L>Goes all decorum.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>And just after, condemning his own neglect, in suffering the people to take such scope, he carries his censure against himself so far, as even to say that he had encouraged them to do so:
<Q><L>For we bid this be done,</L>
<L>When evil deeds have their permissive pass,</L>
<L>And not the punishment.</L></Q></P>
<P>The same reflection is carried on, in the fifth Scene of the Second Act; where some one says,
<Q>Lord Angelo is severe.</Q>
To which Escalus, his colleague in administration, replies,
<Q><L>It is but needful;</L>
<L>Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;</L>
<L>Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to recur back again to the first Act, which I quitted in pursuit of the above argument started there; in the sixth Scene, where Claudio desires his friend to employ his sister to solicit his pardon, he very judiciously urges that peculiar kind of per∣suasiveness, which naturally dwells in youth and innocence:
<Q><L>Acquaint her with the danger of my State;</L>
<L>Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends</L>
<L>To the strict Deputy; bid herself assay him;</L>
<L>I have great hope in That; for in her youth</L>
<L>There is a <HI>prone</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Johnson reads <HI>power,</HI> or <HI>prompt,</HI> either of which epithets would certainly render this passage more intelligible. I prefer the latter expression.</NOTE> and speechless dialect,</L>
<L>Such as moves men!</L></Q></P>
<P>And again, in the last Scene of this first Act, Lucio says to Isabella,
<Q><L>Go to lord Angelo,</L>
<L>And let him learn to know, when maidens foe,</L>
<L>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,</L>
<L>All their petitions are as truly theirs,</L>
<L>As they themselves would owe them.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="53"/>In the same Scene the nature and danger of irre∣solution is well described.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucio.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our doubts are traitors;</L>

<L>By fearing to attempt.</L>

<P>The political arguments for justice, with the humane motives for mercy, are finely contrasted here, between the two Deputies of the State:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Angelo.</SPEAKER>
<L>We must not make a scare-crow of the law,</L>
<L>Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,</L>
<L>And let it keep one shape, 'till custom makes it</L>
<L>Their perch, and not their terror.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Escalus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, but yet</L>
<L>Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,</L>
<L>Than fall and bruise to death. . . . . .</L>
<L>Let but your Honour know,</L>
<L>Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,</L>
<L>That, in the working of your own affections,</L>
<L>Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing,</L>
<L>Or that the resolute acting of your blood</L>
<L>Could have attained the effect of your own purpose;</L>
<L>Whether you had not, sometime in your life,</L>
<L>Erred in this point, which now you censure him,</L>
<L>And pulled the law upon you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Angelo.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,</L>
<L>Another thing to fall. I not deny,</L>
<L>The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,</L>
<L>May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two,</L>
<L>Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,</L>
<L>That justice seizes on. What know the laws,</L>
<L>That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,</L>
<L>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take it,</L>
<L>Because we see it; but what we do not see,</L>
<L>We tread upon, and never think of it.</L>
<L>You may not so extenuate his offence,</L>
<L>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,</L>
<L>When I that censure him, do so offend,</L>
<L>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,</L>

<P>The powerful attractions of virtue and modesty, are finely shewn, in Angelo's conflict and reflections, here. Isabella, having, in the last Scene, received some hope of pardon for her brother, takes leave of the Deputy, with this expression:
<Q><L><HI>Save</HI> your honour!</L>
<STAGE>Angelo <HI>solus.</HI></STAGE>
<L><HI>From thee,</HI> even from thy virtue—</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="57"/>What's this? what's this? Is this her fault, or mine?</L>
<L>The tempter, or the tempted, who sins most?</L>
<L>Not she—nor doth she tempt—but it is I,</L>
<L>That, lying by the violet in the sun,</L>
<L>Do, as the carrion does, not as the flower,</L>
<L>Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be,</L>
<L>That modesty may more betray our sense,</L>
<L>Than woman's lightness? having waste ground enough,</L>
<L>Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,</L>
<L>And pitch our evils there? Oh, fie, fie, fie!</L>
<L>What dost thou? or what art thou, Angelo?</L>
<L>Dost thou desire her foully, for those things</L>
<L>That make her good? Oh, let her brother live—</L>
<L>Thieves for their robbery have authority,</L>
<L>When judges steal themselves. What? do I love her,</L>
<L>That I desire to hear her speak again,</L>
<L>And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?</L>
<L>Oh, cunning enemy, that to catch a saint,</L>
<L>With saints dost bait thy hook? most dangerous</L>
<L>Is that temptation, that doth goad us on</L>
<L>To sin in loving virtue. Ne'er could the Strumpet,</L>
<L>With all her double vigour, art, and nature,</L>
<L>Once stir my temper; but this virtuous Maid</L>

<P>The Duke here, under the character of a friar, in confessing Juliet, gives an admirable lesson on the nature of <HI>contrition,</HI> distinguishing it very properly from <HI>attrition</HI> merely; and, at the same time, ex∣presses a just but severe sentence against a woman's failure in the point of chastity; their education, their manners, and the moral consequences of their frailty, throwing so many more bars in their way, than the modes of the world have opposed to the other sex.</P>

<L>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</L>
<L>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</L>
<L>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth, nor age;</L>
<L>But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</L>
<L>Dreaming on both; for all thy <HI>blasted</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Doctor also reads <HI>blasted,</HI> instead of <HI>blessed.</HI></NOTE> youth</L>
<L>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</L>
<L>Of palsied eld; and when thou'rt old and rich,</L>
<L>Thou hast nor heat, affection, limb, or beauty,</L>
<L>To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this,</L>
<L>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life,</L>
<L>Lye hid more than a thousand deaths; yet death we fear,</L>
<L>That makes these odds all even.</L></Q>
<P>And in the next scene, Isabella, after hinting to her brother at certain base conditions, on which his sentence might be remitted, endeavours to strengthen his resolution to prefer death before dishonour, by somewhat of the same manner of reasoning, as above; but more conclusive and concise:
<Q><L>Oh, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,</L>
<L>Lest thou a feverish life should'st entertain,</L>
<L>And six or seven winters more respect,</L>
<L>Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="61"/>The sense of death is most in apprehension;</L>
<L>And the poor beetle that we tread upon,</L>
<L>In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great,</L>
<L>As when a giant dies.</L></Q></P>
<P>To this suspicion of his weakness he replies, with the spirit becoming a man of honour and vir∣tue:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Claudio.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why give you me this shame?</L>
<L>Think you, I can a resolution fetch</L>
<L>From flowery tenderness? If I must die,</L>
<L>I will encounter darkness as a bride,</L>
<L>And hug it in my arms.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But after having paid this compliment to heroism, Human Nature comes in for its share, in turn; and he then pleads for life, even on the most abject terms:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Claudio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Isabel!</P>
</SP>

<L>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</L>
<L>To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;</L>
<L>This sensible warm motion to become</L>
<L>A kneaded clod; and the <HI>delinquent</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Instead of <HI>delighted.</HI> <BIBL>Johnson.</BIBL></NOTE> spirit</L>
<L>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</L>
<L>In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;</L>
<L>To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,</L>
<L>And blown with restless violence round about</L>
<L>The pendant world; or to be worse than worst</L>
<L>Of those that lawless and uncertain thoughts</L>
<L>Imagine howling; 'tis too horrible!</L>
<L>The weariest and most loathed worldly life,</L>
<L>That age, ach, penury, and imprisonment,</L>
<L>Can lay on Nature, is a paradise,</L>
<L>To what we fear of death.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>What an ignoble sentiment is here expressed, in the four last lines of this speech! and yet the great Maecenas had the same, and declared it very nearly in the same words! What a disgrace to letters! But history describes him to have been a person of fop∣pish and effeminate manners; and 'tis but rarely that the outward character belies the inward one.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="62"/>Isabella's indignation against her brother on this occasion, though it has no relation to the subjects we are upon, yet as it may have an effect in raising the same resentment against vice and meanness, in the minds of my readers, I think it worthy to be in∣serted here:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Isabella.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, you beast!</L>
<L>Oh, faithless coward! Oh, dishonest wretch!</L>
<L>Wilt thou be made a man, out of my vice?</L>
<L>Is't not a kind of incest, to take life</L>
<L>From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?</L>
<L>Heaven grant my mother played my father fair!</L>
<L>For such a warped slip of wilderness</L>
<L>Ne'er issued from his blood—Take my defiance—</L>
<L>Die, perish! might my only bending down,</L>
<L>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed. . . . . .</L>
<L>Oh, fie, fie, fie!</L>
<L>Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade;</L>

<P>In the last speech of this scene, our Author gives us a shocking, but too just description of Slander:

<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<L>No might nor greatness, in Mortality,</L>

<HEAD>ACT IV.</HEAD>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>In the last passage of this Scene, the Duke repeats the same reflection, in still stronger terms:
<Q><L>O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes</L>
<L>Are stuck upon thee. Volumes of report</L>
<L>Run with these false and most contrarious quests</L>
<L>Upon thy doings—thousand 'scapes of wit</L>
<L>Make thee the father of their idle dreams,</L>
<L>And rack thee in their fancies!</L></Q></P>
<P>Such has been the complaint of all ages, even when the scandal was merely <HI>oral</HI>; but how much more intolerable has the offence become, of late years, when obloquy is not only privately spoken, but pub∣licly printed, and openly circulated throughout these kingdoms? The <HI>Freedom</HI> of the Press should be ever

held sacred among us. 'Tis our <HI>Palladium.</HI> But surely, to restrain its <HI>Licentiousness,</HI> can no more hurt the <HI>Liberty</HI> of it, than the chastisement of felony can be said to injure the liberty of the subject.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE X.</HEAD>
<P>When Isabella, upon a supposition of her brother's death, curses Angelo for his perfidy, the Duke re∣proves her in the following words:
<Q><L>This nor hurts him, nor profits you, a jot;</L>
<L>Forbear it, therefore; <HI>give your cause to Heaven.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Shakespeare seems to have wound up the several morals of his characters and dialogue, in this place, with an excellent Christian document, against the rage of malediction, and the passion of revenge; for we find little more in the remainder of it, sufficiently worthy of continuing any further remarks on the Piece.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<P>The forebodings or presentiments of evil, natural to the human mind, are strongly pointed at here. It were in vain to attempt the investigation of this mat∣ter from philosophy, any more than that of prophetic dreams; so that all we have to do, is simply to ac∣quiesce in the fact itself, which repeated experience has sufficiently vouched in too many remarkable in∣stances, to be imputed to common casualty.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Anthonio, Solarino, <HI>and</HI> Salanio.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthonio.</SPEAKER>
<L>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;</L>
<L>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</L>
<L>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</L>
<L>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</L>
<L>I am to learn.—</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Upon which his two friends attempt to account for this impression on his mind, in a very natural manner—as,
<Q>Where a man's treasure is, there will his heart be also.</Q></P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Salanio.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</L>
<L>There where your <HI>Argofies</HI> with portly sail,</L>
<L>Like Signiors and rich Burghers on the flood,</L>
<L>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</L>
<L>Do over-peer the petty traffickers,</L>
<L>That curtsie to them, do them reverence,</L>
<L>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solarino.</SPEAKER>
<L>Believe me, Sir, had I such venture forth,</L>
<L>The better part of my affections would</L>
<L>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="67"/>Plucking the grass <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To throw up into the air.</NOTE>, to know where sits the wind;</L>
<L>Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;</L>
<L>And every object that might make me fear</L>
<L>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,</L>
<L>Would make me sad.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Salanio.</SPEAKER>
<L>My wind, cooling my broth,</L>
<L>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</L>
<L>What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</L>
<L>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</L>
<L>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</L>
<L>And see my wealthy <HI>Andrew</HI> docked in sand,</L>
<L>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs,</L>
<L>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church,</L>
<L>And see the holy edifice of stone,</L>
<L>And not bethink me strait of dangerous rocks?</L>
<L>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</L>
<L>Would scatter all the spices on the stream,</L>
<L>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks;</L>
<L>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</L>
<L>And now worth nothing. Shall I have the thought</L>
<L>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought,</L>
<L>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</L>
<L>But tell not me—I know Anthonio</L>
<L>Is sad to think upon his merchandize.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>But when he denies that any reflection upon the state of his fortune, or that even the passion of love, has wrought this grave effect upon his spirits, they then remain quite at a loss to account farther for it, referring it merely to the peculiarity of his charac∣ter, or particular complexion of mind; which is described and contrasted with one of an opposite cast, with admirable humour:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Solarino.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not in love, neither! Then let's say, you're sad,</L>
<L>Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy</L>
<L>For you to laugh and leap, and say you're merry,</L>
<L>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</L>
<L>Nature hath framed strange fellows, in her time;</L>
<L>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,</L>
<L>And laugh, like parrots, at a bag piper;</L>
<L>And others of such vinegar aspect,</L>
<L>That they'll not shew their teeth, in way of smile,</L>
<L>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Gratiano then coming in, and taking notice of the seriousness of Anthonio's aspect, alike imputes it to the same cause his other friends had done:
<Q><PB N="53" REF="68"/>
<L>You look not well, Signior Anthonio;</L>
<L>You have too much respect upon the world;</L>
<L>They lose it that do buy it with much care.</L>
<L>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which he replies:
<Q><L>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</L>
<L>A stage where every man must play his part;</L>
<L>And mine a sad one.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon this, Gratiano enters into the same hu∣morous description of the different characters of men, as Solarino had done.</P>
<Q><L>Let me play the fool;</L>
<L>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;</L>
<L>And let my liver rather heat with wine,</L>
<L>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</L>
<L>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</L>
<L>Sit like his grandfire cut in alabaster?</L>
<L>Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice</L>
<L>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Anthonio,</L>
<L>(I love thee, and it is my love that speaks)</L>
<L>There are a sort of men, whose visages</L>
<L>Do cream and mantle like a standing pool,</L>
<L>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</L>
<L>With purpose to be drest in an opinion</L>
<L>Of wisdom, gravity profound conceit;</L>
<L>As who should say, "I am Sir Oracle,</L>
<L>"And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!"</L>
<L>O, my Anthonio, I do know of those,</L>
<L>That therefore only are reputed wise,</L>
<L>For saying nothing; who, I'm very sure,</L>
<L>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</L>
<L>Which hearing them would call their <HI>brothers fools</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Scripture text, <HI>He that calleth his brother a fool,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>But fish not with this melancholy bait</L>
<L>For this fool's gudgeon, this opinion.</L></Q>
<P>Another very common character in life is also described in the same scene; though I think not fairly applicable to the person who was capable of making the speech above cited:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Bassanio.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you may seek all day ere you find them; and when you have them, they are not worth the search.</Q></P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="69"/>In the following passage of the same Scene, there is a warmth of affection and generous friendship, fondly and beautifully expressed.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Bassanio <HI>and</HI> Anthonio.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bassanio.</SPEAKER>
<L>To you, Anthonio,</L>
<L>I owe the most in money, and in love;</L>
<L>And from your love I have a warranty</L>
<L>To unburden all my plots and purposes,</L>
<L>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthonio.</SPEAKER>
<L>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</L>
<L>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</L>
<L>Within the eye of honour, be assured,</L>
<L>My purse, my person, my extremest means</L>
<L>Lye all unlocked to your occasions. . . . .</L>
<L>You know me well; and herein spend but time,</L>
<L>To wind about my love with circumstance;</L>
<L>And, out of doubt, you do me now more wrong,</L>
<L>In making question of my uttermost,</L>
<L>Than if you had made waste of all I have.</L>
<L>Then do but say to me what I should do,</L>
<L>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</L>
<L>And I am prest unto it—Therefore, speak. . . . .</L>
<L>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea,</L>
<L>Nor have I money, nor commodity,</L>
<L>To raise a present sum; therefore, go forth;</L>
<L>Try what my credit can in Venice do;</L>
<L>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,</L>
<L>To furnish thee to <HI>Belmont,</HI> to fair <HI>Portia.</HI></L>
<L>Go presently inquire, and so will I,</L>
<L>Where money is; and I no question make,</L>
<L>To have it of my trust, or for my sake.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Again, in the third Scene of Act the Third, the same noble spirit is carried on.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Portia <HI>and</HI> Bassanio.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Portia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?</L>

<L>The dearest friend to me; the kindest man;</L>
<L>The best conditioned—an unwearied spirit</L>
<L>In doing courtesies; and one in whom</L>
<L>The antient Roman honour more appears,</L>
<L>Than any that draws breath in Italy.</L>

<L>What sum owes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Jew?</L>

<L>For me, three thousand ducats.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Portia.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! no more?</L>
<L>Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="70"/>Double six thousand, and then treble that,</L>
<L>Before a friend of this description</L>
<L>Shall lose a hair thro' my Bassanio's fault.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>And from the Fifth Scene of the same Act, an∣other passage may be quoted, which breathes the same strain.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Portia <HI>and</HI> Lorenzo.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lorenzo.</SPEAKER>
<L>Madam, altho' I speak it in your presence,</L>
<L>You have a noble and a true conceit</L>
<L>Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly,</L>
<L>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.</L>
<L>But if you knew on whom you shew this honour,</L>
<L>How true a gentleman you send relief to,</L>
<L>How dear a lover of my lord your husband;</L>
<L>I know, you would be prouder of this work,</L>
<L>Than customary bounty could inforce you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Portia.</SPEAKER>
<L>I never did repent of doing good,</L>
<L>And shall not now; for in companions</L>
<L>That do converse and waste the time together,</L>
<L>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,</L>
<L>There needs must be a like proportion</L>
<L>Of lineaments of manners, and of spirit;</L>
<L>Which makes me think that this Anthonio,</L>
<L>Being the bosom lover of my lord,</L>
<L>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</L>
<L>How little is the cost I have bestowed,</L>
<L>In purchasing the semblance of my soul</L>
<L>From out the state of hellish cruelty!</L>
<L><HI>This comes too near the praising of myself;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Therefore, no more of it.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>There is a becoming reserve and modesty in this last sentence, which gives an additional beauty to the character of Portia. But I must now return again to the First Act, that I may recover the order of the reflections which are made in this Piece.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Here the golden mean is well recommended, by shewing the excess on either side, to be equally bad:
<Q><STAGE>Portia <HI>and</HI> Nerissa.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Portia.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is weary of this great world.</P>

<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER>Nerissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are.

</SP></Q></P>
<P>From thence Portia takes occasion to hint at the inefficacy of good counsel towards governing or restraining our passions:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Portia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good sentences, and well pronounced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nerissa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would be better, if well followed.</P>

<P>If to do, were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes palaces. He is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow my own teaching.

<P>In this Scene, the soliloquy of Launcelot is a strong picture of the mind of man, whenever it de∣bates within itself upon the right or wrong of a question, in which it is any way interested; for in such cases, our passions, even without our conniv∣ance, are apt to plead their own cause; and we but sophisticate, while we think we reason. In all doubt∣ful matters, where the arguments seem to be equally suspended, 'tis prudent ever to suspect that side of the balance to be the lightest, which we find our affec∣tions the most inclined to.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Launcelot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master. The fiend is at my elbow, and tempts me; saying to me, Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot, or good Gobbo, or good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My conscience says, no; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed, honest Gobbo; or, as aforesaid, honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run; scorn running with the heels. Well, the most coura∣geous fiend bids me pack; <HI>via!</HI> says the fiend; away! says the fiend; for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind, says the fiend; and run. Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, my honest friend, Launcelot, being an ho∣nest man's son, or rather, an honest woman's son (for, indeed, my father did something smack; something grow to; he had a kind of taste)—Well, my conscience says, budge not; budge, says the fiend; budge not, says my conscience. Conscience, says I, you counsel ill; fiend, says I, you counsel ill. To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew, my master, who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend; who, saving your reverence, is the devil him∣self. Certainly, the Jew is the very devil <HI>incarnal</HI>; and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew.

<Q><STAGE><HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> on viewing the Caskets, with their mottos.</STAGE>

<L>You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.</L>
<L>What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see—</L>
<L><HI>Who chuseth me, shall gain what many men desire.</HI></L>
<L>What many men desire—That may be meant</L>
<L>Of the fool multitude, that chuse by shew;</L>
<L>Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,</L>
<L>Which pries not to the interior; but, like the martlet,</L>
<L>Builds in the weather on the outward wall,</L>
<L>Even in the force and road of casualty.</L>
<L>I will not chuse what many men desire,</L>
<L>Because I will not jump with common spirits,</L>
<L>And rank me with the barb'rous multitude.</L></Q></P>
<P>And immediately after, in the same speech, he makes a just and noble reflection, distinguishing merit from dignities; or titles <HI>to,</HI> from titles <HI>of,</HI> ho∣nour.</P>
<Q><L>Well then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,</L>
<L>Tell me, once more, what title thou dost bear—</L>
<L><HI>Who chuseth me, shall get as much as he deserves.</HI></L>
<L>And well said too; for who shall go about</L>
<L>To cozen Fortune and be honourable,</L>
<L>Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume</L>
<L>To wear an undeserved dignity—</L>
<L>O that estates, degrees, and offices,</L>
<L>Were not derived corruptly! that clear honour</L>
<L>Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!</L>
<L>How many then should cover, that stand bare?</L>

<HEAD>ACT III. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<P>The great principle of universal charity, which soars above the partial respects of nations or of sects, is strongly, though indirectly, inculcated, in the Jew's speech, here; which, according to this very principle, should be received without prejudice, though proceeding from the mouth of an Alien, and an Infidel.</P>
<P>Shylock, speaking of Anthonio,
<Q>He hath disgraced me, and hindered me of half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his reason? <HI>I am a Jew.</HI> Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt by the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?</Q></P>
<P>As the remainder of the speech exceeds the mo∣deration of Christian ethics, I think proper to stop the Jew's mouth, here.</P>
<P>The same person says something again to the like purport, in the first Scene of Act the Fourth, that ought to awaken our minds to proper sentiments of humanity, upon this subject.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Shylock.</SPEAKER>
<L>You have among you many <HI>a purchased slave</HI>;</L>
<L>Which, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,</L>
<L>You use in abject and in slavish part,</L>
<L><HI>Because you bought them</HI>—Shall I say to you,</L>
<L>Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?</L>
<L>Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds</L>
<L>Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates</L>
<L>Be seasoned with such viands—You will answer,</L>
<L><HI>The slaves are ours.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Montesquieu, in his <HI>Spirit of Laws,</HI> speaking with a just contempt and humorous severity against all the arguments brought in defence of this cruelty,
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
says, that the strongest reason which can be given for the practice of using Negroes like beasts of bur∣den, is, <HI>their having black skins, and flat noses.</HI></P>
<P>In the second Scene of the Third Act, the diffi∣culty of determining the true rate of persons or things, is largely commented upon; and as opinion is too often more under the dominion of fancy than of reason, perhaps the stanzas which precede the reflections, may serve as a proper prelude to the speech. The reader, at least, I dare say, will be pleased at finding them inserted here.</P>

<L>The world is still deceived with ornament.</L>

<L>Obscures the shew of evil? In religion,</L>
<L>What damned error but some sober brow</L>
<L>Will bless it, and approve it with a text;</L>
<L>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</L>
<L>There is no vice so simple, but assumes</L>
<L>Some mark of virtue on its outward part.</L>
<L>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</L>
<L>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="76"/>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</L>
<L>Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk?</L>
<L>And these assume but valour's excrement,</L>
<L>To render them redoubted—Look on beauty,</L>
<L>And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight,</L>
<L>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</L>
<L>Making them lightest, that wear most of it.</L>
<L>So are those crispy snaky golden locks,</L>
<L>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind</L>
<L>Upon supposed fairness, often known</L>
<L>To be the dowry of a second head,</L>
<L>The skull that bred them, in the sepulchre.</L>
<L>Thus ornament is but the gilded shore</L>
<L>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</L>
<L>Veiling an Indian <HI>dowdy</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dowdy</HI>—The word in the text is <HI>beauty,</HI> but reformed by Sir Thomas Hanmer.</NOTE>; in a word,</L>

<L>And here chuse I—Joy be the consequence!</L></Q></P>
<P>Portia's rapture, on finding her favourite lover has chosen right, is warmly and finely expressed, in the next speech; in which the danger of an ex∣cess of joy is also pointed out:
<Q><L>How all the other passions fleet to air—</L>
<L>As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,</L>
<L>And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy.</L>

<P>In the fifth Scene following, there is a ridiculous, but whimsical, description of a vain boasting young man; many of which sort are to be met with in life; in courts, in camps, in coffee-houses:

<L>Then I'll repent,</L>

<P>The character of Mercy is here most beautifully described. This passage can never be too often read. There is no danger of its growing <HI>feared and tedious</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Measure for Measure. Act II. Scene X.</NOTE>, as Angelo says of the laws of justice.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Portia, <HI>pleading for</HI> Anthonio.</STAGE>
<L>The quality of Mercy is not strained;</L>
<L>It droppeth as the gentle rain of heaven</L>
<L>Upon the place beneath: It is twice blessed;</L>
<L>It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.</L>
<L>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes</L>
<L>The throned monarch better than his crown;</L>
<L>His sceptre shews the force of temporal power,</L>
<L>The attribute to awe and majesty,</L>
<L>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</L>
<L>But mercy is above this sceptred sway,</L>
<L>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings;</L>
<L>It is an attribute to God himself;</L>
<L>And earthly po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er doth then shew likest God's,</L>
<L>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</L>
<L>Tho' justice be thy plea, consider this,</L>
<L>That in the course of justice none of us</L>
<L>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy;</L>
<L>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</L>
<L>The deeds of mercy.</L></Q>
<P>There is also a passage in the same Scene, where the Pro and Con for partial justice is rightly ar∣gued

<P>We have also, here, some philosophic reflections on the advantages of dying before we are encumbered with age and poverty, with a manly spirit of ac∣quiescence in the unavoidable ills of life, joined to the affecting tenderness and generous regards of friendship.</P>
<P>Anthonio, when the Jew has obtained sentence against him:
<Q><L>I am armed, and well prepared—</L>
<L>Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare ye well!</L>
<L>Grieve not, that I am fallen to this for you;</L>
<L>For herein Fortune shews herself more kind,</L>
<L>Than is her custom. It is still her use,</L>

<P>The enchanting powers and effects of music are here most poetically set forth. There can never be said too much on this charming theme.

<L>The reason is, your spirits grow attentive;</L>

<L>By the sweet power of music. Therefore, the Poet</L>

<P>The next quotation, and the last I shall transcribe from this Play, is in the same Scene; where Portia accosts her husband's friend, Anthonio, on his first visit to her, after the catastrophe of the piece has been wound up:
<Q><L>Sir, you are welcome to our house—</L>
<L>It must appear in other ways than words;</L>

<P>THIS Play begins with a reflection on the <HI>first,</HI> and I may add the <HI>principal,</HI> concern in life, the education of children. Men are often more sedulous in training the brutes of their kennels, their mews and their stables, than they seem to be about the heirs of their blood, their fortunes, or their honours. In sad truth may it be said, that we seldom meet with a jockey, an huntsman, or a sportsman, who is half so <HI>well-bred</HI> as his horses, his hawks, or his hounds.</P>
<P>Orlando, speaking of the unkindness of his elder brother and guardian, says,
<Q>For my part, he keeps me rustically at home; or, to speak more properly, <HI>flies</HI> me here at home, unkept; for call you that keep∣ing, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the <HI>stalling of an ox?</HI> His horses are bred better; for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage; and to that end riders dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which the animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this Nothing that he so plen∣tifully gives me, the Something that Nature gave me his coun∣tenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mines, <HI>for</HI> undermines.</NOTE> my gentility with my education.</Q></P>

<P>There are some passages very tender, gene∣rous, and affecting, in the first part of the dialogue between Rosalind and Celia, who had been bred up from their infancy in friendship together; the first, daughter to the exiled Duke; and the other, child to his brother, the Usurper.</P>
<Q><SP>

<SPEAKER>Celia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; and so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered, as mine is to thee.</P>

<P>As there are many vices in morals that are injuri∣ous to society, and which the laws have not stigma∣tized, or possibly cannot sufficiently provide against, the reprehensions of Satire, under proper restrictions, may perhaps be deemed a necessary supplement to legislation.

The former Scene, already quoted, prepares us finely for Orlando's violence here, which must otherwise have created disgust, and seem to have been inconsistent with his expression, in the third Scene above, where he says to Adam,

<P>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana; a Nun of Winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.</P>

<P>The abrupt commencement of this dialogue leads us to suppose, that it is but the continuation of one they had engaged in before their appearance in this scene, in which Celia had been endeavouring to quiet Rosalind's fears, upon her lover's having broke his promise of meeting her; and whether from being tired with her obstinacy, or resolving to try her sincerity, she here seems to join in her resentment, by agreeing with her in every thing; which has an effect very natural in all such cases, that the plaintiff immediately becomes defendant, whenever the person beloved happens to be censured by any one else but them∣selves.</P>
<P>Hermione says,
<Q><L>My heart, tho' full of rage, was free from malice,</L>

<P>As the humorous satire of Don Quixote came abroad into the world in Shakespeare's time, perhaps he might have taken a hint for this piece of ridicule from that writing; and Fletcher may have copied his raillery from him again. <HI>Malta</HI> is the only place now where the old Gothic chivalry is still preserved, and that duelling is established by law.</P>

<P>Biron, speaking on this latter subject, and justly condemning all study which is not made re∣ferable

to the real uses or moral purposes of life, says,
<Q><L>Study is like the Heaven's glorious sun,</L>
<L>That will not be deep searched with saucy looks;</L>
<L>What have continual plodders ever won,</L>
<L>Save base authority from other's books?</L>
<L>These earthly godfathers of Heaven's lights,</L>
<L>That give a name to every fixed star,</L>
<L>Have no more profit of their shining nights,</L>
<L>Than those that walk, and wot not what they are.</L>
<L>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame;</L>
<L>And every godfather can give a name.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again:
<Q><L>So study evermore is overshot;</L>
<L>While it doth study to have what it would,</L>
<L>It doth forget to do the thing it should;</L>
<L>And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</L>
<L>'Tis won, as towns with fire, so won; so lost.</L></Q></P>
<P>Seneca seems to be of the same opinion with our author, where he says, that
<Q>to desire more know∣ledge than is sufficient for us here, is intemper∣ance.</Q></P>
<P>Upon revising the articles of their mutual agree∣ment, they find that one of them must unavoidably be dispensed with, on account of a particular reason of state, that had not occurred to them in the drawing them up; upon which the folly and danger of making vows, is very justly descanted on.
<Q>They are made,</Q>
says Doctor Johnson, on this passage,
<Q>without sufficient regard to the variations of life, and are, therefore, broken by some unforeseen ne∣cessity. They proceed, commonly, from a pre∣sumptuous confidence, and a false estimate of hu∣man power.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our court, you know, is haunted</L>
<L>With a refined traveller of Spain;</L>
<L>A man in all the world's new fashion planted,</L>
<L>That hath a mint of phrases in his brain:</L>
<L>One whom the music of his own vain tongue</L>

<L>This child of Fancy, that Armado hight,</L>

<L>How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;</L>

<SPEAKER>Biron.</SPEAKER>
<L>Armado is a most illustrious wight,</L>
<L>A man of fine new words, <HI>Fashion's own knight.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The making <HI>right and wrong</HI> equally to chuse him for their arbitrator, is an admirable trait of an ob∣sequious disposition. And since we are upon this subject here, I think it will be better to groupe the rest of the characters in this Play together in this place, though they refer to different scenes in it.</P>

<P>In another place, Act II. Scene I. in a dialogue between the princess Maria, Catharine, and Rosa∣line, speaking of the courtiers, Maria says,
<Q><L>In Normandy saw I this <HI>Longaville</HI>;</L>
<L>A man of sovereign parts he is esteemed;</L>
<L><PB N="96" REF="109"/>Well fitted in the arts, glorious in arms;</L>
<L>Nothing becomes him ill, that he would well.</L>
<L>The only foil of his fair virtue's gloss,</L>
<L>If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,</L>
<L><HI>Is a sharp wit, matched with too blunt a will;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still will▪</HI></L>

<P>The latter part of the character of Longaville, above described, is an unhappy quality frequently to the persons themselves, who happen to be infected with it. It often makes enemies, but never once a friend. Even those who are the most maliciously pleased with it against others, still fear it against themselves. Sterne's comparison of the <HI>jester and jestee,</HI> to the <HI>mortgager and mortgagee</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In his <HI>Trif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shardy.</HI></NOTE> is an excellent and just allusion.

<P>A <HI>personal satirist</HI> may be likened to a <HI>hatchet-man</HI> sitting on the arm of a tree, with his face turned to the trunk, and cutting away before him; who, when he has dismembered the branch, falls to the ground himself along with it.</P>

<P>I praise God for you, Sir; your <HI>reasons</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Discourse, <HI>or</HI> conversation.</NOTE> at dinner have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty without affectation, <HI>audacious</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Animated.</NOTE> without impudency, learned with∣out <HI>opinion</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Opinionativeness.</NOTE>, and <HI>strange</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">New.</NOTE> without heresy. I did converse this quondam-day with a companion of the king's, who is intitled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano d'Armado.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Holofernes.</SPEAKER>
<P>His humour is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his ge∣neral behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too pi∣qued, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were; too peregri∣nate, as I may call it. He draweth out the thread of his verbo∣sity finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasms, such unsociable and <HI>point-devise</HI> companions; such rackers of Orthography, as to speak <HI>dout</HI> fine, when he should say <HI>doubt; det,</HI> when he should pronounce debt; d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. He clepeth a <HI>calf, caulf; half, haulf; neighbour</HI> vocatur <HI>nebour; neigh</HI> abbreviated <HI>ne</HI>—This is <HI>abominable,</HI> which he would pro∣nounce <HI>abhominable</HI>—It insinuates me of infanity; to be mad, frantic.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>But to return. The pedantry of scholastic defi∣nitions, and the verbose stile of law writings, are properly ridiculed, in the second Scene of the First Act, in part of Armado's letter to the king, giving an information of an offence committed against one of his statutes.</P>
<Q>So it is—Besieged with fable-coloured melancholy, I did com∣mend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
thy health-giving air; and as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk: The time, when? About the sixth hour, when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper—So much for the time when—Now for the ground which—Which, I mean, I walked upon—It is yeleped thy park— Then for the place where—Where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event, that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest—But to the place where. It standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minion of thy mirth, that unlettered small-knowing soul, that shallow vas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, which, as I remember, hight <HI>Costard,</HI> sorted, and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict, and continent canon, with a child of our grand-mother <HI>Eve,</HI> a female; or, for thy more understanding, a woman — Him have I sent to thee, to re∣ceive the meed of punishment, &amp;c.</Q>
<P>In the last Scene of this First Act, there is a quaint description given of Love; but as it is spoken in the person of Armado, whose affected character has been already exposed, I shall insert it here.</P>
<Q>Love is a familiar, love is a devil; there is no evil angel but love—Yet was Sampson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit —Cupid's But-shaft is too hard for Hercules's club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier—The passado he respects not, the duello he regards not—His disgrace is to be called boy; but his glory is to subdue men.</Q>

<L><PB N="99" REF="112"/>If wounding, then it was to shew my skill;</L>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Part of a speech here, is very worthy of a quo∣tation; first, as it is one of the many fond descrip∣tions of love given us by our Author; and next, as it shews the effects of this passion, in higher in∣stances than any of his former ones, by urging its advantages to the minds and manners, as well as its operations upon the affections, of men; and in this light, it may be considered as a good comment on the fable of Cymon and Iphigenia.</P>
<P>Biron, speaking to the King, Dumain, and Longa∣ville, after they had all fallen in love, against the phlegmatic and fruitless study of monastic life, in a seclusion from all female converse, says,
<Q><L>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</L>
<L>In <HI>leaden</HI> contemplation have found out</L>
<L>Such fiery numbers, as the prompting eyes</L>
<L>Of beauteous tutors have enriched you with?</L>
<L>Other slow arts intirely keep the brain;</L>
<L>And, therefore, finding barren practisers,</L>
<L>Scarce shew a harvest of their heavy toil—</L>
<L>But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,</L>
<L>Lives not alone immured in the brain;</L>
<L>But with the motion of all elements,</L>
<L>Courses as swift as thought in every power;</L>

<L>Above their functions and their offices.</L>
<L>It adds a precious seeing to the eye:</L>

<P>THE rational, sociable, and friendly manner in which crowned heads used formerly to live plea∣santly with one another, is described here—Why is it no longer so? Does modern polity oppose itself to hu∣manity? Kings may have mistresses, indeed; but friend or favourite they must have none. What amends can the whole <HI>regalia</HI> of their solitary pomp afford them, for being denied one of the sweetest, the dearest, and the most virtuous enjoyments of life; a manly sympathy of affections, and a chaste intercourse of souls! Modern kings may say, as Richard the Third did, <HI>I am myself alone; Incedo solus</HI>; but not in the happy sense that Horace meant it—the <HI>quacunque libido est</HI> is wanting.</P>

<SPEAKER>Camillo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sicilia cannot shew himself over-kind to Bohemia; they were trained together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot chuse but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attornied with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies; that they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed winds.

Though I cannot help observing here, that her vindictive spirit appears plainly not to have yet sub∣sided, but only taken a different course, by the latter part of her speech; for she continues still to accu∣mulate her charges against him, as if only by way of enumerating the articles of her forgiveness.</P>
<P>Our Author, who almost every where manifests a perfect knowledge in the anatomy of the human mind, proves his science more particularly in a passage of this Scene, by shewing a property in our natures which might have escaped any common dissecter of morals; and this is, our suffering, upon true penitence and contrition, not only all reproach thrown out against us with meekness and submission, but even encouraging and augmenting the abuse, by joining in our own condemnation. This may possibly arise from a strong wish, or sanguine hope, that such a voluntary penance may in part be ac∣cepted, both by heaven and the world, as some sort of atonement for our crimes.</P>
<P>Leontes, while Paulina is arraigning him with the utmost virulence and severity, instead of having her cast out from his presence, cries,
<Q><L>Go on, go on—</L>
<L>Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved</L>
<L>All tongues to talk their bitterest.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="122"/>Again, when she seems to relent of her severity towards him,
<Q><L>Thou did'st say but well,</L>
<L>When most the truth; which I receive much better</L>
<L>Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me</L>
<L>To the dead bodies of my queen and son:</L>
<L>One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall</L>
<L>The causes of their deaths appear, unto</L>
<L>Our shame perpetual; once a day I'll visit</L>
<L>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there</L>
<L>Shall be my recreation. So long as nature</L>
<L>Will bear up with this exercise,</L>
<L>So long I daily vow to use it. Come,</L>
<L>And lead me to these sorrows.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the First Scene of the Fifth Act, the same subject is renewed, where Leontes manifests the same humi∣liation and contrition for his crime, that he did be∣fore: but as an interval of sixteen years, spent in sorrow and repentance, had passed between these two aeras, he, as would be natural then, shews an un∣easiness at the reproach, and intreats to be relieved from it for the future; but this in a manner so gentle and submissive, as none but Shakespeare him∣self could have conceived. The whole passage is worthy of being quoted.</P>

<L><HI>Desire to breed by me.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>I have continued the above dialogue beyond the philosophy of its subject, in order to treat my reader with one of the most refined sentiments of a chaste and delicate mind, that can possibly be conceived. Perdita shews a charming genuineness of nature in her latter speech; for though she confesses the truth of Polixenes' position, yet is she so jealous of the honour of our great parent, that even the appearance of a violation against her rights offends her. And the parallel she makes upon the occasion, is beautiful. Readers see not half the <HI>greatness</HI> of Shakespeare, who overlook his <HI>minutiae.</HI></P>
<P>In the same scene, the praise that Florizel bestows on Perdita is equally fond and beautiful.</P>
<Q><L>What you do,</L>
<L>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,</L>
<L>I'd have you do it ever; when you sing,</L>
<L>I'd have you buy and sell so; so give alms;</L>
<L>Pray so; and for the ord'ring your affairs,</L>
<L>To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you</L>
<L>A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do</L>
<L>Nothing but that; move still, still so,</L>
<L>And own no other function. Each your doing,</L>
<L>So singular in each particular,</L>
<L>Crowns what your doing in the present deeds,</L>
<L>That all your acts are queens.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="113" REF="125"/>To which she replies, with very good sense and prudence,
<Q><L>O <HI>Doricles,</HI></L>
<L>Your praises are too large; but that your youth,</L>
<L>And the true blood which peeps forth fairly through it,</L>
<L>Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,</L>
<L>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,</L>

<P>This Comedy is full of well-described character, and beautiful description; but these not happening to fall within the scope I had prescribed to myself in this work, I have reluctantly passed them by, without noting.

<Q><STAGE>Autolicus <HI>and a</HI> Gentleman.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Autolicus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beseech you, Sir, were you present at this relation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was by at the opening of the fardel, and heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the cham∣ber. Only this, methought I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Autolicus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo, were very notes of admiration; they seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was a speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; <HI>they looked, as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed</HI>; a notable passion of wonder ap∣peared in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>This description not only contains the beautiful and the sublime, but rises to a still higher sublimity, or, to speak in the stile of the Psalmist, to the <HI>most
<PB N="115" REF="127"/>
highest,</HI> in the allusion to sacred writ, relating to the two principal articles in the Old and New Testa∣ment, the fall of man, and his redemption. Shake∣speare makes frequent references to the sacred text, and writes often, not only as a moralist, but as a divine.</P>
<P>Autolicus having by accident had some hand in bringing about the discovery of Perdita, which was a circumstance that might have been suffi∣cient to make another man's fortune, makes only this sad soliloquy upon the occasion:
<Q><HI>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head.</HI> I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd's daughter, so he then took her to be, who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscovered. <HI>But 'tis all one to me; for had I been the finder out of this secret, it would not have relished, among my other discredits.</HI></Q></P>
<P>That <HI>honesty is the best policy,</HI> is a homely proverb; but this only the more vouches the truth of it, by its having stood the test of all experience. Character is the <HI>immediate jewel of the soul,</HI> not only in its own worth, but even in the temporal advantages which frequently accrue from it. Lost health may be re∣paired, lost fortune be regained, even lost senses may be recovered; but a forfeited character is rarely ever to be retrieved.</P>
<P>This is a theme which cannot be too largely or too frequently expatiated upon; which I hope will serve as my apology for having taken the hint from so mean and trifling an instance as the foregoing.</P>

<P>THIS Play opens with a sweet passage, in which the charms of music, and the nature of love, are beautifully described.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<L>If music be the food of love, play on;</L>
<L>Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,</L>
<L>The appetite may sicken, and so die.</L>
<L>That strain again—It had a dying fall—</L>
<L>O! it came o'er my ear, like the sweet south,</L>
<L>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</L>
<L>Stealing and giving odour. Enough! no more—</L>
<L>'Tis not so sweet now, as it was before.</L>
<L>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!</L>
<L>That, notwithstanding thy capacity</L>
<L>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</L>
<L>Of what validity and pitch soe'er,</L>
<L>But falls into abatement and low price,</L>
<L>Even in a minute; so full of shapes in fancy,</L>
<L>That it alone is <HI>hight</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hight,</HI> yeleped, or called, instead of <HI>high. Warburton.</HI></NOTE> fantastical.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>As I have hitherto observed upon Shakespeare's critical knowledge in human nature, I hope it will not appear invidious now, if I should here remark upon his deficiency in a passage above—lines second and third. The duke is there made to wish his pas∣sion were extinct; which, I believe, the most unhappy lover never yet did. We wish to remove every un∣easy sensation it afflicts us with, by any means what∣ever; sometimes even by death itself; but never by the extinction of the affection.</P>
<P>This is not peculiar to love alone; 'tis the same in all the tender feelings. We wish the object of our grief brought back again to life, but desire not to forget our sorrow. We wish to relieve the subjects of our pity, but would not be deprived of our com∣passion.
<PB N="120" REF="132"/>

In the more heroic qualities of bravery and fortitude, can be traced no likeness of the Deity, because super∣fluous in a perfect state. The subject of love is touched upon again, twice, in the same Scene:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Duke.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, when my eyes did see Olivia first,</L>
<L><HI>Methou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht she purged the air of pestilence;</HI></L>
<L>That instant was I turned into a hart,</L>

</SP></Q>
And when Valentine acquaints the Duke with Oli∣via's vow of sequestering herself from the world, for seven years, to mourn the death of her brother, he cries out in an extasy,
<Q><L>O, she that hath an heart of that fine frame,</L>
<L>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</L>
<L>How will she love, when the rich golden shaft</L>
<L>Hath killed the flock of all affections else,</L>
<L>That live in her? When liver, brain, and heart,</L>
<L>Three sovereign thrones, are all supplied and filled</L>
<L>(O sweet perfection!) with one self-same king!</L></Q></P>
<P>I am happy that this latter passage happens to oc∣cur so immediately after my remark above, as it affords me an opportunity of doing justice to Shake∣speare, by observing that his inference, from Olivia's grief, to the nature of her heart in love, shews a perfect knowledge in this species of philosophy. The passions are divided into but two classes, the tender and the violent; and any one of either affords an earnest of all others of the same kind.</P>
<P>His distinction, too, of the <HI>three thrones,</HI> the <HI>liver, brain,</HI> and <HI>heart,</HI> is admirable. These are truly the seats of the three chief affections of love; the heart for passion, the mind for esteem, and the liver for jealousy; if Horace's anatomy is to be credited <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the last speech of this Act, Olivia speaks in the usual manner of all infatuated persons, who are apt to make the Fates answerable for those follies or vices which they have not sense or virtue enough to extricate themselves from, by their own exertions. For, upon a consciousness of having too weakly be∣trayed her passion for Viola, appearing under the cha∣racter of a cavalier, she acquiesces in her indiscre∣tion, by saying,
<Q><L>I do I know not what—and fear to find</L>
<L>Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That my eye has revealed a secret, which my mind should have concealed. <BIBL><HI>Johnson.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</L>

<L><HI>What is decreed must be—and this be so!</HI></L></Q>
She repeats the same idle apology for herself, again, in the second Scene of the next Act:
<Q><L>For such as we are made, if such we be,</L>
<L>Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we.</L></Q></P>

<P>THIS is one of the best acting Comedies of Shake∣speare, and is replete with character, humour, and incident; but supplies very little toward the pur∣pose of this Work. However, whatever there is, has a right to class with the rest; so I shall proceed to take it in its course.</P>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="act">
<HEAD>ACT II.</HEAD>
<DIV5 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<P>Upon Mrs. Page's reading Falstaff's Love-letter to her, she makes the following reflection:
<Q>What unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard pickt, i' th' Devil's name, out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner essay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company— What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth."</Q></P>
<P>And in the next Scene, on communicating this adventure to Mrs. Ford, she recurs to the same thought again.</P>
<Q>Nay, I know not—It makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he knew some stain in me, that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</Q>
<P>This is a very natural sentiment for a delicate mind to conceive, upon meeting with an affront of this sort; and 'tis extremely proper, upon all such occa∣sions, to enter into such a self-examination, by way of inquiring what part of our own conduct, or <HI>unweighed behaviour,</HI> as she expresses it, might have encouraged the offence; and upon an impartial scrutiny we shall generally find, that 'tis more our indiscretion than our charms which prompts the attack.</P>

<DIV5 N="9" TYPE="scene">

<P>Evans, personating the King of the Fairies:

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION. SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>Among the preparations which are making, in order to deceive the drunken Tinker into the notion of his having been a mad Lord just recovering his senses, some Strollers are introduced to perform a Play for his entertainment; and the Actors meaning to exhibit one of the old religious Farces, stiled the <HI>Mysteries,</HI> upon enumerating the <HI>properties</HI> necessary toward the representation, ask for
<Q>a little <HI>vinegar</HI> to make their Devil roar.</Q>
Upon which passage Dr. Warburton gives the following note:</P>
<P><Q>When the acting the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of the Old and New Testament was in vogue, at the representation of the <HI>Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Passion,</HI> Judas and the Devil made a part. And the Devil, wherever he came, was always to suffer some disgrace, to make the people laugh; as here the buffoonery was to apply the <HI>gall and vinegar,</HI> to make him roar. And the <HI>Passion</HI> being that, of all the <HI>Mysteries,</HI> which was most frequently represented, <HI>vinegar</HI> became at length the standing implement to torment the
<PB N="134" REF="144"/>
Devil, and used for this purpose even after the <HI>Mysteries</HI> ceased and the <HI>Moralities</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certain allegorical pieces, where the Virtues and Vices were personified, which succeeded to the stage, upon the prohibition of the former.</NOTE> came in vogue; where the Devil still continued to bear a consider∣able part. The mention of it here, was designed to ridicule so absurd a circumstance in these old Farces.</Q></P>
<P>The giving such theatrical representations of Sa∣cred Writ, was rather something more than barely <HI>absurd</HI>; it was extremely profane: but the device of tormenting the Devil with <HI>gall and vinegar,</HI> had a mystic conceit in it; being certainly intended by the authors of these exhibitions, as an allusion to a cir∣cumstance in the <HI>Passion,</HI> mentioned by St. Matthew, where he says, <HI>they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall.</HI> Chap. xxvii. ver. 34. And as the sufferings on the <HI>Cross</HI> were undergone for our <HI>redemption from sin,</HI> the priests, who were the contrivers of this strange and improper species of drama, might have intended this particular to shew the distress of the Devil upon that occasion.</P>

<P><PB N="138" REF="148"/>Upon this passage, Doctor Warburton has passed the following stricture:</P>
<P><Q>Shakespeare has here copied Nature with great skill. Petruchio, by frightening, starving, and over-watching his wife, had tamed her into gen∣tleness and submission; and the audience expects to hear no more of the shrew; when, on her being crossed in the article of fashion and finery, the most inveterate folly of the sex, she flies out again, though for the last time, into all the intem∣perate rage of her character.</Q></P>
<P>This is being severe on our sex at a very cheap rate, indeed; foibles, passions, and inconsiderable at∣tachments, are equally common to all mankind, without distinction of gender; and the difference of objects gives no sort of advantage to men, over us; as all eager pursuits, except those of virtue, are alike ridiculous and unimportant, in the candid and impartial estimation of reason and philosophy:
<Q>"Another Florio doating on a flower." <BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Petruchio having gained a conquest in this material point, proceeds to dress her and himself in poor at∣tire, and proposes that they should go pay a visit to her family in such mean garments; upon which oc∣casion he expresses a sentiment so just in itself, that it betrays a sad corruption in the morals of man∣kind, that experience cannot support it.</P>

<P>After Catharine has been thoroughly reclaimed, she takes an occasion, from a circumstance in the Play, of reproving another married woman, in an admirable speech; wherein the description of a way∣ward wife, with the duty and submission which ought to be shewn to a husband, are finely set forth.</P>
<Q><L>Fy! fy! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</L>
<L>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</L>
<L>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</L>
<L>It blots thy beauty, as frosts bite the meads;</L>
<L>Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</L>
<L>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</L>
<L>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</L>
<L>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</L>
<L>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</L>
<L>Will deign to sip, or touch one drop of it.</L>
<L>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</L>
<L>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</L>
<L>And for thy maintenance commits his body</L>
<L>To painful labour, both by sea and land;</L>
<L>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</L>
<L>While thou lyest warm at home, secure and safe;</L>
<L>And craves no other tribute at thy hands,</L>
<L>But love, fair looks, and true obedience;</L>
<L>Too little payment for so great a debt.</L>
<L>Such duty as the subject owes the prince,</L>
<L>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</L>
<L>And when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</L>
<L>And not obedient to his honest will,</L>
<L>What is she but a foul contending rebel,</L>
<L>And graceless traitor, to her loving lord?</L>
<L>I am ashamed that women are so simple,</L>
<L>To offer war, where they should kneel for peace;</L>
<L>Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,</L>
<L>When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.</L>
<L>Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,</L>
<L>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</L>
<L>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</L>
<L>Should well agree with our external parts?</L>
<L>Come, come, you froward and unable worms,</L>
<L>My mind has been as big as one of yours,</L>
<L>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</L>
<L>To bandy word for word, and frown for frown;</L>
<L>But now I see our lances are but straws,</L>
<L><PB N="140" REF="150"/>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare;</L>
<L>That seeming to be most, which we indeed least are.</L></Q>
<P>I have stopped short here, as thinking that the following lines might have marred the whole beauty of the speech; the doctrine of <HI>passive obedience and non-resistance</HI> in the state of marriage, being there carried, perhaps, rather a little too far. But I shall quote them here, as they afford me an opportunity of remarking on the nature of too prompt reformees, who are apt to run into the very contrary extreme, at once; betraying more of the <HI>time-server,</HI> than the <HI>convert.</HI></P>
<P>But, in general, indeed, it has been observed, that the most haughty tyrants become, on a reverse of fortune, the most abject slaves; and this from a like principle, in both cases; that they are apt to im∣pute the same spirit of despotism to the conqueror, they were before imprest with themselves; and con∣sequently, are brought to tremble at the apprehension of their own vice.</P>
<P>The lines I allude to, are these:
<Q><L>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</L>
<L>And place your hands beneath your husband's foot;</L>
<L>In token of which duty, if he please,</L>
<L>My hand is ready, may it do him ease.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To vail</HI> is to submit, to be awed by authority.</NOTE></L></Q></P>

<P>In a passage here, there is a sentiment of great propriety and delicacy argued upon; in the dissuad∣ing a person from the commission of an unseemly action, even though the thing itself might be suf∣ficiently justified in one's own breast. A respect to decency, and the opinion of the world, is an excellent bulwark to our virtues.</P>
<P>When Antipholis, upon being denied admittance into his house from a mistake in his wife and do∣mestics, is in resentment preparing to force open the door, his friend intreats his forbearance in the following words:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Balthazar.</SPEAKER>

<P><Q>This is judiciously expressed.—Of all the trans∣ports of joy, that which is attended with tears, is the least offensive; because, carrying with it this mark of pain, it allays the envy that usually at∣tends another's happiness.

<P>Physiognomists say, that the features of the mind usually mark their impressions on the countenance. A mirthful or melancholy aspect, a wanton or mali∣cious one; in fine, every characteristic trait of vi∣sage throughout, denote their correspondent passions or affections in the soul. Socrates acknowledged the certainty of this science, by confessing a description of himself to be true, as to his nature, though false, regarding his character.</P>

<P>The total metamorphosis of character, manners, and disposition, wrought in us by love, is well de∣scribed in a speech in this Scene:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Benedick.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do much wonder, that one man seeing how much an∣other man is a fool, when he dedicates his behaviour to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn, by falling himself in love! And such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him, but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor
<PB N="151" REF="161"/>
and the pipe. I have known when he would have walked ten miles a foot, to see a good armour; and now will he lye ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain, and to the purpose, like an honest man, and a soldier; and now is he turned orthographer; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes.</P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>From these reflections, Benedick goes on holding a debate with himself upon this subject; and, like most people, before their hearts have become a party in the matter, draws a vain portrait of the peerless para∣gon who only can be capable of triumphing over his affections; leaving nothing, in the choice of his mistress, to Heaven itself, except <HI>the colour of her hair.</HI></P>
<Q>May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I'll take my oath, that till he have made one of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well. But till all graces meet in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician; <HI>and her hair shall be of what colour it please God.</HI></Q>

The surest method that artifice can contrive to inspire a passion in any one, is by giving them a notion of the other party's predilection for them; for, as Hero says to Ursula, in the plot on Beatrice,
<Q><L>Let it be thy part</L>
<L>To praise him more than ever man did merit.</L>
<L>My talk to thee must be, how Benedick</L>
<L>Is sick in love with Beatrice. <HI>Of such matter</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That often wounds by hearsay.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Act III. Scene I.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And again,
<Q><L>If it prove so, then loving goes by haps;</L>
<L>Some Cupids kill with arrows, some with traps.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Ditto.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>When every other circumstance of years, of rank, and fortune happens to be on a par, such arts may, perhaps, be allowed to pass under the title of <HI>pious frauds,</HI> at least; for gratitude is a good cement of af∣fections, as it serves to confirm passion by principle.</P>
<P>The readiness with which we are apt to run into the snare ourselves, with the kind of logic we use in order to make a <HI>sudden resolve</HI> appear a <HI>deliberate pur∣pose,</HI> may be seen displayed in the soliloquy of Bene∣dick, just after Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato, had played off their part against him, as supposing him not to be within hearing.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="163"/>Benedick, advancing from the arbour,
<Q>This can be no trick, the conference was <HI>sadly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sadly, <HI>for</HI> gravely, <HI>or</HI> seriously.</NOTE> borne. They have the truth of this, from Hero; they seem to pity the lady; it seems her affections have the full bent. Love me! Why, it must be requited—I hear how I am censured; they say, I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love to come from her; they say too, that she will rather die than give any sign of affection.—I did never think to marry—I must not seem proud—happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a truth, I can bear them witness—And virtuous—'Tis so, I cannot reprove it—And wise—but for loving me—By my troth, it is no addition to her wit—nor no great argument of her folly, neither; for I will be horribly in love with her—I may chance to have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, be∣cause I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the ap∣petite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth, that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences, these paper bullets of the brain, awe a man from the career of his humour? No— the world must be peopled—When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live 'till I were married. Here comes Beatrice! By this day, she's a fair lady—I do spy some marks of love in her.</Q></P>
<P>The speech of Beatrice, also, in the first Scene of the Third Act, has a right to take place here, though somewhat before its time, as <HI>a companion</HI> to the preceding.</P>
<P>Beatrice, advancing, after Hero and Ursula had quitted the Scene:
<Q><L>What fire is in my ears! Can this be true?</L>
<L>Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much?</L>
<L>Contempt, farewel! and maiden pride, adieu!</L>
<L>No glory lives behind the back of such.</L>
<L>And, Benedick, love on, I will requite thee,</L>
<L>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand;</L>
<L>If thou dost love, thy fondness shall incite thee</L>
<L>To bind our loves up in a holy band.</L>
<L>For others say thou dost deserve; and I</L>
<L>Believe it better than reportingly.</L></Q></P>

<P>A most unamiable character of pride and self∣conceit is given in this place, which falls very pro∣perly

<L>But nature never framed a woman's heart</L>

<L>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</L>

<L>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</L>
<L>She is so self-indeared.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The same character is continued in the same Scene, with the addition of a satirical vein, which is ex∣tremely well and humorously described:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Hero.</SPEAKER>
<L>I never yet saw man,</L>
<L>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,</L>

</SP></Q></P>
<P>Hero, in the same Scene, pretending to lay a scheme with Ursula, for curing Benedick of his supposed passion for Beatrice, while she is listening, says,
<Q><L>No, rather I will go to Benedick,</L>
<L>And counsel him to fight against his passion.</L>

<P>I have not been so much an oeconomist, in other places, where the recurring of similar topics af∣forded me opportunities of saving myself trouble, by references; but this one is so very irksome a theme, that it disgusts me to dwell upon it for a moment; for which reason, should I happen to meet with it again, in the course of this Work, I shall pass it by unnoticed for the future.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Hero, being falsely accused of an act of disho∣nour, is examined before her father, her lover, and a Friar, with other friends, who had all met together in a convent to attend her nuptials; and the bitter∣ness of a parent's anguish and resentment on so trying an occasion, is most feelingly expressed in the fol∣lowing speech:
<Q><STAGE>Leonato, <HI>to his daughter on her fainting.</HI></STAGE>
<L>Do not live, Hero, do not ope thy eyes;</L>
<L>For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,</L>
<L>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,</L>
<L>Myself would, on the rereward of reproaches,</L>
<L>Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?</L>
<L>Chid I for that at frugal Nature's frame?</L>
<L>I've one too much by thee. Why had I one?</L>
<L>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?</L>
<L>Why had I not, with charitable hand,</L>
<L>Ta'en up a beggar's issue at my gates?</L>
<L>Who smeared thus, and mired with infamy,</L>
<L>I might have said, No part of it is mine;</L>
<L>This shame derives itself from unknown loins.</L>
<L>But mine, and mine I loved, and mine I praised,</L>
<L>And mine that I was proud of, mine so much,</L>
<L>That I myself was to myself not mine,</L>
<L>Valuing of her; why she—O she is fallen</L>

<L>And salt too little which may season give</L>
<L>To her foul tainted flesh!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="166"/>Upon this occasion, the good Friar, with that charity and humanity which so well become the sacred office of Priesthood, and from that observa∣tion which his long experience in the business of <HI>auricular confession</HI> had enabled him to form, stands forth an advocate for Hero's innocence, in the fol∣lowing poetical and philosophical oration:
<Q><L>Hear me, a little;</L>
<L>For I have only silent been so long,</L>
<L>And given way into this course of fortune,</L>
<L>By noting of the lady. I have marked</L>
<L>A thousand blushing apparitions</L>
<L>To start into her face; a thousand innocent shame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>In angel whiteness bear away those blushes;</L>
<L>And in her eye there hath appeared a fire,</L>

<L>Against her maiden truth—Call me a fool,</L>
<L>Trust not my reading, nor my observations,</L>
<L>Which with experimental seal do warrant</L>
<L>The tenor of my <HI>book</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I do not comprehend the meaning of this expression, unless it be allowed to be figurative of his art, science, or knowledge in phys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ognemy.</NOTE>; trust not my age.</L>
<L>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,</L>
<L>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here,</L>
<L>Under some biting error.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, a little after, this good casuist asks her sud∣denly this trying question:
<Q>Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</Q>
Upon which passage Doctor Warburton makes the following judicious remark:</P>
<P><Q>The Friar had just before boasted his great skill in sifting out the truth; and indeed, he ap∣pears, in this instance, to have been no fool. He was by, all the while at the accusation, and heard no names mentioned. Why, then, should he ask her what man she was accused of? But in this lay the subtilty of his examination. For, had Hero been guilty, it was very probable that, in the hurry and confusion of spirits into which the terrible insult of her lover had thrown her, she
<PB N="159" REF="169"/>
would never have observed that the man's name was not mentioned; and so, on this question, might have betrayed herself, by naming the per∣son she was conscious of an affair with. The Friar observed this, and so concluded, that, were she guilty, she would probably have fallen into the trap he had laid for her. I only take notice of this, to shew how admirably well Shakespeare knew how to sustain his characters.</Q></P>
<P>But this noble defence for the unhappy Hero, not being sufficient to obviate the strong impressions of her guilt, which the father had conceived against her, the honest Priest then goes on to propose a scheme of conduct to him, which might peradven∣ture bring about some crisis or event, that would clear her innocence; at least silence the infamy, and remove her from being any longer an object of ob∣loquy. In this proposal there is shewn a just knowledge of the world, and an intimate acquaintance with the secret movements of the human heart.</P>

<L>Shall come apparelled in more precious habit;</L>
<L>More moving, delicate, and full of life,</L>

<L>If ever love had interest in his liver,</L>
<L>And wish he had not so accused her;</L>
<L>No, though he thought his accusation true.</L>
<L>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</L>

<L>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</L>
<L>But if all aim but this be levelled false,</L>

<P>Doctor Johnson's note upon this passage, is worthy of being quoted here:</P>
<P><Q>This is one of our Author's observations upon life. Men overpowered with distress, eagerly listen to the first offers of relief, close with every scheme, and believe every promise. He that has no longer any confidence in himself, is glad to repose his trust in any other that will undertake to guide him.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>Beatrice, in spiriting up Benedick to avenge her cousin Hero's quarrel, thus expresses her resentment against the offender:
<Q>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slander'd, scorn'd, dishonour'd my kinswoman! O, that I were a man! What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then with public accusation, uncover'd slander, unmitigated rancour— O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place. O that I were a man for his sake! or, that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too—He is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and swears to it—I cannot be a man with wishing, there∣fore I will die a woman with grieving.</Q></P>
<P>There is a generous warmth of indignation in this speech, which must certainly impress a female reader with the same sentiments upon such an occasion. I am not so disingenuous to take advantage of this passage as an historical fact, but am willing to rest it upon the sole authority of the Poet's assumption, as this will sufficiently answer the design of my intro∣ducing it; which is, to vindicate my sex from the general, but unjust charge of being prone to slander; for were this the case, were not the resentment of Beatrice, in this instance, natural, how could it move our sympathy? which it actually does here, even though we acknowledge the circumstance to have been merely imaginary.</P>
<P>I believe, that there is nothing which a woman of virtue feels herself more offended at, than defama∣tion or scandal; first against her own character, and proportionably when others are made the victims. There are women, indeed, who may be fond of flander, as having an interest in depreciating an idea of chastity; but this is owing to their frailty, not their sex—Vice is neither masculine, nor feminine; <HI>'tis the common of two.</HI></P>

<P>As I commenced my remarks on this Play with a note of Doctor Warburton's, I shall conclude them, also, with another very judicious observation of the same critic upon this last passage:</P>
<P><Q>This brother Anthony is the truest picture ima∣ginable of human nature. He had assumed the character of a Sage, to comfort his brother o'er∣whelmed with grief for his only daughter's affront and dishonour; and had severely reproved him for not commanding his passion better, on so try∣ing an occasion. Yet, immediately after this, no sooner does he begin to suspect that his age and valour are slighted, but he falls into the most in∣temperate fit of rage himself; and all his brother can say, or do, is not of power to pacify him. This is copying Nature with a penetration and exactness of judgment peculiar to Shakespeare. As to the expression, too, of his passion, nothing can be more highly painted.</Q></P>

<P>THE Countess of Rousillon speaking of Helena, her Ward, says,
<Q>I have those hopes of her good, that her education promises her; disposition she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for her simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.</Q></P>
<P>The Commentators are not agreed in opinion upon the <HI>verbal</HI> sense of this passage—but no matter; I shall leave their criticism undecided, and proceed to the moral interpretation of it; which is, that a <HI>derived</HI> virtue, which implies a natural good dispo∣sition, affords considerable assistance to a good edu∣cation; that accomplishments, without such a foun∣dation, are a disadvantage to the possessors, as but tending to their condemnation and reproach; that the innocence and simplicity of Helena's mind and heart made use of no arts, but left her talents to the natural effect of their own operations; and that though a good disposition may be <HI>inherited,</HI> virtues must be <HI>purchased.</HI></P>
<P>In the same Scene, when Bertram comes to take leave of his mother, in order to attend the king, she gives him her blessing in a most pathetic manner, and the most effectual too, where the seeds of virtue are, by setting his noble father before him as a pat∣tern. To this she likewise adds some precepts for the conduct of his life, which would have done honour to the first Sages of Aegypt, Greece, or Rome.</P>

<P>There are some excellent well-spirited reflections here thrown out, to encourage men in the exertion of all their active faculties towards the advancement of their fortunes; and to earn their independance by the manly means of industry, instead of poorly crouching at the gates of Providence, whining for an alms.</P>
<P>Helena, upon her resolving to undertake the cure of the king's disorder, in hopes through that means to raise her rank and fortune to a respect not un∣worthy of Bertram, says,
<Q><L>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,</L>

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE following speech, though delivered with an air of levity, and expressed in humorous words and images, supplies occasion for three very just reflections. The first, That <HI>self interest,</HI> in the mere worldly sense of the term, is the ruling prin∣ciple of mankind. Secondly, That men are too apt to inveigh against corruption, more from the being void of temptation themselves, than their being free from this vice; and, lastly, That bad examples in the superior ranks of life, have a dangerous tendency to injure the morals of the inferior classes of a people.</P>
<P>Upon a peace being made between the kings of England and France, in which the right of Arthur to the British throne is betrayed on the one hand, and but poorly compensated on the other, Faulcon∣bridge makes this soliloquy:
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<L>Mad world, mad kings, mad composition!</L>
<L>John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,</L>
<L>Hath willingly departed with a part;</L>
<L>And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,</L>
<L>Whom zeal and charity brought to the field,</L>
<L>As God's own soldier <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To support Arthur's claim,</NOTE>, rounded in the ear</L>
<L>With that same <HI>purpose-changer,</HI> that fly devil,</L>
<L>That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,</L>
<L>That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,</L>
<L>Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,</L>
<L>Who having no external thing to lose,</L>
<L>But the word <HI>maid,</HI> cheats the poor girl of that;</L>
<L>That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling commodity—</L>
<L>Commodity, the bias of the world;</L>
<L>The world, which of itself is poized well,</L>
<L><PB N="176" REF="186"/>Made to run even upon even ground;</L>
<L>Till this advantage, this vile drawing bias,</L>
<L>This sway of motion, this commodity,</L>
<L>Makes it take head from all indifferency,</L>
<L>From all direction, purpose, course, intent.</L>
<L>And this same bias, this commodity,</L>
<L>This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,</L>
<L>Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France.</L>
<L>Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,</L>
<L>From a resolved and honourable war,</L>
<L>To a most base and vile-concluded peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<L>Yet why rail I on this commodity?</L>
<L>But for because he hath not wooed me yet;</L>
<L>Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,</L>
<L>When his fair angels would salute my palm;</L>
<L>But that my hand, as unattempted yet,</L>
<L>Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.</L>
<L>Well, while I am a beggar, I will rail,</L>

<L>And being rich, my virtue then shall be</L>

<P>The astonishment of Constance, on hearing that her son's interests are sacrificed to the league, with the doubts which we are naturally inclined to con∣ceive of the truth of sudden ill news, and the weak state of mind and spirits to which persons in misfor∣tune, especially helpless women, are generally re∣duced, are all finely painted and described in the fol∣lowing speech.</P>

<L>Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?</L>
<L>It is not so; thou hast mis-spoke, mis-heard;</L>
<L>Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again—</L>
<L><PB N="177" REF="187"/>It cannot be—thou dost but say, 'tis so.</L>
<L>I trust I may not trust thee—for thy word</L>
<L>Is but the vain breath of a common man.</L>
<L>Believe me I do not believe thee, man—</L>
<L>I have a king's oath to the contrary.</L>
<L>Thou shalt be punished for thus frighting me;</L>
<L>For I am sick, and capable of fears;</L>
<L>Oppressed with wrongs, and therefore full of fears—</L>
<L>A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;</L>
<L>A woman naturally born to fears;</L>
<L>And tho' thou now confess thou didst but jest,</L>
<L>With my vexed spirits I cannot make a truce,</L>

<L>What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?</L>
<L>Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?</L>
<L>What means that hand upon that breast of thine?</L>
<L>Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,</L>
<L>Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?</L>
<L>Be these sad sighs confirmers of thy words?</L>
<L>Then speak again; not all thy former tale,</L>
<L>But this one word, whether thy tale be true.</L></Q>
<P>A little further, upon Salisbury's confirming the bad news, she conceives a very natural though un∣reasonable idea, with which, however, we are apt to be impressed toward all messengers of bad tidings, however innocent of the evil:
<Q><L>Fellow, be gone, I cannot brook thy sight—</L>
<L>This news hath made thee a most ugly man.</L></Q></P>
<P>That partiality in favour of beauty, which it is natural for all persons to be sensible of, even where their duty and interests in different objects are equal, is strongly marked by Constance, when her son begs her to sustain his wrongs with patience. The whole speech is affecting.</P>

<P>In the same Scene, when Salisbury tells her that the two kings had sent for her, and that <HI>be must not return without her,</HI> the answer she makes is full of that dignity, which grief, mixed with resentment, is capable of conferring on illustrious unfortunates; and her whole demeanour upon that occasion is ex∣pressive of a great soul, rendered still braver by mis∣fortunes.</P>

<P>Doctor Johnson has given us a very judicious note on this passage; and as it relates to the passions, which, as well as morals, are a subject of this work, I shall present the reader with a transcript of it here.</P>
<P><Q>In <HI>Much Ado About Nothing,</HI> the father of Hero, depressed by her disgrace, declares himself so sub∣dued by grief, that <HI>a thread may lead him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Being that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low in grief,</L>

How is it that grief, in Leonato and Lady Constance, produces effects directly opposite, and yet both agreeable to Nature? Sorrow softens the mind, while it is yet warmed by hope; but hardens it, when 'tis congealed by despair. Distress, while there remains any prospect of relief, is weak and flexible; but when no succour appears, is fearless
<PB N="179" REF="189"/>
and stubborn; angry alike at those who injure, and at those who do not help; careless to please, where nothing can be gained; and fearless to offend, when there is nothing further to be dreaded. Such was this Author's knowledge of the Passions.</Q></P>

<P>When Philip is urged by the Pope's Legate to break the league he had just entered into with John, he offers to compound the treachery by <HI>ceasing to be his friend,</HI> but <HI>without becoming his enemy.</HI></P>
<Q>I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.</Q>
<P>To which Pandulpho makes him this reply:
<Q><L>So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;</L>
<L>And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,</L>
<L>Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow,</L>
<L>First made to Heaven, first be to Heaven performed!</L>
<L>That is, to be the champion of the Church.</L>
<L>What since thou sworest, is sworn against thyself,</L>

<L>But in despair die under their black weight.</L></Q></P>
<P>The old Jesuit argues here as ingeniously for the dispensing power of the Papacy, as Satan does in Milton for his rebellion. The object of both is the same; namely, <HI>the absolute and exclusive dominion of Heaven.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<P>The wild and enthusiastic manner with which the fondness and despair of Constance for her son, impels her to speak of him, has something extremely mov∣ing in it:
<Q><L>Father cardinal, I have heard you say,</L>
<L>That we shall see and know our friends in Heaven;</L>
<L>If that be, I shall see my boy again.</L>
<L>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,</L>
<L>To him that did but yesterday suspire,</L>
<L>There was not such a gracious creature born.</L>
<L>But now will canker sorrow eat my bud,</L>
<L>And chase the native beauty from his cheek;</L>
<L>And he will look as hollow as a ghost;</L>
<L>As dim and meagre as an ague-fit;</L>
<L>And so he'll die: and rising so again,</L>
<L>When I shall meet him in the court of Heaven,</L>
<L>I shall not know him; therefore, never, never,</L>
<L>Must I behold my <HI>pretty</HI> Arthur more.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is something very tender and affecting in her making use of the epithet <HI>pretty,</HI> in the last line. It has a better effect there than <HI>dearest, angel,</HI> or even <HI>lovely,</HI> (though this last has a more compre∣hensive sense) would have had in that place. I must beg leave to refer to the Reader's own taste for
<PB N="181" REF="191"/>
the justness of this observation; for I own, I cannot explain why it strikes me in this manner myself.</P>
<P>The reason why we are apt to cherish grief in our breasts; that species of it, I only mean, which may be distinguished by the name of <HI>tender</HI> sorrow; from a peculiar sort of indulgence it is capable of affording us, is admirably well expressed in the fol∣lowing passage:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Pandulpho.</SPEAKER>
<L>You hold too heinous a respect of grief.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Constance.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>He talks to me who never had a son.</HI></L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Philip.</SPEAKER>
<L>You seem as fond of grief, as of your child.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Constance.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Grief fills the room up of my absent child;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Puts on his</HI> pretty <HI>looks, repeats his words</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>Remembers me of all his gracious parts;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then have I reason to be fond of grief.</HI></L>
<L>Fare you well. Had you such a loss as I,</L>
<L>I could give better comfort than you do.</L>
<L>I will not keep this form upon my head,</L>
<STAGE>Tearing off her head-dress.</STAGE>
<L>When there is such disorder in my wits.</L>
<L><HI>O Lord, my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!</HI></L>
<L><HI>My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!</HI></L>
<L>My widow's comfort, and my sorrow's cure.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>These last three lines are almost suffocating. I be∣lieve no woman with a mother's feeling, could ever be able to pronounce them articulately, even in re∣presentation.</P>
<P>Doctor Johnson gives a good note on one of the passages of the above speech:
<Q><L>Had you such a loss as I,</L>
<L>I could give better comfort than you do.
<BIBL>l. 7 and 8.</BIBL></L></Q></P>
<P><Q>This is a sentiment which great sorrow always dictates. Whoever cannot help himself, casts his eyes on others for assistance; and often mistakes their inability for coldness.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="192"/>I remember a couple of French lines on this sub∣ject of grief, which contain the same thought that Constance expresses above:
<Q><L>Men deuil me plait, et doit toujours me plaire:</L>
<L>Il me tient lieu de celu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> que je pleurs.</L></Q></P>

<L>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,</L>
<L>Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man.</L>
</SP>
<P>This may be a just image of life, to those who have exhausted its variety, and palled their senses with its pleasures. The speech might not have ill become his father, old Philip, then labouring under baffled hopes and disappointed wishes; who had just then suffered the mortification of having lost a battle, in the heart of his own dominions, and whose mis∣taken faith in heaven had obliged him to break faith on earth, without effect too; but it was certainly rather too premature a sentence to have proceeded from the lips of a young prince, who had been but just married to a woman he loved. Such an impro∣priety in the character of a speaker, hurts the effect of a thought or sentiment.</P>
<P>In the same Scene, there is a strong description given of the situation of a sovereign, with regard to the people, after he has forfeited their love, confi∣dence, or esteem.</P>
<P>Pandulpho, speaking of John's keeping Arthur in prison:
<Q><L>This act so evilly born, shall cool the hearts</L>

<P>Doctor Johnson has made a comment on the latter part of this Scene, which the Reader has a right to claim in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="195"/>
<Q>There are many touches of Nature in this conference of John with Hubert. A man engaged in wickedness would keep the profit to himself, and transfer the guilt to his accomplice. These re∣proaches vented against Hubert, are not the words of art or policy, but the eruptions of a mind swell∣ing with the consciousness of a crime, and desi∣rous of discharging its misery on another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This account of the timidity of guilt, <HI>hadst thou but shook thy head,</HI> &amp;c. is drawn <HI>ab ipsis recessibus mentis,</HI> from an intimate knowledge of mankind; particularly that line in which he says, that <HI>to have bid him tell his tale in express words</HI> would have <HI>struck him dumb.</HI> Nothing is more certain, than that bad men use all the arts of fallacy upon them∣selves, palliate their actions to their own minds by gentle terms, and hide themselves from their own detection in ambiguities and subterfuges.</Q></P>

<P>When Hubert has been suspected and charged with the murder of prince Arthur, the speech of Faulcon∣bridge to him is finely expressive of the strength of despair arising from a guilty conscience:

<L>And if thou want'st a cord, <HI>the smallest thread,</HI></L>

<P>The answer to this speech is fine; it pays due honour to the generous conflict in the speaker's breast, and makes a distinction between the effects of male and female tears, paying the usual, but too partial, compliment to the former. Be it so—The first are stronger on account of their being more rare, owing solely to the superior harshness of men's na∣tures; but as the passions and feelings, which the spectator is sensible of, from each, are so very dif∣ferent in their nature too, I cannot see how any sort of comparison can be fairly made between them.</P>

<P>Afterwards, when Bolinbroke is called upon to the same purpose, he also replies as bravely; but as he expresses himself in so much an inferior man∣ner to the former, I think it could afford the reader no great entertainment to have the passage quoted.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>When the King sentences these two champions to exile, he exacts an oath from them both, not to be reconciled to one another abroad, so far as to con∣federate against the state of England; in the ad∣ministering of which bond, he desires them to
<Q><L>Swear by the duty that you owe to Heaven. . . . .</L>
<L>Our part therein we banish with yourselves.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon which latter line Doctor Warburton gives the following note:</P>
<P><Q>It is a question much debated among the writers on the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> whether a banished man be still tied in allegiance to the state which sent him into exile. Tully and Clarendon declare for the affirmative: Hobbes and Puffendorf hold
<PB N="193" REF="203"/>
the negative. Our Author, by this line, seems to be of the latter opinion.</Q></P>
<P>But I agree intirely with Cicero and Clarendon. The undergoing any penalty of law cannot dissolve either the moral or the political duty we owe our country. Socrates, by refusing to escape out of prison, shewed, that he thought his obedience and submission to the state continued still to be obliga∣tory on him, even though the decree was unjust, and the sentence death. And under the <HI>Ostracism,</HI> which imposed banishment upon men for their very eminence and virtue, we do not hear of the illustri∣ous exiles either speaking, or acting, as if they deemed their allegiance to have been cancelled.</P>
<P>Nay, Aristides carried the submission of a good subject so far, as to think himself obliged in duty to write his own name on a <HI>shell,</HI> at the request of an illiterate citizen of Athens, who voted against him on that very law. And Themistocles, though banished through the spirit of faction, not that of the laws, and kindly entertained and preferred in the armies of Persia, chose to swallow poison, rather than march against his country.</P>
<P>'Tis not the community that banishes a man, but the laws which govern it.</P>
<Q>"It is the law, not I, condemns your brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angelo to Isabella. <HI>Measure for Measure.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
<P>These surely are no object of resentment; and to rise in arms against a nation, because one of its statutes had fallen heavy upon us, would be just as rational, as to set a forest on fire, because we had received the bastinado by a cudgel that was taken out of it.</P>

<P>Upon which passage there is the following reflec∣tion, in the note by Doctor Johnson:</P>
<P><Q>It is matter of very melancholy consideration, that all human advantages confer more power of do∣ing evil, than good.</Q>
A very melancholy reflection, indeed, were we to suppose it true!</P>
<P>In the instance before us, the hand of power, strength, or treachery, may certainly deprive us of a life, which it cannot restore; but Shakespeare does not mean to make the reflection universal. A good Prince may render his whole people happy; a bad one can only affect a part. When tyranny becomes general, it defeats itself, at the cost of the oppressor.</P>

<P>There are undoubtedly certain notices, or premo∣nitions, in the order of Providence, which mankind have been frequently sensible of; sometimes from dreams, at other times from unaccountable impres∣sions on the mind, foreboding particular misfortunes of our lives, let philosophy reason against the no∣tion ever so wisely.</P>
<P>Indeed, there appears one argument to oppose this opinion, which, in any indifferent case, might be thought sufficiently able to overthrow it; which is, that such hints rarely, if ever, have been found to answer any other purpose, than to render us unhappy before our time.</P>
<P>But matter of fact is not to be controverted by syllogism. The objection only serves to resolve it into a mystery, and leaves it still uninvestigable by human science. The more of such inexplicable secrets of Providence which fall under our observa∣tion, the better; as they may serve to rouze the Atheist from his lethargy, and afford the Deist oc∣casion to suspect, at least, that what he calls <HI>Na∣tural Religion,</HI> is not the intire scheme of the Divine oeconomy with regard to men:

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first speech here, Henry the Fourth, in order to encourage his subjects to attend him with the better spirit on the <HI>Crusade</HI> expedition, which he had then resolved upon, gives a horrid description of their former state of civil war, which the kingdom was happily at that time free from.</P>

<L>Did lately meet in the intestine shock,</L>

<L>Shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks</L>

</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>The method that men take to disguise the nature of their vices, by palliating epithets, is of dangerous consequences in life. It not only serves to blunt the edge of remorse in ourselves, but often helps to in∣duce a milder censure in others, upon the most fla∣grant enormities.</P>
<P>Thus a prostigate fellow, who debauches every woman in his power, is stiled <HI>a man of galantry</HI>; a pennyless adventurer, who carries off a rich heiress,
<PB N="208" REF="218"/>
is called <HI>a soldier of fortune</HI>; a duellist, dubbed with the title of <HI>a man of honour</HI>; a sharper, <HI>un chevalier d'industrie</HI>; an atheist, a <HI>free-thinker</HI>; and so forth.</P>
<P>A good specimen of this sort of deceitful phraseo∣logy is presented to us in part of this Scene.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Falstaff <HI>to the Prince.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are <HI>squires</HI> of the night's body, be called thieves of the day's booty. Let us be <HI>Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon</HI>; and let them say we be <HI>men of good government,</HI> being governed as the sea is, by <HI>our noble and chaste mistress the moon</HI>; under whose countenance we — steal.</P></Q>
<P>Pistol, in some other place, says of <HI>stealing,</HI>

</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>I think I may venture to pronounce, for the ho∣nour of human nature, that the most abandoned per∣son breathing, means not to pass his whole life in a state of profligacy. He purposes, from time to time, <HI>to take up,</HI> as the phrase is; but is too apt, from time to time, to procrastinate his amendment; thus silenc∣ing the clamours of his conscience, by the hopeful design of reformation, and thinking his repentance sufficiently advanced, by a self-confession of his vice or immorality.</P>
<P>The danger of this species of <HI>quietism,</HI> is strongly pointed out, in part of a work lately published; and as it may afford a useful warning to some of my dissipated readers, I shall quote the passage I allude to here.</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>An <HI>EPITAPH</HI> on Human Life.</HEAD>
<L>Eheu! fugaces, Postume, P stume,</L>
<L>Labuntur anni! <BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be early wise, lest prudence come too late!</L>
<L>Think how <HI>to-morrow</HI> steals from us <HI>to-day,</HI></L>
<L>And leaves the spendthrift further in arrear,</L>
<L>To purposes unfinished! till old Time,</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="219"/><HI>Who lends on usury,</HI> calls in the account,</L>
<L>And takes the body for its debt unpaid,</L>
<L>Foreclosing life in the insolvent tomb <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Something New.</NOTE>!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>The following speech affords us a beautiful in∣stance of this method of amusing our too flexible and indolent tempers of mind; which I copy here with the greater pleasure, as the speaker of it did effectually reform his life and manners, and has en∣riched the annals of England with a memoir of true glory.</P>
<P>The Prince of Wales, speaking of his loose com∣panions, who had just quitted the scene, says,
<Q><L>I know ye all, and will a-while uphold</L>
<L>The unyoked humour of your idleness;</L>
<L>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</L>
<L>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</L>
<L>To smother up his beauty from the world;</L>
<L>That when he please again to be himself,</L>
<L>Being wanted, he may be more wondered at,</L>
<L>By breaking through the soul and ugly mists</L>
<L>Of vapours, that did seem to strangle him.</L>
<L>If all the year were playing holidays,</L>
<L>To sport would be as tedious as to work;</L>
<L>But when they seldom come, they wished for come,</L>
<L>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</L>
<L>So when this loose behaviour I throw off,</L>
<L>And pay the debt I never promised,</L>
<L>By how much better than my word I am,</L>
<L>By so much shall I <HI>falsify</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Falsify</HI> for <HI>exceed.</HI> Doctor Johnson.</NOTE> men's hopes;</L>
<L>And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,</L>
<L>My reformation glittering o'er my fault,</L>
<L>Shall shew more goodly, and attract more eyes,</L>
<L>Than that which hath no soil to set it off.</L>
<L>I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;</L>
<L>Redeeming time, when men think least I will.</L></Q></P>

<DIV5 N="4" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>When the brave Hotspur is taxed by the king with having refused to surrender the prisoners which he had taken at the gallant action of <HI>Holmedon-Moor,</HI> to his order, the speech he makes upon that occasion, in excuse for his refractoriness, presents us with a
<PB N="210" REF="220"/>
very natural description of the uneasy, froward, and difficult temper of mind, a person is subject to in such circumstances as he paints himself to be at the time mentioned; and also entertains us with a cha∣racter, admirably and humorously drawn, of a pert, foppish, and affected Court minion. The contrast of the two figures here before us, would make an ex∣cellent picture on canvas.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Hotspur.</SPEAKER>
<L>My liege, I did deny no prisoners;</L>
<L>But I remember, when the fight was done,</L>
<L>When I was dry with rage, and extreme toil,</L>
<L>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</L>
<L>Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly drest,</L>
<L>Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped,</L>
<L>Shewed like a stubble land at harvest home.</L>
<L>He was perfumed like a milliner,</L>
<L>And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held</L>
<L>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</L>
<L>He gave his nose, and took't away again.</L>
<L>And still he smiled and talked—</L>
<L>And as the soldiers bare dead bodies by,</L>
<L>He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</L>
<L>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</L>
<L>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</L>
<L>With many holiday and lady terms</L>
<L>He questioned me—Among the rest, demanded</L>
<L>My prisoners, on your majesty's behalf.</L>
<L>I then, all smarting with my wounds grown cold,</L>
<L>Out of my grief, and my impatience,</L>
<L>To be so pestered with a popinjay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These lines are transposed, as hinted by Doctor Johnson.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Answered neglectingly I know not what;</L>
<L>He should, or should not; for he made me mad,</L>
<L>To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,</L>
<L>And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman,</L>
<L>Of guns, and drums, and wounds—God save the mark!</L>
<L>And telling me the sov'reignest thing on earth,</L>
<L>Was <HI>Parmacity</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A corruption of the word <HI>sperma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</HI></NOTE> for an inward bruise;</L>
<L>And that it was great pity, <HI>so it was,</HI></L>
<L>That villainous salt-petre should be digg'd</L>
<L>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</L>
<L>Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed</L>
<L>So cowardly. And but for these vile guns,</L>
<L>He would himself have been a soldier—</L>
<L>This bold unjointed chat of his, my lord,</L>
<L><PB N="211" REF="221"/>I answered indirectly, as I said;</L>
<L>And, I beseech you, let not this report</L>
<L>Come current for an accusation</L>
<L>Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The king, not being satisfied with his apology, says to him, after some prior altercation between them,
<Q><L>Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,</L>
<L>Or you shall hear in such a kind from me,</L>
<L>As will displease you—</L>
<L>Send us your prisoners, or you'll hear of it.
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></L></Q></P>
<P>Upon this menace, the impatient temper of Hotspur breaks out into the following expressions; which, though the substance of them does not fall within the purpose of this Work, I shall, however, repeat here, and also continue the dialogue a good deal further, as it leads to the character of the speaker, which I design to give a description of, in the close of my observations on the two next Plays.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Hotspur.</SPEAKER>
<L>And if the devil come and roar for them,</L>
<L>I will not send them. I'll after, strait,</L>
<L>And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,</L>
<L>Although it be with hazard of my head.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>And again, to the same purpose:
<Q><L>I'll keep them all —</L>
<L>By Heaven, he shall not have a Scot of them;</L>
<L>No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not—</L>
<L>I'll keep them, by this hand—</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worcester.</SPEAKER>
<L>You start away,</L>
<L>And lend no ear unto my purposes—</L>
<L>Those prisoners you shall keep.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hotspur.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will; that's flat—</L>
<L>He said he would not ransom Mortimer,</L>
<L>Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was in part of the altercation between them, in this scene, not quoted above.</NOTE>;</L>
<L>But I will find him when he lies asleep,</L>
<L>And in his ear I'll holla, Mortimer!</L>
<L>Nay, I will have a starling taught to speak</L>
<L>Nothing but Mortimer, and give it him,</L>

</SP></Q></P>
<P>The precarious confidence that men can venture to place in unwarrantable services performed for an∣other, is well marked in the same scene, by one of the disloyal conspirators who had assisted Henry to dethrone king Richard.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Worcester.</SPEAKER>
<L>For, bear ourselves as even as we can,</L>

<P>In this truly <HI>comic</HI> Scene, which may be the rather stiled so, because there is no <HI>buffoonery</HI> in it, and which I therefore think preferable even to the hu∣mour of Falstaff, the vanity of old Glendower, in supposing himself to have been a peculiar object of the notice of Providence, which has, however, been the foible of several great men, Caesar, &amp;c. with the vulgar ignorance of mistaking natural events for mi∣racles, is finely contrasted with the careless humour, sturdy spirit, and rational investigation of Hotspur.</P>

<P>The nobleness of Hotspur's character is ad∣mirably sustained throughout this Play. The fol∣lowing speech shews a fine part of it:
<Q><STAGE>Hotspur <HI>to</HI> Dowglas.</STAGE>
<L>Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth,</L>
<L>In this fine age, were not thought flattery,</L>
<L>Such attribution should the Dowglas have,</L>
<L>As not a soldier of this season's stamp,</L>
<L>Should go so general current through the world.</L>
<L>By heaven, I cannot flatter, I defy</L>
<L>The tongues of soothers; but a braver place,</L>
<L>In my heart's love, hath no man than yourself—</L>
<L>Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.</L></Q></P>
<P>The precarious and critical situation of unwar∣rantable and hazardous undertakings, is well re∣flected upon in the following passage of the same Scene, when the conspirators are informed that Northumberland is prevented by sickness from at∣tending the rendez-vous:
<Q><STAGE>Worcester <HI>to</HI> Hotspur.</STAGE>
<L>But yet I would your father had been here;</L>

<L>Books no <HI>division</HI>—</L></Q>
<P>The Commentator, by the word <HI>hair,</HI> in this place, understands <HI>complexion or character,</HI> and finds fault with the harshness of the metaphor. But I think, from the last part of the sentence, that the Poet meant the expression literally. Wor∣cester compares the stightness of their cause to a single <HI>hair,</HI> which is a thing of too subtile a nature to bear being <HI>divided.</HI></P></NOTE>; it will be thought,</L>
<L>By some that know not why he is away,</L>
<L>That wisdom, loyalty, and meer dislike</L>
<L>Of our proceedings, kept the Earl from hence—</L>
<L>And think how such an apprehension</L>
<L>May turn the tide of fearful faction,</L>
<L>And breed a kind of question in our cause.</L>
<L><PB N="223" REF="233"/>For well you know, we of the offending side</L>
<L>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament,</L>
<L>And stop all sight-holes, every loop, from whence</L>
<L>The eye of reason may pry in upon us.</L>
<L>This absence of your father draws a curtain,</L>
<L>That shews the ignorant a kind of fear,</L>
<L>Before not dreamt upon.</L></Q></P>
<P>The gallant spirit of Hotspur is well shewn in his reply:
<Q><L>You strain too far;</L>
<L>I rather of his absence make this use—</L>
<L>It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</L>
<L>A larger dare to our great enterprize,</L>
<L>Than if the earl were here; for men must think,</L>
<L>If we, without his help, can make a head</L>
<L>To push against the kingdom; with his aid,</L>
<L>We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.</L>
<L>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon this occasion Dowglas makes a boast, which though intended by him as an exclusive com∣pliment to his own nation, may be challenged as the general characteristic of Great Britain at large.</P>
<P>Dowglas, in continuation of Hotspur's speech:
<Q><L>As heart can think—there is not such a word</L>
<L>Spoke of in Scotland, as this term of <HI>fear.</HI></L></Q></P>

<P>The liberal mind and brave heart of the Prince of Wales are beautifully marked in the following speech, where he makes a generous encomium on Hotspur, and sends him a spirited defiance to single combat, at the same time.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Prince <HI>to</HI> Worcester.</STAGE>

<P>If the Reader will take the trouble to revert to the last observation on the fourth Scene in the First Act of this Play, he will meet with a like reflection there, made by the same person.

But, indeed, this reflection may more generally be applied to every species of vice; for in guilt there can be no peace within, nor confidence without.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I thought that my task was done with this Play, when I had got to the end of it; but there is some∣thing so very great, singular, and attractive, in the two principal characters of this historic piece, that I find a pleasure in keeping them still in view, and contemplating them both in my mind.</P>
<P>Whenever Hotspur or the Prince <HI>filled the Scene,</HI> which they are either of them, singly, sufficient to do, I confess that my heart was sensible of such an emotion, as Sir Philip Sidney said he used to be affected with, on a perusal of the old Ballad of Chevy-Chase; <HI>as if he had heard the sound of a trumpet.</HI> Perhaps the following observation may better account for my impulse:</P>
<P>Women are apt to esteem the <HI>antient virtue</HI> of courage at an higher rate than men in general are; and this, for these two especial reasons. The first, that it is peculiarly necessary to their personal defence; and the next, that their weak∣ness induces them to form a sublimer notion of this quality, than the stronger, and therefore braver, sex may naturally be supposed to compliment it with. Men, feeling the principles of it in their own breasts, conceive no very supernatural idea of it; while
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
women, having no such premisses to reason from, look on it as something more than human.</P>
<P>These reflections, with the frequent occasions I have had, thoughout this Play, of comparing the two heroes of it with each other, have tempted me to undertake a Parallel between them, after the man∣ner of Plutarch; which, however, I did not mean to have given the Reader, as hinted above, 'till I should come to the end of the second Play after this, where our Author has concluded all he had to say about Henry the Fifth.</P>
<P>But as Shakespeare has opened enough of this Prince's character, here, to supply sufficient materials for the comparison, and that his unfortunate rival is just slain, I thought the Parallel might have a better effect on the mind of my Readers, in this place, than it would be likely to produce after the delay had suffered the impression of Hotspur's qua∣lities to wear out of their remembrance.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="excursus">
<HEAD>A PARALLEL BETWEEN HOTSPUR, AND HENRY PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<P>THEY are both equally brave; but the courage of Hotspur has a greater portion of fierceness in it— The Prince's magnanimity is more heroic. The first resembles Achilles; the latter is more like Hector. The different principles, too, of their actions help to form and justify this distinction; as the one <HI>invades,</HI> and the other <HI>defends,</HI> a right. Hotspur speaks nobly of his rival Dowglas, to his face, but after he is be∣come his friend; the Prince does the same of Hotspur, behind his back, and while he is still his enemy.</P>
<P>They both of them possess a sportive vein of humour in their scenes of common life; but Hot∣spur still preserves the surly and refractory haughti∣ness of his character, throughout, even in the relaxa∣tions
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
he indulges himself in. The Prince has more of ease and nature in his; delivering himself over to mirth and dissipation, without reserve. Hotspur's festivity seems to resemble that of Hamlet; as as∣sumed merely to relieve anxiety of mind, and cover sanguinary purposes; the Prince's gaiety, like that of Faulconbridge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In King John.</NOTE>, appears to be more genuine, ari∣sing from natural temper, and an healthful flow of spirits. The Prince is Alcibiades—Percy is—him∣self.</P>
<P>There is likewise another character in this rich Play, of a most peculiar distinction; as being not only <HI>original,</HI> but <HI>inimitable,</HI> also—No copy of it has ever since appeared, either in life or description. Any one of the Dramatis Personae in Congreve's Comedies, or, indeed, in most of the modern ones, might repeat the wit or humour of the separate parts, with equal effect on the audience, as the person to whose rôle they are appropriated; but there is a certain characteristic peculiarity in all the humour of Falstaff, that would sound flatly in the mouths of Bardolph, Poins, or Peto. In fine, the portrait of this extraordinary personage is delineated by so ma∣sterly a hand, that we may venture to pronounce it to be the only one that ever afforded so high a degree of pleasure, without the least pretence to merit or virtue to support it.</P>
<P>I was obliged to pass by many of his strokes of humour, character, and description, because they did not fall within the rule I had prescribed to my∣self in these notes; but I honestly confess that it was with regret, whenever I did so; for, were there as much moral, as there certainly is physical, good in laughing, I might have transcribed every Scene of his, throughout this, the following Play, and the Merry Wives of Windsor, for the advantage of the health, as well as the entertainment, of my readers.</P>

<P>I was just going to observe upon the latter part of this dialogue, when I happened to recollect that I had already taken notice of a parallel passage, in my second remark on the First Scene of the Third Act of King John; and to which I beg leave to refer my Reader.</P>
<P>The human mind, when roused by danger, or in∣flamed with passion, is capable of inspiring the brave heart with additional courage, and of supplying new vigour to exhausted strength. This admirable oeco∣nomy in the human frame is contrived by nature, as being necessary to self-defence, as well as in order to render injury the more difficult and hazardous to the offender.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Northumberland.</SPEAKER>
<L>For this I shall have time enough to mourn;</L>
<L>In poison there is physic; and this news,</L>
<L>That would, had I been well, have made me sick,</L>
<L>Being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, hath, in some measure, made me well.</L>
<L>And as the wretch, whose fever-weakened joints,</L>
<L>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</L>
<L>Impatient of his fit, breaks, like a fire,</L>
<L>Out of his keeper's arms; even so my limbs,</L>
<L>Weakened with grief, being now enraged with grief,</L>
<L>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</L>
<L>A scaly gauntlet, now, with joints of steel,</L>
<L>Must glove this hand—And hence, thou sickly quoif!</L>
<L>Thou art a guard too wanton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light <HI>or</HI> effeminate.</NOTE> for the head,</L>

<L>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand</L>
<L>Keep the wild flood confined; let order die,</L>
<L>And let this world no longer be a stage,</L>
<L>To feed contention in a lingering act,</L>
<L>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</L>
<L>Reign in all bosoms; that each heart being set</L>
<L>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</L>

</SP></Q>
<P><PB N="233" REF="243"/>I have continued this speech, for eight lines fur∣ther than my preface to it required; but I thought the whole spirit and language of it too fine, to suffer it to be mangled by stopping short.

<P>Belike then, my appetite was not princely got; for, in troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But, indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it in me, now, to remember thy name? or to know thy face, to-morrow? or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast? <HI>Videlicet</HI>; these, and those that were once the peach-coloured ones—or to bear the inventory of thy shirts; as one for use, and another for superfluity.</P>

<P>That common disposition of vaunting ourselves above others, so natural to mankind, that some writer

But I shall commence the dialogue a little earlier than may be just necessary to this reference, in order to treat my reader with a beautiful trait in the Prince's character, who is made to preserve his virtue untainted, in the midst of all his debauchery and dissipation.</P>
<P>Poins, being piqued at the Prince's having ex∣posed the shabbiness of his wardrobe, replies:
<Q><SP>

<P>Why, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick; albeit, I could tell thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better to call my friend, I could be sad, and very sad, indeed, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poins.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very hardly, upon such a subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this hand, thou think'st me as far in the Devil's book as thou and Falstaff, for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But, I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly, that my father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art, hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</P>

<P>What would'st thou think of me, if I should weep?</P>

<P>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be every man's thought; and thou art a blessed fellow, to think as every man thinks. Never a man's thought in the world, keeps the road-way better than thine. Every man would think me an hypocrite, indeed. And what excites your most wor∣shipful thought to think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poins.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, because you have seemed so lewd, and so much ingrafted to Falstaff.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prince.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poins.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, by this light, I am well spoken of; I can hear it with my own ears. The worst they can say of me, is, that I am
<PB N="236" REF="246"/>
a second brother, and that I am <HI>a proper fellow of my hands</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was an expression, in those times, for <HI>a person forward in fighting.</HI></NOTE>; and those two things, I confess, I cannot help.</P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The delicacy of the Prince's difficulty upon this occasion, in not being able to manifest the concern he was really sensible of for his father's illness, lest, from the former complexion of his life and manners, he might be suspected of insincerity in such pro∣fessions, must have a fine effect on the sentiment of a reader who is possessed of the least refinement of principle or virtue.</P>
<P>A most useful lesson might be framed, upon the very singular character of this amiable person. The pattern is not perfect; and therefore—shall I venture to say it? the example is the better, for that reason. His manners are idle, but his morals uncorrupt. He suf∣fers Falstaff to make as free with him as he pleases, but breaks his head, as Mrs. Quickly tells us in a former Scene, for his having thrown out a jest upon his father. Young men may learn from him never to be guilty of more vice, than the temptation to it might precipi∣tate them into. He connives at the robbery of his companions, for the diversion of playing the same game upon them, again; but resolves to make ample re∣stitution for the wrong <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the last Scene of Act II, in the first part of this Play.</NOTE>. He offends his father by the dissoluteness of his conduct; but his filial affec∣tion and respect are still unremitted towards him. He shews a spirit of justice in injustice, and of duty, even in disobedience.</P>
<P>I here offer this comment as a supplement to the character I have already drawn of this Prince, at the end of the former Play. I could not have fairly added it there, as any thing that did not im∣mediately relate to the comparison between him and Hotspur, would have been improperly introduced in the Parallel.</P>

<P>There is a striking description given of the Prince, here, which does honour likewise to the speaker. Parents, in general, while they are fond of their chil∣dren, are apt either to see them without blemish, or, when they are offended with them, to shew no indul∣gence to their failings. But the good old king speaks here impartially of his son, fairly balancing his merits with his blames, and weighing them with the charity that Heaven itself will do hereafter.</P>

<L>Thomas of Clarence,</L>
<L>How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?</L>
<L>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, <HI>Thomas.</HI></L>
<L>Thou hast a better place in his affection,</L>
<L>Than all thy brothers; cherish it, my boy;</L>
<L>And noble offices thou may'st effect</L>
<L>Of mediation, after I am dead,</L>
<L>Between his greatness and thy other brethren.</L>
<L>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</L>
<L>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace,</L>
<L>By seeming cold, or careless of his will;</L>
<L>For he is gracious, if he be observed.</L>
<L>He hath a tear for pity, and a hand</L>
<L>Open as day for melting charity;</L>
<L>Yet, notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint;</L>
<L>As humorous as winter, and as sudden</L>
<L>As flaws <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Air congealed by the coldness of the night, and exploded in gusts by the warmth of the morning sun.</NOTE> congealed in the spring of day;</L>
<L>His temper, therefore, must be well observed.</L>
<L>Chide him for faults, but do it reverently,</L>
<L>When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</L>
<L>But being moody, give him line and scope,</L>
<L>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</L>
<L>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, <HI>Thomas,</HI></L>
<L>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</L>
<L>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</L>
<L>That the united vessel of their blood,</L>
<L><PB N="246" REF="256"/>Mingled with venom of suggestion,</L>
<L>As force-perforce the age will pour it in,</L>
<L>Shall never leak, though it should work as strong</L>

<P>One cannot help loving such a character, taking the whole together. The good part of it is its <HI>na∣ture,</HI> the bad one but its <HI>youth.</HI> Fruits of a wild favour are the choicest, when well cultivated.</P>
<P>In part of the above speech, there is a good direc∣tion given to those who have to deal with passionate or capricious persons, <HI>Chide him for faults,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I should have expatiated on the unanimity of the royal family, recommended here, as necessary to the safety of the crown; but that I could not possibly have urged any new argument on the subject, stronger than the old simile of the <HI>bundle of twigs</HI> in the Fable.</P>
<P>Just after, the king speaks again of the prince, with the same tenderness, and in a most affecting manner, upon hearing that he still continues to asso∣ciate with his loose companions:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;</L>
<L>And he, the noble image of my youth,</L>
<L>Is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>read with them; therefore my grief</L>
<L>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>In answer to this melancholy prospect, Warwick endeavours to make an apology for the prince, in a very pretty and ingenious allusion, wherein is implied, what happens to have too much truth in it, that no one can know the world, or be fit to govern in it, who is not sufficiently acquainted with the base and corrupt part of mankind.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Warwick.</SPEAKER>
<L>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite;</L>
<L>The prince but studies his companions,</L>
<L>Like a strange tongue, wherein to gain the language,</L>
<L>'Tis needful that the most immodest word</L>
<L>Be looked upon and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rned; which once attained,</L>
<L>Your highn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss knows comes to no farther use,</L>
<L>But to be known, and hated. So, like gross terms,</L>
<L>The prince will, in the perfectness of time,</L>
<L>Cast off his followers; and their memory</L>
<L><PB N="247" REF="257"/>Shall, as a pattern, or a measure, live,</L>
<L>By which his grace must mete the lives of others;</L>
<L>Turning past evils to advantages.</L>

<P>To this piece of soothing flattery the king re∣plies, with as apt a simile, on his part, to express his diffidence in the hopeful prophecy:

Intimating that our affections, like the honey∣comb, however improperly placed at first, will too naturally continue still to attract us, even in spite of our b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter reason.

<P>THE sudden reformation of Henry Prince of Wales, upon his succession to the crown, is a fact recorded in history; and there have been suffi∣cient instances of such an exertion of latent virtue in mankind, upon record, to evince its not being a thing unnatural; though, sad to say it, not enough to prevent its being reckoned in the class of uncom∣mon events.

<P>Here follows a fine lesson for states and potentates to reflect seriously upon, when they are publishing manifestos, or meditating a war.</P>
<P>The King, and Canterbury, who was president of his council:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<L>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed;</L>
<L>And justly and religiously unfold,</L>
<L>Why the law <HI>Salic,</HI> that they have in France,</L>
<L>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim.</L>
<L>And, God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</L>
<L>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</L>
<L>Or nicely charge your understanding soul,</L>
<L>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</L>
<L>Suits not in native colours with the truth.</L>

<L>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed.</L>
<L>For never two such kingdoms did contend,</L>
<L>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops</L>
<L>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint,</L>
<L>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords,</L>
<L>That make such waste in <HI>brief mortality.</HI></L>
<L>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</L>
<L>For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,</L>
<L>That what you speak is in your conscience washed,</L>
<L><HI>As pure as sin with baptism.</HI></L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>There is a just description of the nature of govern∣ment, given a good deal further in the same Scene.</P>

<L>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</L>
<L>The advised head defends itself at home;</L>
<L>For government, though high, and low, and lower,</L>
<L>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,</L>
<L>Congreeing in a full and natural close,</L>
<L>Like music.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Both the distinction and the simile here made use of, are almost a literal translation of a parallel passage
<PB N="257" REF="267"/>
in Cicero; and there are so many other allusions of the same kind, to be met with throughout our author's writings, as might lead one into an opinion of his being a tolerable classical scholar, notwithstanding Ben Johnson's invidious line,
<Q>"Altho' thou hadst small Latin, and less Greek."</Q>
But in denying him the accomplishment of litera∣ture, he paid an higher compliment to his genius, than perhaps he meant; as this was to impute to him the greater merit of being possessed of the same fancy and judgment with the best of the Antients, without the advantages of their example or instruction.</P>
<P>The subject of the above speech is considered more at large, and treated in detail, in the deduction drawn from it in the reply.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Canterbury.</SPEAKER>
<L>Therefore Heaven doth divide</L>
<L>The state of man in divers functions,</L>
<L>Setting endeavour in continual motion;</L>
<L>To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,</L>
<L>Obedience. For so work the honey-bees;</L>
<L>Creatures, that by a rule in nature, teach</L>
<L>The art of order to a peopled kingdom.</L>
<L>They have a king, and officers of sort,</L>
<L>Where some, like magistrates, correct at home;</L>
<L>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad;</L>
<L>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,</L>
<L>Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds;</L>
<L>Which pillage they with merry march bring home</L>
<L>To the tent-royal of their emperor;</L>
<L>Who busied in his majesty, surveys</L>

<L>Their heavy burdens, at his narrow gate;</L>
<L>The sad-eyed justice with his surly hum,</L>
<L>Delivering o'er to executors pale,</L>
<L>The lazy yawning drone. I thus inser,</L>
<L>That many things, having full reference</L>
<L>To one consent, may work contrariously.</L>
<L>As many arrows loosed several ways,</L>
<L>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;</L>
<L>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;</L>
<L>As many lines close in the dial's center;</L>

<P>When the ambassadors of France come before Henry, they ask him whether they may speak their errand in express words, or must be restrained to de∣liver the substance of it only, in more covert terms. To which he replies:

<L>We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,</L>
<L>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject,</L>
<L>As are our wretches fettered in our prisons;</L>
<L>Therefore, with frank and with uncurbed plainness,</L>
<L>Tell us the Dauphin's mind.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The above speech is worth noting, considering the maxim generally. Resentment may be excusable in a man, but is unpardonable in a king. In this character he is to consider himself but as one of the states of government only; and legislature is dispas∣sionate. Shall a judge suffer himself to be biassed by private pique, when pronouncing a public sen∣tence? When power is made use of to revenge per∣sonal affronts, royalty ceases, and tyranny begins.</P>

<L>My most redoubted father,</L>
<L>It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe:</L>

<L>But that defences, musters, preparations,</L>
<L>Should be maintained, assembled, and collected,</L>
<L>As were a war in expectation.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>After the surrender of Harfleur, when Henry is on his march to Calais, he is met by Mountjoy, the French Herald, who delivers an insolent defiance from the king of France, requiring to know what ransom he will compound to pay, for leave to retire alive out of the kingdom; to which he replies,
<Q><L>Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,</L>
<L>And tell thy king I do not seek him now,</L>
<L>But could be willing to march on to Calais</L>
<L>Without impeachment; for, to say the <HI>sooth</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b,</HI> an old Saxon word for <HI>truth.</HI></NOTE>,</L>
<L>Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much</L>
<L>Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,</L>
<L>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</L>
<L>My numbers lessened, and those few I have,</L>
<L><HI>Almost no better than so many French;</HI></L>
<L>Who, when they were in health, I tell thee, Herald,</L>
<L>I thought upon one pair of English legs</L>
<L>Did march three Frenchmen—Yet, forgive me, God,</L>
<L>That I do brag thus! this your air of France</L>
<L>Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.</L>
<L>Go, therefore, tell thy master, here I am—</L>
<L>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,</L>
<L>My army but a weak and sickly guard;</L>
<L>Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,</L>
<L>Though France himself, and such another neighbour,</L>
<L>Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Mountjoy;</L>
<L>Go, bid thy master well advise himself—</L>
<L>If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,</L>
<L>We shall your tawny ground with your red blood</L>
<L>Discolour; and so, Mountjoy, fare you well.</L>
<L>The sum of all our answer is but this:</L>
<L>We would not seek a battle, as we are,</L>
<L><PB N="263" REF="273"/>Yet, as we are, we say, we will not shun it—</L>
<L>So tell your master—</L></Q></P>
<P>There is something extremely fine in Henry's reply to the French gasconading taunt above. It is uncommon to meet with so much carelessness and courage in the same character—There is no such description in history, nor have many people, pro∣bably, ever been acquainted with it among the living manners of men; and yet the representation of it appears to be so perfectly natural, that we must greatly admire the talents of a writer, who could thus realize, in effect, a mere idea.</P>
<P>The bravery of Henry scorned to deny the con∣dition of his troops, either with regard to their health or numbers: these circumstances the enemy pretended to have been acquainted with already, or were determined to make an experiment of, at least; he therefore openly acknowledges the truth of his weak situation; and this with the same ease and humour, as he would have delivered himself to Falstaff, had he been his aid-du-camp for the day.
<Q><L>Upon his royal face there is no note,</L>
<L>How dread an army have enrounded him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chorus to Act IV.</NOTE>;</L></Q>
But, at the same time, he most resolutely declares his purpose of trying the event; at every hazard of life, claim, and liberty.</P>
<P>The contemptuous sarcasms he throws out, in this speech, against the French nation, besides shewing an admirable temper and composure of mind in such difficult circumstances, convey also an apt re∣partee to the scornful insolence of the Dauphin; who, in return to Henry's demanding his right of suc∣cession to the crown of France, sent him a parcel of tennis-balls to play with, in allusion to the slight repute of his former life and manners, Pertness is impertinence; but repartee has the <HI>lex talionis,</HI> or law of retaliation, on its side.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="274"/>Shakespeare has a great resemblance to Ariosto, whose stile had a mixture of humour, with sublimity in it. The late ingenious Mr. Hawkins says of the latter,
<Q>His heroes are full of merriment in the midst of danger, and he seldom describes a battle, without a jest.</Q></P>

<P>And again; his excellent composure of mind is manifested further, in this Scene; where he answers the challenges of the guards going their rounds, but without revealing himself.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bates.</SPEAKER>
<P>He hath not told his thought to the king?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; nor is it meet he should; for, though I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am—The violet smells to him, as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing; therefore, when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are; yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by shewing it, should dishearten his army.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="266" REF="276"/>
<SPEAKER>Bates.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may shew what outward courage he will; but, I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in the Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king; I think he would not with himself any where, but where he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bates.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and many poor men's lives saved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, however you speak this to feel other men's minds. Methinks, I could not die any where so contented, as in the king's company; his cause being just, and his quarrel honourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Williams.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than we know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bates.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the king's subjects; if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Williams.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make; when all those legs, and arms, and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, <HI>we died at such a place</HI>; some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeared there are few die well, that fall in battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king, that led them to it, whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, if a son that is sent by his father about merchandize, do fall into some lewd action, and miscarry, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon the father that sent him; or, if a servant under his master's command, transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers, and die in many irrecon∣ciled iniquities, you may call the business of the matter the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so—The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their deaths, when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it with all unspotted soldiers. Some, perad∣venture, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of per∣jury; some making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law, and out-run native punishment, <HI>though they can cut-strip men, they have no wings to fly from God.</HI> War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that herein men are punished, for before-breach of the king's law, in the king's quarrel
<PB N="267" REF="277"/>
now—Where they feared death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unpro∣vided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation, than he was before guilty of those impieties for which they are now visited. Every subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier, in the wars, do as every sick man, in his bed, wash every moth out of his conscience; and, dying so, death is to him an advantage; or, not dying, the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was gained; and to him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, he let him out-live that day to see his greatness, and to teach others how they should prepare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Williams.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis certain that every man that dies ill, the ill is upon his own head; the king is not to answer for it.</P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>In the continuation of this Scene, Williams quar∣rels with the king, still unknown, and they exchange gages with each other, to fight on their next inter∣view. Henry does all this in sport; and I should not have brought it forward to the Reader's view, but that this particular is alluded to, just now, in the Sixteenth Scene of this Act.</P>

<SPEAKER>Exeter.</SPEAKER>
<L>In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,</L>
<L>Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,</L>
<L>Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,</L>
<L>The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.</L>
<L>Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over,</L>
<L>Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped,</L>
<L>And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes</L>
<L>That bloodily did yawn upon his face,</L>
<L>And cries aloud, "Tarry, my cousin Suffolk,</L>
<L>"My soul shall thine keep company to heaven—</L>
<L>"Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly a-breast;</L>
<L>"As in this glorious and well-foughten field</L>
<L>"We kept together in our chivalry."</L>
<L>Upon these words, I came and cheered him up;</L>
<L>He smiled me in the face, gave me his hand,</L>
<L>And with a feeble gripe, says, "Dear my lord,</L>
<L>"Commend my service to my sovereign."</L>
<L>So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>The Poet has most judiciously interrupted Henry's speech, in this critical place. It would have been expected from him to have said something more, upon so interesting an occasion; and yet it would have been impossible to have carried either sentiment or expression higher than Exeter had just done, on the same subject. Shakespeare has herein imitated the address of Timanthes, who, in his picture of the sa∣crifice of Iphigenia, covers her father's head with a veil.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE XIV.</HEAD>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<L>I was not angry, since I came to France,</L>
<L>Until this instant. Take a trumpet, Herald,</L>
<L>Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill;</L>
<L>If they will fight with us, bid them come down,</L>
<L>Or void the field; they do offend our sight;</L>
<L>If they'll do neither, we will come to them,</L>
<L>And make them sker away, as swift as stones</L>
<L>Enforced from the old Assyrian slings.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The first sentence in the above speech, is one among the many instances in which Shakespeare has manifested his thorough knowledge in human nature. Henry acts with an heroic resolution during the whole of this perilous conflict, and replies with a daring and careless spirit to all the insolence and contempt of a powerful enemy; but he expresses no rage, nor betrays the least manner of resentment, throughout. The dangers and difficulties of his situation required the utmost command and preservation of his temper. Distress and affliction are sovereign specifics for the pride and fierceness of man's nature. But these re∣straints being now removed, by his victory, he begins to yield the rein a little to passion, upon seeing the obstinacy of the enemy still continuing after their defeat.</P>

<P>Here the passage hinted above, from the latter part of the Fourth Scene in this Act, comes to be cleared up, when the soldier finds that the unknown person he had engaged to fight with was his king. Upon this occasion he makes an apology for himself, which may have its use in being extended to a general reflection, applicable to all the superior ranks of life; That those who demean themselves below their cha∣racter or dignity, can have no right to challenge that respect from the world, which they might otherwise be intitled to.</P>

<P>In this Scene, a congress is held between the English and French, which is opened by the duke of Burgundy with a declamatory representation of a country during a state of war, which moves me more even than the description of a battle would do. The barbarous scene here set forth, is more general and permanent.—The latter passage, which mentions the condition of uneducated youth, is by much the most affecting part of the picture. The former damage, by labour, money, and a good harvest, may be re∣paired, but neither industry, mines, nor less than an age, can retrieve the other loss.</P>

<P>What Isabel says upon this occasion is very true. Men may be sometimes too sturdy with one another, even in matters of mere punctilio, or of trifling concern; each too proud or obstinate to recede; when the interposition of a woman may remove the difficulty, or compose the ferment, without either of the parties appearing to give up to the other.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Shakespeare appears to be so fond of the person∣age of Henry, that though he has already raised him to the highest pitch in our admiration and esteem, he continues to recommend him to us still further, by introducing him in a new character and situation, that of a lover and a courtier. He did the same for Falstaff before, in the Merry Wives of Windsor, at the request of Queen Elizabeth; but here he enters a volunteer in the service. Had any other writer ventured on such an attempt, he would have rendered him a quite different man from him∣self,
<PB N="279" REF="289"/>
as Racine has <HI>misrepresented</HI> Achilles; but Henry continues to be the same person still, only appearing in new circumstances; the same humour, playful spirit, and careless ease, remain in his courtship, as may be seen in his rallying of Falstaff, replying to Mountjoy, or exchanging gages with the soldier.</P>

<P>O, Kate, nice customs curtsie to great folks. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion—We are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The privileges, or authority of superior rank.</NOTE> that follows our places, stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will do yours for the upholding the nice fashion of your country, in denying me a kiss—Therefore—patiently, and yield∣ing— <STAGE>[Kissing her.]</STAGE>
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a touch of them, than in all the tongues of
<PB N="283" REF="293"/>
the French council; and they would sooner perswade Harry of England, than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>In the last passage of the foregoing dialogue, Henry affords a good subject for reflection, where he speaks of the powerful influence of kings over the manners of a people. The maxim appears to be plausible, but is not true, in every respect. <HI>Rank and example</HI> alone, will not be sufficient for this effect, unsupported by <HI>dignity and precept.</HI> It is not enough for a prince to act well himself, and intend well to morals—He must form a purpose for their support, and be active in his general, as well as private, capacity. A sovereign, indeed, has it in his power, whenever it is in his will, most effectually to encourage virtue, and discourage vice, if he chuses to make this object the rule of his polity. This would be the surest and safest method of rendering himself absolute; for as poor Cardinal Wolsey says—upon a maxim too late discovered—
<Q>"Corruption wins not more than honesty."</Q>
Religion itself has judged it necessary to hold out distant rewards and punishments, to allure and deter mankind, and kings can only have a right to be stiled the vice-gerents of Heaven, when they render these sanctions more immediate. A king is said to have long hands; but they are of no use except to wrap himself up, <HI>while he keeps them folded.</HI></P>
<P>Lewis the Fourteenth happily brought such a <HI>golden age</HI> to bear, toward the latter part of his il∣lustrious reign, if we may give credit to what St. Evremond says, in a letter of his to Ninon de l'Enclos.</P>
<P><Q>You live in a country where people have ex∣traordinary advantages towards saving their souls. There, vice is almost as much against the fashion, as against virtue. Sinning passes for ill-breeding; shocks decency, and offends good manners, as much as religion. Formerly, it sufficed to be
<PB N="284" REF="294"/>
wicked; but, at present, one must be a scoundrel, to be damned, in France. They who have not regard enough for another life, are led to salva∣tion by the consideration and duties of this.</Q></P>
<P>In order to leave the impression of this most in∣teresting and moral reflection more strongly on the minds of the great, the powerful, and the opulent, I shall here conclude my observations on this Piece, so fruitful of example and document, throughout.</P>

<P>We may remember in the former Play, that Henry the Fifth, like a true Christian heroe, imputes all his successes immediately to Heaven; but the good Bishop, I am sorry to say it, like a true priest, <HI>of those days,</HI> here interposes between them, and attributes his pro∣sperity solely to the mediation of the Church.</P>

</SP></Q></P>
<P>A true physical knowledge is here expressed. A great part of personal courage depends upon the animal spirits; and to keep men stout, you must keep them strong. If philosophy should be so dif∣ficult as to deny that good feeding can render a sol∣diery more brave, it must admit, however, that it will render it more serviceable, at least; which is all that we mean to contend for here.</P>

<P>The partiality which we are all apt to manifest to∣wards our own interests, is well noted in this place. This principle is so powerful in human nature, that it not only engages our affections, but warps our judgments also; so that it often imposes on our reason, and frequently makes us continue obstinate, more from error than selfishness. Our opinions dif∣fer, even in matters of no concernment to us; and how much less is it to be expected, that we should be of accord, when we are become a party in the question ourselves?</P>

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<P>There is something extremely moving, in the first part of this Scene, which shews a prison from whence old Earl Mortimer is brought forth in a chair, before the gates, attended by his gaolers. He had been unfortunately declared heir to the Crown, by Richard the Second, and was therefore kept a
<PB N="289" REF="299"/>
prisoner of State, during the reigns of Henrys the Fourth and Fifth, and continued still in confine∣ment, under the present king also.</P>
<P>We are naturally more affected at the distresses of age, infancy, or women, than with what we see suffered by the adult or robust unfortunate. Our compassion rises in proportion to the weakness of the victim, as we become sensible of the inability of resistance, along with the weight of the oppres∣sion.</P>
<P>The earnest desire which the unhappy old man expresses here, for the relief of death, is very na∣tural to a person in his circumstances; and can by no means be deemed reprehensible, in such a situa∣tion, when the completion of the wish is not for∣warded by any act of violence or impatience in the sufferer.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Mortimer.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Kind keepers</HI> of my weak decaying age,</L>
<L>Let dying Mortimer here rest himself—</L>
<L>Even like a wretch new haled from the rack,</L>
<L>So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;</L>
<L>And these grey locks, the <HI>pursuivants of death,</HI></L>
<L>Nestor-like aged in an age of care,</L>
<L>Argue the end of hapless Mortimer.</L>
<L>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</L>
<L>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exigent—End.</HI> We meet with the word no where, in this sense, but here.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>Weak shoulders over-born with burdening grief,</L>
<L>And pithless arms like to a withered vine,</L>
<L>That drops his sapless branches to the ground.</L>
<L>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</L>
<L>Unable to support this lump of clay,</L>
<L>Swift-winged with desire to get a grave;</L>
<L>As witting I no other comfort have.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The first expression above, of <HI>kind keepers,</HI> is most tenderly affecting—A noble and a gallant mind is here represented as being so subdued by the hard∣ness of its condition, as to be reduced to the morti∣fying necessity of soothing and temporizing with the vile ministers of cruelty and oppression!

<P>Here is given a description of the qualifications which had intitled the first Knights of the Garter to that honourable mark of distinction, upon the ori∣ginal institution of the Order; a respect to which has been ever since so <HI>minutely</HI> attended to, that <HI>the same dresses, badges, and vows of chivalry,</HI> have been still preserved free from all violation. The cha∣racter likewise, we are surely to suppose, has been as critically regarded.</P>
<P>Talbot, to the King and Princes, upon an arraign∣ment of <HI>Sir John Fastolfe</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not our quondam merry Knight, though the near resem∣blance of the names, and pusillanimity of the characters, might possibly render the person equivocal to the reader.</NOTE>, Knight of the Garter, for cowardice:
<Q><L>When first this Order was ordained, my lords,</L>
<L>Knights of the Garter were of noble birth;</L>
<L>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage;</L>
<L>Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</L>
<L>Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,</L>
<L>But always resolute in most extremes.</L>
<L>He then that is not furnished in this sort,</L>
<L>Doth but usurp the sacred name of Knight,</L>
<L>Prophaning this most honourable Order;</L>
<L>And should, if I were worthy to be judge,</L>

<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>The following reflection has too often been made, both before and since the aera here pointed out. It is shocking to humanity, as well as to religion, to think that there should ever have been, and should still continue, such frequent occasions to repeat it.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>I always thought,</L>
<L>It was both impious, and unnatural,</L>
<L>That such immanity and bloody strife</L>
<L>Should reign among professors of one faith.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>In the same Scene, when the king is urged to think of marrying, he very properly objects to the
<PB N="291" REF="301"/>
proposal, both on account of his youth, and the necessity of applying his mind to the studies becoming his rank and situation.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Marriage? Alas! my years are yet too young;</L>
<L>And fitter is my study and my books,</L>
<L>Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Such considerations, it seems, were regarded in those days, and in the time of our Author likewise, or he would not have commented on the subject. Are we grown wiser?</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="8" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>This same topic of matrimony is fully discussed, and in a more general and liberal manner, in the pre∣sent Scene, upon Exeter's objecting to the match proposed, on account of the Princess mentioned not being sufficiently endowed with fortune.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Suffolk.</SPEAKER>
<L>A dower, my lords! Disgrace not so your king,</L>
<L>That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</L>
<L>To chuse for wealth, and not for perfect love.</L>
<L>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</L>
<L>And need not seek a queen to make him rich.</L>
<L>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</L>
<L>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</L>
<L><HI>But marriage is a matter of more worth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than to be dealt in by attorney-ship.</HI></L>
<L>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</L>
<L>Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</L>
<L>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</L>
<L>It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</L>
<L>In our opinions she should be preferred;</L>
<L><HI>For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,</HI></L>
<L><HI>An age of discord and continual strife?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whereas the contrary bringeth forth bliss,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>These arguments are certainly conclusive, in pri∣vate life; and if <HI>reasons of state</HI> may be allowed to stand against them, in the supremest rank, I shall only conclude my remarks on this Piece, with a line of an old song, in favour of our natural and char∣tered liberties,

<P><PB N="298" REF="307"/>The above scene closes, very properly, with a truly Christian sentiment, by the King, who is, all through, represented by Shakespeare as a religious▪ moral, domestic, easy-tempered man;
<Q>Famed for mildness, peace, and prayer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Third Part.</NOTE>:</Q>
Just such a prince, whose very goodness, for want of sense and spirit, must ever render the dupe of Mi∣nisters, and the sport of Faction.</P>
<P>No document, no example, are so effectual a warn∣ing to the mind, as the view of a wicked person in his last moments. This speaks to the heart, as well as to the understanding. We then see things and actions in their true light, which the false glare of gain or pleasure, or the involved and complicated nature of sin, are but too apt to hide from our notice. Vice would disgust even those that practise it, if they did not use arts to conceal the vileness of it from their own view. We drink liquors out of a cup, which are too foul to bear a glass.</P>
<P>He who has betrayed a friend, deceived a mistress, wronged the orphan, or oppressed the poor, must surely never have seen a penitent on his death-bed! What desperate madness, then, must it be, ever to do a deed, for any advantage in life, which after so short—<HI>so very short</HI>—a space of time, we would give a galaxy of worlds to have undone again!</P>
<P>This is the only way of rendering dramatic deaths profitable to the spectators. All the pantomime contortions, writhings, and flouncings, of modern representations, cannot possibly produce such an ef∣fect on the audience, as this single expression, <HI>He dies, and makes no sign.</HI></P>

<P>Shakespeare lays hold of every occasion that fairly presents itself, to put his readers out of conceit with greatness. And, in truth, the state of kings in ge∣neral, even the happiest of them, who are un∣doubtedly <HI>those whose power is limited,</HI> is not much to be envied. Their public care, if they rule alone, or their private hazard, if they depute the helm, must deny them ease, the only foundation for earthly happiness or enjoyment to rest upon. Kings may, in some sort, be compared to Popish idols, which are worshipped and led about in pageant procession, for the purpose of procuring some partial wish of the people; which if not obtained, however unreason∣able the petition, they are then scourged, and laid by in disgrace.</P>

<P>MR.

The Antients have left us an humane maxim, <HI>that we should never speak ill of the dead.</HI> I think we should carry this moral even further, <HI>by doing them every justice in our power.</HI> What has particularly induced me to make this remark, is, that Doctor Johnson says he can observe but two expressions of the old phraseology, throughout these three Plays. I do not mean to make any comparison between the sense, knowledge, or litera∣ture of these two critics; but Dr. Johnson is alive, to answer for himself, and poor Theobald must now speak by another's tongue.</NOTE>; and Doctor Warburton is of the same opinion, from the want of spirit and effect in the composition. If I was to offer an objection to the authenticity of these Pieces, it should be rather from their barrenness of sentiment, or reflection; though I think there is enough of the stile and manner of Shakespeare, in them all, to evince them to be his.</P>

<P>Upon the occasion of Queen Margaret and War∣wick's going to France, one to solicit the aid of Lewis for Lancaster, and the other for York, poor Henry makes a very natural reflection, foreboding how the ballance will probably incline, where interest holds the scales between two supplicants, whereof one has only something <HI>to ask,</HI> and the other some∣thing <HI>to proffer.</HI></P>

<L>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</L>

<L>With promise of his sister, and what else,</L>

<P>This long Scene, in which Richard courts Lady Anne, relict of the first Prince of Wales, son to Henry the Sixth, whom he had murdered, is so well known to every one who has ever read or seen this Play, that I need not be at the trouble of transcrib∣ing it, though I shall take the liberty of remarking on the very improbable conclusion of it.</P>
<P>Women are certainly most extremely ill used, in the unnatural representation of female frailty, here given. But it may, perhaps, be some palliation of his offence, to observe that this strange fable was not any invention of the poet; though it must indeed be confessed that he yielded too easy a credence to a fictitious piece of history, which rested upon no better authority than the same that affirmed the de∣formity of Richard; which fact has lately, from a concurrence of cotemporary testimonies, been ren∣dered

<P>The evil report of things said to be spoken to the disadvantage of others, behind their backs, has so frequently been found to proceed either from the malice or mistake of eaves-droppers, listeners, or in∣cendiaries, that it should warn us, upon such occa∣sions, to suspend our resentments against the persons charged, till we find the indictment to be grounded on better evidence than those pests of society the in∣formers, intermeddlers, or tale-bearers. Besides which, as is above observed, every reasonable allowance ought to be made for the natural frowardness and peevishness of disorder, or other uneasiness of body or mind, which often sets us first at variance with ourselves, before it inclines us to quarrel with others

<P>Shakespeare is extremely rich in such sentiments of piety and resignation. It is a vast ease to the distressed mind, to communicate its griefs to the ear of a friend, though he can only condole, but not relieve them. How infinitely higher, then, must the comfort rise, to repose them on the bosom of our God, who can not only console, but compensate them!

<P>Now nothing can demonstrate the investigating faculties of Shakespeare, more than this passage does. He never lived in any times of commotion himself, therefore the particular knowledge he here shews, in the general nature of such a crisis, must be owing more to philosophy than experience; rather to his own reflection, than any knowledge of history. I speak with regard to the English writers only, on such subjects; who were all, before his time, most barren of observation and maxim. And as to the Greek and Roman historiographers, who were rich in both, the invidious Commentators of our Poet have denied him any manner of acquaintance with such <HI>outlandish literati</HI>; and I also, though from a very different principle, have <HI>joined issue</HI> with them before, in this particular <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a note on Ely's speech, Hen.

<P>The poor unhappy Prince of Wales, successor to Edward the Fourth, makes a reflection here, so becom∣ing the natural spirit of a noble mind, that it must raise a regret in the Reader, that he was not permitted to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve and reign over a brave and a free people.</P>
<P>When his wicked uncle Richard appoints the Prince's residence at the <HI>Tower,</HI> till his coronation, he asks who built that fortress? and being told it was Julius Caesar, he says,
<Q><L>That Julius Caesar was a famous man:</L>

<SPEAKER>Ely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart. <STAGE>Exit Ely.</STAGE></P>
</SP></Q>
<P>Could any writer but Shakespeare have ever thought of such a circumstance, in the midst of a deep tragedy, as the sending an old grave Bishop on an errand for a <HI>leaf of strawberries?</HI> and this, in the most formal scene of the Play too, where the lords are met in council, to settle about the day for the corona∣tion?</P>
<P>But could any writer but himself have attempted such a whim, without setting the audience a-laughing at the ridiculousness and absurdity of such an inci∣dent? And yet he contrives, some-how or other, to hold us in awe, all the while; though he must be a very ingenious critic, indeed, who can supply any sort of reason for the introduction of such a familiar and comic stroke, upon so serious an occasion. And
<PB N="317" REF="324"/>
what renders the solution of this passage still more difficult, is, that the request is made by a person, too, whose mind was deeply intent on murder and usurpation, at the very time.</P>
<P>None of the editors have taken the least notice of this article; and the first notion that occurred to me upon it, was, that perhaps Richard wanted to get rid of old Ely, after any manner, however indecent or abrupt, in order to be at liberty to plot with Buck∣ingham in private; for the moment the Bishop goes out on his errand, he says,
<Q>Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.</Q>
But as he did not send the rest of the Council-Board a-packing after him, and adjourn them from <HI>the bed of justice</HI> to the <HI>strawberry bed,</HI> but retires immediately himself with his complotter Buckingham, we cannot suppose this idea to have been the purpose intended by so extraordinary a motion.</P>
<P>There is, then, no other way left us to resolve this text, than to impute it solely to the peculiar cha∣racter that Shakespeare has given us all along of this extraordinary personage; whom he has represented throughout, as preserving a facetious humour, and exerting a sort of careless ease, in the midst of all his crimes.</P>
<P>I am sorry not to be able to give a better account of this particular, than what I have here offered; because, if it is to rest upon such a comment, our author must, in this instance, be thought to have be∣trayed a manifest ignorance in human nature, or the nature of guilt at least; as no vicious person, I do not mean those of profligate manners merely, but no designing or determined villain was ever chearful, yet, or could possibly be able to assume even the semblance of carelessness or ease, upon any occasion whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="325"/>In the latter part of this Scene, poor Hastings, just before he mounts the scaffold, makes a reflection, which too frequently occurs to those <HI>who put their trust in princes</HI>; or, indeed, in general, to all who rest their hope on any other stay but their own upright∣ness and virtue.</P>

<P>Among the various crimes of man, murder stands in a distinct class above them all; except, perhaps, suicide, as being of the same species, may be allowed to rank with, or even to exceed, it. The latter par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this position, tho', has been disputed by some mo∣ral casuists; but I shall enter no further into the ar∣gument here, than just to observe, that one of these acts does not shock the human mind so much as the other. We are sensible of a tenderness and compas∣sion for the unhappy self-devoted victim, but are impressed both with an horror and detestation against the homicide.</P>
<P>But the circumstance which most eminently distin∣guishes both of these crimes from every other species of guilt, is their being so wholly repugnant to na∣ture. In other vices, we may suffer a temptation, and have only a moral struggle to conquer; but one must be trained, be <HI>educated</HI> to these, must stifle sympa∣thy, and overcome our <HI>first,</HI> by a <HI>second</HI> nature.</P>
<P>And of all murders, from the days of <HI>Herod</HI> to these, the killing a child must surely raise a stronger war in the most hardened villain's breast, than the slaughter of an adult. Its innocence, its engaging manners, even its very helplessness, must plead so movingly in its defence, as to render the deed, one should think, impossible! Might not the idea of a
<PB N="319" REF="326"/>
child's coming so recently out of the hands of its Creator, serve also to impress an additional awe on the mind of the malefactor, at such a time? If su∣perstition can ever be excused for its weakness, it must surely be in such an instance as this.</P>
<P>Shakespeare has wrought up an horrid and affect∣ing picture, in this scene, upon the latter part of this subject, where he makes one of the murderers give an account of the massacre of Edward's two chil∣dren.</P>
<Q><SP>

<L>Within their innocent alabaster arms;</L>
<L>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,</L>
<L>And in their summer beauty kissed each other.</L>
<L>A book of prayers on their pillow lay,</L>

<P>In this Scene, the adverse camps are supposed to be pitched near each other at night, ready to join battle in the morning; and in the space between, the spirits of all the persons murdered by <HI>Richard</HI> arise, threatening destruction to him, and promising suc∣cess to <HI>Richmond.</HI> But the ghosts here are not to be taken literally; they are to be understood only as an allegorical representation of those images or ideas which naturally occur to the minds of men during their sleep, referring to the actions of their lives, whether good or bad.</P>
<P><Q>Sweet are the slumbers of the virtuous man,</Q>
says Addison, in his Cato; and a modern writer, in a poem on the subject of dreams, most emphatically expresses himself thus:
<Q><L>Nor are the oppressor's crimes in sleep forgot;</L>

<P>That this is the sense in which our Poet meant this scene to be accepted, is fully evident from his representing both <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> to have been asleep during the apparition, and therefore capable

of receiving those notices in <HI>the mind</HI>'s <HI>eye</HI> only, as Hamlet says; which intirely removes the seeming absurdity of such an exhibition.</P>

<P><PB N="322" REF="329"/>Such is the nature of man, that the slightest alarm, arising from within, discomfits him more than the greatest dangers presenting themselves from without. Body may be overcome by body, but the mind only can conquer itself. Notions of religion are natural to all men, in some sort or other. The good are inspired by devotion, the bad terrified by superstition. The admonitions of conscience are taken for super∣natural emotions, and this awes us more than any dif∣ficulty in the common course of things.

<P>There is an excellent lesson for kings, given in this place, as well as in many other passages of Shakespeare. The honour and safety of princes are so much confided to the sense and conduct of their Ministers, that such trustees for the State should be ever selected with the nicest judgment and strictest impartiality; in which choice, virtue should be at least <HI>equally</HI> regarded with talents. Were the crown testamentary, a sovereign should be circumspect to whose hands he intrusted the government of his people, even after his death; and how much more solicitous ought he to be, with respect to those ap∣pointed to rule, while his own glory and interest lie so immediately at stake!</P>

<L>I am solicited, not by a few,</L>
<L>And those of true condition, that your subjects</L>
<L>Are in great grievance. There have been commissions</L>
<L>Sent down among them, which have flawed the heart</L>
<L>Of all their loyalties; wherein, although,</L>
<L>My good lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches</L>
<L>Most bitterly on you, as putter on</L>

<L><HI>Whose honour Heaven shield from soil, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e 'scapes not</HI></L>
<L><HI>Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks</HI></L>
<L><HI>The s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des of loyalty, and almost appears</HI></L>
<L><HI>In loud rebellion. . . . .</HI></L>
<L>This makes bold mouths;</L>
<L>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</L>
<L>Allegiance in them; all their curses, now,</L>
<L>Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass,</L>
<L>That tractable obedience is a slave</L>
<L>To each incensed will. I would your highness</L>
<L>Would give it quick consideration, for</L>
<L>There is no primer business.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>But before we close this Scene, let us shew our impartiality, by suffering the Minister to speak a few words in his own defence; which he does, very well, by urging reflections that have a good deal of truth in them, and shew the danger and difficulty of such a station, even in the best and ablest hands.</P>

<P>Here the unhappy Buckingham, in his <HI>last speech,</HI> as it may be called, just before his execution, on recapitulating the vicissitudes and misfortunes of his family, makes proper reflections on the indiscretion of placing a confidence in the fidelity of mean de∣pendants.</P>

<P>I designed to have left off above, at the period in the last line but four, as the speech ended properly there, as far as it related to the argument I had framed upon it; but I actually felt myself impressed with somewhat like an idea of impiety, to interrupt the speaker, before he had concluded his prayer—I am sensible of a certain refined pleasure, in the sen∣timent which prompted my pen further on this pas∣sage; however, the <HI>stronger mind</HI> of the Reader may amuse himself at the weakness and superstition of my motive.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<P>The character of Queen Catharine is finely drawn in this Play. A becoming demeanour is preserved
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
throughout every situation and circumstance she is placed in. She discovers that dignity and spirit which become the wife and daughter of a king, shews the duty and obedience which a husband and a sovereign have a right to claim, and speaks, on her own part, with such a noble confidence, as in∣jured innocence may fully warrant. One can never be too much assured, in a just cause, either of their own, or of others; for whoever defends the rights of the oppressed, fights under the banner of Provi∣dence.</P>
<P>I shall not interrupt the following dialogues, as far as they relate to her, to point out the passages which may be applied to the several parts of the character above given of her; but, as in former instances of the same kind, in the course of these notes, shall leave the Reader to mark and refer them himself, as he goes along.</P>

<L>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,</L>

<L>Born out of your dominions; having here</L>
<L>No judge indifferent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Impartial.</NOTE>, and no more assurance</L>

<L>In what have I offended you? What cause</L>

<L>He were mine enemy? What friend of mine,</L>
<L>That had to him derived your anger, did I</L>
<L>Continue in my liking? Nay, gave not notice</L>
<L>He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind,</L>
<L>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</L>
<L>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</L>
<L>With many children by you; if, in the course</L>

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<P>The present Scene presents us with a second ob∣ject of compassion, which though it interests us after a different manner from the former, as neither being so innocent, nor suffering so unjustly; yet, shall I hazard the expression? affects us almost as much. We do not, indeed, feel our minds impressed with such a tender sensibility towards the latter, as the first; but, for the honour and dignity of human nature, let me say, that our commiseration, in the second case, arises from principles of a nobler kind; from our forgiveness of the penitent, and our com∣passion for his misfortunes, softened still more by our sorrow for his guilt: so that, upon the whole, the generosity of our sentiment, in one instance, nearly equals the sympathy of it, in the other.</P>
<P>The true supputation of the precariousness and instability of all worldly happiness and greatness, with the fit temper and resignation to bear their loss, are most pathetically and poetically set forth, in the following beautiful and affecting scene.</P>

<STAGE>in his disgrace.</STAGE>
<L>Farewel, a long farewel, to all my greatness!</L>
<L>This is the state of man—To-day he puts forth</L>
<L>The tender leaves of hopes, to-morrow blossoms,</L>
<L>And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;</L>
<L>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,</L>
<L>And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely</L>
<L>His greatness is a ripening, nips his root,</L>
<L>And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,</L>
<L>Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,</L>
<L>These many summers in a sea of glory,</L>
<L>But far beyond my depth; my high-blown pride</L>
<L>At length broke under me, and now has left me,</L>
<L>Weary and old with service, to the mercy</L>
<L>Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.</L>
<L>Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye—</L>
<L>I feel my heart new opened—Oh, how wretched</L>
<L>Is that poor man, that hangs on Princes' favours!</L>
<L>There is, between that smile we would aspire to,</L>

<HEAD>LEAR.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be necessary to many Readers to premise, that the Piece here under consideration, is the Play as originally written by Shakespeare, left the bearing it in mind as altered by <HI>Tate,</HI> and generally acted so, might occasion confusion or mistakes, in the following notes and observations.</P>
<P>The Critics are divided in their opinions between the original and the altered copy. Some prefer the first, as a more general representation of human life, where fraud too often succeeds, and innocence suf∣fers: others prefer the latter, as a more moral de∣scription of what life should be.</P>
<P>But argument in this, as in many other cases, had better be left quite out of the question; for our feel∣ings are often a surer guide than our reason; and by this criterion I may venture to pronounce, that the reader or spectator will always be better pleased with the happy, than the unfortunate, catastrophe of innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>Besides, if Dramatic exhibitions are designed, as they certainly should be, to recommend virtue and discourage vice, there cannot remain the least man∣ner of dispute in our minds, whether Shakespeare or Tate have fulfilled Horace's precept of <HI>utile dulci</HI> the best. However, if <HI>pity</HI> and <HI>terror,</HI> as the Critics say, are the principal objects of Tragedy, surely no Play that ever was written can possibly answer both these ends better than this performance, as it stands in the present text.</P>
<P>The Reader, I hope, will not think that I have exceeded the <HI>line</HI> I had prescribed to myself, in the conduct of this Work, by my hazarding the above criticism, as the subject may be still considered as of
<PB N="352" REF="358"/>
a moral nature or tendency, and may, therefore, not improperly be consorted with the rest of my remarks upon this estimable author.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gloster.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did always seem so to us; but, now, in his division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for qualities are so weighed, that curiosity <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Curiosity,</HI> for <HI>scrutiny.</HI></NOTE> in neither can make choice of either's moiety.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>This is a fine description of a parent's distributive justice, in the division of a fortune between his chil∣dren. Their claims are all equal in nature, and should be still preserved so in equity, except where particular usages may have obtained, or political laws have made a difference; in which cases, to ob∣serve the rule of nature would be a species of in∣justice.</P>
<P>I speak here with regard to conduct; of principle only, and not of affection; for 'tis often impossible for the most virtuous or impartial parent to refrain from loving one child better than another. A inn∣discriminate regard, in any case, towards two objects, though ever so much alike or estimable, is unnatural to the most impartial mind; and though our reason should not be able to give a preference, our feelings will.</P>
<P>The oft-disputed <HI>free will</HI> of man may be suffi∣ciently proved from this innate self-determination, which his mind possesses. We must make a choice, even without our being able to make a distinction. It must be an ass, indeed, that can remain in sus∣pence even <HI>between two bundles of hay.</HI> But this in∣voluntary election we are not answerable for in
<PB N="353" REF="359"/>
ethics; we are accountable only for our manner of acting towards our children; in which their moral merits alone can justify superior marks of preference or favour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lear</SPEAKER>
<L>And 'tis our fast intent</L>
<L>To shake all cares and business from our age,</L>
<L>Conferring them on younger strengths; while we</L>
<L>Unburdened crawl toward death.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This is a rational, a manly, and a virtuous pur∣pose. But how few are possessed of souls <HI>great</HI> enough to relinquish <HI>greatness!</HI> Indeed, the rare ex∣amples of those who have done so, as Charles the Fifth, and some others, would not encourage one to make the experiment. But then it ought to be en∣quired into, whether the instances of abdication had been prompted by any of the principles above-men∣tioned, or no; for mere fits of devotion, or disgust, are seldom long or strong enough, to support the mind under such a dereliction.</P>
<P>Besides, habit is a most powerful thing; and per∣sons used to occupation of any kind, are apt to feel an irksome vacuity and weariness in themselves, with an oppressive tediousness of time lying on their hands, whenever they cease from employment. This has been the confession of all the merchants, lawyers, farmers, and physicians, I have ever known, or heard of, who had retired from their professions, or quitted their ordinary scenes of action, late in life. When∣ever, therefore, such an experiment is attempted, it should arise from a <HI>principle,</HI> not from a <HI>preference</HI>; because the choice must be ventured upon, before the comparison can be tried.</P>
<P>In the same Scene, when Lear requires his three daughters to declare the several portions of their love and respect towards him, the eldest addresses herself to him thus:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Goneril.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir,</L>
<L>I love you more than words can wield the matter,</L>
<L><PB N="354" REF="360"/>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;</L>
<L>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</L>
<L>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</L>
<L>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</L>
<L>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable,</L>
<L>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Upon this speech, the youngest daughter says to herself, aside,
<Q>What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.</Q></P>
<P>After Goneril has had her portion marked out, the second steps forward, in order to earn her's.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Regan.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm made of that self-metal as my sister,</L>
<L>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,</L>
<L>I find she names my very deed of love,</L>
<L>Only she comes too short: that I profess</L>
<L>Myself an enemy to all other joys,</L>
<L>Which the most precious square of sense possesses,</L>
<L>And find I am alone felicitate,</L>
<L>In your dear highness love.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Here the sincere and unprofessing Cordelia whispers to herself again:
<Q><L>Then poor Cordelia!</L>
<L>And yet not so, since I am sure my love's</L>
<L>More ponderous than my tongue.</L></Q></P>
<P>When Lear has endowed Regan also, he next proceeds to challenge Cordelia upon the same ques∣tion; asking her what she has to say, to shew her love equal to her sisters; her only answer is,
<Q>Nothing, my lord.</Q></P>
<P>But, indeed, what was there left for her to say, after such hyperbolical professions as had been just made before her? However, I dare pronounce, that any reader, who is at all acquainted with human na∣ture, without looking any further into the story, be∣yond the present scene, must have already determined the point in his own mind, which of the daughter's duties or affections were most to be relied upon.</P>
<P>No passion can either bear or justify exaggeration, but love alone. There the extravagance of trans∣port, and the enthusiasm of devotement, prove the
<PB N="355" REF="361"/>
<HI>luxuriance</HI> of the soil; but in every other instance, betray the <HI>sterility</HI> of it. There is, in reality, no other passion in the human breast, but love. All other affec∣tions, such as avarice, duty, envy, revenge, or am∣bition, arise from some foreign sentiment, are founded on principle, or instigated by vice or pride. These we may be educated, tempted, or provoked to; but the former is a spontaneous and involuntary impulse of the soul, a certain attractive force, that can nei∣ther be dictated to us by moral, nor restrained by document.</P>

<P>Thus do all profligates, who deserve to be the outcasts of society, betake themselves to the asylum of Nature. Whenever the laws of God or man oppose their vices, they immediately adopt her for their deity and their legislator; whom they cannot fail to find a most indulgent patroness, as they are sure to interpret all their own wills and passions to be her unerring dictates.</P>
<P>Lucretius, the expositor of Epicurus, in his un∣philosophic poem on the nature of things, addresses himself to the same goddess, under the appellation of <HI>Venus,</HI> whom he makes to precede and supersede the gods, representing them as a set of lethargic beings of
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
her creation, and leaving them to doze away their immortalities wrapt up in their empyreal <HI>Pantheon.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SCENE VII.</HEAD>
<P>Shakespeare, as I have had opportunities of ob∣serving before, takes frequent occasions of represent∣ing the horrid condition of a nation under the in∣fliction of a civil war. His descriptions deserve to be collected together into one chapter, as a document both to prince and people; for the warning is equally necessary to each; as, whatever may be the final event, they must be alike sufferers, under such a ca∣lamity. For in such a conflict, those are likely to gain most, who have the least to lose. These reflec∣tions refer to the following passage in this Scene.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Gloster.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father. We have seen the best of our time.

<P>The impious and unphilosophic method that peo∣ple are too generally apt to apply toward the lighten∣ing of their consciences, and relieving their miseries, by imputing their vices and misfortunes to fate, ne∣cessity, or the harmless stars presiding at their births, instead of their own wickedness or indiscretions, is well satirized and exposed in the following speech, though it has not, I think, been put into a proper mouth to speak.</P>

<P>These maxims should not lose their credit or ef∣fect, on account of the character which utters them; for Shakespeare's fools are not those of <HI>modern times,</HI> but speak a great deal of good sense throughout all his Plays. Besides, these sort of privileged persons, stiled formerly <HI>kings' jesters,</HI> were usually men of wit and parts, a sort of free speakers, who were indulged
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>
in a liberty of telling truths, or making reflections on their master's conduct, without being reprehended or restrained. And as they were the only courtiers who were permitted such a licence, they deserved more properly to be deemed the <HI>king</HI>'s <HI>friends,</HI> than to have been stigmatized by either of the other denominations.</P>

<P>The curses which the justly provoked father de∣nounces here, against his unnatural daughters, are so very horrid and shocking to humanity, that I shall not offend my Reader by quoting them; though Shakespeare, I am convinced, supplied them merely in order to raise an abhorrence in his audience, against two of the greatest crimes in the black list of deadly sins, namely, ingratitude and undutifulness; and to shew, as the injured parent most emphatically ex∣presses it, in the same passage,

<P>In this same Scene, and upon account of Kent's warmth and impatience of speech and temper, though still under the disguise of an hireling attendant on Lear, there is a very good description given of such a person as he appears to be; a character frequently to be met with in life, though the speaker is mis∣taken in the application of it to the honest Duke, who might very properly be said, in the sense of the expression above given, to have been the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>friend.</HI></P>

<P>When Gloster makes an apology to Lear, here, for not pressing his son, the duke of Cornwal, a second time, to an interview with him, on account of the <HI>fiery quality</HI> of the Duke, as also having brought an answer from him that he was not well, the injured Monarch resents it thus:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lear.</SPEAKER>
<L>The king would speak with Cornwal—The dear father</L>
<L>Would with his daughter speak—commands her service—</L>
<L>Are they informed of this? My breath and blood!</L>

<L>No, but not yet—May be, he is not well—</L>
<L>Infirmity doth still neglect all office,</L>
<L>Whereto our health is bound; we're not ourselves,</L>
<L>When nature, being opprest, commands the mind</L>
<L>To suffer with the body—I'll forbear;</L>
<L>And am fall'n out with my more headier will,</L>
<L>To take the indisposed and sickly fit,</L>
<L>For the sound man.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The surprize and resentment expressed in the first part of the above speech, is just and natural; but the pause of recollection which afterwards abates his anger, is extremely fine, both in the reasonable∣ness of the reflection, and the humanity of the sentiment.</P>
<P>This beautiful passage, with many others of the same tender kind, which follow in the course of developing Lear's character, and which I shall oc∣casionally refer back from to this note, render this unhappy man a real object both of commiseration and esteem, notwithstanding the weakness, passion, and injustice he has so fully exposed in the beginning of this Play.</P>
<P>No writer that ever lived was capable of draw∣ing a mixed character, equal to Shakespeare; for no one has ever seemed to have dived so deep into
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
Nature, as himself.—Frequent instances of this ad∣mirable talent in him, may be selected from his Works. Most other authors, in their descriptions of men, present us either with <HI>a flowery mead,</HI> or <HI>a savage desart</HI>; but the <HI>demesne</HI> of human nature, which includes both the fruitful field and the barren waste, within one inclosure, is rarely delineated by common writers.</P>

<P>Here poor Lear seems to make some kind of amends for his former violence; for though the provocation continues still the same, nay rather, in∣deed, is increased by the repetition of it, yet he contents himself, in this place, with barely upbraid∣ing and reviling the offender, but refrains from add∣ing curses to his reproaches.</P>
<P>Human nature is equally discernible in both these instances. The suddenness of his rage, on the first in∣jury, might have wrested those anathemas from him, involuntarily; but before the second occasion presented itself, his fury had had time to abate, and he then restrains his speech within the bounds of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustifiable resentment.</P>

<P>Can there be a finer passage, or a more admoni∣tory one, than this? If, upon all our dangers or ca∣lamities, we should enter thus into a strict self-exa∣mination of our consciences and conduct, it might naturally produce a most salutary effect on our future lives; as, on such a scrutiny we should, perhaps, oftener find our misfortunes to be, not our <HI>diseases,</HI> but our <HI>medicines</HI>; and from thence be brought to say, with the Psalmist, <HI>Happy has it been for me, that I have been afflicted!</HI></P>
<P>In the same Scene, Lear, speaking to the Fool, who was appointed to shew him the way to Edgar's hovel, where he might be able to shelter himself from the storm, says,
<Q><L>Where is the straw, my fellow?</L>
<L>The art of our necessities is strange,</L>
<L>That can make vile things precious.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="368"/>The truth of this observation is too obvious from experience, to need being insisted on; but I shall here add the remainder of the speech, as it may be referred to, and helps to justify, the second para∣graph of my remark on the Tenth Scene above, in the former Act.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lear.</SPEAKER>
<L>Come, your hovel—</L>
<L>Poor fool and knave, <HI>I've one part in my heart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That's sorry yet for thee.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="5" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE V.</HEAD>
<P>When they have arrived near the hovel, Lear changes his purpose, on account of a reason he afterwards gives, regarding the distracted state of his mind; and being pressed by Kent, who just then joins him, to take shelter from the outrage of the night, he cries,
<Q>Let me alone.</Q>
And being intreated, a second time, he repeats the same answer. But upon being further urged by the kind earnestness of his poor servant, which Kent still preserves the appearance of, he then exclaims, with emotion,
<Q>Wilt break my heart?</Q></P>
<P>How truly affecting is this short expostulation, if quickly conceived? It was not the importunity of Kent, that he meant to observe upon; the expression needed not to have been so tender, to have marked such an offence: Princes are apt to resent the con∣trolement of their wills or actions, in a severer stile. But it was the instantaneous comparison between the barbarity of his own daughters, which had reduced him to such a wretched condition, and the humanity of a common alien kindly pressing him to a shelter from it, that so suddenly struck and affected his mind, at that moment—This thought, indeed, might well be said to <HI>break his heart</HI>; and to have added a single word more, to explain this sentiment, would have marred the whole beauty of the passage.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="369"/>Upon Kent's still continuing his entreaty, he still refuses to comply, but reasons with him thus:
<Q><L>Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm</L>
<L>Invades us to the skin—So 'tis to thee—</L>
<L>But where the greater malady is fixt,</L>
<L>The lesser is scarce felt—Thou'dst shun a bear;</L>
<L>But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,</L>
<L>Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,</L>
<L>The body's delicate—The tempest in my mind</L>
<L>Doth from my senses take all feeling else,</L>
<L>Save what beats there</L></Q></P>
<P>This is the true nature of the human mind; the greater evil always swallowing up the lesser, as the rod of Moses did the other serpents. And in great calamities I do not know but it might, perhaps, be an advantage to have some other ills of an inferior nature to combat with, at the same time; for, as Lear says, just after, as his reason for refusing to take shelter,
<Q><L>This tempest will not give me leave to ponder,</L>
<L>On things would hurt me more.</L></Q></P>
<P>When he consents, at last, to enter the hut, he presses his two attendants to go in first, saying,
<Q>I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which he immediately falls into the follow∣ing beautiful apostrophe:
<Q><L>You houseless poverty,</L>
<L>Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,</L>
<L>That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,</L>
<L>How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,</L>
<L>Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you</L>
<L>From seasons such as these? <HI>O, I have ta'en</HI></L>
<L><HI>Too little care of this—Take physic, Pomp;</HI></L>

<L><HI>And shew the Heavens more just!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Here also, I shall beg leave to refer the Reader back to the second paragraph of my remark on the Tenth Scene of the Second Act.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="370"/>This puts me in mind of two good lines, on the same subject, which I met with in a very pretty little moral Poem, lately published <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Miss More, of Bristol.</NOTE>.</P>

</SP></Q>
<P>He utters this reflection, upon considering the comparative distresses to which Lear had been re∣duced; and his observation being drawn both from nature and the immediate object then before him, has a double beauty and force in this place, and should be remembered and applied, in all such cases. Let us compare our own ills with those of others, especially of persons, who from their superior rank and fortune may be supposed to be better defended from injury than ourselves, and it may conduce to render our minds often more acquiescent in our own sufferings.</P>

<P>Shakespeare gives us, here, a poetical paraphrase on the flattering old English proverb, that <HI>when things are at the worst, they'll mend.</HI> He has com∣menced the speech with a noble and liberal senti∣ment,
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>
and concludes it with a reflection drawn from the adage, in these lines:
<Q><L>World, world, O world!</L>

<L>As flies to wanton boys, are we to the Gods;</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>This is a most impious and unphilosophic reflec∣tion. Poor Gloster seems, by this expression, to have been rather soured, than softened, by his mis∣fortunes; which his attempted suicide afterwards proves still further. Such a sentiment must certainly surprize us, in Shakespeare, when uttered by a per∣son of so good a character as Gloster—It could not so offend, in the mouth of Edmund, though better not spoken at all.</P>

<P>Lear had before given us the same moral, as taken notice of in my remark on the Fifth Scene of the former Act; but I have quoted this passage, notwithstanding, as containing a sentiment which cannot be too often inculcated.

<P>When this good Duke is reproaching his wife, here, for the barbarous treatment she had given her father, she interrupts him with,
<Q>No more—'Tis foolish.</Q></P>
<P>To which he replies, very justly,
<Q><L>Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;</L>
<L>Filths savour but themselves. . . . . .</L></Q></P>
<P>It is, indeed, too much the horrid nature of vice and folly, not only to rejoice in its own wickedness and weakness, but, as Albany says, to depreciate all wisdom and goodness in others. The Moor would have all faces black.</P>
<P>He says, further on in the same speech,
<Q><L>If that the Heavens do not their visible spirits</L>
<L>Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,</L>
<L>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,</L>
<L>Like monsters of the deep.</L></Q></P>
<P>This sentiment was as emphatically expressed, be∣fore, on the close of the last Scene of the former Act, by two mean attendants who were witnesses to the cruelties exercised by Cornwal and Regan, on Gloster's eyes; but I forbore to quote it, 'till I came to this passage.</P>

<P>But to return again to the Scene with Albany and Goneril.</P>
<P>She replies to his humane remonstrances and just reproaches, in these words:
<Q><L>Milk-livered man!</L>
<L>That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;</L>
<L>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning</L>

<P>What she means by the last lines, is, that it is necessary to guard against foreseen evils, as well as to defend against those that press us; but fools be∣ing too short-sighted to see the prevention in the punishment, are apt to bewail the sufferer.</P>

<P>The honest old <HI>king</HI>'s <HI>friend</HI> having sent off this person with dispatches to Cordelia, then Queen of France, importing the miserable situation of her father, questions him here, on his return, what kind of effect the perusal of his letter had upon her; and nothing, surely, can be more beautiful, nor more interesting, than the description he gives of that fine struggle between patience and sorrow, which she manifested upon this occasion; with the delicacy and

<Q><SP>

<L>Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, Sir, she took them, read them in my presence,</L>

<P>The adulation and hyperbolical flattery which princes are too generally <HI>abused</HI> by, is well exposed here:

<P>They flattered me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard, ere the black ones were there—To say ay, and

no, to every thing that I said—Ay and no too, was no good divi∣nity—When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found them, there I smelt them out. Go to, they are not men of their words—They told me I was every thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.</P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The great Canute took a method of reproving the sycophants of his court, who affected to treat him as a God, by standing on the beach till the sea surrounded him, notwithstanding his stern behest to the tide to arrest its course.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="8" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>A person, here, who has been witness to one of the Scenes of Lear's madness, makes this very na∣tural reflection:
<Q><L>A sight most pitiful, in the meanest wretch,</L>
<L>Past speaking of in a king.</L></Q></P>
<P>Strict philosophy, perhaps, may not admit of such a distinction in men, merely from the difference of outward circumstances alone; but the habits and opinions of the world will always operate both on our sentiments and feelings, on a comparison, to the full extent of the maxim here laid down.</P>
<P>Besides, indeed, without having the least manner of respect to persons, that superior degree of cala∣mity which can be capable of piercing through the stronger shields of station, opulence and power, be∣fore it can inflict its arrows upon princes, must, doubtless, render them still greater objects of com∣miseration, than those whose condition in life may be supposed to lye more open to the ordinary assails of misfortune. See my remark upon the last Scene of the former Act.</P>
<P>Gloster seems to have the same sense of things, when in the following Scene he expresses a surprize, that because Lear is disordered in his senses, he should still be able to retain his own: though, indeed, he makes but a sad deduction from the reflection.</P>
<Q><PB N="370" REF="376"/>
<L>The king is mad; how stiff is my vile sense,</L>
<L>That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling</L>

<P>When Edgar, by killing of Goneril's steward, gets possession of the dispatches he was carrying to the enemy, he takes a resolution to open them; which he prefaces thus:
<Q><L>By your leave, gentle wax and manners—Blame us not—</L>
<L>To know our enemies minds we rip their hearts—</L>
<L>Their papers are more lawful.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, however certain <HI>reasons of State</HI> may possibly render such an action necessary, there is something in it, notwithstanding, at which the liberal and in∣genuous mind naturally revolts.
<Q>Beyond the fixed and settled rules, &amp;c.</Q>
The comparison he makes, indeed, is certainly strong, in favour of the lesser evil, regarding merely the simple position of the question; but then he should have restrained himself to the saying the latter was more <HI>reasonable</HI> or <HI>humane,</HI> than have pronounced it to be more <HI>law∣ful</HI> For it is this very circumstance, the <HI>legality</HI> of the former Act, which marks the difference between them; and which, though severe, yet being founded on the maxims of the <HI>Civil-Law,</HI> that

appears to be more justifiable, in the constitution of things, than even a milder act, which has no such principle to support it; nay, which rather militates, as in this case it apparently does, against that very maxim; by obtaining a surrepti∣tious proof of guilt, <HI>without confession</HI>; besides the compassing it, by an ungenerous baseness.</P>

<P>When Lear and Cordelia are brought in prisoners, the latter asks if they may not be permitted to a conference with <HI>these daughters and these sisters,</HI> in hopes of working on their compassion to set them free—To which Lear answers, with that mixture of extravagance and sound sense which so obviously run through the whole of his delirium,
<Q><L>No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison;</L>

<P>In the above speech, besides the wildness of the first part, which is, however, extremely affecting, for passion moves us more than reason, there is, here, as in all this poor king's rhapsodies, as hinted be∣fore, <HI>a document in madness,</HI> which excellently de∣scribes the character of the old <HI>Quid Nunc's,</HI> so well ridiculed in the Spectator; indeed of the Coffee∣house Politicians of all times; and which well re∣bukes the idle presumption of those vain ignorants, who pretend to canvass the mysteries of state, and investigate the arcana of government, as if they were of a superior order of intelligence, without any knowledge in the science of civil polity, or the least capacity for the arts of empire.</P>

<P>The difference of natures, between Albany, a man of virtue, and consequently of a compassionate disposition, and Edmund, a vicious person, and, of course, of blunted feelings, is well marked in the above dialogue. The latter would have the sad story continued, but the former intreated to hear no more of it.

<Q><L>This judgment of the Heavens that makes us tremble,</L>

<P>Here a hasty Reader might be apt to think, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the good Duke had forfeited his character for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>manity, a little, in this instance; but there is something inimitably just and fine in the passage. We certainly feel ourselves differently affected to∣wards the wretched in the common lot of life, and

those who seem to be distinguished as the more im∣mediate objects of divine chastisement. Our minds, in the latter case, become impressed with a sort of pious awe, which restrains our compassion, lest the too free indulgence of it might seem to arraign the justice of Providence.</P>
<P>This is a trait of human nature, so very little obvious to common capacities, that though all must have been sensible of the feeling, so few have had penetration enough to investigate the cause, that I dare say many have been ashamed to confess it, as imputing it to a deficiency of tenderness in their own hearts.</P>

<P>This remark is extremely just; that the flattery which parasites or needy clients are apt indiscrimi∣nately to squander upon their patrons, lessens the value of praise to the deserving few. We will admit a lover to compliment his mistress beyond her merits, because he may be supposed, from the blindness of his passion, not to intend any exagge∣ration; as has been already taken notice of, on a passage in the preceding Play <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lear, Act I. Scene II. The last remark on Cordelia's answer.</NOTE>.

</SP></Q>
<P>The first speech, in the above dialogue, well de∣scribes the general and truly moral satire, and pro∣perly distinguishes it from the bastard, or invidious kind of personal invective, stiled the libel or lam∣poon:
<Q><L>My free drift</L>
<L>Halts not <HI>particularly,</HI> &amp;c."</L></Q></P>

<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Timon, upon hearing of his friend Ventidius being thrown into a gaol, says to the messenger,
<Q><L>Commend me to him, I will send his ransom;</L>
<L>And being enfranchised bid him come to me.</L>
<L><HI>'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But to support him after.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The last lines contain a noble sentiment of friend∣ship, charity, and generosity—It has merit enough in itself, to stand alone; but would have double the effect on an hearer, if pronounced by a person of a more prudent and provident character.</P>
<P>This thought is beautifully expressed, in an old Elegy written on the good bishop Boulter, who died Primate of Ireland, some years ago:
<Q><L>—He thought it mean,</L>
<L>Only to help the poor to beg again.</L></Q></P>
<P>Timon says, soon after, in the same dialogue,
<Q><L>This gentleman of mine hath served me long,</L>
<L>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</L>
<L><HI>For 'tis a bond in men.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And again, in Scene V. (for I chuse to collect like sentiments under the same head) he says to
<PB N="382" REF="387"/>
Ventidius, who comes to thank him for his friend∣ship, and to repay the debt,
<Q><L>You mistake my love;</L>
<L>I gave it freely, ever; <HI>and there's none</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can truly say he gives, if he receives.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But to return to our former Scene—When Timon asks the old Athenian whether his daughter likes the young man that courts her, he replies,
<Q><L>She is young and apt—</L>
<L>Our own precedent passions do instruct us,</L>
<L>What levity's in youth.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is a sensible and philosophic reflection, and should be more attended to, than it generally is: for there are no persons fit to educate, to guide, or instruct young people, but those who have not for∣gotten their own youth. Parents and grand-parents are apt, too often, to require their children and grand-children should benefit of their earned know∣ledge and long experience, and so go on from thence, improving still in sense and virtue. It would be a happy thing, indeed, if we could put morals on the foot of science, which is thus progressive; but they must be very ignorant of human nature, who expect it.</P>
<P>"Old folks," as an ingenious modern author expresses it,
<Q>would have young ones as <HI>wise</HI> as themselves; without considering that they must be <HI>fools,</HI> if they were so <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Friends, or Original Letters, Vol. II. Letter LXXIX.</NOTE>.</Q>
Meaning, for he does not stay to explain himself, that they must be per∣sons of dull, phlegmatic natures, without passions, without sensibility, and consequently incapable of improvement or virtue.</P>
<P>Whenever I have happened to observe what are called <HI>the virtues of age</HI> to be innate in youth, I have naturally expected to meet with the vices of it there also; and have but rarely found any one of such character uninfected with selfishness or avarice.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="388"/>When Timon receives a portrait from the Painter, he makes a satirical reflection upon it, which, tho' too just in itself, seems to be a good deal out of character in him, at that time; as being previous to the experience which soon after might have instructed him to have made it.</P>
<Q><L>The painting is almost the natural man;</L>
<L>For since dishonour trafficks with man's nature,</L>
<L>He is but outside; penciled figures are</L>
<L>Even such as they give out.</L></Q>

<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>Apemantus, on seeing and hearing much embrac∣ing and professing between Timon and Alcibiades, mutters thus to himself:
<Q>That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves, and all this courtesy! The strain of man is bred out into baboon and monkey.</Q></P>
<P>Sterne said of French politeness, that <HI>it might be compared to a smooth coin; it had lost all mark of cha∣racter.</HI> To which I think we may add, that cour∣tesy, like counters, by having attained a currency in the world, have come at length to bear an equal rate, we might say, a superior one, with pieces of intrinsic value; so that one who should make a difference between them in the <HI>modern</HI> traffic of life, would be looked upon as a mere <HI>virtuoso,</HI> who preferred an <HI>Otho</HI> to a <HI>Georgius.</HI></P>
<P>We must take up with the world, at present, as we do with the stage, to which it has so often been compared. There is <HI>a fable</HI> in both; and if the actors but perform their <HI>personated characters</HI> well, we are not to quarrel with them for not exhibiting their <HI>natural ones.</HI></P>

Why, I have oft wished myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits. And what better or properer can we call our own, than the riches of our friends?

<L>They answer in a joint and corporate voice,</L>
<L>That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot</L>

<L>But yet they could have wished—They know not—</L>

<P>To which Timon replies, with a competent know∣ledge of human nature; for he seems to be inspired here, as before <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the last passage of Scene II. of the former Act, with the remark upon it.</NOTE>:
<Q><L>These old fellows</L>

<L>And nature, as it grows again tow'rd earth,</L>

<P>After having thrown out this stricture against Age and Avarice, he desires his steward to apply to Ven∣tidius, a young man lately come into the possession of a large fortune, whom he had just redeemed from the miseries of a gaol, and restrains him only to borrow from him the exact sum he had before paid for his release, saying,
<Q><L>Ne'er speak or think,</L>

<P>When Ventidius has declined to lend his assistance, (though this circumstance is only hinted at, but not produced upon the scene) Timon dispatches the steward <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the text, this person's name is <HI>Flaminius,</HI> but I have not here distinguished him from <HI>Flavius,</HI> to avoid a confusion of persons under the same character of steward.</NOTE> to Lucullus, another young man of promis∣ing hopes; who answers in the same strain with the evasive and sarcastical reply given before by the Sena∣tors, as related in the Fifth Scene of the preceding Act; pleading incapacity, and reprehending the too profuse liberality of Timon. After which he forces some pieces into Flavius's hand, by way of bribing him to pretend to his master, that he had not met with him; and then goes off. Upon which the honest and indignant steward, flinging away the money, cries out,
<Q><L>May these add to the number that may scald thee!</L>
<L>Let molten coin be thy damnation,</L>
<L>Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!</L>
<L>Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,</L>

<L>To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!</L></Q></P>
<P>The generous and feeling mind must naturally sympathize with the warmth of resentment, here expressed, though its moral and charity may refrain it from concurring in the anathemas of it.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this scene, till I have remarked upon the character of Ventidius, as represented by two seeming contradictory circumstances, in the first and second Acts.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="393"/>In the former he shews his honesty and gratitude to his benefactor, by offering to repay the money which had been given to redeem his liberty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scene V. of the Play; but only hinted at here, in one of the excursions from Scene II. by way of introducing Timon's fine reply to the offer.</NOTE>; and here he betrays the very reverse of these principles. Is Shakespeare inconsistent? No. 'Tis nature still. Ventidius had just then succeeded to an ample patri∣mony. A sudden afflux of fortune, especially to a person newly emerging from distress, is apt to swell and enlarge the heart at first; but then in mean minds it is as apt to shrink and contract it as suddenly again.</P>

<Q>What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man! There was very little honour shewn in that. For my own part, I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet had he not mistook him, and sent to me <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The sense is corrected here by Doctor Johnson's alteration of the text in a note.</NOTE>, I should ne'er have denied his occasions so many talents.</Q>
But immediately after, in the same scene, upon application made to himself by Servilius, to the same purpose, he thus defends his purse:
<Q>What a wicked <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wicked</HI> for <HI>unlucky.</HI></NOTE> beast was I, <HI>(speaking to the messenger)</HI> to dis∣furnish myself against so good a time, when I might have shewn myself honourable?

Servilius, now, before the gods, I am not able to do—The
<PB N="389" REF="394"/>
more beast, I say—I was sending to use lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done it now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, be∣cause I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use my own words to him?</Q>
Then turning to the first stranger, he says, what is too generally experienced through life,
<Q><L>True, as you said, Timon is shrunk, indeed;</L>
<L>And he that's once denied will hardly speed.</L></Q></P>

<P>Sempronius, another of Timon's <HI>friends,</HI> is here assailed, who evades the request by pleading surprize that he should be the first person applied to on such an exigence, before Lucius, Lucullus, and Venti∣dius, who had each of them so much higher obliga∣tions to his services than himself. But being beaten out of that argument, by being informed of their all having been before <HI>touched, and found base metal,</HI> as the messenger tells him, he then makes use of a device, not uncommon in such cases, to pretend a quarrel, or affect a jealousy with a person, in order to have one's resentment pass as an excuse for re∣fusing the favour required.</P>

<L>And does he think so backwardly of me,</L>

<P>There are so many unfavourable pictures of the world already given by Shakespeare, that though each of them may be very proper, in its respective place, to adorn the fable, and maintain the charac∣ters in the several Dramas; yet some of them, it may be thought, might be spared in a work of this ge∣neral

kind, which requires not such minute atten∣tions: but as my scope here is not only to instruct the ignorant, to warn the unwary, and inculcate the moral of our author, both from his precepts and examples, but to do him honour also as a writer, I think it would be a sort of injustice in me to suffer any passage in him to remain unnoted, which, besides conducing to such great ends, may serve to shew the fecundity of his powers and genius, which has ena∣bled him to treat the same subject in so many dif∣ferent ways, with still new thoughts, and varied expression.</P>
<P>The following speech is a beautiful instance of this observation.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Timon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Twinned brothers of one womb,</L>

<P>IT has been much disputed among the Commen∣tators, whether this Play be originally Shake∣speare's, or only the work of some elder Author, revised and improved for representation by him: though, if I might be allowed to venture a criti∣cism upon this subject, I should suppose the intire Piece to be his, and for a very singular reason; Be∣cause the whole of the fable, as well as the conduct of it, is so very <HI>barbarous,</HI> in every sense of the word, that I think, however he might have been tempted to make use of the legend, in some hurry or other, for his own purpose, he could hardly have adopted it from any other person's composition. We are quick-sighted to the faults of others, though purblind to our own. Besides, he would never have strewed such sweet flowers upon a <HI>caput mortuum,</HI> if some child of his had not lain entombed un∣derneath. Many of the beauties I hint at, being merely poetical imagery, without any mixture of moral in them, are therefore not inserted among the following notes, as not being the proper object of my remarks, which must, in consequence, appear to fall short of the above compliment.</P>
<P>The arguments, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> for the authenticity of this Play, are not material to our present pur∣pose; for as we find it among the muster-roll of our Author's forces, it challenges a right to pass in review along with the rest, though there are but very few passages in it to answer the design of this work.</P>
<P>I should imagine, from the many shocking spec∣tacles exhibited in this Play, that it could never have been represented on any theatre, except the
<PB N="404" REF="408"/>
Lisbon scaffold, where the duke d'Aveiro, the Mar∣quis of Tavora, <HI>cum suis,</HI> were so barbarously mas∣sacred, for the supposed Jesuits' plot against the present king of Portugal. And yet Ben Johnson assures us that it was performed, in his time, <HI>with great applause</HI>; and we are also told that it was re∣vived again, in the reign of Charles the Second, <HI>with the same success.</HI> The different humours and tastes of times!

<P>Tamora, queen of the Goths, and a captive, pleading here to Titus Andronicus for her son's life, who was going to be offered up as a victim of war, speaks in Shakespeare's usual stile, as remarked before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Timon, Act III, Scene VI, the first remark.</NOTE>, on the great article of mercy.</P>

<P>There is something so soothing to the mind, in a description of the sequestered Scene, free from the tumult, the vices, and the violences of the world, that it naturally pleases us, even though the grave itself be made the subject of it.</P>

<P>Marcus Andronicus, endeavouring to repress his brother Titus's excess of grief, who was labouring under the most unheard of cruelties and misery, both in himself and his children, addresses him thus:
<Q><L>Oh! brother, speak with possibilities,</L>

</SP></Q></P>
<P>Titus, in this speech, says a great deal to excuse the shews and expressions of grief, though in too
<PB N="406" REF="410"/>
poetical a stile, rather, for so sad a subject; but I think the first argument of it a very strong one, upon this occasion—
<Q>If there were reason for these miseries, &amp;c.</Q>
For we certainly suffer those misfortunes, which happen to our lot in the common course of nature or of justice, with much more resignation of mind, than we can do those which are inflicted on us by the violences of tyranny, cruelty, or malice—Here our detestation and abhorrence of the agent, serves to heighten our resentment of the injury.</P>
<P>In the two last lines above, Shakespeare has given an elevation to the common expression of <HI>losers have leave to speak.</HI> There are instances of the same kind, in our Author, before taken notice of. This is one of his characteristics; and, indeed, I think that his stile and manner are so strongly marked, through∣out this Play, (take the above speech, for one in∣stance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of it, for I have transcribed it short.</NOTE>) that I own it surprizes me Doctor Johnson should say,
<Q>he did not think Shakespeare's touches discernible in it.</Q></P>
<P>In the same Scene, when some shocking objects of his wretchedness are presented to the view of Titus, he makes a very natural reflection upon them, for a person in such unhappy circumstances.</P>
<Q><L>Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,</L>
<L>And yet detested life not shrink thereat!</L>
<L>That ever death should let life bear his name,</L>
<L>Where life hath no more interest than to breathe!</L></Q>
<P>In the extremities of anguish, either of mind or body, we are apt to be surprised at that toughness in our frame, which prevents its dissolution; and are often tempted to wish our miseries might of themselves have sufficient force to bring us that re∣lief, which our virtue or religion forbids us to supply ourselves.</P>

<P>Lady Macbeth, speaking here of Duncan's grooms, says,
<Q><L>That which hath made them drunk, hath made me bold;</L>
<L>What hath quenched them, hath given me fire.</L></Q></P>
<P>Our sex is obliged to Shakespeare, for this passage. He seems to think that a woman could not be rendered compleatly wicked, without some degree of in∣toxication.
<PB N="413" REF="417"/>
It required two vices in her; one to intend, and another to perpetrate the crime. He does not give <HI>wine and wassail</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wassail.</HI> An antient beverage of ale, apples, and honey mixed.</NOTE> to Macbeth; leaving him in his natural state, to be actuated by the temptation of ambition alone.</P>
<P>Macbeth, after he had committed the murder, speaking of the Grooms, who lay in the ante∣chamber he had just passed through, says,
<Q><L>One cried, <HI>God bless us!</HI> and <HI>Amen!</HI> the other;</L>
<L>As they had seen me with these hang-man's hands,</L>
<L>List'ning their fear—I could not say <HI>Amen,</HI></L>
<L>When they did say <HI>God bless us.</HI> . . . . . .</L>
<L>But wherefore could I not pronounce <HI>Amen?</HI></L>
<L>I had most need of blessing, yet <HI>Amen</HI></L>
<L>Stuck in my throat.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is natural—One of the most horrid circum∣stances of guilt, is that total suppression a wicked person is apt to labour under, for a time, of the ability to pray. I should think that, from this very extraordinary circumstance, Divines might deduce a good argument to strengthen the Christian system of theology. If, as the advocates for Natural Religion say, our vices proceed from the violence of our passions merely, contrition, upon their scheme, might immediately succeed the gratification of our pur∣pose; but, as we are taught that temptation arises from the instigation of an evil spirit, the fiend has still a further interest in the postponing of our re∣pentance. Suicide must certainly be a strong instance of this latter doctrine; as it prompts us, even con∣trary to the intent of nature, and the general scope, both of our affections, impressions, and feelings, to the destruction of our own existence.</P>

<L>That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">For telling an <HI>old story.</HI></NOTE>;</L>
<L>Each minute teems a new one.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>In the same dialogue, when Rosse has given Mac∣duff an account of the murder of his wife and chil∣dren, at which he seems to stand petrified with sor∣row, Malcolm justly warns him of the dangerous
<PB N="422" REF="426"/>
consequences of restraining the natural shews and expressions of grief.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Malcolm.</SPEAKER>
<L>Merciful Heaven!</L>
<L>What, man! Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows—</L>
<L>Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak,</L>
<L>Whispers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it break. . . .</L>
<L>Dispute it like a man.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>To which Macduff as justly replies, without any disgrace to philosophy or religion:
<Q><L>I shall do so;</L>
<L><HI>But I must feel it as a man.</HI></L>
<L>I cannot but remember such things were,</L>
<L>That were most precious to me.</L></Q></P>
<P>But he then proceeds to a reflection, which, though natural and common for the unhappy to make, in such circumstances, offends against both the princi∣ples above-mentioned, philosophy and religion, as being at once impious and unjust:
<Q><L>Did Heaven look on,</L>
<L>And would not take their part?</L></Q></P>
<P>Lear, on seeing Cordelia dead, makes an expostu∣lation of the same sort:
<Q><L>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,</L>
<L>And thou no breath at all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the last Scene of the Play.</NOTE>?</L></Q></P>
<P>But all this arises from a too presumptuous and over-weening notion of our own consequence in the creation. The pride of man prompts each to con∣sider himself as the principal object of Providence; and we would all of us wrest the stated order of Nature, to serve our own purposes. But the true philosophy of the matter is, as Pope very justly ex∣presses it, in different parts of his Essay on Man,
<Q><L>The Universal Cause</L>
<L>Acts not by <HI>partial,</HI> but by <HI>general</HI> laws. . . . .</L>
<L>And sees with equal eye, as Lord of all,</L>

<P>The effects of a guilty and disturbed mind are extremely well represented here, in the person of Lady Macbeth, by the words and actions with which she betrays her crime, while she is walking in her sleep. "A great perturbation in Nature," as her Doctor says,
<Q>to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor, upon discovering the cause of her malady, very justly declares her to be no fit patient for his art, and turns her over, accordingly, to Hea∣ven and her confessors for a cure, saying,
<Q><L>Unnatural deeds</L>
<L>Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>As I cannot bear the thought of suffering the last gloomy passage cited in the foregoing remarks, to dwell upon my Reader's mind, which, by tempting him to repine at the ways of Providence, might give him cause to lament his having ever been sent into such a <HI>world of woe,</HI> I shall endeavour to argue, as far as I am able, against such representations of life as our author frequently gives us of our condi∣tion in it, and in which he is too generally seconded by many of the more professed writers on Mo∣rality.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="430"/>These philosophers are apt to speak too severely, upon the sum of human life; but only seem to condemn it from distinct parts, and particular in∣stances, which vice, folly, passions, casualty, or in∣temperance, too often furnish for observation. But I shall here venture to treat this subject more im∣partially, by considering it upon the whole, and according to the general state or condition in which the great Author of Nature has most benevolently supplied it to us.</P>
<P>We are created with five perfect senses, and the world is stored with variety of objects to afford plea∣sures to them all; and these we are naturally framed to retain the possession of, even to the full term of life prescribed by the Psalmist, of <HI>threescore years and ten</HI>; till that period of time, when we may ourselves become weary of a longer continuance here, not from the <HI>disgust</HI> of our disappointments, but merely from the <HI>satiety</HI> of our enjoyments. And though our strength may then, or even before, become weak∣ness, it may not, however, be encumbered either with decrepitude or pain: and even to the last we may be still capable of using as much exercise, as age re∣quires; or if any accidental ail should render more necessary, an horse may restore the full benefit, at least, though perhaps not the use, of our limbs.</P>
<P>Let us add to these, the pleasures of hope, imagi∣nation, reflection, reading, science, conversation, love, friendship,
<Q><L>Relations dear, and all the charities</L>
<L>Of father, son, and brother.</L></Q>
Even our most moderate satisfactions and enjoyments, though their impressions may not be so sensibly felt, during their continuance, yet if their <HI>moment</HI> be cal∣culated, by multiplying the degree into the duration, we shall find the amount to exceed the quantity of more poignant but shorter sensations.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="431"/>Let us also take into our account the vicissitude and variety of seasons, with the alternation of day and night;
<Q><L>Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,</L>
<L>With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun,</L>
<L>When first on this delightful land he spreads</L>
<L>His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</L>
<L>Glitt'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth</L>
<L>After soft show'rs; and sweet the coming on</L>
<L>Of grateful evening mild; then silent night</L>

<L>And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus are described the delights of Eden, by a Poet so enamoured of the beauties of Nature, that he has certainly exerted his utmost powers to enhance her charms; and yet even Milton's imagination was not able to transcend the reality of those objects and enjoyments, which our common fields and gardens afford us every day.</P>
<P>This is the common life of man; this the condi∣tion of the yeoman, the husbandman, the labourer, the artist, the mechanic, the servant—the <HI>many</HI> of mankind. And where sickness, pain, loss of any sense or limb, happens to the lot of individuals, this is not according to the <HI>course</HI> of Nature, but rather a <HI>violence</HI> against it. And these accidents afflict not the <HI>many,</HI> but the <HI>few</HI>; nor is Provi∣dence any more answerable for the <HI>natural,</HI> than for the <HI>moral,</HI> ills of life: one is but incidental to the general constitution and necessity of things, and the other to the appetites and free-will of man.</P>
<P>But sloth, luxury, ambition, vicious passions, envy, hatred, and malice, may render some diseased in body, and others discontented in mind. This is not, however, the <HI>condition</HI> of their nature, but the <HI>corruption</HI> of it; and these are still not the <HI>many,</HI> but the <HI>few</HI>; not the <HI>body</HI> of the people, but the <HI>excre∣scences</HI> which arise out of it, and must be nourished at its cost—namely, the great, the opulent, and the proud.</P>

<P>If what I have here said, upon this comparative view of human nature, were not true, Providence must have shewn a manifest partiality to the inferior creation, which is certainly placed in an happier state than man, according to some—to many writers. But Plato speaks upon this subject with a much better philosophy than any of these moral sophisters, when he says, that
<Q>God is good, for he bestows all that is good upon all creatures, <HI>according to their several capacities.</HI> Each is as happy as it can be; or, <HI>as its nature permits</HI>; and if any thinks the several creatures could have been happier, it is because he does not understand their natures.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Who sees not Providence all good and wise,</L>
<L>Alike in what it gives, and what denies?</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>It may not be improper to quote a passage here, out of a letter from Mr. Pope to Doctor Swift, upon the subject of his <HI>Essay on Man.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I am just now (says he) writing, or rather plan∣ning, a book, to bring mankind to look upon this life with comfort and pleasure, <HI>and put morality in good humour with itself.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the true philosophy of sense and virtue. Gloomy minds are deficient in both.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are accounted poor citizens, the Patricians good. What authority surfeits on, would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity, while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not worth the charge of maintaining.</NOTE>. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an in∣ventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our <HI>pikes,</HI> ere we become <HI>rakes</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This miserable clinch is not worth the trouble of correcting or explaining.</NOTE>; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>The nature and reasoning of all mutinous cabal∣lers are fully shewn in the above short scene. The common people are apt to impute all national griev∣ances or calamities to the fault of their rulers, tho' ever so unavoidable from the nature of things, failure of seasons, or other incidental misfortunes whatso∣ever. If freedom of speech and the liberty of the press were not restrained in Turkey, I make no
<PB N="432" REF="436"/>
doubt but a Mussulman populace would charge the plague to the account of their Sultans or their Viziers.</P>
<P>In the same scene, that abatement of esteem and praise, which is the natural consequence of persons appearing to over-rate their own merits, more espe∣cially when this is betrayed by shewing pride or contempt to others, is very justly remarked on.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Against him first. He's a very dog to the commonalty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; and could be content to give him good report for't; but that <HI>he pays himself with being proud.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say unto you what he hath done famously, he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it <HI>to please his mother,</HI> and to be partly proud; which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>The above expression, of <HI>to please his mother,</HI> is taken verbatim from Plutarch, who, in the Life of Coriolanus, says of him,<Q>The end which others proposed in their acts of valour, was glory; but he pursued glory, <HI>because the acquisition of it delighted his mother.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Though this seems to be a childish reason, yet 'tis very well to be accounted for. His father died when Caius Marcius was but an infant; the care of his education then devolved upon the mother, who gave him his first lessons of bravery and honour, and took pains to inspire his youth with that martial spirit which she thought became a Roman and a Patri∣cian. It was natural, then, that his exploits should still bear a reference to the person under whose tu∣telage he had been trained to arms.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Here Menenius Agrippa expostulates with the unruly populace, in a manner conformable to my first remark on the preceding Scene.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Menenius.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neigh∣bours,</L>
<L>Will you undo yourselves?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot, Sir; we are undone already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Menenius.</SPEAKER>
<L>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</L>
<L>Have the Patricians of you. For your wants,</L>
<L>Your sufferings in this dearth, you may as well</L>
<L>Strike at the heavens with your staves, as lift them</L>
<L>Against the Roman state; whose course will on</L>
<L>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</L>
<L>Of more strong links asunder, than can ever</L>
<L>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</L>
<L>The gods, not the Patricians, make it; and</L>
<L>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</L>
<L>You are transported by calamity</L>
<L>Thither where more attends you; and you slander</L>
<L>The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,</L>
<L>When you curse them as enemies.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>But this argument not quieting the tumult, he proceeds to give them the famous apologue of <HI>The Belly and Members,</HI> borrowed from Aesop; which though already so generally known that it need not be related, yet as the Reader may chuse to see the story in Shakespeare's stile and manner of telling it, I shall supply the fable here, leaving out the several breaks and interruptions of the dialogue in which 'tis recited.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Menenius.</SPEAKER>
<L>Either you must</L>
<L>Confess yourselves wond'rous malicious,</L>
<L>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</L>
<L>A pretty tale, it may be you have heard it;</L>

<L>Not rash, like his accusers; and thus answered—</L>

<L>That I receive the general food at first,</L>
<L>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</L>
<L>Because I am the store-house, and the shop</L>

<L>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>He then gives them the exposition of the allegory, in the following words:
<Q><L>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</L>
<L>And you the mutinous members; for examine</L>
<L>Their counsels, and their cares, digest things rightly,</L>

<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>Here Coriolanus, in a stile of austerity and haugh∣tiness, which he preserves through the whole of his spirited but harsh character, rates the malecontent citizens, in a speech which truly describes the nature of every populace in all free states.</P>
<Q><L>He that will give good words to thee, will flatter</L>
<L>Beneath abhorring. What would ye have, ye curs,</L>

<L>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,</L>
<L>And curse that justice did it <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This passage surely needed an explanation to all but the quick conceptions of the Commentators, who have therefore neglected it. The meaning I take to be this: <HI>You would chant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut hymns of triumph to the conqueror who should enslave, while you'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in arms against the laws that would restrain you.</HI></NOTE>.

<L>You cry against the noble senate, who,</L>
<L>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</L>

<P>And afterwards, speaking of them to Menenius, he adds,
<Q><L>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know</L>

<HEAD>SCENE VI.</HEAD>
<P>This place affords us a description of the cha∣racteristic <HI>Roman Matron</HI> of those times, set in con∣trast with the <HI>Woman of Nature.</HI></P>
<Q><STAGE>Volumnia, <HI>the Mother, and</HI> Virgilia, <HI>the Wife of</HI> Coriolanus, <HI>after he had marched against the</HI> Volscians.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volumnia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I would freelier rejoice in that absence, wherein he won honour, than in the embracements of his bed, where he would shew most love. When yet he was but tender bodied, and the only son of my hope; when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze that way; when, for a day of a king's entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honour would be∣come such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleased to see him seek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anger, where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wreath,</HI> given as a mark of distinction to those who had saved the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of a citizen in battle.</NOTE>. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child, than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Virgilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But had he died in the business, madam, how then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Volumnia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely. Had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</P>
</SP></Q>
<P>There appears to be a vast difference here between the sentiments of these two matrons; but this may well be accounted for from the difference of their situations and circumstances of life. Volumnia, hav∣ing been left a widow, in the infancy of her son, and taking upon herself the charge of his educa∣tion, had, it may be supposed, soon silenced the ten∣derness of a mother in her breast, and assumed the spirit of a father, to fulfil her trust; and by con∣stantly endeavouring to inspire her pupil with the chief virtues of a Roman, magnanimity, and love of his country, she may be said in a manner to have educated herself at the same time to bravery, forti∣tude, and contempt of death.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="9" TYPE="scene">
<PB N="437" REF="441"/>
<HEAD>SCENE IX.</HEAD>
<P>The true character of a soldier is well described, in this Scene. When Coriolanus, in the heat of battle, and covered with blood, demands a fresh supply of troops from Cominius, the General an∣swers,
<Q><L>Take your choice of those</L>
<L>That best can aid your action.</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coriolanus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Those are they</L>
<L>That are most willing. If any such be here,</L>
<L>As it were sin to doubt, that love this painting,</L>
<L>Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear <STAGE>pointing to his bloody front.</STAGE></L>
<L>Less for his person than an ill report;</L>
<L>If any think brave death outweighs bad life,</L>
<L>And that his country's dearer than himself,</L>
<L>Let him alone, or, many, if so minded,</L>
<L>Wave thus t' express his disposition, <STAGE>Waving his hand.</STAGE></L>
<L>And follow Marcius.</L>

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="act">
<HEAD>ACT II.</HEAD>
<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>That warmth of affection with which Menenius greets good news from his friend, must charm the sensible Reader. On hearing that Coriolanus had defeated the Volscians, and written a letter to him on that occasion, he cries out in transport,
<Q>Take my cap <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning I'll throw up my <HI>cap</HI> to the skies for joy. Doctor Warburton changes the word to <HI>cup,</HI> as designing a <HI>libation</HI> of thanks—I think unnecessarily.</NOTE>, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo! Marcius coming home! I will make my house reel to-night. . . . . . A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scorn the aid of physic.</NOTE>; the most so∣vereign prescription in Galen is but empiric; and, to this preser∣vative, of no better report <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Of no more value or estimation.</NOTE> than a horse-drench.</Q></P>
<P>And again, in the next Scene, upon meeting him, he expresses the fulness of his heart, which exceeds even to pain, in very strong and apt terms:
<Q><L><HI>A hundred thousand welcomes</HI>—I could weep,</L>
<L>And I could laugh; I'm light and heavy—<HI>Welcome!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="442"/>These speeches have a double beauty in them, if 'tis considered by whom they are delivered. It would not have near the effect upon the Reader, if spoken by a more stayed and sober person; for virtues are apt to strike us more forcibly in slight characters, than in solid ones; and Menenius has already given us a description of himself, in the preceding Scene, which sufficiently justifies me in this distinction:
<Q>I am known to be a humorous Patrician, and one that loves a cup of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wine, without a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to be some∣thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g imperfect, in savouring the first complaint <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Apt too quickly to follow the suggestions of my appetite.</NOTE>; hasty and tin∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-like, upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> buttock of the night, than with the forehead of the morning.

</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P>As I have quoted several descriptions of character, before, in the course of this work, for the reason already given in its proper place, as being within the prescription of moral; and besides that those were merely imaginary, though truly copied from real life, I think that this one of Coriolanus, being sufficiently vouched from authentic story <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, Livy, &amp;c.</NOTE>, ought, therefore, to be more particularly remarked upon in these notes.</P>
<P>In the first Scene of the former Act, in a passage above quoted, second remark, one of the discon∣tented citizens charges him with paying himself for his services, <HI>with being proud</HI>; and his reproach was just. But yet here he seems to appear in a light the very reverse of such a character; for when the he∣rald, in the voice of Rome, is proclaiming his merits, he stops him short, by crying out,
<Q><L>No more of this; it does offend my heart.</L>
<L>Pray now, no more.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="443"/>He manifests the same modesty also, in the Sixth Scene following. When he appears to be uneasy in his seat, upon the applause given him for his prowess, one of the senators says to him,
<Q><L>Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear</L>
<L>What you have nobly done.</L></Q>
To which he replies,
<Q><L>Your honour's pardon—</L>
<L>I'd rather have my wounds to heal again,</L>
<L>Than hear say how I got them.</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brutus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, I hope,</L>
<L>My words disbenched you not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to a speech of his in this S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene, not quoted here, where he charges Coriolanus with his contempt of the people.</NOTE>.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coriolanus.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, Sir; yet oft,</L>
<L>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words—</L>
<L><HI>You soothe not, therefore hurt not</HI>; but your people,</L>
<L>I love them as they weigh.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Menenius.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray now, sit down.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coriolanus.</SPEAKER>
<L>I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun,</L>
<L>When the alarum were struck, than idly sit,</L>

<L>You see, <STAGE>To the people.</STAGE></L>
<L>He had rather venture all his limbs, for honour,</L>
<L>Than one of 's ears, to hear it.</L>

<P>Afterwards, Cominius speaking of him, says,
<Q><L>Our spoils he kicked at,</L>
<L>And looked upon things precious, as they were</L>

<P>Again, when he is pressed to harangue the peo∣ple, in order to get himself elected Consul, he answers in the same stile and spirit of character,

<L>To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus—</L>

</SP></Q></P>
<P>But these seeming contradictions form, in effect, but one character still. The over-valuing his merits, and the under-valuing the applause of them, are both equally founded in pride, fierce∣ness, and impatience. Plutarch draws a com∣parison of Coriolanus with Alcibiades; but I think he more resembles Achilles, as described by Horace:
<Q>Vigilant, irascible, inflexible, harsh, and above all laws; acknowledging no rights, but those of conquest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer,</L>
<L>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra neget fibi nata, nihil non arroge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> armis.</L></Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Let us now return to the third Scene, again, from whence the pursuit of our subject had tempted us to wander.</P>
<P>When Coriolanus comes home victorious from the Volscian war, his family and friends gather about him, complimenting and congratulating him on his bravery and success; all but Virgilia, his wife, whose heart being fuller of joy and fondness than them all put together, was therefore rendered in∣capable of uttering a syllable on that occasion— Upon which he salutes her thus:
<Q>My gracious silence, hail!</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Warburton gives the following note upon this passage:
<Q>The epithet joined to <HI>silence</HI> shews
<PB N="441" REF="445"/>
it not to proceed from sullenness or reserve, but to be the effect of a virtuous mind possessing it∣self in peace. The expression is extremely sub∣lime; and the sense of it conveys the finest praise that can be given to a woman.</Q></P>
<P>I perfectly agree with the Doctor in his opinion, both of the beauty of the expression, and the merit of the character implied in it. I have taken the liberty of leaving out the adjunct, <HI>good,</HI> joined to the last word, in his note, as being superfluous in that place; for no <HI>bad</HI> one can possibly deserve praise.</P>

<P>Coriolanus preserves still the same kind of in∣domitable sturdiness and severity, in the following speech; where he also takes occasion, very justly, to censure the superstitious reverence the world is too apt to bear towards customs which are not founded in reason.</P>
<P>When he has, with infinite difficulty, been pre∣vailed upon by his friends to solicit votes for the Consulate, and having obtained them, being left alone, he speaks thus to himself:
<Q><L>Most sweet voices—</L>
<L>Better it is to die, better to starve,</L>
<L>Than crave the hire, which first we do deserve.</L>
<L>Why in this woolvish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The candidates gown was made of rough undyed wool.</NOTE> gown should I stand here,</L>

<P>Menenius, when he is going to parley with Co∣riolanus, on the part of Rome, makes a speech which shews a perfect knowledge of human nature; for certainly a proper attention to times, seasons, and circumstances, goes a considerable way towards the success of our requests.</P>

<L><HI>As if a man were author of himself,</HI></L>

<P>Coriolanus has here carried his sternness, and the strained principles of stoical pride, whose throne is only <HI>in the mind,</HI> as far as they could go; and now great Nature, whose more sovereign seat of empire is <HI>in the heart,</HI> takes her turn to triumph; for upon the joint prayers, tears, and intreaties of his family, he becomes <HI>a man,</HI> at last▪ crying out—

<HEAD>JULIUS CAESAR.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Scene there is a notion delivered, which may be productive of good or bad effects, ac∣cording to the characters of the persons who em∣brace it. In rational and virtuous minds, it may inspire an active pursuit of fortune, in whatever profession or scene of life they are engaged in; but in weak or wicked natures, may betray to hazardous schemes, or tempt to vicious courses. The same principle has made generals and admirals of com∣mon soldiers and sailors; chancellors and bishops of attorneys' clerks and sizers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sizer,</HI> the lowest rank of students in an University.</NOTE>, on the one part; projectors, conspirators, usurpers, and assassins, on the other.</P>

<L>I do not know the man I should avoid,</L>

<SPEAKER>Cassius.</SPEAKER>
<L>So is he, now, in execution</L>
<L>Of any bold or noble enterprize,</L>
<L>However he puts on this tardy form.</L>
<L><HI>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which gives men stomach to digest his words</HI></L>

</SP></Q>
<P>The above is a sort of character we often meet with in life, and which has generally the effect here attributed to it.</P>
<P>In the same Scene there is a just and prudent maxim set forth, with regard to the persons and characters that men should associate themselves with, who would preserve either their understanding, their honour, or integrity.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Cassius.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</L>

<P>Some moral writer says,
<Q>That if men of sense, taste, or virtue, have not an opportunity of con∣versing with their equals, they had much better live alone.</Q>
They will certainly be able to pre∣serve these rare qualities much better in solitude, than in unequal society—There is a contagion in minds and manners, as well as in bodies, when corrupt.</P>

<Q><STAGE>Brutus, <HI>solus.</HI></STAGE>
<L>It must be by his death; and, for my part,</L>
<L>I have no personal cause to spurn at him:</L>
<L>But for the general—He would be crowned;</L>
<L>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</L>
<L>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,</L>
<L>And that craves wary walking—Crown him—that—</L>
<L>And then I grant we put a sting in him,</L>
<L>That at his will he may do danger with.</L>
<L>Th' abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</L>
<L>Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar,</L>
<L>I have not known when his affections swayed</L>
<L>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</L>
<L>That lowliness is young Ambition's ladder,</L>
<L>Whereto the climber upwards turns his face;</L>
<L>But when he once attains the utmost round,</L>
<L>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</L>
<L>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</L>
<L>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may—</L>
<L>Then, lest he may, prevent—And since the quarrel</L>
<L>Will bear no colour, for the thing he is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have no pretence for destroying him, from his present appearance of character.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</L>
<L>Would run to these and these extremities;</L>
<L>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg,</L>
<L>Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous;</L>
<L>And kill him in the shell.</L>
\</Q>
<P>In this soliloquy, or self-debate, upon the intended assassination of Caesar, the too common frailty of
<PB N="450" REF="454"/>
man in the circumstances of successful ambition, is strongly described, under two very just and poetical images; but the inference drawn from it in the conclusion, is certainly carried too far. It might, perhaps, have become an Heathen to prevent an ill, without respecting the means; but a Christian, thank God, is forbidden <HI>to do evil, even though good should come of it.</HI></P>
<P>In the continuance of this soliloquy, Brutus gives a strong description of the state of mind which precedes the execution of any great or hazardous purpose.</P>
<Q><L>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,</L>
<L>I have not slept.</L>
<L>Between the acting of a dreadful thing,</L>
<L>And the first motion, all the interim is</L>
<L>Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream;</L>
<L>The genius and the mortal instruments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He supposes a struggle between the good genius and the passions.</NOTE></L>
<L>Are then in council; and the state of man,</L>
<L>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</L>
<L>The nature of an insurrection.</L></Q>
<P>Mr. Addison, in his Cato, has a reflection of the same kind; but it would be illiberal to quote it here, after the strength of imagery and expression in this of Shakespeare's—Besides, indeed, as Doctor Warburton candidly allows,
<Q>There was a great difference between the two occasions</Q>
—Even as much, we may add, as there is between the two speeches.</P>

<DIV5 N="2" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>The needlessness of oaths to bind compacts be∣tween honest men, to which, indeed, might be added the insufficiency of them to bind knaves, is well urged in this place.</P>
<P>When the cautious Cassius proposes to the con∣spirators that they shall all enter into a solemn cove∣nant together, to sanctify their mutual engagements,
<PB N="451" REF="455"/>
the nobler Brutus opposes it, in the following words:
<Q><L>No, not an oath. If not the face of men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The face of men,</HI> either the dejected looks of the people, or their coun∣tenance and approbation of the measure.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>The sufferance of our souls, the times abuse,</L>
<L>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</L>
<L>And ev'ry man hence to his idle bed;</L>
<L>So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</L>
<L>'Till each man drop by lottery—But if these,</L>
<L>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</L>
<L>To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour</L>
<L>The melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,</L>
<L>What need we any spur, but our own cause,</L>
<L>To prick us to redress? What other bond,</L>
<L>Than secret Romans that have spoke the word,</L>
<L>And will not palter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To <HI>palter,</HI> to <HI>shift,</HI> or <HI>shuffle.</HI></NOTE>? And what other oath,</L>
<L>Than honesty to honesty engaged,</L>
<L>That this shall be, or we will fall for it?</L>
<L>Swear priests, and cowards, and men cautelous,</L>
<L>Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls</L>
<L>That welcome wrongs. Unto bad causes swear</L>
<L>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</L>
<L>The even virtue of our enterprize,</L>
<L>Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</L>
<L>To think that or our cause, or our performance,</L>
<L>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood,</L>
<L>That ev'ry Roman bears, and nobly bears,</L>
<L>Is guilty of a several bastardy,</L>
<L>If he doth break the smallest particle</L>
<L>Of any promise that hath past from him.</L></Q></P>
<P>Cicero is then proposed to be added to their league, and for the following good and prudent reason:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Metellus Cimber.</SPEAKER>
<L>O let us have him, for his silver hairs</L>
<L>Will purchase us a good opinion,</L>
<L>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds—</L>
<L>It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands;</L>
<L>Our youth and wildness shall no whit appear,</L>
<L>But all be buried in his gravity.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But he is objected to, on account of a sort of character, which is not uncommon in life, and is justly descriptive also of the person to whom it is applied; who, though certainly a very great man,
<PB N="452" REF="456"/>
was, notwithstanding, a vain and self-opinionated one likewise.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Brutus.</SPEAKER>
<L>O name him not; let us not break with him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Impart the secret to him.</NOTE>;</L>
<L><HI>For he will never follow any thing</HI></L>
<L><HI>That other men begin.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Afterwards, when Cassius urges the expediency of in∣volving Antony in the same doom with Caesar, Brutus very nobly refuses to concur, upon the following reasons:
<Q><L>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</L>
<L>To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,</L>
<L>Like wrath in death, and envy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Envy,</HI> for <HI>malice.</HI></NOTE> afterwards;</L>
<L>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar,</L>
<L>And in the spirit of man there is no blood.</L>
<L>Oh, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</L>
<L>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas!</L>
<L>Caesar must bleed for it—And, gentle friends,</L>
<L>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</L>
<L>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</L>
<L>Not hew him as a carcase fit for hounds;</L>
<L>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</L>
<L>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</L>
<L>And after seem to chide them <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This passage is very obscure, and the Commentators, according to their usual supineness, have left it unnoticed. The meaning may be this—Let us im∣pute the act to our passions instigated by our fears, and then appear to lament the violence of their proceedings.</NOTE>. This shall make</L>
<L>Our purpose necessary, and not envious;</L>
<L>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</L>
<L>We shall be deemed <HI>purgers,</HI> not <HI>murderers.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It were much to be wished, for the sake both of decency and humanity, that such a sentiment as this, was the spirit of laws relative to all capital punishments.—Breaking on the wheel, empaling, and other foreign penalties of death, are horrible even to thought; and what must they be to the view! Even our own code, though reckoned milder than our neighbours, is hardly less barbarous; in the instances of quartering, burning, and pressing to death, if executed according to the full rigour of the sentence. But the hangman, it seems, has more
<PB N="453" REF="457"/>
humanity than the legislature, as he is said always to render the criminal senseless, before he proceeds to the severity of the statute. He first kills the <HI>spirit,</HI> the <HI>demon</HI> of the law, and then only executes the <HI>dead</HI> letter of it.</P>
<P>There is a sentiment upon this subject, in a late writing, which I think may very properly be quoted here.
<Q>I would have all laws mild, but executed with the utmost strictness; so that justice and humanity may go hand in hand together. I am not for severe executions; for when the penalty exceeds the offence, it is not <HI>the criminal,</HI> but <HI>human nature</HI> that suffers. Death alone is suffi∣cient to remove the offender <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Series of Letters between Henry and Frances.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But methinks this argument might be urged still further in favour of clemency—Suppose we should reason thus:
<Q>All laws are a mutual compact of society entered into with itself. The <HI>Many</HI> can confide to the <HI>Few</HI> those rights only, which they respectively possess in themselves. To confer a power of death, then, should seem to imply <HI>a right of suicide.</HI></Q>
I declare myself unable to de∣tect any manner of sophistry, in such a syllogism.</P>

<P>The philosophy of death is well enough argued here, according to the old Stoical doctrine of fate, or predestination.

<P>Caesar speaks a sentence here, which shews him to have been worthy of a better fate.</P>
<P>When Artemidorus, upon seeing the number of papers presented to him on his march to the capital, cries out,
<Q><L>O, Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit,</L>
<L>That touches Caesar nearer—Read it, great Caesar—</L></Q>
he replies, in the true spirit of a prince,
<Q>What touches us ourself, shall be last served.</Q></P>
<P>And afterwards, when Metellus Cimber pleads for the repeal of his brother's banishment, he answers him with the proper steadiness of a person intrusted with the executive province of a legislature,
<Q><L>I must prevent thee. Cimber—</L>
<L>These couchings and these lowly curtesies</L>
<L>Might stir <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stir,</HI> instead of <HI>fire.</HI> <BIBL>Warburton.</BIBL></NOTE> the blood of ordinary men,</L>

<L>To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood,</L>
<L>That will be thawed from the true quality,</L>
<L>With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,</L>
<L>Low crooked curtesies, and base spaniel-fawning—</L>
<L>Thy brother by decree is banished;</L>
<L>If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn, for him,</L>
<L>I spurn thee, like a cur, out of my way—</L>
<L>Know Caesar doth not wrong; nor without cause</L>
<L>Will he be satisfied.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot help thinking, that the Poet has not given either Caesar fair play for his life, or Brutus for his character, in bringing on the assassination so immediately after the one has uttered, and the other heard, the two foregoing speeches.</P>
<P>The last sentence above was not necessary to be quoted, for the purpose of the speech, merely, as far as it had been specified in the note which pre∣cedes
<PB N="455" REF="459"/>
it; but I confess that I was anxious to pro∣duce it, in order to take an opportunity of vindi∣cating our Author from an absurdity of expression, which has been so disingenuously imputed to him by his rival, Ben Johnson, who charges him with hav∣ing wrote that passage thus:
<Q>"Caesar never did <HI>wrong,</HI> but with <HI>just cause.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Now, <HI>O rare Ben Johnson</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The epithet by which he is characterised on his tomb.</NOTE>, what manner of foundation could'st thou have for such a sarcasm, except in the envious malice of thine own nature? for the very copy from which the present text is taken, was published in thine own life-time.</P>
<P>Or, suppose that the line had really stood as Johnson has pretended to have quoted it, might not any candid critic, who was at all versed in the lati∣tude of expression generally made use of by Shake∣speare, have sufficiently obviated the contradiction in the terms, by only construing the word <HI>wrong,</HI> into the sense of <HI>injury?</HI> for a penalty is certainly an <HI>injury</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the sense of <HI>hurt,</HI> or <HI>detriment.</HI></NOTE>, though not a <HI>wrong.</HI></P>
<P>I hope my Reader will not think this note to be any manner of interruption to the general tenor of these remarks, as he must acknowledge that there is a proper moral in defending the Author of this great code of Ethics, from any aspersion thrown out against his sense, meaning, or character.</P>
<P>In the last passage of this Scene, the two prin∣cipal patriots, Brutus and Cassius, shew a noble spirit, in not endeavouring to support themselves after the deed by <HI>faction,</HI> in the common sense of the word, trusting solely to the justice and policy they had presumed in the act itself, for their security and defence.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="460"/>Cassius, speaking to Publius, who was present at the transaction, but not any way concerned in the conspiracy, says,

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>The assassination of Caesar is a fact famous in history; but notwithstanding the heroic opinion which the world has been taught to conceive of it, I confess that I have ever reputed its <HI>fame</HI> as a matter of <HI>notoriety</HI> rather than of <HI>applause.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only consider this action in the person of Brutus alone, because it has been thought that he was the only one among the conspirators who had engaged in it upon principle solely, as Antony has said above.</P>
<P>Plutarch has debated this subject, in his comparison of Brutus with Dion; and, in my opinion, seems to condemn it, upon the whole. At least, if we take in the character he there draws of Caesar, with the state and circumstances of the Commonwealth at that political crisis, it plainly appears that he meant to declare against it.</P>
<P>His words are:
<Q>With respect to Caesar, though, whilst his imperial power was in its infancy, he treated his opponents with severity; yet, as soon as that power was confirmed, the tyranny was rather a <HI>nominal,</HI> than a <HI>real</HI> thing; for no tyranni∣cal action could be laid to his charge. Nay, such was the condition of Rome then, that it evidently required a <HI>master</HI>; and Caesar was no more than <HI>a tender and skilful physician, appointed by Providence to heal the distempers of the state.</HI> Of course the people lamented his death, and were implacably enraged against his <HI>assassins.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Cowley, in his fine Ode to Brutus, brings heavy charges also against him, on account of this action; though he seems only to do so, in order to vindicate him from them. But then he does not pretend to defend him, from the facts themselves, justifying him only upon the higher principle which had rendered him <HI>guilty</HI> of them.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="465"/>However, I think that he is severer upon his heroe even than Plutarch, by mentioning that weak and unphilosophic exclamation of his, where he says, <HI>he had mistaken virtue for a good, but found it only a name.</HI></P>
<Q><L>What can we say, but thine own tragic word?</L>
<L>That <HI>virtue,</HI> which had worshipped been by thee,</L>
<L>As the most solid <HI>good,</HI> and greatest <HI>deity,</HI></L>
<L>By this fatal proof became</L>
<L>An <HI>idol</HI> only, and a <HI>name.</HI></L></Q>
<P>This circumstance his Biographer had favourably suffered to pass unnoticed; and of which Balzac says,
<Q>that Brutus seems to lament his disappointment here, <HI>as if he was upbraiding a jilting mistress.</HI></Q>
If he had acted solely from <HI>virtue,</HI> he would not have complained that he had missed the <HI>reward.</HI></P>
<P>But though the principle might have been ever so right, in itself, the action was certainly wrong, in him. There are duties involved in duties, sometimes, which may counteract each other, and thereby ren∣der what might be the <HI>virtue</HI> of one person, the <HI>vice</HI> of another. Many situations and cases of this kind may be proposed; but I shall not launch beyond my subject.</P>
<P>Brutus had many and great obligations to Caesar. He owed him his life—nay, 'tis said, even his <HI>first life</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caesar had an amour with Servilia, the mother of Brutus, before his birth.</NOTE>; and had the lives of several of his friends saved also at his intercession. He had ever lived with him in the greatest intimacy, and on the footing of his <HI>first friend.</HI> Nay, Caesar had created himself enemies, by his partiality towards him, in the preferring him to posts of profit and honour, which others, from their services, were better intitled to. One of these malecontents was Cassius, who from that very re∣sentment became the first mover and principal actor in the conspiracy. And were all these obligations to be cancelled by one dash of the <HI>Stoic</HI>'s-<HI>pen?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="466"/><HI>Stoical virtues</HI> are not always <HI>moral ones.</HI> Those metaphysical <HI>braveries</HI> (for I was wrong in calling them <HI>virtues</HI>) which exceed the feelings of humanity, have never, as I said before <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See first observation on Scene I. Act II. and another on first part of Scene V Act IV.</NOTE>, been able to inspire my mind with either admiration or esteem.</P>
<P>The sympathy of nature is wanting, and true philosophy has good reason to suspect every prin∣ciple or motive of action to be sophisticate, that bears not this <HI>original impression.</HI></P>

<P>Moral writers have been distinguished into two classes of philosophy; whereof one set of them are said to elevate human nature to the rank of angels, while the other depreciates it to the vileness of those, <HI>who had once been so.</HI> But our author represents it more impartially, neither inclining to one side or the other; for there is not, perhaps, a virtue or a vice in mankind, which he has not pointed out to us, in the several characters he has occasionally intro∣duced into his general drama. In this Scene he has afforded us an instance in the latter predicament, by a description of that invidiousness with which men are apt to regard superior merit in others; more especially in those talents, which they are ambitious of shining in themselves.</P>
<P>When Silius advises Ventidius to compleat his conquest over the Parthians, in order to recommend himself the more eminently to the favour of Antony, his general, the old soldier makes a reply, which shews him not only to have been versed in camps, but in courts also.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE II.</HEAD>
<P>Here follow two passages, which for elegance of thought, or beauty of expression, it is not in the power of poetical imagery or language to exceed.</P>
<P>When Octavia is taking leave of her brother Octavius Caesar, with all the shews of a tender af∣fection, Antony says,
<Q><L>The April's in her eyes. <HI>It is love's spring,</HI></L>
<L>And these the showers to bring it on. <HI>Be chearful.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And afterwards, when she endeavours to speak to him, but cannot, her difficulty is thus described:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Antony.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can</L>
<L>Her heart inform her tongue—<HI>the swan's down feather,</HI></L>

<DIV5 N="5" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE V.</HEAD>
<P>Octavius, upon seeing his sister returning in a pri∣vate character to Rome, without having afforded him timely notice to send forth a proper retinue to escort her, says,
<Q><L>Nay, the dust</L>
<L>Should have ascended to the roof of Heaven,</L>
<L>Raised by your populous troops; but you are come</L>
<L>A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented</L>
<L>The ostentation of our love; <HI>which, left unshewn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is often left unloved.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="474"/>There is something more to be understood, in this last sentiment, than can be perceived on a careless perusal of it. A warm affection within, naturally inspires correspondent emotions without. These are a sort of <HI>setting</HI> of the jewel, which not only orna∣ments, but helps to preserve it. In all the refined passions, the <HI>delicacy</HI> of a sentiment insures our con∣stancy, even more than the <HI>strength</HI> of it. The nice observances, the <HI>petits soins,</HI> which in such cases may be almost deemed <HI>petites morales,</HI> also, increase the mutual pleasures and confidences of love and friend∣ship. They are the <HI>comets</HI> which feed the <HI>sun.</HI> Even virtue itself, all perfect as it is, requires to be in∣spirited by passion; for duties are but coldly per∣formed, which are <HI>but philosophically</HI> fulfilled.</P>
<Q><STAGE>Octavius <HI>to his Sister.</HI></STAGE>
<L>Cheer your heart—</L>

<L>O'er your content these strong necessities;</L>
<L>But let determined things to <HI>destiny</HI></L>
<L>Hold unbewail'd their way.</L></Q>
<P>Here is very good advice given, if by the word <HI>destiny</HI> be understood <HI>Providence</HI>; which must certainly have been what the Antients meant by it, whenever they had any meaning about it at all; for most of the heathens made use of the expression, as too many Christians often do of an higher one, without affixing any manner of determinate idea to it in their minds. But the old <HI>wiseacres</HI> were not satisfied to leave non∣sense where they found it; they picked up the com∣mon speech, and elevated vulgar phrases into philo∣sophical principles. Hence the doctrines, that <HI>Nature</HI> created the world, and that <HI>Fate</HI> governed it, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE VII.</HEAD>
<P>Here follows a thought, which, though false in the sentiment, is but too true in the practice; and which, therefore, all men should be taught to be aware of.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="475"/>Antony, taking leave of his friends, after his shameful flight at Actium:
<Q><L>Pray ye, look not sad,</L>

<P>As my gentle Readers may expect to be treated with a little of the <HI>All for Love</HI> of Antony, in this Play, I shall here quote a passage relative to this subject, which we meet with in the present Scene.</P>
<P>When Cleopatra appears before him, after his de∣feat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which was occasioned by his quitting the sea-fight at Actium, to pursue Cleopatra's galley when it was sailing away.</NOTE>, he addresses himself to her thus:
<Q><L>O, whither hast thou led me, Aegypt? See</L>

<P>Shakespeare, in the above instance, appears to have been more galant than Milton, who does not suffer Adam to expostulate so mildly with Eve—
<Q><P>"Out of my sight, thou serpent."</P>
<BIBL>Book x. l. 867.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>However, we are to consider the infinite difference between the worlds that were lost upon those occasions. But as I do not think that the first man was more ex∣cusable for following the advice, than the other was for pursuing the galley of his mistress, when such
<PB N="472" REF="476"/>
prizes were at stake, their resentments ought to have been expressed only against themselves.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="9" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE IX.</HEAD>
<P>The natural connection and dependance of the inward upon the outward man, as it is here ex∣pressed, is well marked in this place.</P>
<P>When Antony, in a fit of despair, goes out to pen a personal challenge to Octavius, the following re∣flection is made:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Enobarbus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, like enough; high-battled <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Victorious.</NOTE> Caesar will</L>
<L>Unstate his happiness, and be staged to th' shew,</L>
<L>Against a sworder—<HI>I see men's judgments are</HI></L>

<L><HI>Do draw the inward quality after them,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To suffer all alike</HI>—That he should dream,</L>
<L>Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</L>
<L>Answer his emptiness!—Caesar, thou hast subdued</L>
<L>His judgment too.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>In this same Scene, Enobarbus, seeing the down∣fal of his master's fortunes, enters into debate with himself, whether he shall preserve his fidelity to him still, or shift about, and take part with the con∣queror; in which soliloquy he seems fairly to give the preference to the nobler side of the question, in his argument, though he afterwards determines against it, in his conduct.</P>
<P>But 'tis usually so, in all deliberations of this sort; for virtue and vice are of such opposite natures, that there is no possibility of bringing them at all into comparison by any sophister whose judgment has not before been rendered partial and corrupt. So that in such cases one may venture generally to pronounce, as the Poet does of women, that <HI>they who deliberate are lost.</HI></P>

<P>When Antony is told that Enobarbus had gone over to the enemy, but left his chests and effects behind him, he says,
<Q><L>Go, Eros, send his treasure after—Do it—</L>
<L>Detain no jot, I charge thee—Write to him—</L>
<L>I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings—</L>
<L>Say that I wish he never find more cause</L>
<L>To change a master. Oh, my fortunes have</L>

<P>There is such an heroic liberality of soul expressed here, as must make one lament the misfortunes of the unhappy Antony, even at this distance of time— for the fact here represented, is taken from historical record. We may justly say of him, as the soldier does here, upon delivering the message to Enobarbus,
<Q>Your emperor continues still a Jove.</Q></P>
<P>Antony was not only a braver and a greater, but a better man than his competitor for empire. Augustus was of a worthless, mean, jealous, and vengeful nature; though poets, and <HI>some historians,</HI> have deified him. But princes will have their flatterers.

<P>Here Enobarbus appears to have been equally struck with the generosity of his master, and his own vileness; upon which joint reflection he passes a very just sentence on himself.</P>

<L>And feel I am so most. O, Antony,</L>

<HEAD>SCENE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The contrition of Enobarbus was sincere; for here the strong sense of his baseness bursts his swoln heart:
<Q><L>O bear me witness, night!</L>
<L>Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon!</L>
<L>When men revolted shall upon record</L>
<L>Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did</L>
<L>Before thy face repent! . . . . .</L>
<L>O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,</L>
<L>The poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me,</L>
<L>That life, a very rebel to my will,</L>
<L>May hang no longer on me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have left out a passage here, which only disgraces this fine speech.</NOTE>! O Antony,</L>
<L>Nobler than my revolt is infamous,</L>

<L>But let the world rank me in register,</L>
<L>A master-leaver, and a fugitive—</L>
<L>Oh Antony! Oh Antony! <STAGE>Dies.</STAGE></L></Q></P>
<P>I shall not pretend to dispute a knowledge of human nature with Shakespeare, but, if he had not given us a representation of this character, I should hardly have been brought to imagine that a breast capable of harbouring such treachery and vileness, could ever, at the same time, have contained a spirit of so much honour, and so strong a sense of shame.</P>
<P>One of the centinels, upon seeing him sink down on the ground, says to his companion, that he has fallen asleep; but the other, who had overheard his soliloquy, replies, very justly,
<Q><L><HI>Swoons, rather;</HI> for so bad a prayer as his,</L>

<P>WHEN the insidious Jachimo drops mysteri∣ous hints to the guileless Imogen, that he is possessed of some secret relative to her husband, which he hesitates to reveal, she urges him to the discovery of it, in these words:
<Q><L>You do seem to know</L>

<L>Since doubting things go ill often hurts more,</L>

<L>What both you spur and stop.</L></Q></P>
<P>The nature of the human mind is well shewn here; it presses still to know the worst of every ap∣prehended evil; though not on account of the argu∣ment above proposed, which is rather ingenious than just; but merely to satisfy the impatience, and re∣lieve the suspence of doubt. Providence has cer∣tainly a design, in every kind of impression it makes upon its creatures; and the reason that Imogen gives here, may, perhaps, be its true one, in this case: but what I contend for is, That such a reflection is not the real source of our curiosity upon these oc∣casions.

<P><PB N="480" REF="483"/>Bellarius, speaking to his two pupils, Guiderius and Arviragus, concealed princes, as they are going a-hunting:
<Q><L>Now for our mountain sport; up to yon hill,</L>

<L>That it is <HI>place,</HI> which lessens and sets off.</L>
<L>And you may then revolve what tales I told you,</L>

<P>In the same Scene this subject is renewed again, by the same speaker, with further instances and richer reflections.</P>
<Q><L>Did you but know the city's usuries,</L>

<L>As hard to leave, as keep; whose top to climb,</L>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Pisanio, speaking of slander, says,
<Q><L>Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue</L>
<L>Out-venoms all the worms of <HI>Nile</HI>; whose breath</L>
<L>Rides on the posting winds, and doth belye</L>
<L>All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,</L>
<L><PB N="481" REF="484"/>Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,</L>
<L>This viperous slander enters.</L></Q></P>
<P>The above passage needs no comment, but what every Reader's experience, either in his own case or that of others, may enable him to supply.</P>
<P>In the same Scene, which is a forest, Imogen, upon reading her mistaken husband's mandate to Pisanio, requiring him to put her to death, on a presumption of her having been false to his bed, thus exclaims:
<Q><L><HI>False to his bed!</HI> What is it to be false?</L>
<L>To lie in watch there, and to think on him?</L>
<L>To weep 'twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,</L>
<L>To break it with a fearful dream of him,</L>
<L>And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed! is't?</L></Q></P>
<P>Nothing, in situation of circumstance, in thought, or expression, can exceed the beauty or tender effect of the above passage. It catches such quick hold of our sympathy, that we feel as if the scene was real, and are at once transported amidst the gloom and silence of the forest, in spite of all the glare of the Theatre, and the loud applause of the audience. It is in such instances as these, that Shakespeare has never yet been equalled, and can never be excelled. What a power of natural sentiment must a man have been possessed of, who could so adequately express that kind of ingenuous surprize upon such a challenge, which none but a woman can possibly feel! Shake∣speare could not only assume all characters, but even their sexes too—This whole Scene is beautiful, but falls not within our rule to transcribe any more of it here. The Commentators are all dumb upon this fine passage—not silent in admiration, but frozen into scholastic apathy.

<Q>That <HI>they want parts to be devout,</HI> and could as soon make an epic poem, as a fervent prayer.</Q></P>

<L>I've tired myself; and for two nights together</L>

<P>There is a true spirit of natural bravery expressed here. When Cloten meets Guiderius in the forest, and challenges him to yield himself a prisoner, he replies,
<Q><L>To whom? To thee! What art thou? Have not I</L>
<L>An arm as big as thine? A heart as big?</L>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>After <HI>Guiderius</HI> has slain <HI>Cloten</HI> in fight, his bro∣ther <HI>Arviragus</HI> says he envies him the action, and wishes for some such trial of danger to exercise his own spirit upon. On this occasion old Bellarius makes the following reflection:
<Q><L>O thou goddess,</L>
<L>Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st▪</L>
<L>In these two princely boys! They are as gentle,</L>
<L>As zephyrs blowing beneath the violet,</L>
<L><HI>Not wagging his sweet head</HI>; and yet as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough,</L>
<L>Their royal blood enchaf'd, <HI>as th' rudest wind,</HI></L>
<L>That by the top doth take the mountain pine,</L>
<L><HI>And make him stoop to th' vale.</HI> 'Tis wonderful,</L>
<L>That an invisible instinct should frame them</L>
<L>To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught;</L>
<L>Civility not seen from other; valour</L>
<L>That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop,</L>
<L>As if it had been sowed.</L></Q></P>
<P>The notion here expressed, is one of the many antient pieces of superstition that modern philo∣sophy has finally destroyed. The lion has long since lost its instinct for princes, as well as for virgins. Human nature is the same throughout; it is edu∣cation alone that distinguishes man from man. There are, indeed, great differences often observable be∣tween the talents and intellects of the species; but this distinction is remarked in <HI>individuals,</HI> only, not in the <HI>classes</HI> of mankind.</P>

<P>But though I dispute the argument of <HI>Bellarius</HI> in the last Scene, I allow him perfectly right in this one, where, on giving order for the funeral of <HI>Cloten,</HI> he says,
<Q><L>He was a queen's son, boys;</L>
<L>And though he came our enemy, remember,</L>
<L>He was paid for that; though mean and mighty, rotting</L>

<L>That angel of the world <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Reverence,</HI> or a due regard to subordination, keeps peace and order in the world. <BIBL>Johnson.</BIBL></NOTE>, doth make distinction</L>

<P>THE description of Ajax in this Play is worth transcribing, as being humorous in itself, agreeing with the representation of him in the Iliad, and because it may be applied also in part to many, and in the whole to a few, medley characters that are frequently to be met with in life.</P>
<STAGE>Alexander <HI>to</HI> Cressida.</STAGE>
<P>This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their particular ad∣ditions. He is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant; a man, into whom Nature hath so crouded humours, that his valour is crusted into folly, his folly sauced with discretion; there is no man hath a virtue, that he has not a glimpse of; nor any man an attaint, but he carries some stain of it. He is melan∣choly without cause, and merry against the hair; he hath the joints of every thing, but every thing so out of joint, that he is a gouty <HI>Briareus,</HI> many hands, and no use; or purblind <HI>Argus,</HI> all eyes, and no sight.</P>

<DIV5 N="4" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Cressida's speech here, in reference to her wooer Troilus, contains very just reflections and prudent maxims for the conduct of women, in the dangerous circumstance of love. What she says, would be∣come the utterance of the most virtuous matron, though her own character in this piece is unluckily a bad one. But our Author's genius teemed so fertile in document, that he was unable to restrain its impulse, and coolly wait for a fit opportunity of adapting the speaker to the speech. Shakespeare's faults arise from richness, not from poverty; they exceed, not fall short; his monsters never want a head, but have sometimes two.</P>
<Q><L>Yet hold I off—Women are angels wooing?</L>
<L>Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.</L>

<L>In mere oppugnancy. The bounded waters</L>

<L>Then every thing include itself in power,</L>
<L>Power into will, will into appetite;</L>

<L>And last eat up itself. Great <HI>Agamemnon,</HI></L>
<L>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</L>
<L>Follows the choking;</L>
<L>And this neglection of degree is it,</L>
<L>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</L>
<L>It has to climb. The general's disdained</L>
<L>By him one step below; he, by the next;</L>

<P>In this place is given us a specimen of the antient chivalry, as first inspired by love and galantry, and exercised in honour or defence of women. <HI>Aeneas,</HI> attended by an herald, bringing a challenge from <HI>Hector,</HI> to any champion in the <HI>Grecian</HI> camp who will accept it, delivers himself thus:
<Q><L>Kings, princes, lords!</L>
<L>If there be one amongst the fair'st of <HI>Greece,</HI></L>
<L>That holds his honour higher than his ease,</L>
<L>That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</L>
<L>That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,</L>
<L>That loves his mistress more than in profession</L>
<L>With truant vows to her own lips he loves,</L>
<L>And dare avow her beauty and her worth,</L>
<L>In other arms than hers; to him this challenge—</L>
<L><HI>Hector,</HI> in view of <HI>Trojans</HI> and of <HI>Greeks,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="492" REF="495"/>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it.</L>
<L>He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</L>
<L>Than ever <HI>Greek</HI> did compass in his arms;</L>
<L>And will, to-morrow, with his trumpet, call,</L>
<L>Midway between your tents and wall of <HI>Troy,</HI></L>
<L>To rouse a <HI>Grecian</HI> that is true in love—</L>
<L>If any come, <HI>Hector</HI> shall honour him;</L>
<L>If none, he'll say in <HI>Troy,</HI> when he retires,</L>
<L>The <HI>Grecian</HI> dames are sun-burned, and not worth</L>
<L>The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which <HI>Agamemnon</HI> replies:
<Q><L>This shall be told our lovers, lord <HI>Aeneas</HI>—</L>
<L>If none of them have soul in such a kind,</L>
<L>We've left them all at home. But we are soldiers;</L>

<P>Old <HI>Nestor</HI>'s speech upon this occasion is well worth adding here, both for the humour of his ex∣pressions, and to compleat the idea of <HI>knight-errantry,</HI> in which profession of arms, neither difference of age, or other imparity whatsoever, were allowed to be pleaded as exemptions, by the laws of such ro∣mantic chivalry.</P>

<HEAD>ROMEO and JULIET.</HEAD>
<P>WERE it my province to have selected the poetical beauties of our Author, there are few of his Plays that would have furnished me more amply than this. The language abounds with ten∣derness and delicacy, and seems to breathe the soul of youthful fondness; but neither the fable nor the dialogue can afford much assistance toward my pre∣sent purpose; as the first is founded on a vicious prejudice unknown to the liberal minds of Britons, that of entailing family feuds and resentments down from generation to generation; and the second, as far, at least, as the lovers are concerned, though poetical and refined, is dictated more by passion than by sentiment.</P>
<P>But as my young Readers might not forgive my passing over this Play unnoticed, I shall just observe, that the catastrophe of the unhappy lovers seems intended as a kind of moral, as well as poetical justice, for their having ventured upon an unweighed engagement together, without the concurrence and consent of their parents. See my reflection on the first Scene, Act I. <HI>Midsummer Night's Dream,</HI> where this duty and obedience is both enforced and re∣strained.</P>

<L>Is it a custom?</L>

<L>Ay, marry, is 't:</L>

<L>This <HI>heavy-headed revel,</HI> east and west,</L>

<P>From hence the speaker takes occasion to extend his reflection into a general observation, which most people's experience may enable them to support, that some accidental peculiarity of mind, of man∣ners, nay, even of features, have often hurt the characters, and marred the fortunes of particular persons of intrinsic worth and merit.</P>
<Q><L>So, oft it chances in particular men,</L>
<L>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</L>

<P>No Eastern sentiment inspired by the first beams of the Sun, and refined by the sublimest morality of Confucius, ever rose to so high a pitch, as the tenderness expressed in these two passages toward his wife—even after her crimes. Have either the Greek or Latin masters of the Epic afforded us so beautiful an instance of forgiveness, and of love subsisting even beyond the grave? They have both of them presented us with scenes after death; but compare the behaviour of <HI>Dido</HI> upon meeting <HI>Aeneas</HI> in the Elysian fields, with this, as being the most parallel passage I can recollect. He had not been any thing near so culpable towards her, as this queen had been to her husband; and yet the utmost temper that the <HI>heathen</HI> Poet could bring his Ghost to, upon that occasion, was merely to be silent, and not upbraid, <HI>in speech</HI>; though he makes her suffi∣ciently mark her resentment, by her <HI>looks and behaviour.</HI></P>

<L>It seems, it is as proper to our age,</L>

</SP></Q>
<P>Upon this reflection Doctor <HI>Johnson</HI> says,
<Q>This is not the remark of a weak man.</Q>
It is not, in∣deed; but why should <HI>Polonius</HI> be deemed so? He certainly speaks very good sense, throughout, though with the natural and <HI>respectable</HI> mixture of the old man in it; which, methinks, as Addison says of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He wrote a treatise on <HI>health and long life,</HI> at fourscore, commended in the Spectator, No. 195.</NOTE> stile, is an improvement to it. As to the manner in which he describes Hamlet's madness, in Scene IV. following, I take it to be only designed by <HI>Shakespeare</HI> in ridicule of the old pedantic mode of definitions, or quaint distinctions, in logic and philosophy; the <HI>categories, predicaments,</HI> and <HI>predi∣cables</HI> of the <HI>Schools,</HI> used in those times. There are
<PB N="510" REF="511"/>
many instances of the same oblique strictures, upon other subjects, in our Author; I have, therefore, ever thought this character mistaken, and conse∣quently misrepresented on the Stage, by its being generally given to a comic actor.</P>

<P>The famous soliloquy of Hamlet, here, <HI>To be, or not to be,</HI> is so generally remembered, and has been so often remarked upon, that I might possibly be thought guilty of a neglect, in passing it by with∣out a comment. But the subject is a hazardous one, and therefore had better not be meddled with. It might, perhaps, bear a discussion in philosophy, but religion forbids any manner of debate upon it.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Shakespeare</HI> not only affords documents to real life, but supplies them even to the mimic one; as may be seen in this Scene, where he makes <HI>Hamlet</HI> give instructions to Actors how they should perform their parts. But as there is no moral to be extracted from the passage, I shall not quote it here.</P>
<P>But all these rules, however excellent in them∣selves, may be considered rather as strictures on bad performers, than precepts for their reformation. Actors, like Poets, must be born, not made; and <HI>a receipt to form an Actor,</HI> may be considered in the same light with the one <HI>to frame an Epic poem.</HI> It is not so much from want of <HI>notion,</HI> as of <HI>Nature,</HI> that so many of the <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI> are found to be deficient in the expression of sentiment, and repre∣sentation of character.</P>
<P><HI>Talents</HI> are as necessary to Actors, as <HI>Genius</HI> is to Authors; if I may be allowed such a distinction of terms—but neither are to be acquired in the schools. All Mr. Garrick's <HI>art,</HI> without his <HI>nature,</HI> would produce no effect, as may be seen in the many who
<PB N="511" REF="512"/>
have <HI>laboriously,</HI> but vainly attempted to copy him. I have known persons capable of writing a part, who were incapable of performing it. Our Author him∣self was an instance of this inconsistency; who, though he formed the <HI>rule,</HI> could not supply the <HI>example.</HI></P>

<P>The reflections in the above speech contain a very just and political moral in them; which ought to be opposed to all rebellious motions that may ever arise in the minds of a discontented people.

<HEAD>OTHELLO.</HEAD>
<P>SHAKESPEARE has written three pieces on the subject of jealousy; the Winter's Tale, Cym∣beline, and this one, besides the character of Ford, in the Merry Wives. But such was the richness of his genius, that he has not borrowed a single thought, image, or expression, from any one of them, to assist him in any of the others. The subject seems rather to have grown progressively out of itself, to have inspired its own sentiments, and have dictated its own language. This Play, in my opinion, is very justly considered as the last and greatest effort of our Author's genius, and may, therefore, be looked upon as the <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of dramatic composition.</P>
<P>How perfectly does Othello's conduct throughout, correspond with Iago's description of it in the latter end of the First Act!</P>
<Q><L>The Moor is of a free and open nature,</L>
<L>That thinks men honest, who but seem to be so.</L></Q>
<P>Such a character is not uncommon in life; whose virtues, arising more from an excellence of nature, than an exertion of philosophy, is led to judge of others by itself, and of course become the dupe of art and villainy.</P>

<P>The argument between philosophy and feeling, in cases of misfortune or grief, is well debated here. The Duke, preaching patience to the father, upon his daughter's elopement with the Moor, says,
<Q><L>Good Brabantio,</L>
<L>Take up this mangled matter at the best.</L>
<L>Men do their broken weapons rather use,</L>
<L>Than their bare hands.</L>
<L>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended,</L>
<L>By seeing the worst, which late on hope depended;</L>
<L>To mourn a mischief that is lost and gone,</L>
<L>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.</L>
<L>What cannot be preserved, when fortune takes,</L>
<L>Patience her injury a mockery makes;</L>
<L>The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief;</L>
<L>He robs himself who spends a bootless grief.</L>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brabantio.</SPEAKER>
<L>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,</L>
<L>We lose it not so long as we can smile.</L>
<L>He bears the sentence well, who nothing bears,</L>
<L>But the free comfort which from thence he hears <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the homily usually made by a judge, on passing sentence.</NOTE>;</L>
<L>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow,</L>
<L>That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow.</L>
<L>These sentences to sugar or to gall,</L>
<L>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.</L>
<L>But words are words. I never yet did hear,</L>
<L>That the bruised heart was healed through the ear.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>I may possibly be reprehended, by some severe moralists, for noting the equipoise of such an argu∣ment as this. In this instance, indeed, I confess that I act contrary to the usual tenor of document, which always takes part on the <HI>wise</HI> side of a ques∣tion. But, as I have said before <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Last Part of Postscript to Julius Caesar, with other passages referred to in the Notes.</NOTE>, I do not think that ethic philosophy can ever be a gainer, by over∣straining the sinews of the human mind. We ought neither to be votaries to the Cynic nor the Stoic sects. We should not, with Diogenes, <HI>follow Nature</HI> in the mere animal sense of the expression, nor with Zeno fly beyond it, in the metaphysical one. True

virtue has no extremes. Its sphere extends not be∣yond the <HI>Temperate</HI> Zones. It sleeps in the Frozen, and but raves in the Torrid ones.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE X.</HEAD>
<P>I have before observed upon the exuberance of Shakespeare's document and moral. He so much abounds in maxim and reflection, that he appears fre∣quently at a loss to find proper characters, through∣out even his own extensive drama, sufficient to parcel them out to; so that he is frequently obliged to make his fools talk sense, and set his knaves a∣preaching. An instance of the latter impropriety may be seen in the following passage, which contains both sound philosophy, and useful admonition. But that it may have the better effect on my readers, I wish that whenever they remember the speech, they could contrive to forget the speaker.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rodorigo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond; but it is not in my <HI>virtue</HI> to amend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iago.</SPEAKER>
<P>Virtue? a fig. <HI>'Tis in ourselves that we are thus, or thus.</HI> Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce; set hyssop, and weed up thyme; supply it with one gender of herbs, or distract it with many; either have it sterile with idleness, or manured with in∣dustry; why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our will. If the ballance of our lives had not one scale of reason, to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions.</P>
</SP>
<P>The plea that Rodorigo offers above, for remaining still under the dominion of a lawless passion, is framed upon a fatal error, too prevalent in the world, that <HI>virtue</HI> is a peculiar gift from Heaven, granted <HI>speciali gratiâ,</HI> as it were, to particular and chosen persons. Hence indolent minds are apt to conclude it a vain task to restrain their passions, or resist their tempta∣tions, without the supernatural aid of such an innate endowment. Iago, in his reply, reasons very justly against this dangerous and discouraging doctrine of <HI>partial grace</HI>; in support of which argument I shall
<PB N="522" REF="523"/>
here add a passage from a modern writer, who, speaking on this subject, says,
<Q>The difficulties we apprehend, more than those we find, in the strife with all our passions, is the only thing that pre∣vents philosophy or virtue from being commonly attainable in general life. What makes the dif∣ference between a chaste woman, and a frail one? <HI>The one had struggled, and the other not.</HI> Between a brave man and a coward? <HI>The one had struggled, and the other not.</HI> An honest man and a knave? <HI>One had struggled, the other not</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Posthumous Works of a late Celebrated Genius deceased.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>There is a good deal of after-wit reflection here, which, however, may serve as a forewarning, perhaps, to some of my Readers. Iago seeing Cassio despond∣ing, on being cashiered by Othello, asks if he be hurt? To which he replies,

<Q><L>Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy?</L>

<P>It has often surprized me, to find the character of Desdemona so much mistaken and slighted, as it too generally is. It is simple, indeed, but that is one of its merits: for the simplicity of it is that of <HI>in∣nocence,</HI> not of <HI>folly.</HI> In my opinion, she seems to be as perfect a model of a wife, as either this author, or any other writer, could possibly have framed. She speaks little; but whatever she says is sensible, pure, and chaste. The remark she makes in this place, on the alteration of Othello's manners towards her, affords a very proper admonition to all women in her situation and circumstances.</P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many favourite passages in Shake∣speare, which most of my Readers have got by heart, and missing here, may possibly object to my having neglected to quote or observe upon them, in their proper places. But my intention, in this Work, was not to propound the beauties of the Poet, but to expound the document of the Moralist, throughout his writings.</P>
<P>So far from being insensible to the other excel∣lencies of this Author, I have ever thought him by much the greatest poet of our nation, for sub∣limity of idea, and beauty of expression. Perhaps I may even think myself guilty of some injustice, in limiting his fame within the narrow confines of these kingdoms; for, upon a comparison with the much venerated names of Antiquity, I am of opi∣nion, that we need not surrender the British Palm, either to the Grecian Bay, or the Roman Laurel, with regard to the principal parts of poetry; as thought, sentiment, or description—And though the dead languages are confessed to be superior to ours, yet even here, in the very article of diction, our Author shall measure his pen with any of the antient <HI>styles,</HI> in their most admired compound and decom∣pound epithets, descriptive phrases, or figurative expressions. <HI>The multitudinous sea, ear-piercing fife, big war, giddy mast, sky-aspiring, heaven-kissing hill, time-honoured name, cloud-capt towers, heavenly-harnessed team, rash gunpowder, polished perturbation, gracious silence, golden care, trumpet-tongued, thought-executing fires</HI>; with
<PB N="526" REF="527"/>
a number of other words, both epic and comic, are instances of it. But with regard to the moral ex∣cellencies of our English <HI>Confucius,</HI> either for beauty or number, he undoubtedly challenges the wreath from the whole collective Host of Greek or Roman Writers, whether ethic, epic, dramatic, didactic, or historic.</P>
<P>Mrs. Montagu says, very justly, that
<Q>We are apt to consider Shakespeare only as a poet; but he is certainly one of the greatest moral philo∣sophers that ever lived.</Q>
And this is true; be∣cause, in his universal scheme of doctrine, he com∣prehends manners, proprieties, and decorums; and whatever relates to these, to personal character, or national description, falls equally within the great line of morals. Horace prefers Homer to all the philosophers,
<Q><L>Qui, quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</L>
<L>Pleniùs et meliùs Chrysippo et Crantore dicit.</L></Q>
And surely Shakespeare <HI>pleniùs et meliùs</HI> excels him again, as much as the living scene exceeds the dead letter, as action is preferable to didaction, or repre∣sentation to declamation.</P>
<P>Example is better than precept. A dramatic moral affords us the benefit of both, at once. Plato wished that Virtue could assume a visible form. Dramatic exhibition gives one, both to Virtue and to Vice. The abstract idea is there materialized. The contrast of character, too, affords an additional strength to the moral; as we are led to love virtue, on a double account, by being made to abhor vice, at the same time. The dramatic moralist possesses a manifest advantage over the doctrinal one. Mere descriptions of virtue or vice do not strike us, so strongly, as the visible representations of them. Richard the Third's dream, Lady Macbeth's soli∣loquy in her sleep, the Dagger Scene in the same Play, Cardinal Beaufort's last moments, with many other passages in our Author, of the same admoni∣tory
<PB N="527" REF="528"/>
kind, avail us more than whole volumes of Tully's Offices, or Seneca's Morals.</P>
<P>In this scenic province of instruction, our repre∣sentations are much better calculated to answer the end proposed, than those of the Antients were, on account of the different hours of exhibition. Theirs were performed in the morning; which circumstance suffered the salutary effect to be worn out of the mind, by the business or avocations of the day. Ours are at night; the impressions accompany us to our couch, supply matter for our latest reflec∣tions, and may sometimes furnish the subject of our very dreams.</P>
<P>But Shakespeare seems to have extended his views still further; by frequently interspersing allusions to the Scriptures, throughout his writings. I would not have the old <HI>Mysteries</HI> restored to the Stage, nor should Dramatic Dialogue exceed into Sermons; but I think, that such occasional hints or passages, as this Author has supplied, when thrown in sparingly, and introduced with discretion, may sometimes serve to add a strength and dignity to the stile and subject of such compositions; besides the advantage of pro∣ducing, perhaps, effects of an higher nature, by calling our attention to more serious reflections, in the very midst of our pleasures and dissipations, with∣out sinking our spirits, or damping our enjoyments; awakening us to the contemplation of a religion so pure, so equally free from the severities of disci∣pline, and the superstitions of devotion; of a system of theology, framed even as Man himself would chuse; in fine, of a faith and doctrine, which has but stronger bound the social ties, given an higher sanction to moral obligations, and proved our duty to be our interest also.</P>
<P>Having now arrived at the last page of my task, I must confess the apprehensions I am sensible of, on presenting to the Public a Work of so much diffi∣culty and danger: though with regard to the first of
<PB N="528" REF="529"/>
these articles, I acknowledge this to have been one in the class of those, of which Ferdinand in the Tempest says,
<Q><L>There be some sports are painful, but their labour</L>
<L>Delight in them sets off.</L></Q>
But in respect to the latter, I must here throw my∣self not only upon the candor, but the indulgence of my Readers; hoping that the many failures in the execution may be pardoned, on the single merit of the design.</P>
