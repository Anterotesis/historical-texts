<L>THE garden blooms with vegetable gold,</L>
<L>And all Pomona in the orchard glows,</L>
<L>Her racy fruits now glory in the sun,</L>
<L>The wall-enamour'd flower in saffron blows,</L>
<L>Gay annuals their spicy sweets unfold;</L>
<L>To cooling brooks the panting cattle run:</L>
<L>Hope, the fore-runner of the farmer's gain,</L>
<L>Visits his dreams, and multiplies the grain.</L>

<L>More hot it grows, ye fervors of the sky</L>
<L>Attend the Virgin—lo! she comes to hail</L>
<L>Your sultry radiance—Now the God of day</L>
<L>Meets her chaste star—be present Zephyr's gale</L>
<L>To fan her bosom—let the breezes fly</L>
<L>On silver pinions to salute his ray;</L>
<L>Bride of his soft desires, with comely grace</L>
<L>He clasps the virgin to his warm embrace.</L>

<L>The reapers now their shining sickles bear,</L>
<L>A band illustrious, and the sons of Health!</L>

<L>The partridge-covey to the copse repair</L>

<L>Courtly Augustus, whom the bards rever'd,</L>

<L>Myra and I, together in the shade,</L>

<HEAD>ELEGY, ON DELIA'S BEING IN THE COUNTRY, WHERE HE SUPPOSES SHE STAYS TO SEE THE HARVEST.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE LATE MR. HAMMOND.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NOW Delia breathes in woods the fragrant air,</L>
<L>Dull are the hearts that still in town remain,</L>
<L>Venus herself attends on Delia there,</L>
<L>And Cupid sports amid the sylvan train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! with what joy my Delia to behold,</L>
<L>I'd press the spade, or wield the weighty prong,</L>
<L>Guide the slow plough-share thro' the stubborn mold,</L>
<L>And patient goad the loitering ox along!</L>

<L>The scorching heats I'll carelessly despise,</L>
<L>Nor heed the blisters on my tender hand;</L>
<L>The great Apollo wore the same disguise,</L>
<L>Like me subdued to Love's supreme command.</L>
</LG>

<L>No healing herbs could sooth their matter's pain,</L>
<L>The art of physic lost and useless lay,</L>
<L>To Peneus' stream, and Tempe's shady plain,</L>
<L>He drove his herds beneath the noon-tide ray:</L>

<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Oft, with a bleating lamb in either arm,</L>

<L>Where are his triumphs? where his warlike toil?</L>
<L>Where by his darts the crested Python slain?</L>
<L>Where are his Delphi? his delightful isle?</L>
<L>The God himself is grown a cottage swain.</L>

<L>Our wiser fathers left the fields unsown,</L>

<HEAD>THE MULBERRY GARDEN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHen in full pride autumnal fields appear,</L>
<L>And ripen'd plenty loads the smiling year,</L>
<L>With grassy honours cloaths the verdant plain,</L>
<L>And golden harvests wave their bending grain,</L>
<L>Lead me where trees, in lengthening ranks display'd,</L>
<L>Please with their fruit, and solace with their shade;</L>
<L>Where dewy mulberries their refreshment lend,</L>
<L>And thro' the grove with burthen'd boughs extend,</L>
<L>The spreading leaves with salutary food</L>
<L>Sustain the tender silk-worm's toiling brood,</L>
<L>Whose labour'd webs the shady verdure crown,</L>
<L>And dress their surface with a shining down.</L>
<L>Such on Acanthus' woolly leaves are bred,</L>
<L>And where their silken groves the Seres spread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! on the trees that bend with clustering weight,</L>
<L>The juicy berries swell in purple state.</L>
<L>Not apples that Alcinous' gardens bear,</L>
<L>The melting plumb, nor fam'd Crustumian pear;</L>
<L>Nor fruits of golden, or transparent rind,</L>
<L>In relish equal this delicious kind.</L>
<L>The careful dames a plenteous wine produce,</L>
<L>And brew with mingling spice the pleasing juice.</L>
<L>The Rhetic grape not purer nectar yields,</L>
<L>Nor the proud growth of rich Falernian fields.</L>
<L>Let the cool draught my thirsty veins supply,</L>
<L>When sultry Sirius taints the fervid sky,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Thy gifts, O Bacchus, more intemperate prove,</L>
<L>And to rash heats th' unruly passions move.</L>
<L>By wine enflam'd young Ammon basely spilt</L>
<L>His friend's warm gore, an unexampled guilt.</L>
<L>Provok'd by wine the Centaurs heated train</L>
<L>Presum'd with blood the bridal board to stain.</L>
<L>Wine arm'd with rage the mad Ciconian crew,</L>
<L>Whose hands profane the sacred Thracian flew.</L>
<L>Anacreon's fate its mischiefs shall enroll,</L>
<L>And direful Circe's fascinating bowl.</L>
<L>With softer draughts this temperate liquor ply,</L>
<L>Nor fear a threatening from its sanguine die:</L>
<L>A borrow'd tincture, for, with native white,</L>
<L>The pendant berries first allur'd the sight,</L>
<L>'Till hapless Pyramus, by love betray'd,</L>
<L>Found the torn mantle of th' expected maid:</L>
<L>Mistaken omen! and, with fatal haste,</L>
<L>On the drawn steel his blooming body cast.</L>
<L>The snowy fruit, that there untainted grew,</L>
<L>Wash'd with his gore, forsook their silver hue,</L>
<L>Their swelling pores receive a deepening stain,</L>
<L>And still the lover's memory they retain.</L>
<L>For, as the circling year with fruit returns,</L>
<L>The pitying tree in graceful sable mourns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye fair, who oft, beneath its verdure plac'd,</L>
<L>In sultry hours this cooling berry taste;</L>
<L>When, with warm lips, you press the purple dew,</L>
<L>And on your snowy hands the print you view;</L>
<L>To let your generous pity more appear,</L>
<L>Dilute the harmless crimson with a tear.</L>

<L>Home to his barns, and leave the naked plain:</L>

<HEAD>INSCRIPTION IN A SUMMER-HOUSE BELONGING TO THE LATE GILBERT WEST, ESQ. AT WICKHAM IN KENT.</HEAD>
<L>HAEC mihi nec procul urbe sita est, nec prorsus ad urbem,</L>
<L>Ne patiar turbas, utque bonis potiar;</L>
<L>Et quoties mutare locum fastigia cogunt,</L>
<L>Transeo, et alternis rure vel urbe fruar.</L>

<L>NOT wrapt in smoky London's sulphurous clouds,</L>
<L>And not far distant stands my rural cot:</L>
<L>Neither obnoxious to intruding crouds,</L>
<L>Nor for the good and friendly too remote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when too much repose brings on the spleen,</L>
<L>Or the gay city's idle pleasures cloy;</L>
<L>Swift as my changing wish I shift the scene,</L>
<L>And now the country, now the town enjoy.</L>

<HEAD>AN EPITAPH IN A COUNTRY CHURCH-YARD IN KENT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE CELEBRATED MR. G—.</BYLINE>
<L>LO! where this silent marble weeps,</L>
<L>A friend, a wife, a mother, sleeps,</L>
<L>A heart, within whose sacred cell</L>
<L>The peaceful virtues lov'd to dwell:</L>
<L>Affection warm, and faith sincere,</L>
<L>And soft humanity were there.</L>
<L>In agony, in death, resign'd,</L>
<L>She felt the wound she left behind:</L>
<L>Her infant image, here below,</L>
<L>Sits smiling on a father's woe:</L>
<L>Whom what awaits, while thus he strays</L>
<L>Along the lonely vale of days?</L>
<L>A pang, to secret sorrow dear,</L>
<L>A sigh, an unavailing tear,</L>
<L>'Till time shall every grief remove,</L>
<L>With life, with memory, and with love.</L>

<HEAD>EPITAPH ON GENERAL WOLFE, IN THE CHURCH OF WESTERHAM IN KENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>James,</L><L>Son of colonel Edward Wolfe, and</L><L>Henrietta his wife,</L><L>Was born in this parish, January 2, 1727.</L><L>And died in America, Sep. 13, 1759.</L><L>Conqueror of Quebec.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<L>WHile George, in sorrow, bows his laurell'd head,</L>
<L>And bids the artist grace the soldier dead;</L>
<L>We raise no sculptur'd trophy to thy name,</L>
<L>Brave youth! the fairest in the lists of fame:</L>
<L>Proud of thy birth, we boast th' auspicious year;</L>
<L>Struck with thy fall, we shed the general tear;</L>
<L>With humble grief inscribe one artless stone,</L>
<L>And from thy matchless honours date our own.</L>
