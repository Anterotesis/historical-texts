<HEAD>TO ELIZABETH, COUNTESS OF MOIRA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE attention you have vouchsafed to the Countess of Salisbury and the Author, ever since they have had the honour of being known to your Ladyship, persuades me that you will take pleasure in hearing it has been favourably received on the English Theatre. Stript now of all stage decoration, and the assistance which it has hitherto received from the most animated performance, it is to undergo a stricter scrutiny, that of the closet; a scrutiny for which it is indeed but little provided. I know your Ladyship will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the Author, and such errors as are incident to human inperfection; but this is an indulgence, which I doubt the critic will not so readily shew him. But however he may censure, I must ever think myself happy in having already acquired your Ladyship's good opinions. I am also flattered, as often as I think of the near resemblance my Heroine has of your Ladyship. Had I been earlier honoured with your Ladyship's acquain∣tance, I think I could have much enlarged the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
character. And yet there are many virtues, many delicacies, which it would have been impossible for me to have preserved in the picture, of which those only can be truly sensible, who have the happiness of being acquainted with the Original.</P>
<P>Please, Madam, to accept the following attempt, as an offering of my gratitude for many favours; an imperfect indeed, but honest proof, of the esteem, which is due from,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your LADYSHIP's
Most respectful, Most obliged, Humble Servant,
H. HARTSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE COUNTESS OF SALISBURY made her appearance about two years ago in Ireland, where she was received with very singular marks of favour; the Author there had many friends, and with all the partiality they might be supposed to have for him, those friends did not hesitate to declare, that the excellent performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry, contributed largely to the success of the Piece: written in his early youth, without having much know∣ledge of the stage, or dramatic performances, the Author is sensible what his Tragedy must be, notwithstanding the smiles with which it has been indulged. England, agree∣able to the character of good nature and gene∣rosity which it has established through all the world, has kindly followed the example of its sister nation, and received with an indul∣gence the attempt of a young Writer, who is indeed ambitious of pleasing, but dare not aspire to excellence. He attributes, in great measure, his good fortune now, to what his friends attributed it before, the animated performance of Mrs. Dancer and Mr. Barry: it is theirs to endeavour to support a reputation already gained, his to aim at improvement, in order to acquire one.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, SPOKEN BY Mr. WESTON, in the CHARACTER of a TEAGUE.</HEAD>
<L>MY jewels, I'm come to spake in the behalf—</L>
<L>Hoot, Devil burn you all, you makes me laugh,</L>
<L>Upon my soul now I don't take it well in you:</L>
<L>Arra, be easy, till I'm after telling you:</L>
<L>Smit with the love of glory and of pelf,</L>
<L>To night, a bard from Dublin its ownself,</L>
<L>Has brought a play here for your approbation,</L>
<L>A very pretty thing by my salvation—</L>
<L>If you'll trust Irish evidence I mean—</L>
<L>I can't the story very well explain;</L>
<L>But it's about a Countess and an Earl,</L>
<L>The Countess is a mighty honest girl;</L>
<L>But there's a villain with a damn'd cramp'd name,</L>
<L>Makes such proposhals—'tis a burning shame—</L>
<L>Another too—a Knight—bekeys as why—</L>
<L>But hould you know, you'll see it by and by,</L>
<L>And then 'tis time enough to tell the plot.</L>
<L>O, but that's true, I'd like to have forgot,</L>
<L>The dresses—'Pon my conscience in my days</L>
<L>I never saw their peer, they're all a blaze.</L>
<L>Then there's a child, the sweetest little rogue—</L>
<L>Only excuse a trifling spice of brogue—</L>
<L>He'll make you cry your eyes out, I'll be bound—</L>
<L>'Tis Ireland is the true poetic ground.</L>
<L>The Muses—Phoebus, heath'nish cant I loath!</L>
<L>What's Mount Parnassus to the Hill of Howth?</L>
<L>Or all the scenes each foolish poet paints—</L>
<L>O bub bub-boo! give me the Isle of Saints.</L>
<L>Turn up your noses, cavil now and carp—</L>
<L>Musha, I'm sure our emblem is the harp.</L>
<L>But stop, the bell rings. Fait they'll soon begin;</L>
<L>'Tis time for me to be a going in.</L>
<L>I take my lave then—but dear craters mind—</L>
<L>Pray to our Irish poetry be kind:</L>
<L>'Tis a new manufacture in effect—</L>
<L>And yours, my sowls t' encourage and protect;</L>
<L>No critic custom then exacted be,</L>
<L>Pass it like Irish linen, duty free.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. DANCER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THIS virgin author's such a blushing rogue—</L>
<L>What! no gay, lively, laughing epilogue!</L>
<L>"Madam (says he, and look'd so wise) in Greece"—</L>
<L>(Greece; that's their cant) "no jesting clos'd the piece.</L>
<L>"Play, epilogue and all were grave and solemn"—</L>
<L>Then, Sir, the town were fools that did not mawl 'em.</L>
<L>No—let your heroine, in this laughing age,</L>
<L>Come thus (as Bayes says) souse upon the stage;</L>
<L>Then with a jaunty air, half smile, half grin,</L>
<L>Curtsey quite round the boxes, and begin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A spark from court, and no one to detect him!</L>
<L>A pretty fellow too, and yet reject him!—</L>
<L>Now, Ladies, let me die but it was silly—</L>
<L>You'll not approve such horrid prudery—will ye?—</L>
<L>I shou'd have bless'd the occasion, and receiv'd him!</L>
<L>He shou'd have kneel'd and vow'd, and I—believ'd him;</L>
<L>Laugh'd, danc'd and sported it till spouse came over,</L>
<L>Then kiss'd my dear—while Betty hid my lover.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here again our Poet checks my flight,</L>
<L>"Nay, Madam, you mistake the matter quite.</L>
<L>"My heroine liv'd in ancient, honest times;</L>
<L>"Cards were unknown, and gallantries were crimes"—</L>
<L>'Psha! what if females then were seldom rovers?</L>
<L>Husbands—(aye, there's the cause) were warm as lovers.</L>
<L>Their warlike days indeed were spent in killing;</L>
<L>But then, at night—no turtles were so billing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well—tho' he gives me no smart things to say,</L>
<L>I wish this begging face may save his play:</L>
<L>The thing may mend, and learn to please you better—</L>
<L>Do then—nay, pray you shew him some good nature.</L>
