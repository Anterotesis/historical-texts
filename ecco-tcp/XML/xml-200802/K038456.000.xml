<HEAD>ISIS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR from her hallow'd grot, where mildly bright</L>
<L>The pointed crystals shot their trembling light,</L>
<L>From dripping moss where sparkling dew-drops fell,</L>
<L>Where coral glow'd, where twin'd the wreathed shell,</L>
<L>Pale <HI>Isis</HI> lay; a willow's lowly shade</L>
<L>Spread it's thin foliage o'er the pensive maid;</L>
<L>Clos'd was her eye, and from her heaving breast</L>
<L>In careless folds loose flow'd her zoneless vest;</L>
<L>While down her neck her vagrant tresses flow</L>
<L>In all the awful negligence of woe;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>Her urn sustain'd her arm, that sculptur'd vase</L>
<L>Where <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s art had lavish'd all it's grace;</L>
<L>Here, full with life was heav'n-taught Science seen,</L>
<L>Known by the laurel wreath and musing mein:</L>
<L>There cloud-crown'd Fame, here Peace sedate and bland,</L>
<L>Swell'd the loud trump, and wav'd the olive wand;</L>
<L>While solemn domes, arch'd shades, and vista's green</L>
<L>At well-mark'd distance close the sacred scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On this the Goddess cast an anxious look,</L>
<L>Then dropt a tender tear, and thus she spoke:</L>
<L>Yes, I cou'd once with pleas'd attention trace</L>
<L>The mimic charms of this prophetic vase;</L>
<L>Then lift my head, and with enraptur'd eyes</L>
<L>View on yon plain the real glories rise.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>Yes, <HI>Isis!</HI> oft hast thou rejoic'd to lead</L>
<L>Thy liquid treasures o'er yon fav'rite mead,</L>
<L>Oft hast thou stopt thy pearly car to gaze,</L>
<L>While ev'ry Science nurs'd it's growing bays;</L>
<L>While ev'ry Youth with fame's strong impulse fir'd,</L>
<L>Prest to the goal, and at the goal untir'd,</L>
<L>Snatch'd each celestial wreath to bind his brow</L>
<L>The Muses, Graces, Virtues cou'd bestow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E'en now fond Fancy leads th'ideal train,</L>
<L>And ranks her troops on Mem'ry's ample plain;</L>
<L>See! the firm leaders of my patriot line,</L>
<L>See! SIDNEY, RALEIGH, HAMDEN, SOMERS shine.</L>
<L>See HOUGH superior to a tyrant's doom</L>
<L>Smile at the menace of the slave of Rome.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>Each soul whom truth cou'd fire, or virtue move,</L>
<L>Each breast strong panting with it's country's love,</L>
<L>All that to <HI>Albion</HI> gave the heart or head,</L>
<L>That wisely councell'd, or that bravely bled,</L>
<L>All, all appear; on me they grateful smile,</L>
<L>The well-earn'd prize of every virtuous toil</L>
<L>To me with filial reverence they bring,</L>
<L>And hang fresh trophies o'er my honour'd spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! I remember well yon beachen spray,</L>
<L>There ADDISON first tun'd his polish'd lay;</L>
<L>'Twas there great <HI>Cato</HI>'s form first met his eye,</L>
<L>In all the pomp of free-born majesty.</L>
<L>"My Son, he cry'd, observe this mein with awe,</L>
<L>"In solemn lines the strong resemblance draw;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>"The piercing notes shall strike each <HI>British</HI> ear,</L>
<L>"Each <HI>British</HI> eye shall drop the patriot tear;</L>
<L>"And rous'd to glory by the nervous strain,</L>
<L>"Each Youth shall spurn at slav'ry's abject reign,</L>
<L>"Shall guard with <HI>Cato</HI>'s zeal <HI>Britannia</HI>'s laws,</L>
<L>"And speak, and act, and bleed, in freedom's cause."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hero spoke, the Bard assenting bow'd,</L>
<L>The lay to liberty and <HI>Cato</HI> flow'd;</L>
<L>While Echo, as she rov'd the vale along,</L>
<L>Join'd the strong cadence of his <HI>Roman</HI> song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! how Stillness slept upon the ground,</L>
<L>How mute Attention check'd each rising sound;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray,</L>
<L>Scarce trill'd sweet <HI>Philomel</HI> her softest lay,</L>
<L>When LOCKE walk'd musing forth; e'en now I view</L>
<L>Majestic Wisdom thron'd upon his brow,</L>
<L>View Candour smile upon his modest cheek,</L>
<L>And from his eye all Judgment's radiance break.</L>
<L>'Twas here the sage his manly zeal exprest,</L>
<L>Here stript vain Falshood of her gaudy vest;</L>
<L>Here Truth's collected beams first fill'd his mind,</L>
<L>E'er long to burst in blessings on mankind;</L>
<L>E'er long to show to reason's purged eye,</L>
<L>That "NATURE'S FIRST BEST GIFT WAS LIBERTY."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proud of this wond'rous son, sublime I stood,</L>
<L>(While louder surges swell'd my rapid flood)</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="10"/>Then vain as <HI>Niobe,</HI> exulting cry'd,</L>
<L><HI>Ilissus!</HI> roll thy fam'd <HI>Athenian</HI> tide;</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Plato</HI>'s steps oft mark'd thy neighb'ring glade,</L>
<L>Tho' fair <HI>Lycaeum</HI> lent it's awful shade,</L>
<L>Tho' ev'ry <HI>Academic</HI> green imprest</L>
<L>It's image full on thy reflecting breast,</L>
<L>Yet my pure stream shall boast as proud a name,</L>
<L>And <HI>Britain</HI>'s <HI>Isis</HI> flow with <HI>Attic</HI> fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! how chang'd! where now that <HI>Attic</HI> boast?</L>
<L>See! <HI>Gothic</HI> Licence rage o'er all my coast.</L>
<L>See! Hydra Faction spread it's impious reign,</L>
<L>Poison each breast, and madden ev'ry brain.</L>
<L>Hence frontless crouds that not content to fright</L>
<L>The blushing <HI>Cynthia</HI> from her throne of night,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>Blast the fair face of day; and madly bold,</L>
<L>To Freedom's foes infernal orgies hold;</L>
<L>To Freedom's foes, ah! see the goblet crown'd,</L>
<L>Hear plausive shouts to Freedom's foes resound;</L>
<L>The horrid notes my refluent waters daunt,</L>
<L>The Echoes groan, the Dryads quit their haunt;</L>
<L>Learning that once to all diffus'd her beam,</L>
<L>Now sheds by stealth a partial private gleam,</L>
<L>In some lone cloister's melancholy shade</L>
<L>Where a firm few support her sickly head;</L>
<L>Despis'd, insulted by the barb'rous train,</L>
<L>Who scour like <HI>Thracia</HI>'s moon-struck rout the plain,</L>
<L>Sworn foes like them to all the Muse approves,</L>
<L>All <HI>Phoebus</HI> favours, or <HI>Minerva</HI> loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
<L>Are these the sons my fost'ring breast must rear?</L>
<L>Grac'd with my name, and nurtur'd by my care,</L>
<L>Must these go forth from my maternal hand</L>
<L>To deal their insults thro' a peaceful land,</L>
<L>And boast while Freedom bleeds, and Virtue groans,</L>
<L>That "<HI>Isis</HI> taught Rebellion to her Sons?"</L>
<L>Forbid it heav'n! and let my rising waves</L>
<L>Indignant swell, and whelm the recreant slaves,</L>
<L>In <HI>England</HI>'s cause their patriot floods employ,</L>
<L>As <HI>Xanthus</HI> delug'd in the cause of <HI>Troy.</HI></L>
<L>Is this deny'd? then point some secret way</L>
<L>Where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray,</L>
<L>Some unknown channel lend where nature spreads</L>
<L>Inglorious vales and unfrequented meads,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13"/>There where a Hind scarce tunes his rustic strain,</L>
<L>Where scarce a Pilgrim treads the pathless plain</L>
<L>Content I'll flow; forget that e'er my tide</L>
<L>Saw yon majestie structures crown its side;</L>
<L>Forget that e'er my wrapt attention hung</L>
<L>Or on the Sage's or the Poet's tongue,</L>
<L>Calm and resign'd my humbler lot embrace,</L>
<L>And pleas'd prefer oblivion to disgrace.</L>
