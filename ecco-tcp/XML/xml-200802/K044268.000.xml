<HEAD>AN ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>I OFFER the following Comedy to the public, under a circumstance which has given my mind the most exquisite uneasiness. On the morning after the first representation, it was observed by the papers that there had been persons present at the Theatre the pre∣ceding evening, who went there <HI>determined</HI> to disapprove at all events. From such a de∣termination it is hard indeed to escape! And the opposition intended, was justified it seems, by the indecency of some of the expressions. —From such a charge I feel it impossible to defend myself; for against an imputation like this, even <HI>vindication</HI> becomes disgraceful!</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>As I was not at the Theatre, I should have had some difficulty in understanding at what passages the objections were levelled, had not one of the papers recorded them, with many cruel remarks. The particulars which were thus pointed out, will, I trust, be a sufficient apology for themselves. In the following pages they are <HI>all</HI> restored; that the public AT LARGE may have the power to adjudge me, as well as that small part of it, confined within the walls of a Theatre.</P>
<P>These passages have not been restored from any pertinacious opinion of their beauty— for other expressions might have conveyed my intention as well; but had I allowed one line to stand as altered for the stage, what might not that reprobated line have been supposed to express? I shrink from the idea! And therefore most solemnly aver, that the Comedy, as now printed, contains EVERY WORD which was opposed the first night, from the suspicion of indelicacy; hoping their <HI>obvious</HI> meaning only will be attended to, without the coarse ingenuity of strained explanations; which
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
have been made, by persons who seem desirous to surround my task of dramatic writing, with as many difficulties as possible.</P>
<P>A celebrated Critic, more attended to for the discrimination and learning which appear in his strictures, than for their <HI>lenity</HI>; in his observations on the Greybeards, has the fol∣lowing.</P>
<P><Q>When Mrs. Cowley gets possession of the spirit and turn of a character, she speaks the language of <HI>that</HI> character better than <HI>any</HI> of her dramatic cotemporaries.</Q></P>
<P>This, I confess, I hold to be very high praise; and it is to this very praise, which my cotemporaries resolve I shall have no claim. They will allow me, indeed, to draw strong character, but it must be without speaking its language. I may give vulgar o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> low bred persons, but they must converse in a stile of elegance. I may design the coariest manners, or the most disgusting folly, but its expressions must not deviate from the line of
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
politeness. Surely it would be as just to exact from the Artists who are painting the Gallery of Shakespeare, that they should compleat their designs without the use of light and shade.</P>
<P>It cannot be the <HI>Poet</HI>'s mind, which the public desire to trace, in dramatic representa∣tion; but the mind of the <HI>characters,</HI> and the truth of their colouring. Yet in my case it seems resolved that the point to be con∣sidered, is not whether that <HI>dotard,</HI> or that <HI>pretender,</HI> or that <HI>coquet,</HI> would so have given their feelings, but whether Mrs. <HI>Cowley</HI> ought so to have expressed herself.</P>
<P>This is a criterion which happily no author is subjected to, but those of the drama. The Novelist may use the boldest tints;— seizing Nature for her guide, she may dart through every rank of society, drag forth not only the accomplished, but the ignorant, the coarse, and the vulgar-rich; display them in their strongest colours, and snatch immor∣tality both for them, and for herself! I, on
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
the contrary, feel encompassed with chains when I write, which check me in my hap∣piest flights, and force me continually to re∣flect, not, whether <HI>this is just?</HI> but, whether <HI>this is safe?</HI></P>
<P>These are vain regrets, which I hope my readers will pardon me, for having a moment indulged. I now hasten to that part of the Comedy which will be found in the following sheets, as <HI>altered</HI> for the second representation.</P>
<P>The idea of the business which concerns Antonia, Henry, and Gasper was presented to me in an obsolete Comedy; the work of a poet of the drama, once highly celebrated. I say the <HI>idea,</HI> for when it is known that in the original the scene lay amongst traders in the city of London—and those traders of the lowest and most detestable manners, it will be conceived at once, that in removing it to Portugal, and fixing the characters amongst the nobility, it was hardly possible to carry with me <HI>more</HI> than the idea. The circum∣stance which most particularly interested me,
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
and fixed itself in my mind, was that of snatching a young woman from a hateful marriage, the moment before that marrige became valid—that is to say, after the cere∣mony. This very circumstance to which the Comedy owes its existence, was that, which some of the audience found discordant to their feelings. An event which had in the last century been stampt with the highest applause, (tho' surrounded by many repulsive circumstances) was found in this, to be ill∣conceived. I did not, however, dispute the decision of my Critics,—and the marriage has been in course dissolved.</P>
<P>The manner in which the Comedy has since been received, gives room to suppose that the alteration is approved. It has struggled with many oppressive circumstances: the chasm in the performance, occasioned by the repeated illness of Mr. Parsons, was sufficient to have sunk it;—but neither that, nor the sterile month of December, always <HI>against</HI> the Theatres, has prevented its being dis∣tinguished by many brilliant and crouded
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
nights. I now resign it to the closet, where without the aid of fine acting, or the fasci∣nations of beauty, and deriving all its little force from the pen which composed it, it hopes still to amuse;—the innocent flame of Seraphina's coquetry may still shed rays of delight on her readers, and the affecting situ∣ation of Antonia interest them.</P>

<L>PROLOGUES, like mirrors, which opticians place</L>
<L>In their shop windows, to reflect each face</L>

<L>Reflecting Ton in all her wild vagaries:</L>

<L>Nay, bolder grown, have sought for your applause,</L>
<L>With many a naughty joke on cork and gauze.</L>
<L>Yet howsoe'er the saucy comic muse</L>
<L>Delights fantastic fashion to abuse,</L>
<L>From pert Thalia's wit let's try to save her,</L>
<L>And see what can be said in fashion's favour.</L>
<L>How many own immortal Handel's sway,</L>
<L>Since fashion to the Abbey led the way!</L>
<L>There taking long neglected nature's part,</L>
<L>She hail'd him Shakespeare of th' harmonic art.</L>
<L>In vain had warbled Galatea's woe,</L>
<L>If fashion had not bid the tear to flow.</L>
<L>"Hailstones and fire" had spent their rage in vain;</L>
<L>You might as well have heard a shower of rain.</L>

<L>When Miss is teiz'd to sing by every guest;</L>
<L>And fond Mamma, too, joining with the rest,</L>
<L>Cries, "Get the new guittar Papa has bought you;</L>

<L>Miss hems and simpers—feigns a cold of course;</L>
<L>After the usual "Dear Sir, I'm so hoarse,"</L>

<L>Papa too, who a connoisseur now grows,</L>

<L>Since music is so universal grown,</L>
<L>Shall not our Mourning Bride its influence own?</L>
<L>Sure 'tis the wish of ev'ry female breast</L>

<P>Truly, Sir, I can't discover. I have question'd and cross question'd him to no purpose —he's as dexterous at shifting an answer, as tho' he was foster-brother to a lawyer.</P>

<P>Hah! Where is he?

No, bring him hither—bring him instantly! The brave unfortunate Don Henry! This hour will be to him, the heaviest of his life.

Welcome, Sir! the friend of Don Henry cannot find a house in Portugal, where he would be more joyfully received.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir! dare you thus receive the friend of a banish'd man?—of a man, who were he seen in Lisbon, would have his head claimed the next hour, by the executioner? If thus you can receive his friend, how will you receive himself?
<STAGE>(<HI>Throwing open his cloak.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my arms, and in my heart! I re— no, I do not rejoice. Oh Don Henry, what im∣prudence! How dare you venture hither before your pardon has been obtained?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could you suppose the intelligence of Antonia's marriage, would suffer me to rest in any other spot, that the proud sun visits? Had I been beneath the zone from whence he pours his broadest rays, or in the dusky regions of Cimmeria, such intelligence must have impell'd me hither!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to what purpose? Surely this is a sort of Quixotism, that must end, like the sub∣lime Knight's contention with the windmills.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I care not how it ends. The displeasure of my sovereign, and my heart torn by the in∣gratitude of the woman on whom it doats—the sooner the end approaches, the better!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not now to learn, how hard it is, to stem the torrent of your passions—yet if you would be patient, all might be well.—At least I trust so; tho' my visit to England, at that period, prevented my knowing precisely the ground of your quarrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quarrel!
<STAGE>(<HI>with contempt</HI>)</STAGE>
Do you then suspect it was <HI>a fray</HI> in which I fought; or that my sword is drawn in tavern brawls; or to sup∣port the insolence, or perfidy of an abandoned wanton? Duels of that sort, a soldier stoops not to!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then inform—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fought to punish the slanderer of him, who taught me <HI>how</HI> to fight—the brave D'Almeida; that once conquering hero!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew him well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas he first plac'd a sword upon my youthful thigh; and drawing forth the burnish'd blade, never my Henry, said the hoary general — "never be its lustre stain'd, except to serve your king, or vindicate your friend! These are the outlines of a soldier's duty;—would you be a perfect soldier? Labour to be an exemplary man!" with <HI>that</HI> sword—I thank it!
<STAGE>(<HI>holding his sword, and bending over it</HI>)</STAGE>
I punish'd <HI>his</HI> traducer!</P>

<P>But, whilst I wait for pardon in another kingdom, my Antonia's lost—oh!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is she not already lost?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, she is not—and by heaven she shall not! She's my contracted wife;—no power on earth can make her another's, whilst I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this, my friend, only proves the bit∣ter excess of your disappointment—have you any settled scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have.—At Madrid it chanc'd that Don Julio, nephew to old Gasper my rival, conceived a warm attachment for me.—From him I learnt the news of this abhorr'd marriage—the agonies it threw me in, he compassionated; and formed a scheme, which wears a face of success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas!—it is—well, but pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learning that my person was unknown to Don Gasper, whose retired life throws him out of all public circles, Julio conceived the resolution to make me pass for himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>You to pass for Don Gasper's nephew— well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>With this view he pretended an ardent desire to visit Portugal. His father has in course written to Don Gasper; we both arrived last night, and Julio has given me the letter, which will fix me in the house of my rival; to prevent, by what∣ever means that may offer themselves, the design upon my honour—the robbery of my wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear unhappy Henry, summon your fortitude whilst I tell you, that Don Julio's friend∣ship, united with your own temerity, cannot save your honour —if your honour is to be wounded by—
<STAGE>(<HI>shaking his head.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that? oh speak Sebastian—my apprehensions choak me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot give found to words so cruel— but fly, and save that life, which if you are dis∣covered here, must be forfeited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah—I understand you—she's married! she's married! Antonia is another's! Oh, Sebas∣tian — let me breathe!
<STAGE>(<HI>throwing himself on Sebastian.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Courage man! if you would but swear a little now, and give all the sex, black, brown, and yellow, to the devil, I should have some hopes of you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sebas.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no bearing this! a fine young fellow yielding himself to despair, at the very mo∣ment his perfidious mistress is giving herself to another! This very day she weds Don Gasper.</P>

<P>She is now in the house of your rival. According to the custom of our country, she this morning went there, attended by her bride-maids; and in the evening old Gasper receives her vows.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are mine!—in the face of heaven, and before witnesses they are mine;—if she has given them to another they cannot be valid, but by my assent. I'll fly instantly to the house—</P>

<P>Nay, suffer me to attend you; for tho' I have dear and tender cares of my own, I shall scarcely be awake to them, whilst my friend is in such danger!</P>

<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sebastian! the bliss or misery of all my years to come, must be determined be∣fore the approaching night hath told out half its hours. The enterprize is difficult — is full of danger! but what danger can be formidable to a wretch, who, precipitated on a gulph, must leap it, or be lost?

You should say d'ye see ma'am what a fine house you are mistress of?—d'ye see ma'am how many servants are at your command?—and this rich casket of jewels ma'am, which my master pre∣sents to you—how many ladies will envy you these jewels!—Did not her eyes sparkle when she found e'm on her toilet?</P>

My master is the most agreeablest man for an old—I mean a middle-aged gentleman—that was the word indeed, Sir! for a middle-aged gentle∣man in all the world.

<P>However, Sir, let her not despair—she may hope for the honour of being a <HI>grand</HI>-mother yet. I refused the daughter of Don Alexis, with∣out having seen her; but now that I have seen her, I think I could venture to exchange my dear prized liberty, for captivity with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don. Gasp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so my boy? Its the happiest news that I have heard. But where could you see her? for Don Alexis is so nicely jealous, that if his stone walls had eyes, he'd never suffer either his wise or daughter to unveil before them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octavio.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw her at church with her father. The sermon was on Christian charity, and to shew

how well she could illustrate the doctrine, she lifted her veil on that side next me—for she saw me hungering, and thirsting, for a view.</P>

<P>Hah! my own sister's son—my poor Olivia's boy, of whom she died in childbed. Let him come in.
<STAGE>(<HI>Don Henry introduced.</HI>)</STAGE>
My dear nephew, why I am as glad to see thee as if—how dost do? Grown up a man! dear, dear, how time slips! 'Twas but yesterday that your mother came out of the Convent to be married.—Like her

<P>Don Henriques was well, Sir, when I left Madrid—that letter will inform you of his wishes. Scarcely can I contain my feelings!

<P>Ay, very well—very well. Your father desires you may be receiv'd as my guest; and adds, that you are of a remarkable sober seri∣ous turn. I am glad of it Julio—never be wild my boy!

<P>Truly I think so, Signor, or I am not a bridemaid; but how far faithless I know not—for I return'd from Arragon last night, after more than a year's absence. We met but an hour since in the church, nor have we yet had time for conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I entreat you let this dis∣covery rest with yourself.—It is of the last im∣portance to me, that I should not be known to Don Gasper; and at present, I would be equally concealed from Antonia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must give me reasons for this request; for I am not certain that I ought not instantly to betray you. It is true, you have been her lover, but she is now to be the wife of Don Gasper;—her duties to him will be of the most sacred sort, and she must fulfil them scrupulously.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think me not a seducer! I have lov'd Antonia for her purity and virtue; and to destroy <HI>her</HI> honour, would be to trample on my own. Oh Clara! few have lov'd as I do. My passion is mingled with the tender protecting af∣fection of a brother; and violation is impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then tell me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall know all;—and should Antonia's marriage be voluntary, I will take no revenge but to leave her;—but if, as her melan∣choly allows me to hope, she has been deceiv'd into it, there's not a power on earth that can divide us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Donna Clara.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your design is not contrary to rectitude, be assured I shall not oppose it. Follow me to a more distant room—a new secret is almost as delightful as a new lover.

<P>COME along, my charming husband! Bless me, what eloquence and fire, considering you are fifty-nine!

One might mistake you for an English senator, instead of a Portugueze privy counsellor, you can say so much upon nothing.</P>

<P>Nothing! what is it nothing that when∣ever I go out of the door, your head is directly out of the window—like the sign of Queen Jezebel? 'Tis known to all the impudent young face-hunters in Lisbon, who saunter about my gates, like wolves before a sheep-fold—d'ye call that nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no; Heaven forbid I should be so ungrateful towards the grand pleasure of my life! Nothing! 'tis <HI>every thing</HI>—my happiness!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Listen, Deary! and I'll bless ye with a secret. Blind your windows, and nail your doors, but if your honour
<STAGE>(<HI>curtseying</HI>)</STAGE>
has no better se∣curity than these, you'll be soon in the herd, whose ideal ornaments

<P>The devil's in it if stone walls won't keep ye! What stronger security could my honour have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>My</HI> honour! Rely on that, and I swear to you by every thing sacred, that no vestal's life shall be more blameless. It is due to my own feelings to be chaste—I don't condescend to think of yours in the affair. The respect I bear myself, makes me necessarily preserve my purity—but if I am suspected, watch'd, and haunted, I know not but such torment may weary me out of prin∣ciples, which I have hitherto cherish'd as my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alex.</SPEAKER>
<P>If all this is true, what the devil makes ye so fond of admiration?</P>

<P>I can't tell what devil makes me so fond of admiration; but I know I love admiration, and I will have it; till he, whom you represent, says no.</P>

<SPEAKER>Alex.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whom I represent! who's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy! who can it be, but old, shrivell'd, grey-pated Time? To <HI>his</HI> negative I shall yield— but with a very ill will, I assure you. If the passion we have for admiration is wrong, let nature look to it—'twas she impress'd it on our hearts;
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
and it is <HI>her</HI> law, that to tyrannize over the peace of man, is to woman consummation of happiness!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Alex.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you every one of ye pretend to be tender-hearted, and compassionate, and all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to say truth, one is a sort of a paradox. At a tale of woe, I melt like Niobe; and am agoniz'd at distress, if I cannot relieve it; —yet a lover's misery is delightful! I would not abate a man who adored me a single sigh; and should have no rest at night, if I thought he was sleeping quietly.</P>

<P>That's not what I intend. I would have you sigh under them—aye, in downright earnest too.</P>

<P>It is impossible for me to sigh in earnest, unless you tell me the hopes Don Alexis has given me, make <HI>you</HI> sigh in earnest.</P>

<P>What were those hopes, I pray?</P>

<P>By all the tempting witch'ries of your face, and the soft Cupids in your graceful air, 'tis true!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>So pretty an oath deserves a civil reply, and I therefore protest to you, the moment Don Alexis consents to my being yours, I'll yield you my hand without reluctance. But after this frank engagement, Don Octavio, I expect you to leave me for the present—I have a peculiar reason to request this favour. Some one will come in a moment, and spoil my roguery.

<P>At the gate in the evening! How sweetly that would sound, if the little villain had not ma∣trimony in her head. Well, if I must be a slave at some time in my life, e'en let it be now—a desperate action should be done as soon as resolved on.

<P>Ha, ha, ha, my dear Viola, this is a web of my weaving—how I shall puzzle thro' it, I know not. And your poor father—ha, ha, ha, how you stare! be pleas'd to know then that I have just been receiving the most violent love in the name of your ladyship—actually personating you!</P>

<P>Your father went out this morning, my dear, and either begg'd, borrow'd, or stole a lover for ye.—The poor youth was introduced to my apartment—took it for granted that I was Viola; and begun (as I suppose he promis'd your father he would) to adore, and die for me, in very good form.</P>

<P>Yes, yes—now you have the nut—shall we crack it, or throw it away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us get at the kernel. If you can contrive to keep my father in the dark some little time, it will allow me to concert measures

with Don Sebastian. You do him the honour to approve his addresses, I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, if you can make any thing of the incident, it is quite at your service. I'll listen to Octavio's love-tales with all the condescension imaginable; and let him adore me, for a month to come, if it will be of use to you and Sebastian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>How very grateful he will be!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let us go then and settle matters. We must take Carlota into our council, or the thing can't go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viola.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father has discharged her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, I'll manage that. It would be hard, indeed, to marry an old man, and not make him do as one likes. Young husbands we are content to submit to, but when we marry GREY∣BEARDS, it is with the pious design to have our way in every thing.

<P>Too much! ay, so it is, that they should be all so blind to your starts, your angry blushes, and your ill conceal'd confusion.

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is more than I can bear—the old dotard's fondness, which I dare not yet oppose, distracts me! Oh that I could speak to her alone! —'tis plain amidst all the bridal gaiety her heart is not at ease.</P>

<P>Possible, why I <HI>did</HI> it—I did it. And where's the harm? A banish'd man is a dead man

Well, my dear boy, I am come on purpose to ask how you manag'd to-day with my daughter. The young slut is so mealy-mouth'd, I could get no∣thing out of her. Was she kind—did she shew a proper sense of the favour?</P>

<P>Her vivacity renders a stupid, formal, <HI>allow'd</HI> courtship, intolerable to her. If you persist in countenancing my addresses she will hate me; but if you order her to see me no more, and allow me to steal her out of a window, or

My dear Don Gasper, my friend, my worthy friend, I entreat—Zounds! he's gone! If it had not been for his choak-pear about Octavio, how I could laugh. Why, what the plague did that impertinent Don Julio take such a liberty with my ring for? how dared he haul me head and ears into his scheme, to laugh at his worthy uncle? But zooks it is a good laugh
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
after all — ha, ha, ha—but if Gasper now, thro' spite, should prevent Octavio's marriage! What's to be done? hang me if I go to bed to night— I'll find out Octavio wherever he is, make him steal my daughter, conclude the marriage, and then I'll laugh with Julio, 'till my old sides crack.

<P>Pardon me, Sir! no woman can be alone, nor in the power of any man, whilst she respects herself, and is guarded by a sense of her duty. You see, Don Alexis, what benefits arise from plotting <HI>without</HI> a woman. Ha, ha, ha.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seraph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come Don Gasper, let me advise you to think your loss a gain—you see in your humble servant, what mischievous creatures young wives are;—she'd plague your heart out, as I do my old husband's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alex.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith she says true. A minute ago I thought the laugh on my side; but 'tis still on your own. You have lost a young wife, and I have found one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gasp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to say truth, if it were not that at present I feel a little aukward, and don't know very well which way to look.—As to your con∣tract I might perhaps dispute its powers, but as here is a stroke or two of mine, which may be, I shan't be sorry to have drop'd, e'en go to church i'gad's name; and when ye come home beware of plots and scal rings!</P>

<P>This is generous! The sentiments you profess'd for me I see will be converted to a more decent regard, and we shall all be united in the bands of charming friendship.</P>

<P>Gad this looks like a sort of general amnesty—so let the frolick go round! But dare my faults hope forgiveness here?

Yes;—I am on this spot an old offender; and have so often gratefully experienced the candour of my judges, that I trust now to meet their par∣don — and invoke the gracious sign!</P>

<L>A Mourning Bride!—that wou'd be something new—</L>
<L>(That I'm a Mourning Husband is too true,</L>
<L>Cries old Sir Testy in his gouty chair,)</L>
<L>"Ah could I wedlock's fatal slip repair!</L>
<L>"But young wives are a sort of flying gout,</L>
<L>"Torments for which no cure was e'er found out;</L>
<L>"Both old men's plagues, to punish youthful tricks,</L>
<L>"Equally difficult, I fear, to fix.</L>
<L>"Of wife and gout alike I stand in dread,</L>
<L>"For both, alas! sometimes affect the head."</L>
<L>Thus rail old cynics, striving to disparage</L>
<L>The charming silken ties of modern marriage.</L>
<L>In former times, when folks agreed to wed,</L>
<L>The silent bride by silent bridegroom led,</L>
<L>Up to the altar march'd in solemn state,</L>
<L>All was demure, and stupidly sedate.</L>
<L>Impress'd with awe, while neither dar'd to speak,</L>
<L>A wedding was a mere Ballet Tragique.</L>
<L>Thank Heav'n we're past the ages of romance;</L>
<L>Wedlock is now a kind of country dance,</L>
<L>Where man and wife with smiles each other greet,</L>
<L>Take hands, change sides, and part as soon as meet;</L>
<L>Pleasure's soft accents ev'ry care dispel,</L>
<L>While Hymen fiddles Vive la Bagatelle.</L>
<L>Blest age! when ceremony's chains are worn,</L>
<L>Like bracelets, not to setter, but adorn.</L>
<L>When we assume deep mourning's fable shew,</L>
<L>'Tis etiquette prescribes the form of woe:</L>
<L>Whate'er our loss, we must have fashion's leave,</L>
<L>Ere we can venture decently to grieve.</L>
<L><PB REF="87"/>Blameless the heir o'er the dear parchment chuckles,</L>
<L>If he's unpowder'd, and puts on black buckles,</L>
<L>Till the grey frock speaks his first anguish o'er,</L>
<L>And he's but half as wretched as before.</L>
<L>Ere the gay widow first abroad is seen,</L>
<L>Deck'd in exhilarating bombazeen,</L>
<L>While the dear Col'nel visits unsuspected,</L>
<L>And she's as well as could have been expected;</L>
<L>Custom's indulgence wisely does she borrow,</L>
<L>In cards of compliments exhausts her sorrow;</L>
<L>Of tears her black-edg'd paper fills the place,</L>
<L>Mourns as her proxy, and preserves her face.</L>
<L>Our Mourning Bride, who with no sorrow labours,</L>
<L>And mourns but in <HI>appearance,</HI> like her neighbours,</L>
<L>Tho' forc'd by etiquette, good humour loves, as well as any here,</L>
<L>Blest in the fate which these kind smiles decree her,</L>
<L>She hopes her friends will often come to see her.</L>
