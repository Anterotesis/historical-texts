<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEREE'ER Mankind to sacred freedom just,</L>
<L>Have soar'd above the groveling Sons of dust,</L>
<L>Wheree'er the Arts their fragrant wreathes have wove,</L>
<L>Wheree'er the virtues leagued with Patriot love,</L>
<L>And bright-eyed Science shed her heavenly dews,</L>
<L>There public taste hath nursed the Tragic Muse.</L>
<L>And Reason to her generous care consign'd,</L>
<L>The noblest, best emotions of the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis her's where human institutes are weak,</L>
<L>With firm, unbiast emphasis to speak.</L>
<L>With genuine nature link persuasive art,</L>
<L>And bind in magic ties the willing heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She gives to view the Tyrant's naked breast,</L>
<L>What guilt disturbs him, and what fears insest.</L>
<L>She with abhorrence marks the Traitor's name,</L>
<L>And cloaths Ambition in the robes of Shame.</L>
<L>Depresses Cruelty; and rears on high</L>
<L>The standard of Imperial liberty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is Innocence by rigour stern subdued?</L>
<L>She steels her soul with conscious fortitude.</L>
<L>Bids her above this fordid earth to rise,</L>
<L>And claim alliance with her native skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who then, by partial error led astray,</L>
<L>With hasty censure brands the Tragic lay?</L>
<L>The glorious strains which polish'd Athens taught,</L>
<L>Refining and exalting human thought?</L>
<L>When Sages praised the Poet's moral pen?</L>
<L>And listening Heroes felt that they were Men?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What true desert is their's, at Virtue's call,</L>
<L>Who make th' obedient passions rise or fall!</L>
<L>Who in her Temple bid Mankind appear,</L>
<L>Breathe the warm sigh, and drop the hallow'd tear!</L>
<L>For when by idcot laughter unpossest,</L>
<L>She, gentle Goddess, seeks the soften'd breast.</L>
<L>From grief itself a nameless pleasure flows,</L>
<L>And pity loves to melt at fancied woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not through Antiquity's obscurer ways,</L>
<L>To climes remote our British Author strays,</L>
<L>Not from th' Italian, or the French translates,</L>
<L>Alters old plots, or even imitates.</L>
<L>From your own Annals he his story draws,</L>
<L>Tradition long hath crown'd it with applause.</L>
<L>When the fierce Danes their barbarous inroads plann'd,</L>
<L>And pour'd destruction o'er each harrast land.</L>
<L>When they besieged these Walls, and hoped to win,</L>
<L>Nor knew superior valour dwelt within:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>Till the bold Citizens assail'd their Host,</L>
<L>And drove th' insulting Miscreants from their Coast,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, for their Country, dared your Sires to bleed;</L>
<L>Nor have their Sons disgraced the gallant deed.</L>
<L>Courageous now, as when they quell'd the Dane,</L>
<L>Still faithful, loyal, generous, and humane.</L>

<L>SHALL not this City fall beneath my power?</L>
<L>What magic buckler guards it? To my arms,</L>
<L>The puny Offspring of this sea-girt land</L>
<L>Have yielded wheresoe'er I fought. My ships</L>
<L>Beneath their treasures bend. The ravaged coast,</L>
<L>Hence, to the farthest Orcades, laments</L>

<L>What say'st thou Englishman! Our first assault</L>
<L>Hath proved in vain, will they withstand another?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>No doubt they will. In native courage bold,</L>
<L>The warlike Sons of Isca ne'er will droop</L>
<L>By sudden fear o'ercome. To conquer them,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="6"/>Patience, with ardent valour must be joined,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>I told thee true.</L>
<L>But who, within these confines, is a stranger</L>
<L>To the Damnonian fame? Their worth in arms</L>
<L>Even their foes confess. Before these walls</L>
<L>For two long tedious months did Sweno mourn,</L>
<L>Illustrious Monarch, and with shame and rage</L>
<L>Beheld his blasted laurels. Nor at length,</L>
<L>But by a Norman traitor gain'd the place,</L>
<L>Ignobly gain'd it. Why, O ill-advised,</L>
<L>Would'st thou sit down before it?</L>

<SPEAKER>VOLNIR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Brithric, hold!</L>
<L>No more with thy ill-omen'd notes presume</L>
<L>T' infest my ear. Hast thou forgot, old man,</L>
<L>When first I saw thee in thy boarded ship,</L>
<L>The sad survivor of thy vanquish'd crew,</L>
<L>Cover'd with wounds? When I preserv'd thy life,</L>
<L>And made my foe my friend? For Volnir ne'er</L>

<L>Thou hast forgot it; else why interpose</L>
<L>These frigid cautions? Hast thou e'er with arm</L>

<L>The tide of war against the Anglian shore?</L>
<L>Now, by my sword I swear, when I have gain'd</L>
<L>Some glorious victory, these eyes have seen</L>

<L>And say, could'st thou</L>

<L>In other realms thou hast not seen these feet</L>
<L>Behind thee linger; my victorious arm</L>
<L>Gothland hath witness'd, and the Frank, the Scot</L>
<L>Oft fled before the lightning of my spear.</L>
<L>These were my enemies as well as thine.</L>
<L>But can a private tye, e'en gratitude</L>

<L>Thou best can'st answer? Would'st thou have permitted</L>

<L>Thou know'st, tho' pleased, the more enlighten'd manners,</L>

<L>By my instructions taught, t' exalt me high</L>
<L>Amid thy Warriors, Conqueror as thou art,</L>
<L>Thou know'st I have not willingly forsaken</L>
<L>Those I held dear. I left my soul's best portion,</L>
<L>A valued Wife; a young and growing Daughter,</L>
<L>An infant Son I left. Could I forget</L>
<L>In splendid slavery these tender names?</L>
<L>For life I am thy Debtor, and have serv'd</L>
<L>In other wars most faithfully. But still</L>

<L>Welcome brave Rodolph! Hast thou well explor'd</L>
<L>The country toward the North?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have. No foe</L>
<L>Dares stand against us, terror-struck they fly,</L>
<L>And leave to us their numerous herds and flocks.</L>
<L>I traced yon winding stream for many a mile,</L>
<L>Through it's luxuriant vale, fit haunt for Gods.</L>
<L>Unlike our blasted heaths, here Plenty dwells,</L>
<L>Clad in her richest robes. Could we possess</L>
<L>The City, with this scene before our view,</L>
<L>Here might we fix our home, and each nerve strung</L>
<L>With double vigour, brave the utmost force</L>
<L>Of the whole adverse Isle. A region this,</L>
<L>Worthy of none but Denmark's valiant race.</L>
<L>Bear off these Prisoners. To my Tent conduct</L>
<L>This trembling fair One. Fear not, gentle Damsel,</L>
<L>Rodolph is thy Protector.</L>

<SPEAKER>VOLNIR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mark'd you the Virgin?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>I observed her well.</L>
<L>Her modesty, her air above the vulgar,</L>
<L>Her unaffected, silent look of woe,</L>
<L>With strange emotions fill'd my heart. I pity her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLNIR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her fate is to be envied. Rodolph's valour</L>
<L>Deserves the fairest. Where can beauty feel</L>
<L>True pleasure, but when clasp'd in the embrace</L>
<L>Of the intrepid warrior?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tender mourner!</L>
<L>Who knows her grief! Her sad anxiety!</L>
<L>Torn from her Friends! Perhaps an aged Father</L>
<L>Now beats his breast, and curses in despair,</L>
<L>The cruel hand of Fate. A frantic Mother</L>
<L>Perhaps now breathes her last, in anguish wild,</L>
<L>Calling in vain upon her much-loved Daughter.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLNIR.</SPEAKER>
<L>I blush to hear this weakness; glad am I</L>
<L>None of my noble Danes are witnesses</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="12"/>To this thy folly; but if thou regard'st</L>
<L>My anger, dare not with inglorious wailings</L>
<L>Disgrace my camp. War is no school of pity.</L>
<L>Nor would I, that the spirits of my followers,</L>
<L>Rough and invincible, be e'er degraded</L>
<L>To the soft failings of the silken Crew,</L>
<L>O'er whom they triumph. Why is strength imparted,</L>
<L>Why the heroic soul, but from the base</L>
<L>Unmanly grasp of cowards, those possessions</L>
<L>They merit not to wrest? Riches and beauty,</L>
<L>The harvest of their labours?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is it then</L>
<L>Denied to feel for the afflicted?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VOLNIR.</SPEAKER>
<L>No;</L>

<L>Thy nature's frailty; feed on grief in secret.</L>

<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>O curse! to bear a mind whence sweet humanity</L>
<L>By barbarous custom is exiled! To know</L>
<L>No virtue, but ferocious brutal courage!</L>
<L>Yet is this Chief superior to his race;</L>
<L>And education which hath steel'd his soul</L>
<L>To gentle pity, hath not quite erased</L>
<L>The native sense of rectitude. He spared</L>
<L>My life; and loved a valour like his own.—</L>
<L>The thoughts of this poor Virgin still distress me,</L>
<L>Such is my Daughter's age.—But she's far distant.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="13"/>It cannot be.—And yet her Mother's features</L>
<L>Rose to my mind.—'Tis but the sport of fancy.—</L>
<L>Oh! could I but once more behold my Children,</L>
<L>I then could die in peace.—But who can tell</L>
<L>Whether some other band of these invaders</L>
<L>May not have slain, or hurried them away</L>
<L>To sad captivity? Perhaps I mourn</L>
<L>The absence of the dead; or dead to me,</L>
<L>Who never must behold them; doom'd to waste</L>
<L>My days in misery, and die a slave.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hast thou so soon left thy fair Prisoner?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RODOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>New to misfortune is the Maid; her sorrow</L>
<L>Resists all arguments; persuasion fails;</L>
<L>Nor will she hear a word of soothing comfort.</L>
<L>She will be calm anon. These warmer passions</L>
<L>Soonest abate. Yet, 'twas a scene of terror</L>
<L>From whence I snatch'd her; for the foolish crew</L>
<L>Their gates had barricadoed, which provoked</L>
<L>My gallant band to deeds of vengeance. All</L>
<L>But she, and one, whom at a postern door</L>
<L>A youth bore off upon his rapid steed,</L>
<L>Fell victims to the keen relentless sword.</L>

<L>Would'st thou,</L>

<L>Hah! dost thou know</L>
<L>What 'tis thou ask'st?</L>

<L>I do. Thou would'st be willing</L>

<SPEAKER>RODOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I would.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRITHRIC.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis for that purpose</L>
<L>I ask an interview. I am her Countryman,</L>
<L>And should I to her ear unfold thy worth,</L>
<L>Thy excellence above the other Chiefs;</L>
<L>Make her of that good fortune sensible,</L>
<L>Which, 'mid her depth of woe, to thy possession</L>
<L>Devoted her; may not her mind be moved,</L>
<L>Sooth'd by the cheering speech of honest age,</L>
<L>And cast anxiety aside?</L>

<L>I'll trust thee.</L>
<L>Thy snowy head proclaims, that in thy breast</L>
<L>The flame of warm desire's long since extinct.</L>
<L>Go Brithric. I would bend her to my wishes,</L>
<L>But not reluctantly. The sickly appetite</L>
<L>Of impotence may provocation need</L>
<L>In cold resistance, but my glowing soul</L>
<L>Seeks equal passion, and the yielding fair</L>
<L>To bless, must covet blessing.—Hence, away!</L>

<L>Returning. <STAGE>(<HI>Enter</HI> Albert.)</STAGE> Oh! my Friend! let me embrace thee.</L>
<L>My Editha is safe—And I have found</L>

<L>Him too from hapless slavery have we rescued.</L>

<L>Brave Albert! Second Son! whose patriot virtues</L>

<L>Fill my old heart with warm affection 'tward thee,</L>

<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<L>How sweet</L>
<L>Are the applauses of the wise and good!</L>
<L>My heart acknowledges the warmth of thine,</L>
<L>And every string accordant vibrates here.—</L>
<L>O Editha! Thou little think'st what pleasure</L>
<L>I feel in thy deliverance: not more</L>
<L>Thy Brother, or thy Father feels.</L>

<SPEAKER>EDITHA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The thanks</L>

<L>To yonder heights they fled.</L>
<L>There were they rallied by their Chief again,</L>
<L>Who bravely fought. All that a Leader could,</L>
<L>To turn the desperate fortune of the day,</L>
<L>He did. At length, when all was lost, he join'd</L>
<L>His flying bands, who now in wild dismay</L>
<L>Haste to their ships; our victory's compleat.</L>
<L>But say my Friend, the treacherous Gunhilda,</L>
<L>Hast thou not found her in the Camp?</L>

<L>She lies</L>
<L>Dead in this tent, slain by mistake for her.</L>

<L>Now let us hence!</L>
<L>This accident shall be to thee explain'd.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERT.</SPEAKER>
<L>But first 'twere fit,</L>

<L>Would'st thou punish him?</L>

<L>Doth he not merit punishment?</L>

<L>He doth.</L>
<L>And can he feel a greater, than to view</L>
<L>His murder'd Child? Could cunning cruelty</L>
<L>Devise one more severe?—Oh! Editha!</L>
<L>The tortures of the rack were light to this:</L>
<L>Well know I what a Father must endure.</L>
<L>To think too that she fell by his contrivance!</L>
<L>No, gallant Albert, seek no other vengeance.</L>
<L>Permit him to retreat, oppress'd with sorrow,</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="90"/>And stung with conscious guilt. While we reflect</L>
<L>With pleasure on the difference of our souls,</L>
<L>Which bear no sordid stains. While we rejoice,</L>
<L>Raised from calamity and woe, to bliss.</L>
<L>While we congratulate our ransom'd Country,</L>
<L>And as we offer up our thanks to Heaven,</L>
<L>Pray, that she ever thus may stand secure</L>
<L>From foreign arms, and from domestic treason.</L>
<L>Free, glorious, happy, to remotest ages.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NO longer now in pomp of grief array'd,</L>
<L>No longer Editha, the Captive Maid;</L>
<L>Prepared t' examine this same Tragic story,</L>
<L>In my own person I advance before ye.</L>
<L>My critic art at least this once to try,</L>
<L>And scan our Bard's defects with nicest eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet some apology th' attempt may need—</L>
<L>But by your looks embolden'd, I'll proceed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who, without terror, Rodolph's fury traces?</L>
<L>Why, tho' a Dane, was he refused the Graces?</L>
<L>Were such the manners of those Northern Climes?</L>
<L>Why not have bent them to our gentler times?</L>
<L>To seek his Mistress' life!—So desperate grown!—</L>
<L>He should have rather fled, and saved his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Surely <HI>that</HI> Albert might have spoke more plain.</L>
<L>The City's Praefect—but my dying Swain.</L>
<L>Why had he not some crafty scheme devised?</L>
<L>And ventured 'mid the Danish camp disguised?</L>
<L>He should have crept, or swam, or fought, or strove,</L>
<L>And hazarded his trust—to gain his Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' affection of a Brother!—How misplaced!</L>
<L>And what a violence to modern Taste!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A soul defying death! and accents Roman!</L>
<L>How could <HI>they</HI> suit with any British Woman!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The simple, and the natural!—How stupid!</L>
<L>I should have ransack'd all the stores of Cupid.</L>
<L>Hopes, fears, doubts, jealousies, and warm desires,</L>
<L>Darts, arrows, daggers, poison'd bowls, and fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are to a Tragic Piece my powers decreed?</L>
<L>Let it be great and Tragical indeed.</L>
<L>Let Passion cease the guiding rein t' obey,</L>
<L>Let Grief be strain'd to its sublimest key,</L>
<L>In frantic fury let me curse the light,</L>
<L>And die enchantingly, with all my might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But egotisms and irony apart—</L>
<L>Say, have our Author's numbers touch'd the heart?</L>
<L>Have they from Pity stole th' ingenuous sigh?</L>
<L>And raised the trembling tear in Virtue's eye?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is th' unerring comment; this the test—</L>
<L>And all remarks besides—like mine—a jest.</L>
