<SPEAKER>Sturmwald.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so to you, Signor Tho∣maso, who slumber in the inglorious lap of peace—but war is my element; glory is my mistress; and I have courted her amid the cannon's thunder.</P>

<P>Many men of many minds, Captain; for my part, I always prefered a more quiet kind of courtship; but i'faith you are a man of true gallantry to remain so partial to your mistress, after having lost the use of a leg and an eye in her service.</P>

<P>Ah, very true, Captain. He is a most provoking man, tho' he is my husband. For shame, after our good friend, Captain Sturmwald, has come all the way from Ger∣many to marry our daughter Anna.</P>

<P>Nay, I'm sure, <HI REND="margDblQuotes">the Captain knows,</HI> I mean no harm.—Anna, come hi∣ther, child <STAGE>(aside to Anna.)</STAGE> Why don't you smile upon your husband that is to be?</P>

<P> Psha! how can you be so obstinate!—though the Captain is not very handsome, he is very rich.

<P>Anna's reluctance is certainly owing to that impertinent slut, her cousin. I'm sure she doet not inherit her obstinacy from me. When my mother proposed a husband to me, I gave my consent without a moment's hesitation. Didn't I, my dear?</P>
