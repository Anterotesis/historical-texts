<P>LUCIUS JUNIUS BRUTUS; OR, THE EXPULSION OF THE TARQUINS: AN HISTORICAL PLAY.</P>
<P>BY HUGH DOWNMAN.</P>
<Q><HI>—Manus haec inimica Tyrannis.</HI></Q>
<P>LONDON: PRINTED FOR J. WILKIE, NO. 71, ST. PAUL'S-CHURCH-YARD; FIELDING AND WALKER, PATER-NOSTER-ROW; G. KEARS∣LEY, FLEET-STREET; P. ELSMLEY, STRAND; W. DAVIS, PICCADILLY. MDCCLXXIX.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>Tthose who judge of dramatic merit from the Greek models, the rules of French critics, or the examples of modern writers, a justifica∣tion of the following piece would be attempted in vain. They would call it a motley perfor∣mance, deficient in almost every article, which constitutes a true and proper tragedy. If the author was to alledge, that he never meant to compose a tragedy, according to their accep∣tation of the word, but that his intention was to fill up a picture of real life, in a certain given time, the outlines of which were taken from historical facts, his reason would be deemed un∣satisfactory.</P>
<P>Regardless of the end proposed, they would continue to exclaim, that the unities were neg∣lected, that the grave was intermingled with the ludicrous; that the business of the drama frequently stood still; that the dialogue was too familiar, and the metre little better than mea∣sured prose.</P>
<P>How far some of these objections may be valid, and how many more might, perhaps, with
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
reason be urged against particular passages, the author would not determine. The force of others of them he would endeavour to dimi∣nish, by answering, that they militate equally against human life itself; and that while he should be sorry to have this denominated an ar∣tificial poem, he would flatter himself, it cannot be justly thought an unnatural one.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson indeed, in the preface to his edi∣tion of Shakespeare, seems to have sufficiently vindicated this particular species of writing, to which, those who please, may (instead of tra∣gedy) give the more simple name of history. Neither are there wanting many good judges of composition, who wish that the less studied diction, and more plain and level metre of the school of that immortal poet, (which seems to have ended with Southern) had been conti∣nued to the present time. Even this perfor∣mance, with all its imputed irregularities and deficiencies, will, perhaps, be preferred by them, to those translated tragedies or imitations, which of late years have, through novelty, lived their nine nights on the stage, and been damned for ever after in the closet: tho' they had been cor∣rected and metamorphosed by managers, calcu∣lated to afford to favourite actors or actresses op∣portunities of shining, and curtailed by lord chamberlains.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
A diversification of characters hath been at∣tempted in this piece; and to give to every cha∣racter the mode of sentiment and expression, peculiarly suited to it. It is not at all difficult for a man of a very middling genius, to contrive a regular plot, to pen down a certain number of sounding lines; and though his Dramatis Per∣sonae are distinguished by particular names, to put his own sentiments in their mouths through∣out five acts. Had the author been solicitous of adapting his plan to the stage, or wished to conciliate the favour of the indiscriminating multitude, he might probably have followed the same method.</P>
<P>However it may appear to us, when we are reading, no small attention is requisite in writ∣ten dialogue of any kind, for an author entirely to cast off self. This was the characteristic of Shakespeare; and perhaps after all, the author of this play hath deceived himself, and it may with reason be applied to him.</P>

<L>YES, we may weep the ruin of our country,</L>
<L>And so must all good men; but there's no remedy;</L>
<L>The evil is too rank t' admit a cure.</L>
<L>Oppression wide hath spread her bane, and tainted</L>
<L>The universal air; scarce are our souls</L>
<L>Our own, much less our words. The secret curse</L>
<L>Is frequent, offer'd up to all the gods</L>
<L>The midnight silent deprecation calls</L>
<L>For vengeance on the proud, the imperious Tarquin.</L>
<L>But in the day each wears the face of loyalty,</L>
<L>Nor dares, so jealous are these groveling times,</L>
<L>E'en in his brother's bosom pour the secret</L>
<L>Which ulcerating preys upon his heart.</L>
<L>How we two thus have dared communicate</L>
<L>Our thoughts either to other, is to me</L>
<L>Most strange and passing marvel.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Had I not known thee long, thou noblest Roman,</L>
<L>Amid these worst of times immoveable</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
In honour's steady course, invariably</L>
<L>Upright and just, in thy domestic life</L>
<L>Untainted too, I would not thus have open'd</L>
<L>My inmost breast, or given the passing wind</L>
<L>An opportunity to bear my words</L>
<L>On its licentious wing to th' tyrant's ear.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>A mutual confidence henceforth be ours.</L>
<L>Scarcely can I express with what abhorrence</L>
<L>I look upon this monster of a man.</L>
<L>Scan the whole catalogue of horrid crimes,</L>
<L>And if you find one he hath not committed,</L>
<L>I will retract my words, and call him virtuous.</L>
<L>His brother first he poison'd, to possess</L>
<L>His wife; to gain the crown, assassinated</L>
<L>Most ruffian like, the good old king, by marriage</L>
<L>His father: I beheld the elder thrown</L>
<L>Down from the senate-house, his aged limbs</L>
<L>Bruised by the flinty pavement, his white locks</L>
<L>Which from the lawless robber would have gain'd</L>
<L>Respect and veneration, wildly scatter'd</L>
<L>Over his sace, defiled with clotted gore;</L>
<L>Raised from the ground with utmost difficulty,</L>
<L>And tottering t'ward his home, he met his death.</L>
<L>Still did insatiate cruelty pursue</L>
<L>His breathless corse, denied the common rites</L>
<L>Of burial; all men struck with horror, shunn'd</L>
<L>Th' accursed spot: yet then his savage wife</L>
<L>Drunk with hot draughts of empire, or possess'd</L>
<L>By the infernal furies, every tie</L>
<L>Of human nature cast aside, drove on</L>
<L>High in her stately chariot, and impell'd</L>
<L>Th' affrighted horses o'er him where he lay,</L>
<L>O'er the dead body of her murder'd father.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Had I been told the fact, as perpetrated</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
In any foreign country, my belief</L>
<L>Would have rebell'd. I wonder that the sun</L>
<L>Turn'd not his course, as at th' inhuman feast</L>
<L>Of Grecian Atreus: ever to reflection</L>
<L>As the deed rises in its native hue,</L>
<L>My blood runs cold. No wonder if his throne</L>
<L>Founded by means like these. should be supported</L>
<L>By the same means. Hence in what copious streams</L>
<L>Hath flow'd the blood of princely senators!</L>
<L>Their crimes were worth or riches; hath he spared</L>
<L>One, but whom absolute necessity</L>
<L>Compell'd, or mean opinion of his faculties</L>
<L>Suffer'd to live?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>To this, his cruel policy</L>
<L>He adds superior talents; with a soul</L>
<L>That penetrates mankind, he bears conjoin'd</L>
<L>The fiery spirit of the warrior God.</L>
<L>Talents by virtue guided, which might place him</L>
<L>Among the first of kings, but now serve only</L>
<L>To make him bold and resolute in vice,</L>
<L>And what is worse, create an awe, a dread,</L>
<L>On which, as on a base not to be shaken,</L>
<L>Stands fix'd high-towering tyranny.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet we</L>
<L>Need not complain: us he hath spared; and me</L>
<L>While 'gainst the Ardeates he wages war,</L>
<L>In trust exalted to be governor</L>
<L>Of this fair city.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, were life alone to be esteem'd,</L>
<L>We should not murmur; but to breathe the air,</L>
<L>To walk about at large, eat when we please,</L>
<L>Sleep at our will; this is not life—the beast</L>
<L>Upon the mountain leads a life like this.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
When I'm so selfish as to center all</L>
<L>My sense of pleasure here, when I cast off</L>
<L>Tender humanity, which feels, as relative</L>
<L>To all the members of society,</L>
<L>Joy or affliction, may I then be cursed</L>
<L>With such a life as this.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Didst thou remember</L>
<L>Among the senators by Tarquin slain,</L>
<L>The name of Marcius Junius?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well I knew him;</L>
<L>But what of him?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! He was placed above</L>
<L>The strain of men; his many virtues made him</L>
<L>Respected as a god by th' sons of Rome:</L>
<L>His ancestors came hither with Aeneas</L>
<L>From flaming Troy, the valour of his race,</L>
<L>Th' heroic ardor which inflames the breast</L>
<L>Of conscious greatness, and uplifts mankind</L>
<L>To something of divinity, dwelt in him.</L>
<L>He was a man, that had he 'scaped the wreck</L>
<L>Of those tempestuous days, would ne'er have suffer'd</L>
<L>Gigantic tyranny to take such strides.</L>
<L>At least some check he would have been, some curb</L>
<L>Upon the mouth of headstrong appetite,</L>
<L>And wild ambition. This our Tarquin knew:</L>
<L>And at the same time looking with an eye</L>
<L>Of greediness upon his large possessions, sent</L>
<L>And slew him and his elder son, a youth</L>
<L>Of gracious hopes; the younger being absent</L>
<L>Escaped the ruin.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>And now dwells with Tarquin,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11"/>
Lucius, the fool, the laughing-stock o' th' court:</L>
<L>Whom the young princes always carry with them</L>
<L>To aid their sport and jocund merriment;</L>
<L>The but, at which they shoot their shafts of wit;</L>
<L>Whose paucity of sense, and mode uncouth.</L>
<L>Aukward and blundering, hath deservedly</L>
<L>Got him the name of Brutus—But why waste</L>
<L>Our talk on this same ideot?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Solve the question:</L>
<L>I did but hint him, speaking of his father.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, why talk at all, when all must end</L>
<L>As bootless as began?—There is a bound</L>
<L>Which checks, they say, all evils in their course,</L>
<L>And good ensues.—Our evils know no change;</L>
<L>Nor have they this extremest limit proved.—</L>
<L>Tho' that they should be in progression still,</L>
<L>Is past belief.—Yet there's no chance in nature,</L>
<L>No possibility of alteration,</L>
<L>No man alive to aim at alteration:</L>
<L>And his three sons, Titus, and Aruns, Sextus,</L>
<L>All equal to their father in ability,</L>
<L>Beyond, if possible, in the black deeds</L>
<L>Of villainy, of lust, and treachery,</L>
<L>Are three firm pillars added to the pile</L>
<L>Which threats to stand for ages. Oh! these thoughts</L>
<L>Are capable to banish moderation</L>
<L>From the prepared breast, and make the wise</L>
<L>Turn fools and madmen.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let us drop the subject.</L>
<L>Who knows the secrets of avenging Jove?</L>
<L>Perhaps though we, short-sighted as we are,</L>
<L>Think liberty bound in eternal thraldom,</L>
<L>His counsels otherwise decree: e'en now</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
Haply the dread events are bursting forth,</L>
<L>Like light'ning from the gloomy firmament,</L>
<L>To sweep this race of hell-hounds from the earth.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What may be, I'll not say; but hope long since</L>
<L>Hath ceased with me to wear her sanguine hue.</L>
<L>Why should free agents e'en on Jove depend,</L>
<L>To sway the will he gave?—Man rules himself—</L>
<L>His own fate's arbiter.—Tho' o'er these times</L>
<L>Broods desperation, shall we not beneath</L>
<L>Her wings immew'd, this galling, tempting theme</L>
<L>Again revive?—Words cannot pluck the thorn,</L>
<L>But soothe the smart.—Farewel—I'll to my house—</L>
<L>Whither if in the evening you will come,</L>
<L>Still on a genuine Roman citizen</L>
<L>My Lares smile.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I would attend unbidden.</L>
<L>But thy inviting voice should charm me thither,</L>
<L>Spite of disease or pain. At evening close</L>
<L>I come; then farewel.</L>

<L>Why doth he not attack the nest at once</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
With fire and sword, and rouse up all the swarm?</L>
<L>It was not thus he triumph'd o'er the Sabines,</L>
<L>Or wrested from the warlike Volsci's hands</L>
<L>Suessa Pometia, with whose glorious spoils</L>
<L>Turning religious all at once, he built</L>
<L>The temple in the capitol to Jupiter.</L>
<L>Though had he ask'd of me, I could have told him</L>
<L>A better way of laying out his money.</L>

<L>Aye, and wisely too.</L>
<L>Pleasure's my deity, my Jupiter,</L>
<L>My Juno, and Minerva. Titus too,</L>
<L>If I mistake not, is no Atheist there,</L>
<L>But worships with as warm enthusiasm</L>
<L>As any votary of them all; 'tis true</L>
<L>He wears a graver brow, and commits sin</L>
<L>With a more serious philosophic face,</L>
<L>There's all the difference between me and thee,</L>

<L>Alike!</L>
<L>Why now indeed thy airy spirits dance,</L>

<L>What wert thou then? Inwrapp'd in discontent.</L>
<L>What wilt thou be anon? Chiding at straws</L>
<L>For lying in thy path; then quick, by th'sparks</L>
<L>Of angry passion, kindled into flame;</L>

<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, be it so, heaven speed us both! But Sextus!</L>
<L>I envy that same Sextus; for his genius</L>
<L>Soars o'er us both, and robs us of our birthright.</L>
<L>Not that I think, we halt behind him much</L>
<L>In our design'd intentions; but success</L>
<L>Befriends him farther, one would swear he kept</L>
<L>Fortune in pay, and that the blind-eyed goddess</L>
<L>Accepted bribes from him. There's not a woman</L>
<L>He looks on with desire but he possesses;</L>
<L>He says but to an enemy, Fall down,</L>
<L>And down he falls. Hah! say'st thou, is he not</L>
<L>A son of Tarquin, and a glorious villain?</L>

<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Glorious I grant, but not a villain, Aruns.</L>
<L>Pshaw! that's a name may suit a vulgar mouth,</L>
<L>A tradesman talking of his brother knave;</L>
<L>But rank and station sanctify men's deeds;</L>

<L>Thou reason'st well, by Mars!</L>

Appearing in his palace hiss'd aloud</L>

<L>Rich presents to the God; He offer'd him</L>
<L>A walking stick; as if the god would walk,</L>
<L>And take the air, but that the god was lame.</L>
<L>Coming from out the temple, gazing back,</L>

<L>Yes, yes, all men</L>
<L>Must grant that I have no small smattering.</L>
<L>But where was I? Oh—Kinsman, says the king,</L>
<L>Says he, and smiled most graciously upon me,</L>

<L>Still keep these sentiments, my son; they shew</L>
<L>The man, not the poor-spirited mean creature</L>
<L>That generally is call'd so, but the man</L>
<L>Born to command, to lord it o'er these earth-worms,</L>
<L>To sit in the exalted seat of empire,</L>
<L>And wield the sceptre; to be plac'd a god</L>
<L>Above the rest, as the gods are 'bove him.</L>
<L>Had I been guided by the moderate maxims</L>
<L>Of doating politicians, had I not</L>
<L>Acted on principles which my soul started,</L>
<L>And hands dared execute, I should have lived</L>
<L>Coop'd up within the walls of Rome, and call'd</L>
<L>Only that petty city, those few acres,</L>
<L>My sum of territory: have pursued</L>
<L>The canting superstitions of old Numa;</L>
<L>Or thought, with Ancus, that to build a bridge</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="31"/>
Or thought, with Ancus, that to build a bridge</L>
<L>Over the Tiber was a wonderous work;</L>
<L>Or, like old purblind Servius, have recorded</L>
<L>Offices, ages, deaths, births, marriages,</L>
<L>And kept the public register o'th' state.</L>
<L>But I resolved to rise above controulment,</L>
<L>To seize the glorious substance of true majesty,</L>
<L>To be a king indeed; and men are not</L>
<L>The restive beings some have but supposed:</L>
<L>They on timidity encroach, but dare not</L>
<L>Look settled resolution in the face.</L>
<L>Habit makes even slavery easy. Hence</L>
<L>I turn'd my conquering arms 'gainst all the states</L>
<L>Around, and made Hetruria pale with fear:</L>
<L>Now may the proudest nation yield to Rome,</L>
<L>And own her its superior; hence I'm honour'd,</L>

<L>Keep but you three together, in the band</L>

<L>Time, and th' adversity of accident,</L>
<L>Or force of malice.—But, my sons, the reason</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="32"/>
Of this our meeting; this strong city Ardea,</L>
<L>Like to a mighty mound, dams up the current</L>
<L>Of our progression; were but this our own,</L>
<L>The whole Rutilian state of course would follow.</L>
<L>The question is, how to attain this end?</L>
<L>Assault we've tried, and wept our hardy veterans</L>
<L>Slain in th' unequal task; their walls are high,</L>
<L>And in few places only they're assailable;</L>
<L>Th' inhabitants are numerous, and resolv'd</L>
<L>To sell their freedom dear; plenty as yet</L>
<L>Makes them high-mettled, and they laugh to scorn</L>
<L>Us and our strength. Speak each what you advise,</L>
<L>Whether again t' advance our scaling-ladders,</L>
<L>And strive with fire and sword to gain admission;</L>
<L>Or whether change our siege into blockade,</L>
<L>And starve them to surrender. Titus, speak.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TITUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I see no reason here for much debate,</L>
<L>Or many words to fix determination.</L>
<L>Our soldiers with their late successless toil</L>
<L>Dispirited and faint; theirs with the contrary</L>
<L>Valiant and bold: again, th' uncertainty</L>
<L>Of being more successful than before,</L>
<L>The probability that we shall not;</L>
<L>Th' ill consequences if we make th' assault</L>
<L>In vain; all tempt me to dissuade from action;</L>
<L>To gird the city well, harrass the country,</L>
<L>Debar them from supplies, sap their high walls,</L>
<L>Wait till we gain a lucky time for onset,</L>
<L>Or deep-laid stratagem; this gives a conquest</L>
<L>Certain, tho' slow; and this do I advise.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Think not I speak through contradiction, Titus:</L>
<L>But I can bring as many arguments,</L>
<L>As cogent too, and couch them full as briefly,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="33"/>
Why we should not delay; in every sally</L>
<L>Made since that trial, they've been beat to th' gates;</L>
<L>This hath restored the courage of our soldiers;</L>
<L>And shame now adds a double sting to bravery.</L>
<L>Delay breeds relaxation in our duty.</L>
<L>The Rutili and their allies may join,</L>
<L>Hem us between them and the walls of Ardea,</L>
<L>Or march to Rome itself. Delay breeds danger.</L>
<L>I do not like delay; it is a word</L>
<L>I hate; 'tis ominous as the raven's croak;</L>
<L>It bears with it a cold and death-like sound.</L>
<L>Might I but lead the army once again</L>
<L>To the attack, I'd be myself the first</L>
<L>To mount the wall, and answer for th' event:</L>
<L>If not, let the events speak for themselves,</L>
<L>Or speak you for them who determine otherwise.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEXTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Could I by sly imposture hope to win</L>
<L>This Ardea, as I did the town of Gabii,</L>
<L>I would again submit my back to th' scourge,</L>
<L>And from my father's cruelty, a suppliant,</L>
<L>Intreat the gull'd inhabitants; nor wait</L>
<L>His hint, by cutting down the tallest poppies</L>
<L>I'th' presence of the messenger I sent him,</L>
<L>To slay their leaders. If this could be done,</L>
<L>Or any thing like this, I'd not advise</L>
<L>Speedy assault, or to protract the siege,</L>
<L>In both of which I can espy no small</L>
<L>Degree of danger. Titus well advises,</L>
<L>And so doth Aruns. A small grain would turn</L>
<L>The scale in either's favour. If our father</L>
<L>Determine for th' assault, about it speedily,</L>
<L>I'll climb to the top o'th' wall as soon as Aruns.</L>
<L>If Titus shall be thought t' have better counsell'd,</L>
<L>I'll watch the turn of every circumstance;</L>
<L>And hard it shall be, if some dexterous craft</L>

<L>My lord, I am not well, I'm very sick.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sick! and by what physician's wise advice</L>
<L>Walk'st thou expos'd to the damp evening air?</L>
<L>Hangs not the dew upon the dropping leaves?</L>
<L>And doth not Philomela, at the pause</L>
<L>Of every pensive strain, turn back her head</L>
<L>And wipe the trickling moisture from her wing?</L>
<L>Go to, thou art not sick.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Indeed, I am.</L>
</SP>

<L>Indeed thou art! thy hand: ah! ah! I know</L>
<L>A lover's pulse: rather a wencher's: ah!</L>
<L>Were I to beat the bushes well around</L>
<L>'Tis ten to one but up the hare would start.</L>
<L>There are three kinds of men, whom I have found</L>
<L>Most notable that way.—First your shy fellows,</L>
<L>Who hang the head, and if you speak to them,</L>
<L>Are blushing ripe immediately. Next those</L>
<L>Who shun society, and swear that man</L>
<L>Is a curst creature whom they cannot live with.</L>
<L>Thirdly and lastly, all religious,</L>
<L>Of all denominations. These three kinds</L>
<L>Of men, have all hot amorous blood, which tingles</L>
<L>Through every vein, and will not give them rest.</L>
<L>Among the second thou comest in point blank,</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="44"/>
A mixture hast thou of the first and third;</L>
<L>Though were the gods to shake thee, thy religion</L>
<L>Might fall from thee for aught I know, as fast</L>
<L>As leaves blown from a sapless tree in Autumn.</L>

<SPEAKER>COLLATINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dost thou then think it hangs so loosely round me?</L>
<L>Were it indeed bound with firm bands of brass,</L>
<L>And knit with pins of hardest adamant,</L>
<L>Whatever of religion I might have,</L>
<L>Were Aruns but permitted, soon he'd strip me,</L>
<L>And leave me naked as himself.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I own, I have no notion of these tricks,</L>
<L>These ceremonial farces, sacrifices,</L>
<L>Prophetic entrails, truth-foreseeing birds,</L>
<L>Chicken who teach by hieroglyphic pease,</L>
<L>And all the holy jugglings, which our priests</L>
<L>Would fain persuade us owe their origin</L>
<L>To th' essences divine.—Wilt thou deny</L>

<L>Who met him often in a wood like this?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COLLATINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What profits my denying or affirming?</L>
<L>But say, is Aruns likewise ignorant</L>
<L>Of that pure incense which the breast unspotted</L>
<L>Offers to heaven; that fine ethereal fire</L>
<L>Which by the gods created first, and placed</L>
<L>I' th' human bosom, sed by the fair deeds</L>
<L>Of moral goodness, rectitude, and truth,</L>
<L>Flies upward to its native origin?</L>
<L>Hath he no notion of that holy instinct</L>
<L>Which bids us look with awe, t'ward the great Ruler</L>
<L>Of heaven and Earth? and of that conscious pleasure</L>
<L>Arising in the soul, when bending low,</L>
<L>In humble reverence, we pay homage due</L>
<L>To the prime Power of all? Who call'd us forth</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="45"/>
From the abyss of nothing into being?</L>
<L>Placed us above th' unthinking grazing herd?</L>
<L>Gave to us reason, by whose power we stand,</L>
<L>Foremost of all his works, lords of this world?</L>
<L>Who framed the universe for us alone;</L>
<L>And, for our pleasure? hung the flaming sky</L>
<L>With all its glowing orbs? Adorn'd the earth</L>
<L>With fruits, with flowers, and herbs of various sorts?</L>
<L>Fill'd earth, and air, and ocean's womb immense</L>
<L>With subject creatures, who might yield him homage,</L>
<L>Or be to him for food? Hast thou no notion?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Plague on thy notions! Plague upon thy questions!</L>
<L>Think'st thou the gods high-throned (if such there be)</L>
<L>E'er heed such sneaking abject two-legg'd animals</L>
<L>As thou and I are? From our praise what glory</L>
<L>Can they obtain? Or from our first existence</L>
<L>What satisfaction? Speculative dreamers</L>
<L>May fancy things like these; but chief your busy</L>
<L>Crafty pretenders, who well know to soothe</L>
<L>The ear of ignorance, tell these curious tales.</L>
<L>They know to profit by't. The easy fool</L>
<L>Swallows their canting potion glibly down,</L>
<L>And looks on them as heaven's own oracles.</L>
<L>'Tis all a jest, a may-game, or what's worse;</L>
<L>Whatever knaves may teach, or asses credit,</L>
<L>Ease is the pleasure of th' immortal gods,</L>

<L>Easy 'twould be to prove, how ill they merit</L>
<L>The name of deities, who sit inactive</L>
<L>In slothful state, while chance, that is, while nothing</L>
<L>Governs the world, and turns heaven's hinges round.</L>
<L>To prove, that man is from contemptible</L>
<L>Far, far removed; that there are some of real</L>

<L><PB N="40" REF="46"/>
What they profess, and from these feelings teach;</L>
<L>Who in the exercise of their devotion,</L>
<L>Taste greater joy than kings have power to give:</L>
<L>Nor would for th' unlock'd wealth of the wide earth,</L>

<L>Oh, mock me not! I am as serious</L>
<L>As father Winter, when the cold north-east</L>
<L>Blowing between his shoulders through a chink,</L>

<L>Take it, ye winds! 'Tis my religion—hence!</L>
<L>Lighten'd of this, now Collatine and I</L>
<L>May talk together without quarrelling.</L>
<L>I know not what 'tis good for, but to make</L>
<L>Men sour, and splenetic: I'll ne'er speak more</L>
<L>Or for it, or against it. Pr'ythee, Collatine,</L>
<L>Forgive me, if in too impertinent</L>
<L>And bold a strain I spake in its defence:</L>
<L>'Twas irony, my friend, sheer irony,</L>
<L>I thank thee that thou didst retaliate;</L>
<L>I see th' absurdity, and bid a long</L>
<L>Adieu to it for ever.—Hold thy tongue.—</L>
<L>'Tis gone, 'tis hence, 'tis no where, 'tis a theme</L>
<L>For priests, for ideots: thou hast cured me quite;</L>

<L>Wilt thou tell me, Aruns,</L>
<L>How I shall answer thee? for never yet</L>

An answer thou wert pleased withal; if grave,</L>
<L>'Twas mighty dull, if gay, 'twas vastly silly;</L>
<L>E'en answer for me, Aruns, here I am:</L>
<L>Look round; what say the objects which thou see'st?</L>
<L>What say the objects which thou left'st behind?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>The objects which I left behind, are good;</L>
<L>The objects which I see are good; all's good;—</L>
<L>I should not speak at all.—A camp, a wood,</L>
<L>A wood, a camp.—Why I might beat my brains</L>
<L>For ever, e'er rouse up one new idea.—</L>
<L>Thou art indeed a moralizer, thou</L>
<L>Canst pick a sentence out of every stone,</L>
<L>And make the springy grass on which thou tread'st</L>
<L>Thy monitor. I'm stupid; fancy with me</L>
<L>Is long since dead; to each external thing</L>
<L>I'm as indifferent as if they never</L>
<L>Fill'd up their corner of existence. Blessing</L>
<L>Upon the Powers above! who steel'd my nerves,</L>
<L>And blunted every sentient faculty,</L>
<L>So that in vain, they'd dart before my sight</L>
<L>Their flaming thunderbolt.—But what of me?</L>
<L>I from this time appoint thee my preceptor.</L>
<L>I have improved already, I'll improve</L>
<L>Still more, tell me thy meditations.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COLLATINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will, nor do I think, what I'd not utter</L>
<L>To all mankind. I wish with equal truth</L>
<L>All the whole world could say so.—I will own</L>
<L>I came not to the camp with my good will:</L>
<L>I have no quarrel 'gainst the Ardeates,</L>
<L>They never injur'd me, nor do I know</L>
<L>A Roman whom they did: but 'twas my duty,</L>
<L>I was commanded, and obey'd; where danger</L>
<L>Raged in the fight, I was not backward: thou</L>
<L>Canst witness for me, 'mid the foremost bands</L>
<L>I braved the ruffian Death.—My mind's my own;</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="48"/>
My service is my king's. I own I pitied</L>
<L>Those against whom I fought; nor wish'd to conquer</L>
<L>The brave, the injured. 'Mid the roar of war</L>
<L>I long'd for peace, and when the fight was o'er,</L>
<L>I would have found it in my tent; but there</L>
<L>It was denied; if I gave up one moment</L>
<L>To short reflection, strait intruded on me</L>
<L>Shoals of your new-created officers:</L>
<L>Pert coxcombs, who in words flame in the front,</L>
<L>And stare each terror of the field i'th' face;</L>
<L>Though when in arms, half-dead, they only know</L>
<L>Each motion by report: these brother soldiers</L>
<L>(For such they scruple not to call themselves)</L>
<L>Worried my ears to death: I left the camp.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>No wonder: such as these disgrace the name</L>
<L>Of manhood; oft I've seen them pale and wan</L>
<L>Not dare to lift an arm against the foe,</L>

<L>Quite discontented with myself and them,</L>
<L>I hither came.—I cast my eyes around,</L>
<L>I saw the labours of the husbandman</L>
<L>Destroy'd; I saw the smoaking villages;</L>
<L>A thousand horrid thoughts of misery</L>
<L>Struck on my mind; I heard a thousand groans</L>
<L>Of fathers, mothers, children.—I could not</L>
<L>Refrain from tears, I could not as I live,</L>
<L>To think that industry, and innocence,</L>
<L>And sweet content, and genial home-bred joy,</L>
<L>Should from their native mansions be expell'd,</L>
<L>And their possessors slain perhaps by th' hands</L>
<L>Of brutal violence; or doom'd to lead</L>
<L>A life not worth the name, the prey of want,</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="49"/>
Of woe, of anguish; 'twas indeed with tears</L>
<L>I thought upon it, and each human glory</L>
<L>Faded before me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARUNS.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas most lamentable,</L>
<L>And melancholious; I could weep methinks,</L>
<L>At the relation, had I not sworn solemnly,</L>
<L>When some years since lost in the melting mood</L>
<L>I play'd the fool egregiously, ne'er more</L>
<L>To weep at any rate.—These are sweet feelings;</L>
<L>I lose a deal of joy, I know full well,</L>
<L>By not indulging them: but 'tis no matter.—</L>
<L>What a fine tale hast thou been telling me,</L>
<L>Of troublesome companions, dismal sights,</L>
<L>And soft compassion melting into tears!—</L>
<L>Think'st thou I can't see through all these pretences?</L>
<L>Once, but not lately, once, when yet a boy,</L>
<L>I felt I know not what of odd emotions;</L>
<L>The peevish, amorous, whining, doating god</L>
<L>Had with his arrow pierced my liver through.</L>
<L>When absent from my love; but not my wife;</L>
<L>I sigh'd, and groan'd, and shook my pensive head,</L>
<L>And sought out desert rocks, and nodding pines,</L>
<L>And murmuring streams to soothe my sickening soul.</L>
<L>And if a friend by chance had found me out,</L>
<L>And ask'd what ail'd me, Ail me, gravely said I,</L>
<L>I'm pitying the vices of the world,</L>
<L>And thinking of its follies; though myself</L>
<L>Was then a child of folly, and as true a one</L>
<L>As any she e'er bore; a woman's fool.—</L>
<L>But do not weep again: when these same wars,</L>
<L>These cursed wars, are over, it shall see</L>
<L>Its own true love again; yes, that it shall,</L>
<L>It shall, it shall.</L>

<L>No false professions, good my friend; die say'st thou!</L>
<L>No, live; live while thou may'st;—we stand upon</L>
<L>A hanging bank fast crumbling in the stream</L>
<L>Of headlong time; if swoll'n by rains, or vex'd</L>
<L>By raging winds, perhaps an hour, a moment,</L>
<L>Sweeps us away; and shall we aid, ourselves,</L>

<L>And plunging in the waves before our day?—</L>
<L>Likest thou the metaphor? Come then with me;</L>
<L>And we'll to-night laugh off these clogging weights;</L>
<L>So that at least we will insure ourselves</L>

<L>Before assurance, and a tongue well-hinged,</L>
<L>They fall by thousands; a strait back, a leg</L>
<L>Well-turn'd, and nimble, cutting quick vaults well,</L>
<L>A lively eye, yet in their presence bending</L>
<L>As if o'er-awed; these, with th' aforesaid graces,</L>

<L>Who is so chaste, forsooth, she wipes her mouth</L>
<L>After her husband, lest the breath of man,</L>
<L>If settling there too long, should taint her virtue.</L>
<L>I use them as they are; their native passion,</L>
<L>I know, is love of novelty; however,</L>
<L>Others more subaltern, as love of riches,</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="56"/>
Grandeur, and shew, may seem to over-sway it;</L>
<L>Hence, tho' they swear they love me wonderous well</L>

<L>This is the common cant; the stale, gross, idle,</L>
<L>Unmeaning jargon of all those who, conscious</L>
<L>Of their own littleness of soul, avoid</L>
<L>With timid eye the face of modest virtue,</L>
<L>All those who to the name of womanhood</L>
<L>Join dignity of soul, and innocence</L>
<L>Unstain'd by inward base desire; who flush'd</L>
<L>With triumphs over those they dare attack,</L>
<L>The weak, or forward, those whose lines of feature</L>
<L>Proclaim there's no resistance to be made,</L>
<L>Or those who spring obtrusive forth, and meet</L>

<L>At virtue, wheresoever she passes by them.</L>
<L>I have seen sparks like these, and I have seen</L>
<L>A little worthless village cur all night</L>
<L>Bay with incessant noise the silver moon,</L>
<L>While she serene, throned in her pearled car</L>

<L>Thus 'tis we plan; and thus our favourite schemes</L>
<L>Are blasted in the bud; we travel on</L>
<L>The road of life; we cast our sight far forward;</L>
<L>We think we spy the goal, our eyes are fix'd,</L>
<L>And fancy gives us earnest of possession:</L>
<L>Meanwhile ten thousand, thousand accidents,</L>
<L>Each as minute, and imperceptible,</L>
<L>As the fine floating threads of Midsummer,</L>
<L>Obliquely cross us; small, yet strong as fate.</L>
<L>Our progress is denied; the nerves of action</L>
<L>Are firmly fetter'd; as with idle toil</L>
<L>We strive to extricate ourselves, dark night steals on,</L>
<L>We fall, and haply never rise again,</L>
<L>Ne'er see the ruddy face of morn: or lost</L>
<L>In fogs and mists rove darkling, till arriv'd</L>
<L>At where we first set out, we strive again,</L>
<L>Again are baffled by the sturdy trifles,</L>
<L>And sink at last fatigued, and quite o'ercome,</L>
<L>Into the arms of death. Sorrowful thought!</L>
<L>But yet in strictness true.—Come life, come death,</L>
<L>He hath not lived in vain, who so hath lived</L>
<L>To satisfy himself.—Poor argument!</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="69"/>
In reason good, in practice weak.—For me,</L>
<L>I am not satisfied, nor will be satisfied,</L>
<L>Missing the mark.—Tut—This is woman's play,</L>
<L>Meer words, meer words—deeds are the test of man.</L>
<L>And there I fail; a pufillanimous,</L>
<L>Tame, indolent, vile driveler.—But cease, cease;</L>
<L>Can I command occasion? Wrest the sway</L>
<L>Of mortal things from the strong rule of Heaven?</L>
<L>And to my will bend the reluctant step</L>
<L>Of coy contingency? O you high Powers!</L>
<L>Into your hands do I resign myself.</L>
<L>Might I be used the humble instrument</L>
<L>To free my country, Oh, how bless'd were I!</L>
<L>If Rome must sink, if I must live in vain,</L>
<L>And die as I have lived, I will not murmur;</L>
<L>I'm nothing; you are wise, and just, and good.—</L>
<L>Yet why not seek Valerius? Heaven, and earth!</L>

<L>But such a hubbub, such a monstrous din,</L>

<SPEAKER>LUCRETIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I thank thee for thy tale, Lavinia,</L>
<L>Though little heeded; it would raise my mirth</L>
<L>Sometimes; though now I could not but retreat,</L>
<L>To that which Clelia had before related.</L>
<L>And didst thou know the youth, my Clelia?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLELIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Full well I knew him; 'twas my sister's son.</L>
<L>Oft e'er he died, for he was long a dying,</L>
<L>I went to see him; oftimes he ran o'er</L>
<L>Each circumstance of his unhappy love,</L>
<L>And the cold scorn which prey'd upon his heart.</L>
<L>And when his cheeks were wan, and his fair eyes,</L>
<L>Which once the liveliest that e'er glanced the flame</L>
<L>Of ardent faithful passion, were grown dim,</L>
<L>And scarce to be perceiv'd; when his strength sail'd,</L>
<L>And in a low weak tone he call'd me to him,</L>
<L>Entreated me, if ever I esteem'd him,</L>
<L>To keep the secret from the cruel maid,</L>
<L>Nor offer his departed soul a violence,</L>
<L>By giving of her pain; then, with a feeble</L>
<L>And trembling motion, press'd my hand t' his bosom,</L>
<L>Till I was almost dead as well as he.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what became of her? I think thou said'st,</L>
<L>She with remorse was seiz'd; and at the hour</L>
<L>Of midnight, starting from her bed, sought out</L>
<L>The grave where he was buried.</L>

<L>There she died.</L>
<L>I think, that with th' assistance of Camilla,</L>

<L>Oh! for the sake of heaven, keep to yourself</L>

<L>Or if she does, will dream of them, and wake</L>
<L>In sad affright.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCRETIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, fear not, my Lavinia:</L>
<L>Though much I like these tales of native woe,</L>
<L>I have no superstition, and no fears,</L>
<L>Which will disturb repose. How thou art moved,</L>
<L>I know not; but to me, a pleasing calm</L>
<L>Succeeds these narratives of grief o'erpast;</L>
<L>And though I sympathise, when they are told,</L>
<L>It is a joy I would not be without:</L>
<L>For always, in my mind, Lavinia,</L>
<L>The soft delight, which feeling pity brings,</L>
<L>Though but indulged a moment, far excels</L>
<L>An age of wanton gay festivity,</L>

She, without doubt, had heard his character,</L>

<L>To battles, sieges, dreadful deeds of arms,</L>
<L>Adventures rare, by martial prowess won:</L>
<L>A subject, to the which all woman-kind,</L>
<L>Open a greedy ear; but not a word</L>

<L>Swore I would slay them both upon her bed,</L>
<L>And publish to the world, I caught them there</L>
<L>I'th' act of shame: she found resistance vain;</L>

<L>I Told you how this melancholy sight,</L>
<L>The history of the deed shewn in its true</L>

<L>And father, with the artless eloquence</L>
<L>Of real grief; how the discovery</L>

<L>Each braver youth stood quickly by their side</L>
<L>Array'd in arms, burning with indignation</L>
<L>Pent in their breasts. We left Collatia</L>
<L>And enter'd Rome; a sight so new and strange,</L>
<L>With the arm'd multitude, first struck th' inhabitants</L>
<L>With fear and terror: but when they beheld</L>
<L>The order of our march, peaceful and solemn,</L>
<L>They soon put off their fears, and throng'd to gaze</L>
<L>Undress'd, unornamented, on her bier</L>
<L>Lay, scarce yet cold, Lucretia's chaste remains,</L>
<L>Beauteous in death: you might have ta'en her so,</L>

<L>For five and twenty years, during which time</L>

<L>Expressive of myself, a golden rod</L>
<L>Beneath a case of wood. As to his threats,</L>
<L>Tell him I heed them as the chiding gale,</L>
<L>Or th' ocean wave beating at the fix'd base</L>
<L>Of a high promontory. Though should I meet him</L>
<L>Mid the ensanguin'd field in glorious fight,</L>
<L>Engag'd for the great cause of liberty,</L>
<L>I'll dare the proudest of my country's foes,</L>
<L>And with the sword of vengeance, on his crest</L>
<L>Engrave a mark indelible: tell him</L>
<L>No Roman murders women: that we leave</L>
<L>To Tarquin and his sons; even the croud</L>
<L>Pursued her only through the streets with curses,</L>
<L>Invok'd the furies of her parents on her,</L>
<L>And saw her pass the city gate; so hence</L>
<L>In safety go, to him who sent thee hither.</L>

<L>Were Aruns us,</L>
<L>Neither would he have found it. Now, my friends,</L>
<L>To-morrow will Horatius and Herminius,</L>
<L>The Ardeates having to a truce agreed</L>
<L>For fifteen years, lead all the army homeward.</L>

Then in the common meeting of the people,</L>
<L>Lest they should think two kings instead of one</L>
<L>(Though chosen annually) may lord it o'er them;</L>
<L>One of us, Collatine, will lay aside</L>
<L>Our symbols of command, only resumed</L>
<L>Alternate month by month. The good Papirius,</L>
<L>King of the holy things, shall offer up</L>
<L>Our general sacrifice, while we again,</L>
<L>And every individual then assembled,</L>
<L>Both for ourselves and our posterity,</L>
<L>Renew our solemn oath ne'er to admit</L>
<L>One of the Tarquin race. This night (more grateful</L>
<L>Than clouds-of inconse) let our secret prayers,</L>
<L>Our private gratitude, and thanks, ascend</L>
<L>To the high-ruling powers. For howsoe'er,</L>
<L>Vain man may think he plans with arduous care,</L>
<L>'Tis they alone his sentiments inspire,</L>
<L>They fill his breast with more than mortal fire,</L>
<L>'Tis they alone light up the patriot flame,</L>
<L>They lift the humble, and the haughty tame,</L>
<L>They every human accident foresee,</L>
<L>To them not accident, but certainty.</L>
