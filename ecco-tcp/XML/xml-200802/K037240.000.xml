<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be easily perceiv'd, why no Ad∣dress, by way of <HI>Dedication,</HI> cou'd be proper to this Poem: Yet, the Verses ought perhaps to have been offer'd, before print∣ed, to the View of One Great Family (lest, among Ideas, of so complicated a Variety, there shou'd be some, wherewith it might not, as to Point of Delicacy, have been found eligible to associate Names, of such sincere Distinction and Importance). But the Writer recollected, that the mere Omission of an Act of Cere∣mony cou'd not, equitably, be complain'd of, in a Poem where he has not arrogated, <HI>to Himself,</HI> the Freedom to give PRAISE, or CENSURE: All, that points at either One or Other, being narrative Recital only; and That, too, from the Voices of such Speakers, as the Public daily <HI>hears,</HI> ex∣pressing
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
more, upon both Subjects, than they are represented in this Place, as uttering.</P>
<P>As to the general Disposition of the Purpose, if Any too bold Strokes of Liberty shou'd chance to be suspected in it, let it be remember'd in the Writer's Favour, that he is no better than an empty <HI>Visionary!</HI> And This is not the first Time, that a Man, in a Dream, has been a very <HI>impertinent Fellow,</HI> who, in his waking Intervals, has kept within the Bounds of due <HI>Decorum.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning LUXURY especially, none ought to make the Muse accountable for what she prattles in her <HI>Sleep:</HI> Since 'tis about a Power she never corresponds with, <HI>but in Slumber.</HI> And, if TRADE is touchy, and won't bear to have it credited, that <HI>Daughters</HI> come by means of <HI>Mothers,—</HI>who could shun the Hazard of offending such a choleric Petulance?—The Wri∣ter had no Licence to restrain, or ca∣strate, Sentiments he but <HI>reports,</HI> from Personages, to whome his Country owes a Reverence that forbids the Boldness of curtailing their Ideas.—Neither has he given the captious <HI>Coquette</HI> above-nam'd
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
the least Occasion of Offence, without Hard-straining and Partiality; for, Who can look upon it as an Undervaluing of <HI>Trade,</HI> that she is represented as not over∣much dispos'd to <HI>carry Arms</HI> Herself; nor over-fond, indeed, of Those <HI>she pays for carrying them?—</HI>Authorities enough might probably be found, to prove plain Truth no Slander. But he rather pleads the Merit of that prophesied <HI>Expedient,</HI> toward the End of the Vth Canto, for a perfect Reconciliation between the Drum, and Warehouse.—If, notwithstanding This, the waking Poet must be charg'd with the Vagaries of his dreaming Muse, He can but borrow Comfort from this tit-for-tat Reflection:—That, since Trade is naturally dispos'd to think, with Dulness and Con∣tempt, of <HI>Poetry,</HI> the Poet in his Turn, may, by Right of Equivalent, assume the same dull Privilege; and prate, as foolishly, of <HI>Traffick.</HI></P>
<P>To pass, at once, from Poetry,—to Prose, and Truth, and serious <HI>History:—</HI>The great, and nobly-judging, Lady, to whome, in the VIth Canto, an Advice of no small Con∣sequence
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
is offer'd, by a bold, tho' <HI>naked,</HI> Friend, (of whome she never yet was known to be asham'd, however bare, and out of Fashion, she approach'd her) will reflect, with some Attention, on the Pro∣position; after hearing what <HI>Foundation</HI> It was grounded on.</P>
<P>About the Year 1735, a private Person, not worth <HI>naming,</HI> but an ardent Lover of his Country's Reputation, became dif∣possess'd of a mistaken Notion, (which had been at first imbib'd by Conversation with the <HI>Prejudic'd,</HI> but gradually con∣firm'd and heighten'd, by much Reading, Speculation, and Reflection, upon military Subjects) that the most celebrated <HI>English Conqueror,</HI> of this last Age, (It might, I think, be added, without Flattery, above Any, of the Former) was not <HI>pre-medi∣tatively,</HI> and by Force of his superior Skill, the Author of his own unprecedented Vi∣ctories.—The Mistaker grounded his Con∣clusion on that Great General's <HI>Letters,</HI> written from the Fields of Battle, with the first Accounts of his Successes.—It is visi∣ble beyond Dispute, that, <HI>there,</HI> one meets
<PB REF="6"/>
with none of those <HI>descriptive</HI> and <HI>expla∣natory</HI> Circumstances, whereby the skilful Captains, of all Ages, took such cautio∣nary Care to guard against unjust Impres∣sions of their Conduct; by unfolding it, in Plan, in Progress, and Accomplishment: that, not their <HI>Fortune</HI> only, but their Fore∣sight, and Superiority of Genius, might be noted, in their Victories. It is hence, that in so many of the Antient's, and in some great <HI>Modern's,</HI> written Narratives, we <HI>see,</HI> and understand, minutely, the whole Ground-plots, Dispositions, Oppo∣sitions, and clear <HI>Out-break,</HI> of the Acti∣ons: Not in their bald <HI>Success</HI> alone; but with their previous Motives, their impend∣ing Agitations, and eventual Over-balance, and Conclusion: Whereas, from all the publish'd Letters of our more than equal Executer of his own unequall'd Purposes, we gather nothing further, than that the Army He commanded was triumphant; and that He seems to think each Leader, in it, more deserving his Remark, than the Elu∣cidation of his own Designs, in their reported Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
In a Visit made, about the Time just mention'd, to another <HI>English</HI> General, a Noble Lord, since dead, at a small Gar∣den Seat of his, near <HI>London,</HI> These Ob∣servations were inlarg'd upon, (as they had often been to others) in a Conversation on the military Character of our great Fa∣vourite of Fortune: whome, it has been thought, the Lord here meant had, for∣merly, regarded with some Rival Pangs of Emulation. It were therefore an ungene∣rous Coldness to his Memory, to conceal the noble Sentiments wherewith he clos'd the Conversation on this Subject!—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have (said he) misunderstood His Cha∣racter, and done it the same <HI>Wrong,</HI> that many Thousands do, and will con∣tinue to do, from but the natural Con∣sequence of his sincere and modest <HI>Ne∣gligence of Ostentation.—</HI>He thought it, equally, His Duty to subdue the Enemy, and His own Sensibility of <HI>Triumph for subduing him.—</HI>He made, I think, but <HI>one</HI> Mistake in his Field Conduct: But <HI>That</HI> was a Mistake of such unlucky Consequence, that It has been able to
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
do more, <HI>against Himself,</HI> than Ten <HI>French Armies</HI> cou'd: for It obscures (you see) the Lustre of his Genius.—He trusted <HI>History,</HI> for Explanations, which, He shou'd have known, It cou'd not make (but in a lame and superficial manner) for want of Lights, which He alone had Power to furnish, who was the only Person dis-inclinable to <HI>wish</HI> 'em furnish'd."</Q></P>
<P>The Impression which this truly noble Answer made, and the Reflections which It gave Occasion to, have often, <HI>since,</HI> pre∣sented to Imagination as a <HI>National</HI> Mis∣fortune, the Possibility of some destructive Accident, to those invaluable Original Pa∣pers, which contain ('tis said) sufficient Matter, in His Family's Possession, to im∣mortalize, as well That Great Man's <HI>Tem∣per, Wisdom, Suavity, Skill,</HI> MODES, and MEANS, of Conquest, as the Reputation merely, of the Victories themselves.—The <HI>Last,</HI> it must be own'd, is <HI>Glory:</HI> But it is a Glory of a barren and unpropagative Species: 'Tis the Glory of a <HI>Nimrod,</HI> a <HI>Seso∣stris, Hercules, Arthur,</HI> and <HI>Pendragon:</HI> Names, of aweful Cloudinessl but uneffectual
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Admiration!—because heard of, more than <HI>shown:—</HI>Not Lights, of Living <HI>History;</HI> by whose Help, the <HI>Caesars</HI> and the <HI>Alexan∣ders</HI> are not only, in Themselves, immor∣tal; but by their Force of Emulative In∣spiration, have been, are, and will continue to the End of Time, the military <HI>Fathers,</HI> of new Sons of Glory, in all Nations, and throughout all Ages.</P>
<P>Who, therefore, cou'd too much lament an Accident of such severe Importance, shou'd it happen to the mention'd Papers, before That glorious <HI>Use</HI> has been drawn from them, which is hinted in the Close of the last Canto? Where that the Writer may not seem impertinent, he has, here, assign'd his <HI>Reasons,</HI> for conceiving it both a Domestic, and a Public Duty, on the Care of That illustrious Conqueror's <HI>Re∣presentatives.—</HI>But where the Hand is to be found, in all Points, equal to an Undertaking of such arduous Difficulty, is a Wish, that may be added to the List of those <HI>Deside∣rata,</HI> rather hinted at, than hop'd for, by the boldest Enterprizers, in the Common∣wealth of Learning!</P>
