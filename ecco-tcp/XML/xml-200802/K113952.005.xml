<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN ODE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BY Love too long depriv'd of rest,</L>
<L>(Fell tyrant of the human breast!)</L>
<L>His vassal long, and worn with pain,</L>
<L>Indignant late I spurn'd the chain;</L>
<L>In verse, in prose, I sung and swore</L>
<L>No charms should e'er enslave me more,</L>
<L>Nor neck, nor hair, nor lip, nor eye,</L>
<L>Again should force one tender sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>From fair to fair I vow'd to range,</L>
<L>And part from each without regret</L>
<L>As pleas'd and happy as I met.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Freedom's praise inspir'd my tongue,</L>
<L>With Freedom's praise the vallies rung,</L>
<L>And every night and every day,</L>
<L>My heart thus pour'd th' enraptur'd lay:</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="76"/>" My cares are gone, my sorrows cease,</L>
<L>" My breast regains its wonted peace,</L>
<L>" And joy and hope returning prove,</L>

<L>Such was my boast—but, ah! how vain!</L>
<L>How short was Reason's vaunted reign!</L>
<L>The firm resolve I form'd ere-while</L>
<L>How weak oppos'd to Clara's smile!</L>
<L>Chang'd is the strain—The vallies round</L>

<L>Let not thy slave, condemn'd to mourn,</L>
<L>With unrequited passion burn;</L>
<L>With Love's soft thoughts her breast inspire,</L>
<L>And kindle there an equal fire!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is not beauty's gaudy flower,</L>
<L>(The empty triumph of an hour)</L>
<L>Nor practis'd wiles of female art</L>

<L>WHen, young, life's journey I began,</L>
<L>The glittering prospect charm'd my eyes,</L>
<L>I saw along the extended plan</L>
<L>Joy after joy successive rise:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And Fame her golden trumpet blew;</L>
<L>And Power display'd her gorgeous charms;</L>
<L>And Wealth engag'd my wandering view;</L>
<L>And Pleasure wooed me to her arms:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To each by turns my vows I paid,</L>
<L>As Folly led me to admire;</L>
<L>While Fancy magnified each shade,</L>
<L>And Hope increas'd each fond desire:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soon I found 'twas all a dream;</L>
<L>And learn'd the fond pursuit to shun,</L>
<L>Where few can reach their purpos'd aim,</L>
<L>And thousands daily are undone:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And Fame, I found, was empty air;</L>
<L>And Wealth had terror for her guest:</L>
<L>And Pleasure's path was strewn with care;</L>
<L>And Power was vanity at best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
<L>Tir'd of the chace, I gave it o'er;</L>
<L>And, in a far sequester'd shade,</L>
<L>To Contemplation's sober power</L>
<L>My youth's next services I paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There health and peace adorn'd the scene;</L>
<L>And oft, indulgent to my prayer,</L>
<L>With mirthful eye and frolic mien,</L>
<L>The Muse would deign to visit there:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There would she oft delighted rove</L>
<L>The flower-enamell'd vale along;</L>
<L>Or wander with me thro' the grove,</L>
<L>And listen to the woodlark's song;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or, 'mid the forest's awful gloom,</L>
<L>While wild amazement fill'd my eyes,</L>
<L>Recall past ages from the tomb,</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus, in the Muse's favour blest,</L>
<L>One wish alone my soul could frame,</L>

<L>A friend, and Thyrsis was his name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For manly constancy and truth,</L>

<L>Still with our years our friendship grew;</L>
<L>No cares did then my peace destroy:</L>

<LG>
<L>But soon the blissful scene was lost,</L>

<L>(Fool that I was, I bless'd the smart)</L>
<L>And, while I gaz'd, nor thought of harm,</L>
<L>The dear infection seiz'd my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She was—at least in Damon's eyes—</L>
<L>Made up of loveliness and grace,</L>
<L>Her heart a stranger to disguise,</L>
<L>Her mind as perfect as her face:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To hear her speak, to see her move,</L>
<L>(Unhappy I, alas, the while!)</L>
<L>Her voice was joy, her look was love,</L>
<L>And heaven was open'd in her smile!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She heard me breathe my amorous prayers,</L>
<L>She listen'd to the tender strain,</L>
<L>She heard my sighs, she saw my tears,</L>
<L>And seem'd at length to share my pain:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
<L>She said she lov'd—and I, poor youth!</L>
<L>(How soon, alas, can Hope persuade!)</L>
<L>Thought all she said no more than truth,</L>
<L>And all my love was well repay'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In joys unknown to courts or kings,</L>
<L>With her I sate the live-long day,</L>
<L>And said and look'd such tender things,</L>

<L>FRom gay St. James's Myra was return'd,</L>
<L>Within her breast the flames of envy burn'd,</L>
<L>Reclin'd upon the couch she sought relief,</L>
<L>But the soft plumage added to her grief;</L>
<L>Now to the citron cordial she applies,</L>
<L>The cordial too its usual balm denies;</L>
<L>Will not kind Morpheus one short nap bestow?</L>
<L>He never perches on a breast of woe.</L>
<L>What! has her peerless face betray'd some flaws?</L>
<L>Or does some mighty loss the conflict cause?</L>
<L>Has some dire pimple, to disturb her eye,</L>
<L>Made an irruption where the lillies lie?</L>
<L>Smokes there less incense at her virgin shrine?</L>
<L>Or crowns some rival-toast th' enamour'd wine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What can she dread, whose every charm subdues</L>
<L>The garter'd noble—and invites the muse?</L>
<L>Not one of those, nor all of them conjoin'd</L>
<L>Have ruffled the composure of her mind;</L>
<L>But at the court she saw, what tongue can tell!</L>
<L>Worse than Quevedo's visionary hell—</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="101"/>A female implement! and at the sight</L>
<L>Her spirit sunk—she swoon'd away for spite!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Clarinda's hand the glittering pageant grac'd,</L>
<L>With which she led the beaux, and men of taste;</L>
<L>Discarded Myra saw the envied prize;</L>
<L>She saw—and curst it with her heart and eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, even at church, if some new dress arrive,</L>
<L>The blazing meteor galls the female hive;</L>
<L>Each eye, arrested, on the fashion glotes,</L>
<L>And every woman imprecates, and doats;</L>
<L>The clerk's proud wife neglects her husband's song,</L>
<L>And comminations fly from every tongue.</L>
<L>A fan! the mighty cause of Myra's care,</L>
<L>For beauties envy trifles light as air!</L>
<L>The fashion dawn'd from madam Pompadour,</L>
<L>Newly imported to the British shore:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Clarinda, to improve her magazine</L>
<L>Of charms—had lately at the toyshop been,</L>
<L>Searching for trinkets, she the bawble found,</L>
<L>And seiz'd the product of a foreign ground,</L>
<L>Resolving to transplant it to the court,</L>
<L>She bought, and paid a hundred guineas for't;</L>
<L>Arm'd with this bright umbrella she appear'd,</L>
<L>And, wafted by its gales, to conquest steer'd;</L>
<L>A hecatomb of hearts were soon resign'd</L>
<L>To young Clarinda's eyes intrench'd behind;</L>
<L><PB N="100" REF="102"/>While stars and garters emulating strove</L>
<L>Which should croud foremost to present his love,</L>
<L>His vows thro' this gay medium to enhance;</L>
<L>Such are thy fashionable tools—oh France!</L>
<L>While thus Clarinda's innovating pride</L>
<L>From Myra's charms drew dukes and lords aside,</L>
<L>Like a discarded statesman, in disgrace</L>
<L>The fair one to the victor left the place;</L>
<L>Thus, like a beaten general, forc'd to yield,</L>
<L>She quits the glories of the long-fought field:</L>
<L>In sullen discontent she seeks the gloom</L>
<L>To meditate revenge within her room.</L>
<L>At length to Venus with uplifted eyes,</L>
<L>And fervent prayer, the baffled maid applies:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Oh! Venus, by thy myrtles and thy doves,</L>
<L>" And every symbol of the Paphian groves,</L>
<L>" By all thy bright regalia I implore,</L>
<L>" Oh! grant one favour to thy Myra more;</L>
<L>" Let not Clarinda such a conquest boast,</L>
<L>" Nor lead of nobles, thus, her shining host:</L>
<L>" For lo! what stars, like silver Cynthia's train,</L>
<L>" Attend her triumph, and support her reign!</L>
<L>" See, how each garter, like the Zodiac, vies</L>
<L>" To grace the blue horizon of her eyes!</L>
<L>" Debase her trinket, her new-fangled toy,</L>
<L>" And crush the infant dawning of her joy,</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="103"/>" Give me, by some rich implement, to win</L>
<L>" The men—tho' 'twere a diamond—headed pin:</L>
<L>" Then shall a thousand hearts, a thousand days,</L>
<L>" With sweetest incense on thy altars blaze.</L>
<L>" Then, for each lover which thy gift imparts,</L>
<L>" A hymn shall carol to the God of Hearts."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Propitious Venus heard the maiden's prayer,</L>
<L>And sent a pleasing dream to sooth her care:</L>
<L>Fair to her raptur'd fancy there arose</L>
<L>A crimson orb, but richer far than those</L>
<L>Which stately cardinals in triumph wear,</L>
<L>The boon and earnest of the papal chair;</L>
<L>Its ample brim three rows of sapphires grac'd,</L>
<L>The cestus, as a ribband, gave it taste:</L>
<L>A thousand brilliants, here and there display'd,</L>
<L>With blushing rubies, lent it light and shade.</L>
<L>In emerald cut, a king imperial sate</L>
<L>Beneath a golden canopy of state,</L>
<L>Powder'd with hieroglyphics of his reign,</L>
<L>As undisputed monarch of the main.</L>
<L>The consort of his throne was seated nigh</L>
<L>In pearl, and clearest crystal form'd each eye;</L>
<L>Attending nobles the regalia bore,</L>
<L>The crown and sceptre both of massy ore.</L>
<L>In solemn order the procession moves,</L>
<L>A prelate waits to crown their happy loves.</L>
<L><PB N="102" REF="104"/>Why should we here describe, what all have seen,</L>
<L>The coronation of a king and queen?</L>
<L>Or why attempt in colours to display</L>
<L>That state, when George and Charlotte blest the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dazzled with lustre, Myra now awakes,</L>
<L>And from the visionary model takes</L>
<L>A hat, which soon eclips'd Clarinda's fan,</L>
<L>Nor left the fair competitor a man.</L>
<L>With this she claims Love's empire as her own,</L>
<L>Reigns absolute, nor envies George his throne.</L>

<L>THE rivers once their union broke,</L>
<L>For reasons, like us English folk,</L>
<L>Because they knew not why;</L>
<L>The gentry took it in their head</L>
<L>To run no more, but keep their bed,</L>
<L>And let the sea go dry;</L>
<L>For why, forsooth, should they be always going</L>
<L>To keep him full, and humour his o'erflowing?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They would support no more, not they,</L>
<L>His royal tidings twice a day,</L>
<L>His tides of ebb and flood;</L>
<L>The Danube swore it; and the Rhine</L>
<L>Made oath, upon his richest wine,</L>
<L>To make the compact good.</L>
<L>No—no—he, truly, did not understand</L>
<L>Why his imperial streams should brook command.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And next appear'd the Ohio,</L>
<L>With castles laden was his brow,</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="108"/>By which he solemn swore,</L>
<L>That if the Missisippi join'd,</L>
<L>And was as well as he inclin'd,</L>
<L>He'd go to sea no more;</L>
<L>The Missisippi gave his oath, that he</L>
<L>Would be as true, and to the league agree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next spoke the Severn's stately tide;</L>
<L>" Sirs—I will curb old Ocean's pride—</L>
<L>" Here do I daily pour</L>
<L>" Millions of tons for Ocean's use,</L>
<L>" And truly, he'll have no excuse,</L>

<L>He matter'd not the odds:</L>
<L>What was't to him, or his, if he must creep,</L>
<L>And cringe to do obeisance to the Deep?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There was not even a tench, or carp,</L>

<L>No—nor a trout, or eel,</L>
<L>The meanest native of the stream</L>
<L>Could dwell upon the pleasing theme</L>
<L>To save the common-weal:</L>
<L>The public good was now the general cry,</L>

<L>Vox Populi, Vox Dei, loud</L>

<L>The motion was unanimous agreed</L>
<L>From smooth-wav'd Medway to the northern Tweed.</L>
</LG>

<L>What was the dreadful consequence?</L>
<L>The waters broke o'er mound and fence,</L>

<L>Their spawn and progeny;</L>
<L>They and their helpless families were left</L>
<L>To starve,—of Ocean's usual stores bereft.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, unsupplied, he must deny</L>

<L>Such is the fatal end of harsh extremes!</L>

<L>" Love gave me conquest, but denied me bliss,</L>
<L>" When from her lips she wip'd the ravish'd kiss;</L>
<L>" Cruel and coy she blasted all my pride,</L>
<L>" And 'midst the transports of my friends I sigh'd;</L>
<L>" Denied her love, I'm poor with all the rest,</L>
<L>" Indulg'd with that, of more than all possess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" What giddy caprice rules a woman's mind,</L>
<L>" As fate relentless, and as fortune blind!</L>
<L>" On vanquish'd Colin Phillis shed her smiles,</L>
<L>" And all his sorrows, and his pain beguiles;</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="116"/>" She, from the wound I gave, with lenient care</L>
<L>" Wash'd the stiff gore, and clipp'd the clotted hair;</L>
<L>" The healing simples with soft touch applied,</L>
<L>" Own'd and caress'd him spite of female pride,</L>
<L>" Mourn'd his disgrace, and now from future harms,</L>
<L>" Perhaps she hides him in her circling arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" O! had kind heaven to me transferr'd his blow,</L>
<L>" O! had I own'd him a superior foe,</L>
<L>" Fled from the general hiss, with shame deprest,</L>
<L>" To hide my blushes in her downy breast!</L>
<L>" To him, with rapture, every prize I'd yield,</L>
<L>" And all the tasteless honours of the field,</L>
<L>" For each gay trifle with her love o'erpaid,</L>
<L>" Blest, tho' forgotten, in the secret shade!</L>
<L>" Vain wish! to Colin is that bliss decreed—</L>
<L>" Distracting thoughts distracting thoughts suc∣ceed—</L>
<L>" May swift destruction seize the hated pair,</L>
<L>" Or, worse than swift destruction, my despair!</L>
<L>" No—may the fruitless curse leave Phillis free,</L>
<L>" But doubled, Colin! be fulfill'd in thee."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>High on the neighbouring mountain's airy head</L>
<L>His browzing goats as happy Colin led,</L>
<L>Pronounc'd with hasty rage, he heard his name,</L>
<L>And near the brow with still attention came;</L>
<L>Too near—the treacherous brink gives way, and lo!</L>
<L>He shrieks, and plunges in the brook below;</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="117"/>The sounding waters, whitening as they rose,</L>
<L>Now with subsiding murmurs round him close.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Damon, alarm'd, his falling rival knew,</L>
<L>And, swift as lightning, to his aid he flew;</L>
<L>Prevailing virtue triumph'd in his breast,</L>
<L>And pity love and enmity supprest;</L>
<L>He saw him gasp emerging from the brook,</L>
<L>And reach'd, with generous haste, his saving crook,</L>
<L>Caught by the drowning wretch with both his hands,</L>
<L>And grateful, trembling, on the bank he stands.</L>
<L>Short recollection serv'd him, thus to show</L>
<L>How much a friend he rose, who fell a foe;</L>
<L>" Born to subdue me, and subdued to save,</L>
<L>" Thine from this moment is the life you gave;</L>
<L>" Here, by the gods who sent thee to my aid,</L>
<L>" I swear no more to see thy favourite maid,</L>
<L>" By partial favour, not by merit mine,</L>
<L>" To thee, more worthy, Phillis I resign;</L>
<L>" Go, and my falshood to thy mistress plead,</L>
<L>" Go, and may heaven and love thy suit succeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus soon with ardent looks, with honest pride,</L>
<L>And just disdain, the kindling swain replied:</L>
<L>' What Damon's faithful love essay'd in vain,</L>
<L>' He scorns by Colin's broken vows to gain;</L>
<L>' Be thine the maid, since fate ordains it so,</L>
<L>' And time and absence shall allay my woe;</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="118"/>' Friends, from this hour forever, let us live,</L>
<L>' My friendship's pledge, this spotless ewe I give;'</L>
<L>" And I, yon kid than falling snow more white,"</L>
<L>Glad Colin cried, and mutual faith they plight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus busied, Phillis, unperceiv'd, drew near,</L>
<L>Foredoom'd, her love now twice renounc'd, to hear;</L>
<L>" Take, Damon," thus the blushing maid begins,</L>
<L>" The hand, the heart, thy generous virtue wins;</L>
<L>" Not Colin's broken vows, but Damon's truth,</L>
<L>" Now blends my fate with thine, deserving youth!</L>
<L>" To try thee, O! forgive if tried too far,</L>
<L>" Was all I meant, whate'er my actions were."</L>
<L>Her hand, with sudden rapture, Damon prest,</L>
<L>The joyful pair consenting Colin blest;</L>
<L>To Damon's cot they take the flowery way,</L>
<L>With guiltless mirth to crown the happy day.</L>

<HEAD>SWEET-WILLIAM, OR VERSES OCCASIONED BY THE CHRISTENING OF MR. WOOD'S SON, WHO WAS NAMED SWEET-WILLIAM, APRIL XXVII, MDCCLXIII.</HEAD>
<L>WIth song, sweet babe, we celebrate thy birth,</L>
<L>And hail thee to the chequer'd scenes of earth:</L>
<L>Thy smiles of innocence our hearts endear,</L>
<L>When Spring now fairest paints the purple year;</L>
<L>Promise of future fruit, all nature blooms,</L>
<L>Hills, vales, woods, gardens, send forth rich per∣fumes;</L>
<L>Such beauty in etherial mildness reigns,</L>
<L>We match our meadows with Idalian plains;</L>
<L>And thee, did not thine eyes our error prove,</L>
<L>Thee we should deem a little smiling Love.</L>
<L>Sweet-William, wellcome to the realms of day!</L>
<L>O, may'st thou bloom the sweetest flower of May!</L>
<L>Thy lovely mother's gentle mind inherit,</L>
<L>Thy father's honest heart, and generous spirit—</L>
<L>Yes, Yes, I see (so strong prophetic power!)</L>
<L>An embryo genius in this rising flower,</L>
<L>A hand that's valiant, and a heart that's true</L>
<L>To serve his neighbours, and his nation too:</L>
<L>Thus in the acorn's little folds we see</L>
<L>An oak imperial in epitome;</L>
<L>By slow degrees the leaves, the boughs expand,</L>
<L>Rise, spread, shade, flourish, and defend the land.</L>

<HEAD>TO THE REV. MR. LAYNG, OCCASIONED BY HIS SERMON ON MUTUAL BE∣NEVOLENCE, PREACHED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE NORTH∣AMPTON INFIRMARY.</HEAD>
<L>LET fools religion in opinion place,</L>
<L>And call whim, spleen, and superstition, grace;</L>
<L>Put in mock'd Virtue's legal hand a reed,</L>
<L>And on her throne, vile idol! rear a creed,</L>
<L>While weeping Charity is doom'd to seel</L>
<L>The smarting scourge of unrelenting Zeal;</L>
<L>And sainted Bigotry, with impious pride,</L>
<L>Claims all the sky, and damns the world beside.</L>
<L>O! taught of heaven! be thine the better part,</L>
<L>With sacred love to touch the kindling heart;</L>
<L>Still mild benevolence, like Jesus preach,</L>
<L>And spread the truths he liv'd and died to teach;</L>
<L>Still build salvation on the Saviour's plan,</L>
<L>And God's own glory on good-will to man;</L>
<L>So shall good-nature at thy voice refine,</L>
<L>And what was moral shall be more—divine!</L>
<L>Self-love shall learn to taste of social joy,</L>
<L>And public works the miser's hands employ;</L>
<L>Folly inform'd, converted Vice shall own,</L>
<L>That wisdom, pleasure Virtue gives alone;</L>
<L>Deists shall scorn the Christian name no more.</L>

<HEAD>LOVE ELEGY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN AT — COLLEGE, OXFORD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE solemn hand of sable suited night</L>
<L>Enwraps the silent earth with mantle drear,</L>
<L>Thick murky clouds obscure Diana's light,</L>
<L>Nor shines one star the dusky scene to cheer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er the sad mansion, hid in awful gloom,</L>
<L>The Aethiop darkness spreads her ebon sway,</L>
<L>Save that alone, from yonder studious room,</L>
<L>The wasting taper sheds a feeble ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now while the tenants of this sacred dome</L>
<L>Turn the grave page, or sink to soft repose,</L>
<L>Along the Gothic cloisters let me roam,</L>
<L>And, deep in thought, the lazy moments lose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now breathes the whistling storm a mournful song,</L>
<L>And pattering drops the drizzly tempest tell,</L>
<L>Whilst Echo roves the lonely vaults among,</L>
<L>Sadly-responsive to the midnight bell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And hark! the pensive owl, with boding strain,</L>
<L>Shrieks notes of terror from the learned grove;</L>
<L>All! horrid sounds! full well ye sooth my pain,</L>
<L>Full well your music greets despairing love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
<L>No longer now around the social bowl</L>
<L>I join the jocund laugh, or cheerful lay,</L>
<L>But pour in ceaseless groans my love-sick soul,</L>
<L>'Till fades the lamp at bright Aurora's ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How, at the fragrant hour of rising morn,</L>
<L>Would throbbing transport rush thro' every vein</L>
<L>To hear the swelling shout, and echoing horn,</L>
<L>Call the gay hunter to the sportive plain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, ah! the sprightly joys of youth are fled!</L>
<L>In sighs and tears my waining life I wear;</L>
<L>So the pale lilly hangs its drooping head,</L>
<L>When chilling hoar-frosts blast the vernal year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Philosophy! thou guardian of the heart,</L>
<L>Oh, come! in all thy rigid virtue drest,</L>
<L>With manly precepts ease the killing smart,</L>
<L>And drive this tyrant from my wounded breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft would my eye, disdaining balmy sleep,</L>
<L>Thy form divine thro' every path explore,</L>
<L>Fathom with restless toil each maxim deep,</L>
<L>And hang incessant o'er thy awful lore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! oppos'd to Love, how weak! how frail!</L>
<L>Are all the reasons of th' unfeeling sage!</L>
<L>No dull advice can o'er his power prevail,</L>
<L>Or the keen pangs his dart inflicts asswage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
<L>Yes tyrant, yes, thou must retain thy power,</L>
<L>'Till my torn bosom yields to stronger death,</L>
<L>Still must I love, even in that fatal hour,</L>
<L>And call on Delia with my latest breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when all pale my lifeless limbs extend,</L>
<L>And Fate has seal'd th' irrevocable doom,</L>
<L>May then my memory find a faithful friend,</L>
<L>To write these numbers on my peaceful tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Here rests a youth, who love, and sorrow's slave,</L>
<L>" Gave up his early life to pining care,</L>
<L>" 'Till worn with woe, he sought in this calm grave</L>
<L>" A safe retreat from anguish and despair."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when the stone lies o'er my clay-cold head,</L>
<L>If chance fair Delia to the place drew near,</L>
<L>With one sad sigh she may lament me dead,</L>
<L>And bathe the senseless marble with a tear.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE FOLLY OF ATHEISM.</HEAD>
<L>HOW weak the Atheist's argument, how odd?</L>
<L>Who, to be happy, first denies a God;</L>
<L>Then, with too little faith truth to believe,</L>
<L>Can show too much, an error to conceive;</L>
<L>So inconsistent, and his folly such,</L>
<L>He trusts too little, while he trusts too much.</L>
<L>A foe profess'd to God Almighty's laws,</L>
<L>Yet a blind bigot in the Devil's cause;</L>
<L>He from free-thinking hopes to gain some light;</L>
<L>Thinks free on every subject, but the right;</L>
<L>A hint there is a God raises a doubt,</L>
<L>And Prejudice puts weaker Reason out:</L>
<L>Of Reason proud, by Passion rul'd alone,</L>
<L>Because he'd have no God, concludes there's none;</L>
<L>Thinks chance with blind effect nice order brings,</L>
<L>And harmony from wild confusion springs,</L>
<L>Springs of itself—for all spontaneous grow,</L>
<L>And the created are creators too:</L>
<L>Then immortality he'll disbelieve,</L>
<L>Yet starts to think he cannot always live;</L>
<L>Dreading it true, a future state denies,</L>
<L>And while he laughs at death, with fear he dies;</L>
<L>Despairing launches to some future state,</L>
<L>Repents his folly—but repents too late.</L>

<HEAD>ADVICE TO AN AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<L>THou! who art thirsty for a poet's name,</L>
<L>Panting for perpetuity of fame;</L>
<L>O! tremble to increase the Muses tribe,</L>
<L>'Till Mother Griffiths has receiv'd a bribe:</L>
<L>If praise, like hers, can make thy piece go down,</L>
<L>Th' insurance premium is but half a crown;</L>
<L>And who can blame her? for the bawd must pay</L>
<L>In ready cash the hirelings of a day:</L>
<L>Else would the movement of the press stand still,</L>
<L>And low-bred Scandal drop her venal quill.</L>
<L>Yet sure one bard 'tis better to pursue</L>
<L>Thro' the black numbers of a dull Review,</L>
<L>And maim a work without the skill to carve,</L>
<L>Than that a whole Society should starve.</L>

<P>{inverted ⁂} The Monthly Reviewers having taken upon them to assert, that we plundered the poem called the Kite, from the Gent. Mag. This is to assure the Public, that assertion is false and malicious. The Editors of the Poetical Calendar are possessed of three early editions of that poem; the first is printed in the year 1719. the second at Oxford in 1722. and the third is in a collection of poems called the Flower-piece, printed in 1731. from which we copied it. What fine criti∣cisms may the world expect from such ignorant and malevolent writers!</P>
