<P>Damon and Phillida. Altered from CIBBER into a COMIC OPERA. With the Addition of NEW SONGS and CHORUSSES. As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. GARRICK having allowed me, as Miss Radley's master, to choose what second part she should appear in, I turn'd my thoughts towards the ballad farce of Damon and Phillida. But when I came to look at it, I not only found that the music consisted of a great many heavy minuets, and old fashion'd country-dances, but that there was too much dialogue, without the intervention of airs, which being also in blank verse, rendered the drama still more tiresome, as well as hurt the simplicity of some of the characters; which, in the idea, were not contempt∣ible: add, that the opening and conclusion were extremely flat and un-operatical.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3"/>In order to remedy the first objection, I ventured to reset some of the ballads, intending, out of esteem for our old me∣lodies, to let the rest remain, with the addition only of modern accompanyments; but here again I found the trouble would be equal to new setting the whole; and I also saw, that without the chance of adding any thing to my own little reputation, I might lay myself open to censure, by en∣deavouring to mend, what in the opinion of many people, might want no improve∣ment.</P>
<P>For these reasons I have composed all the songs entirely new: and as the piece has never pleas'd upon the stage, and for that reason has been very seldom performed since that great actress Mrs. Clive was so justly celebrated in the part of Phillida: I have taken the farther liberty to make such alterations in the drama as I presumed necessary.</P>
<P>I have thrown the dialogue into prose, added several new songs, restored others
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
from Love in a Riddle, inserted chorusses, and, whether for the better or the worse, made the whole very different from what it has ever yet appeared. With regard to the music, I shall only say, that while I have endeavoured to give light and familiar airs, I have also endeavoured to give such as are neither trite nor vulgar.</P>

<P>I am told, Corydon, that you want my advice in something that materially concerns you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I have made bold to ask it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me hear your story, and whatever power I have to serve you, you may freely command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my good Lord, you are our general friend—This is my daughter; I have ever studied to make her happy; and to own the trurh, her chearful com∣pliance with all my commands, from her infancy, has rendered that task a great satisfaction to me: now, my Lord, lest I should die, and leave her in an unfriendly world, I would fain see her well married; and for that purpose have found her out a pair of well-meaning youths to take her choice of, Cymon and Mopsus here; they are brothers; and their manners suit her condition: I am well assured she might be happy with either of them, for they both love her sincerely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CYMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an please you, we are both cruelly in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little patience, honest Cymon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>These lads, I say, my Lord, if there was no ob∣struction in the way, might one or t'other make her a good husband perhaps—but this soppish rambling Damon here, has bewitch'd her I think; his squeaking pipe has rival'd both Cymon and Mopsus, and they toy and play together all day long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CYMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay so they do, an please you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, Cymon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CYMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I have done; I'm sure 'tis true tho'.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MOPSUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoh! hoh! hoh! That fool, my brother, is always in the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, Mopsus, now you are worse than he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on with your story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CORYDON.</SPEAKER>
<P>So nothing now but Damon is thought of, and Damon I fear will ruin her, which would but ill re∣compence me for all my care and fatherly advice. The favour I would beg of you, my Lord, is to interpose your authority in my behalf; and, though you are not our king, 'tis well known you rule our hearts; and the continual good you do us every day, makes it but gratitude that we should yield to whatever is your pleasure: therefore, if you think my case deserves pity, I hope your wisdom will point out to me a way to pre∣vent any ill that may ensue from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take your grief to heart, good Corydon, and wish I may have it in my power to make you easy; Damon, you hear your accusation, do you think it honest to trifle in an affair like this; or that it will add to your reputation to say you purchas'd this unwary maid's af∣fection at the price of all she possess'd, for which she could be counted amiable? Think seriously, and tell me what I shall say I've done to right this good old man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, my professions are sincere; let the girl please herself: if she has a mind to marry, there's her choice; if she has a mind to make a frolic of life, here's her man.</P>

<P>No, no, poor Cymon, thou art never the nearer; not all thy songs, nor sighs, nor sobs, can move her.</P>

<P>Perhaps she may like Mopsus better; come, my lad, let's hear what you have to say; you seem chearful.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MOPSUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am always so; I loves to laugh, for my part, let things go how they will: what do I care for her frowns: it gives a body's mind some ease to think that Cymon's us'd as ill as I; all my comfort is, that hap∣pen as it will, I shall have him to laugh at.</P>

<SPEAKER>ARCAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Corydon, let us enquire into your daugh∣ter's heart. Phillida, here are three youths who labour to deserve your love; tell me freely which is the man that's favour'd most by you; trust me with the secret of your wishes, that I may prove your friend.</P>

<SPEAKER>PHILLIDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I am urg'd to speak the truth, I own my heart, my Lord, has been foolishly imposed upon; my father's will I never disobeyed, and sincerely wish I had it now in my power to please him; but I can never consent to lead a savage life; and what could I expect better from the company of these lads?</P>

<SPEAKER>PHILLIDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard that I must chuse from such extremes of folly—Damon's infidelity should make me hate him; but I fear he has too many tender advocates in my heart; 'tis true I have try'd a thousand times to shut him from my thoughts, as often found I try'd in vain; my weakness will find excuses for his treatment of me; whenever he submits, he's sure to be forgiven; and whenever I forgive, I am sure to be forsaken.</P>

<SP>
<P>HOW could the little gipsey carry it off with such an air? I am so provoked by her impertinent pride, that I shall never rest in my bed till she lies by me; but let me see, are her terms reasonable? That my heart is subdued appears pretty plain; that the object of my love is a worthy one, every shepherd confesses; that during our last conversation, my whole behaviour was dissimulation, the uneasiness I now feel will witness for me; what then should I in honor and conscience do? I have made the appeal, and am ad∣vised to call the shepherds together, and Arcas at their head, to be witnesses of my conversion, and my deter∣mined resolution to change the libertine to the mar∣ried man.</P>
