<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I flatter myself the public will agree in my opinion, that a burlesque of affected gentility, can be no where better addressed than to a Lady, whose elegant and liberal ideas of life, ornament even Nobi∣lity, I have ventured this intrusion; which as it proceeds from a profound respect for your Ladyship's very distinguished charac∣ter, will, I hope, be considered in a fa∣vourable light.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, with all possible deference, MADAM,
<SIGNED>Your Ladyship's Most obedient and very Devoted servant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this <HI>Dramatic scrap,</HI> having from a fatal, and irreparable event in his family, laboured under a gloom of mind exceedingly disadvantageous to <HI>Comic</HI> ideas, has reason to fear it wants much of that spirit, which a happier state of imagination would have produced; but having promised a piece of this kind to Mr. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Mr. FOOTE kindly conferred an unexpected favour on Mr. WESTON, which rendered a new piece unnecessary, the author is happy in transferring it to Mr. JEWELL, as a very valuable member of society.</NOTE> WESTON, as a performer of singular merit, he encountred a task rather irksome, and to get the subject out of his way, pursued it with uncommon rapidity; however, from the favourable opinion of some judicious friends, hopes it will not be deemed un∣worthy existence on the stage or in the closet.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>A! honest farmer, well met.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honest farmer! Hey day! what are all you London folks flatterers? Tho' by the bye, I believe I am as honest as most of my neighbours: Tom Tilwell can lay his hand upon his heart, and say he never be∣lied providence, nor wished a rise of provisions in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoity toity! if many farmers were of this way of thinking, we cornfactors and salesmen should be soon as thin as Pharoah's lean kine—a parcel of poor devils indeed: the finest scheme in the world, except clipping and coining, would be totally ruined. No, no, Heaven send the landlords to raise their rents, and the farmers to keep pace with them.—Ah, you don't know the pleasure and profit we enjoy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pleasure! what, in starving your fellow crea∣tures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Starving—no, no, mercy forbid! not so bad as that, only lock their jaws a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't, by appearance, master Skinflint, seem as if your jaws were much locked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! why, you would not put me on a foot∣ing with ragged weavers in Spittle-fields, or slip-shod taylors in Clement Danes.—You don't see into the bottom of things.—We are friends to government as well as ourselves. The English, master Tilwell, Londoners particularly, are, with full bellies, insolent, grumbling politicians; they pretend to think for themselves.—Now
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
weaken the beer when you raise the price; clip short their beef and pudding; keep provisions high, and wages low—you have 'em as tame as so many pet pigeons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>At this rate your business is of great use.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greatest importance, I assure you.—We are on the Change-alley plan exactly; as they have at all times letters ready from Dantzig, Hamburgh, the Hague, or an express from India over land, to influence stock, so we have accounts from every shire in England, to keep up the markets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then you have correspondents in all parts of the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one on that account.—We don't care how things really are; we can make them as we please.—Why I have burned the uplands with sun-shine, and drowned the low-lands with rain a thousand times. I was the means of lifting up the peck loaf two-pence last week; and have another petition from the bakers to the court of aldermen in my pocket; it's penned in such a lamentable stile, that I don't doubt, with one or two more, working up to a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What when there's a fine crop, fine weather for harvest, and new corn coming in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that.—Did not you see a para∣graph of mine in the papers last week, that all the old was gone. Yet, would you think it now, for all I take so much pains, and make it so fine a time for gentlemen of the crust, I was obliged to arrest one of the fraternity yesterday for a hundred and fifty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must be a bad manager indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apes quality—as most of our trades-people do now-a-days—keeps a country-house, a phae∣ton, and, for ought I know, a mistress. But I don't so much blame him for this, if he had any brains: why the blockhead, in five years trade for himself, never had sense enough to make a loaf two or three ounces short; and is so plaguy conscientious, as not to use any allum, because its unwholesome.—Time for me to look sharp, master Tilwell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after all, friend Skinflint, though I am a farmer, and may gain by it, I think it hard
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
that there should be plenty and scarcity at the same time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Politic, politic.—If all the fish that's caught was brought to market, and all the meat that's killed sold, both would soon be a drug. There is one instance among many—Mat. Marrow-bone, of Honey-lane market, as pretty a fellow as ever whetted a knife, will frequently, rather than take a halfpenny a pound under the fixed price on Saturday night, tip ten guineas worth into the Thames on Sunday morning. He has show'd me his Thames register, and a sweet pretty collection of drowned joints there is. However, I advised him for the future, to bury all; because, you know, in the water it may feed and increase the stock of fish, which might hurt the flesh trade. Mat. took the hint—ah, he's a sensible spirited fellow as ever sold thirteen ounces for a pound; and can afford to live genteelly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, notwithstanding what you say, I am for peace and plenty. You shall hear my thoughts on that subject, in a song taught me by our vicar, as hearty an old blade as ever wore black, or used a tobacco-stopper.</P>

<P>I like the tune and your singing, master Til∣well,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
but the words are horribly against trade; I would not have them sung in one of our com∣mittees for ten quarters of wheat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Committees!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we have seven every week; the fore-stalling one meets Sunday afternoon, at Isling∣ton, to tax Monday's market at Smithfield; on Monday the staff-of-life committee meet in Mark Lane, to settle how much a quarter; on Tues∣day the coal committee, to pray for strong east∣erly winds three months together the beginning of winter; Wednesday the provender committee, to settle hay, straw, and oats; Thursday the Billingsgate committee, to price fish; Friday the monopolizing committee, to engross hops; and on Saturday the brewing committee, to make, as soon as possible, beer four pence a pot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, some of us are bad enough in the country; but here, I find, you famish one an∣other by rule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fair game, master Tilwell, the public is very fair game. But you don't like the subject, I see; till you think better of it, we'll change it—I had almost forgot to wish you joy.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has he got a good bargain of tobacco?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I find their hurry and joy have made them forget you.—The lottery ticket you gave your youngest daughter Anna, is come up a blank—that to Deborah, your eldest, twenty thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Twenty thousand pounds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; the tobacco trade was given up in three days, a house was taken near Grosvenor-Square in three more, a French valet, a French cook, an Italian waiting woman, and a long &amp;c. have been engaged within the last week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me! I must go immediately to this new shop of politeness.—Fortune seldom grants her favours right, else poor Anna, who deserves ten times as much as Deb. would have had the prize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I promised to call at the Exchequer to day about it—for it must be sold immediately—and I'll meet you at Dan's in less than two hours.</P>

<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A French cook! a French valet! and an Italian waiting woman!—Why good luck has turned the brains of the ideots, if they ever had any, upside down—But this methodical minister of famine; what must I think of him? that no monster in human shape can exceed that man who labours to increase the misery, and to prey on the vitals of the poor.

<P>Very free at first sight!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Free! Oh la, as free as any thing: she asked me to take a glass of wine; I could not for shame refuse her; so she told me she was a knight and baronet's daughter, that she would take me to her papa's house in something square, but was afraid till she knew how the land lay.
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Why she told me such things as would make one's hair stand an end; about one man flying ten feet high on a rope; another jumping with a ladder like any thing; and another, O la! riding full speed with his head on a pint pot; and other most wonderful conjurations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you are quite sure of her?</P>

<P>An emblem of your happy disposition, Madam, which never admits a cloud to hang on it.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am tolerably at ease, Sir Francis, and strive to keep myself so; there is no occasion to pur∣sue care, it too often falls in our way unsought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly right—but you are philosophical on every occasion; the calmness, or rather pleasure, with which you heard your sister's good fortune, is a peculiar instance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I had formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o expectations, the disap∣pointment of my chance was easily borne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so easily, Madam: though you have given me but very distant expectation of being made happy by your fair hand, yet I should be much more unsatisfied if hope was turned up a positive blank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Francis, the world calls you a man of honour, and I believe you one, believe your professions are sincere, however beyond what I can merit; but, Sir, that father who brought me up with the utmost tenderness, claims a share in the disposal; especially as I'm sure he'll never do it against my inclinations.</P>

<P>Far be it from me to infringe upon his just and natural authority; had I your leave, his opinion should be soon consulted.</P>

<P>Your father, Madam, so soon expected! May I be indulged with liberty to ask his opinion of the proposals I have made for you to share my fortune and my heart.</P>

<P>I never shed a tear since my boyhood, except when thy poor mother died; now, my good girl, thou hast filled my eyes with the water of joy.</P>

<SPEAKER>LISINI.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Sir, you'll have no occasion for a Signora.—Shall I have the Soho lodging—three meals a day—a sedan—a black boy with a white <HI>turbot</HI> upon his head? ha! ha! ha!

<P>What's the meaning of all this?</P>

<SPEAKER>LISINI.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Gentleman wanted an Italian mistress, so made proposals to me, while I spoke broken English.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mistress! why he could not have gone fur∣ther if he had been really a Lord. Well, Dan. what do you expect to do now?—I suppose all the tobacco is gone in trumpery.</P>

<SPEAKER>DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every quid.

<P>Look you, friend Drugger, don't be quite cast down; if your relations here will help you to a couple of hundred, I can pop you into a snug public house at Wapping; and I think you'll make a pretty little smart skinker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I can run up and down stairs as tightly as any one of my inches.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could cry for madness—Grosvenor-square changed for Wapping. Our nobles are come to nine-pence with a witness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so bad as you think; some Wapping landladies are very fine.</P>

<P>True; I have seen 'em myself with a ring upon every singer.</P>

<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, tho' on the supposed advance of your fortune you have treated me rather ungenteelly, yet I pity your situation, and shall recommend it to Sir Francis's notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, it has already struck me: Mr. Drug∣ger, that you may not be obliged to enter again into trade, which you so imprudently left, I'll settle upon you the interest of ten thousand pounds, and the principal at your decease on your son, provided he is put under the guardian∣ship of his aunt here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must I be a gentleman still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the stile you have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad of it, I shall have my arms at liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Down on your knees, and thank such noble and generous friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>She may—if I do I can't get up again, my French coat won't let me.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must not I have one peep more at the dear sweet Pantheon?</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, we'll enjoy the entertainment of this evening, as already proposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cousin Drugger, come down to our neigh∣bourhood, and I'll lead you such a fox-chace—if you don't break your neck, you shall stand a fair chance of doing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DRUGGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty sport that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adod, my heart's so full that I can't <HI>say,</HI> so I'll try if I can <HI>sing</HI> what I think.</P>
