<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been, for some time, a labourer in the Drama, and finding it necessary to con∣tinue my labours, I cannot help endeavouring to guard the past from misrepresentation, lest my supineness may injure the future. Con∣scious that a prejudice has been created against the Play which I now submit to the Reader, and conscious how far I am innocent of raising it, it were stupid to sit down in silence, and thus tacitly acknowledge myself guilty of dulness;— dumbly confess I have been deficient in the knowledge of my trade, damn myself for a bungling workman, and fix a disrepute upon every article which may, hereafter, come from my hands.</P>
<P>Thanks to you, Ladies and Gentlemen! you have been kind customers to me; and I am proud to say that you have stamped a fashion upon my goods. Base, indeed, and ungrateful were the attempt, after your favours, so long received and continued, to impose upon you
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
a clumsy commodity, and boast it to be ware of the best quality that I ever put up to sale! No— on the word of an honest man, I have bestowed no small pains upon this <HI>Iron Chest,</HI> which I offer you. Inspect it; examine it; you see the maker's name is upon it. I do not say it is perfect; I do not pretend to tell you it is of the highest polish; there is no occasion for that:— many of my brethren have presented you with mere <HI>linings for chests,</HI> and you have been con∣tent:—but, I trust, you will find that my <HI>Iron Chest</HI> will hold together, that it is tolerably sound, and fit for all the purposes for which it was intended.</P>
<P>Then how came it to fall to pieces, after four days wear?—I will explain that:—but alas! alas! my heart doth yearn, when I think on the task which circumstance has thrust upon me.</P>
<P>Now, by the Spirit of Peace, I Swear! were I not doomed to explore the rugged wind∣ings of the Drama, I would wrap myself in mute philosophy, and repose calmly under the dark shade of my grievance, rather than endure the pain, and trouble, of this explanation.— I cannot, however, cry "Let the world slide:" I must pursue my journey; and be active to clear away the obstacles that impede my progress.</P>
<P>I am too callous, now, to be annoyed by those innumerable gnats and insects, who daily dart their impotent stings on the literary traveller; and too knowing to dismount, and waste my time in whipping grasshoppers:—but here is a scowling, sullen, black Bull, right athwart my road;—a monster of magnitude, of the Boeotian breed, perplexing me in my wander∣ings through the entangled labyrinth of Drury!
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
he stands sulkily before me, with sides, seem∣ingly impenetrable to any lash, and tougher than the Dun Cow of Warwick!—His front out-fronting the brazen bull of Perillus!—He has bellowed, Gentlemen! Yea, he hath bellowed a dismal sound! A hollow, unvaried tone, heaved from his very midriff, and striking the listener with torpor!—Would I could pass the animal quietly, for my own sake!—and, for his, by Jupiter! I repeat it, I would not will∣ingly harm the Bull.—I delight not in baiting him.—I would jog as gently by him as by the ass that grazes on the common: but he has obstinately blocked up my way—he has already tossed and gored me, severely—I must make an effort, or he batters me down, and leaves me to bite the dust.</P>
<P>The weapon I must use is not of that bril∣liant, and keen quality, which, in a skilful hand, neatly cuts up the subject, to the delight, and admiration, of the bye-standers: It is a homely cudgel of Narrative; a blunt batoon of Matter of fact; affording little display of art in the wielder; and so heavy in its nature, that it can merely claim the merit of being appropriate to the opponent at whom it is levelled.</P>
<P>Pray, stand clear!—for I shall handle this club vilely: and if any one come in my way, he may chance to get a rap, which I did not intend to bestow upon him. Good venal and venomous gentlemen, who dabble in ink for pay or from pique, and who have dubbed yourselves <HI>Criticks,</HI> keep your distance now! Run home to your garrets!—Fools! ye are but <HI>Ephemera</HI> at best; and will die soon enough, in the paltry course of your insignificant natures, without thrusting
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
your ears (if there be any left you) into the heat of this perilous action.—A vaunt!—well, well, stay if ye are bent upon it, and be pert and busy;—your folly, to me, is of no moment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye who impartially, and conscientiously, sit in diurnal judgment upon modern dramatists, apply not this to your∣selves. It aims only at the malevolent, the mean, and the ignorant, who are the disgrace of your order.</NOTE></P>
<P>I hasten now to my Narrative.</P>
<P>I agreed to write the following Play, at the instance of the chief Proprietor of Drury-Lane Theatre; who, unconditionally, agreed to pay me a certain sum for my labour:—and this certain sum, being much larger than any, I believe, hitherto offered on similar occasions, created no small jealousy among the Parnassian <HI>Sans Culottes</HI>; several of whom have, of late, been vapidly industrious to level, to the muddy surface of their own Castalian ditch, so <HI>Aris∣tocratico-Dramatick</HI> a bargainer. The Play, as fast as written, (piecemeal) was put into re∣hearsal: But let it here be noted, gentle reader! that a rehearsal, in Drury-Lane, (I mean as far as relates to this Iron Chest) is <HI>lucus à</HI> non <HI>lucendo.</HI> They yclep it a rehearsal, I conjecture, because <HI>they do</HI> NOT <HI>rehearse.</HI> I call the loved shade of Garrick to witness; nay, I call the less loved presence of the <HI>then</HI> acting Manager to avow,—that there never was one fair rehearsal of the Play.—Never one rehearsal, wherein one, or two, or more, of the Performers, very essential to the piece, were not absent: and <HI>all</HI> the rehearsals which I attended, so slovenly, and irregular, that the ragged master of a theatrical Barn, might have blushed for
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
the want of discipline in the pompous Director of His Majesty's Servants, at the vast and astonishing new-erected Theatre-Royal, in Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>It is well known, to those conversant with the business of the stage, that no perfect judg∣ment can be formed of the length of a Play, apparent to the spectator, nor of the general <HI>effect</HI> intended to be produced, until the private repetitions, among the actors, have reduced the business into something like <HI>lucidus ordo:</HI>— then comes the time for the judicious author to take up his pruning-knife, or handle his hatchet. Then he goes lustily to work, my masters! upon his curtailments, or additions; his trans∣positions, his loppings, his parings, trimmings, dockings, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. As in the writing, so in the rehearsal.</P>
<Q><L>"Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor;"</L>
<L>"Ut jam nunc dicat, jam nunc debentia dici"</L>
<L>"Pleraque differat, et praesens in tempus omittat:"</L>
<L>"Hoc amet, hoc spernat, promissi carminis Auctor."</L></Q>
<P>But, woe is me! while I was patiently wait∣ing the expected crisis, a circumstance occurred which compelled me to watch a crisis of a less agreeable nature. A fever attacked me, as I sat beneath the damp dome of Drury, and drove me, <HI>malgrè moi,</HI> to bed; where I lay during a week, till three hours before the Play was exhibited. In addition to the unavoidable injury arising from the author's absence, Mr. KEMBLE, the acting-manager, and principal performer in the piece, was, and had been for a few days, previous to my own illness, confined
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
to his chamber, by indisposition. I lay little stress, indeed, upon his temporary incapacity to perform his managerical duty; his mode of dis∣charging it, hitherto, was productive of little benefit to me;—Still it was <HI>some</HI> drawback— for were a mere Log thrown amidst a Thespian community, and nominated its dull and ponder∣ous Ruler, still the block, while in its place, would carry some sway with it:—but his non-attendance as an actor, so much engaged in the Play, was particularly detrimental.</P>
<P>Nay, even the Composer of the musick— and here let me breathe a sigh to the memory of departed worth and genius, as I write the name of STORAGE—even he, could not preside in his department. He was preparing an early flight to that abode of harmony, where choirs of Angels swell the note of welcome to an honest, and congenial spirit.</P>
<P>Here then was a direct stop to the business? No such thing. The Troops proceeded with∣out leaders: In the dark, <HI>Messieur.!—"Sans</HI> eyes, <HI>Sans</HI> every thing." The Prompter, it is true, a kind of non-commissioned officer, headed the Corps, and a curious march was made of it!</P>
<P>But, lo! two days, or three, (I forget which) previous to the public representation, up rose King KEMBLE! like Somnus from his ebon bed, to distribute his dozing directions among his subjects.</P>
<Q><L>"Tardâ gravitate jacentes"</L>
<L>"Vix oculus tollens;"</L>
<L>"Summaque percutiens nutanti pictora mento,"</L>
<L>"Excussit, tandem, sibi se; cubitoque levatus," &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8"/>He came, saw, and pronounced the Piece to be ripe for exhibition. It was ordered to be performed immediately. News was brought to me, in my sickness, of the mighty <HI>Fiat</HI>; and, although I was told, officially, that due care had been taken to render it worthy of public attention, I submitted with doubt and trembling to the decree. My doubts, too, of this boasted care, were not a little increased by a note, which I received from the Prompter, written by the Manager's order, <HI>three hours only,</HI> before the first representation of the Play:—wherein, at this late period, my consent was, abruptly, requested to a transposition of two of the most material scenes in the second act: and the reason given for this curious proposal was, that the present stage of Drury—where the Architect and Machinist, with the judgment and ingenuity of a Politician and a Wit to assist them, had combined to outdo all former theatrical out∣doings—was so bunglingly constructed, that there was not time for the carpenters to place the lumbering frame-work, on which an Abbey was painted, behind the representation of a Library, without having a chasm of ten minutes in the action of the Play; and that in the middle of an act.—Such was the fabrication of that New Stage, whose <HI>"extent</HI> and <HI>powers"</HI> have been so vauntingly advertised, under the classick management of Mr. KEMBLE, in the edifying exhibition of Pantomimes, Processions, Pageants, Triumphal Cars, Milk white Horses, and Elephants!</P>
<P>As I did not chuse to alter the construction of my Play, without deliberation, merely to skreen the ill-construction of the House, I would
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
not listen to the modest, and <HI>well timed</HI> demand, of turning the progress of my fable <HI>topsy turvy.</HI></P>
<P>Very ill, and very weak, from the effects of the fever, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, yet, left me, I made an effort, and went to the Theatre, to witness the performance. I found Mr. KEMBLE, in his dressing-room, a short time before the curtain was drawn up, taking <HI>Opium Pills:</HI> and, nobody who is acquainted with that gentleman will doubt me when I assert, that, they are a medicine which he has long been in the habit of swallowing. He appeared to me very unwell; and seemed, indeed, to have imbibed,
<Q><L>"Poppy and Mandragora,"</L>
<L>"And all the drowsy syrups of the world."</L></Q></P>
<P>The Play began; and all went smoothly, till a trifling disapprobation was shewn to the character personated by Mr. DODD;—the scene in which he was engaged being much <HI>too long:</HI> A proof of the neglect of those whose business it was to have informed me (in my unavoidable absence from the Theatre) that it appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the <HI>last rehearsals,</HI> to want curtail∣ment. I considered this, however, to be of no great moment; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. KEMBLE was to appear immediately in a sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quent scene, and much was expected from his execution of a part, written expressly for his powers.</P>
<P>And, here, let me describe the requisites for the character which I have attempted to draw, that the world may judge whether I have taken a wrong measure of the personage whom I pro∣posed to fit: premising that I have worked for him before, with success, and, therefore, it
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
may be presumed that I am somewhat acquaint∣ed with the dimensions of his qualifications.— I required, then, a man
<Q><L>"Of a tall stature, and of sable hue,"</L>
<L>"Much like the son of Kish, that lofty Jew."</L></Q>
A man of whom it might be said,
<Q><L>"There's something in his soul"</L>
<L>"O'er which his melancholy sits, and broods."</L></Q></P>
<P>Look at the actor;—and will any body do him the injustice to declare that he is deficient in these qualifications? It would puzzle any author, in any time or country, from Aeschylus down, even, to the Translator of <HI>Lodoiska</HI>—and really, gentlemen, I can go no lower—to find a figure and face better suited to the purpose. I have endeavour'd, more-over, to pourtray <HI>Sir Ed∣ward Mortimer</HI> as a man stately in his deport∣ment, reserved in his temper, mysterious, cold, and impenetrable, in his manner: and the can∣did observers, I trust, will allow that Mr. KEMBLE is thouroughly adequate to such a personation.</P>
<P>To complete my requisitions, I demanded a performer who could enter into the spirit of a character proceeding upon romantic, half-witted principles, abstracted in his opinions, sophisticated in his reasonings, and who is thrown into situa∣tions where his mind and conduct stand, tiptoe, on the extremest verge of probability. Here, surely, I have not mistaken my man; for if I am able to form any opinion of him, as an Actor,—and my opinion, I know, is far from
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
singular,—his chief excellence almost approaches that style which the learned denominate <HI>Carica∣ture.</HI> Possibility on the stretch, passion over-leaping it's customary bound, movements of the soul, sullen, or violent, very rarely seen in the common course of things, yet still <HI>may</HI> be seen —in these is his element. As our language is said to have sunk under the vast conception of MILTON, so does the modesty of nature suffer a depression beneath the unwieldy imaginings of Mr. KEMBLE. He seldom deigns to accompany the Goddess in her ordinary walks; when she decently paces the regular path, with a sober step, and a straight person: but he kindly assists her when she is, doubtless, in need of assistance —when she appears out of her way, crazy and crooked.</P>
<P>The arrogant fault of being more refined than Refinement, more proper than Propriety, more sensible than Sense, which, nine times in ten, will disgust the spectator, becomes frequent∣ly, an advantage to him, in characters of the above description.</P>
<P>In short, Mr KEMELE is a paragon-repre∣sentative of the <HI>Lusus Naturae:</HI> and were Mr. KEMBLE sewed up in a skin, to act a hog in a pantomime, he would act a hog with six legs better than a hog with four.</P>
<P>If any one ask why I chose to sketch a <HI>Lusus Naturae</HI> when it might better become an author to be chaste in his delineation, I can only reply that, I did so to obtain the assistance of Mr. KEMBLE in his best manner; and that now, I do most heartily repent me: for never, sure, did man place the main strength of his building upon so rotten a prop!</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>Well, the great actor was discovered, as <HI>Sir Edward Mortimer,</HI> in his library. Gloom and desolation sat upon his brow; and he was habited, from the wig to the shoe-string, with the most studied exactness. Had one of King CHARLES the First's portraits walked from its frame, upon the boards of the Theatre, it could not have afforded a truer representation of ancient and melancholy dignity.</P>
<P>The picture could not have looked better— but, in justice to the picture, it must also be added, that, the picture could scarcely have acted worse.</P>
<P>The spectators, who gaped with expectation at his first appearance, yawned with lassitude before his first <HI>exit.</HI> It seemed, however, that illness had totally incapacitated him from per∣forming the business he had undertaken. For his mere illness he was entitled to pity; for his conduct under it, he, undoubtedly, deserved censure.</P>
<P>How can Mr. KEMBLE, as a Manager, and an Actor, justify his thrusting himself forward in a new Play, the material interest of which rested upon his own powers, at a moment when he must be conscious that he had no powers at all?—Mr. KEMELE owes a duty to the publick, to his employer, and to an author writing for his employer's house. How does he treat the claimants upon his service, in this instance? Exactly, thus—he insults the understanding of the first, and injures the interests of the two last, by calling in a crowd to an entertainment which he knows he must mar.</P>
<P>I requested him, at the end of the first act, to order an apology to be made for his indispo∣sition,
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
lest the uninformed or malicious, might attribute the ponderosity of the performer to the heaviness of the author. I was anxious to disavow all right and title to those pigs of lead which did not belong to me, and of which Mr. KEMBLE was the just proprietor. But no—he peremptorily declared he would not suffer an apology to be made! It should have been made (if at all) before the play began.—Then why was it not made?—He did not, <HI>then,</HI> imagine that illness would have disabled him.—So, then, a man quits his chamber, after an attack which has, evidently, weakened him extremely, and he has no bodily feel, no internal monitor, to whisper to him that he is feeble, and that he has not recovered sufficient strength to make a violent exertion!—This mode of reasoning, adopted by Mr. KEMBLE, is much in the spirit of that clown's, who did not know whether he could play on the fiddle 'till he tried. Be it noted, also, that Mr. KEMBLE was swallowing his opium pills, <HI>before</HI> the play began, <HI>because he was ill:</HI>—but opium causes strange oblivious effects; and these pills must have occasioned so sudden a lapse in Mr. KEMBLE's memory, that he forgot when he took them, why he took them, or that he had taken them at all.—The dose must have been very powerful.—Still, for the reasons already stated, I pressed for an apology; still Mr. KEMBLE continued obstinate in opposing it. His indisposition, he said, was evident; he had coughed very much upon the stage, and an apology would make him <HI>"look like a fool.."</HI></P>
<P>Good-nature in excess becomes weakness; but I never yet found, in the confined course of
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
my reading, that good-nature and folly would bear the same definition: Mr. KEMBLE, it should seem (and he produced, at least, mana∣gerical <HI>authority</HI> for it) considered the terms to be synonimous. Freely, however, forgiving him for his unkindness, in refusing to gratify a poor devil of an author,—who, very anxious for his reputation, was very moderate in his request—I do, in all christian charity, most sincerely wish that Mr. KEMBLE may never find greater cause to <HI>look like a fool</HI> than an apology for his indisposition.</P>
<P>At length, by dint of perseverance, I gained my point. A proprietor of the Theatre was called in upon the occasion, whose mediation in my favour carried more weight with the Acting Manager than a hapless Dramatist's entreaty; and the apology was, in due form, delivered to the audience.</P>
<P>One third of the Play, only, was yet per∣formed; and I was, now, to make up my mind, like an unfortunate traveller, to pursue my painful journey, through two stages more, upon a broken-down Poster, car whose back lay all the baggage for my expedition. Miserably, and most heavily in hand, did the Poster pro∣ceed!—He groaned, he lagged, he coughed, he winced, he weezed!—Never was seen so sorry a jade! The audience grew completely soured, and, once completely soured, every thing, naturally, went wrong. They recurred to their disapprobation of poor DODD—and ob∣serve what this produced. I must relate it.</P>
<P>Mr. KEMBLE had just plodded through a scene, regardless of those loud and manifest tokens that the Criticks delight not in the
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
<HI>"drowsy hums"</HI> with which he <HI>rang night's "yawning peal,"</HI> when DODD appeared to him on the Stage; at whose entrance the clamour was renewed. Then, and <HI>not till then,</HI> did the Acting Manager, who had been deaf as any post to the supplications of the author for an apology—then did he appear suddenly seized with a fit of good nature. He voluntarily came forward <HI>"to look like a fool,"</HI> and beg the indulgence of the town. He feared he was the unhappy cause of their disapprobation; he entreated their patience, and hoped he should shortly gain strength, to enable them to judge, on a future night, what he handsomely termed the <HI>merits</HI> of the Play. Here was friendship! Here was adroitness! While the Publick were testifying their disgust at the Piece, through the medium of poor DODD, Mr. KEMBLE, with unexampled generosity, took the whole blame upon his own shoulders, and heroically saved the author, by so timely an interposition. I was charmed with this master-stroke, and, at the impulse of the moment, I thanked him. But, alas! how narrow is the soul of man! how distrustful in its movements, how scanty in its acknowledgments, how perplexing to itself in its combinations! Had I, afterwards, looked on the thing simply and nakedly, by itself, why the thing is a good-natured thing: but I must be putting other circumstances by the side of it, with a plague to me! I must be puzzling myself to see if all fits; if all is of a piece. And what is the result?—Miserable that I am! I have lost the pleasure of evincing a gratitude, which I thought I owed, because I no longer feel myself a debtor. Had I abandoned my mind
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
to that placid negligence, that luxurious con∣fidence, which the inconsiderate enjoy, it had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE, fore∣seeing, perhaps, that an aggrieved author might not be totally silent—steped forward with this speech to the publick, as a kind of <HI>salvo,</HI> (should a statement be made) for his rigidity in the first instance. It had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE was sufficiently hissed, yawned at, laughed at, and coughed down, to have made his apology <HI>before</HI> Mr. DODD appeared: It had never occurred to me that his making his apology at a previous moment would have answered the same purpose to <HI>me,</HI> and not to <HI>him:</HI> It had never occurred, in short, that there is such a thing as ostentatious humility, and a politick act of kindness; and that I should have waited the sequel of a man's conduct, before I thanked him for one instance of seeming good will, close upon the heels of stubborn ill-nature, and in the midst of existing, and palpable injury. The sequel will shew that I was premature in my acknowledgment—but before I come to the sequel, a word or two (I will be brief) to close my account of this, the first night's, eventful history. The Piece was concluded, and <HI>given out,</HI> for a second performance with much oppo∣sition.</P>
<P>Friends, who never heard the Play read, shook their heads; Friends, who <HI>had</HI> heard it read, scarcely knew it again: Several, I doubt not, of the impartial, who chose to be active, actively condemned; and enemies, of course, rejoiced in an opportunity of joining them.</P>
<P>No opportunity could be fairer. The Play was, at least, a full hour too long; and had
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
<HI>Job</HI> himself sat to hear it he must have lost his patience. But, if, gentle reader, thou possessest <HI>Job's</HI> quality, and hast followed me thus far, in my Narrative, it will appear to thee (for I doubt not thy retention and combination) that I was unable to curtail it effectually, at the pro∣per time—the last rehearsals. I was, then, laid flat, my dear friend, as you remember I have told you, by a fever. The Acting Manager did attend the last rehearsals, and suffered the piece to be produced, <HI>uncut,</HI> to "drag its slow length along" surcharged with all his own incapacity, and all his opium.</P>
<P>How, then, do I stand indebted, according to the articles of this night's statement? I owe to Mr. KEMBLE,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>For his illness,</HI> COMPASSION,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>For his conduct under it,</HI> CENSURE,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>For his refusing to make an apology,</HI> A SMILE!</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>For his making an apology,</HI> A SNEER,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>For his mismanagement,</HI> A GROAN,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>For his acting,</HI> A HISS.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This account is somewhat like the Tavern bill, picked from Falstaff's pocket, when he is snorting behind the arras. There is but one halfpenny worth of compassion to this intolera∣ble deal of blame.</P>
<P>Now for the sequel.—I have shewn, I think, that Mr. KEMBLE, in the first instance, under∣took a duty which he <HI>could</HI> not perform: I have now to affirm, with all the difficulty of proving a negative full in my face, that he afterwards, made a mockery of discharging a duty which he <HI>would</HI> not perform.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="18"/>After a week's interval, to give him time to recruit his strength; and the Author time to curtail, and alter, the Play; (for the impression which the Mis-Manager and Actor, had con∣trived to stamp rendered alteration necessary) it was a second time represented.</P>
<P>I must, here, let the uninformed reader into a secret;—but I must go to Newmarket to make him understand me.—No, Epsom will do as well; and that is nearer home.—It often hap∣pens, at a Race, that a known Horse, from whom good sport is expected, disappoints the crowd by <HI>walking over the course.</HI>—He does not miss an inch of the ground; but affords not one jot of diversion, unless some pleasure is received in contemplating his figure. Now, an actor can do the very same thing. He can <HI>walk over his part:</HI> He can miss no more of his words than the Horse does of his way: he can be as dull, and as tedious, and as good-looking as the Horse in his progress:—The only difference between the two animals is,—that the Horse brings in him who bets upon him a gainer; but the luckless wight who has a large stake depend∣ing upon the actor is, decidedly, certain to lose. There is a trick, too, that the Jockies practise, which is called, I think, <HI>playing booty.</HI> This consists in appearing to use their utmost en∣deavour to reach the winning-post first, when they are already determined to come in the last. The consequence is, that all, except the know∣ing ones, attribute no fault to the Jockey, but damn the Horse for a sluggard.—An actor can <HI>play booty</HI> if he chuses:—he can pretend to whip and spur, and do his best, when the Connoisseur knows, all the while, he is shirking:—but
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
Sluggard is the unmerited appellation given by the majority to the innocent author..</P>
<P>Mr. KEMBLE chiefly chose to be Horse, and <HI>walked over the ground.</HI> Every now and then (but scarcely enough to save appearances) he gave a slight touch of the Jockey, and <HI>played booty.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the language which is put into the mouth of <HI>Sir Edward Mortimer</HI> be above mediocrity, or below contempt, is not to the present purpose: but the words he is made to utter certainly convey a meaning; and the cir∣cumstances of the scenes afford an opportunity to the Performer of playing off his mimick emotions, his transitions of passion, his starts, and all the trickeries of his trade. The devil a trick did Mr. KEMBLE play but a very scurvy one! His emotions and passions were so rare, and so feeble, that they seasoned his general insipidity, like a single grain of wretched pepper thrown into the largest dose of water-gruel that ever was administered to an invalid. For the most part, he toiled on, line after line, in a dull current of undiversified sound, which stole upon the ear far more drowsily than the distant mur∣murings of Lethe; with no attempt to break the lulling stream, or check its sleep-inviting course.</P>
<P>Frogs in a marsh, flies in a bottle; wind in a crevice, a preacher in a field, the drone of a bagpipe, all, all yielded to the inimitable, and soporific monotony of Mr. KEMBLE!</P>
<P>The very best Dramatick writing, where passion is expressed, if delivered languidly by the Actor, will fail in it's intended effect: and I will be bold enough to say that were the <HI>Curse in King Lear</HI> new to an audience, and they heard
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
it uttered, for the first time, in a croak, fainter than a crow's in a consumption, it would pass unnoticed, or appear vapid to the million.</P>
<P>If I raise a critical clatter about my ears, by this assertion, which some may twist into a profanation of Shakspeare, I leave it to Horace, who can fight battles better than I, to defend me.</P>
<Q><L>"Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta,"</L>
<L>"Romani tollent pedites equitesque cachinnum."</L></Q>
<P>That Mr. KEMBLE did not misconceive the Part is certain; for he told me, some time before the Play was acted, that he feared the exertions requisite, in <HI>Sir Edward Mortimer,</HI> would strain his lungs more than <HI>Octavian,</HI> in the <HI>Mountaineers.</HI></P>
<P>That he can strain his lungs, to good purpose, in <HI>Octavian,</HI> is well known; and, after this, his own intimation, how will he escape the charge of wilful and direct delinquency, when, with such a conception of the Part, and with health recovered, he came forward in the true spirit of <HI>Bottom,</HI> and <HI>"aggravated his voice so that he roared you as gentle as any sucking dove?"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. KEMBLE informed me, previous to the second re∣presentation of the Play, that he felt himself capable of exertion.</NOTE></P>
<P>He insulted the Town, and injured his Em∣ployer, and the Author, sufficiently in the first instance: in the second he added to the insult and injury an hundred-fold: and as often as he mangled the Character (three or four times, I am uncertain which, after the first night's per∣formance) he heaped aggravation upon aggrava∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>The most miserable mummer, that ever disgraced the walls of a Theatre, could not have been a stronger drawback than Mr. KEMBLE.— He was not only dull in himself, but the cause of dulness in others. Like the baleful <HI>Upas of Java,</HI> his pestiferous influence infected all around him. When two Actors come forward, to keep up the Shuttle cock of scenick-fiction, if one plays slovenly, the other cannot maintain his game. Poor BANNISTER, Jun. would he speak out (but I have never pressed him, and never shall press him to say a word upon the subject) could bear ample testimony to the truth of this re∣mark. He suffered like a man under the cruelty of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zentius.</HI> All alive himself, he was tied to a corpse, which he was fated to drag about with him, scene after scene, which weighed him down, and depressed his vigour. Miss FARREN, too, who might animate any thing but a soul of lead, and a face of iron, experienced the same fate.</P>
<P>I could proceed, and argue, and reason, and discuss, and tire the reader, as I have tired my∣self (it is now, my good friend, one o'clock in the morning) to prove, further, that Mr. KEMBLE was unsound in my cause, and that he ruined my Play:—But I will desist here. I think I have <HI>prosed</HI> enough to manifest that my argu∣ments are not unfounded.</P>
<P>They who are experienced in <HI>Dramaticks</HI> will, I trust, see that I have made a fair <HI>extenua∣tion</HI> of myself—they who are impartial will, I hope, be convinced that I have set down <HI>nought in malice.</HI></P>
<P>The only question that may arise to shake, materially, the credit of all I have said, is—
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>
"How is it probable that Mr. KEMBLE should injure you thus, without provocation? Is it in nature? Is it in man?" I can merely answer that I am unconscious of having given him cause for provocation; that if I have given him cause, he has taken a bad mode of revenge; that Mr. KEMBLE's nature has frequently puzzled me in my observation upon it; and that I think him a very <HI>extraordinary man.</HI></P>
<P>But let him take this with him, should this crudely written Preface ever fall in his way. I have committed it to paper <HI>currente calamo.</HI> I mean no allusion, no epithet, to apply to him as a private individual. As a private individual I give him not that notice which it might, here, be impertinent to bestow:—but I have an un∣doubted right to discuss his merits, or demerits, in his publick capacities of Manager and Actor: and my cause of complaint gives me a good reason as well as right. His want of conduct, his neglect, his injustice, his oppression, his finesse, his person, his face, are in this point of view all open to my animadversion.</P>
<Q><L>"He is my goods, my chattlels;"</L>
<L>"My Horse, my Ox, my Ass, my any thing."</L></Q>
<P>And I would animadvert still further, did I not think I had already said sufficient to gain the object of guarding my own reputation. That object has solely swayed me in dwelling so long upon a "plain tale," encumbered with so fatiguing a Hero as JOHN KEMBLE.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB REF="23"/>
<HEAD><HI>ADVERTISEMENT</HI> TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I AM indebted for the ground-work of this Play to a Novel entitled <HI>"Things as they are, or the Adventures of Caleb Williams; written by William Godwin."</HI> Much of Mr. GODWIN's story I have omitted; much, which I have adopted, I have compressed; much I have added; and much I have taken the liberty to alter.</P>
<P>All this I did that I might fit it, in the best of my judgment, to the stage.</P>
<P>I have cautiously avoided all tendency to that which, vulgarly, (and wrongly, in many in∣stances) is termed Politicks; with which, many have told me, <HI>Caleb Williams</HI> teems.</P>
<P>The stage has, now, no business with Poli∣ticks: and, should a Dramatick Author en∣deavour to dabble in them, it is the Lord Chamberlain's office to check his attempts, before they meet the eye of the Publick. I perused Mr. GODWIN's book, as a tale replete with interesting incident, ingenious in its arrange∣ment,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="24"/>
masterly in its delineation of character, and forcible in its language. I considered it as right of Common; and, by a title which cus∣tom has given to Dramatists, I enclosed it within my theatrical paling. However I may have tilled the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, I trust he discovers no intentional injury to him, in my proceeding.</P>
<P>To all the Performers (excepting Mr. KEMBLE) I offer my hearty thanks for their exertions; which would have served me more, had not an actor, <HI>"dark as Erebus,"</HI> cast a gloom upon them, which none of their efforts, however brilliant, could entirely disperse.</P>
<P>But this does not diminish my obligations to them:—so much, indeed, I owe to them, that, when the Play was last performed, it was rising, spite of <HI>Erebus,</HI> in favour with the Town. It was, then, advertised, day after day, at the bottom of the Play-bills, for repetition, till the promissory advertisement became laughable; and, at length, the Advertisement and the Play were dropt together.</P>
<P>If, after the foregoing Preface, I should at a future period, bring the Play forward in the Hay-market Theatre, I am fully aware of the numbers who from party and pique, may now oppose it. I am aware, too, of the weight which a first impression leaves upon the minds of the most candid:—Still, so strong is my confidence in the genuine decision of a London audience, who have a fair opportunity of ex∣ercising their judgment and feelings, (which they have not had, yet, in respect to this Play) that I believe I shall venture an appeal.</P>
<P>The Piece is, now, printed as it was acted on the <HI>first night</HI>; that they who peruse it may
<PB N="xxvii" REF="25"/>
decide whether, even in that shape, (with all the misfortunes, before enumerated, with which it was doomed to struggle) it should be, for ever, consigned to moulder on the shelf.</P>
<P>The Songs, Duets, and Chorusses, are in∣tended merely as vehicles for musical effect. Some criticks have pompously called them <HI>Lyrick Poetry</HI>—that by raising them to dignity they may more effectually degrade them: as men lift a stone very high, before they let it fall, when they would completely dash it to pieces.</P>
<P>I, now, leave the gentle reader to the perusal of the Play—and, lest my Father's memory may be injured by mistakes; and, in the con∣fusion of after-times, the <HI>Translator of Terence,</HI> and the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>The Jealous Wife,</HI> be sup∣posed guilty of the <HI>Iron Chest</HI>; I shall, were I to reach the Patriarchal longevity of Methusa∣leh, continue (in all my Dramatick publications) to subscribe myself</P>

<P>Sdeath! why meet my daughter in the forest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Because I love her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Raw.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would ruin her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a strange way of shewing one's love, methinks. I have a simple notion, Gilbert, that the thought of having taken a base advantage of a poor girl's affection might go nigh to break a man's sleep, and give him unquiet dreams: now, I love my night's rest, and shall do nothing to disturb it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Raw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would'st not poison her mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not my method, friend, of dosing a patient. Look ye, Gilbert; Her mind is a fair flower, stuck in the rude soil, here, of surrounding ignorance, and smiling in the chill of poverty:— I would feign cheer it with the little sun-shine I possess of comfort and information. My parents were poor like her's; Should occasion serve, I might, haply, were all parties agreed, make her my wife. To offer aught else would affect her, you, and myself; and I have no talent at making three people uneasy at the same time.</P>

<P>I know his malice. He would oppress me with his power. He would starve me and my family. Search my house.</P>

<P>Harkye—he is my master. I owe him my gratitude;—every thing:—and had you been any but my Barbara's father, and spoken so much against him, my indignation had work'd into my knuckles, and cram'd the words down your rusty throat.</P>

<P>Hush, Rawbold. Keep your counsel.— Should you make it publick he must notice it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Did he not notice it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter—but he has sent me thus early, Gilbert, with this relief to your distresses, which he has heard of. Here are twenty marks for you and your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Raw.</SPEAKER>
<P>From Sir Edward Mortimer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis his way;—but he would not have it mention'd. He is one of those judges who, in their office, will never warp the law to save offenders; but his private charity bids him assist the needy, before their necessities drive them to crimes which his public duty must punish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Raw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did Mortimer do this! did he! heaven bless him! Oh, young man, if you knew half the misery—my wife—my children—Shame on't! I have stood many a tug, but the drops now fall in spite of me. I am not ungrateful; but I cannot stand it. We will talk of Barbara when I have more man about me. <STAGE>Exit up the stair-case.</STAGE></P>

<P>I tell thee, then, our good Sir Edward was beloved in Kent, where he had returned a year before from his travels. Madam Helen's uncle was hated by all the neighbourhood, rich and poor. A mere brute, dost mark me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough: but when brutes walk upon two legs, the law of the land, thank Heaven! will not suffer us to butcher them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go to, you fire-brand! Our good master labour'd all he could, for many a month, to soothe his turbulence; but in vain. He pick'd a quarrel with Sir Edward, in the publick county assembly; nay, the strong ruffian struck him down, and trampled on him. Think on that, Wilford; on our good master Sir Edward, whose great soul was nigh to burst with the indignity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the end on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, our young master took horse, for his own house, determined, as it appear'd, to send a challenge to this white-liver'd giant in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see. He kill'd him in a duel. That's another kind of butchery, which the law allows not; true humanity shudders at, and false honour justifies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>See, now, how you fly off! Sir Edward's revenge, boy, was baffled. For his antagonist was found dead in the street, that night; killed, by some unknown assassins, on his return from the assembly.</P>

<P>Indeed! <HI>unknown</HI> assassins!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, 'tis plain, our good Sir Edward had no hand in the wicked act: for he was tried, as
<PB N="21" REF="47"/>
I told you, at the next assize. Mercy on me! 'twas a crowded court; and both gentle and simple threw up their caps, at his acquital! Heaven be thank'd! he was cleared beyond a shadow of doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was; I breathe again. 'Twas a happy thing. 'Twas the only way left of cleansing him from a foul suspicion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out alas! lad, 'tis his principal grief. He is full of nice feeling, and high-flown honour: and the thought of being tried, for such a crime, has given him his hear's wound. Poor gentleman! he has shun'd the world ever since. He was once the life of all company—but now!</P>

<P>No matter; he will be back on the instant. Leave this idle guzzling, if you have any shame. Think we are attending madam Helen, in her visit to Sir Edward, on his sudden sickness.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! nothing but evil. These attacks come on our worthy master as thick as hail, and weaken him daily. He has been grievous ill, in the night, poor soul! and ne'er slept a wink since I brought him the news.</P>

<P>What call you his old symptoms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wint.</SPEAKER>
<P>The shivering, and trembling its, which have troubled him these two years. I begin to think the air of this forest doth nourish agues. I can never move him to drink enough of canary. I think, in my conscience, I had been aguish myself, in these woods, had I not drank plenty of canary.</P>

<SPEAKER>Barb.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, brother! be not so uncharitable. I know not what is against him, but he has not been heard yet. Consider too—were all our actions, at home, to be sifted, I fear me, we might not escape blameless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sams.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but he, it seems, is falling, and we are upon the rise; and that makes all the difference. Mass! how gingerly men will sift the faults of those who are getting up hill in the world; and what a rough shake they give those who are going down∣ward!</P>

<L>Yesterday,</L>

<L>And found this Wilford, this young man, whose state,</L>
<L>Whose orphan state, met pity in my house,</L>
<L>'Till pity grew to friendship,—him I found,</L>
<L>Fix'd o'er the chest, upon his knees, intent,</L>
<L>As, now, I think, on plunder; tinging theft</L>
<L>Still blacker with ingratitude; and rifling</L>
<L>The easy fool who shelter'd him. Confusion</L>
<L>Shook his young joints, as he let fall the lid,</L>
<L>And gave me back the key.</L>

<L>Did you not search</L>

<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<L>No:—for, first,</L>
<L>(Habit so long had fix'd my confidence)</L>
<L>I deem'd it boyish curiosity;—</L>
<L>But told him this would meet my further question:</L>
<L>And, at that moment, came a servant in,</L>

<L>Sir, I did.</L>
<L>Wilford was pale and trembling; and our master</L>
<L>Gave him a look as if 'twould pierce him through;</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="114"/>And cried, "Remember."—Then he trembled more,</L>
<L>And we both quitted him.</L>

<L>You found me somewhat ruffled.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis most true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<L>But somewhat more when, afterwards, I saw</L>
<L>Wilford conversing with you—like a snake,</L>
<L>Sun'd by your looks, and basking in your favour.</L>
<L>I bade him quit the room, with indignation,</L>
<L>And wait my coming in the library.</L>

<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I witness'd that, with wonder.</P>

<L>You little thought, while you so gently school'd me,</L>
<L>In the full flow of your benevolence,</L>
<L>For my harsh bearing tow'rd him, on what ground</L>
<L>That harshness rested. I had made my search,</L>
<L>In the brief interval of absence from you,</L>
<L>And found my property had vanish'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<L>We'll—</L>
<L>You met him in the library?</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>O never</L>
<L>Can he forget that solemn interview!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wilf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, speak to that:—it was a solemn in∣terview.</P>

<P>It was a theme of—No. <STAGE>checking himself.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mort.</SPEAKER>
<L>He pleaded innocence:</L>
<L>While every word he spake belied his features,</L>
<L>And mock'd his protestation. I restrain'd</L>
<L>The chastisement he fear'd; nor wou'd I blazon</L>
<L>The wrong I could not fix; and subject, thus,</L>
<L>By general inquiry, all the guiltless</L>
<L>To foul suspicion. That suspicion lay</L>
<L>Most heavily on him; but the big cloud</L>
<L>Of anger he had gather'd burst not on him,</L>
<L>In vengeance to o'erwhelm him: chill it drop'd,</L>
<L>But kindly, as the dew, in admonition;</L>

<L>When love enforces them to ruggedness.</L>

<L>"Regulate your life,</L>
<L>"In future, better. I, now, spare your youth;</L>

<L>Trust me, brother,</L>
<L>This charge is staggering. Yet accidents</L>
<L>Sometimes combine to cast a shade of doubt</L>
<L>Upon the innocent. May it be so here!</L>
<L>Here is his trunk: 'twas brought here at my order.</L>
<L>'Tis fit that it be search'd.</L>
</SP>

<L>O, that were needless.</L>
<L>He were a shallow villain that would trust</L>

Sir Edward's brother will explain further to you: I cannot. But believe this:—Heaven, to whose eye the dark move∣ments of guilt are manifest, will ever watch over,

and succour the innocent, in their extremity. Cla∣mour not now your congratulations to me, I entreat you: Rather, let the slow, still voice of gratitude be lifted up to Providence, for that care she ever bestows upon those deserving her protection!</P>
