<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Nature of this Work seeming to render something of a Preface necessary, I shall, for that Reason, intirely dedicate it to the Ser∣vice of the Reader, in as few Words as possibly I can.</P>
<P>Having formerly written a short Essay u∣pon the Royal Family of <HI>STEWART,</HI> to which was prefixed an Historical Account and Description of the Shire of <HI>Renfrew:</HI> I had no sooner publish'd that little Book; than several Persons of eminent Distinction for their Learning and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation, for whose Judgment I had the most profound Regard, set upon me to write <HI>A Peerage of SCOTLAND,</HI> a Book very much wanted; which at length, by their Importunity and promised Assistance, I was prevailed with to undertake.</P>
<P>When I first set about this Work, as I did entirely devote and dedicate my Time to the Study of Antiquities, particularly those of our own Country, so I made it my Business to collect all those Historical and Genealogical Tracts that had been done on the No∣bility, that I could come to the Knowledge of. The Oldest of that Kind I have met with, was a few loose Sheets on the Ge∣nealogies
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
of our Nobility, said to be done by <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Ochil∣tree,</HI> in the Hands of my very worthy Friend, and one of our best Antiquaries, Mr. <HI>Baillie</HI> of <HI>Castlecary;</HI> but the Accounts even of the few Families that Lord treats of, are very lame; and I observe where he goes much higher than his own Time, they are purely traditional, and therefore I could not depend on them.</P>
<P>I perused also the large Genealogical Collections concerning the Nobility, by Sir <HI>James Balfour,</HI> who was Lord Lyon King at Arms, in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. but they are written so very loosely, and I have seen them contradicted so frequently by Writs and Charters, that I give them but little Credit. I sup∣pose Sir <HI>James</HI> never intended these Papers should have gone fur∣ther than his own Closet, for he was a Learned and Curious Gentleman, as appears from his Annals, in which he is much more exact, especially as to what occurred in his own Time.</P>
<P>I procured likewise a Copy of the Historical Essay on the Prin∣cipal Families of the Kingdom, Alphabetically digested, by the learned Lord Advocate, Sir <HI>George Mackenzie</HI> of <HI>Rosehaugh;</HI> but I apprehend these Papers have been only some first Draught of a greater Work Sir <HI>George</HI> intended, which he lived not to finish: Of this there are many Copies in several Hands, the most exact by very far of any of them I have seen, was that which I had the Use of from <HI>Thomas Crawfurd</HI> of <HI>Cartsburn,</HI> my Brother, who by his own Reading and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation, has rectified a great many of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Mistakes, at least of his Amanuensis, and has with great Accuracy, em∣bellished his own Copy with a vast deal of fine Historical Re∣marks, that it well deserves the Character of a curious Ma∣nuscript.</P>
<P>I had moreover a Sight of the Genealogies of the Nobility, collected by Mr. <HI>Dunlop,</HI> the late Principal of the College of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> who was Historiographer for <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Gentle∣man of great Integrity and Learning, and an excellent Antiquary. I understand he intended to have written <HI>A Peerage of SCOT∣LAND,</HI> and for that End made very full Collections on that Subject: But I observe that most of Mr. <HI>Dunlop</HI>'s Accounts are composed of those Genealogical Descents that the Nobility have in their own Families, and are handed about by their Friends; and that ingenious Gentleman did with great Accuracy and Judg∣ment,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
add Historical Memoirs to the Genealogies, which give them a great Ornament; and he is very exact as to his Autho∣rities. The M.S. was communicated to me by my very worthy Friend, Mr. <HI>Dunlop,</HI> the present Professor of <HI>Greek</HI> in the Uni∣versity of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> the Principal's Son.</P>
<P>But after I had made all those Collections I have mentioned, and a great deal more of that Kind, I cannot stay to particu∣larize, I found I had not any tolerable Foundation for the car∣rying on the Work I had undertaken, for the Honour of the Country, (the Design it was principally for) or my own Repu∣tation; and therefore, by the Advice and Direction of my in∣genious Friends, who had engaged me in the Design, I did with as much Humility and Modesty as I was Master of, address every Peer by myself or some Friend, for the Assistance of their own Charters and Writings, to enable me to do their Families Justice in this Undertaking.</P>
<P>Such Helps as I sought were very generously afforded me by the greater Part of the Nobility, who allowed me the Perusal of their Charter-Chests and original Writings, from which I com∣posed the Accounts of their Families as they stand in my Book. Severals indeed I did not see; some were unwilling to shew their Family Writs for divers Reasons, some were Minors, others were Abroad, and out of the Country; and even to such I have done all the Justice was possibly in my Power. But if the Ac∣counts of such Families, whose Charters I have not had Access to, be shorter and less connected than others, that was what cannot be supposed I could help: I took Care timeously to ad∣vertise every Body concerned, and if they did not incline to shew me their Writs, the Blame cannot be laid on me.</P>
<P>But that I might be the better able to carry on the Work I had undertaken with Advantage, and to form Accounts of those noble Families whose Writs I had not seen, and to supply, if a <HI>Hiatus</HI> did happen, (as it frequently did) in such Families whose Writings I had perused I searched all the Publick Offices and Libraries about <HI>Edinburgh</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">By the Publick Offices I mean the Registers of the Great Seal, which I perused from the Charters of King <HI>Robert</HI> I. down to our own Times, in the Laigh Parliament-House, and in the Chancery; I look'd over also the Records of the Justiciary, and all the Chartularies in the Lawyers Library.</NOTE>, and noted every Thing as ex∣actly
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
as I could; and the Keepers of these Offices were so obliging as to allow me Access at all Hours, ordinary and extraordinary, whenever I call'd, and to whom therefore I do, with all due Gratitude, return my most humble and hearty Acknowledg∣ments.</P>
<P>But after all my Labour, I am so far from being so vain as to imagine this Essay is not capable of any further Improvement, that on the contrary I am sensible, I have, thro' Inadvertency, and the Errors of the Press, especially in Dates and Proper Names of the present Age, fallen into many Mistakes; but I beg the ingenious Reader will pardon these Omissions, which are inevitable in such Books, and where he discovers an Error, he will correct it with his Pen.</P>
<P>Perhaps some may think, that I have been fuller upon some Families, (even some that are extinct) than on others who are much more ancient than those I enlarge more upon. The Reason is plain, the Representatives, Relations, or Descendents of those noble Families shew'd me their Writs, and encouraged my De∣sign. If others had done so, I doubt not but I should have been able to have done them as full, and vouched them as well. For I can say, and do here declare on the Word of a Gentleman, That I had no Regard in the doing of Justice in my Province as an Author, to the Encouragement I received from any Man, otherwise than to reckon myself very much obli∣ged to such; and I own I did not spare either Time or Pains to discover any Particular, I thought could give an Ornament to the Antiquity, or a Lustre to the Honour of their Families.</P>
<P>But where I have been assisted from the Publick Records or Authentick History, I have been as full on those Families who never incouraged the Design, as I have been upon those who gave me the greatest Assistance every Way; and for the Truth of this, I can and do appeal to severals of the Nobility them∣selves, who will find very long deduced, and well vouched De∣scents of their Families, in this Peerage, who never encouraged my Undertaking in any Degree. But as I said before, That I had had no Respect to; for my chief and only Regard was, and shall be Truth, and the Honour of our Country, as far as I am capable to discover the one, or defend the other.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
As to the Work it self, I shall say nothing: But after so great Labour, and Expence of Time, the Essay (being new and never before attempted) how defective soever it may be, I cannot but hope, will meet with a favourable Reception from the Ingeni∣ous, and more particularly have the Approbation and Coun∣tenance of Persons of Distinction, who frequently read such Books, and know how useful and acceptable Undertakings of this Kind have ever been accounted in all the Polite Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

At the unfortunate Ad∣venture of <HI>Philiphaugh</HI> he was taken Prisoner, and tried and condemn'd by the Parliament to be executed, but was so happy as to make his Es∣cape the very Night before his Execu∣tion, in his Sister's Dress, and again engaged in the same Service, and with the same Affection: And after very great Sufferings sustained with great Firmness and Constancy, he liv'd to see the King restored.

<HEAD>STEUART, Duke of <HI>Albany.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE First who enjoyed this Title, was <HI>Robert Stewart,</HI> third Son of King <HI>Robert</HI> II. by <HI>Elisabeth Mure,</HI> who in Right of <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife, Grandchild and Heir of <HI>Allan</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
Earl of <HI>Menteth,</HI> came to that Ho∣nour, and had the Earldom of <HI>Fife,</HI> by the Resignation of the Countess of <HI>Fife;</HI> both which Titles he used, till he was rais'd to a higher Honour.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Menteth</HI> was a Person of great Parts and Spirit, which he manifested in all his Actions, both in Peace and War. His Father the King had so great an Esteem of his Abilities, that in his old Age, he made him Governor of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and he continued in the Administration till the Death of the King.</P>
<P>Upon the Accession of his Bro∣ther <HI>Robert</HI> III. to the Crown, the King being aged and valitudinary, thought fit to continue the Earl of <HI>Fife</HI> his Brother in the Regency, and further dignified him with the Title of Duke of <HI>Albany, Anno</HI> 1399, and he discharged that great Trust very well throughout the Whole of his Brother's Reign; and the Prince King <HI>James</HI> I. being a Prisoner in <HI>England</HI> at the Time of his Father's Death, the Duke came of Right to be Governor of the Kingdom, and he enjoyed the Office till his Death, <HI>September</HI> 3d, <HI>Anno</HI> 1420.</P>
<P>He married first <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daugh∣ter and Heir of the Earl of <HI>Menteth</HI> aforesaid, by whom he had <HI>Murdack</HI> his Successor, and several Daughters, <HI>Isobel</HI> married to <HI>Alexander</HI> Earl of <HI>Ross,</HI> and again to Sir <HI>Walter Halli∣burton</HI> of <HI>Dirleton, Marjory</HI> to Sir <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> of <HI>Lochow,</HI> and <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> to Sir <HI>Malcolm Fleming</HI> of <HI>Big∣gar;</HI> next, <HI>Mauriella,</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>William Keith</HI> Mareschal of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> by her he had <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Buchan,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Stewart</HI> Kt.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Albany</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Murdack</HI> his Son, both in his Estate and in the Government of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but he came very far short of his Fa∣ther, for being a weak Man, and of small Parts, was scarce able to go∣vern his own Family, much less the Kingdom: But that which should attone for all his Oversights, and pre∣serve his Memory from all unkind Reflections, was the glorious Part he acted, in conducing so much toward the Restauration of King <HI>James</HI> I. in which he was the great Instru∣ment. Not long thereafter, the King growing jealous of the Duke's Power, which no doubt was very great, and discovering some treasonable Intrigue in which he was concern'd, he was first put under Arrest, and sent Priso∣ner to the Castle of <HI>Carlaverock;</HI> and being shortly after brought to his Trial, he was found guilty of High-Treason by his Peers, for which he lost his Head on the 19th <HI>May</HI> 1425.</P>
<P>This great but unfortunate Duke, married <HI>Isobel,</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Duncan</HI> Earl of <HI>Lennox,</HI> by whom he had Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> who being found accessory to their Father's Treason, both suffer'd Death for the same, and Sir <HI>James</HI> who fled to <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he spent the after Part of his unfortunate Life, and left a Son behind him, Sir <HI>Andrew Stew∣art</HI> of <HI>Stratheven,</HI> who came over to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> II. who afterward rose to great Wealth and Honour, and laid the Foundation of the Family of <HI>Evan∣dale</HI> and <HI>Ochiltree.</HI></P>
<P>The next illustrious Brench of the Royal Family who enjoy'd this Title, was <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> second Son to King <HI>James</HI> II. who was cre∣ated Duke of <HI>Albany, Anno</HI> 1452, which he afterwards forfaulted for his unnatural Rebellion against his Brother King <HI>James</HI> III. and all his Measures being broke, he retired to <HI>France,</HI> where he liv'd till his Death. He left Issue by <HI>Katharine,</HI> Daughter of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> from whom he was divorced, a Son <HI>Alexander,</HI> who was declared illegitimate, and thereupon he enter'd into Orders, and was made Bishop of <HI>Murray.</HI> Also by <HI>Anne</HI> his second Wife, Daughter

to the Count de <HI>Bulloign,</HI> the Duke left a Son.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Albany,</HI> to whom the Administration of the Affairs of the Kingdom was committed in the Minority of King <HI>James</HI> V. and he discharged that great Trust with in∣vincible Constancy and Courage, till the King came to Age, that he reti∣red into <HI>France,</HI> where he had a fair Fortune in Right of his Wife. In the Service of that Crown he exer∣cised the highest military Commands under <HI>Francis</HI> I. with great Honour and Reputation, even till his Death, <HI>Anno</HI> 1536. The Title by Reason he had no lawful Issue, did extinguish with him.</P>
<P>The next who had this Honour by Creation, was that comely and graceful Prince, <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> whom Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> a few Days be∣fore she took him to be her Husband, did with great Solemnity invest in the Title of Duke of <HI>Albany;</HI> which ceas'd again upon his Marriage, that he was proclaim'd King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had his Name put upon the Coin with the Queen's; <HI>Henricus &amp; Maria Rex &amp; Regina</HI> Scotorum.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> the second Son of King <HI>James</HI> VI. was in the Third Year of his Age, <HI>Anno</HI> 1601, created Duke of <HI>Albany,</HI> and he bore the Title till by the Death of that incom∣parable Prince, Prince <HI>Henry</HI> his elder Brother, he became Prince and Stew∣ard of <HI>Scotland, Anno</HI> 1612; after which this Title lay dormant, till his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> II. on the Re∣stauration, did create his Royal Bro∣ther <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Duke of <HI>Albany,</HI> by Letters Patent 31st of <HI>December</HI> 1660<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub.

<HEAD>CAMPBELL, Duke of <HI>Argyle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS noble antient Family is de∣riv'd from a Series of illustrious Ancestors, who possess'd <HI>Lochow</HI> in <HI>Ar∣gyle</HI>-Shire, according to the traditio∣nal Accounts by the <HI>Bards</HI> and <HI>Sana∣chies,</HI> as early as the Time of King <HI>Fergus</HI> II. who restor'd our Monar∣chy, <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 404.</P>
<P>The first Appellation they us'd was <HI>O Dwbin,</HI> which, according to an early Custom they assum'd from <HI>Diarmed O Dwbin,</HI> one of their Ancestors, a brave and warlike Man, who flou∣rish'd under King . . . . from whom they are in the <HI>Irish</HI> Language call'd to this Time, <HI>Seol Diarmed,</HI> that is, the Posterity and Offspring of <HI>Diarmed.</HI></P>
<P>From this <HI>Diarmed O Dwbin,</HI> the <HI>Bards</HI> have recorded a long Series of the Barons of <HI>Lochow</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I have seen a very ancient Manuscript History of the Family of Argyle, that derives them from a very long Train of Ancestors, much farther back than can be vouched by Writings or Re∣cords, and seems to be founded upon the traditional Accounts of the Sanachies and Bards, whose Office consisted chiefly in recording the Actions and Atchievements of the great Men of the respective Families to whom they were attach'd.</NOTE>, whose Acti∣ons they tell us, were very renown'd both for Valour and Courage.</P>

<P>From this <HI>Colin</HI> it is that the Head of the Family of <HI>Argyle</HI> are call'd by the <HI>Irish, MackCallan More</HI> even to this Time.

<P>But no sooner did King <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> assert his Title to the Crown, and form a rational Project of re∣covering his own Right, and of re∣deeming his Country from the Sub∣jection it was under to a Foreign Power, than Sir <HI>Neil Campbel</HI> was among the earliest Patriots, who first resorted to him, own'd his Title, and gave quickly so many Proofs of his Zeal and Merit, for the Liberty and Honour of his Country, and of his Loyalty to that heroick Prince; insomuch that he was thought most worthy, and pitched upon to com∣mand a Party of Loyalists that were sent to <HI>Argyle</HI>-Shire, to curb and o∣verawe the Lord of <HI>Lorn</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Arch Deacon Barber's Life and Atchievements of King Robert Bruce.</NOTE>, who was a declared Enemy to his Coun∣try, and of Consequence to the <HI>Bru∣cian</HI> Title; and he perform'd that Service committed to him with Ho∣nour and Success, insomuch that in a short Time he recovered the Countries of <HI>Argyle</HI> and <HI>Lorn,</HI> and brought them to submit to King <HI>Robert,</HI> notwithstanding the joint Efforts of the Lord <HI>Lorn,</HI> and his numerous Accomplices on the con∣trary<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dr. Abercromby's Atchievements of the Scots Nation.</NOTE>; which shews him to have been a very resolute and hardy Patriot: After which Sir <HI>Neil</HI> stuck close to King <HI>Robert,</HI> and was among the few

Not long after he was nam'd a Privy Counselour, and one of the Commissioners of the Tresaury, which for many Years he discharged with great Fidelity, and thro' all Changes appear'd an earnest Espouser of the Protestant Interest: For seeing to what Pass things were like to come, he propos'd in a Committee of Council, that to the Test might be added some Acts against Popery, which was so ill taken, that all methods imagin∣able were devis'd to ruin him, which at last was effected, under a Pre∣tence of his putting his own Sense and Explanation upon the Test, when he took <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE> it in these Words,</P>
<P><HI>I have consider'd the Test, and am desirous to give Obedience, as far as I can; I am confident, the Parliament never intended to impose contradictory Oaths; and therefore I think no Man can explain it, but for himself, and re∣concile it, as it is genuine, and agrees in its own Sence; and I take it so far as it is consistent with it self, and the</HI> Protestant Religion: <HI>And I do declare, I mean not to bind up my self, in my Station, but in a lawful Way, to endeavour any thing I think for the Ad∣vantage of the Church or State, not repugnant to the</HI> Protestant Religion, <HI>and my Loyalty: And this I under∣stand, as part of my Oath.</HI></P>

<P>Upon Her Majesties Accession to the Throne, he was nam'd a Privy Counsellour, and 8 <HI>December</HI> 1702. constituted Lord Privy Seal, and the 30 <HI>April</HI> 1703, created Duke of <HI>Athole,</HI> and in 1704, elected Knight of the most noble Order of St. <HI>Andrew.</HI></P>
<P>In the Parliament 1706, which concluded the Union of the Crowns, he was one of the Peers who made a very strong and vigorous Opposition to it, and on the 4 <HI>November,</HI> when the first Article of the Treaty, was Enacted and Ratified, his Grace enter'd this Protestation, which from the Records of Parliament I transcribed.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> John <HI>Duke of</HI> Athole, <HI>Protest for my self and all others who shall adhere to this my Protestation, that an Incor∣porating Union of the Crown of</HI> Scotland <HI>with the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>and that both Nations should be represented by one and the some Parliament, as con∣tain'd in the Articles of the Treaty of Union is contrary to the Honour, Inte∣rest, fundamental Laws and Constituti∣ons of this Kingdom, the Birth-right of the Peers, the Privileges of the Ba∣rons and Burgesses, and</HI> Act 10. Parl. 8. Ja. 6. <HI>it is ordain'd, that none of the Leiges presume to take upon them to im∣pugn the Dignity and Authority of the Three Estates of Parliament, or to seek or procure the Diminution of the Power and Authority of the said Three Estates under the pain of Treason, and is con∣trary to the Claim of Right, Property and Liberty of the Subject. And the</HI> 3<HI>d. Act of Her Majesty</HI>'s <HI>Parliament,</HI> 1703, <HI>it is thereby declared high Treason in any of the Subjects of this Kingdom to quarrel or impugn, or endea∣vour by writing, or malicious and advis∣ed speaking, or any other open Act or Deed to innovate the Claim of Right in any Article thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Likeas on the 7 <HI>January,</HI> 1707, when the 22d. Article of the Treaty of Union in relation to the Number of Representatives for <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> came to be debated, the Duke gave in this Protest, which in Justice to his Grace I could not forbear to insert.</P>
<P><HI>Forasmuchas the Peers of this Realm who are Hereditary Members of Her Majesty's great Council and Parliament do hereby become Elective, and so Her Majesty is deprived of Her born Counsellours, and the Peers of their Birth-right: And whereas at present they are</HI> 160 <HI>in Number, they are by this Article reduced to</HI> 16, <HI>which</HI> 16 <HI>are to be joined with the House of Lords in</HI> England, <HI>whose Number at present consists of above</HI> 180, <HI>whereby its plain, that the</HI> Scots <HI>Peers share in the Le∣gislative and Judicative Powers in the</HI> British <HI>Parliament is very unequal, to that of the</HI> English, <HI>tho the one be Re∣presentative of as Free and Indepen∣dent a Nation as the other, and is therefore a plain Forfaulture of the Peer∣age of this Kingdom, contrary to the</HI>

<P>Which <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Belhaven,</HI> I find did particularly signalize himself both in the Parliament 1681 and 1685, discovering then a firm Resolution to support the Protestant Religion. In 1689 he assisted at the meeting of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility at <HI>London,</HI> and concur∣red with them in addressing the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to call a Convention of the Estates in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the set∣ling the Government there.</P>
<P>His Lordship was present at the Convention, where he contributed much to the setling the Crown upon King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who upon their Accession thereto, consti∣tuted him one of their Privy Council, and one of the Commissioners for exe∣cuting the Office of Register.</P>
<P>Upon Her Majesty's accession to the Throne, he was named a Privy Counsellour, and after that, one of the Commissioners of the Thesaury, which he executed with no little Ap∣probation.</P>
<P>In the Parliament 1706, when the Union came to be debated, he joined with those who opposed it, and on this Subject made several learned and elaborate Speeches containing his Reasons, for which Posterity will celebrate his Name with Honour as a Patriot of his Country.</P>

of General <HI>Fairfax,</HI> was born at <HI>Den∣ton</HI> Castle, 17<HI>th January</HI> 1611, and going into the Low Country Wars in 1627, gave then (tho but sixteen Years old) such Proofs of a great Spirit and Martial Genius, as occasion∣ed his being particularly noticed by the Lord <HI>Vere,</HI> above-mentioned, one of the greatest Captains of that Age, whose Daughter he afterwards married.</P>
<P>In 1640 he was knighted (his Father being then on Life) and the civil Wars beginning not long after, he came soon, to make no small Figure in them, by the many Proofs he gave, of his great Courage and Conduct, in the Service of the Parliament, whose Cause he early espoused, and in 1645, being then but 34 Years of age, was chosen supreme General of their Armies, which he command∣ed, with great Success and Glory, till 1650, in which time, he performed such Actions, as wanted nothing but a better Cause, to have made his Fame immortal: But War being then de∣creed against <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Parlia∣ment, and an Army appointed to march thither, he declared his Re∣solution not to command it, or in∣vade that Kingdom, and, thereupon, laid down his Commission, which, soon after, was bestowed on <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> then Lieutenant General under him:</P>
<P>What the Reasons were, that in∣duced this great Man, to lay down so high and important a Command, was at that time, variously, reported, some (as <HI>Clarendon</HI> relates) impu∣ting it, to his Affection and Kindness to <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which he had always been a great favourer, and whereof he was born a Peer; but others, to his not being satisfied, with the Parliaments, having pusht things, so far, against the King, and to his, secretly, favouring the Interest of his Son K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. then admitted to the Government in that Kingdom, and crowned there; which Opinion was confirmed, by the Part he afterwards acted at the Restau∣ration; In order to which, he en∣tered, very early, into Measures with General <HI>Monk,</HI> to whom he gave con∣siderable Assistance, in the Prosecu∣tion of that glorious Design, upon the happy issue whereof, he had the Honour, to be one of the Commis∣sioners which composed the solemn Deputation, sent by the Parliament to the King, upon that great Oc∣casion, and arriving at the <HI>Hague,</HI> was received by his Majesty, with singular Favour and Goodness, and great Marks of Honour and Esteem, which he ever after continued to wards him; notwithstanding where∣of, being weary of the great hurry and Confusion, in which he had spent much of his Time; he re∣tired, soon after the Restauration, to his House in the Country, where, he passed, in peace and quiet, the re∣mainder of his Life, highly beloved and honoured by all good Men, for his many great and heroick Qualities, and shining Vertues, for which, he is justly celebrated, by the greatest Pens of that Age, all sides and Par∣ties agreeing, in giving due Praise, to his consummate Merits.

of this Sirname, when he is accoun∣ting for there old Bearing, which was anciently, <HI>A Man hanging on the Gallows, and was given</HI> (says he) <HI>as a Reward to one of the Progenitors of the Earl of</HI> Carnwath, <HI>to perpetuate the Memory of a brave and hazardous Ex∣ploit perform'd in taking down from the Gallows the Body of a Favorite of King</HI> Kenneth II. <HI>hung up by the Picts. For, as the Story goes, the King being exceedingly grieved that the Body of his Minion and Friend should be so disgracefully treated, he profer'd a considerable Reward to any of his Sub¦jects who would adventure to rescue his Corps, from the Disgrace his Enemies, had put upon him; But</HI> (adds he) <HI>When none would undertake this ha∣zardous Interprise, at last a certain Gen∣tleman came to the King, and said,</HI> Dalziel, <HI>which signifies</HI> I Dare, <HI>and actually did perform that noble Exploit to his immortal Honour: And in Me∣mory of it, got the foresaid remarkable Bearing, and afterward his Posterity took the Word</HI> Dalziel <HI>for their Sir∣name, and the Interpretation of it,</HI> I Dare, <HI>as the Motto of their Family.</HI></P>
<P>But the first of this Name I have found upon Record, was Sir <HI>Robert de Dalziel,</HI> Knight, who faithfully adhering to King <HI>David Bruce,</HI> du∣ring his Captivity in <HI>England,</HI> ob∣tained in Consideration thereof, a Grant from the said Monarch of the Barony of <HI>Selkrig,</HI> of the date 15th <HI>May</HI> 1365<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Rotulis Regis David ad Annum 1365.</NOTE>, his Successor.</P>

<P>He departed this Life the 10th <HI>September</HI> 1654, and was succeeded by</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> his Son and Heir: This noble Lord in the 1654 obtained a Commission from King <HI>Charles</HI> II. during his Exile, to raise what Forces he could for his Majesty's Service, in order to his Restauration, and there∣with joined Lieutenant General <HI>John Middleton,</HI> who sustained a War with the <HI>English</HI> for a whole Year, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were defeated by Colonel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; then his Lordship capitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed with the Enemy upon very honourable Terms. This signal Appearance for his distressed Sovereign, probably seemed one Cause that upon his Ma∣jesty's Restauration, when he consti∣tuted a new Set of Judges in the 1661, he named him one of the Sena∣tors of the College of Justice, and one of the Lords of his Privy Coun∣cil. <HI>Anno</HI> 1678, he was constituted Justice General upon the decease of Sir <HI>Archibald Primrose,</HI> and three Years thereafter he was made Lord Clerk Register, in which Station he continued till the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, <HI>Anno</HI> 1685.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> VII. had no less Value for his Abilities, for in the first Year of his Reign, he renewed his Patent for being Register, and on the 15th of <HI>April</HI> the same Year, created him Viscount of <HI>Tarbat,</HI> Lord <HI>Macleod</HI> and <HI>Castlehaven,</HI> and continued him in that Imployment till the Dissolu∣tion of the Government in 1689.</P>

<P>THIS Sirname was first assumed from the Lordship of <HI>Preston, in Vicecomitatu Edinburgi,</HI> where they have been seated as early as the Reign of <HI>Alexander</HI> III.

<P>Sir <HI>Richard Preston</HI> was a younger Son in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> VI, whose high Advancements to Honour, added no small Lustre to this worthy Fa∣mily. He was educated at the Court, and being of an agreeable and win∣ning Deportment, he soon grew in∣to his Majesty's special Favour, at∣taining first the Honour of Knight∣hood, and e're long, was made one of the Grooms of the Bed-Chamber.

<P>His Father surviving him eight Years, then gave way to Fate, his Estate and Honour devolving upon the present Duke his Grandson, a lively Example of the Valour and Gallantry of his two great Ancestors.

<P>In 1710, he laid Claim to the Honour of Lord <HI>Dingwall,</HI> as being the Heir gradually and lineally descending from <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Dingwall:</HI> Being found to have Right, his Claim was allowed, and accordingly he Voted by his Proxy in the Election of the Sixteen <HI>Scots</HI> Peers, (who by the Treaty of Union are to sit in the House of Peers of <HI>Great Britain</HI>) 10th <HI>November</HI> the same Year.</P>

wrote by a very learned Pen, who equalizes them to any of the ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Families, and gives them the preference to all other in <HI>Europe,</HI> those of crown'd Heads excepted. They have been particularly famous for great Generals, there having been more of this Name, than any other that is to be met with in History; neither was it their native Countrey alone that was indebted to their Va∣lour, but they signaliz'd themselves in most places of <HI>Europe,</HI> and particu∣larly in <HI>France,</HI> where they have had great Commands and Titles, as Duke of <HI>Turrin, Count de Longoville,</HI> &amp;c.

<L>Of one Sirname was ne'er in <HI>Scotland</HI> seen.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Origin of this illustrious House is derived from one <HI>Sholto,</HI> who in the Reign of <HI>Solvathius</HI> King of <HI>Scotland, Anno Christi</HI> 770, having been the principal Man that routed <HI>Donald Bane</HI> and his Forces, who in¦vaded the Countrey, and being a <HI>Dou glass,</HI> or a black pale Man, as these Words signify (says my Author) both in old <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> the King royaly rewarded his Services, and made him a Grant of large Pos¦sessions in the County of <HI>Lanerk,</HI> which either he or his Successors cal∣led <HI>Douglass,</HI> and from thence took the Sirname of the Family. This <HI>Sholto</HI> was the Father of <HI>Hugh,</HI> of whom there is nothing memorable. He was succeeded in his Inheritance by his eldest Son <HI>Hugh</HI> II. whose younger Brother <HI>William,</HI> being sent by <HI>Achaius</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> pursuant to his League with <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> with 4000 choice Men into <HI>Italy</HI> against the <HI>Lombard</HI>'s, he performed many glorious Actions, and became the Root of the Family of <HI>Scoti</HI> at <HI>Pla∣centia.</HI></P>
<P>But to leave the Family of the <HI>Scoti</HI> in <HI>Italy, William</HI> is supposed to be the Son of <HI>Hugh</HI> Lord of <HI>Douglass,</HI> and the Father of <HI>John,</HI> who was the Father of <HI>William,</HI> the next Lord of the Family, who is Witness among others to the Charter of King <HI>William,</HI> whereby he confirm'd the Lands of <HI>Dalgarnac</HI> given by <HI>Adger</HI> the Son of <HI>Dovenald,</HI> to the Church of the Holy Cross at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in the former part of that Reign: He left Issue two Sons, <HI>Archibald,</HI> who succeeded in the Lordship, and <HI>Bricius,</HI> first Prior of <HI>Lisma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agoe,</HI> afterwards Bishop of <HI>Murray</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chartulary of the Episcopal See of Murray, and the Chronicle of Melross.</NOTE>.</P>

and taken into the Number of his Privy Council, where he sojourn'd fif∣teen Years, till the Death of King <HI>James</HI> V. <HI>Anno</HI> 1542. Then returning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, he was Parliamentarily restor'd to his Estate and Titles of Honour, and at the fatal Battle of <HI>Pinkiefield</HI> he commanded the Van-guard of the Army against the <HI>English,</HI> where he behaved very worthily, and living peaceably the remainder of his Days, he departed this Life at his Castle of <HI>Tantallon,</HI> in the 1557, aged 64, and was interr'd at <HI>Abernethy.</HI></P>
<P>This gallant Earl married thrice, his first Wife being <HI>Margaret Hepburn</HI> Daughter of <HI>Patrick</HI> Earl of <HI>Bothwell,</HI> by her he had no Children.

<P>The first time I find this Earl in publick Business, is in 1573, he was constituted Sheriff of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and one of the Wardens on the Borders, which he exerced with an universal Reputation for five or six Years, Ju∣stice never being better administred.</P>
<P>Upon the fall of his Uncle the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> the King grew jea∣lous of him, whereupon he retir'd to <HI>England,</HI> where he was bountifully entertained by Queen <HI>Elisabeth,</HI> and there he had Opportunity to con∣tract a Friendship with the famous Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> very much to their mutual Satisfaction: But after some Years, upon better Information, his Majesty not only restored him to his former Favour and Familiarity, but appointed him Lieutenant on the Borders, which he defended with great Reputation for several Years; but at last being seiz'd with a Sick∣ness, which was thought to be Sor∣cery, he languished under his Distem∣per till about the end of <HI>July</HI> 1588, at which time he gave way to Fate, with the Character of being a good Man in all respects, well versed in Lear∣ning, and tho endowed with many ex∣cellent Qualities, his Piety was al∣lowed to be the reigning Vertue in him.

Upon the turn of the Refor∣mation, in the memorable Year 1560, when both the Doctrine of the Church, and Authority of the Bishop, of <HI>Rome</HI> was parliamentarly abolished; he did eminently signalize himself by his firm Adherence to, and zealous Profession of the Protestant Religion, of which he was a very great Pro∣moter, and of Consequence was a mighty Supporter of King <HI>James</HI> VI's.

<HEAD>SETON, Earl of <HI>Dumfermling.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the Study and Practice of the Law, has raised many to great Wealth and Honour, is evident enough from sundry Examples of that kind; amongst which Sir <HI>Alex∣ander Seton,</HI> the first of this Family is not the least; he was a Younger Son of <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Seton,</HI> by <HI>Isobel</HI> his Wife, Daughter of Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Sorn,</HI> Knight, Lord high Thesaurer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> V. he was educated in <HI>Italy,</HI> where he studied the Laws, in which Profession he became so great a Proficient, that King <HI>James</HI> VI. upon his return home, constituted him one of the extraordinary Lords of the Session, 12th of <HI>March</HI> 1585, that he might thereby come to the knowledge of the Forms here used: After which, in <HI>February</HI> 1587, he was admitted one of the ordinary Senators of the College of Justice, and on the 3<HI>d</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1591, his Majesty advanced him to the Digni∣ty of a Lord of this Realm, by the Title of Lord <HI>Urquhart;</HI> and that he might the better support the Ho∣nour he had conferred on him, that Prince took the first Opportunity to augment his Fortune, and in the 21<HI>st.</HI> of his Reign, upon the Dissolu∣tion of the Monastries, made a Grant to him and the Heirs of his Body, lawfully begotten, of the whole Lands and Tithes of the rich Priory of <HI>Plus∣carden</HI> in <HI>Murray;</HI> his Lordship ascen∣ding still higher in Esteem, in Respect of his eminent Knowledge, was pre∣ferred to be President of the Session, in the Room of <HI>William Baillie</HI> of <HI>Provan,</HI> deceased 12th of <HI>May</HI> 1593; as also in 1595, to be one of the Commis∣sioners of the Thesaury. Rising by these Gradations, in the 36 of the said King, <HI>Anno</HI> 1604, he was advanced to that eminent Post of Lord high Chancellour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and upon the 3<HI>d</HI> of <HI>March</HI> the Year after dig∣nified with the Honour of Earl of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> he was likewise ap∣pointed one of the Commissioners to treat of a nearer Union betwix <HI>Scot∣land</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> which was not compleated at that time; after which continuing in the Chancellours Of∣fice with much Honour, for the full Term of 18 Years, He departed this Life 16th of <HI>June</HI> 1622, and was interr'd at the Paroch Church of <HI>Dal∣gaty</HI> in <HI>Fife,</HI> with great Funeral So∣lemnity.</P>
<P>His first Wife was <HI>Lilias,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Patrick</HI> Lord <HI>Drummond,</HI> by whom he had four Daughters,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Anne,</HI> married to <HI>Thomas</HI> second Earl of <HI>Kelly.</HI></P>

<P>4. <HI>Sophia,</HI> to <HI>David</HI> first Lord <HI>Bal∣cares.</HI></P>
<P>His second Marriage was with <HI>Grisel,</HI> Daughter of <HI>James,</HI> Son and Heir of <HI>Andrew</HI> Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> by whom he had only a Daughter <HI>Jean,</HI> married to <HI>John</HI> first Earl of <HI>Twedale.</HI></P>
<P>He married to his third Wife, <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> Daughter to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Yester,</HI> by whom he had <HI>Charles</HI> his Son and Heir, and a Daughter <HI>Grisel,</HI> who dyed unmarried.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> Earl of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> was succeeded in his Honours and Estate by his Son <HI>Charles,</HI> who upon the breaking out of the Civil War, in 1638, was at first on the Covenanters side: However, such was his Prudence and Moderation, that he endeavour'd to advance all Motions toward a Peace, and was the first Lord in the King's Commission to treat with the <HI>English,</HI> in order to compose the unhappy Differences between his Majesty and his Subjects in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was by his Endea∣vours happily concluded in the Year 1641. And that he might be further

able to serve the King with the Church, he was appointed Commissioner to the General Assembly, <HI>Anno</HI> 1641, wherein he proposed very temperate Counsels, and earnestly recommend∣ed to the Clergy, that in return of all his Majesty's Favours toward their Church, they would make Consci∣ence by their Doctrine and Example to keep the People in their Duty to God and the King, during the suc∣ceeding Times of Anarchy and Usur∣pation. This noble Lord affecting to lead a retired Life, I find no Ac∣count of him in any of the publick Transactions that ensued, but upon the Dawn of the Restauration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. he appeared very forward to express his Loyalty, and to re-establish the old <HI>Scots</HI> Constitu∣tion, to which he firmly adhered, not long after, he was constituted one of the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, and in 1671 made Lord Privy Seal, in the Room of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Marshal</HI> deceased; which Office he enjoy'd till his Death, <HI>Anno</HI> 1674. By <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife, Daugh¦ter of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> he had three Sons and a Daughter,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Alexander,</HI> who succeeded in the Honour, but dyed unmarried.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles,</HI> killed aboard the Fleet in the great Sea Fight against the <HI>Dutch, Anno</HI> 1672.</P>

<P>Which <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> in his Youth, having a Genius to War, he betook himself to Arms in the Service of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was in several memorable Expe∣ditions under the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> but quiting those Military Imploy∣ments, upon his Accession to the Ho∣nour, he lived at home in great Splendor, till the Revolution, in 1688. He was one of the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers who faithfully adhered to the Interest of King <HI>James:</HI> And the Viscount of <HI>Dundee</HI> no sooner took the Field, and declared for the King, than his Lordship brought and join∣ed him with a Troop of Horse, upon the Head of which he was personally engaged in the Battle of <HI>Killicrankie,</HI> where he behaved very bravely, for which he was Forfeited by Authority of the Parliament, 1690. Upon the Capitulation of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> when there was no probability of supporting King <HI>James</HI>'s Interest any longer in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he retired to the Court of St. <HI>Germans</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where the said King, to alleviate his Misfortunes, was pleased to honour his Lordship with the most noble Order of the <HI>Thistlo,</HI> as a distinguish∣ing Mark of his royal Favour (and as he said) <HI>An Earnest of what he in∣tended to do for him and his Family, when it would please God to restore him to the peaceable Possession of his own;</HI> here he sojourned till his Death, in the Year 1694, leaving no Issue that survived him by <HI>Jean</HI> his Wife, Daughter of <HI>Lewis</HI> Marquis of <HI>Hunt∣ly;</HI> so that the Honour by Reason of the entail to Heirs Male, wou'd descend to <HI>George Seton</HI> of <HI>Barns,</HI> de∣scended of Sir <HI>John Seton</HI> Knight, im∣mediate elder Brother to <HI>Alexander</HI> first Earl of <HI>Dumfermling,</HI> were it not for the Forfaulture.</P>

<P>This noble Person served <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. of <HI>France</HI> in the Quality of one of his Pages of Honour; afterward taking himself to the Profession of Arms, he rose gradually to be Colonel Bri∣gadeer, and at last Major General: He was present in most of the Sieges and Actions betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and the Confederates, wherein he acquir∣ed immortal Honour by his unparal∣leled Valour, in 1678. Upon the Conclu∣sion of the Peace with the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Nimiguen,</HI> He was called over to <HI>Britain,</HI> and resided most at Court during the re∣mainder of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign.</P>

<HEAD>SCRIMGEOUR, Earl of <HI>Dundee.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ACcording to the Authority of our Historians, this noble and an∣cient Family derive their Origine from one Sir <HI>Alexander Caron,</HI> a brave and valiant Knight, who in the first of <HI>Alexander</HI> I. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1107, signaliz'd his Valour against the Northern Rebels, who had attemp∣ted no less than the Murder of the King, for which (continue they) he had his Name changed to <HI>Scrimge∣our,</HI> that is a <HI>Sharp Fight;</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore he had a special Grant from the King to himself, and the Heirs Male of his Body, to be hereditary Standard-bearers to the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for his Coat of Arms, <HI>Gules,</HI> a Lyon rampant, <HI>Argent,</HI> holding in his dexter Paw a crooked Sword <HI>Proper,</HI> and the word <HI>Dissipate</HI> for his Motto. Mr. <HI>Johnston</HI> the Poet, has left us the following Verses to the Honour of his Me∣mory,<Q><L>Quid trepidas? da signa mihi, superabimus amnem;</L>
<L>Terreat an pavidos nos fugitiva cohors?</L>
<L>Dixit, &amp; areptis signis ruit acer in hostem,</L>

<P>This Name has been remarkable in our <HI>Scots</HI> History on several other Occasions, particularly Sir <HI>Alexander Scrimgeor,</HI> was among the first who took the Field for King <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> and faithfully adhered to him; in Consideration whereof, when that valiant Prince came to be established on the Throne, he gave him sundry Lands about the Burgh of <HI>Innerkeith∣ing,</HI> then in the Crown, by the Attain∣der of Sir <HI>Philip de Moubray,</HI> Knight. Also Sir <HI>John Scrimgeor</HI> was killed at the fatal Battle of <HI>Halydonhill</HI> 1333; and another Sir <HI>James Scrimgeor</HI> Con∣stable of <HI>Dundee,</HI> his Successor, was slain in the Governours Army against <HI>Donald</HI> Lord of the Isles, at the Battle of <HI>Harlaw, Anno</HI> 1411. I need not be at much Pains to show the several Matches they have made with some of the most noble Families of this Kingdom, since the whole Course of this Book makes mention thereof, only I shall take notice, that in pro∣cess of Time, after having flourished long in the State of Barons, they came to the Honour of Peerage the in Person of Sir <HI>James Scrimgeor</HI> Con∣stable of <HI>Dundee,</HI> who was raised to the Honour of Viscount of <HI>Duddop,</HI> by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in the Year 1641. Upon the breaking out of the Civil War, he accepted of a Command in those Forces that were sent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Aid of the <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament, against the King, and lost his Life in the Battle of <HI>Marstoun Moor,</HI> 2<HI>d July, Anno</HI> 1644, <HI>A Person</HI> (says one) <HI>who for the Nobleness of his Ex∣traction, and many personal Endowments, deserved a better fate, at least to have dyed in a better Cause.</HI> He left a Son <HI>John,</HI> by <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife, Daughter of <HI>Robert</HI> first Earl of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> who succeeded him in the Honour.</P>
<P>This Lord put himself in Arms in behalf of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and march∣ed with him to the Battle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> 3<HI>d September</HI> 1651, after which he suffered much for his Loyalty, but living to see the Restauration, he received some part of amends, being created Earl of <HI>Dundee, Anno</HI> 1661, and made one of the Privy Council. His Wife was <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter of <HI>William</HI> first Earl of <HI>Dalhousie,</HI> but dying without Issue, in 1668, by reason of an Entail of his Estate, which (purely thro' Inadvertency) ter∣minated in the Heirs Male, the King succeeded thereto as <HI>ultimus haeres,</HI> and the Honour became extinct, and lay dormant till the Year 1688, that the Title of Viscount of <HI>Dundee</HI> was bestowed on General <HI>Graham.</HI></P>

<P>Which <HI>John,</HI> after he had gone through the Course of his Studies at the University of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> he went into Foreign Parts to accomplish himself by Travels, betaking himself to a Military Life, he served at first Volunteer in the <HI>French</HI> Service, where he learned the Rudiments of War, after some time he engaged in the Service of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> 1672. His first step to Advancement was a Cornet's Commission in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Guard of Horse; in which Character he did eminently signalize himself in the Battle of <HI>Senef,</HI> fought betwixt the Confede∣rates, under the Command of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> under the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1674; after this he was immediately preferred to be Captain of a Troop of Horse; in which Station he served with the highest Reputation for his Valour. Leaving the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service upon some disgust given him, he came over to <HI>Britain;</HI> by a particular Character from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> he was recommended to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. who was pleased, as a Testi∣mony of the Esteem he had for Mr. <HI>Graham,</HI> to nominate him one of the Captains of the three independent Troops which were raised to force the Dissenters in the Western Shires to comply with the Constitution of the Church, as established by Law, <HI>Anno</HI> 1678, the Earls of <HI>Hume</HI> and <HI>Airly,</HI> having the Command of the other two.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the Year 1689, his Lordship came down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and sat some Days in the Convention of Estates, which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had called, till he discern'd the House disposed by a great Majority to declare the Throne vac∣nat, and Forfault King <HI>James;</HI> as also a Design the Mobb had to As∣sassinate him, of which he informed the Meeting, but his Complaint not being regarded; and Justice denyed him, he absented from the Conven∣tion; and after having had a private Conference with the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> at the <HI>Postern-Gate</HI> of the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which held out for King <HI>James,</HI> he retired to <HI>Linlithgow</HI> with a small Party of Horse, and so by the Way of <HI>Stirling</HI>-Bridge, rode home to his House in the Country, whereupon the Convention voted him an intercommuned Person, and sent a Messenger to require him to appear before them at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> but his Lordship excusing himself u∣pon pretence of Danger, there was a Party sent to apprehend him. This necessarly obliged him to go into the <HI>Highlands</HI> for Refuge, where he raised the Clans by King <HI>James</HI>'s Authority, and having got a Reinforcement of 300 <HI>Irish,</HI> Headed by Colonel <HI>Cannon,</HI> with a Body of about 1600 Horse and Foot, he engaged Major Gene∣neral <HI>Mackay,</HI> who was advancing toward him with 4000 Foot, and some Troops of Horse and Dragoons at <HI>Kilicrankie</HI> in <HI>Athole,</HI> 27<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1689.

<P>His first step to Advancement in martial Affairs, was the Honour of a Colours in the Royal Foot-Guards, which was procured him by his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> while a Youth, rather to humour his forward Inclination that way, than any Advantage to be made by it.

<P>King <HI>William</HI> was no sooner on the Throne, but he was made Gentle∣man of the King's Bed-Chamber; also 9th of <HI>April</HI> 1689, he was raised to the Honour of Earl of <HI>Marlbo∣rough.</HI> The same Year he commanded the <HI>English</HI> Forces in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and was present with Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> at the Shock at <HI>Walcourt:</HI> And <HI>Anno</HI> 1690, was sent General of the Forces to reduce <HI>Cork</HI> and <HI>Kinsale;</HI> which Service he perform'd with great Dis∣patch and Conduct.</P>

<HEAD>MACKDUFF, Thane, afterward Earl of <HI>Fyfe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Thane in Ancient Times, is thought by the learned <HI>Spel∣man</HI> and <HI>Selden,</HI> to have been the King's principal Minister in a Pro∣vince, no doubt invested with a Power of Administration of Justice, to which certain honourary Priviledges were annexed. 'Tis thought it was not at the first Institution, properly a Title of Dignity, but of Service. They were of two kinds, either such as served the King in greater Places of Emi∣nency, who were called <HI>Thani Ma∣jores,</HI> or <HI>Thani Regis,</HI> as the Thanes of <HI>Fife, Caithness, Argyle,</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> were, these that served under them were termed <HI>Thani Minores:</HI> But when the Title of <HI>Comes</HI> and <HI>Dux</HI> be∣came Hereditary (so the Learned are of Opinion) the Title and Privi∣leges of <HI>Thani Majores</HI> did descend with the Lands from Fathers to their Children, tho the lesser did not, yet they still retained the old Name of Thanes and Thanedoms, as the Ba∣ronies of <HI>Boyn</HI> in <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff</HI> shire and <HI>Cal∣der</HI> in <HI>Murray,</HI> &amp;c. are called to this Time: And perhaps the Difference betwixt the two consisted in this, That the greater <HI>Thanes</HI> derived their Power and Authority immediately from the King, and held them of the Crown <HI>in capite,</HI> for Knights Service, which by a certain Constitution made them Hereditary, and were of the same kind with them that after∣ward came to be Parliamentary Ba∣rons. The lesser <HI>Thanes,</HI> had only Commissions from them, and were held in the ordinary way for Services done, and to be done. All our Hi∣stories do agree, that <HI>Mackduff,</HI> former∣ly <HI>Thane,</HI> was created Earl of <HI>Fyfe,</HI> by King <HI>Malcolme Canmore, Anno</HI> 1057<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Balfour and other Scots Historians.</NOTE>, and that in Consideration of his ex∣traordinary Services to that Prince, in assisting him to revenge his Fa∣ther's Death upon <HI>Mackbeth,</HI> and to recover his Crown, for which he gave him and his Heirs these great and noble Privileges,</P>
<P N="1">I. That his Posterity should have the Honour to place the succeeding Kings in the Chair of State, at their Coronations.</P>
<P N="2">II. That they should lead the Van of the Royal Armies.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="154" REF="162"/>
III. That, if any within the 9th. Degree in Relation to his Family, should be guilty of the unpremeditat∣ed Slaughter or casual Homicide of a Gentleman, he should pay twenty four Merks of Silver, and but twelve if a Plebeian, for Expiation of the Crime; flying to a Sanctuary near <HI>Newburgh</HI> in <HI>Fyfe,</HI> on the Confines of <HI>Strathern:</HI> Which was much the same Privilege granted to <HI>Mackduff's</HI> Kin∣dred, as the Cities of Refuge were to the <HI>Isralites, Joshua</HI> 20. At the Place of <HI>Girth,</HI> there was an high Cross erected, containing an Inscription of old <HI>Macaronick</HI> Verses, a Mixture of <HI>Latin, Saxon, Danish,</HI> and old <HI>French</HI> Words, to this Purpose,<Q><L>Maldraradum dragos, Mairia, laghstita, Larges,</L>

<P>This last Privilege was observed as long as the Family existed, and was claimed and enjoyed by severals with∣in the Degree of Consanguinity to the Earls of <HI>Fife</HI> afterward.

<P>AS many Families in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and in most Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> derive their Sirnames from the Lands which their Ancestors pos∣sest, when Sirnames became first fa∣shionable; so 'tis not to be doubted, but the Sirname of <HI>Gray</HI> has the same Derivation: Some are of Opinion, that it took its Rise from a City in the <HI>Franche Compte,</HI> which is still so named; others, and among those <HI>Francis de Bellowforest</HI> derives the Sir∣name of <HI>Gray</HI> from the Castle of <HI>Gray</HI> in <HI>Picardy;</HI> and adds, That one <HI>Rollo,</HI> Chamberlain to <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> who possest the afore∣said Castle, was the first who assum∣ed that Sirname: However, 'tis cer∣tain one <HI>Anchitil de Gray</HI> came over to <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conque∣ror; and that when the general Survey was made in the 20th of that King's Reign, he held many Lands in <HI>Oxford</HI>-Shire and elsewhere; From him many great and illustrious Fa∣milies in <HI>England</HI> are descended, as the Dukes of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> the Barons <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Chilingham</HI> and <HI>Werk,</HI> with their numerous Cadets, whose Names and Heroick Actions are frequently to be met with in the <HI>English</HI> History.</P>
<P>That the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> has his Descent from some of these, can∣not be doubted. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> the great <HI>English</HI> Antiquary, and others of our own Country also, are mista∣ken as to the Time of their Ancestors coming to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as will appear afterward; but they assert, and with great Probability, That the first of this most noble Family was a Son of the House of <HI>Chilingham</HI> (indeed the Armorial Bearing of both Families are still the same); and 'tis obser∣vable, that the Lands of <HI>Browfield,</HI> the first Inheritance of the <HI>Grays</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> ly in the County of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> or <HI>Teviotdale,</HI> at no great Distance from <HI>Chilingham</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which Lands were given off in the Reign of King <HI>Robert</HI> I. to Sir <HI>Andrew Gray</HI> his Son, who, and his Posterity enjoyed the same for several Generations, till <HI>Andrew</HI> Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> who was Justice-General in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> III. exchanged them with the Earl of <HI>Angus</HI> for <HI>Brughtie</HI>-Castle, <HI>Bagilo,</HI> and the Fishings thereof. Now, every Body knows, that some Nor∣thern Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Nor∣thumberland</HI> in particular, were some Times possest by the Kings of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> and 'tis well known, that some of those who held Lands of the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Northern Coun∣ties
<PB N="179" REF="187"/>
of <HI>England</HI> had also Possessions within <HI>Scotland;</HI> the <HI>Bruces</HI> and <HI>Ba∣liols,</HI> and many others did so: And when War broke out betwixt the Two Nations, the Families so stated divided among themselves, and ad∣hered to either of the Kings in whose Dominions they had largest Possessions. Thus it is probable, that Sir <HI>Andrew Gray,</HI> the first whom we find on Record with us, adhered to King <HI>Robert the Bruce,</HI> whose Sub∣ject he was, upon the Account of his <HI>Scots</HI> Estate. This Sir <HI>Andrew</HI> was undoubtedly a brave Man, and a great Favourite of that glorious Mo∣narch <HI>Robert</HI> I. from whom he had a Grant the 12th of <HI>February,</HI> the 5th Year of his Reign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1315, of the Barony of <HI>Long forgan,</HI> in the Shire of <HI>Perth,</HI> and of many other Lands in <HI>Forfar</HI>-Shire, for his good and faithful Services, as the Charter bears<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Dominum Gray.</NOTE>. He also acquired the Lands of <HI>Broxmouth</HI> in the County of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> from Sir <HI>Alexander Fraser</HI> Kt. and these Two Records which I my self have seen and perused, tho' there were no other extant, do sufficiently confute a very gross Mistake of <HI>Boe∣thius, Buchanan,</HI> and <HI>Camden,</HI> who say, That the first of this noble Fa∣mily came only to <HI>Scotland</HI> with King <HI>James</HI> I. when he was relieved from his Captivity out of <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1424, whereas the Chief of this Fa∣mily, another Sir <HI>Andrew Gray</HI> was by the Estates of <HI>Scotland</HI> sent to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> one of the Hostages for that King's Ransom; but of this afterward. With whom this gallant Sir <HI>Andrew</HI> was married it does not appear; but from the Archives of the Family of <HI>Gray</HI> 'tis evident he left a Son Sir <HI>John Gray,</HI> who succeeded him in his Estate, who in several Records is stil'd Lord of <HI>Broxmouth,</HI> as are several of his Descendents after him.</P>
<P>This <HI>John Gray de Gray, Dominus de Broxmouth,</HI> had a Grant of the Lands of <HI>Craigie,</HI> in the County of <HI>Forfar,</HI> from <HI>William de Troup,</HI> for a very valuable Consideration mentio∣ned therein, and that Grant was confirmed to him by King <HI>David</HI> II. the 8th of <HI>September,</HI> the Twenty Seventh Year of his Reign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1356, with whom it would appear he was no less in Favour than his Father had been with the great King <HI>Robert.</HI> I find this noble Person had very great Superiorities beside his own proper Estate, as a Proof of which there is a Charter granted to him by <HI>Hugode Giffard,</HI> whereby he acknowledges Sir <HI>John Gray</HI> to be Superior Lord to <HI>Henry de Fotheringham,</HI> of the Lands of <HI>Lourenston</HI> and <HI>Huhcuman,</HI> now call'd <HI>Littleton,</HI> of the Date at <HI>Lang∣forgan, ultime Februarii</HI> 1355<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>.

Dunbar of . . . . . . . and was succeeded by Alexander his Son, who improved his Estate, and purchased the Lands of Midletoun to his Family, in the 1539: He had to Wife Elisabeth Daughter of Sir Archibald Douglass of Glenbervy, immediate Ancestor to the present Duke of Douglass, and had by her Alexander Falconer of Halkertoun his successor, Archibald Progenitor of Sir James Falconer of Phesdo, Samuel of Kincorth, in Vic. de Elgin, William of Dinduff, Pro∣genitor of Mr. Colin Falconer first Bishop of Argyle, and thereafter of Murray, in the Reign of King Charles II. Sir Alexander Falconer the next Baron of Halkertoun married Margaret Daughter to Patrick Lord Gray, by whom he had two Sons, Sir Alexander and Patrick Falconer of Newtoun, Ancestor to Falconer of Montoun, in Vic. de Edinburgh. This Sir Alexander was by the after-mentioned Agnes Carnegy, Father to Sir Alexander Falconer the first Lord Halkertoun, and of two younger Sons, Sir David Falconer of Glen∣farquhar, and Sir John Falconer of Balmakellie, who was Master of the Mint in the Time of King Charles II. This Sir David Falconer of Glenfarquhar, had two Sons, Sir Alexander Falconer of Glenfarquhar, and Sir David Falconer of Newton, who was promoted to be one of the Senators of the College of Justice, Anno 1676, and President of the Session on the 5th of July 1682, whose Son and Heir is David Falconer of Newtoun <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in Vic. de Kin∣cardin.</NOTE>.

<P>AS this illustrious and most noble Family is the first of the Peer∣age of <HI>Scotland,</HI> so it is one of the most considerable, whether we Re∣spect the Nobleness of its Extraction, the Multiplicity of its Branches, or the Grandeur of its Alliances; and tho' they are not of so long a Con∣tinuance in this Realm, as some o∣thers mentioned in this Work; yet 'tis sufficient to say, That this noble House has been established by an un∣denyable and uninterrupted Succession of full Four Hundred Years, and had the Honour to be grac'd with the Intail of the Crown, and imperial Dignity of this Realm, One Hundred and Sixty Years ago, which was ra∣tified in a full Assembly of the three Estates of Parliament, to which all of them set their Seals.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge I have not had the Honour to peruse the more ancient Writes of the Family of <HI>Ha∣miltoun,</HI> wherefore I am obliged to rely upon the Account given me from Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Wishaw,</HI> an Antiquary of no little Fame, who says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Sir <HI>Gilbert Hamilton,</HI> the first of this illustrious Race who transplanted himself from the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> was extract∣ed from the ancient Earls of <HI>Licester,</HI> of whose Grant his Progenitor had Lands in that County, called <HI>Hamilton,</HI> from whence they assum∣ed a Sirname, and that the oc∣casion of his coming to <HI>Scotland</HI> is delivered by Historians, after this manner:"</Q> <HI>Sir</HI> Gilbert (say they) <HI>at the Court of</HI> Edward II. <HI>chanced to talk with Honour and Respect of the great Merit of King</HI> Robert <HI>the</HI> Bruce, <HI>whereupon one</HI> John del Spencer <HI>gave him a Blow, which arrogant Treat∣ment he resented so highly, that en∣countering him the next Day, he killed him; and to avoid punishment, fled to</HI> Scotland, <HI>where he was well received by King</HI> Robert: <HI>Who to make amends for what he had forfaulted on his ac∣count at home, generously rewarded him with the Barony of</HI> Cadzow, <HI>in the county of</HI> Lanerk, <HI>then an appendage of the Crown.</HI> He was a very brave Man, and to him are ascribed a vast many great Exploits, particularly, that he distinguished his Valour and Conduct in the decisive Battle of

<HI>Bannock-burn,</HI> (which happened on the the 25th of <HI>July</HI> 1314,) so eminently, that he was knighted in the Field, and got a Gift of diverse Lands.

<P>Sir <HI>Walter</HI> his Son was a Man of great Fame and Character, he had several Military Commands in the Service of <HI>Robert</HI> I. which he per∣form'd with great Diligence and Suc∣cess, in Consideration whereof, he had by that Prince's Grant a Charter of the Barony of <HI>Cadzow,</HI> to be held in as ample manner as Sir <HI>Gilbert</HI> his Father held the same: Also in the 9th of the same Reign, to reward his great Merit and acceptable Services, he had a Grant of the Barony of <HI>Machan-shire</HI> in the County of <HI>Lanark,</HI> which formerly belonged to <HI>John Cumin</HI> Knight. Further, in the 1324, the King bestowed on him the Lands of <HI>Kinneil, Larber, Brimage,</HI> and <HI>Auld∣cathie</HI> in the Shire of <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> and the very same Year the Lands of <HI>Kirkinder</HI> and <HI>Kirkowen</HI> in the County of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> for good Services done and to be done by him, as the Charter bears. Thus by his Princes Bounty and Favour arriving to great Wealth and Honour, he strengthened his Fa∣mily by a very noble Alliance, taking to Wife <HI>Isobel</HI> Daughter of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Ross</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wishaw's Account of the Family of Hamilton.</NOTE>, and Neice to the King by her Mother, by whom he had two Sons, who survived him, Sir <HI>David,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Hamilton,</HI> from whom the Families of <HI>Innerweek Bal∣lincrieff,</HI> and the present Earl of <HI>Had∣dingtoun</HI> are descended.</P>
<P>To Sir <HI>Walter Hamilton</HI> succeeded Sir <HI>David</HI> his Son, who served King <HI>David</HI> II. in his Wars against the <HI>En∣glish:</HI> He was with the King at the un∣fortunate Battle of <HI>Durham, Anno</HI> 1348, where he was taken Prisoner with his Master<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rymer's Foedera Angli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>, but paying a Ransom he was released. That he had great e∣steem from that King, is plain enough, for in the 40th of his Reign, he had a special Grant of all the Lands which belonged either to Sir <HI>Gilbert</HI> his Grand-father or Sir <HI>Walter</HI> his Father in any part of the Realm;<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Charter is dated 27 September 1369.</NOTE> and at the same time the King was pleas∣ed to discharge for ever to him and his Heirs, a Feu-duty that had been formerly payable to the Exche∣quer out of the Barony of <HI>Cadzow,</HI> a Sign of the Prevalency of his Interest at that Prince's Court, where Men of Merit were only imployed. In the 4th of King <HI>Robert</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 1373, he had Summons to Parliament, and appends his Seal to the Act recogniz∣ing his Majesty's Title to the Crown, and in settling the Succession upon all the King's Children lawfully begotten, either by <HI>Elisabeth Mure</HI> his first Wife, or <HI>Euphame Ross</HI> then his Queen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Acts of Parliament still extan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Re∣cords, where he is mentioned in both.</NOTE>.

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>NOTA,</HI> Here it will, I apprehend, be neither improper nor ungrateful to my Reader, to offer some Considerations to obviate that Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion of George Buchanan, and other Historians who have copied and translated from him, who insinuate, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Lady Mary the King's Sister, was forced by her Brother to marry James Lord Hamilton, when Thomas Boyd Earl of Arran her Husband was alive: And this is generally believed by every Body who reads George Buchanan's History, and enquire no more about it, but depend on our Affairs as wrote by him, who indeed, to do him Justice, was a very learned and polite Person, and has wrote the History of Scotland not much inferior in Style to the best Roman Authors. I shall here offer what I have observed in relation to this Affair. All Histories commend the Lady Mary's Affection to her Husband, and tell us, That she could not be prevailed with to for∣sake or desert him when he fell into Disgrace, but transported her self with him into foreign Parts to share with him in his Misfortunes, and sojourned with him in Denmark and Flanders for some time, till she understood from Scotland, that her Presence and Solicitation with her Brother might prevail with him to suffer my Lord Arran to return home to his Native Country, and accordingly she came to Scotland: But the King continuing inexorable, and the Lady detain'd from going abroad, the poor unfortunate Earl of Arran soon after died of Grief at Antwerp: She continuing a Widow till the 1474. is then, I find, married to James Lord Hamilton. Moreover, I'm told by Mr. Hamilton of Wishaw, that the Contract of Marriage is still preserved among the Archives of the Family, but I have not seen it; but there is a Charter in my hands dated the 12th of July 1474, to James Lord Hamilton and the Lady Mary Stewart the King's Sister, of the Lands of Kinneil, &amp;c. Moreover, I think the Testimony of Mr John Ballenden Arch Dean of Murray, who was Co temporary with the Lady whom we find alive in the 1515, and for ought I know lived much longer, ought to be regard∣ed. He at the Command of King James V. translated Hector Boethius History of Scotland into English, printed in the Year 1536, under this Title, <HI>The History and Cronicles of</HI> Scotland <HI>compleated, and newly corrected and amended by the reverend and noble Clerk Mr.</HI> Hector Boeis <HI>Canon of</HI> Aberdeen, <HI>translated by Mr.</HI> John Ballenden <HI>Arch-Dean of</HI> Murray <HI>and Canon of</HI> Ross. And there he says, Book 12 Cap 5. <HI>The first Daughter of King</HI> James II. <HI>was married to the Lord</HI> Boyd, <HI>of whom was begotten a Son, whilk was slain by the Lord</HI> Montgomery, <HI>and a Daughter mar∣ried to the Earl of</HI> Cassils; <HI>and after the Death of the Lord</HI> Boyd, <HI>this Daughter of King</HI> James II. <HI>was married on the Lord</HI> Hamilton, <HI>and that way the House of</HI> Hamilton <HI>is Decorit in the King</HI>'s <HI>Blood.</HI> I say, I think the Authority of this learned and ingenuous Author should determine any Man of Judgment more than a posterior Party-writer, such as every one knows George Buchanan was, with all Deference to his Character otherways: For every Body may perceive, who reads his Book, that he takes all Opportunities to blacken and misrepresent this nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Family, sometimes with very great Inconsistency with himself, as a judicious Historian; and if this be not sufficient to disprove this part of Buchanan's History, take also the Testimony of a very ingenious Foreign Historian Ralph Holinshed; who wrote a History of Scotland, wherein he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That after the Death of the Lord Boyd, the Daughter of King James II. was married to the Lord Hamilton."</Q> But how far will not an Author depart from Truth, who is the devoted Servant of any Party, as Buchanan was, who wrote the latter part of his History to serve a particular turn, well enough known?</NOTE> <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Hamilton</HI> was succeeded by <HI>James</HI> his Son, who was constituted one of the Lords of the Privy Coun∣cil, <HI>Anno</HI> 1440; in which Station he continued, till from some Mistake he entred into that memorable League with the Earls of <HI>Douglass, Ross, Craw∣furd, Murray,</HI> and <HI>Ormond,</HI> wherein they solemnly swore never to desert one another during their Lives; that Injuries done to any one of them, should be considered as done to them all; that they should concurr against whatsoever Persons within or without the Realm, and spend their Lives, Goods and Fortunes in Defence of each other. But when Sir <HI>James Hamilton</HI> discerned their violent purposes against the King, he sever'd himself from them, and returned to his Duty, whereupon ensued the ruin of the Earl of <HI>Douglass,</HI> who per∣sisted in his Rebellion. In the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> III. he was no less considered and valued than he had been by the former King; for in the 1471, when a Treaty of Peace was set on foot with the <HI>English,</HI> he was one of those noble Persons who met the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> and other Commissioners on the Part of the King of <HI>England,</HI> and treated of a
<PB N="191" REF="201"/>
League and Amity betwixt the two Nations. Thereafter on the 6th of <HI>March</HI> 1472, he was with <HI>William</HI> Bishop of <HI>Aberdeen, David</HI> Earl of <HI>Crawfurd, John</HI> Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> and <HI>Archi∣bald Whitelaw</HI> Secretary of State, by a Commission under the Great Seal, appointed to treat with the Ambassa∣dours of <HI>England</HI> upon a lasting Peace betwixt the two Realms. His excellent Qualities and heroick Virtues gain'd so much upon his Sovereign King <HI>James</HI> III. that he was pleased to bestow upon him his Sister the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> Countess of <HI>Arran</HI> in Marriage, the greatest Honour any Subject was capable of.

This may likeways serve to correct the Mistake of those Historians, who say, That when James Lord Hamilton married the Sister of King James III, that he got with her the Earldom of Arran, which Marriage I have made evident, was in the 1474, and yet this Grant of the Earldom of Arran was not to him, nor his Son for Twenty Nine Years after the Marriage of his Father and Mother. From this we may remark how George Buchanan, and other Historians who copy from him, are to be relyed on, who take Ma∣terials and Vouchers of their Histories from other Authors who have wrote before them, and never looked into the National Records, where proper Materials for a Historian are to be found: For I cannot imagine that Mr. Buchanan ever gave himself the Trouble to turn over one Roll in the publick Archives of the Kingdom, otherwise he could not but have discovered the Error of Robert III's Illegitmacy, and many other Things relating both to the Royal Family, as well as to this Noble Family I now write of; for since the Time of King Robert the Bruce the Records are pretty full, so that if diligently perused, would have rectified many very gross Errors all our old Historians have fallen into, whom Buchanan, as to the History, has followed exactly; for he only turned their Books into that ornate Latine Style we now read his History of Scotland in. For I cannot imagine Buchanan saw the Re∣cords, otherwise he could not have been so Wicked, or so Perverse an Historian as to have concealed Matters of Fact so evident there, and of such importance to the Royal Family, except ye suppose, (as indeed many do) that he was well pleased to find that any before him had wrote of the illegitimacy of King Robert III, and thereby to make it a Precedent for the Succession of another Bastard to the Crown, who was his Patron, in Prejudice of the lawful Heirs; and James Duke of Chatlerault being then the presumptive Heir of the Crown failling of Queen Mary and her young Son King James VI. I believe Mr. Buchanan had a particular View to that in his malicious and false Aspersions against that most Noble and Worthy Lord and his Family, both in his History, and in another scurrilous Pasquil he wrote, entitul'd, <HI>An Admonition to the true Lords,</HI> and which is the most false, and most scandalous writing that ever flowed from the Pen of any Man of the least Worth, which shall be answered elsewhere, to the Conviction of any who will allow themselves to believe Truth, all clearly made out from original Writings, accidentally come into my Hands.</NOTE>,</P>

His Lordship being now higher in Dignity, the Year following had the Command of the Forces sent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Assistance of <HI>Christian</HI> II. of <HI>Denmark;</HI> which Service he happily perform'd with Conduct, Diligence, and Fidelity.

This Earl giving way to Fate in the 1530, was succeeded by</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> his Son, a Person of singular Prudence and Integrity, as will ap∣pear in the whole Conduct of his Life. In the 1536, when he was but a very young Man, he was one of the Lords who attended King <HI>James</HI> V. by his special Appointment in his Voyage to <HI>France,</HI> when he espoused <HI>Magdalen</HI> Daughter to <HI>Francis</HI> I.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Drummonds History of King James V.</NOTE>, afterward in 1539, when the fore∣said King had a Prince born to him by <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Lorrain</HI> his next Queen he had the Honour to stand God-father to him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>. His Lordship was very for∣ward in offering the King his Service toward the suppressing the Incursions of the <HI>English,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>Thomas Wharton,</HI> and had the Com∣mand of that Body which was sent to Desend the East-Border, where he soon heard the mortifying News of the Loss of the Army at <HI>Solway,</HI> which was not long after attended with the Death of that Monarch, who yielded his last Breath on the 14 of <HI>December</HI> 1542: Then my Lord <HI>Arran</HI> was, by the unanimous Consent of Parliament chosen Protector to the young Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Governour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was ratified by an Act of the three Estates, in which, <HI>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commis∣sioners of Burghs, declare</HI> James <HI>Earl of</HI> Arran <HI>Lord</HI> Hamilton, <HI>second Per∣son of the Realm, and nearest to succeed to the Crown of the same, failling of our Sovereign Lady, and the Bairns lawfully to be begotten of her and none others; and by Reason thereof Tutor lawful to the Queen's Grace and Governour of the Realm, and he to use the said Office in all things until the perfect Age of our said Sovereign Lady, and all the Leiges of this Realm, to Answer and Obey the said Earl as Tutor lawful to her Grace, and Governour foresaid, in all things concerning the said Office, conform to the Act made hereupon</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Original of this Act is in the Custody of the Family of Hamilton, bearing date 13th of March 1543, to which all the Seals of the Noblemen, Prelates and Burroughs are appended, which I have seen, and from which I took this Note.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as the Earl was in Posses∣sion of the Government, he sent the Earl of <HI>Glencairn,</HI> Sir <HI>George Douglass, William Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Sanquhar, James Learmont</HI> of <HI>Balcomy,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry Balnaves</HI> of <HI>Hall-hill,</HI> Secretary of State unto <HI>England,</HI> in order to treat both about a Peace, which was be∣come necessary, by reason of the King's Death, and other concurring Circumstances, and a Match be∣twixt the Infant Queen and <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>England.</HI> Accordingly a Peace, or at least an Abstinence, as it was then termed, and a Marriage betwixt the Queen and Prince <HI>Edward</HI> were agreed to, and ratified by a great Majority in the Parliament, which met at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1543.</P>
<P>I need not mention in this place, how this advantagious Union was spoil∣ed by the then Clergy and the <HI>French</HI> Faction, it being so fully treated on by Bishop <HI>Lesly</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buchanan,</HI> only I shall add what neither of them have taken much notice of, That the Earls of <HI>Huntly, Argyle, Montrose, Bothwel, Monteith,</HI> Lord <HI>Fleeming,</HI> and a great many more of all Ranks, entred into a most so∣lemn Bond; and notwithstanding of the Act of Parliament, bound and obliged themselves to oppose the in∣tended Match with <HI>England,</HI> and con∣sequential Union, with all their Power, tho' with the hazard of their Fortunes and Lives, at the same time they endeavoured all they could to bring the Governour into a Com∣plyance with the breach of the Treaty, and the more effectually to win him over to them, they proposed to se∣cure the Crown to his Posterity, by bestowing the Infant Queen upon the Lord <HI>Hamilton,</HI> his eldest Son.

<PB N="194" REF="204"/>
in the Observation of a Treaty he himself had caused to be ratified in Parliament, that he kept it in∣violated on his part, till King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. not only refused to ratify it on the other Part, but also caused his Officers to seise upon a great many <HI>Scots</HI> Ships that had sailed to <HI>England</HI> loaden with <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Commodities, upon the Faith of the Treaty of Peace before concluded. This undenyable Breach of the Articles condescended on, the Governour resented to that degree, that he called a Parliament in <HI>December</HI> 1543, and in it declared the Treaty to be void and null, in regard the <HI>English</HI> had broke it first. Then he applyed him∣self with the utmost Diligence to carry on a War, and immediately raised what Forces he could, to oppose the <HI>English</HI> Army that had invaded <HI>Scotland,</HI> under the Command of the Lord <HI>Evers,</HI> whom he encountred at <HI>Ancrum</HI> in <HI>Teviotdale;</HI> and tho' they were 7000 to not above 800, put them to the rout with considerable Loss on their Side, and scarce a Man on his Lordship's. Not long after this, he was join'd by Monsieur <HI>de Lerges</HI> Count of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> with 3500 <HI>French</HI> Auxiliaries, and march∣ed toward <HI>England</HI> in search of the Earl of <HI>Hartford,</HI> who to retrieve the former Loss, had entred <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had already laid waste a great part of the <HI>Merse</HI> and <HI>Teviotdale,</HI> but retir'd upon the approach of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army. The Governour in his Turn invaded <HI>England,</HI> beat the Enemy where ever he found them, ravag'd the Country, and return'd with the Glory of having defeated one Army, and given the Chase to ano∣ther in one Campaign. Neither am I to forget, that at this time King <HI>Francis</HI> I. sent him the Ensigns of the most noble Order of St. <HI>Michael.</HI> To proceed, in the 1547, when the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI> was made Protector of <HI>England,</HI> and Tutor to <HI>Edward</HI> VI. upon the demise of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in Prosecution of the War, he invaded <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the head of a mighty Army, seconded by a Fleet by Sea.

and, if you are otherwise dispos'd, as I hope you are not, to upbraid your Fear, the Inglorious Enemy of Reason and Courage. When I took the Command of our Armies upon me, you unanimously pre¦ferr'd an Honourable War, to a Peace you thought equally Un∣safe and Disgraceful; and shall we be so Mean as to yield to the first Signal Injustice of Fortune? No: I am perswaded, that, as Grating as our Misfortune at <HI>Pinky</HI> must needs be to you all, you'll never∣theless choose to pursue a Noble Revenge, rather than sit down with the Affront, or submit to the threatn'd Slavery. Come on't what will, I am fix'd in my first Opinion; and I had rather pre∣serve the Monarchy at any rate, I mean, tho' at the Expence of such of the Subjects Fortunes and Blood as have been, or may yet chance to be wasted, than to spare the E∣states and Lives of private Men, tho' ever so Great or Deserving, with the Loss of our Common Country. Let us labour by all Means to save the Ship, that saves all; and to effect this, let us not grudge to cut down the Mast, nor to see our own Shares of the Load∣ing thrown over Board: If the Foundation of an Edifice stands firm, 'tis no great Matter what comes of the Ceiling or Furniture. Our private Losses are so many Sacrifices that are due to the Pub∣lick, they weaken the State, I own it, but the Ruin of the State it self must needs involve us all in Uni∣versal Irretrivable Miseries. Con∣sider, My Lords, with what an Enemy we have to do, and on what Terms we may purchase a Peace. Our Enemy, is he not the same old Inveterate One, whose Avarice has, by Unjust Wars, so often attempted to Devour our Existence? And is not this present War alone sufficient to make us tremble at the very Thought of, falling under the Power of Tyrants so unconscionably Implacable? We cannot descend to the Terms they propose, without stooping under the Imperious Yoke of a People that thirst for our Blood, and whose Insolence is whetted with Fury. Cast your Eyes, on the other Hand, on your Ancient Unalterable Allies the <HI>French;</HI> they never yet fail'd us in our greatest Exigencies, and will not in the present Juncture of our Affairs: Neither do we want Friends in <HI>Italy:</HI> Nay, there are few Potentates in <HI>Europe,</HI> that will unconcernedly look on and be∣hold our Destruction. Resolve, in fine, Whether we had best Defend our Liberties, or give them up; Whether 'tis most expedient to die, if it must be so, Free and Indepen∣dent, or to live Eternal Slaves to our greatest Foes. 'Tis true, they offer us fair Things; our Laws and Rights are, by the Treaty, to re∣main untouch'd: But pray, who is Guarrantee for this? And if the <HI>English</HI> shall, in an After-game, either Break or Encroach upon the Articles agreed to, Who will Re∣dress our Grievances? To what Tribunal shall we appeal? 'Tis a Jest to offer to set up either for Liberty or Property, when in effect we shall have given them away. We must begin, by surrendering our Mistress to a Husband, that is, to a Master; which done, I don't see why he may not, as such, sub∣ject her Crown to his own, or ra∣ther Unite and Confound them in one: And thus <HI>Scotland</HI> must in∣evitably become a County or Pro∣vince of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis impossible to reflect on the Ambitious Project without Horror and Detestation: And how can we choose, but to have the meanest Sentiments of, and greatest Contempt imaginable

for such of our Countrymen as shall shew themselves Villains enough to comply. The uncertain Events and Length of the War, may per∣haps intimidate some of us: But is't the first time that <HI>Scotland</HI> has seen herself expos'd to Dangers of this kind? When reduc'd to the like Extremities, did ever our An∣cestors hesitate to prefer their Ho∣nour to Life? And are we so far Degenerated as to render our selves, their Off-spring, unworthy of the inesteemable Treasure they pur∣chas'd with so much Valour, and transmitted to us with so much Glory? Had the malign Influence of our Birth involv'd us in Sla∣very, how far we had been oblig'd to endeavour the Recovery of that Freedom we had never enjoy'd, I shall not determine; but since we were born Free, 'tis plain, that our Posterity can never pardon our Cowardice, if we become willing to resign the Independency our own Birth and Forefathers Cou∣rage have entitl'd us to. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but a part of our Estates and Honours were invaded, we might plead some Pretence or Excuse for dispensing with it: But the Body of the Nation is attack'd; our Country, nothing less than our Country, is at Stake; its Ancient Laws and Fundamental Constitution are on the Point of being subverted. I can∣not disown, but that 'tis hard to tell what Success it shall please the Almighty to give to our Arms; 'tis certain however, that as we must bear with Patience those Ma∣ladies the Infirmity of Nature has made us liable to, so we are oblig'd to suffer with Constancy such fur∣ther Losses as the Enemy's good Fortune may procure us. 'Tis not only in these our Days that the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, equal to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> in this Point, have stood firm in the midst of Dangers, or that they have conquer'd their hard Fate by the Steddiness of their Courage: Let us for no reason affront the Memory of those Heroes that gave us a Being, and far from fol∣lowing the Example of those in the <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Teviotdale,</HI> let us rather detest the Infamy of their Defection. The more Vigor we shall express by our Unanimity in this Meeting, so much the more may we expect the Assistance of our Friends beyond Seas: Nay, For∣tune her self seems to take Pleasure in raising that Virtue she has in vain attempted to depress. One thing at least we are sure of, the Boldness of our Resolutions cannot fail of conveying the Praises we shall deserve, down to the old Age of Time; whereas our Cowardice, if express'd on this Occasion, would render us Infamous and Unhappy at once."</Q></P>
<P>This Speech so lively, and so ad∣mirably well adapted to the Humour of the Nation at that time, had its desired Effect: The Nobility ap∣plauded his Design, they talked of no∣thing but of Means to prosecute the War; and whatever the Event might be, they resolved to hazard all, rather than submit to the <HI>English.</HI> So it was agreed to have recourse to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who they thought alone able to retrieve their Losses, and to transact with him about marrying the Queen when fit for a Husband, to <HI>Francis</HI> the first his Son the <HI>Daul∣phine.</HI> Then the said King was pleased to create his Lordship Duke of <HI>Chatt∣lerault</HI> in that Kingdom, and to assign him for the better support of the Ho∣nour a Revenue of 30000 Livres a Year to him his Heirs and Assigneys for ever. After which his Grace continued Governour of <HI>Scotland</HI> for six Years, till the 1555, he resigned that great Post in full Parliament to the Queens Mother. He was again declared to

<P>When Queen <HI>Mary</HI> returned Home from <HI>France, Anno</HI> 1561, her Majesty was pleased prudently to make choice of a new Privy Council, all or most of whom were Protestants, the better to conform her self to the present posture of Affairs; and confiding much in the Duke of <HI>Chattlerault,</HI> he was chose one of that Number, where∣in he worthily served her Majesty in settling the Kingdom, then in no small Ferment, always showing a great steddyness to the Interest of his Country and the Protestant Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion.

<P>According to Articles, most of the Persons concerned met at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> on the 10th of <HI>April</HI> 1569, to treat at large of a thorow Agreement, and especially of such Points as related to the banished Queen. Being all in one Room, the Regent first rose, and drawing out a Paper, asked the Duke, if he would instantly subscribe an Ac∣knowledgment of the young King's Authority, or not, to which he modestly replyed, <HI>That he and his Friends had laid down their Arms con∣ditionally, nor could he think himself, or them, obliged to subscribe their Allegi∣ance to the King, unless according to</HI>

<HI>these Conditions, the Regent at the same time should grant what might be reason∣ably demanded, in behalf of the distressed Queen, and therefore hoped he would not proceed to Acts of Force and Fraud too, since not only he and his Friends, but their Hostages likewise were in his Hands, desiring him to remember that they had religiously observed every Ar∣ticle of the late Treaty, and had come secure and unarmed as to a Friend, faith∣fully relying on his Honour, and those assurances of Safety he had given them in the most solemn manner under his own Hand.</HI> To this easie Remonstrance of the Duk's, <HI>Murray</HI> made no manner of return (says my Author)<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Drumsoy's Memoirs.</NOTE> <HI>but against all the Laws of Honour sent him to the Castle of</HI> Edinburgh<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Melvil's Memoirs.</NOTE>, where he was kept close Prisoner till the Regent was murdered by <HI>James Ha∣milton</HI> of <HI>Bothwell-haugh</HI> on the 23 of <HI>January</HI> 1570, then he had his Libera∣tion, after having purged himself by Oath from all manner of Suspicion in that Affair.</P>
<P>What a loyal and honest Part my Lord Duke of <HI>Chattlerault</HI> acted for the Interest of his Sovereign Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the time of her greatest Distress, is so well known &amp; was so frequently own'd &amp; acknowledg'd, by her Ma∣jesty, that I don't think it necessary to be further insisted on here<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Queen Mary always called the Duke of Chattlerault <HI>Father.</HI></NOTE>, and that his Loyalty was not easie to him, is evi∣dent from the manifold Sufferings and Hardships he underwent during the continuance of the Civil War; for as soon as the Earl of <HI>Lennox</HI> was elect∣ed Regent, he burnt down the Castle &amp; Town of <HI>Hamiltoun;</HI> and that these honest Patriots might be heartily hum∣bled, not so much as the Corn-Fields and Trees belonging to a <HI>Hamiltoun</HI> were spared, the Duke himself with his two Sons, and most of the Gentle∣men of the Name of <HI>Hamilton</HI> were all forfaulted for their Rebellion a∣gainst the young King; notwithstand∣ing he resolutely persisted in the Queen's Service, and had a large share in the Misfortunes of that un∣fortunate Queen, but being aged, for the better Security of his Person from the violence of his Enemies, he re∣tired into <HI>France,</HI> where he stayed some time during the Rage of the War, which had reduced his Country to the last extremity; and returning home he gave way to Fate on the 22 of <HI>January</HI> 1575. As for his Character, notwithstanding the Envy of some, and the Malice of others, it shone very bright, in that great and difficult Trust of Governour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which he held in the most difficult Times, so he discharged it for twelve Years with no less Prudence and Dexterity than Honour and Reputation, a Praise which few of his Enemies ever denyed him in any time. For in his Court, says a reverend Historian<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Arch-Bishop Spottiswood's History of the Church of Scot∣land.</NOTE>, <HI>There was no∣thing to be seen the severest Eye could censure in the publick Administration, such a Moderation was kept as no Man was heard to complain.</HI> And continues my Author, <HI>He was a Nobleman well in∣clined, plain, and without all Dissimula∣tion and Fraud, that by the goodness of God, who always favoureth the Upright, he was carryed thro many Difficulties, and died in Peace and Honour, well ad∣vanced in Age.</HI></P>

<P>My Lord <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s most Loyal and firm Adherence to the Crown was very dear to him, for the con∣trary Faction who were Masters of the young King, prosecuted him and his Family with the utmost Severity, for no other Reason but because they owned Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Authority, and therefore in one of their Parliaments held in <HI>October</HI> 1579, both he and his Brother Lord <HI>Claud</HI> were forfaulted.

<P>Upon the first Insurrection in <HI>Scot∣land, Anno</HI> 1638, occasioned by the pressing of the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> he was sent down as his Majesty's High Commis∣sioner to the General Assembly of the Church, with Instructions to compose and appease the Disorders of the Nation, then in a great Ferment, but in that Judicature my Lord Mar∣quess not being able to carry what the King designed, he according to Order dissolved the Meeting, and In∣hibited them to sit any longer under pain of Rebellion, which was all his Lordship could do. Next Year he was intrusted with the Command of the Fleet sent down to reduce the Covenanters to their Duty to the King, his Majesty himself being on the Head of Six Thousand Land-Forces, advanced as far as <HI>Berwick,</HI> but by the Marquess's Mediation and good Offices with the King, a Treaty was set on Foot, and a Pacification ensued.</P>

Then his Lordship, according to his Promise and Con∣cert, took an Opportunity to make a Protestation against the Legality of the Meeting, upon which many of the Members who had been always most engaged against the King were very warm, and demanded that he should declare himself clearly, whe∣ther he did protest against the Parlia∣ment; but his Lordship fearing, as he declared, the fatal Issue of adhere∣ing to his Protestation to the King's Service, he excused himself after the best manner he could, tho' no Man had a greater dislike of the high Pro∣ceedings of that Meeting, in exceed∣ing the Limits of their Duty to the King, or had a greater Affection for his Majesty's Service than my Lord Marquess had, for he oppos'd all their Determinations with all the vigor he thought seasonable, concurring only so far with them as was necessary to keep up his Credit, whereby he might with the more Authority ad∣vance the King's Cause and a Peace, which he and all good Men so passion∣ately desired.

<P>As soon as the Convention was over, the Duke and his Brother the Earl of <HI>Lanerk</HI> left <HI>Scotland</HI> to give the King, then at <HI>Oxford,</HI> an Account of all their proceedings; but notwith∣standing of his Grace's good Inten∣tion toward the King, his Enemies, for not a few he had, used all the Artifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es they could to render him suspected to his Majesty, as if he secretly countenanc'd, at least did not sufficiently abhor the unnatural Rebellion of his Country-men, and this Imputation was with so great Art insinuated, that it got so much Credit, with those about the Court, that the King upon my Lord Duke and his Brothers arrival, commanded them to keep their Chambers, and ordered a Guard to attend them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, so after some time his Grace was sent in Custody to the Castle of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Exeter,</HI> and so to the Castle of <HI>Pendinnis,</HI> whence he was removed to St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s <HI>Mount</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> upon the surrender of which to the Parliaments Forces, <HI>Anno</HI> 1646, he obtain'd his Liberty, which he imployed with much Zeal in the King's Service to the loss of his Life, by which he was not only vindicated in the Opinion of all Men from all those Jealousies and Asper∣sions he had lyen long under, but the proceedings that had been against him at <HI>Oxford,</HI> were looked upon by many as void of that Justice and Policy which had been requisite, and they concluded by what he did after a long Imprisonment, how much he might have done more successfully if he had never been restrain'd<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As soon as my Lord Duke was at Liberty, it was believ'd that the Ani∣mosity was so great between him and some others of great Name, that he would rather meditate a Revenge, than concur in any Action which might advance the King's Interest, but his Grace well consider'd both his Duty to his Majesty, and his own Danger at such a Juncture, to think of private Contention and matters of Revenge, when the publick was so much at Stake, so that his former Treatment made no other Impression upon him, then to make him show his steadiness more and more to his Ma∣jesty's Service, who then so much stood in need of the Assistance of his faithful Subjects.</P>
<P>When the King put himself into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army before <HI>Newark</HI> in the 1646, my Lord Duke having obtain'd his Liberty, came to wait on his Majesty<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet's Memoir's of James Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Hamilton.</NOTE>, and was well re∣ceived by him. After they had con∣versed some time together, his Ma∣jesty was pleased to express the sense he had of his long Sufferings, and told him in these Words, <HI>That he had ever judged him Innocent as to the bulk of things, tho he confess'd there were some particulars he was not so well</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="216"/>
<HI>satisfied with, but that his Restraint was extorted from him against his Heart, for he had stood out against all the Im∣portunities of his Enemies till the very Morning he came to</HI> Oxford.</P>
<P>His Lordship's next Care was to bring his Majesty and the Committee of Estates to a happy Peace and Ac∣commodation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Burnet's Memoirs.</NOTE>; and as he earnest∣ly endeavour'd to have them satis∣fied with the Kings Concessions, so he dealt fervently with his Majesty to yield to the abolishing of Episcopa∣cy in <HI>England,</HI> as he had in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> as the only way to induce the Presbyterian Party to declare for him, but the good King could not be be prevailed on to consent to buy his Peace, as he said, <HI>at so dear a Rate as the peace of his Conscience,</HI> so the Trea∣ty at that time had not its desir'd effect.</P>
<P>When it came to be considered in Parliament what way his Majesty's Person should be disposed of, still in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, my Lord Duke finding that the House by a Majority were inclin'd to deliver him up to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, his Grace took an Opportunity that he might de∣clare to the World his abhorrence of an Action attended with so much Infamy, and spoke against it to this purpose,</P>
<P><HI>Would</HI> Scotland <HI>now quit a Possession of</HI> 1500 <HI>Years Date, which was their Interest in their Sovereign, and do it to those, whose Enmity both against Him and them did visibly appear? Was this the effect of all their Protestations of Duty and Affection to his Majesty? Was this their keeping of their Covenant, wherein they had sworn to defend the King's Majesty's Person and Authority? Was this a suitable return to the King's Goodness, both in his consenting to all the Desires of that Kingdom,</HI> An. 1641. <HI>and in His late trusting His Person to them? What Censures will be past up∣on this through the whole World? What a stain would it be to the whole Reformed Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion? and in fine, what Danger might be apprehended both to the King's Person, and to</HI> Scotland, <HI>from the Party that was now prevalent in</HI> England.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the Op∣position the Duke and his Friends could make against it, yet the same was carryed upon the 16th of <HI>January</HI> 1647, <HI>That the King should be delivered up into such Hands as the</HI> English <HI>Parlia∣ment had appointed to receive him</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, to the great Grief of the Duke, and all true hearted <HI>Scots</HI>-Men, and that his Grace might again in any Degree retrive the Dishonour the Nation suffered in the giving up that excellent Prince, he endeavour'd all he could to infuse a sense of Shame and Horror in all People for the late Action, which might prepare them to a Reparation of it by a generous engaging in the King's Quarrel, and in doing so, most of the Year 1647 was spent even till the meeting of the next Parliament, which sat down the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1648<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bishop Guthrie's Memoirs.</NOTE>, at the opening of which my Lord Duke did all he could to inflame the People with Zeal for his Majesty's Relief, &amp; against the Army of <HI>England</HI> who he said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had forced the Par∣liament there to break the Treaty between the two Kingdoms in their ill usage of the King, who was Im∣prison'd by the Army, nor was it in the power of the Parliament to set him at Liberty, That they had now upon the matter, absolutely deposed him, by not suffering him to perform the Office of a King, not permit∣ting any of his Subjects to repair to him; in which the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> was concern'd, in that being in∣dependent upon <HI>England</HI> and the Paliament of <HI>England,</HI> they were

by them depriv'd of their King, and could not be admitted to speak with him, nor his Majesty to send to them; which was such a Pre∣sumption, and violation of the Law of Nations, and such a perfidious breach and contempt of the <HI>Solemn League</HI> and <HI>Covenant,</HI> and of the Treaty between the two King∣doms, that they were bound by all the Obligations Human and Di∣vine to be sensible of it, and to re∣deem their King's Liberty, and their own Honour, with the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, and all that was dear to them: and therefore he desired that they might enter upon those Coun∣sels, which might soonest get an Army together, which should no sooner enter <HI>England,</HI> but it would find a conjunction from that whole Kingdom, except only the Army; and that it would then quickly ap∣pear that the Parliament of both Kingdoms desired the same thing, and to live happily under the Go∣vernment of the same King."</Q></P>

<P>The cruel and bloody Civil War hast'ning on, my Lord <HI>Lanerk</HI> used his utmost Endeavours to allay the unhappy Differences which had arisen between his Majesty and his Subjects of both Kingdoms, and bent all his Thoughts to mediate a Peace to the Honour and Safety of the King, and the Wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are and Happiness of the

Kingdom. In the Convention of E∣states which met on the 22 of <HI>June</HI> 1643<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Bishop of Duakeid's Memoir of the Civil War.</NOTE>, his Lordship acted with his usual Zeal for the publick good, but discerning that the Royal Party in that Assembly had not Authority or Power enough to cross any thing that was done to the prejudice of the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Earl of Clarendon's History, and Bishop Burnet's Memoirs compar'd.</NOTE>, and that a direct Protestation a∣gainst the Convention in that con∣juncture of time was to destroy them∣selves to no purpose, his Lordship and other loyal Peers did give in a Declaration, and took Instruments both in the King's Name and their own<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs.</NOTE>, which was all that could be pradently done in that Season, soon after which my Lord <HI>Lanerk,</HI> for Reasons, and from Motives that History is altogether silent in, &amp; which is not clear enough to this time, he put the King's Signet, with which he was intrusted as Secretary, to the Procla∣mation for the general Rendevouz of all Men in the Kingdom from such an Age to such an Age, whereby the Army was presently formed, which afterward join'd with the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> against the King, the fatal Consequences of which are so well known, that they need not be told<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History.</NOTE>. This Action was not thought capable of any Excuse, &amp; was afterward very much represented to his Disadvantage, and was the first Cause of the King's Jealousie both of the Duke his Brother and his Lordship, and thereby their Sincerity and Affection to his Ma∣jesty's Service came to be very much call'd in question, but the Earl of <HI>Lanerk</HI> presuming he had enough to excuse himself of any Disloyalty, as soon as the Convention was over, went with his Brother the Duke to wait on the King at <HI>Oxford</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guthrie's Memoirs.</NOTE>, being confident that when he should be ad∣mitted to speak with his Majesty, he would give him satisfaction in that Affair<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History.</NOTE>. Upon their arrival there, both the Brothers were put under a Con∣finement, but the <HI>Earl perceiving</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs.</NOTE> <HI>that they were not like to obtain a Trial for clearing their Innocence, and disco∣vering the Forgeries of their Accusers; and his Lordship fearing a long and cruel Imprisonment, he made his escape by means of Sir</HI> James Cuningham, and presently repair'd to <HI>London;</HI> After some stay there, returning to <HI>Scotland,</HI> he easily found means to make his Peace with the Estates by taking of the Covenant<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Guthrie's Memoirs.</NOTE>, whereby he came to have a great Influence on their Counsels and did not a little contri∣bute to moderate the fury of the lead∣ing Men of that side to hearken to Propositions for Peace and Accomo∣dation with the King.</P>
<P>After this we hear not much of the Conduct of the Earl till the 1646, when the King came to the <HI>Scots</HI> Army at <HI>Newark,</HI> he was with other two Lords sent Commissioner from the Committee of Estates <HI>with an humble Offer of their Duty to his Ma∣jesty, and of their sincere Intentions to serve him, and withal to give him assurance that the Preservation of his sa∣cred Person, and his just Power and Greatness, was and should ever be dear to them.</HI> Here my Lord <HI>Lanerk</HI> us'd all the Perswasions, and all the Im∣portunities he could with his Ma∣jesty, to give Satisfaction to the De∣sires of his Subjects, and as a Prepa∣ration to this, that he would send his positive Orders to the Marquess of <HI>Montrose</HI> to lay down his Arms, extirpate Prelacy out of <HI>England</HI> as he had done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to agree to such Propositions as should be brought from the two Houses in <HI>England.</HI> The first Proposal he gracious∣ly condescended to; To the next, he re∣turned this Answer, <HI>That when he was satisfied in his Conscience of the lawfulness of what they desired, then and never till then would he grant their Demands.</HI> As for the Message from the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, it was so high, that his Majesty could not gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or my Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> says, <HI>It contain'd such</HI>

<HI>an Eradication of the Government of the Church and State, that the King told them, he knew not what Answer to make to them till he should be informed what Power or Authority they had left him and his Heirs, when he had given all to them which they desired.</HI></P>
<P>On that ominous Day 16th of <HI>January</HI> 1647, when the great Trans∣action came to be debated in Parlia∣ment about the disposing of his Ma∣jesty's Person, who was in the Hands of the Army, <HI>Whether they should leave him in</HI> England <HI>to the two Houses, yea or not.</HI> Thus was the Question stated, against giving up of the King, my Lord <HI>Lanerk</HI> argued strenously, and spoke against it, <HI>as the most barefac'd Viola∣tion of their Faith and Allegiance to deliver up their Native Prince, who had put himself into their Hands against his Will and Consent, into the Custody of such as would put his Sacred Person in eminent hazard,</HI> but to the eternal Infamy of the Majority of that Con∣vention it was carried, <HI>To deliver up the King,</HI> whereat his Lordship was so perfectly overwhelm'd with the hor∣ror of so sinful and shameful a Deed, that he expressed his Dissent from it in so passionate a manner, that it would be to do him wrong to omit to give it in his own Words, <HI>As God shall have mercy on my Soul</HI> (said he) <HI>at the great Day, I would rather choose to have my Head struck off at the Cross of</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>than give my Consent to this Vote,</HI> and then adds, <HI>That this was the blackest Day that ever</HI> Scotland <HI>saw</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet's Memoirs, I wish latest Posterity may not for ever have cause to re∣mark, with equal Sorrow and Regret the same ominous Day threescore Years, <HI>viz.</HI> sixteenth of January one thousand seven hundred and seven, on which the late Treaty of Union be∣twixt the two Nations was ratified and approven b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Act of Parliament, whereby alas!

<P>As the Earl of <HI>Lanerk</HI> had from the very beginning of the War been al∣ways disposed to Peace, so shortly after this by his Dexterity and In∣fluence, a Treaty was set on foot be∣twixt the King and the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Lordship, with the Earls of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and <HI>Loudon</HI> being appoint∣ed Commissioners for that end, in pur∣suance of which laudable design they repair'd to his Majesty as soon as he was at the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and under∣took to invade <HI>England</HI> with an Army to restore him to his just Rights, and in order to this they proposed to him many Conditions which would be necessary for his Ma∣jesty to perform toward the Nation, without whichit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not be easie to induce them to be so un∣animous in an Engagement for him, as was necessary for such an Enterprise. They requir'd that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should be present with them, and march in the Head of their Army. That such a number of <HI>Scots</HI>-Men should be always in the Court, of the Bed-chamber, and all other Places about the Persons of the King, Prince, and Duke of <HI>York.</HI> That <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carlyle</HI> should be put into their Hands. They demanded moreover, that as soon as his Majesty could with Freedom, Honour and Safety be present in a free Parliament, to confirm the <HI>So¦lemn League</HI> and <HI>Covenant</HI> by Act of Parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History.</NOTE>, providing that none who was unwilling should be con∣strain'd to take it. They likewise oblig'd his Majesty to confirm Pres∣byterian Government in <HI>England</HI> for three Years, and after the Expira∣tion of that time, such a Govern∣ment shall be determined by his Ma∣jesty and the two Houses of Parliament as was most agreeable to the Word of God. That an effectual course shall be taken for the suppressing of all Heresies, and all Principles and Practices contrary to the Princi∣ples of Christianity. This Agree∣ment

his Majesty was pleased to sign the 26 of <HI>December</HI> 1647<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Clarendon in his History has the Substance of the Treaty.</NOTE>, and to oblige himself <HI>in the Word of a King to perform his part of the Treaty,</HI> as the Commissioners also engaged themselves, <HI>upon their Honour, Faith and Conscience, and all that is dear to honest Men, to endeavour to the utmost of their Power that the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland <HI>should engage to perform what was on its part to be performed.</HI></P>
<P>Any Body who reads this Treaty, in which his Majesty's Concessions are so full, could scarcely have thought that any Party would not have been perfectly pleased with it, and so all would indifferently concur in that dutiful, loyal and generous Design of relieving the King, then made a close Prisoner by <HI>Oliver Crom∣well</HI> and the Officers of the Army: but the rigid Clergy and the Lords of that Side, not only declared a∣gainst the Engagement as unlawful and sinful<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bishop Guthrie's Memoirs.</NOTE>, and all the Persons who advanc'd and promoted it as Deserters of the Covenant, but also raised what Force they could in the <HI>Western</HI> Counties to oppose it, which at last came to be formed into a kind of an Army under the Command of the Earls of <HI>Eglintoun, Lowdoun,</HI> and some of the leading Clergy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, whom for Respect to their Character, as Church men, I won't name. Against this illegal Insurrection the Committee of Estates ordered some Troops to be levied, which the Earl of <HI>Lanerk</HI> was chosen to command, but his Lordship was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sincerely &amp; throughly devout∣ed to preserve the Peace of his Coun∣try, and to accommodate Matters calm∣ly and without Blood, that he brought the Matter to an Agreement very much against his Mind, and to his Prejudice; yet so violent and Per∣fidious, beyond what can be imagin'd, were these Times, that tho' my Lord <HI>Lanerk</HI> comply'd with them in their own Terms, in whatever they de∣manded, yet knowing his Lordship to be a through-paced Loyalist, and that his Principles were quite opposite to their Designs, they resolved to be rid of him at any rate: and therefore, without the least Pretence of any Breach of any Article of their Treaty, they put him under a Restraint, re∣solving to send him to their Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> who had by this time barbarously murder'd the King, to be punish'd as an Incendiary, that is, to have his Head cut off; wherefore he thought it his most adviseable course to get out of the sight of the Calamity of his Country, and to re∣tire beyond Sea, which he did into <HI>Holland,</HI> with an offer of his Service to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>And brought with him,</HI> says the Lord <HI>Clarendon, A Heart and Affection clearer and less clogg'd with Scruples and Reservations for the King's Service, than any other of the Nation had.</HI> When his Lord∣ship arrived at the <HI>Hague,</HI> he first came to know that he was Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> by the Slaughter of his Brother, this sad News afflicted him so much, that he kept his Chamber for some Days, without so much as waiting on the King, who sent a gracious Message to him to condole for the loss of his Brother: And all the Lords, and other persons of Quali∣lity about the King made their Visits of Condolence to him with all Civili∣ty. His Grace stayed in the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI> till the King and the Commis∣sioners from <HI>Scotland</HI> had agreed to the Terms on which they would make him their King: My Lord Duke being very instrumental to prevailupon his Majesty to submit to the most rigid Terms the Kirk requir'd of him. At the same time, in the end of the 1649, his Majesty was pleased to acknow∣ledge and recompense the Dukes Loyalty and Merit, by bestowing the

<HI>Garter</HI> on him as a distinguishing mark of his Royal Favour. He accom∣panyed his Majesty to <HI>Scotland Anno</HI> 1650, but his Enemies would not permit him to come to Court; so having given his Majesty the best Advice he could, with his leave, he retir'd to the Isle of <HI>Arran,</HI> where he stayed till the Parliament met at <HI>Stirling</HI> in 1651, then his Grace was suffered to come to Court, being wel∣comed by the King, and nearest in his Confidence. So soon as the Army was rais'd for restoring the King, my Lord Duke rais'd a Troop of Horse for his Majesty's Service on his own Charge, with which he march'd to the fatal Battle of <HI>Worcester</HI> 3d of <HI>September</HI> 1651, charging the Enemy very vigo∣rously, he received a Shot in his Leg, whereby he fell into the Ene∣mies hands, and on the 11 of <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> died of his Wounds, and thereby prevented the being made a Spectacle as his Brother had been, which the Pride and Animosity of his Enemies would no doubt have caus'd to be, having the same Pretence for it by his being a Peer of <HI>England,</HI> as the other was. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> having furnish'd me a Character of this noble Duke in his History of the Civil War, I shall presume to insert it in his Words. <HI>He was</HI> (says that noble Lord) <HI>A Man not inferior in Wisdom and Parts of Understanding to the wisest Men of the Nation, of great Ho∣nour, Courage and Sincerity in his Na∣ture, and which was a rare Virtue in the Men of that time, was still the same Men he pretended to be, and in truth was in all Respects a very accomplish'd Person, of an excellent Judgement, and clear and ready Expression, and tho' he had been driven into several unwarrant∣able Actions, he made it very evident he had not been led by any Inclination of his own, and passionately and heartily run to all Opportunities of redeeming it, and in the very Article of his Death he express'd a marvellous Cheerfulness, that he had the Honour to lose his Life in the King's Service, and thereby to wipe out the Memory of his former Transgres∣sions which he always professed were odi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us to himself.</HI></P>

<P>When King <HI>James</HI> VII. came to the Throne, my Lord <HI>Arran</HI> was no less that Prince's Favorite than he had been his Brothers, for his Majesty named him one of the Grooms of the Bed-chamber, Master of the Wardrobe<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of James late Duke of Hamilton MS.</NOTE>, and conferred on him the Com∣mand of a Regiment of Horse<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>; also in <HI>April</HI> 1687, he elected him one of the twelve Knights of the most noble Order of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> called <HI>The Thistle</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Howels History:</NOTE>, which his Majesty was then pleased to revive.

<PB N="216" REF="226"/>
<HI>that which I cannot forbear believing is the King my Masters Right, for his pre∣sent absence from us in</HI> France <HI>can no more affect my Duty, than his longer absence from us has done all this while, and the Prince desiring our Advice, mine is, that we should move his Ma∣jesty to return and call a free Parlia∣ment for the securing our Religion and Property, which in my humble Opinion, will at last be found the best way to heal all our Breaches.</HI></P>
<P>His Lordships Constancy to the Interest of King <HI>James,</HI> even after the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was declared King of <HI>England,</HI> occasioned such a Suspicion of his Conduct, that he was sent Prisoner to the Tower<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">History of England Vol. III.</NOTE>, but being discharged some time after, he retir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for a time into <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Father's Death happening in the 1694. brought no Accession either o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Honour or Estate to the Earl, the same being hereditary to the Dutchess his Mother, who nevertheless, with the Consent of King <HI>William,</HI> before the end of that Princes Reign, resign∣ed that Title to him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Patent making the Earl of Arran Duke of Hamil∣toun bears Date at Loe the 10th of August 1698. but it allows him the Precedency by his G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd-father's Creation, 12th of July 1643.</NOTE>, whereby he became a Peer.</P>
<P>His Grace for many Years after was not engaged in any publick Affairs except Parliamentary ones as they occurred, where he ever on all oc∣casions show'd a tender Concern for the Honour and Prosperity of <HI>Scotland,</HI> more particularly in the great Op∣position he made in the Union of the two Kingdoms, which as it did de∣monstrate his entire Affection to his Country, so on that account it c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allenges a just Esteem and honour∣able Remembrance of his Memory as a noble Patriot by all the Lovers of their Country to perpetuity.</P>
<P>The Matter of the Union being concluded in Parliament, his Grace retir'd to his Country House in <HI>Staffordshire</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">History of Europe for the 1708.</NOTE>, upon the News of the Invasion from <HI>France Anno</HI> 1708, he was by Order of the Council taken into the Custody of a Messenger up∣on Suspicion of his being privy to that Expedition; but his Grace was admitted to Bail, the Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>New∣castle,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Whartoun,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hailyfax</HI> being Surities for him. Whatever sinister Opinion some in <HI>England</HI> might entertain of the Duke at this Juncture, it's certain the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility had quite different Senti∣ments of him, for on the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> at a solemn Election of the Peers, to testify the Honour and E∣steem they had of him, he was nomi∣nated and chosen one of the Sixteen Peers to the ensuing Parliament.</P>
<P>When things came to take a new turn at Court, upon her Majesty's change of her Ministry, his Grace was on the 1st of <HI>October</HI> 1710, ap∣pointed Lord Lieutenant of the Coun∣ty <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Lancaster</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">History of Europe for the 1710.</NOTE> in the room of <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Darby,</HI> and on the 13th of <HI>December</HI> thereafter, he was sworn of the Privy Council<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"> Ibidem.</NOTE>, and accordingly took his place at the Board; Also in the Month of <HI>June</HI> 1711, the Queen was pleased to make him a Peer of <HI>Great Britain</HI> by the Titles of Baron of <HI>Dutton,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Brandon,</HI> and the Preamble to his Patent runs thus. <HI>Cum generis claritate promeritorum praestantia, con∣stanti &amp; immaculata fidelitate, vel ad mortem usque &amp; sanguinis etiam pro∣pinquitate, Majores perquam fideles &amp; intime admodum dilecti Consanguinei &amp; Consiliarii Nostri Jacobi Ducis Hamil∣tonii, Machionis Clidsdaliae, Comitis Arraniae &amp; Lanarci, Domini Polmon∣tiae, Avenniae, Manchanshiriae &amp; Inner∣daliae, sese Praedecessoribus Nostris Re∣giis Gloriosissimae Memoriae plurimum commendaverint: Nos animadvertentes quod praedictus Jacobus Dux Hamiltoni praeclaris nobilissimae suae Familiae</HI>

<P>At the sitting down of the Parlia∣ment in <HI>December</HI> thereafter, the Duke claim'd his Place in the House of Peers, upon which many of the <HI>English</HI> Lords apprehending it might be dangerous to their Constitution to admit into their House a greater Number of the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers than were agreed to by the Act of Union, and therefore resolved to oppose the said Claim. Hereupon, <HI>Monday</HI> the 10th, a Motion was made for taking that Matter into Consideration, which was done accordingly, but after a few Speeches the Debate was ad∣journ'd to the 12th. and after some time spent therein, the further Con∣sideration of that Business was put off till the 20th. Upon which Day the Lords resum'd the Debate, the Queen being present <HI>incognito,</HI> after learned Council in the Law for her Majesty, the House of Lords and the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> several Speeches were made on both sides, so that the Debate lasted till near Eighth in the Evening, when the Question was put whether the Twelve Judges should be consulted with, which being car∣ried in the Negative by Fourteen Voices, Proxies included. Another Question was put, Whether <HI>Scots</HI> Peers created Peers of <HI>Great Britain</HI> since the Union, have a Right to sit in that House, which was also carried in the Negative by five Voices.

It was at that time likewise, I'm told, that the Writs and Evidents of <HI>Bombie</HI> were destroyed, which is the Reason I have not seen much concerning them before that Period, tho by the Tra∣dition they were then so numerous and well spread in Branches, that there were no fewer than twelve Knights of the Name, concerning some of whom I have seen Writings which make them very considerable in the Government of <HI>Murdoch</HI> Duke of <HI>Albany.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">I have seen a Charter in the Hands of Robert Maclellan of Barclay in the 1422, wherein there is mention of Sir John Maclellan of Gelstoun▪ The rest of the Knights of the Maclellans before the Forfaulture. the Tradition says, were Ravenstoun, Kilchrichie, Sorby, Glenshinnock, Troquhain, Barholm, Kirkonell, Kirkormock, Kirkgaunan, Bar∣drochat, Borg, Coven and Barscob, all extinct save the last, which of consequence is an ancient Family.</NOTE></P>

and entered into the Service of the greatest General of that Age, <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Sweden</HI> against the Imperialists, where he performed such great Actions as procured him a general Estimation, and thereby gained so much Honour, that the King promoted him to be Lieute∣nant General and then Velt Marshal of his Armies, with general Appro∣bation, as a Person who well deserved the Preferment.

Paliament's Forces obtained their great Victory at <HI>Marston-Moor</HI> 16. <HI>July</HI> 1644, where a noble and judici∣ous Memoirist of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, I mean the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> does Gener∣al <HI>Lesly</HI> the Honour, as well as the Justice, to ackowledge that his Lordship, who commanded the <HI>Scots</HI> Horse, and his Country-man Major General <HI>Crawford,</HI> who was Major Ge∣neral to the Earl of <HI>Manchester</HI>'s Bri∣gade, <HI>were the Persons who did the principal Service that Day,</HI> quite con∣trary to what another celebrated Historian of the same Nation says of the General's Conduct in the Battle: Only it is to be observed, that that Author's Account of this Affair is wrote with so much Rancor and Pre∣judice, and with such Circumstances of Inconsistency, that the manner of the Narrative takes off much of the Credit of what he wrote in that Matter.</P>
<P>In the Year 1648, when the Estates of <HI>Scotland</HI> raised an Army for the Relief of King <HI>Charles,</HI> when he was made a Prisoner in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> General <HI>Lesly</HI> so well preserved his Reputation with those of his own Country, who wedded the King's In∣terest most, that he had the Com∣mand of the Army offered him; but he thought fit to decline it upon Ac∣count of his Age and Infirmities: which was happy for him consider∣ing the unfortunate Issue of it.</P>
<P>After the Murder of the King, his Lordship appeared mighty earnest and forwad for restoring of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the Re-establishment of our Old Constitution, and frankly entred into those Designs and Mea∣sures that were set on foot for the raising an Army for his Majesty's Service, and was at the Battle of <HI>Dumb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> in Person, in the Quality of a Volunteer. After the Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army there, and when another Design was set on foot, for raising an Army to march with the King in∣to <HI>England,</HI> no Body appeared more forward in that Service than his Lord∣ship; but while General <HI>Monk</HI> lay before <HI>Dundee,</HI> the old General, with several other Noblemen, having ap∣pointed a Meeting at <HI>Eliot</HI> in <HI>Angus,</HI> to consult of Means to relieve the Town, and other Matters concern∣ing the War, of which <HI>Monk</HI> having got Advertisement, sent a strong Party of Horse and Dragoons, commanded by Colonel <HI>Morgan,</HI> to surprise them: Which he did in the Night, and the old General and the Principals of them being taken, were sent to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and committed Prisoners to the <HI>Tower.</HI> And notwithstanding all the Services he had done the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, his Lordship did not re∣ceive the least Favour from them, nor from <HI>Cromwel;</HI> but underwent Sequestration, and all other Severities the most loyal of his Country-men suffered: But the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> having entred into an Alliance with the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> her <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> Majesty, calling to Remem∣brance the great Services perform∣ed by General <HI>Lesly</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was pleased to interpose by her Resident then at <HI>London</HI> for his Liberation; which being obtained, his Lordship was so sensible of the Honour that Princess had done him, that to shew his Gratitude for so sin∣gular a Favour, he went over in Per∣son to <HI>Sweden,</HI> to return her Ma∣jesty his humble and hearty Thanks. At which Court his Lordship was treated with all the Civility and Re∣spect due to his Quality and Merit, and returning thence to his Native Country, lived mostly at his Seat of <HI>Balgony</HI> in a voluntary Retirement, till Death put a Period to his Life, some time of the Year 1662, leav∣ing Issue by <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, Daugh∣ter of <HI>— Renton</HI> of <HI>Billy, Alex∣ander</HI> Lord <HI>Balgony,</HI> likewise five Daughters.</P>

<P>From this Sir <HI>Alexander Fraser</HI> is Sir <HI>Peter Fraser</HI> of <HI>Dores</HI> Baronet descended in a lineal Course of Suc∣cession, as appears from his Writings, which proves the Family beyond Dispute to be one of the most ancient and best extracted Families in the County of <HI>Kincardin,</HI> where it hath still remained, and, except for a short Interval, still continues with Lustre.

<P>The Family of <HI>Lovat,</HI> which this Title leads me more particularly to treat of, as it is one of the best ex∣tracted, so it is one of the most noble and most numerous of all the <HI>Frasers.</HI> They are derived from Sir <HI>Simon Fraser</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Alexander Fraser,</HI> and Nephew to King <HI>Robert</HI> I. who obtained the Barony of <HI>Lovat,</HI> and other fair Possessions in the northern Parts, by Marriage of the Heir Female of the <HI>Bissets,</HI> in the latter end of King <HI>David</HI> II. whose Arms he thereupon took into his own, and which is still bore by his Descendants. The Wealth and Repu∣tation of the <HI>Lovat</HI> Family was not a little advanced thereafter by the marrying of a Lady of the <HI>Fentouns,</HI> whom <HI>Hugh Fraser</HI> of <HI>Lovat</HI> took to Wife in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Geneal Famil.

Upon the Death of King <HI>James</HI> I. he was by the Advice and Consent of the three Estates of Par∣liament appointed Tutor to the young King <HI>James</HI> II. whose Person was still in the Custody of Sir <HI>William Crichton</HI> the Chancellor, in the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> of which he was Go∣vernor; tho very probably he was

kept by him contrary to Law: Wherefore that Sir <HI>Alexander Living∣ston</HI> on whom the Parliament had conferr'd that high Trust might get the King's Person into his own Cu∣stody, he fell upon this Stratagem to bring it about.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother was intirely in Sir <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Interest, and to effectuate her Purpose cometh from <HI>Stirling</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> pretending a friendly Visit to her Son, which the Chancellor very willingly allow∣ed her in the Castle several Days: During which Time she cajolled the Prince into an Obedience to her Will, and the Chancellor into a Be∣lief that she designed nothing but what she own'd: At length she told the Chancellor, that she would but stay one Night longer in the Castle, being the next Day to set out for <HI>Whitekirk</HI> in <HI>Buchan,</HI> to perform a Vow which she had made for the Health of the King, whose Person she earnestly recommended to his Care till she should return. He assured her of his Fidelity both in that and all o∣ther respects, and so left her. Thus all Eyes, but those of a trusty Few being asleep, the young King was carefully put up in a Chest among his Mother's Furniture, and then convoyed to <HI>Leith,</HI> and from thence by Water to <HI>Stirling;</HI> where Sir <HI>Alex∣ander Livingston,</HI> and those of his Party received him with great Joy.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Alexander Livingstoun</HI> having thus got the young King into his Cu∣stody, in order to countenance his after Actions; he began to carry with a very high Hand, as being assured that none would dare to controul him, in so much that he created many Ene∣mies to himself, and among the rest the Queen Mother, whom upon Sus∣picion or Pretence that she and Sir <HI>James Stewart</HI> her Husband were carrying on some Intrigue with the Earl of <HI>Douglas,</HI> committed Sir <HI>James</HI> to Prison, and the Queen her self to a narrow Apartment in the Castle of <HI>Stirling,</HI> which so much incensed her, that she resolv'd upon Revenge, and being as yet Mistress of her Son's Inclinations, very soon brought a∣bout a second Turn of Affairs at Court: For while Sir <HI>Alexander Livingston</HI> was at <HI>Perth,</HI> employed in the pub∣lick Affairs,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Drummond's Hist. of King James the II.</NOTE> She carried on a Plot so closely and dextrously with the Chancellor, that one Morning as the King was Hunting in the Park of <HI>Sirling,</HI> his small Retinue were on a sudden surrounded with a Body of about 4000 Horse commanded by the Lord Chancellor in Person, so that the King was carried off, without any Opposition, to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he was welcomed by the Acclamations of the People.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Alexander Livingston,</HI> upon Advice of what had happened, came to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and wisely considering that the Chancellor could not more proba∣bly stand his Ground amidst so many Difficulties without him, than he had done without his Assistance, he thought the best way was to endeavour to bring him to Terms of Accommo∣dation, which by the Mediation of the Bishops of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> was at length effected; the Chancellor continuing in his Office as formerly, and the Custody of the King's Person was again committed to Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> which high Trust he executed with great Fidelity, till the 1444, that the King now arriv'd to the Age of 14 Years, began to govern in some Measure by himself. Soon after which, the Earl of <HI>Douglas</HI> became the prin∣cipal Favourite at Court, who bear∣ing no good Will to Sir <HI>Alexander Liv∣ingston</HI> or any of the former Mini∣stry, prevail'd so far with the King as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o call a Parliament: Which accord∣ingly

Thither he and others of his Party were Summon'd to Answer to such Accusations, as should be ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ited a∣gainst them. Sir <HI>Alexander</HI> was ac∣cused of having alienated the Crown Lands, wasted the Royal Revenues, and seized upon the King's Jewels, the Furniture of his Houses, and what else he could divert to his own pri∣vate Use: In consequence of which he was declared Rebel, his Estate confiscated, and sent Prisoner to <HI>Dun∣bartoun,</HI> there to remain during Plea∣sure. This Treatment of Sir <HI>Alex∣ander</HI>'s was thought very hard: But the Fate of <HI>William Livingston</HI> his second Son, Sir <HI>Robert Livingston</HI> of <HI>Drumray</HI> late Lord Treasaurer was much harder; for they were both beheaded in the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where Au∣thors say that Mr. <HI>Livingston</HI> being a young Man of admirable Parts and great Eloquence made such a moving Discourse upon the Vanity of the World, and the Vicissitude of humane Affairs, as drew Tears from the Eyes of all that were present. But after some time of Imprisonment, the King was pleased to restore Sir <HI>Alexander Liv∣ings<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> to his Estate, call'd him to his Council, and constituted him Ju¦stice General of <HI>Scotland, Anno</HI> 1449<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foedera.</NOTE>.

<P>ACcording to the Custom of Fami∣lies of the greatest Antiquity, this of <HI>Lowdon</HI> seems to have taken its Sirname from the Lordship of <HI>Low∣don</HI> in the County of <HI>Air,</HI> where it flourished in the earliest Ages, as one of the most considerable in that Shire; for 'tis certain from very clear Ac∣counts, that in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> called the <HI>Lyon, Richard Morvil</HI> Lord High Constable of <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave the Barony of <HI>Lowdon Jacobo filio Lambi∣ni</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Lowdon.</NOTE>, who assum'd a Sirname from thence, and left it with his Lands to his Posterity: But it did not last a full Century in the Male-Line, for it be∣came extinct in <HI>James de Lowdon,</HI> whose Heir Female was married to Sir <HI>Reynald Crawfurd</HI> Knight, a Branch of the Family of <HI>Crawfurd</HI> in the County of <HI>Lanerk,</HI> who besides the Barony of <HI>Lowdon,</HI> had Possession of many other Lands in <HI>Lanerk</HI>-Shire the paternal Estate of his Ancestors, and had the Honour to execute the Office of high Sheriff of the County of <HI>Air</HI> in the 17th of King <HI>Alexander</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 1228<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chartulary of Kelso in the Lawyers Libra∣ry MS.</NOTE>; by which Title he's a frequent Witness to the Grants of that Prince to the Religious of <HI>Kelso</HI> Abbey, which is all I can find in History concerning him proper to be inserted here.

<P>When the Troubles broke out in the Year 1637, the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was one of the most leading of the Peers, who testified a Dislike of the Ways and Me∣thods had been taken in Reference to the Liturgy, and the other In∣novations then brought into the Church; and assoon as the Party who pressed for Reformation, did resolve themselves into Societies, his Lord∣ship was one of the Nobility who were chosen to conduct their Affairs, and to represent their Grievances, which he did in a Speech before the Coun∣cil on the 21<HI>st</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> to this Purpose. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That by the Methods lately taken, it appeared there was an entire new Model of Government in Church and State intended; That the late Service Book, and the Book of Canons, which were then set out and imposed on the Nation, had passed no Approbation of the As∣sembly, nor any Convocation of of the Clergy, nor had been so much as communicated to the Privy-Council, but appeared to be so ma∣ny new Laws imposed on the King∣dom by the King's sole Authority, contarary to the established Laws of the Land, merely contrived by the Bishops, on whom he craved Justice in a legal way."</Q></P>
<P>When his Majesty had raised an Ar∣my against the Covenanters in 1639, and was advanced as far as the Bor∣ders, my Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> was one of the Peers who signed an Address to the King, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lamenting their ill Fortune, that their Enemies had so great Credit with his Majesty as to per∣swade him to believe that they were or could be disobedient to him; a Thing that could never enter into their loyal Hearts; that they desired nothing but to be admitted into the Presence of their gracious Sove∣reign, to lay their Grievances at his Royal Feet, and leave the Deter∣mination of them entirely to his own Wisdom and Pleasure."</Q></P>
<P>The Humility of the Stile wrought so upon the King's Nature, who thought it great Pity that any Blood should be spilt in a Contention which he himself might put an End to by his own Royal Word, as soon as he should hear their Complaints; That he easily consented to bring the Business to a fair Treaty, to which the Earl was named one of the Commissioners up∣on the Part of the Covenanters, and who accordingly met with such <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Commissioners as his Majesty was pleased to appoint at the <HI>Berks,</HI> where they entred upon, and concluded a Pa∣cification, whereby <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Armies were to be disbanded; an Act of Oblivion pass'd; the King's Forts and Castles to be restored, and a Parliament and a General Assem∣bly to be called, for a full Settle∣ment, &amp; that thereby all Factions &amp; Animosities might be reconciled and composed."</Q> But this Peace was of a very short Duration; for the Pacification being ill kept on both Sides, the King disowning what had been said to have been trans∣acted upon his Part, and the Co∣venanters remitting nothing of their
<PB N="286" REF="296"/>
Zeal against the Bishops and the Liturgy, having likewise entred a Pro∣testation <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they did not intend by any Thing contained in the Treaty to vacate any of the Pro∣ceedings which had been in the late General Assembly of <HI>Glasgow</HI>:"</Q> By these Proceedings the Breach became greater and wider, and Preparations for War began to be renewed on both Sides with more Vigour than ever. But before Things should come to the last Extremity, and that, if possible, Matters might be composed without Blood, his Majesty thought fit to re¦quire the Covenanters to send some Persons intrusted by their Body to at∣tend him, to give an Account of their Proceedings, and which was the Thing they always most desired. Accord∣ingly certain Commissioners were named, of which Number the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was one. At this Time when the Commissioners repaired to <HI>London</HI> there happened to be a Letter inter∣cepted, and transmitted to his Maje∣sty, that had been signed by the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> and the chief of the Cove∣nanters, written to the <HI>French</HI> King, &amp; directed <HI>An Roy,</HI> a Stile only used by Subjects to their natural King: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In which they complained of the Hard∣ness &amp; Injustice of the Government that was exercised over them, put him in mind of the Dependence <HI>Scotland</HI> formerly had upon that Crown, and desired him now to take them into his Protection, and give them Assistance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History of the Civil War.</NOTE>."</Q> This Let∣ter being seen and perused by the Lords of the Council of <HI>England,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> being examin∣ed, and refusing to give any other Answer than, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was writ before the Agreement; and there∣upon reserved, and never sent, that if he had committed any Offence, he ought to be questioned for it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp; not in <HI>England;</HI> &amp; insist∣ing upon his safe Conduct, demand∣ed Liberty to return."</Q> But notwith∣standing all the Defences the Earl was able to make, he was commit∣ted Prisoner to the Tower, and tho his Commitment was highly resented by the Parliament, as a Breach of the publick Faith, yet he continued in Prison some Months thereafter, till, by the Interposition and Intercession of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> he was en∣larged on the 27<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1640<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet's History of the two Dukes of Hamilton.</NOTE>, when his Lordship renewed all Pro∣fessions of Duty to the King, and a Readiness to engage in his Service, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon as he should return to his native Country, (where his Power &amp; Interest was as great as any Mans,) which he did by disposing all those upon whom he had Influence to hearken to all Over tures for a Peace with his Majesty. But notwithstanding all the Endea∣vours of the Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> and others, who heartily desired an Accommoda∣tion, Matters came to a second Rup∣ture, and upon a Party of the Cove∣nanters having routed the Lord <HI>Con∣way</HI> at <HI>Newburn,</HI> who appeared for the King, and having taken <HI>Newcastle,</HI> they thought fit after that to pre∣sent a humble Petition and Address to the King for a new Treaty, which his Majesty condescending to, and <HI>Rippon</HI> being named the Place of Meeting, the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was appointed one of the Commissioners for the Treaty. But all they they did there was only to agree to a Cessation of Arms, a safe Conduct being granted to his Lordship and the rest of his Collegues for going to <HI>London</HI> to carry on and conclude the Treaty there: Which they did with all possible Dili∣gence, and which his Majesty confir∣med, and the Lords of the Privy Coun∣cil were made the Conservators of the Peace, during the Interval of Par∣liaments.</P>
<P>The Peace betwixt the two Nations being thus happily concluded, it was judged necessary that the Treaty
<PB N="283" REF="297"/>
should be ratified by the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which in the 1641, his Ma∣jesty was pleased to hold himself in his own Royal Person, for the full Sa∣tisfaction of his People, and where∣in all Particulars that had been in Dispute were adjusted to the seem∣ing Joy and Satisfaction of every Man, and the Security of all that was then established was sufficiently provided for. In the End of the Session his Ma∣jesty was pleased to bestow Honours and Offices on some principal Per∣sons, who had merited well at his Hands, and who were best able to serve him; so the Chancellour's Place was bestowed upon the Lord <HI>Lowdon,</HI> during Life, and that with the full Consent and Approbation of the Par∣liament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rescinded Acts of Parliament.</NOTE>, who looked on him, as he was throughout the whole Kingdom, as a very wise Man, excellently fitted and qualified for the Discharge of that great Trust, as the Exigence of Affairs then stood.</P>
<P>When the Civil War broke out in <HI>England,</HI> the Chancellour repaired to the King at <HI>York</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History.</NOTE>, when his Majesty did so fully satisfy his Lordship with the Justice and Honour of his Carriage toward his <HI>English</HI> Parliament, that he wrote to the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners at <HI>London,</HI> in the Name and by the Directi∣on of the Lords of the Secret Council; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they should present to the two Houses, the deep Sense they had of the Injuries and Indignities which were offered to the King, whose just Rights they were bound to desend, and that they should conjure them to bind up those Wounds which were made, and not to widen them by Sharpness of Language, and to give his Majesty such real Security for his Safety among them, by an effectual declaring against Tumults, and such other Actions as were just∣ly offensive to his Majesty, that he might be induced to reside nearer to them, and comply with them in such Propositions as should be reasonably made<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</Q> Soon after which, taking leave of the King, his Lordship renew∣ed all imaginable Professions of Duty to his Majesty, and a Readiness to in∣gage in his Service; which the King was very well assured he could do.</P>
<P>In the 1643, the Chancellour was sent Commissioner from the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who called them∣selves <HI>the Conservators of the Peace be∣tween the two Kingdoms,</HI> to his Majesty while he was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> desiring to pass as a Mediator betwixt the King and the two Houses in <HI>England,</HI> when his Lordship used all Importunity and Arguments to perswade the King in private to consent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> assuring him that it would be a Mean not only to hinder the Sub∣jects of <HI>Scotland</HI> from adhering to the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, but that it would oblige them to assist his Majesty to the outmost, in the Vindication of all his Rights: But he found the King too strongly fixed to be sway'd, in what he thought a Case of Conscience, by a Consideration of Convenience.</P>
<P>He then betook himself to his own proper Errand, which consisted of two Parts; the one, to offer the Media∣tion of the Conservators of the Peace of the Kingdom, for the Composure of the Differences between his Maje∣sty and the two Houses; the other, to desire his Majesty that he would summon a Parliament in <HI>Scotland.</HI> In Answer to the first Demand of Medi∣ation; His Majesty told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he could not find any colour or pretence of Authority granted by the Act of Pacification, by which the Commissioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> could conceive themselves interest∣ed in a Faculty of Mediation; that the Clause mentioned by them re∣lated only to the Differences that might grow between the two Nati∣ons, which his Majesty said had
<PB N="284" REF="298"/>
been and should be inviolably ob∣served by him; and therefore he could not admit of any such Medi∣ation as they proposed."</Q> For the other Demand, of a Parliament in <HI>Scotland;</HI> The King told him and the rest of the Commissioners, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That against the Time by which they could legally demand a Parliament, naming the Day, which was to be on the first Tuesday of <HI>June</HI> 1644, he would issue out his Writs, and there being no emergent Cause to do it sooner, he would forbear to put his Subjects there to that Trouble, which those Meetings (how necessary soever) would na∣turally carry with them."</Q> So his Lordship perceiving that he should not receive Satisfaction in either of these Proposals, at last returned home <HI>re infecta.</HI></P>
<P>In the 1644, when his Majesty did renew his Offer of Peace to the two Houses of Parliament, which they likewise agreeing to, and <HI>Uxbridge</HI> be∣ing assigned for the Place of Meeting, the Chancellour, the Earl of <HI>Lawder∣dale,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Erskine,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ro∣bert Barclay</HI> Member of Parliament for the Burgh of <HI>Irvine,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A∣lexander Henderson</HI> (in Matters only which related to the Church) were sent Commissioners from <HI>Scotland:</HI> But that Treaty unhappily coming to nothing, a bloody civil War thereupon ensued.</P>
<P>When the King put himself into the <HI>Scots</HI> Army before <HI>New∣wark,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> positively de∣manded the Delivery up of the King's Person, the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> was ap∣pointed to treat with the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> about that important Af∣fair, where, in a free Conference with the two Houses, he publickly declar∣ed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That an eternal Infamy would ly upon the whole Nation, if they should deliver up the Person of the King, the securing of which was equally their Duty, as it was the Parliament's, and the Disposal of his Person in order to that Securi∣ty, did equally belong to them as to the Parliament: However he said, he would use all the Perswa∣sion, and all the Importunity he could with the King, that his Ma∣jesty might yield and consent to the Propositions the Parliament had sent to him."</Q></P>
<P>In the 1647, the Lord Chancel∣lour was one of the Commissioners appointed to attend the King from the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while he was at the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> to treat with his Majesty anent a full Accomodati∣on with that Kingdom, and which they at last concluded on Terms of great Advantage to the Nation; in Recompense of which, the Chancel∣lour and his Collegues undertook to raise an Army to rescue and relieve his Majesty from the Captivity he was then under, and to restore him to his just Rights, and that no Time might be lost, as soon as the Treaty was sign∣ed, the Chancellour departed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where (at first) he used his outmost Endeavours to procure such Persons to be elected Members to the Parliament, as he knew to be most inclined to the Service in hand, in which the Honour of the Country was so much concerned.</P>
<P>When the Parliament met on the 2d of <HI>March</HI> 1648<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rescinded Acts.</NOTE>, the Lord Chancel∣lour was chosen President of the Con∣vention, wherein he employed all his Power and Interest to bring the Par∣liament to comply with the Engage∣ment &amp; declare for the King; &amp; tho the Affair met with great Opposition, yet the Resolution was carried in put∣ting the Country in a Posture Defence, and raising an Army to relieve the King. I need not here recount the Fate of that Army which marched in∣to <HI>England</HI> under the Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> nor how unsucces∣full it proved for the Design it was in∣tended.<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>b</HI>) Cromwel's Indemnity to the People of Scotland.</NOTE>
<PB N="285" REF="299"/>
All I shall further observe is, that as there had been a Party in the Parliament whom the King's Conces∣sions did not satisfy, so they declared against the Engagement as unlawfull and ungodly, and the violent Party of the Clergy joining with them, they passed an Act against the <HI>Engagers,</HI> that was, all those who had been the Promo∣ters of it, ranking them into several <HI>Classes,</HI> whereby they were exclu∣ded from all Offices of publick Trust, and vote in Parliament till they had satisfied the Church by a publick Pro∣fession of their Repentance, for their Accession to the <HI>unlawfull Engagement</HI> as it was called.</P>
<P>When the Parliament met, after the Murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Lord Chancellour was chosen Presi∣dent of that Session, who by their 14 Act, proclaimed King <HI>Charles</HI> II. 'Tis beyond all Doubt the Chancel∣lour gave all imaginable Assistance he could to bring over the King from <HI>Holland,</HI> and to raise the Army that marched with his Majesty into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but that Army being unhappily defeated at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and the Usurpers absolutely prevailing over all the three Kingdoms; the Chancellour was not only outed of his Office, but was for ced, for the Security of his Person, to fly to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where he lay concealed, till the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> by vertue of his Majesty's Commission drew together a small Body of Horse and Foot for his Majesty's Service, that the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> repaired to him, for which he was for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited by the Powers that then prevailed; and thereafter when <HI>Cromwel</HI> granted an Indemnity to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both the Earl of <HI>Lowdon</HI> &amp; the Lord <HI>Ma¦chline</HI> his Son were particularly excep∣ted. After which his Lordship the Chancellour continued in the <HI>Hills</HI> till all Hope of serving the King was given over, that he capitulated to lay down his Arms, and live quietly at his own House, which he did in a Country Retirement, till it pleased God to bring back King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to his Throne, which the Lord <HI>Lowdon</HI> did not long survive, for he died in the Beginning of the 1663.

<P>In 1704 his Lordship was made one of the Lords of the Thesaury and one of her Majesty's Knights of the most noble Order of the Thistle; and the next ensuing Year her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was pleased to prefer him to be one of the principal Secretary's of State: In which Station his Lord∣ship served first in Conjunction with the Marques of <HI>Annandale,</HI> and there∣after with the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> to the ge∣neral Satisfaction of all Men, and the universal Approbation of the whole Nation, till after the Union of the Kingdom, that in the 1708 the <HI>Scots</HI> Secretary-Office was taken away; in Lieu of which, his Lordship was made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, which

<P>SOme who have enquired into the Antiquity of Sirnames with much Curiosity, think that the first Ancestor of this Family was one of those <HI>Scots∣men</HI> who fled from the Usurpation of <HI>Mackbeath</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and returned with <HI>Edgar Atheling</HI> and his Sister the Princess <HI>Margaret,</HI> afterward Wife to King <HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> upon the Inva∣sion by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and got Possessions in the Isle of <HI>Bute,</HI> in the Western Parts of this Realm, from whence they took the Demonation of <HI>Le Isle,</HI> which they kept after they came to be settled upon the Continent at <HI>Duchal-Castle</HI> in <HI>Renfrew</HI>-shire.

<P><HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Erskin</HI> was a Person of such noble Nature generous Dis∣position, and other bright Qualities, as rendred him very capable of act∣ing the Part of a most consummate Statesman, which he did afterward in the highest and most eminent Stations a Subject could attain to. Being at first a younger Brother, his Father judged the best way was to provide for him in the Church, and therefore having given him Education accord∣ingly, he was in due time made Com∣mendator of <HI>Inchmach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the end of King <HI>James</HI> V's. Reign, no doubt for his better Support in the prose∣cution of his Studies to qualif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him for a higher Office in the Church; but both his Brothers dying without Heirs of their Bodies, he was obliged to quit the Character of a Church∣man and marry, in order to raise up Heirs to the Family: Which he did, and matched with <HI>Annabella</HI> Daughter of <HI>William Murray</HI> of <HI>Tillibardin,</HI> Pa∣ternal Ancestor to the present Duke of <HI>Athole,</HI> by whom he had <HI>John</HI> his Successor, and a Daughter <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> married to <HI>Archibald</HI> Earl of <HI>Angus.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his Accession to the Honour, through the Demise of his Father, tho he was but then a very young Man, he had so fair a Reputation, and was so generally well esteemed, that the Queen Regent thought fit in the 1553,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dr. Anderson's History of Scotland MS. in Biblioth jurid Edin.</NOTE> to give his Lordship the Command of the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in which Station he behaved so well, that he preserved himself in the good Opi∣nion of the Queen's Majesty, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Mary</HI> returned from <HI>France Anno</HI> 1561, her Majesty hav∣ing made Choice of a new Privy Council, my Lord <HI>Erskine</HI> was named one of that Number, in which Stati∣on he soon rendred himself very gracious to the Queen, insomuch that she made him a Grant of the Abbey of <HI>Inchmachomoe</HI> and diverse other Church Lands then newly dis∣solved. His Interest at Court now being very great, he thought it a favourable Opportunity, and a pro∣per Season for him to renew his Claim to the Earldom of <HI>Mar,</HI> and having made good a Title through a long deduced Pedigree from <HI>Gratney</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> his Pretensions being supported by the Queen's Countenance,
<PB N="303" REF="313"/>
his Claim was allowed and ratified by Act of Parliament: And tho' my Lord <HI>Mar</HI> was a very zealous Prote∣stant, 'tis worthy our Remark, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> trusted him as much as she could have done any of her own Profession, which she did eminently manifest by the Confidence she repo∣sed in him, for as soon as she was hap∣pily delivered of the Prince, <HI>James</HI> VI. her Majesty committed him to the Tuition and Custody of the Earl, in the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> then under his Command, and he discharged that great Trust so well, and was so much superior to all Tentations of Infidelity that when the Earl of <HI>Bothwell</HI> had married the Queen, he could not pre∣vail with my Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> either by Pro∣mises or Menaces, to deliver up the Prince to him, which was the Thing in the World, that wicked Earl had set his Heart most upon, when 'tis known his Lordship could have made his own Terms: In the End, when <HI>Bothwell</HI> found all his Offers rejected, he was glad to allow the Earl to carry the Prince to <HI>Stirling</HI>-Castle, of which he himself was heritable Governor, and then delivered up <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Castle to <HI>Bothwell,</HI> on the 21st of <HI>May,</HI> 1566, who immediately plac'd a Crea∣ture of his own, Sir <HI>James Balfour,</HI> in it, by which Means, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> became, under God, the happy Instru∣ment of the Prince's miraculous Pre∣servation, during his long Minority: However, he still retained great Duty and Affection to the Queen, even af∣ter Things came to an Extremity; so it would appear, that nothing but a pure Principle of Conscience for the Preservation of the Heir of the King∣dom, first engaged his Lordship in the Company of those who set the Crown upon the Head of the Prince, when he was an Infant little more than one Year old. When the Civil War began, I do'nt find this generous and prudent Lord much engaged on either Side, for his particular Province being to take Care of his Royal Pupil, he stay'd himself much with him, and as he grew up in Years, gave him a Princely Education, appointing the famous Mr. <HI>Buchannan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peter Young,</HI> Mr. <HI>David Eriskine,</HI> Commen∣dator of <HI>Cambuskenneth,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A∣dam Erskine,</HI> Commendator of <HI>Dry∣burgh,</HI> to be his Instructors, Gentle∣men who wanted none of those Qua∣lities which were to be wished to be in the Persons to whom the Education of a great and hopeful Prince was com∣mitted, and for framing his Mind and Manners, in his young and tender Years.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Mar</HI> bore no publick Of∣fice in the State till the 1571, that upon the Death of <HI>Matthew</HI> Earl of <HI>Lennox,</HI> the Regent, the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> was a Nobleman so generally well esteemed, that he was, by the unanimous Con∣sent of the King's Party, chosen Re∣gent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in his Room, <HI>Sept.</HI> 5, 1571. In which great Office he had, says one, <HI>Less Satisfaction than he expected, for when he had strugled no less under the turbulent Councils of his own Party, than the Insolencies of his Adversaries, died for very Grief, after he had governed only Thirteen Months, upon the</HI> 28<HI>th of</HI> October 1572, <HI>and left behind him so unblemished a Reputation, as cannot be very easily parallel'd in the like Circumstances:</HI> He was interr'd in the Vault of his Family, among his Ancestors, in the Paroch Church of <HI>Alloa,</HI> under a plain Monument, with∣out any other Inscription, than signi∣fying him to be the Person there in∣terr'd.</P>
<P>To <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> succeeded <HI>John</HI> his Son, then under Age, of whom I have found little memorable, till the 1582, his Lordship being then very young, he was induced to join with others of the discontented Nobi∣lity, who seized on the King at <HI>Ruth∣ven</HI>-Castle, and petition'd his Majesty, that he would remove Sir <HI>James Stew∣art,</HI>
<PB N="304" REF="314"/>
who then stiled himself Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> from his Councils, being a Person of evil Fame, and Disaffection to the publick Peace of the Kingdom, and an Instrument of Discontent between the King and his Nobility: But the Way and Manner of that Enterprize being afterwards adjudged treaso∣nable, the Earl was obliged to give up the Command of <HI>Stirling</HI>-Castle, and to leave his Majesty's Dominions, which he did, and transporting him∣self into <HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence he came over to <HI>England,</HI> and joined the the Lord <HI>Hamiltoun,</HI> and others who had been outlaw'd during the Regency of the Earl of <HI>Mortoun,</HI> with whom he returned to <HI>Scotland Anno</HI> 1585, when he obtained his Majesty's Pardon, was restored to his Command of <HI>Stirling</HI>-Castle, and to a more than ordinary Share of his Majesty's Favour, which his Lordship never afterward forfault∣ed by any undutiful Behaviour.</P>
<P>In the 1593, when it pleased God to bless his Majesty with a Son, Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> the King reposing full Confi∣dence in his Lordship's Fidelity, com∣mitted the Tuition of his Royal High∣ness to him, and his Majesty was at the same Time pleased to write with his own Hand the following Letter to his Lordship.<LETTER>

<P>BEcause in the Security of my Son, con∣sisteth my Security, I have concredi∣ted to you the Charge of his Keeping, upon the Trust I have in your Honesty. This I command you out of my own Mouth, being in the Company of those I like, o∣therwise from any Charge that can come from me, you shall not deliver him; and in Case God call me at any Time, see that neither for the Queen, nor Estates, their Pleasure, you deliver him, till he be Eighteen Years of Age, and then he com∣mand you himself.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>How the Earl discharged this great Trust, will best appear from the Exoneration which his Majesty gave him, under the Great Seal, when his Lordship carried the Prince to <HI>London,</HI> upon his Father's Accession to the <HI>English</HI> Crown, a Copy of which I shall here insert.<Q>JAMES, <HI>by the Grace of GOD, King of</HI> Great-Britain, France, <HI>and</HI> Ireland, &amp;c. <HI>Whereas it is not un∣known, that upon just and necessary Con∣siderations, we did commit in the Year of our Lord</HI> 1596, <HI>the Custody of the Prince our Son, to our Right Trusty and well∣beloved Cousin and Councellor, the Earl of</HI> Mar, <HI>as well in Regard of our Secu∣rity, which consisteth in his Security, as in Respect there was none more fit to take that Charge than the Earl, of whose Sin∣cerity in Religion, Affection and Fidelity to our Person, to our State, together with his Discretion and Judgment, we have had so good Experience, having now otherwise resolved to dispose of him, and considering how just and necessary it is for us to give as ample a Discharge to our Cusin, the Earl of</HI> Mar, <HI>as may be. We do therefore first declare to all Persons whatsoever, by these Presents, That we have very great Cause most graciously to allow of that great Care which he hath shewed in providing for his vertuous E∣ducation. Next, That he hath observed our Directions for his Delivery. And lastly, That he hath been received in so good State of Health and Constitution of Body and Mind, that we have Occa∣sion not only to take Comfort in God's Favour thereby, so confirmed to us, but do now testifie and declare by Vertue of these present Letters, that we do discharge, acquit, and exonerate against us, our Heirs, and Successors, our said Cousin, the Earl of</HI> Mar, <HI>concerning the Edu∣cation and Delivery of our Son, as fore∣said, and do hereby notifie to the World, that we have received full and intire Satisfaction, answerable to the Trust re∣posed in him, and are resolved to lay it up in Memory, as a Record of his con∣stant Love and Duty towards us, and</HI>

<P>Neither are we to forget, That in the 1601, his Majesty sent him Am∣bassador to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to con¦gratulate that Princess, upon her sup¦pressing the audacious Attempt of the Earl of <HI>Essex:</HI> In which Negotiation, his Lordship deported himself with such Prudence and Conduct, that he brought the Principals of the <HI>English</HI> Ministry to favour his Majesty's Suc∣cession to that Crown, which took Effect in less than Two Years there after; which, upon another Occasion, his Majesty did very gratefully ac∣knowledge, and own, <HI>that next to the Goodness of God, he ascrib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the Earl of</HI> Mar<HI>'s last Negotiation in that Kingdom, his peaceab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Accession to the Crown of</HI> England.</P>
<P>His Majesty, upon his Accession to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> did not for∣get to dispense his Royal Favours to his Lordship: More particularly, he began with conferring the Garter u¦pon him, the Ensigns of which he was invested with on St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, <HI>A∣pril</HI> 23d, 1603, and shortly thereafter caused him to be sworn of his Maje∣sty's most honourable Privy-Council of <HI>England,</HI> and made him a Grant of sundry Abbacies and other Church-Lands then dissolved from the Crown. But his Majesty being still more and more desirous to confer greater Honours on his Lordship, was graciously pleased to constitute him Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Removal of Sir <HI>Robert Ker,</HI> Earl of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and had the White-Staff delivered to him, on the 2d of <HI>December</HI> 1615, in which Office he demean'd himself so well, that he did his Master much Service, and preser∣ved himself in the good Opinion and Acceptation of the whole Nation; and he had the Treasury so full at the King's coming down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in 1617, that the Court were entertain'd with the greatest Magnificence ima∣ginable, out of the Profits of the Crown, and it was observed by the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, who attended the King in that Progress, that his Ma∣jesty appear'd with no less Lusture at <HI>Holy-Rood-House</HI> than at <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>He continu'd in the Treasurer's Place till the 1630, his Lordship being grown aged and infirm, he resigned the Office, which was immediately put into the Hands of the Earl of <HI>Mor∣toun,</HI> and declining to be put into any other publick Employment, he reti∣red to his Seat in the Country, where Death put a Period to his Days, on the 16th of <HI>December,</HI> 1635, aged 79.</P>

<P><HI>John,</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> was made One of the Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> at the Creation of <HI>Henry,</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> on the 30th of <HI>May,</HI> 1610, and thereafter, <HI>July</HI> 20th, 1615, he was sworn of his Majesty's most honourable Privy-Council, and named One of the Sena∣tors of the College of Justice: Which Station he prudently and faithfully discharged till the 1626, his Lordship was removed upon a general Statute That no Peer could be an Ordinary Lord of the Session. Whether it was this or any other Act of Unkindness he met with from the Court, I cannot say, but 'tis certain, upon the first Ap∣pearance of the Troubles in 1638, his Lordship being then Governor of <HI>E∣dinburgh</HI>-Castle, his Majesty did not seem to be absolutely satisfied of the Affection of the Earl to his Service, and therefore removed him from that Command, and put the Castle into the Hands of Major General Ruth∣ven, as a Person on whom he could firmly rely, and yet his Majesty was willing that his Lordship's Remove might not be attended with any Act of Disobligation, and therefore gave him 3000 <HI>lib.</HI> which the Marquis of <HI>Hamiltoun</HI> gave Security for. When the Civil War broke out, he apply'd himself with great Resolution and Fi∣delity to the King's Service, and there∣fore was reckon'd among the first Rank of Malignants, and suffer'd ac¦cordingly.</P>
<P>He married <HI>Jean,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Francis,</HI> Earl of <HI>Errol,</HI> by whom he had <HI>John,</HI> his Successor in the Ho∣nour, and a Daughter, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> mar∣ried to <HI>Archibald,</HI> Lord <HI>Napier;</HI> and departing this Life in the 1654, was succeeded by</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> his Son, who, during the whole Course of the Civil War, most eminently signaliz'd his Loyalty to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. He was one of the Peers who joy'nd the Marquis of <HI>Montrose</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Philiphaugh;</HI> after which he had the General's Leave to capitulate, which he did upon no other Terms, than laying down his Arms, and living quietly at his own House, retaining always his Affection and Fidelity to the Crown, to his dying Day.</P>
<P>He married first, <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Walter,</HI> Earl of <HI>Bucleugh;</HI> and again, <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter of <HI>George,</HI> Earl of <HI>Seaforth.</HI> By her he had <HI>Charles,</HI> his Son and Heir, likewise Three Daugh∣ters.</P>

<P>In 1705, her Majesty promoted him to be Secretary of State, in the Room of the Marquis of <HI>Annandale;</HI> and the next ensuing Year, his Lord∣ship was named one of the Commissio∣ners to treat of an Union betwixt the Two Nations; which being agreed to by the respective Parliaments of both Kingdoms, his Lordship, throughout the whole Affair, merited so well of the Court, that he had a Pension settled on him, as an Equivalent for his Se¦cretary's Place; which was then sup∣press'd, and consolidated into the Se∣cretary-Office of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>In 1708, the Queen named his Lordship of her most honourable Pri∣vy Council, and striking in with the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> on the Change of the Ministry, he was in 1713, prefer'd to be Third Secretary of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which had been vacant from the Death of the Duke of <HI>Queens∣berry;</HI> in which eminent Station his Lordship continued till after the Death of his Mistriss, the Queen.

<P>The King, in Consideration of a great Sum of Money, say they, a Part of which he actually received, had con∣tracted his eldest Son, the Prince, to <HI>Elizabeth Dunbar,</HI> the Earl of <HI>March</HI>'s Daughter: But <HI>Archbald,</HI> Earl of <HI>Dou∣glas,</HI> having endeavoured all he could to obstruct the Marriage, and having great Interest with the King at the Time, prevailed with his Majesty to rescind the former Contract, and to substitute the Lady <HI>Marjory Douglas,</HI> his own Daughter, in Place of <HI>Eliza∣beth Dunbar.</HI> The Earl of <HI>March</HI>'s high Spirit being unable to bear so signal Affront, he therefore committed the Care of his Castle of <HI>Dunbar</HI> to Sir <HI>Robert Maitland</HI> of <HI>Leidingtoun,</HI> his Nephew, renounced his Allegiance to the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and withdrew into <HI>England</HI> with 100 Horse in his Retinue.

Borders of his native Country, making a great Havock wherever he came, especially upon the <HI>Douglas</HI>'s Lands, for which his Estate was forfaulted. But afterward he sued for Pardon to the Duke of <HI>Albany,</HI> then Governor, which having obtained, he returned to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he pass'd the Re∣mainder of his Life in great Concord with his Neighbours, and faithful Subjection to the Crown till his Death, which happen'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1416,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Baillie of Castlecarry's Historical Collections.</NOTE> lea∣ving Issue by <HI>Christian</HI> his Wife, <HI>George</HI> his Son and Heir, <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> Sir <HI>Gavin Dunbar,</HI> Kt. and Sir <HI>Patrick Dunbar</HI> of <HI>Beill.</HI></P>

<P>Yet such was the King's Bounty to∣wards the poor Earl, that commiserat∣ing his low Condition, his Majesty was graciously pleased to give him a Pension out of the Earldom of <HI>Buchan,</HI> which supported him according to his Quality, during his Life.</P>

Being a Baron of great Power and Autho∣rity on the Borders, the Duke of <HI>Al∣bany,</HI> when he was forming his unna∣tural Rebellion against his own Bro∣ther King <HI>James</HI> III. thought to se∣cure the Laird of <HI>Polwarth</HI> to his In∣terest, by giving him Lands and other Favours<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Marchmont.</NOTE>: But the Duke no sooner invaded his native Country by the Assistance of an <HI>English</HI> Army, than he joined the King's Forces, and did his Majesty so notable and eminent Services, that he had the same Lands confirmed to him by a Charter under the Great Seal, wherein his Services i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> resisting the <HI>English</HI> Invasion are set forth in very honourable Terms<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Charta in Publicis Archivis.</NOTE>.

<P>Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> his Son and Heir, who was born on the 13th of <HI>January</HI> 1641: Being young at his Father's Death, his Mother, a Lady eminent in all Vertue, took great Care of his Education under the best Masters, and he made such Proficiency in all the Parts of Learning that were proper for a Gentleman, that he fully answe∣red what could be expected from the most eminent Instructers.</P>
<P>In the 1665, he was chosen Knight of the Shire for the County of <HI>Berwick</HI> to the Parliament, wherein he serv'd with distinguishing Zeal for the Li∣berties of his Country, and upon eve∣ry Occasion oppos'd and contradicted all Taxes and Impositions on the Sub∣ject, that were not exactly according to Law.</P>
<P>In 1676, the Privy Council ha∣ving arbitrarily imposed a Tax upon the Shire of <HI>Berwick,</HI> that was not al∣together legal, Sir <HI>Patrick Hume</HI> was chosen to remonstrate against it, and to apply to the Lords of Session for Redress in the ordinary Course of Justice; which was so highly resented by the Council, as an Act of Insolence, and a Contempt of their Authority, that he was ordered to crave Pardon in the most submissive Manner, and to submit to their Sentence: But S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Patrick</HI> insisting on the Legali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of what he had done, and absol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ely re∣fusing to make any such Compliance for what he thought so solemn an Act of his Duty, his Attendance was continued from Day to Day, to his great Charge &amp; Vexation; &amp; when he could neither be persuaded nor threat∣ned to submit, was at length cast into Prison, in the Tolbooth of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he continued some Time, till he was sent under a strong Guard to <HI>Dumbartoun</HI>-Castle, and from thence to the Castle of <HI>Stirling,</HI> where he under∣went an Imprisonment of no less than 13 Months, with all the Circumstances of Severity and Rigour, till at Length, by the Interposition of some of his Re∣lations at Court, particularly the Countess of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> he ob∣tained his Liberty.</P>
<P>After this, Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> went to <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> but the Malice and Animosity of the chief Ministers of State was so great against him, that assoon as the Court had Notice of his being at <HI>London,</HI> it was resolved he should be apprehended and imprisoned as a Man worthy of their Fear; tho' they could not charge him with any Practi∣ces that were not precisely agreeable to the Duty of a good and faithful Subject, but only a Suspicion of his Disaffection to the Government from the Company he haunted, the Prin∣cipals of whom were the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and the Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> his near Relation. But Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> ha∣ving got timeous Warning of the De∣sign of the Court, thought it his most advisable Course, to step out of the Way, and travelling beyond Sea he retired to <HI>Geneva,</HI> from whence he came down to <HI>Holland,</HI> where he was received with great Kindness and Ge∣nerosity by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who looked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him as a Confessor for the Prot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant Religion, and the Liberties of his Country.

<P>Upon the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s coming to the Throne, Sir <HI>Patrick Hume</HI> having always with more than ordinary Zeal shown himself against a Popish Suc∣cessor to the Crown, which was the Sourse of all his Troubles, and King <HI>James</HI> having made open Profession of
<PB N="315" REF="325"/>
Popery, he joined with the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and came over with him in the Invasion 1685; but that Attempt being, by the Providence of GOD, overthrown, and the Party dispersed, Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> found Means to conceal himself in <HI>Air</HI>-Shire for Three Weeks, a Report being industriously spread abroad by his Friends, that he was dead, that the Search for him might be discontinued, till a Vessel was provided for him on the <HI>West-Coast,</HI> which in a few Days safely landed him at <HI>Dublin;</HI> but not think∣ing it safe for him long to continue in <HI>Ireland;</HI> for by this Time he was forfaulted and declared a Rebel, he went over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where he met with the same kind and generous Reception from the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as formerly, tho' perhaps not so avowedly: And there he continued to reside till the 1688, he came over with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in his Expedition to <HI>Britain.</HI> The Prince had so great an Esteem of his Sinceri∣ty to the Protestant Religion, and of his Fidelity and Affection to his Highness's Design, that he thought fit particularly to consult with Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> in that difficult Juncture: And when the Government was dissolved, upon King <HI>James</HI>'s withdrawing in∣to <HI>France,</HI> Sir <HI>Patrick Hume</HI> was one of the most leading and forward in the Address from <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to take upon him the Admi∣nistration of Affairs both Civil and Military, till a Meeting of the E∣states should be call'd to settle the Nation; which his Highness having call'd, Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> was chosen a Mem∣ber thereof for the Shire of <HI>Berwick,</HI> wherein he became very instrumen∣tal in bringing about the Revoluti∣on, and in procuring the Settling of the Crown on King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> Assoon as their Maje∣sties came to constitute a Privy Coun∣cil, Sir <HI>Patrick</HI> was nam'd a Privy Councellor, and appointed one of the Commissioners to treat of an Union betwixt the Two Nations; and as a farther Mark of their Royal Favour, he was raised to be a Peer of this Re∣alm, by the Title of Lord <HI>Polwarth</HI> of <HI>Polwarth,</HI> on the 26th of <HI>Decem∣ber</HI> 1690. wherein their Majesties did express their great Esteem of Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Services and Merit, in the Preamble of his Patent, in these Words,</P>

<P>Here I cannot omit taking Notice, that King <HI>William</HI> was pleased in the very Patent creating his Lordship in∣to

And that his Lordship might have the more In∣terest in his own County, and appear the more considerable there, their Ma∣jesties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> were pleased to constitute him Sheriff Principal of <HI>Berwick</HI>-Shire, on the 2d of <HI>Octob:</HI> 1692. And to aggrandize him more and more, he was named one of the Four Extraordinary Lords of the Session, and took his Place accor∣dingly the 28th of <HI>November</HI> 1693,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charra penes Comitem de Marchmont.</NOTE>. But these Employments being mostly honorary, that his Lordship might a little more effectually taste of the Royal Bounty, his Majesty was pleased to prefer him to be Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the 2d of <HI>May</HI> 1660<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, upon the Removal of the Marqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Tweddale;</HI> and the Title of Lord Baron, being thought too low a Degree of Honour for the Lord Chancellor, before his Lordship had continued one whole Year in the Place, his Majesty was pleased to augment his Honours, and therefore advanced him to be an Earl, by the Stile and Title of Earl of <HI>Marchmont,</HI> Viscount of <HI>Blassonberry,</HI> Lord <HI>Polwarth</HI> of <HI>Pol∣warth, Redbrays</HI> and <HI>Greenlaw,</HI> by Let∣ters Patent, 23d of <HI>April</HI> 1697<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, and the next ensuing Year was named High Comissioner to represent his Majesty's Person in Parliament, and was likewise one of the Commissioners both of the Treasury and Admiralty. After which he held the Chancellor's Place above Four Years, with the uni∣versal Approbation of the whole King∣dom, and the general Applause of all Men, for his Justice, Integrity, sound Judgment, and eminent Suffi∣ciency in the Discharge of that Of∣fice, a Praise which none of his Ene∣mies ever denied him in any Time. And the King his Master was so fully satisfied with his faithful Discharge of that and all the other great Em∣ployments committed to him, while he was the first and prime Minister of State, that he was pleased to give him a very ample Approbation of his Services, under the Great Seal, <HI>April</HI> 19th, 1700, wherein his Maje∣sty declared, <HI>Quod praefatus Comes, in omnibus muneribus a nobis concreditis, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andore &amp; integritate summa, cum ap∣probatione &amp; satisfactione nostra sese gessit &amp; exoneravit.</HI></P>
<P>In 1702, his Majesty was pleased to appoint the Lord Chancellor to be Commissioner to represent his Royal Person in the Assembly of the Church: But during the Sitting of the Assem∣bly, King <HI>William</HI> died, which did very sensibly affect his Lordship and all the hearty Lovers of the Revolu∣tion. His Commission being determi∣ned by the Death of the King, her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> the very Day she came to the Crown, granted a new Commission to the Lord Chancellor to represent her Royal Person, and hold her Place in the Assembly. In the End of 1702, her Majesty ha∣ving made some Alterations in the Mi∣nistry, the Earl of <HI>March<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont</HI> was removed from being Chancellor, to which Office the Earl of <HI>Seafield</HI> was preferred: But his Remove did not in the least diminish his Lordship's Zeal for what he thought the Interest of his Country, but rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eightned his publick Spirit; for having al∣ways most at Heart the Security of the Protestant Religion, and a Suc∣cessor
<PB N="317" REF="327"/>
to the Crown of that Religion, in the first Parliament after the Queen's coming to the Crown, the Earl was the first who proposed an Overture for settling the Succession to the Crown on the Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the Heirs of her Body, being Prote∣stants, in Default of Issue of her Maje∣sty Queen <HI>Anne;</HI> and at the same Time presented another Act for secu∣ring and settling the Presbyterian Go∣vernment in Doctrine and Worship, as being most agreeable to the Word of GOD. But tho' the first Overture did not at that Time take, the Par∣liament having a View of an Union with <HI>England,</HI> yet the last carried, and was approved by a great Majority: And when the Treaty of Union came before the Parliament, his Lordship there, as well as in the Commission of the General Assembly of the Church, us'd his utmost Endeavours to have it brought about, as the only Means he thought could secure Re∣ligion, and establish a firm and la∣sting Peace betwixt the Two Nati∣ons; a Protestant Successor to the Crown being thereby secured, which was the Thing his Lordship long'd most passionately to see before he should leave this World. And when that Settlement took Place by the Accession of King <HI>George</HI> to the Throne, his Majesty was pleased to restore the Earl to be Sheriff of <HI>Ber∣wick</HI>-Shire, on the 16th of <HI>November</HI> 1714, in the Room of the Earl of <HI>Hume,</HI> who had been made Sheriff in the End of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign.</P>

<P>In the 1593, when a Rising toward a Rebellion was threatned in the Northern Parts, His Majesty named the Earl Marischal his Lieutenant, with a Power to raise what Forces he should judge necessary for that Ser∣vice, and he behav'd so well through∣out the whole Affair, that he intirely suppress'd the Insurrection, without the Effusion of one Drop of Blood, which made his pacifick Master very much applaud and commend his Con∣duct.

<P>Which <HI>William,</HI> in the Time of the Civil War, adhered to the King, and upon his own Charge, levied a Troop of Horse, for his Majesty's Service, at the Head of which he behaved with great Courage at the Battle of <HI>Preston.</HI> Afterward remaining firm in his Fide∣lity to the Crown, he appear'd no less zealous for the Restoration of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. but while he was raising Forces by his Interest and Industry in the Northern Parts, he was surpriz'd at <HI>Eliot,</HI> and taken Prisoner by a Party of <HI>English</HI> detach'd from the Garison at <HI>Dundee, Anno</HI> 1560, and from thence sent to <HI>London</HI> by Sea, and imprisoned in the Tower; where, after Ten Years Imprisonment su∣stain'd with great Firmness and Con∣stancy, he lived to receive some Re∣ward of his Merit, after the Return of the King, who made him first a Privy Councellor, and afterward Lord Privy-Seal; which Office he dischar∣ged till his Death, in 1670.

<P><HI>William</HI> Earl Marischal his Son, who was not in the Measures of the Court, either in the Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> or in the first Years of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> was very opposite to the Union of the King∣doms;
<PB N="323" REF="333"/>
for, beside what other Reasons he might have for his Opposition, he thought his Family might suffer by the suppressing his heritable Office of Great Marischal of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with Relation to which he entred a Protestation in Parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rolls of Parliament.</NOTE>, before the Conclu∣sion of the Union, in these Words.</P>

<P>IF Tradition may be credited, the <HI>Melvils</HI> are as ancient in <HI>Scotland</HI> as the Reign of King <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. that a Gentleman from <HI>Hungary</HI> ac∣companied Queen <HI>Margaret</HI> the Wife of that Prince into this Realm, where he got Lands in <HI>Lothian,</HI> which he call'd <HI>Melvil</HI> after his own Name, and there fixed his Residence.

But what Bishop <HI>Beaton</HI> could not bring to pass, his Successor Bishop <HI>Hamilton</HI> effected, on Pretence of a treasonable Correspondence with the Nation's Enemies abroad, and the Matter was thus.

Of his Family was Dr. Archbald Graham, who in the 1680, was by King Charles II. preferr'd from being Parson of Rothsay to be Bishop of the Isles, where he exerced his Function, till the Revolution he was deprived of his Bishoprick.

<P>Lieutenant General <HI>John Middleton</HI> was the Son of <HI>John Middleton</HI> of <HI>Cad∣ham,</HI> by <HI>Helen</HI> his Wife, Daughter of <HI>John Strachan,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Thornton,</HI> who being bred a Scholar, intended to have made his Fortune that Way, but the Civil War break∣ing out, he laid aside that Resolution, and betaking himself to the Profession of Arms, engaged in the Service of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament, where the Eminency of his Courage made him so much taken Notice of, when he was not above the Degree of a Captain of a Troop of Horse, that by the Time Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> was sent with an Army into the West of <HI>England,</HI> di∣stinct from the other commanded by the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> Captain <HI>Middleton</HI> was made his Lieutenant General<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History of the Rebellion.</NOTE>; and he continued in that Service with singular Reputation, till the Parlia∣ment cashier'd the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and made their new Model; he quit all Command there, and betook himself to the Service of the Estates of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> where he gave frequent Testi∣monies of signal Courage and Valour, in several Actions, insomuch as when the Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> 1647, rais'd an Army for the Rescue of the King, upon his being made Prisoner in the Isle of

<P>Lieutenant General <HI>Middleton</HI> con∣tinued to attend on the King till the 1653, his Majesty being importun'd by many Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esses, as well from the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords who were Prisoners in <HI>England,</HI> as from those who were at Liberty, that Lieutenant General <HI>Middleton</HI> might be sent over to the <HI>Highlands</HI> with his Majesty's Com∣mission, and with some Supply of Arms; and that by the next Spring they would have an Army ready, strong enough to meet with General <HI>Monk;</HI> and tho' the King did not (says the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>) expect that any notable Service would be performed by his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for his Ad∣vantage, or their own Redemption; yet did not think fit to seem to under∣value the Professions and Overtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of those who had, during his being among them, made all Professions of Duty to him, and therefore gave such a Com∣mission and Instructions to the Lieu∣tenant General as were necessary, and dispatched him to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he arrived with some few Officers, and such a Supply of Arms and Ammuni∣tion as could be got upon his own Credit and Activity, in the Winter of the Year 1653, when the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> delivered up the Command of the Troops to him, and he continu∣ed at the Head of them for a whole Year thereafter, but never getting

any Supplies from Abroad, he was at length totally routed and suppress'd by General <HI>Monk,</HI> after which he found Shelter in some honest Mens Houses, where he was conceal'd, till Opportu∣nity serv'd to transport him beyond Sea; that he came to the King at <HI>Cologn,</HI> 1655, and attended his Majesty's For∣tune throughout the rest of the Exile.</P>
<P>Upon the Restoration, his Majesty, in Commemoration of the long and faithful Services of General <HI>Middleton.</HI> was pleased to raise him to the Degree of an Earl, by the Title of Earl of <HI>Mid∣dleton,</HI> by Letters Patent, bearing Date 1st of <HI>October</HI> 1660<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Rotulis Caroli II.</NOTE>, made him Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Forces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Governor of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI> Castle, one of the Lords of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy-Council; and appointed him Lord High Commissioner to the 1st and 2d Sessions of the Parliament 1661 and 1662. But being impatient to be the sole Favourite, in his last Session of Parliament, he procured an Act to pass, by which certain Persons were to be incapacitated from all Offices of Ho∣nour or Trust, and that by a very new and unheard of Way of Billoting: By which Act the Secretary of State the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> the Treasurer, the Earl of <HI>Crawfurd,</HI> the Justice-Clerk, Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> and Others, who had given very signal Testimony of their Affection and Fidelity to the King, were particularly levell'd at: But his Majesty finding the Earl had very far exceeded the Limits of his Commission, in the framing and pas∣sing of that Act; and that it was highly derogatory to his Majesty's Ju∣stice and innate Goodness he had such a deep Resentment of the Indignity, that he gave Orders to reseind the Act of Billoting, and it fell heavy on the Earl himself, for he was immediately removed from all the Offices he held under the Crown, the Castle of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI> was given to the Earl of <HI>Lauder∣dale,</HI> and the Command of the Forces to the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> who had contri∣buted very much to his Overthrow. But his Majesty calling to Mind the great Merit and Services of the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> during the Exile, thought it improper he should be dismiss'd with any further Marks of the Royal Dis∣pleasure; and therefore, that he might be out of the Way, and never more in a Condition to compete with, or con∣troul the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who had the Ascendant of the other in the King's Affections, he was made Go∣vernor of the new <HI>English</HI> Fort of <HI>Tangier</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> which was little other than a more decent Exile; there he liv'd till the 1673. Death overtook him in that remote Corner of the World, where his Body was commit∣ted to its Rest. He married first <HI>Grisel</HI> Daughter of <HI>Durham</HI> of <HI>Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Sister to Sir <HI>Alexander Durham</HI> of <HI>Large,</HI> and again <HI>Martha,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Monmouth</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baronage of England.</NOTE>.

<P>Which <HI>Charles</HI> was bred up at the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. But whe∣ther he had any Preferment there be∣fore the 1682, I cannot take upon me to determine.

<P><HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Montrose,</HI> being a Per∣son of great Parts and Abilities, was after the Accession of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. to the Crown, named President of His Majesty's most honourable Privy Council, and he enjoy'd the Office even till his Death, <HI>November</HI> 24th 1626.

<P><HI>James</HI> Earl, afternam'd Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> was born in the 1612, hav∣ing had the Misfortune to lose his Fa∣ther when he was young, and being I think the only Son of the Family, his Friends, in order to raise up Heirs to his illustrious House, pre∣vail'd with him, when he was but a Youth, to marry, which he did into a very noble Family: This Marriage broke off the Course, and gave a great Interruption to his Studies, but quick∣ly finding the Loss he should sustain if he did not go thro' with his Edu∣cation, he got good Masters at Home, and enter'd into a close Course of Study, wherein he made so great a Proficiency and Progress, that in a very little Time he became not only a great Master, but a Critick in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> after which, for his greater Improvement, and giving an Ornament to his hopeful Person, he travel'd into Foreign Parts, where he spent some Years in attaining the Language, and in learning the Exer∣cises then in Vogue, in which he ex∣cel'd most Men, and came over to <HI>England,</HI> by the Time he was Twen∣ty two Years of Age.</P>
<P>He then betook himself to the Court, intending to live there in a View of ser∣ving the Crown, and of raising himself to those Honours and Imployments
<PB N="340" REF="350"/>
both his Birth and personal Qualifica∣tions did intitle him to; but in his Attendance there, meeting with some Discountenance of the King, which was very artfully brought about, he left the Court, and returning to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> just before the breaking out of the Troubles, he joined with the dis∣contented Party, who appeared most forward for the Redress of Grievan∣ces of the Church, which was all that was at that Time pretended, insomuch as he soon became one of the prin∣cipal and most active Lords for the Covenant and Reformation: But af∣ter the first Expedition of the Cove∣nanters into <HI>England,</HI> the Earl upon his Observation of the unwarrantable Prosecution of the Ends of the Cove∣nant, he gave over that Party, and his Command in the Army; and made a full Tender of his Service to his Majesty, which brought him so much into the Jealousy of the Party he had formerly been of, that there was no Room left to doubt of his Sincerity to the King. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> does very unjustly insinuate in his History of the Civil War, that while the King was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Montrose</HI> offer'd to make away Two Great Men, he thinks, were not so cordial in the King's Interest as could have been wish'd; but as this Ca∣lumny is most false, as I am ful∣ly able from Original Writs and Pa∣pers to justify him from that Asper∣sion, so I shall offer no more here for his Vindication, but to declare to the World, and which I'm able to de∣monstrate, that the Marquis of <HI>Mon∣trose</HI> was a Prisoner in the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for corresponding with the King from the Month of <HI>June</HI> 1641 till <HI>January</HI> thereafter, and the King came down in <HI>August</HI> and re∣turned in <HI>November;</HI> so 'tis clear he was a Prisoner all the while his Maje∣sty was in <HI>Scotland</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Original Instructions of all this I have had the Honour to peruse in the Duke of Montrose's Custody.</NOTE>. After his Releas∣ment he liv'd most part privately at his Seat in the Country, till the Meeting of the Convention 1643, he private∣ly withdrew out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and came to the King a few Days before the Siege was rais'd from <HI>Glocester,</HI> and gave his Majesty the first clear Information of the Proceedings of the Convention, of the Resolutions would be there taken, and of the Posture the Kingdom would speedily be in; and made some Propositions to the King for the Remedy; which there was not, says the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> then Time to consult of: But assoon as his Majesty return'd to <HI>Oxford,</HI> after the Battle of <HI>Newburry,</HI> he was very willing to hearken to any Overture the Earl should make in Re∣ference to what could be done, to prevent the Mischief was like to en∣sue to his Majesty's Affairs, by a Com∣bination betwixt the <HI>Scots</HI> Covenan∣ters and the <HI>English</HI> Parliament; wherefore, that his Majesty might have this important Affair brought to a full Resolution, he was pleas'd to hold several Conferences with the Earl: But all the Advances which were made toward the Execution of any Attempt for the King's Service, were check'd by his Majesty's not be∣ing able to give any Troops to the Earl, by the Protection whereof, the Loyal Party of the Kingdom might come to his Assistance, and discover their Affections to his Majesty, not∣withstanding of which, the vigorous Spirit of the Earl of <HI>Montrose,</HI> stirred him up to make some Attempt, which he thought might be of Service to the King: And therefore proposed that his Majesty should give a Command to the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> to raise, and send over a Body of Two Thousand Men, into the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be a Foundation for raising For∣ces there, and that if his Majesty would grant him a Commission to command that Army, he would him∣self be in the <HI>Highlands</HI> to receive them, and run his Fortune with them; and that if no Time were lost in pro∣secuting that Design, he did hope
<PB N="341" REF="351"/>
that by the Time the <HI>Scots</HI> Army should be ready to take the Field, they should receive such an Alarm from their own Country, as should hinder their Advance into <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History of the Rebellion.</NOTE>. Upon this Overture the King conser'd with the Two Lords, and finding the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> forward to undertake the raising as many Men as should be desir'd, his Majesty re∣solv'd to encourage it all he could; and therefore, that the Earl of <HI>Mon∣trose</HI> might depart with the better Character, and Testimony of his Ma¦jesty▪s Favour and good Opinion, and be thereby the better qualified to per form the great Trust reposed in him, his Majesty was pleased to give Order for a Warrant to make the Earl Mar∣quis of <HI>Montrose</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Ducem de Montrose, data 6 May, 1644.</NOTE>, and gave him a Commission, constituting his Lord∣ship Captain-General, and Comman∣der in Chief of all the Forces to be rais'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> for his Majesty's Service; and so taking his Leave of the King, accompany'd with several Gentlemen, he began his Journey, as if he meant to make his Way in Com∣pany with them into <HI>Scotland;</HI> but af∣ter he had continued his Journey two or three Days in that Equipage, which he knew could be no Secret, and that it would draw the Enemies Troops together, for the Guard of all Passes to meet with him, the Mar∣quis was found missing one Morning by his Company, who after some Stay and Enquiry returned back to <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> whilst this noble Person with in∣credible Address and Fatigue, had not only quitted his Company and his Servants, but his Horse also, and found a safe Passage, most Part on Foot, thro' all the Enemies Quarters, till he came to the very Borders<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE>; from whence, by the Assistance of Friends whom he trusted, he found himself secure in the Border of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> with his most faithful Friend the Laird of <HI>Inchbrackie</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guthry's Memoirs.</NOTE>; where he lay quiet without under∣taking any Action, until the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> did make good so much of his Undertaking, that he sent over Co∣lonel <HI>Alexander M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Donald,</HI> with a Regiment of Fifteen Hundred Sol∣diers, who landed in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> at or near the Place that had been agreed on<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bishop Wishart's Memoirs of the Mar∣quis of Montrose.</NOTE>, where the Marquis was ready to receive him, which he did with great Joy, and quickly publi∣shed his Commission of being Gene∣ral for the King over all the King∣dom.</P>
<P>With this Handful of Men thus brought together, with those Circum∣stances, he brought in so many of his Countrymen to join with him, as were soon strong enough to arm them∣selves at the Charge of their Enemies, whom they first defeated, and every Day encreased in Power, till he fought, and prevailed in the several Battles of <HI>Tippermuir, Alfuird, Aldearn, Aberdeen, Inverlochy,</HI> and <HI>Kilsyth,</HI> that he made himself in little more than one Year, upon the Matter, Master of the Kingdom; and did all those stupen∣duous Acts which are deservedly the Subject of a History excellently writ∣ten in <HI>Latin</HI> by Dr. <HI>George Wishart,</HI> thereafter Bishop of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> tho' very ill translated since by an un∣known Hand.</P>

was not only prevented, but he was compel'd with great Loss to retire a∣gain to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> for recruiting of his Army, in which he had won∣derfully succeeded, when he received his Majesty's positive Orders, while he was in the Hands of the <HI>Scots</HI> Ar∣my before <HI>Newark,</HI> to lay down his Arms by a certain Day prefixed, and to leave the Kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lord C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rendon's History.</NOTE>, till when they pretended they could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declare for his Majesty; and this was done with so much Earnestness, and by a particular Messenger known and trusted, that the Marquis obey'd and transported himself into <HI>France,</HI> to∣ward the End of the Year 1646<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bishop Wishart's Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose. Clarendon.</NOTE>, where he did for some Time reside, and took the Opportunity while he attended at that Court, to make some Overtures to Cardinal <HI>Mazerine,</HI> to raise any Army for the Service of the King, which the crafty Cardinal did not receive, says the Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> with that Regard the Marquis's great Name deserv'd. Thereupon his Ex∣cellency left <HI>France,</HI> and made a Jour∣ney into <HI>Germany,</HI> to the Emperor's Court; and thence to <HI>Brussels,</HI> where he lay privately, and as <HI>incognito</HI> for some Time, till he hear'd of the Murther of the King, that he came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and presented himself to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. with the Tender of his Service<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">(c)</NOTE>; and his Majesty received him with a very good Coun∣tenance, and as a most gracious Testi∣mony of his great Fidelity and Merit, presented him with the Ensigns of the most noble Order of the Garter.</P>
<P>While the King remained at the <HI>Hague,</HI> there were at this Time, be∣side the Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> and those of the Nobility who adhered to him, the Commissioners who came from the Council and the Kirk, to invite his Majesty into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and others of the Nobility who joined with him; and tho' there was nothing the King wished more than that some Expedi∣ent might be found out to unite all those Parties; especially that there might be an Union and Reconciliation betwixt <HI>Mentrose</HI> and the <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iltonion</HI> Faction, who had an equal Desire to serve the King, and were as much persecuted by the Party who then govern'd, as the Marquis was; yet the Animosity of each of them was such against him, that they were equally his implacable Enemies, in∣somuch as they did not only refuse to meet with him, but assoon as he came into the Room where they were, tho' his Majesty himself was present, they immediately withdrew and left the Room<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, and desir'd that the Marquis, whom they call'd <HI>James Graham,</HI> might be forbidden to come into his Majesty's Presence, because he stood excommunicated by the Kirk, and degraded and forfaulted by the Judicatory of the Kingdom: With which Demand his Majesty declared his being very much offended, which he made manifest by using the Mar∣quis with the more Countenance, and in holding the more frequent Confe∣rences with him.</P>
<P>But when the Marquis clearly per∣ceived that it was not possible that the Lords of the other Parties would ever unite with him, and that his Attendance on the King might possib∣ly bring some Prejudice to his Service, he therefore propos'd, that his Ma∣jesty would give him Letters and Credentials to several Princes in <HI>Ger∣many;</HI> and to the Northern Crowns, by which he might appear Ambassa∣dor Extraordinary from the King, if he should find it expedient, to the End he might, by the Help of these Princes, obtain the Loan of Monies, Arms and Ammunition, to enable him
<PB N="343" REF="353"/>
to prosecute his intended Descent in∣to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the King, says my Author the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> glad that he did not press for ready Money, which he was not able to supply him with, gave him such Letters as he de∣sir'd, and a Commission to gather such a Force together, as by the Help of those Princes he might be enabled to do: Upon which the Marquis went for <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> which he appointed for the Rendezvous for all those Troops, which he expected from <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and from whence he could in the mean Time visit such Courts of the Neighbour Princes, as he should be encouraged to do, and keep such Intelligence with his Friends in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> as should provide for his Re∣ception. In a Word, he sent or went in Person, both to <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> where he found the Perfor∣mance very disproportionable to the Hopes and Encouragement he had received from thence; so that the Marquis was obliged to return to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> with very small Supplies, from either or both these Kingdoms; and there he received no better Ac∣count from those Officers whom he had sent to <HI>Germany;</HI> and therefore concluding upon the Whole, that all his Hopes from <HI>Germany</HI> and those Northern Princes would not increase the Strength he had already, which did not amount to above Five Hun∣dred, he caus'd those Soldiers he had drawn together, to be imbark'd for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and sent Officers with them, who knew the Country, with Di∣rections that they should land in such a Place, and remain there till he came to them, or sent them Orders; and then in another Vessel comman∣ded by a Captain very faithful to the King, he embarked himself, and near an Hundred Officers, and landed in another Creek, not far from the other Place whither his Soldiers were di∣rected; and both the one and the other Party were set safely on Shore, in the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> on the 15th of <HI>April</HI> 1650<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose.</NOTE>; from thence he came over to <HI>Caithness</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">History of the Revolutions in England, by a French Clergyman, where Montrose's Expedition is particularly narrated.</NOTE>, and presently repair'd to the House of a Gentleman of Quality, with whom he correspon∣ded; by whom he was well received, and thought himself to be in Security, till he might put his Affairs in some Method: After he had staid there a short Time, he quickly possess'd him∣self of an old Castle, which, in Re∣spect of the Situation, in a Country so impossible for an Army to march in, thought strong enough for his Purpose. Thither he convoy'd the Arms, Ammunition and Troops, which he had brought with him; and then he published his Declaration, <HI>That he came with the King's Commis∣sion, to assist those his good Subjects, and to preserve them from Oppression: That he did not intend to give any Interrup∣tion to the Treaty that he hear'd was enter'd into with his Majesty; but, on the contrary, hoped, that his being in the Head of an Army, how small soever, that was faithful to the King, might advance the same. However, he had given sufficient Proof in his former Acti∣ons, that if any Agreement were made with the King, upon the first Order from his Majesty, he should lay down his Arms, and dispose himself according to his Majesty's good Pleasure.</HI> With these Declarations which he sent to his Friends, to be scatter'd by them, and dispersed among the People, as they could be able, he writ likewise to those of the Nobility, and the prin∣cipal Heads of the <HI>Highland</HI> Clans, to draw such Forces together as they thought necessary, to join with him; and he received Answers from many of them, by which they desir'd him to advance more into the Low-Lands,
<PB N="344" REF="354"/>
and assured him, that they would re∣sort to him, with good Numbers of their Friends and Followers, which many of them did prepare to do, with great Sincerity.</P>
<P>The Alarm of <HI>Montrose</HI>'s Landing startled the Parliament, which was then sitting at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in so much, that it gave them no Leisure to think of any Thing else, than of sending Forces to hinder the Recourse of others to join with him; and there∣fore, sent Colonel <HI>Strachan</HI> with a choice Party of the best Horse they had, to make all possible Haste to∣ward him, and to prevent the Insur∣rections which they feared would be in several Parts of the <HI>Highlands;</HI> and within few Days after, Lieutenant General <HI>Lesly</HI> followed with a strong∣er Party of Horse and Foot. The Encouragement the Marquis received from his Friends, and the Unplea∣santness of the Quarters, in which he was, prevail'd with him to march with these few Troops more into the Land; and the <HI>Highlanders</HI> flocking to him from all Quarters, made him undervalue any Enemy who he thought was yet like to encounter him; and the Marquis being without any Body of Horse to discover the Mo¦tion of an Enemy, but depending upon all necessary Intelligence from the Affections of the People; <HI>Strachan</HI> made such Haste toward him, that he was within a small Distance of him, before he heard of his Approach, and those <HI>Highlanders</HI> who had seem'd to come with much Zeal to him, whether terrified or corrupted, left him on a sudden, or threw down their Arms; so that he had none left but a Company of good Officers, and Five or Six Hundred Foreigners, <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Germans;</HI> with these he betook him∣self to a Place of some Advantage, by the Inequality of the Ground; and there they made a Defence for some Time with notable Courage; but the Enemy being so much superior in Number, the common Soldiers being all Foreigners, after about a Hundred of them were kill'd upon the Place, threw down their Arms; And the Marquis seeing all lost, threw away his Ribband and <HI>George,</HI> and found Means to change his Clothes with a Fellow of the Country; and so after having gone on Foot Two or Three Miles, he got into a House of a Gentleman, <HI>M'Leod</HI> of <HI>Assint,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mercurius Politicus ad Annum 1661.</NOTE>, where he remain'd conceal'd about Two Days; but whether by the Own∣er of the House, or any other Way, the Marquis was discovered, and be∣came their Prisoner, and was the next Day or soon thereafter delivered to the General, who was come up with his Forces, and had now nothing left to do, but to carry him in Triumph to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>When he came to one of the Gates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he was met by some of the Magistrates, to whom he was de∣livered, and by them presently put in∣to a new Cart purposely made, in which there was a high Chair, or Bench, upon which he sat, that the People might have a full View of him, being bound with a Cord drawn over his Breast and Shoulders, and fasten'd thro' Holes made in the Cart. When he was in this Posture, the Hangman took off his Hat, and rode himself before the Cart in his Livery, and with his Bonnet on; the other Officers, who were taken Prisoners with him, walking Two and Two before the Cart; in this Manner he was carried to the common Goal, and received and treated as a common Malefactor.</P>
<P>Within Two Days after, he was brought before the Parliament, where the Chancellor made a very bitter
<PB N="345" REF="355"/>
and virulent Speech against him, told him, <HI>He had broken all the Covenants by which the Nation stood obliged, and had impiously rebelled against GOD, the King and the Kingdom; that he had committed many horrible Murthers, Trea∣sons and Impieties, for all which he was now brought to suffer condign Punish∣ment;</HI> with all those Reproaches, says my Author, against his Person and his Actions, which the Liberty of that Place gave him Leave to use.</P>
<P>Permission was then given him to speak, and without the least Trouble in his Countenance, or Disorder, upon all the Indignities he had suffer'd, he told them, <HI>Since the King had own'd them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o far as to treat with them, he had appear'd before them with Reverence, and bare headed, which otherwise he would not willingly have done: That he had done nothing of which he was asham'd, or had Cause to repent; that the first Covenant, he had taken, and comply'd with it, and with them who took it, as long as the Ends for which it was or∣dain'd were observ'd; but when he dis∣cover'd, which was now evident to all the World, that private and particular Men design'd to satisfy their own Ambi∣tion and Interest, instead of considering the Publick Benefit; and that, under the Pretence of reforming some Errors in Religion, they resolv'd to abridge, and take away the King's just Power, and lawful Authority, he had withdrawn himself from that Engagement: That for the League and Covenant, he had never taken it, and therefore could not break it: And it was now too apparent to the whole Christian World, what mon∣struous Mischiefs it had produced: That when, under Colour of it, an Army from</HI> Scotland <HI>had invaded</HI> England <HI>in Assistance of the Rebellion that was then against their Lawful King, he had, by his Majesty's Command, received a Com∣mission from him to raise Forces in</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>that he might thereby divert them from the other odious Persecution: That he had executed that Commission with the Obedience and Duty he ow'd to the King; and in all the Circumstances of it, had proceeded like a Gentleman; and had never suffer'd any Blood to be shed but in the Heat of the Battle; and that he saw many Persons there, whose Lives he had saved: that when the King com∣manded him, he laid down his Arms, and withdrew out of the Kingdom; which they could not have compell'd him to have done.</HI> He said, <HI>he was now again enter'd into the Kingdom by his Majesty's Command, and with his Au∣thority: And what Success soever it might have pleased GOD to have given him, he would always have obeyed any Com∣mands he should have received from him.</HI> He advised them, <HI>to consider well of the Consequence before they proceeded against him, and that all his Actions might be examin'd, and judged by the Laws of the Land, or those of Nations.</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as he had ended his Dis∣course, he was ordered to withdraw; and, after a short Space, was again brought in; and told by the Chan∣cellor, <HI>That he was, on the Morrow, be∣ing the one and Twentieth of</HI> May 1650, <HI>to be carried to</HI> Edinburgh <HI>Cross, and there to be hanged up on a Gallows Thirty Foot high, for the Space of Three Hours, and then to be taken down, and his Head to be cut off upon a Scoffold, and hanged on</HI> Edinburgh <HI>Tolboth; his Legs and Arms to be hanged up in other publick Towns of the Kingdom, and his Body to be buried at the Place where he was to be executed, except the Kirk should take off his Excommunication; and then his Body might be buried in the common Place of Burial.</HI> And 'tis admirable to consider with what Magnanimity &amp; Firmness of Soul he heard the Judgment that condemned him to be quartered, con∣cerning which he said to the Chancellor that pronounced it, <HI>That he was prouder to have his Head set upon the Place it was appointed to be, than he could have been to have had his Picture hang in the King's Bed-Chamber: That he was so far from being troubled, that his Four</HI>
<PB N="346" REF="356"/>
<HI>Limbs were to be hang'd in Four princi∣pal Cities of the Kingdom, that he hear∣tily wished he had Flesh enough to be sent to every City in</HI> Christendom, <HI>as a Testimony of the Cause for which he suffer'd.</HI></P>
<P>He desir'd after the Sentence to have said somewhat to the Parlia∣ment, but was not suffer'd, and so was carried back to Prison; and the next Day every Part and Circum∣stance of the Sentence was executed upon him with all the Inhumanity imaginable; and he bore it with all the Courage and Magnanimity, and the greatest Piety that a good Chri∣stian could manifest. When he had ended all he had to say, and was ex∣pecting to expire, they acted yet one Scene more of their Barbarity upon him; the Hangman brought the Book that had been published, of his truly Heroick Actions whilst he comman∣ded in the Kingdom, which, together with his Declaration, was tied in a small Cord, that was put about his Neck.

<P>The noble Marquis married <HI>Mag∣dalen,</HI> Daughter of <HI>David,</HI> first Earl of <HI>Southesk,</HI> by whom he had <HI>James</HI> his Son and Heir.</P>
<P>This noble Lord was too young to have had a Part in the War under his Father: After whose Death being divested of his Estate, he liv'd quietly and privately under the Powers that then prevail'd, retaining his Affection and Fidelity to the Crown, which he made manifest in performing all the Offices of Fidelity and Duty to the King, throughout the whole Course of the Usurpation, that a generous and worthy Person could find any Opportunity for; with which his Ma∣jesty was abundanty satisfied and pleas'd.</P>
<P>Upon the Return of the King, the Marquis was restor'd to his Estate, and the Act of his Father's Forfaul∣ture repell'd, and he was nam'd one of the Lords of his Majesty's Privy-Council: But that which was thought strange, and administred much Dis∣course, both then and afterwards, was, that his Lordship was not pre∣ferr'd to any of the great Offices of the Crown, considering the transcen∣dent Merit of his Father, and the great Value and Esteem the King had of himself, as a Nobleman of great Ho∣nour and Integrity; but the Reason I have ever hear'd assign'd for it, was, that the Marquis did not affect any publick Character, a Life of Privacy and Quiet being really his own Choice, and what was more suited to his Hu∣mour and Nature; and dying in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> in the 1669<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Cancellaria, S.

<P><HI>James</HI> Marquis of <HI>Montrose</HI> his Son was a Nobleman of great Parts, which were improved by a good Education. Upon the Death of his Father the King took him into his immediate and emi∣nent Care, made him first, Captain of the Guard; and then, that he might fit him by Degrees for the greatest Trust and Employments, preferr'd him to be President of the Privy-Council; but Death overtook him not long thereafter, in the Prime of his Years, upon the 25th of <HI>April</HI> 1684<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Cancellatia, S.

<P>This noble Lord being a Person of very bright and distinguishing Parts, and the Head of a very noble Family, that had in no Time swerv'd in its Fi∣delity to the Crown, her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> soon after he came to Age, called him to her Privy-Council, made him first, Lord High Admiral of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Beginning of the 1705<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem, data 28 Febru∣ary 1706.</NOTE>, and then Lord President of the Council in little more as a Year thereafter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>; in which Station, and in all other Capacities, his Lordship did exert himself with the most ar∣dent Zeal and Vigour, in promoting the Succession to the Crown in the Protestant Line, and on that Account did all he could to consolidate the Two Kingdoms in an incorporating Union, and thereby giving a Sanction to the Title of the most serene House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to the Crown of this Re∣alm; in Consideration whereof, as well as in Respect of his Lordship's personal Merit, and in Honour of his noble Family, for which the Queen did always prosess a very great Value and Regard, her Majesty was pleas'd by Letters Patent 24th of <HI>April</HI> 1707, to make the Marquis Duke of <HI>Montrose</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>; and 'tis to be observed as a special Instance of her Majesty's more immediate Favou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the Honour was not restricted to the Heirs Male of the Duke's own Body; but was to descend to his Heirs of Entail.</P>
<P>His Grace continued Lord President of the Council, till the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> thought fit to dissolve the <HI>Scots</HI> Privy-Council some Time after the commencing of the Union, that the Duke of <HI>Montrose</HI> was made Lord Privy-Seal, upon the Removal of the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> the 28th <HI>February</HI> 1709; and he held that Office, till the 1713<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, he was laid aside for not complying with the Measures of the Court during the

<P>The Duke's firm and inviolable Adherence to the Protestant Succes∣sion, which his Grace had so early, and with so much Zeal maintain'd and asserted, could not fail to intitle him to a more than ordinary Favour of the illustrious Family, in whom the Right was established by Law; and therefore, when the Successor, his Electoral Highness the Duke of <HI>Bruns∣wick</HI> was by Act of Parliament im∣power'd to nominate so many Persons as he should think proper, to be joined with the Seven great Officers of State, in the Administration of the Govern∣ment till his Arrival<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">An Historical Account of the Affairs of Great Britain, with the most remarkable Occurrences from the Accession of King George to the Throne, 1714.</NOTE>, his Royal Highness did repose such Confidence in the Duke's Affection and Fidelity to his Interest, that he had the Honour to be named one of the Lords of the Regency: But being at his Seat in the Country when the Act of Settle∣ment of the Crown did actually take Effect, by the Demise of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> of glorious Memory, on the 31st of <HI>July</HI> 1714, his Grace made Haste to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he was present at the Proclamation of King <HI>George;</HI> and taking Post for <HI>London,</HI> he arrived there on the 10th of <HI>August</HI> thereafter, where he concur'd cordially and chear∣fully with the other Lords Justices, in taking Care to issue out such Orders as were necessary to support the Ho∣nour and Dignity of the Crown, and to secure the Peace and Tranquillity of the Kingdom.

<P>In the 1558. the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> was one of the Peers who entered into a Bond of Association to promote the Reformation of Religion, and the Year thereafter was sent Ambassador to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to treat with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a∣bout the maintaining a firm and lasting Peace betwixt the Two Crowns, when he established himself so much in the Favour of that Princess, that her Friendship was never in any Degree diminished toward him till his dying Day.</P>
<P>After Queen <HI>Mary</HI> returned home from <HI>France</HI> in 1561, her Majesty made Choice of the Earl as one of her Privy-Council, and in less than a Year thereafter, he was sent Ambassa∣dor to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> in which Negotiation he behaved himself with great Prudence and Dexterity, inso∣much as upon his Return he was pre∣fer'd to be Lord High-Chancellor; and he continued in the Office till the 20th of <HI>March</HI> 1565, he was deprived, and forced to flee to <HI>England,</HI> for alled∣ged Accession to the Murder of <HI>David Rizio,</HI> the Queen's <HI>French</HI> Secretary:
<PB N="352" REF="362"/>
But in a short Time thereafter, by the Mediation and Interposition of the Earl of <HI>Bothwell,</HI> he obtained his Par∣don, which he paid dear for after∣ward; for that Earl thought by this Favour, to bring the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> over to his Interest; but he soon found himself mistaken. For tho' he had all Duty and Gratitude to him as a Friend, yet the wicked Earl <HI>Bothwel</HI> did no sooner propose to him the Design, and craved his Assistance, toward the Murder of the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> the Queen's Husband, as a Piece of Ser∣vice which would be very acceptable to her Majesty; but he conjured him to lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>side the Thoughts of so base and unworthy an Enterprize; and which would be attended with so much Infamy and Danger: And when he could not prevail in that Point, in Testimony he did abhor so detestable a Design, he left the Court, and re∣tired to the Country, when that bloody and barbarous Tragedy was to be acted. And I think the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI>'s Circumstances at this Time, cannot but be pitied; for if he had re∣vealed the Earl of <HI>Bothwel</HI>'s Design of taking away the King's Life, it had cost him his own; and his conceal∣ing it then, brought him to die upon a Scaffold many Years there∣after.</P>
<P>After the Murder of King <HI>Henry,</HI> when the Nation, both Protestants and Papists, began to be alarmed with the Queen's Marriage with the Earl of <HI>Bothwell,</HI> who was shrewdly sus∣pected as the Murderer of her former Husband, and the Danger the young Prince was in by such an Union; the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> was one of the most forward among the Nobility, who enter'd into an Association for the Preservation of the Prince; and when the Queen resigned the Government to the End her Son might be invested in the Sovereignty the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> took the Coronation Oath for the Infant King, at his Inauguration, on the 29th of <HI>July</HI> 1567.</P>
<P>In this new Turn of Affairs the Earl of <HI>Morton's</HI> Share was so considera∣ble, that assoon as the Earl of <HI>Mur∣ray</HI> had accepted the Regency, the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> was declared Chancel∣lor, upon the Removal of the Earl of <HI>Huntly,</HI> who adhered to the Queen, and made heritable Lord High Admiral of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Sheriff-Principal of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>-Shire<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Morton, ad Annum 1570.</NOTE>.

<P>I shall not here enter upon the De∣tail of the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI>'s Admini∣stration during his Regency, that would not consist with the Brevity of this Work; and generally his Proceed∣ings are complain'd of on one Side, or commended on the other, as Opinions and Party lead Men to, I shall only take Notice, that the first Motion he made to resign the Government in the 1578, was accepted in a general Convention of the Nobility, where∣in it was agreed to, that the young King should take upon him the Ad∣ministration, when he was not full Thirteen Years of Age; and yet the new Court kept fair with the Earl, for they procur'd a Parliament to be call'd, wherein the late Regent ob∣tain'd a Remission and Exoneration during his Regency, in the most ample Manner he himself could devise; and after that he play'd his Game so well, that he was in a short Time a∣gain made President of the Council, <HI>and was in great Credit with his Majesty</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Melvil's Memoirs.</NOTE>; but that being what was not at all acceptable to the other Party, who had the young King in their Hands, and who were willing to be

<P>Upon the Death and Forfaulture of the Regent, the Title of, Earl of <HI>Mor∣ton</HI> was bestowed upon the Lord <HI>Max∣well;</HI> but his Majesty having recalled and revoked that Deed, and being further willing and desirous, that all Animosities and Grounds of Con∣tention among the Nobility might be removed, for that End a Parliament was call'd in the 1585, wherein his Ma∣jesty pass'd an Act of Oblivion, where∣by every Body who had been forfaulted during the Troubles in the King's Minority were indemnified, except such as had been accessory to his Fa∣ther's Murder: And tho' the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> had been convicted of that Crime, and suffer'd for it, yet his Majesty considering, <HI>Bona, fidelia, gratuita Servitia Nobis facta per quon∣dam Comitem de</HI> Morton, <HI>in Guberna∣tione &amp; Administratione Nostri Regni; nec non alia debita &amp; egregia Officia Nobis in Nostra Minoritate per ipsum praestita &amp; impensa; considerantes etiam quod dictus quondam Comes de</HI> Morton, <HI>nullatenus conscius fuit Artis &amp; Partis dicti Criminis, neque ejusdem Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noris &amp; Caedis Perpetrationi ullatenus consensit, sed tantummodo predict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Caedem prae∣cognovit, &amp; celavit; quam ob causam praefatus Comes de</HI> Morton <HI>in Corpore satis superque luit juxta dictam Senten∣tiam Forisfacturae contra eum latam &amp; promulgatam, unde Legibus &amp; Nostro Honori abunde ex hac Parte satisfactum fuit</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Morton, data 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> January, 1585.</NOTE>. <HI>Nos igitur,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>FROM the Time of King <HI>James</HI> III, the Earldom of <HI>Murray</HI> con∣tinued in the Crown, and there re∣mained till the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> V. that that Prince by Letters Patent, bearing Date on the 20th of <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne</HI> 1501<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Rotulis Jacobi IV.</NOTE>, gave it to <HI>James Stewart</HI> his Natural Son, whom he had by <HI>Jean Kennedy,</HI> the Lord <HI>Kennedy</HI>'s Daugh∣ter, his Paramont.</P>
<P>He married <HI>Isobel,</HI> Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and dying 12th of <HI>June</HI> 1544, left only one Daughter <HI>Mary</HI> married to <HI>John</HI> Master of <HI>Buchan,</HI> so the Earldom of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rray</HI> went back again to the Crown; and being in the Sovereign's Disposal, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> on the 18th of <HI>February</HI> 1548<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. in Rotuiis Mariae R.</NOTE>, gave it to <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntly:</HI> But her Majesty recalling that Deed, she was afterward graciously pleased to bestow the Earldom of <HI>Murray</HI> upon <HI>James</HI> Prior of <HI>St. Andrews.</HI></P>
<P>He was the natural Son of King <HI>James</HI> V. by <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Erskine,</HI> who being by the Care of his Father as of all the rest of his illegitimate Sons were, bred to the Church; he was when very young provided to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews, Anno</HI> 1539, then void by the Promo∣tion of <HI>Patrick Hepburn,</HI> to the Epis∣copal See of <HI>Murray;</HI> but by Reason of his Non-age, Dr. <HI>Alexander Miln,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Cambuskenneth,</HI> and Presi∣dent of the College of Justice, was ap∣pointed Administrator of the Benefice,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub. Arch.</NOTE>, both with Respect to the Spiritu∣al and Temporal Discharge of the Function.</P>
<P>By Reason of the Prior's Youth, I have met with nothing memorable of him, till the Beginning of the Refor∣mation, he was among the first who embraced the Protestant Reform'd Religion, tho'he was far from giving any Countenance to the Popular Re∣formation, as is manifest from the many and frequent Addresses he and others of the Protestant Nobility, made to the Queen Regent, that she would please to concur by her Autho∣rity in reforming of the Church.</P>
<P>But the Queen peremptorily refu∣sing not only to comply with their Supplications, but having also violated some Articles of Pacification, she had very solemnly enter'd into with the Protestant Lords, of which the Prior of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> himself stood Guaran∣tee; he thereupon left her, and join'd himself with <HI>the Lords of the Congre∣gation,</HI> as they were call'd, whereupon the Prior, the Lord <HI>James,</HI> was sum∣mon'd before the Council, but he did not think fit to answer the Charge o∣therwise, than to return this Answer to the Messenger, <HI>That her Majesty had broken the Conditions with the Lords of the Congregation, which by Warrant from herself, he had made and entred into with them, he would have no more Med∣dling in such dishonest Courses, and would do the best to repair Things he</HI>
<PB N="357" REF="367"/>
<HI>could.</HI> This Answer gave Occasion to the Queen to signifie to the Prior, <HI>That she suspected that Religion was the least Thing he or his Party had in their Thoughts, and that she did not doubt, but that under the Covert and Pretext of Religion, he intended to make an At¦tempt upon the Crown.</HI> The Prior in the mean Time disowns the Charge, and thought himself obliged for his further Vindication, to make a very solemn Protestation, that he had no other View or Design in what he had done, than the Advancement of the true Reformed Religion, and the Pre∣servation of the Liberties of his Coun¦try, which he could not but bewail he saw so signally invaded by her, at least by those who pretended to act by, and derive their Authority from her; after which he was so hearty a Pro∣moter of the Reformation, that he became the Head of the Protestant Party.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Mary</HI> became a Wi∣dow by the Death of King <HI>Francis</HI> II. the Prior of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> was sent by the Protestant Nobility, to invite the Queen home; and soon after her Ar∣rival, her Majesty having nam'd a new Privy Council, the Lord <HI>James</HI> her Brother was appointed one of the Number, and not long thereafter he was sent with a Commission of Lieu∣tenancy to the Borders, to suppress an Insurrection that was threatned in those Parts; and he discharged the Trust reposed in him with such Cou¦rage and Fidelity, that upon his Re∣turn the Queen was graciously pleas'd to bestow upon her Brother the Earl∣dom of <HI>Mar,</HI> then in the Crown; but the Lord <HI>Erskine</HI> being found to have Right to the Earldom of <HI>Mar,</HI> that Lord was by Way of Justice restored to that Honour, in Lieu whereof the Prior of <HI>St. Andrews</HI> was made Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> 10th <HI>February</HI> 1562<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub. Arch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After this the Earl continued in the greatest Favour with the Queen, without any Interruption, till the 1565 that her Majesty declared her Resolu∣tion to marry the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> that my Lord <HI>Murray</HI> and many others did oppose the Match, upon Pretext of the Danger that might arise to Reli∣gion and to the State by that Union, forasmuch as it had not been practised at any Time, to impose a King upon the Nation without the Advice and Consent of Parliament; and in order to put a more effectual Stop thereto, <HI>They made,</HI> says Sir <HI>James Melvil, an Essay to take the Lord</HI> Darnly <HI>in the Queen's Company at the Raid of</HI> Baith, <HI>and as they alledged, to have sent him to</HI> England: But sailing in their En∣terprise, they were so closely pursued by the Queen's Troops, that they thought it the safest Course for them to flee to <HI>England,</HI> where they met but with a very cold Reception from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho' she had very much encourag'd them under-hand to enter into those Measures, to disturb the Peace and Tranquillity of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to fully the Glory of Queen <HI>Ma∣ry</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>After the Queen's Marriage with the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> a Parliament was call'd, before which the Earl of <HI>Mur∣ray</HI> and his Associates were summon'd to answer a Charge of High-Treason, which was prepar'd against them, and the Earl would have undoubted∣ly been denounced Rebel, and for∣faulted, had not the Murther of <HI>Da∣vid Rizio</HI> prevented it, which hap∣pen'd Three Days before the sitting down of the Parliament. At the Day appointed the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> retur∣ned home, and went straight to the Parliament House, and took Instru∣ments that he was ready to answer the Summons of Treason; but such was the Confusion of Affairs, that no
<PB N="358" REF="368"/>
Evidence came against him, and the Queen believing him innocent of <HI>Rizio</HI>'s Murther, was pleased to give him a gracious Pardon, restore him to her wonted Favour, and to place an unsuspected Confidence in him; but the Broils of the Country still in∣creasing more and more, especially af∣ter the Murther of the Lord <HI>Darnly,</HI> he obtain'd the Queen's Leave to tra∣vel, which he did, first into <HI>England,</HI> and thence into <HI>France,</HI> where he re∣mained till the Queen had made a Re∣signation of the Government, and the Prince King <HI>James</HI> VI. her Son, set upon the Throne, that he was call'd hom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be Regent to the young King; to which Office he was chosen by those of the Nobility who adhered to the Prince in his Absence, on the 22d of <HI>August</HI> 1567. In <HI>December</HI> thereafter he call'd a Parliament, wherein the Pope's Authority was abolished, and the true Protestant Religion receiv'd a new Sanction; thereafter having settled the Government, and seeming secure in it, he was on the 23d of <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> 1570, unexpectedly, as he was riding thro' the Street of <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> far from apprehending any Danger, shot from a Window with a Musket, in the lower Part of his Belly, by <HI>James Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Bothwel-haugh,</HI> in Revenge of a private Injury the Re∣gent had done him, and in the Instant falling from his Horse, died the same Evening. Few Days after his Body was removed to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and with great Funeral Solemnity interr'd in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Church, where a Monu∣ment was erected over his Grave, with this Inscription upon it.<Q><HI>Pietas sine Vindice luget:</HI><LB/><HI>Jus exarmatum est.</HI><LB/>23. <HI>Januarii</HI> 1570.<LB/><HI>JACOBO STEWARTO,</HI><LB/>Moraviae <HI>Comiti,</HI><LB/>SCOTIAE <HI>Proregi,</HI><LB/><HI>Viro, Aetatis suae longe optimo, ab Ini∣micis omnis Memoriae deterrimis, ex in∣sidiis extincto, ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Patri communi, Pa∣tria maerens posuit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As to the Regent's Character Mr. <HI>Buchanan</HI> his old Tutor and faithful Friend, draws a very fair and bright one of him; and some later Writers, whose Pens perhaps have been directed as much by Malice as Truth, have en∣deavoured to give the World a very ill Impression of him; and I observe that generally Men pass their Judg∣ments upon him according to the Par∣ty they are of; for these Reasons I shall not take his Character from any Party Writer, either of the one or the other Side. And therefore shall rather choice to recite that given by Bishop <HI>Spotiswood,</HI> than add any of my own. <HI>His Death,</HI> says that Reve∣rend Author, <HI>was by all Men greatly la∣mented, especially by the Commons, who loved him as their Father, whilst he liv'd, and now m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn'd grievously at his Death, the great Things he had wrought in his Life (having in the Space of one Year and little more, quieted the State which he found broken and disorder'd) made his very Enemies speak of him with Praise and Commendation, above all his Vertues which were not a few, he shined in Pi∣ety toward GOD, ordering himself and his Family in such Sort, as it did more resemble a Church than a Court; for therein, besides the Exercise of Devotion which he never omitted, there was no Wickedness to be seen, nay not an un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemly wanton Word to be heard, a Man truly good, and worthy to be ranked a∣mong the best Governors that this King∣dom hath enjoyed; and therefore to this Day is honoured with the Title of,</HI> The Good Regent.</P>
<P>The Regent married <HI>Agnes,</HI> Daugh∣ter of <HI>William</HI> Earl Marischal, by whom he had Two Daughters, <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> Countess of <HI>Murray,</HI> the Heir of his Honour and Estate, and <HI>Mary</HI> mar∣ried to <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Errol.</HI></P>

<P>THE Ancestor of this ancient Family <HI>David de Oliphard,</HI> was one of those Barons who accompanied King <HI>David</HI> I. to <HI>England,</HI> with an Army to the Assistance of <HI>Maude</HI> the Empress, his Niece, against King <HI>Stephen,</HI> of whom 'tis memorable, that after the raising of the Siege of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> in the 1142, King <HI>David</HI> was so closely pursu'd, that he was in a very great Hazard of being made a Priso∣ner, had it not been for the singular Valour of this noble Person, who had the Honour to rescue and bring off the King his Sovereign, to his immortal Honour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple's Collections, P. 174.</NOTE>.

What Part this Lord acted in the troublesome Times that ensu'd in the End of this Reign, I have not been able to dis∣cover.

<P><HI>BOETHIUS,</HI> and some other Historians of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation do reckon, that the first Ancestor of this ancient and noble Family, came from <HI>Hungary</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. in the Retinue of <HI>Edward</HI> the Out-law of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>Margaret</HI> his Sister, thereafter Queen of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But as this Asser∣tion of Mr. <HI>Bois</HI>'s is without Autho∣rity, or even so much as Probability; so I rather incline with some modern Antiquaries, who have enquired with great Curiosity into the Origin and Progress of Sirnames among us, to think the first Ancestor of the <HI>Maules</HI> to have come from <HI>France,</HI> and extra∣cted from the noble Family of <HI>de Maulia,</HI> so call'd from a fair Lordship of that Name in the Dutchy of <HI>Nor mandy;</HI> the first of whom I have found using the Sirname, was <HI>Petrus de Mau∣lia, Filtus</HI> Ansoldi, <HI>Filit Guarini,</HI> who gave, <HI>Anno</HI> 1076, to the Monks of <HI>Uttica,</HI> the Churches of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and St. <HI>Germain, in villa quae nuncupatur</HI> Maulia, for the Salvation of his Soul<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Odericus Vitalis in his Ecclesiastical History, Book V. printed in Andrew du Chyne's Collecton of the Norman Writers.</NOTE>, according to the Devo∣tion of these Times, when good Works were believed to be meritori∣ous with Almighty GOD; and de∣parting this Life in <HI>January</HI> 1101<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, was inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d in the Cloister of <HI>Uttica,</HI> with an Epitaph over his Grave, of which this is a Part,<Q><L>Post Annos Agni centum cum mille superni,</L>

<P>Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Son and Heir, who was a Gentleman of great Account in that Time; from a Principle of De∣votion, according to the Piety of those Times, he ratified and confirmed to the Abbacy of <HI>Coupar,</HI> and to the Monks serving GOD there, certain Lands within the Barony of <HI>Panmure,</HI> with a Right to a Fishing in the east Haven of <HI>Panmure,</HI> which had been formerly given to the said Abbacy by Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Predecessor, Sir <HI>Philip de Valoniis,</HI> and that <HI>pro salute animae suae,</HI> Elizabethae <HI>sponsae suae,</HI> Alexandri Maule <HI>filii sui &amp; haeredis, omntum an∣tecessorum &amp; successorum suorum in per∣petu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibidem ad Annum 1456.</NOTE>.

This Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was made a Kt. by King <HI>James</HI> IV. by whom he was much valued and esteemed, as a Per∣son well affected to the Government both in Church and State.</P>
<P>As the King had a great Regard for Sir <HI>Thomas Maule,</HI> so the Churchmen profess'd a more than ordinary Ho∣nour and Esteem of him; for the then Abbot of <HI>Coupar,</HI> with full Consent and Approbation of his Convent made him Baily of their Barony of <HI>Barry,</HI> a Jurisdiction, tho' of no great Va∣lue of itself, yet was such as the great Men before the Reformation affected to exerce, that they might be thought friendly to the Church, which was then no ill Politick, all Things consi∣dered.

<P>Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> being the particular Fa∣vourite of his Master, King <HI>James</HI> IV. he accompanied him to the Bat∣tle of <HI>Flowdon;</HI> and while he was on his Way thither, he made his Testament at <HI>Dundee,</HI> that he might free himself of all worldly Intanglemonts, and the better, as he expresses it himself, to dispose him to the Service of his King and Country<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, in the War.

Tho' this generous Design prov'd abortive, and the young King still detain'd by those who had him in their Hands, and the Laird of <HI>Pan∣mure</HI> oblig'd to take a Remission for it, as it had been the foulest Treason; yet the King when he came to Age, retained a very lasting Sense of that Service, as a very loyal Appearance; and ever afterward treated <HI>Panmure</HI> on that Account with the greatest Re∣spect and Esteem, insomuch as after his Majesty assumed the Government on himself, he grants a Dispensation to this <HI>Robert Maule</HI> of <HI>Panmure, For the true, good and thankful Service done to his said Majesty by him, to remain and bide at Home during all the Days of his Life, from all Hosts, Roads within the Realm, or without the same, by Sea or Land, and from all Attendance on Par∣liaments, Courts of Justiciary, of Cham∣berlanry,</HI> &amp;c<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Panmure.</NOTE>.

<P>Tho' this Loyal Gentleman was af∣ter this under no Necessity of ever appearing in any publick Action, by vertue of the King's Dispensa∣tion; yet he no sooner saw his Coun∣try threatned with Danger by Party and Faction, after the Death of King <HI>James</HI> V. than at the Command of the Regent the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> he rais'd his Vassals and Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainers, joined the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> and others, and attacked the Town of <HI>Perth,</HI> which the Lord <HI>Ruthven</HI> held out against the Queen's Authority; Tho' they were at first re∣puls'd, and the Laird of <HI>Panmure,</HI> who first made the Attack, was taken Pri∣soner; yet in the End the Affair came to be adjusted to the Satisfaction of the Governor<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mr. Maule's Hist.

<HI>Thomas Maule</HI> of <HI>Boath,</HI> his own Consin-German. After the End of the War, as he liv'd in great Splen∣dor at home, and made a very con∣siderable Figure in the Country, so he had severals of Notes who were re∣tained to serve him; and among others, I find <HI>John Scrimzeor,</HI> Con∣stable of <HI>Dundee,</HI> gives him his Bond of Manrent and Service, as his Supe∣rior, in Consequence of a former Obli∣gation of the same Nature, which Sir <HI>James Scrimzeor</HI> his Predecessor had formerly made to Sir <HI>Thomas Maule</HI> of <HI>Panmure,</HI> which by his own Obligati∣on he ratifies and renews, of the Date, 10th of <HI>May</HI> 1563<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Comitem de Panmure.

This loyal and brave Man afterward accompa∣nied Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in her Northern Progress as far as <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and would have march'd with her all the Length she design'd in those Parts, had not the afflicted Circumstances of his Fa∣mily call'd him to return Home, with the Queen's Permission, so that he was not at the Fight of <HI>Corichy,</HI> which happen'd soon thereafter; but her Ma∣jesty did not want any further Testi∣mony of his Loyalty, having been fully satisfied in his Fidelity and Af∣fection to the Crown, by many re∣peated Instances through the whole Course of his Life before.</P>
<P>When the Troubles broke out in this Reign he did not meddle much with either Party, but kept himself as much, if not more, out of the Broils of the Times, than any other of his Quality in the Kingdom; for in all the publick Transactions during the Course of the War, I don't find him ever concerned in any publick Deed, save in that Association<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bond at G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asgow, now printed.</NOTE> which was entered into, in the Year of GOD 1567, by the Bulk of the Nation, for the Inauguration of the young Prince King <HI>James</HI> VI. upon the Queen his Mother's Resignation: And I observe the Bond is not only signed by those who were the great∣est Promoters of the Reformation, but even by others of the Nobility and Gentry who were of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and afterward adhered to the Queen with great Firmness and Fidelity, which gives me Ground to believe they were not then throughly acquainted with the Circumstances by which the Dimission was extorted from her, otherwise I cannot think, that Men of Honour, could have shifted as so many of them did, all of a sud∣den, and become most inveterate E∣nemies to the Government that suc∣ceeded during the whole of the young King's Minority.</P>

Mr. <HI>Maule</HI> had a Turn to Antiquities, particularly of his own Country, in which he was very exact. He wrote several Trea∣ties with great Judgment and Learn∣ing, one, which he calls, <HI>Periodi Gentis</HI> Scotorum, the Abstract whereof he gives in these Words, <HI>Has in septem partiti sumus; quarum prima initium ducit a primo</HI> Scotorum <HI>ex</HI> Hispaniâ <HI>adventu, &amp; in</HI> Albium <HI>appulsu, &amp; tempus illud totum occupabit quo nostri sub Philarchis, usque ad primum crea∣tum</HI>

<P>He wrote likewise a History of the noble Family of which he was a Son, and in which, no Doubt, there were several great Men; as also another Treatise <HI>De Antiquitate Gentis</HI> Scoto∣rum, in a tolerable pure <HI>Latin</HI> Stile, which he says, was written <HI>contra</HI> An∣glorum <HI>Calumnias &amp; Mendacia,</HI> and seems to be plainly levelled against the <HI>English</HI> Antiquary Mr. <HI>Cambden,</HI> who about that Time, I think, had published his <HI>Britannia,</HI> wherein he asserts some Things that the <HI>Scots</HI> Antiquaries were mightily displeas'd with, and none more than Commis∣sar <HI>Maule,</HI> who was one of the most strenuous Asserters of the Freedom and Independency of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and among the first who attacked <HI>Camb∣den;</HI> in which he was seconded by Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> of <HI>Godscroft,</HI> and afterward by the learned Mr. <HI>Drummond</HI> of <HI>Hawthorn∣den.</HI> Beside other very judicious Re∣marks on the History of his Country, I observe from the little I have seen of Mr. <HI>Maule</HI>'s M S. that he hath happily hit upon a better Notion of the ancient <HI>Culdees,</HI> than any Author before him; and when I have Occa∣sion to peruse more of his Book in Relation to that Matter, I shall not fail to do his Memory all imaginable Justice, and frankly own the Helps I had from him in a Dissertation con∣cerning the <HI>Culdees</HI> I have by me, and which I intend, GOD willing, to communicate to the World.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Maule</HI> of <HI>Pitlivie</HI> the fifth Son, married <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter to . . . . . . <HI>Lighton</HI> of <HI>Ulishaven,</HI> by whom he had two Sons, <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Robert Maules,</HI> Esquires, which last was Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>Thomas Maule</HI> the elder Brother, transport∣ed himself to the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he established a Family, which still continues in that Kingdom with Lustre, and being a gallant brave Man, and a most hearty Loyalist in the Service of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. in the Time of the Civil War, was Lieute∣nant Colonel to the Marquis of <HI>Or∣mond</HI>'s own Regiment, when he a∣cted as Lieutenant General for the King in that Kingdom.

<P>Which <HI>Patrick</HI> being a Person of good Parts and Qualities, and of a Family which had always been firm to the Crown, in his Youth betook himself to the Court of King <HI>James,</HI> and being of a pleasant Humor and Disposition, of a notable Affability in his Behaviour, and well qualified by his Breeding for any Service his Master should think fit to employ him in, he quickly grew to be very acceptable to the King, and into a general Esteem with the Court, in∣somuch as his Majesty in a short Time made him one of the Gentle∣men of the Bedchamber, about the Time or a little after his Entrance to <HI>England</HI> in 1603, and as he attend∣ed his Majesty into that Kingdom, so he lived upon his own Fortune, without any other Support than the Profits of his Place, and his Maje∣sty's Favour. Mr. <HI>Maule</HI> liv'd al∣ways decently, and in a fair Intelli∣gence with the Favourites, having always Credit enough to provide for his own Interest, without troubling himself with that of other Men. And that which made him exceedingly beloved in the Court, was, that he never desired to get that for himself which others laboured for, but was ever ready to use his Interest with his Master, to promote the Preten∣ces of worthy Men. As this his Behaviour made him many Friends, so few or none had the Confidence to avow themselves to be his Ene∣mies: and as he had always a full Share in his Majesty's Esteem and Favour, who looked on him as a wise and faithful Servant, so he was gra∣ciously pleased to give many Testi∣monies thereof, particularly in a new Charter to him, under the Great Seal, of his ancient Barony of <HI>Panmure</HI> in 1610.

<P>For King <HI>James</HI> was ever most so∣licitous, after the restoring of Epi∣scopacy, to have the Laick Patrona∣ges in the Hands of such Persons as were Friends to the Church as then established by Law; and his Son King <HI>Charles</HI> of ever blessed Memory, who did not come short of his Royal Fa∣ther, but rather exceeded him in his Zeal for the Church, being fully sa∣tisfied of Mr. <HI>Maule</HI>'s Affection that Way, and of his unblemished Inte∣grity in the Protestant Religion, his Majesty gave his Royal Consent and Approbation to the Transaction, which passed betwixt him and the Earl of <HI>Dysart,</HI> by which he purcha∣sed the Abbacy of <HI>Aberbrothock,</HI> which was erected into a temporal Lordship, with the Right of Patronage of the Churches of <HI>Aberbrothock, Arbirlot, Monikie, Muirhouse, Dunighton, Maynes, Lunan, Inverkilor, Ethie, Monisuith, Clova, Ruthven, Glamis, Kirriemuir, Kingoldrum, Newtyle, Gaval, Dunbug, Abernethy, Inverness, Aberchirdor, Bamff, Glamrie, Langlie, Guildie, Ki∣nernie, Banchorie Trinity, Bethelvie, Forgie, Fyvie, Tarves, Nig</HI> and <HI>Feter∣angus</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Coinitem de Panmure.</NOTE>, all sormerly belonging to the dissolved Monastry of <HI>Aberl ro∣thock,</HI> which besides the old Patro∣nages of his own Family, made him among the greatest Patrons of any in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Maule</HI> of <HI>Panmure</HI> liv'd in the greatest Favour a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Esteem with King <HI>James,</HI> who had always a very good Opinion of him, so at his Death he commended him to his Son King <HI>Charles,</HI> as a Person to be relied on in Honour and Fidelity, of which that Prince himself was also very well satis∣fied and pleased, for he not only con∣tinued him in his Bedchamber, but made him also Sheriff-Principal of <HI>Forfarshire,</HI> when the Crown acqui∣red the Hereditary Right of that Of∣fice from the Family of <HI>Gray</HI> in 1632<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Charta in Rotulis Caroli I. ad Annum 163<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>, the King always lodging these new acquired Jurisdictions in the Hands of such Persons as he could confide in.</P>
<P>When the Troubles broke out, Mr. <HI>Maule,</HI> being a Person of most emi∣nent Affection and of intire Devotion to the Crown, adhered to the King with great Honour and Fidelity, was with him in all the Battles in which his Majesty was ingaged in his own Royal Person, and thereafter went with him to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he stay'd till the first War was brought to an End, by his Majesty's putting him∣self in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army before <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>Assoon as it was known where the King was, Mr. <HI>Maule</HI> repaired to him and waited on him thence to <HI>New∣castle,</HI> when his Majesty thought fit to put a lasting Mark of his Favour on his old faithful Servant, and made him a Peer, by the Title of <HI>Earl of Panmure, August</HI> 3d 1646<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Panmure.</NOTE>, with as great Circumstances of Grace and Favour as could be expressed: For in the Preamble to the Patent, his Ma∣jesty was graciously pleased to call to Remembrance his Lordship's Servi∣ces to his Father, and his Fidelity to himself, which he declared in these Words, <HI>WHEREAS We have par∣ticular Knowledge of the long and faith∣ful Service of Our well beloved</HI> Patrick Maule <HI>Baron of</HI> Panmure, <HI>one of the Gentlemen of Our Bedchamber, both in the Reign of Our most dear Father of ever blessed Memory, and also ever since Our Accession to the Throne, now these one and twenty Years, by a close Adhe∣rence to Our Sacred Person; and seeing We are most ready to bestow some Mark of Our Royal Favour on the said</HI> Pa∣trick, <HI>now that he is turning old:</HI> KNOW YE THERFORE, That We have created, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Thereafter when the King was de∣livered up by the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, to such Persons whom the <HI>English</HI> Par∣liament had appointed to receive him, the Earl of <HI>Panmure</HI> attended on his Majesty to <HI>Holmby</HI> in <HI>Northampton∣shire;</HI> and tho the Parliament's Com∣missioners had declared, that his Ma∣jesty should be treated with all De∣monstration of Respect and Duty, and waited on by such of his Ser∣vants as he should appoint, yet he had not continued there many Days before the Parliament gave Orders to dismiss such of his Servants as were there, and had waited on him at <HI>Ox¦ford:</HI> And tho the Demand was very grating to the King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Journal by the Earl of Panmure of what pass'd during his Lordship's Attendance on his Ma∣jesty at Holmb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, penes Comitem de Panmure.</NOTE>, yet that he might not seem to refuse to give them Satisfaction in any Thing they required, he yielded to their Desire, but in the Instant they were to be discharged, the King signified that it would be well pleasing to him, that the Commissioners would allow only Two of his old trusty Servants to attend him, and this he would look upon as a Testimony of their Respect to him; which being grant∣ed, his Majesty was pleased to pitch upon the Earl of <HI>Panmure</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Dirletoun,</HI> both the Earls be∣ing Persons in whom his Majesty had an absolute Confidence, and that he was sure neither of them would ei∣ther deceive or betray him. The Earl of <HI>Panmure</HI> was with his Maje∣sty, when Cornet <HI>Joice</HI> came on the 3d of <HI>June</HI> 1647, with a Troop of Horse, and violently seized on the King's Person, and carried him from <HI>Holmby</HI> to the Army, and after to <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> his Lordship having Liberty to attend his Master in all the Removes he made, which was to his Majesty's great Satisfaction: And tho at first the King enjoyed himself much more, having the Li∣berty of his own Servants, than he had before, when he was at <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mby:</HI> Yet alas! It was not long before the chief Officers of the Army seem'd more regardless of the King, and trea∣ted his Servants with less Civility, insomuch as his Majesty (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom an Apprehension they had some secret Design upon his Life) made his E∣scape upon the 11th <HI>November</HI> 1648 from <HI>Hampton Court</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History of the Rebellion.</NOTE>, and unhap∣pily went to the Island of <HI>Wight,</HI> which prov'd so fatal to him. Thi∣ther his Lordship, so soon as he had Intelligence where the King was gone, repaired to him, having no Reason to doubt but that his Presence would be very acceptable to his Master<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Journal by the Earl of Panmure, while his Lordship waited on the King during his Imprisonment.</NOTE>: And his Lordship attended in his Of∣fice in the Bedchamber, till his Ma∣jesty having refused to give his Roy∣al Assent to the four Bills the Par∣liament had then sent to him, which he said did divest him of all Sove∣reignty, that Colonel <HI>Hamond</HI> the Governor of the Place, by Order from his Masters, caused all the King's Servants to be immediately put out of <HI>Carisbrook castle,</HI> and forbid any of them to repair thither any more upon their Peril<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History of the Rebellion.</NOTE>; whereupon the Earl, after the King had used many gracious Expressions of his Lordships faithful Services, kissed his Majesty's Hands, and took a sad Farewell of his Master, appearing to have little Hope ever to see him again in this World, and departing for <HI>Scotland,</HI> lived quietly at his own House in the Country, keeping his Heart and Af∣fections always intire for the King.</P>
<P>After the Murther of his Majesty, and the total Suppression of the Roy∣al Cause, tho the Earl of <HI>Panmure</HI> was very aged, and so out of Capa∣city himself to have appeared in any

<P>After which he lived with Ease and Plenty in his Fortune, which was ve∣ry great, and in great Reputation with all those who wished well to the Crown; the Restoration of which, as no Man more heartily wished, so he had the Comfort of seeing it brought about, by a most surprising Act of Providence, when there appeared least Hope of it, and least worldly Means to bring it to pass, which was the Thing his Lordship had longed most passionately to see before he should leave the World. He died on the 22d of <HI>December</HI> 1661, and was inter'd in the Vault of his Family at <HI>Panbride</HI> Church, with his Ancestors.</P>
<P>This noble Earl married three Wives, first, <HI>Frances</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>Edward Stanhope</HI> of <HI>Grimstoun,</HI> of the County of <HI>York,</HI> Knight, of the same Family with the Earl of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> by whom he had four Children, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<PB N="400" REF="410"/>
in <HI>Scotland</HI> in 1650, pursuant to the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> his Lordship being now of Age, of Parts, and un∣doubted Loyalty and Affection to the Crown, waited on his Majesty, his Father the old Earl being now struck in Years and troubled with the Infirmities of Age: And assoon as the Parliament raised an Army for the King, the Lord <HI>Brechin</HI> being a Nobleman not only firm to the Prin∣ciples of Monarchy, but also of great Duty and Affection to the Person of the King, heartily engaged in the Service himself, and endeavoured to dispose all those, upon whom he had Influence, to take the same Resolu∣tions; and it soon appeared his In∣terest in the Country was very great, for his Lordship being appointed Co∣lonel of the <HI>Forfarshi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> Regiment of Horse, many of the principal Gentle∣men engaged themselves in the Ser∣vice, and came to his Regiment out of Devotion and Respect to his Lord∣ship, as well as Duty to the King, and served under him as Officers. His Lordship was at the Head of his Re∣giment at the unsuccessful Battles of <HI>Dunbar</HI> and <HI>Inverkeithing,</HI> at both which he fought with very remark∣able Courage, and at the last of these his Regiment behaved so well, and suffered so much, that he himself was wounded, his Lieutenant Colonel and Major and many other of his Of∣ficers killed; and when the Action was over, his Soldiers were so dis∣persed, that scarce sixty of them could ever be got together again. But that Misfortune did not in the least discourage him from being eve∣ry Way as active and forward again in advancing and conducing all he could toward his Majesty's Service, for after the Coronation was over, in which his Lordship assisted as a young Peer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Douglass's Sermon preached at the Coronation of King Charles II. first of January 1650.</NOTE>, when the Parlia∣ment appointed another Army to be raised for the Recovery of his other two Kingdoms, <HI>Scotland</HI> being intire∣ly united in his Majesty's Service, no Body appeared more forward to advance the Work in Hand than the Lord <HI>Brechin,</HI> in order to which his Lordship was one of those who met with old General <HI>Lesly</HI> Earl of <HI>Levin,</HI> and several other Peers and Officers of Note, at <HI>Eliot</HI> in <HI>Augus,</HI> as a Place which was thought very favourable for making Levies, which they all in∣tended; but they had not stay'd long there, when the Lord <HI>Brechin</HI> gave it as his Opinion, that the Place where they were had nothing for Defence, and advised the General to draw further into the Country for their Security, and told the General, that he was not sure, that if a Detachment from the Garrison of <HI>Dundee</HI> should make a brisk Attempt, they might not be all surprised and taken out of their Beds: But the General being of ano∣ther Mind, his Lordship, who better knew the Country than any of the other Lords, and so more sensible of the Danger, to secure himself left the Committee, and retired to <HI>Sidlaw∣hills;</HI> and it was soon evident what the Lord <HI>Brechin</HI> had advised was right, for the very Evening of the Day, or soon after he had left them, the whole Committee was surprised and taken Prisoners by a strong Par∣ty of the <HI>English,</HI> and sent to <HI>London,</HI> and committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where all of them except General <HI>Lesly</HI> un∣derwent a long Imprisonment, even till the Restoration of the King.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Brechin</HI> being at Liber∣ty in the <HI>Hills,</HI> the Loyalists, from all Quarters, resorted to him, after the Fight of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and put them∣selves under his Command; and his Lordship behaved in that Station ve∣ry worthily, and made often Skirmi∣shes

<NOTE PLACE="foot">N. B. When the Government was first alarmed by an Insurrection in the South in 1666, so soon as the Resolution was declared to raise an Army to suppress it, they who had the chief Di∣rection of Affairs did repose such Confidence both in the Earl of Panmnre's Loyalty and Skill in military Affairs, that he was appointed to command the Gentry of Forfar-shire; but the Defeat at Pentland by General Dalziel prevented the raising that or any of the Northern Counties, the Peace of the Kingdom being thereby secured.</NOTE> with the Enemy, and sometimes with notable Advantage, and made frequent Incursions in the Night in∣to the <HI>English</HI> Quarters, which gave General <HI>Monk</HI> some Trouble; But being convinced of the Impossibility of keeping up an Attempt, which at last must prove ruinous to himself, and could do the King no Service, he made his Peace with the General next Year, without any other Com∣pliance to the present Powers than the laying down his Arms, and thereupon retired to his own House, where he remained quietly, prepared and disposed to run the Fortune of the Crown, to which he was most entirely devoted, in any other At∣tempt.</P>
<P>When the King came Home in 1660, his Lordship repaired to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> to congratulate his Majesty and the Royal Family upon their happy Restoration; and tho' his Majesty received his Lordship with a very good Countenance, yet he was not rewarded with any great Dignity or Preferment, as was expected, and with which some others were, who had not been so faithfull to the King, as the Earl of <HI>Panmure.</HI> But as that was the Fate of very many of the loyal Party, who had served the King with the utmost Fidelity, as well as his Lordship, so it was much more to be imputed to the Ministry than to the King himself: For 'tis report∣ed, that some in great Credit with his Majesty endeavoured to instill in∣to the King's Mind a Principle, that he must prefer his Enemies, and ad∣vance them, to gain them to be his Friends; and for his old Friends, it was no matter how he used them, for they would be so still: And indeed it fell out so, that very many, who had suffered most in their Persons and Fortunes for the Crown, were not recompensed upon the Restoration, according to their Merit, or conside∣red as they deserved: Of which Number this Noble Earl, I may tru∣ly say, was one of the most eminent Instances; which mistaken Politick of the then States-men, as it was ob∣served thro' that whole Reign, so ma∣ny great and wise Men have thought, that its being followed, did bring no small Prejudice and Inconve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence to the Crown thereafter. But notwith∣standing his Lordship was overlook∣ed as to any Preserment, yet he did not on that Account, as many others did, oppose himself to the Court, but in all the Parliaments and National Conventions, which were called while he lived, and on which his Lordship constantly attended, he always di∣stinguished himself by a hearty Con∣currence in whatsoever was proposed for advancing the Honour of the Crown, and the Welfare and Happi∣ness of the Kingdom, which he made manifest by his several Speeches, whereby he left behind him lasting Monuments of his great Knowledge in our Constitution and Laws, of his unshaken Loyalty to his Prince, and his intire Love to his Country, inso∣much as I have heard some eminent Men, who were his Contemporaries, speak of him with great Honour, as a Nobleman in as high Reputation for his great Abilities and eminent Inte∣grity as any Man of his Time, and dying 24. of <HI>March</HI> 1671, he was in∣terr'd at <HI>Panbride</HI> with his Ancestors.</P>
<P>This Noble Earl married <HI>Jean</HI> el∣dest Daughter of <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Low∣doun,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.

<P><HI>James Maule</HI> of <HI>Balumby</HI> his Brother, who alter having passed the Course of his Studies at Home, together with his younger Brother, travel'd abroad into foreign Parts: He serv'd as a Volunteer at the Siege of <HI>Luxem∣burgh,</HI> where he eminently signaliz'd his Courage, insomuch as his Valour was very particulary taken Notice of.</P>
<P>Upon his Accession to the Honour he was named one of the Lords of his Majesty's Privy-Council, from which he was soon thereafter removed, for not complying with the Design of the Court, in taking away the penal Laws against Popery. But tho' his Lordship did always shew himself ve∣ry firm to the Protestant Interest thro' the whole of that Reign, yet in the Convention of Estates he vigorously appeared for the Interest of King <HI>James;</HI> and when the Crown was set∣tled on King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> he left the Meeting, and has since continued a Non-juror.</P>
<P>When the great Affair of the Uni∣on with <HI>England</HI> came to be conside∣red in the Parliament, tho' his Lord∣ship did not think fit to qualify him∣self by taking the Oaths enjoined by Law, to enter his Dissent against it in a Parliamentary Way as a Peer, yet no Body was more heartily averse to it, as appeared both from his meet∣ing with the Principals of those who

<P>Which <HI>Archbald</HI> being a Person of excellent Parts of Nature, his Father took great Care to breed him in the Study of the Law; and in which he made a very notable Progress by an early Eminence in Practice and Learn∣ing, insomuch as he was by the Choice of his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and the full and hearty Approbation of the Council, preferred to be Clerk to the Privy-Council, on the 2d of <HI>September</HI> 1641<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Rosebery.</NOTE>, a Place his Fa∣ther had long and worthily fill'd; and the King had so good an Opinion of Mr. <HI>Primerose</HI>'s Fidelity, Judgment and Discrerion, that by a Letter un∣der his own Royal Hand, bearing Date 18th <HI>December</HI> 1641, he orde∣red him to transmit to Court an Ac∣count weekly of what was transacted in the Council, as his Father had done; and which he continued to do, till all private Correspondence with his Majesty and all about the Court, was discharged upon the highest Pe∣nalty. During the Civil War he was a great Loyalist; and after the Bat∣tle of <HI>Kilsyth</HI> repair'd to the Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> at the Time when he was join'd by divers of the Nobility and Officers of State<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bishop Guthry's Memoirs, Page 156.</NOTE>, and conti∣nued with him till the unfortunate Battle of <HI>Philiphaugh,</HI> he was made Prisoner, and try'd, and found guilty of High Treason by the Parliament at St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s 1646; and tho' seve∣ral others who were not more guilty than he were put to Death, yet by the Intercession and Interposition of his Friends, particularly the Mar∣quis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who was his Lady's near Relation, his Life was sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd; yet he continued a Prisoner till the Marquis of <HI>Montrose</HI> and the Com∣mittee of Estates came to a Capitu∣lation, whereby the Marquis was to depart the Kingdom, which he did; and thereupon several of his Friends were set at Liberty, of which Num∣ber this worthy Person, whose Me∣moirs I write, was one. Thereafter when the Parliament declar'd for the King, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais'd an Army to relieve him, when he was a Prisoner in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> no Body appear'd more forward in a prudent Way, to ad∣vance that Enterprize, than Sir <HI>Arch∣bald Primerose,</HI> which was afterward very gratefully remember'd by the Crown upon a more favourable Con∣juncture.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> had the Ho∣nour of Knighthood confer'd on him, I cannot say, but I apprehend it was in the End of 1646, when he was set at Liberty, that he waited on his Majesty when he put himself into the Hands of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army before <HI>New∣ark,</HI> tho' I have not found him so designed in any Write for some Time after.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> having continued his faithful Services to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Time he remained in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he likewise marched with him into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> when his Majesty, by a Patent under his Royal Hand, bearing Date, <HI>At</HI> Woodhouse, <HI>in our Royal Army on the South Borders of</HI> Scotland, 1<HI>st of</HI> August 1651<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Char∣ta penes Comitem de Rosebery.</NOTE>, made him a Baro∣net, <HI>In Consideration of the many good and faithful Services performed to us and our Royal Father of blessed Memo∣ry, in our most special Affairs, by Sir</HI> Archbald Primerose, <HI>Clerk to our Pri∣vy Council; and being desirous to gratify the Deserving of so faithful a Servant, with some special Mark of our Royal Fa∣vour,</HI>
<PB N="410" REF="420"/>
<HI>therefore</HI> &amp;c. After the Defeat at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that the Royal Party were totally suppress'd Sir <HI>Archbald Primerose</HI> being reckon'd among the first Form of Malignants, his Estate was not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>questrated. but even what S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Money could be dis∣covered to be owing him in private Hands, were discharged to be paid him; for Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> being a great Creditor upon Sir <HI>John J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston</HI> of <HI>Elphing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun</HI>'s Estate, I have seen an Order from General <HI>Disborough,</HI> strait¦ly <HI>inhibiting and discharging Sir</HI> John <HI>to pay to the said Sir</HI> Archbald <HI>any Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Money he might be owing him, upon his Peril.</HI></P>
<P>During the Remainder of the U¦surpation, Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> liv'd in a private and retir'd Manner till the joyful Restauration of the King, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he received the Reward of his Me∣rit, for his Majesty in <HI>August</HI> 1660, did appoint him Lord Register of <HI>Scotland</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Rosebery.</NOTE>, and one of the Senators of the College of Justice, where he sat many Years, and discharged the Office with great Judgment and Learning.</P>
<P>The great Services he did his Ma¦ster the King, and his Country when he was first made Lord Register, were acknowledged not only by Let∣ters under his Majesty's own Royal Hand, but by several of the great Men in <HI>England,</HI> particularly the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> then Lord Chancel∣lor of <HI>England,</HI> who wrote him a very civil Letter, wherein he has these re¦markable Words, <HI>I cannot, my Lord, but congratulate you for the meritorious Part you have had in restoring the King and Kingdom</HI> (meaning <HI>Scotland, to its primitive Hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur and Interest</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and concluding he says, <HI>I with the same good Spirit may possess you to the End, and with the same Success while we here endeavour to follow your Ex∣ample, which indeed hath already been of great Use to us.</HI></P>
<P>He was a great Lover of his Coun∣try, which he alwise manifested; for in the Matter of the Billoting in Par∣liament, tho' he was the Parl of <HI>Middleton</HI>'s Friend, yet he could ne∣ver be brought to favour that Pro∣ject but opposed it with all his Power: Which the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> did not resent against Sir <HI>Archbald,</HI> well know∣ing, as he himself owns, that the Lord Register's opposing him in the Project of the Billoting, did not pro∣ceed from any Dislike to his Lord∣ships Person, but from his known Principles of Moderation, and the Earl did not only then acknowledge the Sincerity of the Register's Friend∣ship to him, but even afterwards, at a Time when Professing to be the Lord <HI>Middleton</HI>'s Friend, was not thought very meritorious.</P>
<P>Thereafter, when the Ministry in that Reign did, as was thought, out∣face the Law by many bold Pressures upon the Subject, Sir <HI>Archbald Prime∣rose,</HI> tho' he was courted to enter into a strict Union with them, and that on his own Terms, yet could never be induced to concur in any Thing that had not a sufficient Foun∣dation in Law, but rejected all Of∣fers that were made for his own pri∣vate Advantage, that were not con∣sistent with the Good of his Country, and therefore he joined with those Lords who appeared most zealous for the Redress of Grievances, which brought him so much into the Jea∣lousy of the Court-Party, that upon a very trivial Account, he was, toge∣ther with the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Drumfrieze</HI> and <HI>Kineardine,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cochran,</HI> all in one Day turn'd out of the Council; but the Resentment was carried further against the Lord <HI>Carringtoun,</HI> and
<PB N="411" REF="421"/>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>a</HI>) Charta penes Comitem de Rosebery.</NOTE> many and very powerful Efforts were made to get him turned out of his Place too; but his Majesty, who had a great Esteem of him, as a very wise Man, and very worthy the Trust he had reposed in him, could not for a long Time be prevail'd with to hearken to any Overture that could be made for his Removal, till the Court Party, which the King re∣solved to support, did represent that it was necessary to have a Person in his Post, in whom they could confide, and that Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> being struck in Years, he himself desired to exchange his Office with another of an easier Nature; and upon this very Supposi∣tion, and on no other Consideration, did the King give Order for his Re∣moval from the Register's Place, and at the same Time p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efer'd him to be Justice General: But he continuing still firm to his Party, the Torrent a∣gainst him ran so high, that his Ma∣jesty, who still retain'd a very great Kindness for, and Esteem of him, thought fit at length to take his Place from him, to which Sir <HI>George Mac∣kenzie</HI> of <HI>Tarbat,</HI> a Person of great Honour and Worth was prefer'd the 16th of <HI>October</HI> 1678.</P>
<P>Thereafter, when the Differences run high betwixt the Two Parties, the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Athole,</HI> and the other Lords of that Side, who desir'd the Grievances of the Nation might be redressed, hum∣bly petitioned the King for a Hearing in his own Royal Presence, that the Matters in Difference might be more clearly understood, and more freely transacted; and his Majesty having granted their Desire, thought fit to propose that some fit Persons might be allowed to treat with the like Number of the other Side, in such a Manner as might best tend to com∣pose all Things in a peaceable Way; and Sir <HI>Archbald Primer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> being look'd on as a Person of the greatest Wisdom and Experience, and one who throughly understood the whole Frame and Constitution of the Go∣vernment in Church and State. The Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Athole,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Cassils, Perth,</HI> and <HI>Kincardine,</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cochran,</HI> well knowing how very useful Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> would be in the present Exi∣gence, did all conjunctly write very pressingly, That he should hasten up to <HI>London,</HI> to be present at the Con∣ference which was to be in his Maje∣sty's Presence; and the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> wrote him a most pathetical Letter, lively representing the Dangers which threatned, and were like to over∣whelm the Nation, if not prevented by a speedy Remedy, that now they had an Opportunity of making their Country happy, by removing all Grievances, if he and others would do their Duty; and therefore conju∣red him by many Arguments no longer to defer his Coming up; and concludes with these Words, <HI>My Lord, you see how</HI> Scotland <HI>is, you see how your Friends Reputation lyes at Stake, you see there is but this Pull for it; and you see how fairly it lyes at your Hand. The great God direct you to∣ward doing what is for his Honour, your Country's Good, the King's Interest, your Friends Reputation, and your per∣petual Credit.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Archbald</HI> thinking he had now a fair Opportunity of advancing the publick Good, and doing all those Offices to his Country he had ever so earnestly desir'd; and notwithstand∣ing he was stricken in Years, and troubled with the Infirmities of Age, yet he undertook a Journey to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> that he might be assisting in carrying on this good Work. Both 
<PB N="412" REF="422"/>
Parties being heard before the King; and his Majesty finding there could be no compounding this Dispute ami∣cably, but that one Side must be sup¦press'd, he resolved therefore in the End, by the Advice of some in his nearest Confidence, to dismiss the Lords of the Country Party, without a present Redress; forasmuch as it would reflect Dishonour upon his own Government, if he did not ap¦prove of the Administration of a great Minister, whom he had so long em∣ployed in his Service, and solely and entirely trusted in all that related to <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> Affairs: And now all Endeavours for Redress of the Nation's Grievances being render'd fruitless and to no Effect, Sir <HI>Arch¦bald</HI> with all convenient Expedition, set out for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and sickning in his Return, died within a few Weeks thereafter, on the 27th of <HI>November,</HI> 1679.</P>

<P>His Grace married <HI>Isobel,</HI> Daugh¦ter of <HI>William</HI> Marquis of <HI>Douglass,</HI> by whom he had <HI>James</HI> his Son and Heir, <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>March,</HI> and Lord <HI>George,</HI> a young Nobleman of great Hopes, who died in 1693, and a Daughter <HI>Anne,</HI> married to <HI>David</HI> Earl of <HI>Weems,</HI> and departing this Life at <HI>Ediaburgh</HI> the 28th of <HI>March</HI> 1695, was with great Funeral Solem∣nity interr'd at the Church of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣risdeer,</HI> with his Ancestors, where there is a magnificent Monument erected for him.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Queensbery</HI> his Son and Successor, was born on the 18th of <HI>December</HI> 1662, after he had gone thro' the Course of his Studies at the University of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> he went into Foreign Parts, to accomplish himself by Travels, <HI>Anno</HI> 1680. and upon his Return in 1684, was by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made one of the Privy Council, and Lieutenant Colonel of a Regiment of Horse commanded by Lieutenant General <HI>Graham,</HI> there∣after Viscount of <HI>Dundee;</HI> and he continued in these Posts till the Year 1688, about which Time he quitted them for Ill Usage at Court, and upon the Account of the Disagree∣ment of his Principles with their Measures.</P>
<P>The Revolution then happening to come on, he appear'd early in it, and was by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> upon his Acceptance of the Govern∣ment, made Colonel of the <HI>Scots</HI> Horse-Guards, and at the same Time one of the Privy Council, and one of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>In the 1690 King <HI>William</HI> sent him into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to command a separate Body of Troops under Lieutenant Ge∣neral <HI>Mackay;</HI> Two Years after, he was made one of the Lords of the Treasury; and in the Parliament 1693, he was authorized to sit and vote as Lord High Treasurer, his Fa∣ther being then alive, and he not a Peer, could not otherwise sit, but as an Officer of State, which depends on the Sovereign's Nomination.</P>
<P>The Duke his Father departing this Life as aforesaid in 1695, he laid aside all Thoughts of Military Em∣ployments, quitted the Command of the Guards, and was thereupon made Lord Privy Seal, and one of the Ex∣traordinary Lords of the Session.</P>
<P>His Majesty in 1700 was pleas'd to make him Lord High Commissio∣ner to represent his Royal Person in Parliament, where he held Two Ses∣sions by virtue of Two distinct Pa∣tents; and upon his Return to Court, his Majesty on the 18th <HI>June</HI> 1701, was pleas'd to honour the Duke with a distinguishing Mark of his Royal Favour, for that Evening, a Chapter being held of the most noble Order of the Garter at <HI>Kensingtoun,</HI> where the Sovereign was present, the Duke was then elected a Companion of the Order, and install'd at <HI>Windsor</HI> the 10th of <HI>July</HI> thereafter. His Grace having serv'd King <HI>William</HI> as long as he liv'd with great Fideli∣ty, her Majesty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> upon her Acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssion to the Throne, first made him Secretary of State; and entertaining the same just Sentiments of his Ability and Conduct, appoin∣ted him to be her Commissioner to represent her Royal Person in that Session of Parliament which met at
<PB N="419" REF="429"/>
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the 9th of <HI>June</HI> 1702; but the Legality of that Session meeting with great Opposition from a strong Party in the Parliament, who declared openly that they did not conceive themselves warranted to meet and act in that Session as a Par∣liament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Hamilton presented a Paper, which contained the Reasons of his Dissent, which may be seen at large in the History of Europe, and the Memoirs of Scotland, but is fo∣reign to my Purpose to insert it here.</NOTE>, and therefore did not only dissent from any Thing that should be done or acted therein, but withdrew, and remov'd from their Attendance: Wherefore her Majesty, to quiet the Minds of her People, was pleas'd to order the Duke to prorogue the Parliament, which his Grace did, and thereupon set out for <HI>London;</HI> where he was soon thereafter appoin∣ted One of the Commissioners upon the Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for treating of an Union betwixt both Nations; but tho' the Commissioners of the respe∣ctive Kingdoms met several Times, and settled Preliminaries on both Sides; yet upon a more mature De∣liberation, the Court concluded that it was not a fit Season to promote that Business, but to suspend the further Prosecution of it until a more favou∣rable Conjuncture. The former Par∣liament being dissolved, it was ne∣cessary another should be call'd, as had been usual at the Entrance of all Sovereigns to the Crown; and therefore her Majesty issued out Writs for the Calling of a new Parliament, which met according to Summons upon the 6th of <HI>May</HI> 1703, to which the Queen was pleas'd to honour the Duke of <HI>Queensberry,</HI> by appoint∣ing his Grace to represent her Royal Person, as Lord High Commissioner. The Parliament being open'd with great Solemnity, they began chear∣fully in passing an Act, recognizing her Majesty's Title to the Crown; but that Unanimity did not long continue among them; for a very strong Party in the Parliament ha∣ving brought in and carried an Act for the Security of the Kingdom, pre∣sented it to the Lord Commissioner, for the Royal Assent; but the <HI>Act of Security</HI> being transmitted to the Court, the <HI>English</HI> Ministry were so wholly averse to it, and the Country Party in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> as strenuously insisting to have it pass, all the Duke could well do in such a Conjuncture, was to keep it off till he should receive Instructions from above; which he did with the out∣most Dexterity, till her Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty ha∣ving declared that some Difficulties having fallen in in that Affair, so much press'd, she would take Time to consider them before she could be determined to give the Royal Ap∣probation; and therefore ordered the Lord High Commissioner to adjourn the Parliament on the 16th of <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> after they had sat full Three Months, which the Lord Chancellor did in the usual Forms.</P>
<P>How great soever these Services of the Duke's were esteemed to be for a Time, yet 'tis certain, that in less than a Year thereafter, upon a Change of some Measures at Court, his Grace was remov'd from all Publick Em∣ployments, except that of one of the Extraordinary Lords of the Session, which was for Life, and of which he could not be deprived.</P>
<P>But upon another Change at Court in the 1705, when the Duke of <HI>Ar∣gyle</HI> was declared Commissioner for holding the Session of Parliament that Year, the Duke of <HI>Queensbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> was made Lord Privy Seal in Place of the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and one of the

'Tis foreign to my Design to assign the Reasons here of the Change that was found in the Disposition of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Ministry, in Reference to the Act of Security, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d passed in the Parliament 1704 from what it had been in the Session before, where∣in the Duke preceded as Lord High Commissioner. However, the fore∣mentioned Act of Security put the <HI>English</HI> Ministry under a Necessity of effecting the Union of the Two Kingdoms; and in order thereto, her Majesty being imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wered by the Par∣liament in 1705. did nominate and appoint Commissioners to treat with those of <HI>England,</HI> for uniting the two Kingdoms, of which Number the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> the Lord Privy Seal was one.</P>

<HEAD>LESLY, Earl of <HI>Rothes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN regard I had not an Opportunity of doing the Justice to this noble Family, by perusing their Writings, as I could have wished, it cannot be reasonably expected, but that my Me∣moirs of the House of <HI>Rothes</HI> should be less connected than others, whose Line and Descent I deduced from the Writings of their own Families; for, tho' one Mr. <HI>Lesly</HI> has set out a Book in <HI>Germany,</HI> of the Name of <HI>Lesly,</HI> he calls <HI>Laurus Leslaeana,</HI> yet in his Ac∣counts of the Families he treats of except <HI>Balquhain,</HI> whose Writs it would appear he had seen and perused the rest, especially <HI>Rothes,</HI> is such a Mass of confused unchronological Stuff, that no Man now a Days, will venture to cite him for an Authority, if he think he himself is to be belie∣ved; and therefore I shall proceed to mention such Writs and Charters, without Respect to the <HI>Laurus Leslae∣ana,</HI> I either observed from our natio∣nal Archives or otherwise, as are pro∣per to illustrate the Honour and An∣tiquity of this most noble Family.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that the first Possessi∣ons of this illustrious Family was in <HI>Aberdeen</HI>-Shire, the Barony of <HI>Lesly</HI> in the <HI>Garrioch;</HI> and from whence, without all doubt, the Sirname has been assumed; for in the Reign of <HI>William the Lyon, David</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntingtoun</HI> and <HI>Garrioch,</HI> the King's Brother, made a Grant, Malcolmo <HI>silio</HI> Bartholf, <HI>de terris suis de</HI> Leslyn, <HI>sicut perambulatae fuerunt ei coram</HI> A. <HI>Episcopo</HI> Aberdeen, <HI>per probis homini∣bus suis, &amp;</HI> Hachengart, <HI>&amp;</HI> Mailiae, <HI>per rectas divisas suas</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Copy of a Charter in the Custody of the Laird of Lesly, which seems to have been taken very exactly from the Original, which was procured me by Sir Samuel Forbes of Foveran: This first is in the Reign of King William.</NOTE>.

one of the Barons in the Letter to the Pope <HI>Anno</HI> 1320, wherein the Inde∣pendency of <HI>Scotland</HI> is very fully as∣serted and vindicated, which is all I have found memorable of him.

<P>Sir <HI>George Lesly</HI> his Son and Heir, who was by King <HI>James</HI> II. in 1449, rais'd to the Dignity of Earl of <HI>Ro∣thes.</HI> He married <HI>Christian,</HI> Daugh∣ter of Sir <HI>Walter Hallyburton</HI> Lord of <HI>Dirletoun</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Charta penes Comitem de Rothes.</NOTE>.

<P>Which <HI>George</HI> being a Nobleman of great Wisdom and Prudence, was much esteemed by King <HI>James</HI> V. who carried him over to <HI>France</HI> in the 1537, when his Majesty was e∣spoused to <HI>Magdalen</HI> a Daughter of that Crown: After whose Death, during the Regency of the Duke of <HI>Chattlerault,</HI> he was sent Ambassador to <HI>Denmark,</HI> in which Negociation he behav'd himself with great Pru∣dence and Dexterity; and being look'd on generally throughout the King∣dom as a very wise Man, he was na∣med one of the Commissioners to go to <HI>France,</HI> to the Queen's Marriage with the Dauphine, where he died at <HI>Deip,</HI> on the 9th of <HI>November</HI> 1558, not without Suspicion of being poi∣soned.</P>
<P>I'm heartily sorry, there are not such Documents in my Hands as should fully enable me to set the Mar∣riages of this noble Earl in a true Light. Mr. <HI>Lesly</HI> gives the Preference to Lady <HI>Margaret Crichton,</HI> as the Earl's first Lawful Wife, tho' I think his Authority is little to be valued; for 'tis clear from a Charter of <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> in the 1528, wherein he gives both <HI>Nicolas Somervel</HI> and <HI>Margaret Crichton</HI> a Liferent out of the same Lands; Mrs. <HI>Somervel</HI> is expresly call'd his Wife, and is first mentioned before the other La∣dy, who is no otherwise designed than by her Name, tho' she was of much greater Quality of Birth than the other: Yet 'tis also clear by ano∣ther Charter, in the 1542, That La∣dy <HI>Margaret Crichton</HI> is designed, <HI>Coun∣tess of Rothes</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub. Arch. ad Annum 1542.</NOTE>, and then is cer∣tainly his lawful Wife. For the clearing this Matter, I shall humbly
<PB N="429" REF="439"/>
offer my Opinion about it, from such Writs, as I have seen relative to it. The Case I take to have been this, The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> in the Heat of Youth, and without a Dispensation, according to the Rites of the Chuch, for the Earl and the Lady were with∣in the forbidden Degrees, did unca∣nonically marry Lady <HI>Mary Crichton,</HI> the Lord <HI>Crichton</HI>'s Daughter, which then in the Construction of the Law, could not be valid without a Dis∣pensation, or the Children conside∣red as begot in lawful Marriage, tho' certainly the Earl thought otherwise himself; for when <HI>Norman</HI> his Son by her, was a very young Man, he put him in Fie of his Estate, and in all the Transactions afterwards about it, upon his Forfaulture, he's never designed the Earl's natural Son, but only his Son simply, and Fiar of the Earldom of <HI>Rothes,</HI></P>
<P>And probably the Earl and the La∣dy disagreeing, they chose to live se∣parate, or she left him, and he mar∣ried again, as was commonly done in that Time, <HI>Nicholas Somervel,</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>John Somervel</HI> of <HI>Camnethan,</HI> and Widow of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Fleming,</HI> by whom he had <HI>Andrew</HI> his Father's Successor in the Estate and Honour; and the Lady dying soon thereafter, the Earl was again reconciled to Lady <HI>Margaret Chrich∣ton,</HI> and legally married her, other∣wise she could not have been, as I observed, she was, designed Countess of <HI>Rothes;</HI> and in this State of law∣ful Marriage, she bare the Earl a Son, <HI>Robert Lesly,</HI> the Founder of the House of <HI>Findrassy;</HI> and from his being Brother to <HI>Norman</HI> the Master of <HI>Rothes,</HI> both of the same Father and Mother, has the Mistake pro∣ceeded, and the Story been patch'd up of his being, as he is call'd, the <HI>righteous Rothes;</HI> for 'tis plain, that <HI>Norman</HI> being forfaulted for the Mur∣der of Cardinal <HI>Beaton,</HI> his Father the Earl redeemed his own Estate again in the Terms he had made it over to him, and so could not but in Justice settle it upon his Son <HI>Andrew,</HI> who being indisputeably born in law∣ful Marriage, was preferable to <HI>Ro∣bert,</HI> who was not born of <HI>Margaret Crichton,</HI> till very long after the Death of Dame <HI>Nicholas Somervel;</HI> for 'tis plain at first the Earl had no other Son by <HI>Margaret Crichton,</HI> but the aforesaid <HI>Norman</HI> Master of <HI>Ro∣thes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andrew</HI> Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> so succeed∣ing, his Father, was very faithful to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> throughout her whole unfortunate Life, and was highly ho∣noured by King <HI>James</HI> as a Noble∣man of great Honour and Probity. He married first <HI>Jean,</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>James Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Evandale,</HI> by whom he had <HI>James</HI> Master of <HI>Ro∣thes,</HI> and <HI>Andrew</HI> Lord <HI>Lindores;</HI> like∣wise Three Daughters, 1 <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to <HI>Archbald</HI> Earl of <HI>Angus,</HI> 2 <HI>Eupham,</HI> to <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Lindsay,</HI> 3 <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>David Weems.</HI> Younger of That-Ilk, and again to <HI>James</HI> first Earl of <HI>Findlater.</HI></P>
<P>He married again <HI>Jean,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Patrick</HI> Lord <HI>Ruthven;</HI> and after that <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Durrie</HI> of That-Ilk, and had <HI>Margaret</HI> married to Sir <HI>William Cunninghame</HI> of <HI>Capring∣toun, Mary</HI> to <HI>Robert</HI> Lord <HI>Melvil,</HI> and <HI>Isobel</HI> to <HI>James</HI> Master of <HI>Sinclair,</HI></P>
<P><HI>James</HI> Master of <HI>Rothes</HI> in the Life∣time of his Father, married first <HI>Mar∣garet,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Patrick</HI> Lord <HI>Lind∣say,</HI> by whom he had Four Daugh∣ters,</P>

<P>His Second Wife was <HI>Catharine,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Patrick</HI> Lord <HI>Drummond,</HI> by whom he had a Son <HI>John,</HI> who
<PB N="430" REF="440"/>
succeeded his Grandfather, and a Daughter <HI>Jean,</HI> married to <HI>Alexan∣der Menzies</HI> of <HI>Weem.</HI></P>
<P>Which <HI>John</HI> being a Nobleman of very good Parts, and great Address, was one of those Peers who were most forward and leading for the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dress of Grievances, when the Troubles first broke out in 1637; and the Earl being the Person of the greatest Parts, Interest, and Expe∣rience, in all the Popular Party, it cannot be denied, but he came to be generally look'd on as the Principal and governing Person of the Nation at that Time; and after the Treaty of <HI>Rippon,</HI> at which he was the first Commissioner, when the Pacification was concluded, his Majesty resolved and actually did adjust all his Busi∣ness with that Party by the Earl, who undertook that <HI>Scotland</HI> should rest satisfied with the Concessions which were in the Treaty; and his Majesty was well satisfied, says my Author<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon's History of the Rebellion.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'with the Promises made to him by the Earl':</Q> And 'tis certain the King expected by his Help and Interest, to have found such a Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as would, he adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'have been more tender of his Honour, than they after expressed themselves; and did alwise impute the Failing there∣of to the Absence of the Earl, who falling sick, at the King's coming down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> within Six Weeks thereafter, died at <HI>London,</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1641',</Q> which his Majesty thought an irreparable Loss to his Service.</P>
<P>He married <HI>Anne,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> by whom he had <HI>John</HI> his Son and Heir, and Two Daughters, <HI>Margaret</HI> married first to <HI>Alexander</HI> Lord <HI>Balgony,</HI> next to <HI>Fran∣cis</HI> Earl of <HI>Buccleugh,</HI> and last of all to <HI>David</HI> Earl of <HI>Weems;</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> to <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Eglingtoun.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was too young to have been concern'd in the War when it first broke out in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. but when the Par∣liament 1651, rais'd an Army for the Service of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. for the Recovery of <HI>England,</HI> the Earl being then of Age, put himself into the Army, and attended the King thither. Upon the Defeat at <HI>Worcester,</HI> he had the Misfortune to fall into the Ene∣mies Hand, who committed him to Prison, where he remained till the King's Restauration, that his Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to reward his Me∣rit and Sufferings, was pleased to make him Lord President of the Council, and thereafter General of the Forces in <HI>Scotland;</HI> he had the Honour also to represent his Majesty's Person, as Lord High Commissioner to the Session of Parliament 1663; and the same Year was constituted Lord High Treasur∣er of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Resignation of the Earl of <HI>Crawfurd;</HI> and the Chancellor's Place falling void by the Death of the Earl of <HI>Glen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airn,</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1664, the Lord Treasurer was not long after prefer'd thereto; and having discharged this and all the other great Offices committed to him, to his Majesty's great Satisfaction, he was graciously pleas'd, in Conside∣ration of all the Lord Chancellor's eminent Services, to create him Duke of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and to the Heirs Male of his Body for ever, the 29th <HI>June</HI> 1680; but his Grace did not long sur∣vive his Promotion, for he died in <HI>July</HI> 1681, the Dignity of Duke by his Death did extinguish with himself, by Reason of his Want of Heirs Male.</P>
<P>He married <HI>Anne,</HI> Daughter of <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Crawfurd,</HI> by whom he had <HI>Margaret</HI> Countess of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> married to <HI>James</HI> Marquis of <HI>Montrose,</HI> and again to Sir <HI>John Bruce</HI> of <HI>Kinross,</HI> Bart.</P>

<P>ALL Antiquaries are agreed, that the most ancient Sirnames are lo¦cal; the Aera we reckon they were first hereditarily affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to Families, at least, with us, was in the Reign of King <HI>David</HI> I. for before that the most eminent Persons, we find, are distinguished either by some personal Appellative, or Patronymically, by the Name of the Father, as is clear from the most ancient Writs that are extant, and of which many Instances could here be given: And that which further confirms this Opinion is, That the very first Sirnames are all taken from Lands, as <HI>Douglass, Hume, Craw∣ford, Cathcart, Dalrymple, &amp;c.</HI> all which have been assumed from their own Lands by the then Proprietars, when hereditary Appellations became cu∣stomary.</P>
<P>The First using this Sirname is <HI>Adam de Dalrymple,</HI> who was posses∣sed of the Barony of <HI>Dalrymple</HI> in <HI>Air</HI>-shire in the Time of King <HI>Alexander</HI> III.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is a Charte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Rolls of King Robert II. the first Year of his Reign, Anno 1371, ratifying a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant which Malcolm filius Gilchrist filius Adae de Dalrymple made of the Half of the Barony of Dalrymple to Sir John Kennedy; and the Granter having then a Son John Dalrymple, who ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Charter about the same Time of the whole <HI>Dominium</HI> de Dalrymple, 'tis no Stretch, but a very modest Computation in Chronology, to place Adam the Great Grandfather as high as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lexander the III's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me.</NOTE>. <HI>Adam</HI> was succeeded by <HI>Gil∣christ</HI> his Son, and he again by <HI>Mal∣colm</HI> his Son, from whom sprang <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Roland de Dalrymples,</HI> who had the Barony of <HI>Dalrymple</HI> divided betwixt them, which their Heirs made over to Sir <HI>John Kennedy</HI> in the 1378.</P>
<P>Altho' the <HI>Dalrymples</HI> ceased to possess their old original Estate of <HI>Dalrymple;</HI> yet some of them continued to make a very considerable Figure. <HI>Jacobus de Dalrymple</HI> was <HI>Clericus R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gis</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Robert</HI> III.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub.

<P>This excellent Person was born in <HI>May</HI> 1619<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub. Arch.</NOTE>, his Father dying when he was very young: He was by the sin∣gular Care and Affection of his Mo∣ther, well brought up, and at a pro∣per Age having been taught his Hu∣manity at the best Schools in the Coun∣try, was sent to the University of <HI>Glas∣gow,</HI> where, having run through his Course of Philosophy with great Ap∣plication and Success, he took the De∣gree of Master of Arts in the 1637. The Civil War breaking out soon thereafter, Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> betook him¦self to the Service of the Parliament, and had a Company of Foot bestow'd on him in the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI>'s Re∣giment. While he was a Captain, upon the earnest Sollicitation of some of the Professors of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> upon the falling vacant of a Philosophy Chair in that University, he was prevail'd on to stand a Candidate at a comparative Trial for the Post, to which he was preferred with great Applause; and he successfully perform'd that Pro∣vence for some Time, and bred several Schollars, who prov'd afterward very eminent both in Church and State. While Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> continued in this Station, he studied the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> with the History and Antiquities of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> the better to qualifie him for the Study of the Civil Law, to which he betook himself, and wherein he made a very eminent Progress.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> being esteemed a Man of great Parts and good Address, was employ'd by the University to sollicite Grants for the Increase of their Revenues and other Affairs, which led him to see the Form of Proceedings in the Courts of Justice, and brought him to be known and acquainted with the great Men who were then at the Head of Affairs, and the most eminent Law∣yers both on the Bench and at the Bar. At length in the Beginning of the 1648, Mr, <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> with these use∣ful Preparations and Advantages, en∣tred an Advocate, and in short Time Time became very eminent in his Profession, for his Abilities and Re∣putation for Judgment and Integrity; in so much as when the Parliament 1649. proclaimed King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and named certain Commissioners to go over to <HI>Breda</HI> to treat with him about his coming to the Exercise of his Royal Power, Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> was pitch'd on to be Secretary to the Committee, whereby he had an Opportunity to be known to the King and the great Men about the Court, who were very well pleased with the Abilities, Sincerity, and Moderation he shew'd in the whole of his Demeanour on that cri∣tical Occasion, for which the King did ever afterward esteem him, and was pleased to express himself very obligingly of him, even at the Time when he was prevail'd on by his Mi∣nisters to remove him from the Presi∣dent-ship

of the Session, as being in no Degree a Friend to the Designs then on Foot: And I cannot but remark, that tho' Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> was then but a young Lawyer; yet he was so well esteem'd for his Knowledge in the Laws, that the Parliament in his Ab∣sence, while he was in <HI>Holland.</HI> nam'd him one of the Commissioners to re∣vise the Laws, Acts of Parliament, and Practice of the several Judicatures; but what Advances they made in that Matter is to me unknown.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> return'd with the Commissioners before the King in the 1650, and so soon as his Majesty ar∣rived, he waited on him at his first Landing, and was very well receiv'd; and thereafter in the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of Affairs he used his outmost Endeavours, and did all he could to unite all Parties for his Majesty's Service, especially in the grand Affair of raising an Army to in∣vade <HI>England,</HI> upon which all the Hope, of his Restauration depended.</P>
<P>After the Defeat of the Royal Party at <HI>Worcester,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> continued his Practice in the Law during the U su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pation, till the Oath called the <HI>Ten∣der,</HI> abjuring the Royal Family of the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts,</HI> was imposed, that he and most of the eminent Men of that Profession withdrew from the Bar, till <HI>Cromwel</HI> thought fit by some Act of Connivance to dispense with it; and a Correspon∣dence being made up betwixt the Bench and the Bar, we find Mr. <HI>Dal∣rymple</HI> was one of the Four deputed by the Faculty of Advocates to declare to the Judges, <HI>That it was their Opinion, That for the better Administration of Justice, to restore the ancient Form of the Outer-House, which had been supprest,</HI> and which they accordingly thought fit to comply with.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> still increasing in Re∣putation and Practice, he was upon the Death of Judge <HI>Learmont</HI> of <HI>Bal∣comy,</HI> pitch'd on by General <HI>Monk,</HI> with Consent of the Protector's Council, to be his Successor, and the Choice pro∣ceeded merely upon the Fame of his Abilities and Integrity; and he was far from seeking after the Employ∣ment, he having no Inclination to have any Office under that Administration; but there being such an universal De∣sire of the People, that the Post should be fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led with a <HI>Scotsman,</HI> and a Person eminent for Integrity and Knowledge of the Laws, and being importun'd from People of all Ranks and Perswa∣sions, he was at last perswaded to ac∣cept of the Place, and so he suffered himself to be made one of the Judges, without any other Compliance with the then prevailing Powers, than tak∣ing the Oath <HI>de fideli Administratione,</HI> as the Act of his <HI>Admission</HI> bears, <HI>July</HI> 1st. 1657. While this worthy Judge continued in this Station, he took all Opportunities that offered to serve his Country, and to do all the good Offices he could for his Friends with those in Power, in getting Grievances redressed, which, as it mightily in∣creased his Reputation, and very much recommended him to Men of all De∣grees, so it brought him into a particu∣lar Acquaintance with General <HI>Monk,</HI> who had a great Esteem and Value for him; insomuch as the Day be∣fore he marched with his Army to <HI>England,</HI> he reposed so much Consi∣dence in Judge <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> as a very wise Man, and of an excellent Under∣standing, that he call'd him to a pri∣vate Conference, and desired he would give his Opinion freely, what he thought was the likeliest Way to set∣tle the Three Nations? To which he readily answered, <HI>That the wisest and fairest Way was to procure a free and full Parliament to be called;</HI> and at the same Time he very earnestly recommended to the General, to interpose at <HI>London</HI> for setting the Courts of Justice a go∣ing, which were then stopped by rea∣son of the Disorder and Discompo∣sures of the Times; which Counsel the General followed, as appears from his Letter to Judge <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> dated
<PB N="455" REF="465"/>
from <HI>Dunstable</HI> the 7th Day of <HI>Janu¦ary</HI> 1659.</P>
<P>Upon the Restauration Mr. <HI>Dal∣rymple</HI> went up with the Earl of <HI>Cassils</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> to pay his Duty to the King, and congratulate his Majesties happy Restauration; and the King, the first Time Mr. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> waited on him, was graciously pleased, as a Mark of his Favour, to make him a Knight; and as a further Testimony of the Trust and Confidence he repo∣sed in him, named him one of the Se∣nators of the College of Justice at the first Settlement of that Judicature in the Year 1661, and in <HI>November</HI> there∣after, the Lord President Sir <HI>John Gil¦moir</HI> being call'd up to <HI>London,</HI> the Lords applied to the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> his Majesty's Commissioner, to name a President in the Absence of the President; and his Grace was pleased to name the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> to be Vice-President: And I cannot fail to re∣mark, that the Lords themselves had such an Esteem for the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> that they ever choos'd him Vice-President, as often as Sir <HI>John Gilmoir</HI>'s Health, or other Occasions hinder'd him to be present, except once when he was at <HI>London</HI> in the Winter-Session 1670, as one of the Commissioners for the Treaty that was then set on Foot be∣twixt the Two Nations.</P>
<P>The Parliament 1663 having ap∣pointed an Oath to be taken, called, <HI>The Declaration,</HI> by which all who were in Publick Offices, were oblig'd to declare against defensive Arms, and the Conduct of the late Troubles, par∣ticularly against the National Cove∣nant, as explain'd in the Year 1638, and the Solemn League and Covenant entred into betwixt the Two Nations in 1643, as contrary to the Fundamen∣tal Laws and Liberties of the King∣dom: This caused no small Uneasi∣ness to the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> some Things being in the Oath disagreeable to his Principles, and withal being absent in the Country at his Mother's Funeral-Obsequies, when the rest of the Lords subscribed the Declaration, they ac∣quainted him, <HI>That the King in his Let∣ter to the Privy Council, had ordered the Places of such of the Lords as did not sign the Declaration by a precise Day, should be declared Void, and that no written Explanation or Declaration should be admitted, which would look like the stating of a Party.</HI> To which the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> return'd Answer, excusing his not Compliance; for that he had sent his Demission to the King before the Date of the Letter: Whereupon the Lords declared his Place vacant on the 19th of <HI>January</HI> 1664.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Stair</HI> being thus at Liber∣ty, took a Tour into <HI>France</HI> with <HI>John</HI> his eldest Son, who then about Sixteen Years of Age began to travel for his Improvement; and my Lord <HI>Stair</HI> returning by the Way of <HI>London,</HI> and having had the Honour to wait on the King, his Majesty was pleased to tell him that he would not accept of his Demission, and allow'd him to clear or explain his Mind, in what Sense he would take the Declaration; and accordingly his Lordship having sa∣tisfied his Majesty, the King by a Let∣ter to the Lords, signified, <HI>That bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g well satisfied with Sir</HI> James Dalrymple <HI>of</HI> Stair, <HI>one of their Number, his clear∣ing himself in the Matter of the Decla∣ration, and of his Affection to his Service, and of his great Abilities to serve in that Station; therefore it was his Pleasure, that the Lord</HI> Stair <HI>signing the Decla∣ration, continue in his Place as if the Demission had never been made.</HI> Upon Receipt of the Letter, and Sir <HI>James</HI>'s signing the Declaration, the Lords rescinded their former Act declaring his Place void, and he took his Place on the Bench again at the sitting down of the Summer-Session 1664. About this Time his Majesty, as a further Mark of his Royal Favour to the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> was pleased to create him a Knight Baronet, and to the Heirs Male of his Body for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="466"/>
In the 1670, when a Treaty was set on Foot for uniting the Two King∣doms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> was named one of the Com∣missioners for that important Affair; and tho the Treaty did not take Effect, yet the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> in the several Dis∣courses that passed on that Subject, gave such clear Proofs of his great Knowledge in our Constitution and the Laws, that the next ensuing Year Sir <HI>John Gilmoir</HI> Lord President re∣signing his Office, his Majesty was pleased to confer it upon him, and his Promotion was not attended with any Envy or Dislike, so far as I have ever heard.</P>
<P>As my Lord <HI>Stair</HI> was a great Lover of his Country, and had the true Inte∣rest of it always very much at Heart, so he embraced every Opportunity to promote and advance the Good of the Nation; for it was the Lord Pre∣sident, and several other Patriots, who concur'd with him, who represented to the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> upon his coming down in the 1677, several A∣buses and illegal Practices that had been committed; and the Duke there∣upon was pleased to get several Acts of Council made correctory of these Abuses, particularly that of citing Persons for Church-Irregularities, without libelling special Circumstan∣ces of Time and Place, which was very ill taken, and highly resented by the Archbishop of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> and several of his High-flying Brethren.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Stair</HI> did with the same Fidelity labour to disswade the Duke from bringing in the <HI>Highland</HI> Host upon the West, and from obtaining an Order of Council for a Bond to be taken for discovering, apprehending, and bringing to Judgment, <HI>Presbyteri∣an</HI> Ministers who held Conventicles: But tho' he did not prevail in this Point, yet the Lord President could never be induc'd either to subscribe the Bond, or approve the <HI>Highland</HI> In∣road, for Reasons founded both in Law and Religion.</P>
<P>When his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>Albany</HI> came down to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the End of the 1679, the Lords of the Ses∣sion and other Members of the Col∣lege of Justice thought it their Duty to wait on his Highness at the <HI>Abbay</HI> of <HI>Holy-rood-house,</HI> when the Lord President made a fine congratulatory Speech in the Name of the Society, wherein among other Expressions he had one to this Effect, <HI>That it was a Matter of great Joy to the Nation to see one of the Royal Family among them, af∣ter being for so many Years depriv'd of that Honour; and the Nation being in∣tirely Protestant, it was the fittest Place his Highness could make his Recess to at that Time.</HI> His Lordship did after∣ward, with a becoming Freedom and the ourmost Fidelity, disswade his Highness not to attempt any Thing that might seem to have the least Ten∣dency to weaken the Establishment of the reform'd Religion, as it was secur'd by the Laws. In the Parliament 1681, to which his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>Albany</HI> was his Majesty's High Com∣missioner, the Lord President was chosen a Member for the Shire of <HI>Wigtoun.</HI> In the Beginning of the Session, his Lordship, the Earl of <HI>Ar∣gile,</HI> and several others, were named on a Committee of the Articles for Religion, which by the Custom of all <HI>Scots</HI> Parliaments was the first Thing treated of: Accordingly the Com∣mittee did prepare an Act securing the Protestant Religion; which Act did ratifie the Act approving the Con∣fession of Faith, and also the Act con∣taining the Coronation Oath appoin∣ted by several standing Laws and Acts of Parliament, to be taken by our Kings before their Entry to the Exer∣cise of the Government: But this Draught which the Committee had prepar'd was laid aside, in respect it was thought to limit too much the Power of a Popish Successor to the Crown; in Place whereof a general Statute did pass, ratifying all former Laws for settling and securing the
<PB N="457" REF="467"/>
Liberty and Freedom of the Prote∣stant Religion. However, when the Act <HI>asserting the Right of Succession to the Crown, according to the Proximity of Blood, without Respect to any Difference in Religion,</HI> did pass, it was thought expedient, even by those who promo∣ted it, to have a more special Law made for Security of the Protestant Religion: Accordingly a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aught of the Act about Religion was transmit∣ted to the Parliament, which provided only for the Preservation of the Prote∣stant Religion, as contained in the Word of GOD, which could not disco∣ver Papists, who pretend to walk con∣form to that Rule. The Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and other Pa∣triots were forward to have a particu∣lar Standard of the Protestant Religi∣on established, that might more effe∣ctually prevent <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> get∣ting into Publick Offices, in the Event of a Popish Prince upon the Throne; and the Lord President urged the Mat∣ter with so much Strength of Rea∣son, that the first Clause in the <HI>Test</HI> which was agreed to, did exclude all Persons from Publick Trust in the Go∣vernment, who did not swear, <HI>That they own'd and sincerely professed the true Protestant Religion, contain'd in the Con∣fession of Faith, recorded in the Parliament</HI> 1567; <HI>and that they believed the same to be founded on and agreeable to the written Word of GOD; and that they should adhere thereunto all the Days of their Lifetime, and educate their Chil∣dren therein, and that they should never consent to any Change or Alteration con∣trary thereunto.</HI> Tho' the Act passed, yet the urging of that Clause by the Lord President was highly re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented by his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>Alba∣ny</HI> the Lord High Commissioner, who the very Night the Act passed, said to some about him, and in his nearest Confidence, <HI>That the Lord</HI> Stair, by bringing in the Confession of Faith in∣to the <HI>Test, had ruined all honest Men,</HI> meaning <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the Lord President was plea∣sed with the first Part of the Test-Act, which seem'd to be a very effectual Security against Popery; yet he could not sign the latter Part of it, which struck against <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Dissenters, therein call'd <HI>Fanaticks;</HI> and therefore he went up to the King to declare so much, and to desire his Majesty's Leave to retire, and to lay down his Employment; but before he arrived at <HI>London,</HI> his Behaviour in the Parlia∣ment was improv'd as so heavy a Charge against him at Court, that he was remov'd from his Office in the Session, without mentioning of any Cause, tho' he held his Place in the ordinary Way of Judges, <HI>ad vitam aut culpam.</HI> But his Remove from his Place was not all he was like to suffer; for after that he was not allowed to live without Disturbance in his Re∣tirement at his Seat in the Country; for his Tenents were harassed with grievous Fynes for Non-conformity; and he got a Hint from his Friend Sir <HI>George Mackenzie</HI> the Lord Advocate; that he could not secure him, that he might not be thrown in Prison. My Lord <HI>Stair</HI> finding himself in these Cir∣cumstances, thought it safer for him to retire, and to go into a voluntary Exile into <HI>Holland</HI> in the End of 1682, where he printed his <HI>Philosophia nova Experimentalis,</HI> which, as it gain'd him great Reputation with the Learned, so 'tis generally read with great Ap∣plause.</P>
<P>While the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> was abroad, many Witnesses were examined and re-examined, not only his own Dome∣sticks, but some of his nearest Relati∣ons, to find out Matter for a Crimi∣nal Pursuit against him; but nothing was discovered, save that some Persons suspected to have been engaged in the Rebellion 1679 liv'd upon his Ground, or lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked about his House in the Coun∣try, while he attended on the Session at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> However he was pur∣sued for Treason, first before the Justi∣ciary,
<PB N="458" REF="468"/>
and then before the Parliament, upon the common Ground of Harbour and Reset of Rebels: But the Proba∣tion was so scrimp, that by their own Rules they could not condemn him; for he was a wise Man, and had taken Care to live with all possible Circum∣spection and Caution.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Stair</HI> sojourn'd in <HI>Holland</HI> till the 1688, he came over with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in his Expedition to <HI>Britain,</HI> to relieve these Nations from Popery and Arbitrary Power; in which glorious Design no Man en∣gaged more frankly than the old Lord <HI>Stair:</HI> And when the Prince was just setting Sail for <HI>England,</HI> 'tis reported his Lordship took the Freedom to ask his Highness, <HI>What his true Design was in going to</HI> England? To which the Prince was pleased to answer, <HI>That he designed the Glory of GOD, and the Security of the Protestant Religion:</HI> Up∣on which, 'tis said, the Lord <HI>Stair</HI> pul∣led off his Wig, and said, <HI>Tho' I be now in the</HI> 70<HI>th Year of mine Age, I'm willing to venture that,</HI> meaning his Head, <HI>and his own and his Childrens Fortunes in such an Undertaking.</HI> This the Prince took in very good Part, and reported it to others, as that which very much en∣couraged him to prosecute his Design.</P>
<P>When the Prince landed at <HI>Torby,</HI> his Highness expressed a particular Concern about the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> and sent to enquire concerning his Health, and understanding his Horses were not come up, the Prince sent him Horses of his for his Accomodation.</P>
<P>Upon the Advancement of the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> to the Throne, their Majesties, who had a very great Kindness and Esteem for the Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> as a Person of great In∣tegrity, and of unquestionable Zeal for the Protestant Religion, were pleased to restore him to his Office of Presi∣dent of the Session in the 1689, con∣form to the <HI>Claim of Right:</HI> But their Majesties thought this Piece of Justice was not enough to reward the Lord <HI>Stair</HI>'s great Merit; wherefore they were further pleased to raise him to the Peerage, by the Stile and Title of Viscount of <HI>Stair,</HI> by Letters Patent bearing Date 20th <HI>April</HI> 1690, after which his Lordship continued with∣out the least Interruption in the favour of his Prince, and enjoyed his Office, which he had discharged in all Times, with great Abilities and sin∣gular Integrity till his Death, which happened on the 25th of <HI>November</HI> 1695, aged 76, and was with great Funeral Solemnity interred in the Ca∣thedral Church of St. <HI>Giles.</HI></P>

<P>Tho' Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> was very much frown'd on at this Time by the Court, he would by no Means forego his Principles, tho' his Wisdom and Experience put him upon acting cir∣cumspectly, and with great Caution, during the Remainder of King <HI>Charles</HI> his Reign: But after King <HI>James</HI>'s co∣ming to the Crown, that Prince, upon his own Observation of Sir <HI>John Dal∣rymple</HI>'s Abilities in his Pleadings as a Lawyer, was pleased to conceive a ve∣ry good Opinion of him; insomuch as he was pleased to make him Lord Ad∣vocate, upon the Removal of Sir <HI>George Mackenzie,</HI> who was laid aside in the 1686, for not complying with the Design of the Court, in taking a∣way the penal Laws against Popery; tho' it could never be said by Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI>'s greatest Enemies, that he had in any Degree contributed there∣to; but on the contrary endeavour'd all he could to animate the Members of Parliament to stand firm to their Religion, and not to open a Door to let in Popery and many other Inconve∣niencies. Sir <HI>John</HI> behav'd with great Moderation and Temper while he held that Office; but Sir <HI>George Mac∣kenzie</HI> having found Means to recon∣cile himself to the Court, he was resto∣red to be Advocate, and Sir <HI>John Dal∣rymple</HI> was thereupon made Justice-Clerk, upon a Vacancy thro' the De∣mise of Sir <HI>James Foulis</HI> of <HI>Colingtoun,</HI> and he continued in the Office till the Government was disso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v'd by King <HI>James</HI>'s leaving <HI>England,</HI> and retiring to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> being a very zea∣lous Protestant, all the Favours he had confer'd on him by King <HI>James</HI> and others, he might have expected were no Temptations to bring him into the Court-Measures at that Time; and the Revolution coming about, he fell heartily in with it, and with those who were the most zealous Promoters of it.</P>
<P>In the Convention of Estates 1689, Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> shewed himself a steady Asserter of the Religion and Liberties of his Country, and particu∣larly expressed on that Occasion a hear∣ty Desire, that a Treaty might be set on Foot for a nearer Union of the Two Nations: But that Design meeting with Opposition from Persons of very different Principles, it was dropt at that Time; and when the grand Affair of settling the Crown came to be de∣bated, the Estates found at first great Difficulty how to declare the Throne vacant; at length Sir <HI>John Dalrymple</HI> ended the Debate by such Reasons, that the Convention went into his Proposals, and settled the Crown up∣on the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange.</HI> So soon as it passed into an Act, he was one of the Commissioners sent up from the Convention with the Offer of the Crown to the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> with the Nations Grievances and Claim of Right, which their High∣nesses having accepted of, they were graciously pleased to reward Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Merit and Zeal shown for their Ad∣vancement to the Throne, by making him Lord Advocate in 1690, and in less than a Year thereafter he was con∣stituted one of the Principal Secretaries of State; and he discharged the Office with eminent Sufficiency, till the 1695, that the Parliament having made some Attempts against him a∣bout the Affair of the horrid Massacre of <HI>Glenco,</HI> he resigned his Place, mere∣ly that the King might not be made uneasie by his continuing in so emi∣nent a Post so near his Royal Person, tho' his Majesty did highly resent the Treatment the Secretary had met with, and turn'd all those out of his
<PB N="461" REF="471"/>
Service, who had been the greatest Sticklers against him.</P>
<P>Tho' the Master of <HI>Stair</HI> did not think he had been well used, yet he never shewed the least Resentment a∣gainst the Court; but on the contrary by his great Wisdom and Temper in∣terposed to moderate the Heats and Animosities which arose both in the Parliament and in the Country, upon the Disappointments of <HI>Darien;</HI> and the Figure he made in the publick De∣bates by his Speeches in Parliament were sufficient to convince every Body that he might have been employed a∣gain in some of the highest Offices of State, but he constantly declin'd Pre∣ferment; for he was resolv'd never to be further concern'd in publick Affairs, than as a Privy Councellour; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et at the same Time, not to omit what he really thought his Duty to his Coun∣try upon any Occasion.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Anne</HI> came to the Crown, the Viscount of <HI>Stair</HI> was na∣med on of the Lords of the Privy Council; and as a further Testimony of her Majesties Favour, was raised to the Honour of Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> by Let∣ters Patent the 8th of <HI>April</HI> 1703<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.

<P>The Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> had from his Youth entertained an Opinion, That an intire Union of both Kingdoms was the most likely Way to procure the lasting Tranquillity and Happi∣ness of <HI>Britain,</HI> and for that End very readily concurred in the Session of Parliament 1702, that Power should be given to the Queen to name Com∣missioners to treat of an Union; pur∣suant to which, Commissioners were n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Majesty, of which Number the Earl himself was one: But that Treaty breaking off without coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o any Conclusion, it had no other Effect than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o let bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Nations s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s practicable; and it being ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in resumed in the 1705, by new Authority from the Parliament of both Kingdoms, his Lordship was by her Majesty named one of the Com∣missioners upon the Part of <HI>Scotland;</HI> in the carrying on of which he had so considerable a Share, both in the Time of the Treaty, and in the Parli∣ament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that many have thought that without the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> it could not have been brought to a Conclusion, considering the many Difficulties were raised against it, all which he just liv'd to see overcome; for being exceedingly sollicitous to have the Union perfected, he assisted the Day before his Death at the De∣bates on that Subject in the Parlia∣ment, pressing the Point with great Earnestness: And tho he walked home, and dined very chearfully with Company, yet about Four next Mor∣ning he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll into an Apoplexy, which in a few Hours put an End to his Days, the 8th of <HI>January</HI> 1707, aged 59.</P>
<P>He married <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>John Dundas</HI> of <HI>New-Liston,</HI> by whom he had <HI>John</HI> the present Earl, of <HI>Stair</HI> Colonel <HI>William Dalrymple</HI> of <HI>Glenmure, George Dalrymple</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Barons of Exchequer; also a Daughter, <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Loudoun.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> was born at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 20th of <HI>July</HI> 1673. He gave very early Marks of a lively and great Genius, having suc∣ceeded beyond his Fellows in his first Studies of Latin and Greek, both at home and in <HI>Holland,</HI> whether, at the Desire of his Grandfather then at <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den,</HI> our young Student was sent, when he was about Eleven Years old. In a very few Months he acquired the Habit of speaking <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> in both which he has been since improved to a Degree of Per∣fection, to which seldom any Stranger has attained. His Masters at <HI>Leyden</HI> were exceedingly pleased with him, and remaked, that though he seem'd fond of Play, and solicited his Fel∣lows to it, yet he was never found
<PB N="462" REF="472"/>
out of his Place at School: But while he seemed thus devoted to his Play, he advanc'd in his Learning as if he had minded nothing else: He was pro∣moted from Class to Class, with the Approbation of the Magistrates, Pro∣fessors and Masters of the School at <HI>Leyden,</HI> and had one of the first <HI>Prae∣miums</HI> at every Promotion, accord∣ing to the Custom of that School, for distinguishing the Merit of the best Scholars, and for exciting in them a greater Desire of going for∣ward.</P>
<P>After the Earl had made a good Progress in the Schools there, he returned to his Father in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in the University of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> pur∣sued the Study of the Greek and La∣tin, adding the Study of the Logicks and other Parts of Philosophy, under Mr. <HI>Kennedy,</HI> then Regent in that University. He studied the Ma∣thematicks under the learned and very justly celebrated Doctor <HI>David Gre∣gory,</HI> then Professor at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Savilian</HI> Professor at <HI>Ox∣ford.</HI> The Earl had also the Assistance of Mr. <HI>Gregory</HI> the present Professor of the Mathematicks at <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> And he had the constant Hap∣piness to be the Favourite of his Masters, and to be much beloved by his follow Students.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1688 he went again to <HI>Holland</HI> to visit his Grandfather and Grandmother, to whom he was very dear, and return∣ed in <HI>October</HI> that Year to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to reassume his Studies in the Uni∣versity, but the Commotions that happened at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> interrupted the stated Course of every Thing till the Revolution was com∣pleted, and the Government esta∣blished in the Person of King <HI>Wil∣liam.</HI> In the Beginning of the Year 1689 he went with his Father to <HI>London.</HI> From this Time forward the present Earl, then Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> begun to ply the Study of the living Languages, as well as that of the dead, and to improve himself in these Kinds of Exercises that belong to a young Gentleman, still with the same Constancy and good Effect.</P>
<P>He returned again to <HI>Scotland</HI> with his Father, and saw the Meeting of the Estates, and the two first Sessions of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> under King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the Year 1689 and 1690.</P>
<P>His Father being made Secre∣tary of State in the Beginning of the Year 1691, his Son, the present Earl, had the Advantage to be much at Court, which was a new Kind of Education, that added both Orna∣ment and useful Improvement to those he had acquired before: And when his Father followed the King to <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Earl went along. In the Summer he was in the Camp, and was present at the Battle of <HI>Steen∣kirk,</HI> where the brave Earl of <HI>Angus</HI> was kill'd on the Head of his Regi∣ment, with whom the present Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> advanced to the Enemy as a Volunteer.</P>
<P>In the Winter the Earl returned once more to his Studies at <HI>Leyden,</HI> heard the famous Professors there read on <HI>Grotius</HI> and the Institutions of the Civil Law, and had at the same Time Colleges of History, imploying every Minute to the best Advantage.</P>
<P>After these Foundations laid, there remained nothing more to fit the Earl for Business but travelling to see how Men of different Tempers and Religions lived among them∣selves and other Men, and to learn from the first Hand the Genius, Man∣ners, Constitutions and Languages of some of the most considerable Nati∣ons in <HI>Europe.</HI> He set out with the Lord <HI>Lexington,</HI> who went in the Year 1700 to <HI>Vienna</HI> Ambassador. The Earl having been some Time at that Court went on to <HI>Italy,</HI> visiting
<PB N="*462" REF="473"/>
on his Way the several great Cities, Republicks and Courts in <HI>Italy.</HI> At <HI>Rome</HI> he applied himself to the Know∣lege of Antiquities, Architecture, and other Things which are taught there, studying with much Application the <HI>Italian</HI> Language; and because he could not then go into <HI>France,</HI> during the War then between King <HI>William</HI> and that Crown, he studied the <HI>French</HI> very carefully by the Help of a <HI>French Abbé,</HI> whom he found at <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might enter deeper into the Strength, Genius and Beauties of that Language so universally in Use.</P>
<P>Having made the Tour of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> he returned to <HI>England</HI> in the 1701, and that Year came to <HI>Scot∣land</HI> with his Father, where he conti∣nued until the 1702, at which Time there being new Regiments to be rais∣ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he went to Court, to offer his Service upon the Appearance of an approaching War. The King re∣ceived him very graciously, but a Scheme of Officers was formed for these Regiments leaving him out. His Majesty having observed it, told, that he was resolved to provide for Mr. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> who by that Scheme was neglected, and for that Reason his Majesty resolved to make him Se∣cond Lieutenant Colonel of his Regi∣ment of Foot Guards in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But King <HI>William</HI>'s Death happening just then, his Commission as Second Lieu∣tenant Colonel of the Regiment of Foot Guards was signed by Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> on one of the first Days of her Reign.</P>
<P>Being now in the Army (where his Inclination had ever led him to serve) he embraced the first Opportunities to appear in that Way, which soon hap∣pened: For the late Queen being en∣gaged with the Confederates in the Second War against <HI>France,</HI> and hav∣ing sent over an Army under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Marlbo∣rough,</HI> the Earl made the very first Campaign as a Volunteer, and di∣stinguished himself in the Actions of greatest Hazard and Consequence, as at the taking of <HI>Venlo</HI> and <HI>Liege,</HI> and at the Cannonade of <HI>Peer.</HI> He was also im∣ployed by the Duke as his <HI>Aidde Camp.</HI> It was in this Campaign that he laid the Foundation of that Friendship with which that great General has constant∣ly honoured him since.</P>
<P>The Account of the Earl from that Period is so interwoven with the great Events Civil and Military, that have happen'd, that tho all the Materials for going thro' with a just and exact Hi∣story were at Hand, yet the Nature of this Undertaking would not admit of pursuing it, or the Share he had in these great Actions; which besides has been remarkable enough by many very considerable Circumstances well known. I have therefore contented my self in a plain Way, and without enlarging on Particulars, to set forth what concerns his Youth and Educa∣tion, which has been one constant Series of Application to those Things which might fit him for the eminent Station where he is now placed.</P>
<P>I shall therefore finish what con∣cerns him with the bare Enumeration of the Employments he has gone through.</P>
<P>He had a Commission as Colonel of Foot in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service in <HI>April</HI> 1703; in the Year 1705 he succeed∣ed Brigadeer General <HI>Fergusson</HI> deceast, in a Regiment of Foot on the <HI>English</HI> Establishment; and after the Death of Lord <HI>John Hay,</HI> he had the Com∣mand given him of the Royal <HI>Scots</HI> Dragoons, by the Name of the <HI>Royal Greys,</HI> by a Commission bearing Date the 24th <HI>August</HI> 1706, which he con∣tinued to command till the last Year of the late Queen, when he was or∣dered to sell it to the Earl of <HI>Portmore.</HI></P>
<P>He commanded a Brigade of Foot at the Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> and was immediately after that Battle made
<PB N="**462" REF="474"/>
Brigadeer. His Commission bears Date from the Day of that Battle. He was Brigadeer in the Battle of <HI>Audenard,</HI> and carried the News of the Victory into <HI>England;</HI> he com∣marded as Major-General at the Bat∣tle of <HI>Tanier</HI> near <HI>Mons;</HI> and was made Lieutenant-General at the Siege of <HI>Deway</HI></P>
<P>He was sent Envoy Extraordinary to the King of <HI>Poland</HI> in the Winter of the Year 1709, where he re∣sided till <HI>May</HI> 1710, that he returned to the Siege of <HI>Doway,</HI> and having left his Secretary in <HI>Poland,</HI> continu∣ed in that Character till the Year 1711, that Mr. <HI>Scot</HI> was sent to that Court.</P>
<P>Since King <HI>George</HI>'s Accession to the Crown, the Earl has been made Lord of the Bedchamber; one of His Majesty's most honourable Privy-Council in the 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4; and in <HI>January</HI> thereafter he was sent Envoy Extraor∣dinary to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> but at the same time he had Powers and Cre∣dentials to treat as Ambassador and Plenipotentiary, and when his Lord∣ship should judge it necessary, to as∣sume that Character.</P>
<P>His Lordship married the Lady <HI>Eleanor Campbell,</HI> Daughter of <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Loudoun,</HI> Widow of <HI>James</HI> Viscount of <HI>Primerose;</HI> but as yet hath not any Issue.</P>

After his Return he betook himself to the Court, where he liv'd in great Reputation, under no other Character than a Gen∣tleman of the most polite Parts and

Learning. Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> having an Inclination and a Talent from his Youth to Poetry, he declined all other Business, and delivered himself up in¦tirely to his own Genius, in which he made a wonderful Proficiency in the Study of the ancient Poets, by whom he form'd an excellent <HI>Goust</HI> of Poetry; insomuch as in a short Time he came to be looked on as one of the most e∣minent of that Profession. K. <HI>James</HI> who then reigned, was a Prince of great Learning and Knowledge, and delighted much in the Conversation of learned Men, particularly Mr. <HI>Ale∣xander,</HI> who presented him with seve∣ral elegant Poems to the King's great Delight, and the gaining the Applause of Persons of the first Rank for Quality and Wit to himself, to whom in a short Time he grew very acceptable. After he had lived some Years about the Court, his Majesty, who looked on him as a wise Man, was pleased to prefer him to be Master of Requests, and a Knight in 1614: But his Majesty's Bounty did not rest in the conferring one single Favour on him; for Sir <HI>William</HI> being a learned and projecting Man, and having settled a Colony in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> in <HI>America</HI> upon his own Charges, King <HI>James</HI> made him a Grant of it by his Royal Deed on the 21. of <HI>September</HI> 1621, and did intend to erect the Order of Baronet for encou∣raging and advancing so good a Work: But the Two or Three last Years of that Prince's Reign having been less pleasant to him, by the Jealousies which about that Time began in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> he thought fit to suspend the fur∣ther Prosecution of that Affair until a more favourable Conjuncture, which he lived not to see. But King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who with his Father's other Virtues, inherited his Affection to his native Kingdom, immediately upon his co∣ming to the Crown, proposed nothing more than the furthering of that De∣sign, which was projected to be of so great a Benefit to the Nation, and therefore made Sir <HI>William Alexander</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>New Scotland,</HI> and insti∣tuted the Order of Knight-Baronet for the encouraging and advancing of that Colony, and gave him the Privi∣lege of coining small Copper-Money, a Gift which was inveighed against, even at that Time, with great Bitter∣ness: But his Majesty, who thought that too great Encouragement could not be given to learned and worthy Men, such as Sir <HI>William</HI> was, and being fully satisfied of his great Abili∣ties and Integrity, was graciously plea∣sed in 1626 to make him Secretary of State, in place of the Earl of <HI>Hadding∣toun,</HI> and a Peer, by the Title of Vis∣count <HI>Stirling</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Pub.

<P>THE First who laid the Founda∣tion of this Honour was Lieute∣nant General <HI>William Drummond,</HI> a younger Brother of the Lord <HI>Maderty</HI>'s, who from his Youth having dedicated himself to the Profession of Arms, he entred into the Service of his own Prince King <HI>Charles</HI> I. after the break∣ing out of the Civil War, and had a considerable Command in the Army that was raised in the 1648, for the Relief of his Majesty, while he was a Prisoner in the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> After that unfortunate Expedition he trans∣ported himself into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and join'd the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> who was then in Arms for the King, and continued in that Service till the 1651, he came over to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had the Com∣mand of a Regiment in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army at the Battle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> where he was taken Prisoner; but afterward making his Escape, he went into the <HI>Highlands</HI> in that Adventure where <HI>Middleton</HI> commanded; at which Time he had a Commission to be a Major General. When that Design was broke, and no further Hope left of serving the King, he went abroad, and entred into the Service of the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> under whom he exercised very high Commands, and with great Honour and Reputation, till after the Restauration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. that his Majesty call'd him home, and made him Major General of the Forces in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and in that Caracter he serv'd the Crown for many Years thereafter. Upon King <HI>James</HI>'s coming to the Throne, he was made General of all the Forces in the Kingdom, and one of the Lords of the Treasury, and a Peer by the Title of Viscount of <HI>Strath∣allan,</HI> by Letters Patent 16th <HI>August</HI> 1686<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Cancellaria S.

<P><HI>John</HI> his Son, who being a Noble∣man of great Parts and Learning, was preferred to be Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> in 1575, upon the Demise of the Earl of <HI>Argyle;</HI> and he held the Office till he was killed by a Pistol∣shot in a Tumult on the Street of <HI>Siirling, March</HI> 7th 1577. The King sustained a wonderful Loss in his Death, he being a Man of great Wis∣dom and Temper, and one very uni∣versally lov'd and esteem'd. Bishop <HI>Spot swood</HI> speaking of that dismal Ac∣cident, says, <HI>The Death of the Chancellor was much lamented, falling out in the Time when the King and Country stood in most Need of his Service: He had carried himself with much Commendation in his Place, and acquired a great Autho∣rity. Most careful was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to have Peace conserv'd both in the Country and Church, and labour'd much to have the Question of Church-Policy settled; upon which Sub∣ject he interchanged divers Letters with</HI> Theodore Beza, a learned foreign Di∣vine.

<HEAD>SUTHERLAND, Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a particular History written of this noble ancient Fa∣mily in <HI>English,</HI> by a very able Pen, the Learned Sir <HI>Robert Gordon</HI> of <HI>Gor∣donstoun,</HI> Baronet; and very accurate∣ly epitomiz'd by Mr. <HI>Ross,</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI> the Author of the <HI>Pansebeia;</HI> where∣in both Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ross</HI> have been at much Pains to vouch the Anti∣quity, and illustrate the Descent of the Earls of <HI>Sutherlands,</HI> and they have done it so well, and instructed it so clear, that the Peerage of this illu∣strious Family is not only one of the oldest with us in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but for what I know of any other Nation of <HI>Europe.</HI> And I can't but remark, that our Historians do make mention, that the Family of <HI>Sutherland</HI> were Thanes before the Title of Earl was introdu∣ced among us; for not only Sir <HI>Ro∣bert Gordon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ross,</HI> but even our publick National Historians do take Notice, That <HI>Allan</HI> Thane of <HI>Suther∣land,</HI> a brave and warlike Man, gave a very signal Defeat to a Detachment of the <HI>Danish</HI> Army who invaded the Country of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and that he was cruelly put to Death and murde∣red under the Usurpation of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> for his firm Adherence to his right∣ful Sovereign King <HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> King <HI>Duncan</HI>'s Son, and for endea∣vouring to set him on his Father's Throne; and when in Providence that was happily brought about, that heroick and generous Prince thought it but just to restore the Children of such who had been forfeited on his Account during the Usurpation; and therefore, <HI>Walter,</HI> the Son of <HI>Allan</HI> Thane of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> in Memory of his Father's Merit, as well as his own signal Services in contributing toward
<PB N="472" REF="484"/>
the Restoration, was not only resto∣red to his Estate and Honour, but was likewise one of those whom that King further dignify'd with the then introduc'd Title of Earl 1057<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Gordon, Buchanan, and Hume.</NOTE>, and dying 1097, was succeeded by,</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> his Son and Heir who built the Castle of <HI>Dunrobin,</HI> which he cal∣led after his own Name, which is still the principal Seat of this noble Fami∣ly. This Earl was imployed to ap∣prehend <HI>Harold</HI> Earl of <HI>Caithness,</HI> who had committed a very horrible and barbarous Murder upon the Bi∣shop of <HI>Caithness,</HI> whom he brought to exemplary Justice. He was suc∣cceeded by,</P>
<P><HI>Hugh</HI> his Son, call'd for Distin∣ction <HI>Hugh Friskin,</HI> i. e. <HI>Hugh with the ready Whinger,</HI> because he was a bold daring Man. He attack'd the <HI>Danes</HI> when they invaded his Coun∣try, whom he de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat in Battle at <HI>Embo</HI> in <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and slew their General.</P>
<P>To <HI>Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> suc∣ceeded <HI>William</HI> his Son, who died 1248, and was succeeded by</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> his Son who in the Reign of King <HI>Alexander</HI> II. enter'd into a solemn Agreement with <HI>Archibald</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Caithness,</HI> wherein both Parties narrate, That there had been a long Dispute and Controver∣sy <HI>inter venerabiles Patres Predecesso∣res nostros,</HI> Gilbertum, Willielmum, <HI>&amp;</HI> Walterum, <HI>bonae memoriae, Episco∣pos</HI> Cathaniae, <HI>ex una parte, &amp; nobiles viros</HI> Willielmum <HI>clarae memoriae, &amp;</HI> Willielmum <HI>ejus filium, Comites Su∣therlandiae,</HI> relative to the Lands of <HI>Skilbo, Pronsie, Therbolt,</HI> and Others claimed by the Chapter of that See, which after a long Dispute was amica∣bly composed by a solemn Agreement, dated <HI>decimo Kalendarum Octobris</HI> 1275<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gordon.</NOTE>. This Earl the younger made a very great Figure in the Reign of <HI>A∣lexander</HI> III. in the 1284, he is one of the <HI>Magnates Scotiae,</HI> who solemn∣ly bound themselves with their Oaths and Seals, That in Default of Male Issue of the King's Body, to acknow∣ledge and receive <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Erick</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> King <HI>Ale∣xander</HI>'s Grandchild by his Daughter, as their Sovereign and Queen of <HI>Scot∣land</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer.</NOTE>. And when the Succession did take Place in the Person of that young Princess, thro' the Demise of her Grandfather, this noble Earl was one of the Peers who addressed King <HI>Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> That a Treaty of Marriage might be set on Foot be∣twixt his Son the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and the young Queen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where∣by the Two Kingdoms might be for ever unite under one Sovereign; but the Death of the young Princess fal∣ling out soon thereafter, the Treaty which was concluded, had no Effect. When the Competition happened a∣bout the Succession to the Crown be∣twixt <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> and <HI>John Baliol,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> was one of those great Men who were appointed to go to <HI>Berwick</HI> to hear King <HI>Edward</HI>'s De∣cision of that grand Affair; the De∣termination of which had been refer∣red to him. Upon the breaking out of the War thereafter, he was firm to that Side which did most regard the Honour, Interest, and Independency of his Country, and was very assist∣ant in bringing King <HI>Robert the Bruce</HI> to, and maintaing him on the Throne. He did in a very eminent Manner sig∣nalize his Valour and Courage at the famous Battle of <HI>Banno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kburn,</HI> where∣by the Slavery and Usurpation under which <HI>Scotland</HI> had long groand, was gloriously redem'd and retriev'd. The same Earl is one of the Peers, who, with other great Men of the King∣dom, wrote that memorable Letter to the Pope in 1320, to which all of them put their Seals; a rare Piece of Antiquity. The learned Mr. <HI>Ander∣son</HI> has with great Exactness and Cu∣riosity caused finely engrave it on Cop∣per-Plate in his elaborate Treatise, <HI>De Rebus Diplomaticis Scotiae,</HI> colle∣cted and published by him at the Command of the Parliament of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>

<P>To <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> suc∣ceeded <HI>Kenneth</HI> his Son, who was very faithful to King <HI>David Bruce,</HI> as his Father had been to King <HI>Robert,</HI> in whose Service, and in that of his Country (for they were inseparable) he lost his Life fighting gallantly at the Battle of <HI>Halidon-hill,</HI> where he commanded the Van of the Army, on the 19th of <HI>July</HI> 1333 (<HI>c</HI>), leaving Issue, <HI>William</HI> his Son and Heir, and <HI>Nicol,</HI> of whom the <HI>Sutherlands</HI> of the Family of <HI>Duffus</HI> are derived.</P>
<P>Which <HI>William</HI> was one of those valiant and loyal Peers who accom∣panied King <HI>David</HI> to the Battle of <HI>Durham Anno</HI> 1346, and was taken Prisoner with him. After the Earl's Releasment he was one of the <HI>Scots</HI> Plenipotentiaries, authoriz'd to treat with the <HI>English</HI> anent the Redem∣ption of the King; and when that Treaty prov'd successful, <HI>Alexander</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI>'s Son and Heir was sent to <HI>England</HI> one of the Ho∣stages for the Ransom, and how soon the King took Journey for his own Dominions, he was met and attend∣ed by certain of the Nobility with a great Retinue, of which Number this noble Earl, who had the Honour to be his Brother-in-law, was one. He married the Lady <HI>Margaret Bruce,</HI> Daughter of King <HI>Robert</HI> I. and Si∣ster of the full Blood to King <HI>David</HI> the II. from whom he obtained a very noble Charter, on the 10th of <HI>November</HI> 1347, to himself and his Wife the Lady <HI>Margaret</HI> the King's Sister, which is still preserved in the Annals of this illustrious Family, as well as our national Records, <HI>Willi∣elmo Comiti de Sutherland, &amp; Marga∣ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sponsae suae, carissimae sorori nostrae, quod ipsi &amp; haeredes legi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imae inter ipsos procreand, habeant, tenean. &amp; possideant totum Comitatum</HI> Sutherlandiae, <HI>in li∣beram Regalitatem in perpetuum.</HI> By the Lady <HI>Margaret Bruce</HI> aforesaid his Wife, he had <HI>Alexander</HI> his his eldest Son, who died in <HI>England</HI> one of the Hostages for the Ransom of the King his Uncle, in the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etime of his Fa∣ther, and <HI>John,</HI> called <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn out of Time</HI> by the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> his Succes∣sor in the Earldom.

<P>Which <HI>John</HI> being a Person of great Parts, and of an excellent Understan∣ding, was elected Knight of the Shire to the Parliament 1621<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sir James Dalrymple's Cambden, Edit, 1694.</NOTE>, for the County of <HI>Twedale,</HI> where his Parts were quickly taken Notice of, and having behav'd himself very well in all Things relating to the Crown, his Majesty King <HI>James</HI> VI. was pleased to call him to his Council, and to confer the Honour of Knighthood on him.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> I. soon after his com∣ing to the Crown, contracted an ex∣traordinary Opinion of Sir <HI>John Stew∣art,</HI> as a Man w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll versed in all Parts of Learning, and of great Experience in Affairs, insomuch as he pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred him to the Honour of the Peerage, 19th of <HI>April</HI> 1628<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Charta in Cancellaria S. D. N.

<PB N="482" REF="494"/>
to the King as fittest to be trusted, not only in the Admini∣stration of Civil Affairs, in which in∣deed it cannot be denied but he had great Experience; but also in the con∣ferring of Ecclesiastical Preferments, in which he was not always very fortunate.</P>
<P>When King <HI>Charles</HI> made a Journey into his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be there crown'd, the Lord <HI>Traquair</HI> at¦tended on his Majesty throughout that whole Progress, and at the Solem∣nity of the Coronation was raised to the Honour of Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> by Letters Patent bearing Date at <HI>Holy∣roodhouse, June</HI> 22. 1633<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charta in Cancellaria S. D. N. R.</NOTE>, and growing every Day more in Credit with the King, and in Favour with Dr. <HI>Laud,</HI> who by this Time was be∣come Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> his Majesty was pleased to make him Lord High-Treasurer of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the 1635, upon the Surrender of that Office by the Earl of <HI>Mortoun.</HI> The Earl being thus invested in the great∣est Office of Benefit in the Kingdom, and his Majesty believing he had pro∣vided a strong Support to his Govern∣ment both in Church and State, and having exceedingly set his Heart up∣on the uniting of his Three Kingdoms in one Form of GOD's Worship, and publick Devotions, by a publick Li∣turgy, he committed intirely the bring∣ing about of that Business, so far as related to the Civil Part of it, to the Lord Treasurer; and tho' his Lord∣ship was very well affected to the Work in Hand, in his own Judgment, yet he did not think the Season was ripe for it's being published, when it was by the King's Proclamation ap∣pointed to be first read at <HI>Easter</HI> 1637; and therefore the Lord Treasurer per∣swaded his Majesty to defer it for a Time, till some good Preparation might be made for the more favoura∣ble Reception of it: And as this Pause gave the discontented Party more Time for their Negotiations, so the Consequence of it made him suspected to be secretly an Enemy to the Litur∣gy and the Bishops. Of this the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> clears him, and says, <HI>That there was never any Ground, either then, or in all the after Part of his Life, for that Suspicion; but that if the Lord Trea∣surer had been as much depended upon to advise the Bishops in the Prosecution of the Liturgy, and for the Conduct of it, as he was to assist them in the carrying on whatsoever they proposed, it is very proba∣ble either so much would not have been undertaken together, or that it would have succeeded better.</HI> But whatever Suspi∣cion some of the Bishops might enter∣tain of the Lord Treasurer's not being devoted to some of them, 'tis certain the King had no Jealousie of the Earl, as if he had been in any Degree corru∣pted or disaffected to the Government as it was establish'd by Law; insomuch as when his Majesty was pleased in the 1639. to call a Parliament and an Assembly of the Clergy, in order to appease the Commotions, and to ex∣tinguish the Fire that the Endeavour of bringing in the Liturgy and the Book of Canons had kindled, he pitch'd on the Lord Treasurer, whom he knew to be as wise a Man as the Nation then had, and very equal to the Work to re∣present his Royal Person, both in the Parliament and the Assembly; in that great and difficult Trust he acquitted himself to his Majesty's great Satisfa∣ction, and did with the outmost Vi∣gour and Fidelity assert the Royal Pre∣rogative, as established by Law or ancient Custom; and when he thought that was invaded either in the Parlia∣ment, or in the Assembly of the Church, he opposed it with all his Power, and gave them all the Trouble he could.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="495"/>
As the faithful Discharge of his great Trust did very much establish and confirm the Treasurer in his Ma∣jesty's good Opinion, so it drew upon him the implacable Resentment of the other Party, who pursued him with so extraordinary Animosity, that in the next Parliament of 1641, they prevail∣ed with his Majesty to take the White-Staff from him, and impeach'd him of High Treason, of which they likewise found him guilty; but having refer'd his Punishment to the King, his Maje∣sty was so far from conceiving the Earl had merited such a severe Prosecution, that he gave Orders, that in all Events a Pardon might be prepared under the Great Seal<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Remission I have seen and perused in the Hands of the Earl of Traquair.</NOTE>, wherein his Majesty does not only very fully absolve him from the Crimes objected against him in the Impeachment, but annexes to the Remission an ample Testimony of his great Abilities and singular Inte∣grity in the Discharge of all the great Employments he had been intrusted with under the Crown:</P>
<P>But this Testimony of the King's gracious Affection to the Earl did him very little Service; for during the Civil War, by Virtue of the Judg∣ments that had formerly passed on him, his Estate was sequestrated and taken from him; and for the greater Security of his Person, he was forced to flee out of the Country; and tho' they allowed him to return Home, and live at his own House, yet he con∣tinued under Restraint till the 1647, that he was enlarged and suffered to sit in the Parliament, where he endea∣voured all he could to bring the Na∣tion to a thorough Engagement to re∣deem and relieve the King, who was then a Prisoner in the Isle of <HI>Wight;</HI> and the Parliament having raised an Army, the Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> upon his own Charges levied a Regiment of Horse, and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Head of them to the Battle of <HI>Prestoun,</HI> where both his Lordship and the Lord <HI>Linton</HI> his Son were taken Prisoners, and by Order of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament sent to <HI>Warwick</HI> Castle, where the old Earl continued for the Space of Four Years; and tho' he was set at Liberty, yet the Sequestration of his Estate was conti∣nued: Nor did the Malice of the U∣surpers abate toward him, till they had reduced him to the lowest Penury and Want that can be imagined, and in that disconsolate low Condition of Fortune he spent the after Part of his Life, till the End of <HI>September Anno</HI> 1659, Death put an End to his Days.</P>
<P>This noble Lord married <HI>Katharine</HI> Daughter of <HI>David</HI> the first Earl of <HI>Southesk,</HI> by whom he had <HI>Charles</HI> his Son and Heir, and Four Daughters.</P>

<P>Which <HI>Charles</HI> did likewise during the Civil War adhere to the Royal Interest with very signal Fidelity; for albeit all the Pressures his Father lay under, yet he still preserv'd a very good Reputation and a very great Interest in his Country, as appeared by the Supplies he brought to the King's Ar∣my at <HI>Philiphaugh,</HI> many Gentlemen of <HI>Twedale</HI>-shire engaging themselves in the Service, out of their personal Affe∣ction to him, as well as Conscience of the Cause: And tho' he surviv'd those Times of Usurpation and Anarchy, and saw the King restor'd, yet it can∣not be denied he was not recompen∣sed according to his Merit, or conside∣red

'Tis plain Sir <HI>Malcolm Fleming</HI> liv'd retir'd, and did not meddle in any Faction during the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. pro¦bably he was disgusted with the Treatment the Duke of <HI>Albany</HI>'s Fa∣mily had met with, yet he stuck close to his Friends the <HI>Douglasses,</HI> which cost him dear, for he was, together with the Earl of <HI>Douglass</HI> and his younger Brother, by the Contrivance of the Lord <HI>Crichton</HI> the Chancellor, all Three executed on the Mote of the Castle-Hill of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the 20th of <HI>November</HI> 1441<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Charta pe∣nes Comitem de Wigtoun.</NOTE>.

<P>Which <HI>Robert</HI> soon after the Death of his Father took Instruments, that the Sentence pronounced against him was unwarrantable and illegal, in Regard he had not that Time allow∣ed him for clearing himself that the Law allows the greatest Criminal<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>; and protested that it should not be prejudicial to him; likeas there was another Instrument taken by Sir <HI>Alexander Livingston</HI> of <HI>Calendar,</HI> who was in the Ministry, in Presence of the Bishops of <HI>St. Andrews, Glasgow, Dunkeld,</HI> and <HI>Dunblain,</HI> and of the Earl of <HI>Douglass</HI> Justice-General be∣south the River of <HI>Forth,</HI> whereby he declared upon Oath, That he had given no Counsel, Assistance or Con∣sent to the Death and Slaughter of Sir <HI>Malcolm Fleming</HI> this Lord's Father.</P>
<P>Moreover, it would appear, that when King <HI>James</HI> II. himself came to Age, he was so much satisfied with the Injustice Sir <HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lm Fleming</HI> had met with, that he gave Order to di∣rect Precepts to the Sheriffs of the se∣veral Counties where Sir <HI>Robert Fle∣ming</HI>'s Estate lay, to inseft him as Heir to his Father, who by several In∣quests of Persons of great Honour, is found and declared to have died at the Faith and Peace of his Sovereign Lord King <HI>James</HI> II. then reigning<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>, notwithstanding of his preten∣ded Forfaulture.</P>
<P>But it seems the King did not think the Justice of restoring Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> enough to attone for the Sufferings of his Father, wherefore he was graci∣ously pleased to raise and establish him in the Rank of those Barons who were henceforth fixed heredetary Peers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibidem. ad Annum 1465.</NOTE>.
