<HEAD>THE DRAMATIC PUFFERS,</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE. The Stage.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter ZEPHYR and BREEZE, meeting.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY this light but it is—What! Bill Breeze!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my gentle Zephyr! <STAGE>(shaking hands)</STAGE> Why, where have you hid yourself?—But I beg par∣don—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I make no secret of my situations; I've been obliged to lodge for a few weeks on the other side of the water; it was forcibly recom∣mended to me by a doctor well skilled in con∣sumptive cases. <STAGE>(quaintly.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you find yourself the better for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazingly; for I've now got rid of all those lurking symptoms which are the too frequent at∣tendants on genius, and letters.—So, I find they have had some flogging work over both courses in my absence: the different studs have been run hard, eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hard?—<HI>puff'd</HI> all round;—scarce a leg to stand on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the knowing ones have been taken in, you touch'd a little, Breeze, I hope!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a ducat!—No, Zephyr, all my prospects fell with the <HI>coalition;</HI>—at the beginning of the season, indeed, I offered my services <HI>here;</HI>—but I was delicately told—that authors now-a-days took upon themselves the disagreeable task of <HI>criticizing</HI> their own pieces; and at as to the ordinary business of the theatre, a gentleman of established reputa∣tion had undertaken to do the whole upon a standing contract!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; I suppose I should have met with similar neglect on the other side of the way, if it had not been for my new invented play-house machine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Play-house machine! a kind of theatrical <HI>Buza∣glo,</HI> I suppose, occasionally to keep the house warm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Conceitedly,)</STAGE> Oh, no! you'll never guess it;—will you promise me the most profound secrecy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Pon my honour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Half whispering)</STAGE> Why, then, you must know I call it (and I think rather aptly)—I call it—an <HI>Applauder!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Applauder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an <HI>Applauder;</HI> a mechanical improvement on the vulgar art of manucussion; by which one man, with the simple winch of a barrel-organ, shall give a more mark'd and judicious applause, than can possibly be derived from any stationary band of hireling clappers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad that <HI>is</HI> a happy invention!—but pray, Zephyr, wont it tend in some measure to counteract the <HI>real</HI> plaudits of an impartial audience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, quite the contrary; for as clapping, like gaping, is nothing more than an involuntary accordance of mus∣cular motion, I will engage, my dear Breeze,—barring rheumatic and gouty cases,—to carry every hand on any particular occasion, in unison with my Applauder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very capital idea upon my soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, I don't see why the benefit of it may not be extended to the performers; then you know the actors and actresses of a certain <HI>natural diffidence,</HI> need not so often be laid up, by the chilling damps of <HI>silent</HI> admiration!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly my dear friend.—But when will it come out Zephyr?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Almost immediately; the first essay was to have been made on a late <HI>musical occasion;</HI> but the author and composer, not being able to settle which of the parts deserved the "<HI>most decisive bursts</HI> of <HI>universal applause,</HI>" the machine was laid by, and the matter left as usual to the decision of hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you are come here, I suppose to offer it also to this House?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, I have convey'd away the <HI>copy-right;</HI> and the managers of both Theatres are now contending for an exclusive patent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Do you do any thing in the <HI>parlia∣tary</HI> way now, Zephyr?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a <HI>metaphor!</HI> that branch fell to nothing when gentlemen first submitted to the fatigue of carrying their <HI>own</HI> FLOWERS to <HI>market!</HI>—No, having a little
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
leisure upon my hands, the prompter said he would recommend me as diurnal colourist to the young author of this night's piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's droll enough! why, I am waiting here myself in hopes of procuring a similar employ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! why, then, if that's the case, suppose we conduct the matter jointly, and share the profits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart:—so, if you'll undertake to waft him through the pacific ocean of the mi∣ninisterial prints, I'll engage—but soft; here, I fancy, comes the young author;—and a <HI>martial</HI> one I see by his appearance.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter AUTHOR, in an officer's uniform, <HI>(looking round.)</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's strange I should never be able to catch those scene-painting gentry!—<HI>Wild</HI> said they would meet me here at half past five; <STAGE>(looking at his watch)</STAGE>
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
I fear we shall not arrange the scene for the last act before the piece begins— <STAGE>(they advance)</STAGE> Oh, gentlemen, I'm glad we've met at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wild, Sir, I take it for granted—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but he says we've not a moment to lose!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, I thought you'd be in a hurry, so we took care to be prepared.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad of it; and how do you intend—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, as it's a first attempt, and times are ticklish, I don't think it adviseable to give any thing too highly colour'd at present, and therefore I have sketch'd something in the oblique way, which I con∣ceive however will have a fine effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; in the <HI>side wing</HI> way; but in that case how shall we display the performers to ad∣vantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear Sir, never fear them; they are able, and willing enough to take care of themselves!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, for my part, I think there is nothing like a good bold outline at once, to take in the <HI>flats.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well gentlemen, I'm indifferent whether the scene be a <HI>flat,</HI> or an <HI>oblique</HI> one, provided its effect be strik∣ingly convey'd to the galleries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, lud Sir, make yourself perfectly easy on that score;—my designs <STAGE>(pulling out his papers)</STAGE> are cal∣culated for all classes; <STAGE>(gives him one)</STAGE> there Sir, just run your eye over that; I think that will reach the <HI>Gods,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI>'s in it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Reads)</STAGE> "A new constellation of resplendent brilliancy, illumin'd the theatrical hemisphere last night; the dramatic magi"— <STAGE>(in amazement)</STAGE> What am I to understand by this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Giving one of his papers)</STAGE> Probably, Sir, you'll like that better, from the delicacy of the <HI>keeping.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Reads)</STAGE> "The genius of comedy perhaps never was so illustriously display'd"—Why, what the devil is all this, gentlemen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud, Sir, don't you know? why, <HI>puffs</HI> to be sure;—puffs, and as good as any <HI>home made ones</HI>—that you'll find in the circle of your dramatic friends, depend on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Puffs?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>puffs,</HI> Sir: an airy insinuating kind of sys∣tem, which, though generally despis'd, is more ge∣nerally practis'd; that has the address to baffle the whole <HI>five senses,</HI> and carry all its points in spite of conviction!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! is that the case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, Sir:—it's what may be emphatically termed the <HI>foil-stone of fame;</HI> which, like the mock jewel of the stage, never fails to out-glare the mo∣dest sparkling diamond!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, gentlemen, to whom am I indebted for these singular obligations?—Your name, if you please?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name! Breeze, Sir; I'm not asham'd of my name. <STAGE>(pertly)</STAGE>—Billy Breeze, No. 300, at the <HI>brass knocker, Air</HI>-street, Piccadilly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your's, worthy Sir?</P>

<P>And are not you, Messrs. Zephyr and Breeze, a co∣genial couple of pitiful parasites?</P>

<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fly hence, ye rascally retailers of ill founded repu∣tation! and by that means save your bones:—how∣however humble my genius may prove, know, that it scorns to soar upon the wretched pinion of Grub∣street Prostitution!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, This is no place, Sir—no place—but we'll find one, depend on't—</P>
