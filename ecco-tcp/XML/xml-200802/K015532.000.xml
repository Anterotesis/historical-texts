<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAving recommended this Play to the Town, and delivered the Copy of it to the Bookseller, I think my self oblig'd to give some Account of it.</P>
<P>It had been some Years in the Hands of the Author, and falling under my Perusal, I thought so well of it that I persuaded him to make a few Additions and Alterations to it, and let it appear upon the Stage. I own I was very highly pleased with it, and lik'd it the better, for the want of those studyed Similes and Repartees, which we, who have writ before him, have thrown into our Plays, to indulge and gain upon a false Taste that has prevailed for many Years in the <HI>British</HI> Theatre. I believe the Au∣thor would have fallen into this Way a little more than he has, had he, before the writing of it, been often present at Theatrical Representations, and observ'd the Effect that such Ornaments generally have upon the Town. I was confirmed in my Thoughts of the Play, by the Opi∣nion of better Judges to whom it was Communicated, who observed that the Scenes were written very much after <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Manner, and that an easie and natural Vein of Humour ran through the whole.</P>
<P>I do not question but the Reader will discover this, and see many Beauties that escape the Audience; the Tou∣ches
<PB REF="5"/>
being too delicate for every Taste in a Popular As∣sembly. My Brother-Sharers were of Opinion, at the first reading of it, that it was like a Picture in which the Strokes were not strong enough to appear with Advan∣tage at a Distance. As it is not in the common way of Writing, the Approbation was at first Doubtful, but has risen every time it has been Acted, and has given an Opportunity in several of its Parts for as just and good Action as I ever saw on the Stage.</P>
<P>The Reader will consider that I speak here as the Pa∣tentee, for which Reason I forbear being more particular in the Character of this Play, least I should appear like one, who cries up the Wares of his own Shop to draw in Customers.</P>

<LG>
<L>IN this Grave Age, when Comedies are few,</L>
<L>We crave your Patronage for one that's New;</L>
<L>Tho' 'twere poor Stuff, yet bid the Author fair,</L>
<L>And let the Scarceness recommend the Ware.</L>
<L>Long have your Ears been fill'd with Tragick Parts,</L>
<L>Blood and Blank-Verse have harden'd all your Hearts;</L>
<L>If e'er you smile, 'tis at some Party-Stroaks,</L>
<L><HI>Round-heads</HI> and <HI>Wooden-shooes</HI> are standing Jokes;</L>
<L>The same Conceit gives Claps and Hisses Birth,</L>
<L>You're grown such Politicians in your Mirth!</L>
<L>For once we try (tho' 'tis, I own, unsafe)</L>
<L>To please you All, and make both Parties laugh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author, anxious for his Fame to Night,</L>
<L>And bashful in his First Attempt to write,</L>
<L>Lies cautiously obscure and unreveal'd,</L>
<L>Like Ancient Actors in a Masque conceal'd.</L>
<L>Cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, when no Man knows who writes the Play,</L>
<L>Were much good Malice merely thrown away.</L>
<L>The mighty Criticks will not blast, for Shame,</L>
<L>A raw young Thing, who dares not tell his Name:</L>
<L>Good-natur'd Judges will th' unknown defend,</L>
<L>And fear to blame, least they shou'd hurt a Friend:</L>
<L>Each Wit may praise it, for his own dear Sake,</L>
<L>And hint He writ it, if the Thing shou'd take.</L>
<L>But, if you're rough, and use him like a Dog,</L>
<L>Depend upon it—He'll remain Incog.</L>
<L>If you shou'd hiss, he swears He'll hiss as high,</L>
<L>And, like a Culprit, joyn the Hue-and-Cry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Cruel Men are still averse to spare</L>
<L>These Scenes, they fly for Refuge to the Fair.</L>
<L>Tho' with a Ghost our Comedy be heighten'd,</L>
<L>Ladies upon my Word you shan't be frighten'd;</L>
<L>O, 'tis a Ghost that scorns to be uncivil,</L>
<L>A well-spread, lusty, Jointure-hunting Devil;</L>
<L>An Am'rous Ghost, that's faithful, fond and true,</L>
<L>Made up of Flesh and Blood—as much as you.</L>
<L>Then every Evening come in Flocks, undaunted;</L>
<L>We never think this House is too much Haunted.</L>

<HEAD>ACT I. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A Great Hall.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter the <HI>Butler, Coachman,</HI> and <HI>Gardiner.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE came another Coach to Town last Night, that brought a Gentleman to enquire about this strange Noise, we hear in the House. This Spirit will bring a power of Custom to the <HI>George</HI>—If so be he continues his Pranks, I design to sell a Pot of Ale, and set up the Sign of the Drum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll give Madam warning, that's flat—I've always liv'd in Sober Families. I'll not disparage my self to be a Servant in a House that is haunted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll e'en marry <HI>Nell,</HI> and rent a bit of Ground of my own, if both of you leave Madam; not but that Madam's a very good Woman—if Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> did not spoil her—come, here's her Health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a very hard thing to be a Butler in a House, that is disturb'd. He made such a Racket in the Cellar last Night, that I'm afraid he'll sower all the Beer in my Barrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, <HI>John,</HI> we ought to take it off as fast as we can. Here's to you—He rattled so loud under the Tiles last Night, that I verily thought the House wou'd have fallen over our Heads. I durst not go up into the Cock-Loft this Morning, if I had not got one of the Maids to go along with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I heard him in one of my Bed-Posts—I marvel, <HI>John,</HI> how he gets into the House when all the Gates are shut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look ye <HI>Peter,</HI> your Spirit will creep you into an Augre-Hole:—he'll whisk ye through a Key-Hole, without so much as justling against one of the Wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Madam is mainly frighted that's certain, and ve∣rily believes 'tis my Master that was kill'd in the last Campaign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of all manner of Question, <HI>Robin,</HI> 'tis Sir <HI>George.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> is of Opinion it can be none but his Honour; he always lov'd the Wars, and you know was mightily pleas'd from a Child with the Musick of a Drum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder his Body was never found after the Battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Found! Why, ye Fool, is not his Body here about the House? Dost thou think he can beat his Drum without Hands and Arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis Master as sure as I stand here alive, and I verily believe I saw him last Night in the Town-Close.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! how did he appear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like a White-Horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, <HI>Robin,</HI> I tell ye he has never appear'd yet but in the Shape of the Sound of a Drum,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>This makes one almost afraid of one's own Shadow. As I was walking from the Stable t'other Night without my Lan∣thorn, I fell a-cross a Beam, that lay in my way, and Faith my Heart was in my Mouth—I thought I had stumbled over a Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou might'st as well have stumbled over a Straw; why, a Spirit is such a little little Thing, that I have heard a Man, who was a great Scholar, say, that he'll dance ye a <HI>Lancashire</HI> Horn-Pipe upon the point of a Needle—As I sat in the Pantry last Night counting my Spoons, the Candle methought burnt blue, and the spay'd Bitch look'd as if she saw something.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay poor Cur, she's almost frighten'd out of her Wits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay I warrant ye, she hears him many a time and often when we don't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lady must have him Laid, that's certain, whatever it cost her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, when one goes to Market, one might hear of some body that can make a Spell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why may not the Parson of our Parish lay him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no, our Parson cannot lay him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not he as well as another Man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ye Fool, he is not qualified—He has not taken the Oaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, d'ye think <HI>John,</HI> that the Spirit wou'd take the Law of him?—faith, I cou'd tell you one way to drive him off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you immediately <STAGE>[drinks]</STAGE>—I fancy Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> might Scold him out of the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, she has a Tongue that would drown his Drum, if any thing cou'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pugh, this is all froth! you understand nothing of the Matter—the next time it makes a Noise, I tell you what ought to be done,—I wou'd have the Steward speak Latin to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that wou'd do, if the Steward had but Courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you have it—He's a fearful Man. If I had as much Learning as he, and I met the Ghost, I'd tell him his own! but alack what can one of us poor Men do with a Spirit, that can neither Write nor Read?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art always cracking and boasting, <HI>Peter,</HI> thou dost not know what Mischief it might do thee, if such a silly Dog as thee should offer to speak to it. For ought I know, he might flea thee alive, and make Parchment of thy Skin to cover his Drum with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Fidlestick! tell not me—I fear nothing; not I! I never did harm in my Life, I never committed Murder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>I verily believe thee, keep thy Temper, <HI>Peter</HI>; after Supper we'll drink each of us a double Mug, and then let come what will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's well said <HI>John,</HI> an honest Man that is not quite sober, has nothing to fear—Here's to ye—why how if he shou'd come this Minute, here wou'd I stand. Ha! what Noise is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But. &amp; Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil! the Devil! Oh no, 'tis Mrs. <HI>Abigal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay faith! 'tis she; 'tis Mrs. <HI>Abigal!</HI> a good Mistake! 'tis Mrs. <HI>Abigal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Abigal.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here are your drunken Sots for you! Is this a time to be guz∣ling, when Gentry are come to the House! why don't You lay your Cloth? How come You out of the Stables? Why are not You at work in your Garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yonder's the fine <HI>Londoner</HI> and Madam fetching a walk together, and me-thought they look'd as if they should say they had rather have my Room than my Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so forsooth being all three met-together, we are doing our Endeavours to drink this same Drummer out of our Heads.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>For you must know, Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> we are all of Opinion that one can't be a Match for him, unless one be as Drunk as a Drum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am resolved to give Madam Warning to hire herself another Coachman; for I came to serve my Master, d'ye see, while he was alive, but do suppose that he has no further occasion for a Coach, now he Walks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> I must needs say, that this same Spirit is a very odd sort of a Body, after all, to fright Madam and his old Servants at this rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>And truly, Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> I must needs say, I serv'd my my Master contentedly, while he was living; but I will serve no Man living (that is, no Man that is not living) without double Wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, 'tis such Cowards as you that go about with Idle Sto∣ries, to disgrace the House, and bring so many Strangers about it; you first frighten your selves, and then your Neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frighten'd! I scorn your Words. Frighten'd quoth-a!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you Sot! are you grown Pot-valiant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frighten'd with a Drum! that's a good one! it will do us no harm, I'll answer for it. It will bring no Blood-shed along with it, take my Word. It sounds as like a Train-Band Drum as ever I heard in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, <HI>Peter,</HI> don't be so presumptuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, these drunken Rogues take it as I cou'd wish. <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scorn to be frightned, now I am in for't; if old <HI>Dub-a-dub</HI> shou'd come into the Room, I wou'd take him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee hold thy Tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would take him—</P>
<STAGE>[The Drum beats, the <HI>Gard.</HI> endea∣vours to get off, and falls.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But. &amp; Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak to it, Mrs. <HI>Abigal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare my Life, and take all I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make off, make off, good Butler, and let us go hide our selves in the Cellar.</P>
<STAGE>[They all run off.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Abigal</HI> Sola.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, now the Coast is clear, I may venture to call out my Drummer.—But first let me shut the Door, lest we be sur∣priz'd. Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI>! <STAGE>[He beats.]</STAGE> Nay, nay, pray come out, the Enemy's fled—I must speak with you im∣mediately—don't stay to beat a Parley.</P>
<STAGE>[The back Scene opens and discovers <HI>Fantome</HI> with a Drum.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mrs. <HI>Nabby,</HI> I have overheard all that has been said, and find thou hast manag'd this thing so well, that I cou'd take thee in my Arms, and kiss thee—if my Drum did not stand in my way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, O' my Conscience, you are the merriest Ghost! and the very Picture of Sir <HI>George Truman.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you flatter me, Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI>; Sir <HI>George</HI> had that fresh∣ness in his Looks, that we Men of the Town cannot come up to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Death may have alter'd you, you know—besides, you must consider, you lost a great deal of Blood in the Battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's right; let me look never so pale, this Cut cross my Forehead will keep me in Countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis just such a one as my Master receiv'd from a cursed <HI>French</HI> Trooper, as my Lady's Letter inform'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>It happens luckily that this Suit of Cloaths of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s fits me so well,—I think I can't fail hitting the Air of a Man with whom I was so long acquainted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the very Man—I vow I almost start when I look upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what good will this do me, if I must remain in∣visible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what good did your being visible do you? the fair Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI> thought no Woman cou'd withstand him—But when you were seen by my Lady in your proper Person, after she had taken a full survey of you, and heard all the pretty things you cou'd say, she very civilly dismiss'd you for the sake of this empty, noisy Creature <HI>Tinsel.</HI> She fancies you have been gone from hence this Fortnight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really I love thy Lady so well, that tho' I had no hopes of gaining her for my self, I cou'd not bear to see her given to another, especially to such a Wretch as <HI>Tinsel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, tell me truly Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> have not you a great Opinion of my Fidelity to my dear Lady, that I wou'd not suf∣fer her to be deluded in this manner, for less than a Thousand Pound?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art always reminding me of my Promise—thou shalt have it, if thou canst bring our Project to bear; do'st not know that Stories of Ghosts and Apparitions generally end in a Pot of Money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly now Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> I shou'd think my self a very bad Woman, if I had done what I do, for a Farthing less.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Abigal,</HI> how I admire thy Virtue!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> I defy the worst of my Enemies to say I love Mischief for Mischief sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is thy Lady perswaded that I am the Ghost of her deceased Husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I endeavour to make her believe so, and tell her every time your Drum rattles, that her Husband is chiding her for enter∣taining this new Lover:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee make use of all thy Art, for I am tir'd to Death with strowling round this wide Old House, like a Rat behind a Wainscot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I tell you, 'twas the purest place in the World for you to play your Tricks in; there's none of the Family that knows every Hole and Corner in it, besides my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI>! You have had your Intrigues.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>For you must know when I was a romping young Girl I was a mighty lover of <HI>Hide and Seek.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, by this Time, I am as well acquainted with the House as your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very much mistaken, Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI>; but no mat∣ter for that; here is to be your Station to Night. This is the Place unknown to any one living besides my self, since the Death of the Joyner; who, you must understand, being a Lover of mine, contriv'd the Wainscot to move to and fro, in the manner that you find it. I design'd it for a Wardrobe for my Lady's cast
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
Cloaths. Oh! the Stomachers, Stays, Pettycoats, Commodes, lac'd Shooes, and good things that I have had in it!—pray take care you don't break the Cherry-Brandy Bottle, that stands up in the Corner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> I hire your Closet of you, but for this one Night—a thousand Pound you know is a very good Rent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, get you gone; you have such a way with you there's no denying you any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm a thinking how <HI>Tinsel</HI> will stare, when he sees me come out of the Wall: for I am resolved to make my Appearance to Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get you in, get you in, my Lady's at the Door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray take care she does not keep me up so late, as she did last Night; or depend upon it I'll beat the Tattoo.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm undone, I'm undone— <STAGE>[As he is going in]</STAGE> Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> you have put the thousand Pound Bond into my Brother's Hands.</P>

<P><STAGE>[opening the Door]</STAGE> Oh, dear Madam, was it you that made such a knocking? my Heart does so beat—I vow you have frighted me to Death—I thought verily it had been the Drummer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been showing the Garden to Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI>; he's most insufferably witty upon us about this Story of the Drum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, he's a very loose Man! I'm afraid 'tis he that hinders my poor Master from resting in his Grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! an <HI>Infidel</HI> is such a Novelty in the Country, that I am resolv'd to divert my self a Day or two at least with the Odd∣ness of his Conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Madam! the Drum begun to beat in the House as soon as ever this Creature was admitted to visit you. All the while Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI> made his Addresses to you, there was not a Mouse stirring in the Family more than us'd to be—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Baggage has some Design upon me, more than I can yet discover. <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE>—Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI> was always thy Fa∣vourite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and shou'd have been yours too, by my Consent! Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
<HI>Fantome</HI> was not such a slight fantastick thing as this is.—Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI> was the best-built Man one shou'd see in a Summer's Day! Mr. <HI>Fantome</HI> was a Man of Honour, and lov'd you! Poor Soul! how has he sigh'd when he has talk'd to me of my hard∣hearted Lady—Well! I had as lief as a thousand Pound, you wou'd marry Mr. <HI>Fantome!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell thee-truly, I lov'd him well enough till I found he lov'd me so much. But Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> makes his Court to me with so much Neglect and Indifference, and with such an agree∣able Sauciness—Not that I say I'll marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry him, quoth-a! no, if you should, you'll be awa∣ken'd sooner than married Couples generally are—You'll quick∣ly have a Drum at your Window.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, suppose your Husband, after this fair Warning he has given you, shou'd sound you an Alarm at Midnight; then open your Curtains with a Face as pale as my Apron, and cry out with a hollow Voice, What dost thou do in Bed with this Spindle-shank'd Fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why wilt thou needs have it to be my Husband? he never had any reason to be offended at me. I always lov'd him while he was living, and shou'd prefer him to any Man, were he so still. Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> is indeed very idle in his Talk, but I fancy, <HI>Abigal,</HI> a discreet Woman might reform him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a likely matter indeed; did you ever hear of a Wo∣man who had Power over a Man, when she was his Wife, that had none while she was his Mistress! Oh! there's nothing in the World improves a Man in his Complaisance like Mar∣riage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Grave Subjects! he jests upon the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Positive! Why he contradicts you in every thing you say.</P>

<P>A very pretty Subject indeed for a Lover to divert his Mistress with.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tin.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the Truth, I have not time to look into these dry Matters my self, but I am convinc'd by four or five learned Men, whom I sometimes over-hear at a Coffee-house I frequent, that our Fore-fathers were a Pack of Asses, that the World has been in an Error for some Thousands of Years, and that all the People upon Earth, excepting those two or three worthy Gentlemen, are impos'd upon, cheated, bubbled, abus'd, bamboozl'd—</P>

<P>We have not Time to be particular. I shall only tell thee in general, that I was taken Prisoner in the Battle, and was under close Confinement for several Months.

<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think she lov'd me; but I must search into this Story of the <HI>Drummer</HI> before I discover my self to her. I have put on this Habit of a Conjurer, in order to introduce my self. It must be your Business to recommend me as a most profound Person, that by my great Knowledge in the curious Arts can silence the <HI>Drummer,</HI> and dispossess the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am going to lay my Accounts before my Lady, and I will endeavour to prevail upon her Ho—nour to admit the Tryal of your Art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have scarce heard of any of these Stories that did not arise from a Love Intrigue—Amours raise as many Ghosts as Murders.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> endeavours to perswade us, that 'tis your Ho—nour who troubles the House.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That convinces me 'tis a Cheat; for I think, <HI>Vellum,</HI> I may be pretty well assur'd it is not me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am apt to think so truly. Ha—ha—ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Abigal</HI> had always an Ascendant over her Lady, and if there is a Trick in this Matter, depend upon it she is at the Bottom of it. I'll be hang'd if this Ghost be not one of <HI>Abi∣gal</HI>'s Familiars.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> hath her Allurements, and she knows I have pick'd up a Competency in your Ho—nour's Service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou ha'st, all I ask of thee in return is, that thou would'st immediately renew thy Addresses to her. Coax her up. Thou hast such a Silver Tongue, <HI>Vellum,</HI> as 'twill be im∣possible for her to withstand. Besides, she is so very a Wo∣man, that she'll like thee the better for giving her the Pleasure of telling a Secret. In short, wheedle her out of it, and I shall act by the Advice which thou givest me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> was never deaf to me, when I talked upon that Subject. I will take an Opportunity of addressing my self to her in the most pathetick Manner.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Women who have been happy in a first Marriage, are the most apt to venture upon a second. But for my part, I had a Husband so every way suited to my Inclinations, that I must entirely forget him, before I can like another Man. I have now been a Widow but fourteen Months, and have had twice as many Lovers, all of 'em profest Admirers of my Person, but passionately in love with my Jointure. I think it is a Revenge I owe my Sex to make an Example of this worthless Tribe of Fellows, who grow impudent, dress themselves fine, and fancy we are oblig'd to provide for 'em. But of all my Captives, Mr. <HI>Tinsel</HI> is the most extraordinary in his kind. I hope the Diversion I give my self with him is unblameable. I'm sure 'tis necessary to turn my Thoughts off from the Memory of that dear Man, who has been the greatest Happiness and Affliction of my Life. My Heart would be a Prey to Melancholy, if I did not find these innocent Methods of relieving it. But here comes <HI>Abigal.</HI> I must teaze the Baggage, for I find she has taken it into her Head that I am entirely at her Disposal.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Madam, your Ho—nour has two Points to consider. <HI>Im∣primis,</HI> To retrench these Extravagant Expences, which so many Strangers bring upon you.—<HI>Secondly,</HI> To clear the House of this Invisible Drummer</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>This learned Division leaves me just as wise as I was. But how must we bring these two Points to bear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I beseech your Ho—nour to give me the hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. But prithee take pity on me, and be not tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be concise. There is a certain Person arrived this Morning, an aged Man of a venerable Aspect, and of a long hoary Beard, that reacheth down to his Girdle. The common People call him a Wizard, a White-Witch, a Conjurer, a Cunning-Man, a Necromancer, a—</P>

<P>No matter for his Titles. But what of all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me the hearing, good my Lady! he pretends to great Skill in the Occult Sciences, and is come hither upon the rumor of this <HI>Drum.</HI> If one may believe him, he knows the Secret of laying Ghosts, or of quieting Houses that are haunted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, these are Idle Stories to amuse the Country Peo∣ple, this can do us no good.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say thou do'st not believe there is any thing in it thy self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say, I do; there is no danger however in the Experiment. Let him try his Skill; if it shou'd succeed, we are rid of the Drum; if it shou'd not, we may tell the World that it has, and by that means at least get out of this Expensive way of living; so that it must turn to your Advantage one way or ano∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you argue very rightly. But where is the Man? I would fain see him. He must be a Curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already discours'd him, and he is to be with me, in my Office, half an Hour hence. He asks nothing for his Pains, till he has done his Work;—no Cure, no Mony.</P>

<P>Ay, such a Stranger as will make all our Lives easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! is he a Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Lord! No, nothing like it,—He's a Conjurer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Conjurer! what, is he come a wooing to my Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you Fool, he's come a purpose to lay the Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay marry that's good News indeed; But where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's lock'd up with the Steward in his Office, they are laying their Heads together very close. I fancy they are casting a Figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee <HI>John,</HI> what sort of a Creature is a Conjurer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he's made much as other Men are, if it was not for his long grey Beard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye <HI>Peter,</HI> it stands with reason, that a Conjurer shou'd have a long grey Beard—for did ye ever know a Witch that was not an Old Woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! I remember a Conjurer once at a Fayr, that to my thinking was a very Smock-fac'd Man, and yet he spew'd out fifty Yards of green Ferret. I fancy, <HI>John,</HI> if thou'dst get him into the Pantry and give him a Cup of Ale, he'd shew us a few Tricks. Do'st think we cou'd not persuade him to swallow one of thy Case-Knives for his Diversion? He'll certainly bring it up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Peter</HI>! thou art such a Wise-acre! Thou do'st not know the Difference between a Conjurer and a Jugler. This Man must be a very great Master of his Trade. His Beard is at least half a Yard long, he's dress'd in a strange dark Cloak, as black as a Cole, your Conjurer always goes in Mourning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he a Gentleman, had he a Sword by his Side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he's too grave a Man for that, a Conjurer is as grave as a Judge,—but he had a long white Wand in his Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be sure there's a good deal of Vertue in that Wand—I fancy 'tis made out of Witch Elm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you if the Ghost appears, he'll whisk ye that Wand before his Eyes, and strike you the Drum-stick out of his Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; the Wand, look ye, is to make a Circle, and if he once gets the Ghost in a Circle, then he has him—let him get out again if he can. A Circle, you must know, is a Conjurer's Trap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what will he do with him, when he has him there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then he'll overpower him with his Learning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he can once compass him, and get him in Lobs-Pound, he'll make nothing of him, but speak a few hard Words to him, and perhaps bind him over to his good Behaviour, for a Thou∣sand Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, hell send him packing to his Grave again with a Flea in his Ear, I warrant him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I wou'd advise Madam to spare no Cost. If the Conjurer be but well paid, he'll take pains upon the Ghost, and lay him, look ye, in the Red-Sea—and then he's laid for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay marry, that wou'd spoil his Drum for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>John,</HI> there must be a power of Spirits in that same Red-Sea—I warrant ye they are as plenty as Fish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I wish after all that he may not be too hard for the Conjurer; I'm afraid he'll find a tough bit of work on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish the Spirit may not carry a Corner of the House off with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for that, <HI>Peter,</HI> you may be sure that the Steward has made his Bargain with the Cunning-Man beforehand, that he shall stand to all Costs, and Damages—But hark! yon∣der's Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> we shall have her with us immediately, if we do not get off.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I have always recommended to you a Method in your Business, I wou'd have your Knives and Forks, your Spoons and Napkins, your Plate and Glasses, laid in a Method.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Master <HI>Vellum,</HI> you are such a sweet-spoken Man, it does one's Heart good to receive your Orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Method, <HI>John,</HI> makes Business easie, it banishes all Per∣plexity and Confusion out of Families.</P>

<P>How he talks! I cou'd hear him all Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now <HI>John,</HI> let me know whether your Table-lin∣nen, your Side-Board, your Cellar, and every thing else within your Province, are properly and methodically dispos'd for an En∣tertainment this Evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master <HI>Vellum,</HI> they shall be ready at a quarter of an hour's Warning. But pray Sir, is this Entertainment to be made for the Conjurer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, <HI>John,</HI> for the Conjurer, and yet it is not for the Conjurer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you Master <HI>Vellum,</HI> if it is for the Conjurer, the Cook-Maid shou'd have Orders to get him some Dishes to his Palate. Perhaps he may like a little Brimstone in his Sauce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Conjurer, <HI>John,</HI> is a complicated Creature, an Am∣phibious Animal, a Person of a Two-fold Nature—But he eats and drinks like other Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, Master <HI>Vellum,</HI> he shou'd eat and drink as much as two other Men, by the Account you give of him.</P>

<P>Thy Conceit is not amiss, he is indeed a double Man, ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! I understand you, He's one of your Hermaphrodites, as they call 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is Married, and he is not Married—He hath a Beard, and he hath no Beard. He is Old, and he is Young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>How charmingly he talks! I fancy, Master <HI>Vellum,</HI> you cou'd make a Riddle. The same Man Old and Young! How do you make that out, Master <HI>Vellum?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast heard of a Snake casting his Skin, and reco∣vering his Youth. Such is this Sage Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay 'tis no wonder a Conjurer shou'd be like a Serpent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he has thrown aside the old Conjurer's Slough that hangs about him, he'll come out as fine a young Gentleman as ever was seen in this House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he intend to sup in his Slough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Time will show.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I have not a Head for these things. Indeed, Mr. <HI>Vellum,</HI> I have not understood one Word you have said this half Hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not intend thou shou'dst—But to our Business—Let there be a Table spread in the Great-Hall. Let your Pots and Glasses be wash'd, and in a Readiness. Bid the Cook provide a plentiful Supper, and see that all the Servants be in their best Liveries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! now I understand every Word you say. But I wou'd rather hear you talk a little in that t'other Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall explain to thee what I have said by and by—Bid <HI>Susan</HI> lay two Pillows upon your Lady's Bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two Pillows! Madam won't sleep upon 'em both! She is not a double Woman too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will sleep upon neither. But hark, Mrs. <HI>Abigal,</HI> I think I hear her chiding the Cook-Maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll away, or it will be my Turn next; She, I am sure, speaks plain <HI>English,</HI> one may easily understand every Word She says.</P>

<P>You are a very inquisitive Spirit. But I must tell you, if you do not take care of your self, you will be Laid this Evening.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have overheard something of that Matter. But let me alone for the Doctor—I'll engage to give a good Account of

Him. I am more in pain about <HI>Tinsel.</HI> When a Lady's in the Case, I'm more afraid of one Fop than twenty Conjurers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you truly, he presses his Attacks with so much Impudence, that he has made more Progress with my Lady in two Days, than you did in two Months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall attack her in another manner, if thou canst but procure me another Interview. There's nothing makes a Lover so keen, as being kept up in the Dark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray no more of your distant Bows, your respectful Com∣pliments—Realy, Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> you're only fit to make Love a-cross a Tea-Table.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child, I always thought your Lady lov'd to be treated with Respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Mr. <HI>Fantome,</HI> there is not so great a diffe∣rence between Woman and Woman, as you imagine. You see <HI>Tinsel</HI> has nothing but his Sauciness to recommend him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Tinsel</HI> is too great a Coxcomb to be capable of Love—And let me tell thee, <HI>Abigal,</HI> a Man, who is sincere in his Pas∣sion, makes but a very awkard Profession of it—But I'll mend my Manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or you'll never gain a Widow—Come, I must tutor you a little; suppose me to be my Lady, and let me see how you'll behave your self.</P>

<P>I'm afraid, Child, we han't time for such a piece of Mummery.</P>

<P>This will do then, <HI>Abigal?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, this is talking like a Lover. Tho' I only represent my Lady, I take a Pleasure in hearing you. Well, o' my Con∣science when a Man of Sense has a little Dash of the Coxcomb in him, no Woman can resist him. Go on at this rate, and the thousand Pound is as good as in my Pocket.</P>

<P>I shall think it an Age till I have an Opportunity of put∣ting this Lesson in Practice.</P>

<P>I'll tell you a Story, Widow; I know a certain Lady, who considering the Craziness of her Husband, had, in case of Mortality, engaged her self to two young Fellows of my Acquaintance. They grew such desperate Rivals for her, while her Husband was alive, that one of them pink'd the t'other in a Duel. But the good Lady was no sooner a Widow, but what did my Dowager do? Why faith, being a Woman of Honour, she married a Third, to whom, it seems, she had gi∣ven her first Promise.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is astonishing!</P>

<P>You were a great Admirer of a single Life for the first half Hour; your Refusals then grew still fainter and fainter. With what Extasy did Sir <HI>George</HI> kiss your Hand, when you told him you shou'd always follow the Advice of your <HI>Mamma!</HI></P>

<P>If he knows any thing of what passes in my Heart, he cannot but be satisfy'd of that Fondness which I bear to his Memory. My Sorrow for him is always fresh when I think of him. He was the kindest, truest, tenderest—Tears will not let me go on—</P>

<SP>
<LG>
<L>TO Night, the Poet's Advocate I stand,</L>
<L>And he deserves the Favour at my hand,</L>
<L>Who in my Equipage their Cause debating</L>
<L>Has plac'd two Lovers, and a third in waiting;</L>
<L>If both the first shou'd from their Duty swerve,</L>
<L>There's one behind the Wainscote in reserve.</L>
<L>In his next Play, if I wou'd take this Trouble,</L>
<L>He promis'd me to make the Number double:</L>
<L>In troth 'twas spoke like an obliging Creature,</L>
<L>For tho' 'tis Simple, yet it shews Good-nature.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Help thus ask'd, I cou'd not chuse but grant it,</L>
<L>And really I thought the Play wou'd want it,</L>
<L>Void as it is of all the usual Arts</L>
<L>To warm your Fancies, and to steal your Hearts:</L>
<L>No Court-Intrigue, nor City-Cuckoldom,</L>
<L>No Song, no Dance, no Musick—but a Drum—</L>
<L>No smutty Thought in doubtful Phrase exprest;</L>
<L>And, Gentlemen, if so, pray where's the Jest?</L>
<L>When we wou'd raise your Mirth, you hardly know,</L>
<L>Whether in strictness you shou'd Laugh or no,</L>
<L>But turn upon the Ladies in the Pit,</L>
<L>And if they redden, you are sure 'tis Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Protect him then, ye Fair ones; for the Fair</L>
<L>Of all Conditions are his equal Care.</L>
<L>He draws a Widow, who of blameless Carriage</L>
<L>True to her Jointure, hates a second Marriage;</L>
