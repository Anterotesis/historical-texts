<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the Hours of Meditation, when the Mind was on its researches for a Pa∣troness to the following Petit Drama, I was not long at a loss for One to whom I might with propriety pay my respects. The very conspicuous figure you have made upon the Stage, brought your Merits to my view, and from those I thought there could be no im∣propriety in my laying this Trifle at your feet. The tutelary Sisters, Melpomene and Thalia, who preside over all the Scenic Arts, have taken you by the hand and placed you on a pedestal so high, that Envy lowers her scowling front whene'er she casts her jaundiced Eye upon your exalted Station, for you justly assimulate the pathetic man∣ners of the one, and fascinate with the
<PB REF="4"/>
bewitching archness of the other. This perhaps may look like flattery, but those who know me, know <HI>that flattery is a talent which I never yet possessed,</HI> and, for the want of which, perhaps I may have hatched some Snakes and Scorpions who have endeavoured to breathe their venom upon the blossoms of my reputation. In the present instance certain malevolant Com∣petiters attempted to sting my rising hopes and disconcert the eminent and arduous ex∣ertions of the Performers, to whom I am so much indebted on this Piece's first assay;—yet I had the satisfaction to see it baffle all their Spleen, and now, Madam, I submit it to the APPROBATION of the PUBLIC, and hope it will receive your PROTECTION.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the Honor to Subscribe myself, MADAM, your most Humble and Obedient Servant, <HI>GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY.</HI></SIGNED>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE PRINTER begs leave to observe that the Reviewers of Theatricals in the MORNING HERALD and other respectable PRINTS, who saw the Representation as well as the Editors of the LONDON, EUROPEAN, NEW LADY'S, and other MAGAZINES, have spoken of this New Piece in very Respectful Terms. <Q REND="inline">"That it is replete with wit, whim, and good humour, and exhibits a well timed satire on the bent of fanciful individuals, demon∣strating that <HI>Every Man</HI> has his <HI>Hobby,</HI> and that all mankind, are, at some period of Life or other, the <HI>Dupes of Fancy.</HI> Upon the whole they pro∣nounce this Farce to surpass mediocrity, and that its merits justly deserve that kind reception from the Public which it has experienced."</Q> The Author is well known to the world by his Lectures on Mi∣micry, Imitations, and other humourous writings;
<PB REF="6"/>
and all lovers of dramatic productions and the Pub∣lic in general will be highly gratified by a sight and perusal of this Comic Piece.</P>
<P>On it's first appearance at the Hay Market, some objections were made to it's <HI>length,</HI> particularly in the Dinner Scene, but by the Author's Judicious curtailment for future Representation, every objection of this kind will be obviated. It is however printed as originally written, and such parts of it marked as were omitted in the representation. It is presumed it will be performed this Summer, at many of the Watering Places throughout the Kingdom, and that it will be brought forward with some amendment and alteration next Season at the King's Theatre.</P>

<STAGE>(THE ACTOR COMING ON THE STAGE AS IF IN ANGER
WITH THE PROMPTER.)</STAGE>
<L>I WISH your Prologues, all, were in the Sea,</L>
<L>You're sure to saddle ev'ry one on me.—</L>
<L>Each trembling Author, shews a frighten'd mind,</L>
<L>And cries to me—Pray will you be so kind</L>
<L>As say a word or two, to paliate</L>
<L>The apprehensions that around me wait.—</L>
<L>A pretty task!—and, nothing more, in brief,</L>
<L>Then feeling guilty, hollows out—"Stop Thief!"</L>
<L>Should the thing please—pray, what do I get by't?</L>
<L>I'll tell you what—I prologuise each night.—</L>
<L>Wit, like a Diamond, is bright and scarce,</L>
<L>Our Author's Wit (poor soul) is all <HI>a Farce</HI>;</L>
<L>You'll see it clearer ere the matter's ended,</L>
<L>But, saying little, is the soonest mended.—</L>
<L>I've got a part to play—'tis time to budge,</L>
<L>Hoping, that while you listen, you will judge</L>
<L>With Mercy—nor make absolute the <HI>Case,</HI></L>
<L>Lest the poor Author fall into disgrace.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT is that which you are taken with so much, Mr. Lazy-bones? why you have been looking at yourself this half-hour, and now you look as if you were frightened out of your wits!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frighten'd!—frighten'd at what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>At yourself to be sure, and I do not wonder at it; why your head looks like a rumpled hen that has gone through a hedge backwards, and your face is as pale as a parsnip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are making me out a strange creature forsooth, may'nt a body tie on one's neckcloth without being frightened out of one's wits at the looking-glass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tying on your neckcloth truly;—heavens what a sloven;—why you have not above half tied it;—I suppose you will be for making love to me with your collar open again.—You look in the face for all the world like the picture of the starved poet, in my master's dressing room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith and troth you are full of your skits, Mrs. Dolly; but for all that, I have heard people say, that to be careless is to be modish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Modish, modish, ha! ha! ha!—I never saw such a modish ninny as you before, it is enough to make one kill one's self with laughing, I am sure you shall never go into the parlour such a comical figure as that—only look at yourself again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how would you have me look?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like a man to be sure.—You that are drawn for the militia too—why you ought to look like a soldier!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How in the name of patience am I to look like a soldier before I'm taught.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me put on your neckcloth, and I'll shew you how.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, that you shall, and thank you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kneel down then, and you shall see what a comely figure I will make of you.</P>

<P>Kneel, aye, that I will and pray too, if you like it, my dear little chick-a-biddy.</P>

<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—Well, now since I have brought you to your prayers I am satisfied, and you shall be releas'd—but it is a pity you had not been choak'd, you look'd so pretty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And should you have lik'd to have seen me choak'd Dolly?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Choak me if I should not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Dolly, now that's so cruel of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?—because you're such a lazy, lubberly, slovenly creature.—Don't you know that this is Saturday, that Alderman Grub is coming to visit Master, and you've got nothing ready.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord help you, be'ant I always ready, what would the woman have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?—why there are all the knives to clean; my Master's new wig to comb out; the tobacco pipes to wax at the ends; and the sand∣dishes to be got in readiness—you know that they smoke like a couple of Turks!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord bless me I had forgot all that to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew you had, you've a precious memory, but my Master would not be apt to forget you I fancy, if you had not got them all prepared in time;—you know he is never so happy as when surrounded with smoke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither, Dolly—Lord, it is my heart's delight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad to hear that, for it convinces me that you will make a better soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they so fond of smoke then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every good soldier is fond of the smoke of gunpowder to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I never lik'd that ever since I had like to have been blown up with it the last fifth of November; I'll tell you all about it;—you must
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
know that I had got a whole pound of powder, and was making of squibs.</P>

<P>Making of squibs was you, and so, I suppose, you went off in a cracker?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TINTEM.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say that every man has his hobby horse, and without one has something in pursuit, life is as insipid as tripe, without mustard or vinegar.—My hobby-horse is my flower-garden, and I can ride that with safety, for I shall never be afraid of that kicking me in the stomach, or breaking my neck with stumbling.—I expect my friend Grub here by and by, and think that I shall amaze him with the variety of colours, which I shall present to him in my amphitheatre.—Mr. Grub has his hobby-horse too, but his horse is a butter-fly;—I often tell him, that he is as fond of pursuing a fly, as a fish or a swallow.—But I must make haste, he will be here soon, and if we should not happen to have the dinner on table exactly at <HI>one,</HI> he will be for stinging me with reproaches, and buzzing in my ears like a gnat.</P>

<P>Nothing, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, I always tell the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TINTEM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken, I am afraid, and have marr'd all; you only told me truth by way of accident, because you was too dull of invention, and had not time to tell me a falshood.</P>

<SPEAKER>GABY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never tell a falshood, Sir, but when I cannot help it.</P>

<P>The story which I have been reading, puts me ex∣actly in mind of poor Mr. Willingford and myself.—His father died, and left him nothing but a good education, and the wide and hazardous world to ramble in;—<HI>Mine</HI> bequeath'd me all he had by his <HI>will,</HI> but left me no <HI>will of my own</HI>;—he has made me over to the care of an avaricious uncle, until I arrive at the age of twenty-one, which, thank heaven, is almost at hand; yet he wishes to transfer me to a beastly creature, who would fain present himself to me as a husband—but I will die first—I am told they cannot force me to marry any body against my will, and that is a comfortable conso∣lation.—Ah! poor Mr. Willingford, when I think of thee—</P>

<P>Charming! you are a dear good creature and I love you for it.—But what is to be done; I know not what to do, or what to say—I am all confusion; I that should at this moment be nothing but contrivance and manoeuvre, am, by the pre∣sent unaccountable flurry on my spirits, rendered in∣capable of every thing, that might be the means of my future happiness.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS TINTEM.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what respect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>In respect to his dinner—for I have sent him up a cold <HI>Collection</HI> as they call it, and provided him with some veal and ham; the cold giblet pye, some cold pudding, by way of settling his love, and a bottle of wine to wash it down whenever he pleases.</P>

<STAGE>[Exit DOLLY.</STAGE>
<P>I am delighted with the frankness and attachment of this good natured girl, but extreamly aggitated at the state of poor Mr. Willingford; sure it is the most provoking and tantalizing situation in the world.—The man I love, and whom I have not seen this month, to have him under the very roof with me, and even there depriv'd the sight of him, when instead of receiving him as I ought, to have him lock'd up in a state of apprehension and fear, is hard indeed!</P>

<P>No, Sir;—but as I hope to be sav'd, I was only getting a sop in the pan, and the great splaw-footed creature pushed me down, and so, to save my head from going into the fire, I tumbl'd with my hands into the Dripping-pan, which scal∣ded my poor fingers so much that I was oblig'd to to run to Dr. Seret's in order, as a body might say, to get them <HI>nointed</HI> before I could make use of them again.</P>

<STAGE>[an inward laugh from behind.</STAGE>

<P>Aye, the Great Duke of Cum∣berland;—that flower made its first appearance in the Botanical world, in the Rebellion, Forty-five;—was nam'd in honor of the British hero of that day, and such a flower as this is enough to immortalize the memory of any General in the world.</P>

<P>Yes, I have generally got a good taste for them, when they produce a good smell to me, <STAGE>(smelling)</STAGE> but this flower seems to have no smell at all.</P>
