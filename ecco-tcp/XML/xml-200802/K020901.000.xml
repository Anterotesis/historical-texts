<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE hint of this Piece was taken from one of the <HI>Contes Moraux</HI> of <HI>Marmon∣tel,</HI> stiled <HI>L'Hereux Divorce.</HI> The foible ri∣diculed in the tale is, perhaps, the only one imputed to our sex which has never yet been exposed by a theatrical representation. It is a simplicity, not a coquetry; it is the error of a delicate and elevated mind, unacquainted with the manners of real life, or the general frame of the human heart.</P>
<P>The novel was too barren of incident to furnish out an entertainment for the stage, which obliged me to contrive an intire un∣der-plot, and introduce several new charac∣ters into the Comedy, which I shall not take up the reader's time to point out here; and submit this performance to the candor and clemency of the public, after having, per∣haps, too adventurously hazarded their criti∣cism and censure.</P>

<L>Know then, my lords, and gentlemen o'th' jury,</L>
<L>We've found a bill i'th' records of old Drury,</L>
<L>In which the culprit's charg'd, in this here cause,</L>
<L>With rankest treason against nature's laws,</L>
<L>By introducing 'mong the scenes of life,</L>
<L>A thing unheard-of, a <HI>Platonic</HI> Wife;</L>
<L>Fair, blooming, and 'bout twenty-five—no more—</L>
<L>I thought, at least, she had been sixty-four!</L>
<L>Here rests my plea: In order to make good</L>
<L>The rights and properties of flesh and blood,</L>
<L>For evidence upon yourselves I call,</L>
<L>And set the cause on this, to stand or fall,</L>
<L>Have ye now one <HI>Platonic</HI> Wife among ye all?</L>

<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<L>My lords and gentlemen, attend a while,</L>

<L>My brother's somewhat warm; but, <HI>entre nous,</HI></L>
<L>Might not <HI>Platonic</HI> Wives suit some of you?</L>
<L>Men fond of hunting, drinking, or <HI>debate,</HI></L>
<L>Would they repine at a <HI>Platonic</HI> mate?</L>
<L>Their hearts are aliened from domestic life,</L>
<L>And hounds, or wine, or <HI>party,</HI> are a wife.</L>
<L>Besides, he argues from the <HI>common laws,</HI></L>
<L>But I in <HI>equity</HI> defend the cause;</L>
<L>Plead, women are not bound by Nature's rules,</L>
<L>Nor are their morals borrow'd from the schools:</L>
<L>How many sacrifice their youthful charms</L>
<L>To an old, wealthy husband's feeble arms!</L>
<L>Or yield to titles what they owe to merit,</L>
<L>Wretched themselves, that children may inherit!</L>
<L>These sure are <HI>Platonists,</HI> who thus forego</L>
<L>Nature's true joys for wealth, or rank, or shew!</L>
<L>Our heroine, tho' she differs wide from these,</L>
<L>Has but refin'd upon the same disease.</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
Our auth'ress too, perhaps, to aid her cause,</L>
<L>May boast herself the great sublime she draws.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> REJOICE to find that your ladyship's good nature is as much delighted as mine, at lady Frankland's happy escape from the galling chain of matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Clarinda, I look upon it, that next to the felicity of widowhood is that of being sepa∣rated. However, there are, my dear, some mate∣rial differences: While the tyrant lives to whom we have been bound, we never can forget we have been slaves. There are, besides, some other dis∣agreeable circumstances which attend a separation, from which, thank Heaven, my state is free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean, I suppose, the power a husband has of withdrawing alimony, in case of indiscretion, and forcing the wretched wife upon certain <HI>moyens de vivre,</HI> whether she will or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. Now you know that since that Gothic statute of the Black-Ram, in the North-west Rid∣ing, has been abolished, we widows may chuse what hobby-horse we please; sometimes, for varie∣ty, perhaps an ass; but oh! defend me from a mule, 'tis so vastly like a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the happiest simile in the world: for, on my conscience, they seem equally to be deviations from the laws of nature. However, when broke, from restiveness, they are the best pack-saddle am∣blers in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, my dear Clarinda, that we have got this pretty little bird out of its cage, what think you will it do with its freedom? 'Tis vastly wild, and will, I imagine, take flight to some Arcadian grove, and sit and sing alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no; that must not be: it would disgrace our generalship. She dies for sentimental passion; and when once her romance is known, I warrant we shall be able to supply her with pretenders enough, who may assume by turns, the crook and scrip, the helmet and the lance, to hold her in play. Nay, piqued as she was at what she stiled lord Frank∣land's indifference toward her, I am persuaded that if one tender tear had but glistened in his eye, at the instant of their separation, she would have sunk into his arms, and like the plaintive turtle, have
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
moaned and cooed away the remainder of her life, in true conjugal insipidity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surprized this did not happen, for I am quite of opinion that lord Frankland loves her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>He certainly does; but then he did not deify her. My lord knows himself to be a mere mortal man, and has not the presumption of lxion, to cope with goddesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>He once, I think, admired you, Clarinda; it was thought you liked him too: how happened you to escape the noose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Platonics, lady Fanshaw, all Platonics. So vul∣gar a notion as matrimony, never once, I believe, entered either of our heads; and I dare swear he wishes now, that he had never changed his mind since in that article.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis possible he may; and that at length, tired with the pettishness of a spoiled child, he may re∣turn and throw his devoirs again at the feet of one who will at least treat him like a reasonable creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not indulge the hope; but I shall endea∣vour though, to lay every obstacle in the way to their re-union. Lady Frankland is young and handsome; she may be virtuous too; but how long that same fortress, called Chastity, will hold out when besieged by flattery, the love of which is her chief foible, I cannot say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why just as long, Clarinda, as any other fortress, where the governor loves money, and the besiegers come up to his price. But among those who either are, or pretend to be, her adorers, I cannot yet per∣ceive that she has shewn the smallest preference; and I really believe that she admires Alexander, Cy∣rus, or Orondates, more than any man alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps she may think so too; but be assured, lady Fanshaw, that any person who ardently desires to inspire a <HI>romantic</HI> passion is not unsusceptible of a <HI>natural</HI> one; and when that takes place, she will e'en act an old proverb, and accept of the <HI>living dog,</HI> instead of the <HI>dead lion.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But come, my dear Clarinda, and let us attend the levee of this eccentric comet, which, like other blazing stars, perhaps glitters but to fall.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>

<P>May each new morn, fresh from its downy wings, shed health and happiness around her! Order my chariot, Ambrose, and see that all things are got ready for my departure this morning.

<P>No, Charles; you seem to have some doubts of lady Frankland's conduct: I would have you, therefore, be a witness to it; for my part I have none. Your intimacy with Emilia, who now lives with my wife, will furnish you with sufficient op∣portunities to know every step she takes, and I shall thank you with true gratitude, to deal with strictest justice.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, toward myself I will. This poor, weak man has parted from his wife, for wishing he should love her, and now sits pining at yon baby-face, and longs to have the limbs to it again. But should that happen, he may perhaps get others, which must contract and cripple mine. Counsellor Frankland, with four hundred pounds a-year, and that dipt up to the chin too, is but a poor lover sor Emilia, with
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
fifteen hundred; but the same man, heir to lord Frankland's rank and fortune, sounds well enough. Therefore the case stands thus: my bird is almost caught, and shall I loose the string, and let it fly, to lure his to the nest again, where it may sit and breed, while I am whistled down the wind to prey at fortune?</P>

<P>Bless me, what had stars to do in that case?—unless you mean stars and garters; and I dare say his lordship might easily have obtained a red ribbon, at least, if that could have rendered you happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear wild girl, you have wandered very far from my meaning. When I accused my fate, in order to excuse my lord, it was for not having af∣forded me some glorious opportunity of manifest∣ing a passion for him, by some noble, generous deed, which must have extorted his admiration, his gratitude, and love. For, to deal candidly, what right had I to have expected that lord Frankland should be a passionate lover? what sacrifice had I made him? by what heroic devotement had I awakened the sensibility of his soul? where was the merit of having obeyed my parents, and accepted for an husband one, to whom I could possibly have no exception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you talk strange∣ly, and put me in mind of a young lady of my ac∣quaintance, deeply versed in romance, who, with a
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
large fortune, ran away with an ensign; but when they had got clear off, she would not be content unless he returned and suffered her to leap out of a window to him: The experiment was made, and the poor lady discovered, and confined, till a more suitable match could be found out for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>With which, I suppose, she was miserable for life. Why should love meddle in matches of con∣venience? Oh, ye delights of sensible souls! charms of impassioned hearts! where are ye? alas! in free and independent love alone, in the mutual yield∣ing of two fond hearts, which have bestowed them∣selves!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for Heaven's sake, dear lady Frankland, don't run on at this rate! I vow I am frightened lest you should tempt me to throw away myself and fortune, upon some beggar in pursuit of these same transports, which, after all, I do not believe are to be found any where but in the heated imagination of some poet or romance-monger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope that my dear Emilia will experience every happiness which she can wish. I own your reproof is just, and I shall henceforth avoid any discourse that may elevate your notions to such an height, as may perhaps make you feel those bitter pangs of disappointment, which have been my lot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear lady Frankland, I had not the least idea of your growing serious on the subject: But luckily here comes company to divert it. I have some letters to write, and shall return the moment they are finished.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank ye, ladies, for your congratulations; but as yet I confess I do not see of what great advan∣tage this same boasted liberty will be of to me. I have really no pursuits to follow, no inclinations to indulge, that need restraint; and to become one's own mistress, at my age, is, I think, a thing rather to be feared than wished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, madam, yours is a critical situation. But what is <HI>female</HI> liberty, after all, but a name? for a fine woman can never enjoy it, but in the mo∣ment she renounces it; and it is only worth pre∣serving, in order to part with it to good purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonished, Sir Harry, to hear you preach such absurd doctrine: Lady Frankland is very young; her ignorance is therefore pardonable; but give me leave, who have been my own mistress these ten years, to instruct her ladyship in the charms and use of liberty, and I fancy she will find there is something in them more than <HI>a name.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I bow to your superior judgment, and must confess I do not know a more experienced guide, to all the paths of pleasure. You and the gay Clarinda here, would have made notable priest∣esses,
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
were the mysteries of the <HI>Bona Dea</HI> now in vogue. But, madam, <STAGE>[to lady Frankland]</STAGE> I would not have your ladyship discouraged by what I have said with regard to liberty, for 'tis, doubtless, a most delightful thing to be free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir Harry, provided one knows how to use that freedom; but to run gadding about the world, without meaning or design, is certainly a gross abuse of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absolute prostitution of our greatest blessing—But, in my opinion, there is but one measure for your ladyship to pursue; to chuse a proper con∣ductor, and leave the rest to him. A person, en∣dowed with your ladyship's beauty, and delicacy of sentiment, must surely have the choice of many.</P>
<STAGE>[Bowing affectedly to her.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>There lies the difficulty, Sir Harry. When they who wished my happiness, as ardently as I can do, whose judgment and experience were far superior to mine, have erred, what have I not to fear, even in the choice of a mere sentimental friendship, which is all my situation can admit of?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship means, I suppose, in chusing lord Frankland for your husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I swear, for my part, I ever thought it an ill∣suited match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he is really a good sort of man, and sen∣sible enough too, but unhappily wants taste; not at all cut out for discovering the elegant and re∣fined charms of your ladyship's mind. Besides,
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
really the desire of pleasing an husband, is in gene∣ral so very languid, that a fine woman seldom ex∣erts her most amiable qualities, toward him. To charm, to conquer, she reserves for other eyes, and other hearts than his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir Harry, I should look upon myself as highly culpable, if that had been my case. My ut∣most wish was to inspire lord Frankland with the most delicate passion: How I have failed, I know not!</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! and is that the mighty secret, la∣bouring in your breast?—Why, my good cousin Charles, you ought certainly to be a great wit, for you really have a very bad memory, and seem utterly to forget that you have told me the same story, by night and by day, an hundred times at least, within these three years, and that I have al∣ways received this pompous declaration, just as I do at present—Ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely unhappy, madam, to find that the most important concern of my life should be∣come a matter of ridicule and mirth to you.

<P>What, pray?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe there are few men, now-a-days, ridicu∣lous on that account. I have, indeed, read of lovers who have sighed whole years away, without daring to acquaint the happy object with their passion.</P>

<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, without any hope or desire of a return?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to divest a lover of the fond hope of being pitied, at least, by the object he adores; and while he confines his wishes within that bound, he is indeed a lover: but when he vainly thinks his services should merit a reward, perhaps incon∣sistent with the honour or happiness of the beloved object, self-love assumes the place of passion, and it no longer deserves even the name.</P>

<P>No such matters, I assure your ladyship. Yet he has indeed furnished me with a very copious sub∣ject for contemplation. But—</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I claim no right over your secrets, my dear; and from the good opinion I have formed of your cha∣racter,

I dare say you may be safely trusted with the keeping of them yourself. But, as I most sin∣cerely wish your happiness, I must say, that I think you would have a better chance for it with any other man, than Mr. Frankland: There is a reserve, even in his gayest manners, that seems to squint suspicion.</P>

<SPEAKER>AMBROSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest lord, you break my heart to hear you talk so sadly. If your old servant guesses right, your malady is love—Love for the sweetest, best of women, your lordship's wife.

<P>Full well I know her exquisite perfections, Ambrose, and admire them all. But with a heart that lov'd as mine did, how could I bear daily to be reproached with want of tenderness and passion for her! I found it impossible to act up to her romantic notions; and as I could not make her happy, I determined not to make her wretched, tho' 'tis too sure that she has rendered me so.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>AMBROSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am certain, my lord, her gentle heart would break, if she suspected that you grieved for her. She ever has received your poor old servant with the greatest kindness, and made me even sit down before her, when she thought that I looked feeble or fatigued, while she inquired minutely of your lordship's health. Then let me go to her, and tell her what I am sure your lordship thinks, I know she will hear me, indeed she will—Oh! on my knees I beg that I may be the blessed messen∣ger of peace, the happy cause of your re-union!</P>

<P>I command you not to attempt it.

<P>Helas, ma chere innocente! don't you meet a thousand ghosts in every public place? Bodies without souls, who have haunted the world so long, that they are worn out of every one's remem∣brance, and might glide in and out, without ever being taken notice of, if it were not for the space they occupy. Have you never been jostled by a fat red ghost, in the box lobby of the playhouse,
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
or at the puppet-show cascade at Vauxhall? ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>As they differ in every respect from spirits, I should never have thought of stiling them ghosts, tho', as you have explained it, I own the term is apt enough; yet I fancy that <HI>blanks</HI> would do still better, as some authors have lately used them, merely to make up bulk, and stuff life's volume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow, madam, your ladyship has an infinity of wit, as well as beauty. But now, prithee, dear lady Frankland, what do you seriously mean to do with them both?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not find myself overburthen'd with either of those rare qualities, Sir Harry; but if I should, I must e'en look out for some good-natured person, who will be kind enough to assist me in bearing the load.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now your ladyship talks reason. Mutual offices are the very bands of society. And among the croud of adorers, who bow before your shrine, have you yet fixed on one whom you think equal to so blest a charge? I may be impertinent—Your ladyship's blushes seem to hint as much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir Harry, a heart like mine has nothing to disguise—If I blushed, it was not shame, but pride, that glowed upon my cheek, from the slight notion you seem to have conceived of me, that among the trifling characters which frequent my drawing room, there could be found one capable of attaching my confidence, or regards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be the height of vanity in me, to set down their visits to my own account, Sir Harry, while I am blest with a companion in my house, whose mind is free, and person disengag'd, and where each charm that can attract in both, unite in my Emilia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith I have always heard your ladyship reck∣oned a little romantic, but never believed it till now. Emilia! why we know her price is matri∣mony, to become a property for life, egad.

<P>I vow I did not mean it, and ask a thousand pardons—but surely, madam, with that blaze, that glow of youth and beauty which surrounds you, it is impossible you should think of living disengag'd! Were the Hesperian fruit planted in our streets, it would require ten dragons to secure it. Alas! you have not one.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do not give yourself the least trouble upon that account, Sir Harry, for tho' I am, as you ob∣served, <HI>a little romantic,</HI> I have not bravery sufficient to turn knight-errant; and I must surpass even the renowned Don Quixote, should I think of encoun∣tering the numerous host of rivals which your attachment might enrage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>O but, Sir Harry, my heart is so very tender, that I should be moved to restore you back to the groans of lady Subtle, or the first stalking shade of those numberless ghosts your cruelty has made, that might come to haunt me for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure your ladyship you are wrong to make a jest of my behaviour to lady Subtle; there are few men of my rank in life, who have either morals, or politeness, sufficient to pay the least regard to a dying reputation.—Now, madam, it has ever been my principle and practice both, never pub∣lickly to abandon a mistress; and when I have been insufferably tired of a lady, I have kept my chamber, and seen no company for three days to∣gether, in order to give her the credit of the rup∣ture. But you are not to expect such nice morals from the generality of men, I'll assure you, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you amaze me! is this, Sir Harry, what you stile morals, principles, politeness! to betray, to expose a wretched woman! surely I am in a dream, I cannot think myself awake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, madam, I think we are both very near taking a nap; we have wandered from the point strangely; and I ought to beg your lady∣ship's pardon, for having made so improper an use of the favour you have indulged me in. Eh donc, ma belle, will you now seriously fix upon the happy man, who is to love and be beloved by you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be short then, her ladyship assumed all the airs of an heroine in romance, talked of constancy, assiduity, friendship, esteem—and modestly gave me to understand, that I must dangle some months, at least, after her, before she could think of re∣warding my labour. Ha! ha!</P>

<P>But did she promise to be kind upon these terms, Sir Harry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, not expresly indeed; but sure, Belville, you and I are too well acquainted with the sex, not to know that a constant attendance for a fort∣night, a few warm sighs, some drops of heat dis∣tilling from the eyes, with a volley of flattery planted against her ears, would have carried this proud princess captive, and made her fink into my arms.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry, notwithstanding the lightness of your manners, I have ever believed you to be a man of honour; I must therefore suppose, that you have framed this story, purely to try my opinion and re∣gards for lady Frankland; and that on that disco∣very, you will freely own the falsehood.</P>

'Tis very odd, now, I have coquetted with half a dozen at once, and have been kind to two or three, and yet never had the honour of a duel being sought for me, tho' I have endeavoured to set the men together by the ears, with all my might. But these sly, slow things, that have either the reality, or appearance of virtue, do fifty times more mischief, than we good natur'd, generous hearted girls are capable of doing.

<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, all I know of the matter is, that just now as I entered the park, I saw these gen∣tlemen both draw their swords, and engage; and before I could get up to the place, Sir William had become master of Sir Harry's sword.</P>

<P>I know there was a woman in the case, whom I dare pronounce to be lady Frankland.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is perhaps, the very reason why they fought about her. A woman in her circumstances, is looked upon as lawful plunder, to which the long∣est sword gives a title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear unhappy friend, I am grieved to the heart for her. I was going to visit lord Frankland, just across the park, but I shall first return to her for a few minutes. I intreat, Clarinda, that you will not mention this affair to any mortal.</P>

<P>I have heard you, Sir, and from your own lips condemn you, nor can any of your artful palliatives ever induce me to change my opinion.

<P>For heaven's sake hear me one word, my Emilia!</P>

<P>No, Sir. But to rid you of perhaps your greatest uneasiness, I promise you I never shall repeat the vile calumny you thought proper to insult me with; so that your secret remains safer, even in a woman's breast, than it was in your own. But for the future, I advise you to be more cautious.</P>

<P>Why faith, when I enquir'd for her below, they said she was above; so up I went to the top of the house, to the very garret, to her chambray, as she call'd it, and knocked at the door, out of pure civility, she answer'd, enter, or entry, or something like that; so in I went, and found her sowing on her bodices, without so much as an apron or bed∣gown about her shoulders—augh, she has made me sick about the heart.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU cannot imagine, my dear Emilia, how much I am shocked at what you have told me. I fear I shall now become a common topic of dis∣course. What a triumph for lord Frankland! his character will rise upon the ruin of mine.—Good heaven, what will become of me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you first de∣ceive yourself, and then argue right, upon wrong principles. You must certainly imagine lord Frank∣land a monster, before you can suppose it possible for him to rejoice at your dishonour. On the con∣trary, I am certain he would be sensible of the highest concern, were he acquainted even with your present distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! do not say so, Emilia, I can bear his resent∣ment better than his pity. I fear I have de∣served the one, and am certain I have no claim to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You judge too hardly of yourself, my dear; but I have strong hopes that this unlucky affair will never reach his, or any other ears. Sir Harry has nothing to boast of; we may therefore depend on his silence; and I have too good an opinion of Sir William Belville, to suppose him capable of ever
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
mentioning it; and I would not have your ladyship seem to know one word of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grant it should remain a secret, Emilia; how painful must my situation be! conscious of the highest obligation, which I must not acknowledge, even to the generous hand that has conferr'd it To a mind open and grateful as mine, this must be torture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, lady Frankland, of over-rating the obligation. Sir William knows that your situation cannot admit of a return, and if I am not much deceiv'd with regard to his character, his senti∣ments are too generous to expect one.</P>

<P>Your servant, ladies, I scarce expected the plea∣sure of finding you at home this fine day, when all the world is abroad.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may perhaps be one reason for our staying at home, Sir William. I hate crowds of every kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>If half the world could entertain themselves or others, as either of you ladies can, there would
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
scarce be such a thing as a crowd: select parties and rational conversation, would then become the fashion. But when the mind is vacant of ideas; its activity will seek them from outward objects, which strike upon the senses, yet leave no more impression, than our forms do on a looking glass; while the charms of refined sense, and elegant converse, remain indelible upon the soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, Sir William, I relinquish any share in that very fine compliment, for I confess I have great pleasure in seeing a number of well dressed people together, looking as if they were pleased themselves, and wishing to please others; and I should certainly have been in the park an hour ago, if I had not staid in compliment to her lady∣ship.</P>

<P>You render me uneasy, Emilia, pray do not suffer your complaisance for me to trespass on your pleasures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' you modestly refuse it, madam, you have still a part in the eulogium; nor is it for want of ideas in yourself, but to inspire them in others, that you need ever wish to appear in public; and who that sees Emilia, must not be captivated with the pleasing one of sprightly innocence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Upon my word, Sir William, your extravagant politeness distresses me; yet I confess my foible, if it is one, in being pleased at being approved and esteemed by a person of your refined senti∣ments. I hope too, that it is a pleasure I may in∣dulge with innocence.</P>

<P>You are vastly mistaken, Sir, there is nothing more pleasant, and healthful too; and I am cer∣tain half the people of fashion in London would die of fevers, if it were not for the benefit of per∣spiration, which they can only receive in such places, as they are too delicate to use exercise suf∣ficient to procure it any other way.</P>

<P>Does your lordship mean men or women?</P>

<SP>

<P>Beware of that spirit, sense, and gaiety, Emilia, which have not virtue for their base! they are dangerous instruments in dangerous hands! I am shock'd at her intimacy with my wife, which she has compassed since our separation; and if I have yet any influence with lady Frankland, or with you, you will both immediately quit all con∣nection there.

<P>I am grieved at thinking what may be the event of this connection. All women who have forfeited their own title to virtue, envy those who possess it; and would wish to sink them to their own base level. I am certain lady Frankland is virtuous, open, and sincere. But alas! what arms are these, to combat the charms of flattery, the attractions of
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
pleasure, and the snares of seduction! should she sink under them. I surely am to blame, who have exposed her youth and inexperience to a trial, per∣haps too hard. But should she pass this more than ordeal fire, unsullied and unhurt, she will be something more than woman; and adoration, late her claim, will then become her due. I'll hope the best.</P>

<P>Why, that same doughty knight-errant, you have named, took it into his wise head, that be∣cause a certain fair lady had never allowed him a tête à tête, she never meant to indulge herself, or any body else, with one; and upon my declaring that she had done me that favour, talked in a high, ridiculous, romantic strain of the lady's honour and character; and seemed to hint as if he suspected me of a falsehood. That you'll allow was not to be endured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, by no means, Sir Harry. However, I have not quite so much pity for you, as I had, as you were paid, I suppose, before-hand. A tête à tête with lady Frankland, was, I think, an over-pay∣ment for the slight scratch you have received.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now, my dear Clarinda, there's the mis-chief on't. I had nothing to boast of; for this same petite partie ended in a very absurd proposal on her side, for entering into the Platonic system, which I positively refused. Car je n'ai pas le tems.

<P>Very absurd and ridiculous, truly! Equally so, on both sides. I never could have supposed, that a man who knows the world, as well as you have a right to do, could have slipp'd such an opportu∣nity, so simply. Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why faith, Clarinda, there is a kind of bashful courage about those modest dames, that is capable of putting the most impudent fellow in the world out of countenance; and tho' I was never in better spirits for an attack, she talked so queerly of friend∣ship, esteem, honour, and such stuff, that she left me little to say, and less to do; so I e'en quitted the field, and marched off.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>One often says more, Sir William, as well as less, than they think, according to the degree of spirits they happen to be in. I confess myself a rattle, and have vivacity enough to be fond of public places. Yet, I very soon tire of them, and frequently prefer the gaiety of these little objects, which I can create with my pencil, and the enjoy∣ment of my own thoughts, to the more glaring shadows which surround me abroad, and no thought at all. 'Tis vastly pleasant to think some∣times, Sir William.</P>

<P>I must differ with you, Sir William; for I really know many good sort of people, who I am sure

have nothing to reproach themselves with, yet for want of an early habit, dread sitting alone, as much as if they feared spirits, and would run into any kind of company, rather than endure their own.</P>

<P>I don't understand you, Sir William; I should certainly have dined abroad, if I had happened to have one of my own servants with me, to have sent home to Emilia. I did not expect the fa∣vour of your company, Sir, therefore cannot charge myself with any want of politeness toward you.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Want of politenefs, Madam! is that a term to me? whose heart-strings you have strained, and taught to feel more racking agonies, than e'er Damien knew! keep your politeness for your lord Mount-Fashion, Madam; I hoped I had an higher claim.</P>

<P>Vanished, Madam! fled in the moment that you gave your hand to that same peregrine lord.</P>

<P>Delusion all! they never yet existed in your breast; self-love alone assumed the form of senti∣mental passion, and has imposed on you, but never shall again on me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>True love requires no sacrifice, but the heart; self love must have its triumphs: suspicion is its constant mate, and the least degree of complaisance shewn to another object, appears a robbery to selfish minds. In short, there can be no slavery equal to that a jealous lover would impose.</P>

<P>Far from it, Sir William; I wish your happi∣ness, so far as it may not be inconsistent with my own; and by depriving you of all right to be jealous, I lay you under the happy necessity of ceasing to be so. I begin to dread the violence of your temper, and what we fear, we cannot love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to know you, Madam, in my turn; the refinement of a platonic passion, but ill agrees with the slightness of your conduct. Sir Harry Wilmot would have been a more suitable lover, and I was certainly wrong to interfere—</P>

<P>MY dearest Emilia, I have now opened my whole soul to you. My mind is a perfect chaos; yet I feel as if a weight had been taken off my breast, by this most fortunate breach with Sir William. Oh, my Emilia, how near have I been to ruin! I am frighted even at the prospect.</P>

<P>You should contemplate it rather, with that kind of pleasure, with which they view the wreck, who have just escaped the storm, with a proper sense toward providence, and a steady purpose never to run the same risque again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humbled as I now am, Emilia, such resolutions are natural, and bare remembrance of the peril I've escaped, must certainly insure my perseverance. But alas, my friend, have I not reason to accuse my fate, for turning those advantages, which are deemed a blessing to my sex, into a curse for me! youth, beauty, innocence, and sensibility, to what have ye reduced me! to become the sport of fop∣pery, or victim of jealousy! Is this the world I have been taught to admire? For what illusions have I strayed from real happiness, which I am now convinced is only to be found, in the calm in∣dulgence

<P>I rejoice to find that the natural good sense of my amiable friend has been only hoodwinked, but not blinded, and that she can so clearly see her errors now</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, wretch that I am! I see them but too late; after I have forfeited the friendship, the confidence, and regards, of the best of men and husbands! thank heaven, though, that I have nothing to re∣proach myself with, except imprudence; and yet, Emilia, can I hope that Lord Frankland should take my word for this, or even condescend to listen to my justification? How I detest the writers of romance! Oh, Emilia, 'tis but too easy to swerve from the right path, but difficult indeed to recover it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why difficult? the little deviation you have made, requires no artful clue. There are no bars against you, but those your fears create. Lord Frankland is still the same tender, affectionate husband he has ever been, and gave a proof of it this morning, by requesting you to quit all farther intimacy with Clarinda, whom he seems to think no safe companion for your honour.</P>

I fancy now, that Sir William will carry the town—not by storm indeed, but by starving the be∣sieged into terms of capitulation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand your ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, in plainer English, Sir William is grown jealous, and will, if possible, prevent any other man from coming near her. By this means, she will find herself prisoner, and may then probably surrender her person, to obtain her liberty, en parole, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deal still in tropes, Lady Fanshaw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but you understand me, for all that, Clarinda. You know full well that when a woman puts herself into the power of a man, he becomes a tyrant, she a slave, from that moment; and all the difference I can find, between marriage and gallan∣try, is, that one is perpetual, the other temporary, only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I care not by what means her ruin is accom∣plished, provided it be accomplished. Her fatal marriage with Lord Frankland, blasted all my
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
hopes, and I cannot bear to think that she should taste the heart-felt joy of her own virtue, while I am de∣prived of that, as well as of what I resigned it for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, as to that Clarinda, it is no such mighty matter, that one need wish to rob her of it, for we both know with regard to the world, the appearance will answer, as well as the reality. But if you are bent upon her ruin, blast her reputation, my dear—The story you told me of the duel, pro∣perly managed, is sufficient to do that effectually.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That alone shall destroy her fame, should she even preserve her chastity, which you seem to think improbable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have half a score visits to make to morrow morning and I shall take care to whisper this ad∣venture in every one of them, with the tenderest professions of pity for her misfortune, and a <Q>who could have suspected it? I vow I thought her perfectly innocent, but I am afraid lord Frankland had his reasons—though he had too much pride to publish them,</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>This will do, my dear Lady Fanshaw; for let women value themselves ever so much upon their in∣nocence, the loss of character is next to that of virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O much worse, Clarinda—But I must go and visit that simple Sir Harry, as he is confined; I own I despise him, but to persons of certain ranks in life, one must be civil, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall send to know if Lady Frankland be at home. If she is, I'll pay her a visit; perhaps Sir William may be there, and I may possibly discover something to corroborate our story. But that silly chit Emilia never leaves her, so that the woman wants opportunity, were she ever so well inclined—I wish that girl was any how out of the way.</P>

<P>Very true, to be sure, my lady; but too much familiarity breeds content, as the proverb says; and I never should have thought of repeating what Thomas told me, the longest day I have to live, if it was not for their hypocrisy in refusing the visits of such a sweet virtuous lady as my mistress, that I have known, as it were, from a child.

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I request your lordship will allow me, and this honest fellow, to attend you, if it be only to ap∣prove our truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Sir William, your honour has been proved sufficiently, in the detection. His servants honesty shall be rewarded.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great luck to your lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is it possible, Sir William, to repay this service?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall ever consider it as the greatest happiness of my life, that it has been in my power to render you any, madam; and if it might not appear to be presuming too much upon the present incident, I should intreat you to accept all the future services of my life. I rejoice to find your ladyship has led the way into the only path to real happiness.</P>
<STAGE>[To lady Frankland.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the least doubt of your generosity, Sir William, and shall ever be ready, with true gra∣titude, to own my obligations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your ladyship thinks you have any, 'tis in your power to overpay them now, by joining me to request the fair Emilia to accept my hand and heart. Both your ladyship and I have seen the error of imagining they can be separated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND,</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow it, Sir William, and as I know no per∣son so capable of rendering my Emilia happy, I en∣treat—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear lady Frankland, I will not make a merit of granting that to your request, which I think Sir William's own deserts have a right to claim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>The generous manner of conferring, would, if possible, double the obligation.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> FRANKLAND.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have secured the poor unhappy wretch to save him from himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it was true, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too true, Sir; I made his vile accomplice, trem∣bling and scared, convey me to the place where he lay concealed; but when he saw me stand before him, guilt and confusion flashed into his face—He thought it was an apparition, and stiffened quite with horror. I closed upon him instantly, and seized the pistols which lay by his side. He then fell on his knees, confessed his crime, and begged that I would give him from my hand, that death which he deserved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grieve to think, my lord, this happy hour should have been interrupted by such a sad event.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis rather sure an addition to my bliss, that you are saved from misery, Emilia—But to Sir William Belville, your first and greatest thanks are due.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he is not satisfied with my payments, my lord, he must e'en take out a statute of bankruptcy against me, for I have already surrendered to him every thing I was mistress of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I give him joy, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for you, honest Patrick, I think the least re∣turn I can make you, for saving my life and ho¦nour, is to present you with the same sum that Fontange was to have had for destroying both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven bless and prosper your ladyship, for that. Patrick will carry it into his own country, and that itself would be a help to poor Ireland, for every one has a pluck at it, and would be glad to take all they can get from it, and no body never gives it nothing at all.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> NICODEMUS, <HI>with a letter to</HI> Lord FRANK∣LAND.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NICODEMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of your servants has just brought this from your lordship's house, he says the man who gave it him, bid him carry it where-ever you were, if he should not meet with your honour at home.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I permission?</P>
<STAGE>[They all bow, and he opens the letter; and looks at the bottom.</STAGE>
<P>From Clarinda! <STAGE>[reads the letter]</STAGE> Malicious woman! Oh! let the venomed shaft with which she meant to wound my tenderest part, now lodge in her own breast. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> <STAGE>[Gives the letter to Lady Frankland.</STAGE>
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
You see, my dear, I had sufficient cause to warn you against this dangerous woman; and I am pleased to find that her resentment has arisen from your kind attention to my desire in forbidding her your house.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>This fortunate deliverance, with every other suc∣cessful event of my future life, may add to my happiness, but cannot increase that love and grati∣tude, with which my heart o'erflows to thee its generous protector, and its surest guide.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> NICODEMUS.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NICODEMUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Please your ladyship, mademoiselle has got out of the window of the room where his lordship left her, thoa I'se have the key safe enough in my poc∣ket—Shall I go after, and lug her back?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, let the wretch escape; the disappointment of her avarice, be the punishment of her crime; but henceforth I intreat my dearest wife will never employ foreigners again, while there are persons in our own country, both in trade and service, suf∣ficient to supply our uses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this, and every thing else, my pride and plea∣sure shall be, to obey my dearest lord.</P>
<L>Too plainly have I prov'd, that unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Our little skiff is toss'd by every wind,</L>
<L>On rocks and quicksands often is it cast,</L>
<L>And frequent sunk by cruel slander's blast;</L>
<L>But when our pilot at the helm appears,</L>
<L>With steady hand and compass when he steers.</L>
<L>In full security we sail with ease,</L>
<L>And fear nor driving winds, nor raging seas.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Mrs. Clive, <HI>with an</HI> EPILOGUE <HI>in her Hand.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>OH! I am sick with laughing—almost dead!</L>
<L>Well! sure, of all the epilogues I ever read,</L>
<L>This is the dullest! ah! that head! that head!</L>
<L>Such flimsy, poor, quaint trash, was never penn'd!</L>
<L>And what's still worse, he stiles himself <HI>a friend.</HI></L>
<L>I wish he'd be his own, and cease to write,</L>
<L>I vow the <HI>Christmas</HI> bell-man beats him quite.</L>
<L>Such stuff is only fit for <HI>Recitative,</HI></L>
<L>Let's see—I'll try a stave or two—your leave—</L>
<STAGE>[Curtsying.</STAGE>
<L>"To you, ye brave, and also you, ye fair!</L>
<L>"Our female author does her fears declare—</L>
<L>"Invokes your pity—pleads her first offence,</L>
<L>"And that 'tis merit, ev'n to <HI>make pretence."</HI></L>
<L>Ding! dong!</L>
<STAGE>[Spoken in Recitative.</STAGE>
<L>I'll write an air, myself, to't—then you'll roar</L>
<L>Bravo! bravissimo! divine! encore!</L>
<L>But hold<HI>—Piano,</HI> gentlefolks—For here</L>
<L>I'm running on, without all sense of fear—</L>
<L>What's this to'th' play? <STAGE>(puts up the paper)</STAGE> our au∣thor, there she sits!</L>
<L>As I'm alive, she's going into fits!</L>
<L>Our female bard—the writer of this play—</L>
<L>Dear me! what is't that I was go'ng to say?</L>
<L>Lord, I'm so flounder'd! so confused!—No scheme</L>
<L>To bring me off!—I'll tell you an odd dream—</L>
<L>Not mine—t'was hers—So I'll just give you a hint,</L>
<L>And leave you to infer what meaning's in't.</L>
<L>Our Sappho took a nap—you'll say you know it;</L>
<L>Is that uncommon in a modern poet?</L>
<L><PB REF="106"/>
But let that pass—When borne on fancy's wing,</L>
<L>To the smoth brink of the Castalian spring,</L>
<L>She quaff'd so large a draught, it turned her brain</L>
<L>As mad—as some of you are with champaign—</L>
<L>Straight she began to rave 'bout <HI>inspiration!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Plot—diction—moral—sentiment—</HI>and <HI>passion.</HI></L>
<L>Then scrambling up <HI>Parnassus'</HI> mount, she spied</L>
<L>The fiery <HI>Pegasus—</HI>and vow'd she'd ride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now I've been told, d'ye see, that this same steed,</L>
<L>Skittish, and fleet as your <HI>Newmarket</HI> breed,</L>
<L>Has dev'lish pranks—and none but men can ride him,</L>
<L>How aukard must our petticoats bestride him</L>
<L>'Faith, so it prov'd!</L>
<L>For as she, one foot in, and one foot out,</L>
<L>Was tittuping her <HI>hobby-horse</HI> about,</L>
<L>He gave a sudden frisk, reared up in th' air</L>
<L>And canted Sappho off—among ye there!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O dire prognostic of her present state!</L>
<L>I almost tremble to inquire her fate!</L>
<L>Explain this dream—O be our <HI>Art'midorus!</HI></L>
<L>Expound by contraries, the doom before us!</L>
<L>Shall she remount? she'll bring him to his paces,</L>
<L>And shew you mettled sport, at future races?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But metaphor apart—This I dare say,</L>
<L>On the behalf of this <HI>probation</HI> play,</L>
<L>Y'are bound t'encourage it—I'll tell you why—</L>
<L>Wit, like provision, now is ris'n so high,</L>
<L>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome expedient we must fall upon,</L>
<L>To keep the market stock'd, or we're undone:</L>
<L>Now to abolish all monopoly,</L>
<L>And furnish out a choice, and full supply,</L>
<L>Take the advantage of a late decree,</L>
<L>Make't legal to import a quantity,</L>
