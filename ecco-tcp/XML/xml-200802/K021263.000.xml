<HEAD>TO DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>DEDICATIONS are generally meant to to do honour to the Patron, by revealing their private virtues, or recording their public merits. But neither of these subjects occasion∣ed the present address; for while the undivided applause of a nation, proclaims the latter, my small plaudit must be lost, in the general voice; and while the friendship and esteem, of so many of the first personages of the age, are, at once, the strongest testimony, and most pleasing re∣ward, of the former, my simple concurrence must be deemed superfluous.</P>
<P>To neither of these motives, then, is to be attributed my publicly placing this play, un∣der
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
your patronage; but to a desire of acknow∣ledging my gratitude, for the great trouble you have taken with it, and of indulging a much higher vanity, than that of being its author; by declaring to the world, that you are my friend, and that I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your much obliged, and most humble servant,
The AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE hint of this comedy was taken from a much admired performance of Monsieur <HI>Beaumarchais,</HI> stiled <HI>Eugenie,</HI> which Mr. Garrick was so kind to put into my hands, some time ago. I was immediately struck with the elegant simplicity of language, and sentiment, which cha∣racterizes that work, and which, indeed, should do the same, in all dramatic writings, where neither the persons, or situations of the drama, are elevated above the common degrees of life.</P>
<P>I immediately adopted the plan, and set about adapting it to the English Stage. But, as I proceeded in this work, I found I had great difficulties to encounter; for, though Mons. <HI>Beaumarchais</HI> had laid the scene of his play, in Eng∣land, he had, unluckily, adopted Spanish manners. This circumstance appeared an unsurmountable obslacle to me, and I should have immediately relinquished all hopes from my project, if Mr Garrick had not, in the most friendly manner, lent me his assistance, to overcome this otherwise insuperable difficulty.</P>
<P>How far I have succeeded, in rendering this piece worthy of the English stage, must be left to the candor of the public. I shall only add, that the characters of <HI>Frampton, Willis, Loyd,</HI> I may add Mrs. <HI>Winifred,</HI> also, are of English growth. The character of Lord <HI>Eustace,</HI> too, has receiv'd some additions; and I hope that his compunction, for the crime he had committed, will render him more worthy the favour of a British audience, whose generous natures can∣not brook the representation of any vice, upon the stage, except in order to have it punished, or reclaimed. As the situation of <HI>Harriet</HI> would not admit of any change, I have not attempted to deviate from the gentle, and inte∣resting <HI>Eugenie,</HI> of Monsieur <HI>Beaumarchais.</HI></P>
<P>I had written thus far, before I could have been in∣formed of the very kind and favourable reception, with
<PB REF="5"/>
which the public have honoured this piece; and I think myself extremely happy, at having this opportunity of assuring them, that I shall ever retain the most grateful sense of their indulgence to me.</P>
<P>I am particularly bound to Mrs. Clive, on this occasion, who undertook the study of a new part, at a time when she had determined to quit the stage, and whose kindness to the author, and attention to the public, made her hazard her health, by performing it—I need not say how well—when her physicians would have confined her to her chamber.</P>
<P>I acknowledge myself also much obliged to the rest of the performers in my play, for having acquitted themselves so much to the advantage of the piece, and the approbation of the public; to whom I have the honour to be,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>A much obliged, and Most obedient Servant,
The AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>WELL, Willis, they are come!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but I am quite of opinion, they will soon be gone again, at least out of this house; for as I assisted in carrying in their trunks, and band-boxes, merely to contemplate their countenances, I cou'd perceive the strongest marks of dissatisfaction, in Sir William's face; and when the servants retir'd from the parlour, I overheard him, and his sister Winifred, in high disputation—Both their Welch bloods were up, and a fine splut∣ter there was, between them; but, tho' you might
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
have heard them into Hyde-Park, they spoke so quick, that I cou'd only pick up an odd word, here and there, as if Sir William did not like this part of the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish they had staid in the country, with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe there are more people of that mind, than you, Sir. I fancy my lord wou'd give a good round sum, that they had remained fixed to the freehold, at Langwillan.—Tho', to be sure, Miss Harriet is, by many degrees, the handsomest girl, that ever his lordship was fond of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not, Willis, talk of her, in that stile—She is a young woman, both of character, and family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better for her, Sir, if she has a good family of her own, for I am pretty sure she never will belong to ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must again desire you, Mr. Willis, not to speak so lightly, of this affair—the real friends of your lord, will not be much inclin'd to mirth, or ridicule, upon this occasion, I can tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As we were both placed here, by my lord, to manage this matter for him, I thought there cou'd be no great harm, to argue, a little, upon it, Mr. Frampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not, at present, in a humour for con∣versation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, another time will do, as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd have you go, immediately, and acquaint lord Eustace with their arrival—Let him also know, that I shall wait upon the ladies, and make his apology, for not being here to receive them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been very obliging to his lord∣ship, upon many such occasions, Mr. Frampton;
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
but I fancy he never stood more in need of your assistance, and mine, too, than he does, at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' in the same cause, I believe our ser∣vices will tend to different purposes—I shall not flatter his vices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Frampton, you are grown so prudish, of late!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are grown too familiar, Mr. Willis.—You'll oblige me, and obey your lord's com∣mands, at the same time, by going, directly, with the message I desired you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean to offend you, Sir, by observing how useful your friendship has been to my lord.—Has your honour any farther com∣mands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, but those I gave you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Here's more to do, with these shabby, ruin'd, hangers-on, of my lord's, than all the family, beside.—I think myself as good a man as he, and if he had not a little too much spirit for me, I wou'd tell him as much.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit, grumbling.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what a state, have I reduced myself, when even such a wretch as that, dares to upbraid me! What now remains, of all the scenes of mirth, and revelry, which I have been partaker of, beneath this roof! A ruin'd fortune, a disturb'd mind, and a broken constitution, are the only mementos that are now left me—Yet, I think I have fortitude sufficient, to bear all these—but to be obliged to minister to another man's vices, for a wretched subsistence, is to degrade human nature, below the brutes.—Thank heaven, however, I have escap'd being concern'd in this iniquitous affair; and tho' my friendship for lord Eustace, will not suffer me to desert him, in his present difficulties, I am de∣termin'd
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
to proceed no farther, than is consistent with my honour, and my peace.—I have con∣sented to see the lady, and excuse his absence.—I must wait for Sir William's going out, and then hasten to fulfil my promise.</P>

<P>As to that matter, brother, you know you never are satisfied, with what any person does, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yourself. I shall, therefore, make myself per∣fectly ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, on that head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I shall be, while I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this house, I can tell you—I have very solid objections, to staying here—A young, idle, rakish lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a vulgar objection! I declare, Sir William, if I were not acquainted with your ancestry, I should suspect you to be descended from mechanics. But I hope the family of Ap Evans, is known to be quite as ancient, as—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adam, at least, sister—But let me now inform you, that lord Eustace is placed in a much higher rank, than any of your boasted an∣cestors have ever been; and that I hate obligations, to persons above me; for the only satisfaction I ever felt, in receiving favours, arose from the pro∣spect of repaying them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pride, absolute pride, brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an honest one, at least, you must allow, that inclines persons to discharge their debts of honour, as well as of law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir William, give me leave to ask you, where is the mighty matter, of inter∣changing civilities, between persons of a certain rank?—Lord Eustace spent, some months, at your house, in the country.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by my invitation, sister, but yours—You know I was at my estate in Devonshire, the greatest part of the time he spent at Langwillan—I have, therefore, neither right, nor inclination, to accept of his house—Besides, it is extremely inconvenient to me, as I have so much business to transact, in Lincoln's Inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should have written to your broker, then, to provide you apartments, in some of the stoves, on t'other side Temple-Bar, Sir Wil∣liam;—but, as to my niece and me, we don't chuse to be suffocated, I must inform you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this place, as you say, is airy, enough—When I was last in London, about twelve years ago, there was not a house, within a mile of it—but all the fools in the nation, have now crouded up to the capital, and made the head too large for the body; and this very place, where I used to send my horses to graze, begins now, to look something like a street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like a street, Sir William!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us have done with wrangling, sister; I give it up—this air may be better for my girl—I shall stay here, therefore, for the short time I remain in town, tho' I don't like it—You are content, I hope—But what says my Harriet? Why so grave? I expected to have seen you as blithe, as
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
one of the kids, upon our mountains, at your ar∣rival in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find myself a little fatigued, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were all life and spirit, during our journey—the bad air of this town, can't have affect∣ed you, already, child. But tell me how you like this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it very retired, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, Miss Harriet, I don't believe my lord intended following business, or opening shop, when he took it; but, surely, for persons of distinction, it is the very spot one wou'd desire. I am astonished at your want of taste, child—Sir William, I know loves noise.—I think there is nothing else left to wish for, here.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir William, you have your address written upon your cards, and that you have ordered your letters to be directed to Lord Eustace's House. As his Lordship honours me with his friendship, I think it necessary that our Acquain∣tance shou'd be informed, of his great politeness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>His lordship honours me with his friendship!—how well the traffic is kept up, in that phrase, between vanity and vanity. I had or∣dered my letters to Serle's Coffee-house, but since it is determined that I must stay here, I shall direct them to be sent to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>

<P>You seem so very impatient, for my setting out, sister, that I cannot imagine you shou'd

<P>You amaze me—not receive the uncle of the man, who is to marry my daughter?</P>

<P>That may be sooner said than done, I fancy, Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken—I never yet have fal∣sified my promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty alliance, truly, for my niece, and your daughter. But let me tell you, Sir, if Harriet had not a shilling, her family and her beauty wou'd intitle her to a much better match, than your colonel; who has nothing but an old tottering castle, a scarlet coat, and a sword, to settle, by way of jointure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your absurdity distracts me. What has your family and beauty done for you? And I dare say, you once rated them as high, as you do Har∣riet's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, brother, I under∣stand genealogy better, than so—tho' there is not a very great difference, between my niece's years, and mine, she has one generation more, in her table, than I; which, let me tell you, is of no small con∣sequence, to those who know how to set a proper value, upon family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Family! Nonsense! Let those who have no other merit to support them, build on that; but, know, that I despise it; and to make an end of this ridiculous altercation, for ever, I shall inform you, that eight years ago, when Harriet was but a child, and the colonel was sent young abroad,
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
to serve his country, I liked him so well, that I promised his father, if the young fellow return'd, with life, and honour, my daughter shou'd be his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ever disapproved of that me∣thod, of affiancing young persons.—Have you no idea, that it is possible, the colonel may dislike your daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not very apprehensive, on that ac∣count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no fears, of her refusing him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>None.—Bred up in retirement, and in∣nocence, she can have formed no attachment; and her obedience to a fond father, will certainly in∣cline her to dispose of, both her hand and heart, where his prudence shall direct.</P>

<P>For heaven's sake, child, don't talk, in this doleful strain, to me—I can easily conceive that your father's presence may distress you, as he is so totally ignorant of your good fortune—but, with me, it appears ridiculous.</P>

<P>I am, indeed, madam, infinitely distressed, by my father's ignorance of my situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a fuss, is here, about your fa∣ther? You know he wou'd never have given his consent, to your marrying lord Eustace, if he had been asked—he hates men of quality; and as my lord is not yet in possession of his fortune, I doubt if he wou'd even have thought it a good match.</P>

<P>I tell you, child, I lost two excellent matches, myself, by waiting for advice, and, by that means, giving time to the parties, to consider of it; so it came to nothing;—but I now tell you, that by my prudence, your good fortune does not admit of a doubt.</P>

<P>Wretched, and a countess! I think that scarce possible. But what is it you wou'd have,

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is his house, while he is absent from it? I hoped to have met him here—my letters must have informed him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, his, and your father, my lord Delville, Harriet, may have claimed his lord∣ship's attendance. It is only people of no conse∣quence, who are masters of themselves; and, there∣fore, pretend to dignify their insignificance, with the title of independence. But persons of quality, my dear, never presume to rebel against the laws of subordination—But this is a political secret, which you are yet ignorant of, child.</P>
</SP>

<P>He appeared to be perfect master of his own time, when we were first acquainted; nor did his engagements seem to interfere with his inclinations, till after you had commanded me to receive his hand.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Till after I commanded you! Really, Miss Evans, any person who was to hear you talk, in this manner, might suppose that I had compelled you, to marry lord Eustace; but, perhaps, miss, you had rather have been sacrificed to your father's ridicu∣lous attachment to colonel Loyd, and been buried alive, in the old castle of Trevallin.</P>

<P>Do not add to my distress, Frampton! By heaven, my heart bleeds, for the unhappy Har∣riet! Had I, like you, been born a private man, and not at once bound down, by the vile tramels of family, and dependence, the world should not have bribed me, to forsake her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The sense, you now seem to have, of your own situation, shou'd have operated, sooner, my

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Frampton! no! that was beyond my power; I loved her, to distraction—nay, I do love her, still—but let us talk no more, upon this subject; it softens me into weakness; and as I am dependent, on my father, I must obey him—I hope she has not heard, of my intended marriage.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, no, the devil is too great a gainer, by your schemes, to blast them.</P>

<P>Don't you think it is, rather, too late, in the day, for you to turn methodist, Ned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is never too late, my lord, for a man to condemn, and forsake, his follies; and young as you are, I heartily wish this was the time appointed, for your doing so, likewise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>These sentiments have, at least, the grace of novelty, to recommend them, from you, Mr. Frampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sentiments, my lord, are of little con∣sequence to you; but the time draws near, when you must justly suffer, in the opinion of one, who ought to be dear to you. Miss Evans cannot be much longer deceived—and when I reflect upon the vile artifices, that were used, to draw her into a feigned marriage, by heaven, I cannot help detesting you, and every one of the infernal agents, who were any way concerned in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Frampton! my heart tells me that I deserve your detestation—Why, why were you not with me, to save me from the sad effects, of my wild, youthful passions!—The wretches, who were near me, but inflam'd them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>The attachments, of mean persons, are always founded in self-interest, my lord, nor was there ever yet a solid friendship form'd in vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't upbraid me with my miseries, Frampton, but think what a situation is mine. Tho' I feel the errors of my conduct, and wou'd repair them, I am so much involved, in my own toils, that I find it impossible, to break them.—What wou'd I not give, even to postpone this fatal marriage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Postpone it! aye, for ever!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd I do that, I might yet be hap∣py, Frampton; but matters are gone, too far—every thing was settled, between my father, and lady Anne's guardians, before I came to town, and I am certain he never will be brought to relinquish the great advantage, of her immense fottune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you, my lord, be brought to consider those advantages, as an equivalent, for your peace, and honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wou'd you have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Avow your situation, to lord Delville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were it a common folly, I had com∣mitted, Frampton, I might hope for his forgiveness; but the infamy, which must deservedly attend my conduct, in this affair, wou'd probably make him cast me from his heart, and fortune, for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are certainly in very difficult circum∣stances, my lord, nor can I discover any means of extricating you, from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>The only miserable hope, I have now left, is founded on the gentleness of Harriet's na∣ture, which may enable me to prevail on her, to re∣turn into the country, before she hears of my in∣tended marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is rather shameful, my lord, to erect a sanctuary for our vices, upon the virtues of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge it, Frampton; but were Harriet remov'd from the probability of hearing of this hateful marriage, my mind wou'd be more at
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
ease, and I might then possibly think of some ex∣pedient, to break it off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is some merit, in that thought, my lord, and now let me know how I can serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear—That villain Lang∣wood, my father's steward, who persuaded me into this sham marriage, and personated the clergyman, on that occasion, is now dying, and writes me word that he is distracted, with the horrors of his consci∣ence, and is determined to ask the young lady's for∣giveness—a letter from him, to the family, wou'd discover all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>That wou'd, indeed, be fatal; but how can I prevent it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must remain in this house, and take care that my servants prevent their receiving any letters, without bringing them first to you. I will order Willis to intercept them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is fit for the office; but this is a very odious affair, my lord. However, I have promis'd to assist you, and if I can prevail upon myself, I will go so far, as to prevent Langwood's hastening the catastrophe, which I much fear will be a sad one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know not how you torture me! But let me now indulge my fond impatience, and see my lovely Harriet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You must not think of it; I wou'd advise you to retire, directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible I shou'd obey you! I long, yet dread, to see her, Frampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will require a good deal of courage, my lord, to support the interview; for I really think, that an injured, innocent woman, is a very formi∣dable object.—But tho' you may be brave enough, for the encounter, I must prevent it, for the present, as I have but just now apologized for your absence,
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
by telling her you were in Berkshire, with your fa∣ther; and the inconsistency of your immediate ap∣pearance, might justly alarm her.—I wou'd, there∣fore, have you withdraw, immediately, lest any of the family shou'd see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a right to direct me, and at your desire, I will defer my visit, for a little time, but I can have no rest, 'till I behold her.</P>
</SP>

<P>I don't fancy your meeting will contribute much, to the quiet of your mind.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace and guilt seldom cohabit, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Frampton, true—and if young men, like myself, wou'd but calculate the pains and difficulties, which are the natural consequences of vice, and how much they over-balance its transitory joys, they wou'd be shocked at a traffic, where cer∣tain loss must be the reward of their industry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>The being sensible of our errors, is the first step to amendment; for no man ever sets seri∣ously about getting out of debt, 'till he is thoroughly apprized of the vast sum he owes.—But, come, my lord, let us retire, immediately; I hear some of the family in motion—this way, quickly.</P>

<P>Never was man so embarrass'd.— <STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> I will obey my Harriet, tho' in opposition to my own judgment, which had determined me not to reveal the important secret, to Sir William, till our return into the country; lest the warmth of his re∣sentment, for what he will stile an act of disobedience, might tempt him to discover our marriage, to my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must it be ever kept a secret, then? And must we always live thus separated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means—I can make a pretence to my father, of joining my regiment, and then can I retrace those paths, that brought me first to Lan∣gwillan; and the moment I arrive there, Sir Wil∣liam shall be made acquainted, with my happiness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean to come there, soon, my lord?</P>

<P>I shou'd have been there, in a few days, if you had not come to town.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why did you not tell me so? the least hint of your design, would have prevented my coming to London.</P>

<P>Does my Harriet think I would delay my own happiness, by deferring an interview, I so ardently desired, even for an hour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can persuade me, to any thing. I ac∣quiesce, in your determination.—There is but one thing more, disturbs my mind; but that's a trifle.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can my Harriet blame me, for such a caution, meant to secure her happiness? If my fortunes only, were at stake, I shou'd now boast, what I so much endeavour to conceal, nor fear the consequence of lord Delville's resentment. The miscarriage, or interception, of a letter, sign'd your husband, wou'd precipitate the discovery of our marriage, and ruin me with my father.—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only thro' you, that I can suffer—Had my fortune been independent, I shou'd, at once, have asked you of Sir William.—Nay, situ∣ated as I am, I can forego all the advantages of wealth, without regret, and, blest with you, only lament its loss, for your dear sake.—You weep, my Harriet! Let me kiss off those tears.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to see your lordship, you have been a good while absent, from quarters—But you young men of quality, can have leave of ab∣sence, when you please, I suppose; and all you have to do, is to appear handsomely on a field day, or at a review. It was not so, in my time—But discipline, of every kind, is relaxed, now-a-days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been a truant, Sir William, but I mean to make up for lost time, and return, im∣mediately, to my regiment; and then, look to your partridge.</P>

<P>Did it mention how things go, in the Mediterranean? that is an article, which concerns us more—We shall not have a port left us, there, soon.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I speak only of domestic news, and mind no other—The paragraph, I saw, ran thus—<Q>We hear there is certainly a treaty of marriage, on foot, between lord Eustace, and lady Anne Mountfort, which will be concluded, in a few days</Q>—and then, a great deal more, my lord, about both your accomplishments, which I have forgot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never knew any thing come of a <HI>We hear,</HI> yet.—But I wish you had brought home the paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—And is that your undoubted authority, Sir William? Why, at this season of the year, when occurrences are rare, the news writers couple half the nobility, in England, to fill up their papers—But, as there are no other papers fill'd up, by the parties themselves—your marriages, in print, are not allow'd good, in law.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it highly insolent in them, my lord, to take these liberties, without authority, as such reports may sometimes happen to be prejudicial, to one party, or the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>The freedom of the press, Sir William, tho' sometimes injurious to individuals, must never be restrain'd, in this land of liberty. 'Tis the very <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, there have been some slight grounds, for the report you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I should imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Anne's large fortune was rather a desirable object, to my father—he did, therefore, propose my paying my addresses to her; but, upon my declaring, that love should be my first motive, in an engagement of that nature; and that my heart had never given me the least hint of her lady∣ship, he had the goodness to sacrifice his project, to my happiness. The affair had been whisper'd, in our family, and even whispers have echoes, Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lordship has taken more pains than was necessary, to explain this matter to us. For, tho' you shou'd not marry lady Anne, it is to be suppos'd that you'll soon marry a lady Betty, or a lady Mary, Somebody.—Such an accomplish'd young nobleman will not be suffer'd to remain long single.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir William, how can you talk, so oddly? There are many instances, of persons who have lived single, in spite of temptation, and soli∣citation, too; and that, to your certain knowledge, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, sister; I am really
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
not acquainted with any of these coy, these sensitive plants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem inclin'd to be witty, bro∣ther, and, therefore, I shall retire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should oppose the severity of that resolution, madam, but that an engagement of business, calls me away, at this moment. May I hope for your permission to wait upon you, fre∣quently, while you stay in town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lordship's visits must always be consider'd, by us, both as an honour, and an obli∣gation.</P>

<P>With what nice delicacy, and honour, has my nephew explain'd away this idle report! But I am amazed, how you could be affected with it, child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chide me, as you please, I own I deserve it, for doubting the most amiable of men. Yet when my father hinted the subject, I should have fainted, if the tenderness of my lord's looks, even more than his words, had not convinc'd me of his love and truth. Our fears are proportion'd to our treasure; you cannot, therefore, condemn my ap∣prehensions, without lessening his worth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I shall never do. Persons, of a certain rank in life, are always worthy.—But come, child, I am in a monstrous dilemma, at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I want your assistance, to calculate the distance, from Persia to America; for I have great

apprehensions that the Sophy may join the Czarina, sail down the Baltic, together, and strip us of all our settlements.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, how can you trouble yourself, with things so foreign, either to your knowledge, or interests?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon. Why, niece, now that you are married to my satisfaction, I know nothing in the domestic way, worth being concern'd for; and one's affections, you know, child, cannot lie idle—therefore, I beg you will go, immediately, and search for Salmon's Geography, which, I be∣lieve, you will find in my trunk, along with Col∣lins's Peerage, which are books, I never travel without; and which no person can pretend to keep company, without being thoroughly conversant in.</P>

<P>Prithee, Robert, was that man in the hall, my lord's valet de chambre? Of what use can he be to his master, here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of a great deal, I fancy, Sir. There are numbers of people come here, after his lord. A fine lady, just now, wanted to gain admittance, but Mr. Willis had dacity enough to make her disbe∣lieve her own senses, and persuaded her that his master was down at Bristol, tho' she said her eyes saw him come into the house. O these Londoners are cunning folk!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told me of another person, that lives here, a gentleman, I think—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, poor fellow, I believe he may be an honest man, because Willis don't seem much to like

him.—But 'tis hard to say, which is good, or bad, amongst them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>There is something very myste∣rious, in all this—I desire, Robert, that you will have as little communication, as possible, with his lordship's servants, and that you will prevent the rest of my family, from having any, also.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour need not fear.—They are not kindly to any of us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw her go up stairs, with madam Wini∣fred, as we came hither, Sir. I think, with sub∣mission, our young lady likes London, as little as either your worship, or myself; she mopes mightily, to be in the country, again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>She shan't mope long, for that, Robert, nor when she is there, neither; for I intend to settle her soon, both to her happiness, and my own, by marrying her to colonel Loyd, immediately. And when the wedding is over, and I am once more sat down safe, at Langwillan, I shall think all my troubles are at an end.—I'll go to Harriet, directly, and talk the matter over with her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>To barricade the doors, and deny admit∣ance to their friends!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>These were his lordship's orders, Sir.—Wil∣lis, says he, with an arch look, which I understand, pretty tolerably, you must be my Cerberus, and not suffer the devil, himself, to get thro' the key-hole, for a few days. But as soon as I am married, and gone off to the country, your care will be needless.—Yes, says I, to his lordship, I will then make my escape out of the gulph, leave the doors open for all the devils to enter, and pursue your lordship to the Elysian fields.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very poetical Mr. Willis.—But I fancy his lordship is rather over cautious, and that you will have no great employment, for your ex∣traordinary talents; for I don't think the family have any acquaintance, in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>More is the pity, for the girl is devilish handsome, It wou'd be a good deed to bring her a little into life.—I shou'd like to have the intro∣ducing her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop your licentious tongue!—I have al∣ready told you, that this is no common affair.—She is a young lady of unblemished character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This the old story, Mr. Frampton; I never knew a woman, in my life, who had not an unble∣mished character—till she lost it.—This fellow is turn'd puritan; he'll preach, presently—But I hope his canting will not be able to corrupt my lord.—This would be no place for me, then. I fancy he likes the girl, himself.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Willis, lord Eustace will find it a very difficult matter, to get clear of this unhappy adventure.—Sir William is a man of sense, and spirit, and the young lady has, besides, a brother, in the army, who is esteemed a brave young man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to Don Pedro, the father, I think my lord had better get commodore Loyd, to take a short walk with him, upon the quarter-deck; and, as to the young Spaniard, his lordship can't well refuse to take a bout of tilting with him, if he should insist upon it—But I have been pretty well used to things of this sort, as you know, Mr. Framp∣ton, and I never yet knew a wounded reputation cured, by a sword, or pistol—Perhaps they may think as I do, and so let the matter rest in peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd imagine their sentiments to be very different, from yours, upon this occasion.—But, pray, who is this captain Loyd, that you talk of, for Sir William's antagonist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I was out, a little—I forgot his be∣ing a Welchman, and a particular friend of the Ap Evans's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came he connected with lord Eustace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were acquainted, before the captain went to sea, and a jolly buck he was. But he has now lost his ship; and to solicit another, he is as constant, at lord Delville's levee, as an old maid at her parish church.—The simile holds farther too, for his head is cast in so peculiar a mould, that he be∣lieves every thing he hears, and repeats it as matter of fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an infinite deal of falshood, must this honest man utter, in the course of a summer's day!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will save his poor conscience, for this one day, at least, by keeping him out of our fortress.</P>
</SP>

<P>It will be more necessary for your pur∣pose, to prevent telling his truths, at present, I ima∣gine.</P>

<P>A fit one, for such an office! It is such wretches, as these, that corrupt us all; that clear the thorny paths of vice, and strew them o'er with roses.—These agents for perdition, can remove mountains that obstruct our passage, till we are sunk in the abyss of guilt, and then their weight falls on us! I would willingly persuade myself, that lord Eus∣tace is not so far gone, in baseness, as to conclude his marriage with lady Anne, and desert this amiable unfortunate. Yet can I not, at present, foresee, how it may be possible for him, to avoid it. There is some time, however, to think about it.

<P>I shou'd have as many tongues, as there are swivels on the quarter-deck, to answer such a broadside of questions; but one, at a time, I beseech you.—As to you, madam, I answer no; and to you, fair lady, yes; and as to you, Sir William, I think one need not have doubled the Cape, to be able to find out his errand, hither.

<P>That may not be quite the case, neither, Sir William.

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, Sir, it may require the in∣terest, of a person of rather more consequence, than you, to preserve it. But there are such, who are ready to interest themselves, for any one who belongs to my family; the Ap Evans's are neither unknown, nor unallied, to the nobility.</P>

<P>Not so fast, Miss Winifred, if you please; there are many people in this town, who are apt to make offer of their services, without either will, or power, to be of the least use to us.

<P>Pray now, good captain, spare your∣self that trouble, for he is one of <HI>my most intimate friends,</HI> also. It is he who has been so obliging to lend us this house, while we stay in London.</P>

<P>Why, really, madam, it is no extraor∣dinary intelligence, that he is to marry lady Anne Mounfort, for it is just as public, as the arrival of a king's ship in the Downs, or an Indiaman at Blackwall.—The news-papers tell these things, and every one in London, knows them.</P>

<P>That may be possible; but I, who am, every day, at his father's, and have seen the liveries, equipage, and jewels, brought home, for the wed∣ding, cannot easily be persuaded, that all this rigging shou'd be prepared, before there is a bottom on stocks, for it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, engag'd, to be sure; say, rather, that he has taken another frigate, in tow, to add to his squadron; I know the man, pretty well. I now recollect my having heard, some time ago, that he had some attachment, to a pretty country girl. He was a long time absent, from London.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is something, very singular, in this affair of lord Eustace.—My sister's absurdity, in denying the fact, I can account for, from the peculiar obstinacy of her character. But why should Harriet be affected with it? Her aunt's folly may have operated there, also; perhaps persuaded her, that his lordship's common address of galantry and politeness, was a profess'd declaration of passion for her. But this marriage will soon put an end to such illusion, and restore my child to her sense, and duty, again. I will, therefore, go now, and sooth, not wound her mind, with my surmises.—The soibles of youth, should be rather counteracted, than opposed, lest, in endeavouring to weed them out, we may destroy a kindred virtue.</P>

<P>I was forced to swear to the fellow who brought them, that I was Sir William's own servant; and as the devil wou'd have it, he was a Mon∣mouthshire lad, waiter at Serles's Coffee-house, and had come, on purpose, to ask a thousand imperti∣nent questions, about Gillian, and John, James, and Mary Lewellins, Ap Griffiths, Ap Owens, and the lord knows who. Then my terrors, about Robert surprizing us; but, luckily, he was out of the way, so I carried the lad to a beer-house, killed one half of his kindred, and married the other, without knowing one of the parties.</P>

<P>I am not casuist sufficient to answer you, upon that subject; but this I know, that you have already trespassed, against the laws of hospitality, and honour, in your conduct towards Sir William Evans, and his daughter.—And as your friend, and counsellor, both, I would advise you to think seriously, of repairing the injuries you have com∣mitted, and not increase your offence, by a farther violation.</P>

<P>My dear Frampton!—There's a fellow for you, that, without half a crown in his pocket, talks as much stuff, about honour, and such nonsense, as if he were a duke—They have not broke the seal, I find; that's Frampton's fault: if he had not re∣turn'd, the instant he did, I wou'd have satisfied my lord's curiosity, and my own—Well, cannot I do so, now? A good servant shou'd prevent his master's

This is a confession, indeed! for which, like all other mean-spirited, whimpering rascals, he deserves to be hanged. My lord was in the right, to look sharp, after this business—We must have been blown up, if it had come to light. But as I hope to be well paid, for the contents of this, I may let the others go free.</P>

<P>I cannot pierce thro' the mystery, in which I am involved. I strive, in vain, to recover my confidence in lord Eustace. These fatal reports unhinge my very soul—Yet nothing can abate my love. One false step has involved me, in a thousand difficulties. I can endure my situation, no longer; and let the consequence be what it may, I will reveal the secret, to my father. But then, my lord's intreaties, and my aunt's commands—why even they must be sacrificed, to filial duty—Wretch,

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he assign a cause, for coming to Lon∣don, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, 'tis as Loyd guessed, an af∣fair of galantry, but an honourable business, tho'—I long 'till ye are both married, that I may hear no more of romances. I hope, when Harry has led the way, you will have no objection to follow him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I knew who my future daughter-in-law is to be. Harry tells me she has a great for∣tune; but that, I suppose, is a sweetener—But if she has worth and virtue, sufficient to make him happy, I shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be content.—But what's the matter, Harriet? I thought your illness was quit gone off—you look as if you had been weeping—My sister, I suppose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; indeed her goodness to me, as well as yours, is graved upon my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a very odd woman—She wou'd fain persuade me, that I distressed you, by jesting with captain Loyd, about lord Eustace's mistress—I begin to think that she is in love with him, her∣self—Of what consequence are his galantries to her? I dare say he has had a hundred, of the same sort; and that the lady, to whom he is now going to offer his hand, can have but a very small remnant, of his heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard him say, Sir, they should ne∣ver be divided.</P>

<P>Fine talking, for a libertine, truly!—However, I agree with you, that it is not right, to

<P>It is you, child, that I fear will have cause to be sorry, for having mistaken his character—young women are but bad judges, of their lovers morals.</P>

<P>My aunt, Sir—</P>

<P>My future conduct, Sir, shall prove them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Harriet! What a disappointment is mine? I hoped to have seen you united to a man of sense, and worth, who wou'd have respected, as well as loved you—Instead of that, you are now joined to one, who, from his too intimate know∣ledge of the vicious part of your sex, is likely to despise them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I flatter myself, Sir, that the goodness, both of his heart, and understanding, will make him rea∣dily renounce any light errors, he may have fallen into.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>How blest am I, to be able to acquit my lord!—Tho' blushing I avow it, it was his mysteri∣ous attachment to his wife, that caus'd that vile re∣port.—O Sir! let me, again, upon my knees, entreat you to pardon what is past, and give lord Eustace leave to prove the sincerity of his affection, to me, by his respectful tenderness and gratitude, to∣ward you.</P>

<P>If your honour wou'd hear a few words, that I have to say.—</P>

<P>I cannot hear you, now; my thoughts are all engaged. <STAGE>(To himself.)</STAGE>—I must write to colonel Loyd, directly.—I shall have a sad piece of work, with the old gentleman at Trevallin—he doats upon my girl, as if she were his child.—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Sir, and so does every one, who knows her, except some of the folk in this house.—I wish, indeed I do, that we were fairly out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we shall leave it, soon—but, for the present, Robert—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour little knows what's going for∣ward, in it—such quarrelling, such high words! aye, and such fine words, too, as I ne'er heard, before; tho', if I understand them right, they have but a black meaning.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Robert, we'll talk of this, some other time.—I say, again, I am not at leisure, now.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't be easy, 'till I tell you, Sir; as I am sadly afraid there is something a plotting, against your honour, or my young mistress.—I have heard that wicked Willis talking of her, to his fellow servant.—O Sir, that fellow knows all his lord's secrets; he is at the beginning, and ending, of all mischief; and he says, as how Miss Harriet has been only impos'd upon. <STAGE>(Sir Wm. starts.)</STAGE>—Yes, Sir, impos'd upon—
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
and that his master will be married to a fine lady, in less than a month's time.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! impos'd upon! what can this mean? lord Eustace dare not think of any thing so base.—I injure both myself and him, by the sus∣picion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>All I know of the matter, is, Sir, that the gentleman that lives here (whom I believe to be a very honest man, tho' Willis calls him a poor rogue) and my lord Eustace, had a sad quarrel, and they talked so loud, that I cou'd not help overhearing Mr. Frampton—for I scorn to listen—reproaching my lord, with having behaved, very ill, both to you, and your daughter—but they were friends, after∣wards, and went out, together.—But Willis said a great deal more, to James, my lord's footman, to the same sense—and whatever mischief there is a brewing, I am sure he knows all about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot comprehend the meaning of all this.—Imposed upon!—I will be satisfied—His scoundrel servant talk of my daughter, and of his marriage with another lady!—I have not patience to wait the meeting with lord Eustace—Is that fellow in the house?—That Willis, Robert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, James and he have been taking a hearty glass, I believe; he looks pure and merry.</P>

<P>And can you think me vile enough, after such perfidy, to receive his hand? Can I vow to honour the man, whom I no longer esteem? Shall I go to the altar with him, and swear to be faithful, to a perjur'd wretch? again repeat my vows of everlasting love, for him who has abandoned, and undone me? No; I would sooner die, a thousand, thousand deaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are just as obstinate, as your fa∣ther—Now you have taken this into your head, no∣thing can get it out again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think my father could be so inhu∣man, without just grounds, to stab me to the heart? It is, it is too true!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not believe a word of it.—I never was mistaken, in my life; my brother is ever in the wrong.—I desire, Harriet, you will write to lord Eustace, directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I will not.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, positively, I will—I am deter∣min'd to know the truth, from him. I own I be∣gin to be a little doubtful, about this matter, myself. This letter may be forg'd—but those eternal reports confound me—'Tis impossible he should dare to de∣ceive me—but if he has, he shall find that the Ap Evans's are not to be injured, with impunity.</P>

<HEAD>ACT IV.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>The Park.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Capt.</HI> LOYD, <HI>and Col.</HI> EVANS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY father in London! you surprize me, captain—What can have brought him here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, as to the matter of surprize, my young hero, your father was quite as much astonish'd, at hearing of your being in the same port, as you can be; and as to your aunt Winifred, she started, with as much amazement, as the sailors that spied the first Patagonian. Your sister, indeed, seem'd more pleas'd, than any of them, at the news, and inquir'd whether I had met you in healthy condition, and if I knew your moorings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My gentle Harriet!—I am impatient to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoist sail, and away, then; I'll be your convoy, tho' I should like better to drop anchor, and take in refreshment, for an hour or so, at the Admiralty Coffee-house, where I have appointed captain Blast, of the Boreas, and some other jolly lads, to meet me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to you, captain, but will, by no means, suffer you to break your engagement.—I have a little business to dispatch, before I can see my father, and shall easily find out the house, without troubling you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that you may readily do, as it is in∣clos'd by a very high wall, and has a large hand∣some gate-way, with a bell at the door.—Aye,
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
aye, that bell was not plac'd there, to call the crew to prayers, but to prevent the neighbours from know∣ing who comes in and out, as they might do, if there was a rapper only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't see why that caution should be neces∣sary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is of no great use, at present—But time has been—Harkee me, Harry, there is a devilish storm brewing over your head; you may look for dirty weather, I can tell you—Your father is in a confounded passion, at your having quitted the regiment, and is strongly persuaded that you'll spring a leak, my boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wrote to my father, some time ago, to acquaint him with my motives; I have also written to my colonel, to account for my conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, I'll take care of you, as I am sure you did not desert, from cowardice—But it was a silly trick, Harry.—Some girl, I suppose, is in the wind; they make fools of the wisest of us.—I remember, when I was station'd at Gibraltar, a Donna Isabella—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd you were there, now: I know not how to get rid of this tiresome man.</P>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Spaniard, you may guess, by the name, had a devilish mind to come off with me, as she said, to see foreign parts—But I weigh'd anchor, slily, one moon-light night, and left the poor signiora on shore—But all men have not the gift of discretion: tho' I was a younker, then, Harry, not much turn'd of thirty, I'll assure you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it was rather cruel in you, to forsake the lady, captain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I did hear, afterwards, that there was a ballad made about it, intitled <HI>The Cruel Cap∣tain's Garland,</HI> and set to a very woeful tune—I
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
laugh at these things, Harry; but I find you are a truer lover, and have come here, in spite of wind and tide, in pursuit of your mistress—You can't expect, however, that Sir William will be highly delighted, if you shou'd happen to make a losing voyage of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, it will be the most prosperous one of my life, and I shall be able to give my father a satisfactory account, of my conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if your mistress be well freighted, a sixty thousand pounder, or so, he will have no objection, I suppose.—But come, my boy, tell me a little about it: is she maid, or widow, Harry? I like to hear love-stories, mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a maiden, young, and beautiful, and of a rank and fortune, beyond my expectation, captain. We have lov'd one another, long; her guardians are upon the point of disposing of her, to another; she has desir'd me to free her from their tyranny, and accept of her hand, as my reward—Glorious recom∣pence!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Harry! this is running before the wind, with a vengeance—Not so fast, not so fast, my boy, you go at the rate of twelve knots, an hour—This story sounds a little romantic, tho', and puts me in mind of the lady, that the flying man comes to save from the monster.—But 'tis odd enough, that I shou'd not know this lady; prithee, Harry, what's her name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must excuse my not answering that question, captain, as you might possibly become my rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, if she had applied to me, she shou'd have been far enough from her guardians, by this, we'd have run gunnel to, all the way, my
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
boy, and left them, and you on the dry land, Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall tell her of your intended galantry, captain; and I hope you and she will be better acquainted—for the present, I must wish you a good evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you have a mind to sheer off, colonel, I wish you a fair gale.—I never grapple with any thing, but a pretty lass, or an enemy; and so, your servant, your servant, colonel.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Capt.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>My meeting with this blundering sailor, was unlucky, as my father may, perhaps, be displeas'd at my not waiting on him, the moment I knew of his being in London.—But I cannot break my en∣gagement, with lady Anne—every thing must give way, to that charming woman—I will fly to her, directly, and, if possible, find time to pay my duty to my father, before I sleep.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> WINIFRED, <HI>and</HI> ROBERT.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will come, then; you have staid a great while, Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord was not at home, madam; and as you desir'd I shou'd bring an answer, I was oblig'd to wait his coming—Every thing seems in confusion, in the family; his lordship, it seems, is to be mar∣ried, in a few days; they are all packing up, and the servants scarce knew where to find pen, ink, and paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>This startles me—'Tis but too plain I have been deceived. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>—Hearken to me, Robert, and do, exactly, what I command you—go
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
and place yourself by the private door, in the gar∣den, and the moment you hear a key turn in the lock, come and tell me.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Rob.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall obey you, madam.—I am sure all is not right. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must, if possible, prevent Sir Wil∣liam's knowing of this interview—But here he comes—</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> WILLIAM.</STAGE>
<P>—I hope you have vented all your rage, brother, and that one may talk, a little calmly, to you, now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes! I have great reason to be calm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell you that a little more of your outrageous fury, wou'd have kill'd your daughter; nor do I know what fatal effect it might have had, upon my own constitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not very easily shock'd, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is more than you know, at least, brother; but a person so intirely given up to their passions, never once reflects upon consequences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had reflected upon conse∣quences; but those who have err'd themselves, are ever ready to reflect on others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with reflections, on all sides; and in case that there shou'd be any truth, in this infamous story, let us set about forming some scheme, for redressing the affront, that he has dar'd offer to our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not stand in need of your assist∣ance. I am determin'd how to act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir William, do not be head∣strong, but, for once, be advised by me.—I have thought of a scheme, and I am sure it will answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is happy for my family, that I have a little sense, brother, tho' I do not boast of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wisdom in this matter, has been conspicuous; but what new proofs of it, are we to expect, at present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose we were to send for lord Eustace, and try what effect Harriet's tears, and my reproaches, wou'd have upon him—He has always had the greatest deference, for my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your opinion!—Is this your boasted scheme?—He will not come; base as he is, it is im∣possible he cou'd endure her sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your affected sagacity is enough to set one mad—You are mistaken, as you always are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it cannot be; the consciousness of his vile treachery, will keep him far from hence.—He dare not see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot bear this contradiction. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>—For once let conviction conquer your ob∣stinacy: I wrote to him, myself, in Harriet's name; I have had his answer; he will be here, this night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And shall my daughter sue to him, for justice? implore him to receive the hand he has rejected, and the heart he has betray'd? Shall she be sacrific'd, to make his peace? I tell you, no—I will have other vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see these horrid punctilios will ruin all—If we can make up this matter quietly, what does it signify, whether he be a man of honor, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust forget, that I am one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you wou'd have a little pa∣tience, and hear me out—If this should fail, I have another project, in my head, which I am certain must succeed—My imagination has not been idle, and I think it full as active, as your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it may be rather more so—But I have no leisure, for imaginary matters, now.</P>
<STAGE>(Going.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir William, don't be so posi∣tive—you know lord Eustace has a place, at court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd, at least, let the king know what a servant he has about him; and as I may reasonably suppose that his majesty may have heard of our ancestors, tho' he knows nothing of you, Sir William, I wou'd advise you to throw yourself, at his feet—He is himself a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blest may he long be, in that honour'd title! tho' I am render'd wretched, by the name—But what can he do, for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Disgrace, and displace the man, who has wrong'd you, altho' he be a lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is his title? has he not debas'd it—But know, there is no difference of rank, before the throne—degrees of elevation, are only seen by those, who look above them: kings must look down, and therefore see all equal; and in our mo∣narch's sight, the rights, even of the meanest sub∣ject, are precious as his own—But yet he cannot heal my wrongs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I can never believe that a knight baronet is upon a par, with a lord, Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absurd distinctions! I will hear no more—The man who has the means of justice, in his own hands, and seeks for it elsewhere, deserves to be the sport of chance, and dupe of his own weakness—Then let him come, this night—I'll meet him as I ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are exactly in the same case, of the Dissidents, at Warsaw; nothing, but force of arms, will content you; and like them, too, you may be
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
undone, by it—Suppose you were to meet lord Eustace, and he shou'd kill you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not, then, out-live my honor.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>This self-will'd man distresses me, ex∣tremely—he is, for ever, disconcerting my schemes—There never was such a race of ideots, as the fa∣mily of the Ap Evans's, myself excepted—there is not a head, in this house, but my own—To be sure I have been a little over-reach'd, in this affair of the wedding; but the greatest politicians are liable to mistakes—I hope to repair all, yet, and make my niece a woman of quality, one way, or another.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks to your courage, and generosity, Sir, I have escaped unhurt. I thought our police was better conducted, than to suffer our lives to be en∣dangered, by footpads.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>These accidents are less frequent, in this country, than they used to be; but no code of laws was ever yet framed, that cou'd make all men ho∣nest.—I am extremely happy, at having come so op∣portunely, to your assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall ever be grateful, for the obligation, Sir; but may I not know to whom I am obliged?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not mention the matter as a favour, I intreat you—You wou'd, doubtless, have done the same for me; and had I happen'd to have come first, I shou'd have stood in need of your assistance—I am call'd lord Eustace.</P>

<P>I shall remain indebted to your lordship, and wish you a good night.—What a rencontre!</P>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could wish you not to leave me, Sir; 'tis late, and therefore unsafe for either of us, to re∣turn alone—The fellows who attacked you, may lye in wait for you—I shall not stay here a quarter of an hour; and as I wish to be better acquainted with you, I shou'd be glad to know your ad∣dress.</P>

<P>Your lordship has a right to command me; but I hope you will not stay longer than the time you have mention'd, as I have some business to transact, this night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be the case, I will not trespass upon you; perhaps, there may be something simi∣lar, in our circumstances; for your business, at this hour, must, in all probability, be with a lady, and you may reasonably suppose, by my being alone, and on foot, that I am come to meet one, here.</P>

<P>There is, perhaps, a jealous husband, or an old cross father, my lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither, colonel. But matches, made for interest, only, too often break the most delight∣ful ties, the union of fond hearts—The lady, who lives here, is the most amiable of her sex, and I adore her; yet, am on the point of marrying one, whom I can never love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a sad affair, indeed, my lord.—I cou'd save you a great deal of trouble, if I were at liberty to tell you lady Anne's intentions.</P>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some girl you keep, I presume, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>By no means; she is a woman of family and character—I am almost distracted about her—I will now step and see if the coast be clear, as there are some of the family, that I shou'd not chuse to en∣counter, at this late hour, and return to you, Sir, instantly—You see what confidence you have al∣ready inspired me with.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<P>A confidence, indeed! but of what use can it be to me, who am bound in honor, not to betray it? <STAGE>(Looks at his watch.)</STAGE> Bless me, it is now past eleven—the time I spent with lady Anne, stole un∣perceived away. It will certainly be too late, to go to my father's, to-night; I must defer my visit, 'till to-morrow; and as lord Eustace don't seem in a great hurry to be married, I shall have time enough to get lady Anne out of her guardian's power, and

make you mine, in an illegal manner—But here I swear, I will repair the injury.</P>

<P>What shou'd I fear, Sir William?</P>

<P>Your own base heart, and my much in∣jur'd honour; which calls upon you, now, for justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So then, I find the pride of injur'd vir∣tue, was assumed—Your daughter would secure me, by compulsion—But I despise assassins!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not, my lord, insult my patience, farther; I did not know you were without a sword: on that account, I put up mine; but know, young man, I shall not rest, till it has done me justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William, tho' I cannot pretend to justify the injuries I have done your daughter, I neither must, nor will be compell'd, to make the reparation; I shou'd, indeed, be unworthy to be∣come her husband, if fear cou'd make me so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the first hour you saw her, Sir, I shou'd have deemed you so—'Tis not your birth, young man, can varnish over vices, such as yours—Your rank renders them the more obnoxious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I readily allow myself to blame, Sir William.</P>

<P>You cannot then be base enough, to re∣fuse the sole atonement, which is now within your power—</P>

<P>I will confess I felt my heart fubdued, by Harriet's grief, and tenderness—they had more power, than armies—She might have triumphed over me, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surely do not think I mean to give my daughter to you! What! to reward your vices, with a heart like hers—to have my child become, a second time, a sacrisice to that vain idol, Title!—No, Sir, it is another kind of reparation, I demand; and I will have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>A brave man, Sir William, never thinks meanly, of another's courage; and as I know you to

be so, I hope you will not think me otherwise, if I decline your offer.</P>

<P>On what pretence, my lord? Have you not wrong'd me?</P>

<P>This is too much—But consider, Sir, you are—my Harriet's father.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That consideration wou'd brace a nerve∣less arm—But, look upon me, Sir; I am not bent be∣neath the weight of years—my mind and body both, are firm as yours; and the first shock that ever reach'd my heart, except her mother's loss, is the disgrace you have brought upon my child—The stain must be effac'd, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad my son is ignorant, of this af∣fair—Had he been here, he must have fought lord Eustace—He has, I hope, a long, and happy life, before him; mine, tho' not quite worn out, is of less value; and if I lose it, in defence of my child's honour, 'tis well disposed of.</P>

<P>So she was, or might have been, very well dispos'd of, but for your intemperance—You have managed your matters, very cleverly, to be sure—You have driven lord Eustace away, and the fa∣mily of the Ap Evans's are disgrac'd for ever.</P>

<P>Thou weak, vain, woman! whose folly has undone me, and my child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I truly, Sir William—It is her own high-flown principles, that have ruined her—My lord offered to marry her, over and over again, it seems, but she with her nonsensical, romantical no∣tions, affected to despise him, and refused to be his wife, on any terms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has she? I rejoice, to hear it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rejoice; at what! at her being a mad woman? I think, in her situation, she needed not have been so nice—It would have been much better for her, to have been lady Eustace, even against his will, than Miss Harriet Evans's, against her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How nearly pride, and meanness, are allied! You wou'd obtrude your niece, upon a man, who has abandoned, and dishonour'd her; then vainly think she might receive distinction, from a title, which force, not choice, bestowed.</P>
</SP>

<P>Brother, I neither understand logic, nor sophistry, but I am very sorry matters are as they are.

—As to Harriet, I believe it will be of no great con∣sequence, to her; she will soon break her heart, I imagine—But the scandal of this affair, will rest upon the survivors.—I don't think I shall ever be able to shew my face, at Monmouth, again.</P>

<P>Away! The moments now are too precious, to be wasted. Where is Harriet?</P>

<P>In her chamber, like a distracted wretch, tearing herself to pieces. I endeavoured to comfort her, as much as I could, by telling her how wrong she had acted, and that she might have lived to be a countess, if he had followed my advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was this the consolation you offer'd to her grief? How cou'd you be so barbarous? The proper spirit she has shewn, in refusing that worth∣less lord, has replaced her in my heart—I will go try to comfort her.</P>

<P>YOUR meeting with Sir William, was extremely unfortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I most sincerely wish we had not met; but that is past—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I suppose you think the worst is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Frampton, 'tis to come.—Sir William has insisted upon my meeting him, this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible, my lord! you must not fight him. Think on the consequences: if you should be so unhappy, as to kill the father of the woman you have highly injured, the world wou'd cer∣tainly unite against you, and drive you from society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case, I shou'd be but ill quali∣fied, for solitude, I confess.—Now, my dear Frampton, as I know you are my friend, and as I wou'd not wish any other person shou'd be acquainted with this story, I must desire you will be my second.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is much beneath a man of honour, to make professions, either of his friendship, or his courage; but, on this occasion, I must tell you, that I wou'd hazard my life, for your service, in any other cause; but I will not be concern'd, in this
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
infamous affair; and, I say, again, you must not raise your arm, against Sir William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not know how I am circum∣stanced. He has compell'd me, to this duel; said he wou'd brand me, for a coward, if I declin'd it.—What wou'd you have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—Tho' I love her, with the truest fondness, I will not wed her, upon such terms; nor suffer her to think so meanly of me, as to suppose I poorly barter'd a coward's hand, to save his worth∣less life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, consider, my lord, that let the con∣sequences of this duel, be what they may, nothing can acquit you of that justice, you owe, both to her, and yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own that I have greatly wrong'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is now within your power, to make reparation, by becoming her husband; but shou'd you deprive her of a father, she never can be united to the man who kill'd him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not kill him, Frampton—Urge me, no farther—My mind is torn to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, my lord, you are not in a right course, to heal it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter; you have refus'd to be a witness of my conduct, Mr. Frampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do so, still: I never had the least reason to doubt your bravery; and as this is an affair, in which only principals can be concern'd, I hope it will be no imputation, upon mine, if I decline seeing your lordship engaged in a strife, where I cannot wish you success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not press you; but have yet a request to make.</P>

<P>Name it, my lord.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ld Eust.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I should fall, deliver this letter, to my father; and—if there be any circumstance of my misconduct, left untold, which may do Harriet justice, inform him of it, fully.—I must now go seek, for a less cautious friend, than Mr. Frampton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fram.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lordship will scarcely ever find a sincerer. <HI>(Exit lord Eustace.)</HI> Of what opposite qua∣lities, is this young man compounded? What a mixture, of good, and evil! But are we not all made of the same materials? The devil himself cannot always mislead a man, that has principles; they will recur, in spite of him, and make their owner act rightly, upon trying occasions.—This letter to his father, shews him to be a man of honor.—Something must be done, to preserve him.—I cannot give him up.—An experiment, tho' a hazardous one, must be made, directly.</P>

<P>No, I will hope no more—What shou'd I hope?—My pride, my reason might have scorn'd him, living, but I will love him, and lament him,

dead?—Wou'd I had died, the hour before I listen'd to your counsel, and set at nought, the au∣thority of my father.—Your cruel kindness has undone me.</P>

<P>Forgive, and pity my distraction, madam! 'Tis I that have brought ruin, on ye all—But if you ever loved me, think of some means, to find my brother out: he may prevent this duel, and save me from the lowest depth of misery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, child, you are extremely ignorant; you talk as if you were at Mohmouth, where our family are known, and properly respected—but in such a place as London, it may possibly be as difficult, to find out an Ap Evans, as any of those mushroom gentry, whose <HI>Table</HI> does not con∣tain above three generations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest aunt, do not place bars before my only hope; let all our servants be sent out to seek him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, child, if it will make you easy, they shall go, directly; tho' I am of opinion it will be but a fruitless inquiry. But the being too easily prevail'd upon, is my greatest foible—I wish I had a little of Sir William's obstinacy, about me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, madam, I am on the rack; do not lose time, I beg of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Win.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, be composed, I will send them; they shall search all the genteel coffee-houses, at the West end of the town—it is impossible he shou'd be in the city.—But don't let your father know, that I told you of the duel: he thinks women are never to be trusted with any thing; and has no

more respect for the empress-queen, or the czarina that I have for a county justice.</P>

<P>I have crouded all the sail I cou'd make, to come up with you, baronet; and now that I am here, I should be glad to know, in what soundings we are, and whether we are to steer starboard, or larboard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>My letter, I believe, captain, must have given you to understand the reason, of my desiring to see you; at present, I am unhappily engaged, in a duel, and the opinion I have, both of your bravery, and friendship, made me look upon you as the pro∣perest person of my acquaintance, to be my second.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that matter, Sir William, I think, I have discharged as many broadsides, as any gentle∣man in the navy—tho' I never yet drew a trigger, out of the line; but powder and ball, I suppose, do pretty much the same execution, by land, as by sea; tho' standing fair to the windward, is, sometimes, of great use to us, baronet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is of little consequence, which way the wind sits, at present, captain.</P>

<P>I can't say much to that, Sir William.—But I wish you had acquainted me with this business, a day or two ago, I shou'd have lik'd to have made a little will—But, 'tis no great matter, neither—For if I should pop over, you daughter's husband will be my heir.</P>

<P>There is not the least occasion, for that precaution, captain, as your life will not be endan∣ger'd.</P>

<P>How so? When the ship is once engaged, must not every man aboard her, fight? All but the chaplain, and he shou'd be busy, in his way, too.</P>

<P>In this case, my friend, you need be no farther concern'd, than to see that the laws of honor, are not violated.</P>

<P>Hold, hold, Sir William! this may do, for some of your fresh water sparks, but Jerry Loyd will never lie to, when the signal's given for chace—no lug-sail work, for me; I shall come pouring down upon them.—But, pray, who is your antago∣nist? And what is the cause of your quarrel? Was it a drunken business?—I was pretty jolly, my∣self, last night, but don't remember that I had words, with any one, except the waiter.</P>

<P>Well! if that is not the case, I don't know what it is. For I think you are not quarrelsome, when you are sober.—But have you breakfasted? Tho' you may have no great appetite, my stomach has been ready for a mess, this half hour, I can tell you.</P>

<P>You must give me leave to speak, then—When I saw the distress, and anxiety of your mind, I was fully satisfied of your honourable intentions, towards this lady, from the letter you entrusted me with, which yet remains unopened.—I determin'd, if possible, to preserve both your life, and honour, for her sake, by preventing your duel, with her fa∣ther, and your marriage, with lady Anne Mount∣fort.</P>

<P>The first event, Sir, has been prevented, without your assistance, and I will venture to promise, that the second shall never take place.</P>

<P>I am quite of your opinion, Sir. As I came, this moment from lord Delville, to acknow∣ledge this fair lady, as his son's wife—but this letter Sir William, will more fully explain his lordship's sentiments.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Delville has behav'd, like a man of honour; but yet I must inform you, Sir, that the generosity of his conduct, cannot efface the baseness of his son—My daughter shall never be his wife—He has disgrac'd her.</P>

<P>It cannot be, my lord—Tho' I have the highest sense of gratitude, for lord Delville's good∣ness to me, and tho' I believe you perfectly sincere, in what you say, at present; yet the humiliating situ∣ation, into which you have plunged me, the distress you have brought upon my family, your attachment to another lady——</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, Written by the Author of the PROLOGUE, And Spoken by Mrs. CLIVE.</HEAD>
<L>I LONG to know, dread Sirs, with due submission,</L>
<L>How you approve me, as a <HI>politician?</HI></L>
<L>The thought was mine.—I told the scrib'ling dame,</L>
<L>This part of <HI>Winifred,</HI> is much too tame;</L>
<L>Ask but the town, said I, they'll all agree,</L>
<L>That a <HI>tame</HI> character, will not suit <HI>me:</HI></L>
<L>I hate such lifeless, water-gruel stuff;</L>
<L>Quicken her well, with politicks, and snuff:</L>
<L>Small quantities of both, will be but teizing;</L>
<L>Give them enough, and set the town a sneezing.</L>
<L>Her scribbling vanity at this was stung;</L>
<L>Would have disputed—Hold, says I, you're wrong,</L>
<L>Don't be so rash, to draw on <HI>me,</HI> your tongue;</L>
<L><HI>I have a weapon,</HI> should I take the field,</L>
<L><HI>A better, never did a woman wield;</HI></L>
<L>You'll find, when once my passion is afloat,</L>
<L>The soul of <HI>Caesar,</HI> in a petticoat!</L>
<L>"Aye, but," says she, "in politicks there's danger,</L>
<L>"To courts, and state affairs, I'm quite a stranger."</L>
<L>So much the better, thou most simple woman,</L>
<L>Blunders, in politicks, are not uncommon.</L>
<L>When you mistake, the town will think you clever,</L>
<L>Think that you mean great folks, and clap, for ever;</L>
<L><HI>Old England,</HI> like a boy, loves wicked fun,</L>
<L>Abuse your betters, and your work is done.</L>
<L>Small game the English spirit will not follow,</L>
<L>'Tis at the nobler chace, you whoop, and hollow!</L>
<L>O'er hedge, and ditch, you helter skelter fly.</L>
<L>Start but a <HI>statesman—</HI>Yoax! the hounds full cry!</L>
<L>To pick up lesser game, you will not stay,</L>
<L>While the <HI>fox</HI> runs, the <HI>hare</HI> may steal away;</L>
<L>Our auth'ress is the <HI>hare—</HI>who trembling sits,</L>
<L>'Till she escapes this dreadful <HI>pack of wits;</HI></L>
<L>She hopes you will not hunt her, she's so small,</L>
<L>But <HI>hark</HI> to mercy, as the noblest call.</L>

<HEAD>AN EPILOGUE, Written by HENRY JAMES PYE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WELL! after much perplexity and rout,</L>
<L>At length the wished-for wedding's brought about.</L>
<L>A foolish girl! so near to throw away</L>
<L>Love, rank, and reputation, in a day.</L>
<L>And all for what? from prejudice, in truth,</L>
<L>Tho' christened delicacy, now, forsooth.</L>
<L>If (sentimental nonsense thrown aside)</L>
<L>To cards, and politics, she had applied,</L>
<L>For common cares, her soul had been too great,</L>
<L>And only felt an ardor, for the state;</L>
<L>Had glow'd alone with freedom's glorious flame,</L>
<L>And next to PAM's, had honour'd PAOLI's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Twice in our annals, baffled France and Spain</L>
<L>Have wept the glories of a female reign:</L>
<L>With great success I think we now might try</L>
<L>The influence of a female ministry.</L>
<L>In private life how well we're used to sway,</L>
<L>More husbands know, than you'll persuade to say;</L>
<L>And how finances properly to rule,</L>
<L>All ladies learn, who ever kept a pool.</L>
<L>Ye generous spirits, who approve my plan,</L>
<L>And wish at least an equal sway with man,</L>
<L>(And some malicious wits so bold we find,</L>
<L>To say this comprehends all woman-kind)</L>
<L>In favour of a female bard, to-night,</L>
<L>Boldly assert <HI>a Briton's dearest right;</HI></L>
<L>From man, from haughty man's tyrannic laws,</L>
<L>To your decision she submits her cause;</L>
<L>Rests, on your candor, all her hopes and fears,</L>
<L>And only claims<HI>—a Trial by her Peers.</HI></L>
