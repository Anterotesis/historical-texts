<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Piece was performed last Sum∣mer at RANELAGH; but, though very much approved by the best Judges of Musical Composition, by being performed in an Orchestra, lost the better Part of its Effect.</P>
<P>It was thought it would please more in Action upon the Theatre; and with the Addition of a new Scene and Chorus, and a <HI>Ballet</HI> suitable to the Subject; is now, accordingly, once more presented to the Public, with the necessary Advantages of Dresses and Decorations.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>The Music is composed by Mr. DIBDIN, who has already had the Honour to be particularly distinguished by the Public, for his Songs in the PADLOCK, and the JUBILEE: it is presumed, he has been at least as happy in this, as in any of his former Compositions. As to the Words, being calculated merely for the Use of the Composer, the Author hopes, in that Light only they will be considered.</P>
