<L>DIstant to southern climes the sloping sun</L>
<L>Hastens to bend his rays beyond the line,</L>
<L>Where Sagittary puts his armour on,</L>
<L>Slung is the quiver, where his arrows shine;</L>
<L>His azure bow reflects the solar beam,</L>
<L>While his bright darts across th' horizon gleam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now first, the woodcock, near the gelid stream,</L>
<L>Seeks his known haunt, amid th' embrowned copse,</L>
<L>Where cruel fowlers take their deadly aim,</L>
<L>Inglorious triumph! see, the victim drops!—</L>
<L>Forbear your savage sport—oh! spare, ye swains,</L>
<L>The new adventurers on Britannia's plains!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now sharper bites the hyperborean blast,</L>
<L>While eager morning chills us at the dawn,</L>
<L>With drizzling sleet the sky is overcast,</L>
<L>And the white frost bespangles o'er the lawn,</L>
<L>The well-napp'd drugget cloaths the rural folk,</L>
<L>And homely cots display a thicker smoke.</L>

<L>Come, Myra, since the woods have lost their shade,</L>
<L>Since undelighting are the hills and plains,</L>
<L>Quit we the villas, while their glories fade,</L>
<L>To seek the town, where gayer pleasure reigns;</L>
<L>But if the villas still delight my fair,</L>
<L>Welcome the howling grove, and brumal air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She, like Content, can bless the barren heath,</L>
<L>Her presence bids the shaggy mount be smooth,</L>
<L>For where she treads fresh herbage springs beneath,</L>
<L>And Myrtles blow in spite of Winter's tooth;</L>
<L>The rugged North, acknowledging her charms,</L>
<L>Suspends his anger, and his blast disarms.</L>

<HEAD>NOVEMBER. A PASTORAL ELEGY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHat means, honest shepherd, this cloud on thy brow?</L>
<L>Say, where is thy mirth and thy melody now?</L>
<L>Thy pipe thrown aside, and thy looks full of thought!</L>
<L>As silent and sad as a bird newly caught.</L>
<L>Has any misfortune befallen thy flocks?</L>
<L>Any lambs been betray'd by the craft of the fox?</L>
<L>Or murrain, more fatal, just seiz'd on thy herd?</L>
<L>Or has thy dear Phillis let slip a cross word?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The season indeed may to musing incline,</L>
<L>Now that grey-bearded Winter makes Autumn re∣sign;</L>
<L>The hills all around us their russet put on,</L>
<L>And the skies seem in mourning for loss of the sun:</L>
<L>The winds make the tree, where you sit, shake its head;</L>
<L>Yet tho' with dry leaves mother Earth's lap is spread,</L>
<L>Her bosom to cheer us is verdant with wheat,</L>
<L>And the woods can supply us both pastime and meat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, no, says the shepherd, I mourn none of these,</L>
<L>Content with such changes as heaven shall please!</L>
<L>Tho' now we have got the wrong side of the year,</L>
<L>'Twill turn up again, and fresh beauties appear:</L>
<L>But the loss that I grieve for, no time can restore—</L>
<L>Our master, who lov'd us so well, is no more;</L>
<L>That oak, which we hop'd would long shelter us all,</L>
<L>Is fallen; then well may we shake at its fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>Where find we a Pastor so kind and so good,</L>
<L>So careful to feed us with wholesomest food?</L>
<L>To watch for our safety, and drive far away</L>
<L>The sly prowling fox, always lurking for prey?</L>
<L>O, may his remembrance for ever remain,</L>
<L>To shame those hard shepherds who, mindful of gain,</L>
<L>Only look at their sheep with an eye to their fleece,</L>
<L>And watch them no more than the fox watch'd the geese!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whom now shall I chuse for the judge of my song?</L>
<L>Or must my poor pipe on the willow be hung?</L>
<L>No more to commend that good-nature and sense,</L>
<L>Which always could please, but ne'er once give of∣fence.</L>
<L>What honour directed, he firmly pursued,</L>
<L>Yet would not his judgment on others obtrude:</L>
<L>Still ready to help with his service and vote;</L>
<L>But ne'er to thrust oar in another man's boat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more, honest shepherd, these sorrows resound;</L>
<L>The virtues thou praisest, so hard to be found,</L>
<L>Are yet not all fled—for the swain who succeeds</L>
<L>To his fields and his herds, is true heir to his deeds:</L>
<L>His pattern he'll follow, his gentleness use,</L>
<L>Take care of the shepherds, and cherish the muse;</L>
<L>Then cease for the dead thy impertinent care;</L>
<L>Rejoice—he revives in his brother and heir.</L>

<L>WHen our great Lord at Emmaus appear'd,</L>
<L>Expounding what the prophets had averr'd,</L>
<L>And when he vanish'd from his hearer's eyes,</L>
<L>To meet the Father in his native skies,</L>
<L>How was each heart with sudden heat inspir'd,</L>
<L>With rapture seiz'd, and grace seraphic fir'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce fainter transports all my powers controul,</L>
<L>Glow in my breast, and triumph in my soul;</L>
<L>So strongly Rochester attracts the sense,</L>
<L>And binds with every chain of eloquence:</L>
<L>How can my ecstasies in verse be shown,</L>
<L>This asks the tongue of angels—or his own;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Let Nature's rival Art her tints apply,</L>
<L>The silent poetry of painting try;</L>
<L>To the stretch'd canvas graceful vigour give,</L>
<L>And teach the animated form to live,</L>
<L>To thought add figure, to ideas frame,</L>
<L>And to bright sentiment a robe of flame,</L>
<L>So may succeeding times the merit raise,</L>
<L>And as upon the breathing piece they gaze,</L>
<L>At once the prelate and the painter praise.</L>
<L>Here, artist, here, the powerful preacher show,</L>
<L>And let electrified attention glow,</L>
<L>Catch the bright flames which from his lips distill,</L>
<L>And strike out all the teacher with thy quill;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! couldst thou, echo-like, his words repeat,</L>
<L>Soft as the dews of heaven, as honey sweet,</L>
<L>Severest truths, so forcibly exprest,</L>
<L>And manly sense in easy language drest,</L>
<L>Couldst thou, like his, a voice melodious join,</L>
<L>As soft, as clear, as powerful, and divine,</L>
<L>Couldst thou,—but oh nor words nor colours can,</L>
<L>By sounds, or painting, typify the man.</L>

<L>So Athens once on her fam'd preacher hung,</L>

<L>Those Greek and Roman bards, of old admir'd,</L>
<L>Who, with poetic fury nobly fir'd,</L>
<L>On every subject dar'd their genius try,</L>
<L>And drank the Heliconian fountain dry,</L>
<L>Left Nothing to be sung in times to comes;</L>
<L>Nothing escap'd the wits of Greece and Rome.</L>
<L>When the fierce Goths did war with learning wage,</L>
<L>And ravag'd Italy with barbarous rage,</L>
<L>When all things good and great one ruin shar'd,</L>
<L>Nothing by Goths was honour'd—Nothing spar'd.</L>

<L>Nothing to prize, philosophers profess</L>

<L>Enwrapp'd in clouds of sulphurous smoke they tire</L>
<L>The stubborn brass, and ply the torturing fire,</L>
<L>And, big with expectation night and day,</L>
<L>Melt all their time, and all their lands away:</L>
<L>Of all this charge and toil compute the gains—</L>
<L>Nothing excites their hopes—Nothing rewards their pains.—</L>
<L>Nothing is fairer than the morning light,</L>

<L>Nothing is milder than th' approach of Spring,</L>
<L>That makes all nature smile, the whole creation sing!</L>
<L>Far as the earth, and air, and seas extend,</L>
<L>Nothing's without beginning, without end—</L>
<L>Beyond the universe it finds a place,</L>
<L>And Nothing fills the mighty void of space.</L>
<L>On Nothing turn the lucid orbs above,</L>
<L>Where all the stars in mystic order move:</L>

<L>I'll sing you a ballad—O, that it were merry,</L>

<L>Who to the same tune took a trip to Down-hall.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>My ballad is not, full soon you will know it,</L>

<L>The worst thing I ever observ'd in this Rattle,</L>

<L>Methinks even now I view some free design,</L>

<Q>Love, who can thy power controul?</Q>

<L>RIchard! of all mankind the most complete,</L>
<L>Plump as a partridge, and as sugar sweet,</L>
<L>Thy breath is fragrant as the new-mown hay,</L>
<L>Thy roguish eyes have stole my heart away,</L>
<L>Thy dunghills mounts of sweet perfumes appear,</L>
<L>Thy hogs grunt music to my love-sick ear;</L>
<L>Where'er you tread a fragrant odour flies,</L>
<L>Sweet as the vapour from the sweetest pies.</L>
<L>On Sunday last it was you threw me down,</L>

<L>And slapt your face—ah! faith I wish I could;</L>

<L>Nor could I move, tho' I'd been hugg'd to death:</L>

<L>But has been broiling in my flaming breast;</L>
<L>Since that sweet time I neither sleep nor eat,</L>
<L>I spoil my puddings, and I burn my meat.</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MARY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THis morn, when at the inn I'd sold my hay,</L>

<L>Your eyes so soft, so delicately round,</L>

<L>The jet black plumbs their heighten'd lustre owe</L>

<L>If Molly at the table was not plac'd:</L>

<L>Love is a flame—indeed 'tis very hot;</L>
<L>How my blood boils, like water in a pot?</L>
<L>My inward pain my pale complexion speaks,</L>

<L>I'd fly to thee, my love—but Dobbin's lame,</L>
<L>Oh fate, thou lov'st at me thy darts to aim!</L>

<L>My father calls—one word, and then adieu—</L>

<L>While Hebe, Minerva, and twenty to boot,</L>
<L>With gifts all celestial have trick'd me her out.</L>
<L>Now marriage, my lord, the whole charm would de∣stroy,</L>

<L>HOW have I heard the fair lament</L>
<L>Mans falsehood, and their wretched fate?</L>
<L>How few are with their spouse content,</L>
<L>Or constant to their sighing mate?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How seldom souls below are join'd,</L>
<L>For one another form'd above?</L>
<L>How seldom pairs of hearts we find,</L>
<L>By heaven ordain'd for mutual love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus man's inconstant soul we blame,</L>
<L>For want of knowledge, or of thought,</L>
<L>When all the while, 'tis in the frame</L>
<L>Of both their bodies lies the fault.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Jove had made this little ball,</L>
<L>For four-legg'd beasts, and creeping things,</L>
<L>At length he form'd, to govern all,</L>
<L>A two-legg'd creature without wings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Millions of these he made at once,</L>
<L>To save himself all further trouble,</L>
<L>And men and women, for the nonce,</L>
<L>By pairs, like tallies, he made double.</L>

<L>Then from Olympus dreadful top,</L>
<L>Well shaken in a bag together,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some fell in Asia, some in Greece,</L>
<L>In England some, and some in Spain,</L>
<L>But seldom two of the same piece,</L>
<L>In the same climate met again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence men, who grown to riper years,</L>
<L>Remembring this their former making,</L>
<L>Hunt up and down to find their peers,</L>
<L>And women too in the same taking.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some prove too short, and some too tall,</L>
<L>This is too big, and that too little,</L>
<L>A fault they're sure to find in all,</L>
<L>Few ever tally to a tittle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By chance a pair may meet and love,</L>
<L>And spend their lives in bliss together,</L>
<L>But when they tumbled from above,</L>
<L>It must be mighty temperate weather.</L>

<L>And the flock, in return, the Lord always confess</L>
<L>In plenty their joy, and their hope in distress:</L>
<L>He beholds in our welfare his glory display'd,</L>
<L>And we find ourselves blest in obedience repay'd:</L>
<L>With a cheerful regard, we attend to his ways,</L>
<L>Our attention is prayer, and our cheerfulness praise.</L>
<L>The Lord is my shepherd; what then shall I fear?</L>
<L>What danger can frighten me while he is near?</L>
<L>Not when the time calls me to walk thro' the vale</L>
<L>Of the shadow of death, shall my heart ever fail;</L>
<L>Tho' afraid, of myself, to pursue the dark way,</L>
<L>Thy rod, and thy staff, be my comfort and stay;</L>
<L>For I know, by thy guidance, when once it is past,</L>
<L>To a fountain of life it will bring me at last.</L>
<L>The lord is become my salvation and song,</L>
<L>His blessing shall follow me all my life long!</L>
<L>Whatsoever condition he places me in,</L>
<L>I am sure 'tis the best it could ever have been:</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="120"/>For the Lord he is good, and his mercies are sure;</L>
<L>He only afflicts us in order to cure:</L>
<L>The Lord will I praise while I have any breath;</L>
<L>Be content all my life, and resign'd at my death.</L>

<Q>—Nomen inane, vale.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<L>FRiendship, adieu! thou dear, deceitful good,</L>
<L>So much profess'd, so little understood:</L>
<L>How often, to thy sacred injur'd name,</L>
<L>A thousand vain pretenders lay their claim?</L>
<L>Like flies, attend the summer of our day,</L>
<L>And in the sun-beams of our fortunes play;</L>
<L>But when life's winter-evening shades come on,</L>
<L>Soon we behold the treacherous insects gone,</L>
<L>And find ourselves at once deserted and undone.</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE TO THE DISTRESSED MOTHER, ACTED IN THE COUNTRY TO RAISE MONEY, IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE A DEBTOR FROM PRISON.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY P.W.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>WIde o'er the world Misfortune bears her sway,</L>
<L>Nor holds a feeble empire of a day:</L>
<L>Bound by no limits, or of place or time,</L>
<L>In every age she reigns, and every clime.</L>
<L>Kings at her will must quit their antient throne,</L>
<L>To roam in exile, or in chains to groan;</L>
<L>The widow'd princess, and her captive boy,</L>
<L>In foreign lands lament their native Troy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think not she claims alone the regal feat,</L>
<L>And none can be unhappy but the great;</L>
<L>With fatal bow, still bent and aim'd at all,</L>
<L>She sees promiscuous victims round her fall;</L>
<L>Plants in each heart the rankling shaft of woe,</L>
<L>Bids from each eye the gush of sorrow flow:</L>
<L>Yet fair Compassion, heaven-instructed maid,</L>
<L>For ever waits to lend her soothing aid;</L>
<L>With lenient hand propitious balm bestows,</L>
<L>Calms the vex'd mind, and breathes divine repose.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
<L>Such in your breasts now glow the generous fires,</L>
<L>Which pity kindles, or desert inspires:</L>
<L>Warm with like zeal your efforts now agree,</L>
<L>Not without law, to set the prisoner free.</L>
<L>Long time, immur'd within yon dreary room,</L>
<L>His days were sadden'd with perpetual gloom;</L>
<L>Estrang'd to him, howe'er the seasons ran,</L>
<L>The face of nature, as the face of man:</L>
<L>By you restor'd, forgot his former pain,</L>
<L>He mingles in the cheerful world again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor as he is, your bounty to repay,</L>
<L>His prayers may thank you in the noblest way.</L>
<L>To you, the circle of the kind and good,</L>
<L>Sincere he vows unceasing gratitude;</L>
<L>His failings and his griefs alike unknown,</L>
<L>Love, freedom, health, and peace be all your own;</L>
<L>Eternal blessings on your steps attend,</L>
<L>Who prove, this night, the poor man's, prisoner's friend.</L>

<HEAD>AN EVENING HYMN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR THOMAS BROWN, AUTHOR OF RELIGIO MEDICI.</BYLINE>
<L>THE night is come, like to the day,</L>
<L>Depart not thou, great God, away;</L>
<L>Let not my sins, black as the night,</L>
<L>Eclipse the lustre of thy light:</L>
<L>Keep still in my horizon, for to me</L>
<L>The sun makes not the day, but thee.</L>
<L>Thou, whose nature cannot sleep,</L>
<L>On my temples centry keep;</L>
<L>Guard me 'gainst those watchful foes,</L>
<L>Whose eyes are open while mine close.</L>
<L>Let no dreams my head infest,</L>
<L>But such as Jacob's temples blest.</L>
<L>While I do rest, my soul advance,</L>
<L>And make my sleep an holy trance;</L>
<L>That I may, my rest being wrought,</L>
<L>Awake into some holy thought;</L>
<L>And with as active vigour run</L>
<L>My course, as doth the nimble sun.</L>
<L>Sleep is a death; O make me try,</L>
<L>By sleeping, what it is to die:</L>
<L>And as gently lay my head</L>
<L>On my grave, as now my hed.</L>
<L><PB N="122" REF="124"/>Howe'er I rest, great God, let me</L>
<L>Awake again at last with thee:</L>
<L>And thus assur'd, behold I lie</L>
<L>Securely, or to wake or die.</L>
<L>These are my drowsy days; in vain</L>
<L>I now do wake, to sleep again;</L>
<L>O come that hour, when I shall never</L>
<L>Sleep again, but wake for ever.</L>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="poem">
<HEAD>A THOUGHT AT WAKING.</HEAD>
<L>THat morning too will dawn, when I shall rise</L>
<L>Fresh from the dust, and soaring seek the skies;</L>
<L>Then why should I lament that night draws on;</L>
<L>And, tir'd, refuse to lay my burthen down?</L>
<L>Tho' others more, yet I enough have seen,</L>
<L>And guess what is to be, by what hath been.</L>
<L>And since my youthful days, now almost past,</L>
<L>Have pleas'd so little, welcome thou my last.</L>
<L>'Tis the least care, of all that fills this head,</L>
<L>What men design when I have stole to bed.</L>
<L>Closing my eyes, the world I now enclose,</L>
<L>And Fancy, waking, murthers my repose;</L>
<L>But in the grave, the house of rich and poor,</L>
<L>Fast I shall sleep, and dream of life no more.</L>
