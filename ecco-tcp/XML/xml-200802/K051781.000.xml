<P>Antonio, Lopez tells me he left you chaunt∣ing before our door—was my father wak'd?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I told you that to morrow was the day fix'd by Don Pedro and Clara's unnatural step-mother, for her to enter a convent, in order that her brat might possess her fortune, made desperate by this, I procur'd a key to the door, and birb'd Clara's maid to leave it unbolted; at two this morning I en∣tered, unperceived, and stole to her chamber—I found her waking and weeping.</P>

<P>Surely, sir, my sister's inclinations should be consulted in a matter of this kind, and some regard paid to Don Antonio, being my particular friend.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jerome.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I must confess I had a great affecti∣on for your mother's ducats, but that was all, boy—I married her for her fortune, and she took me in obe∣dience to her father, and a very happy couple we were—we never expected any love from one another, and so we were never disappointed—If we grumbled a little now and then, it was soon over, for we were never fond enough to quarrel, and when the good wo∣man died, why, why—I had as lieve she had lived, and I wish every widower in Seville could say the same—I shall now go and get the key of this dress∣ing room—So, good son, if you have any lecture in

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear indeed, my friend Antonio, has little to hope for—however Louisa has firmness, and my fa∣ther's anger will probably only increase her affection—In our intercourse with the world, it is natural for us to dislike those who are innocently the cause of our distress; but in the heart's attachment, a woman ne∣ver likes a man with ardour till she has suffered for his sake <STAGE>[Noise]</STAGE> Soh! what bustle is here! between my father and the Duenna too—I'll e'en get out of the way. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Well, sir, since you have forced that let∣ter from me, and discovered my real sentiments, I scorn to renounce 'em—I am Antonio's friend, and it was my intention that your daughter should have serv'd you as all such old tyrannical sots should be serv'd—I delight in the tender passions, and would be∣friend all under their influence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jerome.</SPEAKER>
<P>The tender passions! yes, they would be∣come those impenetrable features—why, thou deceit∣ful hag!

<P>How! have I neither sense nor taste? If a fair skin, fine eyes, teeth of ivory, with a lovely bloom, and a delicate shape—if these, with a hea∣venly voice, and a world of grace, are not charms, I know not what you call beautiful.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isaac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good lack, with what eyes a father sees! As I have life, she is the very reverse of all this, as for the dimity skin you told me of, I swear 'tis a thorough nankeen as ever I saw; for her eyes, their utmost merit is in not squinting—for her teeth, where there is one of ivory; its neighbour is pure ebony, black and white alternately, just like the keys of an harpsicord. Then as to her singing, and heavenly voice—by this hand, she has a shrill crack'd pipe, that sounds for all the world like a child's trumpet.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lopez.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth, Sir, I could not—that she was run away from her father, was in every body's mouth,—and that Don Guzman was in pursuit of her, was also a very common report—where she was gone, or what was become of her, no one could take upon 'em to say.</P>
