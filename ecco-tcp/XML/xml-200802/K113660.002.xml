<ARGUMENT>
<P>The history of a philosophic vagabond, pursuing novelty, but losing content.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER we had supped, Mrs. Arnold politely offered to send a couple of her footmen for my son's baggage, which he at first seemed to decline; but upon her pressing the request, he was obliged to inform her, that a stick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boast of. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, aye my son,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you have seen a great deal of the world."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> replied my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but travel∣ling after fortune, is not the way to se∣cure
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
her; and, indeed, of late, I have desisted from the pursuit."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, Sir,"</Q> cried Mrs. Arnold, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the ac∣count of your adventures would be amu∣sing: the first part of them I have often heard from my niece; but could the company prevail for the rest, it would be an additional obligation."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can promise you the pleasure you have in hearing, will not be half so great as my vanity in the recital; and yet in the whole narrative I can scarce promise you one adventure, as my account is not of what I did, but what I saw. The first misfortune of my life, which you all know, was great; but tho' it distrest, it could not sink me. No person ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The less kind I found fortune then, the more I expected from her another time, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift, but could not depress me. I proceeded, therefore, towards London in a fine
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
morning, no way uneasy about to-mor∣row, but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road. I comforted myself with various reflections, that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward.<P>"Upon my arrival in town, Sir, my first care was to deliver your letter of recom∣mendation to our cousin, who was himself in little better circumstances than me. My first scheme, you know, Sir, was to be usher at an academy, and I asked his advice on the affair. Our cousin received the proposal with a true Sardonic grin. Aye, cried he, this is a pretty career, indeed, that has been chalked out for you. I have been once an usher at a boarding school myself; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was brow-beat by the master, hated for my ugly face by the mis∣tress,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
worried by the boys within, and never permitted to stir out to meet civility abroad. But are you sure you are fit for a school? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the business? No. Then you won't do for a school. Can you dress the boys hair? No. Then you won't do for a school. Have you had the small-pox? No. Then you won't do for a school. Can you lie three in a bed? No. Then you will never do for a school. Have you got a good stomach? Yes. Then you will by no means do for a school. No, Sir, if you are for a genteel easy profession, bind yourself seven years as an ap∣prentice to turn a cutler's wheel; but avoid a school by any means. But come, continued he, I see you are a lad of spi∣rit and some learning, what do you think of commencing author, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius starving at the trade: but at pre∣sent I'll shew you forty very dull fellows
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
about town that live by it in opulence. All honest jogg trotmen, who go on smoothly and dully, and write history and politics, and are praised; and who, had they been bred coblers, would all their lives have only mended shoes, but never made them.</P>
<P>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an usher, I resolved to accept his proposal; and having the highest respect for litera∣ture, I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub-street with reverence. I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dry∣den and Otway trod before me. In fact, I considered the goddess of this region as the parent of excellence; and how∣ever an intercourse with the world might give us good sense, the poverty she grant∣ed was the nurse of genius! Big with these reflections, I sate down, and find∣ing that the best things remained to be said on the wrong side, I resolved to write
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
a book that should be wholly new. I therefore drest up three paradoxes with some ingenuity. They were false, in∣deed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been so often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but some splendid things that at a distance looked every bit as well. Wit∣ness you powers what fancied importance sate perched upon my quill while I was writing. The whole learned world, I made no doubt, would rise to oppose my systems; but then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world. Like the porcupine I sate self collected, with a quill pointed against every opposer."</P></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well said, my boy,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and what subject did you treat upon? I hope you did not pass over the importance of Hierardical monogamy. But I inter∣rupt, go on; you published your para∣doxes; well, and what did the learned world say to your paradoxes?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied my son," <Q REND="inline margQuotes">the learned world said nothing to my paradoxes; nothing at all, Sir. Every man of them was employed in praising his friends and himself, or condemning his enemies; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I suffered the cruellest mortifi∣cation," neglect. <P>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-house on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed himself in the box before me, and after some preliminary discourse, finding me to be a scholar, drew out a bundle of proposals, begging me to subscribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand necessarily produced a reply that that I had no money; and that conces∣sion led him on to enquire into the na∣ture of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were just as great as my purse, I see, cried he, you are unac∣quainted
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
with the town, I'll teach you a part of it. Look at these proposals, upon these very proposals I have sub∣sisted very comfortably for twelve years. The moment a nobleman returns from his travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from her country seat, I strike for a subscription. I first besiege their hearts with flattery, and then pour in my proposals at the breach. If they subscribe readily the first time, I renew my request to beg a dedication fee. If they let me have that, I smite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus, continued he, I live by vanity, and laugh at it. But between ourselves, I am now too well known, I should be glad to borrow your face a a bit: a nobleman of distinction has just returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this co∣py of verses, my life for it you succeed, and we divide the spoil."</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bless us, George,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and is that the employment of poets now! Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary! Can they so far disgrace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of praise for bread?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O no, Sir,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a true po∣et can never be so base; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The crea∣tures I now describe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hardship for fame, so he is equally a coward to contempt, and none but those who are unworthy protection con∣descend to solicit it.<P>"Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indignities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame, I was now obliged to take a mid∣dle course, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profession where mere industry alone could ensure success.
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
I could not suppress my lurking passion for applause; but usually consumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it should have been more advantageously employ∣ed in the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would come forth in the mist of periodical pub∣lication, unnoticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed, than to observe the easy simplicity of my style, or the harmony of my periods. Sheet after sheet was thrown off to ob∣livion. My essays were buried among the essays upon liberty, eastern tales, and cures for the bite of a mad dog; while Philantos, Philalethes, Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, because they wrote faster, than I.</P>
<P>"Now, therefore, I began to associate with none but disappointed authors, like myself, who praised, deplored, and de∣spised each other. The satisfaction we
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
found in every celebrated writer's at∣tempts, was inversely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of com∣fort. I could neither read nor write with satisfaction; for excellence in an∣other was my aversion, and writing was my trade.</P>
<P>"In the midst of these gloomy reflec∣tions, as I was one day sitting on a bench in St. James's park, a young gentleman of distinction, who had been my inti∣mate acquaintance at the university, ap∣proached me. We saluted each other with some hesitation, he almost ashamed of being known to one who made so shabby an appearance, and I afraid of a repulse. But my suspicions soon va∣nished; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What did you say, George?"</Q> inter∣rupted I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thornhill, was not that his name? It can certainly be no other than my landlord."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bless me,"</Q> cried Mrs. Arnold, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is Mr. Thornhill so near a neighbour of yours? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a visit from him shortly."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My friend's first care,"</Q> continued my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was to alter my appearance by a very fine suit of his own cloaths, and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of half-friend, half-under∣ling. My business was to attend him at auctions, to put him in spirits when he sate for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to assist at tattering a kip, as the phrase was, when we had a mind for a frolic. Beside this, I had twenty other little employments in the family. I was to do many small things without bidding; to carry the cork screw; to stand godfather
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
to all the butler's children; to sing when I was bid; to be never out of hu∣mour; always to be humble, and, if I could, to be happy.<P>"In this honourable post, however, I was not without a rival. A captain of ma∣rines, who seemed formed for the place by nature, opposed me in my patron's affections. His mother had been laundress to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedi∣gree. As this gentleman made it the stu∣dy of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was dismissed from several for his stupidity; yet he found many of them who permitted his assiduities, being as dull as himself. As flattery was his trade, he practised it with the easiest address imaginable; but it came aukward and stiff from me; and as every day my pa∣tron's desire of flattery encreased, so eve∣ry hour being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
it. Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occasion for my assis∣tance. This was nothing less than to fight a duel for him, with a gentleman whose sister it was pretended he had used ill. I readily complied with his request, and tho' I see you are displeased at my conduct, yet as it was a debt indispensably due to friendship, I could not refuse. I under∣took the affair, disarmed my antagonist, and soon after had the pleasure of find∣ing that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a sharper. This piece of service was re∣paid with the warmest professions of gra∣titude; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method to serve me, but by recommend∣ing me to his uncle Sir William Thorn∣hill, and another nobleman of great dis∣tinction, who enjoyed a post under the government. When he was gone, my first care was to carry his recommenda∣tory
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
letter to his uncle, a man whose character for every virtue was universal, yet just. I was received by his servants with the most hospitable smiles; for the looks of the domestics ever transmit their mas∣ter's benevolence. Being shewn into a grand apartment, where Sir William soon came to me, I delivered my mes∣sage and letter, which he read, and after pausing some minutes, Pray, Sir, cried he, inform me what you have done for my kinsman, to deserve this warm re∣commendation? But I suppose, Sir, I guess at your merits, you have fought for him; and so you would expect a reward from me, for being the instrument of his vices. I wish, sincerely wish, that my present refusal may be some punishment for your guilt; but still more, that it may be some inducement to your repen∣tance.—The severity of this rebuke I bore patiently, because I knew it was just. My whole expectations now, there∣fore, lay in my letter to the great man.
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
As the doors of the nobility are almost ever beset with beggars, all ready to thrust in some sly petition, I found it no easy matter to gain admittance. How∣ever, after bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune, I was at last shewn into a spacious apartment, my letter be∣ing previously sent up for his lordship's inspection. During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me. Eve∣ry thing was grand, and of happy con∣trivance: the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raised my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to myself, how very great must the possessor of all these things be, who carries in his head the business of the state, and whose house displays half the wealth of a kingdom: sure his genius must be unfathomable! During these awful reflections I heard a step come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man him∣self! No, it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard soon after. This
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
must be He! No, it was only the great man's valet de chambre. At last his lordship actually made his appearance. Are you, cried he, the bearer of this here letter? I answered with a bow. I learn by this, continued he, as how that—But just at that instant a servant delivered him a card, and without taking farther no∣tice, he went out of the room, and left me to digest my own happiness at leisure. I saw no more of him, till told by a footman that his lordship was going to his coach at the door. Down I immediately fol∣lowed, and joined my voice to that of three or four more, who came, like me, to petition for favours. His lordship, however, went too fast for us, and was gaining his Chariot door with large stri∣des, when I hallowed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was by this time got in, and muttered an answer, half of which only I heard, the other half was lost in the rattling of his chariot wheels. I stood for some time with my neck
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
stretched out, in the posture of one that was listening to catch the glorious sounds, till looking round me, I found myself alone at his lordship's gate.</P></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My patience,"</Q> continued my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was now quite exhausted: stung with the thousand indignities I had met with, I was willing to cast myself away, and on∣ly wanted the gulph to receive me. I regarded myself as one of those vile things that nature designed should be thrown by into her lumber room, there to perish in unpitied obscurity. I had still, however, half a guinea left, and of that I thought fortune herself should not deprive me: but in order to be sure of this, I was resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it, and then trust to occur∣rences for the rest. As I was going along with this resolution, it happened that Mr. Cripse's office seemed invitingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this office Mr. Cripse kindly offers all his
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
majesty's subjects a generous promise of 30 l. a year, for which promise all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permission to let him transport them to America as slaves. I was happy at find∣ing a place where I could lose my fears in desperation, and therefore entered this cell; for it had the appearance of one, being dark, damp, and dirty. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circumstances like myself, expecting the arrival of Mr. Cripse, presenting a true epitome of English impatience. Each untractable soul at variance with fortune, wreaked her injuries on their own hearts: but Mr. Cripse at last came down, and all our murmurs were hush∣ed. He deigned to regard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and indeed he was the first man who for a month past talk∣ed to me with smiles. After a few ques∣tions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He paused a while upon the properest means of providing for me,
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
and slapping his forehead, as if he had found it, assured me, that there was at that time an embassy talked of from the synod of Pensylvania to the Chickasaw Indians, and that he would use his inte∣rest to get me made secretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promise gave me pleasure, there was something so magnisicent in the sound. I fairly, therefore, divided my half guinea, one half of which went to be added to his thirty thousand pound, and with the other half I resolved to go to the next tavern, to be there more happy than he.<P>"As I was going out with that resolution, I was met at the door by the captain of a ship, with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch. As I never chose to make a secret of my circumstances, he assured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in listening
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
to the office-keeper's promises; for that he only designed to sell me to the plan∣tations. But, continued he, I fancy you might, by a much shorter voyage, be ve∣ry easily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my advice. My ship sails to-mor∣row for Amsterdam; What if you go in her as a passenger? The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen English, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I suppose you understand English, added he, by this time, or the deuce is in it. I confidently assured him of that; but ex∣pressed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn English. He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to distraction; and upon that affirmation I agreed with his proposal, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch English in Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage short, and after having paid my passage with half my moveables, I found myself, fallen as if from the skies, a
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
stranger in one of the principal streets of Amsterdam. In this situation I was un∣willing to let any time pass unemployed in teaching. I addressed myself there∣fore to two or three of those I met, whose appearance seemed most promising; but it was impossible to make ourselves mu∣tually understood. It was not till this very moment I recollected, that in order to teach Dutchmen English, it was neces∣sary that they should first teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook so obvious an objection, is to me amazing; but certain it is I overlooked it.</P>
<P>"This scheme thus blown up, I had some thoughts of fairly shipping back to England again; but happening into company with an Irish student, who was returning from Louvain, our conversation turning upon topics of literature, (for by the way it may be observed, that I always forgot the meanness of my cir∣cumstances when I could converse upon
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
such subjects) from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole uni∣versity who understood Greek. This amazed me. I instangly resolved to tra∣vel to Louvain, and there live by teach∣ing Greek; and in this design I was hear∣tened by my brother student, who threw out some hints that a fortune might be got by it.</P>
<P>"I set boldly forward the next morning. Every day lessened the burthen of my moveables, like Aesop and his basket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was resolved not to go sneaking to the lower professors, but o∣penly tendered my talents to the prin∣cipal himself. I went, had admittance, and offered him my service as a master of the Greek language, which I had been told was a desideratum in his university. The <HI>principal</HI> seemed at first to doubt of my abilities; but of these I offered to
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he should fix upon into La∣tin. Finding me perfectly earnest in my proposal, he addressed me thus: You see me, young man, continued he, I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I ever missed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek: I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek; and I eat heartily without Greek. In short, continued he, I don't know Greek, and I do not believe there is any use in it.</P>
<P>"I was now too far from home to think of returning; so I resolved to go for∣ward. I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice, and now turned what was once my amusement into a pre∣sent means of bare subsistence. I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
ever found them sprightly in proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a peasant's house towards night-fall, I played one of my most merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day. I once or twice attempted to play for people of fashion; but they still thought my per∣formance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extraordinary, as whenever I used formerly to play for company, when playing was my amusement, my music never failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies especially; but as it was now my only means, it was received with contempt: a proof how ready the world is to under rate those talents which a man lives by.</P>
<P>"In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no design but just to look about me, and then to go forward. The people of
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Paris are much fonder of strangers that have money, than of those that have wit. You may imagine then, as I could not boast much of either, that I was no great favourite. After I had walked about the town four or five days, and seen the outsides of the best houses, I was preparing to leave this retreat of ve∣nal hospitality, when passing through one of the principal streets, whom should I meet but our cousin, to whom you first recommended me. This meeting was very agreeable to me, and I believe not displeasing to him. He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his business there, which was to collect pictures, medals, in∣taglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had just stept into taste and a large fortune. I was still more surprised at seeing our cousin pitch∣ed upon for this office, as himself had often assured me he knew nothing of the
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
matter. Upon my asking how he had been taught the art of a connoscento so very suddenly, he assured me that no∣thing was more easy. The whole secret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules: the one always to observe, that the pic∣ture might have been better if the pain∣ter had taken more pains; and the other, to praise the works of Pietro Perugino. But, says he, as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to instruct you in the art of picture buying at Paris.</P>
<P>"With this proposal I very readily closed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went there∣fore to his lodgings, improved my dress by his assistance, and after some time, accompanied him to auctions of pictures, where the English gentry were expected to be purchasers. I was not a little sur∣prised at his intimacy with people of the
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
best fashion, who referred themselves to his judgment upon every picture or me∣dal, as to an unerring standard of taste. He made very good use of my assistance upon these occasions; for when asked his opinion, he would gravely take me a∣side, and ask mine, shrug, look wise, re∣turn, and assure the company, that he could give no opinion upon an affair of so much importance. Yet there was sometimes an occasion for a more sup∣ported assurance. I remember to have seen him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mel∣low enough, very deliberately take a brush with brown varnish, that was acci∣dentally lying in the place, and rub it over the piece with great composure be∣fore all the company, and then ask if he had not improved the tints.</P>
<P>"When he had finished his commission in Paris, he left me strongly recommend∣ed
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
to several men of distinction, as a person very proper for a travelling tutor; and I was after some time employed in that capa∣city by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to set him forward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's governor, with this injunction, that he should always be permitted to direct himself. My pupil in fact understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than me. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds, left him by an uncle in the West Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the ma∣nagement of it, had bound him appren∣tice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing passion: all his questions on the road were how money might be saved, which was the least expensive course of travel; whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London.
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight was to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told it was not worth seeing. He never paid a bill, that he would not observe, how amazingly expensive travelling was, and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping, he enquired the expence of the passage by sea home to England. This he was informed was but a trifle, compared to his returning by land, he was therefore unable to withstand the temptation; so paying me the small part of my salary that was then due, he took leave, and embark∣ed with only one attendant for Lon∣don.</P>
<P>"I now therefore was left once more up∣on the world at large; but then it was
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
a thing I was used to. However my skill in music could avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a bet∣ter musician than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which an∣swered my purpose as well, and this was a skill in disputation. In all the fo∣reign universities and convents, there are upon certain days philosophical theses maintained against every adventitious dis∣putant; for which, if the champion op∣poses with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night. In this manner therefore I fought my way towards England, walk∣ed along from city to city, examined mankind more nearly, and, if I may so express it, saw both sides of the picture. My remarks, however, were few: I found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in, and common∣wealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every country another
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
name for freedom; and that no man is so sond of freedom himself that he would not chuse to subject the will of some in∣dividuals of society to his own.</P>
<P>"Upon my arrival in England, I resolv∣ed to pay my respects first to you, and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was sent out; but on my journey down my resolutions were changed, by meeting an old acquaintace, who I found belonged to a company of comedians, that were going to make a summer campaign in the country. The company seemed not much to disapprove of me for an associate. They all, how∣ever, apprized me of the importance of the task at which I aimed; that the pub∣lic was a many headed monster, and that only such as had very good heads could please it: that acting was not to be learnt in a day; and that without some traditi∣onal shrugs, which had been on the
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
stage, and only on the stage, these hun∣dred years, I could never pretend to please. The next difficulty was in fit∣ting me with parts, as almost every cha∣racter was in keeping. I was driven for some time from one character to another, till at last Horatio was fixed upon, which the presence of the present company happily hindered me from acting."</P></Q></P>

<P>The short continuance of friendship a∣mongst the vicious, which is coeval only with mutual satisfaction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY son's account was too long to be delivered at once, the first part of it was begun that night, and he was conclu∣ding the rest after dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equi∣page at the door seemed to make a pause in the general satisfaction. The but∣ler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a whisper, that the 'Squire had already made some over∣tures to Miss Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle seemed highly to approve the
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's entering, he seemed, at seeing my son and me, to start back; but I readily imputed that to surprize, and not displeasure. However, upon our advancing to salute him, he re∣turned our greeting with the most appa∣rent candour; and after a short time, his presence seemed only to encrease the gene∣ral good humour.</P>
<P>After tea he called me aside, to enquire after my daughter; but upon my informing him that my enquiry was unsuccessful, he seemed greatly surprised; adding, that he had been since frequently at my house, in order to comfort the rest of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then asked if I had communicated her misfor∣tune to Miss Wilmot, or my son; and up∣on my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, desiring me by all means to keep it a secret: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For at best,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is but divulging one's own infamy;
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
and perhaps Miss Livy may not be so guilty as we all imagine."</Q> We were here interrupted by a servant, who came to ask the 'Squire in, to stand up at country dances; so that he left me quite pleased with the in∣terest he seemed to take in my concerns. His addresses, however, to Miss Wilmot, were too obvious to be mistaken; and yet she seemed not perfectly pleased, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt, than from real inclination. I had even the satis∣faction to see her lavish some kind looks upon my unfortunate son, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor as∣siduity. Mr. Thornhill's seeming composure, however, not a little surprised me: we had now continued here a week, at the pressing instances of Mr. Arnold; but each day the more tenderness Miss Wilmot shewed my son, Mr. Thornhill's friendship seemed pro∣portionably to encrease for him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>
He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his interest to serve the family; but now his generosity was not con∣fined to promises alone: the morning I de∣signed for my departure, Mr. Thornhill came to me with looks of real pleasure to inform me of a piece of service he had done for his friend George. This was nothing less than his having procured him an ensign's commission in one of the regiments that was going to the West Indies, for which he had promised but one hundred pounds, his interest having been sufficient to get an abatement of the other two. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for this trifling piece of service,"</Q> continued the young gentleman, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I desire no other reward but the pleasure of having served my friend; and as for the hundred pound to be paid, if you are unable to raise it yourselves, I will advance it, and you shall repay me at your leisure."</Q> This was a favour we wanted words to ex∣press our sense of: I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and testified
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</P>
<P>George was to depart for town the next day to secure his commission, in pursuance of his generous patron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to use dispatch, lest in the mean time another should step in with more advantageous proposals. The next morning, therefore, our young soldier was early prepared for his departure, and seemed the only person among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and mistress, for Miss Wilmot actually loved him, he was leaving behind, any way damped his spirits. After he had taken leave of the rest of the company, I gave him all I had, my blessing. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And now, my boy,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thou art going to fight for thy country, remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his sa∣cred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and immitate
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falk∣land. Go, my boy, and if you fall, tho' distant, exposed and unwept by those that love you, the most precious tears are those with which heaven bedews the un∣buried head of a soldier."</Q></P>
<P>The next morning I took leave of the good family, that had been kind enough to entertain me so long, not without several expressions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the en∣joyment of all that happiness which afflu∣ence and good breeding procure, and re∣turned towards home, despairing of ever finding my daughter more, but sending a sigh to heaven to spare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired an horse to carry me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted myself with the hopes of soon seeing all I held dearest upon earth. But the night
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
coming on, I put up at a little public-house by the road-side, and asked for the land∣lord's company over a pint of wine. We sate beside his kitchen fire, which was the best room in the house, and chatted on po∣litics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill, whom the host as∣sured me was hated as much as an uncle of his, who sometimes came down to the country, was loved. He went on to observe, that he made it his whole study to betray the daugh∣ters of such as received him to their houses, and after a fortnight or three weeks possession, he turned them out unrewarded and aban∣doned to the world. As we continued our discourse in this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, returned, and per∣ceiving that her husband was enjoying a pleasure in which she was not a sharer, she asked him, in an angry tone, what he did there, to which he only replied in an ironi∣cal way, by drinking her health. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr.
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
Symmonds,"</Q> cried she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you use me very ill, and I'll bear it no longer. Here three parts of the business is left for me to do, and the fourth left unfinished; while you do nothing but soak with the guests all day long, whereas if a spoon∣ful of liquor were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop."</Q> I now found what she would be at, and immediately poured her out a glass, which she received with a curtesy, and drinking towards my good health, <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> resumed she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry, but one cannot help it, when the house is going out of the win∣dows. If the customers or guests are to be dunned, all the burthen lies upon my back, he'd as lief eat that glass as budge after them himself. There now above stairs, we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe she has got any money by her over-civility. I am certain
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
she is very slow of payment, and I wish she were put in mind of it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What signifies minding her,"</Q> cried the host, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if she be slow, she is sure."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't know that,"</Q> replied the wife; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I know that I am sure she has been here a fort∣night, and we have not yet seen the cross of her money."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I suppose, my dear,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we shall have it all in a lump."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In a lump!"</Q> cried the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope we may get it any way; and that I am resolved we shall this very night, or out she tramps, bag and bag∣gage."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Consider, my dear,"</Q> cried the husband, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"she is a gentlewoman, and deserves more respect."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for the matter of that,"</Q> returned the hostess, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"gentle or simple, out she shall pack with a sassarara. Gentry may be good things where they take; but for my part I ne∣ver saw much good of them at the sign of the Harrow."</Q>—Thus saying, she ran up a narrow flight of stairs, that went from the kit∣chen
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
to a room over-head, and I soon perceiv∣ed by the loudness of her voice, and the bit∣terness of her reproaches, that no money was to be had from her lodger. I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Out I say, pack out this moment, tramp thou infa∣mous strumpet, or I'll give thee a mark thou won't be the better for this three months. What! you trumpery, to come and take up an honest house, without cross or coin to bless yourself with; come along I say."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O dear madam,"</Q> cried the stranger, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"pity me, pity a poor abandoned creature for one night, and death will soon do the rest."</Q>—I instant∣ly knew the voice of my poor ruined child Olivia. I flew to her rescue, while the woman was dragging her along by the hair, and caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Welcome, any way welcome, my dearest lost one, my treasure, to your poor old father's bosom. Tho' the vici∣ous forfake thee, there is yet one in the
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
world that will never forsake thee; tho' thou hadst ten thousand crimes to an∣swer for, he will forget them all."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O my own dear</Q>—for minutes she could no more—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">my own dearest good papa! Could angels be kinder! How do I de∣serve so much! The villain, I hate him and myself, to be a reproach to such good∣ness. You can't forgive me. I know you cannot."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, my child, from my heart I do forgive thee! Only re∣pent, and we both shall yet be happy. We shall see many pleasant days yet, my Olivia!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah! never, sir, never. The rest of my wretched life must be in∣famy abroad and shame at home. But, alas! papa, you look much paler than you used to do. Could such a thing as I am give you so much uneasiness? Sure you have too much wisdom to take the miseries of my guilt upon yourself."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our wisdom, young woman,"</Q> replied I.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, why so cold a name, papa?"</Q>
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
cried she. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is the first time you ever called me by so cold a name."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I ask pardon, my darling,"</Q> returned I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I was going to observe, that wisdom makes but a slow defence against trou∣ble, though at last a sure one."</Q></P>
<P>The landlady now returned to know if we did not chuse a more genteel apartment, to which assenting, we were shewn a room, where we could converse more freely. After we had talked ourselves into some degree of tranquillity, I could not avoid desiring some account of the gra∣dations that led to her present wretched si∣tuation. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That villain, sir,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"from the first day of our meeting made me honourable, though private, proposals."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Villain indeed,"</Q> cried I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and yet it in some measure surprizes me, how a person of Mr. Burchell's good sense and seeming honour could be guilty of such deliberate baseness, and thus step into a family to undo it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear papa,"</Q> returned my daugh∣ter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you labour under a strange mistake, Mr. Burchell never attempted to deceive me. Instead of that he took every op∣portunity of privately admonishing me against the artifices of Mr. Thornhill, whom now I find was even worse than he represented him."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Thornhill,"</Q> in∣terrupted I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"can it be?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> returned she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was Mr. Thornhill who se∣duced me, who employed the two ladies, as he called them, but who, in fact, were abandoned women of the town, without breeding or pity, to decoy us up to Lon∣don. Their artifices, you may remember would have certainly succeeded, but for Mr. Burchell's letter, who directed those reproaches at them, which we all appli∣ed to ourselves. How he came to have so much influence as to defeat their in∣tentions, still remains a secret to me; but I am convinced he was ever our warmest sincerest friend."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You amaze me, my dear,"</Q> cried I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but now I find my first suspicions of Mr. Thornhill's baseness were too well grounded: but he can triumph in secu∣rity; for he is rich and we are poor. But tell me, my child, sure it was no small temptation that could thus oblite∣rate all the impressions of such an edu∣cation, and so virtuous a disposition as thine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> replied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he owes all his triumph to the desire I had of making him, and not myself, happy. I knew that the ceremony of our marriage, which was privately performed by a popish priest, was no way binding, and that I had nothing to trust to but his honour."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What,"</Q> interrupted I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and were you indeed married by a priest, and in or∣ders?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir, we were,"</Q> re∣plied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though we were both sworn to conceal his name."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why then, my
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
child, come to my arms again, and now you are a thousand times more welcome than before; for you are now his wife to all intents and purposes; nor can all the laws of man, tho' written upon tables of adamant, lessen the force of that sa∣cred connexion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas, Papa,"</Q> replied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are but little acquainted with his villainies: he has been married already, by the same priest, to six or eight wives more, whom, like me, he has deceived and abandoned."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Has he so?"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then we must hang the priest, and you shall inform against him to-morrow."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But Sir,"</Q> returned she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will that be right, when I am sworn to se∣crecy?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear,"</Q> I replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if you have made such a promise, I cannot, nor will not, tempt you to break it. Even tho' it may benefit the public, you must not in∣form against him. In all human institu∣tions
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good; as in politics, a province may be given away to secure a kingdom; in medicine, a limb may be lopt off, to preserve the body. But in religion the law is written, and inflexible, <HI>never</HI> to do evil. And this law, my child, is right: for otherwise, if we commit a smaller evil, to procure a greater good, certain guilt would be thus incurred, in expec∣tation of contingent advantage. And though the advantage should certainly follow, yet the interval between commis∣sion and advantage, which is allowed to be guilty, may be that in which we are called away to answer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions is closed for ever. But I interrupt you, my dear, go on."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The very next morning,"</Q> continued she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I found what little expectations I was to have from his sincerity. That very
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
morning he introduced me to two un∣happy women more, whom, like me, he had deceived, but who lived in con∣tented prostitution. I loved him too ten∣derly to bear such rivals in his affections, and strove to forget my infamy in a tu∣mult of pleasures. With this view, I danced, dressed, and talked; but still was unhappy. The gentlemen who visited there told me every moment of the power of my charms, and this only contributed to encrease my melancholy, as I had thrown all their power quite away. Thus each day I grew more pensive, and he more insolent, till at last the monster had the assurance to offer me to a young Baronet of his ac∣quaintance. Need I describe, Sir, how his ingratitude stung me. My an∣swer to this proposal was almost mad∣ness. I desired to part. As I was go∣ing he offered me a purse; but I flung it at him with indignation, and burst from
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
him in a rage, that for a while kept me insensible of the miseries of my situation. But I soon looked round me, and saw myself a vile, abject, guilty thing, with∣out one friend in the world to apply to.<P>"Just in that interval, a stage-coach happening to pass by, I took a place, it being my only aim to be driven at a distance from a wretch I despised and detested. I was set down here, where, since my arrival, my own anxiety, and this woman's unkindness, have been my only companions. The hours of pleasure that I have passed with my mamma and sister, now grow painful to me. Their sorrows are much; but mine is greater than theirs; for mine is guilt and infamy."</P></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Have patience, my child,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I hope things will yet be better. Take some repose to-night, and to-mor∣row
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
I'll carry you home to your mother and the rest of the family, from whom you will receive a kind reception. Poor woman, this has gone to her heart: but she loves you still, Olivia, and will for∣get it."</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Offences are easily pardoned where there is love at bottom.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning I took my daugh∣ter behind me, and set out on my return home. As we travelled along, I strove, by every persuasion, to calm her sorrows and fears, and to arm her with reso∣lution to bear the presence of her offended mother. I took every opportunity, from the prospect of a fine country, through which we passed, to observe how much kin∣der heaven was to us, than we were to each other, and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few. I assured her, that she should never perceive any change in
<PB N="56" REF="56"/>
my affections, and that during my life, which yet might be long, she might depend upon a guardian and an instructor. I armed her against the censures of the world, shew∣ed her that books were sweet unreproach∣ing companions to the miserable, and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would teach us to endure it.</P>
<P>The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my house, and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to come for her, accompanied by my daughter So∣phia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed stage: however, after seeing her provided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the hostess to prepare proper refreshments, I kissed her, and proceeded towards home. My heart caught new sensations of pleasure
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
the nearer I approached that peaceful mansion. As a bird that has been fright∣ed from its nest, my affections out-went my haste, and hovered round my little fire-side, with all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many fond things I had to say, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender em∣brace, and smiled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but slowly, the night wained apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to rest; the lights were out in every cottage; no sounds were heard but of the shrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at hollow distance. I approach∣ed my little abode of pleasure, and before I was within a furlong of the place, our honest mastiff came running to welcome me.</P>
<P>It was now near mid-night that I came to knock at my door: all was still and si∣lent: my heart dilated with unutterable hap∣piness,
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
when, to my amazement, the house was bursting out in a blaze of fire, and every apperture was red with conflagration! I gave a loud convulsive outcry, and fell upon the pavement insensible. This alarm∣ed my son, who perceiving the flames, in∣stantly waked my wife and daughter, and all running out, naked, and wild with ap∣prehension, recalled me to life with their anguish. But it was only to objects of new terror; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family stood, with silent agony, looking on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones; but they were not to be seen. O misery! <Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where are my little ones?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are burnt to death in the flames,"</Q> says my wife calmly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I will die with them."</Q>—That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were just awak∣ed
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>
by the fire, and nothing could have stopped me. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where, where, are my children?"</Q> cried I, rushing through the flames, and bursting the door of the cham∣ber in which they were confined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where are my little ones?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here, dear papa, here we are,"</Q> cried they together, while the flames were just catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms, and snatched them through the fire as fast as possible, while just as I was got out, the roof sunk in. <Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> cried I, holding up my children, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy."</Q> We kissed our little darlings a thousand times, they clasped us round the neck, and seemed to share our transports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60"/>
I now stood a calm spectator of the flames, and after some time, began to per∣ceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible manner. It was there∣fore out of my power to give my son any assistance, either in attempting to fave our goods, or preventing the flames spreading to our corn. By this time, the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our assistance; but all they could do was to stand, like us, spectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had reserved for my daughters fortunes, were entirely consumed, except a box, with some papers, that stood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little consequence, which my son brought away in the begin∣ning. The neighbours contributed, how∣ever, what they could to lighten our distress. They brought us cloaths, and furnished one of our out-houses with kitchen utensils; so that by day-light we had another, tho' a wretched, dwelling to retire to. My honest next
<PB N="61" REF="61"/>
neighbour, and his children, were not the least assiduous in providing us with every thing necessary, and offering what ever consolation untutored benevolence could suggest.</P>
<P>When the fears of my family had sub∣sided, curiosity to know the cause of my long stay began to take place; having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the recep∣tion of our lost one, and tho' we had no∣thing but wretchedness now to impart, yet to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions. Being una∣able to go for my poor child myself, as my arm now grew very painful, I sent my son and daughter, who soon returned, support∣ing the wretched delinquent, who had not courage to look up at her mother, whom
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
no instructions of mine could persuade to a perfect reconciliation; for women have a much stronger sense of female error than men. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, madam,"</Q> cried her mother, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is but a poor place you are come to after so much finery. My daughter So∣phy and I can afford but little enter∣tainment to persons who have kept com∣pany only with people of distinction. Yes, Miss Livy, your poor father and I have suffered very much of late; but I hope heaven will forgive you."</Q>—During this reception, the unhappy victim stood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to re∣ply; but I could not continue a silent spec∣tator of her distress, wherefore assuming a degree of severity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with instant sub∣mission, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I entreat, woman, that my words may be now marked once for all: I have here brought you back a poor deluded wanderer; her return to duty demands the revival of our tenderness. The
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>
real hardships of life are now coming fast upon us, let us not therefore encrease them by dissention among each other. If we live harmoniously together, we may yet be contented, as there are enough of us here to shut out the censuring world, and keep each other in countenance. The kind∣ness of heaven is promised to the penitent, and let ours be directed by the example. Heaven, we are assured, is much more pleased to view a repentant sinner, than many persons who have supported a course of undeviating rectitude. And this is right; for that single effort by which we stop short in the down-hill path to perdition, is itself a greater exertion of virtue, than an hundred acts of jus∣tice."</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>None but the guilty can be long and com∣pletely miserable.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SOME assiduity was now required to make our present abode as convenient as possible, and we were soon again qualified to enjoy our former serenity. Being dis∣abled myself from assisting my son in our usual occupations, I read to my family from the few books that were saved, and particu∣larly from such, as, by amusing the imagi∣nation, contributed to ease the heart. Our good neighbours too came every day with the kindest condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to assist at repairing my former dwelling. Honest farmer Wil∣liams
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
was not last among these visitors; but heartily offered his friendship. He would even have renewed his addresses to my daughter; but she rejected them in such a manner as totally represt his future soli∣citations. Her grief seemed formed for continuing, and she was the only person of our little society that a week did not restore to chearfulness. She now lost that un∣blushing innocence which once taught her to respect herself, and to seek pleasure by pleasing. Anxeity now had taken strong pos∣session of her mind, her beauty began to be impaired with her constitution, and neglect still more contributed to diminish it. Every tender epithet bestowed on her sister brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice, tho' cured, almost ever plants others where it has been, so her former guilt, tho' driven out by repentance, left jealousy and envy behind. I strove a thousand ways to lessen her care, and even forgot my own pain in a concern for her's,
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
collecting such amusing passages of history, as a strong memory and some reading could suggest. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our happiness, my dear,"</Q> I would say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is in the power of one who can bring it about a thousand unforeseen ways, that mock our foresight. If ex∣ample be necessary to prove this, I'll give you a story, my child, told us by a grave, tho' sometimes a romancing, his∣torian.<P>"Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the first quality, and found herself a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen. As she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a sudden spring, leaped from her arms into the flood below, and disappeared in a moment. The mother, struck with in∣stant surprize, and making an effort to save him, plunged in after; but, far
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
from being able to assist the infant, she herself with great difficulty escaped to the opposite shore, just when some French soldiers were plundering the coun∣try on that side, who immediately made her their prisoner.</P>
<P>"As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmost in∣humanity, they were going at once to per∣petrate those two extremes, suggested by appetite and cruelty. This base resolution, however, was opposed by a young offi∣cer, who, tho' their retreat required the utmost expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in safety to his native city. Her beauty at first caught his eye, her merit soon after his heart. They were married; he rose to the highest posts; they lived long toge∣ther, and were happy. But the felicity of a soldier can never be called perma∣nent: after an interval of several years,
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
the troops which he commanded having met with a repulse, he was obliged to take shelter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they suffered a siege, and the city at length was taken. Few histories can produce more various in∣stances of cruelty, than those which the French and Italians at that time exer∣cised upon each other. It was resolved by the victors, upon this occasion, to put all the French prisoners to death; but particularly the husband of the un∣fortunate Matilda, as he was principally instrumental in protracting the siege. Their determinations were, in general, executed almost as soon as resolved up∣on. The captive soldier was led forth, and the executioner, with his sword, stood ready, while the spectators in gloo∣my silence awaited the fatal blow, which was only suspended till the general, who presided as judge, should give the signal. It was in this interval of anguish and ex∣all
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
pectation, that Matilda came to take her last farewell of her husband and deliverer, deploring her wretched situation, and the cruelty of fate, that had saved her from perishing by a premature death in the ri∣ver Volturna, to be the spectator of still greater calamities. The general, who was a young man, was struck with surprize at her beauty, and pity at her distress; but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers. He was her son, the infant for whom she had encounter'd so much danger. He ac∣knowledged her at once as his mother, and fell at her feet. The rest may be easily supposed: the captive was set free, and all the happiness that love, friend∣ship, and duty could confer on each, were united."</P></Q></P>
<P>In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daughter; but she listened with divided attention; for her own misfortunes engrossed
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
the pity she once had for those of another, and nothing gave her ease. In company she dreaded contempt; and in solitude she only found anxiety. Such was the colour of her wretchedness, when we received certain in∣formation, that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot, for whom I always suspected he had a real passion, tho' he took every opportunity before me to express his contempt both of her person and fortune. This news only served to en∣crease poor Olivia's affliction; such a fla∣grant breach of fidelity, was more than her courage could support. I was resolved, however, to get more certain information, and to defeat, if possible, the completion of his designs, by sending my son to old Mr. Wilmot's, with instructions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Miss Wilmot a letter, intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family. My son went, in pursuance of my directions, and in three days returned, assuring us of the truth of
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
the acount; but that he had found it im∣possible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Miss Wilmot were visiting round the country. They were to be married, he said, in a few days, having appeared toge∣ther at church the Sunday before he was there, in great splendour, the bride attended by six young ladies drest in white, and he by as many gentlemen. Their approaching nuptials filled the whole country with re∣joicing, and they usually rode out together in the grandest equipage that had been seen in the country for many years. All the friends of both families, he said, were there, particularly the 'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore so good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and feasting were going forward; that all the country praised the young bride's beauty, and the bridegroom's fine person, and that they were immensely fond of each other; concluding, that he
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
could not help thinking Mr. Thorn∣hill one of the most happy men in the world.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why let him if he can,"</Q> returned I: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but, my son, observe this bed of straw, and unsheltering roof; those mouldering walls, and humid floor; my wretched body thus disabled by fire, and my children weeping round me for bread; you have come home, my child, to all this, yet here, even here, you see a man that would not for a thousand worlds exchange situ∣ations. O, my children, if you could but learn to commune with your own hearts, and know what noble company you can make them, you would little re∣gard the elegance and splendours of the worthless. Almost all men have been taught to call life a passage, and them∣selves the travellers. The similitude
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
still may be improved when we ob∣serve that the good are joyful and serene, like travellers that are going towards home; the wicked but by intervals happy, like travellers that are going into exile."</Q></P>
<P>My compassion for my poor daughter, overpowered by this new disaster, inter∣rupted what I had farther to observe. I bade her mother support her, and after a short time she recovered. She appeared from this time more calm, and I imagined had gained a new degree of resolution: but ap∣pearances deceived me; for her tranquility was the langour of over-wrought resentment. A supply of provisions, charitably sent us by my kind parishioners, seemed to diffuse chearfulness amongst the rest of the fa∣mily, nor was I displeased at seeing them once more sprightly and at ease. It would have been unjust to damp their
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
satisfactions, merely to condole with re∣solute melancholy, or to burthen them with a sadness they did not feel. Once more, therefore, the tale went round and the song was demanded, and chearfulness con∣descended to hover round our little habi∣tation.</P>

<P>THE next morning the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the season; so that we agreed to breakfast together at the honey-suckle bank: where, while we sate, my youngest daughter, at my request, joined her voice to the concert on the trees about us. It was here my poor Oli∣via first met her seducer, and every object served to recall her sadness. But that me∣lancholy, which is excited by objects of pleasure, or inspired by sounds of harmony, sooths the heart instead of corroding it. Her mother too, upon this occasion, felt a pleasing distress, and wept, and loved her
<PB N="78" REF="76"/>
daughter as before. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do, my pretty Oli∣via,"</Q> cried she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"let us have that little melancholy air your pappa was so fond of, your sister Sophy has already obliged us. Do child, it will please your old father."</Q> She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved me.</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>The only art her guilt to cover,</L>

</LG></Q>
<P>As she was concluding the last stanza, to which an interruption in her voice from sorrow gave peculiar softness, the appear∣ance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at a dis∣tance alarmed us all, but particularly en∣creased
<PB N="79" REF="77"/>
the uneasiness of my eldest daughter, who, desirous of shunning her betrayer, re∣turned to the house with her sister. In a few minutes he was alighted from his chariot, and making up to the place where I was still sitting, enquired after my health with his usual air of familiarity. <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your present assurance only serves to aggravate the baseness of your charac∣ter; and there was a time when I would have chastised your insolence, for presum∣ing thus to appear before me. But now you are safe; for age has cooled my passions, and my calling restrains them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I vow, my dear sir,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am amazed at all this; nor can I under∣stand what it means! I hope you don't think your daughter's late excursion with me had any thing criminal in it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="78"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Go,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thou art a wretch, a poor pitiful wretch, and every way a lyar; but your meanness secures you from my anger! Yet sir, I am descended from a family that would not have borne this! And so, thou vile thing, to gra∣tify a momentary passion, thou hast made one poor creature wretched for life, and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their portion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If she or you,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are re∣solved to be miserable, I cannot help it. But you may still be happy; and what∣ever opinion you may have formed of me, you shall ever find me ready to con∣tribute to it. We can readily marry her to another, and what is more, she may keep her lover beside; for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true regard for her."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="79"/>
I found all my passions awakened at this new degrading proposal; for though the mind may often be calm under great inju∣ries, little villainy can at any time get with∣in the soul, and sting it into rage.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Avoid my sight, thou reptile,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nor continue to insult me with thy pre∣sence. Were my brave son at home, he would not suffer this; but I am old, and disabled, and every way undone."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are bent up∣on obliging me to talk in an harsher manner than I intended. But as I have shewn you what may be hoped from my friendship, it may not be improper to represent what may be the consequences of my resentment. My attorney, to whom your late bond has heen transfer∣red, threatens hard, nor do I know how to prevent the course of justice, except by paying the money myself, which, as I have been at some expences lately, pre∣vious
<PB N="82" REF="80"/>
to my intended marriage, it is not so easy to be done. And then my steward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he knows his duty; for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature. Yet still I could wish to serve you, and even to have you and your daughter present at my marriage, which is shortly to be so∣lemnized with Miss Wilmot; it is even the request of my charming Arabella herself, whom I hope you will not re∣fuse."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Thornhill,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"hear me once for all: as to your marriage with any but my daughter, that I never will consent to; and though your friendship could raise me to a throne, or your re∣sentment sink me to the grave, yet would I despise both. Thou hast once wofully, irreparably, deceived me. I reposed my heart upon thine honour, and have found its baseness. Never
<PB N="83" REF="81"/>
more, therefore, expect friendship from me. Go, and possess what fortune has given thee, beauty, riches, health, and pleasure. Go, and leave me to want, infamy, disease, and sorrow. Yet hum∣bled as I am, shall my heart still vindi∣cate its dignity, and though thou hast my forgiveness, thou shalt ever have my contempt."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If so,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"depend upon it you shall feel the effects of this inso∣lence, and we shall shortly see which is the fittest object of scorn, you or me."</Q>—Upon which he departed abruptly.</P>
<P>My wife and son, who were present at this interview, seemed terrified with the ap∣prehension. My daughters also, finding that he was gone, came out to be informed of the result of our conference, which, when known, alarmed them not less than the rest. But as to myself, I disregarded
<PB N="84" REF="82"/>
the utmost stretch of his malevolence: he had already struck the blow, and now I stood prepared to repel every new ef∣fort. Like one of those instruments used in the art of war, which, however thrown, still presents a point to receive the enemy.</P>
<P>We soon, however, found that he had not threatened in vain; for the very next day his steward came to demand my annual rent, which, by the train of accidents al∣ready related, I was unable to pay. The consequence of my incapacity was his dri∣ving my cattle that evening, and their be∣ing appraised and sold the next day for less than half their value. My wife and children now therefore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain destruction. They even begged of me to admit his visits once more, and used all their little eloquence to paint the calami∣ties I was going to endure. The terrors of
<PB N="85" REF="83"/>
a prison, in so rigorous a season as the pre∣sent, with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire. But I continued inflexible.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my treasures,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why will you thus attempt to persuade me to the thing that is not right! My duty has taught me to forgive him; but my conscience will not permit me to ap∣prove. Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart must internally condemn? Would you have me tamely sit down and flatter our infamous be∣trayer; and to avoid a prison continual∣ly suffer the more galling bonds of men∣tal confinement! No, never. If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right, and wherever we are thrown, we can still retire to a charming apartment, and look round our
<PB N="86" REF="84"/>
own hearts with intrepidity and with pleasure!"</Q></P>
<P>In this manner we spent that evening. Early the next morning, as the snow had fallen in great abundance in the night, my son was employed in clearing it away, and opening a passage before the door. He had not been thus engaged long, when he came running in, with looks all pale, to tell us that two strangers, whom he knew to be officers of justice, were making to∣wards the house.</P>
<P>Just as he spoke they came in, and ap∣proaching the bed where I lay, after previ∣ously informing me of their employment and business, made me their prisoner, bid∣ding me prepare to go with them to the county gaol, which was eleven miles off.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My friends,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is severe weather on which you have come to
<PB N="87" REF="85"/>
take me to a prison; and it is particu∣larly unfortunate at this time, as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a ter∣rible manner, and it has thrown me into a slight fever, and I want cloaths to co∣ver me, and I am now too weak and and old to walk far in such deep snow: but if it must be so, I'll try to obey you."</Q></P>
<P>I then turned to my wife and chil∣dren, and directed them to get toge∣ther what few things were left us, and to prepare immediately for leaving this place. I entreated them to be expeditious, and desired my son to assist his elder sister, who, from a consciousness that she was the cause of all our calamities, was fallen, and had lost anguish in insensibility. I encouraged my wife, who, pale and trembling, clasped our affrighted little ones in her arms, that clung to her bosom in silence, dreading to
<PB N="88" REF="86"/>
look round at the strangers. In the mean time my youngest daughter prepared for our departure, and as she received several hints to use dispatch, in about an hour we were ready to depart.</P>

<P>No situation, however wretched it seems, but has some sort of comfort attending it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE set forward from this peaceful neighbourhood, and walked on slowly. My eldest daughter being enfee∣bled by a slow fever, which had begun for some days to undermine her constitu∣tion, one of the officers, who had an horse, kindly took her behind him; for even these men cannot entirely divest them∣selves of humanity. My son led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon my youngest girl, whose tears fell not for her own but my distresses.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="88"/>
We were now got from my late dwel∣ling about two miles, when we saw a crowd running and shouting behind us, consisting of about fifty of my poorest pa∣rishioners. These, with dreadful impreca∣tions, soon seized upon the two officers of justice, and swearing they would never see their minister go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to shed in his defence, were going to use them with great severity. The consequence might have been fatal, had I not immediately interposed, and with some difficulty rescued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My chil∣dren, who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared transported with joy, and were incapable of containing their rap∣tures. But they were soon undeceived, up∣on hearing me address the poor deluded people, who came, as they imagined, to do me service.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What! my friends,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and is this the way you love me! Is this the manner you obey the instructions I have given you from the pulpit! Thus to fly in the face of justice, and bring down ruin on yourselves and me! Which is your ringleader? Shew me the man that has thus seduced you. As sure as he lives he shall feel my resentment. Alas! my dear deluded flock, return back to the duty you owe to God, to your coun∣try, and to me. I shall yet perhaps one day see you in greater felicity here, and contribute to make your lives more hap∣py. But let it at least be my comfort when I pen my fold for immortality, that not one here shall be wanting."</Q></P>
<P>They now seemed all repentance, and melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I shook each tenderly by the hand, and leaving them my blessing, proceeded forward without meeting any
<PB N="92" REF="90"/>
farther interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather vil∣lage; for it consisted but of a few mean houses, having lost all its former opulence, and retaining no marks of its ancient supe∣riority but the gaol.</P>
<P>Upon entering, we put up at an inn, where we had such refreshments as could most readily be procured, and I supped with my family with my usual chearfulness. Af∣ter seeing them properly accommodated for that night, I next attended the sheriff's of∣ficers to the prison, which had formerly been built for the purposes of war, and consisted of one large apartment, strongly grated, and paved with stone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty. Besides this, every prisoner had a separate cell, where he was locked in for the night.</P>
<P>I expected upon my entrance to find no∣thing but lamentations, and various sounds
<PB N="93" REF="91"/>
of misery; but it was very different. The pri∣soners seemed all employed in one common design, that of forgetting thought in merri∣ment or clamour. I was apprized of the usual perquisite required upon these occa∣sions, and immediately complied with the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhausted. This was immediately sent away for liquor, and the whole prison soon was filled with riot, laughter, and prophaneness.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> cried I to myself, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"shall men so very wicked be chearful, and shall I be melancholy! I feel only the same confinement with them, and I think I have more reason to be happy."</Q></P>
<P>With such reflections I laboured to be∣come chearful; but chearfulness was never yet produced by effort, which is itself pain∣ful. As I was sitting therefore in a corner of the gaol, in a pensive posture, one of
<PB N="94" REF="92"/>
my fellow prisoners came up, and sitting by me, entered into conversation. It was my constant rule in life never to avoid the conversation of any man who seemed to de∣sire it: for if good, I might profit by his instruction; if bad, he might be assisted by mine. I found this to be a knowing man, of strong unlettered sense; but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, or, more properly speaking, of human nature on the wrong side. He asked me if I had taken care to provide myfelf with a bed, which was a circumstance I had never once at∣tended to.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That's unfortunate,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as you are allowed here nothing but straw, and your apartment is very large and cold. However you seem to be some∣thing of a gentleman, and as I have been one myself in my time, part of my bed-cloaths are heartily at your service."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="93"/>
I thanked him, professing my surprize at finding such humanity in a gaol in misfor∣tunes; adding, to let him see that I was a scholar, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the sage ancient seemed to understand the value of company in afflic∣tion, when he said, Ton kosmon aire, ei¦dos ton etairon; and in fact,"</Q> continued I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what is the World if it affords only soli∣tude?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You talk of the world, Sir,"</Q> returned my fellow prisoner; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>the world is in its dotage, and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled the philosophers of every age. What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world. Sanconiathon, Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus have all attempted it in vain. The latter has these words, Anar∣chon ara kai atelutaion to pan, which im∣plies</HI></Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I ask pardon, Sir,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for interrupting so much learning; but I think I have heard all this before.
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>
Have I not had the pleasure of once seeing you at Welbridge fair, and is not your name Ephraim Jenkinson?"</Q> At this demand he only sighed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I suppose you must recollect,"</Q> resumed I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one Doctor Primrose, from whom you bought a horse."</Q></P>
<P>He now at once recollected me; for the gloominess of the place and the approach∣ing night had prevented his distinguishing my features before.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir,"</Q> return∣ed Mr. Jenkinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I remember you per∣fectly well I bought an horse, but for∣got to pay for him. Your neighbour Flamborough is the only prosecutor I am any way afraid of at the next assizes: for he intends to swear positively against me as a coiner. I am heartily sorry, Sir, I ever deceived you, or indeed any man; for you see,"</Q> continued he, shewing his shackles, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what my tricks have brought me to."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="95"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your kindness in offering me assistance, when you could expect no return, shall be repaid with my endeavours to soften or totally sup∣press Mr. Flamborough's evidence, and I will send my son to him for that pur∣pose the first opportunity; nor do I in the least doubt but he will comply with my request, and as to my own evidence, you need be under no uneasiness about that."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, sir,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all the return I can make shall be yours. You shall have more than half my bed-cloaths to night, and I'll take care to stand your friend in the prison, where I think I have some influence."</Q></P>
<P>I thanked him, and could not avoid be∣ing surprised at the present youthful change in his aspect; for at the time I had seen him before he appeared at least sixty.—<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q>
<PB N="98" REF="96"/>
answered he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are little acquainted with the world; I had at that time false hair, and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from seventeen to seventy. Ah sir, had I but bestowed half the pains in learning a trade, that I have in learning to be a scoundrel, I might have been a rich man at this day. But rogue as I am, still I may be your friend, and that perhaps when you least expect it."</Q></P>
<P>We were now prevented from further conversation, by the arrival of the gaoler's servants, who came to call over the priso∣ners names, and lock up for the night. A fellow also, with a bundle of straw for my bed attended, who led me along a dark narrow passage into a room paved like the common prison, and in one corner of this I spread my bed, and the cloaths given me by my fellow prisoner; which done,
<PB N="99" REF="97"/>

<P>A reformation in the gaol. To make laws complete, they should reward as well as punish.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I found in tears at my bed-side. The gloomy strength of every thing about us, it seems, had daunted them. I gently rebuked their sorrow, as∣suring them I had never slept with greater tranquility, and next enquired after my eldest daughter, who was not among them. They informed me that yesterday's uneasi∣ness and fatigue had encreased her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her be∣hind. My next care was to send my son to procure a room or two to lodge the
<PB N="102" REF="99"/>
family in, as near the prison as conveniently could be found. He obeyed; but could only find one apartment, which was hired at a small expence, for his mother and sisters, the gaoler with humanity consenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the prison with me. A bed was therefore pre∣pared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought answered very convenient∣ly. I was willing however previously to know whether my little children chose to lie in a place which seemed to fright them upon entrance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my good boys, how do you like your bed? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, papa,"</Q> says Dick, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am not afraid to lie any where where you are."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="100"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I,"</Q> says Bill, who was yet but four years old, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"love every place best that my papa is in."</Q></P>
<P>After this, I allotted to each of the fa∣mily what they were to do. My daughter was particularly directed to watch her de∣clining sister's health; my wife was to at∣tend me; my little boys were to read to me: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And as for you, my son,"</Q> continu∣ed I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is by the labour of your hands we must all hope to be supported. Your wages, as a day-labourer, will be full sufficient, with proper frugality, to main∣tain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now sixteen years old, and hast strength, and it was given thee, my son, for very useful purposes; for it must save from famine your helpless parents and fa∣mily. Prepare then this evening to look out for work against to-morrow, and bring home every night what money you earn, for our support."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="101"/>
Having thus instructed him, and settled the rest, I walked down to the common pri∣son, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewdness, and brutality that invaded me on every side, drove me back to my apartment again. Here I sate for some time, pondering upon the strange in∣fatuation of wretches, who finding all man∣kind in open arms against them, were, however, labouring to make themselves a future and a tremendous enemy.</P>
<P>Their insensibility excited my highest com∣passion, and blotted my own uneasiness a while from my mind. It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I resolved therefore once more to return, and in spite of their con∣tempt to give them my advice, and conquer them by perseverance. Going therefore among them again, I informed Mr. Jenkin∣son of my design, at which he laughed,
<PB N="105" REF="102"/>
but communicated it to the rest. The pro∣posal was received with the greatest good∣humour, as it promised to afford a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for mirth, but what could be derived from ridicule or debau∣chery.</P>
<P>I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occasion. Lewd whispers, groans of contrition burlesqued, winking and cough∣ing, alternately excited laughter. Howe∣ver, I continued with my natural solemnity to read on, sensible that what I did might amend some, but could itself receive no contamination from any.</P>
<P>After reading, I entered upon my ex∣hortation, which was rather calculated at first to amuse them than to reprove. I previ∣ously observed, that no other motive but
<PB N="106" REF="103"/>
their welfare could induce me to this; that I was their fellow prisoner, and now gained nothing by preaching. I was sorry, I said, to hear them so very prophane; because they got nothing by it, but might lose a great deal: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For be assured, my friends,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for you are my friends, how∣ever the world may disclaim your friend∣ship, though you swore twelve thousand oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your purse. Then what signi∣fies calling every moment upon the de∣vil, and courting his friendship, since you find how scurvily he uses you. He has given you nothing here, you find, but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and by the best accounts. I have of him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.<P>"If used ill in our dealings with one man, we naturally go elsewhere. Were it not worth your while then, just to try
<PB N="107" REF="104"/>
how you may like the usage of another mas∣ter, who gives you fair promises at least to come to him. Surely, my Friends, of all stupidity in the world, his must be greatest, who, after robbing an house, runs to the thieftakers for protection. And yet how are you more wise? You are all seeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you, applying to a more malicious being than any thieftaker of them all; for they only decoy, and then hang you; but he decoys and hangs, and what is worst of all, will not let you loose after the hangman has done."</P></Q></P>
<P>When I had concluded, I received the compliments of my audience, some of whom came and shook me by the hand, swearing that I was a very honest fellow, and that they desired my further acquain∣tance. I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived
<PB N="108" REF="105"/>
some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus satisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where my wife had prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours, and partake of the pleasure, as he was kind enough to express it, of my conversation. He had not yet seen my family, for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow pas∣sage, already described, by this means they avoided the common prison. Jenkinson at the first interview therefore seemed not a little struck with the beauty of my young∣est daughter, which her pensive air con∣tributed to heighten, and my little ones did not pass unnoticed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas, Doctor,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"these chil∣dren are too handsome and too good for such a place as this!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="106"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, Mr. Jenkinson,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals, and if they be good, it matters little for the rest."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, sir,"</Q> returned my fellow pri∣soner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it must give you great com∣fort to have this little family about you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A comfort, Mr. Jenkinson,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"yes it is indeed a comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world; for they can make a dungeon seem a palace. There is but one way in this life of wounding my happiness, and that is by injuring them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am afraid then, sir,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I am in some measure culpable; for I think I see here</Q> (looking at my son Mo∣ses) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one that I have injured, and by whom I wish to be forgiven."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="107"/>
My son immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had before seen him in disguise, and taking him by the hand, with a smile forgave him. <Q REND="inline">"Yet,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can't help wondering at what you could see in my face, to think me a proper mark for deception."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear sir,"</Q> returned the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was not your face, but your white stock∣ings and the black ribband in your hair, that allured me. But no disparagement to your parts, I have deceived wiser men than you in my time; and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many for me at last."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I suppose,"</Q> cried my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the narrative of such a life as yours must be extremely instructive and amusing."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not much of either,"</Q> returned Mr. Jenkinson. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Those relations which de∣scribe
<PB N="111" REF="108"/>
the tricks and vices only of man∣kind, by increasing our suspicion in life, retard our success. The traveller that distrusts every person he meets, and turns back upon the appearance of every man that looks like a robber, seldom arrives in time to his journey's end."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed I think from my own experi∣ence I may say, that the knowing one is the silliest fellow under the sun. I was thought cunning from my very child∣hood; when but seven years old the la∣dies would say that I was a perfect little man; at fourteen I knew the world, cocked my hat, and loved the ladies; at twenty, though I was perfectly ho∣nest, yet every one thought me so cun∣ning, that not one would trust me. Thus I was at last obliged to turn shar∣per in my own defence, and have lived ever since, my head throbbing with
<PB N="112" REF="109"/>
schemes to deceive, and my heart pal∣pitating with fears of detection."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I used often to laugh at your honest simple neighbour Flamborough, and one way or another generally cheated him once a year. Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion, and grew rich, while I still continued tricksy and cunning, and was poor, without the consolation of being honest."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"However,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"let me know your case, and what has brought you here; perhaps though I have not skill to avoid a gaol myself, I may ex∣tricate my friends."</Q></P>
<P>In compliance with his curiosity, I in∣formed him of the whole train of acci∣dents and follies that had plunged me into my present troubles, and my utter in∣abilty to get free.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="110"/>
After hearing my story, and pausing some minutes, he slapt his forehead, as if he had hit upon something material, and took his leave, saying he would try what could be done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The same subject continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the scheme I had planned of reforming the prisoners, which they received with universal disap∣probation, alledging the impossibility and impropriety of it; adding, that my endea∣vours would no way contribute to their a∣mendment, but might probably disgrace my calling.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Excuse me,"</Q> returned I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"these peo∣ple, however fallen, are still men, and that is a very good title to my affections. Good council rejected returns to enrich
<PB N="116" REF="112"/>
the giver's bosom; and though the in∣struction I communicate may not mend them, yet it will assuredly mend myself. If these wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thousands ready to offer their ministry; but, in my opini∣on, the heart that is buried in a dun∣geon is as precious as that seated upon a throne. Yes, my treasures, if I can mend them I will; perhaps they will not all despise me. Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulph, and that will be great gain; for is there up∣on earth a gem so precious as the hu∣man soul?"</Q></P>
<P>Thus saying, I left them, and descended to the common prison, where I found the prisoners very merry, expecting my arrival; and each prepared with some gaol trick to play upon the doctor. Thus, as I was go∣ing to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by accident, and then asked my pardon.
<PB N="117" REF="113"/>
A second, who stood at some distance, had a knack of spitting through his teeth, which fell in showers upon my book. A third would cry amen in such an affected tone as gave the rest great delight. A fourth had slily picked my pocket of my spectacles. But there was one whose trick gave more universal pleasure than all the rest; for observing the manner in which I had disposed my books on the table before me, he very dextrously displaced one of them, and put an obscene jest-book of his own in the place. However I took no no∣tice of all that this mischievous groupe of little beings could do; but went on, per∣fectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt, would excite mirth only the first or second time, while what was serious would be permanent. My design succeed∣ed, and in less than six days some were pe∣nitent, and all attentive.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="114"/>
It was now that I applauded my perse∣verance and address, at thus giving sensibi∣lity to wretches divested of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal services also, by rendering their situation somewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided be∣tween famine and excess, tumultous riot and bitter repining. Their only employ∣ment was quarrelling among each other, playing cribbage, and cutting tobacco stop∣pers. From this last mode of idle indus∣try I took the hint of setting such as chose to work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers, the proper wood being bought by a general subscription, and when manu∣factured, sold by my appointment; so that each earned something every day: a trifle indeed, but sufficient to maintain him.</P>
<P>I did not stop here, but instituted fines or the punishment of immorality, and re∣wards for peculiar industry. Thus in less
<PB N="119" REF="115"/>
than a fortnight I had formed them into something social and humane, and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator, who had brought men from their native fe∣rocity into friendship and obedience.</P>
<P>And it were highly to be wished, that legislative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than severity. That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making pu∣nishments familiar, but formidable. In∣stead of our present prisons, which find or make men guilty, which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime, and re∣turn them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetuation of thousands; it were to be wished we had, as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increasing punishments, is the
<PB N="120" REF="116"/>
way to mend a state: nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right which social combinations have assumed of capi∣tally punishing offences of a slight nature. In cases of murder their right is obvious, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of self-defence, to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another. Against such, all nature rises in arms; but it is not so against him who steals my pro∣perty. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine. If then I have any right, it must be from a compact made between us, that he who de∣prives the other of his horse shall die. But this is a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And next the compact is inadequate, and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, since it is far better
<PB N="121" REF="117"/>
that two men should live, than that one man should ride. But a compact that is false between two men, is equally so be∣tween an hundred, or an hundred thou∣sand; for as ten millions of circles can ne∣ver make a square, so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest founda∣tion to falsehood. It is thus that reason speaks, and untutored nature says the same thing. Savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other; they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</P>
<P>Our Saxon ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing govern∣ments that have the print of nature still strong upon them, scarce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P>It is among the citizens of a resined community that penal laws, which are in
<PB N="122" REF="118"/>
the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age; and as if our possessions were become dear∣er in proportion as they increased, as if the more enormous our wealth, the more ex∣tensive our fears, our possessions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to scare every in∣vader.</P>
<P>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiousness of our peo∣ple, that this country should shew more convicts in a year, than half the domini∣ons of Europe united? Perhaps it is ow∣ing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indiscriminate pe∣nal laws a nation beholds the same punish∣ment affixed to dissimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no distinction in the penal∣ty, the people are led to lose all sense of dis∣tinction in the crime, and this distinction is
<PB N="123" REF="119"/>
the bulwark of all morality: thus the mul∣titude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for fresh restraints.</P>
<P>It were to be wished then that power, in∣stead of contriving new laws to punish vice, instead of drawing hard the cords of soci∣ety till a convulsion come to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches as useless, before we have tried their utility, instead of converting correction into vengeance, it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the people. We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we should then find that wretches, now stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury should feel a momentary pang, might, if properly treated, serve to sinew the state in times of danger; that, as their faces are like ours, their hearts are so too; that few minds are so base as that perseverance
<PB N="124" REF="120"/>
cannot amend; that a man may see his last crime without dying for it; and that very little blood will serve to cement our secu∣rity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Happiness and misery rather the result of prudence than of virtue in this life. Temporal evils or felicities being re∣garded by heaven as things merely in themselves trifling and unworthy its care in the distribution.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Had now been confined more than a fortnight, but had not since my arrival been visited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to see her. Having com∣municated my wishes to my wife, the next morning the poor girl entered my apart∣ment, leaning on her sister's arm. The change which I saw in her countenance struck me. The numberless graces that once resided there were now fled, and the hand
<PB N="126" REF="122"/>
of death seemed to have molded every fea∣ture to alarm me. Her temples were sunk, her forehead was tense, and a fatal paleness sate upon her cheek.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am glad to see thee, my dear,"</Q> cri∣ed I; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but why this dejection Livy? I hope, my love, you have too great a re∣gard for me, to permit disappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own. Be chearful child, and we may yet see happier days."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have ever, sir,"</Q> replied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"been kind to me, and it adds to my pain that I shall never have an opportu∣nity of sharing that happiness you pro∣mise. Happiness, I fear, is no longer reserved for me here; and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found distress. Indeed, sir, I wish you would make a proper submission to Mr. Thorn∣hill;
<PB N="127" REF="123"/>
it may, in some measure, induce him to pity you, and it will give me re∣lief in dying."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Never, child,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never shall be brought to acknowledge my daughter a prostitute; for tho' the world may look upon your offence with scorn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not of guilt. My dear, I am no way mi∣serable in this place, however dismal it may seem, and be assured that while you continue to bless me by living, he shall never have my consent to make you more wretched by marrying another."</Q></P>
<P>After the departure of my daughter, my fellow prisoner, who was by at this inter∣view, sensibly enough expostulated upon my obstinacy, in refusing a submission, which promised to give me freedom. He observ∣ed, that the rest of my family was not to be sacrificed to the peace of one child
<PB N="128" REF="124"/>
alone, and she the only one who had of∣fended me. <Q REND="inline">"Beside,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't know if it be just thus to obstruct the union of man and wife, which you do at present, by refusing to consent to a match which you cannot hinder, but may render unhappy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are unac∣quainted with the man that oppresses us. I am very sensible that no submission I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour. I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than last year, died for want. But though my submission and ap∣probation could transfer me from hence, to the most beautiful apartment he is possessed of; yet I would grant neither, as something whispers me that it would be giving a sanction to adultery. While my daughter lives, no other marriage of his shall ever be legal in my eye. Were
<PB N="129" REF="125"/>
she removed, indeed, I should be the basest of men, from any resentment of my own, to attempt putting asunder those who wish for an union. No, vil∣lain as he is, I could then wish him married, to prevent the consequences of his future debaucheries. But should I not now be the most cruel of all fathers, to sign an Instrument which must send my child to the grave, merely to avoid a prison myself; and thus to escape one pang, break my child's heart with a thousand?"</Q></P>
<P>He acquiesced in the justice of this an∣swer, but could not avoid observing, that he feared my daughter's life was already too much wasted to keep me long a pri∣soner. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"However, continued he, though you refuse to submit to the nephew, I hope you have no objections to laying your case before the uncle, who has the first character in the kingdom for every thing that is just and good. I
<PB N="130" REF="126"/>
would advise you to send him a letter by the post, intimating all his nephew's ill usage, and my life for it that in three days you shall have an answer."</Q> I thank'd him for the hint, and instantly fet about complying; but I wanted paper, and un∣luckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provisions, however he supplied me.</P>
<P>For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety, to know what reception my letter might meet with; but in the mean time was frequently solicited by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repea∣ted accounts of the decline of my daugh∣ter's health. The third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no answer to my letter: the complaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew, were no way likely to succeed; so that these hopes soon vanished like all my former. My mind,
<PB N="131" REF="127"/>
however, still supported itself though confinement and bad air began to make a visible alteration in my health, and my arm that had suffered in the fire, grew worse. But my children still sate by me, and while I was stretched on my straw, read to me by turns, or listened and wept at my instructions. But my daughter's health declined faster than mine; every message from her contributed to encrease my apprehensions and pain. The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was sent to sir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that she was speechless. Now it was, that confinement was truly painful to me; my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pil∣low of my child, to comfort, to strengthen her, to receive her last wishes, and teach her soul the way to heaven! Another ac∣count came. She was expiring, and yet I was debarred the small comfort of weep∣ing
<PB N="132" REF="128"/>
by her. My fellow prisoner, some time after, came with the last account. He bade me be patient. She was dead!—The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little ones, now my only companions, who were using all their innocent efforts to comfort me. They entreated to read to me, and bid me not to cry, for I was now too old to weep. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And is not my sister an angel, now, pappa,"</Q> cried the eldest, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and why then are you sorry for her? I wish I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my pappa were with me"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> added my youngest darling, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heaven, where my sister is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good people there, and the people here are very bad."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Jenkinson interupted their harmless prattle, by observing that now my daugh∣ter was no more, I should seriously think of the rest of my family, and attempt to
<PB N="133" REF="129"/>
save my own life, which was every day de∣clining, for want of necessaries and whole∣some air. He added, that it was now in∣cumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own, to the welfare of those who depended on me for support; and that I was now, both by reason and justice, obliged to try to reconcile my land∣lord.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heaven be praised,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there is no pride left me now, I should detest my own heart if I saw either pride or resentment lurking there. On the con∣trary, as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to pre∣sent him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal. No, sir, I have no resentment now, and though he has ta∣ken from me what I held dearer than all his treasures, though he has wrung my heart, for I am sick almost to fainting, very sick, my fellow prisoner, yet that
<PB N="134" REF="130"/>
shall never inspire me with vengeance. I am now willing to approve his mar∣riage, and if this submission can do him any pleasure, let him know, that if I have done him any injury, I am sorry for it."</Q> Mr. Jenkinson took pen and ink, and wrote down my submission nearly as I have exprest it, to which I signed my name, My son was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his seat in the country. He went, and in about six hours returned with a verbal answer. He had some difficulty, he said, to get a sight of his landlord, as the servants were in∣solent and suspicious; but he accidentally saw him as he was going out upon business, preparing for his marriage, which was to be in three days. He continued to inform us, that he stept up in the humblest manner, and delivered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he said that all sub∣mission was now too late and unnecessary; that he had heard of our application to his
<PB N="135" REF="131"/>
uncle, which met with the contempt it deserved; and as for the rest, that all future applications should be directed to his at∣torney, not to him. He observed, how∣ever, that as he had a very good opinion of the discretion of the two young ladies, they might have been the most agreeable intercessors.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, sir,"</Q> said I to my fellow pri∣soner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you now discover the temper of the man that oppresses me. He can at once be facetious and cruel; but let him use me as he will, I shall soon be free, in spite of all his bolts to restrain me. I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it: this expectation cheers my afflictions, and though I shall leave an helpless fa∣mily of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly forsaken; some friend, perhaps, will be found to assist them for the sake of their poor father, and some
<PB N="136" REF="132"/>
may charitably relieve them for the sake of their heavenly father."</Q></P>
<P>Just as I spoke, my wife, whom I had not seen that day before, appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to speak. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my love,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why will you thus encrease my afflic∣tion by your own, what though no sub∣missions can turn our severe master, tho' he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedness, and though we have lost a darling child, yet still you will find comfort in your other children when I shall be no more."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have indeed lost,"</Q> returned she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a darling child. My Sophia, my dearest, is gone, snatched from us, carried off by ruffians!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="133"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How, madam,"</Q> cried my fellow pri∣soner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"miss Sophia carried off by villains, sure it cannot be?"</Q></P>
<P>She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears. But one of the pri∣soner's wives, who was present, and came in with her, gave us a more distinct ac∣count: she informed us that as my wife, my daughter, and herself, were taking a walk together on the great road a little way out of the village, a post - chaise and four drove up to them and instantly stopt. Upon which, a well drest man, but not Mr. Thornhill, stepping out, clasped my daughter round the waist, and forcing her in, bid the postillion drive on, so that they were out of sight in a moment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the sum of my mi∣series is made up, nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to give me another pang. What! not one left! not to leave
<PB N="138" REF="134"/>
me one! the monster! the child that was next my heart! she had the beauty of an angel, and almost the wisdom of an an∣gel. But support that woman, nor let her fall. Not to leave me one!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas! my husband,</Q> said my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you seem to want comfort even more than I. Our distresses are great; but I could bear this and more, if I saw you but easy. They may take away my children and all the world, if they leave me but you."</Q></P>
<P>My Son, who was present, endeavoured to moderate our grief; he bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My child,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"look round the world, and see if there be any happiness left me now. Is not every ray of comfort shut out; while all our bright prospects only lie beyond the grave!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear father,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope there is still something that will give you an in∣terval
<PB N="139" REF="135"/>
of satisfaction; for I have a let∣ter from my brother George"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What of him, child,"</Q> interrupted I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"does he know of our misery. I hope my boy is exempt from any part of what his wretched family suffers?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, sir,"</Q> returned he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he is perfectly gay, chearful, and happy. His letter brings nothing but good news; he is the fa∣vourite of his colonel, who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes vacant!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And are you sure of all this,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are you sure that nothing ill has befallen my boy?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nothing indeed, madam,"</Q> returned my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you shall see the letter, which will give you the highest pleasure; and if any thing can procure you comfort, I am sure that will."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But are you sure,"</Q> still re∣peated she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the letter is from him∣self, and that he is really so happy?</Q>—
<PB N="140" REF="136"/><Q REND="inline margQuotes">Yes, Madam,"</Q> replied he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is cer∣tainly his, and he will one day be the credit and the support of our family!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then I thank providence,"</Q> cried she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that my last letter to him has miscar∣ried."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, my dear,"</Q> continued she," turning to me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will now confess that though the hand of heaven is sore upon us in other instances, it has been favourable here. By the last letter I wrote my son, which was in the bitter∣ness of anger, I desired him, upon his mother's blessing, and if he had the heart of a man, to see justice done his father and sister, and avenge our cause. But thanks be to him that directs all things, it has miscarried, and I am at rest."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Woman,"</Q> cried I <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thou hast done very ill, and at another time my reproaches might have been more severe. Oh! what a tremendous gulph hast thou escaped, that would have buried both thee and him in endless ruin. Providence, indeed,

has here been kinder to us than we to ourselves. It has reserved that son to be the father and protector of my children when I shall be away. How unjustly did I complain of being stript of every com∣fort, when still I hear that he is happy and insensible of our afflictions; still kept in reserve to support his widowed mo∣ther, to protect his brothers and sisters. But what sisters has he left, he has no sis∣ters now, they are all gone, robbed from me, and I am undone."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Father,"</Q> interupted my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I beg you will give me leave to read his letter, I know it will please you."</Q> Upon which, with my permission, he read as follows:<PB N="142" REF="138"/>

Tell them they are two arrant little baggages, and that I am this moment in a most violent pas∣sion with them: yet still, I know not how, tho' I want to bluster a little, my heart is respondent only to softer emotions.

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The equal dealings of providence demon∣strated with regard to the happy and the miserable here below. That from the nature of pleasure and pain, the wretch∣ed must be repaid the balance of their sufferings in the life hereafter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY friends, my children, and fellow sufferers, when I reflect on the di∣stribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to en∣joy, yet still more to suffer. Though we should examine the whole world, we shall not find one man so happy as to have no∣thing left to wish for; but we daily see thousands who by suicide shew us they
<PB N="152" REF="147"/>
have nothing left to hope. In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely blest; but yet we may be completely miserable!</P>
<P>Why man should thus feel pain, why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity, why, when all other systems are made perfect only by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great system should require for its perfection, parts that are not only subordinate to others, but imperfect in themselves? These are questions that never can be explained, and might be useless if known. On this subject providence has thought fit to elude our cu∣riosity, satisfied with granting us motives to consolation.</P>
<P>In this situation, man has called in the friendly assistance of philosophy, and hea∣ven seeing the incapacity of that to console him, has given him the aid of religion.
<PB N="153" REF="148"/>
The consolations of philosophy are very amusing, but often fallacious. It tells us that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have mi∣series here, life is short, and they will soon be over. Thus do these consolations destroy each other; for if life is a place of comfort, its shortness must be misery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philosophy is weak; but religi∣on comforts in an higher strain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here, while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices, shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of
<PB N="154" REF="149"/>
heaven. To religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort; for if already we are happy, it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending, and if we are misera∣ble, it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest. Thus to the fortu∣nate religion holds out a continuance of bliss, to the wretched a change from pain.</P>
<P>But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy; the sick, the naked, the houseless, the heavy-laden, and the prisoner, have ever most frequent promises in our sa∣cred law. The author of our religion every where professes himself the wretch's friend, and unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all his caresses upon the for∣lorn. The unthinking have censured this as partiality, as a preference with∣out
<PB N="155" REF="150"/>
merit to deserve it. But they never re∣flect that it is not in the power even of heaven itself to make the offer of unceas∣ing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable. To the first eternity is but a single blessing, since at most it but encreases what they already possess. To the latter it is a double advantage; for it dimi∣nishes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter.</P>
<P>But providence is in another respect kind∣er to the poor than the rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths the passage there. The wretch∣ed have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of sorrows lays himself quietly down, he has no possessions to re∣gret, and but few ties to stop his departure: he feels only nature's pang in the final separation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for after a certain degree of pain, every
<PB N="156" REF="151"/>
new breach that death opens in the con∣stitution, nature kindly covers with insensi∣bility.</P>
<P>Thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater felicity in dying, and in heaven all that superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment. And this superiority, my friends, is no small advantage, and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was already in heaven, and felt all the rap∣tures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that he had once been wretched and now was comfort∣ed, that he had known what it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you see religion does what philsophy could never do: it shews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy
<PB N="157" REF="152"/>
and the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard. It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal hopes to aspire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here, the poor have the endless satisfaction of know∣ing what it was once to be miserable, when crowned with endless felicity here∣after; and even though this should be called a small advantage, yet being an eternal one, it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by in∣tenseness.</P>
<P>These are therefore the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to them∣selves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind; in other respects they are below them. They who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it.
<PB N="158" REF="153"/>
To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none ei∣ther believe or practise. The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor, and they who want them must be miserable. Yes, my friends, we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature, can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these. Alas! the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain! Death is slight, and any man may sustain it; but torments are dreadful, and these no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us then, my friends, the promises of happiness in heaven should be peculiarly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then indeed of all men the most miserable.
<PB N="159" REF="154"/>
When I look round these gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place, those shackles that tyranny has imposed, or crime made necessary; when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans, O my friends, what a glorious exchange would heaven be for these. To fly through regions unconfined as air, to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss, to carrol over endless hymns of praise, to have no master to threaten or insult us, but the form of goodness himself for ever in our eyes, when I think of these things, death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings; when I think of these things, his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support; when I think of these things, what is there in life worth having; when I think of these things, what is there that should not be spurned away: kings in their palaces should groan for such advan∣tages;
<PB N="160" REF="155"/>
but we, humbled as we are, should yearn for them.</P>
<P>And shall these things be ours? Ours they will certainly be if we but try for them; and what is a comfort, we are shut out from many temptations that would retard our pursuit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and what is still a comfort, shortly too; for if we look back on past life, it appears but a very short span, and whatever we may think of the rest of life, it will yet be found of less duration; as we grow ol∣der, the days seem to grow shorter, and our intimacy with time, ever lessens the perception of his stay. Then let us take comfort now, for we shall soon be at our journey's end; we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us, and though death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and like his
<PB N="161" REF="156"/>
horizon, still flies before him; yet the time will certainly and shortly come, when we shall cease from our toil; when the lux∣urious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth; when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings below; when we shall be surrounded with all our friends, or such as deserved our friendship; when our bliss shall be unutterable, and still, to crown all, unending.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Happier prospects begin to appear. Let us be inflexible, and fortune will at last change in our favour.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN I had thus finished and my au∣dience was retired, the gaoler, who was one of the most humane of his pro∣fession, hoped I would not be displeased, as what he did was but his duty, observing that he must be obliged to remove my son into a stronger cell, but that he should be permitted to revisit me every morning. I thanked him for his clemency, and grasp∣ing my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was be∣fore him.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="158"/>
I again, therefore laid me down, and one of my little ones sate by my bedside read∣ing, when Mr. Jenkinson entering, inform∣ed me that there was news of my daugh∣ter; for that she was seen by a person about two hours before in a strange gentleman's company, and that they had stopt at a neighbouring village for refreshment, and seemed as if returning to town. He had scarce delivered this news, when the gaoler came with looks of haste and pleasure, to inform me, that my daughter was found. Moses came running in a moment after, crying out that his sister Sophy was below and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</P>
<P>Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered, and with looks almost wild with pleasure, ran to kiss me in a transport of affection. Her mother's tears and silence also shewed her pleasure.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here, pappa,"</Q>
<PB N="165" REF="159"/>
cried the charming girl, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"here is the brave man to whom I owe my delivery; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am indebt∣ed for my happiness and safety—"</Q> A kiss from Mr. Burchell, whose pleasure seemed even greater than hers, interrupted what she was going to add.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Mr. Burchell,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is but a wretched habitation you now find us in; and we are now very different from what you last saw us. You were ever our friend: we have long discovered our errors with regard to you, and repented of our ingratitude. After the vile usage you then received at my hands, I am al∣most ashamed to behold your face; yet I hope you'll forgive me, as I was de∣ceived by a base ungenerous wretch, who, under the mask of friendship, has un∣done me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is impossible,"</Q> replied Mr. Burchell. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I should forgive you, as you never
<PB N="166" REF="160"/>
deserved my resentment. I partly saw your delusion then, and as it was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was ever my conjecture,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that your mind was noble; but now I find it so. But tell me, my dear child, how hast thou been relieved, or who the ruffians were who carried thee away?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> replied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as to the villain who brought me off, I am yet ig∣nor ut. For as my mamma and I were walking out, he came behind us, and almost before I could call for help, for∣ced me into the post-chaise, and in an in∣stant the horses drove away. I met se∣veral on the road, to whom I cried out for assistance; but they disregarded my entreaties. In the mean time the ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from crying out: he flattered and threatened
<PB N="167" REF="161"/>
by turns, and swore that if I continued but silent, he intended no harm. In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom should I perceive at some distance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his usual swiftness, with the great stick for which we used so much to ridicule him. As soon as we came within hear∣ing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my ex∣clamations several times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the pos∣tillion stop; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with still greater speed. I now thought he could never overtake us, when in less than a minute I saw Mr. Burchell come running up by the side of the horses, and with one blow knock the postillion to the ground. The horses when he was fallen soon stopt of them∣selves, and the ruffian stepping out, with oaths and menaces drew his sword, and
<PB N="168" REF="162"/>
ordered him at his peril to retire; but Mr. Burchell running up, shivered his sword to pieces, and then pursued him for near a quarter of a mile; but he made his escape. I was at this time come out myself, willing to assist my de∣liverer; but he soon returned to me in triumph. The postillion, who was re∣covered, was going to make his escape too; but Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again, and drive back to town. Finding it impossible to resist, he reluctantly complied, though the wound he had received seemed, to me at least, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove a∣long, so that he at last excited Mr. Bur∣chell's compassion, who, at my request, exchanged him for another at an inn where we called on our return."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Welcome then,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my child, and thou her gallant deliverer, a thousand
<PB N="169" REF="163"/>
welcomes. Though our chear is but wretched, yet our hearts are ready to re∣ceive you. And now, Mr. Burchell, as you have delivered my girl, if you think her a recompence she is yours, if you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine, take her, obtain her consent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine. And let me tell you, Sir, that I give you no small treasure, she has been celebrated for beauty it is true, but that is not my meaning, I give you up a treasure in her mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But I suppose, Sir,"</Q> cried Mr. Burchell, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you are apprized of my circumstances, and of my incapacity to support her as she deserves?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If your present objection,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be meant as an evasion of my offer, I desist: but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you; and if I could give
<PB N="170" REF="164"/>
her thousands, and thousands sought her from me, yet my honest brave Burchell should be my dearest choice."</Q></P>
<P>To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortifying refusal, and without the least reply to my offer, he demanded if we could not be furnished with refreshments from the next inn, to which being answered in the affirmative, he ordered them to send in the best dinner that could be provided upon such short notice. He bespoke also a do∣zen of their best wine; and some cordials for me. Adding, with a smile, that he would stretch a little for once, and tho' in a prison, asserted he was never better disposed to be merry. The waiter soon made his appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the gaoler, who seemed remarkably assiduous, the wine was disposed in order, and two very well∣drest dishes were brought in.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="165"/>
My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy situation, and we all seemed unwilling to damp her chearful∣ness by the relation. But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful, the cir∣cumstances of my unfortunate son broke through all efforts to dissemble; so that I I was at last obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes, and wishing that he might be permitted to share with us in this little interval of satisfaction. After my guests were recovered from the consterna∣tion my account had produced, I requested also that Mr. Jenkinson, a fellow prisoner, might be admitted, and the gaoler granted my request with an air of unusual submis∣sion. The clanking of my son's irons was no sooner heard along the passage, than his sister ran impatiently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell, in the mean time, asked me if my son's name were George, to which replying in the affirmative, he still continued silent. As soon as my boy entered the
<PB N="172" REF="166"/>
room, I could perceive he regarded Mr. Burchell with a look of astonishment and reverence. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come on,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my son, though we are fallen very low, yet providence has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from pain. Thy sister is restored to us, and there is her deliverer: to that brave man it is that I am indebted for yet having a daughter, give him, my boy, the hand of friend∣ship, he deserves our warmest grati∣tude."</Q></P>
<P>My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said, and still continued fixed at respectful distance.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear brother,"</Q> cried his sister, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why don't you thank my good deliverer; the brave should ever love each other."</Q></P>
<P>He still continued his silence and asto∣nishment, till our guest at last perceived himself to be known, and assuming all his
<PB N="173" REF="167"/>
native dignity, desired my son to come for∣ward. Never before had I seen any thing so truly majestic as the air he assumed up∣on this occasion. The greatest object in the universe, says a certain philosopher, is a good man struggling with adversity; yet there is still a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had regarded my son for some time with a superior air, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I again find,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"unthinking boy, that the same crime"</Q> But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler's servants, who came to in∣form us that a person of distinction, who had driven into town with a chariot and several attendants, sent his respects to the gentleman that was with us, and begged to know when he should think proper to be waited upon.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bid the fellow wait,"</Q> cried our guest, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"till I shall have leisure to receive him;"</Q> and then turning to my son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I again find, Sir,"</Q> proceeded he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you are guilty of the same offence
<PB N="174" REF="168"/>
for which you once had my reproof, and for which the law is now preparing its justest punishments. You imagine, per∣haps, that a contempt for your own life, gives you a right to take that of ano∣ther: but where, Sir, is the difference between a duelist who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater security? Is it any dimi∣nution of the gamester's fraud when he alledges that he has staked a coun∣ter?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas, Sir,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whoever you are, pity the poor misguided creature; for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother, who in the bitter∣ness of her resentment required him up∣on her blessing to avenge her quarrel. Here, Sir, is the letter, which will serve to convince you of her imprudence and diminish his guilt."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="169"/>
He took the letter, and hastily read it o∣ver. <Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though not a perfect excuse, is such a palliation of his fault, as induces me to forgive him. And now, Sir,"</Q> continued he, kindly taking my son by the hand, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I see you are surprised at finding me here; but I have often visited prisons upon occa∣sions less interesting. I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most sincere e∣steem. I have long been a dis∣guised spectator of thy father's bene∣volence. I have at his little dwelling enjoyed respect uncontaminated by flat∣tery, and have received that happiness that courts could not give, from the amu∣sing simplicity round his fire-side. My nephew has been apprized of my inten∣tions of coming here, and I find is ar∣rived; it would be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination: if
<PB N="176" REF="170"/>
there be injury, there shall be redress; and this I may say without boasting, that none have ever taxed the injustice of Sir William Thornhill."</Q></P>
<P>We now found the personage whom we had so long entertained as an harmless a∣musing companion was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhill, to whose virtues and singularities scarce any were strangers. The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large fortune and great in∣terest, to whom senates listened with ap∣plause, and whom party heard with con∣viction; who was the friend of his coun∣try, but loyal to his king. My poor wife recollecting her former familiarity, seemed to shrink with apprehension; but Sophia, who a few moments before thought him her own, now perceiving the immense dis∣tance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal her tears.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="171"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir,"</Q> cried my wife, with a pi∣teous aspect, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how is it possible that I can ever have your forgiveness; the slights you received from me the last time I had the honour of seeing you at our house, and the jokes which I audaciously threw out, these jokes, Sir, I fear can never be forgiven."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear good lady,"</Q> returned he with a smile, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if you had your joke, I had my answer: I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not as good as yours. To say the truth, I know no body whom I am dis∣posed to be angry with at present but the fellow who so frighted my little girl here. I had not even time to examine the ras∣cal's person so as to describe him in an ad∣vertisement. Can you tell me, Sophia, my dear, whether you should know him again?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> replied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can't be positive; yet now I recollect he had
<PB N="178" REF="172"/>
a large mark over one of his eye-brows."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I ask pardon, madam,"</Q> interrupted Jen∣kinson, who was by, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but be so good as to inform me if the fellow wore his own red hair?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, I think so,"</Q> cried Sophia.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And did your honour,"</Q> conti∣nued he, turning to Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"observe the length of his legs?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can't be sure of their length,"</Q> cried the Baronet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I am convinced of their swiftness; for he out-ran me, which is what I thought few men in the kingdom could have done."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Please your honour,"</Q> cried Jen∣kinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know the man: it is certainly the same; the best runner in England; he has beaten Pinwire of Newcastle, Timothy Baxter is his name, I know him perfectly, and the very place of his retreat this mo∣ment. If your honour will bid Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to produce him to you in an hour at far∣thest."</Q> Upon this the gaoler was called, who instantly appearing, Sir William de∣manded

if he knew him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, please your honour,"</Q> reply'd the gaoler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know Sir William Thornhill well, and every body that knows any thing of him, will desire to know more of him."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well then,"</Q> said the Baronet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my request is, that you will permit this man and two of your servants to go upon a message by my authority, and as I am in the commission of the peace, I undertake to secure you."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your promise is suf∣ficient,"</Q> replied the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and you may at a minute's warning send them over England whenever your honour thinks fit."</Q></P>
<P>In pursuance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkinson was dispatched in search of Ti∣mothy Baxter, while we were amused with the assiduity of our youngest boy Bill, who had just come in and climbed up to Sir William's neck in order to kiss him. His mother was immediately going to chastise
<PB N="180" REF="174"/>
his familiarity, but the worthy man pre∣vented her; and taking the child, all rag∣ged as he was, upon his knee, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, Bill, you chubby rogue,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do you remember your old friend Burchell; and Dick too, my honest veteran, are you here, you shall find I have not forgot you."</Q> So saying, he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fel∣lows eat very heartily, as they had got that morning but a very scanty breakfast.</P>
<P>We now sate down to dinner, which was almost cold; but previously, my arm still continuing painful, Sir William wrote a prescription, for he had made the study of physic his amusement, and was more than moderately skilled in the profession: this being sent to an apothecary who lived in the place, my arm was dressed, and I found almost instantaneous relief. We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler himself, who was willing to do our guest all the ho∣nour
<PB N="181" REF="175"/>
in his power. But before we had well dined, another message was brought from his nephew, desiring permission to appear, in order to vindicate his innocence and ho∣nour, with which request the Baronet com∣plied, and desired Mr. Thornhill to be introduced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Former benevolence now repaid with unex∣pected interest.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Thornhill made his entrance with a smile, which he seldom wanted, and was going to embrace his uncle, which the other repulsed with an air of disdain. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No fawning, Sir, at present,"</Q> cried the Baronet, with a look of severity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the only way to my heart is by the road of honour; but here I only see complicated instances of falsehood, cowardice, and oppression. How is it, Sir, that this poor man, for whom I know you professed a friendship, is used thus hardly? His daughter vilely seduced, as a recompence
<PB N="184" REF="177"/>
for his hospitality, and he himself thrown into a prison perhaps but for resenting the insult? His son too, whom you feared to face as a man—"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it possible, Sir,"</Q> interrupted his nephew, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that my uncle could object that as a crime which his repeated instruc∣tions alone have persuaded me to avoid."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your rebuke,"</Q> cried Sir William <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is just; you have acted in this instance pru∣dently and well, though not quite as your father would have done: my brother indeed was the soul of honour; but thou—yes you have acted in this instance perfectly right, and it has my warmest approbation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I hope,"</Q> said his nephew, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the rest of my conduct will not be found to deserve censure. I appeared, Sir, with this gentleman's daughter at some places
<PB N="185" REF="178"/>
of public amusement; thus what was le∣vity, scandal called by a harsher name, and it was reported that I had debauch∣ed her. I waited on her father in per∣son, willing to clear the thing to his sa∣tisfaction, and he received me only with insult and abuse. As for the rest, with regard to his being here, my attorney and steward can best inform you, as I commit the management of business en∣tirely to them. If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them, it is their business to proceed in this manner, and I see no hardship or in∣justice in pursuing the most legal means of redress."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If this,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be as you have stated it, there is nothing un∣pardonable in your offence, and though your conduct might have been more ge∣nerous in not suffering this gentleman to be oppressed by subordinate tyranny, yet it has been at least equitable."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="179"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He cannot contradict a single particu∣lar,"</Q> replied the 'Squire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I defy him to do so, and several of my servants are ready to attest what I say. Thus, Sir,"</Q> continued he, finding that I was silent, for in fact I could not contradict him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thus, Sir, my own innocence is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to for∣give this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to lessen me in your e∣steem, excite a resentment that I cannot govern. And this too at a time when his son was actually preparing to take away my life; this, I say, was such guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its course. I have here the challenge that was sent me and two witnesses to prove it; and even though my uncle himself should dissuade me, which I know he will not, yet I will see public justice done, and he shall suffer for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thou monster,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"hast thou not had vengeance enough al∣ready,
<PB N="187" REF="180"/>
but must my poor boy feel thy cruelty. I hope that good Sir William will protect us, for my son is as inno∣cent as a child; I am sure he is, and ne∣ver did harm to man."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied the good man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your wishes for his safety are not greater than mine; but I am sorry to find his guilt too plain; and if my nephew per∣sists—"</Q>But the appearance of Jen∣kinson and the gaoler's two servants now called off our attention, who entered, haling in a tall man, very genteelly drest, and answering the description al∣ready given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter—<Q REND="inline">"Here,"</Q> cried Jen∣kinson, pulling him in, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"here we have him, and if ever there was a candidate for tyburn, this is one."</Q></P>
<P>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the prisoner, and Jenkinson, who had him
<PB N="188" REF="181"/>
in custody, he seemed to shrink back with terror. His face became pale with consci∣ous guilt, and he would have withdrawn; but Jenkinson, who perceived his design, stopt him—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, 'Squire,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are you ashamed of your two old acquain∣tances, Jenkinson and Baxter: but this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am resolved we will not forget you. Our prisoner, please your honour,"</Q> continued he, turning to Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"has already confessed all. He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who first put him upon this affair, that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman, and furnished him with the post-chaise. The plan was laid be∣tween them that he should carry off the young lady to a place of safety, and that there he should threaten and terrify her; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in in the mean time, as if by accident, to her rescue, and that they should fight awhile
<PB N="189" REF="182"/>
and then he was to run off, by which Mr. Thornhill would have the better op∣portunity of gaining her affections him∣self under the character of her defender."</Q></P>
<P>Sir William remembered the coat to have been frequently worn by his nephew, and all the rest the prisoner himself confirmed by a more circumstantial account; concluding, that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both sisters at the same time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heavens,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what a viper have I been fostering in my bo∣som! And so fond of public justice too as he seemed to be. But he shall have it; secure him, Mr. Gaoler—yet hold, I fear there is not legal evidence to de∣tain him."</Q></P>
<P>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the ut∣most humility, entreated that two such a∣bandoned wretches might not be admitted
<PB N="190" REF="183"/>
as evidences against him, but that his ser∣vants should be examined.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your ser∣vants,"</Q> replied Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wretch, call them yours no longer: but come let us hear what those fellows have to say, let his butler be called."</Q></P>
<P>When the butler was introduced, he soon perceived by his former master's looks that all his power was now over. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tell me,"</Q> cried Sir William sternly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"have you ever seen your master and that fellow drest up in his cloaths in company together?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "Yes, please your honour,"</Q> cried the butler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a thousand times: he was the man that always brought him his ladies."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this to my face!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> replied the butler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, Master Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now then,"</Q> cried Jenkinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tell his
<PB N="191" REF="184"/>
honour whether you know any thing of me."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can't say,"</Q> replied the butler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I know much good of you. The night that gentleman's daughter was de∣luded to our house, you were one of them."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So then,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find you have brought a very fine wit∣ness to prove your innocence: thou stain to humanity! to associate with such wretches!"</Q> (But continuing his exami∣nation) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You tell me, Mr. Butler, that this was the person who brought him this old gentleman's daughter."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, please your honour,"</Q> replied the butler, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he did not bring her, for the 'Squire him∣self undertook that business; but he brought the priest that pretended to marry them."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is but too true,"</Q> cried Jen∣kinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I cannot deny it, that was the employment assigned me, and I confess it to my confusion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good heavens!"</Q> exclaimed the Baronet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how every new discovery of his villainy
<PB N="192" REF="185"/>
alarms me. All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his present prosecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice and revenge; at my request, Mr. Gaoler, set this young officer, now your prisoner, free, and trust to me for the consequences. I'll make it my business to set the affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate who has committed him. But where is the unfortunate young lady herself: let her appear to confront this wretch, I long to know by what arts he has seduced her honour. Entreat her to come in. Where is she?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that question stings me to the heart: I was once indeed hap∣py in a daughter, but her miseries—"</Q>Another interruption here prevented me; for who should make her appearance but Miss Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been married to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her surprize at seeing
<PB N="193" REF="186"/>
Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that she and the old gentle∣man her father were passing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr. Thorn∣hill should be consummated at her house; but stopping for refreshment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there from the window that the young lady happened to observe one of my little boys playing in the street, and instantly sending a footman to bring the child to her, she learnt from him some account of our misfortunes; but was still kept igno∣rant of young Mr. Thornhill's being the cause. Though her father made several remonstrances on the impropriety of going to a prison to visit us, yet they were ineffectual; she desired the child to conduct her, which he did, and it was thus she sur∣prised us at a juncture so unexpected.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="187"/>
Nor can I go on, without a reflection on those accidental meetings, which, though they happen every day, seldom excite our surprize but upon some extraordinary occa∣sion. To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives. How many seeming accidents must unite before we can be cloathed or fed. The peasant must be disposed to la∣bour, the shower must fall, the wind fill the merchant's sail, or numbers must want the usual supply.</P>
<P>We all continued silent for some mo∣ments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compassion and astonishment, which gave new finishings to her beauty. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, my dear Mr. Thorn∣hill,"</Q> cried she to the 'Squire, who she supposed was come here to succour and not to oppress us. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I take it a little un∣kindly that you should come here with∣out
<PB N="195" REF="188"/>
me, or never inform me of the situ∣ation of a family so dear to us both: you know I should take as much pleasure in contributing to the relief of my reve∣rend old master here, whom I shall ever esteem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a pleasure in doing good in secret."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He find pleasure in doing good!"</Q> cri∣ed Sir William, interrupting her. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, my dear, his pleasures are as base as he is. You see in him, madam, as com∣plete a villain as ever disgraced humanity. A wretch, who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting against the innocence of her sister, has thrown the father into prison, and the eldest son into fetters, because he had courage to face his betrayer. And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an escape from the embraces of such a monster."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="189"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O goodness,"</Q> cried the lovely girl, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how have I been deceived! Mr. Thornhill informed me for certain that this gentle∣man's eldest son, Captain Primrose, was gone off to America with his new-married lady."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My sweetest miss,"</Q> cried my wife, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he has told you nothing but false∣hoods. My son George never left the kingdom, nor never was married. Tho' you have forsaken him, he has al∣ways loved you too well to think of any body else; and I have heard him say he would die a batchellor for your sake."</Q> She then proceeded to expatiate upon the sincerity of her son's passion, she set his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light, from thence she made a rapid digression to the 'Squire's debaucheries, his pretended marri∣ages, and ended with a most insulting pic∣ture of his cowardice.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="190"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good heavens!"</Q> cried Miss Wilmot, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how very near have, I been to the brink of ruin! But how great is my pleasure to have escaped it! Ten thousand false∣hoods has this gentleman told me! He had at last art enough to persuade me that my promise to the only man I esteemed was no longer binding, since he had been un∣faithful. By his falsehoods I was taught to detest one equally brave and gene∣rous!"</Q></P>
<P>But by this time my son was freed from the incumbrances of justice. Mr. Jenkin∣son also, who had acted as his valet de chambre, had dressed up his hair, and fur∣nished him with whatever was necessary to make a genteel appearance. He now there∣fore entered, handsomely drest in his re∣gimentals, and, without vanity, (for I am above it) he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.
<PB N="198" REF="191"/>
As he entered, he made Miss Wilmot a mo∣dest and distant bow, for he was not as yet acquainted with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour. But no decorums could re∣strain the impatience of his blushing mis∣tress to be forgiven. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to discover the real sensations of her heart for having forgotten her former promise and having suffered herself to be deluded by an impostor. My son appeared amazed at her condescension, and could scarce believe it real.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sure, madam,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is but delusion! I can ne∣ver have merited this! To be blest thus is to be too happy."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir,"</Q> re∣plied she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have been deceived, basely deceived, else nothing could have ever made me unjust to my promise. You know my friendship, you have long known it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warmest vows of
<PB N="199" REF="192"/>
constancy, you shall now have them repeated; and be assured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, she shall never be another's."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And no other's you shall be,"</Q> cried Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I have any influence with your father."</Q></P>
<P>This hint was sufficient for my son Moses, who immediately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of eve∣ry circumstance that had happened. But in the mean time the 'Squire perceiving that he was on every side undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or dissimulation, concluded that his wisest way would be to turn and face his pursuers. Thus laying aside all shame, he appeared the open hardy villain. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I am to expect no justice here; but I am resolved it shall be done me. You shall know, Sir,"</Q> turning to Sir William, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am no
<PB N="200" REF="193"/>
longer a poor dependant upon your fa∣vours. I scorn them. Nothing can keep Miss Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's assiduity, is pretty large. The articles, and a bond for her fortune, are signed, and safe in my pos∣session. It was her fortune, not her per∣son, that induced me to wish for this match, and possessed of the one, let whose will take the other."</Q></P>
<P>This was an alarming blow, Sir Willi∣am was sensible of the justice of his claims, for he had been instrumental in drawing up the marriage articles himself. Miss Wil∣mot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irretrievably lost, turning to my son, she asked if the loss of fortune could lessen her value to him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Though fortune,"</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is out of my power, at least I have my hand to give."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="194"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And that, madam,"</Q> cried her real lover, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was indeed all that you ever had to give; at least all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now protest, my Arabella, by all that's happy, your want of fortune this moment encreases my pleasure, as it serves to convince my sweet girl of my sincerity."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he seemed not a little pleased at the danger his daugh∣ter had just escaped, and readily consented to a dissolution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was secured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing could exceed his disappointment. He now saw that his money must all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a rascal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He sate therefore for some minutes employed in the most mortifying speculations, till Sir William attempted to
<PB N="202" REF="195"/>
lessen his anxiety.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I must confess, Sir,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that your present disappoint∣ment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished. But tho' the young lady cannot be rich, she has still a com∣petence sufficient to give content. Here you see an honest young soldier, who is wil∣ling to take her without fortune; they have long loved each other, and for the friendship I bear his father, my interest shall not be wanting for his promotion. Leave then that ambition which disap∣points you, and for once admit hap∣happiness which courts your acceptance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir William,"</Q> replied the old gentle∣man, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be assured I never yet forced her inclinations, nor will I now. If she still continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart. There is still, thank heaven, some fortune left, and your promise will make it
<PB N="203" REF="196"/>
something more. Only let my old friend here (meaning me) give me a promise of settling six thousand pounds upon my girl, if ever he should come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the first to join them toge∣ther."</Q></P>
<P>As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy, I readi∣ly gave a promise of making the settle∣ment he required, which, to one who had such little expectations as I, was no great favour. We had now therefore the satis∣faction of seeing them fly into each other's arms in a transport. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After all my misfor∣tunes,"</Q> cried my son George, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be thus rewarded! Sure this is more than I could ever have presumed to hope for. To be possessed of all that's good, and after such an interval of pain! My warmest wishes could never rise so high!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, my George,"</Q> returned his
<PB N="204" REF="197"/>
lovely bride, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"now let the wretch take my fortune; since you are happy without it so am I. O what an exchange have I made from the basest of men to the dearest best!—Let him enjoy our fortune, I now can be happy even in indigence."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I promise you,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, with a malicious grin, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I shall be very happy with what you despise."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hold, hold, Sir,"</Q> cried Jenkinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there are two words to that bargain. As for that lady's fortune, Sir, you shall never touch a single stiver of it. Pray your honour,"</Q> continued he to Sir William," <Q REND="inline margQuotes">can the 'Squire have this lady's fortune if he be married to ano∣ther?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How can you make such a simple demand,"</Q> replied the Baronet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"undoubtedly he cannot."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sorry for that,"</Q> cried Jenkinson; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow sporters, I have a friendship for him. But I must declare, well as I love him, that his contract is not worth a tobacco
<PB N="205" REF="198"/>
stopper, for he is married already."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You lie, like a rascal,"</Q> returned the 'Squire, who seemed rouzed by this insult, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never was legally married to any wo∣man."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, begging your honour's pardon,"</Q> replied the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you were; and I hope you will shew a proper re∣turn of friendship to your own honest Jenkinson, who brings you a wife, and if the company restrains their curiosity a few minutes, they shall see her."</Q>—So saying he went off with his usual celerity, and left us all unable to form any proba∣ble conjecture as to his design.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay let him go,"</Q> cried the 'Squire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whatever else I may have done I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened with squibs."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am surprised,"</Q> said the Baronet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what the fellow can intend by this. Some low piece of humour I suppose!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps, Sir,"</Q> replied I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he may have
<PB N="206" REF="199"/>
a more serious meaning. For when we reflect on the various schemes this gen∣tleman laid to seduce innocence, perhaps some one more artful than the rest has been found able to deceive him. When we consider what numbers he has ru∣ined, how many parents now feel with anguish the infamy and the contamination which he has brought into their families, it would not surprise me if some one of them—Amazement! Do I see my lost daugh∣ter! Do I hold her! It is, it is my life, my happiness. I thought thee lost, my Olivia, yet still I hold thee—and still shalt thou live to bless me."</Q>—The warmest trans∣ports of the fondest lover were not great∣er than mine when I saw him introduce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, whose silence only spoke her raptures. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And art thou returned to me, my dar∣ling,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be my comfort in age!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That she is,"</Q> cried Jenkinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and make much of her, for she is your
<PB N="207" REF="200"/>
own honourable child, and as honest a woman as any in the whole room, let the other be who she will. And as for you 'Squire, as sure as you stand there this young lady is your lawful wedded wife. And to convince you that I speak no∣thing but truth, here is the licence by which you were married together."</Q>—So saying, he put the licence into the Ba∣ronet's hands, who read it, and found it perfect in every respect. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And now, gen∣tlemen,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find you are surprised at all this; but a few words will explain the difficulty. That there 'Squire of renown, for whom I have a great friendship, but that's between ourselves, has often employed me in doing odd lit∣tle things for him. Among the rest, he commissioned me to procure him a false licence and a false priest, in order to de∣ceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do but went and got a true licence and a true priest,
<PB N="208" REF="201"/>
and married them both as fast as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'll think it was generosity that made me do all this. But no. To my shame I confess it, my only design was to keep the licence and let the 'Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and so make him come down whenever I wanted money."</Q> A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the whole apart∣ment; our joy reached even to the com∣mon room, where the prisoners themselves sympathized,<Q><L><HI>And shook their chains</HI></L>
<L><HI>In transport and rude harmony.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Happiness expanded upon every face, and even Olivia's cheek seemed flushed with pleasure. To be thus restored to reputa∣tion, to friends and fortune at once, was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of de∣cay and restore former health and vivacity. But perhaps among all there was not one
<PB N="209" REF="202"/>
who felt sincerer pleasure than I. Still holding the dear-loved child in my arms, I asked my heart if these transports were not delusion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">How could you,"</Q> cried I, turn∣ing to Mr. Jenkinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recom∣pence for the pain."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As to your question,"</Q> replied Jenkin∣son, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that is easily answered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison, was by submitting to the 'Squire, and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady. But these you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living, there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by persuading you that she was dead. I prevailed on your wise to join in the de∣ceit, and we have not had a fit oppor∣tunity of undeceiving you till now."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="203"/>
In the whole assembly now there only ap∣peared two faces that did not glow with transport. Mr. Thornhill's assurance had entirely forsaken him: he now saw the gulph of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the plunge. He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle, and in a voice of piercing misery implored compas∣sion. Sir William was going to spurn him away, but at my request he raised him, and after pausing a few moments, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thy vices, crimes, and ingratitude,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"de∣serve no tenderness; yet thou shalt not be entirely forsaken, a bare competence shall be supplied, to support the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, shall be put in pos∣session of a third part of that fortune which once was thine, and from her ten∣derness alone thou art to expect any extraordinary supplies for the future."</Q> He was going to express his gratitude for such kindness in a set speech; but the
<PB N="211" REF="204"/>
Baronet prevented him by bidding him not aggravate his meanness, which was already but too apparent. He ordered him at the same time to be gone, and from all his for∣mer domestics to chuse one such as he should think proper, which was all that should be granted to attend him.</P>
<P>As soon as he left us, Sir William very politely stept up to his new niece with a a smile, and wished her joy. His example was followed by Miss Wilmot and her fa∣ther; my wife too kissed her daughter with much affection, as, to use her own expression, she was now made an honest woman of. So∣phia and Moses followed in turn, and even our benefactor Jenkinson desired to be ad∣mitted to that honour. Our satisfaction seemed scarce capable of increase. Sir Wil∣liam, whose greatest pleasure was in doing good, now looked round with a counte∣nance open as the sun, and saw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of
<PB N="212" REF="205"/>
my daughter Sophia, who, for some rea∣sons we could not comprehend, did not seem perfectly satisfied. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think now,"</Q> cried he, with a smile, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that all the com∣pany, except one or two, seem perfectly happy. There only remains an act of justice for me to do. You are sensible, Sir,"</Q> continued he, turning to me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of the obligations we both owe Mr. Jenkinson for his late assiduity in detecting a scoun∣drel. It is but just we should both re∣ward him for it. Your youngest daugh∣ter, Miss Sophia, will, I am sure, make him very happy, and he shall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune, and upon this I am sure they can live very comfortably together. Come, Miss Sophia, what say you to this match of my making? Will you have him?"</Q>—My poor girl seemed almost sinking into her mother's arms at the hideous proposal.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Have him, Sir!"</Q> cried she faintly. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, never."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">What,"</Q> cried he again,
<PB N="213" REF="206"/><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not have Mr. Jenkinson, your benefactor, an handsome young fellow, with five hun∣dred pounds and good expectations!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I beg, Sir,"</Q> returned she, scarce able to speak, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you'll desist, and not make me so very wretched."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Was ever such obstinacy known,"</Q> cried he again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to refuse a man whom the family has such infinite obligations to, who has preserved your sister. What not have him!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, never,"</Q> replied she, angrily, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'd sooner die first."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that be the case then,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if you will not have him—I think I must have you myself."</Q> And so saying, he caught her to his breast with ardour. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My love∣liest, my most sensible of girls,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how could you ever think your own Bur∣chell could deceive you, or that Sir Wil∣liam Thornhill could ever cease to admire a mistress that loved him for himself a∣lone? I have for some years sought for a woman, who a stranger to my fortune
<PB N="214" REF="207"/>
could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even amongst the pert and the ugly, how great at last must be my rapture to have made a conquest over such sense and such hea∣venly beauty."</Q> Then turning to Jen∣kinson, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As I cannot, Sir, part with this young lady myself, for she has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the re∣compence I can make is to give you her fortune, and you may call upon my stew∣ard to-morrow for five hundred pounds."</Q> Thus we had all our compliments to re∣peat, and Lady Thornhill underwent the same round of ceremony that her sisters had done before. In the mean time Sir Willi∣am's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where every thing was prepared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left those gloomy mansions of sorrow. The generous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be distributed among the prisoners, and
<PB N="215" REF="208"/>
Mr. Wilmot, induced by his example, gave half that sum. We were received be∣low by the shouts of the villagers, and I saw and shook by the hand two or three of my honest parishioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn, where a sumptuous entertainment was pro∣vided, and coarser provisions distributed in great quantities among the populace.</P>
<P>After supper, as my spirits were exhausted by the alternation of pleasure and pain which they had sustained during the day, I asked permission to withdraw, and leaving the company in the midst of their mirth, as soon as I found myself alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of sorrow, and then slept undisturbed till morning.</P>

<P>The Conclusion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next morning as soon as I awaked I found my eldest son sitting by my bedside, who came to encrease my joy with another turn of fortune in my favour. First having released me from the settlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arrested at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors. My boy's generosity pleased me almost as much as this unlooked for good fortune. But I had some doubts whether I
<PB N="218" REF="210"/>
ought in justice to accept his offer. While I was pondering upon this, Sir William en∣tered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion was, that as my son was already possessed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any hesitation. His business, however, was to inform me that as he had the night before sent for the licences, and ex∣pected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refuse my assistance in making all the company happy that morning. A footman entered while we were speaking, to tell us that the messenger was returned, and as I was by this time ready, I went down, where I found the whole company as merry as afflu∣ence and innocence could make them. How∣ever, as they were now preparing for a very solemn ceremony, their laughter entirely dis∣pleased me. I told them of the grave, becom∣ing and sublime deportment they should as∣sume upon this mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own
<PB N="219" REF="211"/>
composing, in order to prepare them. Yet they still seemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gra∣vity had quite forsaken them, and I was of∣ten tempted to turn back in indignation. In church a new dilemma arose, which pro∣mised no easy solution. This was, which couple should be married first; my son's bride warmly insisted, that Lady Thornhill, (that was to be) should take the lead; but this the other refused with equal ardour, protesting she would not be guilty of such rudeness for the world. The argument was supported for some time between both with equal obstinacy and good breeding. But as I stood all this time with my book ready, I was at last quite tired of the contest, and shutting it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I perceive,"</Q> cried I, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again; for I suppose
<PB N="220" REF="212"/>
there will be no business done here to∣day."</Q>—This at once reduced them to reason. The Baronet and his Lady were first married, and then my son and his lovely partner.</P>
<P>I had previously that morning given orders that a coach should be sent for my honest neighbour Flamborough and his family, by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the pleasure of finding the two Miss Flamboroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkinson gave his hand to the eldest, and my son Mo∣ses led up the other; (and I have since found that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my consent and bounty he shall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them.) We were no sooner re∣turned to the inn, but numbers of my pa∣rishioners, hearing of my success, came to congratulate me, but among the rest were those who rose to rescue me, and whom
<PB N="221" REF="213"/>
I formerly rebuked with such sharpness. I told the story to Sir William, my son-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great severity; but finding them quite dis∣heartened by his harsh reproof, he gave them half a guinea a piece to drink his health and raise their dejected spirits.</P>
<P>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel entertainment, which was drest by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to observe with respect to that gentleman, that he now resides in quality of companion at a relation's house, being very well liked and seldom sitting at the side-table, except when there is no room at the other; for they make no stranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keep∣ing his relation, who is a little melancholy, in spirits, and in learning to blow the French-horn. My eldest daughter, however, still remembers him with regret; and she has
<PB N="222" REF="214"/>
even told me, though I make a great secret of it, that when he reforms she may be brought to relent. But to return, for I am not apt to digress thus, when we were to sit down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The question was whether my eldest daughter, as being a matron, should not sit above the two young brides, but the debate was cut short by my son George, who proposed, that the company should sit indiscriminately, every gentleman by his lady, This was re∣ceived with great approbation by all, ex∣cepting my wife, who I could perceive was not perfectly satisfied, as she expected to have had the pleasure of sitting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company. But notwithstanding this, it is impossible to describe our good hu∣mour. I can't say whether we had more wit amongst us now than usual; but I am certain we had more laughing, which an∣swered the end as well. One jest I parti∣cularly
<PB N="223" REF="215"/>
remember, old Mr. Wilmot drink∣ing to Moses, whose head was turned ano∣ther way, my son replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Madam, I thank you."</Q> Upon which the old gen∣tleman, winking upon the rest of the com∣pany, observed that he was thinking of his mistress. At which jest I thought the two miss Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I re∣quested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my fa∣mily assembled once more by a chearful fire-side. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeak∣able. It now only remained that my grati∣tude in good fortune should exceed my for∣mer submission in adversity.</P>
