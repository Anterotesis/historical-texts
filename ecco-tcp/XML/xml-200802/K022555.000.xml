<P>New Hay at the Old Market; AN OCCASIONAL DRAMA, IN ONE ACT: WRITTEN BY GEORGE COLMAN, (THE YOUNGER,) ON OPENING THE Hay-Market Theatre. On the 9th of <HI>JUNE,</HI> 1795.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be necessary to inform the Reader, who has not seen the following Sketch represented on the Stage, that the character of <HI>Apewell</HI> is meant merely as a vehicle for Mr. Caulfield's <HI>Imitations:</HI> with which both the Mimick, and the Author of the Piece, are con∣vinced, the respectable persons imitated, have too much good sense to be offended. They are given as <HI>Portraits,</HI> not as <HI>Caricatures;</HI> and the Publick has pronounced them to be strong, but unexaggerated likenesses of originals, whom its discernment has long patronised and admired.</P>
<P>Although the Author has been a litte free with his good friends the Winter Managers, (who are a little free with his Season) he thinks it needless to offer any apology to them. He is upon too good a footing with them to suppose that they expect it. Friends and neigh∣bours may joke with each other. <Q>Tap for tap, and so part fair.</Q></P>

<P>EIGHT, nine, ten, eleven!—Zounds! Eleven o'clock; and here have I been waiting ever since Nine, for an interview with the Manager.</P>

<P>Harkye, young man! Is your master visible yet?</P>

<P>Oh! that, Sir, is a gentleman who wants to come out.</P>

<P>Come out! Then wake him, and open the door. Gad, the great difficulty, at this house, is to get in.</P>

<P>Ha, Ha! I mean he wants to appear on the Stage, Sir. 'Tis Mr, Sylvester Daggerwood, of the Dunstable Company.</P>

<P>Oho! A country candidate for a London trun∣cheon. A sucking Prince of Denmark—damme, he snores like a Tinker. Fatigued with his jour∣ney, I suppose.</P>

<P>No, Sir—he has taken a nap in this room these five mornings—but hasn't been able to obtain an audience, here, yet.</P>

<P>No, nor at Dunstable neither, I take it.</P>

faith, and very often the first course, too; when a dinner is unavoidably defer'd, by your humble servant to command, Sylvester Daggerwood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry Sir, you should ever have occasion to postpone so pleasant a performance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eating, Sir, is a most popular entertainment. An entertainment for man and horse, as I may say. But I am apt to appear nice, Sir—and, some how or other, I never could manage to sit down to din∣ner in a bad Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has your company been bad, then, of late, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn'd bad indeed, Sir—The Dunstable Com∣pany:—where I have eight shillings a week, four bits of candle, one wife, three shirts, and nine children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very numerous family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>A crowded house, to be sure, Sir; but not pro∣fitable. Mrs. Daggerwood a fine figure, but un∣fortunately stutters; so, of no use in the theatrieal line. Children too young to make a <HI>debut</HI>—except
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
my eldest, Master Apollo Daggerwood; a youth of only eight years old; who has twice made his ap∣pearance in Tom Thumb, to an overflowing and brilliant barn—house, I mean—with unbounded and universal applause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you been long upon the Stage Mr. Dag∣gerwood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifteen years since I first smelt the lamp, Sir. My father was an eminent Button-maker, at Bir∣mingham; and meant to marry me to Miss Molly Metre, daughter to the rich Director of the Coal-works, at Wolverhampton: but I had a soul above buttons, and abhorred the idea of a mer∣cenary marriage. I panted for a liberal profession —so ran away from my father, and engaged with a travelling company of Comedians. In my travels, I had soon the happiness of forming a romantick attachment with the present Mrs. Daggerwood— wife to Sylvester Daggerwood, your humble ser∣vant to command, whose benefit is fixed for the eleventh of June, by the particular desire of several persons of distinction. So, you see, Sir, I have a taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you! Then sit down, and I'll read you my Tragedy. I am determined somebody shall hear it before I go out of the house. <STAGE>sits down</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Tragedy!—Sir, Ill be ready for you in a moment. Let me prepare for woe. <STAGE>takes out a very ragged pocket-handkerchief.</STAGE></P>
<Q><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>"This handkerchief,</L>
<L>"Did an Egyptian to my mother give."</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I should think so:—and, to all appear∣ance one of the Norwood party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, your title; and then for the <HI>Dram. Pers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The title, I think will strike. The fashion of Plays, you know, now, is to do away old preju∣dices; and to rescue certain characters from the illiberal odium with which custom has mark'd them. Thus we have a generous Israelite, an amiable Cynick, and so on. Now, Sir, I call my play—<HI>The Humane Footpad.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>What!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a title for you! Isn't it happy?—eh? How do you like my footpad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph!—Why I think he'll strike—but then he ought to be properly executed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FUSTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, let me alone for that. An exception to a general rule is, now, the grand secret for dra∣matick composition. Mine is a freebooter of be∣nevolence, and plunders with sentiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>DAGGERWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be something in that: and for my part, I was always with Shakespeare.
<Q>"Who steals my purse steals trash."</Q>
I never had any weighty reasons, yet, for think∣ing otherwise. Now, Sir, as we say, please to "leave your damnable faces, and begin."</P>

<P>It doesn't signifye talking, master Carpenter: —new scenes, and fly-flaps, when there's occasion, to be sure:—but no extravagance.</P>

<P>Extravagance!—Lord help you, Mr. Waldron! We only wont to keep pace a bit with our neigh∣bours. Look at 'em in the winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Winter! and how are we to keep pace with them there, you ninny hammer? They are too magnificent for us. They have a stud of Ele∣phants at one house, and a stable full of Bulls at the other. We are too humble to vie with our neighbours in giving the publick any thing to see.</P>

<P>He was one of the comicalest fellows I ever see!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and one of the honestest, master Carpen∣ter. When an individual has combined private worth with publick talent, he quits the bustling scene of life with two-fold applause, and we doubly deplore his exit.—But come, we have still, some favourites among our Hundred, who are ambi∣tious to please; and whose continued exertions, we doubt not, will be honoured with the continued patronage of our benefactors.—Is there any thing more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARPENTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes:—New ropes for all the drop scenes.— There's great difficulty, at present, in drawing up the curtain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true enough;—for it ought to have been drawn up a month ago. Well, obviate the diffi∣culty as soon as you can, and send in that <HI>item</HI> of your bill to the Winter Managers.</P>

<SPEAKER>APEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, if I am, Sir; however my waggery may be taken, I mean it to be perfectly harmless. There is no man without his peculiar manner— and, in studying the tones of others, I hope to

improve my own, without giving offence to much better Actors than myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROMPTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's handsomely said, however. Give me your hand:—you seem to have some fun and spi∣rit about you; and we may be better acquainted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>APEWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we shall. Who knows, if I become one of the Company, but we may have a bowl of punch together, at the Blue Posts:—or take a whet in a walk over the fields to Bagnigge.— "Fetch a walk this fine evening, Miss Dolly?— Eh, Miss Dolly?"</P>

<P>You seem pretty conversant in the drama. Have you studied much?</P>
