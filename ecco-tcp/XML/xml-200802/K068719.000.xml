Having put up my horse, my next care is to see after my master, Signor Lelio; who, I dare say, expects me with impatience. 'Twas here I left him—but here he comes!</P>

<P>Ah, Carlo! I am glad thou art re∣turned.</P>

<P>I don't doubt it, Sir; for you must have been in a thousand frights and fears. But the portrait is found, Sir; 'tis found, and all our cares are over.</P>

<P>There; devour it with kisses.— <STAGE>[Seeing Lelio put the portrait in his pocket without regard∣ing it]</STAGE> Hey-day! how you receive it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a thing become perfectly indifferent to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil!—why, whence comes this change? when Signor Ascorino, your father, gave it you at Naples, zounds, there was no keeping you within bounds; you had your best bib and tucker on in a minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The character he had given you of Isabella, and the sight of her picture, had so sired you, you must set out to Leghorn to see her that very moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed; for away we decamped immediately from Naples, and came post-haste here. On our arrival, you perceived you had left the portrait of Isabella at our inn at Rome; so not daring to appear before her without it, away I was dispatched, as if the devil was in me,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
to fetch it: I have brought it back to you, and now you put it in your pocket without looking at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree to this: I will even tell thee, that, impatient to see her, so far from having the resolution to wait thy return, the very day after thy departure I set out to her house, though I had not the portrait.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess what followed: The painter was remarkable for taking handsome likenesses, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I have not seen her. On my way, I met with a person who took away all my in∣clination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>A person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; a very respectable person; a young Gipsy, who offered to tell me my fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I understand you: She looked at your line of life, and found there certain crosses, something in the shape of horns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Carlo; 'twas in looking in my face she did the business, not in my hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>That my heart was stolen by the charms of this beautiful Gipsy, who appeared to be a divinity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, some pilgrim, I suppose, who knows very well how to sell her cockleshells.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art deceived; she has not less wisdom than beauty: Imagine to thyself all the attractions, all the graces together, this is Spinetta. She receives your praises with an honest disdain; and, if you are too free, she opposes to your vi∣vacity an agreeable severity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's as much as to say, she holds the sugar-plumb as high as she can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, why is not her birth equal to her merit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, Signor Lelio! push the matter further; be a perfect hero in this business, and persuade yourself she is some princess in disguise, whose misfortunes have reduced her royal highness to stroll about the country to tell fortunes, and steal pigs and chickens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truce to pleasantry.—I confess, it agrees but little with my birth to have a passion so de∣licate for a Gipsy; but I am so entirely conquerred, that, let what will be the consequence, I can think of nothing but her, and the means of pleas∣ing her.</P>

<P>Lord, madam, how the wind is changed in our corner. When Signor Ascorino proposed his son to you—oh, dear—nothing was ever so charming as the idea of such an alliance—pomp, place, and precedence, at the court of Naples, was such a temptation—away I was sent for the
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
most famous painter in all Leghorn to draw your portrait; for though you had three by you, one was too serious, another too ill-dressed, the third too masculine; in short, every nerve must be strained to attract the heart of so wealthy and accomplished a cavalier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isab.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is true.</P>

<SPEAKER>Viol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now see the difference: He ought to have been here eight days ago; and though 'tis possible he may have broke his neck upon the road, been assassinated by robbers, though it is the most astonishing thing in the world we have not seen him, when I tell you he is not arrived, you cry—"heaven be praised!"</P>

<P>Nay, what signifies mincing the matter?—Your coach breaks down; you are in danger of losing your life, by falling near the horses, when a man, all over rags and tatters, flies to your assistance—he relieves you—insists upon conducting you home—and because he refuses a purse of ducats, which you offer him, you are convinced he has a noble mind, an elevated un∣derstanding, and a great many more fine things which I have forgot.</P>

<P>You shall hear, Sir.—Lelio arriving at this town, met with Clarin my brother, who he knew at Naples; said Lelio to his friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have an excellent thought! my cousin has never seen me, and I could wish to know whether my person would make any impression on her without my appearing in my own form▪ Suppose therefore you take my name, and go instead of me. In the mean time, we'll all disguise ourselves; your sister, your servants,
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
Carlo, and I, as Gipsies; so go to Isabella under pretence of telling her fortune, and at a proper time make myself known."</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asco.</SPEAKER>
<P>What extravagance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Sir, we bespoke these dresses immediately, and have been 'till this day getting perfect in our little farce. But, Sir, we can't go a step further without you lend us your assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asco.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, with all my heart: What must I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll embrace your niece, with whom you'll find my brother Clarin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asco.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you will also embrace him, as if he was your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asco.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Support this feint 'till the evening, and leave the rest to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asco.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be discreet, never fear.—I can't help laughing to think, how Isabella will be sur∣prized when she comes to know the truth.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Ex.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, and so will you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Spinetta, what's your design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is it: We shall in the beginning of the evening have a bark ready; and while I find some means of keeping the Marquis out of the way, my brother shall draw aside Isabella, under pretence of taking a walk to the sea-shore; we shall then force her aboard, and set sail in a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>Carry off my cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, what you are at your objections again.—If you say another word, I'll carry off your father.</P>

<P>The devil you will! Ay, and all the rest of the family, I suppose.—But who have we here?</P>

<P>Here they are.</P>

<P>Who do you want, Sir?</P>

<P>You.—The governor, who is at the door, sent me to see if you were here.</P>

<P>Heavens! we are discovered!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lelio.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, Spinetta?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Something perhaps on which my life depends; but the subject of my fears will not bring a blush upon the cheek of Lelio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The governor? we shall finish our farce in a prison.</P>

<P>Why that demand, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have an order from the grand-duke to pass you into Sicily, where you are expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clarin.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, it is to me you ought to address yourself: I am Alphonso, that unfor∣tunate prince for whom you seek. I vainly be∣lieved, by my flight and my disguise, to save my life from the cruelty of the King of Sicily; he is not content to have executed my father for his attachment to Manfroy, he demands my life; and you may take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I am not come with any such disagreeable news, the king is dead, and the son of Manfroy is placed on the throne. The new king, who loves you, knowing you were flown with the princess Matilda your sister, having made search for you every where, at last discover'd
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
that you were both at Leghorn, with your faith∣ful domestics, disguised as Gipsies; in conse∣quence of which, he has written to the grand-duke, from whom I have an order to offer you on his part all that may be necessary to convey you to Palermo.</P>

<P>Now for me: And will the amiable Laura, first lady of honour to the princess Ma∣tilda, deign to cast a twinkle of affection upon the love-stricken Carlo, as lord of the bedchamber?</P>
