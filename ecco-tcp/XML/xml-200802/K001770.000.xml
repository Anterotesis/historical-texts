PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE two Essays on <HI>Suicide</HI> and <HI>the Im∣mortality of the Soul,</HI> though not publish∣ed in any edition of his works, are generally attributed to the late ingenious Mr. Hume.</P>
<P>The well-known contempt of this eminent philosopher for the common convictions of mankind, raised an apprehension of the con∣tents from the very title of these pieces. But the celebrity of the author's name, renders them, notwithstanding, in some degree objects of great curiosity.</P>
<P>Owing to this circumstance, a few copies have been clandestinely circulated, at a large price, for some time, but without any com∣ment. The very mystery attending this mode of selling them, made them more an ob∣ject of request than they would otherwise have been.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
The present publication comes abroad un∣der no such restraint, and possesses very supe∣rior advantages. The <HI>Notes</HI> annexed are in∣tended to expose the sophistry contained in the original Essays, and may shew how little we have to fear from the adversaries of these great truths, from the pitiful figure which e∣ven Mr. Hume makes in thus violently exhaust∣ing his last strength in an abortive attempt to traduce or discredit them.</P>
<P>The two very masterly Letters from the E∣loisa of Rosseau on the subject of <HI>Suicide,</HI> have been much celebrated, and we hope will be considered as materially increasing the value of this curious collection.</P>
<P>The admirers of <HI>Mr. Hume</HI> will be pleased with seeing the remains of a favourite author rescued in this manner from that oblivion to which the prejudices of his countrymen had, in all appearance, consigned them; and even the religious part of mankind have some reason of triumph from the striking instance here gi∣ven of truth's superiority to error, even when error has all the advantage of an elegant ge∣nius, and a great literary reputation to recom∣mend it.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I. ON <HI>SUICIDE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE considerable advantage that arises from Philosophy, consists in the sovereign antidote which it affords to superstition and false religion. All other remedies against that pestilent distemper are vain, or at least uncertain. Plain good sense and the prac∣tice of the world, which alone serve most purposes of life, are here found ineffectu∣al: History as well as daily experience fur∣nish instances of men endowed with the
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
strongest capacity for business and affairs, who have all their lives crouched under sla∣very to the grossest superstition. Even gai∣ety and sweetness of temper, which infuse a balm into every other wound, afford no remedy to so virulent a poison; as we may particularly observe of the fair sex, who tho' commonly possest of these rich presents of nature, feel many of their joys blasted by this importunate intruder. But when sound Philosophy has once gained possession of the mind, superstition is effectually excluded, and one may fairly affirm that her triumph over this enemy is more complete than over most of the vices and imperfections incident to human nature. Love or anger, ambition or avarice, have their root in the temper and affections, which the soundest reason is scarce ever able fully to correct, but superstition being founded on false opinion, must immediately vanish when true philoso∣phy has inspired juster sentiments of supe∣rior powers. The contest is here more e∣qual between the distemper and the medi∣cine,
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
and nothing can hinder the latter from proving effectual but its being false and so∣phisticated.</P>
<P>IT will here be superfluous to magnify the merits of Philosophy by displaying the pernicious tendency of that vice of which it cures the human mind. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.1">(1)</REF> The super∣stitious man says Tully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Divin. lib. ii.</BIBL></NOTE> is miserable in every scene, in every incident in life; even sleep itself, which banishes all other cares of unhappy mortals, affords to him matter of new terror; while he examines his dreams, and finds in those visions of the night prog∣nostications of future calamities. I may add that tho' death alone can put a full period to his misery, he dares not fly to this refuge, but still prolongs a miserable existence from a vain fear lest he offend his Maker, by u∣sing the power, with which that beneficent being has endowed him. The presents of God and nature are ravished from us by this
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
cruel enemy, and notwithstanding that one step would remove us from the regions of pain and sorrow, her menaces still chain us down to a hated being which she herself chiefly contributes to render miserable.</P>
<P>'TIS observed by such as have been re∣duced by the calamities of life to the neces∣sity of employing this fatal remedy, that if the unseasonable care of their friends de∣prive them of that species of Death which they proposed to themselves, they seldom venture upon any other, or can summon up so much resolution a second time as to exe∣cute their purpose. So great is our horror of death, that when it presents itself under any form, besides that to which a man has endeavoured to reconcile his imagination, it acquires new terrors and overcomes his feeble courage: But when the menaces of superstition are joined to this natural timidity, no wonder it quite deprives men of all power over their lives, since even many pleasures and enjoyments,
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
to which we are carried by a strong propen∣sity, are torn from us by this inhuman ty∣rant. Let us here endeavour to restore men to their native liberty, by examining all the common arguments against Suicide, and shewing that that action may be free from every imputation of guilt or blame, accord∣ing to the sentiments of all the antient phi∣losophers. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.2">(2)</REF></P>
<P>IF Suicide be criminal, it must be a transgression of our duty either to God, our neighbour, or ourselves.—To prove that suicide is no transgression of our duty to God, the following considerations may perhaps suffice. In order to govern the material world, the almighty Creator has established general and immutable laws, by which all bodies, from the greatest planet to the smallest particle of matter, are maintained in their proper sphere and func∣tion. To govern the animal world, he has endowed all living creatures with bodi∣ly and mental powers; with senses, pas∣sions,
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
appetites, memory, and judgment, by which they are impelled or regulated in that course of life to which they are des∣tined. These two distinct principles of the material and animal world, continually encroach upon each other, and mutually re∣tard or forward each others operation. The powers of men and of all other animals are restrained and directed by the nature and qualities of the surrounding bodies, and the modifications and actions of these bo∣dies are incessantly altered by the operation of all animals. Man is stopt by rivers in his passage over the surface of the earth; and rivers, when properly directed, lend their force to the motion of machines, which serve to the use of man. But tho' the provinces of the material and animal powers are not kept entirely seperate, there results from thence no discord or disorder in the creation; on the contrary, from the mixture, union, and contrast of all the va∣rious powers of inanimate bodies and liv∣ing creatures, arises that sympathy, har∣mony,
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
and proportion, which affords the surest argument of supreme wisdom. The providence of the Deity appears not imme∣diately in any operation, but governs every thing by those general and immutable laws, which have been established from the beginning of time. All events, in one sense, may be pronounced the action of the Almighty, they all proceed from those powers with which he has endowed his creatures. A house which falls by its own weight, is not brought to ruin by his providence, more than one destroyed by the hands of men; nor are the human fa∣culties less his workmanship, than the laws of motion and gravitation. When the passions play, when the judgment dictates, when the limbs obey; this is all the opera∣tion of God, and upon these animate prin∣ciples, as well as upon the inanimate, has he established the goverment of the universe. Every event is alike important in the eyes of that infinite being, who takes in at one glance the most distant regions of space, and
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
remotest periods of time. There is no e∣vent, however important to us, which he has exempted from the general laws that govern the universe, or which he has pecu∣liarly reserved for his own immediate ac∣tion and operation. The revolution of states and empires depends upon the smallest ca∣price or passion of single men; and the lives of men are shortened or extended by the smallest accident of air or diet, sun∣shine or tempest. Nature still conti∣nues her progress and operation; and if general laws be ever broke by par∣ticular volitions of the Deity, 'tis after a manner which entirely escapes human ob∣servation. As on the one hand, the ele∣ments and other inanimate parts of the cre∣ation carry on their action without regard to the particular interest and situation of men; so men are entrusted to their own judgment and discretion in the various shocks of matter, and may employ every fa∣culty with which they are endowed, in or∣der to provide for their ease, happiness, or
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
preservation. What is the meaning then of that principle, that a man who tired of life, and hunted by pain and misery, brave∣ly overcomes all the natural terrors of death, and makes his escape from this cru∣el scene: that such a man I say, has incur∣red the indignation of his Creator by en∣croaching on the office of divine providence, and disturbing the order of the universe? shall we assert that the Almighty has reser∣ved to himself in any peculiar manner the disposal of the lives of men, and has not submitted that event, in common with others, to the general laws by which the universe is governed? This is plainly salse; the lives of men depend upon the same laws as the lives of all other animals; and these are subjected to the general laws of matter and motion. The fall of a tower, or the infusion of a poison, will destroy a man equally with the meanest creature; an in∣undation sweeps away every thing with∣out distinction that comes within the reach of its fury. Since therefore the lives of men
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
are for ever dependant on the general laws of matter and motion, is a man's disposing of his life criminal, because in every case it is criminal to encroach upon these laws, or disturb their operation? But this seems absurd; all animals are entrusted to their own prudence and skill for their conduct in the world, and have full authority as far as their power extends, to alter all the operati∣ons of nature. Without the excercise of this authority they could not subsist a moment; every action, every motion of a man, inno∣vates on the order of some parts of matter, and diverts from their ordinary course the general laws of motion. Putting toge∣ther, therefore, these conclusions, we find that human life depends upon the general laws of matter and motion, and that it is no encroachment on the office of provi∣dence to disturb or alter these general laws: Has not every one, of consequence, the free disposal of his own life? And may he not lawfully employ that power with which nature has endowed him? In order
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
to destroy the evidence of this conclusion, we must shew a reason why this particular case is excepted; is it because human life is of such great importance, that 'tis a pre∣sumption for human prudence to dispose of it? But the life of a man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster. And were it of ever so great im∣portance, the order of human nature has actually submitted it to human prudence, and reduced us to a necessity, in every in∣cident, of determining concerning it.—Were the disposal of human life so much reserved as the peculiar province of the Almighty, that it were an encroachment on his right, for men to dispose of their own lives; it would be equally criminal to act for the preservation of life as for its destruc∣tion. If I turn aside a stone which is fal∣ling upon my head, I disturb the course of nature, and I invade the peculiar province of the Almighty, by lengthening out my life beyond the period which by the gene∣ral laws of matter and motion he had assign∣ed it. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.3">(3)</REF></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16"/>
A hair, a fly, an insect is able to destroy this mighty being whose life is of such im∣portance. Is it an absurdity to suppose that human prudence may lawfully dispose of what depends on such insignificant causes? It would be no crime in me to di∣vert the <HI>Nile</HI> or <HI>Danube</HI> from its course, were I able to effect such purposes. Where then is the crime of turning a few ounces of blood from their natural channel?—Do you imagine that I repine at Providence or curse my creation, because I go out of life, and put a period to a being, which, were it to continue, would render me mise∣rable? Far be such sentiments from me; I am only convinced of a matter of fact, which you yourself acknowledge possible, that human life may be unhappy; and that my existence, if further prolonged, would become ineligible; but I thank Provi∣dence, both for the good which I have al∣ready enjoyed, and for the power with which I am endowed of escaping the ill that
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
threatens me.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Agamus Dei gratias, quad nemo in vita teneri potest.</Q> <BIBL>SEN. Epist. 12.</BIBL></NOTE> To you it belongs to repine at providence, who foolishly imagine that you have no such power, and who must still prolong a hated life, tho' loaded with pain and sickness, with shame and poverty—Do not you teach, that when any ill befals me, tho' by the malice of my enemies, I ought to be resigned to providence, and that the actions of men are the operations of the Almighty as much as the actions of inanimate beings? When I fall upon my own sword, therefore, I receive my death equally from the hands of the Deity as if it had proceeded from a lion, a precipice, or a fever. The submission which you re∣quire to providence, in every calamity that befals me, excludes not human skill and in∣dustry, if possible by their means I can a∣void or escape the calamity: And why may I not employ one remedy as well as another?—If my life be not my own, it were criminal for me to put it in danger, as
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
well as to dispose of it; nor could one man deserve the appellation of <HI>hero,</HI> whom glory or friendship transports into the great∣est dangers, and another merit the reproach of <HI>wretch</HI> or <HI>miscreant</HI> who puts a period to his life, from the same or like motives.—There is no being, which possesses any power or faculty, that it receives not from its Creator, nor is there any one, which by ever so irregular an action can encroach upon the plan of his providence, or disor∣der the universe. Its operations are his works equally with that chain of events which it invades, and which ever principle prevails, we may for that very reason con∣clude it to be most favoured by him. Be it animate, or inanimate, rational, or irra∣tional, 'tis all a case: its power is still de∣rived from the supreme Creator, and is a∣like comprehended in the order of his pro∣vidence. When the horror of pain pre∣vails over the love of life; when a volun∣tary action anticipates the effects of blind causes, 'tis only in consequence of those
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
powers and principles which he has im∣planted in his creatures. Divine provi∣dence is still inviolate, and placed far be∣yond the reach of human injuries. 'Tis impious says the old Roman superstition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>TACIT. Ann. lib. i.</BIBL></NOTE> to divert rivers from their course, or invade the prerogatives of nature: 'Tis im∣pious says the French superstition to ino∣culate for the small-pox, or usurp the busi∣ness of providence by voluntarily produc∣ing distempers and maladies. 'Tis im∣pious says the modern <HI>European</HI> supersti∣tion, to put a period to our own life, and thereby rebel against our Creator; and why not impious, say I, to build houses, culti∣vate the ground, or sail upon the ocean? In all these actions we employ our powers of mind and body, to produce some innova∣tion in the course of nature; and in none of them do we any more. They are all of them therefore equally innocent, or equal∣ly criminal. <HI>But you are placed by provi∣dence, like a centinal, in a particular station,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
<HI>and when you desert it without being re∣called, you are equally guilty of rebellion against your almighty sovereign, and have incurred his displeasure.</HI>—I ask, why do you conclude that providence has placed me in this station? for my part I find that I owe my birth to a long chain of causes, of which many depended upon voluntary actions of men. <HI>But providence guided all these causes, and nothing hap∣pens in the universe without its consent and co-operation.</HI> If so, then neither does my death, however voluntary, happen without its consent; and whenever pain or sorrow so far overcome my patience, as to make me tired of life, I may conclude that I am recalled from my station in the clearest and most express terms. 'Tis providence surely that has placed me at this present in this chamber: But may I not leave it when I think pro∣per, without being liable to the imputation of having deserted my post or station? When I shall be dead, the principles of
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
which I am composed will still perform their part in the universe, and will be equally useful in the grand fabrick, as when they composed this individual creature. The difference to the whole will be no greater than betwixt my being in a chamber and in the open air. The one change is of more importance to me than the other; but not more so to the universe.</P>
<P>—'TIS a kind of blasphemy to imagine that any created being can disturb the or∣der of the world, or invade the business of Providence! it supposes, that that being possesses powers and faculties, which it received not from its creator, and which are not subordinate to his government and authority. A man may disturb society no doubt, and thereby incur the displea∣sure of the Almighty: But the government of the world is placed far beyond his reach and violence. And how does it appear that the Almighty is displeased with those actions that disturb society? By the prin∣ciples
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
which he has implanted in human nature, and which inspire us with a sen∣timent of remorse if we ourselves have been guilty of such actions, and with that of blame and disapprobation, if we ever ob∣serve them in others:—Let us now exa∣mine, according to the method proposed, whether Suicide be of this kind of actions, and be a breach of our duty to our <HI>neigh∣bour</HI> and to <HI>society.</HI></P>
<P>A MAN who retires from life does no harm to society: He only ceases to do good; which, if it is an injury, is of the lowest kind.—All our obligations to do good to society seem to imply something reciprocal. I receive the benefits of soci∣ety, and therefore ought to promote its in∣terests; but when I withdraw myself altoge∣ther from society, can I be bound any lon∣ger? But allowing that our obligations to do good were perpetual, they have certainly some bounds; I am not obliged to do a small good to society at the expence of a
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
great harm to myself; why then should I prolong a miserable existence, because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me? If upon ac∣count of age and infirmities, I may lawful∣ly resign any office, and employ my time al∣together in fencing against these calamities, and alleviating, as much as possible, the miseries of my future life: why may I not cut short these miseries at once by an action which is no more prejudicial to society?—But suppose that it is no lon∣ger in my power to promote the interest of society, suppose that I am a burden to it, suppose that my life hinders some person from being much more useful to society. In such cases, my resignation of life must not only be innocent, but laudable. And most people who lie under any temptation to abandon existence, are in some such si∣tuation; those who have health, or pow∣er, or authority, have commonly better reason to be in humour with the world. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.4">(4)</REF></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="24"/>
A MAN is engaged in a conspiracy for the public interest; is seized upon suspi∣cion; is threatened with the rack; and knows from his own weakness that the se∣cret will be extorted from him: Could such a one consult the public interest bet∣ter than by putting a quick period to a miserable life? This was the case of the famous and brave <HI>Strozi</HI> of <HI>Florence.</HI>—Again, suppose a malefactor is justly con∣demned to a shameful death, can any rea∣son be imagined, why he may not antici∣pate his punishment, and save himself all the anguish of thinking on its dreadful ap∣proaches? He invades the business of pro∣vidence no more than the magistrate did, who ordered his execution; and his vo∣luntary death is equally advantageous to so∣ciety, by ridding it of a pernicious mem∣ber.</P>
<P>THAT Suicide may often be consistent with interest and with our duty to ourselves, no one can question, who allows that age,
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
sickness, or misfortune, may render life a burthen, and make it worse even than an∣nihilation. I believe that no man ever threw away life, while it was worth keeping. For such is our natural horror of death, that small motives will never be able to reconcile us to it; and though perhaps the situation of a man's health or fortune did not seem to require this remedy, we may at least be assured that any one who, without apparent reason, has had recourse to it, was curst with such an incurable depravity or gloominess of temper as must poison all en∣joyment, and render him equally misera∣ble as if he had been loaded with the most grievous misfortunes.—If suicide be suppo∣sed a crime, 'tis only cowardice can impel us to it. If it be no crime, both prudence and courage should engage us to rid our∣selves at once of existence, when it becomes a burthen. 'Tis the only way that we can then be useful to society, by setting an ex∣ample, which if imitated, would preserve to every one his chance for happiness in life,
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
and would effectually free him from all danger of misery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IT would be easy to prove that suicide is as lawful un∣der the Christian dispensation as it was to the Heathens. There is not a single text of scripture which prohibits it. That great and infallible rule of faith and practice which must controul all philosophy and human reasoning, has left us in this particular to our natural liberty. Resignation to Providence is indeed recommended in scripture; but that implies only submission to ills that are unavoidable, not to such as may be remedied by prudence or courage. <HI>Thou shalt not kill,</HI> is evidently meant to exclude only the killing of others, over whose life we have no authority. That this pre∣cept, like most of the scripture precepts, must be modified by reason and common sense, is plain from the practice of magi∣strates, who punish criminals capitally, notwithstanding the letter of the law. But were this commandment ever so express against suicide, it would now have no authority, for all the law of <HI>Moses</HI> is abolished, except so far as it is established by the law of nature. And we have already endeavoured to prove that suicide is not prohibited by that law. In all cases Christians and Heathens are precisely upon the same foot∣ing; <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Brutus, Arrea</HI> and <HI>Portia</HI> acted herocially; those who now imitate their example ought to receive the same praises from posterity. The power of committing suicide is regarded by <HI>Pliny</HI> as an advantage which men possess even above the Deity himself. <Q REND="inline">"Deus non sibi po∣test mortem consciscere si velit quod homini dedit optimum in tantis vitae paenis."</Q> <BIBL>Lib.

<HEAD>ESSAY II. ON THE <HI>IMMORTALITY</HI> OF THE <HI>SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the <HI>Soul;</HI> the arguments for it are commonly derived either from <HI>metaphysical</HI> topics, or <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>physical.</HI> But in reality 'tis the Gospel and the Gospel alone, that has brought <HI>life and immortality to light.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. METAPHYSICAL topics suppose that the soul is immaterial, and that 'tis im∣possible
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
for thought to belong to a material substance.—<REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE2.1">(1)</REF> But just metaphysics teach us that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imper∣fect, and that we have no other idea of any substance, than as an aggregate of parti∣cular qualities, inhering in an unknown something. Matter, therefore, and spirit, are at bottom equally unknown, and we cannot determine what qualities inhere in the one or in the other. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE2.2">(2)</REF> They like∣wise teach us that nothing can be decided <HI>a priori</HI> concerning any cause or effect, and that experience being the only source of our judgments of this nature, we cannot know from any other principle, whether matter, by its structure or arrangement, may not be the cause of thought. Abstract rea∣sonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence.—But admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the u∣niverse, like the etherial fire of the <HI>Stoics,</HI> and to be the only inherent subject of thought, we have reason to conclude
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
from <HI>analogy</HI> that nature uses it after the manner she does the other substance, <HI>mat∣ter.</HI> She employs it as a kind of paste or clay; modifies it into a variety of forms and existences; dissolves after a time each modification, and from its substance erects a new form. As the same material sub∣stance may successively compose the bodies of all animals, the same spiritual sub∣stance may compose their minds: Their consciousness, or that system of thought which they formed during life, may be con∣tinually dissolved by death. And nothing interests them in the new modification. The most positive assertors of the mortality of the soul, never denied the immortality of its sustance. And that an immaterial substance, as well as a material, may lose its memory or consciousness, appears in part from experience, if the soul be immateri∣al.—Reasoning from the common course of nature, and without supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause, which ought always to be excluded from philoso∣phy,
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
what is incorruptible must also be in∣generable. The Soul therefore if immor∣tal, existed before our birth; and if the former existence no ways concerned us, neither will the latter.—Animals undoubt∣edly feel, think, love, hate, will, and even reason, tho' in a more imperfect manner than men; are their souls also immaterial and immortal? <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE2.3">(3)</REF></P>
<P N="2">II. LET us now consider the moral argu∣ments, chiefly those derived from the jus∣tice of God, which is supposed to be farther interested in the farther punishment of the vicious and reward of the virtuous.—But these arguments are grounded on the sup∣position that God has attributes beyond what he has exerted in this universe, with which alone we are acquainted. Whence do we infer the existence of these at∣tributes?—'Tis very safe for us to af∣firm, that whatever we know the Deity to have actually done, is best; but 'tis very dangerous to affirm, that he must always do
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
what to us seems best. In how many in∣stances would this reasoning fail us with regard to the present world?—But if any purpose of nature be clear, we may affirm, that the whole scope and intention of man's creation, so far as we can judge by natural reason, is limited to the present life. With how weak a concern from the original in∣herent structure of the mind and passions, does he ever look farther? What compa∣rison either for steadiness or efficacy, be∣twixt so floating an idea, and the most doubt∣ful persuasion of any matter of fact that oc∣curs in common life. There arise indeed in some minds some unaccountable terrors with regard to futurity; but these would quickly vanish were they not artificially sostered by precept and education. And those who foster them, what is their motive? Only to gain a livelihood, and to acquire power and riches in this world. Their ve∣ry zeal and industry therefore is an argu∣gument against them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="32"/>
WHAT cruelty, what iniquity, what in∣justice in nature, to confine all our concern, as well as all our knowledge, to the present life, if there be another scene still waiting us, of infinitely greater consequence? Ought this barbarous deceit to be ascribed to a beneficent and wise being?—Ob∣serve with what exact proportion the task to be performed and the performing pow∣ers are adjusted throughout all nature. If the reason of man gives him great superio∣rity above other animals, his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him; his whole time, his whole capacity, activity, courage, and passion, find suffici∣ent employment in fencing against the mi∣series of his present condition, and fre∣quently, nay almost always are too slender for the business assigned them.—A pair of shoes perhaps was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection which that co∣modity is capable of attaining. Yet it is necessary, at least very useful, that there should be some politicians and moralists,
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
even some geometers, poets, and philoso∣phers among mankind. The powers of men are no more superior to their wants, considered merely in this life, than those of foxes and hares are, compared to <HI>their</HI> wants and to their period of existence. The inference from parity of reason is therefore obvious.—</P>
<P>ON the theory of the Soul's mortality, the inferiority of women's capacity is easily ac∣counted for. Their domestic life requires no higher faculties, either of mind or body.

HEAVEN and Hell suppose two distinct species of men, the good and the bad; but the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue.—Were one to go round the world with an intention of giving a good supper to the righteous, and a sound drubbing to the wicked, he would frequent∣ly be embarrassed in his choice, and would find that the merits and the demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to the va∣lue of either.—To suppose measures of ap∣probation and blame different from the hu∣man confounds every thing. Whence do we learn that there is such a thing as moral dis∣tinctions, but from our own sentiments?—What man who has not met with perso∣nal provacation (or what good-natured man who has) could inflict on crimes, from the sense of blame alone, even the common, le∣gal, frivolous punishments?

<P N="3">III. THE <HI>Physical</HI> arguments from the a∣nalogy of nature are strong for the morta∣lity of the soul, and are really the only phi∣losophical arguments which ought to be ad∣mitted with regard to this question, or in∣deed any question of fact.—Where any two objects are so closely connected that all al∣terations which we have ever seen in the one, are attended with proportionable alter∣ations in the other; we ought to conclude
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
by all rules of analogy, that, when there are still greater alterations produced in the former, and it is totally dissolved, there fol∣lows a total dissolution of the latter.—Sleep, a very small effect on the body, is attended with a temporary extinction, at least a great confusion in the soul.—The weakness of the body and that of the mind in infan∣cy are exactly proportioned, their vigour in manhood, their sympathetic disorder in sickness; their common gradual decay in old age. The step further seems unavoidable; their common dissolution in death. The last symptoms which the mind discovers are disorder, weakness, insensibility, and stupi∣dity, the fore-runners of its annihilation. The farther progress of the same causes en∣creasing, the same effects totally extinguish it. Judging by the usual analogy of na∣ture, no form can continue when transfer∣red to a condition of life very different from the original one, in which it was pla∣ced. Trees perish in the water, fishes in the air, animals in the earth. Even so small a difference as that of climate is of∣ten
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
fatal. What reason then to imagine, that an immense alteration, such as is made on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of thought and sensation, can be effected without the dissolution of the whole? Every thing is in common be∣twixt soul and body. The organs of the one are all of them the organs of the other. The existence therefore of the one must be dependant on that of the other.—The souls of animals are allowed to be mortal; and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men, that the analogy from one to the other forms a very strong argument. Their bodies are not more resembling; yet no one rejects the argument drawn from compara∣tive anatomy. The <HI>Metempsychosis</HI> is there∣fore the only system of this kind that philo∣sophy can hearken to. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE2.4">(4)</REF></P>
<P>NOTHING in this world is perpetual, every thing however seemingly firm is in conti∣nual flux and change, the world itself gives symptoms of frailty and dissolution. How contrary to analogy, therefore, to imagine

that one single form, seemingly the frailest of any, and subject to the greatest disorders, is immortal and indissoluble? <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE2.5">(5)</REF> What da∣ring theory is that! how lightly, not to say how rashly entertained!

For these then a new universe must every generation be created beyond the bounds of the present u∣niverse, or one must have been created at first so prodigiously wise as to admit of this continual influx of beings. (6) Ought such bold suppositions to be received by a∣ny philosophy, and that merely on the pre∣text of a bare possibility? When it is asked whether <HI>Agamemnon, Thersites Hannibal, Varro,</HI> and every stupid clown that ever existed in <HI>Italy, Seythia, Bactria</HI> or <HI>Guinea,</HI> are now alive; can any man think, that a scrutiny of nature will furnish arguments

For as nature does nothing in vain, she would never give us a horror against an impossible event. She may give us a horror against an una∣voidable event, provided our endeavours, as in the present case, may often remove it to some distance. Death is in the end un∣avoidable; yet the human species could not be preserved had not nature inspired us with an aversion towards it. All doctrines are to be suspected which are favoured by

our passions, and the hopes and fears which gave rise to this doctrine are very obvi∣ous.</P>

<HEAD>ANTI SUICIDE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 ID="CN002705-NOTE1.1" N="1" TYPE="note">
<P>(1) THIS elaborate eulogium on philosophy points obliquely at religion, which we chris∣tians consider as the only sovereign antidote to every disease incident to the mind of man. It is indeed hard to say what reason might do were it freed from all restraints, especially if a succession of philosophers were incessantly improving on one another as they went on, avoiding and correcting the mistakes of those who preceded them in the same pursuit, till at last one complete and rational system was ef∣fected. Great things might probably be ac∣complished in this manner. But no such plan in fact ever was or is likely to be finish∣ed. Neither priestcraft, nor magisterial pow∣ers, however, cramped the progres of impro∣ving reason, or baffled the genius of en∣quiring man. The principles of religion and virtue were freely canvassed by the boldest spirits of antiquity. In truth, the superior ad∣vantage and necessity of the christian religi∣on seems manifest from this particular circum∣stance,
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
that it has taken away every possible restraint from natural religion, allowing it to exert itself to the utmost in sinding out the fundamental truths of virtue, and in ac∣quiescing in them, in openly avowing and ac∣knowledging them when revealed, in exten∣ding the views and expectations of men, in giving them more just and liberal sentiments, and in publickly and uniformly disclaim∣ing any intention of establishing a kingdom for its votaries or believers in this world.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of the gospel are not inten∣ded to instruct us in the knowledge of every thing which may be really useful in the pre∣sent life, far less of every thing, which, from curiosity alone, we may have a mighty desire to know. Revelation considers mankind in their highest capacity, as the rational and accountable subjects of God, and as capable both of present and future happiness or misery, according to their behaviour. Its chief, if not its sole design, is to give us those views and im∣pressions of our nature, of our state, of the perfections, the counsels, the laws, and the government of God, which, under the influence of providence, are the immediate and infallible means of the purity, of the comfort, and of the moral order, rectitude, and excellence of our immortal souls. As corrupted and dis∣ordered, we are incapable of true happiness, till purified and restored to order. As guilty and
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
mortal creatures, we can have no true con∣solation without the hopes of pardon in a fu∣ture and seperate state of existence. As sur∣rounded with dangers, and obnoxious to e∣very dismal apprehension, we can posses no solid, or permanent content, but in the sin∣cere and well grounded convictions of that gracious and righteous administration so mi∣nutely and explicity delineated in the scrip∣tures. It is evident, therefore, that the prin∣cipal excellence and utility of revealed truths must lie or consist in the influence they have upon the sanctification and consolation of our hearts. They tally exactly with the pre∣sent circumstances of mankind, and are ad∣mirably adapted to cure every disease, every disorder of the human mind, to beget, to che∣rish, and confirm every pure, every virtu∣ous, every pious disposition.</P>
<P>MANKIND are certainly at present in a state of the deepest corruption and depra∣vity, and at the same time apt to continue strangely insensible of the misery and dan∣ger to which, under the government of in∣finite wisdom, it necessarily renders them. Nothing can be conceived more fit to rouse them from their lethargy, and to awaken them to a just sense of their condition, than a messenger from Heaven, clothed with di∣vine authority, setting before them the in∣trinsic
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
baseness, malignity, and wretched∣ness of vice, together with the certain, the dreadful, the eternal consequences of con∣tinuing in it.</P>
<P>COULD we enter upon a particular view of all those maladies and disorders which in∣fest and destroy the souls of men, it were ea∣sy to shew, that a steadfast belief of religion is, in truth, the most natural and the best an∣tidote or remedy for each of them. It is ob∣vious, at least, that the clear and full mani∣festation, which the gospel has given of the character of God, and the laws of his moral government, and of the terms of salvation through faith in the religion of his son, are all finely calculated to root out the princi∣ples of superstition, and all false notions, de∣structive to the virtue and happiness of man∣kind, and to plant in their room whatever has a natural and direct tendency to promote our virtue, our perfection, our felicity. <LABEL>M.</LABEL></P>

lawful for one, may be lawful for all, and no society can subsist in the conviction of a principle thus hostile to its being.</P>
<P>IT seems to be a maxim in human existence, that no creature has a right to decide peremp∣torily on the importance, utility, or necessi∣ty of his own being. There are an infinite variety of secret connections and associations in the vast system of things, which the eye of created wisdom cannot explore.</P>
<P>MAN is not, perhaps, so ignorant of anything, or any creature, as of himself. His own sys∣tem, after all the art and inquisition of human ingenuity, is still to him the profoundest mys∣tery in nature. His knowledge and facul∣ties are adequate to the sphere of his duty. Be∣yond this, his researches are impertinent, and all his acquisitions useless. He has no ade∣quate notions what the laws of the universe are with respect to any species of existence whatever. A cloud rests on the complicated movements of this great machine, which baffles all the penetration of mortals: and it will for ever remain impossible for man, from the most complete analysis of his pre∣sent situation, to judge, with any degree of precision, of his own consequence, either as a citizen of the world at large, or as a mem∣ber of any particular society.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="51"/>
FINAL causes form a system of knowledge too wonderful for man. It is the perrogative of nature alone to decide upon them. In the fulness of time, her creative hand brought him into existence, and it belongs to her alone, in consequence of an arrangement equally wonderful and mysterious to dismiss him from his present mode of being. This is an authority with which she alone is invested, and which, according to our apprehensions, it is impossible for her to delegate. Dissolution, as well as creation, is hers, and he who would attempt to infringe her sovereignty in this in∣stance, would usurp a prerogative which does not belong to him, and become a traitor to the laws of his being. Nay, on this extrava∣gant and licentious hypothesis, the right of assuming and relinquishing existence is made reciprocal. For he who arrogates the liberty of destroying himself, were he possessed of the power, might also be his own creator; his i∣maginary insignificance to society being as inconclusive in the one case, as any chime∣rical advantage that may accidentally strike him can be in the other. It is a strange doc∣trine, which cannot be established, but at the obvious expence of what seem the plainest dictates of common sense.</P>

When we come to pronounce on the condi∣tion of human infancy, and to seperate child∣hood, or non-age, from a state of maturity, we can scarce trace one useful or salutary consequence it is calculated to produce in society. In this view children seem less a∣dapted to serve any special or important end, than even beetles, gnats, or flies. Experience, however, has long convinced the world of their present inestimable value from their future destination. And were a legislator, from the plausible pretext of their being a burden to the state, to exterminate the race of mankind in the insignificant stage of infancy, his de∣cree, like that of a certain monster recorded in the gospel, would shock the sentiments of every nation under heaven, in whom there remained only the dregs of humanity.</P>
<P>IT is not only impossible for a man to de∣cide, in any given period, of the progress of his existence, or what utility or consequence he may be to society; but without the faculty of prescience, it is still more impracticable for him to divine what purposes he may be intended to serve in the many mysterious revo∣lations of futurity. How far his mortal may be connected with his immortal life, must rest with him who has the sole disposal of it. But who told him that his load of misery was too much to bear, that he was not able to sus∣tain
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
it? or that his merciful father would not proportionate his sufferings to his abilities? How does he know how short-lived the pres∣sure of incumbent sorrow may prove? It be∣comes not him to prescribe to his maker, or because his evils are enormous, to conclude they must be permanent. Rash man! thy heart is in the hand of heaven, and he <HI>who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,</HI> may either lighten the burthen that oppresses thee, or blunt the edge of that sensibility, from which it derives the greatest poignancy. What me∣dicine is to the wounds of the body, that re∣signation is to those of the soul. Be not deficient in this virtue, and life will never pre∣scribe a duty you cannot perform, or inflict a pang which you cannot bear. Resignation changes the grizzly aspect of affliction, turns sickness into health, and converts the gloomy forebdoings of despair into the grateful pre∣sentiments of hope. Besides, the most insig∣nificant instruments are sometimes, in the hands of eternal providence, employed in bringing about the most general and benefi∣cent revolutions. It is by making weakness thus subservient to power, evil to good, and pain to pleasure, that he who governs the world illustrates his sovereinty and omnipo∣tence. Till, then, thou art able to compre∣hend the whole mysterious system of every possible existence, till thou art certain that thy life is totally insignificant, till thou art

convinced it is not in the might of infinite power to render thee serviceable either to thy∣self or others, counteract not the benignity of providence by suicide, or, in this manner, by the blackest of all treasons, betray thy trust, and wage, at fearful odds, hostility against the very means and author of thy being.</P>
<P>ONE very obvious consequence arising from suicide, which none of its advocates appear to have foreseen, and which places it in a light exceedingly gross and shocking, is, that it supposes every man capable, not only of destroying himself, but of delegating the pow∣er of committing murder to another.

doctrine in the gospel, that, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. And how are they to perform their duty, who, in the instant of dying, contract a guilt, which ren∣ders it indispensible.

Unable, as they are, to account for its origin, they cor∣dially and universally indulge it, as one of their tenderest, best, and last feelings. It inha∣bits alike the rudest and most polished minds, and never leaves any human breast, which is not either wholly engrossed by criminal plea∣sure, deadened by selfish pursuits, or per∣verted by false reasoning.

<P>(2) The natural perceptions of pleasure or pain cannot be said to act on the mind as one part of matter does on another. The sub∣stance of the soul we do not know, but are
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
certain her ideas must be immaterial. And these cannot possibly act either by contact or impulse. When one body impels another, the body moved is affected only by the impulse. But the mind, whenever roused by any plea∣sing or painful sensation, in most cases looks round her, and deliberates whether a change of state is proper, or the present more eligible; and moves or rests accord∣dingly. Her preceptions, therefore, contri∣bute no further to action, than by exciting her active powers. On the contrary, matter is blindly and obstinately in that state in which it is, whether of motion or rest, till changed by some other adequate cause. Sup∣pose we rest the state of any body, some ex∣ternal force is requisite to put it in motion; and, in proportion as this force is greater or small, the motion must be swift or flow. Did not this body continue in its former state, no external force would be requisite to change it; nor, when changed, would different degrees of force be necessary to move it in different de∣grees of velocity. When motion is impressed on any body, to bring it to rest, an <HI>extra</HI>-force must always be applied, in proportion to the intended effect. This resistance is ob∣servable in bodies both when moved in par∣ticular directions, and to bear an exact propor∣tion to the <HI>vis impressia,</HI> and to the quantity of matter moved. Were it possible to extract from matter the qualities of solidity and ex∣tension,
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
the matter whence such qualities were extracted would no longer resist; and con∣sequently resistance is the necessary result of them, which, therefore, in all directions must be the same. The degree of resistance in any body being proportionate to the <HI>vis impressa,</HI> it follows, when that body is considered in a∣ny particular state, whether of motion or rest, the degrees of resistance must either indefinitely multiply, or decrease, according to all possible degrees of the moving force. But when the same body is considered absolutely, or without fixing any particular state, the resistance is immutable; and all the degrees of it, which that body would exert upon the accession of any impressed force, must be conceived as ac∣tually in it. Nor can matter have any ten∣dency contrary to that resistance, otherwise it must be equal or superior. If equal, the two contrary tendencies would destroy each other. If superior, the resistance would be destroyed. Thus change would eternally succeed to change without one intermediate instant, so that no time would be assigned when any bo∣dy was in any particular state. Gravitation itself, the most simple and universal law, seems far from being a tendency natural to mat∣ter; since it is found to act internally, and not in proportion to the superfices of any bo∣dy; which it would not do, if it were only the mechanical action of matter upon matter.
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
From all this, it appears, that matter con∣sidered merely as such, is so far from having a principle of spontaneous motion, that it is stubbornly inactive, and must eternally remain in the same state in which it happens to be, except influenced by some other—that is, some immaterial power. Of such a power the human soul is evidently possessed; for every one is conscious of an internal activity, and to dispute this would be to dispute us out of one of the most real and intimate per∣ceptions we have.</P>
<P>Though a material automaton were allow∣ed possible, how infinitely would it fall short of that force and celerity which every one feels in himself. How sluggish are all the movements which fall under our observation. How slow and gradual their transitions from one part of space to another. But the mind, by one instantaneous effort, measures the distance from pole to pole, from heaven to earth, from one fixed star to another; and not confined within the limits of the visible creation, shoots into immensity with a rapi∣dity to which even that of lightning, or sun∣beams, is no comparison. Who then shall assign a period, which, though depressed with so much dead weight, is ever active, and unconscious of fatigue or relaxation? The mind is not only herself a principle of action, but probably actuates the body, without the
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
assistance of any intermediate power, both from the gradual command which she ac∣quires of its members by habit, and from a capacity of determining, in some measure, the quantity of pleasure or pain which any sen∣sible perception can give her. Supposing the interposing power a spirit, the same difficul∣ty of spirit acting upon matter still remains. And the volition of our own mind will as well account for the motion of the body, as the formal interference of any other spiritual substance. And we may as well ask, why the mind is not conscious of that interposition, as why she is ignorant of the means by which she communicates motion to the body.</P>

<P>(3) It is always bad reasoning to draw con∣clusions from the premises not denied by your adversary. Whoever, yet, of all the assertors of the soul's immortality, presumed to make a mo∣nopoly of this great privilege to thehuman race? Who can tell what another state of existence may be, or whether every other species of a∣nimals may not possess principles as immor∣tal as the mind of man? But that mode of reasoning, which militates against all our convictions, solely on account of the una∣voidable ignorance to which our sphere in the universe subjects us, can never be satisfactory. Reason, it is true, cannot altogether solve e∣very doubt which arises concerning this im∣portant truth. But neither is there any o∣ther
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
truth, of any denomination whatever, a∣gainst which sophistry may not conjure up a multitude of exceptions. We know no mode of existence but those of matter and spirit, neither of which have uniformly and successfully defied the extreme subtilty of ar∣gumentation. Still a very great majority of mankind are staunch believers in both. So well constituted is the present disposition of things, that all the principles essential to human life and happiness continue, as it is likely they ever will, to operate, in spite of every sort of clamour which sophistry or scepticism has raised or can raise against them.</P>

<P>(4) There is not a single word in all this elabarate and tedious deduction, which has not been urged and refuted five hundred times. Our ignorance of the divine perfections, as is usual with this writer, is here stated as an unanswerable exception to the conclusion usu∣ally drawn from them. But he very artfully overlooks, that this great ignorance will be equally conclusive as applied to either side of the argument. When we compare, however, the character of God, as a wise superinten∣dant, and generous benefactor, with the state in which things at present appear, where vir∣tue is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> depressed and afflicted, and vice ap∣parently triumphs, it will be treated with the infamy it merits, and virtue receive that
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
happiness and honour, which, from its own intrinsic worth, it deserves, and, from its conformity to the nature of God, it has reason to expect.</P>
<P>This subject, perhaps, has been too much exaggerated, and some pious men have weakly thought, the best way to convince us that order and happiness prevailed in a future state, was to persuade us that there was none at all in this. External advantages have been ta∣ken for the only goods of human nature; and, because, in this view, all things speak the appearance of mal-administration, we have been taught to expect a government of recti∣tude and benevolence hereafter. Let us, on the contrary, candidly own that virtue is so∣vereignly and solely good, lest, by depreciating her charms, we obliquely detract from the character of God himself. Let us confess her undowered excellence superior to all the inconveniences that may attend her, even in the present situation. But, without allow∣ing some difference between poverty and riches, sickness and health, pain and pleasure, &amp;c. we shall have no foundation to prefer∣ence; and it will be in vain to talk of se∣lecting where no one choice can be more a∣greeable or disagreeable to nature than ano∣ther. Upon this difference, therefore, how∣ever it be called, let the present argument proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64"/>
If infinite goodness be the spirit and cha∣racteristic of this universal government, then every advantage, however inconsiderable in kind or degree, must either be supposed imme∣diately bestowed on virtue; or, at least, that such retributions will, at some time, be made her, as may not only render her votaries equal, but superior to those of vice, in proportion to their merit. But how different the case is in human life, history and observation may ea∣sily convince us; so that one, whose eyes are not intent on the character of God, and the nature of virtue, would often be tempted to think this world a theatre merely intended for mournful spectacles and pomps of horror. How many persons do we see perish by the mere wants of nature, who, had they been in dif∣ferent circumstances, would have thanked God with tears of joy for the power of communica∣ting those advantages they now implore from others in vain? While, at the same time, they have, perhaps, the additional misery of seeing the most endeared relations involved in the same deplorable fate! How often do we see those ties which unite the soul and body, worn out by the gradual advances of a lingering disease, or burst at once by the sud∣den efforts of unutterable agony? While the unhappy sufferers, had they been continued in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, might have diffused happiness, not only through the narrow circle of their
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
friends and neighbourhood, but as extensive∣ly as their country, and even the world at large. How many names do we see buried in obscurity, or soiled with detraction, which ought to have shone the first in fame? How many heroes have survived the liberties of their country, or died in abortive attempts to preserve them; and, by their fall, only left a larger field for the lawless ravages of ty∣ranny and oppression?</P>
<P>But were it possible, how long and insupera∣ble would be the task to enumerate all the ingredients which compose the present cup of bitterness? And is this the consummation of things? Will supreme and essential good∣ness no way distinguish such as have invari∣ably pursued his honour, and the interest of his government, from those who have industri∣ously violated the order he has appointed in things? who have blotted the face of nature with havock, murder, and desolation; and shewn a constant intention to counteract all the benevolent designs of providence? It is confessed that the virtuous, happy in the pos∣session of virtue alone, make their exit from the present scene with blessings to the Creator, for having called them to existence, and given them the glorious opportunity of enjoying what is in itself supremely eligible. They are conscious that this felicity can receive no accession from any external lustre or advan∣tage
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
whatever. Yet it seems highly necessary in the divine administration, that those who have been dazzled with the false glare of pros∣perous wickedness, should at last be unde∣ceived; that they should at last behold virtue conspicuous, in all her native splendor and majesty as she shines, the chief delight of God, and ultimate happiness of all intelligent nature.</P>
<P>The language of religion, and our own hearts, on this important argument, is equally comfortable and decisive. It accumulates and enforces whatever can inspire us with confi∣dence in that God, who is not the God of the dead, but of the living; who reigns in the invisible, as well as in the visible world; and whose attention to our welfare ceases not with our lives, but is commensurate to the full ex∣tent of our being. Indeed the votaries of the soul's mortality may as well be honest for once, and speak out what so many fools think in their hearts. For what is God to us, or we to him, if our connection extends but to the pitiful space allotted us in such a pitiful world as this is? To be sure, no absurdity will be rejected, which can smother the feel∣ings, or keep the vices of profligates in coun∣tenance; but, if only made like worms and reptiles beneath our feet, to live this moment, and expire the next, to struggle in a wretch∣ed life with every internal and external cala∣mity,
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
that can assault our bodies, or infest our minds; to bear the mortifications of maligni∣ty, and the unmerited abhorrence of those who perhaps may owe us the greatest and ten∣derest esteem, and then, sunk in everlasting ob∣livion, our fate would stand on record, in the annals of the universe, an eternal exception to all that can be called good.</P>
<P>Suppose a father possessed of the most ex∣quisite tenderness for his son, delighted with his similarity of form, his promising consti∣tution, his strength, gracefulness, and agility, his undisguised emotions of filial affection, with the various presages of a superior geni∣us and understanding. Let us suppose this father pleased with the employment of impro∣ving his faculties, and inspiring him with future hopes of happiness and dignity: but that he may give him a quicker sensibility to the misfortunes of others, and a more unshaken fortitude to sustain his own, he often presers younger brethren, and even strangers, to those advantages which otherwise merit, and the force of nature would determine him to be∣stow on so worthy an offspring. Let us go further, and imagine, if we can, that this fa∣ther, without the least diminution of tender∣ness, or any other apparent reason, destroys his son in the bloom of life, and height of ex∣pectation: Who would not lament the fate of such a youth with inconsolable tears?
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
Doomed never more to behold the agreeable light of Heaven! never more to display his per∣sonal graces, nor exercise his manly powers, never more to feel his heart warm with bene∣volent regards, nor taste the soul-transporting pleasure of obliging and being obliged! Blot∣ted at once from existence, and the fair cre∣ation, he sinks into silence and oblivion, with all his sublime hopes disappointed, all his im∣mense desires ungratified, and all his intellectu∣al faculties unimproved. Without mentioning the instinctive horror which must attend such an action, how absurd to reason, and how in∣consistent with the common feelings of hu∣manity would it be to suppose a father ca∣pable of such a deed. Forbid it, God! for∣bid it, Nature! that we should impute to the munificent father of being and happiness, what, even in the lowest of rational creatures, would be monstrous and detestable!</P>

<P>(5) The truth is, that form which all man∣kind have deemed immortal, is so far from be∣ing the frailest, that it seems in fact the most indissoluble and permanent of any other we know. All the rational and inventtive powers of the mind happily conspire to pro∣claim her infinitely different in nature, and superior in dignity to every possible modifi∣cation of pure matter. Were mankind
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
joined in society, was life polished and culti∣vated, were the sciences and arts, not only of utility, but elegance, produced by matter? by a brute mass? A substance so contrary to all activity and intelligence, that it seems the work of an omnipotent hand alone to connect them. What judgment should we form of that principle which informed and enlightened a Galileo, a Copernicus, or a Newton? What inspiration taught them, to place the sun in the center of this system, and assign the various orbs their revolutions round him, reducing motions so diverse and unequal, to uniform and simple laws? Was it not something like that great eternal mind, which first gave existence to those lu∣minous orbs, and prescribed each of them their province? Whence the infinite har∣mony and variety of sound, the copious flows of eloquence, the bolder graces and more inspired elevations of poetry, but from a mind, an immaterial being, the reflected image of her all-perfect Creator, in whom eter∣nally dwells all beauty and excellence. Were man only endowed with a principle of ve∣getation, fixed to one peculiar spot, and in∣sensible of all that passed around him; we might, then, with some colour, suppose that energy, if it may be so called, perishable. Were, he like animals possessed of mere vita∣bility, and qualified only to move and feel, still we might have some reason to fear that,

in some future period of duration, our Creator might resume his gift of existence. But can any one, who pretends to the least reflection, ima∣gine that such a being as the human soul, a∣dorned with such extensive intellectual pow∣ers, will ever cease to be the object of that love and care which eternally holds the uni∣verse in its embrace? Did she obtain such a boundless understanding merely to taste the pleasure of exercising it? to catch a transient glance of its objects, and perish? Formed, as she is, to operate on herself, and all things round her, must she cease from action, while yet the mighty task is scarce begun? must she lose those faculties, by which she retains the past, comprehends the presents and pre∣sages the future? must she contemplate no more those bright impressions of divinity, which are discovered in the material world; nor those stronger, and more animated features of the same eternal beauty which shine in her own god-like form? And must she be absorbed forever in the womb of unessential nothing? Strange, that in the view, and even in the arms of infinite power and goodness, a dawn so fair and promising, should at one be cloud∣ed with all the horrors of eternal night?

<HEAD>LETTER CXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Lord B—.</HEAD>
<P>YES, my Lord, I confess it; the weight of life is too heavy for my soul. I have long endured it as a burden; I have lost eve∣ry thing which could make it dear to me, and nothing remains but irksomeness and vexation. I am told, however, that I am not at liberty to dispose of my life, without the permission of that Being from whom I received it. I am sensible likewise that you have a right over it by more titles than one. Your care has twice preserved it, and your goodness is its constant security. I will ne∣ver
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
dispose of it, till I am certain that I may do it without a crime, and till I have not the least hope of employing it for your ser∣vice.</P>
<P>You told me that I should be of use to you; why did you deceive me? Since we have been in London, so far from thinking of employ∣ing me in your concerns, you have been kind enough to make me your only concern. How superfluous is your obliging solicitude! My lord, you know I abhor a crime, even worse than I detest life; I adore the supreme Being—I owe every thing to you; I have an affection for you; you are the only person on earth to whom I am attached. Friendship and du∣ty may chain a wretch to this earth: sophistry and vain pretences will never detain him. En∣lighten my understanding, speak to my heart; I am ready to hear you, but remember, that despair is not to be imposed upon.</P>
<P>You would have me apply to the test of reason: I will; let us reason. You desire me to deliberate in proportion to the impor∣tance
<PB N="69" REF="73"/>
of the question in debate; I agree to it. Let us investigate truth with temper and moderation; let us discuss this general propo∣sition with the same indifference we should treat any other. Robeck wrote an apology for suicide before he put an end end to his life. I will not, after his example, write a book on the subject, neither am I well satisfied with that which he has penned, but I hope in this discussion at least to imitate his moderation.</P>
<P>I have for a long time meditated on this awful subject. You must be sensible that I have, for you know my destiny, and yet I am alive. The more I reflect, the more I am con∣vinced that the question may be reduced to this fundamental proposition. Every man has a right by nature to pursue what he thinks good, and avoid what he thinks evil, in all respects which are not injurious to others. When our life therefore becomes a misery to our∣selves, and is of advantage to no one, we are at liberty to put an end to our being. If there is any such thing as a clear and self-evident
<PB N="70" REF="74"/>
principle, certainly this is one, and if this be subverted, there is scarce an action in life which may not be made criminal.</P>
<P>Let us hear what the philosophers say on this subject. First, they consider life as something which is not our own, because we hold it as a gift; but because it has been given to us, is it for that reason our own? Has not God given these sophists two arms? ne∣vertheless, when they are under apprehensi∣ons of a mortification, they do not scruple to amputate one, or both if there be occasion. By a parity of reasoning, we may convince those who believe in the immortality of the soul; for if I sacrifice my arm to the preservation of something more precious, which is my body, I have the same right to sacrifice my body to the preservation of something more valuable, which is, the happiness of my existence. If all the gifts which heaven has bestowed are naturally designed for our good, they are certainly too apt to change their nature; and Providence has endowed us with reason, that we may discern the difference. If this rule
<PB N="71" REF="75"/>
did not authorize us to chuse the one, and re∣ject the other, to what use would it serve a∣mong mankind?</P>
<P>But they turn this weak objection into a thousand shapes. They consider a man li∣ving upon earth as a soldier placed on duty. God, say they, has fixed you in this world, why do you quit your station without his leave? But you, who argue thus, has he not stationed you in the town where you was born, why therefore do you quit it without his leave? is not misery, of itself, a sufficient permission? whatever station Providence has assigned me, whether it be in a regiment, or on the earth at large, he intended me to stay there while I found my situation agreeable, and to leave it when it became intolerable. This is the voice of nature, and the voice of God. I agree that we must wait for an order; but when I die a na∣tural death, God does not order me to quit life, he takes it from me; it is by rendering life in∣supportable, that he orders me to quit it. In the first case, I resist with all my force; in the second, I have the merit of obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="76"/>
Can you conceive that there are some people so absurd as to arraign suicide as a kind of re∣bellion against Providence, by an attempt to fly from his laws? but we do not put an end to our being in order to withdraw ourselves from his commands, but to execute them. What! does the power of God extend no far∣ther than to my body? is there a spot in the universe, is there any being in the universe, which is not subject to his power, and will that power have less immediate influence over me when my being is refined, and thereby be∣comes less compound, and of nearer resem∣blance to the divine essence? no, his justice and goodness are the foundation of my hopes; and if I thought that death would withdraw me from his power, I would give up my reso∣lution to die.</P>
<P>This is one of the quibbles of the Phaedo, which, in other respects, abounds with sublime truths. If your slave destroys himself, says Socrates to Cebes, would you not punish him, for having unjustly deprived you of your pro∣perty;
<PB N="73" REF="77"/>
prithee, good Socrates, do we not be∣long to God after we are dead? The case you put is not applicable; you ought to argue thus: if you incumber your slave with a habit which confines him from discharging his duty pro∣perly, will you punish him for quitting it, in order to render you better service? the grand error lies in making life of too great impor∣tance; as if our existence depended upon it, and that death was a total annihilation. Our life is of no consequence in the sight of God; it is of no importance in the eyes of reason, neither ought it to be of any in our sight; when we quit our body, we only lay aside an incon∣venient habit. Is this circumstance so pain∣ful, to be the occasion of so much disturbance? my Lord, these declaimers are not in earnest. Their arguments are absurd and cruel, for they aggravate the supposed crime, as if it put a pe∣riod to existence, and they punish it, as if that existence was eternal.</P>
<P>With respect to Plato's Phaedo, which has furnished them with the only specious argu∣ment that has ever been advanced, the question
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
is discussed there in a very light and desultory manner. Socrates being condemned, by an un∣just judgment, to lose his life in a few hours, had no occasion to enter into an accurate enquiry whether he was at liberty to dispose of it him∣self. Supposing him really to have been the author of those discourses which Plato ascribes to him, yet believe me, my lord, he would have meditated with more attention on the sub∣ject, had he been in circumstances which re∣quired him to reduce his speculations to prac∣tice; and a strong proof that no valid objec∣tion can be drawn from that immortal work against the right of disposing of our own lives, is, that Cato read it twice through the very night that he destroyed himself.</P>
<P>The same sophisters make it a question whe∣ther life can ever be an evil? but when we consider the multitude of errors, torments, and vices, with which it abounds, one would ra∣ther be inclined to doubt whether it can ever be a blessing. Guilt incessantly besieges the most virtuous of mankind. Every moment he lives he is in danger of falling a prey to the wicked, or of being wicked himself. To
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
struggle and to endure, is his lot in this world; that of the dishonest man is to do evil, and to suffer. In every other particular they differ, and only agree in sharing the mi∣series of life in common. If you required au∣thorities and facts, I could recite you the ora∣cles of old, the answers of the sages, and pro∣duce instances where acts of virtue have been recompensed with death. But let us leave these considerations, my lord; it is to you whom I address myself, and I ask you what is the chief attention of a wise man in this life, except, if I may be allowed the expression, to collect himself inwardly, and endeavour, e∣ven while he lives, to be dead to every object of sense? The only way by which wisdom di∣rects us to avoid the miseries of human nature, is it not to detach ourselves from all earthly objects, from every thing that is gross in our composition, to retire within ourselves, and to raise our thoughts to sublime contemplations? If therefore our misfortunes are derived from our passions and errors, with what eagerness should we wish for a state which will deliver us both from the one and the other? What is
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
the fate of those sons of sensuality, who indis∣creetly multiply their torments by their plea∣sures? they in fact destroy their existence by extending their connections in this life; they increase the weight of their crimes by their nu∣merous attachments; they relish no enjoy∣ments, but what are succeeded by a thousand bitter wants; the more lively their sensibi∣lity, the more acute their sufferings; the stron∣ger they are attached to life, the more wretch∣ed they become.</P>
<P>But admitting it, in general, a benefit to man∣kind to crawl upon the earth with gloomy sad∣ness, I do not mean to intimate that the human race ought with one common consent to de∣stroy themselves, and make the world one im∣mense grave. But there are miserable beings, who are too much exalted to be governed by vulgar opinion; to them despair and grievous torments are the passports of nature. It would be as ridiculous to suppose that life can be a blessing to such men, as it was absurd in the sophister Possidonius to deny that is was an
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
evil, at the same time that he endured all the torments of the gout. While life is agreeable to us, we earnestly wish to prolong it, and no∣thing but a sense of extreme misery can extin∣guish the desire of existence; for we natural∣ly conceive a violent dread of death, and this dread conceals the miseries of human nature from our sight. We drag a painful and me∣lancholy life, for a long time before we can resolve to quit it; but when once life becomes so insupportable as to overcome the horror of death, then existence is evidently a great evil, and we cannot disengage ourselves from it too soon. Therefore, though we cannot ex∣actly ascertain the point at which it ceases to be a blessing, yet at least we are certain that it is an evil long before it appears to be such, and with every sensible man the right of quit∣ting life is, by a great deal, precedent to the temptation.</P>
<P>This is not all. After they have denied that life can be an evil, in order to bar our right of making away with ourselves; they confess immediately afterwards that it is an
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
evil, by reproaching us with want of courage to support it. According to them, it is cowar∣dice to withdraw ourselves from pain and trouble, and there are none but dastards who destroy themselves. O Rome, thou vic∣trix of the world, what a race of cowards did thy empire produce! let Arria, Eponina, Lu∣cretia, be of the number; they were women. But Brutus, Cassius, and thou great and di∣vine Cato, who didst share with the gods the adoration of an astonished world, thou whose sacred and august presence animated the Ro∣mans with holy zeal, and made tyrants trem∣ble, little did thy proud admirers imagine that paltry rhetoricians, immured in the dusty cor∣ner of a college, would ever attempt to prove that thou wert a coward, for having preferred death to a shameful existence.</P>
<P>O the dignity and energy of your modern writers! how sublime, how intrepid are you with your pens? but tell me, thou great and valiant hero, who dost so courageously decline the battle, in order to endure the pain of li∣ving somewhat longer; when a spark of fire
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
lights upon your hand, why do you with∣draw it in such haste? how? are you such a coward that you dare not bear the scorching of fire? nothing, you say, can oblige you to endure the burning spark; and what obliges me to endure life? was the creation of a man of more difficulty to Providence, than that of a straw? and is not both one and the other equally the work of his hands?</P>
<P>Without doubt, it is an evidence of great fortitude to bear with firmness the misery which we cannot shun; none but a fool, how∣ever, will voluntarily endure evils which he can avoid without a crime; and it is very often a great crime to suffer pain unnecessarily. He who has not resolution to deliver himself from a miserable being by a speedy death, is like one who would rather suffer a wound to mortify, than trust to a surgeon's knife for his cure. Come, thou worthy—out off this leg, which endangers my life. I will see it done without shrinking, and will give that hero leave to call me coward, who suffers his leg to mortify, because he dares not undergo the same operation.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84"/>
I acknowledge that there are duties owing to others, the nature of which will not allow every man to dispose of his life; but, in return, how many are there which give him a right to dispose of it? let a magistrate on whom the welfare of a nation depends, let a father of a family who is bound to procure subsistence for his children, let a debtor who might ruin his creditors, let these at all events discharge their duty; ad∣mitting a thousand other civil and domestic relations to oblige an honest and unfortunate man to support the misery of life, to avoid the greater evil of doing injustice; is it, there∣fore, under circumstances totally different, in∣cumbent on us to preserve a life oppressed with a swarm of miseries, when it can be of no service but to him who has not courage to die? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Kill me, my child,"</Q> says the decrepid savage to his son, who carries him on his shoulders, and bends under his weight; the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"enemy is at hand; go to battle with thy brethren; go and preserve thy children, and do not suffer thy helpless father to fall
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
alive into the hands of those whose relations he has mangled."</Q> Though hunger, sick∣ness, and poverty, those domestic plagues, more dreadful than savage enemies, may al∣low a wretched cripple to consume, in a sick bed, the provisions of a family which can scarce subsist itself, yet he who has no con∣nections, whom heaven has reduced to the necessity of living alone, whose wretched ex∣istence can produce no good, why should not he, at least, have the right of quitting a stati∣on, where his complaints are troublesome, and his sufferings of no benefit?</P>
<P>Weigh these considerations, my lord; col∣lect these arguments, and you will find that they may be reduced to the most simple of na∣ture's rights, of which no man of sense ever yet entertained a doubt. In fact, why should we be allowed to cure ourselves of the gout, and not to get rid of the misery of life? do not both evils proceed from the same hand? to what purpose is it to say, that death is painful? are drugs agreeable to be taken? no, nature revolts against both. Let them prove there∣fore
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
that it is more justifiable to cure a transi∣ent disorder by the application of remedies, than to free ourselves from an incurable evil by putting an end to our life; and let them shew how it can be less criminal to use the bark for a fever, than to take opium for the stone. If we consider the object in view, it is in both cases to free ourselves from painful sensations; if we regard the means, both one and the other are equally natural; if we consider the repugnance of our nature, it ope∣rates equally on both sides; if we attend to the will of providence, can we struggle against any evil of which it is not the author? can we deliver ourselves from any torment which the hand of God has not inflicted? what are the bounds which limit his power, and when is resistance lawful? are we then to make no alteration in the condition of things, because every thing is in the state he appointed? must we do nothing in this life, for fear of infring∣ing his laws, or is it in our power to break them if we would? no, my lord, the occupa∣tion of man is more great and noble. God did not give him life that he should su∣pinely
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
remain in a state of constant inactivity. But he gave him freedom to act, conscience to will, and reason to choose what is good. He has constituted him sole judge of all his actions. He has engraved this precept in his heart, Do whatever you conceive to be for your own good, provided you thereby do no injury to others. If my sensations tell me that death is eligible, I resist his orders by an obstinate re∣solution to live; for, by making death desira∣ble, he directs me to put an end to my be∣ing.</P>
<P>My lord, I appeal to your wisdom and can∣dour; what more infallible maxims can rea∣son deduce from religion, with respect to su∣icide? If Christians have adopted contrary te∣nets, they are neither drawn from the prin∣ciples of religion, nor from the only sureguide, the Scriptures, but borrowed from the Pagan philosophers. Lactantius and Augustine, the first who propagated this new doctrine, of which Jesus Christ and his apostles take no notice, ground their arguments entirely on the reasoning of Phaedo, which I have alrea∣dy

controverted; so that the believers, who, in this respect, think they are supported by the authority of the Gospel, are in fact only countenaced by the authority of Plato. In truth, where do we find, throughout the whole bible any law against suicide, or so much as a bare disapprobation of it; and is it not very unaccountable, that among the instan∣ces produced of persons who devoted them∣selves to death, we do not find the least word of improbation against examples of this kind? nay, what is more, the instance of Samson's voluntary death is authorized by a miracle, by which he revenges himself of his enemies. Would this miracle have been displayed to justify a crime; and would this man, who lost his strength by suffering himself to be seduced by the allurements of a woman, have recovered it to commit an authorised crime, as if God himself would practice deceit on men?</P>
<P>Thou shalt do no murder, says the deca∣logue; what are we to infer from this? if this commandment is to be taken literally, we
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
must not destroy malefactors, nor our enemies: and Moses, who put so many people to death, was a bad interpreter of his own precept. If there are any exceptions, certainly the first must be in favour of suicide, because it is ex∣empt from any degree of violence and injus∣tice, the two only circumstances which can make homicide criminal; and because nature, moreover, has, in this respect, thrown suffici∣ent obstacles in the way.</P>
<P>But still they tell us, we must patiently endure the evils which God inflicts, and make a merit of our sufferings. This appli∣cation however of the maxims of Christianity, is very ill calculated to satisfy our judgment. Man is subject to a thousand troubles, his life is a complication of evils, and he seems to have been born only to suffer. Reason di∣rects him to shun as many of these evils as he can avoid; and religion, which is never in contradiction to reason, approves of his endea∣vours. But how inconsiderable is the account of these evils, in comparison with those he is obliged to endure against his will? It is with
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
respect to these, that a merciful God allows man to claim the merit of resistance; he receives the tribute he has been pleased to impose, as a voluntary homage, and he places our resigna∣tion in this life to our profit in the next. True repentance is derived from nature; if man endures whatever he is obliged to suffer, he does, in this respect, all that God requires of him; and if any one is so inflated with pride, as to attempt more, he is a madman, who ought to be confined, or an impostor, who ought to be punished. Let us, therefore, with∣out scruple, fly from all the evils we can a∣void; there will still be too many left for us to endure. Let us, without remorse, quit life itself when it becomes a torment to us, since it is in our own power to do it, and that in so doing we neither offend God nor man. If we would offer a sacrifice to the supreme Being, is it nothing to undergo death? let us devote to God that which he demands by the voice of reason, and into his hands let us peaceably surrender our souls.</P>
<P>Such are the liberal precepts which good
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
sense dictates to every man, and which religi∣on authorises<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A strange letter this for the discussion of such a subject! Do men argue so coolly on a question of this nature, when they examine it on their own accounts? Is the letter a for∣gery, or does the author reason only with an intent to be refuted? What makes our opinion in this particular dubious, is the example of Robeck, which he cites, and which seems to warrant his own. Robeck deliberated so gravely that he had patience to write a book, a large, voluminous, weighty, and dispassionate book; and when he had concluded, according to his principles, that it was law∣ful to put an end to out being, he destroyed himself with the same composure that he wrote. Let us beware of the preju∣dices of the times, and of particular countries. When sui∣cide is out of fashion we conclude that none but madmen destroy themselves; and all the efforts of courage appear chi∣merical to dastardly minds; every one judges of others by him∣self. Nevertheless, how many instances are there, well attes∣tested, of men, in every other respect perfectly discreet, who, without remorse, rage, or despair, have quitted life for no o∣ther reason than because it was a burden to them, and have died with more composure than they lived?</NOTE>. Let us apply these precepts to ourselves. You have condescended to dis∣close your mind to me; I am acquainted with your uneasiness; you do not endure less than myself; and your troubles, like mine, are incurable; and they are the more remedi∣less,
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
as the laws of honour are more immuta∣ble than those of fortune. You bear them, I must confess, with fortitude. Virtue supports you; advance but one step farther, and she dis∣engages you. You intreat me to suffer; my lord, I dare importune you to put an end to your sufferings; and I leave you to judge which of us is most dear to the other.</P>
<P>Why should we delay doing that which we must do at last? shall we wait till old age and decrepid baseness attach us to life, after they have robbed it of its charms, and till we are doomed to drag an infirm and decrepid body with labour, and ignominy, and pain? We are at an age when the soul has vigour to dis∣engage itself with ease from its shackles, and when a man knows how to die as he ought; when farther advanced in years, he suffers himself to be torn from life, which he quits with reluctance. Let us take advantage of this time, when the tedium of life makes death desirable; and let us tremble for fear it should come in all its horrors, at the mo∣ment when we could wish to avoid it. I re∣member
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
the time, when I prayed to heaven only for a single hour of life, and when I should have died in despair if it had not been granted. Ah! what a pain it is to burst a∣sunder the ties which attach our hearts to this world, and how advisable it is to quit life the moment the connection is broken! I am sen∣sible, my lord, that we are both worthy of a purer mansion; virtue points it out, and destiny invites us to seek it. May the friend∣ship which invites us preserve our union to the latest hour! O what a pleasure for two sin∣cere friends voluntary to end their days in each others arms, to intermingle their latest breath, and at the same instant to give up the soul which they shared in common! What pain, what regret can infect their last mo∣ments? What do they quit by taking leave of the world? They go together; they quit no∣thing.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>THOU art distracted, my friend, by a fatal passion; be more discreet; do not give counsel, whilst thou standeth so much in need of advice. I have known greater e∣vils than yours. I am armed with fortitude of mind; I am an Englishman, and not afraid to die; but I know how to live and suffer as be∣comes a man. I have seen death near at hand, and have viewed it with too much indifference to go in search of it.</P>
<P>It is true, I thought you might be of use to me; my affection stood in need of yours: your endeavours might have been serviceable to me; your understanding might have en∣lightened me in the most important concern of my life; if I do not avail myself of it, who are you to impute it to? Where is it? What
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
is become of it? What are your capable of? Of what use can you be in your present con∣dition? What service can I expect from you? A senseless grief renders you stupid and un∣concerned. Thou art no man; thou art no∣thing; and if I did not consider what thou mightest be, I cannot conceive any thing more abject.</P>
<P>There is need of no other proof than your letter itself. Formerly I could discover in you good sense and truth. Your sentiments were just, your reflections proper, and I liked you not only from judgment but choice; for I considered your influence as an additional motive to excite me to the study of wisdom. But what do I perceive now in the arguments of your letter, with which you appear to be so highly satisfied? A wretched and perpetu∣al sophistry, which in the erroneous deviations of your reason shews the disorder of your mind, and which I would not stoop to refute, if I did not commiserate your delirium.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96"/>
To subvert all your reasoning with one word, I would only ask you a single question. You who believe in the existence of a God, in the immortality of the soul, and in the free∣will of man, you surely cannot suppose that an intelligent being is embodied, and station∣ed on the earth by accident only, to exist, to suffer, and to die. It is certainly most pro∣bable that the life of man is not without some design, some end, some moral object. I in∣treat you to give me a direct answer to this point; after which we will deliberately exa∣mine your letter, and you will blush to have written it.</P>
<P>But let us wave all general maxims, about which we often hold violent disputes, with∣out adopting any of them in practice; for in their applications we always find some parti∣cular circumstances which makes such an al∣teration in the state of things, that every one thinks himself dispensed from submitting to the rules which he prescribes to others; and it is well known, that every man who esta∣blishes
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
general principles deems them obliga∣tory on all the world, himself excepted. Once more let us speak to you in particular.</P>
<P>You believe that you have a right to put an end to your being. Your proof is of a very singular nature; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"because I am disposed to die, say you, I have a right to destroy my∣self."</Q> This is certainly a very convenient ar∣gument for villains of all kinds: they ought to be very thankful to you for the arms with which you have furnished them; there can be no crimes, which, according to your argu∣ments, may not be justified by the temptation to perpetrate them; and as soon as the im∣petuosity of passion shall prevail over the hor∣ror of guilt, their disposition to do evil will be considered as a right to commit it.</P>
<P>Is it lawful for you therefore to quit life? I should be glad to know whether you have begun to live? what! was you placed here on earth to do nothing in this world? did not heaven when it gave you existence give you some task or employment? If you have
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
accomplished your day's work before evening, rest yourself for the remainder of the day; you have a right to do it; but let us see your work. What answer are you prepared to make the supreme Judge, when he demands an account of your time? Tell me, what can you say to him?—I have seduced a virtu∣ous girl: I have forsaken a friend in dis∣tress. Thou unhappy wretch! point out to me that just man who can boast that he has lived long enough; let me learn from him in what manner I ought to have spent my days to be at liberty to quit life.</P>
<P>You enumerate the evils of human na∣ture. You are not ashamed to exhaust com∣mon-place topics, which have been hackney∣ed over a hundred times; and you conclude that life is an evil. But search, examine into the order of things, and see whether you can find any good which is not intermingled with evil. Does it therefore follow that there is no good in the universe, and can you confound what is in its own nature evil, with that which is only an evil accidentally? You have
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
confessed yourself, that the transitory and passive life of man is of no consequence, and only bears respect to matter from which he will soon be disencumbered; but his active and moral life, which ought to have most in∣fluence over his nature, consists in the exercise of free-will. Life is an evil to a wicked man in prosperity, and a blessing to an honest man in distress: for it is not its casual modificati∣on, but its relation to some final object which makes it either good or bad. After all, what are these cruel torments which force you to abandon life? do you imagine, that under your affected impartiality in the enumeration of the evils of this life, I did not discover that you was ashamed to speak of your own? Trust me, and do not at once abandon every virtue. Preserve at least your wonted sincerity, and speak thus openly to you friend; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have lost all hope of seducing a modest woman, I am oliged therefore to be a man of virtue; I had much rather die."</Q></P>
<P>You are weary of living; and you tell me, that life is an evil. Sooner or later you will
<PB N="96" REF="100"/>
receive consolation, and then you will say life is a blessing. You will speak with more truth, though not with better reason; for nothing will have altered but yourself. Begin the al∣teration then from this day; and, since all the evil you lament is in the disposition of your mind, correct your irregular appetites, and do not set your house on fire to avoid the trou∣ble of putting it in order.</P>
<P>I endure misery, say you: Is it in my pow∣er to avoid suffering? But this is changing the state of the question: for the subject of enquiry is, not whether you suffer, but whe∣ther your life is an evil? Let us proceed. You are wretched, you naturally endea∣vour to extricate yourself from misery. Let us see whether, for that purpose, it is necessary to die.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment examine the natural tendency of the afflictions of the mind, as in direct opposition to the evils of the body, the two substances being of contrary nature. The latter become worse and more inveterate the
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
longer they continue, and at length utterly destroy this mortal machine. The former, on the contrary, being only external and transito∣ry modifications of an immortal and uncom∣pounded essence, are insensibly effaced, and leave the mind in its original form, which is not susceptible of alteration. Grief, disquie∣tude, regret, and despair, are evils of short du∣ration, which never take root in the mind; and experience always falsifies that bitter re∣flection, which makes us imagine our misery will have no end. I will go farther; I can∣not imagine that the vices which contaminate us, are more inherent in our nature than the troubles we endure; I not only believe that they perish with the body which gives them birth, but I think, beyond all doubt, that a lon∣ger life would be sufficient to reform mankind, and that many ages of youth would teach us that nothing is preferable to virtue.</P>
<P>However this may be, as the greatest part of our physical evils are incessantly encreasing, the acute pains of the body, when they are in∣curable, may justify a man's destroying him∣self;
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
for all his faculties being distracted with pain, and the evil being without remedy, he has no longer any use either of his will or of his reason; he ceases to be a man before he is dead, and does nothing more in taking a∣way his life, than quit a body which incum∣bers him, and in which his soul is no longer resident.</P>
<P>But it is otherwise with the afflictions of the mind, which, let them be ever so acute, always carry their remedy with them. In fact, what is it that makes any evil intolerable? Nothing but its duration. The operations of surgery are generally much more painful than the disorders they cure; but the pain occasion∣ed by the latter is lasting, that of the operati∣on is momentary, and therefore preferable. What occasion is there therefore for any ope∣ration to remove troubles which die of course by their duration, the only circumstance which could render them insupportable? Is it reasonable to apply such desperate reme∣dies to evils which expire of themselves? To a man who values himself on his fortitude,
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
and who estimates years at their real value, of two ways by which he may extricate himself from the same troubles, which will appear preferable, death or time? Have patience, and you will be cured. What would you desire more?</P>
<P>Oh! you will say, it doubles my afflictions to reflect that they will cease at last! This is the vain sophistry of grief! an apoph∣thegm void of reason, of propriety, and per∣haps of sincerity. What an absurd mo∣tive of despair is the hope of terminating mi∣sery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No, my lord, we do not put an end to misery by these means, but rather fill the measure of affliction, by bursting a∣sunder the last ties which attach us to felicity. When we regret what was dear to us, grief itself still attaches us to the object we lament, which is a state less deplorable than to be attached to nothing.</NOTE>! Even allowing this fantastical reflec∣tion, who would not chuse to encrease the pre∣sent pain for a moment, under the assurance of putting an end to it, as we scarify a wound in order to heal it? and admitting any charm in grief, to make us in love with suf∣fering,
<PB N="100" REF="104"/>
when we release ourselves from it by putting an end to our being, do we not at that instant incur all that we apprehend here∣after?</P>
<P>Reflect thoroughly, young man; what are ten, twenty, thirty years, in competition with immortality? Pain and pleasure pass like a shadow; life slides away in an instant; it is nothing of itself; its value depends on the use we make of it. The good that we have done is all that remains, and it is that alone which marks its importance.</P>
<P>Therefore do not say any more that your existence is an evil, since it depends upon yourself to make it a blessing; and if it be an evil to have lived, this is an additional reason for prolonging life. Do not pretend neither to say any more that you are at liberty to die; for it is as much as to say that you have pow∣er to alter your nature, that you have a right to revolt against the author of your being, and to frustrate the end of your existence. But when you add, that your death does injury to
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
no one, do you recollect that you make this declaration to your friend?</P>
<P>Your death does injury to no one? I un∣derstand you! You think the loss I shall sus∣tain by your death of no importance; you deem my affliction of no consequence. I will urge to you no more the rights of friendship, which you despise; but are there not obliga∣tions still more dear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obligations more dear than those of friendship! Is it a philosopher who talks thus? But this affected sophist was of an amorous disposition.</NOTE>, which ought to in∣duce you to preserve your life? If there be a person in the world who loved you to that de∣gree as to be unwilling to survive you, and whose happiness depends on yours, do you think that you have no obligations to her? Will not the execution of your wicked design disturb the peace of a mind, which has been with such difficulty restored to its former in∣nocence? Are not you afraid to add fresh tor∣ments to a heart of such sensibility? Are not you apprehensive left your death should be at∣tended
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>
with a loss more fatal, which would deprive the world and virtue itself of its bright∣est ornament? And if she should survive you, are not you afraid to rouse up remorse in her bosom, which is more grievous to support than life itself? Thou ungrateful friend! thou indelicate lover! wilt thou always be taken up wholly with thyself? Wilt thou al∣ways think on thy own troubles alone? Hast thou no regard for the happiness of one who was so dear to thee? and cannot thou resolve to live for her who was willing to die with thee?</P>
<P>You talk of the duties of a magistrate, and of a father of a family; and because you are not under those circumstances, you think your∣self absolutely free. And are you then under no obligations to society, to whom you are indebted for your preservation, your talents, your understanding? do you owe nothing to your native country, and to those unhappy people who may need your existence! O what an accurate calculation you make! a∣mong the obligations you have enumerated,
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>
you have only omitted those of a man and of a citizen. Where is the virtuous patriot, who refused to enlist under a foreign prince, because his blood ought not to be spilt but in the service of his country; and who now, in a fit of despair, is ready to shed it against the ex∣press prohibition of the laws? The laws, the laws, young man! did any wise man ever despise them? Socrates, though innocent, out of regard to them refused to quit his pri∣son. You do not scruple to violate them by quitting life unjustly; and you ask, what in∣jury do I?</P>
<P>You endeavour to justify yourself by ex∣ample. You presume to mention the Romans: you talk of the Romans! it becomes you indeed to cite those illustrious names. Tell me, did Brutus die a lover in despair, and did Cato plunge the dagger in his breast for his mistress? Thou weak and abject man! what resemblance is there between Cato and thee? Shew me the common standard be∣tween that sublime soul and thine. Ah vain wretch! hold thy peace: I am afraid to pro∣fane
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
his name by a vindication of his conduct. At that august and sacred name every friend to virtue shold bow to the ground, and honour the memory of the greatest hero in silence.</P>
<P>How ill you have selected your examples, and how meanly you judge of the Romans, if you imagine that they thought themselves at liberty to quit life so soon as it became a bur∣den to them. Recur to the excellent days of that republic, and see whether you will find a single citizen of virtue, who thus freed him∣self from the discharge of his duty even after the most cruel misfortunes. When Regulus was on his return to Carthage, did he prevent the torments which he knew were preparing for him by destroying himself? What would not Posthumus have given, when obliged to pass under the yoke at Caudium, had this re∣source been justifiable? How much did e∣ven the senate admire that effort of courage, which enabled the consul Varro to survive his defeat? For what reason did so many gene∣rals voluntary surrender themselves to their e∣nemies, they to whom ignominy was so dread∣ful,
<PB N="105" REF="109"/>
and who were so little afraid of dying? It was because they considered their blood, their life, and their latest breath, as devoted to their country; and neither shame nor misfortune could dis∣suade them from this sacred duty. But when the laws were subverted, and the state became a prey to tyranny, the citizens resumed their natural liberty, and the right they had over their own lives. When Rome was no more, it was lawful for the Romans to give up their lives; they had discharged their duties on earth, they had no longer any country to defend, they were therefore at liberty to dispose of their lives, and to obtain that freedom for them∣selves which they could not recover for their country. After having spent their days in the service of expiring Rome, and in fight∣ing for the defence of its laws, they died great and virtuous as they had lived, and their death was an additional tribute to the glory of the Roman name, since none of them beheld a sight above all others most dishonourable, that of a true citizen stooping to an usurper.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="110"/>
But thou, what art thou? what hast thou done? dost thou think to excuse thyself on ac∣count of thy obscurity? does thy weakness exempt thee from thy duty, and because thou hast neither rank nor distinction in thy coun∣try, art thou less subject to the laws? It becomes you vastly to presume to talk of dy∣ing, while you owe the service of your life to your equals. Know, that a death, such as you meditate, is shameful and surreptitious. It is a theft committed on mankind in general. Before you quit life, return the benefits you have received from every individual. But, say you, I have no attachments; I am useless in the world. O thou young philosopher! art thou ignorant that thou canst not move a single step without finding some duty to ful∣fil; and that every man is useful to society, even by means of his existence alone?</P>
<P>Hear me, thou rash young man! thou art dear to me. I commiserate thy errors. If the least sense of virtue still remains in thy breast, attend, and let me teach thee to be re∣conciled
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>
to life. Whenever thou art temp∣ted to quit it, say to thyself—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me do at least one good action before I die."</Q> Then go in search for one in a state of indi∣gence, whom thou mayest relieve; for one un∣der misfortunes, whom thou mayest comfort; for one under oppression, whom thou mayest defend. Introduce to me those unhappy wretches whom my rank keeps at a distance. Do not be afraid of misusing my parle, or my credit: make free with them; distribute my fortune; make me rich. If this considera∣tion restrains you to-day, it will restrain you to-morrow; if to morrow, it will restrain you all your life. If it has no power to restrain you, die! you are below my care.</P>
