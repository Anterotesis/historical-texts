<HEAD>DALY against MAGEE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. JOHN MAGEE being in confinement under a Writ, marked for the sum of 4000<HI>l.</HI> at the suit of the Plaintiff <HI>for defamation,</HI> by Autho∣rity of A FIAT for that purpose, granted by the Lord Chief Justice, caused a notice of the fol∣lowing purport to be served on the Plaintiff's Attorney.</P>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P>COUNSEL on behalf of the Defendant will move the Court the first opportunity, to set aside the
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
order made in this cause, on the 27th day of June last, whereby it was ordered, that the De∣fendant should give SPECIAL BAIL in this cause, to the amount of the sum marked at the foot of the Writ of <HI>Capias ad respondendum,</HI> which issued in this cause; and that the Defendant's COMMON APPEARANCE may be taken, and stand without holding him to SPECIAL BAIL. But if the Court should not be pleased to grant such motion, Counsel will then move the Court to vary the said order, and that the sum for which the said writ was marked, and the Defendant thereby re∣quired to find Bail to such amount, may be RE∣DUCED from 4000<HI>l.</HI> to 500<HI>l.</HI> and the notice con∣cludes in such case with a tender of Bail to the amount of <HI>the last mentioned sum.</HI></P>
<P>N.B. Similar Notices were served in the case of Brennan against Magee, Tracy against Magee, and Higgins against Magee, who had severally obtained Fiats on the ground of DE∣FAMATION.</P>

<HEAD>MR. SHERIDAN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am in this case Counsel for Mr. <HI>John Magee,</HI> the alledged Proprietor of a News Paper, called, The <HI>Dublin Evening Post;</HI> and I could wish that the notice on his behalf, and on which I move, had not a double aspect; I could wish that it had been confined to his claim of <HI>right,</HI> and not ex∣tended to an application for <HI>favor.</HI></P>
<P>When we move, that a <HI>common appearance</HI> may be taken, without holding him to <HI>Special Bail,</HI> a great question of constitutional and public im∣portance is involved in the subject; but when we apply to <HI>reduce</HI> the sum, the application appears like an appeal to the <HI>discretion</HI> of the Court. My duty to my client, obliges me to submit my ob∣servations in each point of view, though I should rather argue it in the abstract, for another reason, I might thereby avoid the strange stuff and mate∣rial which the Plaintiff has introduced as <HI>merits</HI> into his affidavit, and I might thereby avoid (to use a dramatic quotation in a case partly theatri∣cal)
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
that stile of speech <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which though it may make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of one of whom, out-weighs, in my mind, a whole theatre of others."</Q></P>
<P>My Lords, I am in this case, with due defer∣ence, to contend, that the learned Judge was not warranted by <HI>law</HI> in issuing his Fiat for <HI>any sum;</HI> for that in this case <HI>common bail,</HI> which is no more than <HI>an appearance</HI> for the party, and properly speaking no bail at all, is all that the <HI>law</HI> re∣quires; but if your Lordships shall be of opini∣on that the learned Judge was authorised by law in issuing such Fiat, holding the Defendant to 4000<HI>l.</HI> bail, then I am to submit to your Lord∣ships, that you are bound in conscience to reduce the sum, because you are bound, and it is the true spirit of the law, to hold him to no greater bail, than in your conscience you shall think the <HI>Plaintiff can recover:</HI> and here my Lords it is ne∣cessary to call your attention to the affidavit of the Plaintiff; it is <HI>his case,</HI> and therefore I presume, put in the strongest and best manner that the na∣ture of that case would allow; it is the ground upon which a Judge's Fiat for 4000<HI>l.</HI> issued; and there never was an affidavit containing the griev∣ance of the party complaining, more <HI>weak,</HI> and more <HI>defective:</HI> THERE IS NOT THROUGHOUT
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
THIS AFFIDAVIT A SINGLE PER QUOD. The al∣legded Libel is libellous only by <HI>forced</HI> construc∣tion, by <HI>violent</HI> interpretation of an apparently <HI>unmeaning</HI> poem: the damages in amount are so far from approaching to <HI>any</HI> degree of certainty, that it is rather obvious, that <HI>none</HI> were <HI>actually</HI> sustained: it <HI>hints</HI> at damages which <HI>may be,</HI> not which <HI>are</HI> suffered; and such damages are <HI>ima∣ginary:</HI> they are <HI>poetic;</HI> they are in the <HI>fancy;</HI> the <HI>conception</HI> of the party <HI>interested;</HI> of him who seeks redress in <HI>damages.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Richard Daly</HI> stiles himself, in this, his affidavit, Manager of the Theatre Royal in the City of Dublin. He states that the Defendant, Mr. <HI>John Magee,</HI> is (as he believes) Printer and Publisher of a certain News Paper, called The <HI>Dublin Evening Post,</HI> in which Paper he, <HI>John Magee,</HI> caused to be published a defamatory Poem of the <HI>tenor</HI> in the Affidavit.</P>
<P>I should be sorry to feel myself under any ne∣cessity to recite this Poem to the Court; it is in truth a very strange composition, but may have its merit with those who understand it; but as it is the cause of a Fiat, for 4000<HI>l.</HI> and as it con∣tains, or rather is itself, the offence for which my client is in duress, until he shall procure bail to that amount; I have selected and shall faithfully
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
state such passages or parts of this poem, as by <HI>possibility</HI> may be deemed libellous.</P>
<P><Q><L>"<HI>The Gamblers retired and Roscius alone.</HI>"—</L></Q>I am free to admit that Mr. <HI>Daly,</HI> being Manager of the Theatre, <HI>may be</HI> the Roscius intended by the Poet, but this concession is somewhat unne∣cessary, as Mr. <HI>Daly</HI> in his Affidavit, swears that <HI>he</HI> is the person so described, or in other words <HI>that he is</HI> ROSCIUS.—How far this may be a Libel on Roscius deceased, on Roscius the companion of Cicero, the name at least will scarcely be deemed a Libel on Roscius the companion of Higgins.</P>
<P>Roscius laments:<Q><L>"<HI>That humble Actresses will no longer obedient bend:</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>That,<Q><L>"<HI>Francisco now delights the admiring throng.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>He then proceeds to kill himself,<Q><L>"<HI>The tragic tin bent harmless on his breast.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Then Cupid arrives, to whom Roscius says,<Q><L>"<HI>Does some lady court me to her arms,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>And buy with brilliant gold my manly charms.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="10"/>
Cupid replies,<Q><L>"<HI>There live, he said, some men of fame well known,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>For punctual dealing, and to candour prone:</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>—the Wights have money;</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Honesty against cunning has no force,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>—we'll fleece the villains.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Here a Judge is to conceive, and a jury here∣after are to conceive, that the Lottery-Office Keepers are understood, who sometime ago were so successfully, and so <HI>surprisingly</HI> hit. I am en∣deavouring to give to this silly poem all the wick∣ed effect that conjecture can admit:<Q><L>"<HI>I know the wily plot</HI> RICARDO <HI>cry'd,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>The</HI> DOCTOR <HI>in those schemes is fully try'd:</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>The</HI> DOCTOR <HI>sails to the Cambrian shore,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Then straight to the enchanted fane,—</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>—the priests the cabalistic numbers cry,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>The Doctor ties them round a pigeon's neck,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>—who flies,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>And on Francisco's portal plumes his wings.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>These are the <HI>criminal</HI> extracts from the alledg∣ed Libel, a poem full of nonsense, ribaldry, and bombast, not to be matched in a Mock Tragedy, truly farcical, were it not that the sum of 4000<HI>l.</HI> has changed the performance to a Tragi-Comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="11"/>
For the publication of this poem the defendant has been arrested under a writ issued by authority of a Fiat, and marked for 4000<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords, there have been of late, and I la∣ment it, many bold, impudent, plain, and inde∣fensible Libels; why are the weakest selected to disgrace the records of the Court, and to bring contempt upon the Justice of the country.—And now, my Lords, let me call your attention to what ought to be the <HI>material</HI> part of an affidavit, to warrant a Fiat in any case; to that part which relates to <HI>the damage sustained.</HI> In this case the <HI>single instance</HI> in which the Plaintiff <HI>endeavours</HI> to shew any special damage, HE FAILS IN THE AT∣TEMPT, and the fair inference, from his own words, is, that he has suffered <HI>little, if any.</HI></P>
<P>After swearing that he had expended consider∣able sums, in the embellishment of the Theatre Royal, and that he has hitherto supported a good repute and credit; he proceeds, and states in his affidavit <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that by the false and scandalous publications concerning him, he has already experienced their injurious tenden∣cy, <HI>as</HI> a very eminent performer, whom he had retained in Great Britain to act at his Theatre in this City, did, from the false and scandalous publications against him, express <HI>a doubt</HI> of
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
his credit and punctuality, and that therefore <HI>a large</HI> and <HI>considerable</HI> sum must be paid in ad∣vance; and <HI>if it had not been</HI> for the interfer∣ence of some friends, <HI>he would have been de∣prived</HI> of the advantage of such performer."</Q></P>
<P>Now, what is the inference here?—he ad∣vanced nothing, and the actress came and ful∣filled her engagement:—take it, that he did ad∣vance—<HI>how much</HI>—and where is the magnitude of the injury, in advancing to a performer a sum, <HI>on account,</HI> if the manager ever intended to pay? and this is the <HI>only</HI> statement of an injury <HI>actually</HI> sustained.</P>
<P>The use of indefinite words in an affidavit, may be sometimes very convenient, but when injury is to be redressed in damages, and the party held to bail, the security should be proportioned to the probable redress; and the law requires some measure, whereby such security may be <HI>limited</HI> and not <HI>extended.</HI></P>
<P>The Plaintiff in this case feeling, perhaps, that a Fiat for 4000<HI>l.</HI> on the ground he has stated, and which I have followed, would be as ridicu∣lous as it is outrageous, adds, that he has chil∣dren, among whom are sour growing-up daugh∣ters,
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
who, in their <HI>future</HI> prospects in life, <HI>may</HI> receive considerable injury; and he then swears, that he has <HI>good reason</HI> to be <HI>convinced</HI> he <HI>has</HI> suf∣fered damages to the amount of FOUR THOU∣SAND POUNDS and upwards—how?—by an <HI>advance</HI> to a performer, and the injuries his family or himself <HI>may hereafter</HI> suffer. See, my Lords, the danger that might arise from any man carving the measure of his own redress, in estimating the value of the injury he has sustained; that which is but <HI>ideal</HI> will become <HI>real,</HI> and he will tell you he has <HI>good reason</HI> to be <HI>convinced:</HI> and I beseech your Lordships attention to this, because it illustrates the doctrine of the law (which I shall submit to you) with respect to <HI>bail</HI> in actions of <HI>defamation.</HI></P>
<P>The Plaintiff concludes his affidavit in stating, that John Magee (the Defendant) gives out that he is a man of <HI>very considerable property,</HI> as well in money as in several News Papers. Why this is introduced I cannot discover, it is introduced <HI>as true,</HI> and if true, it is a reason for a common appearance, because the Plaintiff himself alledges a sufficient responsibility in the Defendant whom he sues.</P>
<P>The Defendant, John Magee, has made an affidavit in aid of the present application, in which
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
he swears, that a writ issued in or as of last Trinity Term, to the Sheriffs of the City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> marked for the sum of 4000<HI>l.</HI> under authority of a Fiat granted by the Lord Chief Justice, and founded on an affidavit of Richard Daly the Plaintiff; that upon such writ he was arrested in <HI>June</HI> last; that in consequence of a number of vexatious suits and prosecutions against him, and in conse∣quence of the proceedings in this cause, and from the reiterated abuse he has received in the Free∣man's Journal, he is extremely injured in his credit, insomuch, that though he has used every effort in his power, <HI>he cannot now procure bail in this cause for the amount of the sum marked at the foot of said writ,</HI> or to any larger amount than 500<HI>l.</HI> and saith, he verily believes, that the Plaintiff hath not suffered damage in this cause to any amount whatsoever.</P>
<P>Your Lordships have now before you the facts or merits of the case, but I trust your Lordships will decide on a great question of public and of con∣stitutional importance, without any reference to the particular circumstances of the present case; I reject them as unnecessary, save only to the se∣cond part of the application, the <HI>reducement</HI> of the bail, which will also become unnecessary, if your Lordships shall be of opinion, that the De∣fendant
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
is not bound by law to give <HI>any security whatever.</HI></P>
<P>Then, my Lords, I with confidence assert, that <HI>a common appearance</HI> is all the law requires in actions of <HI>defamation,</HI> and to compel <HI>any secu∣rity</HI> to <HI>any amount</HI> is an <HI>extortion</HI> on the subject, and <HI>illegal.</HI></P>
<P>It is pleasing to observe in what great esteem the law holds <HI>personal freedom,</HI> justly considering the general liberty of the subject, as dependant on that of the individual; and so tender has the law been of this liberty, that no man could be deprived of his personal freedom, unless for some <HI>criminal, fla∣grant</HI> offence, injurious to the government under which he lived, or for some <HI>tortius</HI> act, commit∣ted with <HI>force,</HI> and consequently <HI>in breach of the peace,</HI> which his allegiance and duty required him to keep and preserve. It is thus well ex∣pressed in <HI>Crompton</HI>'s admirable introduction to a late very excellent compilation.</P>
<P>I grant that the legal requisition of bail, pro∣perly called Special Bail, is, and has been, for many years less confined; but then, it has been extended from <HI>necessity,</HI> and upon <HI>principle;</HI> as in DEBT,—what is the rule of law—if the debt <HI>abso∣lutely</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>
amounts to a sum <HI>certain,</HI> then the debtor may be held to <HI>special bail;</HI> but where the de∣mand is not <HI>absolute</HI> but <HI>uncertain,</HI> and sounds in damages—NOT SO:—And the principle, is;—the Plaintiff shall not be the <HI>judge</HI> of the injury he cannot <HI>ascertain,</HI> because it would make the Defendant the victim of the Plaintiff's <HI>conception.</HI></P>
<P>A Judge indeed may in several cases grant a Fiat, to hold a party to special bail, but in every case, it can only be where the demand is <HI>certain</HI> as IN DEBT, or where the injury is <HI>so outrageous,</HI> that damages must <HI>necessarily</HI> have been suffered; there the Judge has some <HI>measure,</HI> some <HI>guide;</HI> but even there he is bound to be <HI>moderate;</HI> for in the language of the Bill of Rights <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"excessive bail ought not to be required."</Q></P>
<P>And here, my Lords, I think I take the doc∣trine in its utmost latitude: In cases of DEFAMA∣TION or SLANDER (save only <HI>two</HI> exceptions which I shall mention,) a Judge is not warranted to grant a Fiat, for the Defendant shall be held only to <HI>common bail.</HI> As to SPECIAL BAIL, cases of defamation are excepted in every authority, from the oldest down to <HI>Crompton's</HI> late Digest on the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="17"/>
The first mention of Special Bail in slander was in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and that only in the case of <HI>slandering the title of lands;</HI> previous to that time, special bail was required in no case of <HI>personal</HI> slander: Afterwards special bail was ex∣tended to <HI>Scandalum Magnatum,</HI> and no further; so that the two exceptions evidently support the doctrine.</P>
<P>In <HI>Crompton</HI> 29, title BAIL, "in trespass, as∣sault, battery, conspiracy, false imprisonment, there shall be <HI>common bail</HI> only, <HI>unless on a motion or order made by the Court or a Judge:</HI> your Lord∣ships will observe, that this saving of motion, or order, applies only to <HI>such</HI> actions, in which, in the first instance, common bail is all the law re∣quires; and you will observe what follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"IN SLANDER common bail <HI>only,</HI> unless in slander of <HI>title,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> common or special in the dis∣cretion of the Court."</Q> This is laid down as the law in <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1654: and the authority adds, as the practice <HI>after</HI> that period, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>or unless spoken of a person of quality.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This complimentary concession was introduced, perhaps, considering peers as the hereditary legisla∣tors of the realm, the king's hereditary counsellors, and forming the Court of ultimate appeal and final jurisdiction; the welfare of the empire depend∣ing,
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
in a degree, on <HI>their</HI> good name and repu∣tation. So in <HI>Ray.</HI> 74—Earl of <HI>Stampford</HI> against <HI>Goodall,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in <HI>scandalum magnatum,</HI> the Plaintiff may have special bail on motion and order."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Chief Baron <HI>Comyn</HI> in his Digest Vol. I. Fol. 507, enumerates the cases where special bail, may be required; where the debt or damage in an action of debt, detinue, trespass, action upon the case (<HI>except in slander</HI>) amounts to 20<HI>l.</HI> SPECI∣AL BAIL, so where the damages are <HI>uncertain,</HI> the Judges in their discretion may grant special bail, as in battery, <HI>if it appears to be outrageous,</HI> in conspiracy, false imprisonment—<HI>in slander of title,</HI> or, <HI>scandalum magnatum.</HI> There in <HI>slander</HI> special bail is <HI>confined</HI> to the two instances; in the cases where special bail is allowed of <HI>right,</HI> it is founded on the <HI>certainty</HI> of the injury, where it arises from <HI>discretion,</HI> it is measured by the <HI>enor∣mity</HI> of the offence.</P>
<P>In 1 <HI>Blackstone</HI> 192, <HI>Smith</HI> against <HI>Frazer.</HI>—In trespass and assault, the Plaintiff made affidavit before <HI>Forster</HI> Justice, to hold the Defendant to bail; <HI>on the flagrant circumstances of which</HI> he di∣rected 200<HI>l.</HI> bail to be given.</P>
<P>My Lords, there is not any distinction taken with respect to <HI>bail,</HI> between slander written and
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
uttered; between defamation by <HI>libel</HI> or <HI>parole.</HI>—there is no variance, as to the doctrine to be found in the books, and the <HI>principle</HI> cannot be affected by the <HI>nature</HI> or <HI>class</HI> of the DEFAMATION.</P>
<P>1 <HI>Siderfin,</HI> 183, <HI>Chetwin</HI> against <HI>Skinner:</HI> it is there laid down, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in action sur le case pur parole <HI>ou outrement,</HI> NUL SPE BAIL."</Q></P>
<P>I call upon gentlemen to shew any distinction taken in any authority, between slander <HI>written</HI> and SLANDER <HI>spoken, with respect to the doctrine of bail,</HI> I know there are distinctions between <HI>libel</HI> and slander <HI>spoken;</HI> I know one has justly a greater degree of criminality annexed to it, than the other: but with regard to <HI>bail,</HI> I say, DEFA∣MATION is the general head, including every species of slander, written, painted, engraved, spoken, <HI>ou outrement,</HI> or otherwise.</P>
<P>My Lords, so tenacious is the law of personal liberty, and so tender have Judges been with re∣gard to it, that even in cases where the law re∣cognised, and allowed special bail, where even the ground of the application seemed fair and reasonable, Courts have refused to hold the sub∣ject to special bail, because the case <HI>might not</HI> ulti∣mately warrant it.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="20"/>
In 2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1157, <HI>Heathcot</HI> against <HI>Goslin.</HI>—The affidavit to hold to bail was, that the Defen∣dant borrowed 2000<HI>l.</HI> of the Plaintiff on bottom∣ree, <HI>which money is now due and owing</HI> to this De∣ponent, by virtue of the said bond, <HI>as thereby may appear</HI>—Objected, that this was no oath of the debt; for suppose every penny is paid, and a separate receipt taken, yet upon the face of the bond the whole will appear due, <HI>et per curiam;</HI> it is not sufficient; the Plaintiff would have made a <HI>supplemental</HI> affidavit, but the court refused to receive it; for the act of parliament requires a full oath, previous to the issuing the process, that Defendants may not be <HI>harased;</HI> and therefore in this case the Defendant was discharged upon <HI>com∣mon</HI> bail.</P>
<P>In the present case, Mr. <HI>Daly</HI> has made a <HI>subse∣quent</HI> affidavit; but such affidavit could be no ground for the arrest, for it was not <HI>in esse,</HI> when the Fiat was granted.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 975, <HI>Gammage</HI> against <HI>Watkin</HI>—The original debt was <HI>under</HI> the sum entitled to speci∣al bail; but the costs swelled it <HI>over;</HI> and the Plaintiff had judgment, on which he brought debt, and held the Defendant to bail; and now upon motion the court ordered <HI>common bail</HI> to be accepted; for as the original demand did not re∣quire
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
bail, the addition of costs will not alter the case.</P>
<P>And yet, my Lords, here, the costs and the original demand were liquidated, and in law became <HI>one debt;</HI> but the Court in its decision, guided by attention and attachment to personal li∣berty, made the distinction in its favour; and the like attention and attachment appear to govern in every case.</P>
<P>4 <HI>Burrow,</HI> 655, <HI>Pomp.</HI> vers. <HI>Ludrigson.</HI>—A rule for discharging the Defendant upon <HI>common</HI> bail was made absolute; the affidavit to hold him to <HI>special</HI> bail, <HI>not</HI> being <HI>possitive;</HI> which, it is the established rule of the court, <Q REND="inline">"that it <HI>must</HI> be."</Q> This was the case of a merchant in <HI>London,</HI> whose correspondent in <HI>Sweden</HI> had sent him over the accounts from <HI>Sweden, where the debt arose:</HI> and consequently the Plaintiff, the merchant in <HI>London,</HI> could only swear to his <HI>belief,</HI> with a <HI>re∣ference</HI> to the accounts sent to him from <HI>Sweden;</HI> the fact itself not being within his own personal knowledge: so that the affidavit could not have been more positive than it was, unless the corres∣pondent in <HI>Sweden</HI> could have come over to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> to swear it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="22"/>
2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1209, <HI>Rios</HI> vers. <HI>Relifante.</HI>—The affi∣davit to hold to <HI>special</HI> bail was made by a mer∣chant in <HI>London,</HI> swearing that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff 270<HI>l.</HI> as appears by an affidavit made by the Plaintiff in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which he, the Deponent, <HI>believes</HI> to be true, <HI>et per curi∣am;</HI> there can only be <HI>common</HI> bail; the oath abroad is no ground, and there is nothing but <HI>belief,</HI> which is not sufficient.</P>
<P>Your Lordships will observe, that these are <HI>commercial</HI> cases, and from the nature of com∣merce, and the situation of parties connected with it, similar cases may every day occur; yet we find no attempt at an argument founded on <HI>ne∣cessity</HI> or <HI>public benefit</HI> to extend the power of the Court.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1226, <HI>Claphamson</HI> vers. <HI>Bowman.</HI> The Plaintiff's BOOK-KEEPER, swore, that the De∣fendant was indebted to the Plaintiff in 3400<HI>l.</HI> for money had and received by the Defendant, to the use of the Plaintiff, <HI>as this Deponent verily believes;</HI> and the Court held it not sufficient to hold the Defendant to <HI>special</HI> bail.</P>
<P>This was the case of a <HI>book-keeper,</HI> swearing as fully as he conscientiously could; no merchant keeps his own books, because he cannot be a wit∣ness
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>
to prove any debt due to himself; his clerk who must be his witness, who should be privy to the dealing, and who keeps the account, can scarcely extend his oath, were he ever so correct beyond the best of his belief; yet, in such case, if the charge be not POSITIVE <HI>common</HI> bail only is allowed.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1219, <HI>Walrond</HI> vers. <HI>Fransham,</HI> an executrix in order to hold the Defendant to bail, made an affidavit, that he was indebted to her testator (so much) <HI>as appears by the books of the testator;</HI> and it was held insufficient and <HI>common</HI> bail ordered.</P>
<P>Here could have been no <HI>positive</HI> affidavit; the creditor was dead; the Plaintiff was an exe∣cutrix, and sued in such right; the office is highly favoured in law; the assets (of which credits may make a principal part) are com∣mitted for the best purposes; and among the first, the payment of the testator's debts: yet in this case, the case, I say, of an <HI>executrix,</HI> suing in the right of another, in whom no private or personal interest could be presumed, and laying before the Court the best foun∣dation in her power—<HI>common</HI> bail only.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="24"/>
Compare, my Lords, such cases with the present, and can you doubt; compare such af∣fidavits with that of Mr. Daly, whose <HI>present</HI> losses are the conjecture, surmise, apprehension and belief of <HI>future</HI> injuries.</P>
<P>The cases I have quoted are cases within the description, and reach of <HI>special</HI> bail; the case of Daly is that of <HI>defamation,</HI> entitled only, as I apprehend, to <HI>common</HI> bail; certain∣ly to no more, where no <HI>actual</HI> damage is sworn to have been suffered, certainly, not to the extent, which confines him <HI>before</HI> trial to an amount, which might be considered as exces∣sive in damages <HI>after</HI> verdict.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, laying aside the parties, and the particular circumstances of the case, what is the great and important question?—if the exten∣sive and extending conscience of a suitor, par∣tial to himself, in fancied injuries and imagi∣nary ills, can impose on the credulity of a Judge; if the Judge may, at his <HI>discretion,</HI> hold a sub∣ject in prison <HI>previous to trial,</HI> on terms with which he cannot comply; the <HI>discretion</HI> of the Judge may become the <HI>pleasure</HI> of the Man; where then will be the difference between FIAT and LETTER DE CACHET: if such be the practice, <HI>we are not safe;</HI> we have obtained
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
nothing by the glorious Revolution; we have no security in the great Charter, in the Bill of Rights, in the Habeas Corpus: the atchieve∣ments of liberty may decorate the monument of a former constitution, or be like standards taken from an enemy, hung up, old, torn and useless, save only to shew a degraded posterity, the virtue and valour of their ancestors.—No, my Lords, I trust, that a great and able Judge, will this day add a brighter glory to his name, his rank, and office, than any in the power of Majesty to confer, by nobly saying, what the best have said, and what none but the best will say, <HI>I have been wrong:</HI>—a generous and a grateful people will applaud, bless, record the expression, and honour even the error that caused it.</P>
