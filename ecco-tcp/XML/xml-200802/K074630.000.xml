<HEAD>To DR. BLACKLOCK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FOR thy amusement first I tuned the lay,</L>
<L>And dress'd my thoughts in <HI>Spenser</HI>'s antique stile,</L>
<L>'Twas but a frolic task, a youthful play,</L>
<L>Whose best reward was thy approving smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It scarcely claim'd th' offended Critic's rod,</L>
<L>We love to imitate what we admire;</L>
<L>The Persian thus adores the Solar God,</L>
<L>And lights, faint Emblem, his terrestrial fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer inexperienced I presume</L>
<L>On fancied worth, beneath the quaint disguise,</L>
<L>But strip the veil, remove th▪ incumbent gloom,</L>
<L>And modern numbers give to modern eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still to thee I dedicate the song,</L>
<L>Language may change, our friendship cannot fade,</L>
<L>To thee all Virtue's winning charms belong,</L>
<L>Nor is my soul of fickle substance made.</L>

<HEAD>The LAND of the MUSES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MAY we unblamed in these fastidious times</L>
<L>Retreat to <HI>Spenser</HI>'s allegoric rhimes?</L>
<L>His venturous step thro' fairy bowers pursue,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Alma</HI>'s castled dome appears in view?</L>
<L>There see, advancing on th' embattled plain,</L>
<L><HI>Guyon</HI> and <HI>Arthur</HI> of heroic strain?</L>
<L>Their martial grace, their valiant deeds admire,</L>
<L>Unwearied arms, and unextinguish'd fire;</L>
<L>When the base Squadrons who besieged her rouud,</L>
<L>They forced to quit the field, and shun the sacred ground?</L>
<L>Then view brave <HI>Guyon</HI> with intrepid heart</L>
<L>Against th' enchanted bower of bliss depart;</L>
<L>While by his presence check'd, the sensual croud</L>
<L>Led by <HI>Malaeger,</HI> confident and proud</L>
<L>Again invest the walls? See <HI>Arthur</HI> ride</L>
<L>Indignant forth, and (as Antaeus died</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
By Hercules of yore) the Chief inclasp,</L>
<L>Who breathed his last within his nervous grasp;</L>
<L>Yet, tho' renown's all-envied prize He won,</L>
<L>Espy from many a gash the crimson current run?</L>
<L>"There view the Grooms and Squires with tender speed,</L>
<L>"Respectful take Him from his foaming steed;</L>
<L>"And fairest <HI>Alma</HI> costly spice prepare,</L>
<L>"And wine and balm t' administer with care,</L>
<L>"Eager her lively gratitude t' express,</L>
<L>"And aid her Champion in his deep distress;</L>
<L>"Then of his armour gently disarray'd,</L>
<L>"On richest Sopha cause him to be laid,</L>
<L>"And while his wounds they gird with circling band,</L>
<L>"Close by his side behold the Virgin stand."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah Fools, who think that <HI>Temperance</HI> will refuse</L>
<L>Enjoyments sweet, the soul's refreshing dews,</L>
<L>To Human-kind! or frowningly survey</L>
<L>Their feet proceed in Pleasure's roseate way,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
See them recline beneath her myrtle bowers▪</L>
<L>Inhale the balmy air, and pluck th' innocuous flowers.</L>
<L>Liberal, and candid, all delights She loves,</L>
<L>Which Taste desires, and Elegance approves;</L>
<L>Fosters each genuine bliss to reason dear,</L>
<L>But hates impetuous passion's mad career.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now while <HI>the Prince</HI> nigh heal'd by <HI>Alma</HI>'s skill,</L>
<L>Felt health begin each languid vein to fill,</L>
<L>Exhausted erst, when in her cause he fought,</L>
<L>And with his blood the well-earn'd triumph bought,</L>
<L>As well She knew the body and the mind</L>
<L>In weal and woe essentially combin'd,</L>
<L>United each to each with strictest ties,</L>
<L>She bent her thought his mind to harmonize.</L>
<L>So to his ear, close-seated by his side,</L>
<L>In accents duly couch'd her speech applied;</L>
<L>At times of chivalry, war's purest flame,</L>
<L>And hardy Knights, who scorning abject shame,</L>
<L>Trampled on death to gain immortal fame.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Then, as the Powers of Virtue listening stood,</L>
<L>Of conscious worth She spake, and mental good,</L>
<L>And peace, and civic merit laurel-crown'd,</L>
<L>While He was ravish'd by the soothing sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Her two <HI>Nymphs</HI> ministrant, came prepared,</L>
<L>And when She paused, the grateful labour shared.</L>
<L>For ever and anon would <HI>Praise-Desire</HI></L>
<L>Open her ruby lips, attune her lyre,</L>
<L>And sing her pensive notes; the powerful strain</L>
<L>Charm'd the sensation of internal pain,</L>
<L>Infused serenest stedfastness, and brought</L>
<L>To justest temper each rebellious thought.</L>
<L>It seem'd as if an Angel from above,</L>
<L>Melodious glided on the wings of love,</L>
<L>Such silver tones th' enamour'd gales prolong,</L>
<L>Her flowing measures such, and blandishment of song.</L>
<L>And often Virgin <HI>Bashfulness</HI> assay'd</L>
<L>The melting lute, and sweetest descants play'd:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
For She her instrument could aptly guide,</L>
<L>Nor wanted in well-doing comely pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Prince</HI>'s bosom secret pleasure fills,</L>
<L>And every nerve the love of glory thrills;</L>
<L>His spirit seizes her celestial meed,</L>
<L>He meditates th' unutterable deed:</L>
<L>Rapt, and beyond expression moved, He sighs,</L>
<L>The living fire darts ardent from his eyes,</L>
<L>And drench'd in bliss unknown to vulgar soul He lies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One evening as these <HI>Four</HI> excursive tread</L>
<L>Where that majestic stream is seen to spread</L>
<L>Whence <HI>Guyon</HI> launch'd, the country far and wide</L>
<L>Profusely watering with exhaustless tide,</L>
<L><HI>Arthur</HI> beholds the farther coast, it's hills</L>
<L>Ascending steep, it's vales, meandring rills,</L>
<L>Woods whose thick boughs a solemn shade diffuse,</L>
<L>And lawns which now declining Phoebus views,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Beaming the last remains of golden day,</L>
<L>Then curious ask'd what region yonder lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That is the <HI>Land,</HI> replied th' ingenuous Fair,</L>
<L><HI>Apollo</HI>'s and the <HI>Muses'</HI> favourite care;</L>
<L>On which their blessings they benignly shower</L>
<L>E'en to excess: there in immortal bower,</L>
<L>Close by the fount of Hippocrene divine,</L>
<L>Th' unfading wreathe of harmony entwine;</L>
<L>There, all their choral extasies repeat,</L>
<L>Far from the world there fix their happy seat,</L>
<L>And scorn its vulgar herd, and tasteless Great.</L>
<L>There too is heart-felt <HI>Joy</HI> with aspect bright,</L>
<L>And Pain is banish'd thence, and Grief is put to flight.</L>
<L>There too a thousand beauteous Forms reside,</L>
<L>To which in habit or in shape allied</L>
<L>In other place the eye can never find,</L>
<L>Beings invisible to common mind:</L>
<L>Of purest nature, and ethereal race,</L>
<L>Girded with zones by every Sister Grace;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
For there the <HI>Graces</HI> shed their choicest rays,</L>
<L>While <HI>Liberty</HI> with smiles before them plays,</L>
<L>And clad in robes of white each spotless <HI>Virtue</HI> strays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May not, rejoin'd the <HI>Prince,</HI> a Stranger sue</L>
<L>Those scenes thy lively words describe to view?</L>
<L>What bliss to travel thro that region fair!</L>
<L>What bliss to mingle with the Natives rare!</L>
<L>Nor speak I urged by boastful folly vain,</L>
<L>Yet in my heart is no illiberal stain;</L>
<L>Honour hath poured her influence on my mind,</L>
<L>And cherish'd passions generous and refin'd;</L>
<L>Say, whom must I invoke that purer mould</L>
<L>To tread? those Forms Ethereal to behold?</L>
<L>No base Intruder, no malicious Spy,</L>
<L>Seeking their hidden mysteries to defery.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Alma</HI> smiled, and smiled th' attendant <HI>Twain;</HI></L>
<L>O <HI>Briton Prince,</HI> She said, that blest domain</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
To me by young Apollo's self is given</L>
<L>Freely t'enjoy; to me that earthly Heaven</L>
<L>He grants to range: from Him the power is mine;</L>
<L>All lawless wanderers from the sacred Nine</L>
<L>To keep by force, <HI>Riot</HI>'s wild crew to quell,</L>
<L>And all the Sons of insolence repell;</L>
<L>But ever modest merit to befriend,</L>
<L>Direct his steps, and my assistance lend.</L>
<L>But darkness now protrudes her shadowy cone,</L>
<L>The fields are trod by wakeful man alone.</L>
<L>Take we our frugal meal, and then to rest;</L>
<L>The Beasts their couch, the Birds have sought their nest;</L>
<L>All but the Beast of prey, with ruthless mind</L>
<L>Threatening sell slaughter to the helpless kind:</L>
<L>And Philomel, whose conscious measures flow,</L>
<L>Feeding th' unsated luxury of woe,</L>
<L>Now passionately full, now soft, and dying low.</L>
<L>Tomorrow when the Eastern clouds display</L>
<L>Their lucid pomp, and crimson banners gay,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
At my request a bark shall waft us o'er</L>
<L>Th' expanded stream, to yon sequester'd shore,</L>
<L>The prospects which await us there, to paint</L>
<L>Art cannot reach, all language would be faint.</L>
<L>In courtly phrase the <HI>Prince</HI> his thanks exprest,</L>
<L>For every polisht grace adorn'd his breast;</L>
<L>His eyelids, light and transient slumbers close,</L>
<L>And in the morn with Heaven's first beam He rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His gentle <HI>Guide</HI> not unprepared He found,</L>
<L>For when the Lark soar'd upward from the ground,</L>
<L>With joy She heard his sweetly-warbled strain,</L>
<L>And brake the silken bands of sleep in twain.</L>
<L>Then o'er the humid lawns they took their way,</L>
<L>(The dew-drops glittering with the orient ray)</L>
<L>And to the River's verdant margin sped,</L>
<L>Where lay th' expecting bark with sail unspread,</L>
<L>The Pilot at the helm, of aspect mild,</L>
<L>And bland, yet piercing eye, <HI>Good-Culture</HI> stiled.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
The <HI>Knight</HI> and <HI>Lady</HI> He with transport warm</L>
<L>Received; then push'd far off with nervous arm,</L>
<L>Unfurl▪d his sail, which gales propitious swell'd,</L>
<L>And o'er the waves his easy course impell'd.</L>
<L>The sparkling waves like lucid chrystal gleam,</L>
<L>Or like unclouded Titan's radiant beam;</L>
<L>For not the smallest stain or spot they know,</L>
<L>Tho deep the tide, the sands were seen below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When they approach'd that shore's extremest bound,</L>
<L>With Spring's eternal cestus girt around,</L>
<L>Ambrosial airs mild-breath'd their senses greet,</L>
<L>Diffusing odours exquisitely sweet:</L>
<L>For <HI>Zephyr</HI> there his softest plumes indued,</L>
<L>And chid each devious blast of pinions rude,</L>
<L>While <HI>Flora</HI> hung with living gems the bowers,</L>
<L>And deck'd the turf with never-fading flowers,</L>
<L>Blossoms and flowers of every various hue</L>
<L>Which once in Eden's happy garden grew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<L>Now at the Coast arrived, they land with speed,</L>
<L>And now along the lilied banks proceed,</L>
<L>Viewing in silence with attentive eye</L>
<L>The scenes romantic which before them lye.</L>
<L>The <HI>Prince</HI> at every turn to wonder yields,</L>
<L>At every turn new beauties crown the fields;</L>
<L>Upon his cheeks a warmer glow is spread,</L>
<L>His bosom throbs with awe and pleasing dread,</L>
<L>Such prospect, frailer mortals scarce could bear,</L>
<L>He gazed, and wish'd to gaze forever there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His mild <HI>Conductress</HI> bade him now behold</L>
<L>Where crossing o'er the velvet-shaded mould</L>
<L>Two of the gentle Habitants advance;</L>
<L>He sees, and quits his visionary trance.</L>
<L>Their eyes the glittering beams of pleasure dart,</L>
<L>Their smooth brows speak their gayety of heart,</L>
<L>Their virid garlands wanton'd in the wind,</L>
<L>Their nimble feet moved on as chance inclined,</L>
<L>And treading the soft turf, no pressure left behind.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
The one was <HI>Youthful Prime,</HI> of comely grace,</L>
<L>The rising down began to shade his face,</L>
<L>Unchanged by years. The other was his Bride,</L>
<L><HI>Hygeia</HI> She, of firm affection tried,</L>
<L>From whom a Son paced smiling by his side.</L>
<L>Her presence every thought of time exiled,</L>
<L>So well each hour her converse sweet beguiled.</L>
<L>That tender Imp whose smiles proclaim'd his joy,</L>
<L>He named <HI>Content;</HI> to whom tho yet a Boy</L>
<L>Is given exclusive power and wondrous might;</L>
<L>For ease of mind and spirits dancing light</L>
<L>All those inspire, on whom He casts his sight.</L>
<L>The blooming Dame sustain'd an Infant Child,</L>
<L><HI>Simplicity</HI> by both his Parents stiled,</L>
<L>Well-favour'd, and of lovely hue to see,</L>
<L>Stretching his little arms, and telling his tale free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To whom with bland demeanor <HI>Alma</HI> said;</L>
<L>Where widely your enchanted feet have stray'd</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Among the mazes of this flowery green,</L>
<L>Tell me, ye gentle Pair, if ye have seen</L>
<L>Where <HI>Fancy</HI> now resides? for like the wind</L>
<L>I know the sudden shiftings of her mind,</L>
<L>No certain spot She loves, but varies soon,</L>
<L>Now the deep shade allures, and now the blaze of noon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Her with swift-wing'd accents <HI>Youth</HI> replied,</L>
<L>The Nymph ye seek, fair Dame, I lately spied</L>
<L>In yonder glen, which craggy rocks surround,</L>
<L>Whence bursts a torrent forth with roaring sound.</L>
<L>Then bending decent, with respectful eye,</L>
<L>He and his loved Copartner hasted by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <HI>Alma</HI> with the <HI>Prince</HI> right onward fared,</L>
<L>Who ask'd her why to <HI>Fancy</HI> She repair'd?</L>
<L>Without her aid (said She) I want the power</L>
<L>To guide thee, as behoves, a single hour.</L>
<L>Besides her skill hath raised a Building high,</L>
<L>Which yonder view, aspiring to the sky;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
From whence is seen distinctly, rock, and plain,</L>
<L>And dell, and grot, and stream, and woodland reign,</L>
<L>Each goodly object, all the living race,</L>
<L>Which breathe and move, and these dominions grace.</L>
<L>To which if thee, O <HI>Prince,</HI> She will convey,</L>
<L>What else would take up many a tedious day,</L>
<L>And many a night in vigils to behold,</L>
<L>In portion small of time She can unfold.</L>
<L>Nor should we haply else succeed at last,</L>
<L>But after much sojourn, and labour vast,</L>
<L>Some thorny glade our tangled feet might chain,</L>
<L>Some wilderness mislead, or sandy plain:</L>
<L>Or we might sink beneath some foaming bourn,</L>
<L>Or to the place we left unsped return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, where they sought, the <HI>Maid Divine</HI> they scann'd,</L>
<L>Upon a craggy cliff She took her stand;</L>
<L>Forming a gloomy shade, above her head</L>
<L>A lofty pine it's ample branches spread.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Downward on either side, with rapid force,</L>
<L>From rock to rock a strong stream bent it's course;</L>
<L>Precipitate the dashing currents flow,</L>
<L>And mingle in one boiling gulph below.</L>
<L>She stood enraptured o'er the whirling bay,</L>
<L>And bathed her forehead in the floating spray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Conscious of stranger feet her eyes She rear'd,</L>
<L>Which as th' effulgent sun-beam bright appear'd,</L>
<L>And quicker than the quivering lightning glanced;</L>
<L>Then t'ward them strait with airy feet advanced.</L>
<L>In prodigal abundance, uncontroul'd,</L>
<L>Wide waved her burnisht locks of tendrill'd gold▪</L>
<L>Brede, or incircling band they never knew,</L>
<L>When most dishevell'd, comeliest to the view.</L>
<L>In thin habiliment her limbs were drest;</L>
<L>A curious robe depended from her vest,</L>
<L>Of fleecy clouds and gossimer intwined,</L>
<L>Which on the bosom of the dalliant wind</L>
<L>It's folds sustaining, sported far behind;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
Adorn'd with tints of every various die</L>
<L>Which in Heaven's glorious bow attract the eye:</L>
<L>And every blended hue which e'er was traced,</L>
<L>In complicated beauty there was placed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft in that vale retired She sate alone,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Nature</HI> wildly stray'd, to <HI>Art</HI> unknown.</L>
<L>But circumscribed by no determined bound,</L>
<L>Free and at large She ranged Creation round.</L>
<L>Or thro the brazen gyre would urge her way,</L>
<L>With cheek unblanch'd, and heart without dismay,</L>
<L>The din of <HI>Chaos</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> hear,</L>
<L>Nor all the bickering elements would fear.</L>
<L>There, if She wills, the cold abyss She warms;</L>
<L>New worlds, and peopled with unnumber'd swarms</L>
<L>She bids arise; her palace strait they mould,</L>
<L>She mounts her throne, extends her scepter'd gold,</L>
<L>While thronging round, her ready subjects stand,</L>
<L>Or stoop submiss, and wait her high command:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Then in a moment, such her varying soul,</L>
<L>On ruin bent, annihilates the whole;</L>
<L>Assists confusion, multiplies the jar,</L>
<L>Heightens the tumult, and augments the war.</L>
<L>For She alone, most wondrous to relate,</L>
<L>Except <HI>Heaven's Sire,</HI> is unrestrain'd by <HI>Fate.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft to th' empyreal Dome, with boldest gaze</L>
<L>Striving to pierce th' impenetrable blaze,</L>
<L>She speeds her course, where mid the depth profound</L>
<L>Of strong refulgent glory floating round,</L>
<L>Sits the mysterious <HI>Godhead,</HI> in his reign</L>
<L>Of trinal unity. But all in vain</L>
<L>She strives to pass that inexpressive light;</L>
<L><HI>Heaven</HI>'s <HI>Sire</HI> alone escapes her thrillant sight.</L>
<L>Yet She could bring (so potent was her sway)</L>
<L><HI>Cherubs</HI> and <HI>Seraphs</HI> from the realms of day;</L>
<L>While, gently hovering round, <HI>Angelic Quires</HI></L>
<L>Tuned at her will their golden-stringed lyres.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Or spite of <HI>Pluto</HI>'s horrid flames, would dare</L>
<L>To cleave the earth, and rouse to upper air</L>
<L>The <HI>Furies</HI> with their whips of iron dread,</L>
<L>The snakes loud hissing on each ghastly head;</L>
<L>With Them, would <HI>Hecate</HI> reluctant stand,</L>
<L>Her cypress wreathe display, and wield her sparkling brand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then would arise, on pitchy pinions borne,</L>
<L>Stern-look'd <HI>Revenge; Hate</HI> by wild frenzy torn,</L>
<L>And each tremendous <HI>Pest</HI> which shuns the light,</L>
<L>And every <HI>Child</HI> abhorr'd of ugly <HI>Night.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lust</HI> fierce and restless, <HI>Jealousy</HI> worn blind,</L>
<L><HI>Murther,</HI> whose features shock the generous mind,</L>
<L>And pining <HI>Care,</HI> which in thick gloomy clouds</L>
<L>The half-slain wretch, while yet alive, inshrouds.</L>
<L>And <HI>Woe,</HI> by inches destined to consume,</L>
<L>Hanging, with face all pale, o'er her dead Lover's tomb.</L>
<L>And She would call th' unbodied <HI>Ghosts</HI> around,</L>
<L>Uttering their dolorous wail with shrieking sound;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
And <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> mumbling forth her rites, might make</L>
<L>The stoutest tremble, and the firmest quake.</L>
<L>And <HI>Conscious Fear,</HI> who steals with secret stride,</L>
<L>Keeping close watch th' Assassin's bed beside;</L>
<L>And when <HI>Sleep,</HI> long invoked, begins to seal</L>
<L>His wearied lids, unfold the poppied veil,</L>
<L>And his tormenting thoughts awhile controul,</L>
<L>Rings her alarum wild, and rends his guilty soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet were no frowns, or sternness in her face;</L>
<L>But amiable, and clad with native grace,</L>
<L>Her blushing cheeks confess'd a modest die,</L>
<L>Blending with softness, virgin majesty.</L>
<L>Love ever view'd her in respect array'd;</L>
<L>Enchanting smiles o'er all her features play'd;</L>
<L>Her azure veins in winding mazes flow'd,</L>
<L>The snow above with living lustre glow'd.</L>
<L>So, deckt with radiance, deckt with beauty's beams,</L>
<L>The Eldest Daughter of the <HI>Morn</HI> She seems.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
<L>While cordial joy her winning looks express'd,</L>
<L>To <HI>Alma</HI> thus her speech She first address'd:</L>
<L>Welcome, fair Maid, to this secluded place!</L>

<HEAD>ELEGY from SPENSER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first before my youthful eyes,</L>
<L>I saw the form of Damon move,</L>
<L>I gazed upon him with suprise,</L>
<L>But not one thought had I of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My soul grew fond of fancies vain,</L>
<L>Tetchy and froward, nought could please;</L>
<L>Yet knew I not what gave me pain,</L>
<L>Nor thought it love, but some disease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the beauty of the sky</L>
<L>Night had defaced with pallid hue,</L>
<L>Striving to sleep I down should lie,</L>
<L>But sleep away far from me flew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Instead thereof sad sighs and fears</L>
<L>About me cruel watch maintain'd,</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="97"/>
Forth gush'd th' involuntary tears,</L>
<L>And Sorrow then triumphant reign'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any drop of slumb'ring rest</L>
<L>Into my weary soul distill'd,</L>
<L>What frightful dreams would then infest!</L>
<L>What horror through my bosom thrill'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then up I from my bed should start,</L>
<L>And all my former grief renew,</L>
<L>Think on that image in my heart,</L>
<L>And all its heavenly charms review.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All night a stranger to repose,</L>
<L>To ease a stranger all the day,</L>
<L>No sports, no company I chose,</L>
<L>To Solitude a willing prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus cared I not abroad to spread</L>
<L>Youth's plant, when in its fairest prime,</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="98"/>
But let it all neglected, shed</L>
<L>Both fruit and flower before its time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas, should this be love, I cried!</L>
<L>Too late the fatal cause I found,</L>
<L>In vain each lenient art I tried,</L>
<L>Too deep had pierced the rankling wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor other cure had I for grief,</L>
<L>But my hard fortune to deplore,</L>
<L>To languish like the fallen leaf,</L>
<L>And feed with plaints th' impoison'd sore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus t'ward the silent grave I paced,</L>

<L>THE strains of young Amyntas, when disease</L>
<L>Prey'd on his frame, and hopeless of relief</L>
<L>With anxious soul He struck the solemn lyre,</L>
<L>I give to those, whose feelings, like his own,</L>
<L>Unwarp'd by dissipation, or the touch</L>

<L>To genuine pity: who like him retired</L>
<L>Far from the world, but not with him condemn'd</L>
<L>To share the bitter cup, still love the tones</L>
<L>Pleasingly sad, which Nature prompts to flow,</L>
<L>Nor selfish from affliction turn their eye,</L>
<L>Nor scorn th' impassion'd Muse's hallow'd lay.</L>

<HEAD>The DEATH-SONG OF RAGNAR LODBRACH, King of DENMARK.</HEAD>
<P>RAGNAR LODBRACH flourished in the ninth century, and by his piratical expeditions (according to the custom of his countrymen) rendered himself the terror of the northern parts of Europe. After having carried on his depredations with success for many years, he was at length taken pri∣soner by Ella, King of Northumberland, whose coasts He had invaded, and put to death by Him, being (as was reported) cast into a dungeon full of serpents. His melan∣choly

fate stimulated his Son Ivar to avenge it; and on this occasion the famous standard of the Raven is said to have been embroidered by his Sisters, and consecrated with such magic rites as insured victory to those before whom it was borne. Under this standard Ivar made a descent on the territories of Ella, fought with, vanquished, and put Him to death in his turn.</P>
<P>The following Poem, if we may credit tradition, was composed by Ragnar, in his horrid place of confinement. It is apparent however that it must have been the work of some Scald or Bard, probably to do honour to to the memory of his deceased King, to place before the eyes of his subjects his heroic atchievements, and urge them, and his Son (or Sons according to the Poem itself) to revenge.</P>

<HEAD>The DEATH SONG OF RAGNAR LODBRACH.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>WITH our sword's resistless might</L>
<L>We have thinn'd the ranks of fight.</L>
<L>In early life, his volumed train</L>
<L>The crested serpent roll'd in vain.</L>
<L>Thora's charms the matchless prize;</L>
<L>Gothland saw my fame arise.</L>
<L>Thronging crouds the monster scan,</L>
<L>Shouts applausive hail me Man.</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="146"/>
All his fierceness prompt to try,</L>
<L>The shaggy vestment cloath'd my thigh;</L>
<L>Soon transpierced, in death he lay,</L>
<L>My falchion smote for splendid pay. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From this first exploit (as the story goes) Ragnar obtained his sirname of Lodbrach, i. e. rough, or hairy breeches. For the King of Got<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land having promised his daughter Thora to the man who should kill a vast serpent which wasted the country, Ragnar undertook the enterprize; and dressing himself in the skins of beasts, with the hairy side outermost, throw water over them, the cold, to which He purposely exposed himself, forming round him a suit (as it were) of frozen armour. He met the serpent, whose teeth had no effect on this impenetrable mail, fixed him to the ground with his spear, and ripping him up with his sword, tore out his heart. After the victory the King presented him his daughter, and on account of his rough dress, gave him the name above mentioned, by which he was from that time distinguished.</P>
<P>Olaus Magnus relates this adventure, but says He fought with and killed two snakes. That the King had taken them when young, and bred them up as a guard for his daughter; but as they increased in size, they became a public terror, and poisoned the country.</P>
<P>Such is the fabulous beginning attributed by Bards and Historians to the actions of Ragnar Lodbrach. His subsequent adventures seem however better founded, and carry no marks of sable, till we come to the last scene, when the manner of his death is as wonderful and incredible as his first appearance.</P></NOTE></L>
