<P><HI>THE</HI> WIVES REVENGED; A <HI>COMIC OPERA,</HI> IN ONE ACT. As it is performed at the <HI>THEATRE-ROYAL</HI> IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act, which are generally characterized, either by their natural simplicity, or some single striking incident, and little or nothing more is designed.—It is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the English theatre, as containing excellent situations for light airs.—On the French stage, notwithstanding all their merit, they tire in the length of time taken for representation; and, were they spun out to the common length of our after∣pieces, it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient.</P>
<P>The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved, and the dialogue both varied and compressed, they are, with every deference sub∣mitted to public judgment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Ver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, the best thing you can do, is to beg pardon of your wives, to whom I'll be an advocate for you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tok.</SPEAKER>
<P>To shew you what good creatures we are, they have their pardon, even before they ask it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generously done—and now let us sit down, and forget all animosities over a bottle of the Alderman's Tokay.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. TOKAY.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twixt husband and wife, there's an end of all quar∣rels,</L>
<L>The battle is fought, and the victory is ours;</L>
<L>The wives have the day, and a forest of laurels,</L>
<L>Like Cap's alamode, on our temples now towers.</L>
<L>Yet tho' we return from the field so victorious,</L>
<L>Where courage resides—always pity should live,</L>
<L>And warriors to still make their conquests more glorious,</L>
<L>The enemy vanquish'd, forget and give.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DIMITY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Henceforth I return to my former obedience,</L>
<L>Which, alone, in a wife, real kindness secures;</L>
<L>I acknowledge, and take on't the oaths of allegiance,</L>
<L>You'll reign King of my heart, while I'm Queen of your's.</L>
<L>Many wives tho' had paid you in kind, thus induced to't.</L>
<L>Taking care, every hour, a fine life you should live;</L>
<L>With bick'ring and taunts—but 'tis o'er, and a truce to't,</L>
<L>What ever is past, I'll forget and forgive.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. VERMILION.</SPEAKER>
<L>And now, if so far, you have heard us thus hector,</L>
<L>'Twas only, believe me, that each play'd her part▪</L>
<L>For our fear, lest the critics should read us a lecture,</L>
<L>Is a certain conviction we're women at heart.</L>
<L>Tho' our husbands we've tam'd, for the Piece we've our terrors,</L>
<L>Let what merits you find, in your memory live,</L>
<L>Nay, let kindness augment them—but as for our errors▪</L>
<L>We humbly intreat you, forget and forgive.</L>
