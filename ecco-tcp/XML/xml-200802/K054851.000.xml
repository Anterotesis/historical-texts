<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE pious Designs, and the magnificent Works, of our Ancestors are Themes, on which every Reader of a liberal Curiosity receives Information with Plea∣sure. But the following Work is more immediately calculated for the peculiar Convenience of the Traveller; and is principally designed as a <HI>local Guide</HI> to Strangers, who may be tempted to visit the curious and entertaining Particulars which it professes to de∣scribe and illustrate.</P>
<P>For the Satisfaction of the Reader it may be necessary still further to premise, that our Account is compiled from the best private Information, from an attentive Examination on the Spot, and from a Variety of Ma∣terials relating to the Subject, incidentally dispersed in different Books, which have been carefully collected, and succinctly digested. To reader our Detail still more complete and authentic, we have consulted two Folio Volumes written on Vellum, belonging to the Cathedral Church of <HI>Winchester,</HI> containing the Acts of the Pontificate of <HI>William of Wykeham,</HI> whose Bene∣factions make so conspicuous a Figure in the History of <HI>Winchester.</HI> It is called <HI>Registrum Wykeham,</HI> and begins with the Year <HI>mccclxvii.</HI> But our principal

<HEAD>THE CITY.</HEAD>
<P>WINCHESTER appears to have been a City of considerable Note among the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> by whom it was called <HI>Caer Guen,</HI> or the <HI>White City,</HI> from its Situation upon a chalky Soil. Many reputable Historians report, that it was founded by <HI>Ludor Rous Hudibras,</HI> 892 Years before the Birth of Christ. It afterwards became a Roman Station, and probably one of their Cities, as appears from the Discovery of a Pavement of Brick, and Coins of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, found in digging the Foundat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of the Royal Palace of <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>Camden</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But. p. 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ed. Cib.</NOTE> tells us, that during the
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Saxon Heptarchy the <HI>West Saxon</HI> Kings resided in this City; who adorned it with magnificent Churches, and an Episcopal See. King <HI>Ethelstan</HI> established here six Mints for the Coinage of Money. The <HI>Dome-boc</HI> of <HI>Alfred</HI> was reposited in the Cathedral of this City, thence called <HI>Codex Wintoniensis;</HI> as was afterwards the pre∣sent <HI>Domesday</HI> book of the <HI>Conqueror</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Kennet's Paroch. Ant. pag. 63.</NOTE>. From its first Foundation to the last mentioned Period, it was three Times destroyed by Fire. In the Civil Wars between King <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress, this Place was almost totally desolated; but the Misfortune was amply repaired by <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> III. who fixed here a Staple<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Leland acquaints us, that the Staple Houses <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"lay from the West Gate in a back Way to the North Gate."</Q> Itiner. vol. iii. pag. 86, ed. 2.</P></NOTE> for Wool, and Woollen Manufactures<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Camden, ubi supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is said to have been first fortified with Walls by <HI>Guidorius,</HI> Anno Dom. 179. The present Walls are reported to have been erected by <HI>Mo∣leutius Dunwallo,</HI> Anno Dom. 341. On the South and East Sides, for some Distance, they remain entire, and many Fragments of them are continued to a considerable Extent on the North and West, particularly to the Westward, on which is to be seen a Bastion, called the <HI>Hermit's Tower.</HI> Their Circumference is one Mile and
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
an Half. There were formerly six City Gates, the four principal of which still subsist, as does one of the Posterns called the <HI>King's Gate</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland says that St. Michael's Gate is spoken of by an∣tient Writers, and conjectures that <HI>King's Gate</HI> was sometimes so called, on account of St. Michael's Church standing near it. Itinerar. vol. iii. pag. 86.</NOTE>; the sixth Gate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leland, ut supra, pag. 87. says it was called <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rne-gate,</HI> and that it led to a small Suburb.</NOTE>, which stood between the North and East Gate, is utterly destroyed. On the West, and on Part of the North and South Sides, is a Foss of prodigious Breadth and Depth, but to the Meadows, which were easily floated by the Ri∣ver, such a Defence was thought unnecessary. The vacant Spaces within the Walls, now formed into Gardens, demonstrate that the Town has been greatly depopulated.</P>
<P>Near the West Gate we survey the Ruins of a strong and stately Castle, which according to Tradition was built by King <HI>Arthur</HI> Anno Dom. 523; and was a Place of remarkable Defence in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> against whose At∣tacks it was bravely maintained by <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress for a considerable Time. By a Plan of it drawn Anno Dom. 1630, it appears to have been a quadrangular Structure, with a Tower at each Angle: And by a small Sketch in <HI>Speed,</HI> Anno Dom. 1614, we discover, that the En∣trance from the West was over a Bridge thrown
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
across the Western Foss, leading to a Gate-way contiguous to the South West Angle of the Building. It appears by the same Sketch, to have had some Outworks, with Towers, to the South. <HI>Heylin</HI> inform us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was a gal∣lant, but not great Castle, bravely mounted on a Hill, for Defence, and Prospect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cosmograph. pag. 312. edit. 1666.</NOTE>."</Q> The West <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and many of our Princes after the Conquest, resided in this Castle, some of whom were born, and others crowned <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">William Rufus was crowned here every Christmas. Angl. sacr. vol. i. pag. 259. Our Kings often kept their Christmas and Easter here.</NOTE> here. In later <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It appears to have been in the Crown in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, who allows 6<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> to the Constable of Winchester Castle. Peck's Desid.

During the Troubles the King had seized and garrisoned this Fortress; from whose Forces it was afterwards taken by Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> its original Owner, who was one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Generals. The Chapel of the Castle, which was, as at present, originally a detached Building, is still entire, and is a mag∣nificent Edifice, consisting of three Iles, 110 Feet in Length and 55 in Breadth. In this Chapel a famous Cause concerning the Superiority of
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
the See of <HI>Canterbury</HI> over that of <HI>York</HI> was tried Anno Dom. 1072, before <HI>Hubert</HI> the Pope's Legate, King <HI>William,</HI> and all the Bishops and Abbots in <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Angl. Sacr. vol. ii. pag. 635.</NOTE>. A Chantry formerly belonged to this Chape, as appears by its Dissolution at the Reformation<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Willis's Mitr. Abb. vol. ii. p. 209. a Pension of 6<HI>l.</HI> is allowed to Nicholas Hill, late Incumbent, Anno Dom. 1553.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Assizes for the County of <HI>Hants</HI> were ori∣ginally kept in this Castle; at least as early as the Year 1272, as we learn from the <HI>Winchester</HI> An∣nalist, who frequently remarks that the Royal Fa∣mily quitted their Residence at this Place to make Room for the Judges; but at present the Chapel, of which I have been just speaking, is appropriated to this Purpose. At the End hangs what is com∣monly called King <HI>Arthur's Round Table,</HI> which is 18 Feet in Diameter. It would be needless to multiply Authorities for a Proof that this Table is of modern Date. However it is of higher Antiquity than it is commonly supposed to be: For <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript, Region.</NOTE>, who wrote above two hundred Years ago, relates, that it was shewn to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. and that at that Time many Marks of its Antiquity had been destroyed, the Names of the Knights having been then just written afresh, and the whole Table, with its Ornaments, newly repaired. Turnaments being
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
often held at <HI>Winchester</HI> before the Court and Parliament, this Table might probably have been used, on those Occasions, for entertaining the Combatants; which, on that Account, was pro∣perly inscribed with the Names of <HI>Arthur</HI>'s twenty-four Knights; either in Commemora∣tion of that Prince, who was the reputed Founder and Patron of Tilts and Turnaments; or be∣cause he was supposed to have established these martial Sports at <HI>Winchester.</HI> In later Times these Exercises were called <HI>Mensa Rotunda</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thom. Walsing. edit. i. pag. 49. See also Selden, De Duello, pag. 64. Works, Fol. vol. iii.</NOTE>. The Names of the Knights inscribed on the Table are much the same as those we find in an old Romance concerning King <HI>Arthur</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Called <HI>Morte Arthur,</HI> &amp;c. printed by Caxton, 1484.</NOTE>, viz. Sir <HI>Lancelot du Lake,</HI> Sir <HI>Tristram,</HI> Sir <HI>Pelleas,</HI> Sir <HI>Gawain,</HI> Sir <HI>Garethe,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>On or near the Site of this Castle <HI>Charles</HI> II. Anno Dom. 1683, laid the Foundation of a magnificent Royal Palace, only the Shell of which was finished. A Cupola was designed 30 Feet higher than the Roof, which would have been seen at Sea; and a Street was intended leading from the West End of the Cathedral to the Centre of the Front. The Length of the whole is 328 Feet. A Park was also projected ten Miles in Circumserence: but the Death of the
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
King prevented the Progress and Execution of this noble Plan. The Palace is at present converted into a commodious Prison for <HI>French</HI> Prisoners of War.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Winchester</HI> contains eight Parish Churches. It had formerly 45, or more, many of which were suppressed by Bishop <HI>Fox</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. as insufficient to maintain their respective Incumbents<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Leland, ut supra, pag. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a Meadow, called <HI>Denemrch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ead,</HI> be∣tween Hyde Abbey and the City Wall, <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> is said to have encountered and conquered <HI>Colbrand</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> Giant. The Battle-Ax with which he atchieved this memor∣able Exploit was kept in the Treasury of St. <HI>Swythun</HI>'s Cathedral till the Reformation, and was called <HI>Colbrandis Axe</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Rudbourne apud Wharton, vol. i. pag. 211.</NOTE>. Eastward of the Town, on a Hill called St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Hill, where stood a Chapel dedicated to St. <HI>Giles, Waldawus</HI> a <HI>Saxon,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> was beheaded by Command of the Conqueror<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Leland, ut supra, pag. 86. but Camden says Waltheof Earl of Huntingdon, pag. 143. edit. Gib. vol. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the opposite Hill, called <HI>Catharine</HI> Hill, <HI>Leland</HI> acquaints us, there was a fair Chapel de∣dicated to that Saint. It was endowed with Lands, and suppressed by Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ut supra, pag. 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12"/>
The Prospect from either of these Hills is very delightful. The City, interspersed with Trees and Gardens, magnificent Structures and vene∣rable Ruins, and the Country consisting of watered winding Vallies, bordered by Decli∣vities of a prodigious Height, gradually rising into extensive Downs bounded by distant Woods, must charm every Lover of romantic or rural beauty.</P>
<P><HI>St. John's House</HI> is appointed for the public Meetings of the Mayor and Aldermen. It has an Hospital annexed, and is said to have been founded by <HI>William Lamb,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> 1554. In <HI>Le∣land</HI>'s Time it was an Hospital for the Sick, and in the Chapel was a Statute of St. <HI>Bristan</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who probably was the Founder<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ut supra, pag. 85.</NOTE>. He died A.D. 932. On the West Side of the Close-Wall is a commodious Hospital founded by <HI>William Symonds,</HI> Gent. A.D. 1607, for six old Men, one Woman, and four Boys. On the North Side of the Cathedral is a decent College founded by Bishop <HI>Morley,</HI> A.D. 1672, for ten Widows of Clergymen.</P>
<P>The County Hospital in this City is a magnifi∣cent Edifice, the Front of which is 224 Feet in Length. It was opened for Patients at <HI>Michael∣mas,</HI> A.D. 1759. This Institution was the first of the Kind in <HI>England,</HI> and was begun, but not in the present Building, A.D. 1736.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13"/>
The Market Cross, about the Middle of the High-street, is an elegant Gothic Structure, 43 Feet high, and, as I conjecture, of the Age of <HI>Henry</HI> VI.</P>
<P>Besides the College and Cathedral, which will be separately described, there have been se∣veral religious Foundations in this City. The most eminent was <HI>Hyde-Abby</HI> for Benedictines, which stood for 200 Years within the Precincts of St. <HI>Swythun</HI>'s, and on a Quarrel between the two Societies was removed to a Suburb called <HI>Hyde.</HI> It was established at <HI>Hyde</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> I. and <HI>W. Giffard</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester.</HI> A.D. 1121. and at the Dissolution, A.D. 1538, was valued at 865l. 18s.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tanner Not. Mon. pag. 155, 156. Fol.</NOTE>. It's Abbots had a Seat in Parlia∣ment. The Church almost fills a large Meadow with it's Ruins, and appears to have consisted of three Iles, and to have been at least 240 Feet long. It was built with Flint cased with Stone. Of the Monastery nothing remains except some Out-buildings toward the Street; and one Gate∣way, the Mouldings of which exhibit, on each Side, the Head of a King. The same Head oc∣curs on a Wall towards the South. Great Part of the Precinct-Wall is still standing. In this Abby many <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings and Princes were sumptuously buried. The Church now called <HI>Hyde Church</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">"In Atrio Hydae,"</Q> MSS. Coll. Wint.</P></NOTE>, originally stood within the Pre∣cincts,
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
as did many Parish Churches in other Places<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As at Winchecombe, Co. Glocester, Cirencester, ibid. Evesham, Co. Worcester, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The Tower of Hyde Church was probably built with the Stone collected from the Ruins of the Abby.</P>
<P>Next to this, in Point of Eminence, was a Benedictine Nunnery, called St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Abby, founded by <HI>Alswithe</HI> the Wife of King <HI>Alfred,</HI> A.D. 900. It was situated near the House of <HI>George Pescod,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and is now reduced to a small Heap of Stones. It consisted of an Abbess and 21 Nuns, and was valued at the Dissolution at 175<HI>l.</HI> 7<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tanner, ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this Nunnery <HI>Henry</HI> I. took his Wife <HI>Maud,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Malcolm</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> by which Marriage the Royal Families of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> were united. <HI>Camden</HI> ac∣quaints us, that the Ruins of this Monastery shewed it to have been a stately Fabric<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Brit. vol. i. Gib. edit. pag. 143.</NOTE>. Besides these there were the following Monasteries<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See Tanner, Not. Mon. in <HI>Hampshire.</HI></NOTE>, or religious Foundations.</P>
<P>The Hospital of the Almonry of the Church of St. <HI>Swythun,</HI> commonly called the Sustern Spytal, maintained by St. <HI>Swythun</HI>'s Convent, adjoined to the present College on the West.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15"/>
The College of St. <HI>Elisabeth,</HI> founded by <HI>John de Pontisora,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> A.D. 1300, for one Provost, six Chaplain Priests, six Clerks, and six Choristers, was valued at the Dissolution at 112<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> The Provost had six Marks, and the Chaplains 40<HI>s.</HI> per Annum, besides Commons.

<P><PB N="16" REF="16"/>
On the North Side of the Church-yard of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Abby, described above, stood the Chapel of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> consisting of a Warden and several Priests.</P>
<P>Here was a Convent of each of the four Or∣ders of Mendicant Friers. The Augustine Friers were just without the South Gate on the left in the Road to <HI>Southampton.</HI> The Grey Friers, or Minors, on the right just with the East Gate. The Dominicans, on the North, within the City.</P>
<P>To these we may add the Prior and Brethren of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the Church of St. <HI>Mary Kalender.</HI></P>
<P>We shall close our Account of the City with a Description of the Hospital of St. <HI>Cross,</HI> which stands about half a Mile Southward of the Town.</P>
<P>This <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From Lowth's Life of Wykeham, edit. 1. pag. 72. Tanner's Account varies in one or two Circumstances. Ut supra, pag. 161.</NOTE> Hospital was founded by <HI>Henry de Blois,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and Brother of King <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> about the Year 1136, for the Maintenance of thirteen poor Men: who likewise ordained, that one hundred other poor Persons should be enter∣tained here every Day at Dinner, in a Place ap∣pointed for that Purpose, called <HI>Hundred-Mennes-Hall.</HI> Of these there were always thirteen of the poorer Scholars of the great Grammar School of <HI>Winchester.</HI> But this Institution of daily feeding the one hundred Poor was not of
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
long Continuance; for it was abrogated before the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and instead of it, an Establishment was substituted of four Priests, thirteen secular Clerks, and four Choristers. In the Year 1444, Cardinal <HI>Beaufort,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> made ample Additions to the Hospi∣tal, for the Maintenance of two Priests, thirty∣five Brethren, and three Sisters, besides those of the original Foundation. He gave his new Con∣stitution the Name of <HI>The Alms House of Noble Poverty;</HI> by which it appears, that he designed the House for the Relief of decayed Gentlemen. This Hospital, though considerably diminished in it's Revenues, still subsists on the Remains of both Endowments.</P>
<P>The Building consists of one extensive, irre∣gular Court. The Church, which was built in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> by the first Founder, is a curious Remain of <HI>Saxon</HI> Architecture<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have some Examples of the ancient SAXON Man∣ner; which was with Peers or <HI>round</HI> Pillars, much stronger than Tuscan; round-headed Arches, and Windows.

to the West Door it is 150 Feet in Length; and the Transept 120. The Roof is remarkably lofty. On each Side of the Altar are handsome Screens of Spire Work in Stone. The Names of all the Officers belonging to the Hospital about A.D. 1575, are carved on a Desk in the Chancel, among which we find those of a Chanter, and singing Men; but at present there is no Pro∣vision for a Choir.</P>
<P>The great West Window, the Construction of which is in a more ornamental Style than any of the rest, was probably altered to it's present Form, by the second Founder, Cardinal <HI>Beaufort.</HI> It has some Remains of painted Glass, with an Inscription, nothing of which is legible, or at least intelligible, at present, except the Words <HI>Nicholas Bedford.</HI> In a South Window of the cross Ile, are these Arms, viz.

<HEAD>THE COLLEGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE College of St. <HI>Mary of Winchester,</HI> commonly called Winchester College, is situated to the South East of the Cathedral, just without the City Wall. The Front is extended to the Length of 249 Feet, and consists of Offices on the West Side of the Gateway, and of a Part of the Warden's Lodgings on the East. Under the Gateway, the Tower of which is adorned with a Statue of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> we enter the first Court. On the left are the War∣den's Lodgings, which are commodious and am∣ple. That Part of them which fronts the Garden was erected at the Expence of Warden <HI>Nicholas</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>. the Year 1692. That Part which faces the Street, was raised in the Wardenship of Dr. <HI>John Harmar,</HI> as appears by the Initials, J.H. and the Date 1597. The North Front of the second Quadrangle loses much of its intended Effect by Means of another Part of these Lodgings, built A.D. 1613. which runs at right Angles against it on the left.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24"/>
We enter the second Quadrangle under a stately Tower, called the Middle Gate, adorned with the Statues of the Founder, the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and an Angel. This Court is 96 Feet over. The lower Rooms, on either Side of the Gate∣way, and of the whole Eastern Side of this Court, are the Lodging Rooms of the Scholars; over which are the Apartments of the Fellows. The Stair Case adjoining to the North West Angle, leads to the Apartments of the School∣master, which are spacious, and elegantly fur∣nished. On the West is the Kitchen, and a con∣venient Conduit.</P>
<P>The whole South Side is magnificently formed by the Chapel and Hall. The latter is a noble Gothic Room 63 Feet in Length, and 33 in Breadth; in which the Scholars dine at Twelve, and sup at Six. In the uppermost Window, on the North Side, are the Arms of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Marquis of <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P>The Chapel is equal to most, and superior to many, in our Universities; whether we regard its Dimensions, its Furniture, and the Solemnity which strikes us at our Entrance. It is 102 Feet long, and 33 broad. The Screen, Stalls, and Altar-piece, which is of the <HI>Ionic</HI> Order, were executed in the Wardenship of Dr. <HI>Nicholas</HI> abovementioned. The Altar is adorned with a beautiful Salutation Piece, painted by <HI>Le Moine,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
and given by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Burton,</HI> the pre∣sent public-spirited, and learned Head Master. The Branches are the Gift of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Christopher Eyre,</HI> formerly Usher. The East Window is painted with the Genealogy of Christ, and has been celebrated in an elegant Poem written by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Lowth,</HI> Prebendary of <HI>Durham,</HI> which is printed in an admired Collection of <HI>English</HI> Poems, entitled The UNION<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Printed for R. Baldwin in Pater-noster Row.</NOTE>. The rest of the Windows are decorated with the Pourtraits of Saints, with their Names underwritten: Together with the following Inscription, which is in many Places at present destroyed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Orate pro anima Wil∣helmi de Wykeham Fundatoris istius Collegii.</HI>"</Q> On the North Side stands the Organ. The Roof is covered with a Cieling of Wood in Imitation of arched Stone Work, without which, the Height would be too great, as it is at <HI>New College</HI> Cha∣pel in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where such a Cieling was, pro∣bably, originally intended. At least, the present Rafter Work of that noble Chapel is by no Means equal to the Magnificence of the rest. This Cieling seems to have been finished about the Time of that which covers the Presby∣tery in the Cathedral, as it is exactly of the same Workmanship.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26"/>
In this Chapel, Choir Service is performed at Eight and Five, on Sundays and Holidays, and at Five on their preceding Eves. The Choir consists of three Chaplains, three Clerks, one Organist, and sixteen Choristers.</P>
<P>In the Ante Chapel is a Recess to the South, over Part of which stands the Tower, contain∣ing five Bells. This Addition, which exhibits a more modern Style of Architecture, seems to have been erected in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. together with the Tower, by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wainfleet,</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> whose Arms are cut in the Roof, together with the following Arms and Rebuses.</P>

<P>Contiguous to the College, on the West, is a spacious quadrangular Building, in which the young Gentlemen not on the Foundation, who are called Commoners, live in a Collegiate Manner, under the Care of the second Master or Usher; a Situation which must be acknow∣ledged to be far more convenient sor the Purposes of Learning, and good Discipline, than the usual Custom of our great Schools, where the Youth are boarded in the Town, and are at a Distance from the constant and immediate In∣spection of their proper Governors. On one Side of the Area of this Structure is a commodious Cloyster. There is also a noble Hall, 50 Feet in Length, and 30 in Breadth, in which the Commoners dine, and, when absent from the School, pursue their private Studies.</P>
<P>This College was founded by that magnificent Prelate <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wykeham,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> for one Warden, ten Fellows, one School∣master, one Usher, three Chaplains, seventy Scholars, three Clerks, and sixteen Choristers.</P>

The Building being compleated on the 28th of <HI>March,</HI> A.D. 1393, the Warden and Scholars made their solemn Entrance, at Nine in the Morning, chaunt∣ing in Procession. It should be observed, that the Founder, by his first Charter, established only a Warden and seventy Scholars, which was the whole Society who took formal Possession of the College, as abovementioned; and who, be∣fore the Building was finished, were provided with Lodgings in the Parish of St. <HI>John</HI> upon the Hill. The Founder obtained a second Charter for the Establishment of the ten Fellows, and Officers of the Choir<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the Charters in Dugd. Mon. vol. iii. Eccl.

<P>SOME Writers report, that a Monastery was founded in this City by King <HI>Lucius,</HI> A.D. 169, which was destroyed in the Persecu∣tion of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> A.D. 266<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho. Rudborne Hist. Maj. Wint. Ang. Sacr. tom. i. pag. 182, 183.</NOTE>. This, it is said, was afterwards restored, and underwent various Revolutions; till <HI>Kyngelise,</HI> the first Christian King of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> began a Cathedral Church, A.D. 611. which was probably finished by his Successor <HI>Kenwalch,</HI> and replenished with Religious by <HI>Birinus,</HI> the Bishop and Apostle of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> A.D. 646. Soon afterwards, viz. A.D. 660, the See of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> now in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> was removed hither, and <HI>Wina</HI> was appointed the first Bishop. But before this new Constitution commenced, <HI>Birinus</HI> and <HI>Agilbertus</HI> were the two first Bishops of <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="70"/>
The Chapter of this Foundation, who were Seculars, continued about 300 Years, and were at length removed by the Persuasion of Bishop <HI>Ethelwold</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Maj. ut supr. pag. 218.</NOTE>, in the Reign of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> about A.D. 963, who substituted a Convent of Bene∣dictines, which remained till the Reformation.</P>
<P>About the Year 1079 Bishop <HI>Walkelyne</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Annal. Ec. Wint. ut supr. pag. 294, 295.</NOTE> be∣gan the present Edifice, and finished the Tower, the Choir, the Transept, and probably the West End<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rudborne, ibid. 271.</NOTE>. Accordingly the Monks, in the Pre∣sence of almost all the Bishops and Abbots of <HI>England,</HI> passed with much State and Triumph from the old Monastery to the new one, A.D. 1093, on the Feast of their Patron St. <HI>Swythin;</HI> and in a most solemn Procession translated the Shrine of that Saint to the new Church. The next Day <HI>Walkelyne</HI> commanded the old Monas∣tery to be demolished; which was effected the same Year, one Porch and the high Altar ex∣cepted<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ut infra.</NOTE>. The whole being nobly improved by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wykeham,</HI> was at lenth finished, as it now appears, by <HI>Fox;</HI> of whose respective Bene∣factions and Alterations I shall find a proper Occasion hereafter to speak more particularly.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="71"/>
Notwithstanding the positive Assertions above, concerning <HI>Walkelyne</HI>'s entire Demolition of the old Church, I am persuaded that the low-built Iles at the East End of the Choir, existed before the Time of <HI>Walkelyne,</HI> and are a Part of the old Church erected by the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings. This ap∣pears from several demonstrative Proofs: For, they are in a more simple and confined Style of Architecture, than any Part of <HI>Walkelyne</HI>'s new Work; and, admitting that <HI>Walkelyne</HI> demolished great Part of the old Church, it seems probable that he should leave that Part of it standing in which many of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and Bishops his Predecessors, are confessedly buried. Another Evidence of this Hypothesis are the <HI>Crypts</HI> on which these low Iles stand to this day; and which, as appears from a Latin Epistle in Verse of <HI>Wolstan</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apud Leland. Collecta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. vol. i. pag. 151.</NOTE>, Precentor of the Church, to <HI>Aelphege,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> A.D. 946, were con∣structed by <HI>Ethelwold</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Ed∣gar.</HI> He is speaking of <HI>Ethelwold</HI>'s rebuilding the Church.</P>
<Q>Insuper <HI>occultas</HI> studuistis &amp; addere <HI>cryptas.</HI></Q>
<P>These Crypts, now remaining, if they do not prove the Antiquity of the Building they sup∣port,
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
yet at least they point out the original Situation of the Church; and invalidate those Testimonies which assert that <HI>Walkelyne</HI> entirely demolished the old Church, and chose a new Ground-plot for his new Structure.</P>
<P>There is another Circumstance mentioned by <HI>Rudbourne</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 270, 271, apud Whart. Angl. Sacr. vol. i.</NOTE>, which still further corroborates my Supposition. He observes that <HI>William Rufus</HI> was buried in the Choir under a Tower, which fell down a few Years afterwards, and that in the Place of it <HI>Walkelyn</HI> erected the present Tower. He adds, that <HI>Walkelyn</HI> did not build this Tower in his Life-time, but committed the Care of it to his Executors, who finished it after his Death.</P>
<P>The Writer of the Epistle abovementioned, who lived A.D. 946, tells us that <HI>Ethelwold</HI> in∣troduced a Water-Course into the Priory, now corruptly called the <HI>Log-Pond.</HI></P>

<P>Of the Conventual Buildings, which were transferred with the Revenues, nothing consider∣able at present remains.

The principal Part, now standing, is the Dean's, formerly the Pri∣or's, Hall. It was very losty with a Roof of Rafter-Work still to be traced, and was 65 Feet long, and 22 broad. But as the whole is sub∣divided into several Apartments, its Height, Length, and Breadth, are at present lost to the Eye. Five Windows on the West Side of it re∣main, with its End-Window on the South.

The opposite Wall retains the Vestiges of Arches, and of a large Gateway, which proba∣bly led from the Cloisters to the Refectory before mentioned; or perhaps was the public Entrance from the Monastery into the Cloisters, and from thence to the Church. Through an antient Portico on the Eastern Square of these Cloisters, near the Deanery, they passed into the Chapter-House, which is destroyed, and makes a Part of the Dean's Garden. It was extended under the End of the Southern Transept to the Length of ninety Feet, against which the Heads of Arches, with some of their Pillars still appear; and prove from their Style, that it was built with the Transept by <HI>Walkelyne.</HI> Some of the Priors were interred

The Length of this magnificent Fabric, from East to West, is 545 Feet: Of, these, our La∣dy's Chapel includes 54 Feet, and the Choir 136. The Length from the Iron Door, near the Entrance of the Choir, to the Porch at the West End, is 351 Feet. The Length of the Transepts is 186 Feet. The Breadth of the Body, below the Transepts, is 87 Feet; and of the Choir 40. The Vaulting in the Inside is 76 Feet high<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willis Mitr.

Gale's Mensuration is imper∣fect and erroneous, pag. 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Prospect from the West End of the mid∣dle Ile, to the East Window beyond the Choir, must strike every Mind which is susceptible of those aweful Feelings that arise from the Contem∣plation of that Greatness and Extent which are peculiar to the Proportions of <HI>Gothic</HI> Architecture. A judicious and entertaining Passage from <HI>Lowth</HI>'s Life of <HI>Wykeham</HI> will here be properly introduced.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This Ile was originally of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Architec∣ture not greatly differing from the <HI>Roman;</HI> with round Pillars much stronger than <HI>Doric</HI> or <HI>Tus∣can,</HI> or square Piers, adorned with small Pillars; round-headed Arches and Windows; and plain
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
Walls on the Outside without Buttresses; as ap∣pears by the Cross-ile and Tower which remain of it to this Day. The Nave of the Church had been for some Time in a bad Condition: Bishop <HI>Edyngdon</HI> undertook to repair it in the latter Part of his Time, and by his Will ordered his Executors to finish what he had begun. And whether in Pursuance of his Design and by his Benefaction, or otherwise, it appears, that in the Year 1371, some Work of this Kind was carrying on at a great Expence. However, <HI>Wykeham,</HI> upon due Consideration and Survey, found it either so decayed and infirm, or else so mean in its Appearance, and so much below the Dignity of one of the first Episcopal Sees in the Kingdom, that he determined to take down the whole from the Tower westward, and to rebuild it both in a stronger and more magnificent Man∣ner. This great Work he undertook in the Year 1394, and entered upon it the Beginning of the next Year, upon the following Conditions stipulated between him and the Prior and Con∣vent, who acquit the Bishop of all Obligation to it, and acknowledge it as proceeding from his mere Liberality, and Zeal for the Honour of God: They agree to find the whole Scaffolding necessary for the Work; they give the Bishop free Leave to dig and to carry away Chalk and Sand from any of their Lands, as he shall think
<PB N="85" REF="85"/>
most convenient and useful for the same Purpose; and they allow the whole Materials of the old Building to be applied to the Use of the new. He employed <HI>William Winford</HI> as Architect: <HI>Simon Membury</HI> was appointed Surveyor of the Work on the Bishop's Part, and <HI>John Wayte,</HI> one of the Monks, Controller on the Part of the Convent. As the Church of <HI>Winchester</HI> is situated in low Ground, which, without great Precaution and Expence, affords no very sure Foundation for so weighty a Structure, <HI>Wykeham</HI> thought it safest to confine himself to the Plan of the for∣mer Building, and to make Use of a Founda∣tion already tried, and subject to no Hazard. He even chose to apply to his Purpose some Part of the lower Order of Pillars of the old Church, though his Design was in a different Style of Ar∣chitecture; that which we commonly call <HI>Gothic,</HI> with pointed Arches and Windows, without Key∣stones, and Pillars consisting of an Assemblage of many small ones closely connected together; but which is more properly <HI>Saracen,</HI> for such was its Origin: The Crusades gave us an Idea of this Form of Architecture, which afterwards prevailed throughout <HI>Europe.</HI> The Pillars or Piers of the old Building, which he made Use of, were about sixteen Feet in Height; of the same Form with those in the East Side of the Northern Cross-ile: These he carried up higher,
<PB N="86" REF="86"/>
according to the new Design, altering their Form, but retaining their Strength, and adopt∣ing them as a firm Basis for his own Work. The new Pillars are nearly equal in Bulk to the old ones; and the Intercolumniation remains much the same. These Circumstances, in which Stability and Security were very wisely in the first Place consulted, have been attended however with some Inconvenience, as it seems owing to them, that this Building has not that Lightness and Freedom, and that Elegance of Proportion, which might have been expected from <HI>Wykeham</HI>'s known Taste in Architecture, and from the Style and Manner of his other Works in this Kind; of which we have evident Examples in the Chapels of both his Colleges, especially in the Western Part of that of <HI>New College</HI> in <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> which is remarkably beautiful. To the further Disadvantage of its present Appearance, an Alteration which could not then be foreseen has since happened. At that Time the Buildings of the Monastery covered the whole South Side of the Church, so that it seemed needless to be at a great Expence upon Ornaments in that Part which was like to be for ever concealed. By the Demolition of the Monastery this Side is now laid open, and discovers a Defect of Buttresses and Pinnacles, with which the North Side, which was then the only one in View, is properly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnished. Another

Alteration of the same Kind has been made in Inside, and with the like Effect: Immediately before the Entrance of the Choir stood the Vestry, which extending from Side to Side of the Nave, prevented the intire Conformation of those Pillars against which it rested to the new Design, but at the same Time concealed the Irregularity: In the Time of <HI>Charles</HI> the First this was pulled down, and the present beautiful Skreen, the Work of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> was erected; but no Care was taken, by an easy and obvious Alteration, to correct a Deformity, which was then uncovered, and still continues to disgrace the Building, in a Part which, of all others, is the most frequently exposed to Observation. However, with its Defects, which appear thus to be owing partly to an accidental and unfore∣seen Change of Circumstances, partly to the Care of avoiding greater Inconveniencies, there is no Fabric of its Kind in <HI>England,</HI> after those of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> which excells this Part of the Cathedral Church of <HI>Winchester,</HI> in Great∣ness, Stateliness, and Majesty. This great Pile took up about ten Years in erecting, and was but just finished when the Bishop died. He had provided in his Will for the intire Completion of his Design by his Executors, in Case of his Death; and allotted 2500 Marks for what then remained to be done, besides 500 Marks for the

<P>From this Ile, by a stately Flight of eight Steps, we approach the Choir. The Screen abovementioned is of the Composite Order, and adorned on the Right Hand with a Statue of <HI>James</HI> I. and on the Left of <HI>Charles</HI> I. They are both of Brass, and were given, together with the Screen itself, by the latter of these Monarchs. During the Civil Wars, the Pres∣sbyterians, among other Outrages, barbarously defaced and abused both these Statues, but particularly that of <HI>Charles;</HI> at tempting to break off the Crown, and declaring with much malicious Triumph, <HI>that they would bring him back to the Parliament</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, ubi infr.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Stalls are of <HI>Norway</HI> Oak, and are a masterly Piece of <HI>Gothic</HI> Spire Work, being at once elegant and majestic.

the same Side stands the Organ, which was re∣moved thither by the Command of <HI>Charles</HI> I. from the old Screen, where it was justly supposed to intercept the View from the West to the East End. The Stalls on the South Side are bounded by the Bishop's Throne, erected by Bishop <HI>Tre∣lawney,</HI> translated from <HI>Exeter,</HI> A.D. 1706. The Pediment, which is embellished with a Mitre and the Arms of the See impaling those of his Family, is supported by fluted Columns of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. The Vaulting of the Roof of the Choir was executed in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. there being, before this, an Opening from the Choir into the first Story or Room of the Tower; on which Account the Side Arches of this first Story, being intended to be seen from below, are wrought and ornamented. We find the same Opening in the Tower of St. <HI>Cross,</HI> built about the same Time. It was undoubtedly looked upon as a Beauty in the Architecture; and had, in some Measure, the same Effect, as the <HI>Louvre,</HI> or open Lantern formerly used in great Halls. Height of Roof in the Inside was also a favourite Circumstance in Structure of this Sort, which was produced from this Expedient in a very striking Degree. The Arms and Initials of the King, with those of his Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and of <HI>John Young,</HI> Dean at that Time, are intro∣duced among the Ornaments of the Vaulting, which is of Wood. The two Branches are the
<PB N="90" REF="90"/>
Gift of the late Dean, Dr. <HI>Cheney;</HI> who has left, by Will, 220<HI>l.</HI> for paving the Choir with Marble.</P>
<P>In the Pannels below the Stalls, under the Organ, and on the opposite Side are some Me∣morials of the new Foundation of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. viz. the Date 1540, in which the new Establish∣ment commenced: The King's Arms with H.R. <HI>Henricus Rex:</HI> The Arms of the Church, given by the said King<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vid. Sigill. Eccles. A Church, in the Gate of which is the Image of the Trinity.</NOTE>: The Portcullis, and the Arms of <HI>William Kyngesmill,</HI> the first Dean, with W.K.

These, I suppose, were put up at the Alteration of the House.</P>
<P>In the Area leading to the high Altar, is a plain raised Monument, of a greyish Stone, without any Inscription, under which, <HI>William Rufus,</HI> who was killed in the neighbouring new Forest, A.D. 1000, is buried. This Tomb was opened by the Rebels in the Civil Wars, who stole from thence the Remains of a Cloth of Gold, a Ring set with Rubies, said to be worth 500<HI>l.</HI> and a small Silver Chalice.</P>
<P>With this Area the Presbytery begins, which is ornamented with a Roof highly finished in a different Taste from that of the Tower, and is
<PB N="91" REF="91"/>
separated, on each Side, from the North and South Iles, by a well-executed Partition Wall of open Work. On the Top of either Wall are placed three Shrines, or Chests, beautifully carved, painted, and gilded, with a Crown on each, in which are enclosed the Bones of several of the West <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, Bishops, and some later Princes, who had been originally buried behind the Altar or in different Parts of the Church. These Remains were thus no less pi∣ously than carefully collected and deposited, by Bishop <HI>Fox,</HI> A.D. 1525. Their Names, &amp;c. are inscribed on every Chest, which the Reader will find among the <HI>Tombs</HI> and <HI>Monumental Inscriptions.</HI></P>
<P>The Ascent to, and Area of, the high Altar, is paved with Marble, by the Benefaction of Dr. <HI>William Harris,</HI> Prebendary, and School-master of <HI>Winchester</HI> College, who dying, A.D. 1700, bequeathed 800 <HI>l.</HI> for ornamenting the Altar. The Wood Work about the Altar was erected by Bishop <HI>Fox:</HI> But the Canopy, with its Fes∣toons, and other Ornaments, were added, about the Time when the new Screen of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> at the Choir-Entrance, was built, as I conjecture from C R in the Cornice.</P>
<P>The two Doors or Entrances on each Side still remain, through which the Priest approached the Altar from the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI> The
<PB N="92" REF="92"/>
Tops of three Niches are likewise remaining over the Altar, which probably contained three Images representing the Trinity. A good Piece of Painting would be a noble and proper Im∣provement of this superb Altarpiece. Behind is a a very lofty Screen, or Partition of Stone, charged with most exquisite Embellishments of <HI>Gothic</HI> Workmanship, and infinitely superior, in Point of finishing, to another of the same Sort in St. <HI>Al∣ban</HI>'s Abbey Church. The Niches, before the Reformation, were filled with Statues; but are at present supplied with Urns, which by some are thought inconsistent Decorations. These were the Gift of Dr. <HI>William Harris</HI> abovementioned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From his Epitaph.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Screen, Side Partition-Walls, Roof of the Presbytery, and of the adjoining Side Iles, with their Walls and Windows, were finished at the Expence, or by the Interest, of Bishop <HI>Fox,</HI> A.D. 1525, as appears by his Name and Arms carved in many Places. The same liberal Bene∣factor new glazed, with painted Glass, as he had new made, the Windows of this Part of the Church; that is, the Choir Windows, and those of the parallel Iles. He likewise fronted the Boundary of the Choir, on the Outside, with two beautiful Pinnacles, and other ornamental Architecture, among which his Statue is placed, cloathed in the Episcopal Habit. He probably
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
intended to complete the Remainder of the East End in the same Style<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He seems to have reduced the Windows in the West Side of the Northern Transept to their present Form.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is said, and from good Authority, that the Bishop was assisted in this Work by Prior <HI>Sil∣kestede</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Willis's Mitr. Ab. vol. i. pag. 301.</NOTE>. This Prior, at least, co-operated with <HI>Fox</HI> in improving the Church by building the Stalls, and a Chapel, about the Time when <HI>Fox</HI> began these Alterations<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See Wood's Hist. Univ. Oxon. L. ii. p. 230.</NOTE>. His Initials T.S. are in the Roof of <HI>Fox</HI>'s Presbytery. It should seem that Cardinal <HI>Henry Beaufort</HI> left some Money for this Purpose, as H.B. appears on the Outside of the South Partition Wall, and over its En∣trance. He died not many Years before <HI>Fox</HI> was advanced to the Bishoprick.</P>
<P>In the Grand Rebellion, the Altar-Screen, just mentioned, was artfully protected from the Vio∣lence of the Presbyterians, by Means of an ex∣temporaneous Wall, or Partition, erected in a parallel Line just before it, so as entirely to con∣ceal its Beauties from the Observation of the sa∣crilegious Intruders. Other Parts of the Church did not however escape the mistaken Zeal of these Enemies to all that was graceful or ma∣jestic. On the 16th of <HI>December,</HI> 1642, the Soldiers of Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> entered the Church,
<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
where they broke in Pieces the carved Work of the Choir, containing the Story of the Old and New Testament in admirable Imagery, destroyed the Organ<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>One of their Friends has recorded a most extraordinary Anecdote, that in the Houses of the Prebendaries <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they found great Store of Popish Books, Pictures, and Crucifixes,"</Q> which after a mock Procession were burnt, with the Organ-pipes, in the Streets. John Vicars's <HI>God in the Mount,</HI> or England's Parliamentarie Chronicle, &amp;c. 4to. London, 1644, p. 229.</P></NOTE>, seized the rich Tapestry, Cushions, and Vestments of the Choir, with the Vessels of the Altar, threw down the Communion Table, and carrying off the Rails, which enclosed it, burnt them in their Quarters. After this, they defaced many of the Monuments; and pulling down some of the Chests which contained the Remains of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, they threw their Bones against the painted Glass, which they thus destroyed throughout the Church<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heylin H.st. of Presbyt. pag. 450. edit. 1670. Dugdale's Short View, &amp;c. pag. 558.</NOTE>. But the beautiful Window over the Altar, exhibiting the Pourtraits of several Saints and Bishops of this Church, being more out of their Reach, and less exposed than the rest, is still preserved entire, together with a few Figures on the Windows contiguous. The grand West Window seems to be made up of the dispersed Fragments, which, imperfect as it is, has a fine Effect, and leaves the pensive Imagination to supply that religious
<PB N="95" REF="95"/>
Light which was diffused over all the Church, when every Window retained its original Splendor.</P>
<P>The East End of the Church is terminated by three Chapels. That on the South is adorned with a Monument of <HI>Thomas Langton,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who died A.D. 1500. The Rood-Loft consists of elegant <HI>Gothic</HI> Carving in Wood; and both the Sides are finished in the same Taste. But the Work has been much damaged. Under the Window are several Niches for Statues. The Bishop is said to have built this Chapel<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leland, Collectan. vol. i. pag. 116.</NOTE>. The Roof is painted with a Hen on a Tun, being a Rebus on <HI>Henton,</HI> the Place of his Nativity, and partly on his Name. The Inscription <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Laus tibi Christe.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Chapel in the Centre, dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was erected by Prior <HI>Silkestede</HI> before mentioned, and is used at present for early Prayers. His Name is on the Roof; and on the Sides, which are adorned with ancient Painting, are embossed the Arms of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>Silkestede,</HI> of the See, a Rebus on <HI>T. Langton,</HI> viz. T.L. with a Tun, as in his Chapel just described, and who was Bishop in the former Part of <HI>Silkestede</HI>'s Priorate, for whom also a Tun is introduced on the Cieling. The Inscriptions, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>ad gloriam dei.</HI>"</Q> The same Embossments appear on the Outside
<PB N="96" REF="96"/>
of the Building in the Church-yard. In this Chapel Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was married to King <HI>Philip,</HI> and the Chair in which she was seated, during the Ceremony, still remains near the Altar. It is a Mistake <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willis Mitr. Abb. vol. i. pag. 301.</NOTE> that this Prior built the Chapel in the South Ile, called <HI>Silkestede</HI>'s Chapel. Pro∣bably he might use it as a private Oratory, or perhaps might be interred in it. He seems to have born some Relation to it, for opposite to it are the Remains of a Canopy, under which the Presses for the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/> Vestments are placed, which formerly seems to have been the Covering of Stalls, and still preserves in the Cornice the initial Letters of <HI>Silkestede</HI>'s Name often repeated. These I suppose belonged originally to the oppo∣site Chapel. It is not unlikely that <HI>Silkestede</HI> altered the Windows on this Side of the Tran∣sept; for on the Library Window, contiguous to them on the Outside, is carved T.S. for <HI>Thomas Silkestede,</HI> as I have before observed. The elegant Screen of this little Chapel was at least erected by this Prior; for on it is carved in large ornamented <HI>Gothic</HI> Capitals,</P>
<Q><HI REND="blackletterType">C HD MA S S</HI></Q>
<P>On the North Side of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s Chapel, is a small Chapel perhaps dedicated to
<PB N="97" REF="97"/>
S. <HI>Michael,</HI> as the Pourtraiture of that Angel ap∣pears in many Parts of the Roof.</P>
<P>About the Middle of the great Western Ile stands an ancient Font. It is a square massy Block of jet-coloured Marble, in which a cir∣cular Bason is formed for the Water. It is three Feet three Inches over, and supported by a plain Pedestal of Stone. The Sides of the Square are embellished with rude Bass Relievos, which seem to represent the Miracles of some Saint belonging to this Church. If we may judge from the Stile of the Architecture introduced in the Carving on the South Side, this singular Monument of Antiquity was the Workmanship of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times.</P>
<P>In the Northern Transept are some imperfect Traces of antient Painting, supposed to repre∣sent the Combat of <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> with the <HI>Danish</HI> Champion before mentioned<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>Mention is made of a Painting in the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Chapel at <HI>Winchester.</HI> "The King to the Sheriff of Hants."—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cause to be painted in the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Chapel</HI> at <HI>Winchester,</HI> upon the Gable-End towards the West, the Image of St. <HI>Christopher,</HI> who holds in his Arms our Blessed Saviour."</Q> From a Latin Record in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Liveries,</HI> 32 Henry III. m. 7. citat. apud Stukeley, Palaeograph.

<P>By Way of recapitulating what has been said concerning the building this Church, I shall observe, that it contains three Stiles of Archi∣tecture,
<PB N="98" REF="98"/>
agreeable to the Taste of the three different Ages, in the Progress of which it grew to the present Perfection. The first is the <HI>Saxon,</HI> of which is the Tower, the Transept, and the Eastern Iles, for the most Part built, or be∣gun, by <HI>Walkelyne.</HI> The second is the <HI>Gothic,</HI> simply so called, of which are the Western Iles and West Front, erected by <HI>Wykeham.</HI> The third is the ornamental or improved <HI>Gothic,</HI> which began about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and of which the Presbytery, Side Iles, and outward East End of the Choir, by <HI>Fox,</HI> as well as our Lady's Chapel, by <HI>Silkestede,</HI> are elegant Specimens.</P>
<P>TOMBS AND MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS.</P>

At the East End of the Southern Partition lies the Body of <HI>Richard Fox,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> the pious Founder of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> under a Shrine, which is a most finished Specimen of the improved orna∣mental <HI>Gothic.</HI> Adjoining to the Shrine is a small private Oratory, built with the rest, which he usually frequented for his Devotion, and which is still called Bishop <HI>Fox</HI>'s Study.

the munificent Founder of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford.</HI> He is represented on the Tomb in his Episcopal Habit, grasping his Heart between his Hands.

It was gratefully repaired by <HI>Magdalen</HI> College A.D. 1741. Hedied A.D. 1486.</P>
<P>Westward of this are the Traces of the Effigies of a Bishop, said to be St. <HI>Swythun.</HI></P>

<P>Nearer the Choir is the Tomb of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Edingdon,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> with this Epitaph.</P>

<P>Not far from the little South Door is the su∣perb Tomb and Shrine of WILLIAM of WYKE∣HAM, Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> the munificent
<PB N="107" REF="107"/>
Founder of <HI>Winchester</HI> College, and of <HI>New College</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> who died A.D. 1404. His nobler Shrine is the magnificent Ile, under which he lies entombed, and which was erected at his Expence. The Figure of the Bishop is remarkably fresh, and well preserved: But the Shrine was much injured by the Presbyterians. This grand Mausoleum is placed on the very Spot on which an Altar stood, where <HI>Wykeham,</HI> when a Boy, constantly fre∣quented a Mass called <HI>Pekismass</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lowth's Wykeham, pag. 278.</NOTE>. At the Feet of the Bishop are three small Figures of <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks; and at his Head two Angels. This Epitaph encompasses the Tomb.</P>

<P>Near the Choir is the Figure of a martial Per∣sonage, which is much defaced. We learn his Name from the following Inscription.</P>

There is a Statue in that Church, which the In∣habitants suppose to be his. See Mon. Angl.

<P>The more modern Monuments and Inscrip∣scriptions of this Church, which are very nume∣rous, are here purposely omitted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a formal and entire Recital of them would have exceeded the Limits of our Plan, and extended our Work to a tedious, and perhaps unnecessary, Prolixity. Those I have described are most likely to engage the Attention of curious Observers, and their Inscrip∣tions are such as are not immediately obvious to every Spectator.</P>
<P>From this Survey of the Inside of the Church we would conduct the Spectator to the West End, which is a striking Specimen of the massy <HI>Gothic</HI> Manner. It is finished with two small Side Spires and a central Pinnacle, with a Niche containing an Episcopal Statue of WILLIAM of WYKEHAM, from whose ample Beneficence this venerable Pile derives its principal Mag∣nificence and Beauty.</P>
