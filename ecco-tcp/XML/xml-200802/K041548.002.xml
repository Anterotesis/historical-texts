<L>On thee, O GIBBON! in whose splendid page</L>
<L>ROME shines majestic 'mid the woes of age,</L>
<L>Mistaken Zeal, wrapt in a priestly pall,</L>
<L N="10">Has from the baser urn pour'd darkest gall:</L>
<L>These stains to Learning would a Bard efface</L>
<L>With tides of glory from the golden vase,</L>
<L>But that he feels this nobler task require</L>
<L>A spirit glowing with cogenial fire—</L>
<L N="15">A VIRGIL only may uncensur'd aim</L>
<L>To sing in equal verse a LIVY's fame:</L>
<L>Yet while Polemics, in fierce league combin'd,</L>
<L>With savage discord vex thy feeling mind;</L>
<L>And rashly stain Religion's just defence,</L>
<L N="20">By gross detraction and perverted sense;</L>
<L>Thy wounded ear may haply not refuse</L>
<L>The soothing accents of an humbler Muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The lovely Science, whose attractive air</L>
<L>Derives new charms from thy devoted care,</L>
<L N="25">Is near ally'd to that enchanting Art,</L>
<L>Which reigns the idol of the Poet's heart.</L>

Tho' sister Goddesses, thy guardian maid</L>
<L>Shines in the robe of fresher youth array'd,</L>
<L>Like PALLAS recent from the brain of JOVE,</L>
<L>When Strength with Beauty in her features strove;</L>
<L N="31">While elder Poesy, in every clime</L>
<L>The flower of earliest fall, has past her prime:</L>
<L>The bloom, which her autumnal cheeks supply,</L>
<L>Palls on the Public's philosophic eye.</L>
<L>What! tho' no more with Fancy's strong controul</L>
<L N="36">Her Epic wonders fascinate the soul;</L>
<L>With humbler hopes, she wishes still to please</L>
<L>By moral elegance, and labour'd ease:</L>
<L>Like other Prudes, leaves Beauty's lost pretence,</L>
<L N="40">And strives to charm by Sentiment and Sense.</L>
<L>Yet deaf to Envy's voice, and Pride's alarms,</L>
<L>She loves the rival, who eclips'd her charms;</L>
<L>Safe in thy favour, she would fondly stray</L>
<L>Round the wide realm, which owns that Sister's sway,</L>
<L N="45">Sing the just fav'rites of historic fame,</L>
<L>And mark their purest laws and noblest aim.</L>

<L>My eyes with joy this pathless field explore,</L>

<L>The happy teacher of harmonious phrase,</L>
<L>Whose patient fingers all the threads untwine,</L>
<L>Which in the mystic chain of Music join;</L>
<L>Strict DIONYSIUS, of severest Taste,</L>
<L N="60">Has justly some historic duties trac'd,</L>
<L>And some pure precepts into practice brought,</L>

<L>Immortal sweetness o'er thy Attic Prose!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Egypt <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 77. See NOTE V.</NOTE> once a dread tribunal stood;</L>
<L>Offspring of Wisdom! source of Public Good!</L>
<L>Before this Seat, by holy Justice rear'd,</L>
<L N="80">The mighty Dead, in solemn pomp, appear'd;</L>
<L>For till its sentence had their rights expos'd,</L>
<L>The hallow'd portals of the tomb were clos'd;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
A sculptur'd form of Truth the Judges wore,</L>
<L>A sacred emblem of the charge they bore!</L>
<L N="85">The claims of Virtue their pure voice exprest,</L>
<L>And bade the opening grave receive its honor'd guest.</L>
<L>Thus awefully array'd in Judgment's robe,</L>
<L>With powers extensive as the peopled Globe;</L>
<L>To her just bar impartial Hist'ry brings</L>
<L>The gorgeous group of Statesmen, Heroes, Kings;</L>
<L N="91">With all whose minds, outshining splendid birth,</L>
<L>Attract the notice of th' enlighten'd earth.</L>
<L>From artful Pomp she strips the proud disguise</L>
<L>That flash'd delusion in admiring eyes;</L>
<L N="95">To injur'd Worth gives Glory's wish'd reward,</L>
<L>And blazons Virtue in her bright record:</L>
<L>Nature's clear Mirror! Life's instructive Guide!</L>
<L>Her wisdom sour'd by no preceptive Pride!</L>
<L>Age from her lesson forms its wisest aim,</L>
<L N="100">And youthful Emulation springs to Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet thus adorn'd with noblest powers, design'd</L>
<L>To charm, correct, and elevate mankind,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
From darkest Time her humble Birth she drew,</L>
<L>And slowly into Strength and Beauty grew;</L>
<L N="105">As mighty streams, that roll with gather'd force,</L>
<L>Spring feebly forth from some sequester'd source.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fond desire to pass the nameless crowd,</L>
<L>Swept from the earth in dark Oblivion's cloud;</L>
<L>Of transient life to leave some little trace,</L>
<L N="110">And win remembrance from the rising race,</L>
<L>Led early Chiefs to make their prowess known</L>
<L>By the rude symbol on the artless stone:</L>
<L>And, long ere man the wondrous secret found,</L>
<L>To paint the voice, and fix the fleeting sound,</L>
<L N="115">The infant Muse, ambitious at her birth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 115. See NOTE VI.</NOTE></L>
<L>Rose the young herald of heroic worth.</L>
<L>The tuneful record of her oral praise,</L>
<L>The Sire's atchievements to the Son conveys:</L>
<L>Keen Emulation, wrapt in trance sublime,</L>
<L N="120">Drinks with retentive ear the potent rhyme;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
And faithful Memory, from affection strong,</L>
<L>Spreads the rich torrent of her martial song.</L>
<L>Letters at length arise; but envious Night</L>
<L>Conceals their blest Inventor from our sight.</L>
<L N="125">O'er the wide earth his spreading bounty flew,</L>
<L>And swift those precious seeds of Science grew;</L>
<L>Thence quickly sprung the Annal's artless frame,</L>
<L>Time its chief boast! and brevity its aim!</L>
<L>The Temple-wall preserv'd a simple date,</L>
<L N="130">And mark'd in plainest form the Monarch's fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But in the center of those vast abodes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 131. See NOTE VII.</NOTE></L>
<L>Whose mighty mass the land of Egypt loads;</L>
<L>Where, in rude triumph over years unknown,</L>
<L>Gigantic Grandeur, from his spiry throne,</L>
<L N="135">Seems to look down disdainful, and deride</L>
<L>The poor, the pigmy toils of modern Pride;</L>
<L>In the close covert of those gloomy cells,</L>
<L>Where early Magic fram'd her venal spells,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Combining priests, from many an ancient tale,</L>
<L N="140">Wove for their hallow'd use Religion's veil;</L>
<L>A wondrous texture! supple, rich, and broad,</L>
<L>To dazzle Folly, and to shelter Fraud!</L>
<L>This, as her caestus, Superstition wore;</L>
<L>And saw th' enchanted world its powers adore:</L>
<L N="145">For in the mystic web was every charm</L>
<L>To lure the timid, and the bold disarm;</L>
<L>To win from easy Faith a blind esteem,</L>
<L>And lull Devotion in a lasting dream.</L>
<L>The Sorceress, to spread her empire, drest</L>
<L N="150">History's young form in this illusive vest,</L>
<L>Whose infant voice repeated, as she taught,</L>
<L>The motley fables on her mantle wrought;</L>
<L>Till Attic Freedom brought the Foundling home</L>
<L>From the dark cells of her Egyptian dome;</L>
<L N="155">Drew by degrees th' oppressive veil aside,</L>
<L>And, shewing the fair Nymph in nature's pride,</L>
<L>Taught her to speak, with all the fire of youth,</L>
<L>The words of Wisdom in the tone of Truth;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
To catch the passing shew of public life,</L>
<L N="160">And paint immortal scenes of Grecian strife.</L>
<L>Inchanting Athens! oft as Learning calls</L>
<L>Our fond attention to thy fost'ring walls,</L>
<L>Still with fresh joy thy glories we explore,</L>
<L>With new idolatry thy charms adore.</L>
<L N="165">Bred in thy bosom, the Historian caught</L>
<L>The warmest glow of elevated thought.</L>
<L>Yet while thy triumphs to his eye display,</L>
<L>The noblest scene his pencil can portray;</L>
<L>While thy rich language, grac'd by every Muse,</L>
<L N="170">Supplies the brightest tints, his hand can use;</L>
<L>How small their band, who, in thy happier days,</L>
<L>Reach the bright summit of historic praise!</L>
<L>'Tis thus with every Art, in every age,</L>
<L>From the mechanic to the moral sage:</L>
<L N="175">Excelling merit is by nature rare:</L>
<L>Millions contend for crowns they cannot wear.</L>
<L>Coy Science, in her scene of wide command,</L>
<L>Bestows her honours with a sparing hand;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Like CHARLEMAIN's proud host, her vassal crew</L>
<L N="180">No tongue can count—Her paladins are few.</L>

<L>Pure, faultless writing, like transmuted gold,</L>
<L>Mortals may wish, but never shall behold:</L>
<L>Let Genius still this glorious object own,</L>
<L>And seek Perfection's philosophic stone!</L>
<L N="185">For while the mind, in study's toilsome hours,</L>
<L>Tries on the long research her latent powers,</L>
<L>New wonders rise, to pay her patient thought,</L>
<L>Inferior only to the prize she sought.</L>
</LG>

<L>But idle Pride no arduous labor sees,</L>
<L N="190">And deems th' Historian's toil a task of ease:</L>

<L><HI>Yet one excelling Greek, &amp;c.</HI>]</L>
<P>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the celebrated historian and critic of the Augustan age, who settled in Italy, as he himself informs us, on the close of the civil war. He has addressed a little treatise, contain∣ing a critique on the elder historians, to his friend Cnaeus Pompeius, whom the French cri∣tics suppose to be Pompey the Great; but Reiske, the last editor of Dionysius, has sunk him into a petty Greek grammarian, the client or freed∣man of that illustrious Roman.</P>
<P>In this treatise of Dionysius, and in one still longer, on the character of Thucydides, there are some excellent historical precepts, which Mr. Spelman has judiciously thrown together in the preface to his admirable translation of the Roman Antiquities.—He introduces them by the fol∣lowing observation, which may serve perhaps to recommend the subject of the present poem.—<Q REND="inline">"So much has been said, both by the antients
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
and the moderns, in praise of the advantages re∣sulting from the study of History, particularly by Diodorus Siculus among the former, in the noble preface to his Historical Collections; and by the late Lord Bolingbroke, among the mo∣derns, in his admirable letter on that subject; that I am astonished no treatise has ever yet ap∣peared in any age, or any language, professedly written to prescribe rules for writing History; a work allowed to be of the greatest advan∣tage of all others to mankind, the repository of truth, fraught with lessons both of public and private virtue, and enforced by stronger motives than precepts—by examples. Rules for Poetry and Rhetoric have been written by many au∣thors, both antient and modern, as if delight and eloquence were of greater consequence than instruction: however, Rhetoric was a part of History, as treated by the antients; not the principal part indeed, but subservient to the prin∣cipal; and calculated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration. I know it may be said, that many antient histories are still preserved, and
<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
that these models are sufficient guides for mo∣dern Historians, without particular rules: so had the Greeks Poets of all denominations in their hands, and yet Aristotle thought it necessary to prescribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying those examples to every branch of Poetry: I wish he had done the same in History; if he had, it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered the best of our modern Histories more perfect, and the worst, less abo∣minable.—Since the resurrection of letters, the want of such a guide has been complained of by many authors, and particularly by Rapin, in the preface to his History of England."</Q><BIBL>—Spelman, page 15.</BIBL>—But this ingenious and learned wri∣ter speaks a little too strongly, in saying no treatise has ever appeared in any age or language, con∣taining rules for History. There is one in Latin by the celebrated Vossius, entitled Ars Histori∣ca; another by Hubertus Folieta, an elegant Latin writer, of the 16th century, on whom Thuanus bestows the highest commendation; and Mascardi, an Italian critic, patronised by
<PB N="95" REF="95"/>
Cardinal Mazarine, has written also dell Arte Historica. The curious reader may find a sin∣gular anecdote relating to the publication of this work in Bayle, under the article Mascardi.—But to return to Dionysius. In comparing Hero∣dotus and Thucydides, he censures the latter with a degree of severity unwarranted by truth and reason: indeed this severity appeared so striking to the learned Fabricius, that he seems to consider it as a kind of proof, that the cri∣tical works of Dionysius were composed in the hasty fervor of youth. They are however in general, to use the words of the same ingenious author, eximia &amp; lectu digna; and a valuable critic of our own country, who resembles Diony∣sius in elegance of composition, and perhaps in severity of judgment, has spoken yet more warm∣ly in their favour.—<BIBL>See Warton's Essay on Pope, 3d edit. page 175.</BIBL></P>

<L><HI>In Egypt once a dread tribunal stood.</HI>]</L>
<P>This singular institution, which is alluded to by many of our late authors, is related at large in the First Book of Diodorus Siculus; and as the passage is curious, the following free translation of it may afford entertainment to the English reader—<Q REND="inline">"Those who prepare to bury a relation, give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges, and to all the friends of the deceased; informing them, that the body will pass over the

lake of that district to which the dead belonged: when, on the judges being assembled, to the num∣ber of more than forty, and ranging themselves in a semicircle on the farther side of the lake, the vessel is set afloat, which those who superin∣tend the funeral have prepared for this purpose. This vessel is managed by a pilot, called in the Egyptian language Charon; and hence they say, that Orpheus, travelling in old times into Egypt, and seeing this ceremony, formed his fable of the infernal regions, partly from what he saw, and partly from invention. The vessel being launch∣ed on the lake, before the coffin which contains the body is put on board, the law permits all, who are so inclined, to produce an accusation against it.—If any one steps forth, and proves that the deceased has led an evil life, the judges pronounce sentence, and the body is precluded from burial; but if the accuser is convicted of injustice in his charge, he falls himself under a considerable pe∣nalty. When no accuser appears, or when the accuser is proved to be an unfair one, the rela∣tions, who are assembled, change their expressions

of sorrow into encomiums on the dead: yet they do not, like the Greeks, speak in honour of his family, because they consider all Egyptians as equally well-born; but they set forth the educa∣tion and manners of his youth, his piety and jus∣tice in maturer life, his moderation, and every virtue by which he was distinguished; and they supplicate the infernal Deities to receive him as an associate among the blest. The multitude join their acclamations of applause in this cele∣bration of the dead, whom they consider as going to pass an eternity among the just be∣low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Diodor.

<P>This account of the Pyramids I have adopted from the very learned Mr. Bryant, part of whose inge∣nious observation upon them I shall here present to the reader.—</P>
<P>One great purpose in all eminent and expensive structures is to please the stranger and traveller, and to win their admiration. This is effected sometimes by a mixture of magnificence and beauty: at other times solely by immensity and grandeur. The latter seems to have been the object in the erecting of those celebrated build∣ings in Egypt: and they certainly have answered the design. For not only the vastness of their structure, and the area which they occupy, but the ages they have endured, and the very uncer∣tainty of their history, which runs so far back into the depths of antiquity, produce all together a wonderful veneration; to which buildings more
<PB N="102" REF="102"/>
exquisite and embellished are seldom entitled. Many have supposed, that they were designed for places of sepulture: and it has been affirmed by Herodotus, and other antient writers. But they spoke by guess: and I have shewn by many instances, how usual it was for the Gre∣cians to mistake temples for tombs. If the chief Pyramid were designed for a place of burial, what occasion was there for a well, and for pas∣sages of communication which led to other build∣ings? Near the Pyramids are apartments of a wonderful fabric, which extend in length one thousand four hundred feet, and about thirty in depth. They have been cut out of the hard rock, and brought to a perpendicular by the artist's chizel; and through dint of labour fashioned as they now appear. They were undoubtedly de∣signed for the reception of priests; and conse∣quently were not appendages to a tomb, but to a temple of the Deity . . . . . . The priests of Egypt delighted in obscurity; and they probably came by the subterraneous passages of the build∣ing to the dark chambers within; where they per∣formed
<PB N="103" REF="103"/>
their lustrations, and other nocturnal rites. Many of the antient temples in this country were caverns in the rock, enlarged by art, and cut out into numberless dreary apartments: for no nation upon earth was so addicted to gloom and melancholy as the Egyptians.—<BIBL>BRYANT's Analysis, Vol. III.

<P>There is hardly any author, antient or mo∣dern, who has been more warmly commended, or more vehemently censured, than this eminent Historian. But even the severe Dionysius de∣clares, he is one of those enchanting writers, whom you peruse to the last syllable with plea∣sure, and still wish for more.—Plutarch himself, who has made the most violent attack on his veracity, allows him all the merit of beautiful composition. From the heavy charges brought against him by the antients, the famous Henry Stephens, and his learned friend Camerarius, have defended their favourite Historian with great spi∣rit. But Herodotus has found a more formidable antagonist in a learned and animated writer of our own times, to whom the public have been lately indebted for his having opened to them new mines of Oriental learning.—If the ingeni∣ous Mr. Richardson could effectually support his Persian system, the great Father of the Gre∣cian story must sink into a fabulist as low in point

but he is said to have lived happily to an ad∣vanced age with his wife, the amiable daughter of the virtuous Agricola, whose life he has so beautifully written. By this lady he is supposed to have left children; and the emperor Tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote descendant from the Historian, to whose works and memo∣ry he paid the highest regard.—It is reported by Sidonius Apollinaris, that Tacitus recommended the province of writing History to Pliny the Younger, and that he did not himself engage in that employment, till his friend had declined it. This is not mentioned, indeed, in any of the beautiful letters still remaining from Pliny to Ta∣citus; but it is an instance of delicacy not unpa∣rallel'd among the Antients, as will appear from the following remark by one of the most elegant and liberal of modern critics.—<Q REND="inline">"The Roman Poet, who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character, affords per∣haps the most remarkable instance that any where occurs, of the concessions which a mind strongly impregnated with sentiments of genuine

Virgil's superior ta∣lents rendered him qualified to excel in all the no∣bler species of poetical composition: nevertheless, from the most uncommon delicacy of friendship, he sacrificed to his intimacy with Horace, the unrivall'd reputation he might have acquired by indulging his lyric vein; as from the same refined motive he forbore to exercise his dramatic pow∣ers, that he might not obscure the glory of his friend Varius.<Q><L>Aurum et opes et rura, frequens donabit amicus:</L>

<P>As to Tacitus, it is clear, I think, from the Letters of Pliny, as well as from his own most pleasing Life of Agricola, that he possessed all the refined and affectionate feelings of the heart in a very high degree, though the general cast of his historical works might lead us to imagine that austerity was his chief characteristic.—It would be easy to fill a volume in transcribing the great

<HEAD>THE PREFACE OF THE PRINCESS ANNA COMNENA,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM THE GREEK,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Prefixed to her ALEXIAD, or History of her Fa∣ther the Emperor ALEXIUS.</HEAD>
<P>TIME, which flows irresistibly, ever encroach∣ing, and stealing something from human life, seems to bear away all that is mortal into a gulph of darkness; sometimes destroying such things as deserve not utterly to be forgotten, and sometimes, such as are most noble, and most worthy of re∣membrance. Now (to use the words of the tragic poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sophocles.</NOTE>)
<Q><L>Discovering things invisible; and now</L>
<L>Sweeping each present object from our sight.</L></Q>
But History forms the strongest barrier against this tide of Time: it withstands, in some measure, the violence of the torrent, and, by collecting and ce∣menting such things as appear worthy of preserva∣tion,
<PB N="125" REF="125"/>
while they are hurried along the stream, it al∣lows them not to sink into the abyss of oblivion.</P>
<P>On this consideration, I Anna, the daughter of the emperor Alexius, and his consort Irene, born and educated in imperial splendor—not utterly void of literature, and solicitous to distinguish myself by that Grecian characteristic—as I have already ap∣plied myself to Rhetoric, and having thoroughly studied the Principles of Aristotle and the Dia∣logues of Plato, have endeavoured to adorn my mind with the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Astrology, Geometry, Arithmetic, and Music.</NOTE>four usual branches of education (for I think it incumbent on me, even at the risque of appearing vain, to declare what qualifications for the present task I have received from nature, or gained by application; what Providence has bestowed upon me, or time and opportunity sup∣plied.) On these accounts, I am desirous of com∣memorating, in my present work, the actions of my father, as they deserve not to be buried in si∣lence, or to be plunged, as it were, by the tide of Time, into the ocean of Oblivion: both those ac∣tions
<PB N="126" REF="126"/>
which he performed after he obtained the di∣adem, and those before that period, while he was himself a subject of other Princes. I engage in this narration, not so much to display any little ta∣lent for composition, as to prevent transactions of such importance from perishing unrecorded: since even the brightest of human atchievements, if not consigned to memory under the guard of writing, are extinguished, as it were, by the Darkness of Silence.</P>
<P>My father was a man, who knew both how to govern, and to pay to governors a becoming obe∣dience: but in chusing his actions for my subject, I am apprehensive, in the very outset of my work, lest I may be censured as the Panegyrist of my own family for writing of my father; that if I speak of him with admiration, my whole History will be considered as a false and flattering encomium; and if any circumstance, I may have occasion to mention, leads me, as it were by force, to disap∣prove some part even of his conduct, I am appre∣hensive, on the other hand, not from the cha∣racter
<PB N="127" REF="127"/>
of my father, but from the very nature of things, that some malignant censurers may com∣pare me to Cham, the son of Noah; since there are many, whom envy and malevolence will not suffer to form a fair judgment, and who, to speak in the words of Homer,
<Q><L>Are keen to censure, where no blame is due.</L></Q>
For whoever engages in the province of History, is bound to forget all sentiments both of favour and aversion; and often to adorn his enemies with the highest commendations, when their actions are entitled to such reward; and often to censure his most intimate friends, when the failings of their life and manners require it.—These are duties equally incumbent on the Historian, which he cannot decline. As to myself, with regard to those who may be affected either by my censure or my praise, I would wish to assure them, that I speak both of them, and their conduct, according to the evidence of their actions themselves, or the report of those who beheld them; for either the fathers, or the grandfathers, of many persons now living
<PB N="128" REF="128"/>
were ocular witnesses of what I shall record. I have been chiefly led to engage in this History of my father by the following circumstance:—It was my fortune to marry Caesar Nicephorus, of the Bryennian family, a man far superior to all his cotemporaries, not only in personal beauty, but in sublimity of understanding, and all the charms of eloquence! for he was equally the ad∣miration of those who saw, and those who heard him. But that my discourse may not wander from its present purpose, let me proceed in my narration!—He was then, among all men, the most distin∣guished; and when he marched with the emperor John Comnenus, my brother, on his expedition against Antioch, and other places in possession of the Barbarians, still unable to abstain from litera∣ry pursuits, even in those scenes of labour and fatigue, he wrote various compositions worthy of remembrance and of honour. But he chiefly ap∣plied himself to the writing an account of what re∣lated to my father Alexius, emperor of the Ro∣mans, at the request of the empress; reducing in∣to
<PB N="129" REF="129"/>
proper form the transactions of his reign, whenever the times would allow him to devote short intervals of leisure from arms and battle to works of literature, and the labour of composi∣tion. In forming this History, he deduced his ac∣counts from an early period, being directed in this point also by the instruction of our royal mis∣tress; beginning from the emperor Diogenes, and descending to the person, whom he had chosen for the Hero of his Drama—for this season first shew∣ed my father to be a youth of expectation. Be∣fore this period he was a mere infant; and of course performed nothing worthy of being recor∣ded: unless even the occurrences of his childhood should be thought a fit subject for History. Such then was the design and scope of Caesar's compo∣sition: but he failed in the hope he had entertain∣ed, of bringing his History to its conclusion: for having brought it to the times of the emperor Nicephorus Botoniates, he there broke off, ha∣ving no future opportunity allowed him of conti∣nuing his narration: a circumstance which has
<PB N="130" REF="130"/>
proved a severe loss to Literature, and robbed his readers of delight!—On this account I have un∣dertaken to record the actions of my father, that such atchievements may not escape posterity. What degree of harmony and grace the writings of Caesar possessed, all persons know who have been fortunate enough to see his compositions. But having executed his work to the period I have mentioned, in the midst of hurry and fa∣tigue, and bringing it to us half finished from his expedition, he brought home, alas! at the same time, a disorder that proved mortal, contracted perhaps from the hardships of his passage, or per∣haps from that harrassing scene of perpetual ac∣tion, and possibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account; for anxiety was natural to his affectionate heart, and his labours were without intermission. Moreover, the change and badness of climates might prepare for him this draught of death. For notwithstanding the dreadful state of his health, he persevered in the campaign against the Syrians and Cilicians, till at length he was
<PB N="131" REF="131"/>
conveyed out of Syria in a most infirm state, and was brought through Cilicia, Pamphilia, Lydia, and Bithynia, home to the metropolis of the em∣pire, and to his family. But his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue.—Even in this state of weakness he was desirous of displaying the events of his expedition: but this his disorder rendered him unable to execute, and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it, lest by the effort of such a narration he should burst open his wound.—But in the recollection of these things, my whole soul is darkened, and my eyes are co∣vered with a flood of tears.—O what a director of the Roman counsels was then torn from us! O what an end was there to all the treasures of clear, of various, and of useful knowledge, which he had collected from observation and experi∣ence, both in regard to foreign affairs, and the internal business of the empire!—O what a form was then destroyed!—Beauty, that seemed not only entitled to dominion, but bearing even the semblance of divinity!—I indeed have been con∣versant
<PB N="132" REF="132"/>
with every calamity; and have found, even from the imperial cradle, an unpropitious fortune: some perhaps might esteem that fortune not unpropitious, which seemed to smile upon my birth, in giving me sovereigns for my parents, and nursing me in the imperial purple: but for the other circumstances of my life, alas, what tempests! alas, what perturbations! The melody of Orpheus affected even inanimate nature; and Timotheus, in playing the Orthic song to Alexan∣der, made the Macedon start to arms.</P>
<P>The relation of my miseries would not, indeed, produce such effects; but it would move every auditor to tears; it would force not only beings endued with sensibility, but even inanimate nature to sympathize in my sorrow.—This remembrance of Caesar, and his unexpected death, tears open the deepest wound of my soul: indeed I consider all my former misfortunes, if compared to this immea∣sureable calamity, but as a drop of water to the Atlantic sea; or rather my earlier afflictions were a kind of prelude to this: they first involved
<PB N="133" REF="133"/>
me, as it were, like a smoke preceding this raging fire; they were a kind of heat, that portended a conflagration, which no words can describe. O thou fire, that blazest without fuel, preying on my heart without destroying its existence; piercing through my very bones, and shrinking up my soul!—But I perceive myself hurried away from my subject: this mention of Caesar, and what I suffer in his loss, has led me into the prolixity of grief: wiping therefore the tear from my eyes, and restraining myself from this indul∣gence of sorrow, I will proceed in order; yet, as the tragic Poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Euripides.</NOTE></P>
<P>says,
<Q><L>Still adding tear to tear,</L></Q>
as recollecting misfortune after misfortune: for the entering on the History of such a king, so eminent for his virtues, revives in my mind all the wonders he performed, which move me to fresh tears; and these I share in common with all the world: for the remembrance of him, and the
<PB N="134" REF="134"/>
recital of his reign, supplies to me a new subject of lamentation, and must remind others of the loss they have sustained.</P>
<P>But let me at length begin the History of my father, from the period most proper:—now the most proper period is that, which will give to my narration the clearest and most historical ap∣pearance.—</P>

<P>It is now generally agreed, that the History which bears the name of Turpin, Archbishop of Rheims, was the forgery of a Monk, at the time of the Crusades; though Pope Calixtus the Second de∣clared it to be authentic.—But, as it was cer∣tainly intended to pass as genuine History, when∣ever it was composed, and actually did so for some ages, this poetical mention of it appeared not improper. For the entertainment of the curious reader, I shall transcribe the two mira∣culous passages alluded to in the poem:—<Q REND="inline">Ante diem belli, castris et arietibus et turmis praepa∣ratis in pratis, scilicet quae sunt inter castrum,
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
quod dicitur Talaburgum, et urbem, juxta fluvi∣um Caranta, infixerunt Christiani quidam hastas suas erectas in terra ante castra; crastina verò die hastas suas corticibus &amp; frondibus decoratas in∣venerunt, hi scilicet qui in bello praesenti accep∣turi erant martyrii palmam pro Christi fide. Qui etiam tanto miraculo Dei gavisi, abscissis hastis suis de terra, simul coaduniti primitùs in bello perierunt, et multos Saracenos occiderunt, sed tandem martyrio coronantur.</Q>—Cap. X.</P>
<P>After the soliloquy of Roland, addressed to his sword, which most readers have seen quoted in Mr. Warton's excellent Observations on Spen∣ser, the Historian proceeds thus:—<Q REND="inline">Timens ne in manus Saracenorum deveniret, percussit spatâ lapidem marmoreum trino ictu; a summo usque deorsum lapis dividitur, &amp; gladius biceps illaesus educitur.—Deinde tubâ suâ coepit altisonâ to∣nitruare, si fortè aliqui ex Christianis, qui per nemora Saracenorum timore latitabant, ad se venirent; vel si illi, qui portus jam transierant,

<P>The celebrated Secretary and supposed Son-in-law of Charlemain; who is said to have been carried through the snow on the shoulders of the affec∣tionate and ingenious Imma, to prevent his being tracked from her apartment by the Emperor her father: a story which the elegant pen of Addison has copied and embellished from an old German Chronicle, and inserted in the 3d volume of the

<P>The first of the two excellent dissertations pre∣fixed to Mr. Warton's History of English Poe∣try, gives the most perfect account of this famous old Chronicler, and his whimsical performance.—<Q REND="inline">"About the year 1100, Gualter, Archdeacon of Oxford, a learned man, and a diligent collec∣tor of Histories, travelling through France, pro∣cured in Armorica an antient Chronicle, written in the British or Armorican language, intitled, <HI>Brut-y-Brenhined,</HI> or the History of the Kings of Britain. This book he brought into England, and communicated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth,
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
a Welsh Benedictine Monk, an elegant writer of Latin, and admirably skilled in the British tongue. Geoffrey, at the request and recommendation of Gualter the Archdeacon, translated this British Chronicle into Latin, executing the Translation with a tolerable degree of purity, and great fide∣lity, yet not without some interpolations.—It was probably finished after the year 1138."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"The simple subject of this Chronicle, divested of its romantic embellishments, is a deduction of the Welsh Princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cad∣wallader, who reigned in the seventh century."</Q> To this extract from Mr. Warton, it may be proper to add a concise account of that romantic embellishment, to which I have particularly al∣luded:—Uther Pendragon, at the festival of his coronation, falls in love with Igerna, the wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall; and being prevented from pursuing his addresses by the vigilance of the husband, he applies to the magical power of Mer∣lin for the completion of his desire.—This he ob∣tains, by being transformed into the person of

<P>William, surnamed of Malmesbury from being a member of that church, was a native of Somerset∣shire, and is supposed to have received his educa∣tion at Oxford. He is justly called, by almost every writer on English History, the most liberal and judicious of all our monastic Historians. His
<PB N="146" REF="146"/>
principal work is a History of our Kings, from the arrival of the Saxons to the 20th year of Henry the First. This was followed by two books of later History, which close with the cele∣brated escape of the Empress Matilda from the Castle of Oxford, 1142. These works are both addressed to that munificent patron of merit, Ro∣bert Earl of Gloucester, natural son of Henry the First; who was perhaps the most exalted and accomplished character that ever flourished in so barbarous an age. The Historian speaks of his noble friend with all the simplicity of truth, and all the warmth of virtuous admiration. He died, according to Pitts, in 1143, three years before his generous patron; and this is probable, from his not pursuing his History, which he intimates a design of resuming.—Yet there is a passage preserved in Tanner, from the Preface to his Comments on Jeremiah, which seems to prove, that he lived to a later period; since he mentions his historical works as the production of his younger days, and speaks of his age as devoted to
<PB N="147" REF="147"/>
religious composition. Besides his four books De gestis Pontificum Anglorum, he wrote many works of the same pious turn, which the curious reader may see enumerated in Tanner's Biblio∣theca.</P>

<P>Ismael Abul∣feda, descended from a brother of the great Sala∣din, and Prince of Hamah, a city of Syria, was born at Damascus, in the year of the Hegira 672, or according to the Christian aera 1273. His youth was devoted to the toils of martial life, and he seems to have been a brave and accomplished soldier; though his literary fame has eclipsed his military reputation.—The turbulent state of his country prevented his establishment in his here∣ditary dominion till the year 710, when the pos∣session of it was secured to him by the assistance of Al Malec Al Naser, sultan of Aegypt, from whom he afterwards received the highest ho∣nours;
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
of which his gratitude has left the follow∣ing particular description, inserted by the learned Schultens in his Preface to the Life of Saladin, as it gives great lustre to the character of our royal Historian.</P>

<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
his historical and geographical productions; and these, notwithstanding their acknowledged merit, have appeared only in selected fragments. So piti∣ful and precarious has been the encouragement which the most liberal nations of Europe have bestowed on oriental literature, that designs of publishing a complete edition of Abulfeda's geo∣graphy have been suffered to fail both in France and England. The honour of doing justice to this illustrious author seems to be reserved for Germany; where the learned Michaelis has lately published his description of Egypt, and intimates an intention of printing the other parts of this au∣thor. Of his general History, which he brought down to the latter years of his own life, different portions have been given to the public by different editors—his account of Mahomet, by Gagnier, printed at Oxford, in folio, 1723; his History of the Arabian Caliphs, to the year of the Hegira 406, by Reiske, printed at Leipsic 1754—and his narrative of all the circumstances relating to the great Saladin has been very properly annexed by
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>

Abulfeda, in this portion of his History, seems to dwell on the great character of Saladin with that ingenuous pride, which a generous mind must naturally feel in speaking of so noble an ances∣tor. He relates some anecdotes of that prince, not mentioned by his Biographer, highly expres∣sive of his animated and affectionate spirit; par∣ticularly a letter written immediately after the severe defeat which obliged him to fly from As∣calon into the deserts of Egypt: it was addressed to his brother, who commanded at Damascus, and opened with a quotation from an Arabian poet to this effect:<Q><L>My soul remembers thee with fond delight,</L>
<L>Amidst the horrors of the adverse fight,</L>
<L>When hostile Larces drink the gory flood,</L>
<L>And satiate in our veins their thirst of blood.</L></Q> In his account of the gentle disposition and refin∣ed manners of Saladin, he perfectly agrees with the Biographer of that monarch.—The gene∣rous

Abulfeda, so liberal in commemorating the merit of others, has not himself wanted an enco∣miast; for, according to Herbelot, his eulogy is contained in the works of an oriental Poet, whose name is Nobatah, and whose compositions may be found in the king of France's library.</P>

<P>I am unable to discover the name of this inhuman Prince, or that of his unfortunate Historian; but the fact is related on the authority of an Arabic writer, named Nouari, by M.

His words are—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nouari rapporte, que les Sultans de la dynastie des Almohades defendirent, sous peine de la vie, d' ecrire les Annales de leur régne; et qu'un Prince de cette maison fit périr un Auteur, pour avoir enfraint cette loi."</Q> As the Princes of this dynasty exerted their power both in Africa and Spain, this singular execution might happen

<P>The Univer∣sity of Corduba was founded by Al Hakem the Second, who died in the 336th year of the Hegira, after a reign of fifteen years and five months. He was the son and successor of the magnifi∣cent Abdelrahman the Third, who in a long and prosperous life had given stability and splendor to the Moorish empire in Spain. It is remark∣able, that many of these Arab Princes were not only protectors of literature, but often distinguish∣ed themselves by poetical composition. Nor were the Moorish Ladies less eager to cultivate the most elegant of mental accomplishments: Vala∣da, or Valadata, the daughter of the Prince who founded the University, was no less celebrated for her poetical talents, than for her singular beauty and exalted birth. She bestowed her protection
<PB N="155" REF="155"/>
on that seat of learning, which owed its rise to the liberality of her father; and the principal poets of the time are said to have formed her favourite society.</P>
<P>The Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana of Casiri, from whence I have drawn these particulars, con∣tains also a list of many female poets, who reflect∣ed honour on their native city of Corduba. One of the most eminent among these, was a Lady distinguished by the name of Aischa Bent, whose compositions, both in prose and verse, were pub∣licly recited in the Academy with universal ap∣plause; and who closed (says my Author) a single and chaste life, in the year of the Hegira 400, leaving many monuments of her own genius, as well as a rich and well-chosen library.</P>

<P>Bohaddin, or Bohadin (for his name is variously written), is conjectured by Schultens, his learned Translator, to have been an Assyrian by birth, and a native of
<PB N="156" REF="156"/>
Mosula, the metropolis of Mesopotamia; from whence, before he entered into the service of Sala∣din, he was sent embassador, as he himself relates, to the Caliph of Bagdad.—He seems to have been principally indebted to his talents as an Historian, for the protection and favour of that engaging hero, whose confidence he afterwards obtained, and whose splendid character he has so warmly celebrated. For as he was returning from Mecca to Mosula, he embraced an opportunity of present∣ing to Saladin an account of the holy war, as he terms it, which he had drawn up as he stopt at Damascus in the course of his pilgrimage, and in which he had described the administration and dis∣cipline of that monarch. He affirms that the Sultan perused his work with infinite satisfaction, and expressed the most eager desire to engage him in his service. The grateful Historian was no less inclined to devote himself to his generous and en∣thusiastic patron.—From this period he seems to have been a favourite companion of his warlike master; to have shared many of his dangers, as
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
well as his most secret counsels; and to have served him, with a most zealous and affectionate attachment, to the hour of his death—an event of which he speaks with the affecting simplicity of real sorrow. In mentioning the oriental custom of washing the body of the deceased, he records the name of the minister who performed the ceremo∣ny; and adds, that he had himself engaged in this mournful office, but was obliged to retire, on feel∣ing himself unequal to so painful a scene.—The work of this interesting Biographer is divided in∣to two parts: the first exhibits a general charac∣ter of the hero, with particular examples of his va∣rious virtues and endowments; the second gives a chronological account of his adventures, from his first expedition into Egypt to the close of his life; but passing lightly over his other exploits, dwells chiefly on the transactions of the holy war; and discovers such marks of religious zeal, that Schul∣tens very shrewdly supposes the author to have been a priest, from the manner in which he lavishes his maledictions. It is just, however, to observe, that
<PB N="158" REF="158"/>
he speaks very liberally on the martial merit of his Christian enemies; and there is one passage in his history, in which he pays a very pleasing and pa∣thetic compliment to the universal philanthropy of the Sultan: it is in relating an anecdote which affords so interesting a picture, that I cannot help presenting it to my reader:</P>
<P>In the army of Saladin there were some dexte∣rous robbers, who used to penetrate by night into the camp of the Christians, and present to the Sul∣tan, on their return, such booty as they had been able to bring off; which he bestowed upon them, as a reward of their valour. In one of their nightly excursions they happened to seize an in∣fant of three months: the mother, robbed of her little one, spent the night in the most bitter lamen∣tations, and related her misfortune to the Christian leaders. They answered, The Sultan is com∣passionate, and we therefore give you permission to depart, and petition him for your child, which he will certainly restore.—Approaching our guard, she relates her story, and implores their assistance. They give her access to the Sultan, to whom, as
<PB N="159" REF="159"/>
he was riding, attended by myself and others, she presented herself bathed in tears, and prostrate in the dust. He enquires the cause of her affliction:—she repeats her story:—the Sultan is moved even to tears, and orders the child to be produced. On finding that it had been publicly sold, he commands it to be redeemed; and rested not till he saw the infant delivered to its mother. Receiv∣ing it with a profusion of tears, she prest it to her bosom—the surrounding spectators (and I hap∣pened to be among them) wept with her—she then gave her breast to the infant; after which the Sultan directed her to be seated on horseback with her little one, and safely escorted to her own quar∣ters. Consider (exclaims the affectionate and re∣ligious Historian) this example of universal bene∣volence! Such, O God! hast thou created this merciful sovereign, to appear most worthy of thy own infinite mercy.—Consider this testimony, which even his enemies have borne of his com∣passionate and generous disposition! <BIBL>BOHAD.

<L><HI>A faithful Chronicler in plain Froissart.</HI>]</L>
<P>John Froissart, Canon and Treasurer of the collegiate church of Chimay, in Henault, was born at Va∣lenciennes, a city of that province, in 1337, ac∣cording to the conjecture of that elaborate and in∣genious antiquarian Mr. de St. Palaye; who has amply illustrated the Life and Writings of this engaging Historian, in a series of dissertations among the Memoirs of the French Academy, Vol. X. XIII. XIV.—St. Palaye imagines, from a passage in the MS Poems of Froissart, that his father was a painter of Armories—and it is certain the Historian discovers a passion for all the pomp and all the minutiae of heraldry: it was indeed the favourite study of that martial age; and Froissart, more the priest of gallantry than of reli∣gion, devoted himself entirely to the celebration of love and war.—At the age of 20, he began to write History, at the request <HI>de son cher Seigneur &amp; Maitre Messire</HI> Robert de Namur, Chevalier Seigneur de Beaufort.—The anguish of unsuc∣cessful
<PB N="161" REF="161"/>
love drove him early into England, and his first voyage seems a kind of emblem of his future life; for he sailed hither in a storm, yet continued writing a rondeau in spite of the tem∣pest, till he found himself on that coast, ou l'on aime mieux la guerre, que la paix, &amp; ou les es∣trangers sont très bien venus, as he said of our country <HI>in his verses,</HI> and happily experienced in his kind reception at court, where Philippa of He∣nault, the Queen of Edward the Third, and a Pa∣troness of learning, distinguished the young His∣torian, her countryman, by the kindest protec∣tion; and, finding that love had rendered him un∣happy, supplied him with money and with horses, that he might present himself with every advan∣tage before the object of his passion.—Love soon escorted him to his mistress—but his addresses were again unsuccessful; and, taking a second voyage to England, he became Secretary to his royal patroness Philippa, in 1361, after having pre∣sented to her some portion of his History.—He continued five years in her service, entertaining
<PB N="162" REF="162"/>
her majesty <HI>de beaux dictiez &amp; traictez amoureux:</HI> in this period he paid a visit to Scotland, and was entertained 15 days by William earl Douglas.—In 1366, when Edward the Black Prince was preparing for the war in Spain, Froissart was with him in Gascony, and hoped to attend him during the whole course of that important expedition:—but the Prince sent him back to the Queen his mother.—He continued not long in England, as he visited many of the Italian courts in the follow∣ing year; and during his travels sustained the irre∣parable loss of that patroness, to whose bounty he had been so much indebted.—Philippa died 1369, and Froissart is reported to have written the life of his amiable protectress; but of this performance the researches of St. Palaye could discover no trace.</P>
<P>After this event, he retired to his own country, and obtained the benefice of Lestines, in the dio∣cese of Cambray.—But the cure of souls was an office little suited to the gay and gallant Froissart.—His genius led him still to travel from castle to
<PB N="163" REF="163"/>
castle, and from court to court, to use the words of Mr. Warton, who has made occasional mention of our author, in his elegant History of English Poetry.—Froissart now entered into the service of the Duke of Brabant; and, as that Prince was himself a poet, Froissart collected all the composi∣tions of his master, and adding some of his own, formed a kind of romance, which he calls
<Q><L>Un Livre de Meliador</L>
<L>Le Chevalier au soleil d'or,</L></Q>
and of which, in one of his later poems, he gives the following account:<Q><L>Dedans ce Romant sont encloses</L>
<L>Toutes les chançons que jadis,</L>
<L>Dont l'ame soit en paradis,</L>
<L>Que fit le bon Duc de Braibant,</L>
<L>Wincelaus, dont on parla tant;</L>
<L>Car un prince fu amorous,</L>
<L>Gracious &amp; chevalerous,</L>
<L>Et le livre me fit ja faire,</L>
<L>Par très grant amoureus à faire,</L>
<L>Coment qu'il ne le veist oncques.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="164"/>
The Duke died in 1384, before this work was completed; and Froissart soon found a new patron in Guy earl of Blois, on the marriage of whose Son he wrote a Pastoral, entitled Le Tem∣ple d'Honneur.—The Earl having requested him to resume his History, he travelled for that pur∣pose to the celebrated court of Gaston earl of Foix, whose high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his residence, at Orlaix, those martial adventurers, from whose mouth it was the delight of Froissart to collect the materials of his History.—The courteous Gaston gave him the most flat∣tering reception: he said to him with a smile (&amp; en bon François) <Q REND="inline">"qu'il le connoissoit bien, quoyqu'il ne l'eust jamais veu, mais qu'il avoit bien oui parler de luy, &amp; le retint de son hostel."</Q>—It became a favourite amusement of the Earl, to hear Froissart read his Romance of Meliador after supper.—He attended in the castle every night at 12, when the Earl sate down to table, listened to him with extreme attention, and never dismissed him, till he had made him vuider tout ce
<PB N="165" REF="165"/>
qui estoit resté du vin de sa bouche.—Froissart gained much information here, not only from his patron, who was himself very communicative, but from various Knights of Arragon and Eng∣land, in the retinue of the Duke of Lancaster, who then resided at Bourdeaux.—After a long residence in this brilliant court, and after receiv∣ing a present from the liberal Gaston, which he mentions in the following verses—<Q><L>Je pris congé &amp; li bons Contes</L>
<L>Me fit par sa chambre des comptes</L>
<L>Delivrer quatrevins florins</L>
<L>D'Arragon, tous pesans &amp; fins</L>
<L>Et mon livre, qu'il m'ot laissé—</L></Q> Froissart departed in the train of the Countess of Boulogne, related to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Foix, and just leaving him, to join her new husband the Duke of Berry.—In this expedition our Historian was robbed near Avignon, and laments the unlucky adventure in a very long poem, from which Mr. de St Palaye has drawn many particu∣lars
<PB N="166" REF="166"/>
of his life. The ground-work of this poem (which is not in the list of our Author's poetical pieces, that Mr. Warton has given us from Pas∣quier) seems to have a strong vein of humour.—It is a dialogue between the Poet and the sin∣gle Florin that he has left, out of the many which he had either spent, or been obliged to surrender to the robbers.—He represents himself as a man of the most expensive turn: in 25 years he had squandered two thousand franks, besides his eccle∣siastical revenues. The composition of his works had cost him 700; but he regretted not this sum, as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the praise of posterity.</P>
<P>After having attended all the festivals on the marriage of the Duke of Berry, having traversed many parts of France, and paid a visit to Zeland, he returned to his own country in 1390, to con∣tinue his History from the various materials he had collected.—But not satisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in Spain, he went to Middlebourgh in Zeland, in pursuit of a Portu∣guese
<PB N="167" REF="167"/>
Knight, Jean Ferrand Portelet, vaillant homme &amp; sage, &amp; du Conseil du Roy de Portu∣gal. From this accomplished soldier Froissart expected the most perfect information, as an ocu∣lar witness of those scenes which he now wished to record.—The courteous Portelet received our indefatigable Historian with all the kindness which his enthusiasm deserved; and in six days, which they passed together, gave him all the intelligence he desired.—Froissart now returned home, and finished the third book of his History.—Many years had past since he had bid adieu to Eng∣land. Taking advantage of the truce then esta∣blished between France and that country, he paid it another visit in 1395, with letters of re∣commendation to the King and his uncles.—From Dover he proceeded to Canterbury, to pay his devoirs at the shrine of Thomas of Becket, and to the memory of the Black Prince.—Here he happened to find the son of that hero, the young King Richard, whom devotion had also brought to make his offerings to the fashionable Saint,
<PB N="168" REF="168"/>
and return thanks to Heaven for his successes in Ireland.—Froissart speaks of this adventure, and his own feelings on the great change of scene that had taken place since his last visit to England, in the following natural and lively terms:<Q REND="inline">—Le Roy . . . vint . . a trez grant arroy, et bien accompaigne de seigneurs, de dames, et demoi∣selles, et me mis entre eulx, &amp; entre elles, et tout me sembla nouvel, ne je ny congnoissoye per∣sonne; car le tems estoit bien change en Angle∣terre depuis le tems de vingt &amp; huyt ans: et en la compagnie du roy n'avoit nuls de ses oncles . . . . si fus du premier ainsi que tout esbahy . . .</Q> Tho' Froissart was thus embarrassed in not finding one of his old friends in the reti∣nue of the King, he soon gained a new Patron in Thomas Percy, Master of the Household, who offered to present him and his letters to Richard; but this offer happening on the eve of the King's departure, it proved too late for the ceremony—<Q REND="inline">Le Roy estoit retrait pour aller dormir.</Q>—And on the morrow, when the impatient Historian at∣tended
<PB N="169" REF="169"/>
early at the Archbishop's palace, where the King slept, his friend Percy advised him to wait a more convenient season for being intro∣duced to Richard.—Froissart acquiesced in this advice, and was consoled for his disappointment by falling into company with an English Knight, who had attended the King in Ireland, and was very willing to gratify the curiosity of the Histo∣rian by a relation of his adventures.—This was William de Lisle, who entertained him, as they rode along together, with the marvels of St. Pa∣trick's Cave, in which he assured him he had passed a night, and seen wonderful visions.—Though our honest Chronicler is commonly ac∣cused of a passion for the marvellous, with an ex∣cess of credulity, he says very sensibly on this oc∣casion, <Q REND="inline">de cette matiere je ne luy parlay plus avant, et m'en cessay, car voulentiers je luy eusse demande du voyage d'Irlande, et luy eu voulaye parler, et mettre en voye.</Q>—It appears plainly from this passage, that our Historian was more anxious to gain information concerning
<PB N="170" REF="170"/>
the scenes of real action, than to listen to the ex∣travagant fictions of a popular legend.—But here he was again disappointed.—New companions joined them on the road, and their historical con∣ference was thus interrupted.—These mortifica∣tions were soon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the Duke of York, who said to him, when he received the recommendatory let∣ter from the Earl of Henault, <Q REND="inline">"Maistre Jehan tenez vous toujours deles nous, &amp; nos gens, nous vous ferons tout amour &amp; courtoisie, nous y sommes tenus pour l'amour du tems passé &amp; de notre dame de mere à qui vous futes; nous en avons bien la souvenance."</Q>—With these flatter∣ing marks of remembrance and favour, the Duke presented him to the <Q REND="inline">King, lequel me receut joyeusement et doulcement (continues Frois∣sart) . . et ne dist que je fusse le bien venus et si j'avoye este de l'hostel du Roy son Ayeul &amp; de Madame son Ayeule encores estoys je de l'hostel d'Angleterre.</Q>—Some time however elapsed, before he had an opportunity of presenting his
<PB N="171" REF="171"/>
romance of Meliador, which he had prepared for the King.—The Duke of York and his other friends at length obtained for him this honour. He gives the following curious and particular account of the ceremony: <Q REND="inline">Et voulut veoir le Roy mon livre, que je luy avoye apporte. Si le vit en sa chambre: car tout pourveu je l'avoye, et luy mis fur son lict. Et lors il l'ouvrit et regarda dedans, et luy pleut tres grandement. Et plaire bien luy devoit: car il estoit enlumine, escrit et Historie, &amp; couvert de vermeil veloux a dix cloux d'argent dorez d'or et roses d'or ou meillieu a deux gros fermaulx dorez et richement ouvrez ou meillieu rosiers d'or. Adonc me de∣manda le Roy de quoy il traictoit: et je luy dis d'amours. De ceste responce fut tout resjouy, et regarda dedans le livre en plusieurs lieux, et y lysit, car moult bien parloit et lysoit Françoys, et puis le fist prendre par ung sien Chevalier, qui se nomme Messire Richard Credon, et porter en sa chambre de retrait dont il me fist bonne chere.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="172"/>
After passing three months in this court, Froissart took his leave of the munificent but ill∣fated Richard. In the last chapter of his His∣tory, where he mentions the unfortunate end of this Monarch, he speaks with an honest and af∣fecting gratitude of the liberal present he received from him on his departure from England.—It was a goblet of silver gilt, weighing two marks, and filled with a hundred nobles.</P>
<P>On leaving England, he retired to his own country, and is supposed to have ended his days at his benefice of Chimay; but the year of his death is uncertain.—There is an ancient tradi∣tion in the country, says Mr. de Saint Palaye, that he was buried in the chapel of St. Anne, be∣longing to his own church.—That ingenious antiquarian produces an extract from its archives, in which the death of Froissart is recorded, but without naming the year, in the most honour∣able terms.—His obit bears the date of Oc∣tober, and is followed by 20 Latin verses,
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>

has been tempted to give credit, have severely censured Froissart, as the venal partizan of the English; and they have accused his last Editor, Sauvage, of mutilating his author, because they could find in his edition no proofs of their charge.—The amiable St. Palaye has defended le bon Froissart, as he is called by honest Montaigne, from this unjust accusation; and done full justice, at the same time, to the injured reputation of his exact and laborious editor.</P>
<P>It may serve as a kind of memento mori to poe∣tical vanity, to reflect that Froissart is hardly known as a Poet, though his fertile pen produced 30,000 verses, which were once the delight of Princes, and the favourite study of the gallant and the fair.—How far he deserved the oblivion into which his poetical compositions have fallen, the reader may conceive from the following judgment of his French Critic; with whose ingenious re∣flection on the imperfections attending the early state both of Poetry and Painting, I shall termi∣nate this Note.</P>

<P>Nicholas Machiavel, the celebrated Florentine, was first patronized by Leo, who caused one of his comedies to be acted with great magnificence at Rome, and engaged him to write a private Treatise de Reformatione Reipublicae Floren∣tinae. His famous political Essay, intitled, "The Prince," was published in 1515, and dedicated to the Nephew of that Pontiff. The various judg∣ments that have been passed on this singular per∣formance, are a striking proof of the incertitude of human opinion.—In England it has received applause from the great names of Bacon and Clarendon, who suppose it intended to promote
<PB N="178" REF="178"/>
the interest of liberty and virtue. In Italy, after many years of approbation, it was publicly con∣demned by Clement the VIIIth, at the instiga∣tion of a Jesuit, who had not read the book. In France it has even been supposed instrumental to the horrid massacre of St. Bartholomew, as the favourite study of Catherine of Medicis and her Sons, and as teaching the bloody lessons of ex∣tirpation which they so fatally put in practice. Yet one of his French Translators has gone so far as to say, that <Q REND="inline">"Machiavel, who passes among all the world for a teacher of Tyranny, detested it more than any man of the age in which he lived."</Q> It must however be owned, that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his poli∣tical precepts. For the latter many plausible apologies have been made: and it should be re∣membered to his honour, that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country, in ex∣citing the House of Medicis to deliver Italy from the invasion of foreigners.</P>

His History of that republic he wrote at the request of Clement the VIIth, as we are informed in his Dedication of it to that Pontiff. The style of this work is much celebrated, and the first Book may be re∣garded as a model of Historical abridgment.—He died, according to Paul Jovius, in 1530.</P>

He succeeded to that of Parma, which he defended with great spirit against the French, on the death of Leo.—He rose to the highest honours under Clement the VIIth, having the command of all the ecclesiastical forces, and being Go∣vernor of Romagna, and lastly of Bologna, in which city he is said to have received the most flattering compliments from the Emperor Charles V.—Having gained much reputation, both civil and military, in various scenes of ac∣tive life, he passed his latter days in retirement, at his villa near Florence; where he died soon after completing his History, in the 59th year of his age, 1540. Notwithstanding the high re∣putation of Guicciardin, his History has been violently attacked, both as to matter and style.—The honest Montaigne inveighs with great warmth against the malignant turn of its author; and his own countryman Boccalini, in whose

<P>Henry Catherine Davila was the youngest son of Antonio Davila, Grand Constable of Cyprus, who had been obliged to retire into Spain on the tak∣ing of that island by the Turks, in 1570. From Spain Antonio repaired to the court of France, and settled his son Lewis and two daughters un∣der the patronage of Catherine of Medicis, whose name he afterwards gave to the young Historian, born 1576, at an antient castle in the territories of Padua, though generally called a native of Cyprus. The little Davila was brought early into France:—at the age of 18 he signalized himself in the military scenes of that country His last exploit there was at the siege of Amiens, where he fought under Henry IV. and received a wound in the knee, as he relates himself in his History.—After peace was established in France, he withdrew into Italy, and served the Republic

of Venice with great reputation, till a most unfor∣tunate adventure put an end to his life in 1631.—Passing through Verona with his wife and family, on his way to Crema, which he was appointed to defend, and demanding, according to the usual custom of persons in his station, a supply of horses and carriages for his retinue, a brutal Veronese, called Il Turco, entered the room where he and his family were at supper; and being mildly reprimanded for his intrusion by Davila, discharged a pistol at the Historian, and shot him dead on the instant. His accom∣plices also killed the Chaplain of Davila, and wounded many of his attendants.—But his eldest son Antonio, a noble youth of eighteen, revenged the death of his father by killing his murderer on the spot. All the confederates were secured the next morning, and publicly executed at Verona.—Memoire Istoriche, prefixed to the London edition of Davila, 4to. 1755.—It is very remarkable, that Davila passes no censure on the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.—His cha∣racter

of Venice, and born in that city, 1552. He took the religious habit, in the monastery of the Servites, 1565. After receiving priest's orders in 1574, he passed four years in Man∣tua, being appointed to read Lectures on Di∣vinity and Canon Law, by the Bishop of that diocese: and in this early part of his life, he is conjectured to have conceived the first idea of writing his celebrated History; as he formed an intimate friendship, during his residence in Man∣tua, with Camillo d'Oliva, who had been Secre∣tary to Cardinal Gonzaga at the Council of Trent; and excited the learned Venetian to the arduous task, which he so happily accomplished in a future period. He was recalled from Man∣tua, to read Lectures on Philosophy in his own convent at Venice; which he did with great repu∣tation, during the years 1575, 1576, and 1577.—He went to Rome, as Procurator General, in 1585.—Passing from thence to Naples, he there formed an acquaintance with the famous Baptista Porta, who has left this honourable testimony of his universal knowledge:—<Q REND="inline">Eo doctiorem, sub∣tiliorem,

His discoveries in Optics and Ana∣tomy would be alone sufficient to immortalize his name, had he not gained immortality by a still nobler exertion of his mental powers, in de∣fending the liberties of his country against the tyranny of Rome. On the first attack of Pope Paul V. on two laws of Venice, very wisely framed to correct the abuses of the clergy, Fa∣ther Paul arose as the literary champion of the Republic, and defended its cause with great spirit and temper, in various compositions; though he is said not to be Author of the Treatise generally ascribed to him on the occasion, and intitled, <HI>The Rights of Sovereigns,</HI> &amp;c.—His chief per∣formance on the subject was, <HI>Considerazioni sopra le Censure di Paolo V.</HI>—The Venetians shewed a just admiration of the sublime virtue of a Monk, who defended so nobly the civil rights of his

country against the separate interest of the church. In 1606 the Council passed a decree in his fa∣vour; which I shall transcribe in this note, be∣cause it is not found in the common Lives of Father Paul, and because there is hardly any ob∣ject more pleasing to the mind, than the con∣templation of a free state rewarding one of its most virtuous servants with liberality and esteem.—<Q REND="inline">Continuando il R.

from the base attempts of that enemy, whom his virtue had provoked. In 1607, after Venice had adjusted her disputes with Rome, by the me∣diation of France, the first attack was made on the life of Father Paul. He was beset near his convent, in the evening, by five assassins, who stabbed him in many places, and left him for dead. He recovered, under the care of the cele∣brated Acquapendente, appointed to attend him at the public charge; to whom, as he was speaking on the depth of the principal wound, his patient said pleasantly, that the world im∣puted it stylo Romanae Curiae.—The crime is generally supposed to have proceeded from the Jesuits; but the secret authors of it were never clearly discovered, though the five ruffians were traced by the Venetian Ambassador in Rome; where they are said to have been well received at first, but failing afterwards in their expected re∣ward, to have perished in misery and want. The Senate of Venice paid such attention to Father Paul, as expressed the highest sense of his merit,
<PB N="191" REF="191"/>
and the most affectionate solicitude for his safety. They not only doubled his stipend a second time, but entreated him to chuse a public residence, for the greater security of his person. The munifi∣cence and care of the Republic was equalled by the modesty and fortitude of their servant. He chose not to relinquish his cell: and, though warned of various machinations against his life, he continued to serve his country with unabating zeal; discovering, in his private letters to his friends, the most heroic calmness of mind; and saying, in answer to their admonitions, that <Q REND="inline">"no man lives well, who is too anxious for the pre∣servation of life."</Q>—Yet the apprehensions of his friends had too just a foundation. In 1609 another conspiracy was formed, to murder him in his sleep, by some persons of his own convent; but their treachery was happily discovered.—From this time he lived in more cautious retire∣ment, still devoting himself to the service of the Republic on various occasions, and acquiring
<PB N="192" REF="192"/>
new reputation by many compositions. At length the world was surprised by his History of the Council of Trent, first published at London, 1619, with the fictitious name of Pietro Soave Polano; and dedicated to James the Ist by Antonio de Dominis, the celebrated Archbishop of Spalatro, who speaks of the concealed Author as his intimate friend, who had entrusted him with a manuscript, on which his modesty set a trifling value, but which it seemed proper to bestow upon the world even without his consent.—The mystery concerning the publication of this noble work, has never been thoroughly cleared up; and various falsities concerning it have been reported by authors of considerable reputation.—It has even been said that James the Ist had some share in the composition of the book: if he had, it was probably in forming the name Pietro Soave Polano, which is an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneziano, and the only part of the book which bears any relation to the style or
<PB N="193" REF="193"/>
taste of that Monarch.—Father Paul was soon supposed to be the real Author of the work in question. The Prince of Condé, on a visit to his cloyster, expressly asked him, if he was so—to which he modestly replied, that at Rome it was well known who had written it.—He enjoyed not many years the reputation arising from this masterly production—in 1623 a fever occasioned his death, which was even more exemplary and sublime than his life itself.—He prepared himself for approaching dissolu∣tion with the most devout composure; and, as the liberty of his country was the darling object of his exalted mind, he prayed for its pre∣servation with his last breath, in the two cele∣brated words Esto Perpetua.</P>
<P>There is a singular beauty in the character of Father Paul, which is not only uncommon in his profession, but is rarely found in human nature.—Though he passed a long life in con∣troversy of the most exasperating kind, and was continually attacked in every manner that
<PB N="194" REF="194"/>
malignity could suggest, both his writings and his heart appeared perfectly free from a vindic∣tive spirit. Devoting all the powers of his mind to the defence of the public cause, he seemed entirely to forget the injuries that were per∣petually offered to his own person and re∣putation.</P>
<P>His constitution was extremely delicate, and his intense application exposed him to very frequent and violent disorders: these he greatly remedied by his singular temperance, living chiefly on bread, fruits, and water.—This imperfect account of a character deserving the noblest elogium, is princi∣pally extracted from an octavo volume, intitled, Memoire Anedote spettanti a F. Paolo da Fran∣cesco Griselini Veneziano, &amp;c. edit. 2d, 1760. The author of this elaborate work has pointed out several mistakes in the French and English accounts of Father Paul; particularly in the anecdotes related of him by Burnet, in his Life of Bishop Bedell; and by Mr. Brent, the son of his English Translator.—Some of these had in∣deed
<PB N="195" REF="195"/>
been observed before by writers of our own.—See the General Dictionary, under the article Father Paul.—For the length and for the defi∣ciencies of this Note, I am tempted to apologize with a sentence borrowed from the great Historian who is the subject of it:—<Q REND="inline">Chi mi osserverà in al∣cuni tempi abondare, in altri andar ristretto, si ri∣cordi che non tutti i campi sono di ugnal fertilità, ne tutti li grani merltano d'esser conservati, e di quel∣li che il mietitore vorrebbe tenerne conto, qual∣che spica anco sfugge la presa della mano, o il filo della falce, cosi comportando la conditione d'ogni mietitura che resti anco parte per rispigolare.</Q></P>

<L><HI>The clear Osorius, in his classic phrase.</HI>]</L>
<P>Jerom Osorius was born of a noble family at Lisbon, 1506. He was educated at the university of Sala∣manca, and afterwards studied at Paris and Bo∣logna. On his return to Portugal, he gradually rose to the Bishopric of Sylves, to which he was
<PB N="196" REF="196"/>
appointed by Catherine of Austria, Regent of the kingdom in the minority of Sebastian. At the request of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his History of King Emanuel, and the expedition of Gama—which his great contemporary Ca∣moens made at the same time the subject of his immortal Lusiad; a poem which has at length appeared with due lustre in our language, being translated with great spirit and elegance by Mr. Mickle. It is remarkable, that the History of Osorius, and the Epic Poem of Camoens, were published in the same year, 1572: but the fate of these two great Authors was very different; the Poet was suffered to perish in poverty, under the reign of that Henry who patronized the Histori∣an: yet, allowing for the difference of their pro∣fessions, I am inclined to think they possessed a simi∣larity of mind. There appear many traces of that high heroic spirit, even in the Priest Osorius, which animated the Soldier Camoens; particularly in the pleasure with which he seems to describe the martial manners of his countrymen, under the
<PB N="197" REF="197"/>
of Emanuel.—<Q REND="inline">Illius aetate (says the Histo∣rian, in the close of his manly work) inopia in ex∣ilium pulsa videbatur: moestitiae locus non erat: querimoniae silebant: omnia choreis &amp; cantibus per∣sonabant: ejusmodi ludis aula regia frequenter ob∣lectabatur.

There is one particular in the character of Osorius, which, considering his age and country, deserves the highest encomium: I

mean his tolerating spirit. In the first book of his History, he speaks of Emanuel's cruel perse∣cution of the Jews in the following generous and exalted language:—<Q REND="inline">Fuit quidem hoc nec ex lege nec ex religione factum. Quid enim? Tu re∣belles animos, nullaque ad id suscepta religione constrictos, adigas ad credendum ea, quae summa contentione aspernantur &amp; respuunt?

Postremò quis non videt . . . . . et ita religionem per re∣ligionis simulationem indignissimè violari?</Q>—Oso∣rius is said to have used many arguments to dis∣suade Sebastian from his unfortunate expedition into Africa; and to have felt so deeply the mise∣ries which befel the Portuguese after that fatal event, that his grief was supposed to accelerate his

death.—He expired in 1580, happy, says De Thou (who celebrates him as a model of Chris∣tian virtue), that he died just before the Spanish army entered Portugal, and thus escaped being a witness to the desolation of his country.—His va∣rious works were published at Rome in 1592, by his nephew Osorius, in four volumes folio, with a Life of their Author. Among these are two re∣markable productions: the first, an admonition to our Queen Elizabeth, exhorting her to return in∣to the church of Rome; the second, an Essay on Glory, written with such classical purity, as to give birth to a report, that it was not the composi∣tion of Osorius, but the lost work of Cicero on that subject.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Lucubrationes</HI> of Walter Haddon, the curious reader may find a very spirited answer to the invective against the Reformation, which the zeal of the Portuguese Bishop led him to address to Elizabeth.—The English Civilian defends the cause of his nation and his Queen with great ener∣gy.—He justifies the dissolution of the monasteries,

by representing their abuses in the most glowing colours; and he ventures to affirm, in vindicating the character of his royal Mistress, that her Ma∣jesty of England was as great a Theologian as the Bishop of Sylves himself:—<Q REND="inline">Sacras Scripturas mul∣tùm lectitat, interpretes optimos inter se comparat, doctissimorum theologorum undique sententias colligit, scientia linguarum per se ipsa excellit, in∣genio est prompto et acri; sapientiae tantum ad haec adhibet, quantum vix est in illo sexu credi∣bile: denique nostrorum ad consciones ventitat, et sensus in his rebus habet partim legendo, par∣tim audiendo, tam exercitatos, ut non minus <HI>te docere</HI> possit, quam <HI>ex te discere.</HI></Q> <BIBL>HADDON, Lucubrat.

<L><HI>As bright a wreath to Mariana's brow.</HI>]</L>
<P>John Mariana was born 1537, at Talavera (a town in the diocese of Toledo), as he himself informs us
<PB N="201" REF="201"/>
in his famous Essay <HI>de Rege,</HI> which opens with a beautiful romantic description of a sequestered spot in that neighbourhood, where he enjoyed the pleasures of literary retirement with his friend Cal∣deron, a Minister of Toledo; whose death he mentions in the same Essay, commemorating his learning and his virtues in the most pleasing terms of affectionate admiration.—Mariana was admit∣ted into the order of Jesuits at the age of 17. He travelled afterwards into Italy and France; and returning into Spain in 1574, settled at Toledo, and died there in the 87th year of his age, 1624.—Hearing it frequently regretted, in the course of his travels, that there was no General History of his country, he engaged in that great work on his return; and published it in Latin at Toledo, 1592, with a dedication to Philip the IId: where he speaks of his own performance with modesty and manly freedom, and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any address of that nature, to a Monarch continually fed with the grossest adulation.—This elaborate work he
<PB N="202" REF="202"/>
translated into Spanish, but, as he himself declares, with all the freedom of an original author. He published his Version in 1601, with an address to Philip the IIId, in which he laments the decline of Learning in his country; and declares he had himself executed that work, from his apprehension of its being mangled by an ignorant Translator. He had closed his History (which begins with the first peopling of Spain) with the death of Ferdi∣nand, in 1516; but in a subsequent edition, in 1617, he added to it a short summary of events to the year 1612. But in the year before he first published the Spanish Version of his History, he addressed also to the young Monarch Philip the IIId, his famous Essay which I have mentioned, and which was publicly burnt at Paris, about 20 years after its publication, on the supposition that it had excited Ravaillac to the murder of Henry the IVth: though it was asserted, with great proba∣bility, by the Jesuits, that the Assassin had never seen the book. It is true, indeed, that Mariana in this Essay occasionally defends Clement the
<PB N="203" REF="203"/>
Monk, who stabbed Henry the IIId; and it is very remarkable, that he grounds this defence, not on the bigotted tenets of a Priest, who thinks every thing lawful for the interest of his church, but on those sublime principles of civil liberty, with which an antient Roman would have vindi∣cated the dagger of Brutus. Indeed this Essay contains some passages on Government, which would not have dishonoured even Cicero himself; but, it must be owned, they are grievously dis∣graced by the last chapter of the Work, which breathes a furious spirit of ecclesiastical intole∣rance, and yet closes with these mild and modest expressions:—<Q REND="inline">Nostrum de regno et Regis institu∣tione judicium fortassè non omnibus placeat: qui volet sequatur; aut suo potiùs stet, si potioribus argumentis nitatur: de quibus rebus tantoperè as∣severavi in his libris, eas nunquam veriores quam alienam sententiam affirmabo. Potest enim non solum mihi aliud, aliud aliis videri, sed et mihi ipsi alio tempore. Suam quisque sententiam per me sequatur . . . et . . qui nostra leget . . .
<PB N="204" REF="204"/>
memor conditionis humanae, si quid erratum est, pio studio rempublicam juvandi veniam benignus concedat et facilis.</Q>—This is not the only work of Mariana which fell under a public proscription; he was himself persecuted, and suffered a year's imprisonment, for a treatise which seems to have been dictated by the purest love to his country. It was against the pernicious practice of debasing the public coin; and as it was supposed to reflect on the Duke of Lerma, called the Sejanus of Spain, it exposed the Author, about the year 1609, to the persecution of that vindictive Minister, from which it does not appear how he escaped.—In∣deed the accounts of Mariana's life are very im∣perfect. Bayle, whom I have chiefly followed, mentions a life of him by De Vargas, which he could not procure. I have sought after this Bio∣grapher with the same ill success; as I wished to give a more perfect account of this great Author, whose personal History is little known among us, though it is far from being unworthy of atten∣tion.</P>

<L><HI>The fervid Grotius to her glory rais'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>A column, splendid as the feats he prais'd.</HI>]</L>
<P>Hugo Grotius was the eldest child of John de Groot, curator in the university of Leyden, and born at Delft on the 10th of April 1583.—His infancy gave the fairest promise of those great and universal talents, which were so amply un∣folded in his subsequent life. At the age of eleven he was celebrated as a prodigy of learning.—When Barnevelt was sent Ambassador to Henry the IVth of France, in 1598, he took the young Grotius in his train, and presented him to that Monarch; who honoured the little scholar by graciously giving him his picture and a chain of gold. One circumstance was yet wanting to complete the joy of Grotius in this expedition; and he was obliged to quit France without obtaining the great object of his wishes, a per∣sonal acquaintance with the President de Thou.—
<PB N="206" REF="206"/>
He afterwards expressed his mortification on this subject in a letter to that great man, which gave rise to a friendly correspondence between these congenial characters, highly honourable to both.—On his return to Holland, Grotius devoted himself to the practice of the law, and in 1599 pleaded his first cause at Delft. In the exercise of this laborious profession, he found sufficient time to cultivate polite literature. In 1599 he published his edition of Martianus Capella, at the request of Scaliger: it was followed, in the succeeding year, by the Phaenomena of Ara∣tus: and in 1601 he printed his first tragedy of Adamus Exful, a composition which might pos∣sibly give birth to the divine performance of Mil∣ton; though its author esteemed it so little, as to exclude it from a collection of his poems. Gro∣tius, indeed, was remarkably modest in estima∣ting his own poetical talents:—few persons have written so many verses, and thought so humbly of their merit.—The public proofs which he had now given of his various erudition, procured
<PB N="207" REF="207"/>
him an honour from his country, the more flat∣tering as it was unsolicited. The United Pro∣vinces, justly proud of having vindicated their liberty against the tyranny of Spain, and desirous of commemorating so noble an event, appointed Grotius their Historiographer. A nomination so honourable to a youth, for such he was, led him to collect materials for that History; which many accidents conspired to prevent his publishing, during the whole course of his busy and vexa∣tious life.—From his success at the bar, he was promoted to the post of Advocate General; and in 1608 he married Maria Reigesberg, a lady of a respectable family in Zealand, and a wife, as his Biographer observes, truly worthy of such a husband. In 1613 he became Pensionary of Rotterdam, an office which gave him a seat in the Assembly of the States. He was soon after∣wards employed in a commission to England, to settle some national disputes concerning the Greenland Fishery.—The greatest pleasure and advantage which he derived from this expedition,
<PB N="208" REF="208"/>
was the intimacy which he contracted in Eng∣land with the celebrated Casaubon. Soon after his return to Holland, the fatal spirit of religious controversy produced those unfortunate and well∣known distractions in his country, which led to the infamous execution of the great and virtuous Barnevelt. Grotius, who was affectionately at∣tached to that upright Minister, and joined with him in every measure to counteract the usurping ambition of Prince Maurice, was thus exposed to the oppression of that vindictive hero.—After the vain ceremony of an iniquitous trial, he was con∣demned to perpetual imprisonment; and con∣ducted, on the 6th of June 1619, to the fortress of Louvestein, in South Holland, at the point of the island formed by the Vahal and the Meuse.—His tender and faithful wife, who had been cruelly debarred from attending him, even in sickness, during his confinement at the Hague, was now admitted to share his prison; on the hard condition of forfeiting that privilege, if she ever ventured from Louvestein: she afterwards ob∣tained
<PB N="209" REF="209"/>
leave to come abroad twice a week.—With the spirit of a Roman Matron she refused the al∣lowance which the government had assigned for the maintenance of her husband—continued for almost two years the constant attendant on his captivity—and at length became the glorious in∣strument of his deliverance. Grotius, who hap∣pily experienced that love and literature are un∣failing resources under the most galling calamity of human life, had pursued his studies in prison with his usual ardour. He composed there, among other works, the first sketch of his Essay on the Truth of Christianity, in a poetical form, and in his native language.—Reports were spread by his enemies that he had formed a plan for his escape, and his prison was rigorously examined. But notwithstanding the vigilance of his oppres∣sors, the affectionate ingenuity of his wife resto∣red him to freedom by the following expedient:—He had been allowed to borrow books from his friends; and it was usual with him to send such as he had read in a chest, that went regu∣larly

with his linen to the neighbouring town of Gorcum. The guards were at first very scrupu∣lous in their examination of this chest; but hav∣ing long found in it only books and linen, they were now accustomed to let it pass unopened.—The circumstance suggested to the attentive wife of Grotius the possibility of her husband's escape, and she persuaded him to attempt it by this sin∣gular conveyance. The incidents attending the adventure were highly calculated to increase the agitation of her heart; and must indeed have oc∣casioned the failure of her design, had she not taken the most ingenious precautions to en∣sure its success:—The soldiers, who carried the chest in which Grotius was inclosed, were alarmed by its weight; and cried out, in the pro∣verbial language of their country, that it must contain an Arminian;—she replied with great presence of mind, that it was indeed loaded with Arminian books. The soldiers were still un∣satisfied, and went to the wife of their command∣ing officer, who was absent, to express their sus∣picion;
<PB N="211" REF="211"/>
—she replied, that she had been assured it contained only books, and bade them carry it to the boat: a female servant in the secret attended the chest, and saw it safely conveyed to the house of Dazelaer, a friend of Grotius, in Gorcum, from whence he passed in disguise into Brabant. The generous contriver of his escape now tri∣umphed in the success of her project. Being as∣sured that her husband was safe, by the return of her servant, she avowed what she had done, and was more closely confined by the offended com∣mandant of Louvestein. But she soon ob∣tained her liberty, on presenting a petition to the States-General; though some wretches were found in that assembly, brutal enough to express a desire of punishing a woman for an act of he∣roism, which, in Athens or in Rome, would have almost rendered her an object of idolatry.—Her merit, however, has been justly celebrated by the poets of her country; but the most pleasing me∣morial of it appears in a poem of Grotius, ad∣dressed to the unfortunate son of the President De

Thou. The passage does honour both to the gratitude and the genius of our Author; and I shall therefore insert it, as an advantageous spe∣cimen of his Latin poetry.—In addressing his young friend on the virtues of his venerable fa∣ther, he breaks out into the following encomium on connubial affection:<Q><L>Ah quantum placido mitique in pectore regnat</L>
<L>Illa Venus, quam junxit Hymen; seu conditor orbis,</L>

<L>Pectora Phoebus amat.—</L></Q> It was not without reason that Grotius la∣mented, in the close of this passage, his continued adversity. Few literary characters have been so repeatedly exposed to all the various and mortify∣ing anxieties of public life.—After his escape from prison in 1621, he took refuge in France. He received, indeed, the most flattering marks of regard from many eminent characters of that kingdom, and a pension of three thousand livres from Lewis the XIIIth; but the payment of this gratuity, so honourable to the Monarch who bestowed it, was soon rendered irregular and pre∣carious by the artifices of Richelieu; and Gro∣tius
<PB N="216" REF="216"/>
was at length obliged to seek a more inde∣pendent asylum, merely because he was of too firm and noble a character to become the servile instrument of that imperious minister.—He had passed however ten years, and composed one of his most celebrated works in that country—his Treatise de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis was begun in 1623 at Balagui, a seat of the President De Meme, in the neighbourhood of Senlis, and he published it at Paris in 1625. The great and ex∣tensive reputation which his writings had ob∣tained, did not induce Holland to atone for the injustice which she had exercised against one of the most eminent and virtuous of her citizens. The death of his enemy Prince Maurice had tempted Grotius to hope, that he might return with safety and honour to his native country; but on making the experiment in 1631, he met with much more ingratitude than he expected, and retired in the next year to Hamburgh—he there contracted an intimacy with Salvius, the Vice-Chancellor of Sweden, who sent a favour∣able
<PB N="217" REF="217"/>
account of his new friend to Oxenstiern, the great minister, who so well supplied the loss of his heroic master Gustavus. Grotius was soon invited to Franckfort by that penetrating genius, who introduced him into the council of the young Christina, and appointed him her Am∣bassador to the court of France:—it is said, how∣ever, that Grotius owed his connection with Sweden to the high sentiments which Gustavus himself had entertained of his merit, and to or∣ders given by that Monarch for the employment of the celebrated exile, whose Treatise de Jure Belli was found in his tent after the fatal victory of Lutzen, which he purchased with his life. However this may be, Grotius appeared at Paris in the character of Ambassador from Sweden 1635, and continued no less than ten years in a situation equally splendid and vexatious—en∣gaged in the delicate business of negotiating sub∣sidies, which were paid with reluctance; har∣rassed by the hostile intrigues of his ungrateful
<PB N="218" REF="218"/>
country, and alternately insulted and flattered by the ministers of France, he maintained himself with integrity and honour in a difficult and im∣portant station, from which his various and pow∣erful enemies were perpetually endeavouring to effect his removal.—After a series of public mor∣tifications, he at length solicited his own recall. He obtained a passport through Holland, was treated with great honour at Amsterdam, and ar∣riving at Stockholm was flattered with great pro∣mises by the Queen Christina, who pressed him to settle with his family in Sweden. From this however he excused himself, and pleaded the ten∣der health of his wife as unequal to so cold a climate. Having obtained, after some delays, the Queen's permission to retire, and a vessel to carry him to Lubeck, he was unfortunately ship∣wrecked on the coast of Pomerania, from whence he travelled sixty miles in an open waggon, to the town of Rostock, where, after languishing a few days, he expired on the 19th of August 1645.—
<PB N="219" REF="219"/>
For my very imperfect account of this great and amiable man, I am chiefly indebted to Mr. Bu∣rigny, whose life of Grotius deserves a distin∣guished rank among biographical writings, as it contains a very luminous display of much intri∣cate matter, and a just delineation of a character which deserves to be minutely studied: for what nation can produce a more singular and excelling compound of science and virtue, of genius and piety?—As an Historian, he shares with Thu∣cydides the uncommon merit of celebrating the splendid actions of his personal enemies, and of a country which treated him with the most unge∣nerous ingratitude. It appears from one of his letters to De Thou, that he had made some ad∣vances in the plan at least of his History, at so early a period as 1614; for, after complimenting the great Historian of France on his immortal work, he adds, <Q REND="inline">Ego quoque impar sanè oneri, sed magno patriae amore accensus, simile opus molior; tantò autem minus tuo, quantò minor est Batavia, non dicam Galliâ vestrâ, sed toto orbe.
<PB N="220" REF="220"/>
Sed nec adhuc Varo videor neque dicere Cinna digna: prematur itaque immaturus labor donec aetas cum judicio tempus quoque emendandi dederit; aut potiùs exurgat alius, qui res scitu per se non indignas dictione commendet, ut eo liben∣tiùs discant posteri quid Batavi fecerint.</Q>—We learn also from a letter to his brother, in 1637, that the work was then finished, and that he thought proper to delay its publication. Though it seems to have been his favourite performance, he had never the satisfaction of seeing it in print:—it did not appear till twelve years after his death, when his sons Cornelius and Peter ad∣dressed it to the States of Holland and West Friesland, in a Dedication that does honour both to their father and themselves.—The work it∣self, under the double name of Annals and His∣tory, gives a complete account of the most in∣teresting period, from the year 1566 to the truce with Spain in 1609.—The Letters of Grotius are not less valuable than his History, as they con∣tain much miscellaneous intelligence, and abound
<PB N="221" REF="221"/>
with literary anecdotes.—His amiable wife sur∣vived him, and died at the Hague.—Of their six children, Peter became the most eminent—he was sent by his country as her Ambassador to France; and seems to have inherited both the talents and the virtues of his father.—It may yet be proper to add to this long Note the noble en∣comium of Grotius on Scaliger, to which I have alluded, and which, as Dr. Johnson observes, seems to have been imitated by Cowley, in the close of his Elegy on Sir Henry Wooton.<Q><LG>

<P>James Au∣gustus De Thou was the youngest son of Christo∣pher De Thou, First President of the Parliament of Paris, and born in that city 1553. His own Memoirs give a pleasing account of the early activity of his mind.—As his health, dur∣ing his childhood, was so tender and infirm, that his parents rather restrained him from the usual studies of his age, he devoted much of his time to drawing, and copied with a pen the engrav∣ings
<PB N="223" REF="223"/>
of Albert Durer, before he was ten years old. At that age, he was settled in the college of Burgundy; but this plan of his education was soon interrupted by a fever, in which his life was despaired of, and in which the mother of his fu∣ture friend, the Duke of Montpensier, watched him with an attention singularly happy, after his physicians and his parents had considered him as dead. In a few years after his recovery, he re∣paired to Orleans to study the civil law; from thence he was drawn to Valence in Dauphiny, by the reputation of Cujacius, who was then reading lectures there: on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing Hotoman, the cele∣brated author of Franco-Gallia, who was read∣ing lectures also at Bourges.—During his residence at Valence, he contracted a friend∣ship with Joseph Scaliger, which he cultivated through life.—In 1572, his father recalled him to Paris, just before the massacre of St. Bar∣tholomew.—He mentions in his Memoirs the horrors which he felt in seeing a very small part
<PB N="224" REF="224"/>
of that bloody scene.—He resided in the house of his uncle Nicholas De Thou, promoted to the bishopric of Chartres: he was then designed himself for the church; and, beginning to collect his celebrated library, applied himself particu∣larly to the Civil Law, and to Grecian litera∣ture.</P>
<P>He travelled into Italy in 1573, with Paul De Foix, going on an embassy to the Pope and the Italian Princes. Of De Foix he gives the most engaging character, and speaks with great plea∣sure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expedition. He return∣ed to Paris, and devoted himself again to his stu∣dies, in the following year.—On the dissentions in the court of France, in 1576, he was employed to negociate with the Mareschal Montmorency, and engage him to interpose his good offices to prevent the civil war; which he for some time ef∣fected.—The same year he visited the Low Countries, and on his return was appointed to a public office; on which he entered with that ex∣treme
<PB N="225" REF="225"/>
diffidence which is so natural to a delicate mind.</P>
<P>In 1579 he travelled again with his elder bro∣ther, who was sent by his physicians to the baths of Plombieres in Lorrain: from hence he made a short excursion into Germany, and was received there with the jovial hospitality of that country, which he describes in a very lively manner.—But affection soon recalled him to Plombieres, to at∣tend his infirm brother to Paris, who died there in a few months after their return.</P>
<P>In 1580, on the plague's appearing in the ca∣pital, our Historian retired into Touraine; and after visiting the principal places in Nor∣mandy, returned to Paris in the winter. In the following year, he was of the number chosen from the Parliament of Paris to administer justice in Guienne, as two ecclesiastics were included in that commission.—In this expedition he embraced every opportunity of preparing the materials of his History; seeking, as he ever did, the society of all persons eminent for their talents, or capable of giv∣ing
<PB N="226" REF="226"/>
him any useful information. He speaks with great pleasure of a visit which he paid at this time to the celebrated Montaigne, whom he calls a man of a most liberal mind, and totally uninfected with the spirit of party.—After various excursions he was now returning to Paris, when he recei∣ved the unexpected news of his father's death; an event which affected him most deeply, as filial affection was one of the striking characteristics of his amiable mind. He consoled himself under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent, by erecting a magnificent mo∣nument to his memory, expressive of the high ve∣neration in which he ever held his virtues.—He engaged again in public business, devoting his in∣tervals of leisure to mathematical studies, and to the composition of Latin verse, which seems to have been his favourite amusement.—In 1584 he pub∣lished his Poem, De Re Accipitraria; which, tho' much celebrated by the critics of his age, has fallen, like the subject of which it treats, into universal neglect.—In 1585 he bid adieu to the
<PB N="227" REF="227"/>
Court, on finding himself treated with such a de∣gree of coldness, as his ingenuous nature could not submit to; and being eager to advance in his great work, which he had already brought down to the reign of Francis II.—In 1587, having been often pressed to marry by his family, and being absolved from his ecclesiastical engagements for that pur∣pose, he made choice of Marie Barbanson, of an antient and noble family; but as her parents were suspected of a secret inclination to the re∣formed religion, it was thought proper that the lady should undergo a kind of expiation, in a private conference with two Catholic Divines; a circumstance of which the great Historian speaks with an air of triumph in his Memoirs, as a proof of his own inviolable attachment to the faith of his fathers. In 1588 he lost his affectionate mother; who is described, by her son, as meeting death with the same gentleness and tranquillity of mind, by which her life was distinguished.—When the violence of the League had reduced Henry the IIId to abandon Paris, our Historian was sent into Nor∣mandy,
<PB N="228" REF="228"/>
to confirm the magistrates of that province in their adherence to the King. He afterwards met Henry at Blois; and while he was receiving from him in private some commissions to execute at Paris, the King pressed his hand, and seemed preparing to impart to him some important secret; but after a long pause dismissed him without re∣vealing it. This secret was afterwards supposed to have been the projected assassination of the Duke of Guise: the supposition is probable; and it is also probable that if Henry had then revealed his design, the manly virtue and eloquence of De Thou might have led him to relinquish that infa∣mous and fatal measure.—He was, however, so far from suspecting the intended crime of the King, that when he first heard at Paris that Guise was assassinated, he believed it a false rumour, only spread by that faction to introduce, what he sup∣posed had really happened, the murder of the King.—In the commotions which the death of Guise produced in Paris, many insults were offered to the family of De Thou: his wife was imprisoned
<PB N="229" REF="229"/>
for a day in the Bastile; but obtaining her liberty, she escaped from the city in a mean habit, atten∣ded by her husband, disguised also in the dress of a soldier.—Having sent his wife in safety into Pi∣cardy, he repaired to the King, who was almost deserted, at Blois; and was greatly instrumental in persuading his master to his coalition with Henry of Navarre.—The King determined to establish a Parliament at Tours, and De Thou was considered as the most proper person to be the President of this assembly; but with his usual modesty he declined this honour, and chose rather to engage with his friend Mr. de Schomberg, in an expedition to Germany for the service of the King.—He was at first designed for the embassy to Elizabeth; but at the request of Schomberg declined the appointment, and accompanied his friend.</P>
<P>He first received intelligence of the King's death at Venice, where he had formed an intima∣cy with the celebrated Arnauld d'Ossat, at that time Secretary to the Cardinal Joyeuse.—In con∣sequence
<PB N="230" REF="230"/>
of their conversation on this event, and the calamities of France, De Thou addressed a Latin Poem to his friend, which he afterwards printed at Tours.</P>
<P>In leaving Italy, he passed a few days at Padua with his friend Vicenzio Pinelli; from whom he collected many particulars concerning the most eminent Italian and Spanish Authors, whom he determined to celebrate in his History; in the hope, as he honestly confesses, that his liberal at∣tention to foreign merit might entitle his own Works to the favour both of Italy and Spain. But he was disappointed in this fair expectation, and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both.</P>
<P>On his return to France, he was graciously received by Henry the IVth; and in giving that Prince an account of Italy, suggested to him the idea of a connection with Mary of Medicis. After the battle of Ivry, he complimented the King in a short Poem, which closes with the following lines:<Q><PB N="231" REF="231"/>
<L>Auspiciis vulgò peraguntur praelia regum,</L>
<L>Perque duces illis gloria multa venit:</L>
<L>Tu vincis virtute tua, nec militis haec est;</L>
<L>Ista tibi propriâ laurea parta manu.</L></Q> As he was travelling, soon afterwards, with his wife and family, which he designed to settle at Tours, his party was intercepted by the enemy, and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her attendants; being prevailed on by their entrea∣ties to secure his own escape by the swiftness of his horse.—He repaired to the King at Gisors, and soon obtained the restitution of his family.—On the death of Amyot, Bishop of Auxerre, well known by his various Translations from the Greek language, the King appointed De Thou his Principal Librarian. In 1592, our Historian was very near falling a victim to the plague; but happily struggled through that dangerous distem∣per, by the assistance of two skilful physicians, who attended him at Tours.—In 1593, he began the most important part of his History; and under this year he introduces in his Memoirs a long and spi∣rited
<PB N="232" REF="232"/>
Poem, addressed to Posterity; in which he enters into a justification of himself against the malignant attacks which the manly and vir∣tuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him. It concludes with the following animated appeal to the spirit of his father:<Q><L>Vos, O majorum Cineres, teque optime longis</L>
<L>Soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi,</L>
<L>Testor, pro patria nullas regnique salute</L>
<L>Vitavisse vices; vestra virtute meaque</L>
<L>Indignum nil fecisse; et si fata tulissent,</L>
<L>Prodessem ut patriae, patriae succurrere, livor</L>
<L>Absistat, pietate mea meruisse petenti.</L>
<L>Pura ad vos anima atque hodiernae nescia culpae</L>
<L>Descendam; quandòque novissima venerit hora,</L>
<L>Nostraque sub tacitos ibit fama integra manes.</L></Q></P>
<P>In 1594 he succeeded his uncle Augustin, as President a Mortier.—In 1596 he lost his valu∣able and learned friend Pithou, who first solicited him to undertake his History, and had greatly
<PB N="233" REF="233"/>
assisted him in the prosecution of that laborious work. How deeply the affectionate mind of De Thou was wounded by this event, appears from his long letter to Casaubon on the occasion.—In 1597 he began to be engaged in those negotia∣tions, which happily terminated in the famous edict of Nantes.—It may be proper to observe here, that De Thou was accused of being a Cal∣vinist, in consequence of the part he acted in this business, as well as from the moderate tenor of his History; and it is remarkable, that Sully seems in his Memoirs to countenance the accusation.</P>
<P>In 1601 our Historian suffered a severe do∣mestic affliction in the loss of his wife. He cele∣brated her virtues, and his own connubial affec∣tion, in a Latin Poem: with this, and a Greek epitaph on the same lady, written by Casaubon, he terminates the Commentary of his own Life, of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgment.—His first wife leaving him no children, he married, in 1603, Gasparde de la Chastre, an accomplished lady of a noble family;
<PB N="234" REF="234"/>
who having brought him three sons and three daughters, died at the age of 39, 1616.—There is a fine letter of Daniel Heinsius addressed to our author on this occasion, exhorting him to fortitude: but this unexpected domestic calamity, and the miseries which befel his country on the murder of Henry the Great, are said to have wounded his feeling mind so deeply, as to occa∣sion his death, which happened in May 1617.—Under the regency of Mary of Medicis, he had been one of the Directors General of the finances; maintaining the same reputation for integrity in that department, which he had ever preserved in his judicial capacity.</P>
<P>The first part of his History appeared in 1604, with a Preface addressed to Henry IV. justly ce∣lebrated for its liberal and manly spirit. But I must observe, that the following compliment to the King—<Q REND="inline">Quicquid de ea statueris jusserisve, pro divinae vocis oraeulo mihi erit</Q>—was more than even that most amiable of Monarchs deserved; as he ungratefully deserted the cause of our Histo∣rian,
<PB N="235" REF="235"/>
in suffering his Work to be proscribed by the public censure of Rome, in 1609; as De Thou plainly intimates in the following passage from one of his letters, written in 1611:—<Q REND="inline">Pub∣licata prima parte [Historiae meae], immanè quam commoti sunt plerique, sive invidi, sive factiosi, qui mox proceres quosdam, qui per se in talibus rebus nihil vident, per calumnias artificiosè con∣fictas, ut scis, in me concitaverunt, remque e vestigio Roman detulerunt; et auctore malignè exagitato, facilè pervicerunt, ut morosi illi cen∣sores omnia mea sinistrè interpretarentur; et, praejudicio personae, opus integrum, cujus ne tertiam quidem partem legerant, praecipitato ordine damnarent. Rex causam meam initio quidem tuebatur, quamdiu proceres in aula in∣festos habui. Sed paulatim ipse eorundem astu infractus est; cognitoque Romae per emissarios labare regem, post Ossati et Serafini, Cardina∣lium mihi amicissimorum, obitum, et illustrissimi Perronii ex urbe discessum, ictus postremò in me directus est; qui facilè vitari potuit, si qui circa
<PB N="236" REF="236"/>
regem erant, tantae injuriae sensum ad se ac regni dignitatem pertinere vel minima significatione prae se tulissent. Ita in aula omni ope destitutus, facilè Romae oppressus sum.</Q>—De Thou was preparing a new edition of his History at the time of his death.—His passion for Latin verse appears never to have forsaken him; as the latest effusion of his pen was a little poem descriptive of his last illness, and an epitaph, in which he draws the following just character of himself:<Q><L>Mihi veritatis cura vitae commodis</L>
<L>Antiquiorque charitatibus fuit;</L>
<L>Nullique facto, voce nulli injurius,</L>
<L>Injurias patienter aliorum tuli.</L>
<L>Tu quisquis es, qualisque, quantusque, O bone,</L>
<L>Si cura veri est ulla, si pietas movet,</L>
<L>A me meisque injuriam, quaeso, abstine.</L></Q></P>
<P>The pious paternal prayer in the last line was very far from being crowned with success. Francis, the eldest son of De Thou, fell a victim
<PB N="237" REF="237"/>
to the resentment which Cardinal Richelieu is said to have conceived against him, from a passage in the great Historian reflecting on the Richelieu family.

<P>To avoid every appearance of national prejudice, I shall quote on this occasion some passages from a very liberal French Critic, who has passed the same judgment on the Historians of his country.

the compositions of this dogmatical Writer, a strange mixture of judicious criticism and enter∣taining absurdity, in a style so extraordinary, that I think the following specimens of it may amuse a reader, who has not happened to meet with this singular book.—Having celebrated Rawleigh and Hyde, as writers of true historic genius, he adds: <Q REND="inline">"Almost all the rest of our Histories want Life, Soul, Shape, and Body: a mere hodgepodge of abortive embryos and rotten carcases, kept in an unnatural ferment (which the vulgar mistake for real life) by the rank leven of prodigies and portents: which can't but afford good diversion to the Critic, while he observes how naturally one of their own fables is here mythologiz'd and explain'd, <HI>of a church∣yard carcase, raised and set a strutting by the in∣flation of some hellish succubus within.</HI>"</Q> He then passes a heavy censure on the antiquarian publi∣cations of Thomas Hearne; in the close of which he exclaims—<Q REND="inline">"Wonder not, Reader, at the view of these extravagancies.

In describing Sallust, at one time the loud advocate of public spirit, and afterwards sharing in the robberies of Caesar, he expresses this variation of character by the following ima∣gery:—<Q REND="inline">"No sooner did the warm aspect of good fortune shine out again, but all those ex∣alted ideas of virtue and honour, raised like a beautiful kind of frost-work in the cold season of adversity, dissolved and disappeared."</Q> <BIBL>Enquiry, &amp;c.

<P>The origin of the French nation was ascribed by one of the Monkish Historians to Francio, a son of Priam: Mr. Warton, who mentions this circum∣stance in his Dissertation on the origin of roman∣tic fiction in Europe, supposes that the revival of Virgil's Aeneid, about the sixth or seventh cen∣tury, inspired many nations with this chimerical idea of tracing their descent from the family of Priam. There is a very remarkable proof in the Historian Matthew of Westminster, how fond the English were of considering themselves as the descendants of the Trojan Brutus. In a let∣ter from Edward the First to Pope Boniface, concerning the affairs of Scotland, the King boasts of his Trojan predecessor in the following terms:—<Q REND="inline">Sub temporibus itaque Ely &amp; Samuelis prophetarum, vir quidam strenuus et insignis,

<P>I wish not to dwell invidiously on the failings of this immortal Genius; but it may be useful to remark, that no Historical work, though executed by a man of the highest mental abilities, can obtain a lasting reputation, if it be planned and written with a servility of spirit.—This was evidently the case in Bacon's History of Henry the VIIth.
<PB N="247" REF="247"/>
It was the first work he engaged in after his disgrace, and laid as a peace-offering at the feet of his master, the despicable James; who affected to consider his great grandfather, the abject and avaricious Henry, as the model of a King. It was therefore the aim of the unfortunate Historian to flatter this phantasy of the royal pedant, for whom he wrote; and he accordingly formed a colossal statue to represent a pigmy.—It is matter of astonishment that Lord Bolingbroke, who in his political works has written on the vices of this very King, with a force and beauty so superior to the History in question, should speak of it as a work possessing merit sufficient to bear a comparison with the ancients. On the contrary, the extreme awkwardness of the task which the Historian imposed upon himself, gave a weakness and embarrassment to his style, which in his nobler works is clear, nervous, and manly. This will particularly appear from a few lines in his character of Henry:—<Q REND="inline">"This King, to speak of him in terms equal to his deserving, was
<PB N="248" REF="248"/>
one of the best sort of wonders, a wonder for wise men. He had parts, both in his virtues and his fortune, not so fit for a common-place as for observation . . . . His worth may bear a tale or two, that may put upon him somewhat that may seem divine."</Q>—He then relates a dream of Henry's mother, the Lady Margaret: but the quotations I have made may be sufficient to justi∣fy my remark; and, as Dr. Johnson says hap∣pily of Milton, <Q REND="inline">"What Englishman can take delight in transcribing passages, which, if they lessen the reputation of Bacon, diminish in some degree the honour of our country?"</Q></P>

who has lately entered into a thorough dis∣cussion of all the anecdotes relating to this cele∣brated Conqueror, in a very elaborate and spirited dissertation, intitled, "Examen critique des His∣toriens d'Alexandre." Paris, 4to, 1775. But there is great probability in his conjecture, that the name of Aristobulus has slipt into the story by some mistake; and that the sycophant so justly reprimanded was Onesicritus, who attended the Hero of Macedon in quality of Historiographer, and is censured by the judicious Strabo, as the most fabulous of all the Writers who have en∣gaged in his History.

Indeed Dedications in general are but too com∣monly a disgrace to letters.—Perhaps a concise History of this species of writing, and the fate of some remarkable Dedicators, might have a good influence towards correcting that prostitution of talents, which is so often observed in productions of this nature: and such a work might be very amusing to the lovers of literary anecdote.—The two most unfortunate Dedications that occur to my remembrance, were written by Joshua Barnes, and Dr. Pearce, late Bishop of Roches∣ter: The first dedicated his History of Edward the IIId to James the IId, and unluckily com∣pared that Monarch to the most valiant of his predecessors, just before his timidity led him to abdicate the throne: the second dedicated his edition of Tully de Oratore to Lord Macclesfield, and as unluckily celebrated his patron as a model of public virtue, not many years before he was impeached in parliament, and fined £.30,000, for the iniquity of his conduct in the office of Chancellor.</P>

<P>After speaking so freely on the vices of this Monarch, it is but just to observe, that Philip, who possessed all the sedate cruelty of the cold∣blooded Octavius, resembled him also in one ami∣able quality, and was so much a friend to letters, that his reign may be considered as the Augustan age of Spanish literature.—His most bloody mi∣nister, the merciless Alva, was the Maecenas of that wonderful and voluminous Poet, Lope de Vega. I cannot help regretting that the two eminent Writers, who have lately delineated the

must content myself with barely referring my Reader to that amiable Moralist, as I fear I have already extended these Notes to such a length, as will expose me to the severity of criti∣cism.

The author, John Antony Vipe∣rani, was Bishop of Giovenazzo in 1588, and died 1610.—A Spanish essay, on the same subject, was printed in 1611, by Luis Cabrera de Cordo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a; but his performance has been eclipsed by the ater production of his celebrated countryman

Feyjoo, whose entertaining Essays on History were translated into English in 1779.—Holland produced, in 1623, the Ars Historica of Vos∣sius, and soon afterwards his more voluminous and valuable work on the Greek and Roman Historians.—The French language, so fertile in miscellaneous criticism, affords us many works that relate to Historical composition: the most extraordinary of these, is a very late publication by the Abbé Mably, "De la Maniere d'ecrire l' Histoire." As this insolent and dogmatical Author has grossly insulted our country, by vili∣fying our most eminent writers of History, I had thoughts of chastising his presumption by a full display of his various absurdities; but as this unpleasant office has been in some measure per∣formed by one of his own countrymen, under the title of a Supplement to his Work, I shall only make a few remarks on the illiberal terms in which he speaks of my friend Mr. Gibbon.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="262"/>
As the Abbé had only read a translated extract from the accomplished Historian, he certainly could not be a competent judge of the spirit and beauty of his immortal work. No matter: he had a private pique against the Author, and was therefore determined to decry his composition. In the blindness and precipitancy that usually belong to base anger, he attributes the defect of dullness to a Book, more universally read than any modern performance of equal magnitude.</P>
<P>The Abbé talks loudly of the literary virtues that become an Historian: but he seems to have forgot that there are literary vices, which may render even a learned and ingenious critic con∣temptible. No productions of the press are more disgraceful to literature, than those in which a dissertation on any art is made the vehicle of personal malignity: yet, as this is the most plausible and insinuating method of giving vent to malice, it is, perhaps, the most common. In the end, however, this species of
<PB N="263" REF="263"/>
literary slander defeats its own purpose; for, if the envious are pleased to echo it for a time, to more candid and generous readers it endears the merit it traduces. They lament the hard destiny of superior talents; and recollect, with a sigh of affectionate indignation, the just and spirited remark of Monsieur D' Alembert, <Q REND="inline">"Que les grands Genies sont toujours de chirés par des gens, qui ne sont pas dignes de les lire!"</Q></P>
