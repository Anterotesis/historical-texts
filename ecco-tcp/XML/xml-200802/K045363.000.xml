<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following petite piece, which is taken from Marmontel, was originally acted at Dr. Lane's Theatre, in the year 1775. It had then the good fortune of having its principal character represented by that ac∣complished actress Mrs. Abington, who has since very frequently performed the same on Covent Garden Stage. A new candidate for fame having undertaken to appear in this very agreeable and lively part; and the piece being often called for; it has been thought proper to give the Public an opportunity of perusing in the closet what has so long delighted on the stage.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE, <HI>An apartment in the Seraglio; a Throne in man∣ner of a Couch, with a Canopy, on the front of which is an Escutcheon fixed, with the Ottoman Arms crowned with Feathers; in the Back scenes the Sultan's Door covered with a Curtain.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER>OSMYN.</SPEAKER>
<P>TELL me, what right have you to be discontent∣ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>When first I came within these walls, I found myself a slave; and the thoughts of being shut up for ever here, terrified me to death: my tears flowed in∣cessantly: Solyman was moved with them, and solemnly promised to restore me to my liberty, my parents, and my country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet when the Sultan agreed to send you back to Georgia, you did not avail yourself of his generosi∣ty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but his munisicence, and above all the tenderness and love he expressed to me since, have re∣concil'd
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
me to this place, and I vainly thought my charms could have attach'd him to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then complain? You still possess his heart. Already you have been twice honour'd with the im∣perial handkerchief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>His heart! does not this place contain a hundred beauties who equally share his love? Tell the Sultan I'm determin'd, and ready to accept the first opportunity of returning to my friends and country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall procure you an answer this morning—But, hark! the Sultan approaches.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Elmira.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>The curtain is drawn, and the</HI> Sultan <HI>enters, preceded by Mutes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>A grand March played.</HI></STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend, quit this style of servitude; I am weary of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>And of the seraglio too, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>It even is so—and yet, upon reflection, I can∣not tell why, unless that, having been accustom'd to the noise of camps and the business of war, I know not how to relish pleasures, which, though varied, appear insipid, thro' the ease and tranquillity with which they are attained.—Your voice used to charm me.</P>

<LG>
<L>Behold yonder zephyr how lightly it blows,</L>
<L>And copying of lovers it ne'er seeks repose,</L>
<L>But flies to the pink, to the lily, the rose,</L>
<L>Caressing each flower of the garden and grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then still let your pleasure variety crown,</L>
<L>'Mongst the different beauties that rove up and down,</L>
<L>Court the charms of the fair, of the black, of the brown,</L>
<L>They're the flowers that embellish the garden of love.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often told you I am not touch'd with mere caressing machines, who are taught to love or fear by interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your highness must confess, your ser∣vant has neglected nothing perfectly to content, parti∣cularly in one object he procur'd you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Circaffian beauty—the Sultana Elmira.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And truly she possesses all the charms that can adorn her Sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>You thought so once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Once! I think so still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively—why should you doubt it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your word is my law. But, Sir, there is mat∣ter I must acquaint you with: I cannot manage the se∣raglio; and, by the beard of Heli, I would rather quit the helm I can no longer guide. That English slave lately brought here is quite ungovernable; she is sure to do every thing she is forbid; she makes a joke of our threats, and answers our most serious admonitions with a laugh: besides, she is at variance with the rest of the women, and shows them such an example, that I can∣not longer rule them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is your business—I will have them all agree—How do you call her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since she has been here, we have called her <HI>Roxa∣lana.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—You must endeavour to bring her to rea∣son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall the Sultana Elmira throw herself at your highness's feet then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let her come—And, do you hear, Osmyn, go to the apartment of that Persian slave you spoke of yester∣day, she that sings so well, and send her hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will most sublime Sultan.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Osmyn.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Elmira. <HI>She kneels.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know before-hand that you come to upbraid me—We have not met so often lately as our mutual inclinations wou'd have made agreeable; but don't at∣tribute that to coldness which has been the unavoidable consequence of affairs—the business of the Divan has taken up so much of my time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't presume to complain; for your image is so imprinted on my heart, that you are always present to my mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>impatiently.</HI>)</STAGE> Nay, dear Elmira, I have not the least doubt.</P>

<P>How does my sovereign like this robe which I have put on, on purpose to please him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, <STAGE>(<HI>yawning,</HI>)</STAGE> Elmira, you love music—I have sent for the Persian slave, who I am told sings so well;—if she answers the description, she will afford you entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>I want none when you are present; your com∣pany suffices for every thing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beautiful Ismena, methought that song did not so well express the effects of love—Madam, <STAGE>(<HI>to</HI> El∣mira),</STAGE> we will hear her again—I never heard any thing so charming—her voice is exquisite—What do you think of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>El.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she hears all this, 'twill make her vain—I can∣not bear all this—I am ready to burst with indignation and anger.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Elmira.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is something in this slave that interests me in her favour; she shall be received among the Sultana's attendants, and by that means we shall have an oppor∣tunity of hearing her often— <STAGE>[<HI>Turning, perceives</HI> Elmira <HI>gone.</HI>]</STAGE>—But where's the Sultana? I did not perceive she had lest us—Follow her, Ismena, and endeavour to amuse her.</P>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Ismena.</STAGE>

<P>I come to tell your Highness, there is no bearing that English slave; she says such things, and does such things, that—</P>

<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is't she does?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>She mimics me—nay, and mimics you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, pho.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Advice is lost upon her—When I attempt to give it, she falls a singing and dancing—There is no en∣during it, if you do not permit me to correct her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>You take these things in too serious a light—She seems indeed a singular character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has the impudence of the devil: but just now I threatened to complain to you of her, she said she would complain of me; and here she comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Roxalana.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, heaven be prais'd, at least here is some∣thing like a human figure. You are, Sir, I suppose the sublime Sultan, whose slave I have the honour to be: if so, pray oblige me so far as to drive from your presence that horrid ugly creature there: for he shocks my sight.— <STAGE>(<HI>To</HI> Osmyn)</STAGE>—Do you hear? Go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>gravely.</HI>)</STAGE> They complain, Roxalana, of your irreverent behaviour; you must learn to treat the officers of our Seraglio, whom we have set over you, with more deference—All in this place honour their superi∣ors, and obey in silence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rex.</SPEAKER>
<P>In silence!—and obey! is this a sample of your Turkish gallantry—You must be vastly lov'd indeed, if you address women in that strain</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider you are not now in your own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox,</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; you make me feel the difference se∣verely—There reigns ease, content, and liberty; every citizen is himself a king, where the king is himself a citizen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a humour more gentle and pliable; I advise you to alter your behaviour for very good reasons; and it is for your good: there are very rigorous laws in the Seraglio for such as are refractory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, you have made a very delicate speech, and I admire the gravity with which it was ut∣tered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Roxalana, I am serious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does your Highness think now? Did I tell you the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, whispering—What is it that monster says?—that what-do-you-call-him, that good-for-nothing amphibious animal, who follows us like sheep here, and is for ever watching us with his frightful glaring eyes, as if he would devour us—Is this the confidante of your pleasures—the guardian of our chastity?—I must do him the justice to confess that if you give him money for making himself hated, he certainly does not steal his wages. We can't step one step but he is after us; by and by, I suppose, he will weigh out air and measure light to us; he won't let us walk in the gardens, lest it should rain men upon us; and if it did, 'tis a blessing we've been long wishing for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now; don't she go on at a fine rate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mind that ugly creature, but listen to me.—If you follow my counsel I shall make you an accom∣plish'd prince—I wish to make you belov'd—Let your window-bars be taken down—let the doors of the Sera∣glio be thrown open—let inclination alone keep your women within it; and instead of that ugly odious crea∣ture there, send a handsome smart young officer to us every morning; one that will treat us like ladies, and lay out the pleasure of the day.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>While she is speaking,</HI> Solyman <HI>admires her.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>to</HI> Osmyn.)</STAGE> Did you ever see so expressive a coun∣tenance— <STAGE>(<HI>To</HI> Rox.)</STAGE> Have you any more to say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, this—To desire you will not mind him, but attend to me—Men were not born to ad∣vise—the thing is expressly the contrary—We women have certainly ten thousand times more sense—Men, in∣deed!—Men were born for no other purpose under heaven, but to amuse us; and he who succeeds best, perfectly answers the end of his creation—Now, Sir, farewell. If I find you profit by my first lesson, I may perhaps be tempted to give you another.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever hear the like, Sir?—Her insolence is not to be borne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it amusing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall certainly lose all my authority in the Sera∣glio, if she is not corrected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a girl—a sool of a disposition, that chastise∣ment would make worse—Go after her, Osmyn, bid her come back and drink therbet with me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sherbet with you, Sir?</P>

<P>I have said it— <STAGE>(<HI>Goes on the throne, takes a pipe.</HI>)</STAGE> Well, for my life, I can't get the better of my asto∣nishment, at hearing a slave talk in so extraordinary a manner— <STAGE>(<HI>Smokes.</HI>)</STAGE>—And the more I think of it, my a∣stonishment is the greater—She's not handsome, that is, what is call'd a beauty; yet her little nose, cock'd in the air, her laughing eyes, and the play of her features, have an effect all together—Elmira has something more soft and more majestic—yet, methinks, I have a mind to sift Roxalana's character; mere curiosity, and nothing else—It is the first time we have seen in this place a spirit of caprice and independence—I'll try at least what she'll say to me farther—There can be no harm to divert myself with her extravagance.</P>

<P>No matter for her being in her chamber—What did she say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Os.</SPEAKER>
<P>Treasure of Light, said I—through the key-hole,—I come from the Sublime Sultan to kiss the dust be∣neath your feet, and desire you will come and drink sherbet with him. She answer'd through the key-hole, Go tell your master, I have no dust on my feet, and I don't like sherbet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>In effect, Osmyn, the fault is yours;—you took your time ill, as you commonly do—You should have waited some time—don't you owe her respect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And after this, wou'd you have her come again?</P>

<P>Shall I fetch the Sultana Elmira too?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it is only what I expected—You Turks are not reckoned very polite—In my country, a gal∣lant waits upon a lady; but the custom is quite different here I find—</P>

<P>This is not to be suffer'd—and yet there's some∣thing so foolish in it too—Come hither, Roxalana, I want to speak to you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I thank you; I am very well where I am.</P>

<P>Tell me then, is it in this light manner women behave in England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Pretty near it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And suppose I wou'd for once forget your na∣tional vivacity, would it make you more cautious for the future?—Come, give me your hand; and you may imagine I have forgot all you have said to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse for you. I told you a great many good things;—I see my frankness is disagreeable; but you must grow us'd to it. Don't you think your∣self very happy to find a friend in a slave? one that will teach you how to love too; for 'tis in my country love is in its element. It is there all life and tenderness, because it is free; and yet even there, a husband be∣lov'd is next to a prodigy.—If it be then so difficult to love a husband, what must it be to love a master? I am your friend; I tell you truth:—and do you know why you dislike to hear it?—because it is a language your ears are unaccustom'd to—But I don't mind that; I shall make you well acquainted with it—Happy would it be for every prince, had they a friend near them to tell them the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must treat me with respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, won't you consider who I am, and who you are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rox.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who I am, and who you are! Yes, Sir, I do consider very well that you are the Grand Sultan; I am your slave; but I am also a free-born woman, prouder of that than all the pomp and splendour eastern monarchs can bestow.</P>

<L>Will Garrick's nonsense never have an end?</L>
<L>Not so, <HI>Sir</HI> Mac, who just has cross'd the Tweed,</L>
<L>Cries, Vary weel, ridiculous indeed!</L>
<L>The cheeld has parts; ah, he'd been muckle keen,</L>
<L>If bred at Glasgow, or at Aberdeen!</L>
<L>Sir Paddy lays, "My jewel, that's mighty pretty:</L>
<L>"Faith Garrick, you were once in Dublin city;</L>
<L>"In sweet Smock-alley, you have cut a figure,</L>
<L>"Oh, you'd be great were you a little bigger."</L>
<L>Thus na ions, parties, all in this agree:</L>
<L>And humour's palm, oh Garrick! yield to thee:</L>
<L>Then, good Sir, scribble something new for me.</L>
<L><PB REF="22"/>
To Garrick thus in flattering strains I sue,</L>
<L>But all in vain, nor prayers nor flattery do.</L>
<L>Since thus <HI>obdurate,</HI> all their aid refuse,</L>
<L>I, a mere novice, must invoke the Muse.</L>
<L>Oh would immortal Shakespear's <HI>muse</HI> of <HI>fire,</HI></L>
<L>Heave in my breast, each <HI>kindling</HI> thought inspire;</L>
<L>Or cou'd I mount on the Moeonian wing,</L>
<L>Or chant such songs as <HI>raptur'd</HI> Seraphs sing;</L>
<L>To you, my kind protectors, wou'd I raise</L>
<L>My fullest, loudest, warmest notes of praise:</L>
<L>The great, the brave, the fair, who now appear</L>
<L>In bright array to grace this circle here,</L>
<L>My Muse to late stages should proclaim,</L>
<L>Their worth record, and consecrate their fame;</L>
<L>While gratitude on <HI>rapturous</HI> pinions soars,</L>
<L>And echoes loud the virtues she adores.</L>
