<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 1. [I that of late]</P>
<Q>Rle ego qui quondam, &amp;c.</Q>
<BIBL>VIRGIL; or somebody for him.</BIBL></NOTE>I THAT of late, Sir William's Bard, and Squire,</L>
<L>March'd with his helm and buckler on my lyre,</L>
<L>(What time the Knight prick'd forth in ill-starr'd haste,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 4. [Works of taste]</P>
<P>Put synonimously for his Majesty's works.</P>
<P>See Sir <HI>Wil∣liam's title page.</HI></P></NOTE>Comptroller General of the works of taste,)</L>
<L N="5"><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Now to the Public tune my grateful lays,</L>
<L>Warm'd with the sun-shine of the Public praise;</L>
<L>Warm'd too with mem'ry of that golden time,</L>
<L>When Almon gave me reason for my rhyme;</L>
<L>—glittering orbs, and, what endear'd them more,</L>
<L N="10">Each glittering orb the sacred features bore</L>
<L>Of George the good, the gracious, and the great,</L>
<L>Unfil'd, unsweated, all of sterling weight;</L>
<L>Or, were they not, they pass'd with current ease,</L>
<L>Good seemings then were good realities:</L>
<L N="15">No Senate had convey'd, by smuggling art,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 16. [Cadogan's part] Master of the Mint.</P></NOTE>Pow'r to the mob to play Cadogan's part;</L>
<L>Now, thro' the land, that impious pow'r prevails,</L>
<L>All weigh their Sov'reign in their private scales,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 19. [And find him wanting.] Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Daniel, chap. 8, v. 27.</P></NOTE>And find him wanting: all save me alone,</L>
<L N="20">For, sad to say! my glittering orbs are gone.</L>
<L>But ill beseems a Poet to repent,</L>
<L>Lightly they came, and full as lightly went.</L>
<L>Peace to their manes! may they never feel</L>
<L>Some keen Scotch banker's unrelenting steel;</L>
<L N="25">While I again the Muse's sickle bring</L>
<L>To cut down Dunces, wheresoe'er they spring,</L>
<L>Bind in poetic sheaves the plenteous crop,</L>
<L>And stack my full-ear'd load in Almon's shop.</L>
<L>For now, my Muse, thy fame is fixt as fate,</L>
<L N="30">Tremble ye Fools I scorn, ye Knaves I hate;</L>
<L>I know the vigour of thy eagle wings,</L>
<L>I know thy strains can pierce the ear of Kings.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Did China's monarch here in Britain doze,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 34. [A King of Prose.] Kien-Long, the present Emperor of China is a poet. M. de Voltaire did him the honour to treat him as a brother above two years ago; and my late patron, Sir William Chambers, has given a fine and most intelligible prose version of an ode of his Majesty upon tea, in his postscript to his Dissertation. I am, how∣ever, vain enough to think, that the Emperor's composition would have appeared still bet∣ter in my heroic verse; but Sir William forestalled it; on which account I have entirely broke with him.</P></NOTE>And was, like western Kings, a King of Prose,</L>
<L N="35">Thy song could cure his Asiatic spleen,</L>
<L>And make him wish to see and to be seen;</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 37. [That solemn vein of irony.] "A sine vein of solemn irony runs through this piece." See <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> under the article of the Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers.</P></NOTE>That solemn vein of irony so fine,</L>
<L>Which, e'en Reviewers own, adorns thy line,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Would make him soon against his greatness sin,</L>
<L N="40">Desert his sofa, mount his palanquin,</L>
<L>And post where'er the Goddess led the way,</L>
<L>Perchance to proud Spithead's imperial bay;</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 43. [There should he see.] A certain naval event happened just about two calendar months after the publication of the Heroic Epistle. 'Twas impossible, consider∣ing the necessary preparations, it could have been sooner. Facts are stubborn things.</P></NOTE>There should he see, as other folks have seen,</L>
<L>That ships have anchors, and that seas are green,</L>
<L N="45">Should own the tackling trim, the streamers fine,</L>
<L>With Sandwich prattle, and with Bradshaw dine,</L>
<L>And then sail back, amid the cannon's roar,</L>
<L>As safe, as sage, as when he left the shore.</L>
<L>Such is thy pow'r, O Goddess of the song,</L>
<L N="50">Come then and guide my careless pen along;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Yet keep it in the bounds of sense and verse,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 52. [Nor like Mac-Homer.] See, if the reader thinks it worth while, a late translation of the Iliad.</P></NOTE>Nor, like Mac-Homer, make me gabble Erse.</L>
<L>No, let the flow of these spontaneous rhymes</L>
<L>So truly touch the temper of the times,</L>
<L N="55">That he who runs may read; while well he knows</L>
<L>I write in metre, what he thinks in prose;</L>
<L>So shall my song, undisciplin'd by art,</L>
<L>Find a sure patron in each English heart.</L>
<L>If this it's fate, let all the frippery things</L>
<L N="60">Be-plac'd, be-pension'd, and be-starr'd by Kings,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 62. [Like old young Fannius.] The noble personage here alluded to, being asked to read the Heroic Epistle, said, "No, it was as bad as blasphemy."</P><P>Verse 62. [Fannius.] Before I sent the M. S. to the press, I discovered, that an ac∣cidental blot had made all but the first syllable of this name illegible. I was doubtful, therefore, whether to print it Fannius or Fannia. After much deliberation, I thought it best to use the masculine termination. If I have done wrong, I ask pardon, not only of the Author, but the Lady. <HI>The Editor.</HI></P>

</NOTE>Frown on the page, and with fastidious eye,</L>
<L>Like old young Fannius, call it blasphemy.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Let these prefer a levee's harmless talk,</L>
<L>Be ask'd how often, and how far they walk,</L>
<L N="65">Proud of a single word, nor hope for more,</L>
<L>Tho' Jenkinson is blest with many a score:</L>
<L>For other ears my honest number sound,</L>
<L>With other praise those numbers shall be crown'd,</L>
<L>Praise that shall spread, no pow'r can make it less,</L>
<L N="70">While Britain boasts the bulwark of her press.</L>
<L>Yes, sons of freedom! yes, to whom I pay,</L>
<L>Warm from the heart, this tributary lay;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
That lay shall live, tho' Court and Grub-street sigh,</L>
<L>Your young Marcellus was not born to die.</L>
<L N="75">The Muse shall nurse him up to man's estate,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Verse 76. [And break the black asperity of fate.]</P>
<Q><L>—"Si qua fata aspera rumpas,</L>
<L>Tu Marcellus eris."</L>
<BIBL>VIRGIL.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>And break the black asperity of fate—</L>
<L>Admit him then your candidate for fame,</L>
<L>Pleas'd if in your review he read his name,</L>
<L>Tho' not with Mason and with Goldsmith put,</L>
<L N="80">Yet cheek by jowl with Garrick, Colman, Foote;</L>
<L>But if with higher Bards that name you range,</L>
<L>His modesty must think your judgment strange—</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
So when o'er Crane-Court's philosophic Gods,</L>
<L>The Jove-like majesty of Pringle nods,</L>
<L N="85">If e'er he chance to wake on Newton's chair,</L>
<L>He "wonders how the devil he came there."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whate'er his fame or fate, on this depend;</L>
<L>He is, and means to be his country's friend.</L>
<L>'Tis but to try his strength that now he sports</L>
<L N="90">With Chinese gardens, and with Chinese courts:</L>
<L>But if that country claim a graver strain,</L>
<L>If real danger threat fair Freedom's reign,</L>
<L>If hireling P**rs, in prostitution bold,</L>
<L>Sell her as cheaply as themselves they sold;</L>
<L N="95">Or they, who honour'd by the People's choice,</L>
<L>Against that People lift their rebel voice,</L>
<L>And, basely crouching for their paltry pay,</L>
<L>Vote the best birthright of her sons away,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
Permit a nation's in-born wealth to fly</L>
<L N="100">In mean, unkingly prodigality;</L>
<L>Nor, e'er they give, ask how the sums were spent,</L>
<L>So quickly squander'd, tho' so lately lent—</L>
<L>If this they dare; the thunder of his song,</L>
<L>Rolling in deep-ton'd energy along,</L>
<L N="105">Shall strike, with Truth's dread bolt, each miscreant's name,</L>
<L>Who, dead to duty, senseless e'en to shame</L>
<L>Betray'd his country. Yes, ye faithless crew,</L>
<L>His Muse's vengeance shall your crimes pursue,</L>
<L>Stretch you on satire's rack, and bid you lie</L>
<L N="110">Fit garbage for the hell-hound, Infamy.</L>
