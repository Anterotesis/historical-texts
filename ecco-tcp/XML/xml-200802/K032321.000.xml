<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOung Authors, like young Wives, are lyable to distrust their own Conduct in every thing; and, whilst they fear venturing too far, are apt to stop short, and rob their Benefactors of those Ac∣knowledgments they justly deserve: Or, by useing too loose a Rein, unavoidably
<PB REF="3"/>
run into Adulation. But I need fear neither of these Censures, since your Modesty, which is so conspicuous, will pardon one, and your Character be a sufficient defence against t'other, for 'tis impossible to say more of you than you deserve.</P>
<P>To attempt your Character, wou'd be too daring an Undertaking; For what Pen, besides your own, cou'd express that just Thought, lively Fancy, flowing and easy Language, that adorn those Pieces, which, like inestimable Jewels, too valu∣able for common use, are reserv'd for the Entertainment of your happy Friends? Your luckly Genius in Poetry, and your peculiar tast for Musick, proclaim you the Muses Darling; for you they reserve their choicest Favours: And, indeed, without such Qualifications, no Man can have a true Relish for Productions of this kind; and the most Excellent Pieces, wou'd be entertain'd with Coldness and Contempt.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
How I have perform'd in the follow∣ing Scenes, is neither possible, nor pro∣per for me to determine; 'tis Praise e∣nough, that you have given me leave to lay it at your Feet, which I prefer be∣fore the vain Applause of clapping Mul∣titudes; nor cou'd I ever excuse it, either to the World, or my self, if I slipt any opportunity of publishing the Honour you do me: 'Tis a Vanity we are all lyable to, and we glory in the Ex∣cellencies of our Patron. Besides the advantage, 'tis a piece of Justice due to this Poem, and my self, to fly for Sanctu∣ary to one who is most apt to Pardon, be∣cause the most capable to Judge; and has himself not only approv'd, but also, by his inimitable Performance, Correct∣ed and Refin'd upon the most pleasant parts of Poetry.</P>
<P>To conculde, Sir, (for I wou'd, above all things, avoid being too Prolix) give me leave to joyn my hearty Wishes with
<PB REF="5"/>
the rest of Mankind, for your long con∣tinuing, as you are, a great Incourager, and principle Ornament of all Polite Li∣terature, and Gentile Accomplishments, to the unspeakable Happiness of all your Friends, among whom to find a place, is the highest Ambition of</P>

<P>HOW do Men labour to fool themselves! What Pains did I spare, or Excuse did I not invent, to perswade my Friends I was going another way, to get rid of their troublesome Ceremony, that wou'd have waited on me home; and all this for an Opportunity only of taking a Turn or two before this Window.</P>
<P>Oh Love! How powerful are thy Charms, thus to unman, and send me like a Boy, gaping after Imaginary Joys.</P>
<P>Not all the Hazards of a Soldier's Life cou'd half so much assect me, as the dreadful Apprehension of displeasing this Girl.</P>
<P>Whatever I do, whether I Eat or Drink, whether I Sleep or Wake, whether I'm at home alone, or abroad in Company, my Thoughts are still of her: She's always present, I can see nothing
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
but her, I can hear nothing but her, I can think of nothing but her; and in short, I care for nothing but her.</P>
<P>'Tis Happiness enough for any Man to love and be beloved by such a Woman, She's so Beautiful, so Agreeable, and so Loving; yet so Virtuous, so Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and so Constant, that it her Fathers rigid Opposition were remov'd, nothing cou'd add to the Blessing lyes in store for me.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Capt. <HI>Bellmein,</HI> goes within two or three yards of the door, then stops short, looks up.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ho, this must be the House—But what the Devil am I the better for't, the Doors are lock'd, Windows bar'd, my Mistress asleep, and I may return like an Ass as I came, without so much as being dream'd of—Can Love, that never fails his Votaries at a pinch, inspire no Stratagem now? Egad I was never more able to offer him a plentiful Sacrifice; and did my Mistress know with what warm Desires I come, she'd meet me half way, or she deserves to dye a Maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more I think, I still perplex my self the more; like a poor Fly in a Spiders Web, by labouring to get loose, I work my self faster in the Toyl.</P>
<P>And why shou'd I struggle any longer with what I can't master? or desire to be without what I'm perswaded is the greatest Blessing in the World—</P>
<P>I'm resolv'd I will Love on— <STAGE>[Turns short upon the Captain.]</STAGE> Ha! a Man, and if I mistake not, mad <HI>Bellmein,</HI> whom I left at the Rose, he's upon some Amorous Design, but is too open to hide any thing from his Friend, I'll accost him.</P>
<P>Good-morrow Captain, I commend your early Industry, you are choosing some fortify'd piece of Virtue to lay a manly Siege to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, Colonel, Good-morrow to you with all my heart: No, Faith, I never stay the Formality of a Siege; 'tis you honourable Lovers are forc'd to undergo that Drudgery; whene're I meet any, as I rarely do, that resist the shock of my first assault, I fairly draw off to the next, who are sure to surrender upon more easie Terms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you take all by Storm, Plunder the Garrison, Fire their Quarters, and march off in Triumph.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I do can't be comprehended by constant p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leing Lovers.</P>
<P>They can't bear those strong Joys we suck from our lusty Draughts of Love; like weak-sighted Birds, they fly about in the twilight of Pleasure, not able to bear the Meridional Heat and Pleasure of it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
One kind glance crowns all your Hopes, and raises you to the highest Happiness; but then a Frown, or sower look, Colonel, throws you down again to despair. So that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care <HI>Captain,</HI> how far you launch out in this strain, lest you be too like our Modern Widows, who exclaim most against a second Husband, when they are just upon the point of having one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that from my laughing at honourable Lovers, as you call them, you wou'd learnedly infer I am one my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay Railery apart, it has been seriously observ'd that you are—</P>

<P>How! Faith I think my self the same Man, I have the same Appetites, the same Desires, that ever I had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but you saunter about in Solitary places, avoid your Acquaintance, and when you can't escape them, art more uneasie than a rich Miser with a borrowing Friend: And here now I find you out of your way, addressing your self to senceless Wood and Stone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, my Friend, but this senseless Wood includes a more beautiful <HI>Daphne</HI> than e're the Delian God pursued, a Girl so bright, so sparkling, and what recommends her much more to me, so coming, <STAGE>[Embraces him]</STAGE> that had she liv'd in the days of <HI>Venus,</HI> she wou'd have rival'd that Goddess, and out-done her too in her own At∣tributes.</P>

<P>Have a care you don't mis-place your Worship, for to my particular knowledge no such Person lodges in this House.</P>

<P>To my more particular knowledge such a Person does lodge in this House, and in the Room that looks out at that Window too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! <HI>Clarinda</HI> lodges there, 'tis true; but that she's such as he describes is false—Yet she's a Woman, and where Dissem∣bling grows so much in use, Perfection must be a Stranger. I'll for a while lay by the implicit Lover for the more inquisitive jealous Man, and try him farther. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Well, I may be deceiv'd, but how do you know you are not so too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Faith, since I know you to be an honest Fellow, and a Man of Honour, I don't care if I trust you with the Secret, upon condition your assistance shan't be wanting upon occasion.</P>

<P>Not tell me her Name! then I shall think you trin'd with me all this while, and scorn the Friendship I offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll rather tell you all I know, but as for her Name Faith and Troth I know no more hers than she does mine, her desire to be un∣known her self, made her the less pressing, I suppose, so that we freely pass amongst our selves for <HI>Celadon</HI> and <HI>Cloe,</HI> as you may see by this Song, if you'll be at the pains of Reading it; 'tis the last I sent her, and tho' inconsiderable in it self, receives from her Voice inestemable value.</P>

<P>Before you came to Town, my Father forbid him the House, with any farther Pretentions to me, upon Sir <HI>William</HI>'s account, to whom his Honour was engag'd before he saw him, or else I believe his Follies wou'd have out-weigh'd his Estate, for he you know—</P>

<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>O quite contrary; for Women of Sense strive to distinguish themselves, by their choice of Asses fit to bear their Burdens: Be∣sides, Cousin, if you hate him, you can never get it in your power to torment him, more than by marrying him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir VVill.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Law shou'd make better provision for Men's Clothes too; for the Insolence of the Vulgar is insufferable, and if one or two of them were made examples, the rest wou'd be more Cautious.</P>
<P>One Night after Play, I waited on a Lady from the Box to her Coach, comes a clumsy Cit, with a paultry Mask out of the Gallery, rush'd against me, threw down the Ladies Page, brusht all the Pow∣der out of my Wig, then cry'd ha, ha, ha, we have ruin'd the Beau; had I been a Lord, I wou'd have run him through the Guts, but to be try'd by a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iddlesex-Jury</HI> is the Devil.</P>

<P>Ay—these vulgar, as you call them, have a greater re∣spect for Men's Lives, than to suffer that Man to escape that kills one of them. But I suppose your Principle concern rises from your loss of the Ladies favour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir VVill.</SPEAKER>
<P>It had no such essect on her, I assure you, Sir; where∣ever I get sooting in a Ladies Esteem, I stand too firm to be justled out by a Cit; as for Instance, I'll give you another adventure of mine, Being engag'd by Appointment to meet a Lady at <HI>VVhite's,</HI> and detain'd by some extraordinary business, the Lady chanc'd to be there in her Coach as soon as I arriv'd in mine, so that lighting out of my Coach to go to hers, a nasty Fellow running just against me,
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
almost beat me backward; and, tho' he did it designedly, yet cry'd Zounds, can't you see! Your Wig blinds you does it! so taking one side, gave it such a toss over my Shoulder, that, had not the Lady been passionatly in Love with my Person, the disorder I appear'd in might have spoil'd my Amour.</P>

<P>Why so I am, Sir—Why is it not possible to be acquainted without speaking, Gentlemen? Why a Friend of mine lay all night with a Lady, and never saw her Face, nor knows not who she is to this moment; now I think seeing is of greater consequence than speaking. But you shall hear how far I'm acquainted with this Lady; I lodge at her Milleners, you must know, and I have several times pass'd through the Shop when she has been in't, and as soon as my Back has been turn'd, she has always taken an occasion to commend me, and say something extraordinary in my praise, which my Land∣lady never fail'd to tell me, but with such an Air, as if she was de∣sired
<PB N="18" REF="25" MS="y"/>
to tell me. Then if she sees me walking here—as I generally do every Morning, she straight repairs to the Window—thus do you see—stend you there—Now suppose me the Lady—you look up at my Window and walk thus, do you see?—Then I run to the Window thus—clap my Arms a-cross thus—and hang my Head thes—turn my Eyes languishing thus—as who shou'd say, if it were the Custom for Women to make the first Addresses, I wou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en you up.</P>

<P>As I say, Sir, that I'm no more what you once knew me; since your abode in <HI>Ireland,</HI> my Uncle, who kept me from my Estate, is dead, thank Heaven, and I now am Mistress of a Fortune sufficient for my use; and, had I possest it sooner, I never had been what I was: But now, I scorn Mankind on terms like those, all Inno∣cent Diversions I freely take, I keep the best Company, pay and re∣ceive Visits from the highest Quality, People who are better bred than to examine into past Conduct.</P>

<P>You are not Insensible, Cousin, how resoloutely my cruel Father Persecutes me with this Fop; therefore, since poor <HI>Cla∣rinda</HI> is in all this Danger, I my own Knight-Errant, and thou my trusty Squire, will March <HI>Encavalier,</HI> and deliver the di∣stress'd Damsel, by beating the Giant into a Pigmy, then be our own Heralds, and proclaim our Victory to my Father, and hollow the Coward so loud in his Ears, that we will shame him out of all Thoughts of this Fool.</P>

<P>He is the very Quintessence of Fopery; his Name and Nature suits exactly, for he's a nice Observer of the Modes; his Valet is forc'd to Counterfeit a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> or he would turn him away.</P>

<P>Right, I think a Gentleman ought to wear a Sharp for a terror to the Vulgar, and because 'tis the Fashion; but he shou'd never use it but as an Ornament, and part of his Dress, I hope to see it as much a Fashion to Fight with Files, as 'tis to Fence with them.

<SPEAKER>Col. Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, but why wou'd you be defenceless? Faith Sir <HI>William</HI> if this News reaches your Mistress's Ears, it will ruin you in her Favour. Take this for a Rule, the less regard you have for your Honour the more you sink in the Esteem of your Mistress, for all Women hate a Coward; you ought to be forbid the Habits of Men, who can be guilty of Esseminency that even Women would blush at.</P>

<L>YOƲ see, Gallants, 't has been our Poets Care</L>
<L>To shew what Beaux in their Perfection are,</L>
<L>By Nature <HI>Cowards, foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish, usele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fools,</HI></L>
<L>Made <HI>Men</HI> by <HI>Tay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors,</HI> and by <HI>Women, Fools:</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckle, False,</HI> a <HI>Singing, Dancing</HI> Crew,</L>
<L>Nay now we hear they've <HI>Smiling Masters</HI> too;</L>
<L>Just now a <HI>Frenchman</HI> in the Dressing Room,</L>
<L>From Teaching of a Beau to Smile, was come,</L>
<L>He shew'd five G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—War'nt he rarely paid,</L>
<L>Thus all the World by <HI>Smiles</HI> are once betray'd;</L>
<L>The <HI>States Man</HI> Smiles on them he wou'd <HI>Undo,</HI></L>
<L>The Courtier's <HI>Smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> are very seldom <HI>True,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Lovers</HI> Smiles too many do believe,</L>
<L>And Women <HI>Smile</HI> on them they wou'd Deceive;</L>
<L>When <HI>Trades-Men</HI> Smile, they safely <HI>Cheat</HI> with Ease,</L>
<L>And <HI>Smiling Lawyers</HI> never fail of <HI>Fees.—</HI></L>
<L>The Doctor's Look the Patient's Pain beguiles,</L>
<L>The Sick Man <HI>lives.</HI> if the <HI>Physician Smiles:</HI></L>
<L>Thus <HI>Smiles</HI> with Interest hand in hand do go,</L>
<L>He surest Strikes, that Smiling gives the Blow;</L>
<L>Poets, with us, this Proverb do Defy,</L>
<L>We live by <HI>Smiles,</HI> for if you <HI>Frown</HI> we die.</L>
<L>To Please you then shall be our chief Endeavour,</L>
<L>And all we ask, is but your Smiles for Ever.</L>

<L>Hold—I forget, The Author bid me say,</L>
<L>She humbly begs Protection for her Play:</L>
<L>'Tis Yours—She Dedicates, it to you all,</L>
<L>And sure you're too Gen'rous, to let it fall;</L>
<L>She hopes the Ladies will her Cause Maintain,</L>
<L>Since Virtue here has been her only Aim.</L>
<L>The Beaux, she thinks, won't fail to do her Right,</L>
<L>Since here they're taught with safety how to Fight.</L>
<L>She's sure of Favour from the Men of War,</L>
<L>A Soldier is her Darling Character;</L>
<L>To fear their M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs then wou'd be absurd,</L>
<L>They only Mutiny when not Prefer'd:</L>
<L>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, I see, she does your Fury dread,</L>
<L>And like a Prisoner, stands with fear half Dead,</L>
<L>While you are Judges, do her Sentence give,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you're not pleat'd, she says she cannot live.</L>
<L>Let my Petition then for once prevail,</L>
<L>And let your gen'rous Claps her Pardon Seal.</L>
