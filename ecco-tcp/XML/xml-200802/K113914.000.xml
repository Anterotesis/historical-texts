<P>THE MUSICAL TOUR OF <HI>Mr. DIBDIN</HI>; IN WHICH—PREVIOUS TO HIS EMBARKATION FOR INDIA—HE FINISHED HIS CAREER AS A PUBLIC CHARACTER.</P>

<P>SHEFFIELD: PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY J. GALES, AND SOLD BY ALL THE BOOKSELLERS THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM. M,DCC,LXXXVIII.</P>

<P>THIS WORK, WITH PRIDE OF HEART, HUMBLE DEFERENCE, AND GRATEFUL SUSCEPTIBILITY, <HI>IS INSCRIBED</HI> TO THE PRINCE OF WALES, BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S MOST FERVENTLY DEVOTED AND OBEDIENT SERVANT, <HI>Charles Dibdin.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to announce, by way of advertisement, that on account of the prodi∣gious circuit this TOUR comprehends; the unavoidable alterations as to the time of its pub∣lication; and a variety of other concurrent circumstances—the whole of the subscribers' names were not received in time to <HI>extend</HI> the number of this impression, which, from the uncertainty of what might be its reception, I have to lament was fixed <HI>ab origine</HI> at <HI>six hundred.</HI> The following list contains names for five hundred and fifty-seven copies—the re∣mainder of the impression I mean to take with me to INDIA—which I flatter myself will not be deemed an offence by those who have subscribed and cannot be supplied, as it will be im∣possible, my engagements being already made, to wait for the second edition, though it is already begun.</P>
<P>It would be departing from every principle I have professed, to consider the overplus subscribers—who I am proud to notice already amount to nearly two hundred—as <HI>chance customers</HI>; it would be as unfair not to act upon the plan of <HI>first come first served</HI>; those ladies and gentlemen therefore—many of whose names have been procured through the conspi∣cuous patronage which gives such lustre to this work, and would consequently HEIGHTEN AND ADORN IT—are requested to observe, that in six weeks, a much larger impression will be published, when they will be supplied with copies, and their names added to the list. It is proper also to specify—to put every thing upon an equitable footing—that no person will be considered as a non subscriber till the 12th of June—previous to which day subscribers names will be received by Mr. PRESTON, at his Music Warehouse, No. 97, in the Strand.</P>
<P>I cannot finish this advertisement without lamenting that a prior engagement obliges Mr. GALES to relinquish printing the second edition of this publication; in consequence of which it is begun in LONDON—where even if the original should be improved upon, it will be no triumph, as there will not be the same disadvantages to encounter.</P>
<P>For all further particulars, the public is respectfully referred to such articles in the newspapers as will be published through that authority I shall leave behind me.</P>

<P>I am perfectly aware that no man ought to obtrude himself unnecessarily on the public—but when chance has thrown in the way of even the meanest individual occasion to remark on a variety of matters that lead to such information as may afford general or particular instruction and amusement, I know no reason why such a labour should not aspire to popular notice.</P>
<P>Upon this principle—I address, to the best judge I know of all general subjects, whether natural or acquired, my MUSICAL TOUR. In which I have had opportunity, at different times, to laugh, to deplore, to pity, and applaud—it has excited, in some instances, my astonishment; in others, my indifference; it has called forth my warmest gratitude, and moved my ineffable contempt.</P>
<P>The provocation of these different feelings, of course, had its rise from my different public and individual reception. I have been lost in admiration
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
at the benignant liberality of one man in power, and obliged to shelter myself under a sort of contemptuous compassion at the ignorant importance of another. I have been charmed to wonder at professional candour, and I have smiled, un∣moved, at professional envy. I have warmed to delight at instances of private friendship, and have beheld with unhappiness, and forgiven, wanton attempts to do me private injuries.</P>
<P>As for my public reception, it has been flattering in the extreme, as far as it relates to applause. I wish I could say the same as to profit. One advan∣tage I have certainly reaped from it—my country experience has given me a more competent view of popular opinion than all I had before done. I believe it may be owing to my having conversed with my audience, and taken them at the moment I made them feel. Among the number, however, who have at∣tended me, I shall not easily forget the few who are firmly convinced I am a most impudent impostor—for that Mr. DIBDIN amassed so large a fortune by the <HI>Padlock</HI> and the <HI>Jubilee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the truth of this matter see the statement of my profits for dramatic pieces.</NOTE> as to be perfectly independent; whereas I stroll about the country; that I am a stout, jolly young man, in my own hair, whereas Mr. DIBDIN is a tall, thin man, and wears a wig<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more curious than popular prejudices. I know a clergyman who, having enjoyed for several years the world's good opinion, was turned off, through a ridiculous pique, by a young no∣bleman to whom he was preceptor. After his disgrace every vice and folly that could taint a man's character was attributed to him. He drank, wenched, and was so complete a gambler, that, had he kept his old situation much longer, he would have ruined the principles of his pupil. I know him well—and am convinced he is free from all these vices, and in particular as to play.—I declare I once saw him, in a single game at whist, <HI>revoke five times.</HI></NOTE>. On this subject I have a large stock of Anecdotes, which you will get in their place.</P>
<P>This TOUR also will, as far as opportunity has permitted me, give the public some useful hints relative to inns, manufactories, natural and artificial curiosities, the state of the country as to cultivation, and such other particulars as have cursorily struck me—and, really, Mr. PATERSON ought to subscribe
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
handsomely—for I shall be able to improve his road book, which, in some in∣stances, is very erroneous. Having also had many opportunities of conversing with men of genius, I shall communicate my remarks on those conversations; in which, in particular, will be comprised my sentiments on MUSIC in all its points of view; for, to tell you a secret, while I merely considered myself as a public man, I held up disdain as a shield to ward off the shafts of envy, and conceived myself under no obligation to blunt that malignity which neither gave me pain, nor injured me in the opinions of the candid and liberal. Hav∣ing, however, made my election to cramp myself no more in the trammels of public drudgery, I mean, without favour or affection, honestly to point out, that music neither is, nor ought to be, what it is represented; that a know∣ledge of it, sufficiently competent for all common purposes, is to be easily at∣tained; and, in short, to shew the world how to beware of counterfeits, for such are abroad—and, as I pledge myself to do this fully and fairly, I have no fear of succeeding to the discomfiture of all such as have maintained that I am no musician, that I do not know the nature of harmony, a single method in modulation, or a rule in composition. Another object which peculiarly de∣mands my attention is the THEATRE. Nor will a fair exposition of its arcana come by any means improperly through the medium of this publication. An ac∣count of the motives which induce me to quit my native country are a part of my compact with the public, and they cannot be enumerated without relating many theatrical transactions—besides, a recent correspondence with Mr. HARRIS ac∣tually comes within the meaning of the TOUR, and as I consider myself under an examination—and, what ought to be serious indeed, a self-examination—would it not be unpardonable to conceal any part of the truth? which, for my comfort, will infallibly be credited; because, ceasing to be a public man, I cannot be supposed to have any interest in what I do.</P>
<P>These matters, together with a prodigious number of observations, both of my own and others, on all general subjects—anecdotes, and the essence of what I have delivered, at different places, under the title of READINGS and
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
MUSIC, will make up a series of letters which, as they are to contain the re∣marks of a man long in the habit of administering to the pleasure of the public, will, I trust, with the advantage of your sentiments on each separate letter, be found to excite and satisfy public curiosity. Thus, you see, like Othello, I could take a hint—no sooner had you signified a wish that I should address these letters to you, than I plumed myself upon that opportunity of introducing them eligibly to the world, and I hope you will sustain no disgrace in this liberty taken by,</P>

<P>I cannot have a stronger stimulative to proceed than your kindness. The praise you are pleased to afford my introductory letter—which cannot, from its nature, be so entertaining as those of which it is the harbinger—gives me very flattering hopes that this testimony of public grati∣tude will hold some rank in the world's estimation.

<HEAD>To T. S. Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A measure, without a motive, is a superstructure without a foundation. There has been as much speculation on my becoming an itinerant, as might, in France, have procured me the honour of a <HI>lettre de cachet.</HI> Vainly I say, at the bottom of my bills, that, having received a long and liberal patronage from the public, I come to thank that body for having amply requited my services. Say the cavillers, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'your argument makes against you. Had you drawn so much money as you report, the present measure would not have been worth your while; and if you are such a favourite, why not continue in a service that has procured you such reputation?'</Q> Some few I have set right in these particulars—the rest are referred to this very letter, which shall <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a round, unvarnished tale unfold."—</Q></P>
<P>First then—I certainly have received more public applause than any En∣glish composer, except ARNE; nor was it least when I could boast of that glo∣rious competitor's friendship. Can any other than myself count upwards of ninety songs of his own composition, that have been encored? and yet I never in my life wrote a single puff on my own account—but, on the contrary, constantly reprobated that contemptible support of imbecility, and rotten prop
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
of debilitated reputation. Out of nearly sixty pieces which I have written and composed, and which, before I have done, I will enumerate, no one has been actually damned—three only have been withdrawn—<HI>The Shepherdess of the Alps,</HI> which was miserably performed—<HI>The Chelsea Pensioner,</HI> which was actually so successful as to have four songs encored on the last night it was represented—and <HI>Amphytrion,</HI> which I was compelled to write on a plan I never approved. Many of the remainder have been performed more than thirty nights, some more than sixty, in the first season—not to mention those which constantly keep the stage, and are favourites all over the kingdom; and yet, among these I have not included the <HI>Padlock,</HI> the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> nor any of those pieces which, though composed by me, are not of my writing. A reception like this is evi∣dently a liberal one, and must have brought an immense sum of money—but to whom? To the managers of the theatre—who have constantly the oyster, while the poet and composer divide the shells. Thus, uniting both those cha∣racters in myself, I have been encumbered with two shells instead of one—for fame, after all, like a theatrical banquet, though very <HI>fine,</HI> is not EATABLE. These reasons, which, I trust, bear no marks of vanity, since they are plain facts, and I offer them only in my vindication, will shew that, though I have been handsomely paid, yet it has been in a coin advantageous to no other being than a camelion; and, as I am no air eater, but, on the contrary, love, as well as any body, the good things of this world, my intention is certainly to go where I am informed they are to be found.</P>
<P>Thus, you see, I have made the matter fairly demonstrable, without the smallest depreciation of the public liberality. <HI>They</HI> gave the money, and <HI>I</HI> the pleasure; and, therefore, I have not the least doubt but they had rather I had received the profit.</P>
<P>Nevertheless—I should have made the best of these bad bargains, and jogged on in the old way, had it not been evident that my unfortunate con∣nection with the Circus barred the doors of the theatre—or rather, left them
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
a little open, that they might squeeze me the harder. I have had no piece since <HI>Amphytrion</HI> but <HI>Liberty Hall,</HI> which, after having <HI>nine</HI> songs encored the FIRST night (six of which were repeated, and the other three excused, out of compassion to the performers) was <HI>hissed by a party</HI> on the <HI>tenth,</HI> and immediately withdrawn. This cannot possibly be attributable to Mr. LINLEY—for, though, eleven years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circumstance deserves to be told. I had certainly no expectation at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> after GARRICK retired from it. Poor BRERETON, however, to whom Mr. SHERIDAN was under obligations wishing me to remain at the theatre, made his friend promise that I should return to my old situation. As Mr. BRERETON is dead, I should not venture to assert this as a positive fact, had not Mr. SHERIDAN con∣fessed he had made such a promise; not, however, without saying he was sorry for it; as he was sure my being at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> would cause a heart-burning between Mr. LINLEY and me. He had, neverthe∣less, he said, done something that would answer the purpose as well—having prevailed with Mr. HARRIS to engage me as composer to <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> At his desire I called on Mr. HARRIS, who assured me, and I sincerely believe him, that he had never <HI>any conversation</HI> WHATEVER on the subject. His words were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"surely Mr. SHERIDAN's mad."</Q> No engagement of course took place, and I went to France.—While I am on this subject, I shall mention, that there are moments when mean men are ashamed of their own littleness. At my return from France I made a verbal engagement with Mr. HARRIS, to the exclusion of all others, as composer to the house. Let it be remembered I do not say this to accuse him of inconsistency—it was certainly his intention not to have a composer, till the business of <HI>Poor Vulcan</HI> induced him to alter his mind. It was at this time the theatrical coalition had taken place, and Mr. HARRIS and his colleague were never asunder. One morning I came to a rehearsal rather before the time, and found these gentlemen talking on the stage. Mr. HARRIS, to whom I had that morning sent the hunting song beginning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"give round the word dismount dismount,"</Q> came to me very eagerly, to thank me for my expedition in getting it ready. Mr. SHERIDAN, who could not avoid seeing me, seemed not to know me. We talked a good while, on different subjects, during which time, to do his modesty justice, with all his consummate eloquence, he knew not what to say. At length, finding he must speak to me, he called Mr. HARRIS aside, and asked him who I was—and, being informed, he came up to me to make an apology for, as he said, not knowing me. I might be altered, but so was he—for, when I before saw him, he was as remarkably spruce, as, at the time I mention, he was remarkably slovenly. Said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. DIBDIN, I beg your pardon a thousand times—I had not the smallest recollec∣tion of you. I don't know how it is—but—you are strangely altered. You had no powder in your hair when I last saw you."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Faith then,'</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">''twould have been no wonder if I had not known you, for when last I saw you—<HI>you had.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'But,'</Q> said I to Mr. HARRIS, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">''tis not wonderful Mr. SHE∣RIDAN should not chuse to know me—for the last time I saw him was when he sent me on that fool's errand <HI>to you.</HI>'</Q></NOTE>, Mr. SHERIDAN excused himself from keeping
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
a promise he had made of giving me the situation of composer to the house, which I had seven years held under Mr. GARRICK, by telling me that a connection with <HI>Drury-lane</HI> would certainly cause a heart-burning—though in the affair of <HI>Liberty Hall</HI> Mr. LINLEY protracted the benefit till it was no benefit at all—though Mr. LINLEY positively accused a friend of mine as the author of the above supererogate damnation, which friend has given me many strong and unequivocal proofs that he is no dealer in words only—though I had the honour of kicking my heels in Mr. LINLEY's hall about thirty times in one season, concerning a farce which was cursorily read, liked, re∣vised, and at length returned through the medium of the under prompter—which farce, by way of parenthesis, I afterwards sent to Mr. HARRIS, who returned it, writing me word I had better get it performed at <HI>Drury-lane</HI>—though, notwithstanding all this, I since sent two pieces to Mr. LINLEY which were returned <HI>unread</HI>—and, lastly, though Mr. LINLEY, to put the matter upon a footing, wrote me a letter, saying they did not want <HI>my talents</HI> at <HI>Drury-lane</HI>—yet, Mr. LINLEY's character as a fair, candid, honest man; free from littleness, and above all <HI>envy</HI>—his diffidence of his own merit, which he has often confessed to me did not at all qualify him for dramatic compositions—in short, his amiable private virtues, his wonderful public abi∣lities, which are so real that they are ten times over repeated almost every day in almost every newspaper. All these abundantly prove that the above-related circumstances, though self-evident, have, somehow or other, like a sham flaw in a good indictment, a sort of apparent defection; and can, by specious and ingenious arguments, which are a great deal better, because more fashion∣able, than plain truth and common sense, be made to quash the charge; and not only shew the accused immaculately innocent, but grossly injured. But to drop all pleasantry—are not these fardels of the mind? and if so—are they not incomparably more galling and ponderous than those of the body? Mine, however, will always be relieved by the reflection that I have a friend like you, and the pleasure I take in assuring you that I am unfeignedly yours,</P>

<HEAD>To T. S. Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS Tristram Shandy was a long while employed on writing his history before he was born, so I shall be some time getting on with my MUSICAL TOUR before I set out. My motive which I talked of in the last letter is like a quantity of vivid quicksilver, which, being touched, separates into a number of smaller globules. These, in order to go on with precision, it must be my task to sweep again into the original mass—or, to speak less circularly—it will be proper to touch on all that train of subordinate events which induced me to muster up the <HI>absolutely</HI> necessary resolution of roving into foreign parts. To do this without a retrogade motion, for I hate every thing ungraceful, I shall not go regularly back, but at once skip to that period when, in consequence of a difference of opinion with Mr. HARRIS, about the mode of altering <HI>Amphytrion</HI>—which, being done his way, was, as I predicted, performed without success—that gentleman and I separated. At that time I applied to a friend of mine to enter into some scheme with me, who prevailed on several other gentlemen to join him in building the Circus. The history of that place—the infamy of its present occupier—the blindness of the Surry magistrates—the ill treatment of the proprietors—and my incorrigible
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
weakness and folly in tamely suffering so many impositions, would make up matter for a much larger work than this I am writing—but, as I will not pay your patience so ill a compliment as to require that you should rake in a jakes, and as also I mean, in my public decease, to die in peace with all men, I shall only say that, having laboured four times more during three years than any other man ever did, I found I had nothing for it but to regain the theatres. This was certainly a forlorn hope, and I struggled with it as long as I could. In particular, I had the pleasure of kicking down about 290l. by building a castle in the air near Pancras, by virtue of an agreement with the famous—I had almost added another syllable—JACOB LEROUX, Esq. architect, brick-maker, and trading-justice in the district of Clerkenwell. This gentleman, with a dastardly speciousness for which a Hyena might envy him, promised me a license in the name of several magistrates <HI>who opposed the motion,</HI> and know∣ing, I suppose, the actual value of the protestations he had made, erected the skeleton of a building, which was blown down by the first high wind after the licence was refused.</P>
<P>Foiled thus in every attempt at independancy, I did my utmost to get reconnected with the theatres, but to no purpose. One manoeuvre, which I practised to accomplish this, deserves notice. I got a friend to present a co∣medy to <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> without naming the author, who had so much interest, that Mr. SHERIDAN himself read about half a dozen pages, and praised them. The rest of the piece was read by Mrs. SHERIDAN, who liked it very much. It was then referred to Mr. TICKEL, who referred it to Mrs. TICKEL, who read and approved it. After this, Mr. TICKEL pronounced that, with a few alterations, it would do; and something was in agitation, though never com∣pleted, concerning an accommodation for 100l. till the piece should make its appearance. My friend is since gone abroad—and seeing I had nothing else for it, I wrote to Mr. TICKEL, setting him right concerning the author of the comedy, and desiring to have it returned. Though I took a great deal of pains to get an answer to the letter, I have never yet received one, and the piece of
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
course remains in their hands. As I shall certainly, throughout the whole of this work, be very tenacious of advancing what I do not positively, and from my own conviction, know to be fact. I shall remark upon the above—that, as I had no communication whatever with Mr. TICKEL concerning this same co∣medy, I could come at what I have related through my friend's account only. I have a pretty strong <HI>presumptive</HI> proof, however, that it is literally true; for, during the transaction, to clench the business, which the readers see it did with a vengeance, a near relation of Mr. TICKEL had a curacy given him of two liv∣ings, not an hundred miles from <HI>Bedford,</HI> by the very gentleman who pre∣sented the comedy. Another friend, in the same manner, sent an afterpiece to Mr. HARRIS, who returned it, saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though it had great theatrical merit, it would not do on the stage."</Q>—Hear this, ye would-be-witlings, and rejoice! theatrical merit is no longer a dramatic requisite! This piece is now in the hands of Mr. COLMAN, who, by agreement, was to have per∣formed it during his late season—but, whether he did not wish to risque the principal character with any body but Mr. PALMER, which is the reason he assigned to me, adding, that the piece was so well written it deserved good actors, for that it was in the style of the <HI>Guardian,</HI> but more delicate—or, whe∣ther he was shocked at the cruel and inhuman murder of <HI>Harvest Home</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the statement of pieces.</NOTE>—or, in short, whatever may be his reasons, it still lies in his hands. I even, to leave nothing untried, made an agreement with Mr. DALY, the Irish ma∣nager, which, after being broken, on his side, three times, yielded me, in three years, about 120l.—whereas, had it been properly kept, I must have received six times that sum.</P>
<P>Finding myself therefore in the state of ADAM, with all the world before me, where to chuse—for I have pretty well proved that the theatrical paradise was shut against me—it struck me that the warm and fostering climate of ASIA might revive a drooping plant that had been neglected in its native soil; but then, as Mr. BAYS says, came in the <HI>Quomodo</HI>—how to procure the ways and means. I had never travelled much in <HI>England,</HI> and I thought it would be no bad thing
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
to pay my personal respects to my old patrons, to thank them for their libera∣lity, and at the same time present them with such an entertainment as should not only insure me their good wishes and interest them for my prosperity, but supply me with the means to accomplish my design.</P>
<P>Determined however to make sure of every thing in my power, I wrote to Mr. HARRIS, telling him my intention, and offering to sale such materials as I conceived might be useful to him. I received a letter encouraging me to fur∣nish him with pieces of any description; and I have actually from that time to this, at my leisure, been hard at work for him.</P>
<P>But I know not how it is—my mind misgives me on this subject. I have since seen Mr. HARRIS at BRISTOL, and heard from him at YORK. However, I shall anticipate nothing—all matters shall come in their proper order—and, if you have the patience I wish you—for patience you must have if you jog on with me through my TOUR—indeed, if I was to follow the examples of some musical travellers, I should exercise no other virtue in you—you will permit me to place the banquet I have invited you to, in what manner I please. In∣terest forbid, having such work for my own imagination, I should not leave the reader as much room as possible for the workings of his. It has been affirmed that the pleasures we fancy, are completer than those we enjoy; and, if this position be founded, who knows but, by constantly keeping curiosity on tiptoe, I shall receive credit for having furnished a good feast, even though half the merit lay in exciting the appetite. There is more art, say the pain∣ters, in concealing than shewing. Would any one read an epigram if the last line were taken away? Not to gratify, would be to to make a TANTALUS of the reader; but still let us remember that <HI>possession,</HI> easily attained, is but another word for SATIETY.</P>
<P>Thus, having, by a regular gradation, with a few shirts and books in a trunk, a well-digested plan in my head, and a letter from Dr. ARNOLD to Dr.
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
HAYES, in my pocket, seated myself in the Oxford stage-coach, my next letter will of course contain what happened to me at that <HI>confusion of tongues.</HI> In the prosecution of which, as well as of all the rest of my adventures, though no more than OTHELLO would I have any thing extenuated, or ought set down in malice; yet like DICK, in <HI>The Miller of Mansfield,</HI> I shall certainly speak <HI>truth,</HI> and if that happens to be SATIRE, I cannot help it—yet never shall I say truer than when I assure you,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was not in the dull month of November, when Englishmen hang and drown themselves, but in the sprightly month of March, when they rouse from their lethargy, when citizens and tom-tits begin to in∣hale the bracing influence of the eastern breeze, and ponies and country-lodg∣ings are smartened up for customers. You who are perfectly, correctly, cri∣tically erudite, will not surely blame me for being particular as to dates. Some readers remember nothing but the chronological parts, and it does not signify three-pence by what means this Queen happened to be ravished, or that Em∣peror flayed alive, so that they can give a faithful account of the time such an event took place. Mr. SHERIDAN marks the time in the commencement of his <HI>Duenna</HI> by making the clock strike four, though he ridicules that very cir∣cumstance—forgetting of course that he had used it—in <HI>The Critic.</HI></P>
<P>On the seventeenth of March, 1787, I left <HI>the regions of smoke</HI> for the <HI>regions of accomplishment.</HI> Nothing passed on the road worthy your notice. The con∣versation of the passengers in the stage-coach was in the usual stile. Almost every object brought with it some remark. We admired, as usual, the entrance of <HI>Sion-House,</HI> the convenient situation for star-gazing of Mr. HERSCHEL—we
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
sighed, as usual, to think on human depravity, on contemplating the gibbets upon Hounslow-Heath; and we lamented their fate who were poisoned at Salt-Hill. The very dinner was as usual—some soup which might have been mis∣taken for a dose of salts relished with leeks, and a boiled leg of mutton scarcely warmed through. At length the majestic view of lofty steeples, towers, and turrets demanded our admiration—and we presently arrived at Oxford.</P>
<P>The next morning I called on Dr. HAYES. If you have never seen this gentleman, I must tell you that he is the very kind of man that of all others interests you strongly in his favour the moment you speak to him. I believe no human creature ever possessed a better or a more blameless heart, and never was a countenance more the index of a mind; for whatever fancy can picture of benevolence, mildness, and benignity, is written there, in characters so le∣gible that they cannot be mistaken. If he should see this portrait of himself, and from his diffidence wish I had blotted it out, let him forgive me in the re∣flection that I am only ambitious to do him that justice which he has so much pleasure in rendering to all mankind. Nay—you shall yourself confess I am not a flattering painter. Can you tell me, my dear Sir, a character so near perfection as he who, a professor himself, knows not <HI>professional envy?</HI> This man then is Dr. HAYES—and he is so very different from JOSEPH SURFACE, that all the world speaks <HI>well of him,</HI> and yet all the world speaks TRUTH.</P>
<P>After we had talked over my business, in the course of which conversa∣tion I told him that I had a very strong wish to start my entertainment at the University, to give it a proper sanction, he referred me to THE VICE CHANCEL∣LOR, and gave me an introductory letter. I asked him if Dr. CHAPMAN was easy of access, and he told me I should find him the most chearful, amiable man I had ever conversed with. This report was so true that I must try my hand at another description.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"/>THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD is a tall, well-made man, with all the easy grace and native simplicity of a plain country gentleman—and yet a de∣meanour that might shame a courtier. His eye is so piercing that it seems to penetrate your very intentions—and yet so mild that it is easy to discern his only solicitation is to know your wants, and supply them. His conversation is as simple—yet as elegant as SWIFT's <HI>Drapier's Letters.</HI> His discernment re∣markably acute; and his discrimination precision itself. This gentleman, if he should so far honour me as to read this book, may wonder how I can venture to affirm so much from the little opportunity I had of conversing with him; but I will be ingenuous enough to declare that I went to him pre-determined to make my observations—and those observations went not more to any other part of his conduct, than his invincible integrity—of which as well as the rest you shall judge.</P>
<P>I must premise however, I would not declare what passed between us, could I for a moment suppose it would create the most distant chance of belief in the breast of any young gentlemen of the University, that Dr. CHAPMAN is not as anxious to give them pleasure as they to receive it. He certainly debarred them at that time of what they afterwards did me the kindness to consider as a very high gratification. I told him the nature of my entertainment, and his words were these: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am very sorry I must refuse you my consent. Your professi∣onal abilities deserve a different answer; and I dare say you would perform nothing that could discredit either yourself or the University—but I am, at this moment, particularly circumstanced. There have been lately many riots; and though I am very desirous of pleasing the students, they some∣times put it out of my power. Here was a Mr. COLLINS, and I could not with propriety let him perform. He went away—and the young gentlemen took the matter so much in dudgeon that they encouraged some Italians to sing here, without my permission. I was in consequence under the painful
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
necessity of sending them to prison;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The riotous conduct of the students upon this occasion went so far that one of them struck the mayor, and it was expected at the time I was there that a sentence of expulsion would pass against him at the end of the term.</NOTE> and it is more than probable, were I now to tell you—which I wish I could—Mr. DIBDIN you may perform your entertainment—they might think I set you up against their favourite Italians, and it might turn out a serious quarrel—for, in such a case, your professional reputation would be of no avail—and they would resent in their anger what in a cooler moment they might be convinced they had reason to thank me for."</Q></P>
<P>Nothing could be handsomer than this reasoning. I felt myself so influ∣enced by it that I was more pleased at such a refusal than I should have been by an unconditional permission. This gentleman took a great deal of pains to prove himself right in a matter wherein, had he been so minded, he had no∣thing to exercise but an <HI>ipse dixit.</HI> The discharge of his duty as <HI>vice chancellor</HI> did not satisfy him—he chose to discharge it as <HI>a man.</HI> In fine, as he saw no∣thing that he could disapprove in the nature of my entertainment, he could not bear that I should come to Oxford for nothing; and thinking very probably that his apparent refusal might be of public disadvantage to me, he gave me his word that I should perform my amusement in the following term. Thus I took leave of Dr. CHAPMAN, a character, were it more imitated by the <HI>clergy,</HI> religion would be more revered by the <HI>laity.</HI></P>
<P>To prove however that I have no further interest in what I have said above, than that fair and candid justice I am determined to do every man I mention in this series of letters, I declare I did not put ten guineas in my pocket by my performance at OXFORD, on my return—and I neglected what would have been a considerably greater advantage to me. I can therefore have no other reason for what I here advance, than a regard for truth, unbiassed by any ser∣vile
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
motive; and as that shall honestly actuate me upon all occasions, you will by and by get the portrait of another vice chancellor who had his <HI>motives</HI> for refusing me too—but they were not exactly of the same complexion as Dr. CHAPMAN's. In short, PLUTARCH compared the <HI>paralleled</HI> virtues of his he∣roes—MINE will be all <HI>contrast.</HI> And though I will not suppose but that all characters are honest who wear black, yet it will be readily granted me there are shades of that colour, even from the dismal, dingy first mourning of an heir, to the light, airy French-grey in which he takes possession of his father's titles and estate.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday, March 20, I arrived at that mixture of lowliness and grandeur, pride and meanness, politeness and impertinence—BATH—the region of fashion and dullness—of elegance and vapidity—of public reputation and private intrigue—of extravagance and imposition. Where dress is the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of all virtue—where a graceful minuet is considered as the height of human perfection—where good-breeding is carried to such a pitch of refinement that doves and rooks mix <HI>sans façon,</HI> and the foxes and geese are all of one family—where the buildings, like the visitors, are grand, heavy, and smoke-dried—where Irish gentlemen of high families and low fortunes lay in wait for opportunities to amuse those misses who pass their whole time in con∣triving how they shall most conveniently leave sick mamma to the care of the old nurse—and where convivial lords who have worn out the cellar, the larder, the waiters, and themselves in London, are wheeled down, with about six months to live, to drink the waters, hobble cotillions, pick their teeth, qualify Burgundy with spruce beer, faintly revive expiring nature by the administration of stimulatives, beat false time, scream bravo, <HI>mal apropos,</HI> and hiccup out <HI>non nobis domine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="28"/>Here—for Fortune so willed it—was I to make my <HI>coup d'essai</HI>; and hav∣ing fixed myself in a lodging, I began to prepare for my entertainment, which I advertised for the following Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. On the Monday morning came a loud rap at my parlour door. I called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come in,"</Q> and a genteel, well looking man entered the room with—in what they call the singing or fashionable brogue—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, your most obedient humble servant. I understand you are Mr. DIBDIN, whom all the world knows—the composer of <HI>The Padlock,</HI> and <HI>The Jubilee,</HI> and <HI>Poor Vulcan,</HI> and <HI>The Quaker,</HI> and all those charming pieces that 'tis a long time we have been delighted with. Oh! by my soul I do tink that beautiful song—stay a minute—which is it? Ah fait its no matter—you never made a bad one in your life. Well, Sir, don't let me interrupt you. I take the liberty of calling—for you see I am distract∣edly fond of music, and I find we are going to be charmed with a little enter∣tainment of your fabricating. Sir, I have it in my power to do you a great deal of service; and to be sure I shall conceive it the duty of myself and every other friend I have, to be as stirring as possible in this business. I know al∣ready of a party of fourteen that I have not spoken to. And den there is—Oh fait there are some very capital families here—don't be uneasy—pray could you favour me with some little, delicate, charming, beautiful touch—only just you know to make their mouths water by telling them what I have heard.'</Q> I was at the <HI>Piano Forte,</HI> and complied with great readiness, and indeed as much as any thing to know the drift of this long harrangue, which I shrewdly suspected implied something more than mere spontaneous good na∣ture. After I had done—he cried—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'ah by my soul—there's no other man alive but yourself wid such taste. Well now I'll tell you something—where do you perform?'</Q> I answered <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"at the newrooms."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well, but sure there won't be room enough for the people, they'll come in such crowds—but that is not what I am going to say—do you know you have it in your power to do me the greatest favour in the world.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sure then Sir I have it in my inclination."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah, now that's what I have always said—true genius and politeness constantly go hand in hand together. Sir, I thank
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
you very kindly. You must know there is a lady in this town of great dis∣tinction—one of the first Irish families—the honourable Mrs. O'N—. She is at the head of fifteen thousand a year, and writes poetry like an angel.—Oh to be sure I have not the sweetest song of her writing—here it is—you shall read it'</Q> He then produced me the first stanza of a song, certainly very prettily written. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Now do you see, I entreat this may be a secret between you and I'</Q>—and so very Irish was this request, that MATHEWS, of BATH, to whom I had been playing the songs of <HI>Harvest Home,</HI> was in the room from first to last.—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what do you tink I have promised—you must know I have a pretty notion of music, and I play tolerably well, for a gentleman, on the violin—I have promised to set this sweet song to music, and for the life of me I don't know how—now you see—you would do it it in three minutes—I can say it's mine—and, as we shall keep the secret, nobody can know any tink about it. What do you tink of this?—you know I shall make some large parties for you—oh, by my soul, you may depend through my means of having a thick audience. Well, Sir, if you will be so very kind as to do me this great favour, I shall have a very singular and particular pleasure—and in return, exclusive of the attention I mean to pay your performance, which, indeed, is but the duty of every man who is a lover and encourager of professional merit—I shall certainly serve you any way within the scope of my interest and ability.'</Q> Not to tire you—I set the song; promising, like the PRINCE OF WALES about the death of HOTSPUR, that if a lie would do him grace, I'd dress it in the finest terms I had. The captain was in raptures—promised me to bring ALL BATH—and then came—<HI>alone.</HI> I met him after∣wards at the catch club, where he made no sort of apology for his breach of promise, but carelessly said that Mrs. O'N— was charmed with the song—that he felt himself very gay in his borrowed plumes—that he was sorry I had such a bad room—that it would do my heart good to hear them sing catches and glees in Ireland, where he should be very happy to have the pleasure of seeing me—and, in short, resorted to such paltry subterfuges, as induced me to pity him for a contemptible ingenuity which, I dare say, he thought merited praise.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30"/>Determined, however, by an honest manoeuvre, to repay his nefarious one—I gave the song to Mr. INCLEDON, who sings it charmingly at Vaux∣hall, and it is now printed with my name to the music in the title page. The negroes, with that shrewdness for which they are remarkable, call a promise <HI>windy.</HI> At a place called DEEP BAY, in ST.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Tuesday, the twenty-second, at noon, I made my public appearance—if performing an entertainment before eight and thirty persons can be called so—for the <HI>first</HI> time during twelve years; and, if I had not a perseverance beyond any other man, it would have been my <HI>last.</HI> Hea∣ven defend me from such a set of insipid, vague, unmeaning, countenances. One of the number I have since performed before at MONMOUTH, and another at WAKEFIELD, both of whom insisted upon it that the performance was much better than at BATH—when the fact was they were only in company more dis∣posed to be happy. All those passages which to your knowledge have kept the audience in a roar, were received with a vacant gravity, an unfeeling stare, a milk and water indifference. Enough, as I say of my poet, to make a man forswear ever taking a pen in his hand—yet; I found afterwards that they were all pleased—it was only their manner of expressing themselves. It was BATH, and therefore it would have been vulgar to laugh or give way to any emotion that indicates pleasure such as the heart participates. This I had occa∣sion
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
more minutely to remark by paying a visit to the catch-club—where even the glass, which never circulated more freely—nor all the toasts that accompa∣nied it—the songs that relieved it, which were pretty well fraught with that reproachful substitute for humour that men who are strangers to real wit find so much pleasure in, could scarcely raise a smile—the broad bottoms of the glasses, as if instinctively, resounded a peal of applause at the end of every song, but till the end of the next, all was silent as death. I note this as an instance of fashionable gravity, beyond credibility—for, that a meeting, professedly convivial should apparently be held without mirth, is a kind of existence without a soul—a mental death—but it may be reconciled by saying that it is a refinement on politeness, reserved alone to grace the luke-warm court of the luke-warm KING BLADUD.</P>
<P>As these remarks on the affected stupidity of the BATH auditors natu∣rally lead to audiences in general, I shall, while I am on the subject, speak a little of the different feelings of different spectators. Some have been in rap∣tures about nothing—others have applauded without discrimination—some have intruded their opinions on every body, and others have not dared to feel till they had asked the opinions of their neighbours. But it is not BATH alone—every separate place I have seen has its peculiar mode of indicating its plea∣sure. You may remember, in a letter written to me some time ago, you wondered at my advertising my entertainment at BIRMINGHAM, when it was notorious that at one of the meetings, where <HI>L'Allegro il ed Pensoroso</HI> was per∣formed, the audience was unmoved at every part of it but the line
<Q>"Drew iron tears down PLUTO's cheeks"</Q></P>
<P>At BRISTOL—which place, to a proverb, is remarkable for hoggishness—they did not consider so much the quality as when they had enough—and so of the rest—the particulars of which local taste will come in their place. I cannot, however, refrain from noticing the delight that <HI>Grog</HI> has given all

Thus, by one happy portrait of strong nature, have I procured the emancipation of a set of brutal slaves—let the expediency of freeing human ones be left to the decision of others.</NOTE> all the sportsmen. The classical men have chuckled at <HI>The Siege of Troy,</HI> and the musical at <HI>Pomposo</HI>—not to mention that every individual member of all the audiences ever assembled to hear me has bridled up, and been charmed beyond measure, at the compli∣ment contained in the last four lines of the entertainment. I shall conclude this letter with an anecdote of GARRICK and old CERVETTO.</P>
<P>When GARRICK returned from ITALY, he prepared an address to the au∣dience, which he delivered previous to the play he first appeared in. When he came upon the stage, he was welcomed with three loud plaudits, each finish∣ing with a huzza. As soon as this unprecedented applause had a little subsided, he used every art of which he was so completely master to lull the tumult into a profound silence—and, just as all was hushed as death, and anxious expec∣tation sat on every face, old CERVETTO, who was better known by the name of NOSEY, anticipated the very first line of the address by—aw—a tremendous yawn. A convulsion of laughter ensued, and it was some minutes before the wished-for silence could be again restored. That, however, obtained—GAR∣RICK delivered his address in that happy, irresistible manner in which he was always sure to captivate his audience; and he retired with applause such as was never better given, nor ever deserved. But the matter did not rest here—The moment he came off the stage, he flew like lightening to the music room, where, collaring astonished NOSEY, he began to abuse him pretty vociferously. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Wha—why—you old scoundrel—you must be the most infernal'</Q>—at length poor CERVETTO—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh! Mr. GARRICK! vat is the matter—vat I haf do—Oh God vat it is!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The matter! why you old, damned, eternal, senseless
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
idiot—with no more brains than your damned bass viol—just at the—a—very moment I had played with the audience—tickled them like a trout, and brought them to the most accommodating silence—so pat to my purpose—so perfect—that it was, as one may say, a companion for MILTON's visible darkness'</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, Mr. GARRICK, it vas no darkness."</Q> Darkness! stupid <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'fool—but how should a man of my reading make himself understood by—a—answer me, was not the whole house, pit, box, and gallery, very still?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, Sir, indeed—still as mouse."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well then, just at that very moment did you not, with your damned jaws extended wide enough to swallow a sixpenny loaf—yaw?—Oh I wish you had never shut your damned jaws again.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sare, Mr. GARRICK—only if you please hear me von vord.

The cunning readiness of this Italian flattery operated exactly contrary to the last line of an epigram—the honey was tasted and the sting forgot—and it not only procured NOSEY's pardon, but forced a declaration from his pa∣tron that he ought to be forgiven for the wit of the offence. Upon this prin∣ciple, perhaps, the yawning of the BATH audience was all rapture—in which case CHURCHILL can only mean that every man has a right to express his feel∣ings his own way—mine is to say literally what I mean; which I do when I assure you that I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had scarcely returned home after my first perfor∣mance at BATH, when two ladies knocked at my parlour door. They were ushered in; and, having thanked me for my entertainment, and professed themselves extremely sorry that I had been so thinly attended, they proceeded to assure me that as apparently I was a stranger to the mode of conducting an amusement at BATH, they, who were leaders of fashionable matters, could not refrain from calling to set me right concerning some particulars, and offer me such advice as might be condusive to my interest. After a good deal of conversation, it was agreed that I should suspend the performance, to give them an opportunity of enquiring when a repetition of it would be most agreeable to the company then in the town. These preliminaries adjusted, they went away; and one of these ladies actually took the trouble of advis∣ing me, by letter, of what she had learnt, and a time was at length appointed which would, according to her advice, procure me a full audience. The morning came, and I had the honour of meeting only <HI>sixteen persons</HI>; but what most astonished me was, that my <HI>two patronesses</HI> did not appear among the number. It immediately struck me that they had played me the <HI>second part</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
of the <HI>same tune</HI> through which I had been so completely <HI>hummed</HI> by the <HI>Irish Jolmon.</HI> But why?—wherefore?—from what motive? They wanted no song set to music; and yet there must be something in the wind, or else why call on me and write letters? Not to tire you about such a stupid business. I at last learnt for a certainty that they were supporters of the <HI>Old Rooms,</HI> and had taken every possible pains to decry the entertainment—to represent me as an impostor—and appoint a time when nobody would attend—not because they had the smallest objection to me, but—because I performed at the <HI>New Rooms.</HI> Thus, at BATH, I fell a sacrifice to a stupid caprice in which I had not the smallest concern.</P>
<P>At length my eyes were opened by Mr. DERHAM, the master of the <HI>New Rooms,</HI> who assured me it would be the height of folly to attempt another per∣formance. I closed with him in opinion, and offered the money I had agreed to pay for the rooms, which he refused with these words—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. DIBDIN, how∣ever you may have been treated by others in BATH, you shall meet with no∣thing illiberal from me. I have no sort of objection to getting money, but I never yet got any <HI>dirty</HI> money—and I am sure I will not begin now. If you think I have done you any kindness, the only return I require is, to hear of your prosperity, which I sincerely wish and should be happy to promote.'</Q> I shall make no comment on this kind conduct of Mr. DERHAM, his domestic and general character is too well known to need my panegyrick; and I am sure, though my regard to justice would not permit me to do so, I should have better pleased him, had I been totally silent on this head.</P>
<P>These matters passed at that notorious moment when the business of Mr. TWYCROSS's E O tables engrossed all the conversation of the place—when the dove-house exulted and the rookery shook to its foundation. That building however I am afraid is erected upon too permanent a footing to be overturned so easily. Those are temporary convulsions, and only serve to discover the damaged parts that <HI>at a proper expence</HI> they may be the more securely stopped.
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
At this time—for things fall out generally pretty <HI>apropos</HI> with me—I received a message from Mr. DALY's agent, who happened to be at BATH to engage a performer.</P>
<P>You may remember, in Letter IV, I mention an engagement I had made with Mr. DALY, and this is a proper place to go into the particulars of it. To do so I must state the substance of a hand-bill I was compelled to publish in the month of February last. It mentioned that I had entered into an article, under a penalty of 200l. with Mr. DALY, for three years, to furnish certain pieces and certain music for the Irish theatre; that Mr. DALY had broken this arti∣cle in three several instances, two of which I had overlooked, and was willing to qualify the third, if Mr. DALY would let the whole matter go to a reference. This—being then in England—he seemed to consent to. A gentleman on each part was appointed; but as it was evident his friend was too closely connected with his interest (being afterwards his agent, and indeed the very gentleman who sent to me at BATH, as above) my appointed referee, seeing all this, wished to have an umpire. The business was however trifled with. Mr. DALY would not sign the bond of arbitration; and in short nothing had been done when my friend was obliged to leave town, and Mr. DALY on the eve of his departure for Ireland. In this situation I was determined to bring him to reason; and for that purpose commenced an action against him—but resolving to treat him with every kind of delicacy, I would not suffer it to be served. This he was informed of by my attorney, to whom he acknowledged that I had treated him so handsomely, and with so much lenity, that he engaged his <HI>word</HI> and HO∣NOUR not to leave England till I should be fully and fairly satisfied. He thought proper however to forfeit his promise, and my friends urged me to publish an account of the matter, as a warning to others.</P>
<P>This business had stood over from February till the above message. I met the gentleman, and after a fruitless attempt to obtain my due, fearing that some trick might be played me—as the article was not at that moment cancelled—I
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
agreed to receive <HI>forty pounds</HI> for TWO HUNDRED, and exchange general releases, so charmed was I to get rid of so scandalous a business; and as it was repre∣sented to me that much inconvenience might accrue to Mr. DALY from the above hand-bill, which still stood out against him uncontradicted, I voluntarily offered to give a declaration under my hand that I was satisfied with the conclu∣sion of the business. These matters premised, the proper writings were put in hand I received <HI>thirty pounds</HI> in CASH, a note at two months of <HI>ten pounds,</HI> and a promise <HI>in writing</HI> that the pieces of mine then in Mr. DALY's possession should be delivered into the hands of a friend <HI>as soon as possible.</HI> Had these pro∣mises been fulfilled I should have conceived myself prohibited by my written declaration from publishing this transaction—but as in TEN months, instead of <HI>two,</HI> the payment is not made, nor the pieces returned, I look upon the au∣thority I gave to say I was satisfied in the light of a defeasance on the back of a warrant of attorney, which is done away if the conditions annexed to it are not literally complied with—the bond therefore, as far as it relates to Mr. DALY's having behaved unhandsome and dishonourable, remains yet in <HI>full force</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> and if any persons after this chuse to engage with Mr. DALY, without a proper security, I think a statute of lunacy might be taken out against them without much impropriety.</P>
<P>I should be wanting to myself and common justice, if I did not say, before I quit the subject of BATH, that with particular pleasure I saw my old friend KEASBURY, with whom, twenty years ago, I have heard <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the chimes at mid∣night."</Q> He was well and happy, and may he long continue so! Nor must I omit that I witnessed a most respectable performance at his theatre. The farce, which was Mr. SHERIDAN's <HI>St. Patrick's Day,</HI> was acted infinitely bet∣ter than ever I saw it in London. Indeed this is one excellent property of a <HI>regular</HI> company in the country, the minuter parts—which a town actor thinks so little of, and which by the bye are remarkably material, witness GARRICK's attention to them—are paid much more respect to; but however this applies more immediately to BATH, where my old friend's veteran judgment and gen∣tlemanly
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
deportment will always insure from the performers a proper respect and attention. But lest it should be thought that I am applying the motto at the head of this letter to any interested purpose, I assure you I only wish it to tell against the ladies and the Irish manager; for I aver with the truest sincerity, that I desire no favour at Mr. KEASBURY's hands, and only wish I may see him alive and hearty many years to come, and that so far from <HI>wheedling</HI> you, I mean nothing but truth when I assure you that I am,</P>

<P>'TIS indispensably incumbent on me to say some∣thing concerning the manners, musical taste, &amp;c. of the inhabitants of all those places in which I have been, or may yet pass through. This however I shall not be even tolerably qualified to do, till I come to where I re∣turned to Cambridge, having before that time made no resolution to publish my TOUR, and therefore of course many matters which I have since treasured were almost forgotten as soon as passed. Indeed I do not conceive it at all my province to point out market-days, fairs, wakes, and statutes, the number of inhabitants, or talk of corporations, charters, grants, and privileges, unless in∣deed it should seem to be necessary for the illustration and establishment of any particular fact which common opinion has grossly misrepresented. Thus, I will not call BRISTOL the second town in England, in point of the number of inhabitants, when I am sure SHEFFIELD contains as many—and I believe MAN∣CHESTER, but certainly LIVERPOOL double the number. I shall however give such cursory hints as I have promised in my first letter. At present I have not quite done with BATH—which, as a city, is like a Frenchman's shirt—the ruffle is very fine, but the body very coarse. Place a man in his sleep in the Crescent, and he might upon waking conceive himself in an amphitheatre,
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
erected by the same workmen who built the Temple of Solomon; but instead of this, place him in one of those blind alleys—for there are no other commu∣nications—which separate the old town from the new, and fancying himself in Field-lane or St. Giles's, he would immediately search for his pocket hand∣kerchief. In short, as I observed before, all is either splendidly dull or dirtily vulgar. As to their musical taste, it is a bad imitation of that in town—they contented themselves with bagpipes till the famous commemoration, and then they must squeak, belch, and snort out oratorios. I asked one of their capital hands how they managed to understand HANDEL, and he answered me, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'they fund un woundy crabbed at first, but after they had altered un a little they did un auver rarely.'</Q> At the only inn I saw at BATH they were extravagantly dear and intolerably impudent. In respect to natural curiosities, the Baths may be reckoned of a very extraordinary kind—but every body knows what they are; for artificial ones, faces and fashions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Just at this time the ladies wore a veil made of one very large piece of gauze, which entirely cover∣ing the head and monstrous head dress, was drawn by a running string, and tied about the waste; thus exhibiting a thin, but prodigious globe on their heads, and no sort of addition on their petticoats—for hoops and trimming were out of fashion—every lady, but especially if she was tall and thin, looked like a stalk of dandelion run to seed, the heads of which, children, under the name of mops, and something else, blow for pastime into the air.</NOTE> exhibit them at every corner. In short, BATH is the fittest place in the world for <HI>art</HI> to banquet on <HI>credulity</HI>—for <HI>extravagance</HI> and <HI>folly</HI> to go unmasked at noon day, for <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>wisdom</HI> to shun—and to speak in the language of the poet, for <HI>rakes</HI> and <HI>idiots</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to talk of <HI>beauty</HI> that they <HI>never saw,</HI> and fancy <HI>raptures</HI> that they <HI>never felt.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In my next letter you will find me at BRISTOL, at which place, and in all places, even in the luxury of an orange grove shaded by the spreading ce∣dar and refreshed by the spice-conveying breeze, I shall not be less than at this moment,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WOULD one think it possible that a distance of only twelve miles should make such a difference in manners, as to present you with two distinct species of human beings? At BATH every thing is <HI>superfi∣cial</HI>—at BRISTOL every thing <HI>substantial.</HI> At BATH every thing <HI>gay</HI>—at BRIS∣TOL every thing <HI>grave.</HI> In BATH they live in <HI>fine houses,</HI> and are <HI>poor</HI>—in BRISTOL in <HI>shabby ones,</HI> and are rich. At <HI>careless</HI> BATH nothing is thought of but the <HI>present moment</HI>—at <HI>provident</HI> BRISTOL no step is taken but with a view to the advantage of <HI>posterity.</HI> In short they are both actuated by an equal, though different species of folly; for, one flies off from the reasonable part of human pursuits, and seeks for pleasures that have no place but in the imagination, like a volatile body which leaves the earth and loses itself in space, while the other is buried in the muck and grossness of sensual enjoyments, till the wearied appetite is sunk in gorged satiety, without capacity to know distinction.</P>
<P>On my arrival at BRISTOL, which was on Monday in the passion week, the first objects that presented themselves, when I alighted from the coach,
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
were three living turtles, lying on their backs. This circumstance soon pro∣duced me an account from the WAITER, that, on the following week, the DUKE OF PORTLAND was expected there, with a large body of the minority; and that ships had been dispatched to fetch good cheer on the joyful occasion. Their only fear, it seems, was, that as his GRACE laboured under an indispo∣sition, and was obliged to eat by prescription, he could not be able to cut any capital figure at the noble exercise of the knife and fork. Mr. Fox, Mr. SHE∣RIDAN, and their facetious colleague Capt. MORRIS, who it was reported was hired on purpose to abuse the ministers in a new song set to an old tune, were however expected to fill up the principal parts in the gormandizing concert, which was to finish with a capital duetto between burgundy and disaffection. But so fallacious are the hopes, and precarious the expectation of turtle-eaters, as well as all other sublunary beings, that these glorious prospects vanished like a dream, for the DUKE OF PORTLAND came almost alone—no one adherent of consequence having accompanied him but LORD STORMONT, whose passion in no way leaning from the line of a perfect gentleman, and a true bred man of fashion, the poor dear BRISTOL MEN felt awkwardly throughout the whole business, and were even, some say, heard to groan when they presented the DUKE—not with his <HI>freedom,</HI> for that cost nothing.—but with the <HI>gold box</HI> and <HI>five pounds a year</HI>—for, though this last was not sterling, yet a promise with a merchant is the same as money—the salary annexed to the high office to which they did his GRACE the honour to call him.</P>
<P><HI>Passion week</HI> being observed in BRISTOL with great exactness, by way of balance in hand, to answer the expected disbursements during the feasts after <HI>Easter,</HI> nothing like amusements could be thought of. In the <HI>Easter week</HI> every moment was appropriated to the DUKE OF PORTLAND, therefore, of course, I could not get my entertainment in edge ways. On the week follow∣ing, when I did perform it, and heaven knows to very little purpose, the constant cry was—that so much <HI>more</HI> money had been expended on the above occasion than was expected, that they were obliged to pull up a little—but if
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
I would stay a fortnight longer, and perform upon more reasonable terms, there could be no doubt but I should find it worth my while. Never having been fond of any thing so rigidly methodical, and fearing it would not answer my purpose—the constant maxim of a BRISTOL MAN being to take care that no∣body shall <HI>get any thing by him</HI>—I gave the matter up, and devoted the re∣mainder of my time to pleasure.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>rest</HI>—for the first time I had ever seen any thing written by Mrs. INCHBALD—I attended at the performance of <HI>Such Things are,</HI> and <HI>The Widow's Vow</HI>—the first of which I should have known belonged to a lady if it had been only for <HI>the wig,</HI> which I will venture to say outdoes every thing in Mrs. BEHN's <HI>Rover.</HI> The parts were many of them incomparably well played. I never saw Mr. LEWIS in <HI>Twineall,</HI> but I should think nothing could surpass BERNARD in that character. Mr. DIAMOND was very correct and able in <HI>Haswell</HI>—and, indeed, where there would otherwise have been any defi∣ciency, perfectness and good discipline gave the whole an air of respectability which I could wish to see imitated on a LONDON Theatre—where, frequently, in a game of romps, the author is kicked and buffetted about in a most un∣merciful manner. In these particulars, my old, valuable friend JEFFERSON—who, hearing I was at BRISTOL, came from BATH on purpose to see me—perfectly agreed with me. What can be the reason JEFFERSON is not engaged in TOWN? This question I did not ask him, but it has twenty times occurred to me. Surely the man whom GARRICK took delight to perform with cannot but be an object to the <HI>Theatre.</HI> He was constantly, as every body knows, the <HI>Colonel Briton</HI> to his <HI>Dox Felix</HI>—the <HI>Claudio</HI> to his <HI>Benedict</HI>—the <HI>Aimwell</HI> to his <HI>Archer</HI>—the <HI>Frederick</HI> to his <HI>Don John</HI>—and I could name many other similar instances—nay, when he left off walking as <HI>Benedick</HI> in the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> he chose JEFFERSON as the only person that could represent him. JEFFERSON is like GARRICK in the face, and he gives you a strong idea of him altogether, only larger. Nor let it be said that GARRICK used him <HI>as a soil.</HI> It is well known at the <HI>Theatre</HI> that GARRICK was particularly careful to have those
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
plays well got up in which he appeared himself. Upon these occasions he had recourse, wherever he could, to JEFFERSON, PARSONS, WESTON, and DODD. Did not then GARRICK's judgment rank JEFFERSON respectably? It is true he shrunk a little from the very first-rate abilities. He would never couple with BARRY in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and very reluctantly indeed with KING in <HI>Comedy</HI>—and, if the common course of the business made it indispensible—for where is there a play in which KING has not successfully performed?—you will always see that the two characters wear so very different a complexion that no auditor can draw a comparative view of their merits. And here I cannot refrain from noticing, that there was no man whom Mr. GARRICK openly caressed and se∣cretly hated so much as Mr. KING.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I'll bring this fact home to Mr. KING's recollection. Mr. GARRICK prepared a prose Dialogue, which was spoken by himself and that gentleman at the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> immediately after the <HI>Ode</HI>—a time when there was not the smallest possibility of receiving attention to any thing. But this was not enough—What part did Mr. KING act? Why, truly, in the place where about twelve hundred people were in enthusiastic admiration of SHAKESPEARE, he was to find out a thousand faults in his writing. Nor was this ungrateful task fairly set about—for, written by Mr. GARRICK, the objections were all pretended—the better to shew his defence of the poet, by way of answer.</NOTE> I know this fact, or I would not assert it; and I believe it may be easily reconciled, when we consider that Mr. KING, added to his uncommon merit as a performer, is an <HI>independent man.</HI> Yet, with all his faults, should the memory of GARRICK be revered. I have an en∣thusiastic reverence for his merit as a performer—and, as JEFFERSON was at least his faithful and approved companion in his theatrical career, let us no more neglect him when we think of GARRICK, than we would <HI>Pylades, Achates,</HI> and <HI>Patrocles,</HI> when we think of <HI>Orestes, Aeneas,</HI> or <HI>Achilles.</HI> Perhaps, how∣ever, as my interest at the <HI>Theatre</HI> is not very strong, I had better have let alone this recommendation of my friend—but it cannot, at any rate, injure him with the world—and as his ideas at least, like mine, are independent, he must content himself—for no man, through the wonderful serenity of his dis∣position, is more easily contented—with being <HI>respected,</HI> instead of <HI>affluent.</HI></P>
<P>My opinion, however, of my theatrical influence was somewhat different at the time I mention—for, on that morning, I met Mr. HARRIS, who was,
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
for the benefit of his health, at the <HI>Hot Wells.</HI> This gentleman so corrobo∣rated the contents of the letter I formerly mentioned, that, during the play, I took measure of BERNARD and BLANCHARD—and they may remember I told them so—for those parts I intended to introduce for them in a <HI>new Opera,</HI> which has been long since finished, but I fear will never be performed.</P>
<P>In this letter you see I have stuck close to my motto—for whether men perform the farce of greatness, zeal, fashion, or gormandizing, in real life, or on the stage, as FOOTE says <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the purpose is the same, and the place im∣material."</Q> As I have not, in the writing of those letter, a single document to consult but my memory, how naturally have the greatest part of my quo∣tations been from SHAKESPEARE! VOLTAIRE, meaning to abuse him, pays that wonderful poet a most elegant compliment. He says <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The English, because they find in SHAKESPEARE many passages fraught so strongly with force and nature that they get them by heart <HI>in spite of themselves,</HI> think him a great writer."</Q> If they wanted a better proof, I am sure it was not in Mr. VOLTAIRE's power to give it them.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To T. S. Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS so many procrastinations threw some time on my hands, I improved it, as much as possible, by cultivating the friendship of a gentleman whose professional abilities and private virtues endear him to all who have the pleasure of his acquaintance. A better proof, I think, of his <HI>private worth</HI> need not be given than that he passes from eight to twelve hours, out of twenty-four, in fagging at teaching, that most miserable of all drudgery, and the remainder cherishing his wife and improving his children. Nor need I hold him up better as a model of <HI>professional excellence</HI> than by remarking that he has genius, judgment, taste, and, what is better, good sense to regu∣late them. His compositions, which are many of them models for harpsichord music, never sink to mediocrity, and often rise to perfection. He has not the folly to substitute abstruseness for nature, but contents himself with <HI>pleasing</HI> instead of <HI>surprising.</HI> As a performer, he shall take any man's stile, and excel him—and I will demonstrate it in a moment. First, there is no passage ever so difficult but he can execute—and what no other player I ever heard could attain—I mean keeping regular time—he has in the highest perfection; for, let the passage be ever so rapid or interwoven, a child, with an ear, may as easily mark the accented parts as of the most familiar tune. I beg, however, I may be understood to mean that my friend is no conjurer, nor performer
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
of impossibilities—for three-fourths of harpsichord music have neither plan nor motive, nor indeed any drift but difficulty—in particular those unmean∣ing, senseless rhapsodies in music that, were they executed by APOLLO, would have no better effect than a Dutch concert. For the sake of simplicity, that beautiful ground-work of all sublimity, I hope I am understood—and yet, is not that hope, like many of mine fruitless? I shall make myself clear, however, by saying there are two positions in music, which common sense says must ever be kept separate and apart. These are the different distinctions of time—one is to count <HI>four,</HI> and the other <HI>three.</HI> Yet, the music-mongers—against common sense—with no other remedy for their imbecility than abstruseness—no other substitute for their sterile and unprofitable imaginations than extrane∣ousness—pretend to make one hand play four and the other three <HI>in</HI> and <HI>at</HI> the SAME TIME. Cannot the most common understanding, without the smallest knowledge of music, see, in one moment, that this is an impossibility? If you should go to BRISTOL, call on Mr. BOYTON—the gentleman to whom I have alluded above—and he will, for my sake, be glad to see you—unless he should be offended—which I entreat he will not—at my endeavouring to do him a piece of justice, which he will think more than he deserves, though I well know my utmost praise is inadequate to his merit. The subject of this letter has given me so much pleasure, that I will not mix it with other matter. I cannot flatter—but 'tis like winning ones own heart to speak the praises of the deserving. 'Tis hard you will not write to me—yet, were you never more to do so, I could not cease to be,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>He has the wide world for his heritage.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>I have ever conceived it the utmost height of extrava∣gant folly to deal with even the slightest appearance of disingenuousness in any appeal to the public. The truth is so easily told—and, besides, it brings with it such a saving of trouble, art, and duplicity—all which are mighty disagreeable things—that—exclusive of the comfortable conviction that a man's argument cannot fairly be controverted—'tis in every other way his interest to keep that honest, manly monitor in view. Thus, to give fairly up the most distant appearance of double dealing, I shall address no more letters to T. S. Esq.—Not that I have altered my sentiments in any respect relative to that gentleman—I know his admirable talents, nice discernment, and correct judgment—I know these letters would have been greatly benefitted by his remarks—I know his erudition is profound, his taste elegant, and his stile beautiful. Nor do I at this moment believe he has altered his opinion in relation to me; and, as one strong proof of if—though I confess I have yet received no answer to my <HI>second</HI> letter, which introduced the <HI>five</HI> successive ones, as will be seen by comparing their dates—he very lately told a particular friend of mine that my <HI>seven</HI> first letters—I use his own words—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are wonderfully well written."</Q> The fact is, I hope to leave England by the beginning of April, and chance having thrown
<PB N="43" REF="50" MS="y"/>
this gentleman and I such a distance from each other, were I to wait for an∣swers respectively to my letters, it would now be morally impossible for this publication to come out till I had lost the INDIA season. I therefore—as I have frequently done, and I never repented it—throw myself upon the candour of the Public; not, however, in the paltry manner in which their indulgence is too frequently solicited on the stage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brings to my mind a whimsical anecdote, which I cannot avoid giving a place. TOMMY HULL, who is well known to have been the <HI>apologist-general</HI> at <HI>Covent Garden Theatre</HI> for about five and twenty years, took it into his head at the time of the dispute between KEPPEL and PALLISER, to distin∣guish himself as a <HI>lad of liberty.</HI> On the night when all LONDON was illuminated on KEPPEL's acquittal, he undertook, not only to light up his tenement in <HI>Martlet-court, Bow-street,</HI> but treat the populace with <HI>small beer.</HI> They had drank all but one barrel, which out of wantonness—because it was rather stale—they left running. The door was now shut, lest some of the <HI>liberty boys</HI> should take a fancy to the <HI>silver spoons.</HI> At this they grew clamourous, and bawled out very outrageously for <HI>more beer.</HI> TOMMY—as was his custom—thinking it high time he should now make his appearance—popped his red night-capped head out of the window, and there was immediately a cry of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"hear him—hear him."</Q> When he thus began:—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ladies and gentlemen, I have the misfortune to tell you—that the spiggot is out of the fauset, and the small beer is run about the cellar—<HI>and we humbly hope for</HI>—YOUR USUAL INDULGENCE.</Q></NOTE>—but, backed with an assurance that, though the front of my army cannot come up, yet I am winged with particular literary friends, and well flanked with casual ones; add to which, I have se∣veral out-posts—well situated—of well-wishers, and an admirable <HI>corps de reserve</HI> of—<HI>the lovers of music</HI>; nor am I yet without hope that I shall derive some assistance from the main body. Thus, when all my forces are mustered together, I flatter myself I shall not fail of a complete victory over my enemies, whom I shall deliver up to the public to be <HI>admonished</HI> and FORGIVEN.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, when he swore an oath, would say—God forgive me—which he called rubbing out as he went. Thus—by way of clearing my ground, or, as the sailors call it, bringing up lee-way—I shall make this letter one entire digression, into which I shall collect all extraneous matter. And, first—being <HI>figuratively</HI> at one place and <HI>literally</HI> at another—it may be asked why I did not set down those transactions I celebrate at the time they hap∣pened. I have already said that at my first setting out I had not the smallest
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
idea of writing any account of my TOUR at all. Again—Circumstances, at the first blush, dressed in the delusive charms of novelty, have a strength and false glow, which, upon a nearer investigation, meliorate into sober truth, and wear off the influence of primary prejudice. Thus, had I spoken of my friend BOYTON in the moment I was witness of his wonderful performance, I might have injured him by exaggeration; and in this I give the strongest possible instance—because language can scarcely produce an hyperbole on the subject. To give a contrary instance—Had I not waited till contempt had died away, and given place to indifference, I could not probably have told my story of the <HI>Irish Jolmon</HI> with that triumphant coolness which will never cease to make a much more uncomfortable wound than the keenest shafts of hasty resentment. I insist upon it CIBBER gave POPE more uneasiness, and the world a better opinion of his good sense—in his easy, well-tempered, facetious letter—than did the other atchieve against CIBBER, or with the public—with all his weight of abilities—in the laboured bitterness of his invidious <HI>Dunciad.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has often occurred to me, as a matter of astonishment, that any one, after reading the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> should doubt POPE's being an envious man. Nothing can be more self-evident than that he wrote more than any man for <HI>same</HI>; and what could divert him from such a pursuit to lose time on a work which must die with the names it stigmatises, but—ENVY. How one digression introduces another. Take the following lines on ENVY. <Q><L>See, ENVY!—from her cheeks the colour fled,</L>
<L>While <HI>aconite</HI> and <HI>nightshade</HI> bind her head—</L>
<L>See, how her shrivel'd shanks with palsy shake!</L>
<L>How her lips quiver!—while a forked snake—</L>
<L>Pointing her tongue, sends poison in each hiss,</L>
<L>To wound the happy in the hour of bliss!</L>
<L>See where she skulks, with torn, dishevell'd hair,</L>
<L>Push'd, urg'd, and goaded on—by <HI>lank</HI> DESPAIR!</L></Q></NOTE> I might have rashly blamed one man for a slight, or an unkindness, that originated in another; and I might have extolled a third for <HI>tinselled</HI> wit, which—from a graceful manner and faithful memory—he had the art to pass for sterling.—FOOTE, when he heard GARRICK repeat his ode at the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> declared—
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
whether the subject had inspired him—whether the genius of SHAKESPEARE had deigned to illuminate his fancy with some rays of its wonderful effect—or, from whatever cause it proceeded he knew not—but that certainly the ode was elegantly and poetically written. The next morning—having read it—he swore he must have been in a dream<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FOOTE had the most contemptible opinion of GARRICK's literary abilities. He once received an anonymous letter which pointed out to him a French play as an excellent subject for his theatre. This circumstance he mentioned to a nobleman who happened that evening to be behind the scenes, adding that he should be particularly happy to know the author, as it was incomparably well written—for among other <HI>traits</HI> there were several quotations that spoke a perfect and elegant knowledge of classical reading. Said HIS LORDSHIP, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I think I can guess at him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Can you, my lord,"</Q> said FOOTE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wish I could."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What do you think of GARKICK?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh no, my lord,"</Q> answered the wit, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sure it is not GARRICK."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Why?'</Q> returned his lordship. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I shall answer,"</Q> says FOOTE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"like SCRUB. <HI>First,</HI> I am sure it is not GARRICK, because there's <HI>Greek</HI> in it. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I am sure it is not GAR∣RICK, because there's <HI>Latin</HI> in it; and <HI>thirdly,</HI> I am sure it is not GARRICK, because there's <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> in it."</Q></NOTE>—for that the whole was the most stupid rhapsody of incongruous nonsense that ever was listened to. If he had taken a month to consider of it and had been unprejudiced, he probably would have decided that it was a meritorious attempt; and, if not executed in a manner wor∣thy the subject—which could not be without the pen of another SHAKESPEARE—the errors of the <HI>poet</HI> ought to have been forgotten, in the inimitable merit of the <HI>speaker,</HI> which was beyond all description admirable, and fairly equal to the wonderful task.</P>
<P>Having cleared away all the froth of the whipped syllabub, to which this letter may be compared, I am now come to the <HI>drop of wine</HI> at the bottom. It was written, howsoever the rovings of fancy may have led me astray, in a great measure—to say this—</P>
<P>Five minutes before I sat down to this table where I am now writing, be∣ing at BEVERLY in Yorkshire, I dispatched to the printer at HULL a manuscript of the <HI>proposal</HI> for publishing my MUSICAL TOUR. It immediately afterward occurred to me, as a thing not impossible, that when the list of subscribers
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
come to be published, if the names of all those I praise should appear in it, some of my kind friends may be so civil as to consider what I have said, as so many purchased encomiums; and as a man practises firing at a mark to put himself <HI>au sait</HI> to a duel—so, by anticipation, do I falsify all such malice. At this pre∣sent writing I do not know who will subscribe, and I cannot speak warmer or cooler of people than I have occasionally done already: besides, I must be a poor hireling indeed to sell panegyricks for twelve shillings a piece. To be more se∣rious, I declare solemnly, that no consideration shall warp my pen to the de∣formity of an invidious lie, nor—which would be equally reprehensible—the prostitution of unmerited praise. Kindness has a most wonderful effect upon me. Perhaps because I have received as little of it as any man. There are many living instances that I can forget injuries, but never obligations; and tho' many parts of this work will sting <HI>home</HI>—and I would have them do so—yet will they wound the keener because it will be plainly seen—I have no <HI>rancour.</HI></P>
<P>I have met with more real kindness during my MUSICAL TOUR, than in all the rest of my life put together—yet think not I mean of a pecuniary nature—I detest all servile considerations. <HI>Rectitude</HI> is a chearful companion, and no∣thing is so ponderous as <HI>obligation.</HI> Though I hope this very book will yield me a good sum of money—yet I should receive it with reluctance, if I did not feel I had EARNED IT. These sentiments will not, I am sure, be censured by the public, who have not in the whole round of their servants, one more ambi∣tious to merit their favour than</P>

<P>YOU who so largely contributed to make BRISTOL agreeable to me, deserve in preference to any other this letter, which I take the liberty of addressing to you—especially as it comes where I am to describe those beautiful situations with which that place abounds, and which would for ever have been unknown to me, but for your kind solicitude. You taught me to admire the extensive and picturesque views from DURDHAM DOWN, CLIFDEN HILL, COOK'S FOLLY,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a strange anecdote related of this place. One COOK dreamt that he was bit by an adder, and it so preyed on his mind that he built this place, which is very lofty, and resided wholly in the upper apartment. One cold day his servant brought in a faggot that concealed an adder, which, upon being disturbed, flew at Mr. COOK, bit him—and he died of the wound. The reader may give what portion of credit he pleases to this tale.</NOTE> and KING'S WESTON. Nor had I more pleasure in the charming variety these sweet places afforded than in your conversation. What a number of circumstances it called home to my recollection, as you pointed out the former theatre to me, where POWELL, HOLLAND,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">What I am now going to relate I know to be fact, and it conveys nearly as strong a pre-sentiment as the above. The last time HOLLAND ever performed he was in unusual spirits. During the evening, he related a number of anecdotes—but it was remarkable he continually alluded to POWELL. He re∣peated the lines written by Mr. COLMAN, and which he had spoken on POWELL's death. At length I heard him repeat these extraordinary words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The first time I ever saw POWELL was at a <HI>spouting-club,</HI> where he and I performed <HI>Posthumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo.</HI> The first time we ever played on the stage toge∣ther was <HI>Posthumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo.</HI> The last time we ever played together—and, added he, with a sigh, it was the last time HE ever played—was <HI>Posthumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo.</HI>"</Q> What makes this matter singular, almost beyond belief, is—that the time he made these observations he was performing <HI>Jachimo,</HI> and he died a few days after.</NOTE> and so
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
many of the old school were such favourites! Poor POWELL! Poor HOL∣LAND! The one a sacrifice to youthful impetuosity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POWELL was a well dispositioned young man; but he was weak, and his professional and perso∣nal vanity got the better of every tie or consideration. He was handsome, lively, and presuming; to which, if we add that he was a manager, it will be seen that it was an easy matter to make <HI>his</HI> terms with many of the actresses, provided he acceded to <HI>their's.</HI> Indeed his amours were not confined to the thea∣tre, kept-mistresses and demireps were continually sending him letters to the stage-door, none of which solicitations he had the courage to resist. The consequence was fatal and inevitable—he died a martyr to his pleasures; for what head could even a robust constitution make against the wasteful conflict of mer∣cury and stimulatives. His acting was strong nature, as luxuriant as a wilderness. It had a thousand beauties and a thousand faults. He felt so forcibly that in any impassioned situation, tears came faster than words, and frequently choaked his utterance. If GARRICK had never gone to Italy, and we can suppose he would have <HI>honestly</HI> instructed him—there was certainly no height of perfection in tragedy, to which such abilities could not have reached; but GARRICK's performance in real life was not the worst part of his acting. POWELL, as an actor, visibly declined from the moment his tutor turned his back on him—so much does nature want assistance on the stage.</NOTE>—the other, a proof that the most rigid prudence is no safeguard against the grim tyrant.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>HOLLAND was extremely different from POWELL as an actor and a man—he kept as respectable a public situation, and his company was more courted. He had not received a liberal education, but his intellects were of that strong, clear, and decided kind, they performed for him the task of a tutor so well, that his de∣cisions, upon all occasions, were founded in sound judgment and experience. He was free, good-natured, cheerful, and generous—nor had he an unkind wish to any human creature. He indulged himself as much as any young man reasonably ought—yet, with his purse and his heart ever open—though sprung from obscurity, which he had too much good sense to conceal—at the age I believe of thirty-three he lest his family six thousand pounds. As to his acting, what he wanted of POWELL's natural requisites, he made up in strong discrimination. One was susceptible—the other critical. Whoever remembers their playing those favourite parts <HI>Posthumous</HI> and <HI>Jachimo</HI> will feel the truth of this observation. POWELL made the strongest first impression. HOLLAND pleased you most upon repetition. POWELL, though he often charmed, sometimes disgusted you. HOLLAND, even where you could not admire him, gave you no pain. In short, POWELL owed to nature—what HOLLAND owed to himself; and if after all we are obliged to admit something of pre-eminence on the side of POWELL, and thus regret his loss as an ac∣tor, we cannot refrain from heaving a deeper sigh when we consider that in HOLLAND we lost an honest man, and a valuable member of society.</P><P>Before I quit this subject, I shall relate an anecdote relative to the funeral of POOR HOLLAND. He was one of FOOTE's greatest favourites, perhaps in some measure because the world said he was the retailer of his wit; but there was no occasion, HOLLAND had wit enough of his own—besides, Aristo∣phanes dealt in the retail way himself. GEORGE GARRICK, being one of HOLLAND's executors, with his usual good nature—for no man possessed more—undertook to manage the funeral in a way suitable to his friend's circumstances, for which purpose he went to CHISWICK, and ordered a decent vault, and such other preparations as he thought necessary—HOLLAND's father was a baker. FOOTE was invited to the funeral, which he certainly attended with unseigned sorrow; for, exclusive of his real concern for the loss of a convivial companion, whenever he had a serious moment, he felt with very strong susceptibility. While the ceremony was performing, G. GARRICK remarked to FOOTE how happy he was, out of respect to his friend, to see every thing so decently conducted.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You see,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what a snug family vault we have made here."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>Family vault,</HI>'</Q> said FOOTE—with the tears trickling down his cheeks—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Damme, if I did not think it had been—<HI>the family oven.</HI>'</Q></P></NOTE> From the

theatre, you led me to that natural wonder, the <HI>Hot Well,</HI> and to that still su∣perior one, <HI>St. Vincent's,</HI> as well as that vast chain of rocks which form a conve∣nient boundary to conduct the river safely to KINGROAD, employ a number of workmen, make up highways, build houses, and supply foppish peasants with glittering sleeve-buttons.</P>
<P>As to the musical taste of BRISTOL, the treatment at inns, and other in∣dispensible matters, I shall mention them when I return; for I will not give you pain by speaking truth of your neighbours. Adieu.</P>

<P>WHEN I had the pleasure of witnessing your per∣formance, I said but the truth when I assured you it would be no trifling satis∣faction to me to promote whatever you should consider as your interest. As to your request of addressing your public letters to me, I embrace with great satisfaction an opportunity of receiving an earlier entertainment from them than the rest of your friends. Nobody can be more zealous in your cause. There is, I confess, one consideration that will make me read them with reluctance—every succeeding letter will be one approach nearer to your departure, which you know I never cordially liked—though I own you have conquered every scruple but one. Answer me. What will the people of INDIA say of you, when they see in your book that you make a visit to them, your <HI>sorlorn hope?</HI> You see I begin the office of a friend by treating you with freedom. My re∣marks, however, will not be very troublesome to you. Your career is brilli∣ant, and it were pity to stop it. Adieu.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I thought the best way of thanking you for your let∣ter, would be to insert—and answer it. It shall be printed however without your name—nor shall I publicly use it at all, though out of kindness you have stipulated for no such arrangement. My reason is, that though <HI>I</HI> may find it necessary to go to loggerheads with witlings and crotchet-mongers, it would be unhandsome to bring you in as my second, or even bottle-holder. Thanking you heartily for your zeal and kindness, and assuring you that I shall take every care to merit your attention to my letters, and by that means insure myself the good opinion of the public, I shall first, answering your only remaining scru∣ple, proceed on my TOUR. The prejudices of general opinion, from which I believe no man is wholly free, incline one naturally to form ideas of a long voyage, a foreign climate, a strange race of people, and new laws and customs, that after fairly and maturely consulting our reason we really find do not exist. These beget a repugnance to leave our native land, which, were it examined, would be found to originate in folly and ignorance. I am sure there is not more danger in a long voyage than a long journey. I have myself been overturned, during this TOUR, in a chaise, and was within a very little of breaking my neck. Lloyd's Evening Post contained, some time ago, an account of a gen∣tleman who having been two voyages to the East-Indies, returned, and in taking
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
a short journey in the mail-coach—was overturned and killed. As to a foreign climate, can it be worse than the month of November in England? For strange people—they are to be met with every where. New laws cannot certainly be better than the <HI>spirit</HI> of those in this country—but the <HI>letter</HI> and the <HI>execution</HI> cannot any where be <HI>worse.</HI></P>
<P>I shall hereafter have occasion to animadvert a little stronger on this sub∣ject. It is very true I leave England, because I think I have not been well treated; but surely this is paying a compliment to the liberality of INDIA. They love pleasure—it is in my power to give it to them. The compact is a fair one; and if they find me capable to take a review of their amusements, regulate them, supply them with novelty, put them upon an eligible and per∣manent footing, and at length leave them in possession of such materials as will induce them to encourage me while I stay, and remember me afterwards—what will it be between us, but a mutual obligation? And yet, though I ar∣gue so coolly, and I hope reasonably, I had till very lately every one of the above vulgar prejudices and absurd notions—for which no man alive can invent a rational excuse. Nay, I had eight years ago gone to INDIA, could I have conquered these scruples, which—though I had in great measure got the better of—returned with irresistable force, upon receiving the news of my brother's death. My election however is now made; yet, believe me, I go not like an exile. I go to give and receive pleasure and advantage—to earn honestly a com∣petency, and return with it to my native country. If there be any difficulties to encounter, I shall hope to surmount them, by the means of unconquerable spirits and a strong constitution; and, if after all—it should so happen that I am beckoned there by the finger of fate, I could not better obey the summons than in believing, with our immortal poet, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that there's an especial providence in the fall of a sparrow."</Q> I am not however foolhardy enough to court the accomplishment of this; nor will I say, with the philosopher, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ungrateful

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM BRISTOL—I sat out with a view to perform a night or two at GLOUCESTER; to which place—I cannot avoid noticing—I had a most beautiful journey. The wonderful rich soil round that city so invigorates vegetation, that the country looked as if the season had been a month older; but, when I arrived, one would have sworn the place was en∣tirely deserted. I could not help fancying that some public occasion had in∣vited all the inhabitants to a distance. No such thing. It arose from nothing more than—as the residents in other places get out, and mix with each other, and thus enjoy the comforts of sociality and good fellowship—those at GLOU∣CESTER stay at home, in their own hugger mugger way—and form no ac∣quaintance but with the cats and crickets, by the fire side. Without exagge∣ration—'tis so remarkable for its dullness, that you may, upon an average, look from one end of the street to the other, twenty times, and not at any one time see twenty people. This gave me but poor hopes of GLOUCESTER. Nor were my expectations more sanguine when, in a conversation with Mr. RAIKES, I found the town was as much in sackcloth as if there had been a general mourning. Four or five unexpected bankruptcies had thrown them into a consternation not to be described; which, added to their natural gloom, made GLOUCESTER, at that time, the most unfit of all places for making an ex∣periment
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
with my entertainment. I therefore got into a chaise, and posted away to CHELTENHAM; but there were yet arrived only a sick lord, an old maid, and a monkey:—so I stayed all night, slept in a damp bed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is infallible if any one should sleep there in the month of April.</NOTE> and went on to WORCESTER. Of this pretty and very sprightly town—I own—I au∣gured well. Nor was I deceived in my expectations. I found the inhabitants, however, very tardy; and, had it not been for a reverend and honourable gen∣tleman—who never fails to countenance public amusements whenever he can with propriety—I should never have had a second night. This owed its rise to a report—which somebody had very good naturedly propagated—that I was an impostor. When one considers it has been affirmed that a man took thirty pounds to be shot for ADMIRAL BYNG—and that FOOTE had his leg cut off on purpose to procure a patent—or—as some have maintained—to give him a graceful hitch in his walk—is it wonderful that a stranger should have some difficulty in proving his own identity? They were, however, reasoned with in the following manner. 'Tis true this man may possibly not be Mr. DIBDIN—in which case, those who attend his performance would be subject to some kind of raillery; but it is also possible he may be the very identical man—and, that admitted, would not his departure in dudgeon bring a stronger ridicule on the place? <Q REND="inline">'Suppose,'</Q> said a few—who really were possessed of something like reason—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the first performance should be watched with a critical eye, and a report spread as to its merit, and the originality of its fabrication—if he be an impostor, it will be then time enough to give way to our resentment: if not, surely he deserves some apology, and future attention—for having paid us the compliment to come among us.'</Q> So said—so done. I was attended by eleven critics, who, I am sure, had made up their minds before they came—for it so happened that they had good sense enough to see there does not exist a man who could have performed what I promised and yet have been an impostor.—I plainly perceived the drift of this <HI>manoeuvre,</HI> and went through my enter∣tainment with a spirit that surprised my audience. When I had finished—an
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
apology was made me, in the name of the city of WORCESTER—and, to be brief, I had afterwards four very decent nights; and, that not satisfying them, they exacted a promise from me to return in the race week.</P>
<P>The report of my being an impostor originated from an unmarried lady, who had seen me, she said, at BIRMINGHAM, and who—as she did not confess herself a member of the tribe of old maids—was not a little nettled, as I after∣wards understood, when I remarked—upon hearing this story—that her love of justice had got the better of her <HI>amour propre</HI>; for, that by mentioning BIRMINGHAM—where I had not been for twenty-five years—she was tacitly obliged to agree to an age rather more ancient than it was her usual custom to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I shall speak of WORCESTER more fully on my return—and, in the mean time, beg the favour of your company to BIRMINGHAM—whither I went in the stage coach, in company with a plain, agreeable man, who I could very soon perceive was intimately concerned in some large manufactory. As I am, upon all occasions, just as willing that the laugh should go against my∣self as another, I here inform you of a matter in which I conceived myself to be wonderfully sagacious. About ten months before the period I speak of—or, as Mr. BAYES has it, long before the beginning of this play—I went, with a party, to dinner at the ISLE OF WIGHT, where a genteel man sent in his compliments, and requested he might dine with the company. Our own being rather a promiscuous meeting, he was readily admitted. He turned out to be a pleasant, chatty companion—seemed to be very ready on every general topic—but the whole of his conversation appeared purposely to allude to his being a man of property. I took it for granted that he was so—and did not testify a little surprise when the landlord told me he was a rider, or what they call in Yorkshire—<HI>a bagman.</HI> I was determined afterwards to take care who I believed to be men of property—and this Journey from WORCESTER to BIRMINGHAM was the first time afterward that my suspicions were awakened.
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
Every time the gentleman was talking of bills of parcels and bails of goods, I could not get rid of the idea of—<HI>bagman</HI>; and, before we arrived, I had actu∣ally set him down for a vain, empty pretender to property—a pattern carrier—a stirrup holder—in short, the very shadow of what he appeared to be. Dur∣ing the interval between our arrival and dinner, he went out—and the waiter asking if I knew who that gentleman was, I answered carelessly—some bagman I fancy. <Q REND="inline">'Bagman!'</Q> cried the waiter, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the gentleman is worth eighty thousand pounds!—a great clothier, near CHELTENHAM.'</Q> This incident may serve to shew how deceitful are appearances! and it should teach us this lesson—to pay every object its proper degree of respect:—for as there is no rank, ever so high, but vice may debase—so there is no station, ever so low, but virtue will exalt. Both these men behaved very properly. One kept a little higher than his real rank, like an able ambassador, to demand respect to his master—while the other, like a king, condescended a little—to shew he had no pride. If it had not been for the officiousness of the landlord at the ISLE OF WIGHT, I should never have known—that the first had only credentials to shew; nor suspected—that the latter was the less a man of property for not assuming airs of consequence. How I came to be thus suspicious, I cannot conceive. My characteristic—and 'tis no feather in my cap—is credulity? and my pocket and peace of mind have often smarted for believing the <HI>ipse dixit</HI> of other men in preference to the evidence of my own senses. The poet says <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"since the world will, why let it be deceived."</Q> Do not you, however, believe that there is the smallest deceit in my assuring you that I am</P>

<Q>"<HI>Vain his attempt who strives to please you all.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUT of three times that I advertised my entertain∣ment at BIRMINGHAM—I performed it only twice. These fuliginous sons of Vulcan were, at my arrival, too busily attending to feats of horsemanship—a species of amusement ever fatal to my interest—to take any notice of me. One thing completely disgusted me. At WORCESTER it was suggested to me that, as my price was three shillings, the tradesmen and others in middling situations could not afford to pay that sum, or mix with the company who could—and, therefore, I made a distinction; and, partitioning the town hall—which is very large—admitted company at three shillings and eighteen-pence. The spirit of the people was roused at this circumstance—and very few indeed were to be found in the back seats, while those in the front were crowded. Upon making the same experiment at BIRMINGHAM, it was exactly the re∣verse—for as the inhabitants of WORCESTER, of middling property, made a point of paying three shillings, so people of very considerable property in BIR∣MINGHAM, skulked in at eighteen-pence. One circumstance, I own, made me look upon BIRMINGHAM as a very likely place for success. It was the first town in which I appeared as an actor; and, as I signified this by a para∣graph in the hand bills, and made—what I there said—a sort of invitation, to witness the maturity of those abilities which they had seen in their infancy,
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
I naturally supposed I should awaken their curiosity—and that they would be pouring in by hundreds. Not a bit. The people of BIRMINGHAM were too much taken up with hobnails and horsemanship to pay me the least atten∣tion. Upon mentioning my surprise to a Frenchman, he exclaimed—<Q REND="inline"><HI>Mon dieu que est ce que voulez vous? Comment agir pour faire un cheval vuider l'avoine q'il n'ai jamais mange</HI>'.</Q> I confessed the justice of the remark, and comforted myself with a letter I had in my pocket from Dr. HAYES, enclosing one from THE VICE CHANCELLOR, which gave me leave to come to OXFORD for three days in the following week.</P>
<P>Thus I left BIRMINGHAM—without being able to sing the glee of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Smiths are good fellows."</Q> Of my journey to OXFORD, I can give you no farther account—having travelled in the night—than, that at the <HI>White Lion</HI> at STRATFORD-UPON-AVON—that very Inn which I saw in such confusion at the JUBILEE—we had the most scandalous supper that ever was set upon a table. But as, on my return to WORCESTER, I shall have something to say further of this house, you will now, if you please, attend me to Dr. HAYES, who received me with his accustomed cordiality and politeness. We settled the mode of commencing the entertainment, and I waited on the VICE CHANCELLOR to thank him for his kindness, and request that I might sub∣mit the copy of my amusement to his inspection. He was pleased to say—he had a particular pleasure in obliging me; and—as he did not suppose I would offer any entertainment to the students unworthy my reputation or their attention—he trusted the matter wholly to me, and thought a perusal of the copy totally unnecessary.</P>
<P>The first night was announced—and with every care and circumspec∣tion I prepared for it. I cut out <HI>Grog,</HI> and introduced—for the first time it was ever sung—<HI>The Siege of Troy.</HI> I took occasion—merely because I felt it—to introduce an oblique compliment to Dr. CHAPMAN; which afterwards, as
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
I understood, was inserted with some handsome remarks in the OXFORD paper.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The compliment was this. I said SOLON was no enemy to pleasure. He only condemned those fictitious representations which concealed the deformity of vice, and gave countenance to lawless enjoy∣ments. He went one night to see one of these performances, which THESPIS conducted. When it was over he asked the comedian if he was not ashamed of himself, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What harm have I done?'</Q> said THESPIS <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">''twas only in jest'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'true'</Q> said SOLON—but approving vice in jest is the surest way to make it admired in earnest.</NOTE> In short, I performed the three nights, for which I had permission—and was granted, at the pressing instance of many members of the university a <HI>fourth</HI>—and I may truly say, as to applause, no man ever experienced hansomer encou∣ragement. The profit, however, was only what I have before mentioned.</P>
<P>During my stay at OXFORD I became more intimate with Dr. HAYES—and, as our conversations on <HI>Music</HI> were very frequent, he could not help tell∣ing me what trouble he had been put to, at different times—though he had never seen me—to defend my reputation against the malignity of the ignorant and the invidious. These conversations finished with my making him a sort of half promise to put a stop to the tongue of envy, by composing the proper exercise and taking the complicate degree of <HI>Bachelor</HI> and <HI>Doctor</HI> of MUSIC. This promise, however, so given, I fancy I shall not keep. I de∣spise envy too much to fear it—and, therefore, cannot condescend to silence it. As to the exercise, it is composed—and—be it known to the musical critics—though it is a task infinitely more complex than any thing I had before done—I never set myself an easier lesson in my life: so much less difficult is it to work by <HI>method</HI> than <HI>fancy.</HI> As, however, the song of hope is a part of it, one half of the kingdom will witness for me that melody and harmony may be blended; and, as I shall, previous to my departure, make a present of the overture to some of the first concerts—particularly those of LIVERPOOL, MANCHESTER, and LEEDS—the most rigid theorist shall be obliged to con∣fess—that the first <HI>sugue</HI> I ever thought it worth my while to make, is one of my best compositions: for it does not wrong my own-established maxim—of never losing sight of melody—yet it extends and expatiates through all the wide
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
field of modulation. If the cavillers take up this, let them consider it merely as a whet—by and by they shall have a full meal.</P>
<P>At OXFORD, I received a letter from a friend, informing me, that my little piece of <HI>Harvest Home</HI> had been performed, and received with very great applause. To corroborate this account, I sent the next day for the <HI>Morning Chronicle,</HI> where I found it spoken of in the highest terms. Mr. WOODFALL, among other things, having predicted it would become a popular favourite, and I sincerely believe his words would have been verified had it been performed every night afterwards in the same state as on the <HI>first.</HI> On the fourth, how∣ever, I saw it myself, and I declare most solemnly—though, as MAJOR STUR∣GEON says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have seen some desperate duty"</Q>—I never witnessed so wanto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a mutilation. I scarcely knew it—and my friend, who was with me, and who gave me the above account, assured me that all the alterations had been made since the first night. I bore my disgrace like a philosopher—and was not at all surprised when, instead of getting a remittance for the profit of my benefit, I received a letter, informing me, that there was a balance against me of <HI>nine pounds!</HI> But to please managers, who are not attached to you, is a more ridiculous attempt than the man with his son and his jack-ass.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I will not leave OXFORD, without noticing the civility which, in addition to that of Dr. HAYES and the VICE CHANCELLOR, I re∣ceived from that fine, hearty, friendly character, Mr. JACKSON, the bookseller; nor must the great attention shewn me by that able artist, Mr. ROBERTS, pass unsung—whose paintings, and in particular his small whole lengths are remark∣able for spirit, expression, good drawing, and exact similitude. No stronger in∣stances of the latter quality in them can be given than the following circum∣stance. When I was at WOLVERHAMPTON, a gentleman came into the room, and being musical, chatted with me some minutes before the performance. I thought I had met with him before—but it turned out that I had seen only his portrait at Mr. ROBERTS's—that distance of time was at least three months; and as I never saw either original or portrait more than once, and that for a very short space of time, the resemblance must have been not only correct, but very striking indeed. This gentleman's name is SPENCE, and he is a student at the University. Mr. ROBERTS does not want my recommendation—if he did, I should strongly advise those who wish to preserve their likenesses, and possess at the same time good paintings, to apply to him.</P>
<P>Before I set out for London, I sent a letter of thanks to the VICE CHANCEL∣LOR,
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
which I sincerely wish I could remember, as it would serve admirably well, by way of contrast, to one that will appear in the next letter, which I kept a copy of—the transaction that occasioned it having fixed in me a firm determination to publish this work.</P>
<P>OXFORD is so well known that it will be necessary for me to say but little about it. Every child knows that it has thirteen parish churches, twenty col∣leges and five halls, which being intermixed with the houses, give it an air of superb magnificence not perhaps to be equalled in the world. As to its <HI>musical taste,</HI> I need not say more in its praise than that Dr. HAYES is their professor of music. The inns are, in term time, filled constantly with riots—which render them very uncomfortable to strangers. Nor can this be restrained. The autho∣rity of the most powerful, or the examples of the best man upon earth—and it will be difficult to find out a better than Dr. CHAPMAN—can avail but little, while fathers, instead of a modest stipend sufficient to answer the purposes of a student, send their sons to the University, one would think, to plunge them into extra∣vagance, and disqualify them for every study—but <HI>profligacy</HI> and <HI>brutality.</HI> And now, in my usual way, must I break off to throw together some of those thoughts which have often struck me on this important subject. The young gentlemen of the University have generally separate tutors. I do not say the following re∣marks apply to every tutor; but do they, generally understood, consider any thing but the pleasures of the pupil? Nay, are they not often commanded to do so? Is not his vanity gratified? Are not his wishes anticipated? Is there an incentive to idleness, a stimulative to dissipation, but it is their study to procure? Are misdemeanors to be investigated?—they wrack invention to find an excuse. Is pleasure the word?—the tutor is the jolliest fellow in the throng. In short, would you teach your son to trample upon reason, violate decorum, destroy every social trace of virtue, and to finish—in his own language—knock down order, give him a tutor that will pass muster among the rest; if he be of any other description, he will be hunted down with undeserved calumny till he shall be obliged either to take refuge in a school, or behind the reading-desk
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
of a country curate. And the mischief is—it is so difficult to make a choice. Sanctity is no more to be trusted than the grief of an actor, which con∣tinues only till the curtain drops, to make room for the farce that is to follow it. Thus fools come in as large shoals from the University, as knaves from church. Your right collegian can give you vices of an hundred years standing a new-cut to bring them into fashion—but, as to books, they are the same to him as drugs to an apothecary—both are prescribed and both taken; but neither the <HI>physic</HI> by the DOCTOR, nor <HI>letters</HI> by the SCHOLAR. A set of unintelligent terms serve the purpose of both, and one administers to the body and the other to the mind, while they trust to chance for the success of the operation.</P>
<P>Of natural curiosities—I believe there are none at OXFORD. Artificial ones manufactured there may be seen in many of the pulpits throughout the king∣dom.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will say I am somewhat too hard—for this should seem to imply that our universities produce nothing but dunces. I allow, which is a great deal, that, once in ten times, they may turn out a man of tolerable abili∣ties—two thirds of the remainder are but at best <HI>Pedants</HI>—fellows who go over a whole library—book by book—as faithfully as a MOTH; but who—after they have both <HI>read</HI> and <HI>retained</HI> every thing—have not sufficient taste to distinguish a single literary beauty. The rest—as I have described above—are either pretty fellows, or jolly dogs—a set of beings comparatively less obnoxious in propor∣tion as they approach to insignificance.</P>
<P>I returned to LONDON on Monday the twenty-first of May, exactly in time—as I mentioned in my last letter—to see <HI>Harvest Home</HI> on the <HI>fourth night</HI>; from which circumstance, I as positively predicted its downfall, as Mr. WOOD∣FALL had done its popularity. That very evening I formed—what I thought amounted to a resolution of drawing my pen no more for the stage; but so much was I mistaken, that three days afterwards I caught myself finishing a seene in
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
I think the best piece I have ever written. But any one would have done the same. The encouragement I had received from Mr. HARRIS no man would have suspected to be trifling; and two or three pieces purchased at a good price would not have been an uncomfortable circumstance upon a long voyage. How fallacious however this dependance was, will be shewn in its proper place.</P>
<P>Little happened during my stay in town worthy notice—except many in∣stances of friendship I received from Mr. PRESTON, in the Strand, and that Dr. HAYES, who came up to the festival, did me the kindness to dine with me on the king's birth-day, and caught me hard at work at my exercise—for my intention was pretty strong then to go for the degree; for I was pleased with my work, and thought it a pity to take so much pains for nothing. Other pursuits, however, have since diverted me from it—so there lies honour—it will not stop the tide, nor restrain the winds—therefore I'll have none on't.—You will as readily believe it as that I am,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the seventh of June I quitted LONDON for CAMBRIDGE. In the coach happened to be a gentleman of some medical con∣sequence in the city, who not only turned out a very agreeable companion, but made some of the best general remarks I ever listened to. These, though I may avail myself of some of them in the course of my work, I shall say no∣thing of here. I cannot refrain, however, from giving his opinion—which I earnestly requested, as that subject came up among a number of others—con∣cerning the execution of DONNELLAN. I could not withhold myself from re∣probating, in pretty strong terms, the pre-judgment in that business—the rigour shewn from the bench—where the prisoner should never want an advocate; and, in particular, the remarkable circumstance—that the charge to the GRAND JURY, <HI>previous to the trial</HI>—contained the <HI>very</HI> words of the sentence of CON∣DEMNATION; all of which, I believe the public have but one opinion of.—This gentleman's sentiments of the matter, as a physician—setting aside all the nonsensical controversies that have happened concerning the quality of <HI>laurel water</HI>—he very sensibly confined to this: That poison of any kind could not effect death so instantaneously—the shortest period between the swallowing of poison and the consequent death, that he had ever heard of in all his practice,
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
was nearly <HI>four hours,</HI> and SIR THEODORE BOUGHTON is said to have died in less time than <HI>one minute.</HI> In short, said he, if that phial contained any thing of DONNELLAN's invention which actually caused that sudden death sworn to by the mother, he discovered what no other ever did. Unless it was one of those secrets which Dr. MEAD is said to have kept from the world, lest, knowing human depravity, he might be the instrument of providing them with a novel opportunity of perpetrating the dictates of a cowardly and diabolical revenge. As to Dr. RETRAY's killing rats and dogs to prove he had been mistaken when he swore SIR THEODORE BOUGHTON was poisoned with arsenic, we laughed at it as it deserved; but when we came to consider that Dr. HUNTER was pinned to a single question, namely, whether the deceased died of poison or not—which no man could have positively answered—we agreed in a sincere wish that the learned interpreter of the law—who acted the part of judge and jury upon this occasion—was in his own mind clearly and fully convinced of the prisoner's guilt; and so with that laudable and upright detestation—with which his lordship is well known to accelerate the extermina∣tion of murderers—he resolved that the victim then in his power should not escape.</P>
<P>I was unfortunate enough to lose this gentleman's company after we had travelled together about six and thirty miles. On my arrival in CAMBRIDGE, where I cannot refrain from noticing, that though the coach from <HI>Gray's Inn Lane</HI> is bound to the <HI>White Hart</HI>—yet the passengers will far every disagreeably, if they are obliged, as I was, to stay all night. As soon as I could, the follow∣ing morning, I got into a lodging, and began to make my preparations in form. I delivered a letter to Dr. RANDALL, who begged to be excused from taking an active part in the business, on account of his age, and the resolution he had made not to concern himself but as little as possible with public matters. I afterwards called on a gentleman of Trinity College, to whom I had a very friendly and pressing letter from a man of fortune in town—but unluckily the gentleman was not then at CAMBRIDGE. My next application was of course
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
to the VICE CHANCELLOR; and as every other channel was—as the reader has seen—dammed up, my only reliance was on the permission I had received from Dr. CHAPMAN, and some other documents which I put in my pocket for his inspection. But as this interview, and the result of it, make too marking a part of my TOUR not to have every possible advantage—I shall give so singular a transaction a letter by itself. I have shewn, in this letter, a judicial cur in office—in my next I shall give you the portrait of a clerical one:—but all these are the foils that set off the brilliancy of true friendship, and the value of ster∣ling worth—for the knowledge of these kind and estimable qualities in you, give me leave to assure you that I am,</P>

<LETTER>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have often wondered that in the common transac∣tions of life men meet with such continual rudeness, when civility is so cheap, and so becoming. If hackney coachmen and waiters made a point of using a little of this good quality, they would find themselves richer, and lead more comfortable lives. But if rudeness be unpardonable in those we rule, for hea∣ven's sake what is it in those who rule us! A man in a high and respectable situation can add nothing to his dignity so truly great as complacency and gentleness of manners. Thus, the VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD, who is an absolute monarch for the time being—like a little Emperor of GER∣MANY—dispenses his decrees with such impartial even-handed justice, and tender regard to his own honour and the susceptibility of individuals, that a man must be self-condemned before he punishes him; and, I will venture to say, that if any consideration could induce a distinction in his conduct or carriage to any different descriptions of men who, on various accounts, have occasion to apply to him, the benevolent affability which so eminently characterises him, would be conspicuously extended to the most unfortunate
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I saw once a noble instance of this triumphant philanthropy in the conduct of the late Sir JOHN FIELDING. A man was examined before him upon a charge of a high-way robbery, instituted by a gentleman of distinction, who swore positively to every circumstance of the robbery, yet could not identify the person. In the course of the business, the right honourable witness seemed extremely of∣fended that Sir JOHN FIELDING should pay the prisoner so much respect, and him, as he thought, so very little—for which discontent he received the following rebuke. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am heartily sorry that you are offended at my softening the rigour of justice with a little humanity. The prisoner is entitled more to my attention than you are—because he is unfortunate. If he should be guilty, the law is severe enough without any exaggeration on my part; but if innocent, how could I excuse myself—by adding insult to misfortune?'</Q></NOTE>. What then can be said of a VICE CHANCELLOR OF CAM∣BRIDGE, who has equal power, and whose haughty and imperious deport∣ment, sullen aspect, and premature determination, seem—contrary to all ac∣knowledged justice—to suppose every man guilty till he is proved innocent? Such a VICE CHANCELLOR must surely be unfit for his situation. He must be uncandid, ungenerous, and unjust; and—what are terrible qualities in that high character—ignorant and incapable of discrimination. Lest it should be thought I had Dr. ELLISON in view when I drew the above portrait, I will entreat the reader to attend minutely to what passed during my interview with that gentleman—and afterwards, in consequence of it—and it will be plainly seen whether he meant any thing more than a faithful discharge of the duties of that office committed to his care.</P>
<P>I had waited on Dr. ELLISON, who was not to be spoken with—I therefore, by way of breaking the ice, entreated Mr. WYNN, who keeps a music shop, to call and leave some of my bills. That done—after four visits to no purpose—I was at length admitted; and my memory—which is pretty faithful—assures me what follows was the conversation that passed between us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, I have the honour to introduce myself to you—my name is DIBDIN—I come to CAMBRIDGE with a view of offering the university a
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
little musical entertainment, which has given very great satisfaction at seve∣ral places—and in particular at OXFORD—where, with the VICE CHAN∣CELLOR's permission, I had the honour of performing with much reputa∣tion.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ha—you had the VICE CHANCELLOR's permission there had you? how do I know that?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I assure you Sir, upon my honour I had; how∣ever, as I am a perfect stranger, you are certainly not to oblige me upon my bare assertion—therefore, please to look at those letters.'</Q> I then produced the letter from Dr. HAYES, written to me at WORCESTER, and that from Dr. CHAPMAN to him, which accompanied it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah—well—this letter gives you leave, to be sure—but it does not say that your entertainment is such a one as ought to be delivered at a university."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is true, Sir, Dr. CHAPMAN never saw the entertainment in question, not even to this moment, but he was kind enough to suppose I would not commit such an outrage on propriety, or so far offend against the etiquette of that university, of which he is such an ornament, as to offer them any thing unworthy the patronage under which I had the honour to appear before them; and, to convince me he was of this opinion, Mrs. CHAPMAN, and several ladies with her, attended the performance; nay, Sir, to shew you beyond con∣tradiction that the amusement had the good opinion of the university in ge∣neral, here is a paragraph in the OXFORD paper, announcing, that at the particular request of many respectable members of the different colleges, the VICE CHANCELLOR extended his permission, in consequence of the satisfaction I had given.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh, the paragraph in the paper is nothing at all:—a man put a paragraph in the CAMBRIDGE paper, the other day, against me—and it was all a lie."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, Mr. JACKSON, who prints the OXFORD paper, is a man of <HI>probity</HI> and <HI>fortune</HI>—he idolizes the VICE CHAN∣CELLOR—and could not be induced, for any consideration, to use his name to grace a falsity.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon my word, you speak very well—one may easily see, by your conversation, you have merit."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am obliged to you for your good opinion, Sir.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, you see, the morals of the young
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
men are all in my care, and as Dr. CHAPMAN never saw the entertainment, he may yet be imposed upon. I have seen your bill, and I own it seems to hold out something immoral. Besides, if you are a man of this reputa∣tion, what can induce you to come strolling about the country?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, I am going to INDIA—and, as I wish, before my departure, to say good bye to a generous public, who have afforded me a long and liberal patro∣nage—'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why do you know any body at CAMBRIDGE?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No Sir.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then it is plain the people here do not make up any part of that public to whom you are so much obliged; consequently, they have no right to be thanked.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAMBRIDGE having detained me a week to no purpose, I was persuaded to try HUNTINGDON, which place was said to have a very spirited neighbourhood. LORD SANDWICH not being then at HINCH∣INBROOK, none of the musical tribe would stir a peg without their first fiddle—and having performed <HI>one night</HI> to an audience of about twenty-five, who were not in the habit of following a leader, I flattered myself by the satisfac∣tion those few received, a <HI>second</HI> would be worth trial. But I had not con∣sidered, that on that very evening MADAME MARA performed at CAM∣BRIDGE, or I should not have been so absurd as to expect that any lover of <HI>music,</HI> within twenty miles, would lose the opportunity of hearing her. I was so thinly attended that I would not perform—and the next day set off, with a view of going to NORWICH. I cannot refrain from mentioning a sensible remark of the MAYOR, to whom, as commanding officer, I as usual applied. <Q REND="inline">'Sir,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it is not in my power to give you permission: on the con∣trary, I am expressly ordered by the late proclamation, as MAYOR of this town, to prevent every exhibition not authorized by a regular licence.—Now, as according to the present laws there cannot be a licence to tolerate any sort of amusement at HUNTINGDON, nor indeed at any other place more
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
than twenty-one miles out of LONDON; and, as it is certainly unfair that we should be denied rational amusements, I shall, as long as my office con∣tinues, take the liberty to make this distinction. Whenever an entertain∣ment presents itself that, like yours, promises to give pleasure without being immoral, although I give no leave as a magistrate—I will certainly, as a man, recommend it to the attention of my friends. If, therefore, you should think proper to perform, I dare say nobody will inform against you; and if you wish for the Town-hall, the man who takes care of it will, no doubt, let you have it for a mere trifle.'</Q></P>
<P>I am sure you will pardon me for noticing this gentlemanlike conduct. I shall, in the course of this work, go into a full description of the laws re∣lative to public amusements—to which I am very competent, having had as much public and private legal advice as any man.</P>
<P>HUNTINGDON—which gave birth to OLIVER CROMWELL—is a pretty town. It lies, however, on a flat, and the prospect near it is remarkable for nothing but a number of handsome spires. The road to CAMBRIDGE is very fine. The hair-dresser gave me a long account of the number of parishes it formerly had—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'but alas Sir,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'they are now dwindled—and we have only four <HI>church yards,</HI> three <HI>spires,</HI> two <HI>churches,</HI> and one PARSON.'</Q></P>
<P>When I came to NEWMARKET, in my way to NORWICH, upon hear∣ing the races were to be the following week at IPSWICH, I changed my design, and went to that place. I found it in glorious confusion, and trying to get a lodging, I discovered a <HI>manaeuvre,</HI> the mention of which may serve as a cau∣tion to those who mean to visit any place in the <HI>race-week.</HI> The landlord of one of the principal inns had advertised his beds at a guinea a-piece; and fear∣ing, on account of the exorbitant demand, that visitors should be induced to take lodgings, he procured, with great cunning and industry, a promise from the other inhabitants that they would ask the same price. What was the con∣sequence?
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
IPSWICH is very large, and the strangers naturally said, If we can get lodgings no cheaper at private houses than at inns, we had better be where our horses can be taken care of. Thus, few private lodgings were let—the inns were full—and the landlords laughed at the credulity of their neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>At IPSWICH I gave my entertainment twice before I went to COLCHES∣TER, and once at my return. The two first times I was as well attended as, considering the number of amusements that poured in from all quarters, I had a right to expect. The fourth night, however, was to make me large amends; but, like my dependences in general, turned out a rotten one.—An unfortunate and truly ridiculous circumstance happened to give a fort of tacit umbrage to many of the company there. It was this. I was invited to sup with about eight of the leading gentlemen; and as they had a ball that evening, and it was very unlikely that these eight should sup away from the general meeting, where as sort of stewards their presence seemed to be abso∣lutely necessary, I suspected some artifice in the business. Now it is a rule with me—as I was once under the unpleasant necessity of hinting to one of my auditors—that when I am stuck up in my temporary orchestra and playing my tricks, I am unconditionally at the devotion of the audience, but before or after my performance—as there was never any thing either imperious or pre∣suming in my deportment, of which I am sure I should have witnesses enow were I to ask it—I cannot consent to consider myself in an ineligible light.—Whether this rule struck these gentlemen and ladies as false consequence, improper pride, or what, I will not determine, but certainly the invitation to supper, meant nothing more than that I should relieve the <HI>pipe</HI> and <HI>taber,</HI> by doing my utmost—to <HI>entertain the company.</HI> And here I cannot, for the life of me, avoid pausing to tell two stories of poor SHUTER.</P>
<P>This child of humour was at a dinner one day, in a promiscuous com∣pany—and, as soon as the cloth was taken away, one of them got up and
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
entreated, as a particular favour, he would begin, to be comical. <Q REND="inline">"God,"</Q> said SHUTER, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I forgot my fool's dress—but, however, I'll go and fetch it, if you'll be my substitute till I return."</Q> The man thought this very comical, and declared he would. SHUTER then took his hat and cane—went away—and did not return at all.</P>
<P>Another time—a set of warm citizens, who had been used to the com∣pany of BENNET—an actor of very mediocre abilities, at <HI>Covent Garden The∣atre</HI>—got SHUTER to a tavern in the city.—No man's intellects were ever stronger, nor did any utter brighter sallies of wit and pleasantry. At every good thing the gaping citizens were in raptures. SHUTER could not con∣ceive the reason of such <HI>very</HI> lavish praises—till, at length, hearing one of them exclaim, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh that's great!—that's charming!—that's so like BENNET!'</Q> He was immediately let into the secret. BENNET was, with them, all that wit and humour could comprize; and they had not the smallest idea of pay∣ing him an ill compliment by comparing him to their favourite. But to return.</P>
<P>Having given a pretty shrewd guess at what was going forward, I went to the Coffee-house—in BOOTS. The gentleman who invited me was evi∣dently disappointed at my appearance—and this confirmed my suspicions.—I told him—as the party was private, and consisted only of gentlemen—I had taken the liberty to come with no ceremony; especially as I should be under the necessity of going to COLCHESTER early in the morning. He hesitated—and we were joined in the Coffee-room by other gentlemen, through whose enquiries, after supper, the murder came out. I immediately wished this gentleman a good night—saying—it was utterly impossible to mix with the company in that trim—and gave a strong hint that I could not consent to be a performer any where but in my own entertainment. The justice of my re∣mark was admitted—and I retired. At my return from COLCHESTER, this gentleman told me it was impossible to blame what I had done, but that it
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
threw an universal gloom over the company—every expectation was balked, and they never passed so unpleasant an evening.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was not the only time. The same trick was attempted to be played me at WORCESTER. At ten o'clock at night, a gentleman—in white gloves, and without a hat—catched me busily writing—with a long beard—and would fain have me—because a lady, whom he afterwards married, took such a whim in her head—go with him to the assembly-room, to eat supper, and sing catches and glees.—I was obliged to tell him, in a few short words, that I could not think of any such thing; and if I had not been convinced—as it afterwards turned out—that every body disapproved of his conduct—but what will not a hot pursuit after a large fortune make a man do?—I would have left WORCESTER the next morning—but I had the pleasure to find what I had done extremely approved of; and though I had no more of that gentleman's company, my numbers were not lessened by my refusal to comply with his caprice.</NOTE> Thus was I expected, like SHUTER, to be comical, or jump over a stick at the word of command; but I was determined to convince them I had not so much docility. Besides—after all—there might be some BENNET or other whose comic abilities I might not have been able to equal.</P>
<P>How far the gentleman I here allude to had a share in the business, I will not pretend to say. I have given a faithful relation of it—and as, upon several occasions, he was very attentive to me—though there certainly was a blunder somewhere—it would be ungenerous in me to suppose he meant any thing more than my interest. I ought not, <HI>ab origine,</HI> to have been deceived—and a worthy baronet, with whom I conversed on the subject, at BURY—and who was to have been of the party—agreed I had been disingenuously dealt with. However, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as old birds are not caught with chaff,"</Q> I took care—though it affected my interest a little—it should not make me ridicu∣lous. I own I was hurt at it—and in particular because it induced me to leave my kind friends near COLCHESTER so soon.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. <HI>GREAT PAINS FOR LITTLE PROFIT.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>More cry than wool.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO COLCHESTER I posted—and being recom∣mended by the ingenious Mr. MOORE—whose <HI>clock</HI> and other curiosities all the world has seen, and wondered at—to the <HI>White Hart.</HI> I there received a hearty welcome to—as he said—the land of Oysters, Baize, and Eringo, from Mr. REYNOLDS, who is known among his <HI>superiors</HI> by the title of <HI>honest George</HI>—by his <HI>equals</HI> as a kind friend and AGREEABLE COMPANION—and among his <HI>inferiors</HI> as a <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>liberal benefactor.</HI> Indeed, both he and his son, in understanding and demeanour, give you an impression of some∣thing considerably above inn-keepers. He shook his head at the idea of a musical entertainment at COLCHESTER—but, as the assembly-room was in his house, I resolved to try it. My success turned out neither good nor bad, and he and I settled the matter as men should do who mean fairly by each other. One circumstance, however, rendered my jaunt to COLCHESTER very pleasurable. A gentleman, who has every thing within himself that can con∣stitute the enjoyments of a country-life in the truest and most delectable stile, laid himself out, with the unaffected and hearty kindness of old English hospitality, to charm away every moment of my time. Were I to mention every particular of his flattering partiality in terms it deserves, I must invent
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
new ones—as no idea but the kind attention of this gentleman, and the be∣nevolence of his family of love engrossed me—I shall only say of COLCHES∣TER—that the applause was excessive—the profit scarcely any thing.</P>
<P>On my return to IPSWICH, my night was spoiled by the intervention of that little pique which I have so fully mentioned in my last letter. I there∣fore got away to BURY ST. EDMUNDS, at which place, as I passed through in my way to IPSWICH—as the players call it—I <HI>took the town</HI>; that is to say, made my enquiries, and saw how the land lay. Before I sit myself down at BURY, I shall speak of some characters at IPSWICH. Among the foremost, I anxiously seize the first opportunity in my life of noticing two members of the law of liberal and gentlemanlike manners—and, that so extraordinary an event may be fully proclaimed, whether these gentlemen will or not—their names are Mr. KILDERBEE and Mr. SQUIRES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I assure the reader I shall have, in the course of the work, more characters of this description; and they shall be placed among my catalogue of WONDERS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fashionable and friendly Mr. TROTMAN certainly strove to serve me as industriously as ever the BUSY BODY did to serve Sir GEORGE AIRY; and, notwithstanding, it has been said the last storm was of his <HI>brewing,</HI> yet, I really would try my hand at his panegyrick, if my pen was not restrained every time the idea comes across me, by a recollection of the following lines in PRIOR.
<Q><L>"To John I owe great obligation—</L>
<L>"But John unhappily thought fit</L>
<L>"To publish it to all the nation:—</L>
<L>"Sure John and I are more than quit!"</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89"/>Nor must I forget that son of LINNEAS, Dr. COYTE, who had—when he did me the honour to conduct me to his botanic plantation—arrived to such a pitch of perfection in improving upon nature, as to deprive the sun of the power of maturing a <HI>Magnolia</HI> for a whole fortnight, that it might bloom for the gratification of his friends in the race week. The father of this gen∣tleman is said to have been one of the first botanists in Europe.</P>
<P>I shall also speak of another gentleman, who repeatedly expressed a very strong desire to be present at my entertainment, but a foreigner—which too often happens—attracted him with such magnetic force, that in spight of his own wishes, he had not the power to turn from the charm that fascinated him.</P>
<P>But last—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though not least"</Q>—I shall speak of PUNCHARD and JERMYN, whose kindness was fraught with such unaffected attention, that it will not easily be erased from my remembrance. One thing, in particular, marked a strong desire to please, which is one of the best recommendations of a trades∣man; though heaven knows the trifle I paid them was scarcely worth an acknowledgment. The receipt was thus worded. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Received the contents of this bill—with thanks."</Q></P>
<P>I have before expressed my surprise that civility, being so cheap an ac∣commodation, should be so little attended to. It is, indeed, so winning, that it insures attention to the meanest trifles. A good introduction does wonders; and though an insinuating prologue cannot save a bad play, it may soften considerably the rigour of its sate. Is not a fine lady cheated by a shopkeeper with all the willingness in the world, if he compliments her person while he palms on her his damaged goods? Appearance—like the first blow in boxing—is half the battle. What a figure would a judge look if he were to try a cause in a black bob wig and a pair of jack boots. I was once witness to a farmer's abusing a pair of young, spruce, unwigged counsellors
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
for spoiling his ground, in the afternoon, in whose presence he had—on a trial in the morning—trembled from head to foot. But to settle my account with COLCHESTER and IPSWICH.</P>
<P>Both of these places seem to have been formerly of consequence, but are now greatly declined. The manufactory of baize, as well as most of our staple commerce is getting north. A stronger proof of which cannot be given than that LIVERPOOL is insensibly drawing away the trade of BRISTOL, and HULL all the coasting business, except YARMOUTH, from IPSWICH to SALTFLEET:—and thus it will be found inland. Manufactories that begin about the center of the kingdom, push on to the north; till—having taken up their residence in Yorkshire—they expand to the east and west; but par∣ticularly the east, in a most astonishing way. Thus, from LEEDS to LI∣VERPOOL—through BRADFORD, HALIFAX, ROCHDALE, MANCHESTER, WARRINGTON, and PRESTON—the population is wonderful. The work∣men are like so many ants employed about their heaps; but they are so dif∣ferent from those in London, that while the ants of the north labour for the <HI>general benefit,</HI> the other pismires work hard for the GENERAL CONFUSION.</P>
<P>As for the inns—the <HI>White Hart</HI> at COLCHESTER is one of the best in England. It is large, handsome, and convenient, and has admirable ac∣commodations. I was witness to Mr. REYNOLD's sending out—with some company who had been to pay a visit to Mr. RIGBY—two and twenty pair of horses in one morning. I cannot so correctly speak as to the inns of IPSWICH, for when I was there they were all in confusion, and it was first come first served. Provision seemed to be very good, and the soles they get from ALD∣BOROUGH are incomparable.</P>
<P>I acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and thank you for your re∣marks. It is true I have yet said nothing of the country as to cultivation. It must have been owing to a want of diversity in the subject. The face of
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
nature, at the time I am recording, appeared to me like a serene day, fair and full of smiles. The only change was from arable to meadow land, and from meadow to arable; and this you may distinguish with your eyes shut—for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ripe harvest of the new-mown hay gave it a sweet and pleasing odour."</Q></P>
<P>Pray do not fail to give me your sentiments fully, as I assure you nothing can give me more pleasure than the attention you are pleased to pay.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very thankful friend, C. DIBDIN.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING sat myself down in a lodging at BURY, I paid my respects as usual to the <HI>commandant</HI>—who is there called THE AL∣DERMAN—the rest of the magistracy being twelve feoffees. This gentleman made not the smallest objection, except to the use of the Guildhall, which was a part of my request, and this he could not, according to constant usage, grant without the consent obtained in writing of the feoffees. I asked him which among them was the most musical, and he answered Dr. NORFORD; which intelligence was so true, that having waited on that gentleman I found him surrounded with friends who were listening to a morning concert. He came to me into the hall—and, upon hearing my name, insisted on my entering the room, where the IPSWICH gentleman and the foreigner mentioned in my last letter made a part of the company. Some instrumental things were per∣formed, and I was at length requested to play a lesson on the <HI>piano forte.</HI> I felt all the disadvantage of having no <HI>foreign attraction,</HI> and therefore knew that I stood but little chance of being ranked with my present competitors, un∣less I could in some arch way turn the tables. I therefore said I thought a song would be a kind of relief to what had gone before, and played <HI>Pomposo,</HI> which
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
hit exactly as I wished it should. This circumstance—for you know I love il∣lustrations—brings another to my mind which also told very strongly in this way.</P>
<P>I was asked to dine at one of Mr. Fox's annual meetings, were there were about two hundred Westminster electors. Before I gave my consent, I stipulated with my friend that I should not be asked to sing. This indulgence he said he could insure me; but, upon reflection, I placed very little reliance on the promise. I therefore was prepared with my famous <HI>Jew's song,</HI> which will be found in <HI>The Readings</HI>; and it is not in the power of language to de∣scribe how wonderfully well it hit. That sine veteran, MACKLIN, was in raptures, and I sincerely believe it was the sole cause of his burning his wig, which made such a noise the next day in the newspapers. But to return to BURY.</P>
<P>The consent I wanted was easily obtained—and in my life I never expe∣rienced handsomer or politer treatment. One reverend gentleman however was scrupulous—but it is a becoming thing for the clergy to be consciencious—and though the Rev. Dr. WOOLASTON's readiness to forward a rational amuse∣ment, which he did me the honour to attend and highly approve, had certainly nothing reprehensible in it, the other reverend doctor was surely under no obli∣gation to do the same. 'Tis true, if others had imitated this wonderfully saga∣cious, prudent, and wary forecast, BURY would have been deprived of what they were so kind as to think a pleasure. What then! Prevention is a wise thing; and upon the same principle—a little more rigidly exacted to be sure—that it is better to let <HI>twenty</HI> guilty persons escape, than that <HI>one</HI> suffer inno∣cently—so the suppression of fifty harmless amusements is meritorious, rather than run the smallest risk of giving encouragement to vice and immorality.</P>
<P>After the performance was over—which I had advertised but for one night—I was obliged to promise a repetition of it; and as I wished very much to go
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
to NORWICH before the players could get there, I appointed a late day in the following week, and packed off. I have really had the luck of meeting with friendly printers. Mr. STEVENSON, the valuable and worthy partner of Mr. CROUSE, shewed me a thousand civilities. Among the rest, his friendly re∣commendation to YARMOUTH, rubbed off all difficulties in the way of my performing there—yet would it be injustice to Messrs. DOWNES and MARCH, not to say that their attention for the short time I remained at YARMOUTH, was very gentlemanlike and perfectly liberal. But let me first speak of NORWICH. On the first night—though I addressed upwards of an hundred letters to the principal people—I had only five persons. I did not perform, in course; and indeed I was doubtful whether I should give them the trouble, or myself the expence of another night. Having however understood that I was there also considered as an impostor, I inserted a paragraph in the bill which I expected would have its effect; and indeed I was stimulated to this by the very handsome conduct of a gentleman present on the first night, who said every thing he could think of to palliate the matter. I drove him however into a corner, by saying that I was very willing to stand or fall by the merit of the entertain∣ment, and it would give me particular pleasure if they would pitch upon twelve critics, who should be men of real understanding, to report the matter, and let it be decided upon according to their judgment. He answered that it was a fair offer, but that it never could be settled, for there was not any such num∣ber as twelve critics in NORWICH. At the same time he suggested that the success might be better—that the number of nights I had advertised, I ought to consider as a compact with the public. This last argument roused me. I determined to perform every night I had engaged for, at all adventures. I did so; and though no opportunity was neglected, and those who attended were greatly pleased—according to the Irishman—<HI>I gained a loss.</HI> Enough therefore of NORWICH; at which place however—as at almost every other—I found something to counterbalance my disappointments. The attention and civility of my friend STEVENSON, made me large amends for the vapid, un∣meaning languor that pervaded the place itself; not but I have many acknow∣ledgments
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
to pay those who attended the performance—for they one and all agreed that I could not, in painting my TOUR, throw NORWICH too much into the back ground.</P>
<P>At YARMOUTH I had two nights, which—though not <HI>numerous</HI>—were <HI>brilliant.</HI> There is a gentleman at YARMOUTH, to whom the fashionable people look up—and well they may—as the arbiter of their amusements. His attention to me—could I conceive I really merited it—might make me vain of myself indeed. To shew however that nothing can win me on a pecuniary score, be it known, I rather lost than gained at YARMOUTH. But Dr. COO∣PER's anxiety on that account—his solicitude for my accommodation—his handsome, well-bred conduct, gave me so exalted an opinion of him, that I was not at all surprised when Mr. ROUPE (to whom he is a sort of patron without his own knowledge—for he confers to oblige himself) assured me that there is not a human mind fraught with more worth or disinterested benevo∣lence. And here Mr. ROUPE must forgive me, if in order to illustrate his and my position, I speak a little of his own comfortable situation.</P>
<P>This gentleman possessed a competent fortune, subject to alienation at the death of a relation—which relation being dead, he is deprived of it till the de∣cease of another. Upon his loss, by the advice of his friends—and Dr. COO∣PER at the head of them, he made what had been his amusement his profession, and having an admirable musical turn, he is now organist, and has all the prin∣cipal teaching of YARMOUTH. I never had the pleasure of hearing him play, but have heard a great account of his performance. I however chatted with him some hours on music, and he seems to be of my own sentiments. He has a strong fancy, and despises every <HI>rule</HI> that is not reconcileable to REASON.—May he long be happy! which there is little fear of; for through the benig∣nant influence of Dr. COOPER, and his own mild and amiable manners, he feels himself as independent, and is as much respected, as when he basked in the sunshine of fortune, and had no right to consider himself as a professional man.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="96"/>You must understand that I performed at NORWICH and YARMOUTH alternately—which circumstance occasioned the appearance of a paragraph in the BURY paper, saying, that it was a wonderful thing—setting aside all con∣siderations of the merit of the performance—that Mr. DIBDIN should be able <HI>at all</HI> to perform an amusement in which he sung twenty four songs, and de∣livered an adequate quantity of speaking, on <HI>Monday</HI> at NORWICH—<HI>Tuesday</HI> at YARMOUTH—<HI>Wednesday</HI> at NORWICH—<HI>Thursday</HI> at YARMOUTH—<HI>Friday</HI> at NORWICH—and <HI>Saturday</HI> at BURY. This circumstance however would have been attended with more pleasurable consequences to me, if every one of these nights had been equal to the last, which I seriously declare was more than the other five put together.</P>
<P>NORWICH is a large city—but the streets are so narrow and so alike, that a man would sooner learn to be his own pilot in LONDON than in that place. There are so <HI>few spires</HI> in NORWICH, that the view of the town and cathedral from the YARMOUTH road across the river, has a most beautiful and pictu∣resque effect. Not so very striking as that bird's-eye-view of BRISTOL, from <HI>Cliffden Hill,</HI> but neat and well grouped. The streets of YARMOUTH are yet narrower than those of NORWICH, but the spaciousness of the <HI>Quay</HI> makes handsome amends. The first has all the heavy stupidity of a city where the manufactory is on the decline, and the other the sprightliness of increasing trade, varied by an influx of commodities from every part of the world. I never beheld such a wonderful scene as the prodigious fine, large, rich fields of corn exhibited for a stretch of eight miles together, between NORWICH and YARMOUTH—and yet go where you would the farmers grumbled; but it has been well observed, that Englishmen are never rolling in wealth so much as when they complain of the weight of taxes, and the impending ruin of the nation.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT my return from NORWICH to BURY, which was on the last day of the assize week,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saturday, July 28.</NOTE> I found every thing prepared for my performance, at which a very splendid audience attended, and among them one of the learned judges. The applause was prodigious, and never did better humour prevail in an assembly. I felt myself however rather awkward at having announced the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wolf who had been a lawyer."</Q> I intimated this ridi∣culous distress to a gentleman who sat near me, and the subject so got about that no member of the law went unconsulted, and it was resolved <HI>nem. con.</HI> that I should cut at the lawyers. You will find the passage in <HI>The Readings.</HI> My feelings however were too prophetic; for though many of the gentlemen—particularly him I consulted, and the judge—enjoyed the satire, yet were there many chop-fallen on the occasion. I mention this circumstance to sup∣port that constant opinion I have ever broached, that in the practice of the law there are so many temptations to knavery, that every lawyer who does not feel a severity of this kind as a positive reproach to himself, must be hurt at having been bred up to a profession that stigmatizes nine-tenths of his brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98"/>On Sunday I set out for WORCESTER, and on the following Tuesday arrived there. I have mentioned that before I left this place, I made a promise to return to it, and I now put myself to the expence of travelling post one hundred and forty-nine miles to keep my word. Having at BURY purchased Mr. PATERSON's Travelling Dictionary, I shall now begin to point out a few of its errors. He says from BURY to WORCESTER is 138 miles; and his mistake originates from calling it 15 miles from AULCESTER to WORCESTER, whereas it is 23. From AULCESTER to DROITWICH is 14, and from thence to WORCESTER 9. He is wrong a single mile in three other places, which makes the distance in all 149 miles from BURY to WORCESTER.</P>
<P>My going this long journey was the more inconvenient, having received a letter at BURY, telling me that a gentleman at HULL and BEVERLY could accommodate me with a room, and had no doubt of my doing extremely well at those towns—but of these places in their turn. I was surprised to find a much colder reception at WORCESTER than formerly. Except from one or two friends, I never experienced more <HI>milk and water</HI> treatment in my life. I advertised my entertainment however and was tolerably attended. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Very tolerably,</HI>"</Q> as Tester says, and I sincerely believe, had it not been for the interference of a friend, I must have used the word INTOLERABLY. To this gentleman, who is no other than T. S. Esq. I shall beg leave to say, that if he meant his friendship and attention to my interest should finish where it ap∣parently has—God forbid I should load him with more trouble than he is will∣ing to suffer! So far from it—I here, in the face of the world, acquit him of any intentions in relation to me, but those of serving, obliging, and pleasing me; and should it so happen that neither upon paper, nor any other way, we again exchange a single word, my wishes towards him are, may he enjoy a long life of health, happiness, and prosperity! And I hope he retains so much of his former good wishes for me, as to return an equal portion of esteem, with equal sincerity.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99"/>My success at WORCESTER was little worth the pains I took to get at it. Dr. EVANS, the <HI>archdeacon,</HI> who was very partial to the entertainment, said my reception was a reproach to the place; and really as they diverted my course in a most expensive and inconvenient way, it would have been but handsome to have let me known in time that they had changed their mind, or have paid me some attention when I did come. I will not quit this subject without speaking of that friendly and goodnatured creature Mr. SMART, who I sincerely believe was as anxious for my success as myself. Nor must I leave DIGLEY unsung—the heartiness of Mr. PEACH its owner—nor the beauties of that charming place, watered by the Severn, and bounded with a view of <HI>Malvern-hills.</HI> Mr. SHENSTONE would presently have knocked you off half a dozen stanzas on this subject; wherein he would have told you in verse that goes <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"trippingly o'er the tongue,"</Q> that the hills are blue at a distance, more distinct when near—that the river has the property of reflection, and that you may see in it imperfect trees standing on their heads—with many more poetically self-evident images. I once parodied <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My banks are all furnish'd with bees."</Q> The first verse ran thus:
<Q><LG>
<L>My banks are all furnish'd with bees,</L>
<L><HI>Quickset Hedges</HI> my <HI>fences</HI> adorn,</L>
<L>My <HI>woods</HI> are all crowded with <HI>trees,</HI></L>
<L>And my <HI>fields</HI> yellow over with <HI>corn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I seldom have found any <HI>tares,</HI></L>
<L>Of such use are my <HI>harrow</HI> and <HI>plough</HI>—</L>
<L>In my <HI>orchards</HI> grow <HI>apples</HI> and <HI>pears,</HI></L>
<L>In my <HI>dairy</HI> there's <HI>milk from the cow.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>In this manner one might, I should suppose, run on, without any great stretch of difficulty, till all the wonderful variety in the whole round of rural objects were enumerated.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I recollect something like the following, in a French author, though I cannot at this moment tell who. An old fellow is buying an estate, and the seller puffs it off in all the flowery, descriptive extravagance of an auctioneer's advertisement. To which this is the answer. 'Tis in verse, and I have imitated it.
<Q><L>"If for seven years you were to chatter,</L>
<L>"'Tis hills and dales and woods and water;</L>
<L>"All have their whims, and to tell mine t'ye,</L>
<L>"<HI>One</HI> country seen—one has seen <HI>ninety.</HI></L></Q></NOTE> Yet—let me not be profane—SHENSTONE's
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
eclogues and many other of his things have great poetic sweetness—but, hav∣ing an inveterate aversion to insipidity, I never could feel any other sensation than drowsiness at that famous ballad which is said to contain all the beauties of pastoral poetry. But this will always be the way—the generality of man∣kind give an author credit for what, in all probability, he considered in the light of an insignificant trifle—such as the ballad above-mentioned—while his higher-finished and more beautiful works—such as the school mistress—is little known, and less tasted. But there is always this comfort:—men of real taste will separate the gold from the alloy, the applause of one of whom will outweigh a whole crowd of inferior critics.</P>
<P>I must not quit WORCESTER without mentioning a most singular and extraordinary instance of the falsity of that vulgar position—that fortune is inattentive to virtue. There is a gentleman I would name if I did not fear to wound his well known modesty, who made his fortune by the exercise of that one single virtue—<HI>forbearance,</HI> I do not mean that he has not all the rest in as great perfection—but this happened to be put most to the trial. And, to shew that I am determined, whenever I have an opportunity, to celebrate the virtues of professional men with the same willingness as any other de∣scription, this gentleman was originally nothing else than a musician—a mere thrummer of wire, and a scraper of catgut. He taught a young lady who fell in love with him, and even went so far as to propose an elopement. Did he, think you, give way to the tender impulse, and, while his heart beat high, snatch sweet occasion, and become happy! No such thing. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh fie

miss,"</Q> was all he was heard to utter! Having finished this laconic re∣proach, he left the disappointed, lovesick fair one, and sought her father—when—first stipulating that the young lady should not be ill treated—he mi∣nutely acquainted him. To do which, it seems, he was obliged to relate a tale that might be called the history of the Sabines inverted, with his daugh∣ter's shocking violation of her duty. What was the consequence? This amiable young man's unheard-of prudence saved the family; the daughter became prudent, by despising the man she had courted; was married soon after to one of equal birth, and I hope equal impetuosity; the father pru∣dently rewarded the author of his domestic happiness; and that author prudently put the reward in his pocket. After this, our musical Joseph fell in love himself—but, with his usual patience and forbearance, he de∣termined that time alone should prove whether the object of his affection was worthy of it. The lady, however, being a little in the stile of the other—not quite of that passive temper which contents itself with <HI>imaginary</HI> bliss—was first uneasy—afterwards <HI>unhappy</HI>—then ILL—and at length DIED.—Our mirror of prudence, having lost a fortune by her, had nothing for it but to console the mamma. He considered himself as her son—she consi∣dered herself as his mother—and, that nothing might be left undone to con∣firm this ideal consanguinity, she died, and left him all she was worth—which turned out to be no trifle.</P>
<P>Is there a fortune-hunter, who reads this, but will, in future, change his battery—and cease to tear forward children from the arms of indulgent parents; since—by imitating the excellent example before them—the fortune—which is always the object—may be gained without the loss of honour, or—which is a more material consideration—the possession of a wife?</P>
<P>So much for WORCESTER—where you see, after all, I was shabbily treated. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But 'tis a plain proof the world is all alike"</Q>—and, indeed, I know not which was most to blame—they for promising, or I for believing.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM WORCESTER—having been joined by an intimate and valuable friend—I steered my course, on the eleventh of August, for GLOUCESTER, BRISTOL, and MONMOUTH; my plan—while he should remain with me—being, to make the matter a mutual intercourse of business, and call at those places that might be most convenient to both. Nothing in <HI>my</HI> way was to be done at GLOUCESTER—for though the gloom of the bankruptcies before mentioned was worn off, yet the place looked as melan∣choly as ever; we therefore proceeded to BRISTOL, spent three or four happy days with my friend BOYTON, and passed on from thence to MONMOUTH, being the first place where I intended to display my standard.</P>
<P>The current account of places remains unsettled ever since NORWICH. BURY, which is the picture of cheerfulness, consists—together with its vici∣nity—of people who seem determined to be happy. The seats of Mr. SY∣MONDS, Sir CHARLES BUNBURY, Sir CHARLES DAVERS, and many others, most charmingly enliven every morning ride; and its proximity to NEW∣MARKET
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
occasions frequent visits from many people of the first distinction. The corn-market alone gives you a very respectable idea of the place. Of the inns, the <HI>Bell</HI> is a remarkable good one—if civility, good cheer, and a reasonable charge are the right distinctions. If you would meet with the reverse in every respect go to the <HI>Angel.</HI></P>
<P>My journey from BURY to WORCESTER, was performed in so short a time, that it would be a farce to talk of making any material observations. The roads are charming from CAMBRIDGE to WILLINGBOROUGH, and then very indifferent till you get four miles beyond WARWICK, in the way to STRATFORD-UPON-AVON; afterwards they are good all the way to WOR∣CESTER. I promised to speak of the <HI>White Lion</HI> at STRATFORD, and com∣mon justice obliges me to say, that the insolence of the people who keep it exceeds all example. I should pass by the contempt with which they treat travellers in a stage coach—which is hard, by the way, for they must go there or nowhere—and also their wanting to put me into a return chaise, and make me pay full price for it. All this is in the way of business. But when you are in a hurry to have the very worst horses picked out, and be told <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the others are for your betters, and you may have them or none"</Q>—though they do not know you—and, if they did, your betters do not pay a farthing more—is a species of contemptuous impudence that I hope will, by somebody more competent than myself, be taken down. I have a great deal more of this sort of conduct to complain of, and I shall seriously advise the respectable inhabitants of capital towns—for at STRATFORD I know not if it would be worth while—for their own private benefit, for the benefit of those who in visits of business to them, pamper the pride and fatten these insuffer∣able inn-keepers, and for the benefit of the public in general, to imitate the spirit of the DUKE OF NORFOLK, and as completely curb the haughty im∣pertinence of these servants out of livery—which in general they are—as he has—as far as its influence extends—by building the <HI>Tontine,</HI> at SHEFFIELD, and placing in it a man whose solicitude for the convenience of his guests
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
should be quoted as a precedent for every one in his situation. The ground from WORCESTER to BRISTOL I have gone over already. I promised, on my return, to give an account of the musical taste of BRISTOL—but, upon the most diligent enquiry, I do not find they have any at all. The road is all the way delightful, and from TEWKSBURY to GLOUCESTER remarkably so. It wanted nothing but a few scattered Romish chapels to have finished subjects for the pencil of CLAUDE. From BRISTOL we crossed the Severn, in a dung barge, and proceeded to CHEPSTOW—where we were offered our choice either to stay, or have four horses to take us on; and all this because the landlord of the other inn was just become a bankrupt. Let me caution all travellers to make any shift rather than submit to be drawn by four horses. They make no more expedition than two—and, exclusive of the expence in themselves, postillions, ostlers, and turnpikes, you have a great deal of difficulty to shake them off again, and your bill is in proportion to your <HI>oetelage.</HI> These four horses brought us very slowly—for which I was obliged to them—over one of the most uncommonly beautiful hills that can be imagined—the whole country every where abundantly rich with corn—to MONMOUTH; where, for the pre∣sent, I shall bid you adieu—assuring you that I am ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. <HI>A DISSERTATION ON CITIES.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>All is not gold that glitters.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONMOUTH was not worth a printer. To make my intentions known, therefore, was a matter of no small difficulty. A few respectful letters, however, to the principal inhabitants of the town and its vicinity, did the business pretty well, and I was tolerably attended a first night (August 17) and much better a second; and, as a general good humour and inclination to receive pleasure was the predominant sensation, I felt almost as happy as if the advantage had been equal to the applause.</P>
<P>I must not pass by some particular civilities that I received at MON∣MOUTH. The Rev. Dr. DAVIS, who was then the <HI>Mayor,</HI> paid me very great attention; and—what made it more welcome to me—it was very much in the stile of Dr. COOPER, of YARMOUTH. For this kindness I then re∣quested him privately—and do now publicly—to receive my thanks. Nor will I have the ingratitude to forget the anxious heartiness of my good friend OWEN TUDOR, the bookseller, who, though not a <HI>printer,</HI> was so good a <HI>publisher</HI> upon this occasion, that much more intelligence was received thro' his kind assiduity, than I am sure would have been conveyed by means of hand bills. I left him—and may he long continue so—comfortable in himself,
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
beloved by his neighbours, and surrounded by that best of happiness—domes∣tic felicity. In fine, I gave and received great satisfaction at MONMOUTH; but, as it is the lot of human beings to do nothing perfect, I understand there is one gentleman for whose castigation I was supposed to have written the business of inventing quotations. Nay, some went so far as to say, he will never be able to <HI>invent</HI> another <HI>undoubted</HI> fact as long as he lives. If this be the case, how unfortunate am I in having deprived a good story-teller of the greatest embellishment his talents can derive advantage from. Should it be so, I can only say—which I entreat the gentleman, if he read this, to believe—that it was written many months before I had the pleasure of his company at my readings, and always highly approved as a <HI>devilish good thing.</HI></P>
<P>From MONMOUTH—which, though an <HI>ancient</HI> town, is a very <HI>sprightly</HI> one—just as a reasonable old man (MACKLIN for instance) in spight of his years, resolves to be merry—we jogged on to <HI>stupid</HI> HEREFORD. I have made this remark in my TOUR, that the cities in general—as I say of the Dominos—are <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"grave, elegant, genteel, and—<HI>stupid</HI>;"</Q> to which if I was to add poor and proud, the phrase I think would apply pretty well. For if we except BRISTOL, which, being a sea-port, is naturally a busy and industrious place—WORCESTER, which has a manufactory for gloves and porcelain—tho' both are on the decline—it is impossible to conceive any thing so phlegmatic and insensible as are the rest of the cities I have seen. Thus shall I always say <HI>stupid</HI> HEREFORD, <HI>melancholy</HI> LICHFIELD, <HI>pitiful</HI> LINCOLN, and <HI>frothy</HI> YORK. This last place, however, being the LONDON of the <HI>North,</HI> has ex∣actly as much of it as a <HI>shadow</HI> has of a <HI>substance</HI>; and, upon the strength of this, it presumes to be courtly, and make promises, which—like the non∣sense of a Frenchman—are PLEASING, and <HI>mean nothing.</HI> They buoy you up like an air jacket, but the smallest inlet—even a single pin hole—can evapo∣rate the air, and down you go. They will take care to promise nothing
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
but trifles, and even those they take as good care not to keep.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brings to my mind an anecdote of a POOR PLAYER, who had run up an ale-house score to the enormous extent of <HI>two shillings,</HI> for which he had been so often dunned that he kept away from the house. One day meeting the LANDLORD, and being closely importuned to satisfy him, this stroll∣ing ROSCIUS assured him that he might depend, in the course of the week, on being paid in some shape or another—Shape!—said the LANDLORD—well, I think I'll take your word this time, but—harkee!—pray let it be as much in the shape of—<HI>two shillings as you can.</HI></NOTE> I am, how∣ever, not yet at YORK, therefore I may as well keep what I have to say of that place till I get there. I shall nevertheless so far digress as to finish my remarks on cities.</P>
<P>Some have averred that this vapidness is owing to the Cathedral, which nurtures so many <HI>drones</HI> as to make all the rest of the hive lazy. I hope this assertion is more invidious than true. I have, literally speaking, had no op∣portunity, at the four places above mentioned, of taking personal cognizance of this fact. At HEREFORD I did not perform; or if I had, their cathedral had just tumbled down, and of course—like rats, which never fail to leave a sinking ship—the black gentlemen were sheltered in some safer asylum. I could not refrain from remarking, that though the <HI>church</HI> lay in ruins, the <HI>chapter-house</HI> stood smiling at the danger—all the rent-rolls, tythes and commutations were safe:—as safe as the iron chest of a miser who has insured his house—which de∣fies the spreading flames, and keeps its sterling value in security, though bu∣ried under a load of rubbish.</P>
<P>At LICHFIELD they were providentially repairing their cathedral, lest, unable to bear the ravages of time, it should also tumble down—the clergy therefore were again absent upon furlough.</P>
<P>At LINCOLN indeed, where the cathedral seems to have the stability of a rock, and yet the lightness of a temple built with cards, the clerical gentlemen seemed to be on full duty. And here, though nothing but my compact to
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
speak the truth should force it from me, I cannot help saying that the above re∣mark obtained a little—but this I shall speak to particularly when I arrive at LINCOLN.</P>
<P>At YORK, whose stately and majestic minster looks magnificently stupen∣dous at a distance, and when you are near it as petite as the Lord's prayer, the creed, and ten commandments stuffed into a walnut shell. I know nothing more of the clergy, than that their situations are generally sinecures, and that whether their cathedral stand or fall—which latter there is no great probabi∣lity of—they may be absent when they please. I know however a prebend of YORK whom my heart warms to think of. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>As to NORWICH, disgust was my predominant passion, and therefore, like the father who would not disinherit his son because he was angry with him, I will pass by that subject. I shall also for the present have done with all other conjectures concerning the clergy; and content myself with offering my own observations relative to cities, which are, that having in general no manufactory or other public object to engross their attention, they are divided into people of tolerable fortunes, small fortunes, a few adventurers—by way of <HI>Cicesbeos</HI> to the wives and gallants to the daughters—and the remainder are such tradesmen as furnish the necessaries of life, and pick up a livelihood by the expenditure of the money circulated by those before described. The attor∣nies and medical gentlemen are in number according to the size of the place. A tolerable large city will maintain you—about thirty of the first, and fifteen of the latter: so much dearer in this country is property than health.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dearer paid for.—In every trifling village there are three or four decent houses, which you may be assured belong to the parson, the apothecary, and the lawyer.—It has been a remark that when one LAWYER cannot live in a place—<HI>two</HI> CAN; for in that case, if the people are peaceably disposed, one can <HI>provoke,</HI> and the other <HI>palliate.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Over all these, of course, are placed the clergy, who can certainly give
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
a sort of <HI>Ton</HI> to the place; and if they ever happen—which all the world knows is very rare—either to be ignorant, overbearing, or void of taste, these pe∣culiar qualities will be as surely predominant in their influence on the rest—<HI>and indeed ought,</HI> even as the whistle of the shepherd brings the sheep into the fold.</P>
<P>Thus you see how I throw my ideas about at random, which indeed is all that can be expected of me; for manners and men can no more be deve∣loped by a cursory view, than can a single glance determine the colour of a <HI>cameleon</HI>—which must have shade and sunshine, night and day, and every other adventitious opportunity, to display its different hues; and after all, so blind is human judgment, that it will be impossible to fix on that particular shade that is proper to it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All is not gold that glitters,"</Q> says the proverb. Heaven knows! my professions in no way can glitter; if they could, they would wear nothing but the sober appearance of truth, when I assure you that I am,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>When I consider the heavens, and the works of thy fingers!</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ask me when I mean to speak of music; and hint that my observations on poetry, painting, the theatre, and other matters, might be well intermingled with the narrative of my TOUR. I thank you for saying exactly what you feel, as you read my remarks. I have not been unmindful of any of these subjects; but I shall have so much loose ground to run over for three or four letters to come, that I would willingly shake it off my heels, before I come into the company of men of science and genius. In short, I shall not begin my critical attack till I get farther on my journey; for, to give you a pun in the place of a better phrase, one cannot be too far <HI>north</HI> for them.</P>
<P>From HEREFORD I went to LEOMINSTER, where I was told the inha∣bitants were very anxious to see me. Mr. PENE, the organist—to whose civi∣lity I am greatly indebted—took much pains for me, previous to my arrival, and I had one very decent night. The old stupid objection however took place. I was an impostor—and my performance was to be watched very nar∣rowly:—my audience were so much entertained however that they encored nine songs.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112"/>Nevertheless Mr. EVANS, a <HI>clergyman,</HI> proposed to Mr. GEARY, a <HI>surgeon,</HI> a bet of ten guineas that I was an impostor. The wager was accepted, and Mr. KIRKMAN, a <HI>country 'squire,</HI> was to decide between them. This last menti∣oned gentleman very gravely determined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that to be sure of all the impostors that ever lived, I was the cleverest—but that certainly I was not Mr. DIB∣DIN, whom he knew perfectly well—that not long before he had been <HI>pub∣licly</HI> in his company, and heard him sing several jolly songs—and that he was <HI>a tall, thin man,</HI> and <HI>wore a wig.</HI>"</Q> Mr. GEARY having lost his wager, query whether he should not have appealed to me as a court of equity; or in∣deed when this TOUR shall come out, may it not be considered such strong, legal evidence as may entitle Mr. GEARY to the recovery of his money—nay more, to a remedy through the medium of that act which makes it felony to obtain money by false pretences; for it was certainly a false pretence in Mr. KIRKMAN to say he had been publicly in my company. Had it so happened, I must have known it—for his person could not have been mistaken, being remarkably like a ninepin with the addition of sins. These premises therefore duly weighed and considered, I would advise Mr. EVANS to refund the mo∣ney, and Mr. KIRKMAN to give a handsome treat—which he seems very fond of—and pledge himself over the first pint bumper, never—in imitation of the long-eared gentlemen—to describe the <HI>roaring of a lion,</HI> lest, by exerting his own voice, he discover the <HI>braying of an ass.</HI></P>
<P>From LEOMINSTER we went to that pretty, clean-looking town, LUD∣LOW—whose appearance, from the distance of two miles—with the church in the center towering above the houses—forms as picturesque a <HI>coup d'oeul,</HI> as imagination can conceive.</P>
<P>At LUDLOW I would not perform, because the players were there. I shall not so far lift Mr. MILLAR, their manager, into consequence, as to make him a party in this TOUR; nor shall I pay the reader so ill a compliment as to relate the particulars of a low, contemptible plot, which—as every thing founded
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
in falsity ought—recoiled, and severely wounded the above pretty gentleman its contriver. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A lion preys not upon carcases"</Q>—out of pity—for I found by some conversation with one of the magistrates, that the story had made him as contemptible at LUDLOW as at WORCESTER. We dined, and went on to BRIDGENORTH, which place, and COALBROOK DALE, we had a great desire to see. As nothing but pleasure engrossed us for some time, I shall go on with my account of places, roads, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From MONMOUTH—which commands a beautiful view of both the Wye and the Munow—we passed to HEREFORD; the whole time beguiled by exten∣sive, rich, and variegated prospects. Brown CERES every where had spread her golden store, and plump POMONA half sunk under the weight of her abundant horn. My friend, who—till he took this journey with me—had never been forty miles out of LONDON, felt as if he had been transported to Elysium; and as our journey from MONMOUTH was on a Sunday, we took occasion to remark on the decent cleanliness of the villagers, and the sober, thankful appearance which nature that morning wore. We did not go to church, but I think we had as much the glow of religion in our hearts as those who did. You know, among my amusements, I practise painting; and I declare most sacredly, that in delineating the form of a tree—sweeping with my pencil over hills and vallies—reflecting the various tints of fleecy clouds on the smooth bosom of an extensive river;—but more than all this—rolling in the aetherial expanse, and commanding the winds to shape a collected vapour into a graceful form—HERVEY never had more delicious contemplations in his flower-garden, than I in those moments. An adoration of the author of nature thrills through my spontaneous fancy, and the expansion of my mind lifts me above the dazzling splendour of emperors. All this I felt on our journey—and for four hours could talk of nothing else. I lamented the evils that persecutions, dogmas, and schisms have introduced into the world; and how often the mildest and most charitable name that ever dignified human nature has been wickedly used—by abominable priests—to enforce slaughter,
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
exaggerated by cruelty! How much more consonant to the <HI>essence,</HI> would be the <HI>worship</HI> of a SUPREME BEING, if—without a single reflection on what others do—it were comprized in an obedient thankfulness of heart, and a sin∣cere and grateful acknowledgment of the imminent favours and distinctions we so bountifully receive from his gracious hand!</P>
<P>HEREFORD seems to be as insensible of these blessings as a gorged alder∣man of true flavour. The views continued with very little variation, in point of beauty, through our whole route, till we got to WOLVERHAMPTON; when the country became <HI>flat,</HI> and the soil <HI>sandy.</HI> About five miles before you reach LEOMINSTER—which circumstance I mention as a remarkable in∣stance of erudition in the commissioners of the highway in that part of the world, of which body I hope 'Squire KIRKMAN is not a member—there is a board placed up with the following words:—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever drives of this road shall be informed upon."</Q> For my part, I would not make any impertinent remarks on any thing I meet, but perhaps they hold some charter in this part of the world, by using this sort of orthography. It is full as sensible—and much more innocent—than baiting the bull, at STAMFORD; as however—though it was incomprehensible—it must imply some caution, my friend made a very admissible alteration, and it read thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever drives <HI>on</HI> this road shall be <HI>imposed</HI> upon."</Q> Which, it must be confessed, after the four horses from CHEPSTOW, and an extravagant bill at the <HI>Beaufort Arms,</HI> at MON∣MOUTH, we considered as no unwholesome hint; and it was pretty well con∣firmed when we set out from LUDLOW: going from which place to BRIDGE∣NORTH—if the traveller do not take great care—he will be sent twenty-five miles, instead of eighteen. You are asked if you chuse to make it one stage or two, and told that the road is very hilly. It is more likely therefore you will prefer—as we did—the two stages, that the horses may be fresh and draw you with more spirit, eighteen miles being really a long stage in that country. Thus, without saying a word more, they take you to CLEBURY—for in the direct road over THE MOOR, and through ASTON and DOWN, there is no
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>
place to <HI>change horses.</HI> CLEBURY is <HI>twelve</HI> miles from LUDLOW, and BRIDGENORTH <HI>thirteen</HI> more from CLEBURY. Thus, according to my friend, it is plain, those who drive on that road—if they are not wary—will be <HI>im∣posed</HI> upon.</P>
<P>Passing over the clay hills in Shropshire, is perhaps one of the most stu∣pendous and wonderful instances of extent and fertility that nature has in all her domain. The objects are so innumerable—their forms so varied—and their colours so beautiful, that the eye is—if I may be allowed the expression—agonized with enjoyment. Every hundred yards presents a new scene, and every scene more charming than that which went before it, till the rapt fancy rises to sublimity, and exquisite pleasure is lost in mute wonder! Nor are these expressions too strong for the subject. The hills were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cloud capt,"</Q> and no air balloon could be better situated for a good prospect than was our chaise.</P>
<P>In the whole of this journey, I was lost in pleasing astonishment; and could not help exclaiming in the text of this letter—which you may call a sermon, if you please, for even in this age I am not ashamed of moralizing—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I consider the heavens and the work of thy fingers!"</Q></P>
<P>Adieu. Confess, with me, there is not an enjoyment equal to that which pleases on reflection. One of which is that I take when I tell you that</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING wound—like the worm of a cork-screw—round that natural fortification that renders BRIDGENORTH a little GIBRAL∣TER—we arrived there, and supped on the wonders we had seen—for as to the musty chickens and high-flavoured ham, there was no eating them. The next morning we explored all the beauties of that uncommonly picturesque country; and after dinner, while curiosity was on tiptoe, went on to COAL∣BROOK DALE, where we intended to stay the night, and see every thing wor∣thy of observation. This however was not in our power—for the stench of the sulphur was so potent that we were taken ill; and I protest—though I have as few squeamish sensations as most people—I never felt myself so over∣come in my life. Indeed, the day was insufferably hot; which, added to the monstrous piles of coal burning to coke—the furnaces—forges—and other tremendous objects of fire and smoke, which spread round us to an immense distance—might probably cause that suffocating sensation, of which I can give no adequate description, but by saying that—as far as conception can picture—it must have a faint resemblance of being placed in an air pump.—And yet, though we laboured under this difficulty of respiration, the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
—and the workmen especially—feel no inconvenience; but, on the con∣trary, as we were told, are remarkably healthy, and live to a great age.</P>
<P>Some particulars relative to the place we were determined, however, to ascertain. The tar-spring, for example, was too curious an object to be passed by unnoticed. We went into the mouth of a bricked arch-way, which reaches three hundred yards; and when we had got about thirty yards, we began to see the tar ooze from between the crannies in the rock. It must be understood, that from the top of the rock, a pit had been sunk, which went to such an immense depth, that it would have been very expensive, and in∣deed almost impracticable, to work it. But, finding the coals of an admira∣ble quality, it was thought worth while to form the arch-way, above de∣scribed, at the foot of the mountain, and very near the Severn, that the coal might be drawn out in carriages; which mode of getting at them—instead of the usual way—it was thought would be so much more expeditious and con∣venient, as to make a saving—in a short time—equal to the expence of hav∣ing formed the arch-way. In the prosecution of this scheme, the tar made its appearance—at first oozing as we had seen it, and afterwards pouring like an inundation, fairly flowing into the Severn. The discovery was made known, and the course of the tar diverted by means of iron pipes, which, I assure the reader, are nearly as large as those which convey the water from the new river in LONDON. Large pits were immediately dug, and caldrons of a prodigious magnitude sunk; and, by boiling in those, it hardened into pitch. There are three springs; one of which emits an astonishing quantity. The first, when we were there, was nearly dried up; which induces the work∣men to believe that, in time, the whole will cease. But who can say in <HI>what</HI> time. The same rock may be traced seven miles—and every body knows at that distance they are now extracting tar from coal, which very probably is a drossy part, of the very tar, that—about half a mile from the iron bridge—runs thicker than treacle, but as pellucid as Burgundy.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118"/>I have since conversed with a chymical gentleman, who has bought a great deal of it, and he assures me it has the strongest similitude of any thing he ever saw or read of to the famous black pitch used by the Egyptians for embalming. This tar is remarkably free from impurity, is as bituminous as asphaltum, and has an agreeable odour, not unlike benjamin.</P>
<P>I must not leave COALBROOK DALE without saying something of the famous iron bridge. That stupendous <HI>pattern card</HI>—for it may well be called so—is in every respect one of the most <HI>artful</HI> and ingenious contrivances that ever was conceived or executed by man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It consists of one arch—and the river is, in that place, an hundred yards over.</NOTE>—for at the same time that it proves the dusky inhabitants of that gloomy region are equal to any thing in the way of iron work—though ever so ponderous and immense—it is a source of continual profit—a constant toll being kept up; which cannot be for the repair of the bridge:—for, though it looks like net-work wrought in wire, it will apparently last uninjured for ages.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I offered Mr. HARRIS—as will hereafter be seen—a number of ideas, wrought into complete scenes, which might in future, supply matter for different Pantomimes. This would have been one of them. He rejected the offer, however, as useless.—I am, nevertheless, well assured that I could have furnished him with admirable matter in that way:—to accomplish which I had nothing to do but look around and express those feelings, musically and poetically, with which the object, at that mo∣ment impressed me.—If in future any of the scenes I describe in this work should be introduced into a pantomime, I hope the credit of the <HI>original idea</HI> will be given to me—not for the <HI>value</HI> of the thing—only that the saddle may be placed upon the <HI>right horse.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>This place wants nothing but CERBERUS to give you an idea of the hea∣then HELL. The Severn may pass for the Styx—with this difference—that old CHARON, become a turnpike-man, ushers you over the iron bridge in∣stead of rowing you in his crazy bark. The men and women might easily be mistaken for devils and furies—and the entrance of any one of those blazing caverns for the approach of TARTARUS. Jesting apart. If an atheist, who
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
never heard of COALBROOK DALE, could be transported there in a dream, and left to wake at the mouth of one of those furnaces, surrounded on all sides with such numbers of infernal objects—though he had been all his life the most profligate unbeliever that ever added blasphemy to incredulity—he would in∣fallibly tremble at the just punishment he was, in imagination, going to receive.</P>
<P>My friend's first remark when he saw these dingy gentlemen was—that he should be sorry to meet any of them in a bye lane. Having made the very same observation to my friend BOYTON upon the colliers at KINGSWOOD—and being by him satisfied as to the fallacy of it—I was able to refute his appre∣hensions, by saying that I made no doubt but some reformer had done the state so much service as to have reconciled these people to their situation—by an assurance that, if they would be honest, they should only have a hell in <HI>this world.</HI> This turned out to be the case. One half of them are quakers, and the other methodists. Thus, was gloom familiar to them.—Nor do I mean to be sarcastic—for I declare I think that the civilizing the <HI>colliers</HI> of KINGSWOOD, does more honour to Mr. WESLEY, is a better fight, and crowns him with more laurels, than ever were reaped by all the heroes of the <HI>holy war</HI>—the upright perpetrators of the massacre of St. Bartholo∣mew—or the pious tortures of all the unfortunate victims that ever were brought to an inquisitorial stake. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What a piece of work is man!"</Q>—and yet, while there are such characters as the above <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"man delights not me:"</Q> except, indeed, a few select friends, to whom I devote myself, and among whom no one more than yourself has the good wishes of—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. <HI>RESUSCITATION—WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>I wonder men are not afraid to look into a newspaper, lest they should meet with something to make them unhappy for the rest of their lives.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING washed the sulphur out of out throats by a dish of tea, we set out for SHEFFNAL, and afterwards for WOLVER∣HAMPTON, where it was said we should find the best inn in the kingdom—namely, the <HI>George.</HI> Arriving there, however, at eleven o'clock, and find∣ing every body in bed, did not give us an idea of the most watchful inn in the kingdom—and getting no supper till one o'clock, and then a very bad one, did not prove it was the best provided larder in the kingdom.</P>
<P>The next day we moved to the <HI>Red Lion,</HI> where we were really well treated—and, the assembly room being in the house, I advertised my enter∣tainment for one night, which was a very indifferent one indeed; as however it was an unfavourable time, and the notice was short, I sincerely believe I should have mended my success if I had stayed longer. I have in the little time which I was there, to thank Mr. LANE, a merchant, and Mr. SMART, the bookseller, for several civilities—and I believe this is all I have to say of WOLVERHAMPTON, except that we saw the process of working up that very iron, which at COALBROOK DALE was in so crude a state, into every possi∣ble kind of form—with the addition of all that belongs to the art of japanning.
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
I must not forget to remark, that the wonderful discovery of the tar spring was at WOLVERHAMPTON—though at so small a distance—considered as a mere fable.</P>
<P>Leaving WOLVERHAMPTON we went to BIRMINGHAM, and from thence to LICHFIELD. Here I resolved to give my entertainment, and procured for that purpose the vicar's hall, which requiring the consent of a certain number of gentlemen, it came out, among my enquiries, that Mr. PETER GARRICK was living, and in good health. As the newspapers long ago—indeed just after the death of his two brothers—had been inhuman enough to kill him, I never was more surprized at any thing in my life; for, never having seen the account of his death contradicted, I own I firmly believed him at rest with his ancestors.</P>
<P>The moment I found where Mr. GARRICK lived, I hastened to pay him my respects. He was very glad to see me, and we chatted together I believe an hour. The old times of the <HI>Jubilee</HI> and the levees of HAMPTON made great part of our conversation, and we felt mutual pleasure and pain at the recollection. There were so many points of superior abilities about GARRICK, that though historical justice, obliging one to be <HI>faithful,</HI> impels a retrospect of <HI>little</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the most striking of these is, I believe, the following. GARRICK, one day—just before the <HI>Christmas Tale</HI> made its appearance—went into the painting room, and seeing, as he imagined, a prodigious quantity of gold strewed about the floor, began to abuse first the man who was grinding the colours, and afterwards to bawl out lustily for FRENCH, the painter. FRENCH made his appearance, and was thus accosted. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Wha—why—hey—damme—why you Mr. FRENCH—is not it—ey—the cursedest thing—that you will in this harum skarum manner—he—a—damme—ruin me!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God bless my soul,"</Q> cried FRENCH, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what is the matter Sir."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The matter Sir—why where are you—with your damned lack-lustre eyes—don't you see the ground all strewed with gold. I believe you think I roll in money.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gold, Sir!—oh what the Dutch metal that we have rubbed off in gilding the new scene?—it is not worth two-pence."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well—two-pence—and pray why the devil should I lose two-pence?—do you consider what two-pence a day comes to in a year!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, Sir, it is nothing out of your pocket."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes, Sir, but—a—yaw—you—are a damned curious sort of a—hey—how is it, nothing out of my pocket?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why you know Sir I have a salary for finding all these things."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh—a—hey—a salary!—why then damme if I care two-pence about it.'</Q></NOTE> as well as <HI>great</HI> actions, yet in recollecting the pleasure∣able moments passed in his company, one naturally rejoices that, in the duty
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
of a <HI>recorder,</HI> we can mingle a little the task of a <HI>panegyrist.</HI> I certainly had many differences with GARRICK, and they arose from nothing but this—I would never flatter him. Indeed, had I been capable of that creeping adula∣tion, without which no man can arrive to a responsible situation in the the∣atrical cabinet, or at least keep it—unless perhaps he be independant—I might certainly now have been in possession of a decent appointment—roundly as∣sessed by the bye—together with the superlative happiness of being puffed in all the newspapers.</P>
<P>GARRICK, notwithstanding, I sincerely believe had as good an opinion of me as of any man he ever was connected with; and, on my part, I de∣clare that nothing ever gave me more pleasure than my reconciliation with him before he died; which happened—and it is a remarkable circumstance—at the last rehearsal of my pantomime of <HI>The Touchstone,</HI> on the night before he went to LORD SPENCER's, from whence all the world knows he returned to the ALDELPHI to breathe his last.</P>
<P>Mr. PETER GARRICK attended my performance—and, for one, testified much satisfaction. The company however, in general, were extremely grave, which I could not possibly account for, especially as Mr. SAVILLE—who made me many professions of kindness and service—took minutes of the most striking serious songs, with a view of singing them himself. The truth, however, at last came out. It seems Miss SEWARD was there—without whose permission nobody at LICHFIELD dares to judge of any thing literary. My entertainment, therefore, coming in some degree under this description, and that lady—angry I suppose that I should burlesque the <HI>Siege of Troy,</HI> or con∣jure up the spirit of an <HI>old maid,</HI> or for some other notable reason no doubt—did not chuse to wear a smile the whole evening. What was the issue?
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
The DEAN looked grave—Mr. SAVILLE looked grave—every body but Mr. PETER GARRICK looked grave. I announced the second evening—every body looked grave. I attended the second evening—NOBODY CAME.</P>
<P>It has been confidently said to me, that a musical man at LICHFIELD was very industrious first to prevent, and afterwards—finding that impossible—to decry my entertainment. If this be not a fact, the man I allude to—un∣conscious of ill—will suffer nothing. If it be, let him reflect—for I will not give myself the pain of saying more—that illiberality was never yet the com∣panion of real genius.</P>
<P>Before I quit LICHFIELD I must not forget to mention Mr. GREEN's museum—which certainly, for its size, is one of the completest in the king∣dom. The ores, of various sorts, are remarkably curious. The coins, me∣dals, and impressions, large—in point of number—and valuable—in point of neatness, correctness, and preservation. The display of the force of magne∣tism is singularly worth attention; but, indeed, to enumerate every particular of this cabinet of curiosities—which is wonderfully well filled—would go far beyond my limits, and yet fall infinitely short of what the subject deserves.</P>
<P>Adieu LICHFIELD—and adieu Mr. GARRICK—may he long enjoy that solicitous attention he so amply receives from his friends; nor may the dart of death or any other human ill, for years, have more power to hurt him than the ineffectual calumny of a <HI>newspaper.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. <HI>A NASTY SUBJECT—TREATED AS DELICATELY AS POSSIBLE.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>What's bred in the bone—</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE came to DERBY a day after the races, which might be said to be—for me—a day after the fair:—for though during two nights that I performed there I was not so thinly attended as at WOLVER∣HAMPTON, yet it turned out nothing of consequence. Here we saw that wonderful effect of human ingenuity, the <HI>silk mill.</HI> We purchased some of the productions of the <HI>Peak,</HI> and we were witness to the whole process of forming, drying, painting, and burning porcelain.</P>
<P>It has happened, among the uncommon circumstances which have at∣tended this TOUR, that—like Sir ROGER DE COVERLY with his watermen and hackney-coach men—I have employed, by way of bill-carriers, scarcely one who has not had some natural infirmity. At OXFORD, I had two men who had not an arm and a half between them; at another place, I had a sailor with a wooden leg. I have had men with one eye out of number; but here, at DERBY, my <HI>factotum</HI> had been twice screwed up in his coffin. He gave the account of it himself—and described, that having lain so long in the cold, had given him ever since such a pain in his bones, that—as HAMLET says—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"mine ached to think on't."</Q> He had had from his cradle a lethargic
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
habit, and the first time he was supposed to be dead, he laid in a profound sleep for several days; the second time longer; but—being aware of the pro∣bable consequence of nailing him up too soon—they kept him till they were convinced he was actually dead, and having screwed him up—being nearly suffocated—he knocked as before, and was let out. His senses were consider∣ably impaired after this—yet, as far as they went, they were so acute and collected that he never made a single blunder in all the messages I gave him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though human calamities are the last subject on which I should chuse to be facetious, yet I cannot here refrain from recording an anecdote—but little known—of THE. CIBBER. This strange, eccentric wag, in company with three other <HI>Bon Vivants,</HI> made an excursion to FRANCE. THE. had a false set of teeth—a second a <HI>glass-eye</HI>—a third a <HI>cork leg</HI>—but the fourth had nothing particular except a remarkable way of shaking his head. They travelled in a post coach—and while they were going the first stage—after each had made merry with his neighbour's infirmity—they agreed that at every baiting place they would all affect the same singularity. When they came to breakfast they were all to squint—and, as the countrymen stood gaping round, when they first alighted, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'od rot it'</Q> cried one, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'how that man squints!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why dom thee,'</Q> says a second, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'here be another squinting fellow!'</Q> The third was thought to be a better squinter than the other two, and the fourth better than all the rest. In short, language cannot express how admirably they squinted—for they went one degree be∣yond the superlative. At dinner, they all appeared to have cork legs, and their stumping about made more diversion than they had done at breakfast. At tea, they were all deaf; but at supper—which was at the Ship at DOVER—each man reassumed his character, the better to play his part in a farce they had concerted among them. When they were ready to go to bed, CIBBER called out to the waiter—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Here you fellow!—take out my teeth.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Teeth Sir!"</Q> said the man. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ay, teeth Sir. Unscrew that wire, and you will find they'll all come out together,'</Q> After some hesitation, the man did as he was ordered. This was no sooner performed, than a second called out <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'here you—take out my eye.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord Sir,"</Q> said the waiter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your eye!"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes, my eye. Come here you stupid dog—pull up that eye-lid, and it will come out as easy as possible.'</Q> This done, a third cried out <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'here you rascal—take off my leg.'</Q> This he did with less reluctance, being before apprized that it was cork, and also conceived that it would be his last job. He was however mistaken. The fourth watched his opportunity, and while the poor frightened waiter was surveying, with a rueful counte∣tenance, the <HI>eye, teeth,</HI> and <HI>leg,</HI> laying upon the table—cryed out, in a frightful hollow voice, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'come here Sir—take off my head.'</Q> Turning round, and seeing the man's head shaking like that of a mandarine upon a chimney piece, he darted out of the room—and, after tumbling headlong down stairs, he ran about the house, swearing that the <HI>gentlemen</HI> up stairs were certainly all <HI>devils.</HI></P><P>This is a proper place to notice that at WORCESTER a <HI>madman</HI> took a great liking to me. He is perfectly harmless, and suffered to go to all their public entertainments. He promised to subscribe five thousand pounds towards building me a room, and said Mr. PITT would repay him out of the overplus after saving the million a year. I should not have mentioned this man but for one circumstance. He calls himself Sir EDWARD MASON, Knight of the poker—carrying a large one constantly in his button hole—and has badges of distinction sewed all over his clothes. Asking him how he came by a fine star upon his sleeve—<Q REND="inline">'Sir,'</Q> said he, the KING OF PRUSSIA—the KING OF PRUSSIA—last battle—mark of <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'honour—he and I—fought the whole army—killed, conquered, and plundered—tied the commander to a tree—robbed him of <HI>forty thousand pounds</HI>—and his WATCH.'</Q> Thus, how naturally he consoli∣dated the characters of <HI>warrior</HI> and <HI>thief.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Having been on a flat sandy soil ever since we left Shropshire, we be∣gan to look about us in our way to NOTTINGHAM—where there are cer∣tainly many picturesque views—and, for people not just come—as we were—from the borders of WALES—for I affronted a Welch waiter in Monmouth∣shire, by asking him if we might not call ourselves in WALES—to which he
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
answered—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Cot pless hur and luff hur, to be sure it is <HI>Waales,</HI> but it is not <HI>Welch Waales</HI> look you.'</Q> NOTTINGHAM castle is a very handsome object, and the uniformity of the piazza in the market-place, gave me an idea of its being a very likely town for my purpose—but I was born to bear and laugh at disappointments—as you shall hear.</P>
<P>We are told that NOTTINGHAM was, by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> called SNOTTING∣HAM; upon which word one might so pun as to make it truly describe the inhabitants; for they are a kind of <HI>mucus,</HI> which, though useful in the ge∣neral work of commercial circulation, cannot avoid being in itself <HI>nasty.</HI></P>
<P>After having consulted with Master BURBAGE, the printer, I thought it necessary to see Mr. MAYOR, who passed by the shop door as we were talking, and, at BURBAGE's desire, walked in. I do not recollect the gentle∣man's name—but, having told him my business, he exclaimed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"niow, you actor man, what would you <HI>hay?</HI> I hope you don't coom with ony
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
<HI>drooms</HI> and <HI>troompets?</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What Sir!'</Q> said little BURBAGE, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'drums and trumpets! Mr. DIBDIN with drums and trumpets! Good God, Mr. MAYOR! Sir!—why Sir!—drums and trumpets!—do you know the price is half-a-crown?—you don't know Mr. DIBDIN—how could you—Lord have mercy! Mr. MAYOR—drums and trumpets!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, well, well, well"</Q>—cried the MAYOR <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not know about these things, but I don't want a hooboob in the tiown. Will you onswer that it wawnt corrupt the morals of the prentices and the work folk?"</Q> BURBAGE undertook for me—but not till he had completely gone over the business of the drums and trumpets once more.</P>
<P>After Mr. MAYOR had retired—quite satisfied no doubt with having shewn his consequence, and great regard to the morals of the SNOTTING∣HAMITES—I enquired of my friend, little BURBAGE, how the taste of the town stood in relation to entertainments, and he very honestly told me that if I would advertise to swallow pins or eat burning tow, I should stand a better chance than by furnishing any thing that appealed to the understandings and liberal feelings of mankind. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Or suppose'</Q>—said he—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you was to let them come in gratis at a shilling a-piece.'</Q> I could not possibly conceive what he would be at. Upon asking him to explain—<Q REND="inline">'Oh,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the CHEVALIER TAYLOR practised such a <HI>manoeuvre</HI> with wonderful success.—He wrote a letter indiscriminately to every inhabitant of NOTTINGHAM—saying—that he would give a lecture on the eye <HI>gratis.</HI> His room was not only thronged, but every lady made a point of dressing herself in her best, in return to the CHEVALIER's politeness. They were first admitted into an outer room, and attended by a kind of master of ceremonies, who in∣formed them, with great good breeding and deference, that as the lecture the CHEVALIER meant to give was very abstruse, and could not possibly be rendered familiar to the comprehension of such as did not anatomically understand optics—his employer, the CHEVALIER, had with great conde∣scension and good nature caused a book to be printed which would clearly
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
explain the most difficult passages of the lecture, even to the meanest under∣standing; that, indeed, this book was worth <HI>half a crown</HI>—but the CHEVA∣LIER, determined in all things to shew his candour and disinterestedness—would have the very great kindness to sell it at no more than <HI>one shilling.</HI> Some few murmured, but the major part bought the book; and thus the crafty CHEVALIER put in his pocket about five hundred shillings, through an impudent stratagem, when, by the common mode of advertising two shillings admittance, he would have been a fortnight receiving five pounds. God,'</Q> said little BURBAGE—for he is a talkative, goodnatured fellow—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I'll tell you another story of the CHEVALIER. He bespoke a wig, Sir—a tie wig—of a poor, harmless fellow—a barber here in our good town of NOTTINGHAM—and went away to LOUGHBOROUGH without it. It happened to be market-day—I had some business at LOUGHBOROUGH, and I <HI>sees</HI> a fellow stalking along, with a devilish great bandbox under his arm. I thought I knew him—and who should it be but our barber—shaves me—makes my wigs. All he is angry at is—that I wear my red cap so long in a morning, that I make <HI>one</HI> wig serve the time of THREE. Well, Sir. Who the devil are you looking for? says I. Why, says he, the CHEVALIER TAYLOR—the poor, dear gentleman forgot his wig. Good lack! And you have been so civil to tramp with it sixteen miles after him. Very kind indeed. Well, but Master BURBAGE, 'twas worth while—a deal of money. To make short of the story to you, Sir. The <HI>barber</HI> carries the wig to the <HI>Chevalier.</HI> What do you call this? says the <HI>occulist.</HI> A wig, Sir, says the barber. A wig! Why 'tis no more like a wig than a cabbage. The hair is frizzled and crampt, and hedge-hogg'd, and porcupin'd—Oh take it away! In short, after having so abused it that he almost persuaded the barber to be out of con∣ceit with it himself—he offered about a fourth for it of what they originally agreed for; and at length the poor shaver—rather than carry back a wig that would suit nobody else—received the money, and they parted.'</Q> Thus was the CHEVALIER collectively and individually too cunning for the fraternity of stocking weavers. I could not, however, buckle to any thing that carried
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
with it the face of an imposition, and therefore thought but little of my chance. As, however, I had incurred some expence, I resolved to perform—but so determined were they—this time—not to be tricked, that if I had not actually held out a <HI>manoeuvre</HI>—though a very honest one—I should have made nothing of NOTTINGHAM. So much had they the old proverb with them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE old contemptible business of supposing me an impostor was brought up at NOTTINGHAM. The report had gone out, and one WISE gentleman assured me that he had seen Mr. DIBDIN, in <HI>a black wig,</HI> three years before, at the <HI>Circus.</HI> Finding matters were taking an un∣pleasant turn, I advertised that—as I understood such a rumour had prevailed, and as it was a very serious thing for me that it should be cleared up—if any at the end of the entertainment should feel the smallest difficulty to believe that I was in no respect an impostor, their money should be returned. This brought me a good room, and ten minutes had not passed before I plainly saw all their doubts were vanished. At the place I generally pause, many apologies were made me; to which some spirited officers present answered, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the best thing they could possibly do was to be totally silent, for the utmost in their power to say would rather aggravate than lessen the absur∣dity of their conduct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I introduced, upon this occasion, in the <HI>Readings,</HI> what follows. The poet related a whimsical distress he had once laboured under. Said he <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I once took it in my head to deliver a little entertain∣ment, at different places, which I called <HI>Readings</HI>—and, being possessed of good professional reputa∣tion, it was sometimes suspected that a man of my standing would not think such an experiment worth his while—and, in consequence, I was now and then treated as an impostor, for—as one may say—personating myself. This induced me to relate, to my next audience, the following poetic tale.'<Q><LG>
<L>IN ROME, where arts spring up, 'tis said,</L>
<L>As spawn shoots in a mushroom bed—</L>
<L>Two theatres of some renown</L>
<L>Aspir'd alike to please the town,</L>
<L>Both—on the plan of ours in LONDON—</L>
<L>Were sometimes rich, and sometimes undone;</L>
<L>Were sometimes empty—sometimes cramm'd—</L>
<L>And prais'd and censur'd—puff'd and damn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alike their fortune and their fame</L>
<L>Till, as we hear, one ROSCIUS came,</L>
<L>At a high salary engag'd,</L>
<L>The wond'ring town to see him rag'd;</L>
<L>Actor did ne'er such numbers draw—</L>
<L>For, was his part to kick a straw,</L>
<L>Or frown his fearful monarchs dead,</L>
<L>Or dance—or stand upon his head—</L>
<L>Fame spoke him the theatric king,</L>
<L>And all the world came in a string.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'What can be done'—said th' other house,</L>
<L>'We play—but don't receive a souse;</L>
<L>'Our last new thing no soul would sit it!'</L>
<L>Cry'd a performer—"Zounds I've hit it!</L>
<L>"The rage is now to hear this prig</L>
<L>"Take off <HI>the squeaking of a pig:</HI></L>
<L>"Let us stick up in large black letter,</L>
<L>"That we can <HI>do the pig</HI>—MUCH BETTER.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So said, so done—the bills are stuck,</L>
<L>The town with consternation struck,</L>
<L>Better than ROSCIUS! Insolent!</L>
<L>But 'tis a step they may repent!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The night arriv'd—and in a swarm,</L>
<L>The audience throng'd—a boding storm</L>

<L>Thrice low he bows—then silence breaking,</L>
<L>Instant the audience hear a squeaking.</L>

Whether this was a reasonable conjecture or not will appear in due time.</P>
<P>On the following Thursday we arrived at that pretty, clean town NEW∣ARK. I made some enquiries concerning the place, and found little prospect of performing to advantage, therefore, after dining at the <HI>Kingston's Arms</HI>—the history of which house I shall give in its place—on the best cutlets that ever were eaten, we extended our journey to LINCOLN, where we put up at the <HI>Rein Deer.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="132"/>I could make nothing at all of this place. Every thing seemed so grave and inanimate that I conceived it would be a great folly to stay. This resolu∣tion was accelerated by finding that the corporation was in a sort of demur about the propriety of my performance.

I nevertheless excused myself, and though the MAYOR told me I might <HI>act</HI> whenever I pleased, we left LINCOLN, passed through SPITAL, BRIGG, and BARTON, and arrived in the afternoon—after a very good passage across the HUMBER—at HULL.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>For this, among the rest, I was ordain'd.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT HULL, my friend left me, with a view—as his affairs in town pressed his return—to prosecute the remainder of his jour∣ney with more expedition than my scheme would permit. From HULL I went to YORK, where I performed, by way of essay, without mentioning any specific time. I was tolerably attended, and a gentleman—in the name of the rest—advised me, as the oratorios at DONCASTER were to be in the following week, not to do any thing more at YORK till they should be over. I took his advice, and went to MALTON and SCARBOROUGH. At the first place, I received many promises, which, as they were made by the parson and the attorney, it is not wonderful that they came to nothing. At SCARBOROUGH nobody would stir without the DUCHESS OF RUTLAND; and as I had neither time nor interest to conciliate her patronage, I returned with my jaunt for my pains. At my next essay at YORK, the company were to be sure returned from DONCASTER—but they were not recovered from their fatigue. I there∣fore—to give them a little more breathing time—was coaxed into another ex∣cursion, and promised great things on my return.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="136"/>My intention was to have a few nights alternately at LEEDS and WAKE∣FIELD. Having however a very thin audience indeed at the first place, and being out of temper with YORK, I went, by the advice of a clergyman at WAKEFIELD—in whose company I had the pleasure of passing some happy hours—to SHEFFIELD. Having however very little time to spare—this being the fifteenth of October, and my advertisements standing for the eighteenth at YORK, I performed two nights—one of which was a very decent one—and received so much private and public civility, that I promised, when the players should be gone—which was not expected to be till after Christmas—to return. Coming back to WAKEFIELD, I had a third night, which was a very good one. At SHEFFIELD I met with Dr. MILLER of DONCASTER, and Mr. F. SHARP of GRANTHAM, both of whom gave me warm invitations to their respective towns, which you will find, in the sequel, I accepted.</P>
<P>I shall not say a word at present of these different places—having to touch at them again—not even of YORK, to which I returned to worse purpose than ever, and left it in disgust. From thence I went to BEVERLY, to call a council of war with my friend SOUTHERN, to whom I shall introduce the reader. This gentleman has the whole business of HULL and BEVERLY as a dancing master—a character not always worthy a conspicuous situation—but here, and in the instance of Mr. SOUTHERN's son, at WAKEFIELD—who I could not place before his father—remarkably so.</P>
<P>Mr. SOUTHERN is no foreign impostor, of which description—to the disgrace of our schools, the injury of the scholars' morals, and too often the destruction of family peace—this kingdom swarms.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I must confess I never feel any thing like satisfaction at the distress of others, except when these frontless gentlemen meet with men as crafty as themselves. There are instances, however, when foreigners are as much imposed on in ENGLAND, as ENGLISHMEN are in FRANCE—and the following is one of them. FIERVILLE, who, wallowing in English riches, did not—like his countrymen in ge∣neral—retire and laugh at his patrons; but gave into every extravagant folly he could devise; had, among the rest, a MENAGERIE, and would give any sum for extraordinary objects to fill it. This a certain dealer in wild beasts and foreign birds—not far from the top of the <HI>Haymarket</HI>—hearing, he de∣mined to make something out of FIERVILLE. For this purpose, he called one day at his country house—accompanied by a man with a large basket—and desired to speak with him. Being shewn in, he ac∣costed FIERVILLE—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Servant Sir, hearing as how you was a gemmen worry fond of curiosities, I have brought you two of the most beautifulest birds in the whole world.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am very glad to see you Sare,"</Q> said FIERVILLE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vill you please to tell me vat it is."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why you must know Sir I have had a lord or two after them, and several fine ladies, and I believe one duchess—but I loves the foreign gentlemen d'ye see, by reason all my goods come from abroad—and so Sir I had rather you should have these PINK GEESE of mine than another.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"PIG GEESE! God bleash me, I was never hear of Pig Geese."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why no, please your honour, Sir—they be'nt a common thing. No, no, 'tis well known I deals in nothing but kurus affairs; so you fee if you likes it they be yours for twenty guineas.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vell dat is not great deal of monies indeet. When will you please Sare to let me see dem?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why lord love you they be without here. BOB bring in the basket. There Sir—you never sawed a statelier finer bird in the whole course of your life.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pon my vord hiss very hansey indeet. Cot bleash my soul it is all over sine ret! How much you say <HI>twenty guineas?</HI> Vat I shall do? I must have the geese—but I got no monies."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">O Lord never mind that! I don't want 'money. There is two sine cows and a calf under the window, I'll take they for the <HI>geese.</HI>'</Q> FIER∣VILLE, who was in deep contemplation on the beauties of his new acquisition, exclaimed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"pless my soul well tought—you shall have dem. Here Chon! Go kif that gentleman dat koes and de kofe."</Q> In short, the man drove away the cows and the calf, and left the <HI>pink geese</HI> behind, which were depo∣sited in an outhouse till a proper place could be prepared for them. The next morning a friend of FIERVILLE—a blunt honest fellow—came to visit him, on whom he opened immediately—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah my teer friend, I haf de most crate curiosity ever was see. Do you know I have cot two very fine <HI>pig geese.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>Big geese!</HI>'</Q> cried the other, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'so have I twenty; what the devil curiosity is there in that?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, no, you don't understand—fine colour, ret, peautiful. Come along vid me."</Q> He then took his friend to the outhouse, which having carelessly been lest open, the geese had made their escape. After a close search for some time, they found them feeding in an adjoining paddock, but it having rained in the night, the <HI>pink geese</HI> were become as <HI>grey as a badger</HI>—and nothing could have discovered they were the same but now and then a little red spot under the wings. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why damme'</Q> cried the friend, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you have been imposed upon—these are nothing but a couple of common grey Lincolnshire fen geese.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By cot,"</Q> said FIERVILLE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he vas ferry fine ret indeet last night. Hole your tongue, perhaps by um by he come ret again."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Red again!'</Q> said the friend, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'why you are a damned fool—the fellow has imposed upon you, I tell you. What did you give pray for this pretty bargain?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Two koes and a kofe."</Q> After reprobating FIERVILLE's credulity in pretty strong terms, his anger all turned on the bird merchant, who he swore should smart for this impudent fraud. To put his design in execution, he went immediately to him, and having threatened to take him before Sir SAMPSON WRIGHT, procured a restitution of fourteen pounds—the sum for which it was pretended the cows and calf were sold.</P><P>There is another anecdote of this same monster-monger.—He sold to a lady of distinction a number of what he called JAVA SPARROWS, which were of course no more than common ENGLISH SPARROWS stained a fine blue. At the time of their moulting they became exactly like other SPARROWS, when, being sent for and taxed with the imposition, he had the address to make it believed that it was the climate and the common food of birds in this country that made them degenerate; and, that if they were carried back to JAVA, they would infallibly recover their former beauty.</P></NOTE> He is an honest, plain,
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
unaffected, well-meaning man—is a father himself—has brought up a large family creditably and industriously, and therefore proper to have the care of youth entrusted to him. He is universally beloved, and his company—for he is remarkably cheerful and hearty—every where courted. His advice and his influence has been of great use to me, for there is scarcely a place in York∣shire, since I first left BEVERLY, where his name has not done me service.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138"/>My journey to BEVERLY—as I before remarked—was more for a consul∣tati on than from any prospect of success. Mr. SOUTHERN, however, had—previous to my arrival—consulted with all the principal people, and I was to be invited, as soon as I came, to a supper, in order to form the best possi∣ble plan for making me two good nights. Out of <HI>nineteen,</HI> however, who attended the <HI>supper,</HI> but <HI>four</HI> came to the <HI>performance.</HI> I must not neglect to say that Mr. ACKLUM, Mr. HARDEN, then the <HI>Mayor,</HI> and some few others, merit my acknowledgments for their attention; but as to the rest, they had skimmed the cream of the entertainment for nothing, and how could I be such an ideot as to suppose they would afterwards be contented to pay for the skimmilk. But—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for this among the rest I was ordained"</Q>—and so I was to tell you very frequently, but always truly, that I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GO to INDIA—dig in mines—tempt any danger—do any thing to better your fortune—to place yourself beyond the power of such humiliation! I declare to heaven I could not <HI>sustain</HI> the mortifications that you have <HI>smiled</HI> at, let what might be the consideration. The nasty <HI>Snottinghamites</HI> alone would have sickened me to such a degree, that when I appeared before them, it would have given me all the qualmishness and have produced all the effect of an emetic. And yet you promised to return. It will disappoint me, and—though I warmly wish you well—displease me, if it produce any advantage to you.</P>
<P>What shall I call you? That you are susceptible—quickly, vividly so—I am convinced; and yet, where sensibility might laudably, honestly take fire, you exhibit a stoicism beyond all example. I cannot comprehend you. I have traced you now, since you first corresponded with me, nearly fourteen hundred miles. What to do? It is impossible it can have been worth your while. Can the conversation and attention of a few individuals of taste and discernment, approach any thing near to an amends for all the contumely heaped on you by the suspicions of a set of people who have placed you in
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
every unpleasant point of view, and who believe nothing but that you levy contributions among them. Have I not myself seen doubts and difficulties started in every corner of the room; nods, winks, and shrugs have gone round, and when at last in spite of their teeth they have been obliged to con∣fess their suspicions were invidious and unhandsome, their self-conviction has put them so out of humour with themselves, and the tardy lagging justice came out in so reluctant a concession, that they seemed to wish you had been proved an impostor rather than that their own ignorant and illiberal suspi∣picions should be falsified?</P>
<P>If you restrain your real feelings to teach you patience, give you forti∣tude, and brace your mind to an endurance, and make it up to all the conse∣quences, of your intended voyage, you must have a philosophic heroism but little known, and less practised. In which case—and indeed in any case—I now give you leave to go to INDIA; where a small part of this perseverance—I should think—must enable you to return in comfort, and enjoy years of <HI>happiness,</HI> sweetened with INDEPENDENCE: which desirable situation no man more truly wishes to see you in than,</P>

<Q>"<HI>Fame's an echo.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR last letter is so pointed that I shall stop short my narrative to answer it, and that the world may be in better possession of the subject, I have a printed proof of it before me.</P>
<P>You have taken more pains to abuse me than I have to deserve it, and I could silence all that warmth and vivacity in which you calumniate me under the title of a susceptible stoic, by singly asserting that I am a PUBLIC CHA∣RACTER. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Good God!'</Q> say you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>so am I.</HI>'</Q> Have patience. <HI>You</HI> can dictate to your audience; you can win them, by honest and fair persuasion, to a discharge of that duly without the exercise of which they can neither be good men nor valuable citizens. But—admirable as your doctrines are—do you think no pulpit oration of yours has been criticised? Did you never see a guttling alderman asleep—while some fortune hunter was making love to his daughter—in one of your very best sermons? When you have strove with benevolent mildness to inculcate the principles of reasonable religion, and blend public worship with private morality, were you, upon your honour, never blamed for tameness and insipidity, and censured for not frightening your hearers into a sense of their miserable sinful condition, by lowering out damnation with uplifted hands?</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="142"/>A field preacher is not fairly inducted into his calling till he has been forty times stunned with brick bats and blind puppies. But this is nothing to what is every day sustained by men in much more conspicuous situations than you or I. Is Mr. Fox's poisoned bag forgot? the difficulty with which Mr. PITT made his escape from the grocers' company? or the dingy appear∣ance of Lord JOHN CAVENDISH after he had been rolled in the kennel at YORK. Beside, these matters fluctuate. What is a mark of disgrace at one time, shall, at another, be a badge of honour; and it has been often seen that a man who has been pelted with dead cats to-day—by the hands of the MOB—has, to-morrow, received a ribbon at the hands of his SOVEREIGN.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French author—by way of commenting on general manners—carries several different charac∣ters to a variety of parts; and, among the rest, places them among a horde of savages. Doubtful what may be their reception, they consult together what to do—lest, by some mistake in their mode of addressing the natives, they my get murdered. At lungth a CARTHUSIAN MONK—who has observed that in their ceremonies they use among one another are mixed many extravagant actions and gesticula∣tions—goes up to their chief, and having sworn at him in a good round hand, brandished a cudgel over his head, kicked him in the guts, and spit in this face, the whole troop pay homage to the strangers, and they are treated with every possible civility while they remain among them.</NOTE></P>
<P>Shew me the most fulsome puff you ever saw to prop a sinking play, or recommend a faded actress, and I will shew you an advertisement from a par∣liamentary candidate to match it. How completely has CHURCHILL written a lampoon on himself in the <HI>Conference.</HI> I think it is the paragraph which begins with that nonsensical distich
<Q><L>"May I—can greater ill mankind befal—</L>
<L>"Be born a WHITEHEAD and baptiz'd a PAUL."</L></Q></P>
<P>He goes on enumerating what, in his idea, contains the sum total of <HI>opprobrium</HI> and <HI>obloquy,</HI> and finishes with saying—that the friendship of one WILKES will make—amends for all. In another place—and I believe ano∣ther poem—he pants for fame, and fondly fancies that some one straying in
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
the church-yard where he lies buried, shall read his works over his grave, by way of <HI>epitaph.</HI> No bad stroke of vanity by the bye for the <HI>manly</HI> CHURCHILL. But how would his dust feel if the gentleman by accident should hit upon—<HI>the above quotation!</HI></P>
<P>Every man has his motives for his public conduct; mine are—notwith∣standing the conjectures of a few unbelieving individuals—neither more nor less than those I announce. I will be free to acknowledge that, in the pro∣secution of my scheme, I have met with sore disappointments: but these are the very spurs, the very incentives to a further pursuit. If I had retired upon meeting a rebuff or two what would have been the conclusion of my enemies? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This man fondly fancied himself a favourite of the public, but they have convinced him they do not care three-pence about him.'</Q> Having persisted, they will see that it has procured me such friends as will silence the tongue of envy, and blunt the poisoned arrows of malignity. If CHURCHILL gloried in his WILKES, what must I do when I can name more than twenty who <HI>really possess</HI> those valuable mental requisites which in his favourite he <HI>doatingly fancied.</HI> The firm attachment and persevering kindness of that gentleman alone who made with me a circuit of more than seven hundred miles—first left me at HULL, and afterwards took his final leave at YORK—is more than enough to compensate for all the arrogance, ignorance, and empty conse∣quence that have disgraced those who could not distinguish between a fair and liberal compact with the public, and the dirty impudence of a depredating itinerant. It is true I did not acquire this gentleman's friendship in conse∣quence of my tour; I have possessed that pleasure for some years; but it con∣firmed and strengthened it. So many mortifications has he been witness to and so much has he pitied and commended me for a temporary perseverance—as the foundation of ultimate independence—that I am sure I have secured his valuable esteem upon so firm and permanent a basis, that nothing can shake it. Let me here assure him that the many and handsome instances of broad and generous liberality that I have repeatedly received, both at the hands of
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
his father and himself, neither time nor distance shall erase from my memory, and that I never employed any moment to more grateful or pleasurable advantage than that when I have endeavoured to promote their interest; which, after all, is but a mutual obligation between them and the public. Many other very marking traits of friendship and attention you have already seen, and many more are to come; among which I cannot help noticing the kindness of a small number in LONDON, where I protest I began to fear I had scarcely a friend. The many struggles I have there made to enfranchise myself from the shackles of dependence—the general, hurtful, falacious opinion, that I have often had fortune in my power, but have wantonly and prodigally spurned the courteous benefit,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The truth of this will he seen by an estimate of my pieces, which having explained to a friend, he assured me he thought it an information of a most <HI>important</HI> nature to the PUBLIC.</NOTE> laid so firm a foundation for the dexterous exertions of slander, that, like the mutilated picture of PRAXITILES, I con∣ceived myself, in LONDON—where any man's fame can be murdered with impunity—to have been all <HI>one blot.</HI> Happily however, through the filth and dirtiness of all the malice sputtered out by irritated dulness and bursting envy, a chosen few have been able to discern the neglected condition of an inoffen∣sive traveller, and—like the good Samaritan, opened their hearts to a sense of his ill treatment. Not that I mean to paint my case as a deplorable one. No, pride and my good spirits forbid it; but there is—as I have remarked before—something for me so winning, so warm, so exhilirating, in spontaneous good∣nature, that I receive from it the same cheering and invigorating ray of genial comfort that a plant imbibes from the cherishing influence of the sun. I shall hereafter particularize some of the instances to which I here only allude; and will conclude this letter, while my heart is full of the kindness of my <HI>friend</HI> and <HI>fellow-traveller</HI> above, with saying, that though I consider <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"fame as an echo,"</Q> and—as much as SHAKESPEARE—hold it ridiculous to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"seek the bubble reputation in the cannon's month;"</Q> yet I hope demeaning myself with proper humility, as a public character, will not render me unfit for the
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
duties of private friendship, or induce me to make an ill use of fortune, should it ever be in my power. Those will best command who know how to obey, is an established maxim; and I believe the best command and obedience within the exercise of the human mind, is a peremptory subduction of all feelings but those which tend to the expansion of the heart, and promote the wide and be∣nevolent circulation of universal liberality, and an implicit submission to all those moral duties which soften the manners, humanize the soul, and impel us to beneficent acts of general fraternal kindness that can alone <HI>dignify reason,</HI> and lift us into MANLY PREEMINENCE.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING pretty well—I hope—quieted your scru∣ples in my last letter, I shall now proceed in my narrative, which—like the man with a black and white coat in the masquerade—sometimes presents you with one colour and sometimes another. You have seen the black side too much, I confess, but in future the white will be predominant. I have men to introduce you to, who will convince you that honest-hearted liberality is not extinct;—but they are stars that can shine without any borrowed lustre, and therefore let them come in their place.</P>
<P>At BEVERLY I first issued my proposals for printing this work; after which—taking one night at HULL—I passed on to LINCOLN, where my friend SOUTHERN was told—on his return from LONDON—they would be glad to see me. On the fourth of November—falling on a Sunday, and be∣ing exactly ninety-nine years since the memorable revolution—the wind being almost due south, very strong and squally, accompanied with a severe and in∣cessant rain. I set sail from HULL to BARTON. Nor is all this preparation unworthy the occasion. I am sure I shall endure nothing in my voyage to INDIA that will exceed what I then experienced; for if it did, we should be all past endurance. ANSON, it is said, was in the same situation, and was
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
heard to exclaim, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he feared, after having been safely round the world, it was his fate to be drowned in a fish-pond."</Q> But he escaped, and so did I, which I believe is all we can either of us say. But to proceed.</P>
<P>As we were getting out of the harbour, a man fell overboard from a brig which lay very near us, and disagreeable as the weather was, three or four boats hastened immediately to his assistance; but will it be believed that when they found he was an exciseman, it was with the utmost difficulty they could be prevailed upon to afford him relief. I declare to God I never felt so wretchedly in my life. That private piques between admirals and generals should restrain their public exertions, and so tarnish the glory of nations one does not wonder at: that a judge should recommend a jury to find a man guilty, rather than break through an established <HI>etiquette,</HI> or lose his dinner: that the <HI>ax</HI> should now and then be poised, and the <HI>halter</HI> frequently stretched, and the executioner glory in his dexterity: that a merciless attorney, for the sake of thirteen and four-pence, should coolly advise his client to ruin a whole family: none of these surpise one. But that a set of wretches should mock the agony of an expiring fellow-creature—merely because he was discharging a disagreeable office by the king's authority—is a wanton cruelty so unneces∣sary and so disgraceful, that I sincerely hope it never was practised before, nor will ever again. The poor exciseman, through much earnest persuasion, was lodged safely in one of the boats; and I had the pleasure, before we got out of the harbour, to see him standing upright. At first, however, he seemed quite gone. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Damme, the exciseman's dead'</Q>—cried one—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'So much the better'</Q>—cried another—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he is gone to his father the devil then.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, no'</Q>—said another—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he stirs, he is only drunk.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ay, ay'</Q>—said a <HI>genteel man</HI> on board our <HI>sloop</HI>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he could not help <HI>tasting</HI>; he has been gauging you see the good liquor below.

of merriment, or stupidity to curb what would have been as impractica∣ble a task as commanding the wind to be still which was then whistling in my ear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This nation pretty well knows that there are no people under the sun possess such consummate subtlety as the ITALIANS.—A man whose name is GRIMANI, after he had been in ENGLAND about a month, happened—as he was strolling about—to find himself near BILLINGSGATE—Seeing him a fo∣reigner, he was presently hustled about; and in short, the fish-women and water-men determined to give him what they called a complete <HI>blackguarding.</HI>—GRIMANI—who scarcely understood a word of En∣glish—hearing the word <HI>damn</HI> frequently used—was struck as quick as lightening with an idea that he should conquer them with their own weapons.—He thought he had nothing to do but think of a number of names unknown to the mob—and therefore began—damn CICERO—damn PLUTARCH—damn ARISTOTOLE—damn DEMOSTHENES—damn PLATO—damn ANAXAGERAS—damn SCIPIO—damn HANNIBAL—damn, damn AGAMEMNON—damn, damn ACHILLES—and thus he went on with extreme volubility, throwing his muscles—which was a pretty easy thing to do—into the most frightful contor∣tions, till at length one of the mob cried out <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'damme, come along Jack, we stand no chance with this fellow, he blackguards ten times better than any one of us.'</Q></NOTE> I therefore contented myself with seeing the gasping object of their pleasantry return to life, and when that event was established, sneaked into a corner of the cabbin to ruminate.</P>
<P>The first thing that struck my attention was a dispute between the sailors, whether they should take in two or three reefs in the mainsail and foresail, the majority however—being two to one, for our ship's company consisted of no more than three—was in favour of the two reefs, and presently we were a mile from land. It now blew and rained very hard, and three sailors, who happened to be passengers, came down into the cabin. They were asked by the rest many questions—for an universal terror had began to prevail—and they all agreed that we carried too much sail, but refused to interfere—for they were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not afraid of weather—beside, it was no concern of theirs."</Q> The dissentient voice upon deck was continually heard to exclaim, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"don't you see what short seas she ships. Damme, my lads, but you'll repent not taking in another reef."</Q> The other two swore she could carry every thing that was set, and declared there was not a cap full of wind, while the first as confidently af∣firmed 'it blew like the devil.' For my part, I always think that if those who
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
manage the ship do not feel themselves in danger, I have no right to fancy I am; but here being evidently a difference of opinion, and the squalls so fre∣quent, strong, and sudden, I own I began to think, with the sailors below, that there was certainly a chance of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"our being capsized"</Q>—and this I had more opportunity to reflect upon than the rest, being the only one, out of more than forty passengers—<HI>two</HI> of the sailors excepted—not sea-sick; which I have in some moments since lamented—for it has lost me a fine occasion to de∣scribe, in imitation of Mr. BARETTI, all the various effects of that important and very delicate embellishment to the observations of a traveller; though, upon second thoughts, I have been consoled with the reflection that it might have tainted my stile in all the rest of my narrative, and made it—like his—as tasteless as warm water.</P>
<P>After our poor little sloop had been buffetted three hours and forty minutes, during which she, above a hundred times, as fairly dived as ever did a duck, our sailors were so kind to run us aground at the mouth of BARTON harbour—the tide however still continuing to flow, we were soon got off, and at length arrived. At which time, the sailors who managed the vessel were not one whit drier than the poor, half-drowned exciseman.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the coach which carried me from BARTON to LINCOLN were two of those sailors who came passengers, and who had been sent from LONDON to HULL, and now were returning back to LONDON, in search of a little prize-money, which had been due to them ever since the last war. They said they did not know how such things came about, but it had always been the way to send poor fellows—who earned their little at the risk of their lives—from agent to agent, till what they received was not worth hav∣ing. To be sure they might have saved their journey; but they thought it was better to see into it themselves than trust their affairs in the hands of those land-sharks, the <HI>lawyers.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Sir ELIJAH IMPEY was on his passage from INDIA, he continually kept in the cabin from indisposition, while her ladyship was in very good health and constantly on deck. One fine day she coaxed him out to enjoy a little air, and as he was walking the deck—it having blowed pretty hard the preceding day—a <HI>shark</HI> was playing by the side of the ship. Having never seen such an object before, he called to one of the sailors to tell him what it was. Being asked the question—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why don't you know, an please your honour?"</Q> said honest JACK. <Q REND="inline">'No'</Q>—said Sir ELIJAH—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what is the name of it?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why"</Q>—replied the Tar—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't know what name they hail 'em by ashore, but here we call 'em <HI>sea lawyers.</HI>"</Q></NOTE> That there was something wrong, but they hoped, one day or other, every thing would be righted; for they were sure
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
when his majesty—God bless him—came to know how the poor, honest fel∣lows were served who manned his wooden-walls, some of the understrappers would get a <HI>salt eel.</HI></P>
<P>This was one instance, out of a great many, in which I have had oppor∣tunity to notice the strong intellectual feelings of sailors. They are honest and liberal, to a proverb; and it has been remarked, that public depredators, who have gone to church to pick pockets, have been converted into good ci∣tizens on the forecastle of a man of war. A friend of mine says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their ho∣nesty and good sense are fully accounted for, by considering that they have very little commerce with mankind; owing to this they despise money, and therefore have no inducement to become knaves; and as their wants are few, and those soon supplied, they have no occasion to rack imagina∣tion to keep up a constant deception in their words and actions. Thus, their ideas go immediately to the point they want to express, and their tongues transmit those ideas faithfully, and without embellishment."</Q></P>
<P>I must do my friend the justice to confess, that he gives us here a very ingenious argument, and for so very extensive a theme, as pithy a one as any of those for which the sailors receive from him such warm encomiums. It is certain, honestly and good sense are very congenial, and I should sooner suspect that an argument, which threw out a strong and brilliant display of lo∣gical and rhetorical figures, was calculated to <HI>disguise,</HI> rather than <HI>ornament</HI> THE TRUTH. I have certainly, in the course of an hour, heard a <HI>sailor</HI> utter as many good things—and I am sure with as little affectation—as Dr. JOHN∣SON. Nor do their technical allusions rob what they say of its beauty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The character of <HI>Kit Keel,</HI> in the <HI>Touchstone,</HI> came with me—on my return to ENGLAND—in the coach from DOVER to ROCHESTER. His real name is SPRAT, and he is a <HI>pilot</HI> at HARWICH.—The words I there set down, he uttered. And can there be any thing more striking than—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Money was made for our friends and the landlords along ashore."</Q> Or again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My money's my friend's, my heart my wife's, and my life my country's—my name is SPRAT (which he really said) and that's my way of thinking."</Q> I declare I never witnessed a greater fund of wit than that he possessed in my life. Speaking of fashions—said he—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll tell you what. Before I went my last voyage, my POL, d'ye see, stowed every thing snug, the hatches were properly battened down, sail set modesty, used sparingly, decently reefed, nothing shook in the wind, and there was enough spare canvass in the old chest in case of weather. When I came home—only an eighteen months voyage—Damme if I did'nt think I had got among the WANGHEES, or some lubberly, outlandish place, where they dress them∣selves up in feathers.—There they were—sprit sails and studding sails—every thing set they could carry and more to.—I say.—I expected to see them every minute bottom upwards. Well, thinks I to myself, this won't he the case with my POL.—Would you believe it?—Shiver my jib, if POL was not as bad as the best of 'em. You see, before I sailed, I could take her little tight head, tuck it un∣der my arm, and give her a hearty smack.—Now! Damme, every time I went to salute her, I stuck my eyes full of black pins."</Q></NOTE> A ship is a glorious epitome of the world; and its management is the strongest instance of ingenuity that human invention has furnished us.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="152"/>With these sailors in the coach I held some conversation concerning our narrow escape—for they assured me it might be so called—and they said it arose from this: the men who in conduct those passage boats are, in general, tolerable pilots, but bad sailors; they said this I might have noticed, not only by their neglecting to take in more than two reefs, but keeping the sails continually shivering in the wind—by which means we lay at the mercy of every squall, and the vessel had so many different motions that she shipped twice the sea she would have done had they laid her fairly close to the water. I mention this the more particularly because I think it will operate as a good caution to all those who draw the conclusion—which I did—that if the people themselves will venture, the passengers are in no danger; when, at the same time, we have every day so many instances of peoples losing their lives through foolhardiness.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not a fortnight after I came from HULL, there was an account in one of the papers of <HI>thirteen people</HI> that were lost in crossing the SEVERN</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I lay I am sure half an hour before I could form the most distant conjecture of what this noise could proceed from. Bells, ket∣tles, horns, hallowing, hooping, huzzaing, by men women and children, conveyed to my drowsy fancy a noise more horrible than did the angry billows which lashed the yawning cavern of the six mouthed SCYLLA to the affrighted mariners of ULLUSSES, for I will not suppose but that HE <HI>delighted in the danger.</HI></P>
<P>At length, by a few oblique words which catched my ear, I was let into the secret. It was the <HI>fifth of November,</HI> and the mob were carrying about a figure of GUY FAUX, which they informed me, when I came down to breakfast, was a ceremony performed on this day at LINCOLN with great <HI>regularity</HI> and <HI>solemnity</HI>; and that there was also to be a bull-baiting at twelve o'clock, and another at four. I enquired particularly <HI>where,</HI> and was told if I wanted places to see it I must be very expeditious, for they were not only dear, but perhaps all bespoke. My answer was, that I only asked that I might avoid so disagreeable a sight. I received nothing but a contemptuous
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
look for my declaration, and was extremely mortified to find that I unfortu∣nately run into the very predicament I was so studious to avoid; for though I did not see the bull <HI>baited,</HI> I was by accident so hemmed in that I could not avoid witnessing the miserable lacerated condition of the poor creature afterwards—and they were then leading him to where he was to be again baited in the afternoon. Heavenly God! I have heard of savages who have tortured their prisoners and afterwards eat them—but I could find something like a motive for this. A bull is baited we are told to make him eat tender—let him be hunted then!—let him become the fair victim of the chace!—let us feel nobly like our ancestors, nor degenerate from the brave EARL OF WARWICK by <HI>cruelly, cowardly</HI> tying a noble animal to the stake, and stimulating a number of peaceful domestic creatures to worry him, that human brutes may relish their dinner! I am told at STAMFORD they let the bull loose after baiting it—if so, I most sincerely hope the next time that event takes place he may toss the first man who sets a dog at him. Lions <HI>tear</HI> their prey, Hy∣enas <HI>betray</HI> it—but these are provoked only by the calls of hunger. But a wanton unnecessary cruelty—to which there cannot be a possible incentive, but savage hardness of heart—is a <HI>refinement</HI> on brutality reserved alone for the ANIMAL OF REASON; and, to make the case more lamentable, this most contemptible of all unmanly pastimes is the peculiar disgrace of the bravest nation upon earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>TOM CLOUGH—an under strapper for many years at Drury-lane theatre—was the man of all others who had the truest genuine taste for the English amusements. A cock-fight was his delight—a bull-baiting was to him as delicious a repast as a turtle feast to an alderman—but a hanging match!—He called one morning on a friend to accompany him to Tyburn—which place he as punctually attend∣ed as a hypocritical bigot would a place of devotion.—His friend, however, neither chusing to be waked so early in the morning, nor relishing this diversion, gave him a good round volly of abuse, and sent him away. The other giving him a contemptuous look swore he would never speak to him again—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'for damme,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'my maxim is never to have any thing to do but with <HI>people of</HI> TASTE.</Q></P><P>Mr. CLOUGH's accounts of the conduct of the different COCKS, as he called them—that he had seen <HI>die</HI>—would fill a pretty large duodecimo, which might not be unaptly called <HI>The Newgate Jest Book.</HI>—When I first came to <HI>Drury-lane Theatre,</HI> I used to listen to some of his remarks in the <HI>matted room.</HI>—His doctrine fairly was, that thieves in this country are so little checked in their approach to the gallows, that they go on methodically, professionally, step by step, till they are what the <HI>informers</HI> call worth <HI>forty pounds</HI>; and, as these principles are inculcated from their infancy, they talk as na∣turally, and with as much unconcern, of their death-bed at <HI>Tyhurn,</HI> as a sailor leaps into that ham∣mock in which he may be sewed up, or a sensualist enters between sarsinct sheets, to press that moun∣tain of down, where he is born to become a prey to the gout or stone.—I shall, upon a future occa∣sion, endeavour to recollect some of his anecdotes—which I truly believe are not exaggerations.—The only execution I ever saw in ENGLAND was at WINCHESTER, when I was about fourteen years old. I declare to heaven I heard one of the poor hardened wretches—not ten minutes before they were turned off,—ask a sheepstealer—his companion—if he should like a bit of mutton. BANNISTER repeats—or has invented—a very witty thing said by Jack Ketch as he was tying the halter. A cul∣prit asked him <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'if he had any commands to the other world'</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why"</Q> said Jack, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not much—I'll—only"</Q>—added he, as he adjusted the knot under his left ear—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Just—trouble you</HI>—WITH A LINE."</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>I performed at LINCOLN three nights—the second of which was tolera∣bly well, but the first and last miserably bad. Dr. KAYE was unfortunately,
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
while I stayed, but a few hours in town. He attended me, however, and had the goodness to send me afterwards a polite invitation, which I am sorry I could not accept. Mr. MONEY, to whom I am almost wholly indebted for the little company I had, gave me proof of as liberal attention as I have any where met with. In short, I believe through that gentleman's means every body was asked, though so very few chose to come. In the round of invita∣tions, however, it would be an unpardonable omission if I neglected to men∣tion the excuse of one gentleman, with whom I <HI>think</HI> I had the honour of riding in the stage coach to NEWARK. This gentleman was pressed very hard to go to my entertainment, and would have been there, he said, with great pleasure if there had been <HI>no music.</HI> I hope this gentleman is a <HI>bull baiter.</HI> At length, being very closely pressed, he said <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you know my <HI>detestation</HI> of <HI>music,</HI> and if you will only prevail on Mr. DIBDIN to introduce something <HI>to abuse it,</HI> in order to give colour to my appearing there, I will go with all my heart."</Q> I hope it will be allowed that this is one of the most cu∣rious anecdotes I have yet recorded.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="157"/>I here pay my acknowledgements to Mr. VANEIL, to whom my friend SOUTHERN introduced me by letter, for his very kind attention to me both at LINCOLN and at NEWARK, in which he did honour to his friends recom∣mendation, and to me particular service.</P>
<P>I must endeavour before I leave LINCOLN to account a little for the ca∣priciousness I experienced. There is a <HI>high town</HI> and a <HI>low town,</HI> and they are as much at variance as the MONTAGUES and the CAPULETS. Thus, the place having separate interests, and, taken aggregately, standing upon a very limited circumference, and containing but a scanty number of inhabitants, it is madness to think of an entertainment there. A playhouse at LINCOLN I should suppose must be in this predicament: if it was situate on the hill, it must be all <HI>boxes</HI>—if under the hill, all <HI>gallery</HI>—and if in the mid-way, all <HI>pit</HI>—and as a playhouse cannot live but by <HI>box, pit,</HI> and <HI>gallery</HI> COLLEC∣TIVELY, I should conceive the last place for the drama in this kingdom is LINCOLN.</P>
<P>From LINCOLN I went to NEWARK, where I performed one night, to a very thin audience, who promised great things if I would return in the course of another week. This being in my power, I did so, and met with no better success. Upon soliciting LADY LINCOLN, however, I received a most generous and elegant answer, appointing a night, and giving me the liberty to make use of her name and LORD LINCOLN's. This produced me as good a night as I believe the place can afford, and manifested one instance—among many I have experienced—that <HI>real</HI> distinction dignifies itself by easy and amiable affability, while all the pride and ostentation of affected conse∣quence—like a deformed figure conspicuously situated—solicits contempt; when, by a decent conscious humiliation, it might command respect. But, it is the nature of folly to expose itself.</P>
<P>I have ever remarked that the crooked women are always the first to go without cloaks, the ugliest to expose their faces, and those with thick legs
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
are sure to wear short petticoats. I am returning to NEWARK, when I shall illustrate this and some other positions; in the mean time, beg your com∣pany to NOTTINGHAM, where your warm wishes for my ill success will be fully gratified; where little BURBAGE—after receiving a <HI>good price</HI> for the bills—could not help remarking that it was a damned shabby business. But I believe there is no more cause in nature for <HI>thick heads</HI> than <HI>hard hearts</HI>—therefore, let us blame not those who do not enjoy the pleasures of good-fellowship and sociality equal to ourselves, but rather thank providence for giving us the charming enjoyment of that sort of sensation I feel when I tell you I am,</P>

</LG></Q></NOTE>—but one cannot be always infallible. Who, for instance, would have believed that <HI>genteel</HI> DERBY should, on my return, have served me as scurvy a trick as <HI>shabby</HI> NOTTINGHAM. I had the folly to linger on three nights, each of which was to be great things, and turned out nothing at all.</P>
<P>Let me, however, before I mention the particulars of these matters, bring you up—as the sailors say—as to the time and place. My first night at NEWARK was on the tenth of November. I then went to NOTTINGHAM, had one night, proceeded to DERBY, and returned to NEWARK to perform on the <HI>seventeenth</HI>—then, to give opportunity for the night bespoke by LADY LINCOLN, I went to GRANTHAM, and returned to NEWARK for the per∣formance on the <HI>twenty-fourth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="160"/>I found DERBY split into factions in consequence of the establishment of a new assembly, the etiquette of which could not be settled to the general satisfaction. One lady was desirous of being queen or conductress, and this gave offence to the rest. Thus, the partizans of Mrs. A. turned up their noses at the friends of Mrs. B. while Mrs. C—whose adherents were also nume∣rous—retorted the contempt upon them both, and in her turn was saluted with a whole volly of gibes and sarcasms by the staunch abettors of Mrs. D. A decent poet might have picked up something tolerable among them for satires and lampoons. How it operated with me is very apparent. Water and oil—fire and ice—modern music and genius—could not be more inimical than were these parties to each other. If I would have performed four times in the day, I might have had them all separately; but together! no consideration upon earth could have induced them to mix. One lady certainly did trifle with me in a strange kind of way—but as no longer ago than yesterday I received intelligence that she subscribes for four copies, I should hope matters were misrepresented to me; for as to her uneasiness lest I should introduce her into my TOUR—which has also been hinted—I cannot suppose she has any apprehensions on that account. To be sure her conduct was a good deal like the ladies at BATH; she did appoint a time for me when nobody could be there, and afterwards made me keep a company waiting more than an hour, under an idea that she was coming at the head of a large party—and, at length, sent word that neither they nor her could attend me—though she knew the performance of that night was an additional one in compliment to her.</P>
<P>The most curious treatment I met with at DERBY was from old surly DREWRY, the printer. This grossly ignorant <HI>man of letters</HI> took it into his head—because I thought proper to pay some attention to Mr. PRITCHARD, who was once under him, and to whom he cannot have the smallest objec∣tion, except that he begins very fast to take away his custom—to be offended; and the method he took of shewing his resentment was to charge half-a-crown a hundred for the same sort of bills which he had printed the first time I was
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
there for eighteen-pence. I really thought an <HI>advance</HI> of forty per cent, even in so trifling a business, was worth a remonstrance. This was what he wanted. He boiled with rage, and the truth came out. I asked him how he would like to be put in the TOUR. <Q REND="inline">"Damme,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"clap me up in your <HI>Tower</HI> at your peril."</Q> I told him I always did what I was dared to; and here he may perceive I am as good as my word. My discovery, however, has nothing new in it—his overbearing, purse-proud ignorant consequence, are as much known in DERBY, as the accommodating, modest, and obliging behaviour of MR. PRITCHARD—the object of his envy—and it will have this operation: in proportion as one grows malicious, the other will be prosperous. I mention this circumstance with some regret, as it is the only instance of incivility I have, to this day, met with from printers. To <HI>all</HI> I am indebted for some kindness; to MANY for much civility and kind attention; and to SOME FEW for a liberality and friendly solicitude which will ever make the warmest im∣pression on me; even little BURBAGE—as far as it consists with a <HI>money get∣ting man</HI>—I sincerely believe would do any thing to serve me.</P>
<P>I returned to NEWARK on Friday the twenty-sixth, and took up my abode with honest, worthy JEMMY WALLIS, who keeps the <HI>Wing Tavern</HI> and makes <HI>monuments</HI>—being at once employed on <HI>feasting the living,</HI> and <HI>com∣memorating the dead.</HI> Nor is he more inadequate to one than the other: his <HI>cellar</HI> is as full of <HI>good wine</HI> as his <HI>head</HI> of <HI>tasty</HI> and <HI>neat ornaments.</HI> But as no man is better beloved, or studied to do me more friendly offices, so my panegyric, even were it twenty times as strong, will answer no other pur∣pose than that of doing common justice to a valuable character. Some indeed may blame me for telling the world of the merits of a man only particularly known at NEWARK—and cry out—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what is Mr. WALLIS's wine to me, who shall never drink any of it.'</Q> Sir RICHARD STEEL had his ESTCOURT, and why should not I have my WALLIS? No ESTCOURT upon earth ever de∣served to be better spoken of. The only difference is, the two pens are not alike equal to the task, which certainly is not an unworthy one, for it has
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
drawn from the editor of the <HI>Spectator</HI>—in that nervous touching eulogium which he concludes with saying the pen drops out of his hand—one of the brightest effusions of his genius. It is true this beautiful glowing tribute of warm friendship to private worth deplores the <HI>death</HI> of ESTCOURT, while WALLIS—though every day recording the deceased virtues of others—keeps a state of robust health that seems, like a towering elm, to defy the depre∣dations of time.</P>
<P>The history of my jaunt to GRANTHAM—during the preparation for LADY LINCOLN's night—was this: I took a letter to a gentleman, who told me he could do me no manner of service; and in particular, that he could not be present on the first night of my performance. Finding, how∣ever, that LORD and LADY BROWNLOW and some other people of distinction were there, he came also; but advised me not to have another night till the following week; to which I did <HI>not</HI> consent. He, however, propagated that I <HI>did,</HI> and in consequence nobody attended. This gentleman's kind conduct was owing to his being director of the GRANTHAM concert, and it is evi∣dent he feared that if I drew too much company, <HI>his</HI> appearance would be but thin. All this Mr. F. SHARP can testify for me, who was very solicitous to oblige and do me service. This nonsense, and the arrival of the DUKE OF RUTLAND's corpse, sent me back to NEWARK, to prepare for the next Saturday, and set JEMMY WALLIS a cursing the GRANTHAMITES.</P>
<P>From the evening of my performance at the desire of LORD and LADY LINCOLN, I date the commencement of my itinerant prosperity; which—differing from the matter in this letter as widely as <HI>earth</HI> and <HI>air</HI>—will be the subject of another, and I shall finish it, as I do this, with complete sin∣cerity, by assuring you that I am, most faithfully,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT GRANTHAM, on the 22d of November, I received a letter from Mr. HARRIS, the contents of which I shall defer mentioning till I go over that matter regularly. Before I left NEWARK for GRANTHAM, in order to accommodate LORD and LADY LINCOLN, I made an application respectively to the corporation for use of the assembly room; and having obtained leave <HI>individually,</HI> I was astonished to find, on my return, that <HI>collectively</HI> they objected to it. In consequence of this, I found myself unpleasantly situated. I was relieved, however, from my anxiety by Mr. MIDGELEY, who keeps the <HI>Kingston Arms</HI>; the history of which house, in a former letter, I promised to give in its place. Mr. MIDCELEY offered to let me have his large room gratis, and I accepted the offer; in consequence of which I fancy he expects to be spoken very well of in this publication, and handsomely recommended to the notice of <HI>people of fashion,</HI> whose ac∣commodation—to the great annoyance of <HI>stage-coach travellers</HI> and <HI>bagmen</HI>—he very anxiously studies. I shall, however, go no step further than the truth to oblige all the Mr. MIDGELEYS upon earth. And the truth is this: When I first passed through NEWARK—as I mention in its place—I ate a dinner re∣markably
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
well dressed, and in consequence returned to the same house. I then found that the landlord had been cook to the PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES, and that the house was famous for culinary excellence. I therefore indulged myself in two or three favourite dishes, the merits of which I so loudly chaunted the praise of—having eaten them in perfection in FRANCE—that he, I suppose, fancied me UN MY LOR. Finding, however, I was—according to the mayor of NOTTINGHAM—only an <HI>actor man,</HI> I suppose, by what followed, he was determined to be revenged of me for being in∣nocently the cause of his paying me a little respect. He therefore gave me a miserable bad pair of horses to NOTTINGHAM, one of which fell down, and detained me half an hour on the road; and though he promised that he would very faithfully take care of any letters that might be directed for me to his house, yet he refused some that were brought in my absence, which, but for the kindness of JEMMY WALLIS, I should not—without great difficulty—have received. When he found LORD and LADY LINCOLN had bespoke a night, the tables were turned again, and it was impossible, with all his consequence, to put on a more fulsome shew of adulation. If he thought this was the way to procure my praise, he will find, by reading the above, how far he succeeded.</P>
<P>NEWARK, like MALTON, in some degree failed, owing to my having imprudently placed my dependance on a <HI>parson</HI> and a <HI>lawyer</HI>; but, in return, I became acquainted with another attorney, who paid me much attention, and without an interested motive; I therefore record the circumstance accord∣ing to my promise, as one of those which in all my life—much less during my tour—I have seldom had the good fortune to meet with.</P>
<P>On Sunday the twenty-fifth I arrived at DONCASTER, and that evening paid my respects to Dr. MILLER. I own I had nohopes of this place, and if I had entertained any, they would have been baulked—for it was like DERBY,
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
divided into parties: each of which seemed determined to deprive itself of its own pleasure rather than not disturb the tranquillity of its neighbour.</P>
<P>This instance in country towns of destroying that sociality which they seem so peculiarly situated for the enjoyment of, is astonishing. Some au∣thor mentions a circumstance of four persons who were going to the land's end in a stage coach. The first twenty miles they all spoke together; further on they were the best friends in the world, but were content with speaking one at a time; presently they all yawned; by and by fell asleep; and, before they parted, cordially wished one another at the devil. Now all this is natural enough. These people were never to meet again. But the first idea of settling in the country is a sociable neighbourhood; and, as those who are so situated must necessarily be near each other during a number of dull months, common policy would induce them, one should think, to give and receive as much rational pleasure as possible. But pride attends every situation in life. Mrs. DOUBLE TRIPE, the cook, looks with contempt on the scullion. Mrs. HANDY, my lady's maid, addresses Mrs. DOUBLE TRIPE by the title of <HI>good woman.</HI> Mrs. CRINGE, the toad-eater, sneers supercili∣ously at Mrs. HANDY; while she, in her turn, is huffed and dinged about by My LADY, and blamed for putting her out of humour, spoiling her complexion, and losing her lovers. A <HI>corporal</HI> is as proud of relieving a <HI>centinal</HI> as a <HI>general</HI> of commanding an <HI>army,</HI> and a <HI>strolling actor</HI> is as much a monarch for the time being as the EMPEROR of GERMANY.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A foolish <HI>stage-struck</HI> young man ran away from his friends, and got among a most low and mi∣serable set of strollers. A relation, after a time, discovered him just as he was going on to the stage in KING RICHARD; and, on reading him a pretty severe lecture on his folly and disobedience, received an answer suitable to all the ridiculous consequence and assumed pomp of a mock monarch. To which he answered—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'these are fine lofty words but 'tis a great pity, Mr. KING RICHARD, that you could not afford to buy a better pair of shoes.'</Q> The actor looking at his toes, which were staring him in the face—without loosing his vivacity—cried out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"shoes!—Oh damme, shoes are things we KINGS don't STAND UPON."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166"/>At DONCASTER the ladies of independent fortune had established an assembly, and finding on a former occasion they were intruded on by others of inferior distinction, they came to a resolution of admitting no trades∣man nor any of his family to the assembly. This of course gave umbrage to the major part of the place, who, in return, determined to have an assembly apart. Here for a little time the matter rested, and it must have been no un∣pleasant thing to see the lower house muster numerously, when the upper house could get scarcely any members to attend it. At length this second assembly began to divide. Miss LATITAT, the attorney's daughter, made Mrs. FRIZ, the barber's wife, no <HI>return</HI> to her curtsey; while Mrs. PTISIC, the physician's lady, sneered at the upstart consequence of Miss BUMPER, the innkeeper's daughter, and wondered that she should have the impudence to <HI>precribe</HI> rules of good breeding to her. A second division was the conse∣quence, and a third meeting formed, which, for distinction, was called the <HI>checked apron assembly.</HI> This caprice destroyed every expectation of enjoyment among them; their meetings being ill attended—and of course unsoci∣able—instead of answering the desired purpose, produced nothing but envy, bickering, and discord; and, were a sample of rational manners to be taken from them, would give an idea that human creatures were born to plague instead of accommodate each other. All this would have been the consequence at NEWARK, which LADY LINCOLN very sensibly foreseeing—with an ami∣able complacency truly noble—headed the assembly, and dispensed her favours with so equal a hand, that it caused every where an emulation—not to assume false consequence, but imitate true greatness.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOGENES being asked how he could live in a <HI>nasty tub,</HI> when he might bask in the favour of a <HI>court,</HI> replied—It is true I am deprived of the smiles of KINGS, but I don't find the <HI>sun</HI> is more asham∣ed of my <HI>tub</HI> than a <HI>palace.</HI></NOTE></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I shall trouble you with nothing concerning the en∣tertainment at DONCASTER, which I did but twice—each time to a loss. Not, however, to be inconsistent, I stick to my assertion, that my plan began to brighten up at DONCASTER. The business of the subscription went on pretty fast, and I received such good intelligence from WAKEFIELD, LEEDS, and other places, that I could no longer doubt of good success. Besides, DONCASTER introduced me to the intimacy of Dr. MILLER and the counte∣nance of Mr. DRUMMOND, who I sincerely hope will not be offended if, according to my pursuit of common justice, I take the liberty to speak of him. It is not, however, necessary to say much—for, when it is known that a clergyman is venerated by his neighbourhood—that the poor among his parishioners look up to him as a father—that he is the benefactor of merit—the comforter of the helpless—that born largely to enjoy the promiscuous blessings of life, his sole delight is the rational and enchanting pleasures centered in the amiable duties of a husband and a father—and then add that this ex∣ample of human perfection is no more than <HI>twenty-six</HI>—I believe it will be pretty difficult to advance any thing stronger on the subject. I cannot, however, debar myself the pleasure of relating one circumstance—in corro∣boration
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
of the above—which happened while I was there. The small pox—of a confluent and fatal kind—had raged very violently and was continually sweeping off numbers of the inhabitants—Mr. DRUMMOND having attended several burials, determined to stop, as much as in his power, the progress of this alarming evil, preached a sermon full of good sense and strong feeling, in favour of inoculation, and afterwards proclaimed that those who chose to have their children inoculated might do so at his expence. So blind, however, is human folly, that but nine applied while I stayed. One poor woman being asked why she did not avail herself of Mr. DRUMMOND's goodness, answered—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I thank God, my children are all blessed angels in heaven!'</Q></P>
<P>I was in the whole a week at DONCASTER, which I passed very happily, in the company of Dr. MILLER. I know no man of more liberal sentiments, nor whose studies are applied to more worthy purposes. His public letter concerning the <HI>musical fund,</HI> and advice towards the establishment of such an institution in the country, is full of generous, spirited, and sensible re∣marks; and it will do him lasting honour that his plan has already been in some measure adopted. His institutes are another proof of his wishes to make his abilities of public use. They are a work calculated to reduce the study of music to something like rule, in the nature of a grammar; and for a first attempt in this way—for he was very conscious that any thing of such a kind would be considered as a dangerous innovation—has great perspicuity, and may be made generally serviceable. But here I must tell Dr. MILLER and the public a secret. The masters, as they are called, fearing their mysteries should be revealed, which, like the glorious uncertainty of the law, is the source of emolument, decry this work of his whenever they can, and make their scholars believe it is only capable of teaching them a few superficial rules; whereas their whole fear is, lest it draw aside the veil of imposition, and discover that deception by which they contrive to lead on a scholar, in the course of two or three years, to the knowledge of what they might, upon a plain, easy, simple principle, accomplish in a few weeks. His elements of thorough bass is ano∣ther
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
ingenious work. He seems to have kept RAMEAU strongly in mind, and he could not—tempered with his own observations—have had a better model. I am only sorry he did not keep to those useful positions which so dumb-found theorists, as they are called—such as maintaining that there is not in the system of harmony any thing more than the common chord and the seventh—since by shewing how abstruse resolutions may be made, every man will not take the matter upon the ground of its being a severe satire on <HI>mere</HI> professors, but suppose he countenances the introduction of such chords. It is certain his book would have tended more to simplify harmony without it. But then he would have had all the cavillers, in full cry after him—and every man is not obliged to set himself the Herculean task of a reformer. He therefore gave them two roads, which—like those of virtue and vice—one is flowery and the other rugged. Perhaps he did wisely. Those who would be pleased with little trouble will chuse <HI>simplicity</HI> for their guide—those who would search and never come to the end of their journey will follow <HI>difficulty.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot introduce <HI>music</HI> so well—for I confess to you I mean now to dwell some time on that subject—as by a description of <HI>musicians</HI>; nor <HI>musi∣cians,</HI> as by speaking of the <HI>musical fund.</HI> This institution is too well known to need a statement of its origin, rise, and progress. The newspapers give frequent accounts of the thousands which are continually pouring into its coffers. But does any one know what becomes of them? Is such an institution worthy the benevolent contribution of hundreds, and the august patronage of a great, powerful—and what is more, incomparably more—a good and bene∣ficent monarch, which suffers the neglected dust of the matchless ARNE to lie without a stone to tell where it perishes? Who can suppress his indigna∣tion when he considers that the widow of this great man—old and friendless—applied to this society—so supported, so patronized—and went away with the tear of distress on her check, started by the language of reproof? And what think ye was the excuse for this unfeeling refusal? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Dr. ARNE had been, it was true, one of the most ancient members of the musical fund; he had
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
many years given it countenance and support; his oratorios had produced it good benefits, and'</Q>—which one would think was a stronger argument than all the rest—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'his catches and glees had caused half the drunkenness and disor∣der that pervaded their convivial meetings, when the reckoning was paid out of the stock;—but, there was a law which subjected any member to a sen∣tence of expulsion, if he or she should neglect to subscribe his or her quota for four several times; and Dr. ARNE having been in IRELAND, and so guilty of this neglect, he and his were for ever cut off from any claim to be relieved by the fund!'</Q></P>
<P>The widow of MICHAEL ARNE applied with as little success. There was something in this case whispered about difference of opinion in religion. If it be true, it can only be said that the best names may be prostituted to the vilest purposes. It is curious, at any rate, to talk of the religious senti∣ments of musicians. Harmony, in its extensive and universal acceptation, is certainly allied to a contemplation of that great and expanded symmetry and grace which so wonderfully qualify and knit together the various contra∣rieties on the face of nature, through the influence of contending elements, into one concordant whole—but for the members of the musical fund to draw an inference from the similitude of music to moral or revealed religion—listen to the calls of humanity—or, indeed, make any use of their stock except to relieve their tools and gratify their own luxurious pleasures—would be a species of harmony beyond their capacity; for it is founded in <HI>nature,</HI> it opens to <HI>benevolence,</HI> and <HI>modulating</HI> through all the fine and exquisite feelings of nice honour and smiling philanthropy, it closes in that best of <HI>keys</HI>—the HEART.</P>
<P>A consideration of Dr. MILLER's public letter, and a further investi∣gation of this <HI>charitable institution,</HI> shall be the subject of my next; after which I shall open my cause in form of NATURE, <HI>versus</HI> THEORY.

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DR. MILLER addresses himself, in his first letter, to the noblemen and gentlemen managers of the different festivals in comme∣moration of HANDEL, praying that the musicians in the country, as well as those resident in LONDON, may be entitled to some relief from that fund which their labours help to accumulate. He truly says, that charity ought not to be confined to any particular place; and urges a variety of strong argu∣ments to support his laudable purpose. His second letter is to the directors of <HI>the fund</HI> itself—whom he advises to admit regular country musicians as mem∣bers. He strenuously appeals to their feelings as men and professors of the same art—instances the numerous charities for whose emolument musicians perform gratis. He exclaims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"unfortunate professors of a noble science! Unhappy sons of an unnatural parent! who, while she procures wealth and comfort to others, suffers her own children to pine in misery and want!"</Q></P>
<P>This effort to procure relief for country musicians is however as extrava∣gantly absurd, as it is nobly liberal. What have the noblemen and gentlemen to do with dispensing the profit of the Abbey festivals? It is sifted as often
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
as flour, and—according to honest JOE—it would be wonderful if some of it did not stick by the way. I have had very particular opportunity to notice, that if nothing else disgraces the king's patronage in the business of the festi∣vals, the paltry haggling bargains that are made with the country musicians—and all in the names of these noblemen and gentlemen who know nothing about it—are a scandal to any set of men who boast the smallest pretensions to exercise a liberal profession. In short, it is—like every thing of that kind—a job. And how should it be otherwise? Instead of placing at the head of it such men as Dr. HAYES and Dr. BURNEY, the power is vested in sub∣ordinate musicians; who, like COLONEL COCKBURN, never get rid of the <HI>black hole,</HI> the <HI>gin,</HI> and the <HI>cat-o'nine-tails.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <HI>noble commander,</HI> because he could not conceal it, was continually boasting of his rise from a private man. His constant expression was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"did you ever see me do so and so when I was a private soldier."</Q> One day, in the island of St. EUSTATIUS, as he was reviewing the troops, he took no∣tice of a man in the ranks who was very dirty. Going up to him—said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How dare you appear in that nasty condition—your shirt's as black as ink! Did you ever see me with such a dirty shirt?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, your honour'</Q> answered the man, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'to be sure, your honour, I never did—but then, your ho∣nour will please to recollect, that your honour's mother—<HI>was a washer woman!</HI>'</Q></NOTE> And these, by this appointment, are to dictate to men under whose command common policy says they ought to march. Can any thing therefore be so futile and ineffectual as an attempt to turn such a tide as this—over which these men are the moon, and con∣trive to influence it into that channel where it can ebb and flow at their pleasure.</P>
<P>As to the letter to the directors of the fund itself, how could a man of Dr MILLER's good sense expect to have it noticed? Will a miser spare a single guinea out of his iron chest to save a life, or a drunkard a single drop out of his pint bumper? Poor men! their fund amounts at present but to thirty-three thousand pounds, and I declare—though I have had pretty nearly as much to do with the musical tribe as any man—I do not know at this moment any one object who derives a benefit from this charity.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="174"/>These letters, however, though they could make no impression on that marble to which they were addressed, nevertheless roused the resolutions of a few hopeless men, who—among a number of others—had been the sport of that ignorant arrogance that distinguishes the <HI>horn</HI> and <HI>kettle-drum,</HI> which make up the factotum of this wisely and honestly conducted institution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a young man whom, from the following circumstance alone, I hope to take by the hand in INDIA. He was bred to music—but seventeen—and fearing the ill consequences of keeping company with musicians in LONDON, he resolved to go abroad—first sending a letter to his father, in which were these words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The men I am obliged to mix with are so <HI>ignorant,</HI> so <HI>envious,</HI> and so <HI>pro∣fligate,</HI> that I dread, should I stay among them, what might happen to inexperience like mine."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. SMART—who keeps a music shop in OXFORD-STREET, and is also a performer—applied to become a member of the musical fund. Mr. SMART happens to be one of those very few who are blest with good intellects; and it is not wonderful that he should, in his life, have differed in opinion from these consequential musical COCKBURNS, at the head of the harmonic army. There could not be any possibly legitimate reason for getting rid of his appli∣cation; yet dismissed it must be—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"because why?"</Q> said one, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if we lets that there feller come among us, damme, but he'll be up to the rig presently."</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As my book is to be read at many places in the country, and should not of course be merely calculated for the meridian of LONDON, I may as well write to be generally understood. I have always thought that there is nothing like making a man tell his own story. It is the moment of all others when his heart is most to be seen. His habits, manners, affections, and foibles, are then so exposed that a tolerably sagacious observer may very easily discover the spot where he is most vulnerable; be∣sides, it is unfair to rob a man's expressions of any of their brilliancy. For these and other reasons equally cogent, I shall always endeavour, as strongly as possible, to place my actors within the men∣tal perception of my readers—in the stile however of the ancient drama, acting myself the part of a chorus, by way of giving a general explanation to all those passages that would otherwise be inexplica∣ble, owing to idiom, custom, profession, or locality. The instance above is one of the strongest I shall have the necessity to adduce. There is a language or lingo in LONDON, in the opinion of rhe∣toricians, of a very beautiful kind—for it is entirely figurative—called SLANG. This PATTER—which is another of its names—is frequently in the mouths of musicians, who, by imitating the inhabitants of St. GILES's—whence this elegant improvement on the vulgar tongue boasts its origin—in their man∣ners, debaucheries, and even the <HI>compilation</HI> of NEW MUSIC, adopt also their very mode of expression. I will not pretend to say that I shall always make myself perfectly clear; but when I find I cannot, I shall have for consolation the recollection that one of these St. GILES's birds once so confounded LORD MANSFIELD, that he was obliged to let him go, without being able to gather any thing from his evi∣dence;—but then this gentleman was an <HI>adept,</HI> whereas musicians, neither in language nor any thing else, aspire to more than <HI>imitation.</HI> The trial was concerning some quarrel in the street, and the KIDDY—the gentleman's <HI>slang name</HI>—was to give an account of all he knew. <Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> said he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my Lord, as I was coming by the corner of the street, I <HI>stagged</HI> the man."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pray,'</Q> said LORD MANS∣FIELD, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what is <HI>stagging</HI> a man?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Stagging,</HI> my Lord, why you see, I was <HI>down upon him.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well, but I don't understand <HI>down upon him</HI> any more than I do <HI>stagging</HI> him. Do speak to be under∣stood.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, you see, my Lord—and please your lordship—I speaks as well as I can. I was <HI>up,</HI> d'ye see me, <HI>to all he knew.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'To all he knew! I am as much in the dark as ever.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, then, my Lord, I'll tell you how it was."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Aye—now,'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, seeing as how he was a <HI>rum kid,</HI> I was <HI>one upon his tibby.</HI>"</Q> In short, he was sent out of court, and was heard in the hall to say to one of his companions, that he hud gloriously <HI>queered</HI> old FULL BOTTOM.</NOTE> At length an idea was suggested—for which the person who started it received the thanks of the meeting—that it being a rule for every proposed member to give in an account of his situation and the state of his family, Mr. SMART had certainly produced a paper saying he had a wife and four children, but in so doing his intention must have been to impose
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
on the charity; for at the very time he delivered in that paper, so worded, he well knew Mrs. SMART was pregnant of her <HI>fifth</HI> child. It was moved and carried that Mr. SMART had endeavoured to get admission as a member of the <HI>musical fund</HI> by surreptitious means, and, therefore should never be entitled to any benefit from it.</P>
<P>It was after this transaction that Dr. MILLER's letter got into Mr. SMART's hands; he consulted a few others, and, by dint of a laudable perse∣verance, a NEW FUND is actually established, which already consists of a decent sum, and has the sanction of many gentlemen of both worldly—as well as professional—rank and consequence.</P>
<P>This letter will rouse the charitable musicians more than all the rods with which I mean to tingle them hereafter: but I defy them to controvert it. Dr. HOWARD has an hundred times declared that it was an iniquitous
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
business. Dr. BURNEY said, some time ago, he had washed his hands of them; and they will never get over the respectable meeting at the free-masons' tavern; where their scandalous conduct was so severely reprobated, and the NEW FUND so liberally contributed to. In short, while the <HI>living</HI> professors of a liberal art are totally discouraged, men of real genius will naturally turn their thoughts to something else; obliged, however, to deplore that promo∣tions in <HI>science</HI>—like those in the <HI>army</HI> and <HI>navy</HI>—go not by <HI>merit</HI> but <HI>interest</HI>; and that, in future, to aspire to musical preferment, you must begin by being a fifer in the guards. These are the schools, as Mrs. PEACHUM says, which produced so many great men. I will venture to say, SIMPSON, the hautboy player, has done more injury to the cause of <HI>real genius</HI>—to which he was a stranger himself, and therefore hated it in all mankind—than all the festivals in commemoration of HANDEL will ever do good.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I shall give a strong instance of this when I speak of <HI>Love in the City,</HI> an Opera, performed at <HI>Co∣vent-garden Theatre.</HI></NOTE> I do not, however, pretend to say that the guards have not assisted the cause of music in this country very materially. The two PARKES, FORSTER, poor HOLLAND, and many others, are convincing proofs that it is the best nursery for wind instrumental performers in this kingdom. But surely these are not to be put in competition with men by means of whose expanded fancy and fine judgment are <HI>conceived</HI> those delicious sounds which, at best, they can but <HI>utter!</HI> My whose sensitive faculties revolt when I hear of an imperious <HI>kettle drummer</HI> chaffering with such a man as Dr. HAVES—and out of the thousands received for admission to the festivals—like a huckster, haggling for a few pounds—which at last, perhaps, may go to furnish out the revels of a guard room, at the SAVOY. The old women in this country say, if any thing is amiss, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the king should know it."</Q> If he <HI>properly</HI> knew this—so graciously benignant are his private virtues, so much does he greatly pique himself on being much a MAN, as well as a MONARCH—that I sin∣cerely believe the words of the sailor would be verified, and that somebody would chance to get a <HI>salt eel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLII. <HI>ON HARMONY.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>From harmony—from heavenly harmony—the universal frame began!</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LEAVING DONCASTER, I went, by invitation, to WAKEFIELD; where, having some leisure, I threw a few loose thoughts on paper concerning music—which can no where come so properly as in this letter.</P>
<P>Philosophers truly say that even the minutest objects have place on the scale of universal harmony; and—spite of VOLTAIRE's PLATO's <HI>Demiurgos</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is almost unnessary to say I allude to PLATO's dream on general good and evil, which having related to his scholars, and harrangued them for a considerable time, on the subject of it, till he and they are tired—one of them yawning, cries out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and so then I suppose—<HI>you awoke.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>—nettles and toads are not without their use. But it does not follow that men are to be continually peeping into the holes and corners of nature for objects that cannot possibly satisfy a single sensation but curiosity, which even in its gratification will be accompanied with disgust. These positions mi∣nutely hold good in relation to music. Discords are said to be the soul of harmony; which—if this declaration be admitted—must be, according to POLONIUS, very unlike <HI>wit</HI>; discords being the very reverse of <HI>brevity.</HI> So much indeed are they the limbs and outward flourishes, that one would think they were introduced to <HI>bewilder</HI> what they ought to <HI>elucidate.</HI> Yet fear not,
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
ye mere harmonists, but I shall allow that discords have their use; but dare not to think of them otherwise than as the <HI>spiders</HI> and <HI>hemloc</HI> of music, or that they are more material to the <HI>soul of harmony</HI> than those noxious objects to the universal <HI>system of nature.</HI></P>
<P>Speaking to men of common sense, I cannot be supposed to address my∣self to more than one out of twenty musicians. Nor am I ashamed or afraid of making the declaration. No man need be ashamed of telling the truth; and for the fear—the whole twenty will respectively believe themselves alluded to by the above exception; in which case I shall be thanked rather than blamed: for where is the man—a musician especially—who will not chuckle at even an imaginary hit at his neighbour.</P>
<P>To express myself less archly, and probably more to the point. What I am going to say relative to harmony shall, or I have lost my aim, apply to all men who have understandings, be they musicians or not musicians; and as it is a subject on which a great deal has been both said and done to very little purpose—as it has opened, as far as it goes, as many doors to imposition as law or priestcraft, and as been as conducive to picking of pockets as a semi∣nary at St. GILES's—I conceive it my duty at least to attempt a reform.</P>
<P>If ever term had a positive implication, the etymology of the word music is—to <HI>please,</HI> to <HI>charm,</HI> to <HI>delight.</HI> Mr. HERON, the critic, if he felt what I do at this moment, would say—I will spurn at common rules, and change—the better to express myself—this <HI>substantive</HI> music into a <HI>verb,</HI> and conjugate it through all the moods and tenses. It is true, music may excite horror, but then it is a mimic horror, which has its delectable effects. The <HI>ear</HI> is the door of the heart—and I will venture to pronounce there is no <HI>perfect</HI> music but that which is <HI>pleasing.</HI> The demonstration is clear: nothing can be <HI>perfect</HI> that is <HI>incomplete.</HI> Mere <HI>harmony</HI> is incomplete, for it is a BODY to which <HI>melody</HI> is the SOUL. <HI>Ergo—mere harmony</HI> is not <HI>perfect music.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180"/>The English, from their natural goodness of heart, take upon hearsay a man's abilities. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am no judge—I can't say I heard any thing striking in such an air—but the man has great reputation, and of course his music is good—though I must confess it does not seem to me to be very pleasing."</Q> Let this for ever decide upon such sort of judgment—</P>
<P>If a man have a disposition to be pleased with music—though he be totally ignorant of it as a science—if he can point out what air has ever given him real pleasure—which he must be qualified to do if he has heard the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> or <HI>Comus</HI>—if such a man should listen with attention a first, a second, and a third time to an air, and yet cannot feel a delight capable of the clearest explanation—and heaven knows that may easily be now a days!—that music deserves to be burnt, even though HANDEL were the composer. This rule, however, is liable to some correction. <HI>Original</HI> music will never strike at first equal to what it will upon repetition; so that original com∣posers—and indeed so do writers—run the most risque. Care therefore ought to be had to examine whether it is from the stile of the music the hearer can∣not immediately decide. The infallible way, however, is to hear the air repeatedly—and if at length it catch hold of the heart, the trouble is well recompensed by the pleasure it will ever afterwards afford.</P>
<P>By the same token, let not the auditor form a <HI>hasty</HI> judgment. A fami∣liar air jigging upon the ear may be <HI>pleasing,</HI> but it will, most probably, be <HI>stolen</HI>; in which case, it can be entitled only to an illegitimate reputation; and—like a present imitation of GARRICK—though ever so perfect, serve only to make us regret that the incomparable original—<HI>is no more!</HI></P>
<P>Any man with an ear and a heart, made rather of more penetrable stuff than the gentleman at LINCOLN, may venture to pronounce his opinion on MUSIC. I do not, however, mean those carping, cavilling critics, who, as it were, take the dimensions of sounds, and go about to explain their excellence
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
as methodically as they would to bore a cylinder or weigh air. These have <HI>ears</HI> too, but they are, like that of DIONYSIUS, <HI>expanded</HI> to discover—<HI>all the faults.</HI></P>
<P>Let not, therefore, any one be deterred from freely giving his sentiments, after having consulted his heart. Harmony is not intended to conceal the beauties of music, but to round and perfect them; and men may as well talk of a <HI>picture</HI> without an <HI>outline,</HI> as <HI>music</HI> without <HI>air.</HI> In short, all the labyrinth of harmony may be mechanically explored, but melody is that charm from which music receives animation, which cannot be attained by the art of man, but is an intuitive principle derived from nature. I do not un∣derstand the text—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"from harmony, from heavenly harmony, the universal frame began."</Q> It could not be harmony till it was completed. From a chaos of sounds men of brilliant fancy and good taste select a certain number, and model them into form and order:—for it cannot be denied that a song is as perfectly understood with a single voice as accompanied by a band.—<HI>Harmony</HI> serves to <HI>ornament</HI> and <HI>set off</HI> the <HI>melody,</HI> but cannot do more. In short, <HI>melody</HI> is the <HI>naked figure,</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> the <HI>dress</HI>—which now a-days is as fantastical and ridiculous as the clothes of men and women—and believe I need not say any thing stronger to prove that harmony should contain nothing but what is <HI>neat, convenient,</HI> and <HI>graceful,</HI> which every body understands. <HI>Ergo</HI> every body is musician enough to be a musical critic; and thus the stupid nonsense of theorists ought for ever to be silenced:—but there would be as much difficulty to do that, as to prevent me from telling you how much I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. <HI>A RETURN TO PLACES AND CHARACTERS.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>If variety be a pleasure in life.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I shall drop a little the subject of music, to tell you. how I sped at WAKEFIELD, and introduce to your notice such characters and incidents as are now ripe for your observation. Among these let me first speak of one of the most intelligent, cheerful, pleasant men I have met with. I mean Mr. CLEMENTSHAW, who is by every body admired and respected, and whose conversation—for indeed it is very desireable—is every where de∣sired. He is the organist—was a pupil of Dr. MILLER—has all the neigh∣bouring teaching—and is in a very comfortable and reputable situation. His performance on the harpsichord is second only to BOYTON; nay, when we consider that this happy, easy man—whose face is never without a smile, nor I believe his heart without a benevolent sensation—is blind—which I would not declare did I not know his perfect good sense and strong philosophy—he may, in some respects, be considered as BOYTON's equal. No man's conver∣sation is more agreeable, for no man has a more perspicuous and decided judgment on all general subjects. But his great forte is a rational laugh. He shall make you more and better extemporary puns in an hour—with a view to <HI>laugh at punning</HI>—than Mr. O'KEEFE would studiously introduce in a whole
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
piece, in expectation of <HI>same.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I will give a few instances. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Don't you think,'</Q> said one, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that is a <HI>striking</HI> argument?'</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why no,"</Q> answered he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I dont think any <HI>blows</HI> past."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Waiter,'</Q> said one, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>fill</HI> that glass <HI>full.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"shall he <HI>fulfil</HI> your request."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This table is made of good wood,'</Q> says one. <Q REND="inline">"Yes"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is like the Yorkshireman going with his pig to market—<HI>ma hog an I.</HI>"</Q> And then, when we could not get the waiter near us—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Did you ever see"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"such a set of <HI>uncome for table</HI> fellows?"</Q> And afterwards—being asked to drink wine—said he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is perfectly coasting."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How coasting?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why we are already at <HI>Port's-mouth,</HI> and you are so determined to bring us to <HI>Ply-mouth,</HI> that if we don't take care we shall be at <HI>Fail-mouth.</HI>"</Q> I would have him take care, lest he should be sent for to make Operas; for as he can <HI>pun</HI> and <HI>compose,</HI> he might become a dangerous competitor to Messrs. O'KEEFE and SHIELDS. But I fancy they need not be uneasy—he has too much good sense to quit his agreeable situation; and if he was either to write or compose for the public, he would neither disgrace his <HI>piece</HI> by a <HI>pun,</HI> nor his <HI>music</HI> by an <HI>imitation.</HI></NOTE> He has read every thing, has a wonderfully retentive memory, and separates and discriminates sentiments and opinions in an elegant taste, and with modest and convincing arguments. In short, I know not any man in whose company I have felt more pleasure; no wonder therefore I take so much in repeating it. Mr. SOUTHERN, of WAKEFIELD, who is a fine young man, and much beloved, is also entitled to my acknow∣ledgements; and the Rev. Mr. VINCENT will, I hope, pardon me if I take this opportunity of thanking him with great sincerity for the many kind services he did me. Nor shall WALLER the printer, that well-mean∣ing kind creature, go without my hearty good wishes, for I am sure I have his.</P>
<P>I had one very good night at WAKEFIELD—Saturday December 8th—and after spending the Sunday most agreeably with CLEMENTSHAW, went on the Monday to LEEDS. On Tuesday I performed to a very decent number, among which were some of the principal people, who, at the end of the entertainment, begged I would give it again on the Thursday. One gentleman, in particular, took a great deal of pains, procured me the assembly room, was in a great measure the cause of its being well filled, and gave me a handsome letter to a gentleman at MANCHESTER.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="184"/>I must not pass by an incident which very strongly proves a position—not a bad one by the bye—of Mr. ASTLEY, the rider. Says he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your SHAKESPEARE there, upon the stage, says that all the world's a stage.—Damme, I says, says I, all the world's a puppet shew. Why now d'ye see ben't every body shew-men? Don't the king, good bless him, shew his lions at the tower?"</Q> But to proceed. There happened to be at LEEDS, at the time I mention, a full grown gentleman, six and thirty inches high; and about an hour before I began my performance, an ambassador from the <HI>little man</HI> was dispatched to negociate with me the terms of an itinerant alliance. I listened to the proposal with great coolness, and asked if it was the wish of this man in miniature to be produced out of my pocket, or ex∣hibited on my finger while I should sing <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"say little foolish fluttering thing."</Q></P>
<P>At LEEDS I became acquainted with Mr. WARBURTON, an independant professional man, who has it amply in his power to assist the amusement of the public, without the necessity of submitting to humiliation. His spirited and sensible conduct in a business that happened just before I came to LEEDS, as above, gives a striking proof of this. I had heard at WAKEFIELD that it would be impolitic to apply to Mr. WARBURTON, for he was <HI>out of favour.</HI> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How out of favour?'</Q> Why he had neglected to attend one of the concerts.—My answer was, that I supposed he was better engaged. The fact however was this.—Mr. WARBURTON was chosen by the managers of the concert as commander in chief: for it would have been an affront to his situation in life to have considered him in any other light. Notwithstanding this, he was continually thwarted, and though out of pocket by the concert, expected to be at their beck and call upon all occasions. This he overlooked with the con∣tempt it merited—determined to go on as smoothly as he could till the end of the season; but being ill—<HI>they</HI> say, through having drank too much the day before at a turtle-feast—he thought it could be no such great matter if they were for once to make a trial of spelling out the <HI>concertos</HI> and <HI>sonatas</HI> by them∣selves. A resolution was immediately formed—and immediately repented of—
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
to admit Mr. WARBURTON no more: who, on his part, very properly de∣termined to have nothing more to do with them. What is the consequence? It never would have given him any pleasure to have his ears tortured with the dissonance and false time of <HI>gentlemen players,</HI> who, after all, he must not dare to command—for they were in the situation of <HI>Trinculo</HI> in the <HI>Tempest</HI>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You shall be king, and I'll be viceroy over you."</Q> He must therefore secretly rejoice at being rid of a trouble, which nothing but his own good nature—of which no man possesses a larger share—ever induced him to give himself; and they repine at their nonsensical folly which has deprived them of the only means by which their concert could stand the smallest chance of flourishing, or being respectable. As to the business of the turtle-feast, 'tis too illiberal to talk about it; but, admitting it were true, it only proves that Mr. WARBUR∣TON cannot stand liquor quite so well as themselves. I have so particularly mentioned this circumstance, that it may serve as a hint to the <HI>diletanti</HI> in the country, who—and they may take my word for it—because they can <HI>scrape</HI> upon the <HI>fiddle</HI> out of tune, <HI>toot</HI> a little upon the <HI>flute,</HI> or <HI>growl</HI> upon the <HI>vio∣loncello,</HI> are neither qualified to command such men as Mr. WARBURTON, nor give the <HI>ton</HI> to the MUSICAL WORLD.</P>
<P>My TOUR has already pretty well shewn that I have as much patience as any public man need; but I declare, were I in the affluent situation of Mr. WARBURTON, which—as he truly deserves—may he long comfortably en∣joy! I should content myself with the eligible and distinguished attention paid me by LORD MEXBOROUGH, SIR GEORGE ARMYTAGE, Mr. FAWKES, &amp;c. and feel very little inclination indeed to be at the devotion of a set of <HI>mechanics</HI> who think themselves of prodigious consequence, by having taken it into their heads to become <HI>gentlemen fidlers.</HI> Among these, God forbid I should have the ingratitude to rank any of those who attended me.</P>
<P>LEEDS is a town of great trade; so much so, that a gentleman belong∣ing to one of the banks assured me the whole returns of the place could not be
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
less than from five to seven millions a year. This cannot be done but by men who have thrown <HI>fortunes</HI> into <HI>trade,</HI> who, as I have often experienced, have nothing of the littleness that springs in low minds from <HI>turning the penny.</HI> I desire also I may not be understood to say that there are not tradesmen who have heads and hearts that would do honour to the highest situations. <HI>Kings</HI> may do <HI>little</HI> actions, and <HI>coblers—great</HI> ones. I aim at nothing but to distin∣guish between meanness and generosity. Those who possess—and that largely—the latter quality, are now among Mr. WARBURTON's friends; and I fancy any man, upon the same terms, will not feel uneasy at being—in the way he is—<HI>out of favour.</HI> Such favour is as indifferent to him, as yours is material to</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING in my last letter but one spoken gene∣rally of <HI>harmony,</HI> and shewn that it is the mere <HI>wood</HI> and <HI>stone</HI> of MUSIC—which might as well have lain dormant as a part of the original chaos, if <HI>me∣lody</HI> did not lend it order, symmetry, and proportion. I shall, in this, in∣vestigate it something more minutely, and shew that what is called harmony is now <HI>refined</HI> into such a pitch of barbarism—which, though it may seem a paradox, is literally truth—that the ear would be better gratified by the grossest violation of the rules of composition, as they are called, than by such abstruse subdivisions of tones and resolutions of discords as—according to <HI>theorists</HI>—are the very essence of <HI>harmony.</HI> Nor am I unable or unwilling to prove what I advance.</P>
<P>Every rule of composition, except avoiding consecutive fifths and octaves, are—in the hands of men of genius—to be violated with considerable advantage; else, the great HANDEL—the masterly CORRELLI—the charming, natural, easy ARNE—the graceful GALUPPI—and almost every body of real consequence must be excluded from among the adepts. To these two standing rules how∣ever the boldest sons of nature have paid some respect; and it is true that two
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
major fifths should never be consecutive. Upon this I ground my argument. Let any man play two sensecutive fifths—which would be a musical sacrilege—and it shall sound more pleasing to an indifferent ear than the introduction of the chord of the thirteenth, ever so well prepared and resolved—which is a <HI>musical excellences.</HI> But who shall answer when I go further and say that the very harmonists themselves have only to play on a full organ, and they will infallibly add to the charms of their own ingenious modulation, all these complicate violations of harmony!—for the <HI>diapason, principle,</HI> and <HI>sesqualtra</HI> compounding the very distances which musicians are commanded to avoid, the beauties and faults are blended together, and how must the understanding be shocked by the admission of error into a system of perfection! How then shall this be reconciled? The organ is a noble instrument. Some <HI>poet</HI> says it is calculated to inspire holy love. The <HI>musician,</HI> therefore, cannot lay the fault on the <HI>instrument,</HI> as the <HI>devil</HI> did upon the <HI>water</HI> because he could not swim. This will be found to be the fact: Let a simple, unadorned melody be accompanied only by such modulations as arise from the general and per∣fect nature of the subject, and—notwithstanding the violation of the rules in consequence of the complicate construction of the instrument—my life for it the right effect upon the passions will be produced; without which <HI>harmony</HI> is no longer <HI>pleasing,</HI> and consequently no longer <HI>music.</HI></P>
<P>One should think these dogmatic musicians knew their own defects and encouraged them—like callous hearted lawyers, who dare not indulge the softer feelings lest they should incline them to pity and compassion. I am told there is a certain great harmonist who wears the <HI>hind</HI> part of his shirt <HI>before,</HI> by way of armour against CUPID—fearing lest any thing <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>natural</HI> should get into any of his compositions; and as to Mr. BAUMGARTEN, who is at this moment supposed to be the best <HI>theorist</HI> in the kingdom, he has so wonder∣fully <HI>improved</HI> upon fuguing, that he never <HI>leads</HI> the band at <HI>Covent Garden</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
<HI>theatre</HI> but the instruments all <HI>follow.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. SHAW, who leads the band at <HI>Drury Lane,</HI> and who manifests more style and taste in the conducting of any one <HI>overture</HI> than Mr. BAUMGARTEN ever did in his whole life, has, it seems, put himself apprentice to this great man. Thus, in time, we may have lively hopes—when the bagpipe shall have done squeaking—that theatrical music, like theatrical government, shall be distinguished by its discords; that a knowledge of thorough bass shall be the indispensible requisite in a comic singer; that clowns and chambermaids will sputter out their nonsense in fugues, and dying lovers warble their distress in counterpoint.</NOTE> Indeed, were I to enumerate all the tricks of these profound theorists, it would take up a larger portion of time and pains than I am willing to allow so unprofitable a subject. As far, however, as it conduces to the point I wish to carry, I shall in my free way go a little further, regardless how they may feel, so I but serve the public cause. Some of these—and, for a man of such admirable genius, it is a pity justice obliges me to say one of them is HAYDN—give you an idea of a rope-dancer, who, though you cannot too much admire how prettily he frisks and jumps about, keeps you in a constant state of terror and anxiety for fear he should break his neck. If this country had produced nine HOOKS, and they had divided among them the manuscript of HAYDN's compositions—or, indeed, were to work upon them now they are published, which is just as fair play as times go—there would be materials enough to furnish each a musical reputation:—and yet, is there a fair, well-wrought-up movement in his whole works? Do they consist of any thing more than strong effusions of genius turned into frenzy, and labouring as ineffectually to be heard as a flute in a belfry, or equity in a court of justice? In short, pursue every thing that is cold, unnatural, complex, and dry, and it is the road to the altar of APOLLO—if <HI>discord</HI> be the high priest: But I rather think—like the usurper who, as he worshipped at the shrine of folly, fondly thought he knelt in the temple of fame—they will find imagination, sensibility, and ex∣pression are as necessary requisites to the accomplishment of a perfect mu∣sician, as courage, clemency and humanity are to make up the true renown of an hero. In short, teach a child to walk upon his hands that he may
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
be more expert with his feet—let him play with fire to endure the smart if he chance to be burnt—instruct him in <HI>algebra</HI> to teach him <HI>multiplication</HI>—or do ought but take the plain, easy, natural course of setting about any thing, and you shall have an idea of the shallow, miserable resources of these empty men, to hide the sterility of their intellects; which, after all, is like the goose that thrust its head in the hedge to conceal itself—forgetting that its body was ex∣posed. But if they are so reprehensible while they stick to straight forward thrumming as many notes at a time as they have fingers—which they would if they had as many as BRIAREUS—what shall we say when we go with them into chromatics! Dr. WAINWRIGHT is known to have rejected every thing natural, maintaining that a <HI>tone,</HI> by a man of ingenuity, might be softened into as many shades as a <HI>colour!</HI> Here is glorious ground work for the theo∣rist! Who knows but the full tone, which is now only divided, may one day or other be so subdivided as to form a <HI>new</HI> system of theory—in which case a man would find it as tedious to go from one end of the gamut to the other, as it was formerly to take a journey from YORK to LONDON. If it should—the utmost that can be said about it is, that a learned musician, like a greyhound, jumps over hedges and ditches at the risk of his hide—while the child of nature, like a horse, jogs on safely, contenting himself with the turnpike road. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nature ever was above art,"</Q> and will be ages after I have the power—for so long shall I have the inclination—to subscribe myself</P>

<P>MY account of places, manners, &amp;c. is of a long standing—therefore I may as well give you time to digest my arguments con∣cerning music, and clear my ground as far as I have gone—as gardeners dig in the old cabbage stalks to make the surface of the bed the fairer on which they are preparing to plant a new crop. Indeed I have generally spoken of every place, but I would willingly leave nothing undone. To set about this completely, I believe I must go back as far as BIRMIGNHAM, the ingenuity and populousness of which place are wonderful. The increase of buildings, both for convenience and pleasure, has extended the place to a space at least as large again as when I knew it twenty-five years ago. The first, however, is as praise worthy as the last is ridiculous. Not that I would not have men enjoy the money they have earned—let it be procured through whatever me∣dium it honestly may—but the country houses of the BIRMINGHAMITES are embellished to as little purpose as a chimney-sweeper washes his face, and as awkwardly as a Guinea-pig imitates a squirrel. As to their manners, I am sure they are not <HI>good</HI> ones. A tenacious man must infallibly, in BIR∣MINGHAM, be affronted ten times a day:—for even if you go to <HI>buy</HI> any thing, it is fifty to one if you receive a civil answer:—and this rudeness ex∣tends
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
to the most opulent among them. A man who is said to possess two hundred thousand pounds used me with a style of incivility that would have disgraced a porter in Thames-street; and I called upon another man of the first consequence there, whom I could not single out from the journeymen blacksmiths that surrounded him. Indeed master and servant is confounded among them, for each leads the same life, works as hard, drinks as much fat ale, and undergoes as much drudgery as the other; nor do I see that one has more felicity in counting useless guineas, than the other in carding buttons. I really speak here without acrimony, and it may be seen by this: I had no better success at WOLVERHAMPTON than at BIRMINGHAM, and yet there I found civility not incompatible with trade.</P>
<P>I have been trying what to say more of LICHFIELD, but can find no∣thing—unless I were to go over the old ground of the massacre of DIOCLE∣SIAN—in which a thousand christians were martyred, and their bodies ex∣posed to wild beasts. For this cruel event it seems to have mourned ever since; for it is so melancholy, that one would wonder Miss SEWARD could write verses that have so many charms for the reviewers, in a place appa∣rently calculated to engender only the vapours; but, indeed, those gentle∣men in general seem to have a peculiar knack of speaking <HI>eloquently</HI> upon <HI>dull subjects.</HI></P>
<P>I shall say nothing to the antiquity of DERBY, but only mention it as a clean, pretty-looking, genteel town, where I sincerely believe the in∣habitants want neither spirit nor taste. As to what happened to me, it was one of those strokes—a <HI>traverse</HI>—that have attended me all my life, and which, like the mistake of a figure in the solution of a mathematical prob∣lem, in proportion as you expect to come home to your point, carries you out of your way.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193"/>NOTTINGHAM, as I have before said, has something charming in its situation; the castle has a beautifully romantic effect, and the <HI>Trent</HI> breaks the country near it in a most delightful and picturesque manner. Indeed I know not, at times, whether the mind does not as strongly pant for objects that derive their grandeur from simplicity, as for those surprising natural effects which as it were pain and giddy the senses, till sober reality is lost in intoxicated imagination.</P>
<P>NEWARK is something in the style of DERBY. I do not think the in∣habitants are so rich, but they do not want spirit. NEWARK is a very desirable place for persons of small fortune to settle at. House rent is reason∣able; and the corporation being, for the size of the place, rich—paving, high∣ways, public building, and repairs, maintaining the poor, and many other necessary but heavy charges are defrayed without assessing the inhabitants; and yet, they are better paid than in any other town of its standing that I have seen. The <HI>town-hall</HI> and the <HI>poor-house</HI> are, in <HI>proportion,</HI> I believe I may venture to say the best in ENGLAND.</P>
<P>If it be true that LINCOLN formerly contained fifty two parish churches and one thousand and seventy one houses of entertainment, it is certainly very much fallen into decay. The situation from the hill is wonderful, and the clergy, who are astonishingly numerous there, seem to have got on as high a <HI>pinnacle</HI> as they can, with a view, I hope, to evince how idle to them are all the vain pomp and glory of this world. I am not honoured with the know∣ledge of these gentlemen, nor had I the least conversation with any except Dr. KAYE, who, though a certain newspaper is extremely angry that he should be praised at the expence of the rest of the clergy, has in the opinion of many others, as well as myself, set an example in the business of the <HI>tithe child,</HI> that we shall stand very little chance of seeing imitated. The manners of LINCOLN seem to be a constant internal enmity, and a remark∣able shyness to strangers. Their musical taste I have given an instance of.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="194"/>HULL, originally a small fishing village, is now a very considerable sea port; and, lying between YARMOUTH and NEWCASTLE, is remarkably con∣venient either for homeward or outward bound ships. The increase of their commerce is apparent in the new dock already made, and that lately applied for to parliament. Round the dock is formed a kind of crescent, consisting of magnificent houses, which form an appearance of extraordinary novelty, by being the boundary of one of the dirtiest places in the kingdom. On the opposite side of the dock is a row of warehouses, to a prodigious extent, very spacious, and admirably well stored. As to their taste, I do not think they relished much of my entertainment, except <HI>Grog</HI>; and for their manners—being all seamen—they are blunt, honest, and careless. I must not forget to mention the kind attention of Mr. MARLEY, whom I should have been happy to have know better, that I might have spoken of his professional merit with the same certainty as that of BOYTON and CLEMENTSHAW. It is universally allowed to be very brilliant, and I am sure, if it bear any proportion to his kind and obliging private conduct, his friends—who are a very large num∣ber—cannot speak too highly of it. Nor will I neglect to record the kind∣ness of poor HUDSON—how no more—who died like the wife of BONIFACE—but in this life we have need of CORDIALS—so peace to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poor HUDSON puts me in mind of a brother-in-law of GRIFFIN, the bookseller, who was kill∣ing himself by drinking. A friend of his, as he was creeping along one day, asked him how he did. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Very bad indeed,'</Q> anwered he. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sorry for it"</Q>—said the friend—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what do you take?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Every thing,'</Q> said the sick man—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>hot brandy,</HI> and <HI>cold brandy—hot gin,</HI> and <HI>cold gin</HI>—but none of it does me any good.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>As this subject is rather dry, I shall now speak alternately of music and places, till I have fairly brought up my account as far as my second visit to LEEDS—after which I shall open a new field, and expatiate largely on a vari∣ety of public subjects. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THEORY in music, and the empty nonsense of its professors being the subject of my last letter—in which I think I have plainly shewn that a single air, with simplicity for its object and expression for its effect, is infinitely preferable to the most laboured production that can be worked up mechanically—I shall proceed to remark on the pernicious effects of following a doctrine so very false and delusive, and point out that it has step by step perverted and vitiated the English taste. First of all, <HI>theorists</HI> content themselves—indeed they want invention to do otherwise—with very indifferent, and in general <HI>trite</HI> melodies. Thus, having acquired great repu∣tation by the pomp annexed to their being professed musicians, their music is listened to, and at length liked, upon the principle of a man's eating biscuit at sea because he can get no bread. The human mind is so prone to the re∣ception of pleasure, that it very often takes it upon credit, and is swindled into a belief of the reality of what upon examination turns out to be only counterfeit. Thus the manly, and I will venture to say correct taste of the English, which admired the works of PURCELL, ARNE, and BOYCE—and surely they have among them some of the sweetest melodies that ever spoke
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
to the heart—is now dwindled into an admiration of the grossest insipidity. It should seem as if music had expired with the singers who uttered it, and that LEVERIDGE and BEARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not mean to say BEARD is literally no more—I am informed he possesses, at this moment, all his faculties in full vigour: may he long do so. I was very young when Mr. BEARD knew me, and he must remember, through the ersuasion of others, he treated me very unhandsomely; but I acquit him of all intention to do so, and take this public opportunity of assuring him that I never had of any man a higher opinion, nor for any a greater value.</NOTE> having given way to the use of effeminacy and falcetto, the style should sink in proportion: otherwise, how can it be ac∣counted for that the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hark forwards"</Q> of the present day should be ten times more in circulation than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With horns and with hounds,"</Q> or <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The early horn?"</Q> Has not a single insipid song, called the <HI>Mansion of peace,</HI> brought six times the profit to the composer that the whole <HI>Chaplet</HI> did to BOYCE?—though to mention the comparative merits would be like talking of a Scotch bank note and the riches of the treasury. Nothing in nature can be more beautifully delicious than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vain is every fond endeavour"</Q> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What med'cine can soften the bosom's keen smart?"</Q>. Pshaw, what are these trifles, says a theorist, to a <HI>fugue?</HI> To which I answer—a great deal; for they can make only the <HI>fugue,</HI> whereas Dr. BOYCE could make BOTH. But to enumerate other instances. Is it not true that, at this moment, were the beauties of ARNE collected together, headed by all the melody, sweetness, spirit, character, and expression in <HI>Comus</HI>; the charming, peculiarly natural airs to which he so enchantingly set the Songs of SHAKESPEAR—which task I will venture to say no man in the world could have executed equal to ARNE—and made up of those innumerable charms which pervade his volu∣minous works, would they not be all neglected for that miserable, unmeaning imitation of <HI>La virginella,</HI> and twenty other things—called <HI>Ma cher ami?</HI> And to give yet a stronger proof: Were all PURCELL's duettos brought forth—who had, beyond all question, a more vigorous mind than HANDEL—were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let CESAR and URANIA live"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To arms"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As I saw fair CLORA"</Q>—and in short all those admirable compositions which so honourably mark the
<PB N="190" REF="197" MS="y"/>
strength of English genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CORELLI is said to have visited ENGLAND on purpose to see PURCELL, but hearing, at ROCHES∣TER, of his death, he did not even visit the CAPITAL, but returned, saying—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There can be nothing worthy my curiosity since PURCELL is dead."</Q></NOTE>—would they not be despised for that most execra∣ble of all apologies for MUSIC, the <HI>Duetto</HI> sung by Mr. KELLY and Mrs. CROUCH?</P>
<P>I beg I may not be understood to mean, by what I have here advanced, that the compilers of such contemptible stuff are the <HI>theorists</HI> of whom I have spoken above. These are only the dabblers, who take advantage of the bad taste of the times. But to come more closely to the point, and satisfy every enquirer what are the steps which have caused this gradual declension in the public taste? I answer, in great measure, a blind predilection for the works of HANDEL, and an indiscriminate avidity for German compositions. What! shall any man dare to make so bold a declaration? I do—but let me have fair play. HANDEL was a composer of wonderful abilities; his conception was strong, his imagination immense, his knowledge of music, as a science, clear and profound—and those masterly combinations of sounds which make up many of his chorusses abundantly prove it; but, like hounds led on by the huntsman on a false scent, he is admired in ENGLAND for his very errors.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">HANDEL has been frequently compared to SHAKESPEARE, though nothing can be upon more opposite grounds than the admiration which has been respectively paid them. SHAKESPEARE has been always praised for his genius, and HANDEL for his judgment. He who wished so much of the writings of SHAKESPEARE obliterated, would, I fancy, have been at a loss where to have laid his finger: whereas, it were very easy to point out which half of HANDEL's works might be consigned to oblivion, and yet leave all that is pleasing in his compositions behind.</NOTE> When I say errors I do not speak as to his knowledge as a musician, but to his taste as a man of genius. These errors in HANDEL relate to ex∣pression, which was sometimes false, like tinsel in poetry; sometimes ridi∣culous, like bombast; often begun upon a principle which sunk in the end to
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
absurdity—making exactly the bathos; and very frequently indeed sound without either meaning or expression, answering exactly to nonsense verses.</P>
<P>I believe it will be allowed me that the parts of any thing which offers itself to human observation are complete only as they regard the whole. In music no man ever did or will greatly succeed who takes up <HI>particular</HI> instead of <HI>general</HI> expression. HANDEL was a slave to this—but to adduce my proofs.</P>
<P>His false expression was this: If the subject happened to be joy, he toO frequently invetend something <HI>sprightly</HI>—without considering <HI>time, place,</HI> or <HI>occasion</HI>; as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Rejoice oh daughter of SION"</Q>—which surely should convey a holy joy, expressive of religious, soul-felt rapture; instead of which, this song was first a <HI>jig,</HI> and afterwards a <HI>hornpipe.</HI> Another instance occurs in <HI>Judas Maccabeus</HI>—in the song <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let honour with desert be crown'd".</Q> The word trumpet here happening to be introduced, he has taken such an <HI>advan∣tage</HI> of it that the whole song seems as if it was set to display the effect of the trumpet, in a key which does not belong to it, and where of course it has the <HI>worst effect</HI> that can be imagined; and as if this was not enough, the words seem to be written as a burlesque on the music; for they run thus—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The trumpet ne'er in vain should sound."</Q> I have heard this song praised as the best in all his works.</P>
<P>The second instance which I call ridiculous, or bombast, is a worse fault than the other—and yet it occurs as frequently. Who can listen to such a pantomime tune as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The land brought forth frogs,"</Q> and call it any thing but burlesque?—and yet this is a popular favourite. I heard a man in the gallery say, while the chorus was performing which begins <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And he spake the word, and there came all manner of flies and lice in all their quarters"</Q>—that he itched from head to foot. Would the gentleman have been obliged to HANDEL for giving him this sensation if he had lived in the days of JAMES I. who is said to have prohibited scratching? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THAIS led the way"</Q>
<PB N="192" REF="199"/>
and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The king seized a flambeau"</Q> are again of this complexion—for they both convey a kind of drunken gaiety, and give you more the idea of their going up stairs to bed together than to set the Persepolis on fire.</P>
<P>As to the bathos, it occurs in such instances as the chorus in the <HI>Messiah</HI> beginning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All we like sheep are gone astray"</Q>—which profanes the words it should express, and might with great propriety be put into the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Peep behind the curtain"</Q>—where the story of ORPHEUS is burlesqued. The sheep cer∣tainly dance and frisk about very curiously, and run away from each other; but, unfortunately conceiving himself under a musical necessity of making a close in the line <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have turned every one to his <HI>own way,</HI>"</Q> he brings them all back, and they finish by huddling lovingly together. Query, whe∣ther so great a man as HANDEL might not with impunity have invented some new species of inverted counterpoint that might have finished the chorus with their all baaing to one another at a distance. But I am getting into length, and therefore shall, in imitation of HUDIBRAS, break of in the middle. I will resume the subject, however, after the next letter, till when, and at all times, I am,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEVERLEY is said to be one of the prettiest towns in ENGLAND. To this I cannot wholly agree. It is a snug decent town; has a spacious market place; and its minster—which is very ancient, and was formerly a sanctuary to bankrupts and criminals—is yet a very hand∣some church; but I think it inferior to many towns in Yorkshire as to beauty, consequence, or situation. The inhabitants, however, appear to be independent; and, by mixing socially together, promote very pleasantly all that is necessary or agreeable towards forming a friendly and comfortable neighbourhood. This town has many advantageous privileges, among which is their being exempt from toll and custom.</P>
<P>I know not what to say of YORK, except that it fell infinitely below my expectations in every point of view. I expected to see a large, oppu∣lent, populous place—second to nothing in ENGLAND but LONDON—instead of which, except the <HI>church</HI> and the <HI>gaol,</HI> there is no one object that con∣veys an idea of superiority to the other towns around it. It is not near so populous as LEEDS, nor half so much frequented. Talking to a gentle∣man at LEEDS, I told him YORK put me in mind of a man in conversation,
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
who, though rich in volubility, finished as he began—having impressed no one with either truth or reason in his argument; whereas LEEDS put in only a word now and then, but always to the purpose. YORK is, <HI>in proportion,</HI> the poorest place in the whole county of which it is the capital. Its situation being in the very center of all the great north roads, which are now very fine, and astonishingly frequented, it is continually <HI>busy,</HI> without having <HI>any thing to do</HI>; and though constantly <HI>crammed,</HI> thinly <HI>inhabited.</HI> The inns alone seem to thrive there. In short, it has many churches and but little <HI>devotion; fine clothes</HI> and <HI>spare purses</HI>; a <HI>magnificent prison</HI> always <HI>full</HI>; and a <HI>theatre royal</HI> where they perform <HI>at a constant loss.</HI> As a proof of their musical taste, they think Mr. KELLY and Mrs. CROUCH's <HI>duetto</HI> comprizes all the excellence of all the masters that ever bowed at the shrine of APOLLO. It must be re∣membered I have one exception to these general rules—and I believe when I say I have <HI>but one,</HI> I write as strong a satire as words are capable of conveying.</P>
<P>MALTON is a shabby town apparently in every respect—I will therefore leave it, and go on to SCARBOROUGH, which is one of the prettiest seaports I have seen. Every body knows it is maintained upon the principle of BATH. One thing, however, surprized me; though I was cautioned against the un∣reasonableness of their charges, I found them so much the reverse, that I paid less for better things than at any place on that side the HUMBER.</P>
<P>WAKEFIELD I confess is one of my favourite places. There is such a sprightly cleanliness about it, that the inhabitants seem as if they were born for the real purposes of life. The village of HEATH, near it, is one of the sweetest spots for neatness and simplicity that imagination can form. The vicinity of WAKEFIELD is filled with opulent and respectable inhabitants, all of whom inherit or have accumulated fortunes by trade. Their manners appear to be simple and unaffected; their conversation is polished, and in their musical pursuits they go my way to work, and praise every thing that pleases them upon reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="202"/>DONCASTER has all the neatness of a quaker, and on a first view be∣gets very strongly your sober admiration; but when you come to consider that they have no soul, no taste, no characteristic but insipidity—after having admired the <HI>church,</HI> the <HI>mansion house,</HI> and the <HI>guildhall</HI>—you wish yourself any where but at DONCASTER.</P>
<P>As to the roads to all those different places, there are now no bad ones but what are necessarily so through situation and soil, and near manufacturing towns, where time can be more valuably employed than in mending roads—though one would think that work would contribute to their convenience, since the goods must be <HI>carried</HI> after they are <HI>made.</HI> Thus, almost every where in <HI>swampy</HI> LINCOLNSHIRE the roads are generally very disagreeable, es∣pecially in winter; and great part of DERBYSHIRE, on account of the hills, render your journeys unpleasant, and not always very safe. I must not for∣get, in particular, to mention that the nine miles from WAKEFIELD to LEEDS is so scandalously neglected, that even in a post-chaise, and in the middle of the day, you expect every moment to be overturned.</P>
<P>Having now spoken of all those places to which I shall not find it neces∣sary to return, except perhaps for some general observations, I shall go on from LEEDS to HALIFAX, where I was advised to perform a night or two previous to my touching at MANCHESTER. When I came there, however, they had a company of players, and were otherwise so full of amusements, that after sitting down a few days, and writing a part of this TOUR, I went on to MANCHESTER—promising, if I could make it convenient, to call on my return.</P>
<P>On my arrival at MANCHESTER, I not only found that the theatre was open, but that Mr. ASTLEY was figuring away in great style with his <HI>horse∣manship,</HI> to which amusement I have the same aversion—and perhaps for better reasons—that some men have to a CAT. I therefore enclosed a letter
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
I had brought with me to an opulent gentleman—informed him I would take another opportunity to pay him my personal respects—and posted away to LIVERPOOL.</P>
<P>As my success at this place, and the subjects on which it must necessa∣rily induce me to speak, will make a most essential and interesting part of this work, I shall introduce them as conspicuously as possible in the following letter but one; and, in the interim, supply the next with the remainder of my argument respecting HANDEL and German music, which ideas I threw loosely on paper at HALIFAX, which is said to be the most musical spot for its size in the kingdom:—for there Mrs. BATES received her musical education—there Mr. BATES has so planted a veneration for the works of HANDEL, that chil∣dren lisp <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For unto us a child is born,"</Q> and cloth-makers, as they sweat under their loads in the cloth-hall, roar out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For his yoke is easy and his burden is light."</Q> I have been assured, for a fact, that more than one man in HALIFAX can take any part in the chorusses of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and go regu∣larly through the whole oratorio by heart; and, indeed, the facility with which the common people join together throughout the greatest part of YORK∣SHIRE and LANCASHIRE, in every species of choral music, is truly astonish∣ing.</P>
<P>This kind of cursory work is like posting the day-book into the ledger; by and by we shall take out the different articles, and come to a general account.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE instances of HANDEL's total neglect of ex∣pression occur much more frequently than any of his other faults. How many of his oratorio songs consist of a complex accompaniment—ingeniously worked up indeed, but without the smallest relation to the subject of the words—while the voice drawls out an unmeaning train of sounds, destitute of melody, or any power of conveying a pleasing sensation. Sometimes in these songs, that the voice may have no reason to complain of having less to do than the instru∣ments—for in this species of music every thing is upon a footing—it floats away upon a long division, and often such a one as no voice upon earth can execute. This is surely the very reverse of what <HI>vocal music</HI> ought to be, where every thing manifestly should be subordinate to the <HI>voice</HI>; and, even in a hautboy song, or any other where a particular instrument may have an <HI>obligato</HI> accompaniment, the voice ought to be every where <HI>assisted,</HI> but no where <HI>eclipsed.</HI></P>
<P>Vocal MUSIC is clearly the essence of whatever can render sound delec∣table; that which is simplest and most expressive is the best vocal MUSIC; and, I will add, that a song perfect in all its qualities is the utmost height of
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
excellence to which MUSIC can arrive. This position I shall hereafter more fully go into, as I mean to leave what I advance on this subject unanswerable.</P>
<P>In solo songs—where one point of expression should be observed, where a single, unembarrassed subject should be well <HI>begun, followed,</HI> and <HI>finished</HI>—HANDEL very often falls below mediocrity. This proves that he is a better <HI>instrumental</HI> than a <HI>vocal</HI> composer; for in the major part of his chorusses where the expression need not so much depend on the voice—for there it acts only as a kind of instrument to fill the parts—he is much more happy; and in his other works, where the voice has no share at all, he is incom∣parably greater than any where. Who can deny this when they recollect the minuet in Ariadne? There is not a superfluous note in it, and being made up of one simple, and yet grand, object—regularly pursued, and greatly worked up—nothing in MUSIC, for what it is, can exceed it. To which if you call in the other minuets, together with the marches and gavottes which make up the last movements of his overtures, the balance will be consider∣ably in favour of my argument. And yet, while we whistle all these with the greatest facility, without considering to whom we owe this satisfaction, we get crowded at the abbey—to the tune of <HI>two guineas</HI>—to be <HI>stunned</HI> with the <HI>abstrusest</HI> of his works, which, if the heart has any thing to do with MUSIC, is the <HI>worst.</HI></P>
<P>To prove this, let me ask any man in his senses, not a mere <HI>theorist,</HI> if he ever felt so much real pleasure in hearing <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The horse and his rider,"</Q> as in the last movement of his famous coronation anthem of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God save the king?"</Q> where there is scarcely a discord that might not be admitted, without wounding simplicity, into the most familiar song. After a tedious and tiresome reiteration of discords, placed unnecessarily in every point of view, how are we charmed in the <HI>Messiah</HI> with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth!"</Q> Why? Because it is full of grandeur and simplicity. The soul is struck with the sublime greatness and beauty of the expression, and we feel the DEITY <HI>in our hearts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="206"/>Thus I think I have proved my position without injuring the reputa∣tion of HANDEL. He his certainly left behind him some wonderful MUSIC, but it cannot be denied that this <HI>ore</HI> is plentifully surrounded with <HI>dross.</HI>—Let us therefore—which would be infinitely more to his honour—take his MUSIC upon credit of our own feelings, and not blindly and implicitly from those who, living in a labyrinth, wonder how any one should prefer a direct road.</P>
<P>As to the other <HI>Germans</HI>—as they have no <HI>opera,</HI> so they import no vocal MUSIC; and thus by torturing sounds into new positions, to make old ideas wear a novel shape, <HI>difficulty</HI> is the only characteristic of their composi∣tions; and by this means the ear gets accustomed <HI>not</HI> to what <HI>pleases</HI> in MUSIC, but to what <HI>surprizes.</HI> I will venture to say <HI>solos</HI> and <HI>solo concertos</HI> have done but little good to the cause of MUSIC. LA MOTTE's great merit was to figure away in <HI>alt,</HI> till at last, approaching to the bridge, he played himself, as it were, out of sight. The <HI>dexterity</HI> was <HI>wonderful,</HI> but for heaven's sake where was the <HI>pleasure?</HI> This is a solid fact—and to prove it, let me ask how came GIARDINI and BARTHELEMON constantly to call in <HI>Lango Lee, The Dargle,</HI> &amp;c. to help out their concertos.</P>
<P>The human mind cannot pay proper attention but to one object at a time. ZOFFANI's admirable portrait of the gallery of FLORENCE—at which one might look a month and not discover half the beauties—though it con∣tains more grand objects than any twenty pictures that ever were painted, has the meanest <HI>tout ensemble</HI> that can be imagined. It is a chaos of exquisitely charming objects, which cannot be properly distinguished, because one con∣founds the effect of the other. There is a soberness in real pleasure that can∣not bear the impertinence of tickling and teazing. In architecture it is the same. Mr. WOODFALL may remember, as he and I were near each other in HENRY <HI>the seventh's</HI> chapel, to see the ceremony of installing the knights of the Bath, he took notice of the wonderful <HI>labour</HI> that had been bestowed
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
in ornamenting that place; that there was such a variety, and the parts were so minute, that the eye was at a loss where to fix. I said if this was the case, he must confess it was <HI>labour in vain:</HI>—and the observation holds good in every thing that appeals to the senses. And, as to MUSIC, if a man in∣vent a tolerable melody, and prevent its effect by complex accompaniment, he will have no better success than the Irish painter who, undertaking the portrait of a gentleman going a shooting, hid the figure behind a large tree, for fear he should frighten the partridges.</P>
<P>I understand there has been already much curiosity concerning what I can possibly mean in my proposal by an exposition of <HI>musical quackery</HI>—by the time the crotchet-mongers shall have read this letter they may perhaps smell out what I am diving at. I have yet, however, spoken only of impositions on the senses; I mean hereafter to mention, under the article of teaching, something concerning designs on the pocket. I shall first, however, place the different merits of dead composers side by side, in which task I have no doubt but I shall prove to the satisfaction of every reasonable man that had not ARNE all his life been discouraged, and HANDEL considered as another APOLLO, the fame of the ENGLISHMAN would have exceeded that of the GERMAN. This will nearly involve all that it will be necessary for me to say—and, without mentioning a single name, throw the merit, or the want of it, if you will, of many living composers into that point of view in which it is but common justice to have it seen. Then, as the business of teaching is a serious evil, I shall lay it open as bare as possible, and give a receipt to heal the wound; after which, if the public chuse to be gulled with it, no teach∣ing tickets ought to pass between masters and scholars without a stamp, that thus <HI>musical quacks</HI> may be at once upon the footing of <HI>physical</HI> ones. Strange, says SWIFT, so much difference should be 'twixt tweedledum and tweedledee. The world is more imposed on by trifles than is generally imagined. It is a trifle to be sure—but however no imposition—to say I am truly yours,</P>

<L>"<HI>If England to herself do prove but true.</HI>"</L></Q>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO LIVERPOOL I went, without the smallest re∣commendation, except indeed a letter to Mr. PYE, who keeps a music ware∣house there, and to whose attention and indefatigable pains to oblige and ac∣commodate me, I confess myself greatly indebted. The difficulty I had to get at the <HI>Mayor,</HI> and the doubtful reception I at first met with, had at one mo∣ment nearly worked me up to a resolution of returning from thence as I went. On my first performance, however, which was attended by about thirty-five people, and greatly relished, several gentlemen made strenuous application to me to repeat it, and proposed a better room for the purpose. The next evening I had a very handsome audience, on the third a better still, and on the fourth—though it was christmas eve, and a concert night—I had the very best room I have experienced, at any place, since I first began my rambles. Having done very handsomely at LIVERPOOL in relation to my entertain∣ment, and mustered so many more names to my subscription than at any other place except LONDON, it may be suspected, by the uncandid, that I am induced on this account alone to speak well of that truly spirited place. Those, however, who think liberally, and who, by the way, are of the only description I care three-pence about obliging, will see—as I have every where
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
been just—that I give to LIVERPOOL, as I do to BIRMINGHAM only its due.</P>
<P>Throughout life it holds good, as an infallible maxim, that the mind will be influenced by its employment. <HI>Able financiers</HI> have seldom, in any country, been <HI>great ministers</HI>; because their measures have been constantly clogged by the cold regularity of mere calculation. Retired tradesmen live still in the misery of fearing to spend a superfluous penny; but merchants, though expert at every qualification for the accumulation of profit, are in their minds, like their traffic, extensive and expanded. It is astonishing to witness the difference between a <HI>counting house</HI> and a <HI>counter.</HI> For my part, I look upon merchants to be the first of characters, and an English one to be the first of merchants. VOLTAIRE having drawn a paralleled view of different distinctions among men, after mentioning the good sense of the English, in intermarrying their nobility with commercial characters, goes on, and says—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After all, it were worth while to consider which is the more truly noble, he who knows to a moment when the king rises, or goes to sleep, or—something else—or he who trades to every part of the globe, thereby con∣tributing to the comfort and convenience of human nature."</Q></P>
<P>Nothing shews an object so well as a contrast; therefore, as I am not yet come to MANCHESTER and NEWCASTLE, where at one place they mea∣sure <HI>serret</HI> by the <HI>yard,</HI> and at the other <HI>coals</HI> by the <HI>bushel,</HI> I cannot to my satisfaction dwell on LIVERPOOL. On my return to that place I shall be more competent to display that open-hearted liberality which, in so short a time, I might only have <HI>imagined</HI> they possess. But my observation cannot but be well founded, as they have less of hypocrisy than any set of people I ever met with in my life.</P>
<P>A compact with any part of the public is with me a very serious thing; therefore—though I was offered very handsomely to stay—I left LIVERPOOL,
<PB N="203" REF="210" MS="y"/>
and returned to HALIFAX—where my advertisements stood for Thursday the twenty-seventh.</P>
<P>On christmas-day, therefore, I left LIVERPOOL for MANCHESTER, and the following day—after being nearly lost in the snow, near ROCHDALE—arrived at HALIFAX. I think it would be doing injustice to so well known a character, if I were to omit mentioning that in the diligence from LIVER∣POOL to MANCHESTER I was accompanied by Mr. ASTLEY, who at that time was returning from LIVERPOOL, after having taken the town. From eight o'clock in the morning till five in the afternoon—for so long is that dili∣gence crawling thirty-six miles—I am sure he did not cease, I will not say <HI>talking,</HI> but BAWLING; for this gentleman being eternally on his hobby-horse, always fancies he is holding conversation with Mr. MERRYMAN. In the course of this curious rant, he was so kind as to oblige me with his idea of improving the theatres, the courts, the parliament, and the nation. He wished he had known what I was about, he would have given me such hints for my entertainment! In short, if I would but have listened to him, I should have had new rules for making music, writing, singing, playing, and speaking English. <Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> hallowed he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there is no talking to any of you. Now, there, about law—LORD THURLOW told me in my riding house—but that's no matter. There now you see, there's that there PAL∣MER, if I had a mind I would have shewed him a trick that would have laid them all flat on their backs. For you see—to be sure I knows nothing about <HI>sense,</HI> but I knows <HI>law</HI>; for I cast SIR JOSEPH MAWBY, and I have had several <HI>suits,</HI> and I have been twice <HI>took up</HI>; but you see nobody won't be ruled by me, so I goes on by myself—and what does I do? Why I cuts and contrives. Why where will you find such another <HI>monooverer?</HI>—learnt it in the army—under my particular friend and acquaintance GE∣NERAL ELLIOT. Why don't you see what I am about now? I thinks our licences will carry us through—but if they should not you know—I am at a heavy charge—so you see I goes about and gets the profit of a season
<PB N="204" REF="211" MS="y"/>
before the season comes."</Q> And good generalship it has turned out, for I am credibly informed—at BIRMINGHAM, MANCHESTER, and LIVERPOOL—he cleared nearly two thousand pounds.</P>
<P>While I was at LIVERPOOL the business or the <HI>slave trade</HI> began to be agitated, and out of curiosity I learned some particulars concerning it. These, however, I shall defer till I mention what I gathered afterwards on that sub∣ject at MANCHESTER, and add the rejoinder of the people of LIVERPOOL, on my second visit to that place.</P>
<P>Whether any thing be done in this important business or not, the na∣tional character of the English will derive an additional lustre from the hu∣mane endeavours that have been exerted to annihilate a traffic which those who have petitioned against it think cruel and oppressive. Perhaps an investiga∣tion of the abuses under the line may lead to an exposition and an amend∣ment of those at home. If so, MANCHESTER will have unwittingly begun a reform of more magnitude than they were aware of, and become the for∣tuitous perfecter of a constitution which wants only to be purged of <HI>humours,</HI> contracted by—<HI>too much health</HI>:—which performed, it cannot be rendered more pure than the sincerity with which I profess myself</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my business at present to speak of my success at HALIFAX, and my return from thence to SHEFFIELD, which MOUN∣TAIN (for I love to use <HI>hackneyed</HI> expressions to <HI>mediocre</HI> subjects, notwith∣standing LORD CHESTERFIELD to his son reprobates them as vulgar, that he may keep them to himself I suppose, for nobody has more) brought forth <HI>A MOUSE.</HI> But first for HALIFAX.</P>
<P>I had two nights at this place, and considering the inhabitants of the <HI>neighbourhood</HI>—for this black, dismal town has <HI>in it</HI> very few people of any consequence—were locked up in their houses by the frost and snow, they turned out decent, but that was all. My audience, and indeed all HALIFAX and its environs, men, women, and children, being musical, and, as some think, squall in tune—just as the negroes swim—as soon as they are born, my performance was <HI>critically</HI> attended to, but I am afraid not much liked.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MANZOLI and GUARDUCCI were competitors in ITALY; the public were to determine which sung best;—MANZOLI had the voice of the <HI>spectators</HI> and GUARDUCCI of the <HI>musicians</HI>;—what was the consequence? MANZOLI made a fortune, and GUARDUCCI did nothing.</NOTE> I am, however, not very sorry this circumstance occurred, for it gives me
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
an opportunity, which will be more strongly confirmed when I get to MANCHESTER, of noticing that the <HI>conoscenti</HI> ever receive the least pleasure, and, in fact, are the least infallible. I sincerely believe, however, having paused on the second night, and considered whether it was right to be pleased or not, they would have attended with more satisfaction a third.—While they were deliberating, however, I was gone; for having received a letter from Mr. GALES, who was so kind to make the necessary enquiries concerning the entertainment, I got away to SHEFFIELD, on Monday De∣cember the thirty-first.</P>
<P>Of Mr. GALES I scarcely know how to speak. He is the printer of this work: if, therefore, I should use slight language, it will look like a compact between us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GARRICK and LACY had this compact between them—whatever one praised the other abused.—When I made my article for seven years, immediately after the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> GARRICK was for giving me a <HI>carte blanche,</HI> and LACY for beating me down in every thing.—They so well carried their point by this—GARRICK having previously promised me that whatever I consented to through LACY's whims, he would, through his own generosity, amply make up to me—that I agreed to receive seven pounds a week for what was worth more than double that sum. LACY having always had a regard for me, I could not help, a few days afterwards, telling him that he had been very hard on me in the business of the agreement.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What the devil would you have,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'twas DAVID's doings—he prompt∣ed me."</Q></NOTE> and if I am lavish in my praises of him, some may be apt to quote from SHAKESPEARE, and say <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a little flattery sometimes does well."</Q> I should therefore feel myself awkwardly situated but for one circumstance, which has <HI>major,</HI> MINOR, and CONCLUSION in its favour, as <HI>clearly</HI> as any problem in EUCLID. <HI>Before</HI> I ever saw Mr. GALES I had re∣ceived numberless civilities at the hands of different <HI>printers,</HI> from many of whom I have had offers to print my TOUR—<HI>after</HI> I knew Mr. GALES, I pre∣ferred him to all the printers I had seen. Thus I am enabled, by a self-evi∣dent circumstance, to express my sentiments as strongly as by trying my hand at a studied panegyrick; which had I done in the sort of style my wishes led me to, I should have been obliged to have enjoined Mr. GALES's foreman
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
to have printed it unknown to his master; for so diffident is he of his own worth, that I should never have prevailed on him to let that issue from the press which would have been as great a credit to the public as any thing that ever did or ever will pass through it. Another circumstance will by and by oblige me to speak in Mr. GALES's favour in spite of his teeth. Among my general subjects, it will be very proper to take up newspapers, in which case it would be very <HI>improper</HI> not to mention the <HI>Sheffield Register</HI> with that de∣gree of praise it deserves.</P>
<P>My <HI>first</HI> night at SHEFFIELD, notwithstanding I had beat about almost expressly for ten weeks, with a view of properly paying them a visit, was a very bad one; and feeling myself a little let down, I should not have an∣nounced a second but for the persuasion of two or three gentlemen; and the conditions I made were, that my continuing the performance for any length of time at SHEFFIELD, should depend wholly on the degree of success on the second evening, which turning out but very little better than the first, I gave the matter up—nor could any persuasions induce me to resume it. I can scarcely account for that strange kind of caprice through which people take so much pains to manifest the instability of their minds. Nothing could be warmer than the apparent heartiness with which I was entreated to return to SHEFFIELD, nor any thing cooler than my reception when I did return. My welcome, to a stranger, would have seemed as if I had been sent away with contumely, and they had wondered at my impudence at intruding my∣self among them a second time. I looked down upon it, as I can do—heaven be praised—when I ought, with a calm and tranquil mixture of pity and in∣difference; and, though not one of all the number who testified such satis∣faction at my <HI>first</HI> visit came near me on my <HI>second,</HI> I contented myself with a reflection, that as it is the lot of mankind to be fickle, and this worthy quality is generally influenced by local prejudice, it must have arisen, as the French say, from <HI>L'air du pais,</HI> and I have only to consider that the <HI>iron</HI> which was <HI>hot</HI> when I first went there, had <HI>cooled</HI> in my absence.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="215"/>To shew, however, that I have a pleasure in being just, I here publicly thank the inhabitants of SHEFFIELD for bringing me back, even with all this obloquy, for through it I acquired the friendship of Mr. GALES, and the satisfaction of employing him to print this work.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY labour-in-vain expedition to SHEFFIELD hav¦ing trifled away that whole week, a nonsensical business started up which lost me the next. From the little town of ROTHERHAM, a proposal was sent me which, to this moment, I can scarcely make head or tail of. My inten∣tion was to have performed at MANCHESTER on the Tuesday, I however received a message that it would be a profit to me, and a pleasure to the people of ROTHERHAM, if I would give them a night there, and that LADY EFFINGHAM had expressed a wish to that effect. The inhabitants of that place, after putting me to some expence, and making me lose my time, chose, however, to affect a perfect indifference about the matter, and no night took place.</P>
<P>The following letter, which I wrote to clear myself from any suspicion of disrespect to LADY EFFINGHAM, who suffered me to say in the bills that the entertainment was at her particular desire, will elucidate this curious bu∣siness a little better.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
<HEAD>To the Right Hon. the COUNTESS OF EFFINGHAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I scarcely know in what words to apologize to your LA∣DYSHIP for making so ill a return to your condescension as to disappoint you of my performance at ROTHERHAM. The actual reason, however, which I shall briefly state, will infallibly exculpate me from any intention of abusing the very generous and handsome liberality with which you did me the honour to permit the use of your name; which circumstance, had I not been precluded from circulating it, must have procured me an ample attendance.</P>
<P>A proposal, through Mr. WEBB of SHEFFIELD, came to me from YOUR LADYSHIP and Mr. WALKER; and Mr. WEBB went so far as to ask what sum would satisfy me for my trouble of going to ROTHERHAM. My answer—as it has constantly been whenever I hear of liberal names and liberal intentions—was, that I was certainly safe in relying on whatever the gentlemen of ROTHERHAM, influenced by your LADYSHIP and Mr. WAL∣KER, might think proper to do; and as I am very tenacious of not being considered merely as a common exhibiter—my entertainment having been fabricated solely with a view to testify my gratitude to a generous public, previous to my embarkment for INDIA—I told Mr. WEBB that if the night failed, there would be abundant opportunity of making me amends, with∣out any extra-pecuniary gratification, by promoting the subscription of my MUSICAL TOUR. Mr. WEBB undertook to procure me an answer by <HI>noon</HI> on Sunday, and I promised not to go so soon to MANCHESTER. On Sunday night, however, hearing nothing of Mr. WEBB, I wrote to him, and re∣ceived a verbal answer that I must wait on Dr. WAINWRIGHT. Determined to know something more of this business, I called at Doctor WAIN∣WRIGHT's in the morning. I saw only Mrs. WAINWRIGHT, who corro∣borated all that Mr. WEBB had told me; adding, that the Doctor had com∣missioned Mr. WEBB to treat with me, that he would be on that day at
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
ROTHERHAM, that there would be a meeting of the gentlemen, and her advice was that I should immediately go there. This I fully intended, had I not by accident seen your LADYSHIP. This circumstance determined me to stay at SHEFFIELD, and solicit your name to my bill, which request you did me the honour so handsomely to grant. In the interim, however, I wrote to Dr. WAINWRIGHT, and sent some general bills for circulation; but Dr. WAINWRIGHT, having left ROTHERHAM before the arrival of my letter, it was referred to the gentlemen at the meeting, and they agreed to write me word that they were ALL ENGAGED on Tuesday even∣ing, and could not attend me. This letter not being given to the man till past nine o'clock in the evening, he did not return to SHEFFIELD till yes∣terday morning, <HI>after</HI> I had set out to ROTHERHAM, prepared for the per∣formance.</P>
<P>On my arrival there, the woman at the post-office informed me that Mr. WALKER had written me a letter, and if I had not received it, Mr. TUCKER would tell me its contents. I waited on Mr. TUCKER, who blamed me for not giving more notice, and letting the gentlemen know <HI>my</HI> intention sooner. I represented that I had but one intention about it—which was, <HI>not</HI> to go to ROTHERHAM, had I not been strongly solicited—but, that, hearing your LADYSHIP's name and Mr. WALKER's so repeat∣edly mentioned, I had been induced to comply with what was extremely inconvenient to me. Mr. TUCKER informed me that if I performed no∣body could be there—but, to comfort me, that gentleman was so good as to say that, even if he did not come himself, he would send his half crown. I smiled at the compliment, but could not help so far feeling for myself as to say that half a crown was probably no more an object to me than to him. He advised me, at all adventures, to see Mr. WALKER, for whom I immediately sought, but finding he was gone to SHEFFIELD, I saw I had nothing for it but to wait on your LADYSHIP, make my apology, and in∣form you honestly of what had happened—but, on coming to the inn, I found that, in my absence, the landlord had put the horses which drew me to ROTHERHAM to Mr. WALKER's carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="219"/>Thus, prevented every way from paying your LADYSHIP that defe∣rence and respect which are not more your due from your high and dis∣tinguished situation than from your affability and condescending benevo∣lence, I have nothing to resort to but this letter; which will, I doubt not, sufficiently convince you that I have in no respect been to blame; but, on the contrary—as this transaction has put me to some expence, and prevented my receiving advantage elsewhere—I have a right to consider it as as a piece of very unhandsome treatment; which I feel the more severely, having through it, though not wilfully, disappointed your LADY∣SHIP, and given you so much unnecessary trouble.</P>

<DATELINE><HI>Sheffield,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 8, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As I could have proved loss of time and money in this transaction, I think it would have been no bad hit to have proposed to Mr. TUCKER—who, be it known, is a worthy member of the law—an action against Mr. WEBB; for if one may judge by the liberal offer of the half crown, he would have joined issue in such a business with me. But adieu Mr. TUCKER, and adieu ROTHERHAM. An Irish jolmon, to whom I was relating the story, cried out—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ROTHERHAM! Ah now for the future will you be after changing the R into a B, and calling it BOTHERHAM.</Q></P>
<P>Laughing at these disappointments, I began to anticipate the advantages of a visit to MANCHESTER, where, as my recommendations were good, and the inhabitants were said to emulate the spirit of LIVERPOOL, I had no doubt but I should reap a plentiful harvest. In my next you will be able to judge how far my expectations were verified. Adieu. Yours,</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday, January the 12th, I went from SHEFFIELD to MANCHESTER, by the way of CASTLETON, and of course over those tremendous hills which form the most romantic part of the won∣ders of the Peak—but these I shall more particularly describe hereafter. On the Sunday I waited on two gentlemen of consequence in MANCHESTER, and came away so satisfied, that I flattered myself I should find equal success there to that I met with at LIVERPOOL. In the highest spirits, therefore, I adver∣tised, at a venture, three nights—Tuesday the fifteenth, Thursday the seven∣teenth, and Friday the eighteenth—and on those three nights I received almost <HI>one half</HI> of the sum which the <HI>last night</HI> yielded me at LIVERPOOL. The re∣ception of the entertainment smacked a little of HALIFAX, the judges <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"bore a <HI>wary</HI> eye,"</Q> and people, holding tight the captive half crown, made strict enquiries into the value to be received before they could muster up resolution to liberate the coin. To say the truth, I was at last ashamed of them, and, out of pity, relieved them from their uneasiness, by bidding MANCHESTER adieu.</P>
<P>To reverse what I have said of LIVERPOOL, let me not be censured if—faithful to my promise of telling the truth—I should be obliged to place MAN∣CHESTER
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
in an unfavourable point of view. My disappointment there will tell the story for me. At LIVERPOOL I had no previous recommendation that could influence the leading people. At MANCHESTER, a gentleman of the first consequence in the town introduced me personally to all whom he could devise might be of service to me; and, on my account, gave a supper, to which he invited a large number of his particular friends, on the night <HI>before</HI> the first performance. Nor did they want a reporter, and a very able one, of what they were going to hear. One of the gentlemen present had been at the amusement the last night at LIVERPOOL, and spoke in the kindest way, not only of the thing itself, but of the liberal treatment I had received; instancing in particular, that as the concert had been on that very night, many who had indispensible engagements there, just made their appearance, and then devoted the remainder of the evening <HI>to me</HI>—a kind of attention he wished to see imi∣tated at MANCHESTER. Nevertheless, the fact was as I have related. At my coming away, I might have had any thing if I would give them a night or two more, which I took as it was meant—a mere promise—and declined it as it deserved.</P>
<P>It was allowed, on all hands, I had been very ill treated, and it was said, as I had failed in the <HI>entertainment</HI> it should be made up to me in <HI>subscrip∣tion</HI>; and they hoped, if I found that to be the case, I would yet in the course of some weeks pay them another visit. This I promised to do; but passing two months afterwards through the place, and finding that there was not a single <HI>additional</HI> name to my <HI>subscription,</HI> I forewent my intention of calling on any person beside the booksellers—and left MANCHESTER with an opinion which I am very sorry to be convinced it merits.</P>
<P>Let me not however be so ungrateful as to neglect saying that from one gentleman—whose name all MANCHESTER will recollect without my menti∣oning it—I received a warm and friendly attention beyond my abilities to de∣scribe. If he had intreated for a favour to be conferred on himself, he could not have been more solicitous, more anxious, or more industrious. Indeed I
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
wish I had never gone to MANCHESTER; for I am sure there are many of those who call themselves his friends, whom—after this business—he can never cor∣dially think so. I take leave in this place to thank that gentleman, and to as∣sure him that no length of time or change of situation shall ever efface his kindness from my memory.</P>
<P>The business would have turned out better if it had been undertaken by any body but this gentleman; and will it be believed why? He knew no∣thing of music. 'Twas in vain that he held out, with the greatest good-nature, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Am I obliged to learn <HI>sol fa</HI> to receive pleasure when I hear an agreeable song!'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. DIBDIN ought to have been taken up by the conoscenti,"</Q> who I would lay my life would be the very first to pick a hole in his coat.</P>
<P>This and the promised pleasure of the ensuing week, when a new organ was to be opened at their concert room, deprived me of all the <HI>gentlemen</HI> mu∣sicians. Mr. GREEN, who was putting up the organ, was a deity among them. Have you seen him? What sort of man is he? Oh sir, he is a won∣derful creature! In short, they were so full of it, that I expected to see a portrait of the organ and organ-maker in the next MANCHESTER <HI>print</HI>; and yet, with all this fuss, when the grand day came, they had not—after such an expence and so long a notice—two-thirds of the number that usually attend a common concert at LIVERPOOL.</P>
<P>The narrowness that characterises the people of MANCHESTER is not con∣fined to their pleasures, it is evidently apparent in their trade. Considering them as a community, they are like an army of MERCENARIES. At their head are a few individuals of consequence, under whom all the rest are doomed to serve in perpetual subordination; but LIVERPOOL is a corps of volunteers in which any may rise by industry, merit, and perseverance, to the highest posts. Some few at MANCHESTER must assuredly be immensely wealthy, but it is impossible that it can boast, within a prodigious sum indeed, the ag∣gregate riches of LIVERPOOL. As therefore the wealth falls comparatively
<PB N="216" REF="223"/>
into a few hands—the tradesman-like plodding routine of whose business is to pay weekly wages and settle short credits—there cannot be the same extension of ideas, the same necessity for a large scale of calculation, for a competent knowledge of the comparative interests of nations, for clear and well-digested general intelligence, and all those other important mental requisites which make up the broad, comprehensive pursuits of a merchant. In short, MANCHES∣TER, where a small number hoard considerable wealth, and the rest are merely paid for their labour, cannot, on the scale of commerce, be put in competi∣tion with LIVERPOOL; where the tide of treasure—like the sea that produces it—rolls in a wide and expansive circulation; nor is it more conducive to pri∣vate and partial advantage than general convenience.</P>
<P>Men however of these contracted principles generally are strictly honest, and possess the lesser virtues with as much punctuality and exactness as they honour a bill of exchange; and there can be no doubt but from the timidity attendant on the common moral duties of life, and an anxiety to comply as far as men can with the letter of that religion they punctually attend the cere∣monies of—by way of example to their children and servants—the humanity so evidently manifest in the present efforts to abolish the <HI>slave trade</HI> had its rise, The motive beyond contradiction is laudable.</P>
<P>After examining, in my next letter, whether the people of MANCHES∣TER get or lose by setting themselves up rather as <HI>judges</HI> than as <HI>lovers</HI> of MU∣SIC, I shall proceed to investigate their arguments relative to this important sub∣ject, place those of LIVERPOOL by the side of them, and see whether their ge∣neral policy merits that attention from the legislature they expect, or whether it has proceeded from that ruling passion which POPE says time itself cannot tame; and he might have added, had he known my friendship, any more than it can the sincerity with which I profess to be</P>

<Q>"<HI>The sports of children satisfy the child.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME years ago there was a party of critics who constantly made a point of attending the <HI>theatres.</HI> They were always headed by a chief, whom they distinguished by the name of Mr. TOWN; and this gentleman being chosen for his superior adroitness at discovering the faults of authors, very gravely—in the name he had the modesty to assume—pronounced the fate of many a trembling poet and composer. It happened however after a length of time, that indifferent people, who really went to the <HI>theatres</HI> to be pleased, and to judge for themselves, thought proper to take up the business, and a few ineffectual struggles over, Mr. TOWN and his partizans were obliged to leave the field in disgrace, and withdraw to pot houses, their master's offices, or such other obscure retreats, from which they originally issued, in arrogant expectation of giving the ton to an opulent metropolis in an enligh∣tened age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A most ludicrous instance of the dismission of an actor, through the <HI>fiat</HI> of Mr. TOWN, happened in Goodman's Fields. A GENTLEMAN was announced for the character of MACBETH, and went thro' it with so much reputation that it was agreed to give it out for the following night. A Miss BUDGEL played LADY MACBETH, and it so happened that during his acquaintance with that lady, at the dif∣ferent rehearsals, he fell passionately in love with his <HI>theatrical</HI> wife—which misfortune might not have happened to him had she been his <HI>real</HI> one. During the time of the performance he was more enrap∣tured than ever. After it was over, standing near her, by the side of the scenes, receiving her warm compliments and congratulations, an actor, who had personated one of the witches, was sent on the stage to announce a repetition of the performance on the following night. The audience, the moment the man appeared, burst into a loud laugh. MACBETH could not conceive whence this arose, till, looking on the stage, he saw the actor who had began to arrange himself for the farce, with his hair sinely dressed, and some of the witches rags hanging about him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God bless me,"</Q> cried he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis mighty ridiculous to send this stupid fellow on the stage—what shall we do?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My dear Sir,</Q> said Miss BUDGEL, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you have nothing for it but to give it out yourself.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear creature,"</Q> returned the charmed MACBETH, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll do it—my sweet Miss BUDGEL!—dear, charming Miss BUDGEL!"</Q>—On he rushed, full of the idea of Miss BUDGEL, and, as soon as he could be heard, he thundered out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ladies and gentlemen, to morrow evening—Miss BUDGEL will be <HI>done over again.</HI>"</Q> Mr. TOUN found something indelicate in this business, and poor MACBETH was banished from the theatre.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="225"/>This party has never been entirely quelled, their fury however now vents itself only in bickerings at coffee houses, snarling in the box lobby, or now and then a squib in the newspapers; but this last never happens, unless inte∣rest be made with the understrappers when the editor is out of the way—for free tickets, the performance of now and then a farce, and other douceurs, have locked up the newspapers from the admission of any strictures relative to the theatres, but such as are within the description of Mr. SHERIDAN's list of <HI>puffs</HI> in <HI>The Critic.</HI> Lest this last policy however should not be sufficient to insure to the <HI>managers</HI> all the success it may be <HI>convenient</HI> to command—for that it has been sometimes thought expedient to accelerate the damnation of pieces I <HI>know</HI> to be a fact—a formidable phalanx of <HI>orderly</HI> people are stationed to crush in its infancy every attempt at a riot. These have their various tasks as∣signed them; and to say the truth, they have often as hard parts to play as those on the stage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes it is the duty of these <HI>theatrical</HI> auxiliaries to make the most disturbances themselves, in order to drown one clamour with another. An Irishman being witness to this, and asking a person near him what could induce those people to make such a noise, was informed they had all come in with <HI>orders.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well then, upon my soul,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never saw a set of <HI>orderly</HI> people so <HI>riotous</HI> in all my life."</Q></NOTE> Through these and other wise precautions, theatrical matters are put upon so desirable a footing, that it is not what the town has
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
an opinion of, but what the manager, through interest—to oblige a favourite, or some such equitable motive—chuses to obtrude on the public, which we see continually crammed down their throats, and which has so perverted the original institution of the drama, that it would be as useless to search for mo∣rality, wit, taste, genius, or any intrinsic requisite of the stage, in most of the modern dramatic productions, as for <HI>charity</HI> in the heart of an USURER, or <HI>truth</HI> in the tongue of a HYPOCRITE.</P>
<P>Scions from this old stock of party seem pretty freely to have spread them∣selves over most of the towns of consequence in this kingdom. Playhouse critics however have in the country very little to do; for by then they have seen <HI>Macbeth</HI> two or three times break his truncheon—<HI>Richard</HI> start at the ghosts, all the men have fallen in love, and all the women envied some <HI>bloom∣ing</HI> actress of <HI>sixty</HI>; and a few of the first rate having gone to LONDON for orders, and seen the performers there, have pronounced the country actors to be <HI>damned stuff</HI>—expended curiosity dies away, and the unfortunate sons and daughters of <HI>Thespis</HI> having stamped, roared, grinned, and squalled as long as any 'prentice boys are to be found to make up their gallery, are obliged to take to their cart and undergo the same humiliation in some other place.</P>
<P><HI>Musical critics</HI> have a great deal more to do. An attorney's clerk who can play WEIDEMAN's minuet joins a mercer's apprentice, who, from fre∣quenting hops has learnt to scrape a little of one of the city waites. The at∣torney decamped—perhaps after being pilloried for perjury, and the mercer become a bankrupt, the clerk and the apprentice are in business for themselves. Perhaps one becomes an alderman and the other a town-clerk. A subscrip∣tion is now proposed, a concert-room is built, where the MERCER <HI>leads,</HI> and the ATTORNEY <HI>plays solos.</HI> The plan is at length extended, till in the race-week, at the assizes, or some other public season, whatever singer happens then to be popular is invited, an oratorio performed, and Messieurs LATITAT
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
and REMNANT quit the <HI>red tails</HI> and the <HI>quality binding,</HI> to emulate—in noise at least—the festivals of the Abbey.</P>
<P>I really mean no more by my MERCER and ATTORNEY than the latter would by A and B did he put a case. What I have instanced is virtually the fact; and it has this operation. If it so happen that the <HI>lovers</HI> of music out-number the <HI>judges</HI>—as they call themselves—every thing will be conducted upon a broad, liberal plan, and the concert do honour to the place, by giving encouragement to men of abilities and refining the taste of the inhabitants; if on the contrary the <HI>judges</HI> have a majority, it will be carried on upon a nar∣row, jealous, contracted scale. The music will be injudiciously chosen, an unnecessary consequence assumed; and at length, what was meant as an har∣monic meeting will become a scene of confusion, till the gentlemen players have no opportunity to display the brilliancy of their superior talents, but thro' the mortifying medium of private meetings at each other's houses. At LI∣VERPOOL, the <HI>lovers</HI> have the majority <HI>twenty</HI>—perhaps <HI>fifty</HI>—to one: At MANCHESTER, I am afraid it goes as strongly in favour of the <HI>judges.</HI> Let them therefore take care not to follow the example of LEEDS; where—and I have already shewn why—there will not, in all probability, next year be a concert at all. None of this would however be worth a comment, if the sports of these children—like the others in the fable of the frogs—was not the death of genius, and consequently the cause of stagnating that profession they pretend to encourage.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. <HI>MANCHESTER VERSUS LIVERPOOL.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"<HI>You have among you many an hired slave:</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Shall I say, marry them to your children,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Let them be free!</HI>"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE objections which originated at MANCHES∣TER, and which have since extended to a large part of the kingdom, against the slave trade, are as follow.</P>
<P>That it is a disgrace to humanity, and a reproach to a nation which boasts the mildest government, and professes the justest religion upon earth, to buy and sell our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>That the English, not contented with the prisoners taken in those wars among the different powers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the coast of AFRICA, which are provoked by their own jealousies and other private motives, irritate the natives to commit partial depredations on each other, and thus unnecessarily are the cause of spilling human blood, and laying waste the habitations of harmless and peace∣able individuals, for the purpose of supplying slaves for the markets in the WEST-INDIES.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="229"/>That these poor wretches are treated with the most inhuman cruelty; that on board of ship they are stived down in the hold, without the smallest respect to sex or age, or any regard to common decency; and that if they re∣pine, chains, whips, and thumb-screws, bring them to a sense of their miserable condition, and the scene often ends with their embracing death to free them from a worse calamity; that this cruelty extends throughout the whole term of their slavery, which—unless they can raise a sum, generally impossible—is for life; that they are cart-whipt and treated with much other cruelty, under which a white man would expire, for the most trivial faults; and that four years generally wear out—owing to this reiterated torture—the most robust constitutions among them, when they fall willing victims to their dreadful fate, which becomes a standing and indelible reproach to the name of Eng∣lishman.</P>
<P>That there have been some instances to the contrary, since all the world is not possessed of the same want of feeling; that indeed they have been rare, but when they have happened, the planter has found his first stock become sufficiently numerous to answer all his purposes—for by gentleness and kind treatment they have increased astonishingly, and, as his humane endeavours have been evidently visited by a blessing from heaven, he has amassed immense riches—while the negroes have extolled <HI>him</HI> as a <HI>benefactor,</HI> whom they ex∣pected to find a grievous and oppressive <HI>task master.</HI></P>
<P>That a planter may take away the life of a slave without being in the smallest degree accountable for his actions.</P>
<P>That the GUINEA trade, over and above the other evils which attend it, is the destruction of many brave Englishmen, inasmuch as that the flower of our intrepid tars find a grave upon the coast of AFRICA.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="230"/>That the abolition of this unnatural traffic would be rather a benefit than a disadvantage as to the consumption of our commodities, for that we might then have returns in articles the produce of that country.</P>
<P>That a total abolition of the slave trade, and nothing less, would go to a reform of the grievances arising from it; for, by being convinced that they could no longer recruit their stock from the old market, planters would cease to be wantonly cruel, and naturally turn their thoughts to the care and pre∣servation of the slaves then upon their hands, imitating the single instance of the merciful West-Indian before mentioned, which would produce many great and salutary effects. The planter, contenting himself with the slaves already in his possession, would, as the negroes are naturally prolific, increase his stock every year; also having no more purchase-money to pay, he could in a short time be enabled to part with his sugar and rum cheaper than formerly, and thus we could afford to undersell all the other West-India islands. That these desirable blessings would perpetuate the merciful reign of GEORGE the Third, and finally, to the end of time, stand forward as as an example of hu∣manity unparalelled in the annals of the world.</P>
<P>Many other inland towns having caught fire at the long enumeration of <HI>grievances</HI> sustained, and advantages that would arise from the extirpation of the cause of those grievances, have, to their honour, taken up the subject, and in a variety of petitions—among which that of SHEFFIELD is one of the best written—besought parliament to interpose their authority, and put a stop to this growing evil; and they hold out what appears to be a strong proof of the handsome disinterestedness of MANCHESTER, namely, that their goods go now to purchase the African slaves, whereas they are willing to forego all ad∣vantage as <HI>dealers,</HI> rather than be remiss in their duty as <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>These petitions look forward to the happy consequences that they say would be derived from so noble an exercise of English philanthropy. In them
<PB N="224" REF="231"/>
is introduced every argument that generosity can dictate, and the most power∣ful language used to intreat the legislature to protect the savages, and to in∣duce the merchants who have an interest in that trade nobly to throw it up with the same greatness of mind in which they have been set so laudable an example by the benevolent inhabitants of MANCHESTER.</P>
<P>Besides the petitioners, a number of societies have formed, who split the different questions into every possible division; but as this would take off from the solemnity of the business, and seem as if I wished to supply LIVERPOOL with opportuity to introduce palliating subterfuges, I shall, in my next letter, let them meet the question on its present ground. After which, the reader and I will fairly compare both arguments—which done, I shall leave him as a jury to decide upon the merits of the case.</P>
<P>Mercy upon poor LIVERPOOL, if the arguments of MANCHESTER be found as infallible, as that I am,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>To do a great right, do a little wrong.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN reply to these charges, LIVERPOOL says,</P>
<P>That if there can be no reason, supported by sound policy, legislative necessity, or any of those indispensable urgencies which in all politics occasion∣ally introduce a partial and apparent oppression for the sake of general conve∣nience, the African <HI>slave trade</HI> is as it has been represented—an infamous traf∣fic, and a disgrace to the national character of the English; but if it be made appear that it is perfectly expedient, and also that it is a blessing—instead of a misfortune—to the savages, whose Situations are so loudly and vehemently de∣plored, they conceive the various petitions for its abolition ought to be thrown out—though certainly originating from benevolent intentions—as frivolous and vexatious.</P>
<P>That so false is the report that the English provoke wars up the country on the coast of AFRICA, for the purpose of purchasing slaves, no Englishman ever yet returned who ventured five miles from the shore. That were the English so inhuman as to meditate any such thing, it is perfectly unnecessary. The nations on the coast of AFRICA are remarkably prolific, and naturally
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
lazy, cultivation is scarcely known among them, and fishing and hunting procure them the only blessings of life their savage nature is capable of enter∣taining a conception of. There are among them many tribes, and they are never without being in some place or other at war. The prisoners made in these wars are doomed some to be <HI>sacrificed,</HI> some <HI>eaten</HI>—for they are cannibals to a man—and some <HI>sold.</HI> These last are purchased by the ENGLISH, the DUTCH, the FRENCH, the PORTUGUESE, the SPANISH, the DANES, and, as all the world knows, by many other nations. Do all those go up the country to provoke wars? Or do they lay in wait for the poor captives who are tricked by the insidious arts of Englishmen into unnecessary quarrels? Bravery, and all the generosity attending on it, is the characteristic of Englishmen. Why then should their fellow country men load them with such unworthy suspicions? But the wars alone do not furnish the slaves sold upon the coast of GUINEA. If a negro have thirty wives, they are his slaves, so are their children; and it is not uncustomary to see a man sell his whole family. Of the poor devoted wretches taken in war, those who are sold are the happiest, unless it can be proved that they are treated with all that cruelty which again is rather harshly laid to the charge of Englishmen; in which case indeed, <HI>death</HI> were desirable. These poor wretches are brought forth—such a number are put apart to be EATEN at the public sacrifices, the rest are carried to market—the refuse of whom, which always amounts to a considerable number, are beheaded, and then—or perhaps alive, as a prey to the sharks—thrown into the sea. A gen∣tleman, from whose mouth this is taken, says that a Captain FARRER, after having purchased as many as his ship would conveniently contain, saw those he had refused to buy, beheaded before his face to the number of sixty-two.</P>
<P>That on board of ship no slave was ever treated but with the greatest mildness and lenity, unless he were mutinous, in which case common policy will make it necessary to be a little rigorous. That the accommodations are studiously laid out for their convenience,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This I am competent to speak to, having myself examined a Guineaman with the most minute attention.</NOTE> and every effort exerted to preserve
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
them in health and vigour. Indeed, if Englishmen had all that ferocity at present attributed to them; if they could be hardened enough to gall a poor de∣fenceless slave with chains, flog him into sickness, and invent new horrors to increase the calamity of his situation—their interest would forbid it. They must be madmen to brave an unhealthy clime, and expend immense sums to purchase a set of miserable objects merely to exercise on them so much wanton barbarity. When the slaves come to the West-Indian, by being re-purchased at a higher price, it still more behoves their masters to attend to their treat∣ment. They are certainly set to work, but their labour is not within any de∣gree of comparison equal to that of a farmer's man, who, at the harvest time, has not a single hour's cessation from binding and carrying, from three o'clock in the morning till nine at night—whereas a negro can never work but from six to six. In short, any English labourer is worked much harder—but then the climate! Why it is congenial to their nature—but the cart whip! Is nothing. They are lazy beyond any thing that can be conceived; and if they were not stimulated to it, would do nothing. But it is a mistake that a planter can whip a negro to death—he must receive but thirty-nine lashes; and if every one of the thirty-nine were ten, they would be still nothing to a dozen at the gangway. That so far from the planter's treating them with any thing but general kindness—for he must not suffer them to get the upper hand of him, unless he chuses to have his throat cut—every negro has his little spot of ground, from which the markets are supplied with vegetables on a Sunday, with the produce of which they make little parties of pleasure, have their balls and different pastimes, and, unless it be some few moody malecontents—which are to be found in all states—are as happy as any people under the sun. Nei∣ther is this ground taken away from them—as some assert—when they have brought it to perfection; for if this were the case, where would they get the money to purchase their freedom, which happens every day.</P>
<P>In short, a negro's idea when he is purchased is, that he is to be eaten; and as nothing can induce him to drive this idea from his imagination—for
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>
persuading him to the contrary confirms it the stronger, as he thinks he is only told so that he may become <HI>chearful</HI> and get <HI>fat</HI>—therefore they generally come to market very thin, which probably has given rise to the report of their being cruelly treated at sea—but when he finds he is only to work, and sees himself in the midst of his countrymen, who have wives and families and are happy, only upon condition that they labour a little, he, like them, buckles to his situation, and finds that the bread he regularly earns by industry, is sweeter than the precarious subsistance he before picked up—which perhaps was not procured till his poisoned arrow had drank the blood of his countryman.</P>
<P>I will not say how far 'tis expedient by doing a little wrong to do a great right—but we will go on with the reasons of LIVERPOOL, after I have once more subscribed myself</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE objections of LIVERPOOL to the assertions of MANCHESTER, go on thus.</P>
<P>That certainly those who treat the slaves with the most lenity stand a chance of being best assisted by their services; but the instance adduced that they are likely, through good treatment alone, to grow sufficiently populous for the WEST-INDIES to need no further supply of them, is a most extraordinary assertion. It is well known there are very few women brought from AFRICA, and many of these, through their connections with white men, get their li∣berty. This is certainly a subject not to be defended upon rational principles, but it is a worldly blessing which the negroes have a very strong relish for; and that the fact exists, witness all those degrees of complection under the titles of Mulatto, Mustee, &amp;c. who at last enjoy the immunities of Englishmen, and become planters themselves. Besides, it can never be credited that, if there were any possible means of keeping up a sufficient stock without a fresh supply, that men would lavish away large sums to purchase new slaves merely for the pleasure of treating them ill.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237"/>That a planter cannot take away the life of a slave without being account∣able for his actions. The laws formerly were very loose on this subject, and murder of this kind has been committed—and so it has in ENGLAND—with impunity. There was always however a heavy fine for this crime, and in aggravated cases the punishment was never less than death; and what is this but our distinction of manslaughter and murder? These laws however, be∣fore MANCHESTER said a word on the subject, it was thought necessary to render more rigid, and JAMAICA has already determined to make this crime death without benefit of clergy;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An act to this effect has since passed.</NOTE> but even if these laws did not exist, there is an unfeeling cruelty beyond description in a man's coolly sitting down and supposing that his fellow creatures—his countrymen—can depart from those sensations by which alone they deserve to be linked to society, and deliberately commit murder, to their manifest disadvantage, in the moment a poor wretch needs most his pity and compassion, merely because that wretch is in his power. No animal in the circuit of creation ever took a life, but to gratify hunger or satiate revenge. To the latter ignoble propensity man most assu∣redly is too much addicted—but not more in the WEST-INDIES than in ENG∣LAND, or any other part of the world; nor indeed are Englishmen more re∣markable for this savage brutality than the inhabitants of any other nation; why then, in a moment of forward and unnecessary zeal, single out the Eng∣lish West India planters, in particular, as the perpetrators of unprovoked and useless barbarity?—which, were they capable of, they would deserve to be swept from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>That nothing can prove so decidedly the superficial and fallacious princi∣ples upon which the inhabitants of MANCHESTER ground their arguments, as their assertion that the GUINEA trade is the destruction of some of our bravest seaman. It is well known that when king's ships are paid off, unhappy sailors, who have so nobly maintained during a war the glorious naval supe∣riority of Englishmen, take to bad courses for want of employ, and that the
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
gallows groans with those neglected objects of bravery, who perhaps, a few months before, were the dread of their enemies. Is it wonderful then, that those who have the resolution to withstand the temptations which seduced their companions, should leave their country—which they must do or starve—upon <HI>any terms?</HI> But this object is scarcely worth contending for:—the sailors who man the Guineamen are very few of them of this description—they are mostly such wretches as, having escaped justice in this country, are obliged to fly; for it may be fairly averred, that the vessels bound to AFRICA, by taking such pests of society with them, go more to the prevention of de∣predations on the public than all the watchfulness of the English police. To say the truth, these ought most to be terrified at the chains in which they are sure to be manacled, whenever they treat the slaves with cruelty.</P>
<P>That if the assertion be founded—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it would be rather a benefit than a disadvantage to abolish the slave trade, because we might then have re∣turns for our commodities in articles the produce of AFRICA,"</Q> it contra∣dicts that which went before; for, in this case, would not the sailors be as likely to find a grave upon that coast in any common <HI>trading voyage</HI> as by <HI>bartering for slaves?</HI> Besides, this holds out a sort of argument that the dis∣interestedness of MANCHESTER is not quite so clear as upon the first blush it appeared; for if a mutual commerce of produce for produce could be brought about, the MANCHESTER goods might in that case, not only be sold in as large quantities, but probably to much greater advantage. But, after all, what is the value of the produce of AFRICA? What of consequence have we ever done even with SENEGAL? If we could <HI>colonize</HI> indeed!—but then, would not the death of the emigrants be an improvement on the cruelty which it is said has stimulated us to carry so many sailors to their graves in that unwhole∣some country?</P>
<P>That a total abolition of the slave trade would shake the very existence of our WEST-INDIA possessions; for there cannot be a falser argument than that
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
a stock of slaves is to be kept up without a constant supply from AFRICA; and as to the visionary notion of putting them on a footing with hired servants, 'tis too ridiculous to deserve a thought. In short, were the slave trade put an end to, the French, and others, who at present participate with us upon an equal footing the advantages arising from the produce of the Caribbee Islands, would then come at their produce upon better terms, and in greater abun∣dance; and thus would one exertion of humanity, perfectly laudable in private speculation, in its public operation, train with it the most pernicious and de∣structive consequences.</P>
<P>These arguments have branched into a multitude of others, to which MANCHESTER has <HI>replied,</HI> and LIVERPOOL <HI>rejoined</HI>—the material points how∣ever are contained in what I have already set down; but this controversy has drawn from LIVERPOOL a question of certainly much greater magnitude than the slave trade—and it is this: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were it not wiser, and even more humane, before we carry our clemency to AFRICA, to exert it a little for the relief of that oppression under which our fellow subjects groan <HI>at home?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Some of their observations on this subject, which are very pointed, shall make up a part of the next letter—this I finish without any farther comment, since this important subject is a pending one, and will no doubt undergo a full and satisfactory investigation.

<Q>"<HI>Charity begins at home.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I shall now speak to the grievances which exist at home, and are said by LIVERPOOL to have thrown such a shadow over the present <HI>soi disant</HI> philanthropic exertions, as almost totally to eclipse them.</P>
<P>These are comprehended in a general abuse and wilful perversion of the spirit of our laws. Hence all the distresses to harmless and industrious families, by kidnapping and pressing for the army and navy, through which deserted wives and children are committed to the care of merciless overseers, and un∣thinking boys, in time of peace, flogged to death for desertion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An instance of this kind lately occurred, which plainly evinces that if the <HI>laws</HI> of this country are mild, the <HI>execution</HI> of them is cruelly rigourous. In the course of last month, at DOVER, a lad of eighteen was sentenced to receive a thousand lashes for desertion. They had given him five hundred, when—in terms of the most moving supplication—he implored a respite of the remainder of his sen∣tence, crying out, in accents scarcely utterable, through the violence of his agony, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that his heart was breaking, and he should die under it if they flogged him any longer!"</Q>—regardless however of his en∣treaties, they continued their unmerciful work, till at the end of six hundred and fifty lashes—perceiv∣ing him actually dying—they removed him to the guard-house, where he expired the next morning! Query, whether this is not at least a march for any cruelty that has been practised in the WEST-IN∣DIES? There is certainly great opportunity for abuses to creep into martial laws, and it originates from this: Those who are most likely to commit crimes, cannot be tried by their peers. Thus private soldiers and foremast men are generally punished with rigour, and the <HI>crimes</HI> of officers too often palli∣ated and softened into <HI>errors.</HI> My brother assured me the following is a fact. A strange, eccentric fel∣low, who was a cook's mate on board a man of war, among other singularities, used to amuse the sailors with tricks on the cards, cups and balls, and other feats of <HI>legerdemain.</HI> The captain—who was not blest with a very brilliant understanding—instead of seeing this matter in the harmless light it deserved, found in his idea something very reprehensible in it. The sailor was ordered into his pre∣sence, and told that he had heard strange things of him. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Have you indeed, your honour,'</Q> said JACK, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what are they sir, if I may be so bold?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> said the captain, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they say you are a <HI>conjuror.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Lord bless your honour,'</Q> answered the tar, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'why then, if that's the case, they says strange things of your honour.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of me, you rascal, why what, you impudent dog, do they say of me?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why they says, and please your honour, as how your honour is <HI>no conjuror.</HI>'</Q> This, tho' there was no offence in it from the heart, ought to have procured the sailor at least a reprimand, if not a slight punishment—for certainly the barrier of subordination ought never to be overleaped. The captain however determined upon a more complete revenge than was then in his power, dismissed him with a smile—but, from that moment, privately set him down in his black book. No effectual oppor∣tunity occurred to gratify this smothered revenge, till the sailor having got drunk ashore neglected to return at the appointed time with his companions. This being the moment the captain wished for, poor JACK was tried for desertion, and sentenced to be <HI>keel hauled.</HI> When he was brought forward to suffer his sentence, he begged leave to speak to the captain—to whom he said, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am sentenced, your honour, to undergo a very heavy punishment, though I have done nothing to deserve it; but I have been tried by a court martial of <HI>captains</HI>—had I been an officer, my tricks upon the cards would have been a <HI>genteel amusement,</HI> my <HI>crimes</HI> all <HI>errors,</HI> and my <HI>slaying ashore</HI> a <HI>frolic.</HI> God bless you sir, and all the harm I wish you is, that for the next crime your honour commits, you may be tried by a court martial of <HI>foremast men</HI>—and now for DAVY JONES's <HI>locker!</HI>'</Q> Saying which words, he jumped over∣board.</NOTE> Hence all
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
the injuries sustained by the constitution, owing to smuggling, through which the <HI>fair</HI> trader fails, and the <HI>nesarious</HI> one becomes opulent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certainly this fact exists.</NOTE>—through which the exciseman keeps his horse and his girl, and spends five hundred a year, though he receives from government but fifty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I saw myself a letter from an exciseman to a captain of a ship, in which were these words: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, I understand you want to land some goods on Friday in the afternoon, therefore at that time I shall contrive to be three miles off on <HI>government business.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>—through which are levied shop and other grievous taxes, whose produce the customs and excise alone would yield, were they not defrauded by those who smuggle, and others who countenance smugglers—and through which a few half-ankers of brandy are
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
seized by consent, to cover the running of valuable goods to an immense amount. Hence come all the evils arising from imprisonment for debt, through which an unmerciful creditor has been known to decide upon the <HI>liberty, pro∣perty,</HI> and even LIFE of an oppressed debtor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Instead of commenting on this subject in a note, I shall reserve it to make up my next letter.</NOTE>—through which attornies swarm in this country like locusts—through which the villain is sure to escape, and the unfortunate man to be punished—through which rogues in prison banquet in luxury, and innocent men, envying the milder lot of felons, <HI>petition</HI> to be transported to BOTANY BAY;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This instance happened about a twelvemonth ago—the debtors in Newgate seeing the prepara∣tions for transporting the felons to BOTANY BAY, petitioned to go with them.</NOTE> and lastly—for were I to enumerate all the in∣stances they adduce, and the variety of partial evils arising from them, the re∣mainder of this publication would not contain them—hence come the ineffi∣cacy of the penal laws, through which thieves thrive in the neighbourhood of justice—through which informers, who are the only instruments to put the laws in force, are deemed infamous—through which justice is made a trade, and lawless bandittis are every thing but protected by those whose duty it is to exterminate them.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>This is a field on which Mr. CLOUGH—of whom I had formerly the honour to speak—would largely expatiate. His doctrine was, that thieves are encouraged by the runners of rotation offices till—as they express it—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their time is come,"</Q> and to inure them to their certain fate, they make a point of attending executions. He tells a story of one of these who used to be so much favoured as now and then to be permitted <HI>for love</HI> to help JACK KETCH to adjust the knot. When his own hanging-day arrived, with all imaginable unconcern, he looked up at the clock, and said to one of his companions, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I say, GEORGE, I think we are <HI>rather late to-day!</HI>"</Q> His stories of the placid indifference with which these poor wretches submit to their fate were numerous, and every one of them proved, that it strong habit and example had not confirmed in them a belief (as rivetted as that of soldiers and sailors as to their fate in battle) that they were predestined to the gibbet, many of them, by being roused to their rational duties, through the vigilance of the police, might have become useful members of society:—but the magistrates themselves know, that as other children learn something to give the man idea of re∣ligion and morality, so those in <HI>St. Giles's</HI> are taught to lisp out the exploits of their fathers, and no∣thing is so common as to hear a boy of five year's old talk of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"dying game."</Q> I shall select one more of Mr. CLOUGH's stories to finish this note.</P><P>A poor fellow whose irons had just been knocked off in the press-yard was seen to whimper, upon which Mr. AKERMAN—who bears the character of a thinking and considerate man—pleased probably to see an unexpected example of feeling, in one who had always appeared very hardened, asked him, with great kindness, what troubled him—saying, that any thing in his power that could alleviate this distress for the few short moments he had to live he should be welcome to—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as to your fate."</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you seemed a few minutes ago to be very resigned to it."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Lord love you,'</Q> replied the poor wretch, sni∣veling, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">''tis not that—as to hanging, 'tis as well now as another time—but I have not sixpence to buy a natty nightcap—and a man you know, Master AKERMAN, may as well go <HI>dessent</HI> out of the world—but I should not mind it so much, if that NED NUBBING CHEAT had not refused to lend me his—and that you know was damned ill-natured, for he can't want it till next sessions!'</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="243"/>All these the people of LIVERPOOL are of opinion require a reform—not that they would wish any amendment that might go to the extirpation of the laws, for they are evidently a <HI>benefit,</HI> though their execution may be an <HI>evil</HI>; and they conclude what they have offered on this subject, by saying that though they would recommend a cure of home abuses, as a project of amore sane and rational nature, rather than a reform on the coast of AFRICA, yet should the present complainants be really able to point out any abuses in the <HI>slave trade,</HI> and hit upon an expedient that may go to their redress, they will be the first to offer them their public thanks, not from any ostentation of greater libera∣lity than their neighbours, but because in that case they will have done a desi∣rable and material service to the community in general, and in particular to the inhabitants of LIVERPOOL.</P>
<P>In this state I leave the subject of the slave trade. It was in some degree my duty to report as much as I knew of it, and it would have exceeded my duty to say whose arguments are the most worthy attention. The only cir∣cumstance I can speak to, from my own conviction, is, the accommodations on board the Guineamen, which are wonderfully calculated for the comfort and convenience of the slaves; indeed the crew, and even the officers them∣selves, are very ill accommodated, merely that the whole ship may be appro∣priated to the use of those objects on whose health and good treatment certainly depend the success of their voyage.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOWEVER expedient, however wise, however salutary may be the <HI>political</HI> JUSTICE of the laws respecting debtor and credi∣tor in this country, nothing can teem with more <HI>moral</HI> INFAMY than their execution. A detension of the person has been thought, by every wise man, to be oppressive, and even impolitic; but I will not go upon that, the laws <HI>war∣rant,</HI> or at least <HI>tolerate</HI> it, and I shall hardly betray so much folly as to offer a sentiment on what will never be effected till law lords cease to dictate on sub∣jects that wholly apply to their own interest, though the very same plea is at all times sufficient to render the testimony of a witness inadmissible in the courts.</P>
<P>Any man who will make oath to a debt of ten pounds, may arrest ano∣ther, and if he cannot give bail to the action, put him in jail. It is not neces∣sary that there be such debt in actual existence; for if any accounts have passed between the two persons, and there should be only a balance of twenty shil∣lings, an oath may be <HI>legally</HI> made of the <HI>whole,</HI> let the amount be ever so large, and when the debtor is once in jail, it will take <HI>five terms</HI> to bring the matter to a final issue, provided the creditor chuse so long to procrastinate the
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
dispute. Thus a man who only owes <HI>twenty shillings</HI> may, in this country, be imprisoned a year and a quarter, lose his time and reputation, pay fifty pounds for law, and emancipate from his confinement a beggar—whereas common reason says, that the creditor ought to have been compelled in the first instance to state the account fairly, and receive his due, without having it in his power to indulge an indignant and implacable revenge, from which motive alone could spring a wish to harrass a fellow-creature, for the pleasure of contemplating his sufferings. But it will be asked whether creditors in ge∣neral are so unnecessarily oppressive; and if they are, what can induce them to it? My answer is, there are three times the number of attornies that can honestly get employ in this kingdom. From this it arises, that when one of them is consulted, instead of <HI>healing</HI> a breach—which is his duty—he makes it <HI>wider</HI>; for indeed he must do so, or starve. Vengeance is always advised instead of compassion, and this must be gone about in the most expensive way possible, that they may more completely hamper the poor devil who has the misfortune to come under their hands. The action commenced—the next object is to serve it in as disgraceful and inconvenient a manner as possible—for lawyers as naturally study the interest of bailiffs as physicians do that of the apothecaries. By this means, they look out for red letter days, and such other adventitious means as may put it as much as possible out of the power of the poor debtor to escape, till—to use their own words—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"every man has had a leg or a wing."</Q> To explain myself. We will suppose Saturday and Monday red letter days—the defendant, in this case, is always arrested on a Friday—but not before six o'clock in the evening. Thus, though he be pre∣pared to give bail or pay the money, he cannot be released till the following Tuesday—because the intervention of the two holidays and the Sunday, pre∣clude all possibility of searching the office, though at the moment of the cap∣tion fifty to one but they know that there is nothing else against him. Dur∣ing the four days he is in custody, to a certainty every art is used—nine times out of ten by the attorney, but always by the bailiffs—to induce other credi∣tors to lay detainers against him. At length, after accumulated disgrace, mor∣tification,
<PB N="239" REF="246"/>
and expence, by signing notes, cognovits, and warrants of attor∣ney, he purchases a temporary liberty, at an immoderate disadvantage—and after finding it impossible to fulfil these engagements so extorted, he goes to prison for life, at the will of the creditor. If he be advised to resign himself to exonerate his bail, he is told that if his creditors do not proceed in such a number of terms, he can get a complete release from their power, by super∣seding their actions. This advice taken, and a release obtained, after a tedious imprisonment, he is just where he set out, and may be sued again on every debt for which he was imprisoned, which is sure to happen, if he have any thing to pay the costs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the creditor go on to execution, the prisoner is certainly locked up for life; and the instances of disease, famine, and suicide in consequence (which are apparent in more than that of JOHN SMITH and his wife, who cut their children's throats and hung themselves) prove pretty strongly that in this country a creditor may have a virtual power over the life of a debtor, in which case I do not see why he should not be like SHYLOCK, not only obliged to relinquish his demand, but forfeit a part of his own property for the service of the state. Then in vain might he retort, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nay, take my life,"</Q> and all he would be answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none!"</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>At the time LORD EFFINGHAM—with a benevolence that will reflect on him lasting honour—ineffectually, owing to the interference of the law lords, attempted a reform on this subject, he gathered together many well attested cases to strengthen his arguments, and prefaced them by saying that every case was a deep tragedy—more were in preparation for him, and one of them I know to be truth. It was this. A man in the year eighty-three, was five hundred pounds in debt. An attorney, a partner, and a bailiff, by false re∣ports, brought all his real creditors against him, and added fictitious ones, till having been in prison two years, he obtained a release upon supersedeases from debts, for which he could again be sued, and having paid upwards of six hundred pounds <HI>for law,</HI> he found himself between seven and eight hundred pounds in debt, though in the interim he had not contracted a single new one. One of these fictitious debts is worth notice. This man was arrested for a
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
debt he <HI>did not owe.</HI> The account on which it was pretended to arise having long before been liquidated—he went to trial, and obtained a verdict in his fa∣vour, the plaintiff, when an execution came to be sued out for the costs, was in prison. The defendant, therefore, was obliged to pay his own costs in this unjust action, which amounted to seventeen pounds. In short, when a man delivers himself implicitly into the hands of an attorney, there is no advantage that may not be taken of him, and with safety, for let the attorney undertake what he pleases, the client is obliged to acquiesce; and for God sake what man of common, plain understanding, unacquainted with all the different and equivocating constructions of the law, can guard against the consequences that are sure to attend even a winning <HI>cause</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A plain, well-intentioned farmer, who appeared to be blest with strong intellectual faculties, once set this matter very clear in the court of King's Bench. On a trial before LORD MANSFIELD, an action was brought to ascertain some privileges concerning the boundaries of two parishes, upon which a great deal of money was spent, to elucidate a question which was not of three-pence consequence to either party. In the course of the trial, LORD MANSFIELD having taken notice of some strong pointed observations, which had fallen from the farmer above mentioned, he begged leave to ask him a few questions, merely for information, concerning the customs of overseers, and other officers, who manage the parish money. The farmer with great chearfulness appeared ready to satisfy him, and his LORDSHIP said, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'in the course of your evidence I think you noticed that the parish money was very often impro∣perly applied—now I do not mean to insinuate that you would be likely to misuse it, but as you men∣tioned that you were once churchwarden, if you have no objection, I should wish to hear what was done with the money at that time.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my LORD,"</Q> said the farmer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the money was worse applied while I was churchwarden than ever I knew it in my life."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Indeed!'</Q> said his LORDSHIP, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I should be glad to know how.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, my LORD,"</Q> said the farmer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'll tell you. A gentle∣man, who had lived some time among us, went into Yorkshire, where he died. In his will he be∣queathed about an hundred and twenty pounds to the poor of our parish. We appiied for it often and often, but 'twould not do—the executors and the lawyers, and one or another, were glad enough to keep the money in their hands; for you know, my LORD, 'tis an old saying that might can overcome right. Well, we did not know what to do, and I came to your LORDSHIP for advice. You were then COUNSELLOR MURRAY. I remember, my LORD, you advised us to file a bill in Chancery. We did so; and, after throwing a great deal of good money after bad, we got, I think they call it, a decree; and such a decree it was that, when all expences were paid, I reckon we were about an hundred and seventy-five pounds out of pocket. Now, my LORD, I leave you to judge whether the parish money was not likely to be worse employed while I was churchwarden, than ever I knew it before."</Q></NOTE> what then must be a losing one?

Look at the common expences of the most trifling trial, and see what fortune can make a stand against going often to law.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM MANCHESTER I returned to SHEFFIELD, where, on the following week, this TOUR was put to press—the dates of the letters will shew how much of it was at that time written. Having inspected the first sixty-four pages, which—except one or two half sheets—is all I have had opportunity to examine, I went to LEEDS; where, with the advantage of LADY MEXBOROUGH's name, I had a very good night at the assembly-room, on Monday February the eleventh. My friend WARBURTON also acquainted me it was very much the wish of Mr. FAWKES that I might have another night at YORK. This, I confess, I had no great relish for; but knowing well the powerful influence of Mr. FAWKES, and how much the inhabitants of that dull region are obliged to the taste and fashionable elegance of Mrs. FAWKES, for teaching them how to distinguish what ought to amuse them, and set them examples of polished manners and finished good breeding, I did myself the honour to call on that gentleman, who assuring me his utmost in∣terest should be used to make a night worth my while, it was fixed for Thurs∣day February the twenty-eighth; and in the interim, I went on to DURHAM and NEWCASTLE. Passing DURHAM, I arrived at NEWCASTLE on Friday the fifteenth; and the next day, after delivering a recommendatory letter to a gentleman of some consequence, who, like the Irishman at BATH, promised
<PB N="243" REF="250"/>
GREAT THINGS and did <HI>nothing,</HI> I waited on the <HI>Mayor,</HI> and began my attack in form. I performed four times with very nearly as bad success as at MANCHESTER. The kind way, however, in which Mr. HODGSON, the printer, testified his concern for what he was pleased to think want of taste in the people of NEWCASTLE was truly flattering and obliging. He put a para∣graph in his newspaper to induce a better attendance, and he was indefatigable in promoting the subscription. I here thank him for his handsome and gen∣tlemanly treatment of me.</P>
<P>I had trifled away ten days at NEWCASTLE, when I was determined to repass DURHAM, and get on to YORK. For this purpose I set-out on Sunday the twenty-fourth, but the weather being remarkably disagreeable, I went no farther than DURHAM that night; and, having seen Mr. EBDON, the organist of the Cathedral, whose candid and <HI>untheoretical</HI> sentiments greatly pleased me, I resolved—as I had to play with my time till the following Thursday—that I would stay and see what Monday night would produce. It not only greatly exceeded my expectations, but I was entreated to perform a second time, which turned out to be nearly as productive as the first.</P>
<P>During the time I was at DURHAM, I had many kindnesses shewn me, which I would more particularly notice but that my TOUR is hastening to its close. Those that were public I received from Dr. COOPER—which has been a fortunate name to me—Mr. BIRD, Mr. SMITH, and several others whose names are in the list of subscribers; the private ones, from Mr. EBDON—for I never acknowledge any thing as kindness but what is meant as an unaffected intention to please and oblige. As to familiarity, unnecessary and ill-assumed consequence, and invitations to dinner, merely to sport a sideboard, it never yet had any attractions for me, and therefore, if any person at DURHAM should recognize this for the portrait of his conduct, let it be a secret between him and me—but let him also endeavour to persuade himself that every man who ac∣cepts his acquaintance upon those terms laughs at him in his sleeve.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251"/>Master HOULT, at the <HI>Red Lion,</HI> seemed anxious to be celebrated in this TOUR. I am willing to tell the truth, which I dare say is all he desires. He appeared very anxious to please, and undertook to give his sister at NORTHAL∣LERTON a caution how she treated me on my return, as that lady had been so accommodating on my road to DURHAM from YORK, to put me into a damp bed. What the caution was I will not pretend to say, but certainly she gave me horses that knocked up between NORTHALLERTON and EASINGWOULD; as to himself, he saw I had two tolerable nights, and thought, I suppose, he had a right to his share of them—for having left the bargain concerning the room to a sort of eventual decision, though there could be no such virtual con∣struction put on it, he adhered to his bond as rigidly as SHYLOCK. I had a part of the TOUR with me, which he read, and I remember appeared charmed with my account of JEMMY WALLIS, at NEWARK. If he conceived he me∣rited a similar panegyric, he will now see he and I are of different opinions.</P>
<P>On my return to YORK, the business of Thursday night was so spoken of, that I really thought, out of compliment to the lady who had taken so much pains—and in obliging whom the inhabitants, by the way, would have paid themselves a compliment—that I should have found reason to change my tone. I remember it was suggested to me that I should be obliged to re∣write that letter where, speaking of cities, I put YORK in so unfavourable a point of view. Not a bit. The night, though it proved to the clearest de∣monstration the weight and consequence of Mrs. FAWKES's name, only con∣firmed me the stronger in my belief of their general shabbiness, for I had not a promiscuous audience, but a <HI>party</HI> of <HI>ninety-nine persons,</HI> which is an astonishing number to be brought through one interest to an assembly-room in the country.</P>
<P>A very extraordinary adventure happened to me at this time. A decent man came into the parlour in which I was sitting at the Inn, and after the most confused, unconnected preface that can be imagined, told me I had been
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
innocently the cause of injuring him with the people of YORK. I begged to know how, and he informed me that his business in that place was to deliver an entertainment somewhat similar to mine, but that of course he was silenced by my arrival. He then entered into a description of his distresses, in most pathetic language, calling himself a ruined clergyman, saying he was driven to the last despair, and that he had frequently been on the point of shooting himself; at length, calling me out of the room, he said the smallest trifle would be of infinite service to him, and entreated I would lend him <HI>half a crown.</HI> This I gave him without hesitation, and at his request also a ticket for the performance, and he went his way. When I came to examine his bills, I found them so worded that he might have been mistaken for me. He had followed exactly in my track, and announced nothing more than that the gen∣tleman who had some time before, at such and such a town, given his <HI>Read∣ings</HI> and <HI>Music,</HI> meant to repeat that entertainment; and I afterwards learnt, that at HULL and BEVERLY, he entertained his audience with nothing more than the same lively picture of his distresses, till they consented to go home, and leave their money behind them.</P>
<P>I should not have mentioned this here, or at all—especially the business of the <HI>half crown</HI>—had not Mr. BLANCHARD, the printer—who is another of my favourites—come soon after into the room, when upon giving directions for some bills on the morrow, something induced him to notice that there was a strange kind of man who had made some application to him to print bills—<Q REND="inline">"but,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he made use of an odd recommendation, for he said he was in the greatest distress."</Q> In short, listening to Mr. BLANCHARD's account, I heard every word that had just been repeated to me by the ruined clergyman, which ended with the old request of the half crown, which was of course given to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brings to my recollection an anecdote of Dr. JOHNSON, which has certainly escaped all his biographers, though it be nevertheless truth—at least if I may believe Dr. GOLDSMITH, who told me so on the very day that he said it happened. GOLDSMITH, and DAVIS, the bookseller, called one morning on Dr. JOHNSON, and found him in company of a man, not only very worthless in his cha∣racter, but one who had been forward in abusing the doctor himself. They saw him, as this man went away, put something in his hand—upon which GOLDSMITH expostulated with him, saying, no won∣der such vipers got a living when they could be fostered by the very hand they wounded, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Fie, doctor,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'this man is one of the most infamous rascals that ever existed.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have nothing, sir,"</Q> said the doctor, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to do with the man's <HI>vices</HI>—he asked me for <HI>half a crown,</HI> and I <HI>gave it him.</HI>"</Q></NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> said Mr. BLANCHARD, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I should have let the half

crown business die, had I not afterwards had reason to believe he is an im∣postor of some consequence—for a very little time after I saw him bowling along in a post chaise alone, and having the curiosity to ask the landlord where he baited whither he was going, I found the chaise was to take him <HI>twenty-two miles.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This gentleman attended at the room, and what became of him ulti∣mately I know not, but he was certainly taken out by some man he had swindled, and who had followed him from another town.</P>
<P>Thus after having been so frequently taken for an impostor myself, I at last met with a person who was really one; and this <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"petty larceny ras∣cal,"</Q> after all, was probably in many places more respected. Here I recal to mind your kind letter now printed, and the several friendly remarks you have since made—all which convince me how much credit I do myself in so often assuring you that I am,</P>

<Q>"<HI>Hail dear retirement!</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING returned to SHEFFIELD, and given di∣rections for advertising three nights at LIVERPOOL, I repaired thither, and ar∣rived on Tuesday the fourth of March. As I necessarily passed through MANCHESTER, I thought I might as well make some enquiry concerning the subscription, which would of course set me to rights as to the attention that had been paid me in my absence. Finding, as I before represented, that not a single name had been added to the list, I thought it would be a folly to see MANCHESTER any more.</P>
<P>At LIVERPOOL—the only place in all my <HI>tour</HI> to which I <HI>returned</HI> to any good purpose—I had six handsome nights, taking the average of them, and it gave me pleasure to announce that I should finish my career in that spirited town. My reception was certainly flattering to an excess—if I could have dined in ten places at once,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LIVERPOOL is remarkable of course for fine turtle. A gentleman who is well known for dis∣tinguishing the best morsels, received two cards of invitation, to dinc on a turtle, the same day, at the same hour. After balancing for some time which he should accept, he determined to dine at both places. To manage this, he waited on the stewards of one feast, and represented what an awkward hour they had chosen for their dinner—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What an absurdity,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to dine at <HI>three o'clock</HI>; peo∣ple who are on business all the morning will be starved; besides, all the world is getting into early hours now."</Q> The stewards, in short, consented to have the dinner at <HI>two.</HI> This point gained, he posted away to the other stewards—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good God,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what could possess you to appoint your dinner at <HI>three o'clock?</HI>—we shan't have done upon 'Change—our appetites won't be half up—be∣sides, how unfashionable!—all the world is getting into late hours. In short, when people meet at a feast business is over, and therefore you should always have it as late as you can."</Q> Here also he carried his point. Repairing to the dinner at <HI>two o'clock,</HI> he stuffed unmercifully—when having pre∣viously ordered himself to be called out, he went home, took an emetic, and appeared in high spirits at the other feast, which had, to oblige him, been appointed at <HI>sour.</HI> To keep my consistency, how∣ever, perfectly clear, this gentleman is not a <HI>merchant</HI>—but a <HI>physician.</HI></NOTE> I should have been welcome, and indeed
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
kindness of this sort came so thick, that I was obliged to decline all invitations, lest I should be incapacitated from affording that entertainment for which pur∣pose I went among them.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the eleventh, I attended at their concert, and declare that I heard two acts from the <HI>Messiah</HI> performed much more respectably than I could have conceived. Mr. MEREDITH and Miss HARWOOD are known to have much merit in this style of singing. Mr. WILTON's precision and care in leading the band cannot be too much praised; and Mr. WAINWRIGHT conducted the chorusses in a very able and spirited style, and also, in a very delicate way, gave us the second of HANDEL's concertos. I have already no∣ticed how expert the singers of YORKSHIRE and LANCASHIRE are at chorusses. Those who performed them the night I speak of at LIVERPOOL, did HAN∣DEL as much credit as if they had been drilled by Mr. JOAH BATES, which between seven and eight hundred persons who were present can testify.</P>
<P>Were I to speak fully of the attention paid me at LIVERPOOL, I should have nothing else to say. As, therefore, those who were so forward to please and serve me are the least conscious of it—the whole sum of their kindness being no more than the common exercise of that liberality which so remark∣ably characterises them—I must content myself with feeling that which I can∣not properly describe.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="256"/>I quitted LIVERPOOL on Friday the fourteenth of March, having the night before exhibited myself as a public character for the <HI>last time,</HI> passed on through BIRMINGHAM, in my way to BRISTOL, whither I went on pri∣vate business, spent three or four days with my friend BOYTON, and finally, arrived in LONDON on Saturday the twenty-second.</P>
<P>My running account of places, inns, &amp;c. and a few more gleanings, will now wind up my TOUR—previous to which, however, I shall go into the business of my negociation with Mr. HARRIS, and endeavour to account for its failure. This I shall enter upon in my next letter. That done, my last remarks on the subject of music will naturally introduce a statement of my pieces, and the profits which arose from them. Thus every letter will lessen the frequency—though never the pleasure—with which I assure you I am</P>

<Q><L>"<HI>—Time was when my approach</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Had made a little holiday.</HI></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU already know the nature of my application to Mr. HARRIS, in March, 1787, and the substance of the answer I received. From YORK, in the following October, I sent that gentleman a musical farce, telling him that I had a first-piece nearly ready, and three other after-pieces, which in a very short time I could perfect, and also some good materials for pantomimes.</P>
<P>I will confess to you, that I chose to send the piece I set the least store by first—for I have, unfortunately, upon these occasions, a sort of <HI>pre-senti∣ment,</HI> and my feelings at that time, I am free to declare, did not very much lead me to place any great faith in Mr. HARRIS's sincerity. It was however a farce that, as times go, <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> need not have been ashamed of. Mr. HARRIS returned one act of it, saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was taken from the French, and like Sir JOHN VANBRUGH's <HI>Country House,</HI> therefore it would not do; but that whenever I would send any thing <HI>completed,</HI> that would be of service to the theatre, he should be glad to treat with me; but not for hints, or de∣tached music, for that they were crowded with unappropriated music, by
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
the <HI>best composers.</HI>"</Q> I wrote him an answer to his letter, saying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I should be glad of <HI>the other act of the farce</HI>—that I was sorry he thought indifferently of it—that I certainly took partly the idea of it from a French piece, but I had not literally translated a single speech; nor had I ever read VANBRUGH's <HI>Country House,</HI> therefore it could not be so like either as to make his objection a substantial one; for it was very easy to shew from whence almost every piece that had appeared for some years was taken, and one might venture to add, the same of those which would appear for some years to come. I went on saying, that I hoped he and I should agree better on what I should next send. I begged however that he would explain himself in one point. If he meant by the word <HI>completed,</HI> that he expected me to send music, as well as words, I certainly could not consent to it, as I thought I ought to be con∣sidered as perfectly competent to decide on its merits myself—that I desired fairly and honourably to be understood to mean exactly what I had asserted that I was going to INDIA, and wished very much to leave something behind me, to have my fame remembered—for which I should never stand candidate again. I said, that when I wrote to him, some years ago, on the same subject, he thought that <HI>hints,</HI> or <HI>any thing else</HI> from ME, would be valuable to him, and that I really did not believe my rivals had since given him rea∣son to alter his opinion. I had a variety of materials which would certainly be useful, and indeed he must think so, otherwise why <HI>crowd</HI> his theatre with <HI>unappropriated music</HI>—for I flattered myself I had no right to be consi∣dered as an <HI>inferior</HI> master. In short, I told him, if he thought I could leave him nothing that would be of advantage to him, it would be a folly for us to have a single moment's further trouble on the subject.'</Q></P>
<P>This was the substance of my letter; to which, at GRANTHAM, five weeks afterwards, I received an answer, and the second act of the farce.</P>
<P>Mr. HARRIS said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was sorry I had the trouble of sending again for the second act—it had been mislaid by an accident."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="259"/><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He had only to repeat to me, that any work I might send completed, should be read with attention, and without delay, and if found likely to suc∣ceed, he should readily treat with me for the purchase of it—but not for any unappropriated or detached music."</Q></P>
<P>This letter determined me to let nothing out of my hand till I had come at a fair explanation of the word <HI>completed,</HI> and to do this, I once more wrote to Mr. HARRIS, telling him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that till he should please to explain that word matters must stand in <HI>statu quo,</HI> for that I could not consent to send music for <HI>inspection.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having received no answer to this letter, not even when I arrived in LONDON, the first thing I did was to take my final leave of Mr. HARRIS, in a letter, a copy of which shall be transcribed for your perusal, after I have once more subscribed myself</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. <HI>AN ADIEU TO THE THEATRE.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now lay before you my letter to Mr. HARRIS.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To THOMAS HARRIS, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have waited three months—which is something more than good manners allows—for an answer to my last letter; but as that qua∣lity makes no part in the <HI>etiquette</HI> of a MANAGER, your silence excites in me no wonder. It speaks, however, pretty emphatically, and tells me—which I really did not think in this instance—that you have been near a twelve-month laughing at me. In the month of March last, I wrote to you of∣fering to sale such materials as I had by me or could finish before I should quit ENGLAND. You encouraged me, in answer, to send either panto∣mimes, first-pieces, or after-pieces, <HI>completed.</HI> Of this indefinite expression I have since repeatedly entreated an explanation, telling you, that if you ex∣pected me to send music for inspection, I could not agree to it—nor would, I believe, any man in his senses advise me. The only answer I have re∣ceived from you is, a reiteration of the word, without any elucidation of it; and upon my pressing you, three months ago, for a <HI>final</HI> answer, you
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
think proper to drop all correspondence with me. I shall therefore take the liberty, in this letter—which you will be charmed to hear is the last you will receive from me—to say that it is impossible but you must have a pre∣determined resolution not to accept any thing of mine.</P>
<P>Had I gone upon the extensive sense of the word completed, I must have sent you models for pantomimes, as well as the stories and the music—and to what end? To have had my pains requited by a refusal, and hints taken from the materials. Not by you however. I acquit you of any such idea—but your people, barren of genius, would have been happy to catch at any thing original. As to music—I must have been mad to have sent any—that would have been a glorious feast indeed for your compilers—still with∣out your knowledge; for they would find no difficulty in passing it on you for theirs. I once imposed on you as <HI>completely,</HI> though not so <HI>nefariously,</HI> myself. I certainly, the first season after I returned from FRANCE, took a particular pleasure in implicitly complying with every request you made me; and this is, I suppose, what you meant when, at the end of that sea∣son, you said something very handsomely in a letter of my <HI>zeal</HI> for the in∣terests of the THEATRE. During the getting up of the <HI>Touchstone,</HI> you desired me to remove a tune, and make a new one in its stead. It was my full intention to have been as complaisant in this instance as the rest, but having an engagement, I forgot it till the next morning. There being no time to get it ready, when I came to the THEATRE, before the rehearsal, and in FOULES's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The copist.</NOTE> room, I made some trifling alteration in the accompani∣ments, and marked the tune to be played a tone higher;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I frequently did this with GARRICK—for why should one be dictated to by the absurd observa∣tions of men without cars, who give unnecessary trouble to shew their own consequence.</NOTE> as to the melody there was not a note altered, and every body but yourself knew it to be the same tune. Thus, <HI>their</HI> remarks that it was better—meaning the alteration—<HI>your</HI> coinciding with them—thinking it a new tune—and <HI>my</HI> acquiescence
<PB N="255" REF="262"/>
with both, made as good an equivoque as ever Mr. O'KEEFE introduced into any of his pieces.</P>
<P>You <HI>must</HI> have known that I meant not to have sent you music subject to inspection, but that you should take it upon my promise that it would be original, and the best I could make. Nay, I particularly marked, that in what I left behind me, I should look to my professional fame in the strictest manner. Upon this footing, you certainly did not think proper to receive my productions—otherwise you would not have trifled with me.</P>
<P>The conclusion is, you either think my abilities impaired, or that I have not now so much <HI>zeal</HI> for the interest of the THEATRE as I had ten years ago.</P>
<P>'Tis evident I cannot now write any thing to please you, for you return every thing I send you; whereas, formerly—and I can shew your own hand writing to prove it—you admit the merit of six pieces sent at one time—all of which it is true had success.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the statement of pieces.</NOTE></P>
<P>Will not the world be apt to think that the decay is rather in your judg∣ment than in my abilities? You very well <HI>know,</HI> and I believe have <HI>al∣lowed</HI> that I have as little of arrogance, as to my productions, as any man; and yet I cannot but be alive to what I hear every day. It has been my good fortune, in the course of the last twelvemonth, to see the public a lit∣tle face to face, and it happens to have been that part of the public which in great measure makes up your boxes—and they assure me, to an indivi∣dual, that I greatly improve both as an author and a composer; you will, therefore, excuse me, if I rather credit my benefactors than you.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="263"/>This allowed, it can be nothing more than that, in your opinion, my <HI>zeal</HI> for the interest of the THEATRE <HI>slackened.</HI> If vamping up old mat∣ter by giving it a new face; if introducing stale, hackneyed tunes and pas∣sages to the disgrace of taste, and the total exclusion of genius and origina∣lity; or if a servile obedience to the <HI>ipse dixit</HI> of the manager, against the evidence of plain reason and common sense, be <HI>zeal</HI> for the interest of the the THEATRE—away with such zeal—I'll have none on't!—and for this I believe I shall again be praised by the public.</P>
<P>I should not have written this letter, but have let the whole business die away—for it otherwise had been scarcely worth a thought—had I not been accused, by many opulent and respectable characters, of having in some way so deported myself as to have made it impossible for MANAGERS to treat with me, otherwise I could not set up as an excuse for going to IN∣DIA my having been driven from the THEATRE.</P>
<P>I am sure you will allow that I have fairly stated the matter, and that there is nothing between us but a difference of opinion concerning the meaning of a very common word, which, like TOUCHSTONE's <HI>if,</HI> has so operated as to prevent any thing coming of our negociation; in the course of which we have both acted in our situations: <HI>I</HI> have, as dependants should, entreated—and <HI>you</HI> have not deigned to answer.</P>
<P>My time, therefore, being so short as to make all accommodation impossible—and indeed were it longer nothing should shake my resolution of having done with the THEATRE—I shall finish this letter—which I dare say has sufficiently tired you—with a most serious and solemn assurance that, as a man, I have and ever had the highest respect for you—that I have to thank you for a thousand instances of attention and politeness, and the part of your conduct wherein I had only to consider you as a private gentleman
<PB N="257" REF="264"/>
was ever handsome and manly; and this opinion you may remember I felt and professed, at the very moment those around you falslely persuaded you I had written a libel against you.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pamphlet was published in the year 1782, called <HI>Coalition,</HI> or <HI>Theatrical Monopoly,</HI> I really know not which. It abused Mr. HARRIS, and I was said to be the author. Mr. HARRIS was unde∣ceived, and behaved very handsomely upon it. Some of his privy counsellors however <HI>now</HI> are the same who were <HI>then.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Feeling these sentiments, let me conjure you as a manager, to open your eyes—banish every thing from your stage that can check the growth of genius—let not quaintness, tricks, and shifts, usurp the place of <HI>weeping taste</HI> and <HI>desponding originality!</HI> In short, with the MANAGER blend the MAN—so shall judgment rear its fostering standard, and COVENT-GARDEN be no longer the fountain of caprice, but the source of real merit.</P>
<P>Yet think not, in this arrangement, I affect to include myself—for I declare upon my veracity, and let the world judge of its validity as I adhere to the declararion or recede from it, that half the profits of your THEATRE should not bribe me to return. I am sure never was the post of honour more a privater station than at present.</P>
<P>Sir, Adieu.——Though I have considered it as a duty incumbent on me to write you this letter, be assured I do not mean it in any respect to breathe rancour. You have seen how I make the distinction; and I once more as∣sure you that, as a <HI>man</HI> and a <HI>gentleman,</HI> you have not in the world a truer advocate, or a sincerer well-wisher than</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="258" REF="265"/>This matter has thus terminated, and through you I give to the public a strong fact—which is worth a thousand arguments. As a proof that every man who thinks independently must lay his account to having no concern with the THEATRE, Mr. SHERIDAN has the boldness to say in <HI>The Critic,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that very few go through the fatigue of thinking for themselves."</Q> If so, we have only to lament that stage manoeuvres are not as <HI>honest</HI> as they are IN∣GENIOUS, and that the first dramatic writer of the day holds out fallacy as the principal ingredient in a theatrical composition. That he has as little of ori∣ginality in the plots of his pieces as Mr. CUMBERLAND—against whom he seems to head the whole force of his satire—is certain. I do not mean howe∣ver to accuse him of imbecility—he has genius equal to any thing; but the generality of English audiences have been so used to <HI>cayenne</HI> and <HI>high cookery,</HI> that he knew plain nature would stand no chance among them. He is how∣ever the only man who has ventured to impose upon them, and tell them so in the same breath; but the English have such a redundancy of good nature, that if a man arrogates a superiority, supporting his pretensions at the same time with any formidable shew of ability, their characteristic benevolence is at once appealed to, and they implicitly give him credit for the very merit he asssures them he possesses.</P>
<P>Thus, men who have the constancy and resolution to climb any given height, atchieve the task they have set themselves, by adding perseverance and intrepidity to strong intellectual endowments, strengthened by intense, wary, and correct observation. There is however a want of feeling in this—'tis a sort of poaching for fame—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"while the fair hunter's cheated of his prey."</Q> I know you think it a sort of dramatic sacrilege to attack the works of Mr. SHERIDAN, and this will, in my next letter, put me upon a cursory view of them; for if I were capable of advancing any thing I could not prove, I should be unworthy your friendship, and have told you a falsity every time I have asserted that</P>

<Q>"<HI>One man may steal a horse better than another look over the hedge.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Few words on Mr. SHERIDAN's dramatic works, and adieu to the <HI>Theatre</HI>—except such circumstances relative to it as will ne∣cessarily come out in my statement of pieces.</P>
<P><HI>The Rivals</HI> has had the least success, and yet it is the most original of all his pieces. It was nearly damned on the first night, and Mr. SHERIDAN—profiting by the experience with which its reception furnished him—withdrew it with this remark. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have now got the <HI>last,</HI> and it shall be my fault if I don't make the shoe to fit next time."</Q> His labour however being only cobler's work, it required too much of method for his volatile genius to buckle to, and we may venture to pronounce, without any great outrage on probability, that had not Mr. SHERIDAN so much influence in the <HI>theatre, The Rivals</HI> would never have made its appearance a <HI>second season.</HI> It is a neat, well written piece, but has that sort of cold correctness which will not go to the galleries. The incident, from <HI>The Nut-brown Maid,</HI> though written with great sweetness and delicacy, is no more proper for the <HI>theatre</HI> than the fine strokes of a miniature painter would be in the finishing of flats and wings.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267"/>All this perhaps inducing Mr. SHERIDAN to think with the chairman in relation to POPE, he produced <HI>The Duenna</HI>—where there is not a single new situation from beginning to end. The whole plot of turning the daughter out of doors, and passing the maid for the mistress, is conjointly the <HI>Scicelienne</HI> of MOLIERE and <HI>Il Filosofo di campagna</HI>—where every circumstance is to be found, from the serenade at the beginning to the marriage at the end. The other plot is <HI>The Wonder</HI>—which, the moment it is told, must be obvious to every body—because every body knows both pieces. Not even any single subordi∣nate circumstance is original. <HI>Father Paul</HI> is MARMONTEL's <HI>Philosophe soi disant</HI>—who, as he eats delicacies, talks of the roots of the earth—and, as he drinks burgundy, praises the wholesome chrystal stream. The dialogue is by no means brilliant; but Mr. SHERIDAN was determined it should penetrate every where, and in particular the <HI>aside</HI> speeches of <HI>Isaac</HI>—shewing beforehand how clearly he shall himself be taken in by his different attempts to deceive others, is the most artful species of anticipation that ever was practised, and shews a judgment of theatrical effect powerful, new, and extraordinary.</P>
<P><HI>The School for Scandal</HI> is no more original than <HI>The Duenna.</HI> The <HI>school</HI> itself is CONGREVE's <HI>Cabal,</HI> and the play may fairly be called a sequel to <HI>The Way of the World.</HI> The scandal has all been detailed in different pieces, but principally in <HI>The Plain Dealer.</HI> When in NOVEL, <HI>Lord Plausible, Olivia,</HI> and <HI>Eliza,</HI> will be found <HI>Sir Benjamin Crab, Lady Sneerwell,</HI> and <HI>Mrs. Can∣dour.</HI> The brothers have been in a variety of things, from <HI>The Adelphi</HI> to Mr. CUMBERLAND's <HI>Fashionable Folly</HI>—but the <HI>Squire of Alsatia</HI> on the stage, and <HI>Blifil</HI> and <HI>Tom Jones</HI> in the closet, are the closest resemblances. The uncle lately returned from abroad, and introduced to the drunken company, is ex∣tremely like the <HI>The Intriguing Chambermaid.</HI> The circumstance of the uncle's picture is in a French piece called <HI>L'ecole de la Jeunesse</HI>; and <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Lady Teazle</HI>—are <HI>Constant</HI> and <HI>Lady Brute.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="268"/>Mr. SHERIDAN has said that there is not a new character or incident—and all that can be done is to take old matter and give it a novel appearance. Had he said that it is safer to do so, I would join with him; for certainly when any thing comes in contact with the imagination that has been before familiar, or rather congenial to it, without consideration, we give credit for its merit on the spot, whatever we may do upon reflection—and having once praised a thing, a false pride prevents us from discovering that we were de∣ceived. The dialogue of this piece is as accommodating as the rest of it. Mr. HERON points out the tinsel scattered up and down by way of sentiments, which, by the theatrical people, are known by the name of <HI>clap traps</HI>; and Mr. SHERIDAN cannot take it amiss, if in justice to his abilities and our own discernment, one is obliged to say, that he can—whenever he pleases, write ten times better.</P>
<P>The <HI>Monody,</HI> which seems written expressly to desire all the world to <HI>forget</HI> GARRICK, has again very little of originality in it. LLOYD's <HI>Actor</HI> furnished the outline, in addition to which Mr. SHERIDAN certainly has touched in some beautiful strokes; but, after all, it is but a sketch, and much more likely to be forgotten than him whose memory it laboriously professes to prove ought to be buried with his ashes. My great quarrel with Mr. SHERIDAN in this business is, that he has with great skill and ability spoken of all the arts, except <HI>music.</HI> He has shewn that the same of the statuary is most perfect when the statues themselves are broken to pieces—that RAPHAEL and SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS are cotemporaries,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I once saw, at Blenheim-house, what would make this line pass for satire. It was a portrait of the DUCHESS OF MALBOROUGH and her CHILD, in which the colours were all flown, by the side of the VIRGIN and our SAVIOUR, by RAPHAEL, in which the tints were in as high preservation as if it had not been painted six months.</NOTE> and that these arts are subordinate to <HI>poetry</HI>; but he has not once even hinted that there is any such study as music—to which, I insist upon it, none of the arts are superior. I beg to ask Mr. SHE∣RIDAN a question. Does he believe if—added to his own consummate know∣ledge of stage effect—he could borrow the pen of SHAKESPEARE, and by
<PB N="261" REF="269" MS="y"/>
blending such talents, form a play beyond all conception the most perfect: that ever graced a theatre, that the audience would not—spite of their anxious sus∣pence—spite of their bruised hides in crowding to the house—hiss down the curtain, if they were deprived of the first music. But indeed whatever may be the conscious haughtiness with which this gentleman may think proper to look down on an art, to which I hope he owes no grudge, he had good sense enough to court its alliance before he thought proper to put his <HI>dramatic</HI> fame to a <HI>second</HI> trial.</P>
<P><HI>The Critic</HI> is surely nothing equal, as a satire, to <HI>Tom Thumb</HI>—and when we talk of <HI>The Rehearsal,</HI> it sinks to nothing. FIELDING and BUCKINGHAM have taken in the whole round of tragedy, and properly conceived that DRY∣DEN, LEE, and the old standards, were fair game. What has Mr. SHERI∣DAN done? Why truly, except indeed where he chuses to ridicule SHAKES∣PEARE—which, by the bye, I do not think an English audience would have suffered in any body else—he has exposed the puerile, modern stuff, which if it be deficient in merit, he—as a manager—must bear his share of reprehension for obtruding it on the public. The business of <HI>Sir Plagiary</HI> is severe enough; but, unfortunately, the very words he intends should give the deepest wound, recoils on himself—for they are a <HI>plagiary. Puff,</HI> is full of pointed observa∣tion, but that part of the piece is the first instance—as I before observed—where an audience have quietly sat down and consented to be laughed at by an author. As to the drift of the piece, it appears to be written with a view alone to dis∣courage writers of tragedy; for there is no possible situation that can excite pi∣ty, terror, or any of those passions which it is the business of tragedy pecu∣liarly to call forth, but this work, which <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"professes to be critical,"</Q> attempts to laugh at—and really not always with success; for, if figure and imagery may at all be introduced in this species of writing, the criticism itself is more an object of ridicule than the thing it professes to criticise. In short, I defy Mr. SHERIDAN himself to write a tragedy so as to steer clear of his own lash; and how absurd must a man appear who provides a castigation for himself!
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
The matter relative to the clock, at the beginning of <HI>The Duenna,</HI> shews evi∣dently that he is vulnerable, as well as his neighbours; and as the circum∣stance goes to a reprobation of the unities, it were as modest to propose some better criterion before he invited us to explode the admitted standard: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but one man may steal a horse better than another look over the hedge,"</Q> says the old proverb. Mr. SHERIDAN can write in any style, and to any degree of perfection he pleases, but his public writing, like his public speaking, is more <HI>catching</HI> than CAPTIVATING; it <HI>dazzles,</HI> but does not IMPRESS—it <HI>charms,</HI> but does not CONVINCE. In short, as that gentleman's aim is popu∣larity, he does every thing for the moment, and it is a question, after he has sunk into ease and independance, from his natural indolence of mind, whether he will ever again be known but by a few eminent trifles written to grace the private cabinet, and make up the <HI>delices</HI> of the elegant and euridite.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN having most probably done with the stage, as an author, it is but fair to examine how far, in that capacity, he has been an acquisition to the public; and when we consider that he has deprived the world of the best singer, beyond all comparison, that we have ever heard, it is very doubt∣ful whether what he has given be adequate to what he has taken away—and, admitting this, the public would rather have gained than lost had Mr. SHE∣RIDAN originally kept to politics, and have had nothing to do with the theatre.</P>
<P>This gentleman, from his earliest youth, resolved to be at the top of his profession, be it what it might. May his integrity equal his abilities, and there is no situation but he will adorn!</P>

<EPIGRAPH>

<L>"<HI>They sung no more, or only sung his fame.</HI>"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FINDING in LONDON the musical world up in arms at what they had heard concerning this book, I cannot resume the subject better than by taking them while they are warm. I am only sorry the small re∣maining portion of room which I can dedicate to this subject will prevent me from going into it so fully as I could wish—for it is prolific, and cannot, for the sake of the public, be too closely inspected.</P>
<P>I have advanced that PURCEL had a <HI>stronger mind</HI> than HANDEL, and that had ARNE been encouraged, he would have been a greater man. At the time PURCEL lived, music was in its infancy in this kingdom, and all the perfection composers had an idea of, was to shackle themselves with rules, and thus they dared not give way to the brilliancy of their genius—for there was as much good sense in this practise as there would be in tying a man's legs to make him run the faster—but where, in spite of dull custom, the ima∣gination of PURCEL beamed forth. It had a majesty and a resulgence, like the sun breaking from a cloud. How beautiful is that heavenly bit, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I call you all to WODEN's hall!"</Q> What a bar or two will be found in, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let not a moon-born elf!"</Q> Can any thing, for exquisite simplicity and sweet∣ness,
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
exceed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lovely isle?"</Q> Nor will I go out of this very piece to prove my position relative to HANDEL. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, if you dare, the trumpet sounds,"</Q> gives me a fine opportunity to throw down my gauntlet, and I challenge all the world to shew me any thing in music that can go beyond it. HANDEL had a glorious opportunity, had it been possible; but, in his attempt to excel it, he has fallen to an immense distance indeed. The words for both are written by DRYDEN, and those which HANDEL set, for grandeur, has the pre-emi∣nence: one runs
<Q><L>"Come—if you dare—the trumpet sounds,</L>
<L>"Come—if you dare—the foe rebounds;</L>
<L>"We come, we come, we come,</L>
<L>"Says the double, double beat of the thundering drum."</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot correctly remember the remainder—but this will be enough for my purpose: the other words are,
<Q><L>"The trumpet's loud clangour</L>
<L>"Excites us to arms,</L>
<L>"With shrill notes of anger</L>
<L>"And mortal alarms;</L>
<L>"The double, double, double beat</L>
<L>"Of the thund'ring drum</L>
<L>"Cries, hark! the foes come;</L>
<L>"Charge, charge, 'tis too late to retreat."</L></Q></P>
<P>PURCEL's expression, is one great, soul-felt effusion of simple sublimity; and as it ever will be the case with great minds, at the same time that these few bold notes carry us to the rough manners of the court of King ARTHUR, there is a natural ease and irresistable grace in them that will vainly be imitated by all the studied polish of the Italian school; and indeed so strongly from ge∣nius did PURCEL possess that symmetry in fancy, which—like the native dig∣nity of some forms—cannot in any position be ungraceful, that the very error Dr. BURNEY reprobates in HANDEL—which he qualifies, by the bye, saying that it was not reformed till <HI>lately</HI>—is here in PURCEL, who lived in ruder
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
times, better than <HI>corrected</HI>—it is <HI>avoided</HI>; for his great conception—while others <HI>labour</HI> to improve <HI>nature</HI> into <HI>ease</HI>—derived <HI>ease</HI> from <HI>nature.</HI> What I allude to is, the accommodating the melody of the capacity of the trumpets—which HANDEL scarcely ever does—and surely there is something like barren∣ness of invention in this. But to examine what HANDEL has done with the other words—and here I am afraid integrity obliges us to say he has servilely imitated PURCEL. I say servilely, because the time and the construction is the same, but—like a clumsy translation—the literal intention is barely pre∣served, and all the beauty and correctness left out. Indeed the curious mode of accenting the beginning of every bar—for it runs thus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The <HI>trumpets</HI> loud <HI>clangour excites</HI> us to <HI>arms,</HI>"</Q> the <HI>lovely</HI> introduction of the <HI>fourth</HI> for the trumpet, and the lameness of the double beat of <HI>the</HI> thundering drum—though thundering happens to be of three syllables, and thus there can be no excuse for it—shews that though HANDEL came <HI>after</HI> PURCEL—which is ad∣mitted to be an advantage—it was in such a <HI>hobbling</HI> kind of way, and he was at such a distance, that he never was able to come up to him. The words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Charge, 'tis too late to retreat,"</Q> though they are materially hurt by the continuation of that bastard kind of minuet which accompanies them through∣out, have much of HANDEL's natural grandeur which certainly characterized him, wherever he is helped out by instruments, but which seems perpetually to forsake him when the <HI>voice</HI> should convey the MIND.</P>
<P>PURCEL—though probably very unconscious that he had successfully challenged all the world to excel him—follows up <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come—if you dare,"</Q> with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To arms,"</Q> which harmony HANDEL has twenty times played upon, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Britons strike home"</Q>—and if any man will shew me a superior selec∣tion from any one piece composed by HANDEL—as no man is more open to conviction—I will confess that PURCEL and I are conquered.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER is said to have emulated ACHILLES, and CHARLES XII. ALEXANDER. It has also been remarked that SPENCER had only the
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
ANCIENTS to consult—DRYDEN the ANCIENTS and SPENCER—and POPE all these—and that we may by deduction pronounce that SPENCER was the greatest <HI>poet,</HI> DRYDEN the <HI>next,</HI> and POPE the <HI>most inferior.</HI> It is certain whatever DRYDEN and POPE have come in contact—witness, for example, the <HI>Ode on St. Cecilia's day</HI> and <HI>Alexander's feast</HI>—POPE has constantly been worsted, and probably all the fancy in DRYDEN's works together bear no pro∣portion to the wonderful imagery in the teeming imagination of SPENCER; let me therefore be allowed, when I speak of PURCEL, the time in which he lived, the little information he could have gathered from what went before him, and the many discouragements he laboured under, and I am not afraid but every man who has the candour to take up my arguments upon this liberal ground, will allow me that this wonderful composer had a <HI>stronger mind</HI> than HANDEL.</P>
<P>My next task will be to prove my position in relation to ARNE, and this I shall endeavour to do in my next letter. In the mean time, I cannot either introduce <HI>that</HI> or finish <HI>this</HI> better than by remarking, that when ARNE came to alter the music of King ARTHUR for <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> with that good sense and philanthropy of which no man possessed a larger share—though he introduced some charming things—so far from mutilating PURCEL, as a modern compiler would have done, with proper reverence for such great abilities, his whole study was to place his idolized predecessor in that conspicuous situation, the brilliancy of his reputation demanded; for ARNE—and I well know it—had as much of the harmony of <HI>humanity,</HI> as of <HI>sounds.</HI> His latter excellence I am now going to examine. Give me however an agreeable relaxation, by suffer∣ing me once more to repeat that I am</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF any of the lovers of HANDEL were to open this book exactly at this page, they would think it was written in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and immediately, pitying the poor maniac of an author, shrug up their shoulders, and lay it down. As to their opinions, whose minds are shut against convic∣tion, I am perfectly indifferent—but I will not let them pass without remark∣ing, that those who admire one man of genius to the exclusion of all others, must naturally possess such narrow, contracted sentiments, that their very blandishments are tainted with poison, and destroy that reputation they profess to cherish.</P>
<P>I start ARNE against HANDEL, by saying that HANDEL has not produced a piece so complete, from first to last, as <HI>Comus.</HI> As a man of <HI>genius,</HI> by in∣finite degrees, <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI> is HANDEL's best work; and I will venture to say, but for that piece, he could not have borne that great rank, notwith∣standing all that has been vaunted of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> among men who know <HI>really</HI> how to distinguish. <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI> contains a number of beautiful me∣lodies; and what lists it into great consequence is, that the subject is every
<PB N="269" REF="276"/>
where <HI>pastoral,</HI> and yet HANDEL has contrived, without injuring it, to make it every where <HI>different.</HI> Even <HI>Polypheme</HI> and the <HI>octave flute</HI> are <HI>con∣sistently</HI> coupled together. The famous trio, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The flocks shall leave the mountains,"</Q> is a composition replete with sweetness and expression, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wretched lovers,"</Q> is an astonishing chorus. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hush! ye pretty warbling quire,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Love in her eyes,"</Q> are delicately pretty, though if there were not so great a maze of modulation in the latter, it would be more pleasing. In short, there is prodigious merit in <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> and yet I am not afraid but ARNE can stand fairly up to his competitor. I would not wish to match my HERO with a <HI>pigmy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Comus</HI> has one character as well as <HI>Acis and Galatea</HI>; and the <HI>bacchana∣lian revels</HI> of ARNE is every where <HI>equal</HI> to the <HI>pastoral simplicity</HI> of HANDEL, and in many places SUPERIOR. ARNE has diversified his subjects, and in a very peculiar way given them a <HI>masculine</HI> and a <HI>feminine</HI> colouring. Among the first are, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When Phoebus sinketh in the west,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By the gaily circling glass,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fly swiftly ye minutes,"</Q> and several others; and amongst the latter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By dimpled brook,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Would you taste the noontide air,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, bid adieu to fear,"</Q> and many more. Nay, he has contrived to <HI>blend</HI> this colouring in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Live and love, enjoy the fair,"</Q> which is a most happy com∣position indeed, and fairly equal, in its kind, to <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The flocks shall leave the mountains."</Q> All these songs are full of rich and pleasing melody, and in them there is not a superfluous note. There ARNE takes the lead of HANDEL—because music does not want alone fancy to <HI>conceive,</HI> but judgment to <HI>com∣plete</HI> it; and in many of the songs of <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Shepherd what art thou pursuing,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Consider fond shepherd,"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cease to beauty,"</Q> and some others, the subject is <HI>worked</HI> on, till the ear can bear it no longer, and the composer seeming to be aware of this lassitude, takes his advantage of it, and comes any how to a close while the stupor prevails, that so the hearer may not with precision judge of his desects.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="277"/>So far, <HI>Comus</HI> is at least upon a par with <HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> and when we call in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor on beds,"</Q> that heavenly melody, so greatly conceived, so delicately pursued, and so exquisitely finished—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"On every hill,"</Q> which is a species of pastoral music peculiar to ARNE, and being in a minor key, and consequently of a more primitive nature, especially as its simplicity appeals wonderfully to the heart, may be said to be superior to any other. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sweet echo,"</Q> which <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"takes the rapt soul and laps it in elysium,"</Q> and many of inferior kind, such as that pretty song, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By the rushy, fringed bank,"</Q> there can be no doubt but <HI>Comus</HI> is a greater effort of genius than <HI>Acis and Galatea.</HI></P>
<P>But there are more complete pieces to assist this argument. <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> is a most powerful performance—there the <HI>hearer</HI> may be gratified with every style of serious music, and yet the whole is managed with such judgment—which outgoes Mr. SHERIDAN—that though perfectly in nature, the <HI>stage boxes</HI> are not more satisfied than the <HI>upper galleries.</HI></P>
<P>If we search further, we shall find <HI>Judith,</HI> an oratorio, that does honour to English genius—where we may see sacred ideas, without burlesque accom∣paniments—sweet air and forcible expression—capital songs, perfectly <HI>vocal</HI>—and astonishingly brilliant <HI>chorusses,</HI> without a <HI>fugue.</HI></P>
<P>If we have still to shew—for I would willingly satisfy every body—whe∣ther ARNE knew music <HI>scientifically,</HI> I'll beg leave to instance the chorusses in <HI>Abel,</HI> which, it must be admitted, explore the regions of harmony with a lati∣tude as bold and as masterly as any thing in music. And now I think, if ARNE had been equally patronized with HANDEL; if he had not been obliged to hu∣mour managers; to consult the caprice of actors and actresses; to witness the arrogance of Italians, whose base metal became a fashion, while his sterling coin was disregarded; to do jobs for now and then twenty guineas; and dance attendance at catch clubs to make up an annual benefit, he would have had better reason to think himself properly encouraged, and perhaps been stimu∣lated
<PB N="271" REF="278"/>
to the accomplishment of various other works, for which his exalted ge∣nius so eminently qualified him. This alone has made him apparently inferior to HANDEL, and this induced him to keep within the limits of his mediocre situation, contenting himself by the exercise of his own cheerful and even temper, with that precarious pittance which is too often allotted to real merit in this country.</P>
<P>Certainly ARNE's faults were <HI>few</HI>—HANDEL's <HI>innumerable</HI>; and when we consider that HANDEL composed when he was in the humour, and to please <HI>himself</HI>—ARNE when he could get a job, and to please his <HI>employer</HI>; that HANDEL was rich, and ARNE was poor—our wonder ought rather to be, that he left so many and such admirable compositions behind him. But DRY∣DEN is said to have been prevented from writing an epic poem by his engage∣ment with the theatres, which obliged him to write four plays in a year; and thus are we constantly deprived of the best efforts of English genius by lavish∣ing that on foreigners—who laugh at us—which is so honourably due to our own countrymen.</P>
<P>My next letter will speak of teaching—which will be all I shall have oc∣casion to say <HI>generally</HI> of music. I am charmed that I have opened your eyes relative to Mr. SHERIDAN. ARNE is a favourite of yours, and therefore this last task has not been so hard. I hope you believe me just to every body; is I were not so, I should not deserve the pleasure with which I subscribe my∣self,</P>

<Q>"<HI>Reform it altogether.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Shall now speak of that mystery by which so many young ladies, at a great expence, in the course of seven years, attain the supreme felicity of exposing themselves by playing MALBROOK out of tune, and hammering out unmeaning, progressive lessons, by which the taste of whole families is vitiated, through the ignorance of mere strummers and octave players, through which the foundation of genius is sapped and de∣stroyed, and through which pretenders to a liberal profession—mere <HI>quacks</HI>—are lifted into consequence, and permitted to vilify and <HI>traduce</HI> those produc∣tions they have not the taste and judgment to <HI>understand.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>teacher</HI> nurses a <HI>scholar</HI> as an <HI>apothecary</HI> does a <HI>patient</HI>; and a <HI>slow se∣ver</HI> and a <HI>dunce</HI> are much about upon a par: it is not the intention that one should <HI>recover,</HI> or the other <HI>improve</HI>—the business is to keep them in hand as long as possible; and if a <HI>robust constitution</HI> in one, and <HI>strong intellects</HI> in the other, manifest signs of <HI>health</HI> or <HI>merit,</HI> 'tis wonderful to what shifts the poor devils are put—to curb <HI>nature,</HI> in order to swell out the bill.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="280" MS="y"/>Good teachers—like good lawyers—are very scarce. Those who are really good ones, will first of all inculcate the principles of music to a certain degree, prove those principles in every possible manner, and strongly root their efficacy in the scholar's mind—and nothing in nature, to men of real inge∣nuity, is easier than this.</P>
<P><HI>Bad</HI> teachers swarm all over the kingdom, and their practice is to their scholars immediately to the instrument, to explain nothing but as it oc∣curs, to make a mystery of every thing, and at length—some wilfully, and others out of ignorance—to confirm in their scholars so many bad habits and perplexities, that they are further from the real mark when they leave off, than when they began.</P>
<P>A third sort of teachers—who are certainly bad ones too, but not so mischievous—are those who go about every thing scientifically, and teach <HI>thorough bass, fugue, and counterpoint,</HI> instead of <HI>Foot's minuet.</HI> One of these had taken a young lady in hand, and taught her, in the course of three quar∣ters of a year, every possible situation of the sixth, and fourth, and common chord. Dr. MILLER and <HI>I</HI> had a laugh about this, for we calculated that, taking in all the concords and discords, with their proper and inverted rela∣tions, this young lady might entertain lively hopes, in the course of two and thirty years and a half, of accompanying a concerto.</P>
<P>Both sorts of <HI>bad</HI> teachers do equal mischief—for those who wilfully im∣pose on parents, decry the works of genius <HI>out of envy,</HI> as much as the other description <HI>out of ignorance</HI>; and the consequent evils are, the loss of time and expence, and the introduction of bad taste. From this last abuse springs half the musical folly for which this country is so celebrated, which, like Vesuvius, is frequently breaking out, bearing down taste, genius, and every cultivated object in its way; for whether a human voice an octave above a
<PB N="274" REF="281"/>
blackbird—a French-horn that plays every thing but what is natural to it—a fugue, or an Irish jig—a double drum, or a bagpipe—be the object, this monster, this devourer, rages like the <HI>Minotaur,</HI> and taste is the bleeding sa∣crifice devoted to appease his ravages. Alas, that some musical Theseus would but destroy this pest, and rid our country of its barbarism! But a clue to the labyrinth where it is concealed, will hardly be found while there are so many to participate the golden fleece.</P>
<P>There is no coming to the end of this subject, especially circumscribed as I am. I can therefore only say, in addition to the above remarks, that a practical knowledge of music, as far as it can be necessary for common pur∣poses, is very easily attained; for it consists of nothing more than learning the gamut—the names, lengths, divisions, and measure of the notes—distinc∣tions of all the major and minor keys—the situations of the semitones, and the doctrine of using the sharp seventh to modulate into the fifth of the key, and the flat seventh to return to the original key. These, with all colateral matters, are nothing like so difficult as the first four rules of arithmetic, with the fractions relative to them; and yet, upon the same principle that Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division comprehend the whole study of figures, so do these rules in music comprehend the whole system of harmony; and all there is more to be done is, to blend, separate, diversify, and in short, use them in every possible point of view. Let not a scholar then learn more than this, let it be learnt perfect, and then put in practice—which done, it is a thousand to one—if there is any genius to assist study—but the whole science will lay clearly open to view:—if it should not, by the union of what has been learnt, it may be easily attained; and it would be as absurd to teach music upon any other plan, as to set a sum in the <HI>Rule of three</HI> for a scholar who had not learnt his Numeration Table.</P>
<P>With all this, great care must be used in the choice of a master; and as to teachers decrying good music, and introducing false taste, I see no cure for
<PB N="275" REF="282"/>
this but my former rule, which is—let no man subscribe to the <HI>goodness</HI> of any music that is not <HI>pleasing.</HI> It would be good indeed if it were as pleasing as the sensation I feel when I repeat to you that I am,</P>

<P>I have mentioned already the opulence and populousness of LEEDS, and shall take my final leave of the inhabitants as a spirited, manly, and enlight∣ened people, who have the industry to get money, and the liberality to spend it, It has two very large cloth-halls, and the assembly-room is by far the handsomest I saw in my tour, for a single room.</P>
<P>HALIFAX is an astonishing trading town for its size. I saw the cloth-hall on a market day, and it gave me an idea of a bee-hive; the prodigious number of cells, and the porters coming in and out with their bundles of cloth, were exactly the loaded bees. The parish contains twelve chapels of ease, and is said to be worth about twelve hundred a year.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284"/>MANCHESTER is a charming town, and I have seen nothing superior to <HI>Mosely-street,</HI> but <HI>Portland-square.</HI> The number of people on a market day is astonishing, and the entrance into the town from STOCKPORT—which is to MAN∣CHESTER what WOLVERHAMPTON is to BIRMINGHAM—is very magnificent. The choir in the Collegiate church is beautiful, and the progress of the ma∣nufactories, and in particular the cutting fustians, and passing even the finest muslins over a red hot iron, are matters astonishingly curious, and which, if time permitted, I should have great pleasure in dwelling on.</P>
<P>LIVERPOOL is beyond all question the first town in the kingdom after LONDON; its capacious docks, its roomy storehouses, its entensive and well-filled harbour, the prodigious plenty in its markets, particularly of corn—its spacious squares, its magnificent public buildings, of which the Change is a most capital one—its churches, and indeed all that great variety of edifices for duty, business, and pleasure, to which by act of parliament they are now making considerable additions, abundantly prove the truth of this assertion. I did not see the theatre at MANCHESTER, but that at LIVERPOOL, which is altering upon an admirable plan, under the direction of Mr. TAYLOR, is spa∣cious, convenient, and handsome. I counted in the directory nearly an hun∣dred streets, and this circumstance obliges me again to speak disadvantageously of MANCHESTER, which place has, unlike LIVERPOOL, neither <HI>directory</HI> nor <HI>hackney coaches.</HI></P>
<P>DURHAM, in summer, must be one of the most beautiful situations in ENGLAND. The river, the castle, the cathedral, the bishop's palace, and the straggling suburbs, present you with a new and picturesque view wherever you turn. It is remarkable for a good choir of singers; indeed the salaries are higher here than any where, and in consequence—for encouragement wonderfully nurtures genius—our concerts have been well stocked from thence. The more genteel part of the inhabitants are more a community than a neighbourhood, a family than a society.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="285"/>NEWCASTLE is ancient and romantic, and the inhabitants seem to relish of both. They give you an idea of a man who piques himself on his birth and extraction, though his mansion is mouldering and his estate falling to de∣cay. I do not mean to say that NEWCASTLE is not rich—it is remarkably so, and I am informed hospitable. However, there must be a manner with me—it is not the size of the dish, but the style in which it is dressed; not the number of eatables, but the mode of their being put on the table; and, after all, it is not the wine, but the conversation that accompanies it. NEW∣CASTLE seems to have very little taste. There is a new and remarkably handsome <HI>theatre,</HI> which is a hobby-horse at present, and will, in all proba∣bility, be thrown away next year for some other bawble. In short—for I am always obliged to have recourse to LIVERPOOL when I would make an advantageous comparison—NEWCASTLE is proud, LIVERPOOL industrious—NEWCASTLE is near, LIVERPOOL liberal—and one may pretty well conclude, that if they did not dig their riches out of the bowels of the earth, and un∣load them in the river Thames, they would not count on their riches; for they would never have the spirit and courage to adventure for them, with any degree of intrepidity, to the farthest corner of the world. The road from YORK to DARLINGTON is beautiful. It is a heavy stage from DAR∣LINGTON to DURHAM, and, on account of the hills, still heavier from DUR∣HAM to NEWCASTLE.</P>
<P>For the inns I must go back again to BIRMINGHAM, where there are several good ones, but all immoderately dear. At LICHFIELD, which is in the public road from LONDON to LIVERPOOL, they are pretty good and to∣lerably reasonable. At DERBY much better for accommodations, but much the same as to their charge. At NOTTINGHAM, the <HI>Blackamoor's Head</HI> is an inn where travellers will be shewn every civility, get good entertainment and accommodation, and upon moderate terms. I have spoken of NEWARK.—At LINCOLN I would recommend the <HI>Spread Eagle,</HI> which is a decent, civil house, and reasonable. At BARTON, where it may sometimes happen that
<PB N="279" REF="286"/>
you are obliged to stay several hours, and where you generally arrive wet from HULL, there is but one miserable inn, the smallest accommodation or any thing decent by way of eating and drinking. BAKER's, at HULL, is a very good inn—and so is the <HI>Tyger,</HI> at BEVERLY At YORK, and every where in the north road, there are good inns, but in general very dear—the <HI>Angel,</HI> at DONCASTER, in particular. At LEEDS there is not a real good inn in the town. At HALIFAX they are not remarkable for appearance, but they are for decent neatness, and good eatables and drinkables, and the lowest charges any where in Yorkshire. At WAKEFIELD, the <HI>Stratford Arms</HI> is a very good inn, and they pay you attention, and charge pretty reasonable. At MANCHESTER there is not a single good inn, and the treatment is insolent beyond description—at least where I have been. Only see the gradation—at HALIFAX I paid <HI>four</HI> shillings for the same tea, supper, and breakfast, which at DONCASTER cost me <HI>nine,</HI> and at MANCHESTER <HI>thirteen</HI>;—but this last was at the <HI>Hotel,</HI> which exactly gives you the idea of a bagnio in LONDON.—This <HI>Hotel</HI> belongs to the man who keeps the <HI>Bull's Head,</HI> at which house I had a room, and an indifferent one for the performance, yet were my friends under a necessity of asking it as a sort of favour, though the man was hand∣somely paid, and the accommodations were very contemptible indeed. As to DIXON, at the <HI>Swan,</HI> the last time I was at MANCHESTER I was from seven o'clock in the morning till eleven getting away in a post-chaise, and during that time, having a letter to seal and a parcel to tie up, after—in the course of an hour and a half—intreating the favour of a wafer and a bit of pack thread; I was at length obliged to go to a shop to buy it, and the man told me he did not wonder at it, for it was a remark that the innkeepers of MANCHES∣TER spit in people's faces in return for their favours. As far as my experience goes, this usage extends also to lodging-houses. Every body knows where I lodged at MANCHESTER, and I paid there for board and lodging full <HI>four times</HI> as much as I was charged at LIVERPOOL for <HI>better living.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I did not think, when I was most shamefully imposed upon in FRANCE, I should have an op∣portunity of celebrating a more scandalous piece of knavery in ENGLAND. At NANCY, in LORRAINE I lodged in the house of a Mr. VILLEMETTE, and having experienced a few of their tricks, I had pre∣viously determined to be on my guard. I paid him at the end of every week, and took his receipt. When I came to a final settlement, he gave me the week's receipt as usual, but begged I would settle the remainder. I asked what he meant, for that I had paid him every thing. He said it was true that I had paid him every thing, supposing our agreement to have been in money of LORRAINE, but that it had been in money of FRANCE, and, reckoning the difference of the currency, I was then in his debt just thireen guineas. I answered that fortunately I knew so much of their laws as to be well convinced that all bargains were good only for money of LORRAINE, unless made before two witnesses: this he said he had taken care of, and immediately produced the witnesses, whom I had never seen before. I saw I was to be tricked, and asked them if they would go before the general of the police, and swear it. VOLUNTIER MONSIEUR, was the answer. I put them to the test, and they swallowed the oath with all the calmness imaginable. I asked the general of the police what he thought of the business: he said he knew them all to be infamous scoundrels, that it was a pity I could not stay to do myself justice; but if I would leave ten guineas in his hand, he had no doubt but he should give me a good account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>siness. I however contented myself with my first loss, and went away without even thanking the ge∣neral of the police for his politeness.—The imposition at MANCHESTER was proportionably more shameful than this.</NOTE> The inns
<PB N="280" REF="287" MS="y"/>
at LIVERPOOL are pretty rich, and therefore of course pretty consequential. Master FORSHAR, in particular, whose room I had, has a good deal of con∣sequence, but he has an idea of respect, and would be the first to reprove his waiters for the smallest incivility to strangers. As to their charges, the diligence took me to the <HI>Cross Keys,</HI> where I was very comfortable for a day or two, upon very reasonable terms. The roads in Lancashire are, in gene∣ral very sandy and bad, but this is sometimes remedied by paving them, and in great part of Yorkshire there is a stone causeway, which is a very agree∣able recommendation to foot passengers.</P>
<P>Leaving all these, and ceasing at once to be a public character, I arrived in TOWN, as I told you, where the first news that I heard was, that GRI∣MALDI, that incendiary by whom was bred so much of my public uneasi∣ness, that viper who bit me because I fostered him, was no more. Perhaps it is a good omen—and having completed my resolution of quitting all thea∣trical pursuits, in which it is plain I could not hope for prosperity, the ma∣lignant fiend has ceased his detestable influence. He has not living left his
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
equal—for if fifty ABURNOTS were to lend their assistance, they could not write an epitaph expressive of him whose corrupt heart harboured more vice than could reside in the soul of fifty CHARTERISES.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I could not refrain from writing a few lines on the death of this monster, and I was induced to do it by being informed that just before he died, he said the devil was waiting for him, and that he knew he was going to hell; and yet had the wretch an idea of being spoken of after his death. He said <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh I go the Devil, and if any body write 'bout me, let them finitch—alas poor Grim!"</Q><Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">
<HEAD>EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<L>GRIMALDI's gone—were we to say at rest,</L>
<L>'Twere to make truth, what he was wont—a jest.</L>
<L>Internally convuls'd, AETNA will roar,</L>
<L>And storm-swell'd seas lash the affrighted shore;</L>
<L>So conscience struck—spent his pestiferous breath,</L>
<L>Yet shall he fear "that something after death."</L>
<L>He's gone—nor more on holy rites can trample—</L>
<L>"To guilty minds a terrible example"—</L>
<L>Fiends, as they catch him, tear him limb from limb,</L>
<L>'Till e'en the devil cries—<HI>alas poor Grim!</HI></L>
</LG></Q></NOTE>
See how my plot winds up! The monster is dead that obstructed my former fortune—in my next I shall introduce the guardian spirit, whose benign goodness has sent me smiling hope to protect my fortune in future.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT had long been my ambition to bring out this work under the protection of the PRINCE OF WALES. For this purpose I solicited the kindest and most generous friend I have, who frequently has the honour of being where his ROYAL HIGHNESS visits, to do what he could with propriety to procure me this high and flattering advantage. Indefatiga∣ble to oblige and serve me, he did not let the matter rest a single moment, but watching the first opportunity to mention it with proper decorum; the PRINCE, with all that amiable affability which ever distinguishes the truly noble, condescendingly signified a wish to see me.</P>
<P>By his ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious appointment, I had the great honour, at the house of a gentleman where my kind friend is very intimate, of playing and singing in his presence those songs with which—not less as a correct and per∣fect judge of music, than of nature, expression, and discrimination—I thought he was most likely to be entertained; and though I did not perform fewer than twen∣ty, I had the singular satisfaction to find I did nothing but what received perfect approbation, nor for nearly two hours did the time seem to wear—even tho'
<PB N="283" REF="290" MS="y"/>
MARCHESI had, during the interval, made his first appearance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The PRINCE did not get to the <HI>Opera</HI> till twenty minutes before <HI>ten o'clock.</HI></NOTE> at the <HI>Opera,</HI> and vainly looked round for this illustrious auditor, who, at that moment, was perhaps paying the tribute of a sigh to the memory of poor JACK RATLIN, or regretting the unhappy fate of the worn out race horse.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I must take the liberty to mention, that his ROYAL HIGHNESS, upon my singing the <HI>Race Horse,</HI> informed the company, that he had fortunately, about a fortnight before, rescued a poor old half blind race horse from the galling shafts of a hakney post-chaise.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, 'twas a princely act."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>My friend took an opportunity, before the PRINCE retired, to request the honour of his name to my subscription; to which his ROYAL HIGHNESS thought proper to answer <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I might use his name in any way that I thought would be of service to me."</Q> No terms can convey a panegyric adequate to this noble condescension; what could induce it but that true greatness of mind which, as PORTIA says of mercy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"becomes the throned monarch better than his crown."</Q> But the genial sun cherishes not more the <HI>spread∣ing</HI> ROSE than the <HI>humble</HI> VIOLET.</P>
<P>Having this honourable and flattering <HI>Carte blanche,</HI> my first wish I own was a <HI>dedication</HI>; but, upon considering how many of these sort of ad∣dresses teem with such ridiculous hyperbole and fulsome adulation, as would make one think they attempted to <HI>satyrize</HI> that PATRONAGE they professed to <HI>solicit</HI>—though never did opportunity occur where flattery was so impossible—I thought an <HI>inscription</HI>—for what with such a name is not an advantage—would be most adviseable, and I could then give a latitude to those <HI>feelings,</HI> in a letter to you, which addressed to the ROYAL PERSONAGE from whose bounty I have the happiness to derive them, could not, without wounding respect, have been dressed in terms forcible enough for the purpose; nor indeed, with this scope, do I flatter myself with perfect success—for the real language of a susceptible heart never yet found its way to the pen.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="291"/>Yet I cannot finish without a word or two more on this generous sub∣ject. In this TOUR will be found many noble and illustrious persons, with whom I have had the honour to converse. I have, in that warmth which truth alone inspired, spoken of these in terms of praise, and I do not, upon recollection, repent of any syllable to this effect. I have seen courtly breeding in FRANCE—I have ever made it my particular felicity to notice the talents of ingenious men—but I confidently declare that all I have wit∣nessed sinks into nothing before the object of my present panegyric. In de∣portment, never was there such an union of <HI>ease, grace,</HI> and <HI>dignity,</HI> as in the PRINCE OF WALES. His manners are <HI>gentle, mild,</HI> and <HI>affable,</HI> or as SHAKESPEARE has it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"sweet as summer"</Q>—and yet always PRINCELY.—His observations are <HI>keen</HI> and <HI>penetrating</HI>; his intellectual intelligence <HI>strong, diffusive,</HI> and <HI>refined</HI>; his information <HI>select</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI>; in short, that beau∣tiful picture in which HAMLET paints the mental as well as the personal per∣fections of his father, never called for application so strongly as in the present instance; for if ever <HI>countenance, form, manner,</HI> and <HI>understanding</HI> are to be relied on, those of this ILLUSTRIOUS YOUTH clearly point him out as the <HI>protector, benefactor,</HI> and FRIEND of MANKIND.</P>
<P>But I must force myself from this indulgent employment, lest <HI>that</HI> should become <HI>disrespect</HI> which ought to be <HI>humility</HI>—for who can trust the effusions of a HEAD full of <HI>praise</HI> and a HEART full of <HI>gratitude!</HI></P>
<P>With these auspicious feelings I finish my TOUR, and beg you to be∣lieve that I am now, as ever,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I shall now, as faithfully as my memory will permit me, proceed to state the success, both in profit and reputation, of every piece I have produced to the public. I am afraid, however, I shall not be very ac∣curate in my account of the more subordinate kind; for were I to be put to the torture, I could not enumerate some of the interludes and pantomimes which have been done at <HI>Sadler's Wells</HI> and some other places; nor can I place those I do recollect in accurate order, as to their dates; I shall, how∣ever, be as correct as possible, and where my intelligence is uncertain, I will myself sustain the loss rather than fill up the blank by exaggeration.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Shepherd's Artifice,</HI> performed in May 1762, and 1763. This piece, which I wrote and composed at <HI>seventeen,</HI> was only got up for my own benefit. It has a thousand faults, and in particular, as at that time I did not know how to put my musical thoughts upon paper but by mere strength of imagination, 'tis impossible to describe the number of its inaccuracies. These however the same force of fancy enabled me to correct, and, without any as∣sistance, I produced the same piece in a perfect state, by only listening to the faults as I heard them in the band. It was performed at two of my benefits,
<PB N="286" REF="293" MS="y"/>
and each time brought a tolerable house—but it never came forward in the com∣mon business of the <HI>theatre.</HI> The music was very much applauded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will not here be improper to remark that I never learnt more of music than the gamut and the table which points out the division of the time. Mr. FUSSEL, the organist of WINCHESTER cathe∣dral, I am told, says I owe my musical education to him—which assertion contains so much truth, that five or six very common tunes, which I now have in his hand writing, are all I ever was taught. Mr. KENT had afterwards the credit of having taught me—but, except some anthems which he composed for me, and which I learnt by ear, I never received the smallest instruction from him. The music I have was strongly in my mind from my earliest remembrance, and I do not think any master would have been of the smallest service to me. It lay quietly, a hidden spark—which, in the country, found nothing to vivify it—but, coming in contact with that proper fuel for it, the different musical per∣formances in town, it at once expanded, and nothing could keep it within bounds. I scarcely knew this myself till being present at a rehearsal of <HI>Thomas and Sally,</HI> all that past so tenaciously adhered to my memory, that I went home, drew out a score, and, after attending another rehearsal, filled up the accompanyments. It was certainly incorrect—but, for such an effort, in a very trifling degree; for I was not then sixteen. I found, however, I was in the secret, and immediately took the concertos of CORRELLI, in single parts, and put them into score. Here I went, upon good authority, through every turning and twining in the labyrinth of harmony. I next got hold of RAMEAU, and having proved theoretically by one, and practically by the other, the difference between passing and emphatic notes—the nature of supposed basses—and found, by a fair trial of these matters in every point of view, that two chords comprehend the whole system of harmony, I determined fearlessly to give a loose to my fancy:—to what purpose is pretty well known.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Love in the City,</HI> performed in the year 1764—a piece written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and performed but six nights. In this I composed the <HI>overture,</HI> the <HI>firste horus,</HI> the <HI>finales</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second acts,</HI> and three songs. <HI>Love in the City</HI> has since been altered into the farce of the <HI>Romp,</HI> in which the <HI>chorus,</HI> the <HI>quintetto,</HI> the <HI>boxing trio,</HI> and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear me how I long to be married,"</Q> are mine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot here omit an anecdote which tells greatly to the honour of Dr. ARNE. SIMPSON, the hautboy player, and some others persuaded Mr. BEARD t at my music would do his theatre discredit, and that in particular the overture and a song beginning <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah why my dear,"</Q> were written entirely against the <HI>rules of harmony.</HI> This Mr. BEARD—who had more goodnature than any other quality in the world—was easily brought to believe. Hearing what was going forward, I took the copy of the overture and song and prevailed on honest TOMMY BAKER—whom all the world knows—to accompany me, waited on Dr. ARNE. The Doctor, after looking carefully over the scores, said there was nothing against the rules of harmony, that it was a pity Mr. SIMPSON would not stick to his hautboy, without pretending to judge of what he was not at all acquainted with, and that if I would privately inform him when there was to be another rehearsal, he would himself attend. This I sailed not to do—and finding those pieces altered by some other person, the Doctor begged to hear the original copies. These were pro∣duced, and played over, when he pronounced the whole business a scandalous attempt to injure the repu∣tation of a young man, whom, if they had had any liberality, it would have been their duty to encou∣rage. In consequence of the Doctor's decision, my music was restored and performed with success.</NOTE> This music I made Mr. BICKERSTAFF a present of.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="287" REF="294"/>3 <HI>Lionel and Clarissa</HI>—written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and performed in the season of 1767 and 1768. By looking at the index it will be seen that, from first to last, I composed for this piece about twenty-five things, for which trouble I received, at different times, forty-eight pounds—giving up the copy∣right. The sale of this music did not yield much, till it came out under the title of <HI>The School for Fathers</HI>; otherwise I think I should not have been so completely overreached in the following agreement.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 <HI>The Padlock</HI>—written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and performed at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> in October 1768. The success of this piece is pretty well known all over the kingdom; it may not, however, be amiss to mention that no con∣ception can be formed of the sale of the music. <HI>Comus</HI> is known to have sold very extensively, but after upwards of thirty years, three fourths of the ori∣ginal plates are still in use. What then will be said when I assure the public the <HI>Padlock</HI> had, <HI>seven</HI> years ago, nearly worn out three entire sets! But how will their wonder be augmented when I declare, upon the faith of a man, that I never received, in the whole, for composing that music, but forty-five pounds; though I dare say the sale of the music alone yielded Mr. BICKERSTAFF nearly five hundred pounds. In addition to this, his benefit yielded two hundred pounds, Mr. GARRICK made him a present of one hun∣dred pounds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been some times a private compact from <HI>managers</HI> to <HI>authors</HI> to give an extra benefit on the twentieth night of a piece. Mr. RICH introduced this custom in a very handsome way. On the twentieth performance of <HI>Miss in her Teens,</HI> GARRICK, when he received the bills in the morning found the farce advertised, without any previous notice, for the benefit of its author, which was him∣self. In the instance of the <HI>Padlock,</HI> he gave Mr. BICKERSTAFF his choice of an extra benefit or an hundred pounds.</NOTE> and the words must have also been greatly productive, for he
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
kept the copyright—and, twelve years ago, there had been upwards of twenty three thousand copies sold. My agreement, however, was made before the piece came out, and I conceived his recommendation of me to Mr. GARRICK, in the light of a great obligation; whereas, had I not been the stupidest of all idiots, I might have seen that my being pinned to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> upon such <HI>easy terms,</HI> was a matter concerted between them. I hate to think of it—therefore, let me pause, and bring myself into temper, by assuring you that I am</ITEM>

<P>PLEASE to go on with me.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>5 <HI>The Maid the Mistress</HI>—performed in the summer of 1769, at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF. Having made an agreement that season to compose for <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and occasionally sing, for which trouble I was to have an hundred guineas, this piece comes within that article, and the music has never yet been published.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6 <HI>The Recruiting Serjeant</HI>—performed the same season, on the same terms. I published the music on my own account, and found it unsuccessful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7 <HI>The Jubilee</HI>—written by Mr. GARRICK, and performed in October 1769. It would be an endless task to go through the variety of circumstances which distinguish this memorable business; but nothing deserves notice more truly than that SHAKESPEAR might have laid very quietly in STRATFORD church—nobody would have disturbed his ashes—had not such a popular measure been the probable means of insuring a plentiful harvest to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
on the following season. And yet, it was <HI>managed</HI> with so much caution, so much wariness, that, according to the representation of the matter to every body who was concerned in it, there did not appear any such thing in agita∣tion. This cautiousness answered two purposes—it not only drew many to STRATFORD who would otherwise have suspended their curiosity till they should see it in LONDON, but it served as a feasible excuse for requesting every body's trouble and attendance for nothing. Thus, among the rest, I took unwearied pains—not seeing that I should materially assist in filling the coffers of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> treasury—without any emolument to myself. All this, however, I could have forgiven, if I had not been obliged to sustain fifty hu∣miliations. I will venture to say that had it not been for <HI>my</HI> music the audience would have shewn much more dissatisfaction. They were not in very good humour as it was. They heard certainly Dr. ARNE's beautiful Oratorio of <HI>Judith,</HI> and his charming music of the Ode—and what was the most exqui∣site and inexpressible treat that ever transcendent abilities could convey, or longing ears experience, they heard GARRICK repeat that Ode. Yet, being disappointed of the Pageant—being wet through at the Masquerade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The booth being built on a swamp close to the river, and nobody having considered that some∣times in the month of September it rains, the company had scarcely assembled, when the wet began to ooze through the crevices; in five minutes after they were paddling in the wet; five minutes after that it was over their shoes, and presently they were obliged to take to the benches, then to the orchestra, and then to the windows—thus there was not a creature out of about four hundred people that escaped be∣ing wet through.</NOTE>—they were certainly very much discontented; which dissatisfaction would more than silently have manifested itself, had not <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Warwickshire Lads, &amp;c."</Q> brought them into good humour:—yet was that very song privately set by Mr. AYLWARD, and the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mulberry Tree"</Q> by Dr. BOYCE, and had not my kind friend, Mr. GARRICK, been told at a rehearsal, where I was <HI>not present,</HI> that mine were set the best for effect, he would have waved all delicacy to me, and have had theirs performed. GEORGE GARRICK, who, where DAVID's immediate interest did not clash, could be just to all the world, informed me
<PB N="291" REF="298"/>
of this fact.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GEORGE GARRICK, who I have said before was warmly attached to his brother, was remark∣ably attentive to all his little whims and caprices upon this great occasion. Indeed he had so many ad∣mirable traits of real goodness that it is no wonder, partly from gratitude, partly from the amiable wor∣thiness of his heart, he should consider DAVID as a being who had a right to exact an extraordinary de∣gree of attention from every body, but particularly from him. The other, who never failed to encou∣rage adulation wherever he found it, improved the influence he had over GEORGE, till he brought it to something so very like meanness, that it could not be palliated but by the real motives to which I have ascribed it. In consequence of this slavish attention, GEORGE was always in anxiety lest in his absence his brother should have wanted him, and the first question he constantly asked on his return was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Did DAVID want me?"</Q> GEORGE GARRICK died about three months after his brother, which circum∣stance being mentioned in the green-room, and marked as something extraordinary—<Q REND="inline">"Extraordinary!"</Q> aid BANNISTER, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not at all—DAVID <HI>wanted him!</HI>"</Q></NOTE> In short, GARRICK, in relation to the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> manoeuvred every where, and with every body. He procured abuse to be inserted in the papers, which he got all his friends to answer. He enlisted a prodigious num∣ber of volunteers, whose exertions he pretty liberally extracted, at their ex∣pence; and at length performed the same entertainment ninety-five times, in one season, at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> which he sent people an hundred miles <HI>not</HI> to see. The music of the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> having sold it, previous to the performance, at STRATFORD—except some trifling part of it—yielded altogether about forty-three pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8 <HI>Damon and Phillida</HI>—the same season. This piece I was desired, by Mr. GARRICK, to alter and new set. I was told that there was no settled price for such a job, but I might make out a bill. I conceived this a good opportunity to make me amends for the trouble I had with the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> and did it cheerfully. The piece was not often performed, but before the time arrived to talk of settling for it, Mr. GARRICK proposed to enter into an article for seven years, at six pounds a week for the three first years, and seven pounds for the other four; and in making the agreement he contrived—or LACY, instructed by him, as I mentioned before—to include every thing that was yet unaccounted for; so <HI>Damon and Phillida</HI> went for nothing, except fifteen pounds, for which I sold the copyright of the music.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="292" REF="299"/>9 <HI>The Ephesian Matron</HI>—written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF. The same ar∣ticle went over to a second season at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> where this piece was performed, and under this article I composed it. The publication of this music was sold on some eventual agreement, and I think yielded me only a few pounds—but I cannot at this moment say what. This piece was performed about thirty times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10 <HI>The Brickdust-man,</HI> a little musical piece, performed at <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> written by Mr. BICKERSTAFF. This trifle had great success, and introduced an engagement which I entered into with Mr. KING, which though no great matter as to emolument, was as good as <HI>Sadlers Wells</HI> could afford, and one of the pleasantest I ever made. Indeed I am happy to have this opportunity of acknowledging my great regard and respect for this gentleman, which I hold from principle, and the result of many years experience of his manly, liberal, and uniform conduct; and he must forgive me if, feeling thus, I here make a public acknowledgment of the letter I received from him at MANCHESTER, wherein he subscribed to this book, and gave as a reason, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he should be sorry to be left out of the list of my well-wishers."</Q> This friendship, dear sir, is of the complexion of yours—for which, give me leave to say,</ITEM>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE now return to <HI>Drury-lane.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>11. <HI>The Pigmy Revels</HI>—a pantomime which was performed in the season of 1770 and 1771, with considerable success. I know not who wrote the words, I only set the music, and it produced me no emolument, as it came under my article.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12 <HI>The Wedding Ring</HI>—the season of 1771 and 1772. This piece I wrote and composed—but foreseeing the difficulties I was likely to encounter, had no intention of making myself known as the author. The world recol∣lects the ignominy with which Mr. BICKERSTAFF left this kingdom, and an invidious public print had the audacity to attribute this piece to him. Finding the attack a very serious one, I immediately made an affidavit that Mr. BICK∣ERSTAFF was <HI>not</HI> the author, and published it. This oath was called a preva∣ricating one, because it did not say <HI>who was</HI> the author, and a whole string of paragraphs of a most abusive kind were immediately levelled at me, in the same paper. I did not wait for the tedious forms of law, but endeavoured to take that sort of revenge which men perhaps imprudently endeavour to do, when the offence is beyond legal reparation. The printer however had as little <PB N="294" REF="301"/>
courage to meet my anger as he had principle in seeking to wound my charac∣ter. He left town to avoid me, and for some time was not to be seen. I therefore moved the Court of King's Bench for him to shew cause why an in∣formation should not lodge against him for printing a libel. The rule was <HI>granted,</HI> and afterwards <HI>made absolute</HI>; and there is no doubt but the gentle∣man would have been publicly exhibited, had not my attorney taken it into his head, to decamp to FRANCE with the money, which, to the great credit of the <HI>Drury-lane</HI> performers—who insisted upon taking up this attrocious matter as a public cause—was raised by a subscription among themselves to defend the action. On the first night of this piece, I was called on the stage, and required to declare the author, which I did without hesitation; and the matter taking this turn, I resolved, instead of concealing my name, always in future to an∣nounce it, and rely on the public for the event. I had a benefit for this piece over and above my article, which yielded me upwards of an hundred pounds. The publication of the music I undertook myself, and got nothing by it. In∣deed I have always made this remark, that the music I have sold has yielded but very little, except to the publishers; and that I have published on my own account has constantly brought me in debt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13 <HI>The Installation</HI>—the same season—written by Mr. GARRICK, and composed under my article. This I sold, with a set of harpsichord lessons, for a conditional sixty-five pounds. The conditions were fulfilled, and I re∣ceived the money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14 <HI>The Ladle</HI>—a little piece for <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> in the season of 1772, written and composed by me.</ITEM>
<ITEM>15 <HI>The Mischance</HI>—the same place, and also written and composed by me. For the publication of this piece, <HI>The Ladle,</HI> and <HI>The Brickdust-man,</HI> I received thirty guineas.</ITEM>
<ITEM>16 &amp; 17 Two pantomimes—the names I cannot recollect. The publi∣cation of one of these I sold for ten guineas.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="295" REF="302"/>18 <HI>The Grenadier</HI>—written for <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> the same season, by Mr. GARRICK.</ITEM>
<ITEM>19 <HI>The Widow of Abingdon</HI>—written also for <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> the same season, by Mr. HULL. All these were composed under my article. They made up the entertainment of the whole season.</ITEM>
<ITEM>20 <HI>Trip to Portsmouth</HI>—written by G. A. STEVENS, and performed at the <HI>Haymarket</HI> with good success. I received for the composition and the pub∣lication of the music nearly fifty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>21 <HI>The Deserter</HI>—altered from the French, and performed at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> in the years 1772 and 1773—the music partly retained, partly supplied from <HI>Philidor,</HI> and partly mine. For this piece I had a benefit, which yielded me about ninety pounds—the music turned out a very trifle—I got by the publica∣tion of the words about thirty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22 <HI>The Christmas Tale</HI>—written by Mr. GARRICK, and performed the same season. The intrinsic value of this composition being equal to my whole salary, I expostulated with Mr. GARRICK—who said he considered it in the same light, and I should have no reason to complain. My trouble on this oc∣casion was inconceivable, and I expected my extra reward would be propor∣tionable; but when the end of the season arrived, in the office were found two promissory notes of ten pounds each, which I had given by way of memo∣randums at two different settlements, and these were sent me by GEORGE GARRICK, as a valuable consideration for my additional trouble. The publi∣cation of the music I sold for twenty-five pounds down, twenty-five pounds on the twelfth night, twenty-five pounds on the eighteenth night, and twenty-five pounds on the twenty-<HI>fifth.</HI> The piece was performed twenty-<HI>four</HI> times.</ITEM>
<ITEM>24, 25, 26, 27, 28 &amp; 29 Two pantomimes, and four little pieces for <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> under my article.</ITEM>
<ITEM>30 A short masque in <HI>Amphytrion,</HI> in the season 1773 &amp; 1774, under my article of course. I sold this music for some trifling sum.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="296" REF="303"/>31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Two pantomimes, and four little pieces for <HI>Sad∣ler's Wells.</HI> Two of these I wrote, but though I recollect the subjects, I really do not the titles—'tis however no great matter, these six performances made up the entertainment of the season. I had nothing of consequence bid for the music, and I did not chuse to venture the publication of it on my own ac∣count.</ITEM>
<ITEM>37 <HI>The Waterman</HI>—performed the same summer, 1774, at the <HI>Hay∣market.</HI> The success of this piece is well known. The benefit yielded me but thirty-five pounds. The publication of the words about forty-eight, and the music I believe about thirty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>38 <HI>The Cobler</HI>—performed in the season 1774 and 1775. Mr. GARRICK would insist upon having this piece. I had taken to him <HI>The Seraglio,</HI> which was afterwards performed at <HI>Covent Garden</HI>—and which if I had been on the spot I am convinced would have had better success—but he had conceived great displeasure at my bringing out <HI>The Waterman</HI> at the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> though under different pretences he refused to perform it himself, and therefore I must write, he said, a direct <HI>farce,</HI> and nothing else, which the more I altered the less I liked, though the alterations were to please him. At length, I understood he did not intend to perform any thing; but having urged him pretty strenuously, he said it should be done if I would get it up in a week. This I did to his astonishment; and the next news was that the Lord Chamberlain would not license it. Upon my talking of waiting on Lord HERTFORD about it, as there was nothing immoral in it, all of a sudden a license arrived, and the picce came out. It was not greatly received, but after the fourth night it went on very well till the <HI>tenth,</HI> when—like <HI>Liberty Hall</HI>—it was <HI>damned by a party.</HI> I got from first to last by it about an hundred and twenty pounds.</ITEM>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR BRERETON's benefit in 1775, I brought out <LIST>
<ITEM>39 <HI>The Quaker.</HI> This piece meeting with success, he bought it of me for seventy pounds, and sold it afterwards to GARRICK for an hundred. Had I not parted with it in this way, however, I might have kept it by me, for GARRICK had for some time determined not to produce any thing of my writ∣ing, if he could possibly avoid it. He had no idea that I intended to dabble in this way, when he signed the article, and therefore conceived my whole em∣ploy would be to set words of his writing; and a blessed time I should have had on't, if I had never done any thing else. For this purpose, he was schem∣ing to get rid of Mr. BICKERSTAFF as fast as he could, and the very particular civilities he just then shewed that pretty gentleman, to cover his intention, probably procured him that scandalous and undeserved poem from Dr. KEN∣RICK—his wishes however were anticipated, as the world knows. When I produced him the <HI>Wedding Ring,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Deserter,</HI> he found I could make some stand in this way, and his discontent from that moment was evi∣dent to every body. He was like <HI>Captain Plume,</HI> he would not have a man who could write in his company. Indeed, the most tremendous weapon in
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
the world to GARRICK—was <HI>a pen. The Waterman</HI> following up the <HI>Deserter,</HI> and becoming also very popular, my business was done. I have shewn how he behaved in the affair of the <HI>Cobler</HI>; and as to the <HI>Quaker,</HI> he would not have suffered it to be got up at BRERETON's benefit had not the latter insisted upon it as his right. Even then, the copy was submitted to his inspection, and he returned it with a sneer, saying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he wished him success, but he was rather afraid the spirit would move the audience to damn it."</Q> BRERETON took fire at this, and shewed it to his friend Mr. SHERIDAN, who spoke of it in terms of commendation. All difficulties were now at an end, Mr. SHERI∣DAN's pen was more to be feared than mine. The next season. Mr. GARRICK purchased it, as I mentioned before, but not with a view of performing it, for this piece did not make its second appearance till the management of <HI>Drury∣lane</HI> fell into other hands. Added to the seventy pounds, I received forty pounds for the publication of the words, and about the same sum for the mu∣sic. It will be seen that I did nothing of consequence under my article, since the <HI>Christmas Tale,</HI> which was entirely owing to this jealousy of GARRICK's—in consequence of which he gave the <HI>Maid of the Oaks</HI> to Mr. BARTHE∣LEMON, and <HI>Alfred</HI> to THEODORE SMITH—in both of which pieces, by the bye, I received <HI>orders</HI> to make alterations, and set additional songs. Altera∣tions I peremptorily refused to make, thinking it scandalously indelicate to those gentlemen; nor would I compose an additional song for <HI>Alfred</HI>—which Mr. BLANCHARD, of <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> then a child, may remember was intended for him—but, menaced with an action for the penalty of my article, rather than incur the forfeiture of five hundred pounds, I reluctantly set the song be∣ginning, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What cannot beauty, lovely beauty do?"</Q> in the <HI>Maid of the Oaks.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 My usual quantity of business for <HI>Sadlers Wells,</HI> ia the season 1775.</ITEM>
<ITEM>46 <HI>The Metamorphoses</HI>—an after-piece, brought out at the <HI>Haymarket</HI> in the summer of 1776. When this piece had been performed four nights, I
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
left the care of it to Mr. FOOTE, who promised to do every thing handsome in it, and went to FRANCE. The moment my back was turned, however, he forgot his promise—for he only performed it once more, and I reaped no manner of emolument from it whatever. Indeed, every thing, about this time, went at sixes and sevens with him, for he never <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"joyed himself,"</Q> after the business of the coachman.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the end of this season, as every body knows, FOOTE was advised to go to FRANCE, to dissi∣pate his chagrin. The morning he left NORTH END, going into his parlour, he fixed his eyes for some time on the print taken from that picture, so admirably painted by ZOFFANI, of FOOTE and WESTON' in the <HI>Devil</HI> and Dr. <HI>Last.</HI> At last, heaving a deep sigh, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas! poor WESTON!—very soon it will be, alas! poor FOOTE!"</Q> He died about three weeks after.</NOTE> On the words I had a loss, and the music was never published.</ITEM>
<ITEM>47, 48, 49, 50 Business for <HI>Sadlers Wells.</HI> Mr. KING did not call on me for more work this year.</ITEM>
<ITEM>51 <HI>The Seraglio.</HI> This piece was accepted by Mr. HARRIS, previous to my departure for FRANCE, and performed in the season 1776 and 1777. I should mention also that I then left my affairs in the hands of Dr. ARNOLD, who superintended them till my return, and common justice bids me say, that he discharged his trust with great honour and fidelity, for which kindness I now give him my public thanks. I have yet every letter he wrote me, and really there are many of the kindest and most disinterested sentiments of friend∣ship I ever read. To say the truth, he had trouble enough on my account; for the first stipulation Mr. HARRIS made was to alter the pieces in whatever way he pleased. In consequence of this, when I came to read in the paper the plot of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> at CALAIS, I found it totally different from that which I had sent, and I remember the doctor's letter that accompanied the ac∣count of its reception, says, that if I were to see it I should scarcely know my own piece. Mr. HARRIS also obliged him to new set some of the songs, which he assures me was a most irksome task, but he rather undertook it than that
<PB N="330" REF="307"/>
the piece should not be performed. The benefit for this yielded me forty-eight pounds, the words fifty, and I sold the music for an eventual sixty pounds—forty-five of which became due.</ITEM>
<ITEM>52, 53, 54, 55 <HI>The Razor Grinder—Yo, Yea, or the Friendly Tars—Old Woman of Eighty</HI>—and <HI>The Mad Doctor</HI>—four pieces which I sent Mr. KING from FRANCE. These pieces were sold out and out at a very reasonable price. But I again repeat that all my engagements with Mr. KING were pleasurable ones, and had I made him a present of half I have done for him, I should still be under obligations to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>56 <HI>Poor Vulcan</HI>—a burletta, performed in the season 1777 and 1778, at <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> and which I boldly pronounce, had it been given to the pub∣lic in the state I sent it, would have had much greater success. It is uniformly said that the first act of this piece is remarkably complete; and it must be con∣fessed that from the beginning of the second act to <HI>Vulcan's</HI> soliloquy is as dull as any thing possibly can be, and the reason is, the burlesque is totally dropt, and <HI>Adonis</HI>—by the assistance of Mr. HULL's somniferous muse—converted into a sighing, dying, sleeping swain; whereas I had made him a burlesque character, as well as the rest.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I am glad of this opportunity of shewing how authors are treated by ma∣nagers and their privy counsellors; and am ready to stand or fall by the deci∣sion of the public on the merits of what has been taken away, and what sub∣stituted. This shall be considered in the next letter. In the mean time, re∣joice with me, that at the end of two more, we shall have waded together through this rubbish.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY idea of making <HI>Adonis,</HI> a <HI>burlesque shepherd,</HI> I thought perfectly a new one.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>His first song was a parody on <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When forc'd from dear Hebe to go."</Q> The first verse ran thus:
<Q><LG>
<L>When forc'd from dear MAUDLIN to go,</L>
<L>Of a large humming glass she drank part,</L>
<L>And I thought—but it might not be so,</L>
<L>That the poor creature took it to heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We guzzled, till tipsy we grew,</L>
<L>For my path I could scarcely discern;</L>
<L>And, for her, stead of saying, adieu,</L>
<L>She hiccup'd out—"Prithee return."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>His second song was a parody on <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear Chloe, come give me sweet kisses."</Q> I shall not have room for it at length, but I'll give you the last verse. 
<Q><LG>
<L>Count the coin at the mint they are weighing,</L>
<L>Count the cash at the bank that's conceal'd,</L>
<L>Count the rouleaus at BROOKES's they're paying,</L>
<L>And what Pharoah and Quince nightly yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Count the Exchequer tallies so even,</L>
<L>Go number the Treasury's store,</L>
<L>And when so many guineas you've given,</L>
<L>I still shall be asking for more.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>But my great favourite is the following imitation of HORACE and LYDIA.
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>JOE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>When Serjeant BELLSWAGGER, that masculine brute,</L>
<L>One day had been drinking to swear a recruit,</L>
<L>He kiss'd you, I saw him, or else may I die,</L>
<L>And you, <HI>cruel</HI> MAUDLIN, ne'er once cried, O fie!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again, when the squire had come home from the chase,</L>
<L>You receiv'd him, O Gods, with a smile on your face,</L>
<L>Henceforth, then, my sheep harum skarum may run,</L>
<L>For MAUDLIN is faithless, and I am undone.</L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>MAUDLIN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Ah! JOE, you're a good one—one day in my place—</L>
<L>My husband at home, I was forc'd to send GRACE;</L>
<L>I know for a truth, which ye cannot gainsay,</L>
<L>You touzled her well on a cock of new hay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay, swore you'd be hers—and what is worse yet,</L>
<L>That you only lov'd me, just for what you could get;</L>
<L>As for charms then, I ne'er will believe I have one,</L>
<L>For JOEY is faithless, and I am undone.</L>
</LG>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>JOE.</HEAD>
<L>Will you know then the truth on't—I touz'd her, I own,</L>
<L>Though I rather by half would have let it alone;</L>
<L>But I did it to see if you jealous would prove,</L>
<L>For that, people say, <HI>is a sure sign of love.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>MAUDLIN.</HEAD>
<L>And for me, if the SQUIRE said soft things in my ear,</L>
<L>I suffer'd it, thinking he'd call for strong beer;</L>
<L>And as to the serjeant, 'tis always a rule,</L>
<L>One had better be kiss'd, than be teaz'd—by a fool,</L>
</LG></Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="309"/>I could not resist the insertion of these songs, that it may be seen whether either justice or judgment is generally exercised in mutilations of this sort.—The benefit for <HI>Poor Vulcan</HI> yielded about ninety-five pounds, the music was sold for fifty pounds, and the words for sixty pounds. At this time the ex∣pence
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
of the benefits was raised, by the famous coalition of Mr. SHERIDAN and Mr. HARRIS, to an hundred guineas. I however would not pay it, nor was it, after my positive refusal, insisted on.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>57 <HI>The Gypsies</HI>—an after-piece, written by me, and composed by Dr. ARNOLD. It was performed at the <HI>Haymarket</HI> in the summer of 1778, but was rather a losing game. The profits—had there been any—were to have been divided.</ITEM>
<ITEM>58 <HI>The Touchstone</HI>—performed in the season 1778 and 1779, a panto∣mime, written and composed by me, under a verbal agreement with Mr. HARRIS, at the rate of three hundred pounds for the quantity of three after-pieces, and every thing over and above to be paid for in proportion. This piece has been attributed to Mr. PILON, and to Mrs. COWLEY. The fact is, that in spite of all I could do, Mr. HARRIS would be trying to foist in altera∣tions, which had very nearly parted us before this entertainment came out. I consented however to none but a few that were made by Mr. GARRICK. After the piece was out however, and fairly Mr. HARRIS's property, it was not in my power to prevent his doing what he pleased with it; and by this means that contemptible scene got into it of the <HI>rout,</HI> which I with particular pleasure acknowledge is <HI>not</HI> mine: the emoluments however <HI>were,</HI> and they consisted of an hundred pounds for the piece, as a performance, an hundred pounds by Mr. HARRIS for the copy-right of the words, and twenty pounds for the music.</ITEM>
<ITEM>59 <HI>Rose and Colin</HI>—a piece of one act, performed very frequently, and with great applause.</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 <HI>Annette and Lubin</HI>—of the same description, and performed as success∣fully.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="304" REF="311"/>61 <HI>The Wives revenged</HI>—rather longer, but of the same description. These pieces—together with the <HI>Saloon,</HI> the <HI>Graces,</HI> and the <HI>Statue,</HI> afterwards per∣formed with great success at the <HI>Circus</HI>—are what I allude to in my letter to Mr. HARRIS. I received fifty pounds for each of them, and sixty pounds for the music of the three from Mr. HARRIS—the words I kept, which, accord∣ing to custom, were unproductive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>62 A pantomime—the name of which I do not recollect. In it was in∣troduced that song, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Give round the word dismount, dismount."</Q> It was only a revived thing, and together with the song sung so well by Mrs. KEN∣NEDY, in the <HI>Comedy of Errors,</HI> and some other matters, estimated at fifty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>63 <HI>The Chelsea Pensioner</HI>—same season. This piece came out with Miss MORE's <HI>Percy</HI>—which tragedy, though it is by no means devoid of merit, was not well received; and my opera had like to have suffered by being in company with it. The success of the <HI>Chelsea Pensioner,</HI> however, afterwards was very flattering; yet it was done but three nights in all—owing to the lateness of the season. Why Mr. HARRIS has not repeated it since, he knows best, as there were four songs encored on the last night it was performed. This piece was an overplus charge of an hundred pounds. The words I pub∣lished according to custom at a loss, and the music—except a few songs which were introduced into a periodical work—never was made public.</ITEM>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall not have room particularly to mention how much my pieces have suffered from mutilation; however what I neglect in <HI>detail,</HI> I must make up in <HI>point.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>64 <HI>Mirror</HI>—a pantomime burletta, performed with considerable success at <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> in the season of 1779 and 1780. This piece was strong satire, and therefore <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>cavier</HI> to the multitude,"</Q> who, however, were charmed with the scenery. One circumstance marks this performance very strongly. The character of <HI>Punch,</HI> whose <HI>bibbery bino</HI> begot all the <HI>fal de rals</HI> and <HI>te de rees,</HI> which have so largely contributed to make up the reputation of Mr. ED∣WIN, and which was a satire upon <HI>nonsense,</HI> is now forgotten for nonsense it∣self. For this piece, I received a sixth of the six first nights, amounting to about an hundred and thirty pounds. The words yielded me about twenty pounds, and the music ten pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>65 <HI>The Shepherdess of the Alps</HI>—an opera in three acts. This piece fell for want of support. I remember VERNON's saying, when he was asked why he did not get perfect, and play his best, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he saw it was the general wish <PB N="306" REF="313"/> the piece should be damned, and, as in duty bound, he lent it a hand."</Q> My agreement for this piece was, to have a third of the nine first nights. It was performed but three. I received about seventeen pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>66 <HI>Plymouth in an Uproar</HI>—a piece brought to me by a seafaring gentle∣man. I made some alterations in it at his desire, and it succeeded pretty well, being performed about twelve nights. My share of the profits came to about sixty-five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>67 <HI>The Islanders</HI>—an opera of three acts, performed in the season of 1780 and 1781. This piece had very good success, and is remembered to have con∣tained some of Mrs. KENNEDY's most favourite songs, and many other very popular things. I was to have had for it a third of the nine first nights; but the KING coming to the performance on the sixth, I was obliged to submit to take in the tenth, which made a difference to me of more than fifty pounds. I however, from first to last, got by this piece about three hundred and fifty pounds. Instead of coming out in the course of the business in the second season—which it might have done with considerable reputation—Mr. HARRIS made me cut it down into a farce, and call it <HI>The Marriage Act.</HI> The alte∣rations this piece underwent, previous to its coming out, were innumerable. Some few of them were suggested by Mr. HARRIS, but I'll venture to say it gained nothing by that. Mr. WOODFALL saw a sketch of the first act, in a rough state, and in a letter which I have by me, declared it bid the fairest for popularity of any thing he had seen. It was certainly a very great favourite with Mr. HARRIS, who advised me not to confess myself the author, urging me with words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"more than belonged to such a trifle;"</Q> for he said JUNIUS was not yet known—and therefore he would not advise me to declare myself. To be sure there were some flying reports that Mr. HARRIS wrote it himself—but it will hardly be thought he wished those to be credited.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="307" REF="314"/>68 <HI>Harlequin Free Mason</HI>—same season. This piece had a prodigious run. I wrote the words and composed the music. My emoluments were se∣venty pounds from the theatre, I sold about 2700 books, which yielded me—for so well are these things managed—about thirty-five pounds, and the music was distributed in a work called the <HI>Lyrist,</HI> which publication yielded me nearly fifty pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>69 <HI>Amphytrion</HI>—performed in the season of 1781 and 1782. This piece was the only instance in which I made a point of <HI>securing myself.</HI> Mr. HAR∣RIS and I parted, as I have before mentioned. I had nothing to do with con∣ducting it, and it was performed but two nights. I received for it two hun∣dred and eighty-five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 <HI>The Barrier of Parnassus, The Graces, The Saloon, The Milkmaid, The Refusal of Harlequin, The Land of Simplicity, The Passions, The Statue, Clump and Cud∣den, The Benevolent Tar, The Regions of Accomplishment, Lancashire Witches, The Cestus, Pandora, The Long Odds.</HI> These, two or three other panto∣mimes, four or five <HI>intermezzos</HI> of a more trifling kind, and at least fifteen bal∣lads, each taking twelve or fourteen airs and an overture, with a variety of other matter, make up what I did for the <HI>Circus</HI>; where, in the first season, I cleared upwards of nine hundred pounds—but from that moment, my con∣nexion with this place has been a series of trouble, loss, and vexation, which, to enumerate, would make up as long a work as this I shall say a few words on this head however in a future letter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>85 <HI>Liberty Hall</HI>—performed with the success I have already stated, at <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> in the season of 1785 and 1786. The benefit yielded forty-eight pounds, the words <HI>nothing,</HI> and the music—by which if it had been performed oftener I should have received a considerable sum—brought, though handsomely bargained for, no great matter.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="308" REF="315"/>86 <HI>Harvest Home</HI>—performed at the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> 1787. I was nine pounds in debt on the benefit, the words I sold for forty pounds, and the music did about as much as <HI>Liberty Hall.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These pieces, were I to go over every ground, would come up to very near an hundred, but <HI>Richmond, Marybone, Exeter Change,</HI> and some other places where I have produced performances, shall be given in to heap up the measure. What I have done will astonish the reader sufficiently—for he will see that, in twenty-three years, I have received only about five thousand five hundred pounds, even when I add my different salaries and annual benefits.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>What have we here, players!—that is to say, strollers?</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT now remains to add to my TOUR and the state∣ment of pieces already given—the entertainment which I have so often deli∣vered, and frequently to very little purpose, under the title of READINGS and MUSIC. This I shall follow up with some finishing observations, a very brief recapitulation of all I have advanced—placed by way of critique on myself in every possible point of view—and, at length, a farewel to that country which I hope I have shewn that I quit not upon slavish and narrow, but liberal and laudable principles.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> have seen, but others will please to suppose me upon my platform, with a piano forte before me, mustering up either a patient, contented, or delighted smile—but never a contemptuous one—according to the number either scattered about or crowded in the room—and beginning, by way of</P>
<P><LABEL>EXORDIUM,</LABEL>
<Q>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</Q></P>
<P>The introduction to my entertainment ought to explain its nature and tendency. The first would be no very easy matter to accomplish, for it is of
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
so eccentric a kind that it will not in any respect tally with whatever may be measured by the standard of regularity. But as to its drift, I believe it may have as legitimate pretensions to public favour as any other amusement.—Matters of this kind in general aim at satisfying the auditors, with an eye to the advantage of their fabricators; like the physician, who, as he held out his hand for a see, and was professing how disinterested he gave his advice—saying <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I take all this pains for you'</Q>—was answered by the sick Irishman, as he put the guinea into his hand—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'true, true, <HI>all</HI> for me, and a little for yourself, doctor.'</Q></P>
<P>Were I kept to the letter of my promise, it would be my indispensible duty to improve and amuse. This text, however, I shall divide; leaving it to others to instruct, while I try the utmost of my poor endeavour to enter∣tain. The best regulated understandings may pant for relaxation, at which time, trifles light as air are the welcomest pleasures. The mind unbent from its severer duty, shall find a very nothing full of charms. An <HI>anecdote,</HI> a <HI>bon mot,</HI> a <HI>jeux d'esprit,</HI> shall be delicious. These will be my moments of tri∣umph. Besides, I have a resource to which many have resorted with won∣derful success. Sound has often proved a fortunate succedaneum for sense—for music, like charity, covers a multitude of faults. How often has the rickety deformity of a hobbling line been wrought into symmetry by the ele∣gance of a beautiful passage—an uncouth rhime rendered as smooth as the honey of Hybla by the force of modulation—and a whole mouthful of exple∣tives gracefully swallowed by the operation only of a few chromatics.</P>
<P>Various friends, however, have suggested various improvements on my own ideas. One of these you would have taken for a cook, for he said he would undertake to supply my mental banquet with a curious and plentiful collection of dishes, suitable to all palates. He told me he had <HI>roasted</HI> NA∣BOBS, and <HI>stewed</HI> PATRIOTS—<HI>surprized</HI> GENERALS, and <HI>devilled</HI> LAWYERS. For needy gentlemen, become gamblers in their own defence, he had a choice quantity of <HI>pigeons.</HI> He had <HI>ducks</HI> and <HI>drakes</HI> for speculators in the alley. Then
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
for fish, he had a <HI>plaise</HI> for <HI>sycophants</HI> who chose to apply for it. He had <HI>good soles</HI> for the promoters of <HI>conviviality</HI>—and he had <HI>gudgeons</HI> for political and physical quacks. That to be sure he could not brag much upon the article of <HI>maids</HI>; but then, to make amends, he had a liquorish <HI>old wife</HI> in high sea∣son for a ruined <HI>spendthrift.</HI> Then for a desert—he had <HI>sugar plums</HI> for the <HI>conscientious; trifles</HI> for <HI>fops; whip syllabubs</HI> for <HI>orators; ice</HI> for <HI>young widows</HI>; and <HI>hard crusts</HI> and <HI>bitter almonds</HI> for—<HI>critics.</HI> But what he most of all re∣commended was his <HI>flummery,</HI> which he said was made of such delicious ma∣terials, that it would be greedily swallowed by all distinctions, from a <HI>bishop</HI> to a <HI>beggar.</HI></P>
<P>A Frenchman advised me to fill my entertainment with dances, which he assured me was not only the very essence of all public amusement, but contained every requisite accomplishment for the completion of a fine gentle∣man. But I will endeavour to give you his own words. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>Monsieur—Sare</HI>—look all over de varld, every ting depend pon larn to <HI>danse. Sans cela</HI> vidout larn to <HI>danse</HI> you cannot vat you call see life—you cannot know noting.

<P>I referred the gentleman to the Opera house, telling him, if he should chance to get paid, he might perhaps dance away with English bank note too.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="319"/>An Italian let me into the secret of all that has been done in the way of taking people by the ears since this country could boast an opera house. He told me it was as easy to make music by receipt as macaroni. But as an Ita∣lian never explains himself so well at when he sings, I will endeavour to give you his idea of a recipe for a <HI>bravura</HI> song to music—and to music in the next page follows the very song I introduced upon this occasion. I therefore finish this letter with recommending it to your attention, and myself to a continu∣ation of your good wishes, being,</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE song over, I thus went on.</P>
<P>I could not help confessing there was certainly some ingenuity in this mode of spinning music; but I thought it too much like the labours of the spi∣der, which—though curious—have neither <HI>beauty</HI> nor <HI>durability,</HI> I consequently determined to rely on my own judgment. You will, therefore—proceeded I—suppose me a painter, with my canvass upon an eifel and my whole appa∣ratus lying before me, preparing to present you with a faint sketch of human nature; not as I have sometimes seen it described, with the virtues rising on each other like the Alps and Apenines, altogether as STUPENDOUS, and alto∣gether as <HI>cold:</HI> nor again, as a thing so fraught with depravity, so pitiably contemptible that a man would rather be an <HI>oyster</HI> than an <HI>emperor</HI>—but as we see it every day, without making it either a flattering likeness or a <HI>caricature</HI>; for, though I shall throw the human mind—if I may be allowed the figure—into every possible situation, yet I shall not place it where I have not actually seen it. It may sometimes be <HI>ludicrous,</HI> but it shall be always <HI>like.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="326"/>Imagine, then, that I have now filled my canvass with a number of lines, curves, parallels, perpendiculars, and dots; faintly to represent a large groupe of characters—one projecting a leg, another an arm, and another a head; and then suppose me—like the man who shews the tombs in West∣minster abbey—about to explain their good, bad, and indifferent qualities—just as it may suit to illustrate my position; and to this man I may be aptly compared—for, like him, I have all the talk to myself, and, like him, am paid before I shew any thing.</P>
<P>Very poor, however, would be my reward if it was only derived from pecuniary gratification. A warmer and more thankful sentiment fires my breast, no less than that as I am impelled alone by gratitude to appear before you, I may hope for your kind and gentle wishes for my safety, health and prosperity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I did not finish the exordium in this manner, it ran as follows—from the words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"my own judgment."</Q> I shall therefore present you with a melange; which I trust will be found to be neither regularly dull, nor ridiculously eccentric, but a sort of medium between these extremes; tend∣ing sometimes to provoke an involuntary sigh, but much oftener a spontaneous smile; and though I profess it to be out of all rule, class, or distinction, yet I am sanguine enough to hope it will have as regular a beginning, middle, and end, as an epic poem; that it will commence with <HI>curiosity,</HI> be fol∣lowed up with <HI>attention,</HI> and conclude with—APPROBATION.</NOTE></P>

<P>CASSANDER, cut to the soul at being torn—through the avarice of her father—from the arms of his SOPHRONIA, retired to a remote part of the kingdom, to contemplate on her virtues.</P>
<P>HORTENSIA, the beautiful and envied wife of the gallant FERDINAND, had been married but a little month, when, provoked by the insolence of a saucy calumniator, her husband fell defending her honour. Grief induced her to retire, and chance directed her to where CASSANDER sighed in secret for the loss of his SOPHRONIA. Accident brought them together—when, urged by the congeniality of their sentiments, they vowed on the spot an eternal friendship, and agreed to meet every morning in the same place to recite such stories of private misery as had fallen within their notice, occasioned either by false honour or the insatiable cruelty of avaricious parents.</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>To chequer the entertainment, and render it a little more lively, I thus went on.</P>
<P>I shall now introduce you to a set of gentlemen whose evenings were <HI>jovially</HI> employed in the same degree, as the mornings of CASSANDER and HORTENSIA were devoted to despondency.</P>
<P>This company consisted of a PROJECTOR, who had tired the royal society and impaired his fortune by schemes that had every thing to <HI>perfect</HI> them but <HI>practicability.</HI> A SPECULATOR who had invented an instrument which was to foretel the coming change of the stocks, upon the principle of a barometer, but who—unfortunately trusting too far to the infallibility of his project—was obliged to <HI>waddle out.</HI> A COMMODORE, who had risen by his merit from the forecastle, and had retired in disgust. A POET, who had never been able to get a play heard to the end of the first act. A wild IRISH∣MAN, who had blundered through a large patrimony fill he had nothing left—to use his own words—but the <HI>purse</HI> of a <HI>beggar</HI> and the <HI>heart</HI> of a <HI>prince.</HI> And a LEVEE HUNTER, who, in the course of <HI>thirteen years,</HI> was <HI>once</HI> within <HI>five minutes</HI> of seeing the <HI>great man himself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="332"/>These six, grown wise from their disappointments, had gathered toge∣ther the scattered remains of their broken fortunes, and determined to laugh away the rest of their lives. Health followed them to the chace; pleasure filled the teeming bowl; and the only contention at their meetings—where ANACREON might have been proud to sit president—was—who should be forwarderst to promote harmless mirth and inoffensive hilarity.</P>
<P>The board being met, and a few toasts drank, the poet was called upon for a song. He said he would give them a little satirical touch, which he had that morning written against a lady, who had been cruel to him. He confessed it was malicious—or so—but he sincerely believed exactly in point for all that.</P>

</LG>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>The conversation next turned on the law—and one of the company had mentioned the frequency of executions in this country. From this the PBO∣JECTOR, who was a bit of a wag, took occasion to relate the following anecdote.</P>
<P>A carpenter, who could not get his money for two gibbets that had been bespoke, refused to make a third; and an execution having been in con∣sequence delayed—the jailor being called to account—blamed the carpenter, who was at length summoned before the judge. The judge told him he had ordered the gibbet, and demanded in a very preremptory way the reason it had not been made. The carpenter, with the greatest simplicity in nature, excused himself by telling the truth—saying—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I refused the hangman and the jailor to make a <HI>third</HI> gibbet, because I had not been paid for the <HI>two first</HI>; but if I had known the gallows had been for your LORDSHIP—why lord love you it should have been <HI>done out of hand.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The POET was noticing how sometimes the most trivial and unforeseen accident overturns an author's hopes. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A thing,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'once happened to me which was enough to make a man forswear ever taking a pen in hand. I had a tragedy—GARRICK performed in it—I must confess the principal incident was a little similar to LEAR's abdication of the throne in favour of his daughters. Mine were two daughters; and the king—after giving them a lesson, fraught
<PB N="318" REF="334"/>
with legislative advantages that might have done honour to SOLON or LY∣CURGUS—finished his harangue with saying <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and now I divide this crown between you"</Q>—Sir, a malicious scoundrel peeping over the spikes of the orchestra, and staring GARRICK full the face, cried out—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, that's just <HI>half a-crown a-piece.</HI>"</Q> Sir, an incessant laugh immediately prevailed, and if it had been to save your soul, another syllable was not to be heard; and thus the world lost for ever four acts, and a half of the finest writing—'<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am glad on't,"</Q> said the COMMODORE, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if you had not been disabled in giving chace to the public, you would never have come to safe moorings in grog harbour.

<P>The COMMODORE then gave, May our sea of delight never ebb! The POET said it was impossible—for they drew their mirth from the follies of mankind, which source was inexhaustible. This gave rise to a mixed con∣versation, in which scarcely any subject escaped them. Impostors of all de∣nominations were severely handled, and particularly pretenders to courage. This naturally brought up duelling; and one of them said, in a country like this, where there are such admirable laws, he wondered it was not put a stop to. Laws! exclaimed the Irishman—</P>

<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE COMMODORE, in answer to the IRISHMAN's remarks, said, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well, but surely you don't mean to countenance those pre∣tenders to courage—those petulent wasps, who'</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All now do stop a mi∣nute,"</Q> retorted the IRISHMAN—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I countenance!—be my soul, I'll tell you how I served one of these spalpeons. The gentleman, d'ye see, was telling a long, roundabout rhodomontade story about fighting, which he finished the conclusion of by saying he had killed three men. I told him that his three men was nothing at all at all, a jolman in my country would kill thirteen, and eat them afterwards. I myself, said I, have had eleven duels, and kilt my man every time, and in a twelft—But, said I to the company, you shall hear gentlemen. I was a sad, wicked, rakehelly, young dog—played deep—dranked hard. Well Sir, I had a quarrel wid a box-lobby beau—called him out—kilt him. I did not fly, you see—I knew I had pinked a puppy, and should be thanked for it. This affair, however, being wid a fly, a gnat, a muskito, my courage was only tought a flash in the pan, and I was presently insulted by five of the most resolute among them, dat wanted to <HI>quarrel</HI> with me. Oh to be sure I was not a scoundrel, paltroon, and a
<PB N="324" REF="340"/>
puppy. Oh it would have done your heart good to see me rouse from my lethargy of passive endurance. I appointed them all at different times and places on the same morning—kilt 'em, and retired to the Continent. About a month afterwards, I was in a coffee-house in France, where a great, big Swiss officer, who was poring over the papers, seemed extremely offended at the vacant silliness of a young Frenchman, who—as SHAKESPEARE says of <HI>Gratiano</HI>—was talking a great deal about nothing at all at all. Ah—said old crusty—<HI>le diable soit le petit jean foutre.</HI> The youngster, in a <HI>hop step</HI> and <HI>minuet jump</HI> skipt up to him, and demanded, in the civilest manner, who he had thought proper to honour with so elegant an appellation? He was answered, <HI>Vous—Moi!—Vous—vous etes un petit jean foutre.</HI> They went out, and in ten minutes the Swiss returned, in all the easy tranquillity imaginable, having killed the Frenchman. The affair became presently the talk of the coffee-room—<HI>c'etois bien dommage mais comment faire</HI>—Monsieur <HI>avois le humeur noir.</HI> I could not help saying that <HI>Monsieur's humeur noir</HI> was but a poor excuse for having kilt the young man. I was asked to ex∣plain myself. To be sure I did not civilly comply with his request, by knocking his Ramilee wig about. Out we went, and by as pretty a little, genteel, cunning lunge as ever made an eyelet hole—I cured Monsieur of his <HI>humeur noir,</HI> and, fait, every other care. This was my seventh man; my eighth was a Dutchman, whom I was obliged to fight with knives over a table, for nothing in life only because I happened to say by accident that their women, their ships, and their pugs dogs were all cast in the same mould. My affair in ENGLAND being now pretty well blown over, I ven∣tured to return; but that I might be sure every thing was sung, I got a friend to look out for me while I lay quiet at a lodging in DEAL."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the family, you see, dere was an old gentleman, who out of four children had three sons and a daughter. I had not been there a week before the daughter fell in love with me. Dat you know was natural enough. 'Tis a dillycate affair—but a pregnancy was the consequence. What was to be
<PB N="325" REF="341"/>
done! The brothers—Oh they watched me with the eyes of a cat or a rat∣tle snake. They were determined, it seems, to massacre me. I had an in∣timation of their design from the dear girl herself—a charming, lovely, dear, tender, delicious creature. I appeared before them, and desired I might be permitted to defend myself. My request was generously granted. Oh it cut me to the soul, but I performed my part as nobly as <HI>Horatius</HI> with <HI>Cu∣riatii</HI>—I kilt 'em all three. The father was now determined to have a touch with me—a fine, stately, vinnerable parson—about sixty-seven—aquiline nose—silver hair. Oh if I was to explain myself ever so, it would be im∣possible to tell you what I felt. Well, Sir, we met. After a genteel sa∣lute—which you know good breeding always allows—he made a lunge in tierce—I in flanconade. To make short of my story, after an ineffectual attempt to disarm him—taking advantage of my confusion, and whipping in a well imagined lunge in carte over arm—<HI>arrah sait</HI>—HE KILT ME!"</Q></P>
<P>The jolmon would not believe a single word of all I had uttered; at which I told him, that as I had not discredited his story, I should insist on his not doubting mine. At this the laugh became general, and the poor devil of a duellist was glad enough to sneak out of the room.</P>
<P>And serve him right too—said the COMMODORE. There are three occa∣sions, and only three, that justify a man's risking his life—his country, his wife, and his friend; for life, d'ye see, is a ship that providence has given us to command, and he who runs her on the rocks of folly, goes beyond his instructions, and may be sure to be called to a severe court martial for it.—Give me a fellow like JACK RATLIN.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may remember, after the song—I said</P>
<P>Neither the COMMODORE's remarks nor his song could do away the vein of conversation that had before taken place. Every notorious lie that could be thought of was related. One said he had heard a lawyer aver his business was of so vast and extensive a nature, that he cleared two hundred a year by only melting the wax of the chancery and other seals, in the course of his practice. This gentleman, however, was outdone by another, who said he had such a counting-house full of clerks, that he saved double that sum, in ink and expedition, by only leaving out tittles and dashes. But the thing that seemed to be best relished was an account of a man who under∣took to jump off the monument. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The fact,'</Q> said the speculator who told the story, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'was as follows. One PETER WILKINS, a biscuit maker by trade, undertook to jump off the monument. He was to mount on the rails when St. PAUL's clock should strike twelve, and he was to jump off at the last stroke. Every precaution was of course taken to keep the poor devil from breaking his neck. Feather beds, loads of straw, and woolpacks were piled upon each other to an immense height. The day came—the
<PB N="328" REF="344" MS="y"/>
streets seemed to be paved with faces, and the houses roofed with people. The usual accidents happened. Broken limbs, dislocations, fractures, and contusions were plenty. Women with children in their arms were thrown down and trod upon; while old chimney stacks, tiles, and brick-bats flew about like hail. Well Sir, the moment arrived—the clock struck—and honest PETER, true to his trust, mounted upon the balustrades. At the last stroke—off he went. Icod Sir—when he was half way down—his heart failed him—<HI>and</HI>—HE JUMPED BACK AGAIN.'</Q></P>
<P>The company getting a little into disorder, silence was commanded, and a hunting song called for, which was given them by the POET.</P>

<P>I then returned to my desponding lovers; but—lest the matter should grow too grave—I gave it the following turn.</P>
<P>CASSANDER met his friend HORTENSIA as usual, and while they were moralizing on the uncertainty of sublunary felicity, a conversation on the other side of the hedge attracted their attention. I should have told you that ROBIN, CASSANDER's confidential servant, retired from a disappointment in love, as well as his master; nor was JENNY, the handmaid of HORTENSIA, behind hand with her mistress in heroic sentiments. These two it seems—profitting by the lessons of their superiors—had sought also for consolation in each others friendships. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And so Mr. ROBIN,'</Q> said JENNY, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'you really say you have a pleasure in my company?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So much, Mrs. JENNY,"</Q> said ROBIN, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I almost begin to forget PEG already.

I'll tell you how the thing is—"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No, no,'</Q> said JENNY, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'let me tell you how it is. You

<P>They then talked of authors. The PROJECTOR, who once had an idea of inventing a windmill to grind poetry, maintained—throughout the whole
<PB N="333" REF="349"/>
time he was bit with this scheme—fourteen authors. The company being very desirous of hearing something of the project and these scribbling depen∣dants, he gratified them by saying that his plan was in <HI>idea</HI> so constructed as to grind poetry according to the degree of violence or serenity with which the wind blew. Zephyrs were to make pastorals—an unequal squally wind was to write pindaric odes—May breezes were to fabricate love songs—and thunder storms were to give a faithful description of warlike exploits. Then, proceeding to speak of his poets—what was the most extraordinary, said he, no two of them seemed to know each others profession any more than if they were of different professions. Upon inquiring how this came about, I found that poetry, no more than physic, is ever done in the <HI>lump</HI>; for that one is employed to write tragedies and another dying speeches, just as you have one doctor for the <HI>teeth</HI> and another for the <HI>corns.</HI> Thus, of one I learnt punning by rule. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By rule?"</Q> said the POET. Yes—thus. A man says <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. LOCKE was a great <HI>metaphysician.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh Lord!"</Q> says you, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that's nothing at all—I <HI>met a physician</HI> myself yesterday."</Q> The next rule is to lay a trap for a pun, by a previous question. Says you <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'do you think the dinner is ready?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I really don't know,"</Q> says one of the company, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am going to <HI>see.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh, to <HI>sea</HI> are you!'</Q> says you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I wish you <HI>a good voyage.</HI>'</Q>—Or thus—says you <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what do you think of this business of the EMPEROR and the TUKRS?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Think!"</Q> says one, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why that the EMPEROR will play the very devil with them. Why, Sir, in another twelvemonth there will be <HI>no Turkey</HI> in EUROPE."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Upon my word,'</Q> says you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am very sorry for that—it is a very charming dish, especially with a pudding in its belly.'</Q> Thus when you have learned to pun with facility, you may do what you please. One says—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, pun away."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Away!</HI>'</Q> says you—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I had better pun <HI>here</HI> had not I?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Icod,"</Q> says another, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he is in for it, <HI>stop</HI> him who can."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay,'</Q> says you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what the devil should they <HI>stop</HI> me for, I have <HI>stolen nothing.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, upon my word,"</Q> says the first, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that is <HI>beyond</HI> every thing."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Oh,'</Q> says you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'if that is the case, you know I can <HI>go no farther.</HI>'</Q> So much for punning. Another sets up for su∣perficial
<PB N="334" REF="350"/>
learning—that is to say—teaching you to lard your conversation with quotations, which if you cannot do off hand, you must <HI>invent.</HI> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Arrah is it <HI>invent</HI> you mean?'</Q> said the IRISHMAN, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'to be sure that is not as natural a bull as if I had made it myself.'</Q> I am perfectly right for all that, said the PROJECTOR. A man asks your opinion of a work, which, though you know nothing at all about, you must pretend to be critically acquainted with. <Q REND="inline">'Why,'</Q> says you, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'TULLY says—'</Q> It does not signify a halfpenny whether he ever said it or not. But if your man seems to know any thing about TULLY, you must add—<Q REND="inline">'<HI>somewhere.</HI>'</Q> Says you <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'TULLY says—<HI>somewhere</HI>'</Q>—so then you may say any think out of your own head. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, upon my word,"</Q> said the POET, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that is all mighty well, but suppose it should not be a very <HI>bright</HI> thing."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh, why then you know that is TULLY's fault—<HI>not yours.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh, but upon my soul this is treating poor TULLY very ill."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh Sir,'</Q> said the PROJECTOR, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'these poets care not three-pence who they treat ill, so they are but clever themselves; but I am too sore when I think of my follies—therefore let us talk of something else.'</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With all my heart,"</Q> said the COMMODORE—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"come POET give us a song."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I'll give you,'</Q> said the POET, the <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'musicians lamentation for the loss of his mistress.'</Q></P>

<P>To follow CASSANDER and HORTENSIA through all their meetings would considerably exceed my plan. They continued, something more than a fortnight, during which time so remarkable a parity of sentiment manifested itself, that they seemed animated with one soul. Every look—every sigh—every wish was the same; and they neither of them believed—though nothing could be more certain—that <HI>friendship</HI> had long since softened into <HI>love.</HI>—About this time—as CASSANDER was preparing to entertain HORTENSIA with a story calculated to awaken the whole force of her sensibility—a shower of rain obliged them to take shelter in the house, where the first object that presented itself was a portrait of SOPHRONIA. It is wonderful to what ad∣vantage the little subtel god turned this accident. CASSANDER could not find a feature that was not imcomparably outdone in the face of HORTENSIA.—One was <HI>pretty,</HI> the other BEAUTIFUL—one <HI>easy,</HI> the other GRACEFUL. In short, I am afraid one was <HI>absent,</HI> and the other PRESENT.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKING a final leave of the lovers, we will now visit the club, for the last time. Their topic was that noble animal, the horse: and the vicissitudes of fortune that mark that creatures different stages of life, naturally introduced a song, which it seems was a favourite of the company.</P>

<L>Lords, hawkers, and jockies assail the tir'd ear;</L>
<L>While—with neck like a rainbow, erecting his crest,</L>

conjurer, who not being exactly <HI>au sait</HI> to this diabolical business, did not always execute it so as to operate to his master's wishes.

Poor TYCHO is horribly put to it to conceive how he can possibly find out these <HI>spirits of distress.</HI> Having, how∣ever determined to make the best of it, he thus begins his incantation.</P>

<P>THE.—who all the world knows to have been a great voluptuary—and who would give his last guinea for an ortolan, and confiscate something to get it dressed—had dined in the city at a public entertainment, and rendered himself very agreeable by relating a number of anecdotes, and sporting other sallies of wit. A few nights afterwards, being in the boxes of the theatre, he saw there one of the citizens he had dined with. He spoke to him with great familiarity, but was astonished to find his salute scarcely returned. A second and a third attempt were as unsuccessful. He, therefore, went into another box, where sat one of his boon companions, who had noticed the transaction. The <HI>bon vivant</HI> began upon THE. immediately. <Q REND="inline">'What,'</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the old gentleman would not speak to you.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> answered THE. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and I cannot, for the life of me divine the reason. It was but three days ago we were as intimate as gormandizing and hilarity could make us. Why, Sir, I made him chuckle and shake his fat sides and rosy gills as often as there was a pause between a glass of <HI>burgundy</HI> and a mammoc of <HI>green sat.</HI> Now he affects not to recollect me."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And you pretend you don't know why,'</Q> said the other. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have not the smallest conception,"</Q> said THE. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I'll set you right then,'</Q> said his companion. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Your intimate friend over a bottle chuses to disclaim you in the face of the world, that's all.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIV. <HI>MORE VIVACITY AT THE EXPENCE OF ACTORS.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"<HI>For they are the abstract</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>And brief chronicle of the times.</HI>"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS one anecdote naturally produces another, I at different times took the opportunity, while the club were on the subject of the theatre, to introduce those which follow.</P>
<P>An actor who had been used to perform <HI>tragedy</HI> and <HI>comedy</HI> indiscrimi∣nately, was sent on for BUCKINGHAM, in <HI>Richard the Third,</HI> but not being very perfect, he floundered through the part with great hesitation, and in much confusion. When he came to that soliloquy where RICHARD leaves him with these words—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I'm busy—thou troublest me—I am not in the vein"</Q> he was quite at a loss—and so intimidated, that he could not catch the word from the prompter. The audience began to hiss, and poor BUCKINGHAM—after the loss of the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Earldom of HEREFORD"</Q>—had very nearly been pelted with rotten apples. At length he recollected that he had played HODGE in <HI>Love in a Village</HI> the night before, and feeling the situation to be exactly the same as that of BUCKINGHAM, he hollowed out—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I thought it would come to this, I'll be shot if I did not."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="364"/>Another related an anecdote of Mrs. CHARKE, the daughter of COLLEY CIBBER. She was playing IAGO in a barn, and they were in great confusion about the difficulty of managing the business of the quarrel between CASSIO and RODERIGO—for which they wanted <HI>three</HI> swords, whereas they had among them but <HI>two.</HI> It was agreed, however, that one of them should stagger into the corner, and so let his sword fall, as if by accident, between the scenes, that thus she might find it, and come on to wound CASSIO.—This, however, was neglected—and seeing it was impossible to get a sword—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What the devil shall I do?'</Q> said she, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I must knock the fellow down.'</Q> Saying these words, she ran into the dressing room—which was also a bed∣chamber—and catched up an old bedpost, with which she ran furiously at CASSIO, and not to be worse than her promise, laid on him pretty severely. He speaking mechanically, when he heard his cue—which was accompanied by a blow on the <HI>head</HI>—cried out in the words of his part—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh my LEG is cut in two."</Q></P>
<P>The company being all lovers of theatrical merit, these anecdotes in∣duced them separately to hold forth in praise of those actors or actresses who had been their greatest favourites, and having arrived to that pitch of tenacity when no one of them would cede his opinion, the poet set them to rights by saying—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Gentlemen, we have all our prejudicies. I once illus∣trated this position pretty strongly in a fable.'</Q></P>
<P>A large company went to see a collection of various animals. A <HI>soldier</HI> admired the <HI>lion,</HI> a <HI>sailor</HI> the <HI>nautilus,</HI> a <HI>fine lady</HI> the <HI>ostrich,</HI> a <HI>courtier</HI> the <HI>jackall,</HI> and an <HI>hypocrite</HI> the <HI>hyena.</HI> A <HI>hump-backed man</HI> declared they were all fools; each, he said, might have its particular merits, but he would venture to prove, beyond contradiction, that for beauty and symmetry no <HI>animal</HI> upon the face of creation could equal the—CAMEL.</P>
<P>This reproach set them all into good humour, and produced the fol∣owing song from the COMMODORE.</P>

<P>THE SPECULATOR, before the company broke up, entreated the POET to favour them with a song, for which he had a great partiality. It was a description of the confusion that about two years ago happened at Westminster-hall, when an officious maid servant was washing the leads of the house of commons, upon which a general panic ensued, and in two minutes the court of king's bench exhibited the most ludicrous scene of whimsical consternation that ever was beheld.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT this place you may remember I paused—dur∣ing which interval I never failed to receive much kind attention from some part or other of my auditory: to go into which would be, in a degree, to recapitulate <HI>briefly</HI> all those public remarks that I have already given AT LARGE. I shall, however, though the harvest is over, look through the field, and pick up the gleanings. For—as I set out with remarking that by means of taking my hearers at the moment I made them feel, I became possessed of their fair, unadulterated sentiments, in a purer and more ingenuous manner, than I should otherwise have been competent to do—so you and my readers in general may not be displeased to get the essence of these cursory conver∣sations.</P>
<P>They consisted of kind enquiries whether I was not fatigued? congra∣tulations on a full room; condolence on a thin one—which last was nine times out of ten the case; the solicitations that <HI>never</HI> failed to be made on a first night for a repetition of the performance; all the insinuating cunning of asking whether I <HI>really</HI> meant to go to INDIA? solicitude to know how I came to leave the <HI>Theatres?</HI> questions concerning the present state of them;
<PB N="348" REF="374"/>
wishes to know why MALLET, MURPHY, and other ingenious men do not write for the stage? how the town, formerly so fond of trite sentiment, is now become altogether as mad after puns and jests? if Mr. SHERIDAN has really given up the management of Drury-lane theatre? what can be the pos∣sible reason why <HI>ladies</HI> who write for the stage always introduce more balder∣dash than <HI>men?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gentleman, who I am sure would not care if I mentioned his name, assured me he took some pains to get acquainted with one of these <HI>soi disant</HI> FEMALE SHAKESPEARES, and very gravely recom∣mended the following anecdote—which I shall tell as decently as I can—to be introduced as a monstrous good thing in one of her <HI>comedies.</HI> He said it was in the stile of FOOTE, only a little <HI>fatter.</HI> A jury∣man, who was troubled with the strangury, entreated one of the gentlemen of the bar, sitting near him, to represent his situation, and beg that he might be permitted for a short time to go out of court. The judge having heard the request, interrupted the trial by saying he had a new question for their obser∣vation, and on which indeed he should be remiss in taking any step till he had submitted his reasons for so doing to the court. Said he—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one of the jury hath craved leave to retire for a few minutes only—for an urgent purpose, procured and caused by a grievous malady with which the poor man had the misfortune to be greatly afflicted. The malady I allude to is the strangury—and it is a disorder which has some similitude to the stone, or gravel, or indeed both, inasmuch as some learned physicians are of opinion"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Indeed my lord,'</Q> said the juryman, making a wry face, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it is very painful, I wish your lordship would permit me to go out of court.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Patience, my good friend, patience,"</Q> replied his lordship. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I greatly wish to oblige you, but every thing here must be done according to form.

Yes, I am right, it was on an action brought for the recovery"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Indeed, my lord, if you will let me go out of court,'</Q> cried the tortured juryman, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it will be the kindest <HI>action</HI> your lord∣ship ever did in your life.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Pray,"</Q> said his lordship, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"don't interrupt me when I am expounding the law. Yes, yes, it <HI>was</HI> so; and then in another case HOGES <HI>versus</HI> WATKINS"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh dear!'</Q> cried the juryman—<Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q> continued the judge, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a juryman, as in the present case, had, with modest and becoming demeanour"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">'Oh!'</Q> cried the juryman, screwing up his muscles—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"preferred to the bench, upon the same emergent occasion, a similar request"</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What shall I do!'</Q> bellowed out the juryman—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and if my memory fails me not, there are two or three other cases, which I could cite at length."</Q> After reiterated pain, which he was no longer able to endure, the juryman cried out—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My lord you need not cite any more cases, for I have p—d my breeches.'</Q> If this elegant anecdote should grace the <HI>lady's</HI> next play, I hope she will have gratitude enough to acknowledge to what patron she is indebted for it.</NOTE> why I always cut harder at the <HI>law</HI> than any other pro∣fession? how much I am more than thirty years of age? and whether the <HI>Padlock</HI> was not performed five and twenty year ago?—thus endeavouring
<PB N="349" REF="375" MS="y"/>
to make it appear that I was on the stage before I was born, and composed music before I could speak. How I should have acted if ever I had been hissed?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had made up my mind upon this. Had it ever happened, I was determined to relate the following circumstance, which really occured at EDINBURGH. LEE and LOVE were mutually con∣cerned in that theatre, and they disputed as to the mode of conducting their different departments, till at length the controversy arose to such a pitch that the town took part in it. Thus, whenever LOVE appeared LEE's friends hissed him, and <HI>vice versa.</HI> That part of the town that came merely to be amused, and had too much good sense to interfere in so ridiculous a business, by this means deserted the theatre, and left it wholly occupied by the hissers—who, also getting tired, mustered thinner and thinner, till the house exhibited very little more than empty benches. LOVE, finding his interest mate∣rially injured, came to his senses first, and determined if possible to put a finish to the matter. For this purpose, the first time he was hissed he came forward, and having obtained a hearing, said—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ladies and gentlemen—the next time you come to <HI>hiss</HI> I should be much obliged to you if you would bring <HI>a few more with you.</HI>"</Q> The consequence was inevitable—not only the audience, but LEE him self felt the propriety of the reproof, and the quarrel was made up from that moment.</NOTE> whether every thing I had given them was my own? and in par∣ticular whether I wrote the words of the race horse? which was the proper way to learn <HI>music?</HI> whether it were better to begin with <HI>thorough bass,</HI> the <HI>gamut,</HI> or <HI>by ear?</HI> and if a scholar should touch the instrument <HI>at first,</HI> or a <HI>year and a half afterwards?</HI> These, together with many tenders of civi∣lity, particularly letters to INDIA—which I always took the freedom to ac∣cept—made up the interval between the first and second parts of my enter∣tainment; and these having loosely set down, in this letter, as it were by way of act-tune, I shall in my next call your attention to the performance, first pausing to tell you how very sincerely I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIX. <HI>A SKETCH OF CRUDE VIRTUE AND VICE.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>Nature's nature every where.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE ULYSSES is lamenting his bad success, he is surrounded by an APE who had been a COXCOMB—a SPARROW who had been a COQUETTE—a BEAR who had been a PLAIN DEALER—a HEN who had been a WIDOW—and several others, who wondering at his impudence in attempting to set up the blind and uncertain dictates of REASON against the sure and unerring impulse of INSTINCT, fairly hoot him off the island.</P>
<P>This <HI>extract</HI> was then succeeded by the following sketch—which I thus introduced.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to shew that the passions of <HI>envy</HI> and <HI>resentment</HI> are as <HI>implacable</HI> and as full of <HI>subtile refinement</HI> in the hearts of the most <HI>unin∣formed</HI> as the most <HI>polished.</HI> CUDGO was a NEGRO, and QUACO a MULATTO. See how QUACO ridicules CUDGO for being further degenerated only in <HI>one</HI> degree from the European complexion than himself. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah damn you,"</Q> says QUACO, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you a black dog—you a <HI>Jenny Neger</HI>—you don't tan like a me."</Q> He then sings—
<Q><PB N="359" REF="385"/>
<L>"Common NEGER go down the road side,</L>
<L>"UUCLE BEN walk up in the high road,</L>
<L>"Tan yanda you black <HI>Jenny</HI> rascal.</L>
<L>"Common NEGER drink out of <HI>wooden bowl,</HI></L>
<L>"UNCLE BEN drink out <HI>of china bason</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Can there be more pointed satire than this? Does it not convey all the conscious force of pride, pre-eminence, place, and precedence, as strongly as words can express? He then goes on upbraiding him with his ignorance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah you black dog, do'nt you know bout the rum, when you savee put letter under a tone."</Q> CUDGO, it seems, was carrying a jug of rum and a letter to a friend of his master, but meeting with another negro on the road, he accosted—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah how you do buddy."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Ah,'</Q> replied the other, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what buddy CUDGO! wat a divle you carry one someting dere.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh dis—he da buckra rum master savee send um to anudder buckra lib in great house yonder."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah buddy—let us all two take a lilly sup.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah dam,"</Q> says CUDGO, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you no see paper? Paper la talk—he savee tell massa."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah buddy—appose we put paper under a tone—den he no see.'</Q> Charmed with this idea, they agreed to hide the letter under a stone. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah buddy, dis be good stuff! savee make a heart jump!'</Q> Having drank pretty heartily, they begin to think of the consequence. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah dam—jug no full now."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Buddy, buddy,'</Q> says the other, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'come to the ribbor, put lilly wee drop water.'</Q> This ex∣ecuted, CUDGO takes the letter and jogs on with the jug to his master's friend, who not finding the rum above proof, exclaims—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Why what is all this, you scoundrel? You have been drinking the <HI>rum</HI> and filled the jug with <HI>water.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah massa,"</Q> says CUDGO, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do'nt you vex—indeed I no do nothing."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Nothing!—what do you think I can't read?</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, massa, if I no tell buddy Tom so—dat dam paper savee talk very wicked for poor neger man."</Q></P>
<P>These and other taunts and reproaches, which have in them all the ridi∣culous pride and contemptible folly of self-consequence, at length rouses the NEGRO—who falls foul of the MULATTO with equal success, and in such
<PB N="360" REF="386"/>
terms, that had JUVENAL been a NEGRO he would have written in the lan∣guage of CUDGO. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why now,"</Q> says CUDGO, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you tink you dam creber fella too I appose—you no NEGER—no BUCKRA—no <HI>any ting.</HI> You dam <HI>yellow copper kin</HI>—you <HI>no nation</HI>—you a <HI>mule</HI>—I make a sing upon you.<Q><LG TYPE="song">

<P>The MULATTO, who bore with great patience the satire on <HI>himself,</HI> is roused to the highest pitch of indignation at the lampoon on his sister—at which moment the gentle ORRA—a real Indian, who had imbibed nothing beyond the uncontaminated simplicity of her native wilds, and consequently approached nearer to primitive virtue—ORRA, who had for the first time left her home in search of her YANKO, whose absence, though compelled by duty, she could no longer bear—this ORRA surprized the uplifted arm of the
<PB N="361" REF="387"/>
MULATTO, just when his insidious revenge impelled him to aim a death blow at the heart of CUDGO. ORRA, though a <HI>woman,</HI> seized QUACO like a <HI>lioness</HI>—crying out <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah shame, kill your buddy.'</Q> This enraged QUACO the more. He cried out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Buddy!—what dam neger rascal from Jenny, QUACO buddy?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Yes,'</Q> replied ORRA, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>every man</HI> your <HI>buddy, every woman</HI> my <HI>sissy:</HI>—poor dear YANKO tell so—and he honest man for true.</Q></P>

LEE, when he was manager at EDINBURGH, was determined to improve upon thunder, and so having procured a parcel of nine pound shot, they were put into a wheelbarrow, to which he affixed an octagon wheel. This done, there were ridges placed at the back of the stage, and one of the carpenters was ordered to trundle this wheelbarrow, so filled and accoutred, backwards and forwards over these ridges'</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I hope,"</Q> says the carpenter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he would not get any of them to do it for him."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Not one,'</Q> said the actor, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'they had too much partiality for their old friend the thunder trunk.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And they were right too,"</Q> said the carpenter. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The best feather in your wing Master <HI>Tragedy.</HI> You may rant <HI>gemmen</HI>—but if the thunder did not come for the <HI>corps de resarve,</HI> and introduce the <HI>handy climax,</HI> as a body may say, your lungs I believe would cut but a poorish figure."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well,'</Q> said the actor, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what was to be done? LEE was resolved to have his thunder, and employed an <HI>Elve</HI> of his, an actor of all work, to turn carpenter on the occasion. The play was <HI>Lear,</HI> and really, in the two first efforts, the thunder had a good effect. At length the poor bald-pated king was braving <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the pitiless pelting of the storm,"</Q> when the thunderer's foot slipt, and down he came, wheelbarrow and all. The stage being of course on a declivity, the balls made their way towards the <HI>orchestra,</HI> and meeting with but a feeble resistance from the scene, pre∣sently laid it slat, on its face. LEAR was now to be encountered by a storm
<PB N="370" REF="396"/>
much more difficult to stem than that which he had before complained of. The balls taking every kind of direction, he was under the necessity of skipping about to avoid them, exactly like the man who dances the <HI>egg hornpipe</HI>; nor was this all—the fiddlers, fearing a demolition of their <HI>catgut,</HI> catched up their instruments and skuttled out of the <HI>orchestra</HI> as hard as they could drive, while, to crown this glorious scene of confusion, the sprawling actor, in the sight of the audience, lay prostrate like another SALMONEUS.'</Q></P>

<P>The song over, and the actors returned from making an experiment of the new thunder, the conversation became general again, and the story of LEE and his thunder insensibly produced another anecdote of LEE. When this strange man—who would have been a good MANAGER but for his <HI>pride,</HI> and second to but very few as an ACTOR but for his <HI>particularity</HI>—had the <HI>manage∣ment</HI> of the theatre at BATH, one of the actresses wanted to get up <HI>Tamer∣lane</HI> for her benefit.

<P>Talking of LEE, they went over the old matter of his being a strong ob∣ject of GARRICK's <HI>envy.</HI> This brought up GEORGE GARRICK, and his at∣tachment to his brother. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Have not you observed,'</Q> said one, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'how anxiously he always attended to the minutest matters that he conceived would give pleasure to DAVID—in particular the nights he performed all must be as still as death—not a mouse must stir—while through <HI>affection</HI> to the BROTHER and <HI>gratitude</HI> to the FRIEND, the worthy GEORGE was every where en∣treating, persuading, and threatening, to induce all those who were behind the scenes to be silent. Hush—hush—was he every minute heard to say.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why if this be the case,"</Q> said another, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is not wonderful DAVID should allow him so handsome a salary, for it is plain he received it for <HI>hush money.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'His attachment to DAVID,'</Q> said another, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'was exemplary; what trou∣ble he had in the business of KENRICK. Do you know the story of the challenge?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not exactly,"</Q> said the first. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I will tell it you then,'</Q> said the other. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'KENRICK wrote an infamous poem, for which the world very justly held him in detestation, GARRICK's first feelings in this business were pretty <HI>vif,</HI> and he sent, by <HI>his brother,</HI> a message, which he called a chal∣lenge. GEORGE perhaps, out of tenderness, delivered it rather delicately, and KENRICK, taking advantage of this ambiguity, made an equivocal reply to it. GARRICK, after this, said he had challenged KENRICK, and he would not meet him. This, being the general talk, came to KENRICK's ears, who sent GARRICK the following letter.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir—As I find you report that you sent me a challenge, and that I have not spirit enough to meet you—I now inform you that I received no sort of message from you but through YOUR BROTHER, which was worded so doubtfully, that added to his being
<PB N="375" REF="401" MS="y"/>
an <HI>improper person</HI> for the transaction of such a business, I did not feel my∣self obliged to understand it in the light you <HI>now</HI> say it was meant. To shew you, however, you have mistaken me, I will finish the matter in two words: You have a large fortune and no family—I have a large family and no fortune—If therefore you will settle only three hundred a year on those I leave behind—provided you kill me—I will not only fight YOU, but your brother GEORGE into the bargain."</Q></P>
<P>I did not always, as you well know, introduce so much into this part of the entertainment; but I dare say, as the theatre is so popular a subject, every thing I can recollect will be welcome to the public.</P>

<P>In the same pantomime was a scene of a whimsical nature. PIERROT is left at a tavern to watch out for HARLEQUIN, who is expected there, and told he may call for what he chuses. If he wants any thing to eat, he has but to say <HI>what,</HI> and they will bring it to him. If he would amuse himself, he has only to say <HI>how,</HI> and he may take his choice of entertainments. And if he would chuse any sorts of wine, he has nothing to do but say <HI>which,</HI> and they will be instantly brought to him. Having conned his lesson, and beginning to get sleepy, he wishes for a little dancing and singing to keep
<PB N="178" REF="404" MS="y"/>
him awake, and hollows out—<Q REND="inline">'<HI>How!</HI>'</Q> After he had repeated this word several times, the waiter comes in, asks him if he called, and says he shall be very glad to wait upon him. PIERROT repeats <Q REND="inline">'<HI>How.</HI>'</Q> The waiter answers in any way he pleases. Thus the word <HI>how</HI> is played upon till PIERROT finding it procures him no amusement, changes it to <HI>what</HI>—which bawling out pretty powerfully, the waiter thinks he is affronted, and begins to apolo∣gize, saying, he plainly sees he has mistaken him, being a foreigner, but that he meant no offence. There are good and bad of all countries. PIERROT by this time tired of calling out <HI>what,</HI> has recourse to his third expedient, and cries louder than ever—<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Which.</HI>'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why all countries,"</Q> replies the waiter. <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Which,</HI>'</Q> vociferates PIERROT. At length the waiter—getting nothing from him but <HI>how—what—which</HI>—says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why surely this fellow is either mad or drunk."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Which,</HI>'</Q> says PIERROT. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh damme if I know <HI>which</HI>"</Q> returns the waiter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but I'll swear you are either one or t'other."</Q></P>
<P>A repetition of this scene, brought on an account of the plan of the pan∣tomime itself. It was constructed—in the opinion of the actor who mentioned it, and who had the confidence of the poet—upon a very new and entertain∣ing idea. HARLEQUIN runs away with COLUMBINE, the DOCTOR's wife, and leaves his own wife, HARLEQUINETTE, in the DOCTOR's house. These last two, with their familiar spirits, are, through the whole business, the pur∣suers—but, their power being rather inferior to that of HARLEQUIN, they obtain their wishes <HI>figuratively,</HI> but not <HI>literally.</HI> Thus HARLEQUINETTE dooms them in one place to <HI>death and destruction,</HI> and the scene immediately changes to an apothecary's shop. In another place she entreats her spirits to convey them to where they will be surrounded with <HI>voracious animals,</HI> and instantly they find themselves at a LORD MAYOR's feast.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This pantomime I put into the hands of the Drury-lane managers a considerable while before <HI>Harlequin Junior</HI> came out at that theatre. That piece has certainly some smack of mine, and as Mr. SHERIDAN spoke very handsomely of it to me, in <HI>Great Queen-street,</HI> without mentioning its having the smallest similarity to any thing else, it is not unfair to conclude that it furnished them with a hint, since they did not perform my pantomime. However, I will not say it was their intention to reject it, for before I knew their positive determination—which indeed might possibly have remained untold to this moment—I withdrew it myself, in conformity to my agreement at the <HI>Circus,</HI> which precluded me from getting any piece performed elsewhere.</P><P>I shall take this opportunity of mentioning that I sent a piece to Mr. COLMAN, through the <HI>me∣dium</HI> of Mr. WOODFALL, called <HI>The Wits,</HI> which was returned. From this piece a whole scene was taken into the <HI>Managers in Distress</HI> almost literally. Mr. COLMAN may say—for no man, as may be seen by his works, has read more French authors—that the scene in question was borrowed from the FRENCH, and therefore—<HI>fair game</HI>; but it may be retorted, that it was <HI>imitated,</HI> not <HI>translated</HI>; and though the original will furnish a hint, which any body has a right to take, it is a very curious thing that two men should <HI>imitate</HI> a French author in almost the same words. Besides, the ingenuous way would have been, at the time the piece was rejected, to have given for a reason, that there was already in his hands something on the same subject.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="405"/>They finished the subject of the pantomime by reading two of HARLE∣QUINETTE's songs, which they found to be a tolerable burlesque of <HI>operatical poetry.</HI> The first ran thus:</P>

<P>Pantomimes in general were now talked about, and one of the actors gave an account of a Dutch one, upon the subject of ABRAHAM and ISAAC. ABRAHAM is on the point of offering up his son, and having tied him to a stake, he very leisurely takes out an old rusty horse pistol, and measuring six paces with great deliberation, presents his piece, when, all of a sudden, he finds some wet descend into the pan and damp the powder, when, looking up, he sees an angel in a certain attitude, who had caused what he had mistaken for rain. In the midst of ABRAHAM's consternation, he cries out—<HI>Der traple Abram wilt ta te youncker slauken.</HI> In another scene there are a number of windmills which HARLEQUIN, in the most <HI>delicate</HI> way that can be ima∣gined, <HI>sets a going.</HI> Getting further into the subject of Dutch pieces, they talked of their tragedies. The famous <HI>Cid</HI> of CORNEILLE it seems is cu∣riously translated for the edification of the <HI>Mynheers.</HI> There is a well-known passage in the play where the father of RODORIGO stimulates his son to revenge, and not satisfied with the assurance he had before given him, stopping him

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last vehicle for the conveyance of my enter∣tainment was, as you know, a masquerade—at which I suppose my audience present. I say it is made up of all those characters which generally distinguish it, and presents you with a mixture of pertness, insipidity, folly, tinsel, glare, and dulness. And first the DOMINOS—grave, elegant, genteel, and stupid—as vacantly solemn as a procession of undertakers. Then KINGS and QUEENS, as little what they represent as a straw-crowned monarch in bedlam. Next HARLEQUINS without <HI>heels,</HI> and POETS, LAWYERS, and STATESMEN with∣out <HI>heads.</HI> FOXHUNTERS who were never far enough in the country to <HI>see</HI> a five barred gate. SCHOLARS who <HI>decline</HI> so well they are obliged to <HI>decline</HI> answering any question on the subject of grammar. DEVILS as harmless as LAMBS, and NUNS as impudent as DEVILS. FRENCHMEN in <HI>boots, bob wigs,</HI> and <HI>round hats,</HI> shaking hands with ENGLISHMEN in <HI>stays, shoe strings,</HI> and <HI>cheek whiskers.</HI> QUAKERS, whose inward light blazes in their faces, through the strength of the wine they have drank. SAILORS who can hand the bottle, reef the bill, and steer the glass to their mouths, but no more. In short, all that heterogeneous crew who break their constitutions, and run into expence, for no motive upon earth but to expose themselves. And yet,

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NEXT come a set composed of different profes∣sions, who are talking—<HI>technically</HI> you may be assured—for and against the present administration. Says a GLOVER—it is true the minister is but a <HI>kid,</HI> but then he has such <HI>supple</HI> and <HI>lamb-like</HI> way with him, that he <HI>draws</HI> us <HI>on</HI> and <HI>off</HI> as he pleases. Oh Sir, says a LAWYER, there are <HI>errors</HI> in all their <HI>proceedings,</HI> their <HI>measures</HI> are all made up of <HI>flaws, sham pleas, nihils,</HI> and <HI>non est inventuses.</HI> Come, come, says a FISH MONGER, you may deal about your <HI>Billingsgate abuse,</HI> but their measures have made us all <HI>leaping alive</HI>; we were as flat as <HI>flounders</HI> before they came into office—but there are some men who will <HI>carp</HI> at every thing, and can't see their own advantage till, like an <HI>eel,</HI> it has <HI>slipt through their fingers.</HI> The <HI>little fry</HI> of <HI>opposition</HI> have no more chance with the <HI>administration,</HI> than a <HI>shrimp</HI> would have with a <HI>whale.</HI> In short, the nation's hopes are as firm as a <HI>turbot,</HI> and the consti∣tution as sound a sa <HI>roach,</HI> and none but a parcel of <HI>cod's headed fellows</HI> would ever attempt to say any thing to the contrary. I say, cries out a CORPORAL, they do'nt know the manoeuvre of the thing. If I was a minister, d'ye see, there should be no <HI>jumping over heads.</HI> I'd <HI>drill em</HI>—I'd <HI>ratan 'em</HI> into the <HI>ranks.</HI> Why I'll tell you what I'd do—I would raise the pay of all the <HI>pri∣vates,</HI>
<PB N="394" REF="422"/>
and make every <HI>Corporal</HI> a COLONEL. Come, come, says a DYER, don't you talk—I say the administration is a <HI>colour in grain,</HI> and will stand when <HI>buff</HI> and <HI>blue</HI> shall have entirely <HI>flown off.</HI> I am an honest man—never say <HI>black's white.</HI> I am willing therefore, d'ye see, to <HI>die</HI> for my country whenever I am commanded, and they who refuse to do the same ought to be beaten into all <HI>colours of the rainbow.</HI> They have got the <HI>length</HI> of the <HI>nation's foot</HI> to be sure, says a COBLER, where it will <HI>end</HI> is another matter—some men's belief is as hard as a <HI>lapstone</HI>; but then again, nobody knows where the <HI>shoe pinches</HI> so well as those who wear it. And yet I thinks if as how the peo∣ple would but <HI>buckle</HI> too a little, every <HI>soul</HI> would have reason to be contented at <HI>last.</HI> Don't tell me, says a TALLOW CHANDLER, of the present ministry, has there been a single <HI>rejoicing night</HI> since they came in?

</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING purposely reserved about forty pages for general observations, I shall methodize them, by recapitulating very briefly those parts of the work which may yet remain for explanation, and others, which at present, have probably a contradictory complexion. Also, as I have taken leave to speak with some freedom, and must of course expect to be treated as freely in return, I shall suppose what <HI>will</HI> be said of me; and as those snar∣lers, who doubtless mean not to spare their critical flings, cannot, fortunately for them, <HI>bark</HI> till I am out of hearing, I mean to <HI>muzzle</HI> them before I go—and first, as in duty bound, for the musicians.</P>
<P>I forbid all gentlemen of the <HI>bow, reed,</HI> or <HI>finger,</HI> to accuse me of igno∣rance or innovation—to assert that I am no musician—to laugh at my feeble ef∣forts to overthrow their long established impositions—to advance <HI>ipse dixits,</HI> and flatter themselves that they will be creditted <HI>facts</HI>—to persuade the world they have silenced my objections, when they have only confused themselves—to hold out terms of art in place of candid argument. I forbid them also to publish any thing they do not write themselves—to have recourse to any but their own orthography—to attempt at wit—to believe they write calmly and in
<PB N="408" REF="440"/>
good humour, at the moment they are bursting with envy; and I require all persons whatever to pay no attention, nor give credit to any matter or thing that may be set down in such criticisms of the said gentlemen of the <HI>bow, reed,</HI> or <HI>finger,</HI> provided they come under the aforesaid prohibition. But, to shew my candour and openness of conviction, I hereby subscribe beforehand to all fair, dispassionate argument, which, without subterfuge, and in plain language clearly understood by readers of all descriptions, shall be so written as to over∣turn mine.</P>
<P>I desire all <HI>gentlemen</HI> of the LAW—whether licensed or unlicensed—whe∣ther they pursue <HI>unjust</HI> EQUITY, or <HI>inequitable</HI> JUSTICE—whether their line be <HI>swindling</HI> or <HI>bankruptcy</HI>—whether they are <HI>affidavit-makers,</HI> or <HI>information hunters</HI>—whether their favourite instrument of ruin be a <HI>bond,</HI> a <HI>cognovit,</HI> a <HI>warrant of attorney,</HI> a <HI>mortgage,</HI> a <HI>post obit,</HI> or <HI>an annuity</HI>—whether their nice distinctions between <HI>perjury</HI> and <HI>false-swearing,</HI> go most to <HI>hang</HI> the INNO∣CENT, or <HI>save</HI> the GUILTY—or indeed whatever legal infamy they may be most expert in—I desire all such will abuse, revile, and calumniate me where∣ever they go; being well convinced that this conduct on their part will ope∣rate much more to my advantage, than any thing they can say in my favour: the praise of ill men being the most wounding of all satire. And I particularly request all manner of persons whatsoever, if they hear of any encomiums, pa∣negyrics, or any sort of commendations paid me by men of the above descrip∣tion, that they will have the liberality to consider such encomiums, panegy∣rics, or commendations, as so many studied attempts to abuse and injure me, and that they will, in their charitable goodness, treat them accordingly.</P>
<P>At the same time I beg leave to recommend myself and this work to the kind attention and good wishes of the <HI>worthy very few,</HI> who make the laws a benefit and a blessing to their fellow creatures—whose study is to spare, to me∣diate, and to console—who poise the balance of justice so even, that it may not <HI>incline</HI> in the estimation of a single hair while the reclined sword sleeps
<PB N="409" REF="441"/>
peaceably in its scabbard—to all such men do I commend myself, as the only description of characters competent to guard the lives and property of indivi∣duals, and to such I entreat all manner of persons to attend, as the only court where JUSTICE and EQUITY go hand in hand, and therefore, whose compe∣tency to determine they and I ought to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I desire all managers, and their adherents, not to have the smallest unea∣siness concerning me, but to sleep perfectly at ease, depending upon their al∣liances with the newspapers, to blacken and confound those assertions of mine which they cannot controvert. I advise them also not to put themselves to any inconvenience concerning the style and manner of their entertainments; but, since genius and judgment are not to be commanded, jog on in the old way, relying upon the goodnature of the English, and the fecundity of their own imaginations in the art of puffing. In their report of me, I court their repro∣bation, upon the same principle, and for the same reason I do that of the law∣yers. I desire they will indulge themselves to the full extent of their wishes; and in particular, let them not fail to <HI>cut</HI> a great many JOKES, and <HI>let</HI> a great many PUNS. As to my future intentions, I would wish them to believe that I am <HI>not</HI> going to INDIA, but, on the contrary, that I shall by and by solicit to be received among them; and I recommend them to enjoy, in <HI>contemplation,</HI> the slavery, subjection, and humiliation, which they shall hereafter see me in; and to meditate the most expedient modes of varying and continuing such treatment against the time—which I would have them flatter themselves will arrive upon holding up a finger—when they shall have me again in their clutches. And I entreat all and every person or persons to whose knowledge this subject may come, if it so happen that nothing shall be advanced by way of answer to whatever I may have asserted, to believe—in spite of the affected in∣difference such conduct may seem to convey—that it will be put on for no other reason than because my arguments are unanswerable, and because an at∣tempt to refute them, would only shew the weakness of their cause, but betray that secret envy which would operate equal to a confession of the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="442"/>My next jubject will be the Reviewers, a few twigs of whose critical rod at least I shall be able to break; and, if every writer had the same con∣stancy, that tremendous object, that terrific hobgoblin which men of weak minds and slender intellects worship—as Indians do the devil—out of fear, would very soon appear a poor, inoffensive thing, engendered only by spleni∣tive ideas, and a contemplation of cobwebs in libraries.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for your fears, because they arise from friendship, but be assured they arise from a false view of the matter. Tell me what you think when you have read the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the REVIEWERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I should be glad to know by what authority you take upon you to pronounce away the good name of those authors who come under the lash of your criticism, or bid others rise into fame whose works have the tran∣scendant advantage of your decree in their favour.</P>
<P>If you are a chartered body—though I never heard of any power compe∣tent to confirm such establishment—and have an exclusive right to exercise laws not cognizable by other courts of criticism, I have only to lament that, in a country like this, there should be a literary inquisition; for as no persuasion is so likely to breed schisms as the study of letters, so every man's opinion may, by the exercise of very slender abilities, be construed into critical heterodox, for which impiety—should it really appear that he is amenable to your juris∣diction
<PB N="412" REF="444"/>—what racks and slow fires may not be dreaded on the first day of every month, when you regularly celebrate your <HI>aute de se.</HI></P>
<P>Being an Englishman, therefore, I call upon all others to protest—as I do myself upon this present occasion—against the competency of your power; having no scruple to declare that, as wounding the mind is a torture of a much more exquisite nature than lacerating the body, so the cruelties you practise are as reprehensible a violence on erudition, as those of SPAIN or PORTUGAL were on religion. I know your advocates have thrown out to palliate the matter, that you wound with <HI>blunt</HI> arrows, which in my opinion is an aggravation of your inhumanity—for every body knows the <HI>keenest</HI> weapon inflicts the least pain.</P>
<P>I have often laughed at the susceptibility of literary men, concerning your criticisms. Some have gnashed their teeth, and imputed all you have said to ENVY, which, as far as my humble judgment serves me, does not appear—for, by the little I have seen, your temperaments are too frigid to admit of any such tingling passion. Others have been ready to burst, while they swore they endured their torture with all the intrepidity and resolution of primitive Americans. In short, the sensibility of all is in some degree wounded, and every one threatens you with a cutting answer—which he dares not write.</P>
<P>On these occasions, my constant advice is, not to read you at all, and then you might as well have not written at all; for if the writer himself be not hurt, the rest of the world find in you only what they expected; and after your reviews have wrapt up stuff, black pins, or pectoral lozenges, or been appropriated to other uses—which, if they were written to mortify unfortu∣nate authors, are at least as worthy as those for which they were designed—you are as little regarded as any other temporary casualty, which excites our wonder to-day, and to-morrow is forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="445"/>Some, however, look into you upon the principle of the man who wants to be taken up—in hopes of being abused. COLLEY CIBBER used to tell his son, that so he contrived to let the world speak of him, it did not matter what it said; and, as far as it relates to you, I look upon this maxim of his to be much about the fact. But, lest you should imagine I affect all this careless∣ness, in the moment I am under the keenest apprehensions as to what you may chuse to say relative to this TOUR, I'll put the certainty of my enjoy∣ing the very tranquillity I describe so far—even beyond <HI>your</HI> power to doubt or reason away—that you shall, in this instance at least, confess—those who re∣view the imperfections of others do not always appear the most perfect, upon a review, themselves.</P>
<P>When a prejudice has taken root in an early mind, it is pretty difficult to remove it—especially when planted by <HI>reason,</HI> and strengthened by <HI>experience.</HI> Eighteen years ago, I wrote a piece called <HI>The Wedding Ring,</HI> and so much did I dread the reviewers, that in the most irresolute state, I walked up and down GEORGE's <HI>coffee house,</HI> with a review in each hand, for a considerable time, without the courage to open either of them. At length, plucking up spirits, I sneaked into the most obscure corner I could find, and was presently lifted into ecstacy by reading, as nearly as I can remember, the following words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This piece is an imitation of <HI>Il Filosofo di Campagna.</HI> It is done into English by Mr. DIBDIN, who has improved on the original, and rendered it a very pleasing entertainment."</Q></P>
<P>Having swallowed with avidity these <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"honey words,"</Q> I began to think if I were to fortunate in my first search, that probably on a second, I should still have greater reason to rejoice; and like a man who, instead of quietly pocketing the money for a twenty pound prize in the lottery, leaves it behind for a ticket which comes up a blank, I was determined to stand another lite∣rary chance, regardless of what might be the consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="446"/>Upon opening the other review, I found these words, or at least perfectly the sense of them:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This piece, which is taken from <HI>Il Filosofo di Campagna,</HI> has very lit∣tle to recommend it to the notice of the public—'tis much inferior to the original, and Mr. DIBDIN has no pretensions, upon this occasion, to think himself capable of furnishing an agreeable entertainment to the public."</Q></P>
<P>I have already said that this happened eighteen years ago, therefore I will not swear to the <HI>letter</HI> of these articles, to the <HI>spirit</HI> however I do most peremp∣torily. It had as strong an effect upon me, as being introduced behind the curtain of a jugler or a puppetshew-man, and so completely was I in the se∣cret, that I made a resolution, which I have ever since religiously kept, not to read a single review of any thing I should write from that moment. As therefore I pique myself upon acknowledging obligations, I desire you will accept my sincerest thanks for grubbing up by the root, as it were, all those mortifications, which on reading that abuse sure to be levelled—deservedly or undeservedly—at public characters, I might have felt in common with other men; for to the detection of the inconsistency recorded above, I owe my ne∣ver having answered in my whole life a single printed calumny, unless it has been of so injurious a nature that it could not be passed over, and then I have constantly signed my name. Whatever you say therefore of this TOUR will be unread by me—I advise you, however, to look to your own consistency; and properly to do so, it will not hurt you if you peruse the following letter to my reverend friend, which will treat wholly of general criticism.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CI. <HI>A CRITICAL EXAMINATION.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"<HI>Asham'd, she marks the passage with a blot,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>And hates the line where candour was forgot.</HI>"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has often been allowed that the talents for a <HI>writer</HI> and a <HI>critic</HI> are distinct and separate. If by this it be meant that the knack of finding fault is easier than the capacity to invent and improve, the po∣sition is a fair one; but this would prove mere cavilling to be true criticism, which I will not admit. The truth is, no man can with the proper degree of perspicuity, feeling, and tenderness, analyze the work of a writer, <HI>but a writer</HI>; and all those who poach for errors, and take away imperfections with∣out the ability to leave beauties in their place, are not real judges of what they arrogate a right to decide on, and consequently, ought not to be entitled critics.</P>
<P>In this light perhaps the matter has not always been seen, and yet it is the only one which will give it its true colour. Modern criticism, is like look∣ing at the sun to discover only the <HI>spots,</HI> while the <HI>servour</HI> and <HI>brilliancy</HI> of <HI>his lustre</HI> are disregarded: but ought an ingenious and enlightened age to pay the effusions of such folly a moment's attention? No. Let the decisions upon works of genius come from men who possess congenial sentiments; these only are qualified for the task, and will be most likely to treat with candour and de∣licacy that which they know the pain and labour of producing, and look with
<PB N="416" REF="448"/>
care and circumspection before they venture to wound those parts, in others, which, upon fair inspection, they may find vulnerable in themselves.</P>
<P>I will not say, should personal enmity or rooted difference of opinion in∣terfere, that severity in place of lenity will not sometimes be adopted. Men are fallible, and a bold and flowing pen is a tempting instrument to accelerate the dictates of revenge; but even then, they will always remember that their antagonists can weild the same weapon, and, for the world's improvement, 'tis well such conflicts are: the <HI>loss of victory</HI> is some triumph in a noble con∣test. I know not whether KING JOHN of FRANCE, waited on by the BLACK PRINCE, is not almost at that moment as much an object of envy, as his IL∣LUSTRIOUS CONQUEROR.</P>
<P>I am clearly of opinion that if literary works were to appear only before such a tribunal, the press would be more employed, and the amendment have this operation: dawning merit would be fostered; mature abilities stimulated to a repetition of their exertions; and, what would be equally a public bene∣fit, <HI>pretenders</HI> would be at once <HI>silenced</HI>—whereas, thanks to <HI>reviews, newspa∣pers,</HI> and <HI>pamphlets,</HI> men of real talents are deterred from ornamenting the world with their productions, and the dull, vapid offspring of insipidity and ignorance puffed into fame. Let me beseech, therefore, all those who read, weigh, and approve these reasons, to prescribe for themselves the following simple and efficient rule.</P>
<P>When any man decries a work of genius, let him be asked if he can do as well; or, if his opinions be public, let enquiry be made as to his <HI>own pro∣ductions,</HI> and do not let him be credited, unless something be found equal in consequence, as to every literary requisite, to the work he undertakes to cri∣ticise.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="449"/>As to pointing out mere inaccuracies, it is not more invidious and con∣temptible, than it is an affront to the reader, by whom these critical gentle∣men chuse to act in the quality of schoolmaster; besides, there cannot be a higher compliment to him they would affect to condemn—for it both implies that his FAULTS are <HI>trifles,</HI> and his MERIT <HI>beyond the reach of their capacity.</HI></P>
<P>The observations here made have this drift. I do not know that from any body a volume of this size would be more considered as a piece of consum∣mate arrogance than from myself; and when it is understood that I have pre∣sumed to speak plainly of popular subjects, and advanced decided sentiments which, were they to obtain, would go to the correction at least of several fa∣vourite follies, I know not where the clamour may stop. Should it be very loud, however, I shall beg leave of the candid and ingenuous to enquire <HI>who</HI> are clamourous, and if it turn out to be the very men whose impositions on the public are the objects of my reprehension, every one whose opinion I have a legitimate right to value, will rank on my side, and then let us see whether an army of critical malecontents will stand any chance with such a phalanx.</P>
<P>Nothing in nature is so easy as to find fault. <HI>Bright geniuses</HI> as naturally breed <HI>critics</HI> as the <HI>sun</HI> engenders <HI>flies.</HI> Who has fed more grubs than Dr. JOHNSON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of these was congratulating another on some recent success, when he was answered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh this is nothing at all—stay till I do the Dictionary."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, surely,"</Q> said the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you would not have the impudence to attack that—no, no, he's safe there."</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Aye! how so?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why he has given the real etymology of all words from every authority he could gather."</Q> <Q REND="inline">'God,'</Q> said the critic, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I did not know that, <HI>for I never read it,</HI> but if that is the case, it won't do, sure enough—for what <HI>every body says,</HI> MUST BE TRUE.'</Q></NOTE>—therefore let the witlings take care, for they may be assured, in proportion as they are abusive so they will lift me into consequence.</P>
<P>Yet will I, by way of caution to the judicious, say a few words. If when I am gone it should be advanced that any of my assertions are false, let
<PB N="418" REF="450"/>
the manner of my making them be considered, the proofs I adduce examined, and the ground of their probability looked into.</P>
<P>If it be said that while I reprobate criticisms I arrogate the title of critic myself, thereby insinuating that I have a right to rank with the only descrip∣tion which, according to my idea, are competent to decide on works of lite∣rature, I beg to say that mine are not <HI>criticisms,</HI> but mere <HI>observations</HI>; and that they do not go to the correction of <HI>errors,</HI> but <HI>abuses.</HI> For instance: What does all I say of Mr. SHERIDAN amount to, but that he could have written and invented much better, and probably would have done so, had he not conceived that if he had outgone WYCHERLY and CONGREVE, he would have been gazed at as a <HI>comet,</HI> and then lost; whereas his business was to move like a <HI>planet</HI> in the regular course of periodical revolution?</P>
<P>If it be remarked that I, <HI>irregularly bred</HI>—according to my own confes∣sion—in the school of music, have presumed to hold forth a rod for the cor∣rection of public taste—which has been formed by the combined excellence of men whose abilities have received universal admiration—let it be remembered, that I only wish to prune the luxuriant and superfluous branches off this <HI>tree of taste,</HI> and throw away the <HI>rotten</HI> and <HI>withered fruit,</HI> that so it may produce <HI>vigorously</HI> that <HI>quantity</HI> it is capable of bearing, giving it <HI>beauty, maturity,</HI> and <HI>flavour.</HI></P>
<P>My next will contain a discussion of these matters in a lighter way; by the end of which, I shall have pretty well anticipated all objections in a literary point of view—except my general errata, which I reserve for the last letter but one. Adieu. I shall soon have done <HI>subscribing myself,</HI> but never <HI>being</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been frequently considered by authors as a sufficient apology for the incongruity of their works, that they were written in a hurry—which by the way is the last excuse that ought to be made. Is it done to give an idea that the public will swallow any thing, be it ever so crude or immature? Or would they seem to say, See what an excellent composi∣tion I have given you in so short a time—what would it have been if I had taken <HI>pains</HI> about it.</P>
<P>How unfortunate am I then who am obliged to offer this hacknied excuse for the crudities that are to be found in this book, which has been written in a greater hurry than ever book was. A friend of mine was firmly of opinion that I should be at least a twelvemonth in getting it out from the first day I be∣gan to print; and I really may venture to affirm that so much <HI>ground of argu∣ment,</HI> and <HI>English ground,</HI> have never been gone over together, in so short a time; but I will not be so unfair, however, as to avail myself of this oppor∣tunity of getting off, but honestly confess, that though I have chosen a pretty extensive field, I do not think I could have explored it to better purpose, had I taken ever so much time—for I have put up plenty of game, and to have gone
<PB N="420" REF="452"/>
over all the shiftings and doublings, would perhaps have rendered the chace tedious, instead of amusing.</P>
<P>To speak literally, I might have expressed myself with more variety and closer accuracy than I have done; but <HI>correctness</HI> is with me a <HI>cold word,</HI> and if a revision of any thing take away of <HI>spirit</HI> more than it add of <HI>elegance,</HI> let me go into the world with whatever faults the critics can point out, so that men of strong feeling and candid discrimination will but acknowledge in me lively fancy, decent language, poignant remark, apt epithet, and argument something like axiom.</P>
<P>As times go, the art of keeping people awake has its merit; and if I can but accomplish this, I shall have triumphed over many writers, and those—not to speak it profanely—that I have heard praised too; who, believing that a man takes up a book to shun his thoughts, the more effectually to obliviate them—if they, literati, will admit my expression—seem as if they invented a sort of literary laudanum which should set him asleep without an obligation to the apothecary.</P>
<P>The temperatures of all authors are not alike. Some only muddy and confound their ideas by frequent thinking—like the actor, who reproved by RICH for being imperfect on the <HI>fifty-third</HI> night of the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good God, sir, would you have a man remember a thing for ever!"</Q> Others catch hold of superficial ideas which leave no perceptible trace in the mind, any more than a <HI>meteor</HI> in the air: these, though beautiful in the conception, come to nothing upon proof. They are as absurd as would be a specimen of a fine hand writing in vitriol, which would be lost upon be∣ing committed to paper, and destroy that which it solicited to embellish.</P>
<P>I shall be blamed by some for introducing so much figure—but I own I love imagery; and, where description is necessary—particularly in the latitude
<PB N="421" REF="453"/>
of epistolary writing, which it will be pretty difficult I believe to square by any rule as to its mode of language—I see no reason why this powerful literary auxiliary should not be called in to the assistance of <HI>prose</HI> as well as <HI>poetry.</HI></P>
<P>ADDISON writes on the pleasures of the imagination as critically exact, and in language as correctly chaste, as he introduces WILL WHIMBLE or SIR ROGER DE COVERLY's rookery—all which is perfectly laudable as far as it relates to establishing a reputation for a just and accurate style; but surely if he had been a little more volatile, and stretched a point to have given us a glowing description or two, on a subject so full of inspiration, it would not have hurt, but rather lent assistance to that sober solemnity which throughout his whole writings partakes a little too much of his Spectatorial taciturnity.—But it was his way—like the gravity of the BATH audience, or CERVETTO's <HI>yawn</HI>—and this granted, 'tis not impossible but that praise which POPE thought was meant to <HI>damn</HI>—it was so faint—conveyed, or was intended to do so, as warm an encomium as the frigid—or rather elegant—conception of the writer was capable of admitting.</P>
<P>For this reason, I think DRYDEN's prose is the best in our language—for though yet <HI>prose</HI> it has all the fire, strength, and imagination of <HI>poetry.</HI>—Yet cannot I quit this subject without noticing how much I admire the won∣derful ease of SWIFT. I would indeed, go through a list of all those who have delighted me, but that I hasten very fast to a finish of my journey, and can∣not stay to bait on the road, however agreeable may be the fare provided for me; and because, by the side of their superior productions, mine would shew like a simple <HI>field flower,</HI> compared to the beauty and richness of a variegated <HI>parterre.</HI></P>
<P>You, however, prize it, and for that and a thousand other reasons, I remain</P>

<Q>"<HI>There I gave it her home, brother Bruin.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have this moment finished reading, for the first time in a collected state, all the letters that are at present printed; and, instead of a general recapitulation of the whole matter, which I thought would be po∣sitively necessary, so well is the proper connection preserved—notwithstanding the manifest disadvantages I have laboured under—that I shall only have occa∣sion to rub off hardnesses, and throw in some finishing touches, to make this picture have a proper roundness and harmony in its general effects.</P>
<P>I have said, early in the work, that I expected to leave ENGLAND in the beginning of <HI>April</HI>—which it was certainly my firm determination to accom∣plish, had it been eligibly practicable; but I will candidly declare, that when I found, should I do so, I must have gone abroad in a more unpleasant way than—I thank my <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> friends—I am now likely to do, I thought I might take the liberty of altering my intention—especially as I can now make so desirable an apology to those who wish me well, which number I am sure is in a multiplied state, and by <HI>no mean figure,</HI> since I have had it in my power to tell my own story.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="455"/>It was my intention to have gone into the laws respecting the regulations of public entertainments, but as that business has not only been argued on in eve∣ry possible way, but at length taken the very form I long ago predicted it would, a further investigation of what is passed were totally unnecessary; I shall take the liberty, however, to offer a few words as to what may come of it, and mention how in my sense the matter ought to be. And first, it would be but common policy to introduce into the new bill, how the amusements are to be regulated beyond the circle of twenty miles out of LONDON, for I can assure Mr. MAINWARING that the proprietors of <HI>Theatres Royal,</HI> in the country, begin to grow very jealous of their privileges, and if they should form a mistaken zeal, or—what is full as likely—with an eye to their own advantage, put down all the <HI>Unli∣censed Theatres</HI>; or indeed should any indifferent person—now the laws are explained—do so for the reward, there is not an actor out of LONDON who would not starve; for it is not by the <HI>Theatres Royal,</HI> where they have a large rent, a number of servants, and heavy nightly expences to pay, but by the snug, comfortable, returns, and reasonable disbursements, that a scheme of this kind maintains itself. YORK is sure to lose money, but LEEDS and WAKEFIELD never fail to bring the company up again. In short, let the matter be equalized—let men, without respect of persons, who pay a sum of money and give security, have licences, which may be of various prices, ac∣cording to the nature of the entertainment meant to be given. This would exclude all possibility of monopoly, stimulate men of talents to exert them∣selves, and make the name of <HI>Actor</HI>—and why it should not be so no man upon earth can give a sensible reason—RESPECTABLE. It might also ultimately contribute towards the exigencies of the state, and, by a general regulation, be made, like the amusements in FRANCE, of national consequence. Mr. SHERIDAN has, I know, held out that it would not be productive, but the matter was not at that time pressed, otherwise there can be no doubt but he would have seen to the contrary; for it can be proved, without difficulty, that public amusements would yield, as a tax, forty thousand pounds a year. He has also talked lately that it would be a hardship, were the privileges of the
<PB N="424" REF="456"/>
TWO <HI>Theatres</HI>—as if they were guaranteed by patents to the exclusion of all others—<HI>should be trenched upon,</HI> for they are a property worth little less than two hundred thousand pounds. This is <HI>speculatively</HI> TRUE, but <HI>substantially</HI> FALSE;—but if it were literally the fact, there is not the smallest equity in this mode of argument. The <HI>Royalty Theatre,</HI> or the <HI>Circus,</HI> cost as large a sum <HI>originally</HI> as either <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> or <HI>Covent Garden Theatre</HI>; and if the <HI>wardrobe, scenes,</HI> and other articles have swelled the property to such an im∣mense sum—which by the bye is a little extraordinary, for the last time they were put up to sale one yielded but sixty and the other seventy thousand pounds—is it <HI>money</HI> or <HI>success</HI> that has produced it?</P>
<P>But to ask what this boasted property is worth, stript of the patent, is the only way to know its intrinsic value; in which case I believe we should find, that the trappings would be about equal to the mock honours of the actor who wears them; that nine-tenths of the scenes have been considered only as so much spare wood and canvas ever since the tragedy, opera, or pantomime they embellished was damned, or finished its run; and the gilt chariots, plumed caps, spears, shields, and all that waste of spangles and gilt leather that make processions stared at—thrown by to crowd up the flies, or encumber the pro∣perty-room. In short, to render Mr. SHERIDAN's meaning so as to make it consonant to common sense, is to suppose he says this: We had a large <HI>ideal</HI> property, which you <HI>realized,</HI> by giving us a power to exercise our trade of which that property is the <HI>working tools</HI>:—if you give these people an equal power, their property will be as large as ours—and this is not fair. Why?—Shall one merchant entreat government to prohibit the commerce of another, lest he also should grow rich? No—let each do his utmost, 'tis for the general good. Thus will a laudable emulation stimulate them to industry, and a watchfulness over each other prevent mutual abuses.</P>
<P>The sensible part of the world set down public amusements as ruined when Mr. SHERIDAN and Mr. HARRIS coalesced, and the short time that mo∣nopoly
<PB N="425" REF="457"/>
went on confirmed this truth so strongly, that it was clearly demon∣strable a petition for the emancipation of <HI>theatrical slaves</HI> would soon have been full as necessary as those at present preferred in favour of the <HI>Africans.</HI></P>
<P>I profess to be a little <HI>au fait</HI> to this matter, and therefore it must not to <HI>me</HI> be objected that more than two public places cannot subsist in LONDON at the same time. Have not houses, at an immense price, been purchased to be pulled down?—has not invention been racked to prop the crazy walls and roofs of the <HI>two theatres,</HI> till they have been stretched into the size of <HI>four?</HI> and has not this expence been repaid, first by laying an additional charge on the benefits of authors and actors—which were first sixty guineas, afterwards eighty, and now an hundred—and then ten fold by the receipts of first nights; which, as the <HI>theatre</HI> is sure to fill, must of course pay all the expence of a first performance, whether it succeed or not, which clearly proves the mana∣ger is safe, whatever may be the fate of the poor author. In fact, ten places of public entertainment might, in the metropolis, thrive, supported by <HI>real merit</HI> and <HI>proper variety</HI>; for that wonderful place has grown more rich and populous every day since the establishment of the present <HI>theatres.</HI> But were this to obtain, there would be an actual necessity for calling in the assistance of men of real abilities, who will not, after the treatment they have received, lend their help without being properly rewarded—and this would overthrow the whole of the present system; for it is evident the <HI>theatre</HI> can, as it is, yield money enough without the smallest aid of genius or ability at all.</P>
<P>There are but two things:—either let the management of <HI>theatres</HI> be considered as a traffic that every body has a right to derive a benefit from who chuses to adventure in it, or let it be understood as a grant to the proprietors of <HI>two houses</HI> in LONDON, and, if you will, one in every other city or opulent town in the kingdom, who are to be considered as the purveyors of the public, and obliged, under that idea, to provide the best entertainment that can be had. How will it operate? No single <HI>theatre</HI> in the kingdom, except those in LONDON,
<PB N="426" REF="458"/>
produces the smallest novelty—if, therefore, performances void of merit are permitted at the <HI>two theatres,</HI> they go through the whole nation, and are sure, the source being contaminated, to poison the general taste. Thus genius—for whose support and encouragement <HI>theatres</HI> were surely originally intended—may retire, unknown and neglected, to deplore the ingratitude of the most benevolent country upon earth.</P>
<P>Had I time to go over the ground of establishing theatres by purchaseable licences, I should not despair of proving that it would answer every desirable end to the managers, the public, and the legislature; but since at present, however, the subject does not seem likely to take this turn, I shall content myself with saying—as more cannot be meant by vesting partial powers in the hands of individuals than that such men should act in conformity with the wish, and properly provide for the <HI>pleasure</HI> of the public—this law, like any other, should be watched, and managers laid under a restriction not to reject works of acknowledged merit. For this purpose, a sort of board of controul might be instituted, who should have power to take cognizance of every omis∣sion of this kind, and let the authority of that body determine in what way pieces should be produced, so as to conduce to the mutual advantage of author and manager. If it be objected that the cure is worse than the evil, it self-evidently proves, that the measure is in itself wrong, and that the legislature, by giving an unlimitted power to managers, will check that genius it is their duty to encourage, and cherish that very licentiousness they are so solicitous to curb.</P>
<P>In a word, as the laws now are, a manager—either from want of prin∣ciple or ability—being absolute, may exercise what tyranny he shall think pro∣per; I therefore hope, for the sake of consistency, this power will be in some way restrained, if it were only for the <HI>propriety</HI> of not countenancing <HI>despotism</HI> in a LAND OF FREEDOM. Adieu.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING done with the theatres—to which sub∣ject I wish I could have allotted more room. I proceed to my task of looking further over those parts of the work which may need elucidation, and others that may with propriety be revived, in order to be heightened.</P>
<P>I have said that I should be able to point out many errors in Mr. PATER∣SON's Travelling Dictionary—which is certainly in many places incorrect. I have shewn how I calculated falsely, all the way from BURY to WORCES∣TER, owing to the faith I gave to that book. From HALIFAX to SHEFFIELD, which according to Mr. PATERSON is <HI>forty miles,</HI> is really no more than <HI>thirty-six</HI>; from SHEFFIELD to MANCHESTER, said to be <HI>forty</HI> miles, is <HI>forty-two</HI>; from MANCHESTER to LIVERPOOL, set down <HI>forty</HI> miles, is but <HI>thirty-six</HI>; from LEEDS to HALIFAX, said to be <HI>sixteen</HI> miles, is <HI>eighteen</HI>; from HALI∣FAX to MANCHESTER, set down <HI>thirty,</HI> is but <HI>twenty-eight</HI>—and indeed there are many other errors of the like kind.</P>
<P>I shall next take an opportunity of mentioning, which I look upon as common justice, that long after the letter was printed containing an explana∣tion
<PB N="428" REF="460"/>
of the business between Mr. DALY, the Irish manager, and myself, the note of ten pounds was paid. This however I had no notice of till I received a letter at LIVERPOOL, mentioning it, on the eighth of March last—making very nearly a twelvemonth from the time of the original transaction; but I do not yet repent of noticing it in the way I have, for the pieces, which are far more valuable, are not to this moment returned.</P>
<P>At the latter end of the <HI>twenty-first</HI> letter, I have mentioned leaving my kind friends at COLCHESTER, before I have actually been there—this arose from writing the twenty-second letter <HI>first.</HI> Or the reader may, if he please, believe that I purposely left myself this opportunity of recurring to a circumstance which will certainly ever furnish me with grateful reflections: the fact is how∣ever as I have set it down.</P>
<P>I have to speak of newspapers; and the first thing I shall say is, that it is astonishing to see how they multiply. I remember when <HI>The Daily Adver∣tiser, The Public Advertiser, The Gazetteer, The Ledger,</HI> and two evening papers, made up—except <HI>The Craftsman</HI> on a Saturday—the whole stock of public prints in LONDON, and <HI>one,</HI> or at most <HI>two</HI> papers <HI>in a county,</HI> contented the people in the country; and really, at that time, there was something like independent principles in the conduct of the public prints. <HI>The Morning Chronicle</HI> even outwent this, and for a few years was conducted—particularly as to theatrical strictures—upon the most disinterested and impartial plan that ever was characterized by candour and fearless truth; but, alas! what force of abilities and integrity can hold out against free tickets, countenance, atten∣tion, compliments, and, in fact, an anticipation of every little pleasurable wish and convenience! But TROY fell, and so did <HI>The Morning Chronicle</HI>—which, having first implicitly bowed to the mandate of managers, to finish the business, took a decided part in politics, and is now <HI>decidedly</HI>—NOWHERE. <HI>The Morning Post</HI> blazed on us at once—it attacked every thing, and seared nothing—consequently its popularity was very soon confirmed. This paper
<PB N="429" REF="461"/>
is memorable for teaching advertisers how to write; and what <HI>Puff</HI> says in the <HI>Critic,</HI> has certainly its origin from the superior style in which auctions were advertised in <HI>The Morning Post,</HI> which set every body mad for high-flown, paragraphical descriptions of trifles; for, as FOOTE has it, they had as much to say upon a <HI>ribband</HI> as a RAPHAEL. The dauntless attacks, however, were its staple commodity, its stamina, through which it presently grew vi∣gorous and rich. At this time, thinking, I suppose, that abuse alone was necessary to lift a public print into popularity, a set of levelling gentlemen brought out <HI>The General Advertiser,</HI> which to be sure did deal about sheer mud and filth in a most liberal—or rather illiberal—way, without regard to sex, age, or condition. Having, however, forgot that the satire in the <HI>Morn∣ing Post</HI> was written in the style of a <HI>gentleman,</HI> and, though very severe, gave evident marks of genius, and conveyed good strength of argument, they presently found themselves decried among all those who had ability to judge, or taste to distinguish. Yet, as in this country are to be found plenty of those who love to feast now and then on a neighbour's reputation, this worthy pa∣per, though full of nothing but the grossest and most ignorant scurrility—which accomplished quality it retains to this very day—became a great favou∣rite among the lower sort of people.</P>
<P>I shall go through a remainder of this subject in my next letter—being the last but two on which I shall trouble the public, or telling you, except pri∣vately, how much I am</P>

<Q>"<HI>How are we ruined!</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THUS did the newspapers, with all the calmness and goodnature imaginable, revile, abuse, and vilify each other, by mutual agreement, for a considerable time, without receiving the smallest interruption to their laudable endeavours.</P>
<P>At length, some of the underlings belonging to the <HI>Morning Post</HI>—headed by that renowned veteran, DOCTOR KENRICK—resolving to have a <HI>Morning Post</HI> of their own, without any previous intimation, came out all of a sudden with a new paper under that title. This scheme was as expeditiously stopt, as it was ridiculously put into practice. The malecontents however were continually fomenting disputes, till thinking themselves equal to the conduct of the paper without assistance from their principal, they proposed terms of separation, which were handsomely and honourably acceded to, and the establishment of <HI>The Morning Herald</HI> was the consequence; which is now, without doubt—except in that virulent and disgraceful party heat, which some have not spared to think is a convention with the <HI>Morning Post,</HI> to make both popular—is the most brilliant paper extant: indeed how should it be otherwise when, in addition to the keen and penetrating judgment and solid good sense
<PB N="431" REF="463"/>
of its fabricator, it is notorious that the flower of the opposition have at times made it the conveyance of their public sentiments.</P>
<P>After they had gone on in this manner for a time, gathering strength—like ANTEUS by being abased—<HI>The Universal Register,</HI> now called <HI>The Times,</HI> was produced, without a single recommendation, but being printed <HI>logographically</HI>; treading however in the steps, or rather edging itself into the situation of the <HI>Ledger</HI>—which paper began now to be on the decline—it cir∣culated pretty well.</P>
<P>Last of all came out <HI>The World</HI>—of which paper I shall not say an un∣kind word, if it be only for its sensible and steady attachment to that most noble and manly of all subjects—the virtues of THE PRINCE OF WALES. Certainly it was stimulated to this theme, by an act of public justice unparalelled in the annals of any country; for is there an instance upon recordworthy equal attention to this—where the heir of such a glorious crown, with a ripened wisdom and Spartan greatness of soul, <HI>at twenty,</HI> preferred to see his palace in ruins, rather than his tradesmen should go unpaid. There are no words ade∣quate to the praise of such an action. Admiration must tell it. It must be felt—nay it <HI>is,</HI> in that uniform, heart-felt transport with which men gaze on their idol, who gave them so early a proof that he is not more a <HI>munificent prince</HI>—than an HONEST MAN.</P>
<P>It would not be credited, were it not as evident as light, that these NINE papers are so pampered with success, that though advertisements—which are charged equally at the stamp-office—are now rated from five and sixpence to fourteen or fifteen shillings, they garble <HI>what</HI> they think proper, disappoint <HI>when</HI> they think proper, and advertise for <HI>whom</HI> they think proper. In short, the very end proposed in advertising is defeated by their shameful neglect, or scandalous perversion of what is committed to their care.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="464"/>This it seems has roused a number of opulent and respectable men, who having themselves sustained great inconvenience from such kind of conduct, are now, at an immense expence, and with a spirit hitherto unequalled, bring∣ing out a paper to be called <HI>The Star.</HI></P>
<P>This paper will be out before what I am now writing can be read, and this TOUR will finally go to press before this <HI>Novel Hesperus</HI> will have made its appearance, therefore I cannot, at any rate, give more than a blind judg∣ment on the business. It will however be fair to conclude, that the immense property the gentlemen engaged in this undertaking are able to muster—which is an ingredient by the bye never yet possessed by the establishers of a new public print—will certainly, if they go the right way to work, render their undertaking a very popular one. It has one novelty to recommend it, it will be published <HI>every evening</HI>; and if their source of intelligence be genuine, and within themselves, and they can in consequence anticipate the articles of the following day, it will really become a very valuable acquisition to the public. Some amendment most assuredly has long been wanted, and by the easiest as∣sent in the world they may rise to the summit of their wishes—for it consists of nothing more than to avoid the errors of the other daily prints, which are so glaring, that it is not only those who run may <HI>read,</HI> but those who run may <HI>correct.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not speak of <HI>evening papers,</HI> for they are a sort of moons to the others, and it would be only to <HI>reflect</HI> a <HI>reflection.</HI> In the whole, there are in LONDON—taking in the three Sunday papers—about twenty, under different titles—all which yield prodigious profit, indeed more individually, than when there were but <HI>four</HI>; which I think is a pretty conclusive proof that an increase of theatres would be proportionally productive.</P>
<P>In the country, where several fortunes have been made by newspapers alone, there are, I should suppose, <HI>ten</HI> for every <HI>one</HI> that was to be seen
<PB N="433" REF="465"/>
<HI>twenty-five years ago</HI>; and the short history of them, in general, is this: They are indefatigable to procure entertaining and useful intelligence, till they fill with advertisements, and then a pair of scissars become the editor, which are indiscriminately brandished by <HI>compositors</HI> and <HI>devils,</HI> to the great annoy∣ance of <HI>Lloyd's Evening Post,</HI> and the unmerciful mutilation of the <HI>St. James's Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P>Some exceptions however there are to this rule, and the strongest I know, by infinite degrees, is <HI>The Sheffield Register.</HI> I do not know how soon my friend GALES may make a fortune, which ultimately must inevitably happen, if unwearied industry, fair dealing, the world's regard, and a well stocked head, as well as shop, are the materials to procure it; but, let it happen when it will, I shall change my good opinion of him—which is at present pretty strongly rooted—if he so far forget his patrons, the public, as to neglect them in return for their favours. I think however he will not; and so much do I approve his paper, that I have made choice of it to announce what will pub∣licly be known of me in future; and I here, conformably to such resolution, give notice, that nothing relative to me is to be considered as authentic, but what shall appear in or through the medium of <HI>The Sheffield Register.</HI></P>
<P>There may be other matters which are yet untouched; if so, in that state they must remain, leaving it to the goodnature of my readers to overlook what in my haste I may have omitted—while I make use of the little time I have to draw up a general correction of errors in minuter matters.</P>
<P>Adieu. My next letter, though necessary, will be tedious; I shall en∣deavour therefore—in the way of a story or a song on a tiresome journey—to enliven it with a few remarks: not forgetting however first to remark, that I am as usual,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CVI. <HI>A GENERAL ERRATA.</HI></HEAD>

<Q><L>"<HI>All offences, my Lord, come from the heart:</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Never came any from mine.</HI>"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had a great mind not to write this letter; but there is something so easy in me, that I may be persuaded into any thing. What I am about to set down, is a candid exposition of all the errors this book contains—which, being given in a new way, I may perhaps from some be credited for having committed these faults on purpose to introduce <HI>novelty,</HI> even in my very ERRATA.</P>
<P>One reason for my wish to say nothing about it was, that the ingenuous part of my readers, when they meet with a typographical mistake, will have the goodness, and—what is better in the reading of a book—the <HI>good sense</HI> to be∣lieve that the best substitute for the improper word their invention could sup∣ply, was the very individual expression meant by the author.</P>
<P>A second reason was, that it would really be a pity to deprive the critical fry of a little nibbling—who live upon the errors of the press, as young trouts do upon May flies, till by and by the insects are all gone, when, searching for their prey with the usual avidity, they get <HI>hooked</HI> for their pains.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="467"/>I had many others; but the most substantial was, that my modesty would become the sacrifice in such a trial—for if I say any thing about it at all, common justice will oblige me to pronounce, that this book, though abound∣ing with <HI>errors,</HI> is the most PERFECT that ever was published.</P>
<P>Having so far dipped into this subject as to have been guilty of an appa∣rent solecism, my reputation demands that I should set the matter to rights; relying, therefore, on the candour of the public, I blush, and go on.</P>
<P>Nothing can controvert that assertion which affirms that comparison is the only criterion by which any thing ought to be judged; let it then be con∣sidered, that when this book was first begun I had not the smallest idea what form it would take; that I have been three thousand miles to search for the matter with which it is furnished; that it was utterly impracticable I should myself superintend more than the first sixty-four pages; that I have not had recourse to a document of any kind—not even my own letters, of which it was impossible to write or keep a copy; that during the whole time, till my last arrival in TOWN, I had on my mind the weight of performing a most laborious entertainment—perhaps four times a week; that I have been under the necessity of accepting a great number of invitations; that in the course of the time I have not written so few as five hundred private letters; let all this I say be put against the advantages which attend the productions of writers in general in their way to the world, and then try by what degree of comparison this work is more or less perfect than any other. 'Tis CLEAR—and <HI>every</HI> reader has given it in my favour, confessing, that instead of so small a number of errors, 'tis wonderful there are not twenty times as many. Every reader? Yes. My friends have <HI>proclaimed</HI> it; and my enemies cursed me, bit their lips, and <HI>owned</HI> it—<HI>in secret.</HI></P>
<P>I shall begin with those errors which are of the greatest magnitude—but these are not typographical. The language in many places is not sufficiently
<PB N="436" REF="468"/>
perspicuous, and frequently aiming at strength—for I hate any thing luke∣warm—I am afraid I have been now and then a little uncouth in my style.</P>
<P>The errors of the press are at least two-thirds of them chargeable to me. In the first place, I write—especially when imagination is hard at work—a most <HI>villainous hand</HI>; and as more than three-fourths of the copy has gone, letter after letter by the post, there was nothing for it but to print away—in doing which, Mr. GALES has proved himself possessed of no mean abilities at decyphering. But I'll go over the errors in the order they happened.</P>
<P>The first, p. 83, is a very curious one, for it describes LIVERPOOL to be <HI>east</HI> of LEEDS. Nine out of ten however upon reading it would have said this is an error of the press, it should be <HI>west.</HI> P. 106, l. 18, it will easily be credited, that I meant to say the dean and chapter of LICHFIELD were <HI>pro∣vidently</HI> repairing their cathedral—and not <HI>providentially.</HI> P. 145, l. 3, dele <HI>in</HI> before <HI>conduct</HI>—for it should read, the men who conduct those passage boats. P. 158, l. 2, read, on the stage—and not, on <HI>to</HI> the stage. P. 169, l. 15, read POLLARD—and not HOLLAND. Same page, last line but two, dele <HI>much</HI>—and read, on being a MAN as well as a MONARCH. This ought to be set right, for it is that trait of his character on which our most gracious sovereign prides himself. P. 232, l. 20. Here is a mistake occasioned, without a doubt, by some omission of mine. How I intended to express myself at that moment it is to∣tally out of my power at this distance of time to say, but the passage will read tolerably well, if the reader will entirely omit the words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"then to say that."</Q> After all, there is some whim in this kind of errata, for it looks—wholly with∣out intention however—like a satire on the amendments of motions in the <HI>house of commons.</HI> P. 236, l. 5, read of a more <HI>sane</HI> nature—and not <HI>sape.</HI> In the letter to Mr. HARRIS, to say I did not mean to say <HI>more privater</HI>—though it might have been in the style of some of his people, is unnecessary, therefore the reader will please to dele <HI>more,</HI> and let <HI>privater</HI> stand alone. P. 258, l. 2, place a <HI>comma</HI> after <HI>arguments,</HI> and put a <HI>period</HI> to <HI>theatre,</HI> l. 4. Read <HI>level,</HI>
<PB N="437" REF="469"/>
instead of <HI>head,</HI> l. 10, same page. P. 260, l. 20, for <HI>when</HI>—read <HI>where.</HI> P. 266, l. 2, read accommodating the melody <HI>to</HI> the capacity of the trumpets—<HI>Jack in the wood</HI>—read <HI>Jack in thy mood.</HI> Every body knows it, 'tis a speech of MERCUTIO. P. 352, l. 3, for <HI>sconce,</HI> read <HI>nonce.</HI> P. 380, l. 19, read <HI>der tiple,</HI> instead of <HI>der traple.</HI> P. 383, in the motto of a few of the copies, <HI>The vizor speaks the art,</HI> instead of <HI>heart.</HI> P. 391, last line but one—<HI>expose,</HI> not <HI>explore</HI> false charms. P. 395, l. 18, after the word <HI>dangers,</HI> add <HI>scars.</HI> P. 280, l. 9 instead of <HI>recommendation to passengers,</HI> read <HI>accommodation to passengers.</HI> In the note, P. 287, instead of <HI>prevailed,</HI> read <HI>having prevailed.</HI> P. 291. In the account of GARRICK's manoeuvres relative to the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> it should be, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he raised a prodigious number of volunteers, whose exertions he pretty libe∣rally <HI>exacted</HI>"</Q>—not <HI>extracted.</HI> In the song from <HI>Poor Vulcan,</HI> read <HI>quinze</HI>—not <HI>quince.</HI> P. 74, last line but one, instead of <HI>wish safe,</HI> read <HI>wish me safe.</HI> P. 409, last line but one, instead of <HI>only,</HI> read, <HI>not only.</HI> P. 412, read <HI>auto de fe,</HI> not <HI>aute de fe.</HI> P. 420, l. 2, instead of, <HI>if they, literati,</HI> read, <HI>if the literati.</HI></P>
<P>There are other errors of less note, such as <HI>sensecutive,</HI> instead of <HI>consecu∣tive—invetend,</HI> instead of <HI>invented—diving,</HI> instead of <HI>driving</HI>—a <HI>the</HI> to be taken out before <HI>theatre—subtel,</HI> instead of <HI>subtle—whetever,</HI> instead of <HI>where∣ever—seviture,</HI> instead of <HI>serviteur—pbojector,</HI> for <HI>projector</HI>—ABURNOT, in∣stead ARBUTHNOT, and perhaps a few others.</P>
<P>The pointing also has in some places altered the sense, and perhaps a turned letter or two will now and then be met with; in return however for all these imperfections, the work is beautifully printed; the letter is new and clean; the lines are leaded, that they may be read without confusion; and the press∣work—which is no trifle in a large publication—carefully and nearly executed. Indeed, so much solicitude has Mr. GALES shewn in the getting out this work, and real judgment and understanding in being able to conduct it under such circumstances, that he has, as usual, anticipated my praise, by letting his la∣bour
<PB N="438" REF="470"/>
speak his panegyric. I do not know what degree of influence my recom∣mendation of him may have; but if his mode of treating others be equally obliging—and there is no reason to doubt it, for I am sure my pretensions to a preference are slight indeed—he will <HI>recommend</HI> HIMSELF, which, it must be confessed, is a very enviable style of patronage.</P>
<P>Before I quit this <HI>comedy,</HI> or <HI>farce of errors,</HI> if you please, I must not omit to set one very material matter to rights; in doing which however it will ap∣pear, that we were obliged to manoeuvre now and then, and pretty ingeniously, to get out this TOUR through the medium of the general post.</P>
<P>When I went last from SHEFFIELD to LIVERPOOL, the matter then writ∣ten went no farther than Letter 44—which the reader will see is dated SHEF∣FIELD, March 4. As I well knew the hospitality I should find at LIVER∣POOL, on my return, and the variety of pleasures that would be kindly chalked out for me, I felt myself conscious that to keep pace with Mr. GALES would be no easy matter. We therefore agreed that as soon as Letter 44 should be finished, to go on upon Letter 75, which begins <HI>The Readings</HI>; as, instead of <HI>inventing,</HI> I should in that case have nothing to do but <HI>copy.</HI> Thus we calculated that there would be a vacancy of thirty letters—a number sufficient to contain all that it would be necessary to say on the TOUR itself, and the statement of pieces. We outreckoned ourselves however two ways. In the first place, in bringing up the matter to page 307, instead of 305 or 309, we found ourselves entangled with an odd quarter of a sheet, and were thus obliged to have duplicates of the <HI>pages</HI> 307 and 308, though the <HI>matter</HI> will be found different. This will all be clearly understood by noticing that Letter 44, is dated as above SHEFFIELD, March 4, Letter 75—which begins <HI>The Readings</HI>—is dated LIVERPOOL, March 6, Letter 98—which finishes <HI>The Readings</HI>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s dated LONDON, March 22, and Letter 45—which returns again to the main subject, is dated LONDON, March 25.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="471"/>The advantage of this manoeuvre, superadded to that which I have al∣ready mentioned, was <HI>supposed to be,</HI> that I should be able to superintend all that remainder of the work; the proposed end however was defeated—for I have not seen SHEFFIELD—except for about eighteen hours—since the fourth of March.</P>
<P>Another error necessary to be mentioned is this: letting the pages remain on the form after the matter was distributed, those two half sheets which are distinguished by the colating letters, 4 Q and 4 R, will be found to be the same pages, viz. 335, 336, 337, &amp; 338, though different matter. These parti∣culars are mentioned merely for the information of the public, you may re∣member I privately apprized you of them as we went on.</P>
<P>These are the hardnesses I thought it necessary to rub off; to which per∣haps it will not be unnecessary to add, that as there can be no doubt but that my absence will be immediately taken advantage of, and as it is not impossible, not only that much spurious trash may be given out for mine, but also that my real compositions may surreptitiously get into the world, I entreat the pub∣lic not to credit any declaration, either in print or otherwise, to this effect, not properly authenticated; and I also give notice, that I shall have left authority behind me to prosecute all those who shall either <HI>perform</HI> or <HI>publish</HI> any com∣position of mine, without my written permission.</P>
<P>This last declaration has put it in my power to finish this letter very plea∣surably, by mentioning Mr. PRESTON in the Strand. I desire he will accept my public thanks for the innumerable kindnesses I have received at his hands; and I sincerely hope that the music of <HI>Liberty Hall, Harvest Home,</HI> the <HI>songs</HI> in <HI>The Readings,</HI> and the variety of other things he has liberally purchased of me, may, by being productive to him, in some degree acquit me of so large a load of obligations. To advise all persons who may have dealings in his way to ap∣ply
<PB N="440" REF="472"/>
to him, is only asking them to consider their own interest. 'Tis upon that principle I am happy to find that it has been in my power to contribute some little towards the extension of his immense country correspondence; for I have never returned to any place where I have not been thanked for my re∣commendation. In short, if a large capital, a strong back, a well conducted home manufactory, the best materials, a reasonable price, strict fidelity, the most minute care and attention, and a remarkable dispatch and punctuality, are the true requisites of an opulent and respectable man of business, Mr. PRESTON certainly answers the description; to which he adds—and my own feelings strongly evince it—all the <HI>warmth, sincerity,</HI> and <HI>generosity</HI> of a <HI>faith∣ful</HI> and <HI>valuable</HI> FRIEND.</P>
<P>The heightening touches will come in the next letter, and finish this picture; after which it may be hung up—like of that of PRAXITILES—on <HI>the second day</HI>; when, I'll venture to say, if there be any beauties in truth, some of them will be here allowed—if it were only a repetition of those truths which have marked me as</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CVII. <HI>CONCLUSION.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"<HI>And now I am come to the end of my song.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Rev Mr. —</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Come now to that moment to which I have so long looked with panting anxiety. To GARRICK it was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an awful one;"</Q> for he had every enjoyment <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his <HI>little</HI> heart could wish."</Q> He was courted, encouraged, flattered, and caressed; his productions were shewn to all possible advantage; his very foibles were objects of imitation; <HI>and all this</HI>—HE LEFT. To me it is a welcome moment; for I have had but little enjoyment—except that chearfulness of heart which has so often galled my oppressors. I have been envied, discouraged, vilified, and traduced; obliged to sustain every possible humiliation—while my poor attempts have been ushered into the world under the most mortifying disadvantages; <HI>and from all this</HI>—I EMAN∣CIPATE.</P>
<P>It was with peculiar propriety that I put this resolution in practice by an appeal to the public. In the course of such a length of time I must of necessity have noticed many shameful impositions. To communicate such information as might go to the <HI>detection,</HI> if not the <HI>cure</HI> of these, I conceived it my duty—as a mite of gratitude in return for the innumerable instances of kindness I have received at the hands of my liberal benefactors; and I flatter myself this
<PB N="442" REF="474"/>
duty is discharged in that proper, candid way, that actuates the feelings of all who aim at the good will of the benevolent, and can smile with contemptuous disregard at the malignant and unworthy.</P>
<P>I have purposely reserved this place to thank one more friend, whose ex∣ertions in procuring subscribers for this work have been as flattering as bene∣ficial to me. I have already mentioned this gentleman; for it was owing to him I am honoured with that ROYAL NOTICE which so greatly distinguishes the—I hope—<HI>propitious hour</HI> that, if fortune smile, must lead me to indepen∣dance. His generosity however did not stop here; for through the medium of his application has been procured the name of almost every noble personage in my list—besides a large number of others. My only difficulty is how to thank him. He will not feel the consciousness of any merit in what he has done—for <HI>his</HI> gratification has been equal to <HI>mine</HI>—nevertheless he must not be offended if I assure him, with all this philanthropy he cannot be more pleased than I am, nor more <HI>disinterestedly</HI>; for, when he shall have taken still further pains—which I know he meditates—his <HI>kind wishes</HI> and <HI>unparalleled attention</HI> will be a welcomer pleasure than—<HI>the advantages arising from them.</HI></P>
<P>And now—having paid this tribute of gratitude—nothing further remains than, most seriously and solemnly to assure the public,</P>
<P>That in the prosecution of this work I have not had an unfair, an un∣worthy, nor an unhandsome wish to gratify; that if I have spoken in <HI>strong language,</HI> it well became the dictates of TRUTH; and so may I prosper—as that cheerful, fearless, manly monitor prompts me—while I declare, that in this moment of parting from every public connection, I have not an ungenerous, nor unkind wish to any human being in the whole round of existence.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="475"/>Thus, my dear friend, I commit myself to the world; and as to my particular good wishes to you, when you shall have summed up the finish of every letter, and seen what they all amount to, I desire it may be considered that I subscribe to the truth of the sum total, by assuring you <HI>now,</HI> that I am, as ever,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Most cordially yours, C. DIBDIN.</SIGNED>
