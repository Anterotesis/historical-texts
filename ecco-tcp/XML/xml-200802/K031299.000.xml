<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. MOSSOP.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>BESIDE his native Thames our poet long</L>
<L>Hath hung his silent harp, and hush'd his song.</L>
<L>Kind Commerce whisper'd. "See my blissful state,</L>
<L>"And to no smiles but mine resign thy fate.</L>
<L>"Beneath the pregnant branches rest awhile,</L>
<L>"Which by my culture spread this favour'd isle;</L>
<L>"On that fair tree the fruits of ev'ry coost,</L>
<L>"All, which the Ganges and the Volga boast,</L>
<L>"All, which the sun's luxuriant beam supplies,</L>
<L>"Or slowly ripens under frozen skies,</L>
<L>"In mix'd variety of growth arise.</L>
<L>"The copious leaves beneficence diffuse,</L>
<L>"Which on affliction drops restoring dews,</L>
<L>"And birds of hope among the loaded sprays</L>
<L>"Tune with enchantment their alluring lays</L>
<L>"To cheer despondence and th' inactive raise.</L>
<L>"Rest here, she cry'd, and smiling time again</L>
<L>"May string thy lyre, and I approve the strain."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length his muse from exile he recalls,</L>
<L>Urg'd by his patrons in Augusta's walls.</L>
<L>Those gen'rous traders, who alike sustain</L>
<L>Their nation's glory on th' obedient main,</L>
<L>And bounteous raise affliction's drooping train.</L>
<L>They, who benignant to his toils afford</L>
<L>Their shelt'ring favour, have his muse restor'd.</L>
<L>They in her future fame will justly share,</L>
<L>But her disgrace herself must singly bear;</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
Calm bours of learned leisure they have giv'n,</L>
<L>And could no more, for genius is from heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To open now her long-hid roll she tries,</L>
<L>When vary'd forms of pictur'd passions rise.</L>
<L>Revenge and pride their furies first unfold,</L>
<L>By artless virtue fatally controll'd.</L>
<L>Scenes wrought with gentler pencils then succeed,</L>
<L>Where love persuades a faithful wife to bleed;</L>
<L>Where, join'd to publick cares, domestic woe</L>
<L>Is seen from manly fortitude to flow.</L>
<L>But if her colours mock the candid eye</L>
<L>By spurious tincts, unmix'd with nature's dye,</L>
<L>Ye friendly hands, restrain your fruitless aid,</L>
<L>And with just censure let her labours fade.</L>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. HAVARD.</STAGE>
<L>NOW we have shewn the fatal fruits of strife,</L>
<L>A hero bleeding with a virtuous wife,</L>
<L>A field of war embru'd with nation's gore,</L>
<L>Which to the dust the hopes of Albion bore,</L>
<L>If weak description, and the languid flow</L>
<L>Of strains unequal to this theme of woe</L>
<L>Have fail'd to move the sympathyzing breast,</L>
<L>And no soft eyes their melting sense exprest;</L>
<L>Not all the wit, this after scene might share,</L>
<L>Can give success, where you refus'd a tear;</L>
<L>Much less, if haply still the poet's art</L>
<L>Hath stol'n persuasive to the feeling heart.</L>
<L>Will he with fancy's wanton hand efface</L>
<L>From gen'rous minds compassion's pleasing trace,</L>
<L>Nor from their thoughts, while pensive they pursue</L>
<L>This maze of sorrow, snatch the moral clue:</L>
<L>If yet to him those pow'rs of sacred song</L>
<L>To melt the heart and raise the mind belong.</L>
<L>Dar'd he to hope, this sketch of early youth</L>
<L>Might stand th'award of nature and of truth:</L>
<L>Encourag'd thus, hereafter might he soar</L>
<L>With double strength, and loftier scenes explore,</L>
<L>And following fortune through her various wiles,</L>
