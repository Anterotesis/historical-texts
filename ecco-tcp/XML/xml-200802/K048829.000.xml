<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act, which are generally characterized, either by their natural simplicity, or some single striking incident, and little or nothing more is designed.—It is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertain∣ment on the English theatre, as containing excel∣lent situations for light airs.—On the French stage, notwithstanding all their merit, they tire in the length of time taken for representation; and, were they spun out to the common length of our after-pieces, it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient.</P>
<P>The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved, and the dialogue both varied and compressed, they are, with every deference, sub∣mitted to public judgment.</P>

<L>Love, and Annette, thy toil will repay.</L>
<P>If the housen of your great folks in town are larger, and a got more chambers than ours, I can tell 'em those within lead sadder lives—Here Annette and I are happier than a king and queen—one branch the more, if we are cold, keeps out the wind and the rain—If we are warm, one branch the less lets in the air to fan us—and, when the sun scorches up the leaves, away trudge I, as I did this morning, to the wood, and bring home a new house upon my back—Annette will be struck all of a heap when she comes home, to see how gay we look <STAGE>(singing behind)</STAGE> Ah, there she is! I'll work away without seeming to mind her.</P>

<P>For my part, I wonder they don't come, in the fine weather, and live, two and two, in a little hut, as we do—Have you seen, Lubin, their carpets they are so fond of?—Lord, they en't a quarter so pretty as a bed of daisies!</P>

<P>And, Annette, hast thee observed how they try to make their walls look like the country, by sticking a parcel of pictures about them?—They say, too, it costs them a mint of money; if that's the case, I am sure they are great fools, for our pictures here are ten times handsomer; and we have them for nothing.</P>

<L>As I was saying, we grew up</L>
<L>For all the world, sister and brother;</L>
<L>One never had nor bit nor sup,</L>
<L>Unless it was partook by t'other;</L>

<L>And, I am sure, instead of me,</L>
<L>Were it a Dutchess, he had won her;</L>
<L>He is so good! and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, d'ye see,</L>

<L>But, woe is ours, now comes the worst;</L>
<L>To-day our sorrows are beginning;</L>
<L>What I thought love—oh, I shall burst!</L>
<L>That nasty Bailly says was sinning:</L>

<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
<L>With Lubin, who, of all the bliss</L>
<L>I ever tasted, is the donor,</L>
<L>I took delight to toy and kiss;—</L>
<L>'Till I'm with child, and like your honour.</L>
</LG>
<P>And so, my Lord, you see what has happened; and if I have done any harm, I shall die with shame.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't let Annette die, my Lord—I should die too, and that would be a pity.—If you could but have seen how we lived together before this Old Bailly came and frighten'd us so, Nothing was ever so gay—All that vexes us is, he says my child won't know its father nor mo∣ther, and that it will reproach us with its birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>An.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twill reproach me in my grave then.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>The <HI>Lord.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They really interest me—Don't afflict yourselves, you are not criminal, you are only unfortunate: if you were rich, you might obtain a permission to love and be united: 'tis not just that, because you are poor, you should be de∣nied so equitable a desire.—I'll take this matter upon myself, and the week shall not pass before I procure a dispensation from the church, to re∣ward your innocence and affection as it deserves.</P>

<L>His Lordship really is too good!</L>
<L>What will the people say!</L>
<L>Marry two folks one flesh and blood!—</L>
<L>Henceforth young maids will stray.</L>

<L>The wolf will creep</L>

<SPEAKER>Annette.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Peace, mister Bailey—for my Lord</L>
<L>Has now untied my tongue;</L>
<L>And I may bold put in my word—</L>
<L>I own we've been so wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our former shame</L>
<L>Each fair should blame,</L>
<L>And yet, without regret,</L>
<L>Might imitate</L>
<L>The future state</L>
<L>Of Lubin and Annette▪</L>

<L>Wounds let un talk, and talk again!</L>
<L>He'll never get his ends;</L>
<L>His spite will give me little pain</L>
<L>If here we find but friends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive's the word!</L>
<L>You see my lord</L>
<L>Has the example set;</L>
<L>Do'e then, pray,</L>
<L>Clap hands, and say,</L>
<L>Smile Lubin and Annette!</L>
