<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a situation am I in!—Is this figure really and truly <HI>Emmeline</HI> — the beloved and only daughter of great <HI>Northumberland?</HI> Every thing about me is so like a dream, that I am frighted to think I am awake.—O how weary I am of this dress! If I had known half that I should have suffered in it, all the fairies in the world should not have persuaded me to put it on.—If I resided here in this dis∣guise the month of the king's hunting, I was to break the spell I was born under, and my life was to be happy—so the fairy told me!—Yet the time ex∣pires to-morrow, and nothing has happened to me but vexation and disappointment. I must once more see this powerful yet decrepit being, who, though in∣visible, is always within my call —This ring, which she gave me, convenes her: if I take it off and touch it thrice, she appears—Once—twice—thrice!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Elfina <HI>comes forward, and touches her.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fairy! my situation is such as I can bear no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience; for it ends to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-morrow!—to-morrow is a thousand years—When the horse has all he can bear, a feather will break his back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matter! why, in the first place, I have lived almost a month in a court—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>That your sorrow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That my sorrow! yes—I that have always lived in my father's principality, fair <HI>Northumberland,</HI> where a noble simplicity of manners shewed the heart to be open and undersigning; have, by your persuasion and assistance, left it for a place, where hypocrisy is avowed by the name of good breeding; where the most shameful licentiousness is justified as gallantry; dissi∣mulation and perfidy, as address and good manage∣ment; where self-interest is professed as the first prin∣ciple of wisdom, and virtue and public spirit derided as extravagance and superstition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your dress was your defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! it is my dress that exposes me to more than half that I suffer. When one of my own sex is in company, I am comparatively happy; but how unfit for a woman's ear is the conversation of men, when it is not restrained by knowing that a woman is present! I begin to fear that I should hot have thought so well even of those men I have been used to con∣verse with, if they had appeared to me as they appear to each other.—The friendship and confidence of these lords of the creation, have almost robbed me, a weak woman, of my allegiance:—I am frighted at the thought of living among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not vices you detest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not! but what must I hope? O fairy! if I have implicitly followed your instructions, if I have hidden them in my breast from every friend,
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
and even from good <HI>Northumberland</HI> my father, let me no longer suffer the anguish of suspense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Persevere; believe; confide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have yet found no object worthy of my love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<L>You must find, and know it not.</L>
<L>Such the Fates ordain'd thy lot!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the mystery of my fate—that the happiness of my life depends upon my seeing and making a friend of the most beautiful and accomplish'd of men, without one thought of love—Alas!—for∣give my doubts, my fears—should you——</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! of foul mistrust beware——To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mor∣row!—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft—unhallowed feet are nigh!—<HI>Florimond</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! that wretch haunts me like my shadow. To rally me for what he calls my virtue, seems to be his supreme delight; he is proud of his own insensi∣bility to what gives me pain: the confusion he throws me into, he considers as a test of his own abilities and accomplishments; and as vanity is his predominant passion, he is so assiduous to secure the enjoyment of his superiority, that I can scarce escape him one hour in a day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elf.</SPEAKER>
<L>He shall work thee woe and weal,</L>
<L>As to-morrow shall reveal.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But how? where?—dear, dear fairy!—</P>
</SP>

<P>Ha! my little <HI>Gondibertus!</HI> have I found you?—What all alone <STAGE>peeping about</STAGE>? Egad I was in hopes there had been a wench in the case, and that I might have given thee joy of thy reformation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I chose to be alone. Solitude is some∣times not only useful, but pleasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why 'tis a fine moon-light evening indeed—</L>
<L>But what the devil—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have sufficient subject for meditation, Sir; and I hoped that, as there is a ball at the castle to∣night, you would have been better engag'd than to watch my privacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! better engag'd than to raise such a re∣cruit for the beau monde, as thou art?—Come, come, thou shalt not thus steal away from good company to thyself.</P>

<P>No faith, not very uncommon neither; tho' perhaps thou may'st make a wonder of it.—'Tis only an heiress that's just run away with a young fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, is not so uncommon as might be wish'd. But who is she? is she of any fashion?</P>

<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> What shall I say? my confusion will certainly betray me—'Twas only a sudden pain shot cross my bread—But what particulars do you hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it seems she got leave of her father to follow him hither; and it is just accidentally discovered, that she left his castle the next day, though she has not been here yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but why do you therefore conclude, that she's gone off with a man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why only because the duke of <HI>Kent</HI>'s son, <HI>Edgar,</HI> disappeared upon the same pretence, just at the same time; and both have been missing ever since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this sufficient to authorize a positive assertion to the prejudice of a reputation, which hi∣therto not slander itself has presum'd to stain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Not slander itself has presum'd to stain! Ha, ha, ha. <STAGE>Mimicking her.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> O my heart! what new insult am I doom'd to suffer?—You'll excuse me, Sir, if, upon this occasion, I take the liberty to tell you, that your mirth is rather ill-timed; and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—do you know this fair lady, that you are so much disposed to become her knight-errant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> I must be cautious, or my zeal may discover me. Sir, though I should not know her, it is my point of honour, never to suffer the reputation of the absent to be wantonly sported away, upon mere circumstances and surmise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your point of honour!—why to be sure all this is very fine. But I'll tell you a secret, my dear— As unstain'd as you may think the fair <HI>Emmeline</HI>'s reputation, there is a certain humble servant of yours, that shall be nameless, who has some <HI>small</HI> reason to think, that a certain piece of brittle ware, which she had the keeping of, may be a little crack'd—or so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>aside</HI>A wretch! who never saw me but in this disguise—You are well acquainted with her then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—I am—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, what kind of woman is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she's a pretty—upon my word, a very pretty wench.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is she tall, or short, or brown, or fair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have never seen her, you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more than I do this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Aside.</STAGE> Then I may venture—Why she is fair, tall, and slender; has a fine neck, a very fine neck! her limbs remarkably well turn'd, her leg and ancle the finest I ever saw—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>distress'd and confounded.</STAGE> Oh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye—I thought I should set you a longing: but come, she's not to be had at present it seems; so no more of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot so easily dismiss her as you may imagine; and yet, perhaps, you may mistake the reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely, faith; but what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I am astonish'd, that you make so light of what has happen'd to her; whether you consider it as the loss of a mistress, or whether as a misfortune to a woman you must be suppos'd to have lov'd, and to whom you must have had obligations of the strongest and most tender kind: one of these lights you must see it in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear, as to that, I am extreamly easy about losing her; for between you and I—I cou'd spare her. I must, indeed, confess, that I was very fond of her once; but 'faith, the obligations were all on her side—It's among ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside</STAGE> O, my heart! what a monstrous com∣pound of vanity and lies is this!—How so, pray sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I us'd to meet her in her father's park night after night, at the risk of my life; and egad, what with the danger, and what with the fatigue, I grew tir'd of her; and, to tell you the truth, pro∣vided her another lover, to make good my retreat. It's among ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said—and who was that, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same <HI>Edgar</HI> that she is now run away with. I thought it would be a pretty thing for him; for he is one of your fighting fellows, that is never so happy as when he's in danger—but I'm sorry he has been so indiscreet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir—excuse me—I don't pretend to question the truth of what you say; but there are some difficulties in the story, that I should be glad to have clear'd up—If you was so much in the lady <HI>Emmeline</HI>'s good graces, and had, as you say, no dislike to her person, how came you not to think of marrying her? Such an alliance, I presume, would not have dishonoured you.—I shall confound him now. <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marrying her! Egad, she knew a trick worth two o'that. I would have married her; and I told her so: "My dear <HI>Florimond,"</HI> says she,—her arm was then lying negligently cross my shoulder, thus,— and she look'd archly at me, thus,—<Q>My dear <HI>Flo∣rimond,</HI> says she, why should you and I, that have now only the power of making each other happy, suffer a doating old priest to give us the power of making each other miserable? If you were to be my husband, you might cease to be my lover; and then,</Q> says she, with a most roguish leer, <Q>perhaps I might be tempted to take another: you would tyrannize, I should rebel; you wou'd enjoy nothing but the hope of breaking my heart, and I should enjoy nothing but the hope of break∣ing yours.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Still, still, I draw upon myself more confusion.—But why then did she run away with <HI>Ed∣gar?</HI> That must ruin her schemes, both of interest and pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, how the devil can I tell that?</P>

<P>Was ever man in such ridiculous distress! I'm sure I ne'er knew any thing like it, since I was <HI>Edgar</HI> the son of <HI>Kent.</HI> Here have I had a young tempting girl fiddle-faddling about me these two hours to dress me, forsooth—with an officious handiness so provoking, that no virtue under that of a stockfish could endure it patiently. Yet an old woman upon these occasions I cannot bear: and, in short, I can no
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
longer bear a young one—It is my fate, they say, to be miserable, if I don't get acquainted with the finest girl in <HI>England,</HI> without wishing for her; and I was told by a little goblin that started up before me, after it had led me, under the appearance of a Jack o' Lantern, into a wood, That if I could spend the king's hunting month here in this disguise, all would be right: but how my being in petticoats should make me less likely to love a fine girl, I cannot conceive! A fine girl, indeed, may be less likely to love me; but as to myself, it is high time for me to get into breeches, that I may get out of temptation. Here they flock about me—one sits down just before me, and, without any ceremony, ties her garter—another gets me to adjust her tucker.—I'm the witness of so many pranks, and the confidant of so many secrets! Then I have my hours of mortification too: I am tormented by a swarm of profligate fops, who try to debauch every woman they see, with as little concern as they take snuff: wretches, who are as destitute of love, as they are of virtue; and have as little enjoy∣ment, as they have understanding! And here I'm ob∣liged to mince, and pish, and fye,—and affect to blush,—'sdeath, when I'm bursting with indignation, and long to knock 'em down—I'll bear it no longer.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My connection with <HI>Edgar,</HI> sir, is indeed, in some sense, the reason why your merit cannot make an impression, which I am not ashamed to say it might otherwise have done: and yet, sir, let me confess that I am not affected by the story of his disappearing with <HI>Emmeline,</HI> as you might reasonably imagine, be∣cause I know for <HI>certain</HI> that it <HI>cannot</HI> be true.</P>

<P>O! still you wander, wide and wider still— I cannot speak—</P>

<P>Madam, it is impossible—nothing but his life can atone for the insult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will excuse a woman, though a stranger, sir, upon such an occasion: may I intreat to know, sir, who has had the misfortune to incur the resent∣ment of a gentleman, who seems so little to deserve ill treatment, and so able to punish it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you do me honour—She is making advances already <STAGE>aside.</STAGE>—Why, madam, as the treat∣ment I have received makes it an act of justice to tell, what I should otherwise rather die than discover, I will comply with your request—Hem! A little dirty dependant upon the court here, madam, one <HI>Gondi∣bert,</HI> thought fit to send me a challenge, upon account of something I happened to say concerning a lady, in whole good graces I happen'd to be, and whom a foolish young fellow that I was a friend to has thought fit to run away with; and, madam, though I have so far treated him like a gentleman, as to accept his challenge, he has not come to the place appointed, and it is now half an hour past the time.</P>

<P><STAGE>starting and looking out as afraid</STAGE> Ah! egad that's certainly he— <STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Now if he should not be a coward at last—Madam a, a, a, for God's sake retire —for—a, a, a.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I believe it will not be necessary; for I'm pretty sure now, that the gentleman is a friend of mine—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>A friend of yours, madam! pray who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman, sir, who, I am sure, will be extreamly glad to be better known to you.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> EDGAR <HI>in his proper dress.</HI></STAGE>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> How soft, how lovely in her female dress!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>to Florimond.</STAGE> Sir, as we are now no longer alone, I may confess, that I am not altogether a stranger to your person or your merit. <STAGE>To Edgar.</STAGE> Sir, this is <STAGE>Florimond,</STAGE> a gentleman to whom both you and I have some obligations, which I believe he is not at present aware of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, madam, you absolutely con∣found me—this excessive honour—is it possible that I should have been so happy, as to confer obligations— pray, madam, may I crave the honour of your name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not at all recollect that lady, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my soul, sir, I cannot say that I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, now, do you think it can possibly be, of all that your polite generosity has oblig'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me perish, sir, if I can tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sir, that lady is one <HI>Emmeline</HI>; with whom, as she tells me, you was formerly most inti∣mately acquainted; and whom you lately conversed with, sir, in disguise, by the name on <HI>Gondibert:</HI> it's among ourselves.—What! quite confounded, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>recovering himself</STAGE> Ha! ha! ha! confound∣ed! Ha! ha! ha! No, no, sir: you have had your jest, and I have had mine. I knew well enough who I was talking to, when I play'd upon the little <HI>Gon∣dibertus</HI>—Ah! I thought I should make you smart for your frolic—I told <HI>Elfrida</HI> my whole scheme—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told <HI>Elfrida</HI> your whole scheme—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, sir, as you did not know my per∣son in my own dress, how came you to know me in disguise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, to confess the truth, I was let into the secret by a friend. <STAGE>aside</STAGE> Egad, this goes swimmingly.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir; but pray give me leave to bring you acquainted with a person, who, I'm sure, you are at present totally a stranger to—Pray, who do you think I am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside</STAGE> Heaven knows! but I wish I was fairly out of your clutches—Upon my soul, sir, I have not the honour to know you, any otherwise than as a gentleman, whom I should be extremely proud to consider as my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sir, I have the honour to be one <HI>Ed∣gar</HI>; a very shallow fellow, sir, that you had some kindness for, because he was aukwardly good-natured: I have also had the honour to receive several of your civilities, under the name of <HI>Elfrida</HI>—It's among ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your most humble servant—I have at this time some urgent business—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So have I, sir; and therefore you must not leave me yet—You may remember, sir, that you told me your whole scheme to punish <HI>Emmeline</HI> for her frolick, and to mortify her with stories of herself by way of joke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I beseech you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am extremely sorry for the occasion; but as this lady has not got her fighting cloaths on,
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
you must excuse me if I take her challenge upon my∣self; and so sir— <STAGE>draws</STAGE>—it's among ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has my thoughtless indiscretion done!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, dear sir, now you are too serious—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>This must not be—For heav'ns sake, <HI>Edgar,</HI> hear me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not, my love—Sir, whatever you may think, this is but sport to what is to follow—and so, sir, without more words—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord, sir!—I beseech you, madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my sake, <HI>Edgar</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trust me—Draw, sir, or—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I don't desire to do you any harm; I don't, upon my soul, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Scoundrel, coward, draw!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, <HI>Edgar</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, do, dear sir, consider—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am but a poor, miserable, lying cox∣comb, sir—Indeed, sir, I am—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better to dismiss him, <HI>Edgar,</HI> as be∣neath your resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, indeed, sir—a great deal better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emm.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is worthy only of contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true indeed, sir,</P>

<P>Art thou not a wretch, without the least principle of truth or honour?</P>

<P>Yes, sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Flor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Edgar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not thy very follies the malignity of vices; and is it not a disgrace to nature, to consider thee as a man?</P>

<P>Any thing, dear sir, if you will but spare my life.—If you chuse any other satisfaction, sir; if you would be content to kick me into some dark corner,

and leave me, I should think myself under infinite ob∣ligations to you.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OLD times, old fashions, and the Fairies gone;</L>
<L>Let us return, good folks, to sixty-one—</L>
<L>To this blest time, ye Fair, of female glory,</L>
<L>When pleasures unforbidden lie before ye!</L>
<L>No <HI>Sprites</HI> to fright you now, no guardian <HI>Elves;</HI></L>
<L>Your wise directors are—your own dear selves—</L>
<L>And every Fair One feels, from old to young,</L>
<L>While these your guides—you never can do wrong.</L>
<L>Weak were the sex of yore—their pleasures few—</L>
<L>How much more wife, more spirited are <HI>You?</HI></L>
<L>Would any Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> or Lady <HI>Mary,</HI></L>
<L>Ere they did <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that,</HI> consult a <HI>Fairy?</HI></L>
<L>Would they permit this saucy pigmy crew,</L>
<L>For each small slip, to pinch 'em black and blue?</L>
<L>Well may you shudder—for, with all your charms,</L>
<L>Were this the case—good heaven, what necks and arms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus did they serve our grandames heretofore—</L>
<L>The very thought must make us moderns sore!</L>
<L>Did their pour hearts for cards or dancing beat,</L>
<L>These <HI>Elves</HI> rais'd blisters on their hands and feet:</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Loo</HI> the game, and fiddles play'd most sweetly—</L>
<L>They could not squeeze dear <HI>Pam,</HI> nor foot <HI>Moll Peatly.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="44"/>Were wives with husbands but a little wilful,</L>
<L>Were they at that same <HI>Loo</HI> a little <HI>skilful;</HI></L>
<L>Did they with pretty fellows laugh or sport—</L>
<L>Wear ruffs too small, or petticoats too short:</L>
<L>Did they, no matter how, disturb their cloaths;</L>
<L>Or, ever-lilied, add a little rose!—</L>
<L>These spiteful Fairies rattled round their beds,</L>
<L>And put strange frightful nonsense in their heads!</L>
<L>Nay, while the husband snor'd and prudish aunt,</L>
<L>Had the fond wife but met the dear gallant—</L>
<L>Tho' lock'd the door, and all as still as night—</L>
<L>Pop thro' the key-hole whips the Fairy Sprite,</L>
<L>Trips round the room—"My husband!" madam cries—</L>
<L>"The devil! where!" the frighted beau replies—</L>
<L>Jumps thro' the window—she calls out in vain—</L>
<L>He, cur'd of love—and cool'd with drenching rain,</L>
<L>Swears—"Dem him if he'll e'er intrigue again!"</L>
<L>These were their tricks of old—But all allow,</L>
<L>No childish fears disturb our Fair Ones now.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ladies, for all this trifling, 'twould be best</L>
<L>To keep a little <HI>Fairy</HI> in your breast:</L>
<L>Not one that should with moderate passions war;</L>
<L>But just to tweak you—when you go too far.</L>
