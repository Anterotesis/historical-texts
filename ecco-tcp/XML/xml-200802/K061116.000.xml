<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT I am indebted to Mr. <HI>Ramsay</HI>'s GENTLE SHEPHERD, (<HI>a</HI> Scotch <HI>Pa∣storal Comedy,</HI> wrote Origi∣nally in <HI>Five Acts</HI>) for the greatest Part of the following Piece, was not owing to my Idleness, but a Doubt of my Abilities to produce any Thing entirely New of this kind, that might plead so much pretence to Fa∣vour: As Nature is the same in all Ages, and Climes, I thought, the Simplicity of Characters, Manners, Sentiments, and Passions, which has gain'd THAT POEM its Reputation, cou'd not prove unenter∣taining to an ENGLISH AUDIENCE; which
<PB REF="3"/>
induced me to turn it into a <HI>Ballad Opera:</HI> and as the Beauties of the Original have been thought many, I have scarce ventur'd to make any farther Alterations than were absolutely necessary, in bringing the Tale within the Compass of <HI>One Act,</HI> adding to the Number of the Songs, and changing it into the <HI>English</HI> Dialect, without which, it had not been intelligible to our Auditors; nor indeed had I time to vary it more, my <HI>Be∣nefit</HI> being fix'd before I had laid my De∣sign, which was plan'd and finish'd in <HI>one Day.</HI> When I mention my Benefit, I can∣not omit the Opportunity of returning my grateful humble Thanks, to All whose Favours I have been so frequently ho∣nour'd with, and hope I am not too vain, when I declare, it ever was, and will be, my utmost Ambition to deserve such Kindness, by my frequent Endeavours, whenever I may have Power, (and as far as my poor Capacity will allow) to add to the Variety of publick Diversions. The
<PB REF="4"/>
Warmth of my Heart might make me tedious, and impertinent, shou'd I pro∣ceed; I shall therefore only add, tho' the CHARACTERS in this OPERA are <HI>low,</HI> I flatter myself, they'll not appear distaste∣ful to the politest Circle of our ENGLISH BEAUTIES.</P>
