<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF SHELBURNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR friendship for Dr. <HI>Goldsmith</HI> is a sufficient inducement for me to in∣scribe his Beauties to you. In all ages, the illustrious and the learned have been courted, in the highest strain of panegyric, to take the offspring of Genius under their patronage. This I am prevented from doing here; for the writings from which this cento of excellence is taken, have long since found innumerable ad∣mirers in every polished society. My sole motive for addressing your Lordship,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
arises from your esteem for the Author, whose moral and sentimental writings have given birth to a volume every way meriting your Lordship's countenance.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, MY LORD, With the most perfect esteem, Your LORDSHIP's most obedient and most devoted humble servant, W. H.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is merely in compliance with custom I sit down to write a Preface. Dr. <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s writings need not an eulogium at this hour: they may be compared to the invaluable paint∣ings of <HI>Raphael</HI>; the longer they are in the world, their estimation becomes more exten∣sive. Time has drawn the veil of oblivion over the works of many writers, once renowned (if we may credit tradition) for every perfection that captivates. Nature was certainly wanting to enrich those compositions. What she has had a hand in, Time reverences, and a final dissolution can only destroy. How happy, then, must the hallowed spirit of <HI>Goldsmith</HI> be, whose Beauties wear the simple brilliancy of Nature, and all the decorative charms of Fancy! whose praise is the theme of the ingenious, from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London.</NOTE> Capital of Taste and Patronage, to the cot∣tage of learned tranquillity, and which Time will for ever regard with parental affection!</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5"/>The Pictures I have given from his Poems, are the highest finished in the group; and the whole selection will be found, it is hoped, meriting the attention and patronage of the refined lovers of elegant and estimable litera∣ture.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, <HI>M. B.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FAME, the only inflexible friend of Genius, has been singularly kind to the Author whose life I with much pleasure sit down to give some account of. She has sounded the praises of her favourite to the extremities of taste and literary refinement. The Court and the Cottage share with equal felicity the invaluable fruits of his elegant studies! The smallest memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and simplicity, or a balm for the wounded soul of the comfortless! Hence the lovers of human excellence have been sedulous in esta∣blishing our writer's reputation on the basis of immortality.</P>
<P><HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s biographers have been many; their opinions, in some measure, different; but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius, un∣bounded philanthropy, and possessing the milk of human kindness in a supereminent degree. I have
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
their several accounts before me; and, upon an impartial survey, Dr. <HI>Glover</HI>'s stands highest in my estimation. He was <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s intimate friend, a companion in many of his literary pursuits, and his enthusiastic admirer! What such a writer says, as far as relates to facts, must be listened to with more pleasure than a mere work of fiction, how∣ever elaborate, or splendidly set off. It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the obligations I lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion, for many particulars relative to Dr. <HI>Goldsmith.</HI> I shall give his account entire, marked with double com∣mas.</P>
<P><HI>"OLIVER GOLDSMITH</HI> was born at <HI>Ros∣common,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the year 1731. His father, who possessed a small estate in that county, had nine sons, of which <HI>Oliver</HI> was the third. He was originally intended for the church; and with that view, after being well instructed in the clas∣sics, was, with his brother the Rev. <HI>Henry Goldsmith,</HI> placed in <HI>Trinity</HI> college, <HI>Dublin,</HI> about the latter end of the year 1749. In this seminary of learn∣ing he continued a few years, when he took a Ba∣chelor's degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, <HI>Oliver,</HI> by the advice of Dean <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> of <HI>Cork,</HI> turned his thoughts to the profession of physic, and, after attending some courses of anatomy in <HI>Dublin,</HI> proceeded to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the year 1751, where he studied the several branches of medicine
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
under the different Professors in that university, which was deservedly ranked among the first schools of physic in <HI>Europe.</HI> His beneficent disposition soon involved him in unexpected difficulties, and he was obliged precipitately to leave <HI>Scotland,</HI> in consequence of engaging himself to pay a con∣siderable sum of money for a fellow-student.</P>
<P>"A few days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> near <HI>New∣castle,</HI> where he was arrested at the suit of one <HI>Barclay,</HI> a taylor in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to whom he had given security for his friend. By the good graces of <HI>Laughlin Maclane,</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Dr. <HI>Sleigh,</HI> who were then in the college, he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his pas∣sage on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> ship to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where, after a short stay, he proceeded to <HI>Brussels.</HI> He then visited great part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and, after pass∣ing some time at <HI>Strasbourg</HI> and <HI>Lovain,</HI> where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in Physic, he accom∣panied an <HI>English</HI> gentleman to <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>"It is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, unfortunate man, made most part of his tour on foot! He had left <HI>England</HI> with very little money; and, being of a philosophical turn, and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily terrified at danger, he became an enthusiast to the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries. He
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
had some knowledge of the <HI>French</HI> language, and of music; he played tolerably well on the <HI>German</HI> flute; which, from an amusement, became at some times the means of subsistence. His learn∣ing produced him an hospitable reception at most of the religious houses, and his music made him welcome to the peasants of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> 'Whenever I approached a peasant's house towards night-fall,' he used to say, 'I played one of my most merry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day: but in truth,' (his constant expression) 'I must own, whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my perform∣ance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them."</P>
<P>"On his arrival at <HI>Geneva,</HI> he was recom∣mended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle, Mr. <HI>S</HI>—. This youth, who was articled to an at∣torney, on receipt of his fortune, determined to see the world; and, on his engaging with his pre∣ceptor, made a proviso, that he should be permitted to govern himself; and our traveller soon found his pupil understood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his pre∣vailing passion.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="10"/>"During <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s continuance in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given some striking proofs at the college of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> It was from hence he sent the first sketch of his delightful epistle, called <HI>The Traveller,</HI> to his brother, the clergyman, in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> who, giving up fame and fortune, had re∣tired, with an amiable wife, to happiness and ob∣scurity, on an income of only 40l. a year.</P>
<P>"From <HI>Geneva,</HI> Mr. <HI>Goldsmith</HI> and his pupil visited the South of <HI>France,</HI> where the young man, upon some disagreement with his preceptor, paid him the small part of his salary which was due, and embarked at <HI>Marseilles</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> Our wan∣derer was left once more upon the world at large, and passed through a number of difficulties in tra∣versing the greatest part of <HI>France.</HI> At length, his curiosity being gratified, he bent his course towards <HI>England,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Dover,</HI> the begin∣ning of the winter, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>"His finances were so low on his return to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that he with difficulty got to this metropolis, his whole stock of cash amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire stranger in <HI>London,</HI> his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections, in consequence of his embarrassed situation! He applied to several apothecaries, in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman; but his broad <HI>Irish</HI> accent, and the uncouthness of his ap∣pearance,
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
occasioned him to meet with insult from most of the medicinal tribe. The next day, how∣ever, a chymist near <HI>Fish-street,</HI> struck with his forlorn condition, and the simplicity of his man∣ner, took him into his laboratory, where he con∣tinued till he discovered his old friend Dr. <HI>Sleigh</HI> was in <HI>London.</HI> This gentleman received him with the warmest affection, and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establishment could be pro∣cured for him. <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> unwilling to be a bur∣den to his friend, a short time after eagerly em∣braced an offer which was made him, to assist the late Rev. Dr. <HI>Milner,</HI> in instructing the young gen∣tlemen at the academy at <HI>Peckham</HI>; and acquitted himself greatly to the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time; but, having obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> Mr. <HI>Griffiths,</HI> the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, re∣solving to pursue the profession of writing, he re∣turned to <HI>London,</HI> as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest oeconomy, and took lodgings in <HI>Green-Arbour-court,</HI> in the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> where he wrote several ingenious pieces. The late Mr. <HI>Newbery,</HI> who at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and introduced him as one of the writers in the <HI>Public Ledger,</HI> in which his <HI>Citi∣zen of the World</HI> originally appeared, under the title of <HI>'Chinese Letters.'</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="12"/><HI>"Fortune</HI> now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected. The simplicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the me∣rit of his productions, made his company very ac∣ceptable to a number of respectable persons; and he emerged from his shabby apartments near the <HI>Old-Bailey</HI> to the politer air of the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he took handsome chambers, and lived in a gen∣teel style. The publication of his <HI>Traveller,</HI> his <HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>Letters on the History of England,</HI> was followed by the performance of his comedy of <HI>The Good-natured Man,</HI> at <HI>Covent-garden</HI> theatre, and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age.</P>
<P>"Our Doctor, as he was now universally called, had a constant levee of his distressed countrymen; whose wants, as far as he was able, he always re∣lieved; and he has been often known to leave him∣self even without a guinea, in order to supply the necessities of others!</P>
<P>"Another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <HI>Deserted Village,</HI> the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy; which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who observed it was a very great sum for so short a performance. 'In truth,' replied <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> 'I think so too; it is much more than the honest man can afford, or
<PB N="xii" REF="13"/>
the piece is worth; I have not been easy since I received it; therefore I will go back and return him his note;' which he absolutely did, and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the poem, which turned out very considerable.</P>
<P>"During the last rehearsal of his comedy, in∣titled, <HI>She Stoops to Conquer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> had no opinion would succeed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of <HI>Tony Lumpkin</HI>'s speeches, being apprehensive it might injure the play, the manager with great keenness replied, 'Psha, my dear Doctor, do not be fearful of <HI>squibs,</HI> when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a <HI>barrel of gunpowder!'</HI> The piece, how∣ever, contrary to Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s expectation, was received with uncommon applause by the audience; and <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s pride was so hurt by the severity of the above observation, that it entirely put an end to his friendship for the gentleman who made it.</P>
<P>"Notwithstanding the great success of his pieces, by some of which, it is asserted, upon good autho∣rity, he cleared 1800l. in one year, his circum∣stances were by no means in a prosperous situation! partly owing to the liberality of his disposition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had con∣tracted of gaming, the arts of which he knew very little of, and consequently became the prey of
<PB N="xiii" REF="14"/>
those who were unprincipled enough to take ad∣vantage of his ignorance.</P>
<P>"Just before his death, he had formed a design for executing an <HI>Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,</HI> the prospectus of which he actually print∣ed, and distributed among his acquaintance. In this work, several of his literary friends (particu∣larly Sir <HI>Joshua Reynolds,</HI> Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Beau∣clerc,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick)</HI> had engaged to furnish him with articles upon different subjects. He had entertained the most sanguine expectations from the success of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would un∣doubtedly receive; and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his exist∣ence.</P>
<P>"He had been for some years afflicted, at different times, with a violent strangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life; and which, united with the vexations he suffered upon other occasions, brought on a kind of habitual despondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being im∣properly treated, terminated in his dissolution on the 4th day of <HI>April,</HI> 1774, in the forty-third year of his age. His friends, who were very nu∣merous and respectable, had determined to bury him in <HI>Westminster-Abbey,</HI> where a tablet was to
<PB N="xiv" REF="15"/>
have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been supported by Lord <HI>Shelburne,</HI> Lord <HI>Louth,</HI> Sir <HI>Joshua Reynolds,</HI> the Hon. Mr. <HI>Beau∣clerc,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>; but, from some unaccountable circumstances, this de∣sign was dropped, and his remains were privately deposited in the <HI>Temple</HI> burial-ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As there is no vestige for strangers to distinguish the place of his interment, a number of his admirers have long wished for a subscription to be opened towards erecting a tomb, or head-stone, at his grave. The Publisher of this Volume, anxious for this tribute to Genius and Friendship, will receive subscriptions from any of Dr. <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s friends who may be inclined to patronise this undertaking.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"As to his character, it is strongly illustrated by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s line;
<Q>'In wit a man, simplicity a child.'</Q></P>
<P>"The learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by distresses which arose from the openness of his temper, and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion; but this impe∣tuosity was corrected upon a moment's reflection; and his servants have been known, upon these oc∣casions, purposely to throw themselves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved, was certain of being rewarded for it. His disap∣pointments at other times made him peevish and fullen, and he has often left a party of convivial
<PB N="xv" REF="16"/>
friends abruptly in the evening, in order to go home and brood over his misfortunes: a circum∣stance which contributed not a little to the increase of his malady.</P>
<P>"The universal esteem in which his poems are held, and the repeated pleasure they give in the perusal, is a striking test of their merit. He was a studious and correct observer of nature, happy in the selection of his images, in the choice of his subjects, and in the harmony of his versification; and, though his embarrassed situation prevented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions, his <HI>Hermit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>De∣serted Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the <HI>English</HI> language.</P>
<P>"The writer of these anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring, that, as different accounts have been given of this ingenious man, these are all founded upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the most friendly footing for a great number of years, and who never felt any sorrow more sensibly than that which was occasioned by his death."</P>
<P>Let it be turned to what theme it will, the opi∣nion of an elevated literary character will succeed best with the million. Let us hear what Dr. <HI>John∣son</HI> says of our author, in his Life of <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="17"/>"THE Life of Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI> is a task which I should very willingly decline, since it has been lately written by <HI>Goldsmith,</HI> a man of such variety of powers, and such felicity of performance, that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediousness, and general without confu∣sion; whose language was copious without exu∣berance, exact without constraint, and easy with∣out weakness.</P>
<P>"What such an author has told, who would tell again? I have made an abstract from his larger narrative; and shall have this gratification from my attempt, that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius."</P>
<P>The most interesting part of the account which Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> has given of our author, in his Life of <HI>Garrick,</HI> deserves the reader's attention The lat∣ter part of it exhibits to mankind, feelings of the first quality in nature.</P>
<P>EVERY thing of <HI>Goldsmith</HI> seems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter; no man took less pains, and yet produced so powerful an effect: the great beauty of his composition consists in a clear, copious, and expressive style.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18"/><HI>Goldsmith</HI> was so sincere a man, that he could not conceal what was uppermost in his mind: so far from desiring to appear in the eye of the world to the best advantage, he took more pains to be esteemed worse than he was, than others do to appear better than they are.</P>
<P>His disposition of mind was tender and compas∣sionate; no unhappy person ever sued to him for relief, without obtaining it, if he had any thing to give; and, rather than not relieve the distressed, he would borrow. The poor woman, with whom he had lodged, during his obscurity, several years in <HI>Green-Arbour Court,</HI> by his death lost an ex∣cellent friend; for the Doctor often supplied her with food from his table, and visited her frequently with the sole purpose to be kind to her. He had his dislike, as most men have, to particular peo∣ple, but unmixed with rancour. He, least of all mankind, approved <HI>Baretti</HI>'s conversation; he considered him as an insolent, over-bearing fo∣reigner; as <HI>Baretti,</HI> in his turn, thought him an unpolished man, and an absurd companion: but, when this unhappy <HI>Italian</HI> was charged with mur∣der, and afterwards sent by Sir <HI>John Fielding</HI> to <HI>Newgate, Goldsmith</HI> opened his purse, and would have given him every shilling it contained; he, at the same time, insisted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement."</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM <HI>THE TEARS OF GENIUS</HI>; Occasioned by the Death of Dr. <HI>Goldsmith. By</HI> J. S. PRATT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE village-bell tolls out the note of Death,</L>
<L>And, through the echoing air, the length'ning sound,</L>
<L>With dreadful pause, reverberating deep,</L>
<L>Spreads the sad tidings o'er fair <HI>Auburn</HI>'s vale.</L>
<L>There, to enjoy the scenes her bard had prais'd</L>
<L>In all the sweet simplicity of song,</L>
<L><HI>Genius,</HI> in pilgrim garb, sequester'd sat,</L>
<L>And herded jocund with the harmless swains:</L>
<L>But, when she heard the fate-foreboding knell,</L>
<L>With startled step, precipitate and swift,</L>
<L>And look pathetic, full of dire presage,</L>
<L>The church-way walk, beside the neighb'ring green,</L>
<L>Sorrowing she sought; and there, in black array,</L>
<L>Borne on the shoulders of the swains he lov'd,</L>
<L>She saw the boast of <HI>Auburn</HI> mov'd along.</L>
<L>Touch'd at the view, her pensive breast she struck,</L>
<L>And, to the cypress, which incumbent hangs,</L>
<L>With leaning slope, and branch irregular,</L>
<L>O'er the moss'd pillars of the sacred fane,</L>
<L>Th' briar-bound graves shad'wing with fun'ral gloom,</L>
<L>Forlorn she hied; and there the crouding woe</L>
<L>(Swell'd by the parent) press'd on bleeding thought,</L>
<L><PB N="xxi" REF="22"/>Big ran the drops from her maternal eye,</L>
<L>Fast broke the bosom-sorrow from her heart,</L>
<L>And pale <HI>Distress</HI> sat sickly on her cheek,</L>
<L>As thus her plaintive elegy began:—</L>
<L>'And, must my children all expire?</L>
<L>Shall none be left to strike the lyre?</L>
<L>Courts <HI>Death</HI> alone a learned prize?</L>
<L>Falls his shafts only on the wise?</L>
<L>Can no fit marks on earth be found,</L>
<L>From useless thousands swarming round?</L>
<L>What crouding cyphers cram the land!</L>
<L>What hosts of victims at command!</L>
<L>Yet shall th' ingenious drop alone!</L>
<L>Shall <HI>Science</HI> grace the tyrant's throne?</L>
<L>Thou murd'rer of the tuneful train!</L>
<L>I charge thee with my children slain!</L>
<L>Scarce has the Sun thrice urg'd his annual tour,</L>
<L>Since half my race have felt thy barbarous power:</L>
<L>Sore hast thou thinn'd each pleasing art,</L>
<L>And struck a Muse with every dart:</L>
<L>Bard, after Bard, obey'd thy slaughtering call,</L>
<L>'Till scarce a Poet lives to sing a brother's fall.</L>
<L>Then, let a widow'd mother pay</L>
<L>The tribute of a parting lay,</L>
<L>Tearful, inscribe the monumental strain,</L>

<LG>
<L>And, first, farewell to thee, my son,' she cried,</L>
<L>'Thou pride of <HI>Auburn</HI>'s dale—sweet bard, fare∣well!</L>
<L>Long, for thy sake, the peasants tears shall flow,</L>
<L>And many a virgin-bosom heave with woe;</L>
<L><PB N="xxii" REF="23"/>For thee shall Sorrow sadden all the scene,</L>
<L>And every pastime perish on the green;</L>
<L>The sturdy Farmer shall suspend his tale,</L>

<L>No more the ev'ning gambol shall delight,</L>

<L>But groupes of Villagers, each joy forgot,</L>
<L>Shall form a sad assembly round the cot.</L>
<L>Sweet Bard, farewell!—and farewell <HI>Auburn</HI>'s bliss,</L>
<L>The bashful lover, and the yielded kiss:</L>
<L>The evening warble <HI>Philomela</HI> made,</L>
<L>The echoing forest, and the whispering shade,</L>
<L>The winding brook, the bleat of brute content,</L>
<L>And the blithe voice that "whistled as it went."</L>
<L>These shall no longer charm the Plowman's care,</L>
<L>But sighs shall fill the pauses of despair.</L>

<L><HI>Goldsmith,</HI> adieu! the "book-learn'd Priest" for thee</L>
<L>Shall now, in vain, possess his festive glee;</L>
<L>The oft-heard jest in vain he shall reveal,</L>
<L>For now, alas! the jest he cannot feel:</L>
<L>But ruddy Damsels o'er thy tomb shall bend,</L>
<L>And, conscious, weep for their and Virtue's friend;</L>
<L>The Milkmaid shall reject the Shepherd's song,</L>
<L>And cease to carol as she toils along:</L>
<L>All <HI>Auburn</HI> shall bewail the fatal day,</L>
<L>When, from their fields, their pride was snatch'd away;</L>
<L><PB N="xxiii" REF="24"/>And even the Matron of the cressy lake,</L>
<L>In piteous plight, her palsied head shall shake,</L>
<L>While, all a-down the furrows of her face,</L>
<L>Slow shall the lingering tears each other trace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, oh my child, severer woes remain</L>
<L>To all the houseless and unshelter'd train:</L>
<L>Thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest,</L>
<L>And heap fresh anguish on the beggar's breast;</L>
<L>For dear wert thou to all the sons of pain,</L>
<L>To all that wander, sorrow, or complain;</L>
<L>Dear to the learned, to the simple dear,</L>
<L>For daily blessings mark'd thy virtuous year;</L>
<L>The rich receiv'd a moral from thy head,</L>
<L>And, from thy heart, the stranger found a bed:</L>
<L>Distress came always smiling from thy door,</L>
<L>For GOD had made thee agent to the poor;</L>
<L>Had form'd thy feelings on the noblest plan,</L>
<L>To grace at once the Poet and the Man.</L>

<HEAD>THE BEAUTIES OF GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>STORY OF MISS SYLVIA S—.</HEAD>
<P>MISS SYLVIA S— was descended from one of the best families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her sister's decease. She had early in life been introduced into the best com∣pany, and contracted a passion for elegance and expence. It is usual to make the heroine of a story very witty, and very beautiful; and such cir∣cumstances are so surely expected, that they are scarce attended to. But whatever the finest poet could conceive of wit, or the most celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections of this young lady. Her superiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had seen her. She was naturally gay, generous to a fault, good-natured to the highest degree, affable in conversation; and some of her letters, and other writings, as well in verse as prose, would have shone amongst those of the most celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been published.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="35"/>But these great qualifications were marked by another, which lessened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honour suffered by her im∣prudence; I only mean, she had no knowledge of the use of money; she relieved distress, by putting herself into the circumstances of the object whose wants she supplied.</P>
<P>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repeti∣tion of new flattery, had taught her to think she could never be forsaken, and never poor. Young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of success, from a number of lovers; and yet I have seldom seen a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an husband in any. Before the choice is fixed, she has either lost her reputation, or her good sense; and the loss of either is sufficient to consign her to perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>Among the number of this young lady's lovers, was the celebrated <HI>S</HI>—, who, at that time, went by the name of <HI>the good-natured man.</HI> This gen∣tleman, with talents that might have done honour to humanity, suffered himself to fall at length into the lowest state of debasement. He followed the dictates of every newest passion; his love, his pity, his generosity, and even his friendships, were all in excess: he was unable to make head against any of his sensations or desires; but they were in
<PB N="3" REF="36"/>
general worthy wishes and desires; for he was con∣stitutionally virtuous. This gentleman; who at last died in a gaol, was, at that time, this lady's envied favourite.</P>
<P>It is probable that he, thoughtless creature! had no other prospect from this amour, but that of passing the present moments agreeably. He only courted dissipation; but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happiness. At length, however, his debts amounting to a considerable sum, he was arrested, and thrown into prison. He endeavoured at first to conceal his situation from his beautiful mistress; but she soon came to a knowledge of his distress, and took a fatal resolution of freeing him from confinement by discharging all the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> was at that time in <HI>London,</HI> and re∣presented to the thoughtless young lady, that such a measure would effectually ruin both; that so warm a concern for the interests of Mr. <HI>S</HI>—, would, in the first place, quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our sex, and, what was worse, lessen her reputation in those of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <HI>S</HI>— from prison, would be only a temporary relief; that a mind so gene∣rous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and, instead of improving in friend∣ship or affection, he would only study to avoid a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Then Master of the Ceremonies at Bath.</NOTE>
<PB N="4" REF="37"/>
creditor he could never repay: that, though small favours produce good-will, great ones destroy friendship. These admonitions, however, were disregarded; and she too late found the prudence and truth of her adviser. In short, her fortune was by this means exhausted; and, with all her attractions, she found her acquaintance began to disesteem her, in proportion as she became poor.</P>
<P>In this situation she accepted Mr. <HI>Nash</HI>'s invita∣tion of returning to <HI>Bath.</HI> He promised to intro∣duce her to the best company there; and he was assured that her merit would do the rest. Upon her very first appearance, ladies of the highest dis∣tinction courted her friendship and esteem; but a settled melancholy had taken possession of her mind, and no amusements that they could propose were sufficient to divert it. Yet still, as if from habit, she followed the crowd in its levities, and frequented those places where all persons endea∣vour to forget themselves in the bustle of cere∣mony and show.</P>
<P>Her beauty, her simplicity, and her unguarded situation, soon drew the attention of a designing wretch, who at that time kept one of the Rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> and who thought that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account. This woman's name was Dame <HI>Lindsey,</HI> a creature, who, though vicious, was in appearance sanctified; and, though designing, had some wit and humour. She began, by the humblest assiduity, to ingratiate
<PB N="5" REF="38"/>
herself with Miss <HI>S</HI>—; shewed that she could be amusing as a companion, and, by frequent offers of money, proved that she could be useful as a friend. Thus, by degrees, she gained an entire ascendant over this poor, thoughtless, deserted girl; and, in less than one year, namely, about 1727, Miss <HI>S</HI>—, without ever transgressing the laws of virtue, had entirely lost her reputation. Whenever a person was wanting to make up a party for play at Dame <HI>Lindsey</HI>'s, <HI>Sylvia,</HI> as she was then familiarly called, was sent for, and was obliged to suffer all those slights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of fortune.</P>
<P>In most, even the greatest minds, the heart at last becomes level with the meanness of its condi∣tion; but in this charming girl it struggled hard with adversity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with sullen reluctance.</P>
<P>But though in the course of three years she was in the very eye of public inspection, yet Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the strictest observations, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of suffering herself to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and, at her own hazard, playing for the amusement and ad∣vantage of others. Her friend, Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> there∣fore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with Dame <HI>Lindsey,</HI> and to rent part of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s house, in <HI>Queen-square,</HI> where she
<PB N="6" REF="39"/>
behaved with the utmost complaisance, regularity, and virtue.</P>
<P>In this situation, her detestation of life still con∣tinued; she found, that time would infallibly de∣prive her of part of her attractions, and that con∣tinual solicitude would impair the rest. With these reflections she would frequently entertain herself, and an old faithful maid, in the vales of <HI>Bath,</HI> whenever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even sometimes start questions in company, with seeming unconcern, in order to know what act of suicide was easiest, and which was attended with the smallest pain. When tired with exercise, she generally retired to meditation; and she became habituated to early hours of sleep and rest. But when the weather prevented her usual exercise, and her sleep was thus more diffi∣cult, she made it a rule to rise from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till she began to find an inclination for repose.</P>
<P>This custom made it necessary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room: and the maid usually, when she withdrew, locked the chamber-door; and, pushing the key under it beyond reach, her mistress, by that constant me∣thod, lay undisturbed till seven o'clock in the morning; then she arose, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a signal for the maid to return.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="40"/>This state of seeming piety, regularity, and prudence, continued for some time, till the gay, celebrated, toasted Miss <HI>Sylvia</HI> was sunk into an housekeeper to the gentleman at whose house she lived. She was unable to keep company, for want of the elegancies of dress, that are the usual pass∣port among the polite; and she was too haughty to seem to want them. The fashionable, the amusing, and the polite, in society, now seldom visited her; and, from being once the object of every eye, she was now deserted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own impru∣dence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and part of his family, were gone to <HI>London.</HI> Miss <HI>Sylvia</HI> was left with the rest, as a governess, at <HI>Bath.</HI> She sometimes saw Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> and acknowledged the friendship of his admoni∣tions, though she refused to accept any other marks of his generosity than that of advice. Upon the close of the day in which Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> was expected to re∣turn from <HI>London,</HI> she expressed some uneasiness at the disappointment of not seeing him; took parti∣cular care to settle the affairs of his family; and then, as usual, sat down to meditation. She now cast a retrospect over her past misconduct, and her ap∣proaching misery; she saw, that even affluence gave her no real happiness, and from indigence she thought nothing could be hoped but lingering calamity. She at length conceived the fatal reso∣lution of leaving a life, in which she could see no
<PB N="8" REF="41"/>
corner for comfort, and terminating a scene of imprudence in suicide.</P>
<P>Thus resolved, she sat down at her dining-room window, and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window:
<Q><L>O Death! thou pleasing end of human woe!</L>
<L>Thou cure for life! Thou greatest good below!</L>
<L>Still may'st thou fly the coward, and the slave,</L>
<L>And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave.</L></Q></P>
<P>She then went into company with the most chearful serenity; talked of indifferent subjects till supper; which she ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There she spent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber, she went into the nursery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay sleeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the consciousness of her meditated guilt, she could not avoid bursting into tears, and hugging it in her arms; she then bid her old ser∣vant a good night, for the first time she had ever done so, and went to bed as usual.</P>
<P>It is probable she soon quitted her bed, and was seized with an alternation of passions, before
<PB N="9" REF="42"/>
she yielded to the impulse of despair. She dressed herself in clean linen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her breast, just as a nurse pins the swaddling-clothes of an infant. A pink silk gir∣dle was the instrument with which she resolved to terminate her misery, and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread. The end of the former was tied with a noose, and the latter with three knots, at a small distance from one another.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, she sat down again, and read; for she left the book open at that place, in the story of <HI>Olympia,</HI> in the <HI>Orlando Furioso</HI> of <HI>Ari∣osto,</HI> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bosom friend, she was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event gave her fresh spirits to go through her fatal purpose; so standing upon a stool, and fling∣ing the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a closet-door that opened into her chamber, she remained suspended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor despairer fell upon the floor with such violence, that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the house about half an hour after two o'clock.</P>
<P>Recovering herself, she began to walk about the room, as her usual custom was when she wanted sleep; and the workman imagining it to be only some ordinary accident, again went to
<PB N="10" REF="43"/>
sleep. She once more, therefore, had recourse to a stronger girdle made of silver thread; and this kept her suspended till she died.</P>
<P>Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as usual for the ringing of the bell, and protracted her patience, hour after hour, till two o'clock in the afternoon; when the workmen at length en∣tering the room through the window, found their unfortunate mistress still hanging, and quite cold. The coroner's jury being impanelled, brought in their verdict, Lunacy; and her corpse was next night decently buried in her father's grave, at the charge of a female companion, with whom she had for many years an inseparable intimacy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a female wit, a toast, and a game∣ster; loved, admired, and forsaken; formed for the delight of society, fallen by imprudence into an object of pity. Hundreds in high life la∣mented her fate, and wished, when too late, to redress her injuries. They who once had helped to impair her fortune, now regretted that they assisted in so mean a pursuit. The little effects she had left behind were bought up with the great∣est avidity, by those who desired to preserve some token of a companion that once had given them such delight. The remembrance of every virtue she was possessed of was now improved by pity. Her former follies were few, but the last swelled them to a large amount. As she remains the
<PB N="11" REF="44"/>
strongest instance to posterity, that want of pru∣dence alone, almost cancels every other virtue. <BIBL>LIFE OF NASH, p. 84.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>CALAMITIES.</HEAD>
<P>MAN little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear, till he tries them. As in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every step we rise shews us some new and gloomy prospect of hidden disap∣pointment; so in our descent from the summits of pleasure, though the vale of misery below may appear at first dark and gloomy, yet the busy mind, still attentive to its own amusement, finds, as we descend, something to flatter and to please. Still as we approach, the darkest objects appear to brighten, and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation.

<P>THE English in general seem fonder of gaining the esteem than the love of those they converse with: this gives a formality to their amusements; their gayest conversations have something too wise for innocent relaxation; though in company you are seldom disgusted with the absurdity of a fool, you are seldom lifted into rapture by those strokes of vivacity which give instant, though not perma∣nent pleasure.</P>
<P>What they want, however, in gaiety, they make up in politeness. You smile at hearing me praise the English for their politeness: you who have heard very different accounts from the missionaries at Pekin, who have seen such a different behaviour in their merchants and seamen at home. But I must still repeat it, the English seem more polite than any of their neighbours: their great art in this respect lies in endeavouring, while they oblige, to lessen the force of the favour. Other coun∣tries are fond of obliging a stranger; but seem de∣sirous that he should be sensible of the obligation. The English confer their kindness with an ap∣pearance

<P>ALL things rare and brilliant will ever conti∣nue to be fashionable, while men derive greater advantage from opulence than virtue; while the means of appearing considerable are more easily ac∣quired than the title to be considered. The first impression we generally make, arises from our dress; and this varies in conformity to our inclinations, and the manner in which we desire to be considered. The modest man, or he who would wish to be thought so, desires to shew the simplicity of his mind by the plainness of his dress: the vain man, on the contrary, takes a pleasure in displaying his superiority, <Q REND="inline">"and is willing to incur the specta∣tor's dislike, so he does but excite his attention."</Q> <BIBL>HIST.

<HEAD>JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>Of all virtues Justice is the most difficult to be practised by a king who has a power to pardon. All men, even tyrants themselves, lean to mercy when unbiassed by passions or interest. The heart natu∣rally persuades to forgiveness; and pursuing the dictates of this pleasing deceiver, we are led to pre∣fer our private satisfaction to public utility. What a thorough love for the public, what a strong command over the passions, what a finely conduct∣ed judgment must he possess, who opposes the dic∣tates of reason to those of his heart, and prefers the
<PB N="26" REF="59"/>
future interest of his people to his own immediate satisfaction!</P>
<P>If still to a man's own natural biass for tender∣ness, we add the numerous solicitations made by a criminal's friends for mercy; if we survey a king not only opposing his own feelings, but reluctantly refusing those he regards, and this to satisfy the public, whose cries he may never hear, whose gra∣titude he may never receive; this surely is true greatness! Let us fancy ourselves for a moment in this just old man's place, surrounded by numbers, all soliciting the same favour, a favour that nature disposes us to grant, where the inducements to pity are laid before us in the strongest light, sup∣pliants at our feet, some ready to resent a refusal, none opposing a compliance; let us, I say, sup∣pose ourselves in such a situation, and I fancy we should find ourselves more apt to act the character of good-natured men than of upright magistrates.</P>
<P>What contributes to raise justice above all other kingly virtues is, that it is attended seldom with a due share of applause, and those who practise it must be influenced by greater motives than empty fame. The people are generally well pleased with a remission of punishment, and all that wears the appearance of humanity; it is the wise alone who are capable of discerning that impartial justice is the truest mercy: they know it to be difficult, very

The dignity of man is a subject that has always been the favourite theme of humanity; they have declaimed with that ostentation, which usually accompanies such as are sure of having a partial audience; they have ob∣tained victories, because there were none to op∣pose. Yet, from all I have ever read or seen, men appear more apt to err by having too high, than by having too despicable an opinion of their nature; and by attempting to exalt their original place in the creation, depress their real value in society. <BIBL>CIT.

<P>IN learning the useful part of every profession, very moderate abilities will suffice; even if the mind be a little balanced with stupidity, it may in this case be useful.

Life has been compared to a race; but the allusion still improves, by observing that the most swift are ever the least manageable.</P>
<P>TO know one profession only, is enough for one man to know; and this (whatever the professors may tell you to the contrary) is soon learned.

<P>A LIFE of independance is generally a life of virtue. It is that which fits the soul for every ge∣nerous flight of humanity, freedom, and friendship. To give should be our pleasure; but to receive, our shame. Serenity, health, and affluence, attend the desire of rising by labour; misery, rapentance, and disrespect, that of succeeding by extorted benevo∣lence. The man who can thank himself alone for the happiness he enjoys, is truly blest; and lovely, far more lovely, the sturdy gloom of laborious in∣digence, than the fawning simper of thriving adu∣lation. <BIBL>CIT.

<P>GENEROSITY properly applied will sup∣ply every other external advantage in life, but the love of those we converse with; it will procure esteem and a conduct resembling real affection: but actual love is the spontaneous production of the mind; no generosity can purchase, no re∣wards increase, nor no liberality continue it; the very person who is obliged, has it not in his power to force his lingering affections upon the object he should love, and voluntarily mix passion with gratitude. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>LOVE AND GRATITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE is the most easy and agreeable, and gra∣titude the most humiliating affection of the mind; we never reflect on the man we <HI>love,</HI> without ex∣ulting in our choice, while he who has bound us to him by <HI>benefits</HI> alone, rises to our idea as a per∣son to whom we have in some measure forfeited our freedom. Love and gratitude are seldom therefore found in the same breast without impair¦ing each other; we may tender the one or the other singly to those we converse with, but can∣not command both together. By attempting to in∣crease, we diminish them; the mind becomes bank∣rupt under too large obligations; all additional benefits lessen every hope of future return, and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderness. <BIBL>IBID. v. 2. p. 3.</BIBL></P>

<P>Hamti, the best and wisest emperor that ever filled the throne, after having gained three signal victories over the Tartars, who had invaded his dominions, returned to Nankin in order to enjoy the glory of his conquest. After he had rested for some days, the people, who are naturally fond of

processions, impatiently expected the triumphal en∣try, which emperors upon such occasions were ac∣customed to make. Their murmurs came to the emperor's ear. He loved his people, and was will∣ing to do all in his power to satisfy their just de¦sires. He therefore assured them that he intended, upon the next feast of the Lanterns, to exhi∣bit one of the most glorious triumphs that had ever been seen in China.</P>
<P>The people were in raptures at his condescen∣sion; and, on the appointed day; assembled at the gates of the palace with the most eager expecta∣tions. Here they waited for some time, without seeing any of those preparations which usually pre∣cede a pageant. The lantern, with ten thousand tapers, was not yet brought forth; the fire-works, which usually covered the city walls, were not yet lighted: the people once more began to murmur at this delay; when, in the midst of their impa∣tience, the palace gates flew open, and the emperor himself appeared, not in splendor or magnificence, but in an ordinary habit, followed by the blind, the maimed, and the strangers of the city, all in new clothes, and each carrying in his hand money enough to supply his necessities for the year. The people were at first amazed, but soon perceived the wisdom of their king, who taught them, that to make one man happy, was more truly great than having ten thousand captives groaning at the wheels of his chariot. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been often said, that the season of youth is the season of pleasures; but this can only be true in savage countries, where but little prepara∣tion is made for the perfection of human nature, and where the mind has but a very small part in the enjoyment. It is otherwise in those places where nature is carried to the highest pitch of re∣finement, in which this season of the greatest sen∣sual delight is wisely made subservient to the suc∣ceeding, and more rational one of manhood. Youth, with us, is but a scene of preparation; a drama, upon the right conduct of which all fu∣ture happiness is to depend. The youth who follows his appetites, too soon seizes the cup, be∣fore it has received its best ingredients; and, by anticipating his pleasures, robs the remaining parts of life of their share; so that his eagerness only produces a manhood of imbecillity, and an age of pain. <BIBL>HIST.

<P>It is particularly in the eyes that the passions are painted; and in which we may most readily dis∣cover their beginning. The eye seems to belong to the soul more than any other organ; it seems to participate of all its emotions, as well the most soft and tender, as the most tumultuous and forceful.

The oppressions of a monarch are generally exerted only in the narrow sphere round him; the oppressions of the governors of a republic, though not so flagrant, are more universal: the monarch is apt to commit great enormities, but they seldom reach the multitude at humble distance from the throne; the republican despot oppresses the multi∣tude that lies within the circle of his influence,

<HEAD>OPINION OF WOMEN; WITH AN ACCOUNT OF CATHARINA ALEXOWNA, EMPRESS OF RUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE modest virgin, the prudent wife, or the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queens. She who makes her husband and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice, and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than ladies described in romance, whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="83"/>Women, it has been observed, are not naturally formed for great cares themselves, but to soften ours. Their tenderness is the proper reward for the dangers we undergo for their preservation; and the ease and chearfulness of their conversation, our desirable retreat from the fatigues of intense appli∣cation. They are confined within the narrow li∣mits of domestic assiduity; and when they stray beyond them, they move beyond their sphere, and consequently without grace.</P>
<P>Fame, therefore, has been very unjustly dis∣pensed, among the female sex. Those who least deserved to be remembered, meet our admiration and applause; while many, who have been an ho∣nour to humanity, are passed over in silence. Per∣haps no age has produced a stronger instance of misplaced fame than the present: the <HI>Semiramis</HI> and the <HI>Thalestris</HI> of antiquity are talked of, while a modern character, infinitely greater than either, is unnoticed and unknown.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account seems taken from the manuscript memoirs of <HI>H. Spelman,</HI> Esq.</NOTE><HI>Catharina Alexowna,</HI> born near <HI>Derpat,</HI> a little city in <HI>Livonia,</HI> was heir to no other inheritance than the virtues and frugality other parents. Her father being dead, she lived with her aged mother, in their cottage covered with straw; and both, though very poor, were very contented. Here, re∣tired
<PB N="51" REF="84"/>
from the gaze of the world, by the labour of her hands she supported her parent, who was now incapable of supporting herself. While <HI>Catharina</HI> spun, the old woman would sit by, and read some book of devotion; thus, when the fatigues of the day were over, both would sit down contentedly by their fire-side, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant festivity.</P>
<P>Though her face and person were models of per∣fection, yet her whole attention seemed bestowed upon her mind; her mother taught her to read, and an old <HI>Lutheran</HI> minister instructed her in the maxims and duties of religion. Nature had fur∣nished her not only with a ready, but a solid turn of thought, not only with a strong, but a right un∣derstanding. Such truly female accomplishments procured her several solicitations of marriage from the peasants of the country; but their offers were refused; for she loved her mother too tenderly to think of a separation.</P>
<P><HI>Catharina</HI> was fifteen when her mother died: she now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the <HI>Lutheran</HI> minister, by whom she had been instructed from her childhood. In his house she resided, in quality of governess to his children; at once reconciling in her character unerring pru∣dence with surprising vivacity.</P>
<P>The old man, who regarded her as one of his own children, had her instructed in dancing and
<PB N="52" REF="85"/>
music, by the masters who attended the rest of his family. Thus she continued to improve, till he died; by which accident she was once more re∣duced to pristine poverty. The country of <HI>Livo∣nia</HI> was at this time wasted by war, and lay in a most miserable state of desolation. Those calami∣ties are ever most heavy upon the poor; wherefore <HI>Catharina,</HI> though possessed of so many accom∣plishments, experienced all the miseries of hope∣less indigence. Provisions becoming every day more scarce, and her private stock being entirely exhausted, she resolved at last to travel to <HI>Marien∣burgh,</HI> a city of greater plenty.</P>
<P>With her scanty wardrobe, packed up in a wal∣let, she set out on her journey, on foot. She was to walk through a region miserable by nature, but rendered still more hideous by the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Russians,</HI> who, as each happened to become masters, plundered it at discretion: but hunger had taught her to despise the dangers and fatigues of the way.</P>
<P>One evening, upon her journey, as she had en∣tered a cottage by the way-side, to take up her lodging for the night, she was insulted by two <HI>Swedish</HI> soldiers, who insisted upon qualifying her, as they termed it, <HI>to fellow she camp.</HI> They might, probably, have carried their insults into violence, had not a subaltern officer, accidentally passing by, come in to her assistance. Upon his appearing, the soldiers immediately desisted; but her thank∣fulness
<PB N="53" REF="86"/>
was hardly greater than her surprise, when she instantly recollected, in her deliverer, the son of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> minister, her former instructor, benefactor, and friend.</P>
<P>This was an happy interview for <HI>Catharina.</HI> The little stock of money she had brought from home was by this time quite exhausted; her clothes were gone, piece by piece, in order to satisfy those who had entertained her in their houses: her gene∣rous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could spare, to buy her clothes, furnished her with an horse, and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr. <HI>Gluck,</HI> a faithful friend of his father's, and Superintendant of <HI>Marienburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Our beautiful stranger had only to appear, to be well received: she was immediately admitted into the Superintendant's family, as governess to his two daughters; and, though yet but seventeen, shewed herself capable of instructing her sex, not only in virtue, but politeness. Such was her good-sense and beauty, that her master himself in a short time offered her his hand, which to his great sur∣prise she thought proper to refuse. Actuated by a principle of gratitude, she was resolved to marry her deliverer only, even though he had lost an arm, and was otherwise disfigured by wounds, in the service.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent further solicita∣tions from others, as soon as the officer came to
<PB N="54" REF="87"/>
town upon duty, she offered him her person, which he accepted with transport; and their nuptials were solemnised as usual. But all the lines of her fortune were to be striking: the very day on which they were married, the <HI>Russians</HI> laid siege to <HI>Ma∣rienburgh.</HI> The unhappy soldier had now no time to enjoy the well-earned pleasures of matrimony; he was called off before consummation to an attack, from which he was never after seen to return.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the siege went on with fury, aggravated on one side by obstinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous; the in∣nocent peasant and the harmless virgin often shared the fate of the soldier in arms. <HI>Marienburgh</HI> was taken by assault; and such was the fury of the as∣sailants, that not only the garrison, but almost all the inhabitants, men, women, and children, were put to the sword. At length, when the carnage was pretty well over, <HI>Catharina</HI> was found hid in an oven.</P>
<P>She had been hitherto poor, but still was free; she was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a slave: in this situation, how∣ever, she behaved with piety and humility; and, though misfortunes had abated her vivacity, yet she was chearful. The fame of her merit and re∣signation reached even Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI> General: he desired to see her, was struck with her beauty, bought her from the soldier, her master,
<PB N="55" REF="88"/>
and placed her under the direction of his own sister. Here she was treated with all the respect which her merit deserved, while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this situation, when <HI>Peter the Great</HI> paying the Prince a visit, <HI>Catharina</HI> happened to come in with some dry fruits, which she served round with peculiar modesty. The mighty monarch saw, and was struck with her beauty. He returned the next day, called for the beautiful slave, asked her several questions, and found her understanding even more perfect than her person.</P>
<P>He had been forced, when young, to marry from motives of interest; he was now resolved to marry pursuant to his own inclinations. He im∣mediately enquired the history of the fair <HI>Livonian,</HI> who was not yet eighteen. He traced her through the vale of obscurity, through all the vicissitudes of her fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanness of her birth was no obstruc∣tion to his design; their nuptials were solemnised in private; the Prince assuring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the properest ladder to a throne.</P>
<P>We now see <HI>Catharina,</HI> from the low, mud-walled cottage, Empress of the greatest kingdom upon earth. The poor solitary wanderer is now surrounded by thousands, who find happiness in her smile. She, who formerly wanted a meal, is
<PB N="56" REF="89"/>
now capable of diffusing plenty upon whole na∣tions. To her fortune she owed a part of this pre∣eminence, but to her virtues more.</P>
<P>She ever after retained those great qualities which first placed her on a throne; and while the extraordinary prince, her husband, laboured for the reformation of his male subjects, she studied, in her turn, the improvement of her own sex. She altered their dresses, introduced mixed assemblies, instituted an order of female knighthood, and, at length, when she had greatly filled all the stations of empress, friend, wife, and mother, bravely died without regret,—regretted by all. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>THE MAN OF THE WORLD. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IF you are fond of hearing <HI>hair-breadth 'scapes,</HI> my history must certainly please; for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of starving, without ever being starved.</P>
<P>My father, the younger son of a good family, was possessed of a small living in the church. His education was above his fortune, and his gene∣rosity greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers still poorer than himself; for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in praise; and this was all he wanted. The same ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army, influenced my father at the head of his table: he told the story of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the story of Taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar. Thus his pleasure increased, in propor∣tion to the pleasure he gave: he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him.</P>
<P>As his fortune was but small, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intentions of leaving his children money, for that was dross; he was resolved they should have learning, for
<PB N="61" REF="94"/>
learning, he used to observe, was better than sil∣ver or gold. For this purpose he undertook to instruct us himself; and took as much pains to form our morals, as to improve our understanding. We were told that universal benevolence was what first cemented society: we were taught to con∣sider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the <HI>human face divine</HI> with affection and esteem: he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or ficti∣tious distress; in a word, we were perfectly in∣structed in the art of <HI>giving away</HI> thousands, be∣fore we were taught the more necessary qualifica∣tions of <HI>getting</HI> a farthing.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid imagining, that, thus refined by his lessons out of all my suspicion, and divested of even all the little cunning which nature had given me, I resembled, upon my first entrance into the busy and insidious world, one of those gladiators who were exposed without armour in the amphi∣theatre at Rome. My father, however, who had only seen the world on one side, seemed to triumph in my superior discernment; though my whole stock of wisdom consisted in being able to talk like himself upon subjects that once were useful, because they were then topics of the busy world, but that now were utterly useless, because con∣nected with the busy world no longer.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="95"/>The first opportunity he had of finding his ex∣pectations disappointed, was at the very middling figure I made in the University: he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation, but was mor∣tified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown. His disappointment might have been partly ascri∣bed to his having over-rated my talents, and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time when my imagination and memory, yet un∣satisfied, were more eager after new objects, than desirous of reasoning upon those I knew. This did not, however, please my tutors, who observed, indeed, that I was a little dull; but at the same time allowed, that I seemed to be <HI>very good-natured,</HI> and had no harm in me.</P>
<P>After I had resided at college seven years, my father died, and left me—his blessing. Thus shoved from shore without ill-nature to protect, or cunning to guide, or proper stores to subsist me in so dangerous a voyage, I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty-two. But, in order to settle in life, my friends <HI>advised</HI> (for they always advise when they begin to despise us) they ad∣vised me, I say, to go into orders.</P>
<P>To be obliged to wear a long wig, when I liked a short one, or a black coat, when I generally dressed in brown, I thought was such a restraint upon my liberty, that I absolutely rejected the
<PB N="63" REF="96"/>
proposal. A priest in England, is not the same mortified creature with a bonze in China; with us, not he that fasts best, but eats best, is reckon∣ed the best liver: yet I rejected a life of luxury, indolence, and ease, from no other consideration but that boyish one of dress; so that my friends were now perfectly satisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the least harm in him, and was so very good-natured.</P>
<P>Poverty naturally begets dependance, and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man. At first I was surprised, that the situation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought disagreeable; there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke, and laughing when he looked round for applause. This even good-manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too soon, that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself; and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at setting him right, than at re∣ceiving his absurdities with submission. To flatter those we do not know, is an easy task; but to flat∣ter our intimate acquaintances, all whose foibles are strongly in our eye, is drudgery insupportable. Every time I now opened my lips in praise, my fals∣hood went to my conscience: his lordship soon per¦ceived me to be unfit for service; I was therefore discharged; my patron at the same time being
<PB N="64" REF="97"/>
graciously pleased to observe, that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the least harm in me.</P>
<P>Disappointed in ambition, I had recourse to love. A young lady, who lived with her aunt, and was possessed of a pretty fortune in her own disposal, had given me, as I fancied, some reasons to expect success. The symptoms by which I was guided were striking: she had always laughed with me at her aukward acquaintance, and at her aunt among the number; she always observed, that a man of sense would make a better husband than a fool, and I as constantly applied the observation in my own favour. She continually talked in my company of friendship, and the beauties of the mind, and spoke of Mr. Shrimp my rival's high-heel'd shoes with detestation. These were circumstances which I thought strongly in my fa∣vour; so, after resolving, and re-resolving, I had courage enough to tell her my mind. Miss heard my proposal with serenity, seeming at the same time to study the figures of her fan. Out at last it came. There was but one small objection to complete our happiness, which was no more than —that she was married three months before to Mr. Shrimp with high-heel'd shoes! By way of conso∣lation, however, she observed, that, though I was disappointed in her, my addresses to her aunt would probably kindle her into sensibility; as the old lady always allowed me to be very good-na∣tured,
<PB N="65" REF="98"/>
and not to have the least share of harm in me.</P>
<P>Yet still I had friends, numerous friends; and to them I was resolved to apply. O Friendship! thou fond soother of the human breast, to thee we fly in every calamity; to thee the wretched seek for succour; on thee the care-tired son of misery fondly relies; from thy kind assistance the unfor∣tunate always hopes relief, and may be ever sure of—disappointment! My first application was to a city scrivener, who had frequently offered to lend me money, when he knew I did not want it. I informed him, that now was the time to put his friendship to the test; that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occasion, and was resolved to take it up from him. And pray, Sir, cried my friend, do you want all this money? Indeed, I never wanted it more, returned I. I am sorry for that, cries the scrivener, with all my heart; for they who want money when they come to borrow, will always want money when they should come to pay.</P>
<P>From him I flew with indignation to one of the best friends I had in the world, and made the same request. Indeed, Mr. Dry-bone, cries my friend, I always thought it would come to this. You know, Sir, I would not advise you but for your own good; but your conduct has hitherto been ri∣diculous in the highest degree, and some of your
<PB N="66" REF="99"/>
acquaintance always thought you a very silly fel∣low. Let me see—you want two hundred pounds; do you want only two hundred, Sir, exactly? To confess a truth, returned I, I shall want three hundred; but then I have another friend, from whom I can borrow the rest. Why then, replied my friend, if you would take my advice—and you know I should not presume to advise you but for your own good—I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole sum from that other friend; and then one note will serve for all, you know.</P>
<P>Poverty now began to come fast upon me; yet, instead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor, I became every day more indolent and simple. A friend was arrested for fifty pounds; I was unable to extricate him, except by becom∣ing his bail. When at liberty, he fled from his creditors, and left me to take his place. In pri∣son I expected greater satisfaction than I had en∣joyed at large. I hoped to converse with men in this new world, simple and believing like myself; but I found them as cunning and as cautious as those in the world I had left behind. They spunged up my money whilst it lasted; borrowed my coals, and never paid them; and cheated me when I played at cribbage. All this was done because they believed me to be very good-natured, and knew that I had no harm in me.</P>
<P>Upon my first entrance into this mansion, which is to some the abode of despair, I felt no sensa∣tions
<PB N="67" REF="100"/>
different from those I experienced abroad. I was now on one side the door, and those who were unconfined were on the other; this was all the difference between us. At first, indeed, I felt some uneasiness, in considering how I should be able to provide this week for the wants of the week ensuing; but, after, some time, if I found myself sure of eating one day, I never troubled my head how I was to be supplied another. I seized every precarious meal with the utmost good-humour, indulged, no rants of spleen at my situa∣tion, never called down heaven and all the stars to behold me dining upon an half-penny-worth of radishes; my very companions were taught to be∣lieve that I liked sallad better than mutton. I contented myself with thinking, that all my life I should either eat white bread or brown; con∣sidered that all that happened was best, laughed when I was not in pain, took the world as it went, and read Tacitus often, for want of more books and company.</P>
<P>How long I might have continued in this tor∣pid state of simplicity I cannot tell, had I not been roused by seeing an old acquaintance, whom I knew to be a prudent blockhead, preferred to a place in the government. I now found that I had pursued a wrong track, and that the true way of be∣ing able to relieve others, was to aim at indepen∣dance myself. My immediate care, therefore, was to leave my present habitation, and make an entire re∣formation
<PB N="68" REF="101"/>
in my conduct and behaviour. For a free, open, undesigning deportment, I put on that of closeness, prudence and oeconomy. One of the most heroic actions I ever performed, and for which I shall praise myself as long as I live, was the refusing half a crown to an old acquaint∣ance, at the time when he wanted it, and I had it to spare; for this alone I deserve to be decreed an ovation.</P>
<P>I now, therefore, pursued a course of uninter∣rupted frugality, seldom wanted a dinner, and was consequently invited to twenty. I soon be∣gan to get the character of a saving hunks that had money; and insensibly grew into esteem. Neighbours have asked my advice in the disposal of their daughters, and I have always taken care not to give any. I have contracted a friendship with an alderman, only by observing, that if we take a farthing from a thousand pound, it will be a thousand pound no longer. I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table, by pretending to hate gravy; and am now actually upon treaty of mar∣riage with a rich widow, for only having observed that bread was rising. If ever I am asked a ques∣tion, whether I know it or not, instead of an∣swering, I only smile, and look wise. If a cha∣rity is proposed, I go about with the hat, but put nothing in myself. If a wretch solicits my pity, I observe, that the world is filled with impostors; and take a certain method of not being deceived,
<PB N="69" REF="102"/>
by never relieving. In short, I now find the truest way of finding esteem, even from the indigent, is <HI>to give away nothing, and thus have much in our power to give.</HI> <BIBL>CIT. OF THE WORLD, v. 1. p. 103.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>EDUCATING CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ever found it a vain task to try to make a child's learning its amusement; nor do I see what good end it would answer, were it actually attained. The child ought to have its share of play, and it will be benefited thereby; and for every reason, also, it ought to have its share of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus accustomed to fatigues and subordination; and whatever be the person's future employment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it: he will be thus enabled to support the drudgeries of office with content, or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, should by times be put to its duty; and be taught to know, that the task is to be done, or the punishment to be endured. I do not object against alluring it to duty by reward; but we well know, that the mind will be more strongly stimulated by pain; and both may, upon some occasions, take their turn to operate. In this manner, a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and labouring with them at school, will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up under the wing of any spe∣culative system-maker; and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true, indeed, that, when educated in this manner, the boy may not be so seemingly sensible and forward as one bred up under solitary instruction; and, perhaps, this early forwardness is more engaging
<PB N="76" REF="109"/>
than useful. It is well known, that many of those children who are such prodigies of literature before ten, have not made an adequate progress to twenty. It should seem, that they only began learning manly things before their time; and, while others were busied in picking up that knowledge adapted to their age and curiosity, these were forced upon subjects unsuited to their years; and, upon that account alone, appearing extraordinary. The stock of knowledge in both may be equal; but with this difference, that each is yet to learn what the other knows. <BIBL>HIST. OF ANIMALS, p. 67.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE, when founded in the heart, will shew itself in a thousand unpremeditated sallies of fond∣ness; but every cool deliberate exhibition of the passion, only argues little understanding, or great insincerity.</P>
<P><HI>Choang</HI> was the fondest husband, and <HI>Hansi</HI> the most endearing wife, in all the kingdom of <HI>Korea:</HI> they were a pattern of conjugal bliss; the inhabi∣tants of the country around saw, and envied their felicity; wherever <HI>Choang</HI> came, <HI>Hansi</HI> was sure to follow; and in all the pleasures of <HI>Hansi, Cho∣ang</HI> was admitted a partner. They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared, shewing every mark of mutual satisfaction, embracing, kissing; their mouths were for ever joined; and, to speak in the language of anatomy, it was with them one per∣petual anastomosis.</P>
<P>Their love was so great, that it was thought no∣thing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in some measure, di∣minished the husband's assurance of his wife's fide∣lity; for love so refined as his, was subject to a thousand little disquietudes.</P>
<P>Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at some distance from his house, he there perceived a lady dressed in the deepest mourning,
<PB N="81" REF="114"/>
(being cloathed all over in white) fanning the wet clay that was raised over one of the graves with a large fan, which she held in her hand. <HI>Choang,</HI> who had early been taught wisdom in the school of <HI>Lao,</HI> was unable to assign a cause for her pre∣sent employment; and, coming up, civilly demand∣ed the reason. <Q REND="inline">"Alas!" replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears, "how is it possible to survive the loss of my husband, who lies buried in this grave? He was the best of men, the tenderest of husbands; with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave should be dry; and here you see me steadily resolving to obey his will, and endeavouring to dry it with my fan. I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his com∣mands, and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave should take up four days in drying."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> who was struck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid smiling at her haste to be married; but, concealing the cause of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her some consolation. As soon as he and his guest were re∣turned, he imparted to <HI>Hansi</HI> in private what he had seen, and could not avoid expressing his un∣easiness, that such might be his own case, if his dearest wife should one day happen to survive him.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="115"/>It is impossible to describe <HI>Hansi</HI>'s resentment at so unkind a suspicion. As her passion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, she em∣ployed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamations, to chide his suspicions; the widow herself was in∣veighed against; and <HI>Hansi</HI> declared she was re∣solved never to sleep under the same roof with a wretch, who, like her, could be guilty of such barefaced inconstancy. The night was cold and stormy; however, the stranger was obliged to seek another lodging, for <HI>Choang</HI> was not disposed to resist, and <HI>Hansi</HI> would have her way.</P>
<P>The widow had scarce been gone an hour, when an old disciple of <HI>Choang</HI>'s, whom he had not seen for many years, came to pay him a visit. He was received with the utmost ceremony, placed in the most honourable seat at supper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. <HI>Choang</HI> and <HI>Hansi</HI> exhibited open marks of mutual tenderness and unfeigned reconciliation: nothing could equal their apparent happiness; so fond an husband, so obe∣dient a wife, few could behold without regretting their own infelicity; when, lo! their happiness was at once disturbed by a most fatal accident. <HI>Choang</HI> fell lifeless in an apoplectic fit upon the floor. Every method was used, but in vain, for his recovery. <HI>Hansi</HI> was at first inconsolable for his death: after some hours, however, she found spirits to read his last will. The ensuing day she began to moralize and talk wisdom; the next day
<PB N="83" REF="116"/>
she was able to comfort the young disciple; and, on the third, to shorten a long story, they both agreed to be married.</P>
<P>There was now no longer mourning in the apart∣ments; the body of <HI>Choang</HI> was now thrust into an old coffin, and placed in one of the meanest rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre∣scribed by law for his interment. In the mean time, <HI>Hansi,</HI> and the young disciple, were arrayed in the most magnificent habits; the bride wore in her nose a jewel of immense price, and her lover was dressed in all the finery of his former master, together with a pair of artificial whiskers that reached down to his toes. The hour of their nup∣tials was arrived; the whole family sympathised with their approaching happiness; the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffused the most exquisite perfume, and a lustre more bright than noon-day. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment, with impatience; when his servant approaching with terror in his countenance, informed her, that his master was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unless the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and applied to his breast. She scarce waited to hear the end of his story, when, tucking up her clothes, she ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where <HI>Choang</HI> lay, resolving to apply the heart of her dead husband as a cure for the living. She therefore struck the lid with the ut∣most violence. In a few blows the coffin flew open,
<PB N="84" REF="117"/>
when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move. Terrified at the sight, <HI>Hansi</HI> dropped the mattock, and <HI>Choang</HI> walked out, astonished at his own situation, his wife's un∣usual magnificence, and her more amazing sur∣prise. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cause of so much splendour. He was not long in suspence, before his domestics informed him of every transaction since he first became in∣sensible. He could scarce believe what they told him, and went in pursuit of <HI>Hansi</HI> herself, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But she prevented his reproaches: he found her weltering in blood; for she had stabbed herself to the heart, being unable to sur∣vive her shame and disappointment.</P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> being a philosopher, was too wise to make any loud lamentations; he thought it best to bear his loss with serenity; so, mending up the old coffin where he had lain himself, he placed his faithless spouse in his room; and, unwilling that so many nuptial preparations should be expended in vain, he the same night married the widow with the large fan.</P>
<P>As they both were apprised of the foibles of each other before-hand, they knew how to excuse them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquillity, and not expecting rap∣ture, made a shift to find contentment. <BIBL>CIT. OF THE WORLD, v. 1. p. 63.</BIBL></P>

<P>JUSTICE may be defined, that virtue which impels us to give to every person what is his due.

<HEAD>ESSAY ON FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few subjects which have been more written upon, and less understood, than that of Friendship. To follow the dictates of some, this virtue, instead of being the assuager of pain, be∣comes the source of every inconvenience. Such speculatists, by expecting too much from friendship, dissolve the connexion, and, by drawing the bands too closely, at length break them. Almost all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they persuade us to friendships, which we find impos∣sible to sustain to the last; so that this sweetner of life, under proper regulations, is, by their means, rendered inaccessible or uneasy. It is certain, the best method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it, in some measure, make itself; a similitude of minds or studies, and even sometimes a diversity of pursuits, will produce all the pleasures that arise from it. The current of tenderness widens, as it proceeds: and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good-nature far each other,
<PB N="90" REF="123"/>
when they were at first only in pursuit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friendship is like a debt of honour; the mo∣ment it is talked of, it loses its real name, and assumes the more ungrateful form of obligation. From hence we find, that those who regularly undertake to cultivate friendship, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings, which dependance gathers round us, is al∣most ever unfriendly; they secretly wish the term of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the most virtue, are pre∣pared to reserve all their affections for their pa∣tron, only in the hour of his decline. Increasing the obligations which are laid upon such minds, only increases their burthen; they feel themselves unable to repay the immensity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent resent∣ment at the hand that it stretched out with offers of service and relief.</P>
<P><HI>Plautinus</HI> was a man who thought that every good was bought from riches; and as he was pos∣sessed of great wealth, and had a mind naturally formed for virtue, he resolved to gather a circle of the best men round him. Among the number of his dependants was <HI>Musidorus,</HI> with a mind just as fond of virtue, yet not less proud than his pa∣tron. His circumstances, however, were such as forced him to stoop to the good offices of his su∣perior,

and he saw himself daily among a number of others loaded with benefits and protestations of friendship.

A want of affection breaks out in the most trifling instances, and <HI>Plautinus</HI> had skill enough to ob∣serve the minutest actions of the man he wished to make his friend.

<P>It may be easily supposed, that the reserve of our poor proud man, was soon construed into in∣gratitude; and such, indeed, in the common ac∣ceptation of the world it was. Wherever <HI>Musi∣dorus</HI> appeared, he was remarked as the ungrate∣ful man; he had acccepted favours, it was said, and had still the insolence to pretend to indepen∣dance.

<P><PB N="92" REF="125"/>To this story, taken from modern life, I shall add one more, taken from a Greek writer of an∣tiquity:—<Q REND="inline"><P>'Two Jewish soldiers, in the time of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> had made many campaigns together; and a participation of dangers, at length, bred an union of hearts. They were remarked through∣out the whole army, as the two friendly brothers; they felt and fought for each other. Their friend∣ship might have continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the famous John, who headed a particular party of the Jew∣ish male-contents.</P>
<P>From this moment their former love was con∣verted into the most inveterate enmity. They at∣tached themselves to opposite factions, and sought each other's lives in the conflict of adverse party. In this manner they continued for more than two years, vowing mutual revenge, and animated with an unconquerable spirit of aversion. At length, however, that party of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to which the mean soldier belonged, joining with the <HI>Romans,</HI> it became victorious, and drove <HI>John,</HI> with all his adherents, into the Temple. History has given us more than one picture of the dreadful conflagration of that superb edifice.

<PB N="93" REF="126"/>
situation of things, that the now-successful sol∣dier saw his former friend upon the battlements of the highest tower, looking round with horror, and just ready to be consumed with flames. All his former tenderness now returned; he saw the man of his bosom just going to perish; and, unable to withstand the impulse, he ran spreading his arms, and crying out to his friend, to leap down from the top, and find safety with him. The Centu∣rion from above heard and obeyed, and, casting himself from the top of the tower, into his fel∣low-soldier's arms, both fell a sacrifice on the spot; one being crushed to death by the weight of his companion, and the other dashed to pieces by the greatness of his fall.'</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>SABINUS AND OLINDA.</HEAD>
<P>IN a fair, rich, flourishing country, whose cliffs are washed by the German ocean, lived <HI>Sabinus,</HI> a youth formed by Nature to make a conquest
<PB N="95" REF="128"/>
wherever he thought proper; but the constancy of his disposition fixed him only with <HI>Olinda.</HI></P>
<P>He was, indeed, superior to her in fortune; but that defect on her side was so amply supplied by her merit, that none was thought more worthy of his regards than she. He loved her, he was be∣loved by her; and, in a short time, by joining hands publicly, they avowed the union of their hearts. But, alas! none, however fortunate, however happy, are exempt from the shafts of en∣vy, and the malignant effects of ungoverned ap∣petite. How unsafe, how detestable are they who have this fury for their guide! How certainly will it lead them from themselves, and plunge them in errors they would have shuddered at, even in ap∣prehension! <HI>Ariana,</HI> a lady of many amiable qua∣lities, very nearly allied to <HI>Sabinus,</HI> and highly esteemed by him, imagined herself slighted, and injuriously treated, since his marriage with <HI>Olinda.</HI> By incautiously suffering this jealousy to corrode in her breast, she began to give a loose to passion: she forgot those many virtues, for which she had been so long, and so justly applauded. Cause∣less suspicion, and mistaken resentment, betrayed her into all the gloom of discontent: she sighed without ceasing; the happiness of others gave her intolerable pain: she thought of nothing but re∣venge. How unlike what she was, the chearful, the prudent, the compassionate <HI>Ariana!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="129"/>She continually laboured to disturb an union so firmly, so affectionately founded, and planned every scheme which she thought most likely to dis∣turb it.</P>
<P>Fortune seemed willing to promote her unjust intentions; the circumstances of <HI>Sabinus</HI> had been long embarrassed by a tedious law-suit, and the court determining the cause unexpectedly in favour of his opponent, it sunk his fortune to the lowest pitch of penury from the highest affluence.</P>
<P>From the nearness of relationship, <HI>Sabinus</HI> ex∣pected from <HI>Ariana</HI> those assistances his present situation required; but she was insensible to all his entreaties, and the justice of every remon∣strance, unless he first separated from <HI>Olinda,</HI> whom she regarded with detestation. Upon a compliance with her desires in this respect, she promised her fortune, her interest, and her all, should be at his command. <HI>Sabinus</HI> was shocked at the proposal; he loved his wife with inexpres∣sible tenderness, and refused those offers with in∣dignation which were to be purchased at so high a price: <HI>Ariana</HI> was no less displeased to find her offers rejected, and gave a loose to all that warmth which she had long endeavoured to suppress.</P>
<P>Reproach generally produces recrimination; the quarrel rose to such a height, that <HI>Sabinus</HI> was marked for destruction; and the very next day,
<PB N="97" REF="130"/>
the strength of an old family debt, he was sent to jail, with none but <HI>Olinda</HI> to comfort him in his miseries. In this mansion of distress they lived together with resignation, and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of domestic concern. Their fellow-prisoners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a desire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying those little comforts that a prison affords, <HI>Sabinus</HI> and <HI>Olinda</HI> were sure to be of the party. Instead of reproach∣ing each for their mutual wretchedness, they both lightened it, by bearing each a share of the load imposed by Providence. Whenever <HI>Sabinus</HI> shew∣ed the least concern on his dear partner's account, she conjured him by the love he bore her, by those tender ties which now united them for ever, not to discompose himself: that so long as his affection lasted, the defied all the ills of fortune, and every loss of fame or friendship: that no thing could make her miserable, but his seem∣ing to want happiness; nothing pleased but his sympathising with her pleasure.</P>
<P>A continuance in prison soon robbed them of the little they had left, and famine began to make its horrid appearance; yet still was neither found to murmur: they both looked upon their little boy, who, insensible of their or his own distress, was play∣ing about the room with inexpressible yet silent an∣guish, when a messenger came to inform them that
<PB N="98" REF="131"/>
<HI>Ariana</HI> was dead; and that her will, in favour of a very distant relation, and who was now in ano∣ther country, might be easily procured, and burnt; in which case, all her large fortune would revert to him, as being the next heir at law.</P>
<P>A proposal of so base a nature filled our un∣happy couple with horror; they ordered the mes∣senger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's neck, indulged an agony of sorrow: for now even all hopes of relief were ba∣nished. The messenger who made the proposal, however, was only a spy sent by <HI>Ariana</HI> to sound the dispositions of a man she loved at once and persecuted.</P>
<P>This lady, though warped by wrong passions, was naturally kind, judicious and friendly. She found that all her attempts to shake the constancy or the integrity of <HI>Sabinus</HI> were ineffectual: She had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder how she could, so long and so unprovoked, injure such uncommon fortitude and affection.</P>
<P>She had, from the next room, herself heard the reception given to the messenger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of superior virtue; she therefore reassumed her former goodness of heart; she came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the severity of her former treatment. She bestowed her first care in
<PB N="99" REF="132"/>
providing them all the necessary supplies, and acknowledged them as the most deserving heirs of her fortune. From this moment <HI>Sabinus</HI> en∣joyed an uninterrupted happiness with <HI>Olinda,</HI> and both were happy in the friendship and assist∣ance of <HI>Ariana,</HI> who, dying soon after, left them in possession of a large estate; and in her last moments confessed, that Virtue was the only path to true glory; and that, however Innocence may for a time be depressed, a steady perseverance will in time lead it to a certain victory.</P>

<P>OUR attachment to every object around us, in∣creases, in general, from the length of our ac∣quaintance with it. I would not chuse, says a <HI>French</HI> philosopher, to see an old post pulled up, with which I had been long acquainted. A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects, insen∣sibly becomes fond of seeing them; visits them from habit, and parts from them with reluctance. From hence proceeds the avarice of the old in every kind of possession. They love the world, and all that it produces; they love life, and all its advantages; not because it gives them pleasure, but because they have known it long.</P>
<P>CHINVANG the Chaste, ascending the throne of <HI>China,</HI> commanded that all who were unjustly detained in prison, during the preceding reigns,
<PB N="105" REF="138"/>
should be set free. Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occasion, there ap∣peared a majestic old man, who, falling at the em∣peror's feet, addressed him as follows: <Q REND="inline">"Great father of <HI>China,</HI> behold a wretch, now eighty-five years old, who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twenty-two. I was imprisoned, though a stranger to crime, or without being even con∣fronted by my accusers. I have now lived in soli∣tude and darkness for more than fifty years, and am grown familiar with distress. As yet dazzled with the splendour of that sun to which you have restored me, I have been wandering the streets, to find some friend that would assist, or relieve, or remember me; but my friends, my family, and relations, are all dead, and I am forgotten. Per∣mit me, then, O <HI>Chinvang,</HI> to wear out the wretch∣ed remains of life in my former prison: the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace; I have not long to live, and shall be unhappy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed; in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me."</Q></P>
<P>The old man's passion for confinement is similar to that we all have for life. We are habituated to the prison, we look round with discontent, are displeased with the abode, and yet the length of our captivity only increases our fondness for the cell. The trees we have planted, the houses we have built, or the posterity we have begotten, all

To us, who are declined in years, life appears like an old friend; its jests have been anticipated in former conversation; it has no new story to make us smile, no new improvement with which to surprise; yet still we love it: destitute of every agreement, still we love it; husband the wasting treasure with in∣creased frugality, and feel all the poignancy of anguish in the fatal separation. <BIBL>ESSAY 14.</BIBL></P>

It tells us, that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and, on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have miseries here, life is is short, and they will soon be over. Thus do these consolations destroy each other; for if life is a place of comfort, its shortness must be misery; and, if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philosophy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher strain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him∣self a heaven of happiness here; while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices, shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of Heaven. To Religion, then, we must hold, in every circum∣stance of life, for our truest comfort; for, if al∣ready we are happy, it is a pleasure to think that
<PB N="113" REF="146"/>
we can make that happiness unending; and, if we are miserable, it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest. Thus, to the fortunate, Religion holds out a continuance of bliss; to the wretched, a change from pain.</P>
<P>But, though Religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy; the sick, the naked, the houseless, the heavy-laden, and the prisoner, have ever most frequent pro∣mises in our sacred law. The Author of our Re∣ligion every where professes himself the wretch's friend; and, unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn. The un∣thinking have censured this as a partiality, as a preference without merit to deserve it; but they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing feli∣city as great a gift to the happy as to the mise∣rable. To the first, eternity is but a single bless∣ing, since, at most, it but increases what they al∣ready possess. To the latter it is a double advan∣tage; for it diminishes their pain here, and re∣wards them with heavenly bliss hereafter.</P>
<P>But Providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich; for, as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths the pas∣sage there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of sorrows
<PB N="114" REF="147"/>
lays himself quietly down; he has no possessions to regret, and but few ties to stop his departure: he feels only Nature's pang in the final separation, and this is no way greater than he has often faint∣ed under before; for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the constitution, nature kindly covers with insensi∣bility.</P>
<P>Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater fe∣licity in dying, and, in Heaven, all the superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment. And this superiority, my friends, is no small ad∣vantage, and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable; for, though he was already in Heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that he had once been wretched, and now was comforted; that he had known what it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you see Religion does what Philosophy could never do: it shews the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the unhap∣py, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard. It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal hopes to aspire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here, the poor have the end∣less
<PB N="115" REF="148"/>
satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable, when crowned with endless feli∣city hereafter; and even though this should be called a small advantage, yet, being an eternal one, it must make up, by duration, what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness.</P>
<P>These are, therefore, the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind; in other respects they are below them. They who would know the miseries of the poor, must see life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal ad∣vantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believe or practise. The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor, and they who want them must be miserable. Yes, my friends, we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a re∣fined imagination can soothe the wants of nature, can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the Philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these. Alas! the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain! Death is slight, and any man may sustain it; but torments are dreadful, and these no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us, then, my friends, the promises of hap∣piness in Heaven should be peculiarly dear; for if
<PB N="116" REF="149"/>
our reward be in this life alone, we are then, in∣deed, of all men the most miserable. When I look round these gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place, those shackles that tyranny has imposed, or crime made neces∣sary; when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans, O my friends, what a glo∣rious exchange would Heaven be for these! To fly through regions unconfined as air; to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss; to carol over endless hymns of praise; to have no master to threaten or insult us, but the form of Goodness himself for ever in our eyes; when I think of these things, Death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings; when I think of these things, his sharp∣est arrow becomes the staff of my support; when I think of these things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of these things, what is there that should not be spurned away? Kings in their palaces should groan for such ad∣vantages; but we, humbled as we are, should yearn for them.</P>
<P>And shall these things be ours? Ours they will certainly be, if we but try for them; and, what is a comfort, we are shut up from many tempta∣tions that would retard our pursuit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and, what is still a comfort, shortly too; for, if we look back on past life, it appears but a very short span; and, whatever we may think of the rest of
<PB N="117" REF="150"/>
life, it will yet be found of less duration: as we grow older, the days seem to grow shorter, and our intimacy with time ever lessens the perception of his stay. Then let us take comfort now, for we shall soon be at our journey's end; we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us; and though Death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and, like his horizon, still flies before him; yet the time will certainly and shortly come, when we shall cease from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth; when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings below; when we shall be surrounded with all our friends, or such as deserved our friend∣ship; when our bliss shall be unutterable, and still, to crown all, unending. <BIBL>VIC.

<HEAD>RIDICULE.</HEAD>
<P>RIDICULE has ever been the most powerful enemy of enthusiasm, and properly the only anta∣gonist that can be opposed to it with success. Per∣secution only serves to propagate new religions; they acquire fresh vigour beneath the executioner and the ax, and, like some vivacious insects, multi∣ply by dissection. It is also impossible to combat enthusiasm with reason; for, though it makes a shew of resistance, it soon eludes the pressure, re∣fers you to distinctions not to be understood, and feelings which it cannot explain. A man who would endeavour to fix an enthusiast by argument, might as well attempt to spread quicksilver with his singers. The only way to conquer a visionary is to despise him; the stake, the faggot, and the disputing Doctor, in some measure ennoble the opinions they are brought to oppose; they are harmless against innovating pride; contempt alone is truly dreadful. Hunters generally know the most vulnerable part of the beasts they pursue, by the care which every animal takes to defend the side which is weakest: on what side the enthusiast is most vulnerable, may be known by the care which he takes in the beginning to work his disciples into gravity, and guard them against the power of ridicule. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>STORY OF COLONEL <HI>M</HI>—.</HEAD>
<P>AT the conclusion of the treaty of peace at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Col. <HI>M</HI>— was one of the thoughtless, agreeable, gay creatures, that drew the attention of the company at <HI>Bath.</HI> He danced and talked with great vivacity; and when he gamed among the ladies, he shewed, that his attention was em∣ployed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes. His own fortune, however, was a trifle, when com∣pared to the elegance of his expence; and his im∣prudence at last was so great, that it obliged him to sell an annuity, arising from his commission, to keep up his splendour a little logger.</P>
<P>However thoughtless he might be, he had the happiness of gaining the affections of Miss <HI>L</HI>—, whose father designed her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of distinc¦tion; but she refused his addresses, resolved upon gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice.
<PB N="121" REF="154"/>
The intrigue went on successfully between her and the Colonel, and they both would certainly have been married, and been undone, had not Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> apprised her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <HI>Bath,</HI> and offered Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> a very considerable present, for the care he had taken, which he refused.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Col. <HI>M</HI>— had an intima∣tion how his intrigue came to be discovered; and by taxing Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> found that his suspicions were not without foundation. A challenge was the im∣mediate consequence; which the King of <HI>Bath,</HI> conscious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear swords at <HI>Bath,</HI> the Colonel found no opportunity of gratifying his resentment, and waited with im∣patience to find Mr. <HI>Nash</HI> in town, to require proper satisfaction.</P>
<P>During this interval, however, he found his creditors became too importunate for him to re∣main longer at <HI>Bath</HI>; and his finances and credit being quite exhausted, he took the desperate reso∣lution of going over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he enlisted himself a volunteer. Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private centinel, with the additional misery of receiving no pay; and his friends in <HI>England</HI> gave out, that he was shot at the battle of —.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="155"/>In the mean time, the nobleman pressed his pas∣sion with ardour; but, during the progress of his amour, the young lady's father died, and left her heiress to a fortune of fifteen hundred a year. She thought herself now disengaged from her former passion. An absence of two years had in some measure abated her love for the Colonel; and the assiduity, the merit, and real regard, of the gen∣tleman who still continued to solicit her, were al∣most too powerful for her constancy. Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> in the mean time, took every opportunity of en∣quiring after Col. <HI>M</HI>—, and found that he had for some time been returned to <HI>England,</HI> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his creditors; and that he was entered into a com∣pany of strolling players, who were at that time exhibiting at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>He now therefore thought he owed the Colonel, in justice, an opportunity of promoting his for∣tune, as he had once deprived him of an occasion of satisfying his love. Our Beau, therefore, in∣vited the lady to be of a party to <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and offered his own equipage, which was then one of the most elegant in <HI>England,</HI> to conduct her there. The proposal being accepted, the lady, the nobleman, and Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> arrived in town just as the players were going to begin.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>M</HI>—, who used every means of remain∣ing <HI>incognito,</HI> and who was too proud to make his

The moment he came on, his former mistress struck his view; but his amaze∣ment was increased, when he saw her fainting away in the arms of those who sat behind her. He was incapable of proceeding; and, scarce knowing what he did, he flew and caught her in his arms.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Colonel," cried <HI>Nash,</HI> when they were in some measure recovered, "you once thought me your enemy, because I endeavoured to prevent you both from ruining each other; you were then wrong, and you have long had my forgiveness.

<HEAD>MISERIES OF GENIUS IN VARIOUS AGES, AND HER HAPPINESS IN THIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of a poet is in every country the same; fond of enjoying the present, careless of the future; his conversation that of a man of sense, his actions those of a fool! Of fortitude able to stand unmoved at the bursting of an earth∣quake, yet of sensibility to be affected by the breaking of a tea-cup. Such is his character; which, considered in every light, is the very oppo∣site of that which leads to riches.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="158"/>The poets of the West are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius; and yet, among the numerous hospitals designed to relieve the poor, I have heard of but one erected for the benefit of decayed authors. This was founded by Pope <HI>Urban</HI> VIII. and called the retreat of the incurables; intimating, that it was equally impossible to re∣claim the patients, who sued for reception, from poverty, or from poetry. To be sincere; were I to send you an account of the lives of the Western poets, either ancient or modern, I fancy you would think me employed in collecting materials for an history of human wretchedness.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> is the first poet and beggar of note among the ancients; he was blind, and sung his ballads about the streets; but it is observed, that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread. <HI>Plautus,</HI> the comic poet, was better off; he had two trades, he was a poet for his diversion, and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a liveli∣hood. <HI>Terence</HI> was a slave, and <HI>Boëthius</HI> died in a jail.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Italians, Paulo Borghese,</HI> almost as good a poet as <HI>Tasso,</HI> knew fourteen different trades, and yet died because he could get employment in none. <HI>Tasso</HI> himself, who had the most amiable character of all poets, has often been obliged to borrow a crown from some friend, in order to pay for a month's subsistence. He has left us a pretty
<PB N="126" REF="159"/>
sonnet, addressed to his cat, in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by, being too poor to afford himself a candle. But <HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> poor <HI>Bentivoglio!</HI> chiefly demands our pity. His co∣medies will last with the <HI>Italian</HI> language. He dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence; but, falling into misery in his old age, was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected.</P>
<P>In <HI>Spain,</HI> it is said, the great <HI>Cervantes</HI> died of hunger; and it is certain that the famous <HI>Camoens</HI> ended his days in an hospital.</P>
<P>If we turn to <HI>France,</HI> we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the public. <HI>Vaugelas,</HI> one of the politest writers, and one of the honestest men, of his time, was surnamed <HI>the Owl,</HI> from his being obliged to keep within all day, and venture out only by night, through fear of his creditors. His last will is very remarkable: after having bequeathed all his worldly substance to the discharging his debts, he goes on thus: But as there still may remain some creditors un∣paid, even after all that I have shall be disposed of, in such a case, it is my last will, that my body should be sold to the surgeons, to the best advan∣tage, and that the purchase should go to the dis∣charging those debts which I owe to society; so that, if I could not while living, at least when dead, I may be useful.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="160"/><HI>Cassander</HI> was one of the greatest geniuses of his time; yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence. Being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind, from the little pity he found amongst them, he even ventured at last ungrate∣fully to impute his calamities to Providence. In his last agonies, when the priest intreated him to rely on the justice of heaven, and ask mercy from him that made him; <HI>If God,</HI> replies he, <HI>has shewn me no justice here, what reason have I to expect any from him hereafter?</HI> But being answered, that a suspension of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality; let me intreat you, continued his confessor, by all that is dear, to be reconciled to God, your father, your maker, and friend. <HI>No,</HI> replied the exasperated wretch, <HI>you know the manner in which he left me to live</HI>; (and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched) <HI>and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die!</HI></P>
<P>But the sufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his distresses here: the names of <HI>Spenser</HI> and <HI>Otway, Butler</HI> and <HI>Dry∣den,</HI> are every day mentioned as a national re∣proach; some of them lived in a state of precarious indigence, and others literally died of hunger.</P>
<P>At present, the few poets in <HI>England</HI> no longer depend on the Great for subsistence; they have now no other patrons but the public; and the public, collectively considered, is a good and a
<PB N="128" REF="161"/>
generous master. It is, indeed, too frequently mistaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour; but, to make amends, it is never mistaken long. A performance, indeed, may be forced for a time into reputation; but, destitute of real me∣rit, it soon sinks: time, the touchstone of what is truly valuable, will soon discover the fraud; and an author should never arrogate to himself any share of success, till his works have been read at least ten years with satisfaction.</P>
<P>A man of letters, at present, whose works are valuable, is perfectly sensible of their value. Every polite member of the community, by buying what he writes, contributes to reward him. The ridi∣cule, therefore, of living in a garret, might have been wit in the last age, but continues such no longer, because no longer true. A writer of real merit, now, may easily be rich, if his heart be set only on fortune: and for those who have no merit, it is but sit that such should remain in merited ob∣scurity. He may now refuse an invitation to din∣ner, without fearing to incur his patron's displea∣sure, or to starve by remaining at home. He may now venture to appear in company with just such clothes as other men generally wear, and talk, even to princes, with all the conscious superiority of wisdom. Though he cannot boast of fortune here, yet he can bravely assert the dignity of in∣dependance. <BIBL>CIT. OF THE WORLD, v. 2. p. 81.</BIBL></P>

If we are insensible, that arises only from an happy con∣stitution; that is a blessing previously granted by heaven, and which no art can procure, no institu∣tions improve.

They are the source of all our misfortunes, I own; but they are the source of our pleasures too: and every endeavour of our lives, and all the institutions of philosophy, should tend to this, not to dissemble an absence of passion, but to repel those which lead to vice by those which direct to virtue. <BIBL>CIT.

<P>WHETHER love be natural or no, it contri∣butes to the happiness of every society into which it is introduced.

This was the opinion of <HI>Vanini,</HI> who affirmed that <HI>every hour was lost which was not spent in love.</HI> His accusers were unable to comprehend his mean∣ing; and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames, alas! no way metaphorical. But whatever advantages the individual may reap from this pas∣sion, society will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction: all laws calculated to discou∣rage it, tend to embrute the species, and weaken the state. Though it cannot plant morals in the human breast, it cultivates them when there: pity, generosity, and honour, receive a brighter polish from its assistance; and a single amour is sufficient entirely to brush off the clown. <BIBL>CIT.

<P>The same efforts that are used in some places to suppress pity and other natural passions, may have been employed to extinguish love.

<P>THE enthusiasm of pleasure charms only by intervals. The highest rapture lasts only for a moment, and all the senses seem so combined, as to be soon tired into languor by the gratification of any one of them. It is only among the Poets
<PB N="134" REF="167"/>
we hear of men changing to one delight, when satiated with another. In nature, it is very dif∣ferent; the glutton, when sated with the full meal, is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking; the drunkard, in turn, finds few of those transports which lovers boast in enjoyment; and the lover, when cloyed, finds a diminution of every other appetite. Thus, after a full indulgence of any one sense, the man of pleasure finds a lan∣guor in all, is placed in a chasm between past and expected enjoyment, perceives an interval which must be filled up. The present can give no satis∣faction, because he has already robbed it of every charm. A mind thus left without immediate em∣ployment, naturally recurs to the past or the fu∣ture: the reflector finds that he was happy, and knows that he cannot be so now; he sees that he may yet be happy, and wishes the hour was come: thus every period of his continuance is miserable, except that very short one of immediate gratifica∣tion. Instead of a life of dissipation, none has more frequent conversations with disagreeable <HI>self</HI> than he: his enthusiasms are but few and tran∣sient; his appetites, like angry creditors, conti∣nually making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay; and the greater his former plea∣sure, the more strong his regret, the more impa∣tient his expectations. A life of pleasure is, there∣fore, the most unpleasing life in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="168"/>Habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires; he finds less regret for past pleasures, and less solicitude for those to come. The life he now leads, though tainted in some measure with hope, is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret, and is less divided between short-lived rapture and lasting anguish. The pleasures he has enjoyed are not so vivid, and those he has to expect cannot consequently create so much anxiety.</P>
<P>The philosopher, who extends his regard to all mankind, must have still a smaller concern for what has already affected, or may hereafter affect himself; the concerns of others make his whole study, and that study is his pleasure; and this pleasure is continuing in its nature, because it can be changed at will, leaving but few of these anxi∣ous intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation. The philosopher, by this means, leads a life of almost continued dissipation; and reflection, which makes the uneasiness and misery of others, serves as a companion and instructor to him.</P>
<P>In a word, positive happiness is constitutional, and incapable of increase; misery is artificial, and generally proceeds from our folly. Philosophy can add to our happiness in no other manner, but by diminishing our misery: it should not pretend to increase our present stock, but make us oeco∣nomists
<PB N="136" REF="169"/>
of what we are possessed of. The great source of calamity lies in regret or anticipation: he, therefore, is most wise, who thinks of the present alone, regardless of the past or the future. This is impossible to the man of pleasure; it is difficult to the man of business; and is, in some measure, attainable by the philosopher. Happy were we all born philosophers, all born with a talent of thus dissipating our own cares, by spread∣ing them upon all mankind! <BIBL>IBID. v. 1. p. 188.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>STUDY.</HEAD>
<P>HE who has begun his fortune by study, will certainly confirm it by perseverance. The love of books damps the passion for pleasure, and, when this passion is once extinguished, life is then cheap∣ly supported; thus a man, being possessed of more than he wants, can never be subject to great disap∣pointments, and avoids all those meannesses which indigence sometimes unavoidably produces. <BIBL>IBID. v. 2. p. 71.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>PLEASURES OF STUDY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student. The first time I read an excellent book, it is to me just as if I had gained a new friend. When I read over a book I have perused before, it resembles the meeting with an old one. We ought to lay hold of every
<PB N="137" REF="170"/>
incident in life for improvement, the trifling as well as the important. It is not one diamond alone which gives lustre to another; a common coarse stone is also employed for that purpose. Thus I ought to draw advantage from the insults and con∣tempt I meet with from a worthless fellow. His brutality ought to induce me to self-examination, and correct every blemish that may have given rise to his calumny. <BIBL>IBID. v. 2. p. 77.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>EARLY DISTASTE TO STUDY NOT TO BE CONQUERED.</HEAD>
<P>WITH all the pleasures and profits which are generally produced by learning, parents often find it difficult to induce their children to study. They often seem dragged to what wears the appearance of application. Thus being dilatory in the begin∣ning, all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off. If they find themselves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary, their pen then seems as heavy as a mill-stone, and they spend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety.</P>
<P>These persons are most at a loss when a banquet is almost over; the plate and the dice go round, that the number of little verses which each is obliged to repeat, may be determined by chance. The booby, when it comes to his turn, appears

quite stupid and insensible. The company divert themselves with his confusion; and sneers, winks, and whispers, are circulated at his expence. As for him, he opens a pair of large heavy eyes, stares at all about him, and even offers to join in the laugh, without ever considering himself as the burthen of all their good-humour. <BIBL>IBID. p. 78.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would find the Goddess of Grace, seek her not under one form, for she assumes a thou∣sand. Ever changing under the eye of inspection, her variety, rather than her figure, is pleasing. In contemplating her beauty, the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight, and, capable of fixing no where, is charmed with the whole. She is now Contemplation with solemn look, again Compassion with humid eye; she now sparkles with joy, soon every feature speaks distress: her looks at times invite our approach, at others re∣press our presumption; the Goddess cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of these forms, but by combining them all, she becomes irresistibly pleasing. <BIBL>IBID. p. 53.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>THE MERCHANT's CLERK.</HEAD>
<P>IT is usually said by grammarians, that the use of language is to express our wants and desires; but men who know the world, hold, and I think with some shew of reason, that he who best knows how to keep his necessities private, is the most likely person to have them redressed; and that the true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the manner in which man∣kind generally confer their favours, there appears something so attractive in riches, that the large heap generally collects from the smaller: and the poor find as much pleasure in increasing the enor∣mous
<PB N="140" REF="173"/>
mass of the rich, as the miser, who owns it, sees happiness in its increase. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of mora∣lity. <HI>Seneca</HI> himself allows, that in conferring benefits, the present should always be suited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large presents, and are thanked for accepting them. Men of middling stations are obliged to be content with presents something less; while the beggar, who may be truly said to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmest soli∣citations.</P>
<P>Every man who has seen the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the expression is, must have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and must know, that to have much, or to seem to have it, is the only way to have more. <HI>Ovid</HI> finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it sinks, the greater is that weight it is obliged to sustain. Thus, when a man's circumstances are such that he has no occasion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, should his wants be such that he sues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be trusted with the smallest sum. A certain young fellow, whom I knew, whenever he had occasion to ask his friend for a guinea, used to prelude his request as if he wanted two hundred; and talked so familiarly of large sums, that none could ever think he wanted a small one. The
<PB N="141" REF="174"/>
same gentleman, whenever he wanted credit for a suit of clothes, always made the proposal in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared shabby on these occasions, his tailor had taken an oath against trusting; or, what was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and should not be at home for some time.</P>
<P>There can be no inducements to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and, by this means, relief; but, before a poor man opens his mind in such circumstances, he should first consider whether he is contented to lose the esteem of the person he solicits, and whether he is willing to give up friendship to excite compassion. Pity and Friend∣ship are passions incompatible with each other; and it is impossible that both can reside in any breast for the smallest space, without impairing each other. Friendship is made up of esteem and pleasure; Pity is composed of sorrow and con∣tempt; the mind may, for some time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</P>
<P>In fact, Pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at best, a short-lived passion, and seldom af∣fords distress more than a transitory assistance: with some it scarce lasts from the first impulse till the hand can be put into the pocket; with others, it may continue for twice that space; and on some, of extraordinary sensibility, I have seen it ope∣rate
<PB N="142" REF="175"/>
for half an hour together: but still, last as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five far∣things, from others, we give pounds. Whatever be our feelings from the first impulse of distress, when the same distress solicits a second, we then feel with diminished sensibility; and, like the re∣petition of an echo, every stroke becomes weaker; 'till, at last, our sensations lose all mixture of sorrow, and degenerate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>These speculations bring to my mind the fate of a very good-natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a compting-house, and his father dying just as he was out of his time, left him an handsome fortune, and many friends to advise with. The restraint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his tem∣per, which some regarded as prudence; and, from such considerations, he had every day repeated offers of friendship. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their assistance that way; and they who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, advised him to marry. My friend, however, was in good circumstances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wife; and, there∣fore, modestly declined their proposals.</P>
<P>Some errors, however, in the management of his affairs, and several losses in trade, soon brought him to a different way of thinking; and he at
<PB N="143" REF="176"/>
last considered, that it was his best way to let his friends know that their offers were at length ac∣ceptable. His first address was to a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few lines here are borrowed, with a slight alte∣ration, from the Man of the World, p. <HI>60.</HI> of this Vol.</NOTE> scrivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friendship, at a time when, perhaps, he knew those offers would have been refused. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refused, he re∣quested the use of a hundred guineas for a few days, as he just then had occasion for money. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray, Sir, replied the scrivener, "do you want all this money?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want it, Sir?" says the other, If I did not want it, I should not have asked it."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am sorry for that," says the friend; for those who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they should come to pay. To say the truth, Sir, money is money now; and, I believe, it is all sunk in the bottom of the sea, for my part; he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</Q></P>
<P>Not quite disconcerted by this refusal, our ad∣venturer was resolved to apply to another, who he knew was the very best friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addressed, received his proposal with all the affability that could be expected from generous friendship. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me see—you want an hundred guineas—and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty answer?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you have but fifty to spare, Sir, I must be
<PB N="144" REF="177"/>
contented."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fifty to spare! I do not say that; for, I believe, I have but twenty about me."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then I must borrow the other thirty from some other friend."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray," re∣plied the friend, would it not be the best way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will serve for all, you know?—You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend; and, when you chuse a bit of dinner, or so—You, Tom! see the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble ser∣vant."</Q></P>
<P>Distressed, but not discouraged, at this treat∣ment, he was at last resolved to find that assistance from love, which he could not have from friend∣ship. A young lady, a distant relation by the mother's side, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as she had already made all the advances that her sex's modesty would permit, he made his pro∣posal with confidence. He soon, however, per∣ceived, That no bankrupt ever found the fair-one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with another, who had more money, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match.</P>
<P>Every day now began to strip my poor friend of his former finery; his clothes flew, piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he seemed, at length, equipped in the genuine livery of misfortune. But
<PB N="145" REF="178"/>
still he thought himself secure from actual neces∣sity; the numberless invitations he had received to dine, even after his losses, were yet unanswered: he was therefore now resolved to accent of a din∣ner, because he wanted one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week, without being openly affronted. The last place I saw him in, was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, just nicked the time of dinner; for he came in as the doth was laying. He took a chair without being desired, and talked for some time without being attended to. He assured the company, that nothing procured so good an appe∣tite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and praised the figure of the damask table-cloth; talked of a feast where he had been the day before, but that the venison was over-done: but all this procured him no invita∣tion. Finding, therefore, the gentleman of the house insensible to all his fetches, he thought pro∣per, at last, to retire, and mend his appetite by a second walk in the Park.</P>
<P>You, then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in <HI>Kent-street</HI> or the <HI>Mall</HI>; whether at the <HI>Smyrna</HI> or St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s; might I be permitted to advise as a friend, never seem to want the favour which you solicit. Apply to every passion but human pity for redress: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from self-interest, or from avarice; but from compassion
<PB N="146" REF="179"/>
never. The very eloquence of a poor man is dis∣gusting; and that mouth, which is opened even by wisdom, is seldom expected to close without the horrors of a petition.</P>
<P>To ward off the gripe of poverty, you must pretend to be a stranger to her, and she will at least use you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of pease-soup and potatoes, praise the wholesomeness of your frugal repast: you may observe that Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> has prescribed pease-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of those who are always making a deity of your belly. If, again, you are obliged to wear flimsy stuff in the midst of winter, be the first to remark, that stuffs are very much worn at <HI>Paris</HI>; or, if there be found some irrepa∣rable defects in any part of your equipage, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of sitting cross-legged, coaxing, or darning, say, that neither you nor <HI>Sampson Gideon</HI> were ever very fond of dress. If you be a philosopher, hint that <HI>Plato</HI> or <HI>Seneca</HI> are the taylors you choose to employ; assure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering; since what now is so much his pride, was formerly his shame. In short, however caught, never give out; but ascribe to the frugality of your disposition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowness of your circumstances. To be poor, and to seem poor, is a certain method never to rise: pride in the great is hateful; in the wise,

<HEAD>THE DISABLED SOLDIER.</HEAD>
<P>NO observation is more common, and at the same time more true, than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declama∣tion; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers: the great, under the pressure of calamity, are conscious of several others sympa∣thizing with their distress; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing mis∣fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in such circumstances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of obscurity, can brave adversity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his mis∣fortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indif∣ference, is truly great: whether peasant or cour∣tier, he deserves admiration, and should be held up for our imitation and respect.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="181"/>While the slightest inconveniences of the great are magnified into calamities, while Tragedy mouths out their sufferings in all the strains of eloquence, the miseries of the poor are entirely disregarded; and yet some of the lower ranks of people under∣go more real hardships in one day, than those of a more exalted station suffer in their whole lives. It is inconceivable what difficulties the meanest of our common sailors and soldiers endure, without mur∣muring or regret; without passionately declaiming against providence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity. Every day is to them a day of misery, and yet they entertain their hard fate without repining.</P>
<P>With what indignation do I hear an <HI>Ovid,</HI> a <HI>Cicero,</HI> or a <HI>Rabutin,</HI> complain of their misfor∣tunes and hardships; whose greatest calamity was that of being unable to visit a certain spot of earth, to which they had foolishly attached an idea of happiness! Their distresses were pleasures, com∣pared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring. They ate, drank, and slept; they had slaves to attend them, and were sure of subsistence for life: while many of their fellow-creatures are obliged to wander with∣out a friend to comfort or assist them, and even without shelter from the severity of the season.</P>
<P>I have been led into these reflections, from ac∣cidentally meeting, some days ago, a poor fellow,
<PB N="149" REF="182"/>
whom I knew when a boy, dressed in a sailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been honest and industrious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I desired to know the his∣tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress. The disabled soldier, for such he was, though dressed in a sailor's habit, scratching his head, and leaning on his crutch, put himself into an attitude to comply with my request, and gave me his history, as follows.</P>
<P>"AS for my misfortune, master, I can't pre∣tend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the loss of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any reason, thank Heaven, that I have to complain; there is <HI>Bill Tibbs,</HI> of our regiment, he has lost both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank Heaven, it is not so bad with me yet.</P>
<P>"I was born in <HI>Shropshire</HI>; my father was a la∣bourer, and died when I was five years old; so I was put upon the parish. As he had been a wan∣dering sort of a man, the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged, or where I was born; so they sent me to another parish, and that parish sent me to a third. I thought in my
<PB N="150" REF="183"/>
heart, they kept sending me about so long, that they would not let me be born in any parish at all; but, at last, however, they fixed me. I had some disposition to be a scholar, and was resolved, at least, to know my letters; but the master of the work-house put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an easy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not suffered to stir out of the house, for fear, as they said, I should run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole house, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu∣siness well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for myself; so I was resolved to go seek my fortune.</P>
<P>"In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and starved when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace, I spied a hare crossing the path just before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the justice himself met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and, collaring me, desired I would give an account of myself. I fell upon my knees,
<PB N="151" REF="184"/>
begged his worship's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, seed, and generation; but, though I gave a very true account, the justice said I could give no account; so I was indicted at the sessions, found guilty of being poor, and sent up to <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to be transported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>"People may say this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found <HI>Newgate</HI> as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to last for ever; so I was taken out of prison, after five months, put on board a ship, and sent off, with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent passage; for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of sweet air; and those that remain¦ed were sickly enough, God knows. When we came a-shore, we were sold to the planters, and I was bound for seven years more. As I was no scholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I served out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>"When my time was expired, I worked my passage home; and glad I was to see <HI>Old England</HI> again, because I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more, so did not much care to go down into
<PB N="152" REF="185"/>
the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</P>
<P>"I was very happy in this manner for some time; till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then desired me to stand. They belonged to a press-gang. I was carried before the justice, and, as I could give no account of myself, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or list for a soldier. I chose the latter; and, in this post of a gentle∣man, I served two campaigns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was at the battles of <HI>Val</HI> and <HI>Fontency,</HI> and received but one wound, through the breast here; but the doc∣tor of our regiment soon made me well again.</P>
<P>"When the peace came on, I was discharged; and, as I could not work, because my wound was sometimes troublesome, I listed for a landman in the <HI>East-India</HI> company's service. I have fought the <HI>French</HI> in six pitched battles; and I verily be∣lieve, that, if I could read or write, our Captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I soon fell sick, and so got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the present war, and I hoped to be set on shore, and to have the pleasure of spending my money; but the government wanted men, and so I was pressed for a sailor be∣fore ever I could set foot on shore.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="186"/>"The boatswain found, as he said, an obsti∣nate fellow: he swore he knew that I understood my business well, but that I shammed <HI>Abraham,</HI> to be idle; but God knows, I knew nothing of sea-business, and he beat me without considering what he was about. I had still, however, my forty pounds, and that was some comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ship was taken by the French, and so I lost all.</P>
<P>"Our crew was carried into <HI>Brest,</HI> and many of them died, because they were not used to live in jail; but, for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was seasoned. One night, as I was asleep on my bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awakened by the boatswain, who had a dark lantern in his hand. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Jack,</HI> says he to me, will you knock out the <HI>French</HI> centry's brains?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't care, says I, striving to keep myself awake, if I lend a hand."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then follow me," says he, "and I hope we shall do business."</Q> So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the clothes I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the <HI>Frenchman.</HI> I hate the <HI>French,</HI> because they are all slaves, and wear wooden shoes.</P>
<P>"Though we had no arms, one <HI>Englishman</HI> is able to beat five <HI>French</HI> at any time; so we went down to the door, where both the centries were
<PB N="154" REF="187"/>
posted, and, rushing upon them, seized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and seizing the first boat we met, got out of the har∣bour, and put to sea. We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the <HI>Dorset</HI> privateer, who were glad of so many good hands; and we consented to run our chance. However, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the <HI>Pompadour</HI> privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty-three; so to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight lasted for three hours, and I verily believe we should have taken the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> had we but had some more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory.</P>
<P>"I was once more in the power of the <HI>French,</HI> and, I believe, it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to <HI>Brest</HI>; but, by good for∣tune, we were retaken by the Viper. I had almost forgot to tell you, that, in that engagement, I was wounded in two places: I lost four fingers off the left hand, and my leg was shot off. If I had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king's ship, and not a∣board a privateer, I should have been intitled to clothing and maintenance during the rest of my life; but that was not my chance: one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and ano∣ther

with a wooden ladle. However, blessed be God! I enjoy good health, and will, for ever, love liberty and Old England. Liberty, property, and Old England, for ever, huzza!</P>

<P>DISAPPOINTED love makes the misery of youth; disappointed ambition, that of manhood; and successful avarice, that of age.

<HEAD>THE PHILOSOPHIC COBLER.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH not very fond of seeing a pageant myself, yet I am generally pleased with being in the crowd which sees it; it is amusing to observe
<PB N="157" REF="190"/>
the effect which such a spectacle has upon the va∣riety of faces; the pleasure it excites in some, the envy in others, and the wishes it raises in all. With this design I lately went to see the entry of a foreign ambassador, resolved to make one in the mob, to shout as they shouted, to fix with ear∣nestness upon the same frivolous objects, and par∣ticipate, for a while, the pleasures and the wishes of the vulgar.</P>
<P>Struggling here for some time, in order to be first to see the cavalcade as it passed, some one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my shoe, and tore it in such a manner, that I was ut∣terly unqualified to march forward with the main body, and obliged to fall back in the rear. Thus rendered incapable of being a spectator of the shew myself, I was at least willing to observe the spectators, and limped behind like one of the in∣valids which follow the march of an army.</P>
<P>In this plight, as I was considering the eager∣ness that appeared on every face, how some bustled to get foremost, and others contented themselves with taking a transient peep when they could; how some praised the four black servants that were stuck behind one of the equipages, and some the ribbons that decorated the horses' necks in another; my attention was called off to an object more extraordinary than any that I had yet seen: A poor Cobler sat in his stall by the way-side, and
<PB N="158" REF="191"/>
continued to work while the crowd passed by, without testifying the smallest share of curiosity. I own his want of attention excited mine; and, as I stood in need of his assistance, I thought it best to employ a Philosophic Cobler on this occa∣sion: perceiving my business, therefore, he de∣sired me to enter and sit down, took my shoe in his lap, and began to mend it with his usual in∣difference and taciturnity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How, my friend," said I to him, can you continue to work while all those fine things are passing by your door?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Very fine they are, master, returned the cobler, for those that like them, to be sure; but what are all those fine things to me? You don't know what it is to be a cobler, and so much the better for your∣self. Your bread is baked; you may go and see sights the whole day, and eat a warm sup∣per when you come home at night; but for me, if I should run hunting after all these fine folk, what should I get by my journey but an appe∣tite? and, God help me, I have too much of that at home already, without stirring out for it. Your people who may eat four meals a day, and supper at night, are but a bad example to such a one as I. No, master, as God has call∣ed me into this world in order to mend old shoes, I have no business with fine folk, and they no business with me."</Q> I here interrupted him with a smile. <Q REND="inline">"See this last, master," con∣tinues he, and this hammer; this last and ham∣mer
<PB N="159" REF="192"/>
are the two best friends I have in this world; nobody else will be my friend, because I want a friend. The great folks you saw pass by just now have five hundred friends, because they have no occasion for them. Now, while I stick to my good friends here, I am very con∣tented; but, when I ever so little run after sights and fine things, I begin to hate my work, I grow sad, and have no heart to mend shoes any longer."</Q></P>
<P>This discourse only served to raise my curiosity to know more of a man whom Nature had thus formed into a Philosopher. I therefore insensi∣bly led him into an history of his adventures:— <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have lived, said he, a wandering life, now five-and-fifty years, here to-day and gone to∣morrow; for it was my misfortune, when I was young, to be fond of changing."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have been a traveller, then, I presume?"</Q> inter∣rupted I. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can't boast much of travelling," continued he, for I have never left the parish in which I was born but three times in my life, that I can remember; but then there is not a street in the whole neighbourhood that I have not lived in, at some time or another. When I began to settle, and to take to my busi∣ness in one street, some unforeseen misfortune, or a desire of trying my luck elsewhere, has re∣moved me, perhaps, a whole mile away from my former customers, while some more lucky cob∣ler would come into my place, and make a
<PB N="160" REF="193"/>
handsome fortune among friends of my making: there was one who actually died in a stall that I had left, worth seven pounds seven shillings, all in hard gold, which he had quilted into the waistband of his breeches."</Q></P>
<P>I could not but smile at these migrations of a man by the fire-side, and continued to ask if he had ever been married. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, that I have, mas∣ter replied he, for sixteen long years; and a weary life I had of it, Heaven knows. My wife took it into her head, that the only way to thrive in this world was to save money; so, though our comings-in was but about three shillings a week, all that ever she could lay her hands upon she used to hide away from me, though we were obliged to starve the whole week for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The first three years we used to quarrel about this every day, and I always got the better; but she had a hard spirit, and still continued to hide as usual; so that I was at last tired of quarrelling, and getting the better; and she scraped and scraped at pleasure, 'till I was almost starved to death. Her conduct drove me, at last, in de∣spair to the alehouse; here I used to sit with people who hated home like myself, drank while I had money left, and run in score while any body would trust me; 'till at last the landlady, coming one day with a long bill when I was from home, and putting it into my wife's hands,
<PB N="161" REF="194"/>
the length of it effectually broke her heart. I searched the whole stall, after she was dead, for money; but she had hidden it so effectually, that, with all my pains, I could never find a farthing."</Q></P>
<P>By this time my shoe was mended, and, satisfy∣ing the poor artist for his trouble, and rewarding him besides for his information, I took my leave, and returned home to lengthen out the amusement his conversation afforded, by communicating it to my friend. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>CHARITY OF THE <HI>ENGLISH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILE I sometimes lament the cause of hu∣manity, and the depravity of human nature, there now and then appear gleams of greatness that serve to relieve the eye oppressed with the hideous prospect, and resemble those cultivated spots that are sometimes found in the midst of an Asiatic wilderness. I see many superior excellencies among the <HI>English,</HI> which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide: I see virtues which, in other countries, are known only to a few, practised here by every rank of people.</P>
<P>I know not whether it proceeds from their su∣perior opulence, that the <HI>English</HI> are more chari∣table than the rest of mankind; whether, by being possessed of all the conveniencies of life them∣selves, they have more leisure to perceive the un∣easy
<PB N="162" REF="195"/>
situation of the distressed; whatever be the motive, they are not only the most charitable of any other nation, but most judicious in distin∣guishing the properest objects of compassion.</P>
<P>In other countries, the giver is generally influ∣enced by the immediate impulse of pity; his ge∣nerosity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneasy sensations, as to comfort the object in di∣stress: in <HI>England,</HI> benefactions are of a more ge∣neral nature; some men of fortune and universal benevolence propose the proper objects; the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvassed by the people; neither passion nor pity find a place in the cool discussion; and charity is then only exerted, when it has received the approbation of reason. <BIBL>IBID. p. 86.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>THE COMMON <HI>ENGLISH</HI> STRANGERS TO URBANITY; WITH REMARKS ON THEIR PROWESS IN DIFFI∣CULTIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE poor of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness; their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity; and, perhaps too, they give but little commiseration, as they find but little from others. But, in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> the poor treat each other, upon every occa∣sion, with more than savage animosity, and as if they were in a state of open war by nature. In <HI>China,</HI> if two porters should meet in a narrow
<PB N="163" REF="196"/>
street, they would lay down their burthens, make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interruption, and beg pardon on their knees. If two men of the same occupation should meet here, they would first begin to scold, and, at last, to beat each other. One would think they had mi∣series enough resulting from penury and labour, not to increase them by ill-nature among them∣selves, and subjection to new penalties; but such considerations never weigh with them.</P>
<P>But to recompense this strange absurdity, they are, in the main, generous, brave, and enterprising. They feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience, but resist the greatest ca∣lamities with surprising fortitude. Those miseries under which any other people in the world would sink, they have often shewed they were capable of enduring: if accidently cast upon some desolate coast, their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining; if imprisoned for crimes, their efforts to escape are greater than among others. The peculiar strength of their prisons, when compared to those elsewhere, argues their hardiness; even the strongest prisons I have ever seen in other countries, would be very insufficient to confine the untameable spirit of an <HI>Englishman.</HI> In short, what man dares do in circumstances of danger, an <HI>Englishman</HI> will.

In every other country, robbery and murder go almost always together; here it seldom happens, except upon ill-judged resistance or pursuit. The banditti of other coun∣tries are unmerciful to a supreme degree; the highwayman and robber here are generous at least to the public, and pretend even to virtues in their intercourse among each other.

<HEAD>HAPPINESS EVER REPUGNANT TO OUR WISHES.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress. The wandering beggar, who has none to protect, to feed, or to shelter him, fancies com∣plete happiness in labour and a full meal. Take him from rags and want, feed, clothe, and employ him, his wishes now rise one step above his station; he could be happy were he possessed of raiment, food, and ease. Suppose his wishes gratified even in these, his prospects widen as he ascends: he finds himself in affluence and tranquillity indeed; but indolence soon breeds anxiety, and he desires not only to be freed from pain, but to be possessed of pleasure: pleasure is granted him; and this but opens his soul to ambition; and ambition will

be sure to taint his future happiness, either with jealousy, disappointment, or fatigue.</P>
<P>But of all the arts of distress found out by man, for his own torment, perhaps that of philosophic misery is most truly ridiculous; a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">England.</NOTE> coun∣try where I now reside.

<HEAD>LEGISLATIVE POWER.</HEAD>
<P>IT were highly to be wished, that legislative power would direct the law rather to reforma∣tion than severity; that it would appear con∣vinced, that the work of eradicating crimes, is not by making punishments familiar, but formidable. Instead of our present prisons, which find or make men guilty, which inclose wretches for the com∣mission of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thousands, it were to be wished we had, as in other parts of
<PB N="167" REF="200"/>
<HI>Europe,</HI> places of penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives of virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increas∣ing punishments, is the way to mend a state: nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right, which social combinations have assumed, of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature. In cases of murder, their right is obvious; as it is the duty of us all, from the law of self-defence, to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another. Against such, all nature rises in arms; but it is not so against him who steals my property. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine. If, then, I have any right, it must be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die. But this is a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away; as it is not his own. And, next, the compact is inadequate, and would be set aside, even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience; since it is far better that two men should live, than that one man should ride. But a compact that is false between two men, is equally so be∣tween an hundred, or an hundred thousand; for as ten millions of circles can never make a square, so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood. It is thus that
<PB N="168" REF="201"/>
Reason speaks; and untutored Nature says the same thing. Savages, that are directed nearly by natural law alone, are very tender of the lives of each other; they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Saxon</HI> ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature still strong upon them, scarce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P>It is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age; and, as if our possessions were become dearer in proportion as they increased, as if the more enormous our wealth the more extensive our fears, our possessions are paled with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to scare every in∣vader.</P>
<P>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiousness of our people, that this country should shew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Perhaps it is owing to both; for they mutually produce each other. When by indiscriminate penal laws a na∣tion beholds the same punishment affixed to dissi∣milar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no distinc∣tion
<PB N="169" REF="202"/>
in the penalty, the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime, and this distinc∣tion is the bulwark of all morality: thus the mul∣titude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for fresh restraints.</P>
<P>It were to be wished, then, that power, instead of contriving new laws to punish vice, instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a convul∣sion come to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches as useless, before we have tried their uti∣lity, instead of converting correction into ven∣geance, it were to be wished, that we tried the restrictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the people. We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we should then find that wretches, now stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury should feel a mo∣mentary pang, might, if properly treated, serve to sinew the state in times of danger; that, as their faces are like ours, their hearts are so too; that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend; that a man may see his last crime without dying for it; and that very little blood will serve to cement our security. <BIBL>VIC.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>DEATH is not that terrible thing which we suppose it to be; it is a spectre which frights us at a distance, but which disappears when we come to approach it more closely. Our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dressed up by fancy; we regard it not only as the greatest misfortune, but also as an evil accompanied with the most ex∣cruciating tortures: we have even increased our apprehensions, by reasoning on the extent of our sufferings. It must be dreadful, say some, since it is sufficient to separate the soul from the body; it must be long, since our sufferings are proportioned to the succession of our ideas; and these being painful, must succeed each other with extreme ra∣pidity. In this manner has false philosophy la∣boured to augment the miseries of our nature, and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with insensibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can suffer these calamities; the mind is, at that time, mostly without ideas; and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain produces either death, or fainting, which is a state similar to death: the body can suffer but to a certain de∣gree; if the torture becomes excessive, it destroys itself; and the mind ceases to perceive, when the body can no longer endure.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="204"/>In this manner, excessive pain admits of no re∣flection; and, wherever there are any signs of it, we may be sure that the sufferings of the patient are no greater than what we ourselves may have re∣membered to endure.</P>
<P>But, in the article of death, we have many in∣stances in which the dying person has shewn that very reflection which pre-supposes an absence of the greatest pain; and, consequently, that pang which ends life cannot even be so great as those which have preceded. Thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> XII. was shot at the siege of <HI>Frederickshall,</HI> he was seen to clap his hand on the hilt of his sword; and, although the blow was great enough to ter∣minate one of the boldest and bravest lives in the world, yet it was not painful enough to destroy reflection. He perceived himself attacked; he reflected that he ought to defend himself, and his body obeyed the impulse of his mind, even in the last extremity. Thus it is the prejudice of per∣sons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us suffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, contracted an habit of making out excessive pleasures and pains; and nothing but repeated experience shews us how seldom the one can be suffered, or the other enjoyed, to the utmost. If there be any thing necessary to con∣firm what we have said concerning the gradual cessation of life, or the insensible approaches of our end, nothing can more effectually prove it
<PB N="172" REF="205"/>
than the uncertainty of the signs of death. If we consult what <HI>Winslow</HI> or <HI>Bruhier</HI> have said upon this subject, we shall be convinced, that between life and death, the shade is so very undistinguish∣able, that even all the powers of art can scarcely determine where the one ends, and the other be∣gins. The colour of the visage, the warmth of the body, the suppleness of the joints, are but un∣certain signs of life still subsisting; while, on the contrary, the paleness of the complexion, the coldness of the body, the stiffness of the extremi∣ties, the cessation of all motion, and the total in∣sensibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the same manner, also, with regard to the pulse, and the breathing, these mo∣tions are often so kept under, that it is impossible to perceive them. By approaching a looking-glass to the mouth of the person supposed to be dead, people often expect to find whether he breathes or not; but this is a very uncertain ex∣periment: the glass is frequently sullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the person is still alive, although the glass is no way tarnished. In the same manner, neither burning, nor scarifying; neither noises in the ears, nor pungent spirits applied to the nostrils, give certain signs of the discontinuance of life; and there are many in∣stances of persons who have endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external assist∣ance, to the astonishment of the spectators. How careful, therefore, should we be, before we commit
<PB N="173" REF="206"/>
those who are dearest to us to the grave, to be well assured of their departure!—Experience, justice, humanity, all persuade us not to hasten the fune∣rals of our friends, but to keep their bodies un∣buried, until we have certain signs of their real decease. <BIBL>HIST.

<P>I AM fond of amusement, in whatever company it is to be found; and wit, though dressed in rags, is ever pleasing to me. I went some days ago to take a walk in <HI>St. James's Park,</HI> about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner. There were but few in the walks, and those who staid, seemed, by their locks, rather more willing to for∣get that they had an appetite than gain one. I sat down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was seated a man in very shabby clothes.</P>
<P>We continued to groan, to hem, and to cough, as usual upon such occasions; and, at last, ven∣tured upon conversation. <Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon, Sir," cried I, "but I think I have seen you before; your face is familiar to me."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir," re∣plied he, "I have a good familiar face, as my friends tell me. I am as well known in every town in <HI>England</HI> as the dromedary, or live croco∣dile.
<PB N="175" REF="208"/>
You must understand, Sir, that I have been these sixteen years <HI>Merry Andrew</HI> to a puppet-show; last <HI>Bartholomew</HI> fair my master and I quar∣relled, beat each other, and parted; he to sell his puppets to the pincushion-makers in <HI>Rosemary∣lane,</HI> and I to starve in <HI>St. James's Park.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am sorry, Sir, that a person of your ap∣pearance should labour under any difficulties."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"O, Sir," returned he, "my appearance is very much at your service; but, though I cannot boast of eating much, yet there are few that are merrier: if I had twenty thousand a year, I should be very merry; and, thank the Fates, though not worth a groat, I am very merry still. If I have three-pence in my pocket, I never refuse to be my three-halfpence; and, if I have no money, I never scorn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay my reckoning. What think you, Sir, of a steak and a tankard? You shall treat me now, and I will treat you again when I find you in the <HI>Park</HI> in love with eating, and without money to pay for a dinner."</Q></P>
<P>As I never refuse a small expence for the sake of a merry companion, we instantly adjourned to a neighbouring alehouse; and, in a few moments, had a frothing tankard, and a smoaking steak, spread on the table before us. It is impossible to express how much the sight of such good cheer improved my companion's vivacity. <Q REND="inline">"I like this
<PB N="176" REF="209"/>
dinner, Sir," says he, for three reasons: first, because I am naturally fond of beef; secondly, because I am hungry; and, thirdly and lastly, because I get it for nothing: no meat eats so sweet as that for which we do not pay."</Q></P>
<P>He therefore now fell to, and his appetite seemed to correspond with his inclination. After dinner was over, he observed that the steak was tough; <Q REND="inline">"and yet, Sir," returns he, "bad as it was, it seemed a rump-steak to me. O the de∣lights of poverty and a good appetite! We beg∣gars are the very foundlings of Nature: the rich she treats like an errant step-mother; they are pleased with nothing: cut a steak from what part you will, and it is insupportably tough; dress it up with pickles,—even pickles cannot procure them an appetite.

If an inundation sweeps away half the grounds of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I am content; I have no lands there: if the stocks sink, that gives me no uneasiness; I am no <HI>Jew.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The fellow's vivacity, joined to his poverty, I own, raised my curiosity to know something of his life and circumstances; and I intreated, that he would indulge my desire.—<Q REND="inline">"That I will, Sir,"

As I was their only child, my father designed to breed me up to his own employment, which was that of drummer to a puppet-shew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to <HI>Punch</HI> and King <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of instructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great progress, because I naturally had no ear for music; so, at the age of fifteen, I went and listed for a soldier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, so I soon found that I disliked carrying a musket also; neither the one trade nor the other were to my taste, for I was by nature fond of being a gentleman: besides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, I have mine, and you have yours: now I very reasonably con∣cluded, that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="211"/>"The life of a soldier soon therefore gave me the spleen: I asked leave to quit the service; but, as I was tall and strong, my captain thanked me for my kind intention, and said, because he had a regard for me, we should not part. I wrote to my father a very dismal penitent letter, and desired that he would raise money to pay for my discharge; but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was (Sir, my service to you), and those who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's discharges: in short, he never answered my letter. What could be done? If I have not moneys, said I to myself, to pay for my discharge, I must find an equivalent some other way; and that must be by running away. I deserted, and that answered my purpose every bit as well as if I had bought my discharge.</P>
<P>"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment: I sold my soldier's clothes, bought worse, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the most unfrequented roads possible. One evening, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the parish, thrown from his horse in a miry road, and almost smothered in the mud. He desired my as∣sistance; I gave it, and drew him out with some difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going off; but I followed him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate asked an hundred questions; as, whose son I was; from whence I came; and whe∣ther
<PB N="179" REF="212"/>
I would be faithful? I answered him greatly to his satisfaction; and gave myself one of the best characters in the world for sobriety (Sir, I have the honour of drinking your health), discretion, and fidelity. To make a long story short, he wanted a servant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other: I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat; I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-servant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to starve me between them, I made a pious resolution to prevent their committing murder: I stole the eggs as soon as they were laid; I emptied every unfinished bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was sure to disappear: in short, they found I would not do; so I was discharged one morning, and paid three shillings and six∣pence for two months wages.</P>
<P>"While my money was getting ready, I em∣ployed myself in making preparations for my de∣parture: two hens were hatching in an outhouse; I went and habitually took the eggs, and, not to separate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knapsack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my money; and, with my knapsack on my back, and a staff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the house, when I heard behind me the cry of Stop
<PB N="180" REF="213"/>
thief! but this only increased my dispatch; it would have been foolish to stop, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. But hold—I think I passed those two months at the curate's without drinking. Come, the times are dry; and may this be my poison, if ever I spent two more pious, stupid months in all my life!</P>
<P>"Well, after travelling some days, whom should I light upon but a company of strolling players? The moment I saw them at a distance, my heart warmed to them; I had a sort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order: they were employed in settling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way. I offered my assistance, which they accepted; and we soon became so well acquainted, that they took me as a servant. This was a paradise to me; they sung, danced, drank, eat, and travelled, all at the same time. By the blood of the <HI>Mirabels,</HI> I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laughed at every word that was spoken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure, as you see; and, though I was poor, I was not modest.</P>
<P>"I love a straggling life above all things in the world; sometimes good, sometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when (the tankard is out) it stands before me. We arrived that evening at
<PB N="181" REF="214"/>
<HI>Tenterden,</HI> and took a large room at the <HI>Greyhound</HI>; where we resolved to exhibit <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> with the funeral procession, the grave and the garden scene. <HI>Romeo</HI> was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane; Juliet</HI> by a lady who never appeared on any stage before; and I was to snuff the candles: all excel∣lent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dress them. The same coat that served <HI>Romeo,</HI> turned with the blue lining outwards, served for his friend <HI>Mercutio:</HI> a large piece of crape sufficed at once for <HI>Juliet</HI>'s petticoat and pall: a pestle and mortar, from a neighbouring apothecary's, answered all the purposes of a bell; and our landlord's own family, wrapped in white sheets, served to fill up the procession. In short, there were but three figures among us that might be said to be dressed with any propriety: I mean the nurse, the starved apothecary, and myself. Our performance gave universal satisfaction: the whole audience were enchanted with our powers; and <HI>Tenterden</HI> is a town of taste.</P>
<P>"There is one rule by which a strolling-player may be ever secure of success; that is, in our the∣atrical way of expressing it, to make a great deal of the character. To speak and act as in common life, is not playing; nor is it what people come to see: natural speaking, like sweet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and scarce leaves any taste behind it; but being high in a part resembles vinegar,
<PB N="182" REF="215"/>
which grates upon the taste, and one feels it while he is drinking. To please the town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the emphasis, slap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling sickness: that is the way to work for applause, that is the way to gain it.</P>
<P>"As we received much reputation for our skill on this first exhibition, it was but natural for me to ascribe part of the success to myself: I snuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-snuffer, the piece would lose half its em∣bellishments. In this manner we continued a fort∣night, and drew tolerable houses; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very best piece, in which all our strength was to be exerted. We had great expectations from this, and even doubled our prices; when, behold, one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a stroke like thunder to our little com∣pany: they were resolved to go, in a body, to scold the man for falling sick at so inconvenient a time, and that, too, of a disorder that threatened to be expensive: I seized the moment, and offered to act the part myself in his stead. The case was despe∣rate; they accepted my offer; and I accordingly sat down, with the part in my hand and a tankard before me (Sir, your health), and studied the cha∣racter, which was to be rehearsed the next day, and played soon after.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="216"/>"I found my memory excessively helped by drinking: I learned my part with astonishing ra∣pidity, and bid adieu to snuffing candles ever after. I found that Nature had designed me for more noble employments, and I was resolved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehearse, and I informed, my compa∣nions, masters now no longer, of the surprising change I felt within me. Let the sick man, said I, be under no uneasiness to get well again; I'll fill his place to universal satisfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I'll engage that he shall never be missed. I rehearsed before them, strutted, ranted, and received applause. They soon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear, and immediately all the genteel places were bespoke. Before I ascended the stage, how∣ever, I concluded within myself, that, as I brought money to the house, I ought to have my share in the profits. Gentlemen, said I, addressing our company, I don't pretend to direct you; far be it from me to treat you with so much, ingratitude: you have published my name in the bills, with the utmost good-nature; and, as affairs stand, cannot act without me: so, gentlemen, to shew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwise I declare off; I'll brandish my snuffers, and clip candles as usual. This was a very disagreeable proposal; but they found that it was impossible to refuse it; it was ir∣resistible, it was adamant: they consented, and I
<PB N="184" REF="217"/>
went on in king <HI>Bajazet.</HI> My frowning brows, bound with a stocking stuffed into a turban, while on my captiv'd arms I brandished a jack-chain. Nature seemed to have fitted me for the part; I was tall, and had a loud voice; my very entrance excited universal applause; I looked round on the audience with a smile, and made a most low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very passionate part, I invigorated my spirits with three full glasses (the tankard is al∣most out) of brandy. By <HI>Alla!</HI> it is almost in∣conceivable how I went through it; <HI>Tamerlane</HI> was but a fool to me; though he was sometimes loud enough too, yet I was still louder than he: but then, besides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded up thus, upon the pit of my stomach; it is the way at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and has always a fine effect. The tankard would sink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits: in short, I came off like a prodigy; and such was my success, that I could ravish the laurels even from a sirloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over, to compli∣ment me upon my success; one praised my voice, another my person: Upon my word, says the 'squire's lady, he will make one of the finest ac∣tors in <HI>Europe</HI>; I say it, and I think I am some∣thing of a judge.—Praise in the beginning is agreeable enough, and we receive it as a favour; but, when it comes in great quantities, we regard
<PB N="185" REF="218"/>
it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: instead of thanking them, I inter∣nally applauded myself. We were desired to give our piece a second time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</P>
<P>"At last we left the town, in order to be at a horse-race at some distance from thence. I shall never think of <HI>Tenterden</HI> without tears of grati∣tude and respect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. Come, let us drink their healths, if you please, Sir. We quitted the town, I say; and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out: I entered the town a candle-snuffer, and I quitted it an hero!—Such is the world! little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could say a great deal more upon that subject; something truly sublime upon the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give us both the spleen, and so I shall pass it over.</P>
<P>"The races were ended before we arrived at the next town, which was no small disappointment to our company; however, we were resolved to take all we could get. I played capital charac∣ters there too, and came off with my usual bril∣liancy. I sincerely believe I should have been the first actor of <HI>Europe,</HI> had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly frost which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me
<PB N="186" REF="219"/>
once more down to the common standard of hu∣manity. I played Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI>; all the country ladies were charmed: if I but drew out my snuff-box, the whole house was in a roar of rapture; when I exercised my cudgel, I thought they would have fallen into convulsions.</P>
<P>There was here a lady who had received an edu∣cation of nine months in <HI>London</HI>; and this gave her pretensions to taste, which rendered her the indisputable mistress of the ceremonies wherever she came. She was informed of my merits; every body praised me; yet she refused at first going to see me perform: she could not conceive, she said, any thing but stuff from a stroller; talked something in praise of <HI>Garrick,</HI> and amazed the ladies with her skill in enunciations, tones, and ca∣dences. She was at last, however, prevailed upon to go; and it was privately intimated to me what a judge was to be present at my next exhibition: however, no way intimidated, I came on in Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> one hand stuck in my breeches, and the other in my bosom, as usual at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>; but, instead of looking at me, I perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in <HI>London</HI>; from her they expected the decision which was to secure the ge∣neral's truncheon in my hand, or sink me down into a theatrical letter-carrier. I opened my snuff-box, took snuff—the lady was solemn, and so were the rest. I broke the cudgel on alderman Smug∣gler's
<PB N="187" REF="220"/>
back—still gloomy, melancholy all; the lady groaned and shrugged her shoulders. I at∣tempted, by laughing myself, to excite at least a smile;—but the devil a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into sympathy: I found it would not do; all my good-humour now became forced; my laughter was converted into hysteric grinning; and, while I pretended spirits, my eye shewed the agony of my heart. In short, the lady came with an intention to be displeased, and displeased she was; my fame expired; I am here, and—(the tan∣kard is no more!".) <BIBL>ESSAY 21.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>CONTEMPLATION OF CELESTIAL MAGNIFICENCE.</HEAD>
<P>AN use, hitherto not much insisted upon, that may result from the contemplation of celestial magnificence, is, that it will teach us to make an allowance for the apparent irregularities we find below.

The hea∣vens present us with a plan, which, though in∣expressibly magnificent, is yet regular beyond the power of invention. Whenever, therefore, we

find any apparent defects in the earth, which we are about to consider, instead of attempting to reason ourselves into an opinion that they are beautiful, it will be wise to say, that we do not behold them at the proper point of distance, and that our eye is laid too close to the objects to take in the regularity of their connexion.

<HEAD><HI>ASEM,</HI> THE MAN-HATER.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE <HI>Tauris</HI> lifts its head above the storm, and presents nothing to the sight of the distant traveller, but a prospect of nodding rocks, falling torrents, and all the variety of tremendous nature; on the bleak bosom of this frightful mountain, secluded from society, and detesting the ways of men, lived <HI>Asem</HI> the Man-hater.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="223"/><HI>Asem</HI> had spent his youth with men, had shared in their amusements, and had been taught to love his fellow-creatures with the most ardent affection: but, from the tenderness of his disposition, he ex∣hausted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the distressed. The petitioner never sued in vain; the weary traveller never passed his door: he only de∣sisted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving.</P>
<P>From a fortune thus spent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from those he had for∣merly relieved; and made his application with confidence of redress. The ungrateful world soon grew weary of his importunity; for pity is but a short-lived passion. He soon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them: he perceived a thousand vices he had never before suspected to exist: wherever he turned, ingratitude, dissimula∣tion, and treachery, contributed to increase his de∣testation of them. Resolved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his detestation with contempt, he retired to this region of sterility, in order to brood over his resentment in solitude, and converse with the only honest heart he knew; namely, with his own.</P>
<P>A cave was his only shelter from the inclemency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's side, his only food; and his drink
<PB N="191" REF="224"/>
was fetched with danger and toil from the head∣long torrent. In this manner he lived, sequestered from society, passing the hours in meditation, and sometimes exulting that he was able to live inde∣pendently of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>At the foot of the mountain, an extensive lake displayed its glassy bosom; reflecting, on its broad surface, the impending horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would sometimes de∣scend, and, reclining on its sleep bank, cast an eager look on the smooth expanse that lay before him. <Q REND="inline">"How beautiful," he often cried, "is na∣ture! how lovely, even in her wildest scenes! How finely contrasted is the level plain that lies beneath me, with yon awfull pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds! But the beauty of these scenes is no way comparable with their utility; from hence an hundred rivers are supplied, which distribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow. Every part of the universe is beautiful, just, and wise, but man: vile man is a solecism in nature; the only monster in the crea∣tion. Tempests and whirlwinds have their use; but vicious, ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of universal beauty. Why was I born of that detested species, whose vices are almost a reproach to the wisdom of the divine Creator! Were men intirely free from vice, all would be uniformity, harmony, and order. A world of moral rectitude should be the result of a perfectly moral agent.
<PB N="192" REF="225"/>
Why, why then, O <HI>Alla!</HI> must I be thus confined in darkness, doubt, and despair?"</Q></P>
<P>Just as he uttered the word Despair, he was go∣ing to plunge into a lake beneath him, at once to satisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a most majestic being walking on the surface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he stood. So unexpected an ob∣ject at once checked his purpose; he stopped, con∣templated, and fancied he saw something awful and divine in his aspect.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Son of Adam," cried the Genius, "stop thy rash purpose; the Father of the Faithful has seen thy justice, thy integrity, thy miseries, and hath sent me to afford and administer relief. Give me thine hand, and follow, without trembling, where∣ever I shall lead; in me behold the Genius of Con∣viction, kept by the great prophet, to turn from their errors those who go astray, not from curiosity, but a rectitude of intention. Follow me, and be wise."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Asem</HI> immediately descended upon the lake, and his guide conducted him along the surface of the water; 'till, coming near the centre of the lake, they both began to sink; the waters closed over their heads; they descended several hundred fa∣thoms, 'till <HI>Asem,</HI> just ready to give up his life as inevitably lost, found himself with his celestial
<PB N="193" REF="226"/>
guide in another world, at the bottom of the waters, where human foot had never trod before. His astonishment was beyond description, when he saw a sun like that he had left, a serene sky over his head, and blooming verdure under his feet.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I plainly perceive your amazement," said the Genius; "but suspend it for a while. This world was formed by <HI>Alla,</HI> at the request, and under the inspection, of our great prophet, who once entertained the same doubts which filled your mind when I found you, and from the consequence of which you were so lately rescued. The rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own ideas; they are absolutely without vice. In other respects it resembles your earth, but dif∣fers from it in being wholly inhabited by men who never do wrong. If you find this world more agreeable than that you so lately left, you have free permission to spend the remainder of your days in it; but permit me, for some time, to at∣tend you, that I may silence your doubts, and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habitation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"A world without vice! Rational beings with∣out immorality!" cried <HI>Asem,</HI> in a rapture; "I thank thee, O <HI>Alla,</HI> who hast at length heard my petitions; this, this indeed will produce happi∣ness, extasy, and ease. O for an immortality! to spend it among men who are incapable of ingra∣titude,
<PB N="194" REF="227"/>
injustice, fraud, violence, and a thousand other crimes, that render society miserable."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cease thine acclamations," replied the Ge∣nius. "Look around thee; reflect on every ob∣ject and action before us, and communicate to me the result of thine observations. Lead wherever you think proper; I shall be your attendant and instructor."</Q> <HI>Asem</HI> and his companion travelled on in silence for some time, the former being entirely lost in astonishment; but, at last, recovering his former serenity, he could not help observing, that the face of the country bore a very near resem∣blance to that he had left, except that this sub∣terranean world still seemed to retain its primaeval wildness.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here," cried <HI>Asem,</HI> "I perceive animals of prey, and others that seem only designed for their subsistance; it is the very same in the world over our heads. But, had I been permitted to instruct our prophet, I would have removed this defect, and formed no voracious or destructive animals, which only prey on the other parts of the crea∣tion."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Your tenderness for inferior animals is, I find, remarkable," said the Genius, smiling. But, with regard to meaner creatures, this world exactly resembles the other; and, indeed, for ob∣vious reasons: for the earth can support a more considerable number of animals, by their thus be∣coming food for each other, than if they had lived
<PB N="195" REF="228"/>
entirely on the vegetable productions; so that animals of different natures, thus formed, instead of lessening their multitude, subsist in the greatest number possible. But let us hasten on to the in∣habited country before us, and see what that offers for instruction."</Q></P>
<P>They soon gained the utmost verge of the forest, and entered the country inhabited by men without vice; and <HI>Asem</HI> anticipated, in idea, the rational delight he hoped to experience in such an innocent society. But they had scarce left the confines of the wood, when they beheld one of the inhabi∣tants flying with hasty steps, and terror in his countenance, from an army of squirrels that closely pursued him. <Q REND="inline">"Heavens!" cried <HI>Asem,</HI> "why does he fly? What can he fear from animals so contemptible?"</Q> He had scarce spoke, when he perceived two dogs pursuing another of the human species, who, with equal terror and haste, at∣tempted to avoid them. <Q REND="inline">"This," cried <HI>Asem</HI> to his guide, "is truly surprising; nor can I con∣ceive the reason for so strange an action."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Every species of animals," replied the Genius, "has of late grown very powerful in this country; for the inhabitants, at first, thinking it unjust to use ei∣ther fraud or force in destroying them, they have insensibly increased, and now frequently ravage their harmless frontiers."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"But they should have been destroyed," cried <HI>Asem</HI>; "you see the conse∣quence of such neglect."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Where is then that
<PB N="196" REF="229"/>
tenderness you so lately expressed for subordinate animals?" replied the Genius, smiling: "you seem to have forgot that branch of justice."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I must acknowledge my mistake," returned <HI>Asem</HI>; "I am now convinced that we must be guilty of tyranny and injustice to the brute creation, if we would enjoy the world ourselves. But let us no longer observe the duty of men to these irrational creatures, but survey their connexions with one another."</Q></P>
<P>As they walked farther up the country, the more he was surprised to see no vestiges of handsome houses, no cities, nor any mark of elegant design. His conductor perceiving his surprise, observed, That the inhabitants of this new world were per∣fectly content with their ancient simplicity; each had an house, which, though homely, was suffi∣cient to lodge his little family; they were too good to build houses, which would only increase their own pride, and the envy of the spectator; what they built was for convenience, not for shew. <Q REND="inline">"At least, then," said <HI>Asem,</HI> "they have neither architects, painters, or statuaries, in their society; but these are idle arts, and may be spared. How∣ever, before I spend much more time here, you should have my thanks for introducing me into the society of some of their wisest men: there is scarce any pleasure to me equal to a refined con∣versation; there is nothing of which I am so ena∣moured as wisdom."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Wisdom!" replied his
<PB N="197" REF="230"/>
instructor, "how ridiculous! We have no wisdom here, for we have no occasion for it; true wisdom is only a knowledge of our own duty, and the duty of others to us: but of what use is such wisdom here? Each intuitively performs what is right in himself, and expects the same from others. If, by wisdom, you should mean vain curiosity and empty speculation, as such pleasures have their origin in vanity, luxury, or avarice, we are too good to pursue them."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"All this may be right," says <HI>Asem</HI>; but, methinks, I observe a solitary disposition prevail among the people; each family keeps separately within their own precincts, with∣out society, or without intercourse."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That, indeed, is true," replied the other; "here is no established society; nor should there be any: all societies are made either through fear or friend∣ship; the people we are among, are too good to fear each other; and there are no motives to private friendship, where all are equally meritorious."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, then," said the sceptic, "as I am to spend my time here, if I am to have neither the polite arts, nor wisdom, nor friendship, in such a world, I should be glad, at least, of an easy com∣panion, who may tell me his thoughts, and to whom I may communicate mine."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And to what purpose should either do this?" says the Genius: "flattery or curiosity are vicious motives, and never allowed here; and wisdom is out of the question."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="231"/><Q REND="inline">"Still, however," said <HI>Asem,</HI> "the inhabitants must be happy; each is contented with his own possessions, nor avariciously endeavours to heap up more than is necessary for his own subsistence; each has, therefore, leisure to pity those that stand in need of his compassion."</Q> He had scarce spoken, when his ears were assaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who sat by the way-side, and, in the most deplorable distress, seemed gently to murmur at his own misery. <HI>Asem</HI> immediately ran to his relief, and found him in the last stage of a con∣sumption. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Strange," cried the son of <HI>Adam,</HI>that men who are free from vice should thus suffer so much misery without relief!"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be not surprised," said the wretch who was dying; "would it not be the utmost injustice for beings, who have only just sufficient to support themselves, and are content with a bare subsistence, to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine?

He now departed from the water-side in tranquil∣lity, and, leaving his horrid mansion, travelled to <HI>Segestan,</HI> his native city; where he diligently applied himself to commerce, and put in practice that wisdom he had learned in solitude. The fru∣gality of a few years soon produced opulence; the number of his domestics increased; his friends came to him from every part of the city; nor did he receive them with disdain; and a youth of mi∣sery was concluded with an old-age of elegance, affluence, and ease. <BIBL>ESSAY 16.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF <HI>ALCANDER</HI> AND <HI>SEP∣TIMIUS,</HI> TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ATHENS,</HI> long after the decline of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, still continued the seat of learning, po∣liteness, and wisdom. <HI>Theodoric,</HI> the <HI>Ostrogoth,</HI> repaired the schools which barbarity was suffering to fall into decay, and continued those pensions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, <HI>Alcander</HI> and <HI>Septimius</HI> were fellow students together; the one, the most subtle reasoner of all the <HI>Lyceum</HI>; the other, the most eloquent speaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration soon begot a friend∣ship. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they
<PB N="205" REF="238"/>
were natives of the two most celebrated cities in the world; for <HI>Alcander</HI> was of <HI>Athens, Septimius</HI> came from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>In this state of harmony they lived for some time together, when <HI>Alcander,</HI> after passing the first part of his youth in the indolence of philo∣sophy, thought at length of entering into the busy world; and, as a step previous to this, placed his affections on <HI>Hypatia,</HI> a lady of exquisite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were performed; and nothing now remained, but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI>'s exultation in his own happiness, or being unable to enjoy any satisfaction without making his friend <HI>Septimius</HI> a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce <HI>Hypatia</HI> to his fellow-stu∣dent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himself equally happy in friendship and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both; for <HI>Septimius</HI> no sooner saw her, but he was smitten with an involuntary passion; and, though he used every effort to suppress desires at once so imprudent and unjust, the emotions of his mind in a short time became so strong, that they brought on a fever, which the physicians judged incurable.</P>
<P>During this illness, <HI>Alcander</HI> watched him with all the anxiety of fondness, and brought his mi∣stress
<PB N="206" REF="239"/>
to join in those amiable offices of friendship. The sagacity of the physicians, by these means, soon discovered that the cause of their patient's disorder was love; <HI>Alcander,</HI> being apprised of their discovery, at length extorted a confession from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to describe the conflict between love and friendship in the breast of <HI>Alcander</HI> on this occasion; it is enough to say, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were at that time arrived at such refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to excess. In short, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young <HI>Roman.</HI> They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the constitution of the now happy <HI>Septimius.</HI> In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and set out with his fair partner for <HI>Rome.</HI> Here, by an exertion of those talents which he was so eminently possessed of, <HI>Septimius,</HI> in a few years, arrived at the highest dignities of the state, and was constituted the city-judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Alcander</HI> not only felt the pain of being separated from his friend and his mistress, but a prosecution was also commenced against him, by the relations of <HI>Hypatia,</HI> for having basely given up his bride, as was suggested, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to
<PB N="207" REF="240"/>
withstand the influence of a powerful party. He was cast, and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to raise so large a sum at the time appointed, his possessions were confiscated, he himself was stripped of the habit of freedom, exposed as a slave in the market-place, and sold to the highest bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of <HI>Thrace</HI> becoming his purchaser, <HI>Alcander,</HI> with some other companions of distress, was carried into that region of desolation and steri∣lity. His stated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious master, and his success in hunting was all that was allowed him to supply his precarious subsistence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of season served but to aggravate his un∣sheltered distress. After some years of bondage, however, an opportunity of escaping offered; he embraced it with ardour; so that, travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to shorten a long story, he at last arrived in <HI>Rome.</HI> The same day on which <HI>Alcander</HI> arrived, <HI>Septimius</HI> sat ad∣ministering justice in the forum, whither our wan∣derer came, expecting to be instantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he stood the whole day amongst the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was so much altered by a long succession of hardships, that he continued unnoticed among the rest; and, in the evening,
<PB N="208" REF="241"/>
when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repulsed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night com∣ing on, he now found himself under a necessity of seeking a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, none of the citizens would harbour so much wretch∣edness; and sleeping in the streets might be at∣tended with interruption or danger: in short, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the usual retreat of guilt, poverty, and despair. In this mansion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his miseries for a while in sleep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ease than beds of down can supply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but, hap∣pening to disagree about the division of their plun∣der, one of them stabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In these circumstances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was spread; the cave was examined; and <HI>Alcander</HI> being found, was immediately apprehended, and accused of rob∣bery and murder. The circumstances against him were strong, and the wretchedness of his appear∣ance confirmed suspicion. Misfortune and he were
<PB N="209" REF="242"/>
now so long acquainted, that he at last became re∣gardless of life. He detested a world where he had found only ingratitude, falsehood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no defence; and thus, lowering with resolution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of <HI>Septimius.</HI> As the proofs were positive against him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was pro∣ceeding to doom him to a most cruel and ignomi∣nious death, when the attention of the multitude was soon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended sell∣ing his plunder, and, struck with a panic, had confessed his crime. He was brought bound to the same tribunal, and acquitted every other per∣son of any partnership in his guilt. <HI>alcander</HI>'s in∣nocence therefore appeared, but the sullen rashness of his conduct remained a wonder to the surround∣ing multitude; but their astonishment was still fur∣ther increased, when they saw their judge start from his tribunal to embrace the supposed criminal. <HI>Septimius</HI> recollected his friend and former bene∣factor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the sequel be related? <HI>Alcander</HI> was acquitted; shared the friendship and honours of the principal citizens of <HI>Rome</HI>; lived afterwards in happiness and ease; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circumstances are so despe∣rate, which Providence may not relieve. <BIBL>ESSAY 2.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>PLEASURES OF RURAL RETIREMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retire∣ment in which I passed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling some pain
<PB N="211" REF="244"/>
in thinking that those happy days are never to re∣turn. In that retreat, all nature seemed capable of affording pleasure: I then made no refinements on happiness, but could be pleased with the most aukward efforts of rustic mirth; thought cross-purposes the highest stretch of human wit, and questions and commands the most rational way of spending the evening. Happy could so charming an illusion still continue! I find that age and knowledge only contribute to sour our dispositions. My present enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely less pleasing. The pleasure the best actor gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a Quaker's sermon. The music of the finest singer is dissonance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid sung me into tears with <HI>Johnny Armstrong</HI>'s Last Good Night, or the Cruelty of <HI>Barbara Allen.</HI></P>
<P>Writers of every age have endeavoured to shew that pleasure is in us, and not in the objects of∣fered for our amusement. If the soul be happily disposed, every thing becomes capable of afford∣ing entertainment; and distress will almost want a name. Every occurrence passes in review like the figures of a procession; some may be aukward, others ill-dressed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the master of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>I remember to have once seen a slave in a forti∣fication in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who appeared no way touched
<PB N="212" REF="245"/>
with his situation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall; and condemned to this for life: yet, with all these circumstances of apparent wretchedness, he sang, would have danced but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merriest, hap∣piest man of all the garrison. What a practical philosopher was here! An happy constitution sup∣plied philosophy; and, though seemingly destitute of wisdom, he was really wise. No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairy-land around him: every thing furnished him with an opportunity of mirth; and, though some thought him, from his insensibility, a fool, he was such an ideot as philosophers should wish to imitate; for all philosophy is only forcing the trade of happi∣ness, when nature seems to have denied the means.</P>
<P>They who, like our slave, can place themselves on that side of the world in which every thing ap∣pears in a pleasing light, will find something in every occurrence to excite their good-humour. The most calamitous events, either to themselves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the bustle of heroism, or the rants of ambition, serve only to heighten the ab∣surdity of the scene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in short, as little anguish at their own distress; or the complaints of others, as the undertaker, though dressed in black, feels sorrow at a funeral.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="246"/>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Car∣dinal <HI>de Retz</HI> possessed this happiness of temper in the highest degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and despised all that wore the pedantic appearance of philosophy, wherever pleasure was to be sold, he was generally foremost to raise the auction. Be∣ing an universal admirer of the fair sex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more fa∣vourable reception: if she, too, rejected his ad∣dresses, he never thought of retiring into deserts, or pining in hopeless distress: he persuaded him∣self, that, instead of loving the lady, he only fan∣cied that he had loved her; and so all was well again. When Fortune wore her angriest look, and he at last fell into the power of his most deadly enemy, Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> (being confined a close prisoner in the castle of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI>) he never at∣tempted to support his distress by wisdom or phi∣losophy, for he pretented to neither. He only laughed at himself and his persecutor, and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation. In this mansion of distress, though secluded from his friends, though denied all the amusements, and even the conveniences, of life, he still retained his good-humour; laughed at all the little spite of his enemies; and carried the jest so far, as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</P>
<P>All that the wisdom of the proud can teach, is to be stubborn or sullen under misfortunes. The
<PB N="214" REF="247"/>
Cardinal's example will instruct us to be merry in circumstances of the highest affliction. It matters not whether our good-humour be construed by others into insensibility, or even ideotism; it is happiness to ourselves, and none but a fool would measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it. For my own part, I never pass by one of our prisons for debt, that I do not envy that feli∣city which is still going forward among those peo∣ple, who forget the cares of the world by being shut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>The happiest silly fellow I ever knew, was of the number of those good-natured creatures that are said to do no harm to any but themselves. Whenever he fell into any misery, he usually called it, Seeing Life. If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a sharper, he comforted himself by imitating the <HI>Hibernian</HI> dia∣lect of the one, or the more fashionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiss to him. His in∣attention to money matters had incensed his father to such a degree, that all the intercession of friends in his favour was fruitless. The old gentleman was on his death-bed. The whole family, and <HI>Dick</HI> among the number, gathered around him. <Q REND="inline">"I leave my second son, <HI>Andrew,"</HI> said the ex∣piring miser, "my whole estate, and desire him to be frugal."</Q> <HI>Andrew,</HI> in a sorrowful tone, as is usual on these occasions, prayed Heaven to pro∣long his life and health to enjoy it himself. <Q REND="inline">"I
<PB N="215" REF="248"/>
recommend <HI>Simon,</HI> my third son, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him, beside, four thou∣sand pounds."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Ah! father," cried <HI>Simon</HI> (in great affliction, to be sure), "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself."</Q> At last, turning to poor <HI>Dick,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"As for you, you have al∣ways been a sad dog; you'll never come to good; you'll never be rich; I'll leave you a shilling to buy an halter."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Ah! father," cries <HI>Dick,</HI> with∣out any emotion, "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself!"</Q> This was all the trouble the loss of fortune gave this thoughtless imprudent creature. However, the tenderness of an uncle recompensed the neglect of a father; and my friend is now not only excessively good-hu∣moured, but competently rich.</P>
<P>Yes, let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public, which pronounces him a dunce; at a ge∣neral who smiles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good-humour in spite of scandal; but such is the wisest behaviour that any of us can possibly assume; it is certainly a better way to oppose calamity by dissipation, than to take up the arms of reason or resolution to oppose it: by the first method, we forget our miseries; by the last, we only conceal them from others: by strug∣gling with misfortunes, we are sure to receive some wounds in the conflict; but a sure method to come off victorious, is by running away. <BIBL>ESSAY 3.</BIBL></P>

The lowest mechanic, however, looks upon it as his duty to be a watchful guardian of his country's freedom, and often uses a language that might seem haughty, even in the mouth of the great emperor who traces his ancestry to the moon. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>PICTURE OF A CRITIC.</HEAD>
<P>A CRITIC is often guided by the same motives that direct his author. The author endeavours to persuade us, that he has written a good book: the critic is equally solicitous to shew that he could write a better, had he thought proper. A critic is a being possessed of all the vanity, but not the genius, of a scholar; incapable, from his native weakness, of lifting himself from the ground, he applies to contiguous merit for support, makes the sportive sallies of another's imagination his serious employment, pretends to take our feelings under
<PB N="221" REF="254"/>
his care, teaches where to condemn, where to lay the emphasis of praise, and may with as much justice be called a man of taste, as the <HI>Chinese</HI> who measures his wisdom by the length of his nails.</P>
<P>If, then, a book, spirited or humorous, hap∣pens to appear in the republic of letters, several critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a single line of it, for themselves had read it; and they know what is most proper to excite laugh∣ter. Other critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal, call them all spiders, and assure the public, that they ought to laugh without restraint. Another set are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book, intended to shew the particular passages to be laughed at: when these are out, others still there are who write notes upon notes. Thus a single new book employs not only the paper-makers, the printers, the press-men, the book binders, the hawkers, but twenty critics, and as many compilers. In short, the body of the learned may be compared to a <HI>Persian</HI> army, where there are many pioneers, several sutlers, number∣less servants, women and children in abundance, and but few soldiers. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>FORTUNE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF LOVE AND AFFECTION AMONG THE MODERNS.</HEAD>
<P>THE formalities, delays, and disappointments, that precede a treaty of marriage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">England.</NOTE> here, are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace. The laws of this country are finely calculated to promote all commerce, but the commerce between the sexes. Their encouragements for propagating hemp, madder, and tobacco, are indeed admira∣ble! Marriages are the only commodity that meets with discouragement.</P>
<P>Yet, from the vernal softness of the air, the verdure of the fields, the transparency of the streams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to courtship. Here Love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amidst gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it seems he has forsaken the island; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love, or an union of minds, is the last and most trifling consideration. If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite, their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mort∣gaged lawn becomes enamoured of the lady's mar∣riageable grove; the match is struck up; and both parties are piously in love—according to act of parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="256"/>Thus, they who have fortune, are possessed at least of something that is lovely; but I actually pity those who have none. I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no other merit but youth, virtue, and beauty, had a chance for husbands, at least amongst our clergymen and officers. The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions. But of late, all the little traffic of blushing, ogling, dimpling, and smiling, has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided. A lady's whole cargo of smiles, sighs, and whispers, is declared utterly contraband, till she arrives in the warm latitude of twenty-two, where commo∣dities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and smile, when the dimples begin to forsake her; and, when per∣haps grown ugly, is charitably intrusted with an unlimited use of her charms. Her lovers, how∣ever, by this time, have forsaken her; the captain has changed for another mistress; the priest him∣self leaves her in solitude, to bewail her virginity, and she dies even without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the <HI>Europeans</HI> discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of <HI>Sofala.</HI> The Genius is surely now no more. In every region there seem enemies in arms to oppress him. Avarice in <HI>Europe,</HI> jealousy in <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> ceremony in <HI>China,</HI> poverty among the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI> and lust in <HI>Circassia,</HI> are all prepared to op∣pose
<PB N="224" REF="257"/>
his power. The Genius is certainly banished from earth, though once adored under such a va∣riety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques, as instances of his former residence and favour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Genius of Love," says the Eastern Apo∣logue, "had long resided in the happy plains of <HI>Abra,</HI> where every breeze was health, and every sound produced tranquillity. His temple at first was crowded, but every age lessened the number of his votaries, or cooled their devotion. Perceiv∣ing, therefore, his altars at length quite deserted, he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region; and he apprised the fair sex of every country, where he could hope for a proper recep∣tion, to assert their right to his presence among them. In return to this proclamation, embassies were sent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to display the superiority of their claims.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And, first, the beauties of <HI>China</HI> appeared. No country could compare with them for modesty, either of lock, dress, or behaviour; their eyes were never lifted from the ground; their robes, of the most beautiful silk, hid their hands, bosom, and neck, while their faces only were left unco∣vered. They indulged no airs that might express loose desire, and they seemed to study only the
<PB N="225" REF="258"/>
graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eye-brows were, however, alledged by the Genius against them; but he set them en∣tirely aside, when he came to examine their little feet.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The beauties of <HI>Circassia</HI> next made their ap∣pearance. They advanced, hand in hand, sing∣ing the most immodest airs, and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes. Their dress was but half a covering; the neck, the left breast, and all the limbs were exposed to view; which, after some time, seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire. The lily and the rose contended in form∣ing their complexions; and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered, to their admirers; they seemed to give, rather than receive courtship; and the Genius of Love dis∣missed them as unworthy his regard, since they exchanged the duties of love, and made themselves not the pursued, but the pursuing sex.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The kingdom of <HI>Kashmire</HI> next produced its charming deputies. This happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by Nature for his abode. Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun; and sea-born breezes, on the other, gave peculiar luxuriance to the air. Their com∣plexions were of a bright yellow, that appeared almost transparent, while the crimson tulip seemed
<PB N="226" REF="259"/>
to blossom on their cheeks. Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary's power to express; and their teeth whiter than their own ivory. He was almost persuaded to reside among them, when, unfortunately, one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In this procession the naked inhabitants of <HI>Southern America</HI> would not be left behind: their charms were found to surpass whatever the warm∣est imagination could conceive; and served to shew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion. But their savage education rendered them utterly un∣qualified to make the proper use of their power, and they were rejected as being incapable of uni∣ting mental with sensual satisfaction. In this man∣ner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected: the black beauties of <HI>Benin,</HI> and the tawny daughters of <HI>Borneo,</HI> the women of <HI>Wida</HI> with scarred faces, and the hideous virgins of <HI>Ca∣fraria</HI>; the squab ladies of <HI>Lapland,</HI> three feet high, and the giant fair-ones of <HI>Patagonia.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The beauties of <HI>Europe</HI> at last appeared; grace in their steps, and sensibility smiling in every eye. It was the universal opinion, while they were ap∣proaching, that they would prevail; and the Ge∣nius seemed to lend them his most favourite at∣tention. They opened their pretensions with the utmost modesty; but unfortunately, as their ora∣tor
<PB N="227" REF="260"/>
proceeded, she happened to let fall the words, 'House in Town, Settlement, and Pin-money.' These seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect: the Genius, with ungovernable rage, burst from amidst the circle; and, waving his youthful pinions, left this earth, and flew back to those aetherial mansions from whence he de∣scended.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The whole assembly was struck with amaze∣ment; they now justly apprehended that female power would be no more, since love had forsaken them. They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair, when it was proposed by one of the number, that, since the real Genius of Love had left them, in order to continue their power, they should set up an idol in his stead; and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best. This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to. An idol of gold was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly, though no way resembling the departed Genius. The ladies of <HI>China</HI> furnished the mon∣ster with wings; those of <HI>Kashmire</HI> supplied him with horns; the dames of <HI>Europe</HI> clapped a purse into his hand; and the virgins of <HI>Congo</HI> furnished him with a tail. Since that time, all the vows ad∣dressed to Love, are, in reality, paid to the idol; while, as in other false religions, the adoration seems most fervent, where the heart is least sincere.</Q> <BIBL><HI>ESSAY 23.</HI></BIBL></P>

<HEAD>COUNTENANCE TO THE VULGAR.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER may become of the higher or∣ders of mankind, who are generally possessed of collateral motives to virtue, the vulgar should be particularly regarded, whose behaviour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears. Those who constitute the basis of the great fabric of society, should be particularly regarded; for, in policy as in architecture, ruin is most fatal when it begins from the bottom. <BIBL>ESSAY 14.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>OPINION OF THE GENIUS OF <HI>VOLTAIRE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN <HI>Voltaire</HI> and the disciples of <HI>Con∣fucius</HI> there are many differences; however, be∣ing of a different opinion does not in the least di∣minish my esteem. I am not displeased with my brother, because he happens to ask our father for favours in a different manner from me. Let his errors rest in peace; his excellencies deserve admi∣ration: let me, with the wise, admire his wisdom; let the envious and the ignorant ridicule his foi∣bles; the folly of others is ever most ridiculous to those who are themselves most foolish. <BIBL>IBID. p. 187.</BIBL></P>
