<L>FArewell the pomp of Flora! vivid scene!</L>
<L>Welcome sage Autumn, to invert the year—</L>
<L>Farewell to summer's eye-delighting green!</L>
<L>Her verdure fades—autumnal blasts are near.</L>
<L>The silky wardrobe now is laid aside,</L>
<L>With all the rich regalia of her pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And must we bid sweet Philomel adieu?</L>
<L>She that was wont to charm us in the grove?</L>
<L>Must Nature's livery wear a sadder hue,</L>
<L>And a dark canopy be stretch'd above?</L>
<L>Yes—for September mounts his ebon-throne,</L>
<L>And the smooth foliage of the plain is gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Libra, to weigh the harvest's pearly store,</L>
<L>The golden ballance poizes now on high,</L>
<L>The calm serenity of Zephyr o'er,</L>
<L>Sol's glittering legions to th' equator fly,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>At the same hour he shows his orient head,</L>
<L>And, warn'd by Thetis, sinks in Ocean's bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Adieu! ye damask roses, which remind</L>
<L>The maiden fair-one, how her charms decay;</L>
<L>Ye rising blasts, oh! leave some mark behind,</L>
<L>Some small memorial of the sweets of May:</L>
<L>Ah! no—the ruthless season will not hear,</L>
<L>Nor spare one glory of the ruddy year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more the waste of music sung so late</L>
<L>From every bush, green orchestre of love,</L>
<L>For now their winds the birds of passage wait,</L>
<L>And bid a last farewell to every grove;</L>
<L>While those, whom shepherd-swains the sleepers call,</L>
<L>Chuse their recess in some sequester'd wall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still shall sage September boast his pride,</L>
<L>Some birds shall chant, some gayer flowers shall blow,</L>
<L>Nor is the season wholly unallied</L>
<L>To purple bloom; the haler fruits shall grow,</L>
<L>The stronger plants, such as enjoy the cold,</L>
<L>And wear a livelier grace by being old.</L>

<L>YET once more, glorious God of day,</L>
<L>While beams thine orb serene,</L>
<L>O let me warbling court thy stay</L>
<L>To gild the fading scene!</L>
<L>Thy rays invigorate the Spring,</L>
<L>Bright Summer to perfection bring,</L>
<L>The cold inclemency of Winter cheer,</L>
<L>And make th' Autumnal months the mildest of the year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ere yet the russet foliage fall</L>
<L>I'll climb the mountain's brow,</L>
<L>My friend, my Hayman, at thy call,</L>
<L>To view the scene below:</L>
<L>How sweetly pleasing to behold</L>
<L>Forests of vegetable gold!</L>
<L>How mix'd the many chequer'd shades between</L>
<L>The tawny, mellowing hue, and the gay vivid green!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How splendid all the sky! how still!</L>
<L>How mild the dying gale!</L>
<L>How soft the whispers of the rill,</L>
<L>That winds along the vale!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>So tranquil Nature's works appear,</L>
<L>It seems the sabbath of the year:</L>
<L>As if, the Summer's labour past, she chose</L>
<L>This season's sober calm for blandishing repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is of well-spent life the time,</L>
<L>When busy days are past;</L>
<L>Man, verging gradual from his prime,</L>
<L>Meets sacred peace at last:</L>
<L>His flowery Spring of pleasures o'er,</L>
<L>And Summer's full-blown pride no more,</L>
<L>He gains pacific Autumn, mild and bland,</L>
<L>And dauntless braves the stroke of Winter's palsied hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For yet a while, a little while,</L>
<L>Involv'd in wintry gloom,</L>
<L>And lo! another Spring shall smile,</L>
<L>A Spring eternal bloom:</L>
<L>Then shall he shine, a glorious guest,</L>
<L>In the bright mansions of the blest,</L>
<L>Where due rewards on virtue are bestow'd,</L>
<L>And reap'd the golden fruits of what his Autumn sow'd.</L>

<L>ALas! with swift and silent pace,</L>
<L>Impatient Time rolls on the year;</L>
<L>The seasons change, and Nature's face</L>
<L>Now sweetly smiles, now frowns severe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas spring, 'twas summer, all was gay,</L>
<L>Now autumn bends a cloudy brow,</L>

<L>As Boreas strips the bending trees.</L>

<L>As russet heaths are wild and bare,</L>
<L>Not moist with dew, but drench'd in rain,</L>
<L>Nor health, nor pleasure, wanders there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more, while thro' the midnight shade,</L>
<L>Beneath the moon's pale orb I stray,</L>
<L>Soft pleasing woes my heart invade,</L>
<L>As Progne pours the melting lay.</L>

<L>From this capricious clime she soars,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vain wish! me fate compells to bear</L>
<L>The downward season's iron reign,</L>
<L>Compells to breathe polluted air,</L>
<L>And shiver on a blasted plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What bliss to life can autumn yield,</L>
<L>If glooms, and showers, and storms prevail,</L>
<L>And Ceres flies the naked field,</L>
<L>And flowers, and fruits, and Phoebus fail?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! what remains, what lingers yet,</L>
<L>To cheer me in the darkening hour?</L>
<L>The grape remains! the friend of wit,</L>
<L>In love and mirth of mighty power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haste, press the clusters, fill the bowl—</L>
<L>Apollo! shoot thy parting ray;</L>
<L>This gives the sunshine of the soul,</L>
<L>This God of health, and verse, and day.</L>
</LG>

<L>Still, still the jocund strain shall flow,</L>

<L>THo' the seasons must alter, ah! yet let me find</L>
<L>What all must confess to be rare,</L>
<L>A female still cheerful, and faithful and kind,</L>
<L>The blessings of autumn to share.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let one side of our cottage, a flourishing vine</L>
<L>Overspread with its branches, and shade;</L>
<L>Whose clusters appear more transparent and fine,</L>
<L>As its leaves are beginning to fade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load,</L>
<L>In our orchard surrounded with pales;</L>
<L>In a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd,</L>
<L>For a tart that in winter regales.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn</L>
<L>Seem to hang on its surface like smoke,</L>
<L>'Till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn,</L>
<L>Within doors let us prattle and joke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when we see clear all the hues of the leaves,</L>
<L>And at work in the fields are all hands,</L>
<L>Some in reaping the wheat, others binding the sheaves,</L>
<L>Let us carelesly strole o'er the lands.</L>
</LG>

<L>How pleasing the sight of the toiling they make,</L>
<L>To collect what kind Nature has sent!</L>
<L>Heaven grant we may not of their labour partake;</L>
<L>But, oh! give us their happy content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sometimes on a bank, under shade, by a brook,</L>
<L>Let us silently sit at our ease,</L>
<L>And there gaze on the stream, till the fish on the hook</L>
<L>Struggles hard to procure its release.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now when the husbandman sings harvest home,</L>
<L>And the corn's all got into the house;</L>
<L>When the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come,</L>
<L>To frolic, and feast, and carouse;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed,</L>
<L>And are leaving the branches all bare,</L>
<L>Either strew'd at the roots, shrivell'd, wither'd, and dead,</L>
<L>Or else blown to and fro in the air;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the ways are so miry, that bogs they might seem,</L>
<L>And the axle-tree's ready to break,</L>
<L>While the waggoner whistles in stopping his team,</L>
<L>And then claps the poor jades on the neck;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds,</L>
<L>Or the fearful young covey beset;</L>

<L>Are becoming a prey to the net.</L>

<L>Let our mutual endearments revive,</L>
<L>And let no single action, or look, but declare,</L>
<L>How contented and happy we live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul,</L>
<L>Let soft music the phantoms remove,</L>
<L>For 'tis harmony only has force to controul,</L>
<L>And unite all the passions in love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With her eyes but half open, her cap all awry,</L>
<L>When the lass is preparing for bed;</L>
<L>And the sleepy dull clown, who sits nodding just by,</L>
<L>Sometimes rouzes and scratches his head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the night when 'tis cloudy, and rainy, and dark,</L>
<L>And the labourers snore as they lie,</L>
<L>Not a noise to disturb us, unless a dog bark</L>
<L>In the farm, or the village hard by.</L>

<L>Then I live, then I triumph, whene'er I retire</L>
<L>From the pomp and parade that the many admire:</L>
<L>Hail ye woods, and ye lawns, shady vales, sunny hills,</L>
<L>And the warble of birds, and the murmur of rills,</L>
<L>Ye flowers of all hues that embroider the ground,</L>
<L>Flocks feeding, or frisking in gambols around;</L>
<L>Scene of joy to behold! joy that who would forego,</L>
<L>For the wealth and the power that a court can bestow:</L>
<L>I have said it at home, I have said it abroad,</L>
<L>That the town is man's world, but that this is of God;</L>
<L>Here my trees cannot flatter; plants, nurs'd by my care,</L>
<L>Pay with fruit, or with fragrance, and incense the air;</L>
<L>Here contemplative solitude raises the mind,</L>

<L>In weather serene, when the ocean is calm,</L>
<L>It matters not much who presides at the helm;</L>
<L>But soon as clouds gather, and tempests arise,</L>
<L>Then a pilot there needs; a man dauntless and wise.</L>
<L>If such can be found, sure he ought to come forth,</L>
<L>And lend to the public his talents and worth.</L>
<L>Whate'er inclination or ease may suggest,</L>
<L>If the state wants his aid, he has no claim to rest.</L>
<L>But who is the man, a bad game to redeem?</L>
<L>He whom Savoy admires, who has Prussia's esteem;</L>
<L>Whom the Spaniards have felt; and whose iron, with dread,</L>
<L>Haughty Lewis saw forging to fall on his head.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>Holland loves him; nor less, in the North, all the powers</L>
<L>Court, honour, revere; and the Empress adores.</L>
<L>Hark! what was that sound? for it seem'd more sublime</L>
<L>Than befits the low genius of pastoral rhime?</L>
<L>Was it Wisdom I heard? or can fumes of the brain</L>
<L>Cheat my ears with a dream? ha! repeat me that strain;</L>
<L>Yes, Wisdom, I hear thee; thou deign'st to declare</L>
<L>Me, me, the sole Atlas, to prop this whole sphere;</L>

<L>The vegetable worlds neglected lie,</L>
<L>And flowers ungather'd fall, and nameless die.</L>
<L>Thousands escape, hid in the pressing throng,</L>
<L>Unknown to Macer's, or to Cowley's song.</L>
<L>You, Psecas, know, in seedy labour skill'd,</L>
<L>What various herbage fatten'd pastures yield,</L>
<L>And what unnumber'd kinds adorn the field,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="38"/>Whose fading beauties pass without regard,</L>
<L>While every drooping herb upbraids the bard.</L>
<L>What learned song will Nature's care impart,</L>
<L>By what kind instinct, and unstudied art,</L>
<L>The numerous natives of the sheltering wood</L>
<L>Avoid their dangers, or procure their food?</L>
<L>What verse has told, how smaller rivals wage</L>
<L>Unequal war, and with the toad engage?</L>
<L>They, Argus-like, are set around with eyes,</L>
<L>And, hung on silken threads, the foe surprize;</L>
<L>Spit on the poisonous wretch more deadly bane,</L>
<L>Who, deeply-wounded, feels the raging pain.</L>
<L>Swift up her pendent womb Arachne climbs,</L>
<L>While he scarce trails along his tortur'd limbs;</L>
<L>But careful will the healing plantain find,</L>
<L>(Plantain to undeserving creatures kind)</L>
<L>Whose sovereign herb the venom'd juice expels,</L>
<L>And now the bloated wretch with innate poison swells.</L>
<L>Or how the speckled snakes their prey surprize,</L>
<L>And with hot fennel rub their weaker eyes;</L>
<L>They, when the bloom of warmer spring begins,</L>
<L>Cast off, as worn-out cloaths, their sloughy skins;</L>
<L>With early youth, returning vigour blest,</L>
<L>Brandish the tongue, and raise the azure crest.</L>
<L>Ants prudent bite the ends of hoarded wheat,</L>
<L>Lest growing seeds their future hopes defeat;</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="39"/>And when they conscious scent the gathering rains,</L>
<L>Draw down their windy eggs, and pilfer'd grains;</L>
<L>With summer's toil, and ready viands fill</L>
<L>The deepest caverns of their puny hill;</L>
<L>There lie secure, and hug their treasur'd goods,</L>
<L>And, safe in labour'd cells, they mock the coming floods.</L>
<L>A thousand kinds unknown in forests breed,</L>
<L>And bite the leaves, and notch the growing weed;</L>
<L>Have each their several laws, and settled states,</L>
<L>And constant sympathies, and constant hates;</L>
<L>Their changing forms no artful verse describes,</L>
<L>Or how fierce war destroys the wandering tribes.</L>
<L>How prudent Nature feeds her various young,</L>
<L>Has been, if not untold, at least unsung.</L>
<L>To th' insect-race the Muse her aid denies,</L>
<L>While prouder men the little ant despise.</L>
<L>But tho' the bulky kinds are easy known,</L>
<L>Yet Nature's skill is most in little shown;</L>
<L>Beside that man, by some kind demon taught,</L>
<L>Has secrets found, that were of old unsought.</L>
<L>Labourious wights have wonderous optics made,</L>
<L>Whose borrow'd sight the curious searcher aid,</L>
<L>And show, what heaven to common view denies,</L>
<L>Strange puny shapes, unknown to vulgar eyes.</L>
<L>So shadowy forms, and sportive demons fly.</L>
<L>Wafted on winds, and not perceiv'd when nigh;</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="40"/>Unseen they sweep along the grassy plains,</L>
<L>And scud unseen before the whistling swains.</L>
<L>But to those seers, in northern isles confin'd,</L>
<L>Inur'd to cold, and harden'd by the wind,</L>
<L>Th' indulgent powers have given a second fight,</L>
<L>That kens the airy sylph, and wandering sprite.</L>
<L>No flitting elf the subtle eye escapes,</L>
<L>When wanton genii sport in antic shapes.</L>
<L>Men Nature, in her secret work, behold,</L>
<L>Untwist her fibres, and her coats unfold;</L>
<L>With pleasure trace the threads of stringy roots,</L>
<L>The various textures of the ripening fruits;</L>
<L>And animals, that careless live at ease,</L>
<L>To whom the leaves are worlds, the drops are seas.</L>
<L>If to the finish'd whole so little goes,</L>
<L>How small the parts that must the whole compose!</L>
<L>Matter is infinite, and still descends:</L>
<L>Man cannot know where lessening Nature ends.</L>
<L>The azure dye, which plums in autumn boast,</L>
<L>That handled fades, and at a touch is lost,</L>
<L>Of fairest show, is all a living heap;</L>
<L>And round their little world, the monsters creep.</L>
<L>Who would on colour dote, or pleasing forms,</L>
<L>If beauty, when discover'd, is but worms?</L>
<L>When the warm spring puts forth the opening bud,</L>
<L>The waken'd insects find their ready food;</L>
<L>But when the summer-days dilate the gem,</L>
<L>Stretch out the leaves, and fix the growing stem,</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="41"/>They die unknown, and numerous kinds succeed,</L>
<L>That bask in flowers, or eat the ranker weed;</L>
<L>Wanton in sultry heat, and keep their place,</L>
<L>'Till autumn-fruits produce a different race.</L>
<L>But tho' a thousand themes invite the Muse,</L>
<L>Yet greater subjects will from mean excuse;</L>
<L>They claim the grateful song, whose prudent care</L>
<L>Has quench'd the wasting flames of endless war.</L>
<L>Late civil rage alarm'd the trembling woods,</L>
<L>And bursting sulphur scar'd the sylvan-gods.</L>
<L>War fell'd the trees, and spreading havock made,</L>
<L>The nymphs could hardly find a sheltering shade.</L>
<L>Now, with less frightful sounds the fields are blest,</L>
<L>The swains have leisure, and the land has rest.</L>
<L>Faction, that Hydra, is no longer fear'd,</L>
<L>Her heads are lopp'd, and all the wounds are sear'd:</L>
<L>When innovating schemes successless prove,</L>
<L>They do but fasten, what they would remove.</L>
<L>So restless winds would fly without restraint,</L>
<L>Sweep down the corn, and bend the growing plant;</L>
<L>But taller trees withstand their giddy haste,</L>
<L>And break the fury of the coming blast;</L>
<L>They angry tear the leaves, and blight the fruit,</L>
<L>But strengthen while they shake, and fix the spreading root.</L>
<L>Be still, ye aspin-boughs, nor restless scare,</L>
<L>With busy trembling leaves, the listening hare;</L>
<L>And cease, ye insects, who, to plants unkind,</L>
<L>Or gnaw the root, or bite the softer rind;</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="42"/>Silent attend, while I Britannia bless,</L>
<L>And sing the future joys of lasting peace.</L>
<L>Victoria long her fruitless labour mourn'd;</L>
<L>Without effect her annual work return'd.</L>
<L>One blow to Caesar gave the destin'd throne;</L>
<L>Philippi made the Roman power his own.</L>
<L>Swift as a ray, shot from the rising sun,</L>
<L>Pella's immortal youth his Persia won.</L>
<L>But conquest now is stopp'd by every fort;</L>
<L>Bloodshed is cheap, and war becomes a sport;</L>
<L>In vain the captains fall, the heroes bleed;</L>
<L>Fresh victims to the sacrifice succeed.</L>
<L>So doubtful hills the wearied pilgrim sees,</L>
<L>And flattering prospects give a fancied ease;</L>
<L>Delusive hopes compel his fainting feet</L>
<L>To climb th' ascent, and pass the steepy height:</L>
<L>That summit gain'd, far distant mountains rise,</L>
<L>Whose towering ridges meet the sorrowing eyes,</L>
<L>And, pain renew'd, the wish'd-for rest denies.</L>
<L>Ten years could Hector coming fate retard,</L>
<L>And from th' insulting Greek his Ilium guard.</L>
<L>Yet waving heaps, as antient ballads tell,</L>
<L>The doubtful ruins of old Troy conceal;</L>
<L>Now ten campaigns, and battles yearly won,</L>
<L>Transfer no kingdom, and no king dethrone.</L>
<L>But pitying Anna ends the fruitless toil,</L>
<L>Blood shall no more enrich Flanderian soil.</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="43"/>From her the injur'd States expect redress;</L>
<L>She, who maintain'd the war, must make the peace.</L>
<L>She gives the power, whatever side prevails,</L>
<L>Where-e'er the balance is, she holds the scales.</L>
<L>To her they all commit their common cause,</L>
<L>She sets their limits, and confirms their laws;</L>
<L>Portions divides, and gives to each his share,</L>
<L>The right of birth, or the reward of war.</L>
<L>All must the just impartial hand acquit,</L>
<L>And those who causeless murmur—will submit.</L>
<L>So when th' Almighty, with an awful nod,</L>
<L>Made the rude Chaos own a greater God,</L>
<L>The blended elements, that long had strove,</L>
<L>Would not so ready join in mutual love:</L>
<L>But, first, the purer parts their places took,</L>
<L>And subtle fire the meaner mass forsook:</L>
<L>The war continued with the baser kind,</L>
<L>While seas were loth to be by shores confin'd,</L>
<L>Or earth to have the lowest place assign'd.</L>
<L>Anna has long enrich'd the powers allied,</L>
<L>Their want of treasure, and of troops supplied;</L>
<L>Yet they, as wrong'd, with awkward state complain,</L>
<L>Insatiate thirst! and would new empires gain.</L>
<L>So wanton children sport in careless play,</L>
<L>And slumbering lie, or toy the hours away;</L>
<L>Heedless they live, nor sweat for daily bread,</L>
<L>Yet cry, and murmur, if they are not fed.</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="44"/>The Belgic states forget their former moan,</L>
<L>But, swoln with bloated pride, and mighty grown,</L>
<L>New conquests seek, and deem the world their own.</L>
<L>Nor ravish'd seas, nor India's spicy plants,</L>
<L>Content their wishes, or suffice their wants.</L>
<L>So when fierce rains wash down the lessen'd hills,</L>
<L>And redden'd floods increase the swelling rills;</L>
<L>The swift united streams haste to the plain,</L>
<L>And swampy meads the gathering waters drain.</L>
<L>Each neighbouring hill, and every rising mound,</L>
<L>Barrens itself t' enrich the lower ground:</L>
<L>No moisture can suffice th' insatiate weeds,</L>
<L>Cresses, and filmy rush, and flaggy reeds.</L>
<L>Sunk in their slime, the marshy vales below</L>
<L>Scorn those, to whom their herbs such rankness owe;</L>
<L>Their subject state they confident deny,</L>
<L>And lowest fens will call themselves the High;</L>
<L>Cease, ye unthinking hills, and strive no more</L>
<L>To swell th' ungrateful bogs with a too lavish store.</L>
<L>The foreign realms, whom Anna's arms sustain'd,</L>
<L>Now boast of power, as they before complain'd,</L>
<L>So he, who basely tempts the virtuous dame,</L>
<L>In softer words conceals the guilty flame;</L>
<L>The trembling suppliant her resentment fears,</L>
<L>And adds to moving words more moving tears:</L>
<L>But if the fair refuse with juster pride,</L>
<L>And prudent scorn, what ought to be denied;</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="45"/>The ravisher confess'd resumes the sword,</L>
<L>And rudely threatens, whom he once ador'd.</L>
<L>But none will long the offer'd peace refuse,</L>
<L>Lest what was conquer'd, they as certain lose.</L>
<L>In vain the hireling troops their courage boast,</L>
<L>Victoria sees not there her favourite host.</L>
<L>The German chief retir'd, nor could pursue</L>
<L>The well-laid schemes his warlike fancy drew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Men cannot guess th' events of future time,</L>
<L>Ambition is the growth of every clime;</L>
<L>None can the rise or fall of empires know,</L>
<L>Where power now ebbs, it may as sudden flow.</L>
<L>Gallia has oft, and oft has haughty Spain,</L>
<L>Indulg'd their hopes of universal reign,</L>
<L>And in revolving years may oft again.</L>
<L>The Gods awhile seem to deserve no less,</L>
<L>And, smiling, flatter princes with success.</L>
<L>By wondrous turns the heavenly powers are known,</L>
<L>And baffled schemes superior guidance own.</L>
<L>Heaven has set bounds to every rising state,</L>
<L>And kingdoms have their barriers fix'd by fate.</L>
<L>An infant will the Gallic prince succeed,</L>
<L>The sword is sheath'd; no more the nations bleed.</L>
<L>That kingdom hardly can itself defend,</L>
<L>Where children reign, and factious lords contend.</L>
<L>Once Gallia's shore to Albion's cliffs was join'd,</L>
<L>'Till seas grew rough, and Nereus was unkind;</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="46"/>Tho' lengthen'd wars may some distrust create,</L>
<L>And sow the spreading seeds of vulgar hate;</L>
<L>Again they may a stricter union prove,</L>
<L>And join in mutual aid, and mutual love.</L>
<L>Nor shall the British line ensurance need,</L>
<L>Or Belgic powers determine, who succeed.</L>
<L>For monarchy is heaven's peculiar care,</L>
<L>But foreign aid is worse than civil war.</L>
<L>The promis'd succour is an handle made,</L>
<L>And a pretended reason to invade;</L>
<L>When crafty Hengist with his Saxons came</L>
<L>To aid the isle, and fix the doubtful claim;</L>
<L>The easy Britains the false friend believ'd,</L>
<L>And with fond joy the hostile troops receiv'd:</L>
<L>But Druids, taught by Nymphs, repining sate,</L>
<L>And saw the coming ills, and knew Britannia's fate.</L>
<L>And now the British fleets in southern seas,</L>
<L>With spreading sails the wondering Nereids please:</L>
<L>In havens, erst unknown, they proudly ride,</L>
<L>While the glad Tritons force the lazy tide:</L>
<L>Toss'd with fresh gales the wanton streamers flow,</L>
<L>Nor dread the storms above, nor rocks below:</L>
<L>The powers protect, who rule the restless sea,</L>
<L>And winds themselves their steerage will obey.</L>
<L>The Nymphs shall hide no more from human sight</L>
<L>But with their loveliest forms the bard invite:</L>
<L>Swift Fawns in open view shall scour the plains,</L>
<L>And be, as once, familiar with the swains:</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="47"/>The harmless elves, in every meadow seen,</L>
<L>Will dance at mid-day on the public green:</L>
<L>Pan, and the shepherd-youth shall loving sit</L>
<L>Beneath one tree, and sport in rustic wit;</L>
<L>In the same shade alternate songs repeat,</L>
<L>While Aegle helps the maid to press the streaming tear.</L>
<L>But now the huntsman takes his usual round,</L>
<L>While listening foxes hear th' unwelcome sound;</L>
<L>And early peasants, who prevent the day,</L>
<L>May hither chance unweening guide their way;</L>
<L>For see—the grayish edge of dawn appears,</L>
<L>Night her departure mourns in dewy tears.</L>
<L>The goblins vanish, and the Elfin queen</L>
<L>Foregoes the pleasures of the trampled green.</L>
<L>Nature's unwilling to be rouz'd so soon,</L>
<L>And earth looks pale on the declining moon;</L>
<L>The nimble hours dress out th' impatient sun,</L>
<L>While rising fogs, and whispering gales fore-run.</L>
<L>The bats, a doubtful kind, begin their sleep,</L>
<L>And to their cells the darken'd glow-worms creep;</L>
<L>The coming day, the conscious insects grieve,</L>
<L>And with slow haste the grateful herbage leave,</L>

<L>Vanish'd unseen, and mixt with trackless air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But thou, O Wyndham, who didst ne'er disdain</L>
<L>The shepherd's gift, nor scorn the rural strain;</L>
<L>(Tho' to no pompous sound the ear inclines,</L>
<L>While the mean sense is propt by stronger lines)</L>
<L>Accept the sylvan song—</L>
<L>With pleasing look the fearful bard receive;</L>
<L>You bad him first the humble cottage leave;</L>
<L>Ready to praise, and willing to excuse,</L>
<L>You gave assurance to the bashful Muse.</L>
<L>How would I now describe a generous mind,</L>
<L>Improv'd by study, and by courts refin'd?</L>
<L>But you (ah! too resolv'd) will not allow</L>
<L>The verse to tell, what men already know;</L>
<L>Envy itself their conduct must approve,</L>
<L>Whom the prince honours, and the people love.</L>
<L>Tho' you, in this, unkind deny the bard</L>
<L>The only subject can his pains reward,</L>
<L>You cannot make the tuneful Dryads cease,</L>
<L>For Goddesses will sing of whom they please;</L>
<L>Long will the grateful woods your name repeat,</L>

<L>ON a fair mead a dunghill lay,</L>

<L>TEars, which the bar-rang'd orators command,</L>
<L>Are tears of pleasure for the fee in hand;</L>
<L>The greater this, the more abundant those,</L>
<L>Rated by price, as wine by measure flows.</L>
<L>But wines a due hilarity impart,</L>
<L>Their tears add gladness to the heavy heart.</L>
<L>Grief, when sincere, by no vain proof appears,</L>
<L>Too vast for the parade of formal tears.</L>
<L>So, in the skies when deep-charg'd thunders brew,</L>
<L>No clouds descend in rain, or melt in dew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Tully's words when listening senates hung,</L>
<L>Charm'd by the living magic of his tongue,</L>
<L>Few tears suffic'd; for tears then learn'd to flow</L>
<L>Less at the call of lucre than of woe.</L>
<L>Once from the offer'd hand your fee withdraw,</L>
<L>That key which opes the cabinet of law;</L>
<L>Tears then no more shall their full sluices break,</L>
<L>Nor eyes amid the dew of rhetoric—speak:</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="54"/>Thus, when the sky a gloom of vapours shrouds,</L>
<L>Thunders would mutter words thro' watery clouds.</L>
<L>Alike so far, each here the verse confines,</L>
<L>That both are empty marks, and passive signs;</L>
<L>These, from the touch of flames etherial roll'd,</L>
<L>Those, from the no less subtile touch of gold.</L>
<L>This maxim then how much the truth beyond,</L>
<L>" Hearts must with eyes for ever correspond:"</L>
<L>Reverse the adage, and behold it true,</L>
<L>If you mankind thro' no false optics view.</L>

<L>The doctor's tears, if doctors weep at all,</L>
<L>That soon his patient will recover, fall.</L>
<L>Each salient vein, that vibrates still to health,</L>
<L>Beats in repugnance to the pulse of wealth.</L>
<L>Each sign, that to a happy crisis tends,</L>
<L>A tear resistless to its orbit sends.</L>
<L>But here the pointed satire fain would stop,</L>
<L>Joy too, like sorrow, boasts her pearly drop.</L>
<L>From fleecy clouds, on which the sun-beam plays,</L>
<L>Oft falls the dew-shower interspers'd with rays:</L>
<L>Let Candor then, who scorns the partial plan,</L>
<L>Sometimes mistake the doctor for a man.</L>

<L>Who can behold him, and refrain from tears,</L>
<L>None, but the marble-hearted wretch who—hears.</L>
<L>His head, his heart, his eyes, all correspond,</L>

<L><PB N="55" REF="57"/>But, had he been from self-complacence freed,</L>

<L>This vain parade of partial tears is shown,</L>

<L>As stones themselves distil a breathing dew.</L>
<L>As springs to earth, all-gently they impart</L>
<L>A kindly genial softness to the heart.</L>
<L>Tears, when the mind enjoys unruffled ease,</L>

<L>That more, far more, than empty sounds impart:</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="59"/>By which it loves, o'erburden'd, to complain,</L>
<L>When words would but offend, or prove in vain.</L>
<L>Tears ease the soul in anguish and despair,</L>

<L>Thus close-pent clouds dissolve in hasty showers,</L>
<L>By which the thunder loses all its powers;</L>
<L>By which the sky, far as the view unfolds,</L>
<L>A temperature serene and soften'd holds.</L>
<L>Tears are the gentle streams that off convey</L>
<L>Those floods that would o'erwhelm us by delay;</L>
<L>The heart's big swell, much by misfortunes griev'd,</L>
<L>That heaving soon would burst if not reliev'd.</L>
<L>Tears are the tender proofs of love sincere,</L>
<L>In silence shed, whence no reports take air:</L>
<L>Shed, as the tribute of congenial minds,</L>
<L>While each a more than vulgar transport finds.</L>
<L>False eyes, indeed, may weep, if fame divulge,</L>
<L>But true affection only can indulge.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tears are the debt in pearly drops convey'd,</L>
<L>But more than pearls in price, to merit paid;</L>
<L>In which none act the base insolvent's part,</L>
<L>But those whom Nature form'd without a heart.</L>
<L>Tears wait on vice, and oft on virtue too,</L>
<L>As winter-clouds dissolve in summer-dew.</L>
<L>Tears, tho' the cheek a partial mark retain,</L>

<L>Tears are the silent arguments to tell</L>

<L>And what can Nature's law thus counteract?</L>
<L>What thus sensation's springs revers'd affect?</L>
<L>O! thought sublime! strong proofs inculcate hence,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHile you enjoy a calm and cool retreat,</L>
<L>Not vex'd by autumn's wind, or summer's heat,</L>
<L>Entrench'd within the bosom of the vale,</L>
<L>You catch the morning sun, or evening gale;</L>
<L>Then trip the verdant lawn, and pensive muse,</L>
<L>Or moralize within the gloom of yews:</L>
<L>'Till something starts to blame or to commend,</L>
<L>To please, surprize, and to instruct a friend.</L>
<L>The sands then lose their barrenness, for they</L>
<L>Produce a cheerful song, or moral lay.</L>
<L>The villa, garden, mountain, meadow, rill,</L>
<L>Rise all-spontaneous to the fertile quill;</L>
<L>Grow in your verse, and grow to fair renown;</L>
<L>While others property you make your own.</L>

<L>Forgive me, if the long-neglected lyre</L>
<L>I touch, to warble lays thy lines inspire:</L>
<L>If I the tender notes of friendship raise,</L>
<L>Yet greatly envy what I fondly praise.</L>
<L>As humble as thy heart I view thy vill,</L>
<L>Thy song as lofty as yon chalky hill.</L>
<L>I view thy mind, and, undeceiv'd, can tell</L>
<L>How taste with true simplicity can dwell:</L>

<L>Mirth to reserve, and solitude to sense.</L>

<L>See the great world, see all its busy strife</L>
<L>Is but to wander thro' the maze of life:</L>
<L>Tir'd, from the down of Pleasure's pamper'd bed,</L>
<L>They rise, they yawn, are dress'd, fatigued, and fed:</L>
<L>And, in the chase of one laborious day,</L>
<L>A thousand errands make, or visits pay.</L>
<L>Ask, for what all this bustle? They must own</L>
<L>They hate to think, and dread to be alone.</L>

<BYLINE>BY MR. WOTY.</BYLINE>
<L>FOR once, ye critics, let the sportive Muse</L>
<L>Her fool's-cap wear, spite of the shaking head</L>
<L>Of stern-eyed Gravity—for, tho' the Muse</L>
<L>To frolic be dispos'd, no song she chants</L>

<L>Ye sylvan deities! awhile adieu!</L>
<L>Ye curling streams! whose banks are fring'd with flowers,</L>
<L>Violet and hare-bell, or the king-cup bright,</L>
<L>Farewell! for I must leave your rich perfumes</L>

<L>But not that Pin, at whose circumference</L>

<L>From thief nocturnal: nor that other call'd</L>

<L>No—'tis the Pin so much by ladies us'd;</L>
<L>Without whose aid, the nymph of nicest taste,</L>
<L>Of neatest mould, a slattern would appear.</L>
<L>Hail then, thou little useful instrument!</L>

<L>The kerchief from her neck of snow would fall</L>
<L>With freedom bold, and leave her bosom bare.</L>

<L>In alley, path, wide square, and open street,</L>
<L>The miser picks, as conscious of thy use;</L>
<L>With frugal hand, accompanied with brow</L>
<L>Of corrugated bent, he sticks thee safe,</L>
<L>Interior on his coat; then creeps along,</L>
<L>Well judging thy proportion to a groat.</L>
<L>Thro' all thy different storehouses to trace</L>
<L>Thy presence, either in the sculptur'd dome,</L>
<L>Or tenement clay-built, would ask a pen</L>
<L>With points almost as various as thy heads.</L>
<L>Where-e'er thou art, or in whatever form,</L>

<L>And both were wedded by the care of man,</L>
<L>When long they liv'd in amorous friendship join'd,</L>
<L>The Thread grew rotten, and the Needle blind!</L>
<L>For who can rule th' uncertain chance of life?</L>
<L>So fares it in the end with man and wife!</L>
<L>Our froward dames are often out of joint,</L>
<L>And husbands, like the Needle, lose their point.</L>
<L>The Silk-worm next her curious weft display'd,</L>
<L>And wrought her lines along the mulberry shade;</L>
<L>The Needle soon another mistress found,</L>
<L>A softer bride, more elegant and round,</L>
<L>Of firmer texture, and of glossier hue,</L>
<L>Needles, like men, are fond of all that's new:</L>

<L>Yes! bigamy still tempts the lawless crowd,</L>
<L>But thank the laws, ye wives—'tis not allow'd.</L>
<L>What! a third wife—ay! tremble at the word</L>
<L>Ye former wives—the Needle weds a third!</L>
<L><PB N="71" REF="73"/>He weds the daughter of old Farmer Fleece,</L>
<L>Even such a dame as Jason brought from Greece;</L>
<L>A bride full coarse, and recreant to his love,</L>
<L>But once united—supple as a glove—</L>
<L>Hairy, and rough, of Esau's rustic breed,</L>
<L>Who mock'd her rivals of the worm, and weed;</L>
<L>For her the Needle must his size enlarge,</L>
<L>And the third wife still brings a heavy charge;</L>
<L>Her name was Lady Worsted, and she came</L>
<L>From Lady Wool—a matron of high fame;</L>
<L>She boasted blood, and blood of tincture deep,</L>
<L>Descended from the lineage of a—sheep.</L>
<L>And thus, while dear polygamy prevail'd,</L>
<L>The Needle still with wind and current sail'd;</L>
<L>Yet, like Sultanas, tho' they wooed their Turk,</L>
<L>Each wife was skill'd, and constant to her work,</L>
<L>For joint, or separate, they maintain'd their vows,</L>
<L>And never left the drudgery to poor spouse;</L>
<L>Each had her own department—Lady Silk</L>
<L>Deck'd the white glove, for hands as white as milk;</L>
<L>She claim'd the mantua-making, as her trade,</L>
<L>Her's was the jantee trolloppee and shade,</L>
<L>From the smirk lady to—my lady's maid;</L>
<L>'Twas she set off the milliner so gay,</L>
<L>From humble sattin to proud padesuay—</L>
<L>She trimm'd the bonnet, and the flaming hat,</L>
<L>Proportion'd to the face, or lean or fat.</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="74"/>Fair Lady Thread profess'd the sempstress' art;</L>
<L>In the fine shirt, or shift, she warm'd the heart:</L>

<L>From Lady Bab to Dolly of the town,</L>
<L>While Gammar Worsted wrought the humbler stuff</L>
<L>Of various colours, for her work was rough.</L>
<L>Like these, did women lead industrious lives;</L>
<L>What halcyon-days were in the gift of wives?</L>
<L>Vain rovers then would envy what they hate,</L>
<L>And only fools reject the married state.</L>
<L>But here, my Muse, the home-spun theme must change,</L>
<L>O'er the sad field of elegy to range;</L>
<L>To sing the dire misfortune of the dame,</L>
<L>Who died a victim to the Needle's fame;</L>
<L>So home the puncture, that she bled to death,</L>
<L>And thro' some artery resign'd her breath;</L>
<L>Th' industrious finger sudden felt the smart,</L>
<L>And quick convey'd it to her throbbing heart,</L>
<L>The crimson streams precipitately move</L>
<L>To guard their fort—the citadel of love;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, near Nottingham's fair town,</L>
<L>Ere the wove stocking to the leg was known,</L>
<L>Young Leius, a Cantab, of learned fame,</L>
<L>Sigh'd for Kinnetta with a virtuous flame,</L>
<L>With unavailing passion, long he strove</L>
<L>To win the icy virgin to his love;</L>
<L>In vain he sung, in vain he touch'd the lyre,</L>
<L>Or boasted sage Apollo as his sire,</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="81"/>Apollo's self, in vain, to Daphne prov'd</L>
<L>The high deserts, thro' which he fruitless lov'd,</L>
<L>Like her, Kinetta fled the amorous swain,</L>
<L>And he, like sage Apollo, wooed in vain;</L>
<L>Tho' oft the laws of motion he explain'd,</L>
<L>And why velocity its end attain'd,</L>
<L>How the quick needles form'd the oblong squares,</L>
<L>Or what proportion time to motion bears,</L>
<L>Why the diameter of calf, and small,</L>
<L>By due gradations, cause the threads to fall,</L>
<L>Or, why the seam behind was like the Line,</L>
<L>Parting each segment of the fair design.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft on his knee, imploring, would he beg</L>
<L>To tell, why Italy was call'd the leg;</L>
<L>Or, why some sages held a fond dispute,</L>
<L>Affirming it was rather like—a boot.</L>
<L>Deaf to his learning, on her work intent,</L>
<L>She sought the safe retreat of winding Trent,</L>
<L>Or oft to Sherwood's forest bent her way,</L>
<L>And to her knitting sung the sprightly lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Enrag'd, his philosophic heart was turn'd</L>
<L>To proud disdain, and whom he lov'd, he scorn'd;</L>
<L>Within a wooden frame, by art divine,</L>

<L>In order rang'd a thousand needles shone,</L>
<L>A shuttle thro' the woof was taught to run</L>
<L>With expedition, thus divinely taught,</L>
<L>With disappointed love and passion fraught,</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="82"/>He first, the stocking wove within a loom,</L>
<L>Glorious discovery! in his peaceful room,</L>
<L>His peaceful room the future scene of war,</L>
<L>Whose arts ten thousand female hands debar</L>
<L>From honest bread—so Thracian women tore</L>
<L>Harmonious Orpheus, in the days of yore.</L>
<L>With hasty step, full to Kinetta's eyes,</L>
<L>Just-finish'd, he display'd the new-born prize:</L>

<L>" Now, scornful maid, he cries, to wisdom's lore</L>
<L>" Dare to prefer thy Knitting Needles more;</L>
<L>" Thine and thy sister females arts, proud fair,</L>

<L>" I know thee by myself, Oh nymph divine,</L>

<HEAD>FIRE, WATER, AND REPUTATION.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE SAME.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>NICE to the touch, as ermine chaste,</L>
<L>Sweet reputation soon is lost,</L>
<L>Before detraction's beam 'twill waste,</L>
<L>And prove us bankrupts to our cost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How strictly then should prudence guard</L>
<L>This rich, invaluable gem?</L>
<L>Whence honour sprouts, the bright reward,</L>
<L>Full-blowing from so frail a stem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To prove my moral staunch and true,</L>
<L>Three travellers once took the road,</L>
<L>Each had a separate point in view,</L>
<L>And each, no doubt, his own abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One was the element of Fire,</L>
<L>A right, choice spirit of the age,</L>
<L>The boon companion of desire,</L>
<L>And well adapted to engage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Water, a smooth deceitful spark,</L>
<L>Walk'd with, him—and you'll say that's strange,</L>
<L>But, stranger, met in Noah's ark—</L>
<L>And any novelty for change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
<L>The third was Reputation, sweet</L>
<L>As violet, or damask rose,</L>
<L>They talk'd of Britain's conquering fleet,</L>
<L>And who were friends, and who were foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length three roads appear'd in view,</L>
<L>Alas! the dearest friends must part;</L>
<L>A future commerce to renew,</L>
<L>They ask'd each other's trade, or art;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By what sure tokens each may find,</L>
<L>Upon enquiry, one another,</L>
<L>If, haply, each were so inclin'd,</L>
<L>On meeting, to salute his brother.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Warmest in converse, Fire began,</L>
<L>" My friends, I part with you in pain,</L>
<L>" By country, I'm an African,</L>
<L>" And, sometimes, traffic to New Spain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" In Nature's works I range at large,</L>
<L>" A tyrant-master, unconfin'd;</L>
<L>" The servant's duty I discharge,</L>
<L>" When due restraints, compulsive, bind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" I'm oft produc'd from flint and steel;</L>
<L>" For smiths I heat the temper'd bar,</L>
<L>" For cooks I dress the splendid meal,</L>
<L>" And roar, like thunder, in the war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
<L>" In faction's voice I'm loud and high,</L>
<L>" In love, I kindle chaste desire,</L>
<L>" When smoke appears, suspect me nigh,</L>
<L>" Tho' frequently I prove false fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" From heaven Prometheus stole my ray,</L>
<L>" To man imparted as a gift,</L>
<L>" I'm gently lambent when I'm Gay,</L>
<L>" But keen, and brightest when I'm Swift.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" You cannot miss me by these marks,</L>
<L>" Such are the characters I bear,</L>
<L>" Like Beauty, I have many sparks,</L>
<L>" Most apt to catch, if tinder's near."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" My varied shape, a thousand ways,</L>
<L>" Says Water, may be soon mistook,</L>
<L>" When winter's freezing fetters glaze,</L>
<L>" 'Tis hard to know me in the brook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Chang'd in my nature, now in snows</L>
<L>" I fall—now murmur in the rill,</L>
<L>" In hail or fleet, as Boreas blows,</L>
<L>" I drop—and yet I'm Water still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" I stand unmov'd in stagnant pool,</L>
<L>" In crystal lakes have little motion,</L>
<L>" In baths I'm warm—in fountains cool,</L>
<L>" Seldom at quiet in the Ocean.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
<L>" Whene'er you spy the willow green,</L>
<L>" Believe my banks are very near;</L>
<L>" Or where the waving flag is seen,</L>
<L>" Suspect my Naiads to be there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" I'm known to all by different names,</L>
<L>" Of high distinctions vainly fond,</L>
<L>" I'm call'd a river, in the Thames,</L>
<L>" In pleasure-gardens, I'm a pond.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" I'm salt, or sweet, in sea, or stream,</L>
<L>" I'm often muddy, often clear,</L>
<L>" And vary, like the poet's theme,</L>
<L>" As Dulness, or the Muse is near.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" You'll know me sirs—by Adam's wines,</L>
<L>" My stages too are worth recounting,</L>
<L>" You'll find me at two constant signs,</L>
<L>" Well known—the rainbow, and the fountain."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Alas! sweet Reputation cries,</L>
<L>With folded hands, and candid air,</L>
<L>" Unlike you both in shape, or size,</L>
<L>" I'm sought with pain, and found with care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Ah me! if I but go astray,</L>
<L>" Or miss my path, on fairy-ground—</L>
<L>" If Reputation lose her way,</L>
<L>" 'Tis ten to one she's never found."</L>

<L>Poems I study not; I seek, I own,</L>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY TO DONCASTER, OR A CURIOUS JOURNAL OF FIVE DAYS, WROTE WITH A PENCIL IN A CHAISE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR ANNE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>IN prose I've wrote you many a journal</L>
<L>Of travels, which I hope you'll burn all,</L>
<L>And now for once I write in rhyme</L>
<L>To tell you how I spend my time,</L>
<L>And what adventures may ensue</L>
<L>While I am hasting down to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Sep. the second day I went</L>
<L>To London from my house in Kent;</L>
<L>And, as good luck would have it, found</L>
<L>A friend for shire of Ebor bound:</L>
<L>It proving temperate, pleasant weather,</L>
<L>We soon agreed to go together,</L>
<L>And for our ease, o'er turnpike-ways,</L>
<L>To travel down in my post-chaise.</L>
<L>By learned men it is agreed,</L>
<L>Poets should ride the winged steed;</L>
<L>And therefore, thus says Betty Martin,</L>
<L>" Thou art no poet, that's most certain."</L>
<L><PB N="106" REF="108"/>Thro' Kentish-town, up Highgate-hill,</L>
<L>Our horses move—against their will;</L>
<L>And, while they snuff the wholesome wind,</L>
<L>We cast a parting look behind,</L>
<L>Pleas'd t' have left yon sable cloud,</L>
<L>That buries millions in its shroud;</L>
<L>Alas! they toil, the sons of care!</L>
<L>And never breathe the purer air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy common, Finchley, next we measure,</L>
<L>Whose woodland views would give us pleasure,</L>
<L>But that they many a wretch exhibit,</L>
<L>Too near the high road, on a gibbet;</L>
<L>Hence men may guess, without much skill,</L>
<L>Here have been rogues—and may be still.</L>
<L>High-Barnet pass'd, we reach the plain,</L>
<L>Where Warwick, haughty earl, was slain:</L>
<L>So perish all, as Warwick fell,</L>
<L>Who 'gainst their lawful liege rebel!</L>
<L>Ah! passing strange, that one sweet flower</L>
<L>Should kindle all the rage of power!</L>
<L>Yet England oft has wail'd her woes,</L>
<L>And wept the colours of the rose.</L>
<L>With hungry appetites we hie on,</L>
<L>Where Hatfield shows the Silver Lion;</L>
<L>But, lo! nice steaks from rump of beef</L>
<L>Will soon afford us kind relief;</L>
<L>Of good old Port we drink a quart,</L>
<L>Discharge our reckoning, and depart.</L>
<L>Thro' sandy lanes, and deep defiles,</L>
<L>Where ray of Phoebus never smiles,</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="109"/>(Save on that beam-illumin'd dwelling,</L>
<L>Where Young delights the Muse at Welling)</L>
<L>We march as gently as we can,</L>
<L>And reach at Stevenage the Swan:</L>
<L>A well-fed pullet, roasted nice,</L>
<L>And of high-season'd ham a slice,</L>
<L>Of suppers could not prove the worst—</L>
<L>Warm negus gratified our thirst:</L>
<L>At ten the welcome down we prest,</L>
<L>And wooed the kindly Power of rest.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With early dawn we mount the chaise,</L>
<L>And Phoebus smiles in friendly rays:</L>
<L>O'er finest turnpike-road we bowl,</L>
<L>The wheels, the numbers gently roll,</L>
<L>Speed swift to Baldock down the hill,</L>
<L>Where liv'd sweet Polly of the Mill,</L>
<L>But now the lovely Polly's gone,</L>
<L>Rival of Venus!—so drive on.</L>
<L>Thro' villages, o'er plains we ride,</L>
<L>Where Ouze conducts his silver tide;</L>
<L>So slow his winding waters stray,</L>
<L>He seems to linger on his way,</L>
<L>As loth to leave the pleasing scene</L>
<L>Of woods, corn-fields, and pastures green:</L>
<L>Thus man, low-grovelling, like the river,</L>
<L>Would loiter in this life for ever;</L>
<L>So beautiful these scenes appear,</L>
<L>He thinks it better to be here,</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="110"/>Than try that country, from whose bourn</L>
<L>No pale-eyed travellers return.</L>
<L>At Eaton next, by twelve a clock,</L>
<L>We bait our horses at the Cock:</L>
<L>Then leave awhile the public road,</L>
<L>To take with friends a night's abode:</L>
<L>This visit comes in due succession,</L>
<L>And therefore deem it no digression.</L>
<L>Thence cross corn-fields our way explore,</L>
<L>Where chariots never went before;</L>
<L>Thro' rushy swamps, and bogs we past,</L>
<L>And came to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of a small hamlet.</NOTE>Beggary at last:</L>
<L>Even then we did not know our doom,</L>
<L>For worse misfortunes were to come:</L>
<L>Fain would we thro' the pastures ride;</L>
<L>Our entrance gates and locks denied:</L>
<L>Thro' that deep lane, where many a slough</L>
<L>Would spoil a horse, or hide a cow,</L>
<L>Pass on we must, if we intend</L>
<L>To pay our visit to a friend:</L>
<L>True friendship has a bias strong,</L>
<L>It drove us thro' the mire along,</L>
<L>O'er banks and ridges, till, at last,</L>
<L>It fairly set the carriage fast—</L>
<L>What's to be done?—with might and main</L>
<L>We haul'd it on the land again:</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="111"/>At length, with fear and wild amaze,</L>
<L>We crawl'd thro' safely with the chaise;</L>
<L>Now on the precipice's edge,</L>
<L>Now bounc'd against a quickset hedge,</L>
<L>And, by a wondrous kind of fate,</L>
<L>By four arriv'd at P—'s gate;</L>
<L>Whose entertainment, neat and kind,</L>
<L>Soon put these dangers out of mind:</L>
<L>With social friends we past the day,</L>
<L>And gaily laugh'd our cares away—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At six we march, but first provide,</L>
<L>To shun bad roads, a faithful guide;</L>
<L>And shortly, o'er the rising steep,</L>
<L>We saw the spire of Bugden peep:</L>
<L>At breakfast near an hour we waste,</L>
<L>'Twas coffee, grateful to the taste,</L>
<L>With dulcet cream, and nut-brown toast;</L>
<L>Then bid a Valeas to our host.</L>
<L>O'er level roads we drive amain,</L>
<L>Roads as the well-roll'd terrace plain,</L>
<L>And soon reach'd Stilton safe and well—</L>
<L>We chose the inn that bears the Bell.</L>
<L>On mutton, charming food! we dine,</L>
<L>And cheer our hearts with generous wine;</L>
<L>But long, alas! we must not stay—</L>
<L>Life flies with rapid wing away;</L>
<L>'Tis but a march that we must make;</L>
<L>'Tis but a journey we must take:</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="112"/>Here we can fix no firm abode,</L>
<L>Nor loiter long upon the road;</L>
<L>But must, with vigilance, attend</L>
<L>Still to our journey, and its end.</L>
<L>At Stamford next, with spirits light,</L>
<L>The Bull receives us for the night;</L>
<L>Smelts and a rabbet was our food;</L>
<L>The bill was cheap, the wine was good.</L>
<L>Our wheels next morning early sound</L>
<L>O'er rough, thro' truly Roman ground;</L>
<L>Th' immense Vestigia, still compleat,</L>
<L>Prove that the Romans once were great:</L>
<L>By ten, at Grantham we admire</L>
<L>The noble church, the lofty spire;</L>
<L>Sarum's alone is two feet higher.</L>
<L>Here, what before I ne'er had seen,</L>
<L>I saw fair Venus, Beauty's Queen;</L>
<L>Sweetly she smil'd with graceful look,</L>
<L>In shape of Lady Mary C—.</L>
<L>Our breakfast done, in haste we went</L>
<L>To Newark on the banks of Trent;</L>
<L>There staid a little to regale</L>
<L>On cold roast-beef and humming ale.</L>
<L>Thence thro' a tedious, sandy way</L>
<L>We labour'd, and at Carlton lay:</L>
<L>With friends we drain'd the cheerful bowl,</L>
<L>And supt on mutton and broil'd fowl,</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="113"/>And eels that gave us much content,</L>
<L>Delicious eels—the eels of Trent.</L>
<L>Next morn thro' wretched roads we steer,</L>
<L>Yet pay at turnpikes devilish dear:</L>
<L>The purple heath we travers'd o'er,</L>
<L>And stopt at Barnby on the Moor;</L>
<L>Thence into honest Yorkshire ventur'd,</L>
<L>Which first we at fair Bawtry enter'd:</L>
<L>By three to Doncaster we came,</L>
<L>A town polite, of antient fame;</L>
<L>There will the Muse awhile unbend,</L>
<L>And there this tedious journal end,</L>
<L>Wrote, dearest Anne, at your commands,</L>
<L>And now it flies to kiss your hands.</L>

<HEAD>THE SENTIMENTS OF TRUTH; AN EPISTLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADDRESSED TO THE SONS OF BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. P—Y.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>YE generous Britons, sons of fair renown,</L>
<L>With mute attention deign to lend an ear:</L>
<L>As late reclin'd beneath a spreading oak,</L>
<L>Musing intent on Albion's happy isle;</L>
<L>A sudden slumber gently seal'd my eyes,</L>
<L>And wrapt my wearied limbs in soft repose;</L>
<L>Excursive Fancy wing'd her agile flight</L>
<L>Thro' the aerial mansions of the world;</L>
<L>Instant appear'd, portray'd upon my mind,</L>
<L>The fair Urania, clad in candid robe;</L>
<L>And bright around; in beauteous order rang'd,</L>
<L>A crowd of Britons rising to my view;</L>
<L>A gentle murmur, first, distinct was heard—</L>
<L>The Goddess wav'd her wand—a pause ensued—</L>
<L>Silent in expectation now they sat,</L>
<L>When thus her sentiments she mildly spoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Fam'd Albion's sons, whose rock-encircling coast,</L>
<L>" Emblem of virtues in your noble race,</L>
<L>" Repels each boisterous billow of the deep,</L>
<L>" And stands triumphant o'er the bounding main:</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="116"/>" You who, to vindicate your regal right,</L>
<L>" That right divine by every kingdom claim'd,</L>
<L>" In dreadful thunder shook the distant poles,</L>
<L>" While trembling regions heard the horrid sound;</L>
<L>" Let not Contention, hell's destructive fiend,</L>
<L>" Excite commotion, and your peace destroy;</L>
<L>" Let not Ambition's vile, ignoble train,</L>
<L>" The groveling arts of dark dissimulation,</L>
<L>" Pride, pique, or interest, e'er delude your steps;</L>
<L>" But let benevolence your souls command,</L>
<L>" Your darling passion by your foes confess'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Can you, who brave repell'd th' insidious foe,</L>
<L>" And nobly humbled their imperious crest;</L>
<L>" Can you, so high-renown'd for martial deeds</L>
<L>" And fair emprise, to discord fall a prey?</L>
<L>" Instant renounce each stupor of the soul,</L>
<L>" And virtuous dare the fam'd Britannia's weal.</L>
<L>" Remember Rome, august, imperial Rome—</L>
<L>" She long in virtue's cause resplendent shone:</L>
<L>" Fragrant she bloom'd, and flourish'd wondrous fair,</L>
<L>" Till pomp, vile luxury, corruption fell,</L>
<L>" And Hydra Faction, with malignant breath,</L>
<L>" Tumbled, with cumbrous fall, her eagle-head!</L>
<L>" This world's dread empress, renown'd for learning;</L>
<L>" For arms, arts, virtuous deeds, without compeer.</L>
<L>" Now how inglorious! how supinely sunk!</L>
<L>" Fallen from her high estate, and grovelling in the dust.</L>
<L>" Since reason's lamp illuminates the mind,</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="117"/>" And cogent proves eternity to man;</L>
<L>" Since justice too, eternal, will require</L>
<L>" Strict retribution for offences past;</L>
<L>" Serious reflect on God's supreme decrees,</L>
<L>" And learn obedience to his great commands:</L>
<L>" For what avail earth's pageant pomp and joys</L>
<L>" In that dread hour when death terrific comes,—</L>
<L>" The gaudy title, silken dalliance,</L>
<L>" And life too gaily spent, will but torment,</L>
<L>" Not calm the mind, in that tremendous moment!</L>
<L>" Let then your civil broils and discord cease;</L>
<L>" Enjoy the fruits of your well-earn'd renown;</L>
<L>" Cast off each vice, each poisonous dreg of life;</L>
<L>" Fly fell corruption, taint of generous minds,</L>
<L>" Lest her corroding hand your frame dissolve,</L>
<L>" And bury in the dust your antient toil:</L>
<L>" But if, unheeded, exhortation pass,</L>
<L>" Britannia, now so fam'd, will sure imbibe</L>
<L>" A deeper stain than Afric's tawny sons!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She said; then instant vanish'd into air,</L>

<L>And wipes Affliction's tear from Virtue's eye?</L>
<L>How fair's the lot?—we see, and wondering trace</L>
