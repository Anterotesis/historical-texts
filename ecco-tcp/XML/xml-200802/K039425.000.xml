<P>The Man's bewitch'd; OR, The Devil to do about Her. A COMEDY, As it is Acted at the NEW-THEATRE IN THE HAY-MARKET; BY HER <HI>MAJESTY</HI>'s <HI>SERVANTS.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>To His GRACE WILLIAM Duke of</HI> Devonshire; Lord Steward of Her Majesty's Houshold, Lord in <HI>Eyre,</HI> North of <HI>Trent,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of the County of <HI>Derby;</HI> and One of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your GRACE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Muses were ever ambitious of being distinguish'd, by shrouding themselves under the Patronage of the greatest Men in all Ages; not made so by Titles or Preferment; but such, whose in∣nate Principles of Honour, truly suppor∣ted those their Prince had crown'd them with. From hence sprung my Presump∣tion of laying the following Scenes at Your Grace's Feet; since the World must allow, that all those Virtues, which compleat a perfect good, as well as great Man, are
<PB REF="3"/>
center'd in the Duke of <HI>Devonshire</HI>; the loyalest Subject, the tenderest Husband, and the kindest Master, that ever Monarch, Wife, or Servant had; Briliant Graces, but such as do not shine in every Man of Quali∣ty. From such Patriots, what may not <HI>Britain</HI> hope? Nay, what might not She command, were all her Sons as fervent for her Inte∣rest, and discharg'd their respective Trusts with that Fidelity, and due Regard to the publick Good, as Your Grace has ever done in Yours: Then the hated Name of Faction wou'd be heard no more, and the scandalous Wounds of hot-headed Parties heal'd; which is the only way to secure this Island from foreign Insults, and esta∣blish Peace more firmly, than Armies, tho' vast as <HI>Xerxes</HI> led, can do.</P>
<P>To attempt your Grace's Character, is the superiour business of a Masculine Pen, and not to be reach'd by mine: But since my Husband has the Honour to serve Her Majesty, under the Command of Your Grace, as he did the late King of glorious Memory, under that of your noble Father, I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to alter my
<PB REF="4"/>
Resolution of prefixing your Grace's Name in the front of this Poem, at once to shew my Gratitude, and my Ambition: And if, when Your Grace's Mind's unbended from the Care and Business of the State, it finds the way in some leisure Hour to divert Your Grace, and the Author meet your Pardon for this Liberty, my Wishes are all answer'd; as I hope my Prayers will be, that Your Grace may enjoy a perfect Health, free from Pain in Mind, and Body; and see as many flourishing happy New Years, as your best and dearest Friends can desire; and every one add fresh Honours to those that are so deservedly worn by Your Grace at present, which are the earnest Wishes of</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Shou'd not have troubled my Courteous Reader with a Preface, had I not lain under the Necessity of Clear∣ing my self of what some People have been pleas'd to charge me with, <HI>viz.</HI> of being the Author of a Paper call'd, <HI>The Female Tattler,</HI> consequently of a Paragraph in that of the <HI>14</HI>th Instant, relating to this Comedy; tho' I think no reasonable Person will believe I could be guilty of so much Folly. Tho' Vanity is said to be the darling Vice of Woman∣kind, yet nothing but an Idiot wou'd express themselves so openly; and I hope the World won't think me guilty of Printing, what I must blush to Read, nor imagine it Wrote even by any Friend of mine, for two Reasons; First, the Grossness of the Flattery. Secondly, the In∣jury it must of course do me, in the Run of my Play, by putting those People out of Humour, whose Action was to give Life to the Piece. I suppose these Reasons are suf∣ficient to convince the Judicious part, that I was no ways concerned in those Reflections, but own I was treated with all the seeming Civility in the World, till the second Night of my Comedy. I willingly submitted to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Supe∣riour Judgment in shortning the Scene of the Ghost in the last Act, and believed him perfectly in the Right, because too
<PB REF="6"/>
much Repetition is tiresome. Indeed when Mr. <HI>Estcourt</HI> slic'd most of it out, I cou'd not help interposing my Desires to the contrary, which the rest readily comply'd with; and I had the Satisfaction to see I was not deceiv'd in my Opinion, of its pleasing. This Passage I happen'd to mention among my Acquaintance; for 'tis Natural to have a kind of a Tender for our own Productions, but especially if they have the good Fortune to divert others. Now, if from this the Author of the <HI>Tattler</HI> gather'd his Account, I am guilty of speaking, but not designedly; for who they are that Write that Paper, or how Di∣stinguish'd, I am perfectly ignorant, and declare I never was concern'd, either in Writing, or Publishing, any of the <HI>Tattlers.</HI></P>
<P>I never had the Vanity to think, much less to publish, that any thing I am capable of doing, cou'd support the Stage, tho' I have had the good Fortune to please, or to find the Town willing to be pleas'd; tho' at present it seems a certain Author has enter'd a Caveat against all Plays running to a sixth Night, but his own. Tho' an Opera interfer'd with this Comedy, yet it brought above Forty Pounds the second Night, which shew'd it had some Merit; for I have known many a Play kept up, that fail'd of half that Money the second Night. Now by the Rules of the House, it ought to have been play'd on: But who can secure the Life of a Play, when that of a Man is often Sacrific'd to the Malice of Parties? This Play met with a kind Reception in gene∣ral, and notwithstanding the Disadvantages it had to struggle with, by raising the Prices the first Day, and the Nearness of <HI>Christmas,</HI> it would have made its way to a sixth Night, if it had had fair Play. Mi∣stake
<PB REF="7"/>
me not, I do not mean from the Representation; for I must do the Players Reason: Had I search'd all the Theatres in the World, I cou'd not have selected a better Company, nor had more Justice done me in the Action, tho' they have not dealt honourably by me in my Bargain; for they ought not to have stop'd the Run, upon any Pique whatever. 'Tis small Encouragment to Write for the Stage, when the Actors, according to the Caprice of their Humours, mangre the Taste of the Town, have power to sink the Reputation of a Play; for if they resolve not to Act it, the Town can't support it.</P>
<P>Well, if there is any Merit in suffering wrongfully, I shall find my Account in't one time or other; in the mean while I intreat the <HI>Female Tattler</HI> to be Witty no more at my Expence. I desire I may not be rank'd in the Number of those that support the Stage, since the Stage is become a Noun Substantive, and resolves to shew it is able to stand by itself.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROLOGUE.</HI> By a GENTLEMAN. Spoken by Mr. <HI>WILKS.</HI></HEAD>
<L>OUR Female Author trembling stands within,</L>
<L>Her Fear arises from another's Sin;</L>
<L>One of her Sex has so abus'd the Town,</L>
<L>That on her Score she dreads your angry Frown:</L>
<L>Tho' I dare say, poor Soul, she never writ</L>
<L>Lampoon, or Satyr on the Box or Pit;</L>
<L>A harmless hum'rous Play is her Extent of Wit.</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Bickerstaff</HI>'s vast Genius may engage,</L>
<L>And lash the Vice and Follies of the Age;</L>
<L>Why shou'd tender <HI>Delia</HI> tax the Nation?</L>
<L>Stickle, and make a Noise for Reformation,</L>
<L>Who always gave a Loose, her self, to Inclination.</L>
<L>Scandal and Satyr's thrown aside to Day,</L>
<L>And Humour the sole Business of our Play.</L>
<L>Beaux may dress on to catch the Ladies Hearts,</L>
<L>And good Assurance pass for mighty Parts:</L>
<L>The Citts may bring their Spouses without Fear,</L>
<L>We shew no Wife that's poaching for an Heir,</L>
<L>Nor teach the Use of fine Gause Handkercheir.</L>
<L>Cowards may huff, and talk of mighty Wonders,</L>
<L>And Jilts set up—for Twenty thousand Pounders.</L>
<L>Our Author, even tho' she knows full well,</L>
<L>Is so Good-natur'd, she forbears to tell</L>
<L>What Collonels, lately, have found out the Knack</L>
<L>To Muster Madam, still, by <HI>Ned,</HI> or <HI>Jack,</HI></L>
<L>To keep their Pleasures up; a Frugal way,</L>
<L>They give her—Subaltern's Subsistance for her Pay.</L>
<L>In short, what e'er your Darling Vices are,</L>
<L>They pass untouch'd in this Night's Bill of Fare.</L>
<L>But if all this can't your good Nature wake,</L>
<L>Tho' here and there, a Scene shou'd fail to take,</L>
<L>Yet spare her for the <HI>Busie-Body</HI>'s sake.</L>

<HEAD><HI>EPILOGUE.</HI> Spoken by Mrs. <HI>OLDFIELD. Written by Mr.</HI> Cibber. A Porter delivers a Letter just as she is going to speak.</HEAD>
<L>WHAT's this? a Billet-Deaux? from Hands unknown?</L>
<L>'Tis new to send it thus 'fore all the Town:</L>
<L>But since the poor Man's Passion's so agog,</L>
<L>I'll read it out by way of Epilogue.</L>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>Permit a Wretch to let you know,</L>
<L>That he's no more in <HI>Statu Quo.</HI></L>
<L>My Ruine from this Night commences,</L>
<L>Unless your Smiles refund my Senses;</L>
<L>For with one Thrust of <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Dart,</L>
<L>You've whip'd your Slave quite thro' the Heart:</L>
<L>Therefore, I beg you, cast your Eye</L>
<L>O'er Boxes, Pit and Gallery,</L>
<L>In Pity of my Pains and Doubt,</L>
<L>And try if you can find me out.</L>
</LETTER>
<L>Poor Soul! He seems indeed in dismal Plight;</L>
<L>Let's see! it can't be, sure! from th' upper Flight;</L>
<L>No, no—that's plain—for —None of them can Write:</L>
<L>Nor can I think it from the Middle fell;</L>
<L>For I'm afraid—as few of them can Spell:</L>
<L>Beside, their Haggling Passions never gain,</L>
<L>Beyond the Passage-walking Nymphs of <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI></L>
<L>And then the Pit's more stock'd with Rakes and Rovers,</L>
<L>Than any of these senseless, whining Lovers.</L>
<L>The Backs o' th' Boxes too seem mostly lin'd</L>
<L>With Souls, whose Passion's to themselves confin'd.</L>

<L>The Wretch distinguish'd, by these bloody Marks.</L>
<L><PB REF="10"/>But since the Town has heard your kind Commands, Sir,</L>
<L>The Town shall e'en be Witness of my Answer.</L>
<L>First then, Beware you prove no Spark in Red,</L>
<L>With empty Purse, and Regimental Head;</L>
<L>That thinks no Woman can refuse t'engage in't,</L>
<L>While Love's advanc'd with offer'd Bills on Agent;</L>
<L>That swears he'll settle from his Joy's commencing,</L>
<L>And make the Babe, the Day he's Born, an Ensign.</L>
<L>Nor cou'd I bear a Titl'd Beau, that steals</L>
<L>From fasting Spouse her Matrimonial Meals;</L>
<L>That Modish sends next Morn to her Apartment,</L>
<L>A Civil How-deye—far alas! from th' Heart meant:</L>
<L>Then Powder'd for th' ensuing Day's Delights,</L>
<L>Bows thro' his Croud of Duns, and drives to <HI>White</HI>'s.</L>
<L>Nor cou'd I like the Wretch, that all Night plays,</L>
<L>And only takes his Rest on Winning Days;</L>
<L>That sets up from a lucky Hit, his Rattler</L>
<L>Then's trac'd from his Orig'nal—in the <HI>Tattler.</HI></L>
<L>To tell you all that are my fixt Aversion,</L>
<L>Wou'd tire the Tongue of Malice, or Aspersion.</L>
<L>But if I find 'mongst All One generous Heart,</L>
<L>That Deaf to Stories takes this Stage's Part;</L>
<L>That thinks that Purse deserves to keep the Plays,</L>
<L>Whose Fortune's bound for the Support of Opera's;</L>
<L>That thinks our Constitution here is justly fixt,</L>
<L>And now no more with Lawyers Brawls perplext.</L>
<L>He, I declare, shall my whole Heart receive;</L>
<L>And (what's more strange) I'll love him while I live.</L>

<P>Prithee, <HI>Lovely</HI>; Can you inform me, if a young Lady that lives at Sir <HI>David Watchum</HI>'s will be here too?</P>

<P>We have heard of the Lady; but I believe no body in <HI>Peterborough</HI> has seen her, except his own Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>What kind of a temper is the old Fellow of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>The most peevish, splenetick, mistrustful, ill-natur'd Wretch in the whole County: He comes to the Coffee-house every Morning in an old rusty Chariot for haste, the longest Jour∣ney
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
he takes in the Year: He seldom comes to Church; nay, since that Lady came he has not once been seen there; we fancy he dares not stay two hours from home, for fear she should be stol'n away.</P>

<P>Ah! Sir, this account is most uncomfortable in our Affairs—</P>

<P>One for whom I ought to grieve, did it not smooth a Passage to <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Arms, through the Hearts of our inexo∣rable Parents.</P>

<P>Your Father! Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lovely,</HI> are you for Prayers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the Shrine he kneels to, Madam; if you'll vouchsafe to hear him, he can pray most devoutly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And dissemble most fervently—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith, Madam, that Quality does not belong to us—that is the Womens Prerogative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you never encroach upon our Privileges, sweet Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes faith; I have encroach'd upon some of the Sexes Privileges in my time, I must own. Curiosity— Madam, seldom leads us to put on Masking Habits; but a Lady cannot dress without 'em; Dissimulation is as necessary as her Patches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! How do you prove that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus: When you wou'd gain a Man you like, you appear what you are not—We believe you Angels, but don't always find you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>We always find you Angels, but of the fal'n kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible to be otherwise, whilst Beauty keeps her Court below, you charm our Eyes, and all our Senses wait you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pride and Vanity predominate in your Sex, and like Centinels relieve one another; Pride has made a Lady swear she has Hated such a Man, tho' she was dying for the Sight of him—And Vanity made her Caress a Fop, that at the same time she wish'd at the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are not you even with us? Will not you sigh, ogle, cringe, flatter, swear, kneel, nay give it under your hand, you Love to desperation; but let the poor mistaken
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
Nymph once yield, and you'd give Bond and Judgment to that Old Gentleman you nam'd but now, in two Days to take her off your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you don't include the whole Sex, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>That she do's not, I'm sure; for she knows I never swore any thing to her, but what I am ready to make good— And if she be not the most unconscionable Woman living, she will own I love her heartily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I dare witness for thee, <HI>Lovely.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! Why, what Proofs has he given?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proofs! Why I talk of her all Day—And dream, of her all Night——When she's absent, sigh for her, and am transported when I see her. If these be not proofs of Love, let the Parson say Grace and I'll give her better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this may be done without one Grain of Love, may it not Captain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Const.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not when you are the Object, Madam; and you are too well acquainted with my Heart, to ask that Question out of scruple, I'm certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are no Proofs; you must grow Lean and Mea∣gre—Eat little, and Sleep less—Write fifty Letters in a Day, and burn them all again—Then start up, and draw your Sword; hold it to your Breast; then throw it away agen — Then take your Pen and write your last Farewel—Dispatch it to your Mistress—Then take a Turn by some melancho∣ly purling Stream, with Hat pull'd o'er your Eyes, in deep Contemplation resolve thro' what Door to let in Death, if the Messenger return without Success—When I see you do this, I'll write Lover upon your Brow.</P>
</SP>

<P>When I do, you shall write Fool upon my Forehead.</P>

<P>As well as I know she loves me; we were born for one another, Child; no Man in the Kingdom shall have thee, but my self.—Then if you will eat Chalk, and die of the Pip, I can't help it. Ha, ha, ha.</P>

<P>But the Topick was not a Woman in that Assertion; but if it were, Women in their Days were no more like Wo∣men in ours, than a Clodhopper is to a Captain o' Foot.

<P>The name of Slave belongs not to us free-born People, Sir <HI>Jeffrey</HI>; but were I your Slave, she is not; for since the truth must out, she is no Child of mine, but Daughter to my Lord <HI>Belville</HI>; which I have brought up ever since she was three days old; her Mother dying in her Labour, and her Marriage being private, because she was much below my Lord's Quality; and He at that time under the tuition of a Father; He never made it pub∣lick, but put her into my hands to breed up as my own; when he came to his Estate, he purchas'd a thousand Pounds a Year, and settled it on her; which I have manag'd ever since, and now will deliver it up to Captain <HI>Constant.</HI> This I had told in the Infancy of their Loves; but that I saw your Son was not well with you, and did not then think him a Match good enough for her; but since he has over reach'd me, I hope you'll prove a Father.</P>
