<P>ROSE and COLIN, A COMIC OPERA, IN ONE ACT. As it is performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act, which are generally characterized, either by their natural simplicity, or some single striking incident, and little or nothing more is designed.—It is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertain∣ment on the English theatre, as containing excel∣lent situations for light airs.—On the French stage, notwithstanding all their merit, they tire in the length of time taken for representation; and, were they spun out to the common length of our after∣pieces, it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient.</P>
<P>The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved, and the dialogue both varied and compressed, they are, with every deference, sub∣mitted to public judgment.</P>

<P>So, farmer, Goody Fidgit here has a fine story to tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! why, to what do we owe the sight of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you owe the sight of me to your own goings on—Lord! Lord! that pa∣rents, now-a days, have no more prudence—you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, two men of your age—Thou, Nicholas Gregory, was born the 7th of January, in the year—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, we know how old we are—go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goody.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have no more grace than to let that forward minx, your daughter, chatter to that rogue Colin, every night, out of the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rose.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, dear, how can that be, when I lie in the next room to my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goody.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you do; and you get up again, and creep down a ladder by the way of the grainery.</P>

<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! lord!</P>

<SPEAKER>Goody.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, 'tis no secret—all the village knows it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I could catch any body telling me of it, I'd have a touch at them.</P>

<P>It is, is it—tell me then, what did you knock at that door for, but just now, when farmer Gregory was out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What for—why, to come in, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goody.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you found it locked; and, so rather than fail, you climbed up the wall, and jumped into my garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's another lie, Goody.</P>

<P>We shall see—I can shew your father the fig-tree you broke in getting up.</P>

<P>I tell you 'tis a pack of spight and malice—you broke the fig-tree yourself, I sup∣pose, and now you have a mind to say I did it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goody.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray was it I too dropped this hat, <STAGE>(shewing the hat she had before hid under her apron)</STAGE> which I found under the window?</P>

<P>Oh! ho! I am no longer at a loss to know how he came into the house.</P>
