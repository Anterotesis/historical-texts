<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the least informed reader of this Speech may be enabled to enter fully into the spirit of the transaction on occasion of which it was delivered, it may be proper to acquaint him, that among the princes dependent on this nation in the southern part of In∣dia, the most considerable at present is commonly known by the title of the Nabob of Arcot.</P>
<P>This Prince owed the establishment of his govern∣ment, against the claims of his elder brother, as well as those of other competitors, to the arms and influ∣ence of the British East India Company. Being thus established in a considerable part of the dominions he now possesses, he began, about the year <HI>1765,</HI> to form, at the instigation (as he asserts) of the servants of the East India Company, a variety of designs for the further extension of his territories. Some years after, he carried his views to certain objects of interior arrangement, of a very pernicious nature. None of these designs could be compassed without the aid of the Company's arms; nor could those arms be employed consistently with an obedience to the Com∣pany's orders. He was therefore advised to form a more secret, but an equally powerful interest among the servants of that Company, and among others both at home and abroad. By engaging them in his inte∣rests, the use of the Company's power might be ob∣tained without their ostensible authority; the power might even be employed in defiance of the authority, if
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>
the case should require, as in truth it often did require, a proceeding of that degree of boldness.</P>
<P>The Company had put him into possession of several great cities, and magnificent castles. The good order of his affairs, his sense of personal dignity, his ideas of oriental splendour, and the habits of an Asiatick life (to which, being a native of India, and a Ma∣hometan, he had from his infancy been enured) would naturally have led him to fix the seat of his govern∣ment within his own dominions. Instead of this, he totally sequestered himself from his country; and, aban∣doning all appearance of state, he took up his residence in an ordinary house, which he purchased in the suburbs of the Company's factory at Madras. In that place he has lived, without removing one day from thence, for several years past. He has there continued a con∣stant cabal with the Company's servants, from the highest to the lowest; creating, out of the ruins of the country, brilliant fortunes for those who will, and en∣tirely destroying those who will not, be subservient to his purposes.</P>
<P>An opinion prevailed, strongly confirmed by several passages in his own letters, as well as by a combination of circumstances forming a body of evidence which can∣not be resisted, that very great sums have been by him distributed, through a long course of years, to some of the Company's servants. Besides these presumed payments in ready money (of which, from the nature of the thing, the direct proof is very difficult) debts have at several periods been acknowledged to those gentlemen, to an immense amount; that is, to some millions of ster∣ling money. There is strong reason to suspect, that the body of these debts is wholly fictitious, and was never created by money <HI>bona fide</HI> lent. But even on a sup∣position that this vast sum was really advanced, it was impossible that the very reality of such an astonishing transaction should not cause some degree of alarm, and incite to some sort of enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="4"/>It was not at all seemly, at a moment when the Company itself was so distressed, as to require a suspen∣sion, by Act of Parliament, of the payment of bills drawn on them from India—and also a direct tax upon every house in England, in order to facilitate the vent of their goods, and to avoid instant insolvency—at that very moment that their servants should appear in so flourishing a condition, as, besides ten million of other demands on their masters, to be entitled to claim a debt of three or four millions more from the territorial revenue of one of their dependent princes.</P>
<P>The ostensible pecuniary transactions of the Nabob of Arcot, with very private persons, are so enormous, that they evidently set aside every pretence of policy, which might induce a prudent government in some in∣stances to wink at ordinary loose practice in ill managed departments. No caution could be too great in han∣dling this matter; no scrutiny too exact. It was evi∣dently the interest, and as evidently at least in the power, of the creditors, by admitting secret participa∣tion in this dark and undefined concern, to spread cor∣ruption to the greatest and the most alarming extent.</P>
<P>These facts relative to the debts were so notorious, the opinion of their being a principal source of the dis∣orders of the British government in India was so un∣disputed and universal, that there was no party, no description of men in parliament, who did not think themselves bound, if not in honour and conscience, at least in common decency, to institute a vigorous enquiry into the very bottom of the business, before they admitted any part of that vast and suspicious charge to be laid upon an exhausted country. Every plan concurred in directing such an enquiry; in order that whatever was discovered to be corrupt, fraudulent, or oppressive, should lead to a due animadversion on the offenders; and if any thing fair and equitable in its origin should be found (nobody suspected that much, comparatively speaking, would be so found) it might be provided for;
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
in due subordination, however, to the ease of the subject, and the service of the state.</P>
<P>These were the alledged grounds for an enquiry, set∣tled in all the bills brought into parliament relative to India, and there were I think no less than four of them. By the bill, commonly called Mr. Pitt's bill, the enquiry was specially, and by express words, committed to the Court of Directors, without any reserve for the inter∣ference of any other person or persons whatsoever. It was ordered that <HI>they</HI> should make the enquiry into the origin and justice of these debts, as far as the materials in <HI>their</HI> possession enabled them to proceed; and where <HI>they</HI> found those materials deficient, <HI>they</HI> should order the Presidency of Fort St. George [Madras] to com∣plete the enquiry.</P>
<P>The Court of Directors applied themselves to the execution of the trust reposed in them. They first examined into the amount of the debt, which they com∣puted, at compound interest, to be £ <HI>2,945,600</HI> sterling. Whether their mode of computation, either of the ori∣ginal sums, or the amount on compound interest, was exact; that is, whether they took the interest too high, or the several capitals too low, is not material. On whatever principle any of the calculations were made up, none of them found the debt to differ from the re∣cital of the act, which asserted, that the sums claimed were "<HI>very</HI> large." The last head of these debts the Directors compute at £. <HI>2,465,680</HI> sterling. Of the existence of this debt the Directors heard nothing until <HI>1776,</HI> and they say, that,
<Q><HI>although they had</HI> repeat∣edly <HI>written to the Nabob of Arcot, and to their servants, respecting the debt, yet they</HI> had never been able to trace the origin thereof, or to obtain any satisfactory information on the sub∣ject.</Q></P>
<P>The Court of Directors, after stating the circum∣stances under which the debts appeared to them to have been contracted, add as follows,
<Q>For these reasons
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>
we should have thought it our duty to enquire <HI>very minutely</HI> into those debts, even if the Act of Par∣liament had been silent on the subject, before we concurred in any measure for their payment. But with the positive injunctions of the Act before us, to examine into their nature and origin, we are in∣dispensably bound to direct such an enquiry to be in∣stituted.</Q>
They then order the President and Coun∣cil of Madras to enter into a full examination, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Directors having drawn up their order to the Pre∣sidency on these principles, communicated the draught of the general letter in which those orders were contain∣ed, to the Board of his Majesty's Ministers, and other servants, lately constituted by Mr. Pitt's East India Act. These Ministers who had just carried through Par∣liament the Bill ordering a specific enquiry, immediately drew up another letter, on a principle directly opposite to that, which was prescribed by the Act of Parliament, and followed by the Directors. In these second orders, all idea of an enquiry into the justice and origin of the pretended debts, particularly of the last, the greatest, and the most obnoxious to suspicion, is aban∣doned. They are all admitted and established with∣out any investigation whatsoever; except some private conference with the agents of the claimants is to pass for an investigation; and a fund for their discharge is assigned and set apart out of the revenues of the Carnatic.—To this arrangement in favour of their servants, servants suspected of corruption, and con∣victed of disobedience, the Directors of the East India Company were ordered to set their hands, asserting it to arise from their own conviction and opinion, in flat contradiction to their recorded sentiments, their strong remonstrance, and their declared sense of their duty, as well under their general trust and their oath as Directors, as under the express injunctions of an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="7"/>The principles upon which this summary proceed∣ing was adopted by the Ministerial Board, are stated by themselves in a number in the Appendix to this Speech.</P>
<P>By another section of the same Act, the same Court of Directors were ordered to take into consideration and to decide on the indeterminate rights of the Rajah of Tanjore and the Nabob of Arcot; and in this, as in the former case, no power of appeal, revision, or alteration was reserved to any other. It was a juris∣diction, in a cause between party and party, given to the Court of Directors specifically. It was known, that the territories of the former of these princes had been twice invaded and pillaged, and the prince de∣posed and imprisoned, by the Company's servants, in∣fluenced by the intrigues of the latter, and for the purpose of paying his pretended debts. The Company had, in the year <HI>1775,</HI> ordered a restoration of the Rajah to his government, under certain conditions. The Rajah complained that his territories had not been completely restored to him; and that no part of his goods, money, revenues, or records, unjustly taken and with-held from him, were ever returned. The Nabob, on the other hand, never ceased to claim the country itself, and carried on a continued train of negociation, that it should again be given up to him, in violation of the Company's public faith.</P>
<P>The Directors, in obedience to this part of the Act, ordered an enquiry, and came to a determination to restore certain of his territories to the Rajah. The Ministers proceeding as in the former case, without hearing any party, rescinded the decision of the Di∣rectors, refused the restitution of the territory, and without regard to the condition of the country of Tanjore, which had been within a few years four times plundered (twice by the Nabob of Arcot, and twice by enemies brought upon it solely by the politics of the same Nabob, the declared enemy of that people)
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/>
and without discounting a shilling for their sufferings, they accumulate an arrear of about <HI>400,000</HI> pounds of pretended tribute to this enemy; and then they order the Directors to put their hands to a new ad∣judication, directly contrary to a judgment, in a ju∣dicial character and trust, solemnly given by them, and entered on their records.</P>
<P>These proceedings naturally called for some enquiry. On the <HI>28</HI>th of February, <HI>1785,</HI> Mr. Fox made the following motion in the House of Commons, after moving that the clauses of the Act should be read—
<Q>That the proper officer do lay before this House copies and extracts of all letters and orders of the Court of Directors of the United East India Compa∣ny, in pursuance of the injunctions contained in the <HI>37</HI>th and <HI>38</HI>th clauses of the said Act; and the question being put, it passed in the negative by a very great majority.</Q></P>
<P>The last speech in the debate was the following; which is given to the public, not as being more wor∣thy of its attention than others (some of which were of consummate ability) but as entering more into the detail of the subject.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE times we live in, Mr. Speaker, have been distinguished by extraordinary events. Ha∣bituated, however, as we are, to uncommon com∣binations of men and of affairs, I believe nobody recollects any thing more surprising than the spec∣tacle of this day. The right honourable gentle∣man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Right honourable Henry Dundas.</NOTE>, whose conduct is now in question, formerly stood forth in this house, the prosecutor of the worthy baronet <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas Rumbold, late governor of Madras.</NOTE> who spoke after him. He charged him with several grievous acts of mal∣versation in office; with abuses of a public trust of a great and heinous nature. In less than two years we see the situation of the parties reversed; and a singular revolution puts the worthy baro∣net in a fair way of returning the prosecution in a recriminatory bill of Pains and Penalties, grounded on a breach of public trust, relative to the go∣vernment of the very same part of India. If he should undertake a bill of that kind, he will find no difficulty in conducting it with a degree of skill and vigour fully equal to all that have been ex∣erted against him.</P>
<P>But the change of relation between these two gentlemen is not so striking as the total difference
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
of their deportment under the same unhappy cir∣cumstances. Whatever the merits of the worthy baronet's defence might have been, he did not shrink from the charge. He met it with man∣liness of spirit, and decency of behaviour. What would have been thought of him, if he had held the present language of his old accuser? When ar∣ticles were exhibited against him by that right honourable gentleman, he did not think proper to tell the House that we ought to institute no en∣quiry, to inspect no paper, to examine no witness. He did not tell us (what at that time he might have told us with some shew of reason) that our concerns in India were matters of delicacy; that to divulge any thing relative to them would be mischievous to the state. He did not tell us, that those who would enquire into his proceedings were disposed to dismember the empire. He had not the presumption to say, that for his part, having ob∣tained in his Indian presidency, the ultimate object of his ambition, his honour was concerned in executing with integrity the trust which had been legally committed to his charge. That others, not having been so fortunate, could not be so disin∣terested; and therefore their accusations could spring from no other source than faction, and envy to his fortune.</P>
<P>Had he been frontless enough to hold such vain vapouring language in the face of a grave, a de∣tailed, a specified matter of accusation, whilst he violently resisted every thing which could bring the merits of his cause to the test; had he been wild enough to anticipate the absurdities of this day; that is, had he inferred, as his late accuser has thought proper to do, that he could not have been guilty of malversation in office, for this sole and curious reason, that he had been in office; had he argued the impossibility of his abusing his power on this
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
sole principle, that he had power to abuse, he would have left but one impression on the mind of every man who heard him, and who believed him in his senses—that in the utmost extent he was guilty of the charge.</P>
<P>But, Sir, leaving these two gentlemen to alter∣nate, as criminal and accuser, upon what principles they think expedient; it is for us to consider, Whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Treasurer of the Navy, acting as a Board of Control, are justified by law or policy, in sus∣pending the legal arrangements made by the Court of Directors, in order to transfer the pub∣lic revenues to the private emolument of certain servants of the East India Company, without the enquiry into the origin and justice of their claims, prescribed by an act of Parliament?</P>
<P>It is not contended, that the act of parliament did not expressly ordain an enquiry. It is not as∣serted that this enquiry was not, with equal pre∣cision of terms, specially committed under particular regulations to the Court of Directors. I conceive, therefore, the Board of Control had no right what∣soever to intermeddle in that business. There is nothing certain in the principles of jurisprudence, if this be not undeniably true, that when a special authority is given to any persons by name, to do some particular act, that no others, by virtue of general powers, can obtain a legal title to intrude themselves into that trust, and to exercise those special functions in their place. I therefore consider the intermeddling of ministers in this affair as a downright usurpation. But if the strained con∣struction, by which they have forced themselves into a suspicious office (which every man, delicate with regard to character, would rather have sought constructions to avoid) were perfectly sound and per∣fectly legal, of this I am certain, that they cannot be
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
justified in declining the enquiry which had been prescribed to the Court of Directors. If the Board of Control did lawfully possess the right of executing the special trust given to that court, they must take it as they found it, subject to the very same regu∣lations which bound the Court of Directors. It will be allowed that the Court of Directors had no au∣thority to dispense with either the substance, or the mode of enquiry prescribed by the act of parliament. If they had not, where, in the act, did the Board of Control acquire that capacity? Indeed, it was im∣possible they should acquire it.—What must we think of the fabric and texture of an act of par∣liament which should find it necessary to prescribe a strict inquisition; that should descend into minute re∣gulations for the conduct of that inquisition; that should commit this trust to a particular description of men, and in the very same breath should enable an∣other body, at their own pleasure, to superfede all the provisions the legislature had made, and to defeat the whole purpose, end, and object of the law? This cannot be supposed even of an act of parliament conceived by the Ministers themselves, and brought forth during the delirium of the last session.</P>
<P>My honourable friend has told you in the speech which introduced his motion, that fortunately this question is not a great deal involved in the laby∣rinths of Indian detail. Certainly not. But if it were, I beg leave to assure you, that there is nothing in the Indian detail which is more difficult than in the detail of any other business. I admit, because I have some experience of the fact, that for the in∣terior regulation of India, a minute knowledge of India is requisite. But on any specific matter of delinquency in its government, you are as capable of judging, as if the same thing were done at your door. Fraud, injustice, oppression, peculation, en∣gendered in India, are crimes of the same blood,
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
family, and cast, with those that are born and bred in England. To go no farther than the case before us; you are just as competent to judge whether the sum of four millions sterling ought, or ought not, to be passed from the public treasury into a private pocket, without any title except the claim of the parties, when the issue of fact is laid in Madras, as when it is laid in Westminster. Terms of art, indeed, are different in different places; but they are gene∣rally understood in none. The technical style of an Indian treasury, is not one jot more remote than the jargon of our own exchequer, from the train of our ordinary ideas, or the idiom of our common lan∣guage. The difference therefore in the two cases, is not in the comparative difficulty or facility of the two subjects, but in our attention to the one, and our total neglect of the other. Had this attention and neglect been regulated by the value of the se∣veral objects, there would be nothing to complain of. But the reverse of that supposition is true. The scene of the Indian abuse is distant indeed; but we must not infer, that the value of our interest in it is decreased in proportion as it recedes from our view. In our politics, as in our common con∣duct, we shall be worse than infants, if we do not put our senses under the tuition of our judgment, and effectually cure ourselves of that optical illusion, which makes a briar at our nose of greater magni∣tude, than an oak at five hundred yards distance.</P>
<P>I think I can trace all the calamities of this coun∣try to the single source of our not having had stea∣dily before our eyes a general, comprehensive, well-connected, and well-proportioned view of the whole of our dominions, and a just sense of their true bearings and relations. After all its reductions, the British empire is still vast and various. After all the reductions of the House of Commons, (stripped as we are of our brightest ornaments, and
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
of our most important privileges) enough are yet left to furnish us, if we please, with means of shew∣ing to the world, that we deserve the superintend∣ance of as large an empire as this kingdom ever held, and the continuance of as ample privileges as the House of Commons, in the plenitude of its power, had been habituated to assert. But if we make ourselves too little for the sphere of our duty; if, on the contrary, we do not stretch and expand our minds to the compass of their object, be well assured, that every thing about us will dwindle by degrees, until at length our concerns are shrunk to the dimensions of our minds. It is not a predilection to mean, sordid, home-bred cares, that will avert the consequences of a false estimation of our interest, or prevent the shameful dilapidation into which a great empire must fall, by mean reparations upon mighty ruins.</P>
<P>I confess I feel a degree of disgust, almost lead∣ing to despair, at the manner in which we are act∣ing in the great exigencies of our country. There is now a bill in this house, appointing a rigid inqui∣sition into the minutest detail of our offices at home. The collection of sixteen millions annu∣ally; a collection on which the public greatness, safety, and credit have their reliance; the whole order of criminal jurisprudence, which holds toge∣ther society itself, have at no time obliged us to call forth such powers; no, nor any thing like them. There is not a principle of the law and constitution of this country that is not subverted to favour the execution of that project <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.</NOTE>. And for what is all this apparatus of bustle and terror? Is it because any thing substantial is expected from it? No. The stir and bustle itself is the end proposed. The eye-servants of a short-sighted master will em∣ploy
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
themselves, not on what is most essential to his affairs, but on what is nearest to his ken. Great difficulties have given a just value to oeconomy; and our minister of the day must be an oeconomist, whatever it may cost us. But where is he to exert his talents? At home to be sure; for where else can he obtain a profitable credit for their exertion? It is nothing to him, whether the object on which he works under our eye be promising or not. If he does not obtain any public benefit, he may make regulations without end. Those are sure to pay in present expectation, whilst the effect is at a distance, and may be the concern of other times, and other men. On these principles he chooses to suppose (for he does not pretend more than to suppose) a naked possibility, that he shall draw some resource out of crumbs dropped from the trenchers of penury; that something shall be laid in store from the short allowance of revenue officers, overloaded with duty, and famished for want of bread; by a reduction from officers who are at this very hour ready to batter the treasury with what breaks through stone walls, for an <HI>increase</HI> of their appointments. From the marrowless bones of these skeleton establishments, by the use of every sort of cutting, and of every sort of fretting tool, he flatters himself that he may chip and rasp an empirical alimentary powder, to diet into some similitude of health and substance the languishing chimeras of fraudulent reformation.</P>
<P>Whilst he is thus employed according to his po∣licy and to his taste, he has not leisure to enquire into those abuses in India that are drawing off mo∣ney by millions from the treasures of this country, which are exhausting the vital juices from mem∣bers of the state, where the public inanition is far more sorely felt than in the local exchequer of England. Not content with winking at these
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
abuses, whilst he attempts to squeeze the laborious ill-paid drudges of English revenue, he lavishes in one act of corrupt prodigality, upon those who never served the public in any honest occupation at all, an annual income equal to two thirds of the whole collection of the revenues of this king∣dom.</P>
<P>Actuated by the same principle of choice, he has now on the anvil another scheme, full of dif∣ficulty and desperate hazard, which totally alters the commercial relation of two kingdoms; and what end soever it shall have, may bequeath a legacy of heart-burning and discontent to one of the countries, perhaps to both, to be perpetuated to the latest posterity. This project is also under∣taken on the hope of profit. It is provided, that out of some (I know not what) remains of the Irish hereditary revenue, a fund at some time, and of some sort, should be applied to the protection of the Irish trade. Here we are commanded again to task our faith, and to persuade ourselves, that out of the surplus of deficiency, out of the savings of habitual and systematic prodigality, the minister of wonders will provide support for this nation, sinking under the mountainous load of two hundred and thirty millions of debt. But whilst we look with pain at his desperate and laborious trifling; whilst we are apprehensive that he will break his back in stooping to pick up chaff and straws, he recovers himself at an elastic bound, and with a broad-cast swing of his arm, he squanders over his Indian field a sum far greater than the clear pro∣duce of the whole hereditary revenue of the king∣dom of Ireland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of the net Irish hereditary revenue is, on a medium of the last seven years, about £ 330,000 yearly. The revenues of all denominations fall short more than £ 150,000 yearly of the charges. On the <HI>present</HI> produce, if Mr. Pitt's scheme was to take place, he might gain from seven to ten thousand pounds a year.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17"/>Strange as this scheme of conduct in ministry is, and inconsistent with all just policy, it is still true to itself, and faithful to its own perverted order. Those who are bountiful to crimes, will be rigid to merit, and penurious to service. Their penury is even held out as a blind and cover to their prodi∣gality. The oeconomy of injustice is, to furnish resources for the fund of corruption. Then they pay off their protection to great crimes and great criminals, by being nexorable to the paltry frailties of little men; and these modern flagellants are sure, with a rigid fidelity, to whip their own enormities on the vicarious back of every small offender.</P>
<P>It is to draw your attention to oeconomy of quite another order; it is to animadvert on offences of a far different description, that my honourable friend has brought before you the motion of this day. It is to perpetuate the abuses which are subverting the fabric of your empire, that the motion is opposed. It is therefore with reason (and if he has power to carry himself through, I commend his prudence) that the right honourable gentleman makes his stand at the very outset; and boldly refuses all parliamentary information. Let him admit but one step towards enquiry, and he is undone. You must be ignorant, or he cannot be safe. But before his curtain is let down, and the shades of eternal night shall veil our eastern dominions from our view, permit me, Sir, to avail myself of the means which were furnished in anxious and inquisitive times, to demonstrate out of this single act of the present Minister, what advantages you are to derive from permitting the greatest concern of this nation to be separated from the cognizance, and exempted
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
even out of the competence, of parliament. The greatest body of your revenue, your most nume∣rous armies, your most important commerce, the richest sources of your public credit, (contrary to every idea of the known settled policy of Eng∣land) are on the point of being converted into a mystery of state. You are going to have one half of the globe hid even from the common liberal curiosity of an English gentleman. Here a grand revolution commences. Mark the period, and mark the circumstances. In most of the capital changes that are recorded in the principles and system of any government, a public benefit of some kind or other has been pretended. The re∣volution commenced in something plausible; in something which carried the appearance at least of punishment of delinquency, or correction of abuse. But here, in the very moment of the conversion of a department of British government into an Indian mystery, and in the very act in which the change commences, a corrupt, private interest is set up in direct opposition to the neces∣sities of the nation. A diversion is made of mil∣lions of the public money from the public treasury to a private purse. It is not into secret negoci∣ations for war, peace, or alliance, that the House of Commons is forbidden to enquire. It is a mat∣ter of account; it is a pecuniary transaction; it is the demand of a suspected steward upon ruined te∣nants and an embarrassed master, that the Com∣mons of Great Britain are commanded not to in∣spect. The whole tenor of the right honourable gentleman's argument is consonant to the nature of his policy. The system of concealment is fostered by a system of falsehood. False facts, false colours, false names of persons and things, are its whole support.</P>
<P>Sir, I mean to follow the right honourable gen∣tleman
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
over that field of deception, clearing what he has purposely obscured, and fairly stating what it was necessary for him to misrepresent. For this purpose, it is necessary you should know with some degree of distinctness, a little of the locality, the nature, the circumstances, the magnitude of the pretended debts on which this marvellous dona∣tion is founded, as well as of the persons from whom and by whom it is claimed.</P>
<P>Madras, with its dependencies, is the second (but with a long interval, the second) member of the British empire in the East. The trade of that city, and of the adjacent territory, was, not very long ago, among the most flourishing in Asia. But since the establishment of the British power, it has wasted away under an uniform gradual de∣cline; insomuch that in the year 1779 not one mer∣chant of eminence was to be found in the whole country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Smith's examination before the Select Committee, Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 2.</NOTE>. During this period of decay, about six hundred thousand sterling pounds a year have been drawn off by English gentlemen on their private account, by the way of China alone <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 2.</NOTE>. If we add four hundred thousand, as probably re∣mitted through other channels, and in other me∣diums, that is, in jewels, gold, and silver directly brought to Europe, and in bills upon the British and foreign companies, you will scarcely think the matter over-rated. If we six the commencement of this extraction of money from the Carnatic at a period no earlier than the year 1760, and close it in the year 1780, it probably will not amount to a great deal less than twenty millions of money.</P>
<P>During the deep silent flow of this steady stream of wealth, which set from India into Europe, it
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
generally passed on with no adequate observation; but happening at some periods to meet rifts of rocks that checked its course, it grew more noisy, and attracted more notice. The pecuniary discus∣sions caused by an accumulation of part of the for∣tunes of their servants in a debt from the Nabob of Arcot, was the first thing which very particularly called for, and long engaged, the attention of the Court of Directors. This debt amounted to eight hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling, and was claimed, for the greater part, by English gen∣tlemen, residing at Madras. This grand capital, settled at length by order, at ten <HI>per cent.</HI> af∣forded an annuity of eighty-eight thousand pounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fourth Report, Mr. Dundas's Committee, p. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst the Directors were digesting their asto∣nishment at this information, a memorial was pre∣sented to them from three gentlemen, informing them that their friends had lent likewise, to mer∣chants of Canton in China, a sum of not more than one million sterling. In this memorial they called upon the Company for their assistance and interposition with the Chinese government for the recovery of the debt. This sum lent to Chinese merchants, was at 24 <HI>per cent.</HI> which would yield, if paid, an annuity of two hundred and forty thou∣sand pounds <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A witness examined before the Committee of Secrecy says, that eighteen <HI>per Cent.</HI> was the usual interest; but he had heard that more had been given. The above is the account which Mr. B. received.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Perplexed as the Directors were with these de∣mands, you may conceive, Sir, that they did not find themselves very much disembarrassed, by being made acquainted that they must again exert their influence for a new reserve of the happy parsimony of their servants, collected into a second debt from
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
the Nabob of Arcot, amounting to two millions four hundred thousand pounds, settled at an inte∣rest of 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> This is known by the name of the Consolidation of 1777, as the former of the Nabob's debts was by the title of the Consolidation of 1767. To this was added, in a separate parcel, a little reserve called the Cavalry Debt, of one hundred and sixty thousand pounds, at the same interest. The whole of these four capitals, amounting to four millions four hundred and forty thousand pounds, produced at their several rates, an∣nuities amounting to six hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds a year; a good deal more than one third of the clear land-tax of England, at four shillings in the pound; a good deal more than double the whole annual dividend of the East India Company, the nominal masters to the proprietors in these funds. Of this interest, three hundred and eighty-three thousand two hundred pound a year stood chargeable on the public revenues of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Sir, at this moment, it will not be necessary to consider the various operations which the capital and interest of this debt have successively undergone. I shall speak to these operations when I come par∣ticularly to answer the right honourable gentleman on each of the heads, as he has thought proper to di∣vide them. But this was the exact view in which these debts first appeared to the Court of Directors, and to the world. It varied afterwards. But it never appeared in any other than a most questionable shape. When this gigantic phantom of debt first appeared before a young minister, it naturally would have justified some degree of doubt and apprehension. Such a prodigy would have filled any common man with superstitious fears. He would exorcise that shapeless, nameless form, and by every thing sacred would have adjured it to tell by what means
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
a small number of slight individuals, of no con∣sequence or situation, possessed of no lucrative offices, without the command of armies, or the known administration of revenues, without pro∣fession of any kind, without any sort of trade suffi∣cient to employ a pedlar, could have, in a few years (as to some even in a few months) have amassed treasures equal to the revenues of a re∣spectable kingdom? Was it not enough to put these gentlemen, in the noviciate of their adminis∣tration, on their guard, and to call upon them for a strict enquiry (if not to justify them in a re∣probation of those demands without any enquiry at all) that when all England, Scotland, and Ireland, had for years been witness to the immense sums laid out by the servants of the Company in stocks of all denominations, in the purchase of lands, in the buy∣ing and building of houses, in the securing quiet seats in parliament, or in the tumultuous riot of contested elections, in wandering throughout the whole range of those variegated modes of inventive prodigality; which sometimes have excited our wonder, sometimes roused our indignation; that after all India was four millions still in debt to <HI>them?</HI> India in debt to <HI>them!</HI> For what? Every debt for which an equivalent of some kind or other is not given, is on the face of it a fraud. What is the equivalent they have given? What equivalent had they to give? What are the articles of com∣merce, or the branches of manufacture which those gentlemen have carried hence to enrich India? What are the sciences they beamed out to en∣lighten it? What are the arts they introduced to chear and to adorn it? What are the religious, what the moral institutions they have taught among that people as a guide to life, or as a consolation when life is to be no more, that there is an eternal debt, a debt "still paying, still to owe," which must
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
be bound on the present generation in India, and en∣tailed on their mortgaged posterity for ever? A debt of millions, in favour of a set of men, whose names, with few exceptions, are either buried in the obscurity of their origin and talents, or dragged into light by the enormity of their crimes?</P>
<P>In my opinion the courage of the minister was the most wonderful part of the transaction, espe∣cially as he must have read, or rather the right ho∣nourable gentleman says, he has read for him, whole volumes upon the subject. The volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part so numerous as the right honourable, gentleman has thought proper to pretend, in order to frighten you from enquiry; but in these volumes, such as they are, the minister must have found a full authority for a suspicion (at the very least) of every thing relative to the great fortunes made at Madras. What is that authority? Why no other than the standing authority for all the claims which the Ministry has thought fit to provide for—the grand debtor— the Nabob of Arcot himself. Hear that Prince, in the letter written to the Court of Directors, at the precise period, whilst the main body of these debts were contracting. In his Letter he states himself to be, what undoubtedly he is, a most competent witness to this point. After speaking of the war with Hyder Ali in 1768 and 1769, and of other measures which he censures (whether right or wrong it signifies nothing) and into which he says he had been led by the Company's servants; he proceeds in this manner—
<Q><HI>If all these things were against the real interests of the Company, they are ten thousand times more against mine, and against the prosperity of my country, and the happiness of my people; for your interests and mine are the same.</HI> What were they owing to then? to the private views of a few individuals, who have
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
enriched themselves at the expence of your influence, and of my country; for your servants HAVE NO TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY; neither do you pay them high wages, yet in a few years they return to England, with many lacks of pagodas. How can you or I account for such immense fortunes, acquired in so short a time, without any visible means of getting them?</Q></P>
<P>When he asked this question, which involves its answer, it is extraordinary that curiosity did not prompt the Chancellor of the Exchequer to that enquiry which might come in vain recom∣mended to him by his own act of parliament. Does not the Nabob of Arcot tell us in so many words, that there was no fair way of making the enormous sums sent by the Company's servants to England? and do you imagine that there was or could be more honesty and good faith in the de∣mands, for what remained behind in India? Of what nature were the transactions with himself? If you follow the train of his information you must see, that if these great sums were at all lent, it was not property, but spoil that was lent; if not lent, the transaction was not a contract, but a fraud. Either way, if light enough could not be furnished to authorise a full condemnation of these demands, they ought to have been left to the parties who best knew and understood each others proceedings. It was not necessary that the authority of government should interpose in favour of claims, whose very foundation was a defiance of that authority, and whose object and end was its entire subversion.</P>
<P>It may be said that this letter was written by the Nabob of Arcot in a moody humour, under the influence of some chagrin. Certainly it was; but it is in such humours that truth comes out. And when he tells you from his own knowledge, what every one must presume, from the extreme
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
probability of the thing, whether he told it or not, one such testimony is worth a thousand that contradict that probability, when the parties have a better understanding with each other, and when they have a point to carry, that may unite them in a common deceit.</P>
<P>If this body of private claims of debt, real or de∣vised, were a question, as it is falsely pretended, be∣tween the Nabob of Arcot as debtor, and Paul Benfield and his associates as creditors, I am sure I should give myself but little trouble about it. If the hoards of oppression were the fund for satisfy∣ing the claims of bribery and peculation, who would wish to interfere between such litigants? If the demands were confined to what might be drawn from the treasures which the Company's records uniformly assert that the Nabob is in possession of; or if he had mines of gold or silver, or diamonds (as we know that he has none) these gentlemen might break open his hoards, or dig in his mines, without any disturbance from me. But the gentlemen on the other side of the House know as well as I do, and they dare not contradict me, that the Nabob of Arcot and his creditors are not adversaries, but collusive parties, and that the whole transaction is under a false colour and false names. The litigation is not, nor ever has been, between their rapacity and his hoarded riches. No; it is between him and them combining and con∣federating on one side, and the public revenues, and the miserable inhabitants of a ruined country, on the other. These are the real plaintiffs and the real defendants in the suit. Refusing a shilling from his hoards for the satisfaction of any demand, the Nabob of Arcot is always ready, nay, he earnestly, and with eagerness and passion, contends for de∣livering up to these pretended creditors his territory and his subjects. It is therefore not from trea∣suries
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
and mines, but from the food of your unpaid armies, from the blood withheld from the veins, and whipt out of the backs of the most miserable of men, that we are to pamper extortion, usury, and peculation, under the false names of debtors and creditors of state.</P>
<P>The great patron of these creditors (to whose honour they ought to erect statues) the right ho∣nourable Gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE>, in stating the merits which recommended them to his favour, has ranked them under three grand divisions. The first, the creditors of 1767; then the creditors of the Ca∣valry Loan; and lastly, the creditors of the Loan in 1777. Let us examine them, one by one, as they pass in review before us.</P>
<P>The first of these loans, that of 1767, he insists, has an indisputable claim upon the public justice. The creditors, he affirms, lent their money publicly; they advanced it with the express knowledge and approbation of the Company; and it was contract∣ed at the moderate interest of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> In this loan the demand is, according to him, not only just, but meritorious in a very high degree; and one would be inclined to believe he thought so, because he has put it last in the provision he has made for these claims.</P>
<P>I readily admit this debt to stand the fairest of the whole; for whatever may be my suspicious concerning a part of it, I can convict it of no∣thing worse than the most enormous usury. But I can convict upon the spot the Right honour∣able Gentleman, of the most daring misrepresenta∣tion in every one fact, without any exception, that he has alledged in defence of this loan, and of his own conduct with regard to it. I will shew you that this debt was never contracted with the know∣ledge
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
of the Company; that it had not their ap∣probation; that they received the first intelligence of it with the utmost possible surprize, indignation, and alarm.</P>
<P>So far from being previously apprized of the transaction from its origin, that it was two years before the Court of Directors obtained any official intelligence of it.
<Q>The dealings of the servants with the Nabob were concealed from the first, until they were found out, (says Mr. Sayer, the Company's council) by the report of the country.</Q>
The Presidency, however, at last thought proper to send an official account. On this the Directors tell them,
<Q>to your great reproach it has been <HI>con∣cealed from us.</HI> We cannot but suspect this debt to have had its weight in <HI>your proposed aggran∣dizement of Mahomed Ali</HI> [the Nabob of Arcot]; but whether it has or has not, certain it is, you are guilty of an high breach of duty in <HI>con∣cealing</HI> it from us.</Q></P>
<P>These expressions, concerning the ground of the transaction, its effect, and its clandestine na∣ture, are in the letters, bearing date March 17, 1769. After receiving a more full account on the 23d March 1770, they state, that
<Q>Messrs. John Pybus, John Call, and James Bour∣chier, as trustees for themselves and others of the Nabob's private creditors, had proved a deed of assignment upon the Nabob and his son of FIFTEEN districts of the Nabob's coun∣try, the revenues of which yielded, in time of peace, eight lacks of pagodas [£.320,000, ster∣ling] annually; and likewise an assignment of the yearly tribute paid the Nabob from the Rajah of Tanjore, amounting to four lacks of rupees [£.40,000].</Q>
The territorial revenue, at that time possessed by these gentlemen, without the knowledge or consent of their masters, amounted
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
to three hundred and sixty thousand pound ster∣ling annually. They were making rapid strides to the entire possession of the country, when the Directors, whom the right honourable gentleman states as having authorised these proceedings, were kept in such profound ignorance of this royal acquisition of territorial revenue by their servants, that in the same letter they say,
<Q>this assign∣ment was obtained by <HI>three of the members of your Board,</HI> in January 1767, yet we do not find the <HI>least trace</HI> of it upon your Consultations, until August 1768, nor do any of your letters to us afford any information relative to such transac∣tions, till the 1st of November 1768. By your last letters of the 8th of May 1769, you bring the whole proceedings to light in one view.</Q></P>
<P>As to the previous knowledge of the Com∣pany, and its sanction to the debts, you see that this assertion of that knowledge is utterly un∣founded. But did the Directors approve of it, and ratify the transaction when it was known? The very reverse. On the same 3d of March, the Directors declare,
<Q>upon an <HI>impartial examination</HI> of the whole conduct of our late Governor and Council of Fort George (Madras) and on the fullest consideration, that the said Governor and Council have, <HI>in notorious violation of the trust</HI> re∣posed in them, manifestly <HI>preserred the interest of private individuals to that of the Company,</HI> in per∣mitting the assignment of the revenues of certain valuable districts, to a very large amount, from the Nabob to individuals</Q>
—and then highly aggra∣vating their crimes, they add
<Q>we order and direct that you do examine, in the most impartial man∣ner, all the above-mentioned transactions; and that you <HI>punish</HI> by suspension, degradation, dis∣mission, or otherwise, as to you shall seem meet, all and every such servant or servants of the Com∣pany,
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
who may by you be found guilty of any of the above offences.</Q>
<Q>We had (say the Di∣rectors) the mortification to find that the servants of the Company, who had been <HI>raised, supported, and owed their present opulence to the advantages</HI> gained in such service, have in this instance most <HI>unfaithfully betrayed</HI> their trust, <HI>abandoned</HI> the Company's interest, and <HI>prostituted</HI> its influence to accomplish the <HI>purposes of individuals, whilst the interest of the Company is almost wholly neglected,</HI> and payment to us rendered extremely preca∣rious.</Q>
Here then is the rock of approbation of the Court of Directors, on which the right ho∣nourable gentleman says this debt was founded. Any Member, Mr. Speaker, who should come into the House, on my reading this sentence of condemnation of the Court of Directors against their unfaithful servants, might well imagine that he had heard an harsh, severe, unqualified invective against the present ministerial Board of Control. So exactly do the proceedings of the patrons of this abuse tally with those of the actors in it, that the expres∣sions used in the condemnation of the one, may serve for the reprobation of the other, without the change of a word.</P>
<P>To read you all the expressions of wrath and in∣dignation fulminated in this dispatch against the meritorious creditors of the right honourable gen∣tleman, who according to him have been so fully approved by the Company, would be to read the whole.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman, with an address peculiar to himself, every now and then slides in the Presidency of Madras, as synonymous to the Company. That the Presidency did approve the debt, is certain. But the right honourable gentle∣man, as prudent in suppressing, as skilful in bring∣ing forward his matter, has not chosen to tell you
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
that the Presidency were the very persons guilty of contracting this loan; creditors themselves, and agents, and trustees for all the other creditors. For this the Court of Directors accuse them of breach of trust; and for this the right honourable gentleman considers them as perfectly good autho∣rity for those claims. It is pleasant to hear a gentleman of the law quote the approbation of creditors as an authority for their own debt.</P>
<P>How they came to contract the debt to them∣selves, how they came to act as agents for those whom they ought to have controlled, is for your enquiry. The policy of this debt was announced to the Court of Directors, by the very persons con∣cerned in creating it.
<Q>Till very lately, (say the Presidency) the Nabob placed his depen∣dence on the Company. Now he has been taught by ill-advisers, that an interest out of doors may stand him in good stead. He has been made to believe that <HI>his private creditors have power and interest to over-rule the Court of Directors</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the threats of the creditors, and total subversion of the authority of the Company in favour of the Nabob's power, and the encrease thereby of his evil dispositions, and the great derangement of all public concerns, see Select Committee Fort St. George's letters, 21st November 1769, and January 31st, 1770; September 11, 1772. And Gover∣nor Bourchier's letters to the Nabob of Arcot, 21st November 1769, and December 9th, 1769.</NOTE>.</Q>
The Nabob was not misin∣formed. The private creditors instantly qualified a vast number of votes; and having made them∣selves masters of the Court of Proprietors, as well as extending a powerful cabal in other places as important, they so completely overturned the au∣thority of the Court of Directors at home and abroad, that this poor baffled government was soon obliged to lower its tone. It was glad to be ad∣mitted into a partnership with its own servants.
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
The Court of Directors establishing the debt which they had reprobated as a breach of trust, and which was planned for the subversion of their authority, settled its payments on a par with those of the pub∣lic; and even so, were not able to obtain peace or even equality in their demands. All the conse∣quences lay in a regular and irresistible train. By employing their influence for the recovery of this debt, their orders, issued in the same breath, against creating new debts, only animated the strong desires of their servants to this prohibited prolific sport, and it soon produced a swarm of sons and daugh∣ters, not in the least degenerated from the virtue of their parents.</P>
<P>From that moment, the authority of the Court of Directors expired in the Carnatic, and every where else. <Q>Every man, says the Presidency, who opposes the government and its measures, finds an immediate countenance from the Na∣bob, even our discarded officers, however un∣worthy, are received into the Nabob's service <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>He [the Nabob] is in a great degree the cause of our present inability; by diverting the revenues of the Carnatic through <HI>private channels.</HI></Q>
—
<Q>Even this Peshcush [the Tanjore tribute] circumstanced as he and we are, he has assigned over to others, <HI>who now set themselves in opposition to the Company.</HI></Q>
Consultations, October 11, 1769, on the 12th communicated to the Nabob.</NOTE>.</Q>
It was indeed a matter of no wonderful sagacity to determine whether the Court of Directors, with their miserable salaries to their servants, of four or five hundred pound a year, or the distributor of mil∣lions, was most likely to be obeyed. It was an in∣vention beyond the imagination of all the specu∣latists of our speculating age, to see a govern∣ment quietly settled in one and the same town, composed of two distinct members; one to pay scantily for obedience, and the other to bribe high for rebellion and revolt.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="32"/>The next thing which recommends this particu∣lar debt to the right honourable gentleman, is, it seems, the moderate interest of ten <HI>per cent.</HI> It would be lost labour to observe on this as∣sertion. The Nabob, in a long apologetic letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Letter to Governor Palk. Papers published by the Directors in 1775; papers printed by the same au∣thority, 1781.</NOTE> for the transaction between him and the body of the creditors, states the fact, as I shall state it to you. In the accumulation of this debt, the first interest paid was from thirty, to thirty-six <HI>per cent.</HI> it was then brought down to twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> at length it was reduced to twenty; and there it found its rest. During the whole process, as often as any of these monstrous interests fell into an ar∣rear (into which they were continually falling) the arrear, formed into a new capital<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Papers printed by order of a General Court in 1780, p. 222, and p. 224, as also Nabob's letter to Governor Duprè, 19th July 1771,
<Q>I have taken up loans by which I have suffered a loss of <HI>upwards of a crore of pagodas</HI> [four mil∣lion sterling] <HI>by interest on an heavy interest.</HI></Q>
—Letter 15th "January, 1772,
<Q>Notwithstanding I have taken much trouble, and have made many payments to my creditors, yet the load of my debt, <HI>which became so great, by interest and compound interest,</HI> is not cleared.</Q></NOTE>, was added to the old, and the same interest of twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> accrued upon both. The Company, having got some scent of the enormous usury which prevailed at Madras, thought it necessary to interfere, and to order all interests to be lowered to ten <HI>per cent.</HI> This order, which contained no exception, though it by no means pointed particularly to this class of debts, came like a thunder-clap on the Nabob. He considered his political credit as ruined; but to find a remedy to this unexpected evil, he again ad∣ded to the old principal twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> interest accruing for the last year. Thus a new fund was formed; and it was on that accumulation of va∣rious principals, and interests heaped upon interests,
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
not on the sum originally lent, as the right ho∣nourable Gentleman would make you believe, that ten <HI>per cent.</HI> was settled on the whole.</P>
<P>When you consider the enormity of the interest at which these debts were contracted, and the se∣veral interests added to the principal, I believe you will not think me so sceptical, if I should doubt, whether for this debt of £. 880,000, the Nabob ever saw £. 100,000 in real money. The right honourable gentleman suspecting, with all his absolute domi∣nion over fact, that he never will be able to defend even this venerable patriarchal job, though sanctified by its numerous issue, and hoary with prescriptive years, has recourse to recrimination, the last resource of guilt. He says that this loan of 1767 was provided for in Mr. Fox's India bill; and judging of others by his own nature and principles, he more than insi∣nuates, that this provision was made, not from any sense of merit in the claim, but from partiality to General Smith, a proprietor, and an agent for that debt. If partiality could have had any weight against justice and policy, with the then ministers and their friends, General Smith had titles to it. But the right honourable gentleman knows as well as I do, that General Smith was very far from looking on himself as partially treated in the ar∣rangements of that time; indeed what man dared to hope for private partiality in that sacred plan for relief to nations?</P>
<P>It is not necessary that the right honourable gentleman should sarcastically call that time to our recollection. Well do I remember every circum∣stance of that memorable period. God forbid I should forget it. O illustrious disgrace! O victo∣rious defeat! May your memorial be fresh and new to the latest generations! May the day of that ge∣nerous conflict be stamped in characters never to be cancelled or worn out from the records of time!
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
Let no man hear of us, who shall not hear that in a struggle against the intrigues of courts, and the perfidious levity of the multitude, we fell in the cause of honour, in the cause of our country, in the cause of human nature itself! But if Fortune should be as powerful over Fame, as she has been prevalent over Virtue, at least our conscience is beyond her jurisdiction. My poor share in the support of that great measure, no man shall ravish from me. It shall be safely lodged in the sanctuary of my heart; never, never to be torn from thence, but with those holds that grapple it to life.</P>
<P>I say, I well remember that bill, and every one of its honest and its wise provisions. It is not true that this debt was ever protected or inforced, or any revenue whatsoever set apart for it. It was left in that bill just where it stood; to be paid or not to be paid out of the Nabob's private treasures, ac∣cording to his own discretion. The Company had actually given it their sanction; though always re∣lying for its validity on the sole security of the faith of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Nabob of Arcot.</NOTE> who without their knowlege or consent entered into the original obligation. It had no other sanction; it ought to have had no other. So far was Mr. Fox's bill from provid∣ing <HI>funds</HI> for it, as this ministry have wickedly done for this, and for ten times worse transac∣tions, out of the public estate, that an express clause immediately preceded, positively forbidding any British subject from receiving assignments upon any part of the territorial revenue, on any pretence whatsoever <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>You recollect, Mr. Speaker, that the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer strongly professed to retain every part of Mr. Fox's bill, which was
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
intended to prevent abuse; but in <HI>his</HI> India bill, which (let me do justice) is as able and skilful a performance for its own purposes, as ever issued from the wit of man, premeditating this ini∣quity—<HI>hoc ipsum ut strueret Trojamque aperiret Achivis,</HI> expunged this essential clause, broke down the fence which was raised to cover the pub∣lic property against the rapacity of his partizans, and thus levelling every obstruction, he made a firm, broad, highway for sin and death, for usury and oppression, to renew their ravages throughout the devoted revenues of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>The tenor, the policy, and the consequences of this debt of 1767, are, in the eyes of Ministry, so excellent, that its merits are irresistible; and it takes the lead to give credit and countenance to all the rest. Along with this chosen body of heavy-armed infantry, and to support it, in the line, the right honourable gentleman has stationed his corps of black cavalry. If there be any advantage between this debt and that of 1769, according to him the cavalry debt has it. It is not a subject of defence; it is a theme of panegyric. Listen to the right ho∣nourable gentleman, and you will find it was con∣tracted to save the country; to prevent mutiny in armies; to introduce oeconomy in revenues; and for all these honourable purposes, it originated at the express desire, and by the representative autho∣rity of the Company itself.</P>
<P>First, let me say a word to the authority. This debt was contracted not by the authority of the Company, not by its representatives (as the right honourable Gentleman has the unparalleled con∣fidence to assert) but in the ever-memorable period of 1777, by the usurped power of those who re∣belliously, in conjunction with the Nabob of Ar∣cot, had overturned the lawful government of Madras. For that rebellion, this House unani∣mously
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
directed a public prosecution. The delin∣quents, after they had subverted Government, in order to make to themselves a party to support them in their power, are universally known to have dealt jobs about to the right and to the left, and to any who were willing to receive them. This usurpation, which the right honourable Gentleman well knows, was brought about by and for the great mass of these pretended debts, is the authority which is set up by him to repre∣sent the Company; to represent that Company which from the first moment of their hearing of this corrupt and fraudulent transaction, to this hour, have uniformly disowned and disavowed it.</P>
<P>So much for the authority. As to the facts, partly true, and partly colourable, as they stand record∣ed, they are in substance these.—The Nabob of Arcot, as soon as he had thrown off the superio∣rity of this country by means of these creditors, kept up a great army which he never paid. Of course, his soldiers were generally in a state of muti∣ny <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Dundas's 1st, 2d, and 3d Reports.</NOTE>. The usurping council say that they laboured hard with their master the Nabob, to persuade him to reduce these mutinous and useless troops. He consented; but as usual, pleaded inability to pay them their arrears. Here was a difficulty. The Na∣bob had no money; the Company had no money; every public supply was empty. But there was one resource which no season has ever yet dried up in that climate. The <HI>soucars</HI> were at hand; that is, private English money-jobbers offered their assist∣ance. Messieurs Taylor, Majendie and Call, pro∣posed to advance the small sum of £. 160,000 to pay off the Nabob's black cavalry, provided the Company's authority was given for their loan. This was the great point of policy always aimed
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
at, and pursued through a hundred devices, by the servants at Madras. The Presidency, who them∣selves had no authority for the functions they pre∣sumed to exercise, very readily gave the sanction of the Company, to those servants who knew that the Company, whose sanction was demanded, had positively prohibited all such transactions.</P>
<P>However, so far as the reality of the dealing goes, all is hitherto fair and plausible; and here the right honourable Gentleman concludes, with commend∣able prudence, his account of the business. But here it is I shall beg leave to commence my sup∣plement: for the gentleman's discreet modesty has led him to cut the thread of the story somewhat abruptly. One of the most essential parties is quite forgotten. Why should the episode of the poor Nabob be omitted? When that prince chuses it, no body can tell his story better. Excuse me, if I apply again to my book, and give it you from the first hand; from the Nabob himself.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Stratton became acquainted with this, and got Mr. Taylor and others to lend me four lacks of pagodas towards discharging the arrears of pay of my troops. Upon this, I wrote a letter of thanks to Mr. Stratton; and upon the faith of this money being paid immediately, I ordered many of my troops to be discharged by a certain day, and lessened the number of my servants. Mr. Taylor, &amp;c. some time after acquainted me, that they had no ready money, but they would grant teeps payable in four months. This astonished me; for I did not know what might happen, when the sepoys were dismissed from my service. I begged of Mr. Tay∣lor and the others to pay this sum to the officers of my regiments at the time they mentioned; and desired the officers, at the same time, to pacify and persuade the men belonging to them,
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
that their pay would be given to them <HI>at the end of four months</HI>; and that till those arrears were discharged, their pay should be continued to them. <HI>Two years</HI> are nearly expired since that time, but Mr. Taylor has not yet entirely discharged the arrears of those troops, and I am obliged to continue their pay from that time till this. I hoped to have been able, by this expedient, to have lessened the number of my troops, and discharge the arrears due to them, considering the trifle of interest to Mr. Taylor, and the others, as no great matter; but instead of this, <HI>I am oppressed with the burthen of pay due to those troops; and the interest, which is going on to Mr. Taylor from the day the teeps were granted to him.</HI></Q>
What I have read to you is an extract of a Letter from the Nabob of the Carnatic to Governor Rumbold, dated the 22d, and received the 24th of March 1779 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See further Consultations, 3d February 1778.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Suppose his highness not to be well broken in to things of this kind, it must indeed surprise so known and established a bond-vender, as the Nabob of Arcot, one who keeps himself the largest bond warehouse in the world, to find that he was now to receive in kind; not to take money for his obliga∣tions, but to give his bond in exchange for the bond of Messieurs Taylor, Majendie and Call, and to pay besides, a good smart interest, legally 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> [in reality perhaps twenty, or twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI>] for this exchange of paper. But his troops were not to be so paid, or so disbanded. They wanted bread, and could not live by cutting and shuffling of bonds. The Nabob still kept the troops in ser∣vice, and was obliged to continue, as you have seen, the whole expence, to exonerate himself from which he became indebted to the soucars.</P>
<P>Had it stood here, the transaction would have
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
been of the most audacious strain of fraud and usury, perhaps ever before discovered, whatever might have been practised and concealed. But the same authority (I mean the Nabob's) brings before you something if possible more striking. He states, that for this their paper, he immediately handed over to these gentlemen, something very different from paper; that is, the receipt of a territorial re∣venue, of which it seems they continued as long in possession as the Nabob himself continued in possession of any thing. Their payments there∣fore not being to commence before the end of four months, and not being compleated in two years, it must be presumed (unless they prove the contrary) that their payments to the Nabob were made out of the revenues they had received from his assignment. Thus they condescend to accumulate a debt of £. 160,000, with an interest of 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> in com∣pensation for a lingering payment to the Nabob, of £.160,000 of his own money.</P>
<P>Still we have not the whole: about two years after the assignment of those territorial revenues to these gentlemen, the Nabob receives a remonstrance from his chief manager, in a principal province, of which this is the tenor—
<Q>The <HI>entire</HI> revenue of those districts is by your highness' order set apart to discharge the tuncaws [assignments] granted to the Europeans. The gomastahs [agents] of Mr. Taylor, to Mr. De Fries, are there in order to collect these tuncaws; and as they receive <HI>all</HI> the revenue that is collected, your high∣ness's troops have <HI>seven or eight months pay due,</HI> which they cannot receive, and are thereby re∣duced to the greatest <HI>distress. In such times,</HI> it is highly necessary to provide for the suste∣nance of the troops that may be ready to exert themselves in the service of your highness.</Q></P>
<P>Here, Sir, you see how these causes and effects
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
act upon one another. One body of troops mutinies for want of pay; a debt is contracted to pay them; and they still remain unpaid. A territory destined to pay other troops, is assigned for this debt; and these other troops fall into the same state of indi∣gence and mutiny with the first. Bond is paid by bond; arrear is turned into new arrear; usury engenders new usury; mutiny suspended in one quarter, starts up in another; until all the re∣venues, and all the establishments are entangled into one inextricable knot of confusion, from which they are only disengaged by being entirely destroyed. In that state of confusion, in a very few months after the date of the memorial I have just read to you, things were found, when the Nabob's troops, famished to feed English soucars, instead of defend∣ing the country, joined the invaders, and deserted in entire bodies to Hyder Ali <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas's 1st Report, p. 26, 29, and Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, 10, 18, for the mutinous state and desertion of the Nabob's troops for want of pay. See also Report 4, of the same Committee.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The manner in which this transaction was carried on, shews that good examples are not easily forgot, especially by those who are bred in a great school. One of those splendid examples, give me leave to mention at a somewhat more early period, be∣cause one fraud furnishes light to the discovery of another, and so on, until the whole secret of myste∣rious iniquity bursts upon you in a blaze of de∣tection. The paper I shall read you, is not on re∣cord. If you please, you may take it on my word. It is a letter written from one of un∣doubted information in Madras, to Sir John Cla∣vering, describing the practice that prevailed there, whilst the Company's allies were under sale, during the time of Governor Winch's administration.</P>
<P>—


<Q>One mode (says Covering's corres∣pondent) of amassing money at the Nabob's
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
cost is curious. He is generally in arrears to the Company. Here the Governor, being cash-keeper, is generally on good terms with the banker, who manages matters thus: The Governor presses the Nabob for the balance due from him; the Nabob flies to his banker for relief; the banker engages to pay the money, and grants his notes accordingly, which he puts in the cash-book as ready money; the Nabob pays him an interest for it at <HI>two and three per cent. per mensem,</HI> till the tunkaws he grants on the particular districts for it are paid. Matters in the mean time are so managed, that there is no call for this money for the Company's ser∣vice, till the tuncaws become due. By this means not a cash is advanced by the banker, though he receives a heavy interest from the Nabob, which is divided as lawful spoil.</Q></P>
<P>Here, Mr. Speaker, you have the whole art and mystery, the true free-mason secret of the profession of <HI>soucaring</HI>; by which a few innocent, inexpe∣rienced young Englishmen, such as Mr. Paul Ben∣field, for instance, without property upon which any one would lend to themselves a single shilling, are enabled at once to take provinces in mortgage, to make princes their debtors, and to become cre∣ditors for millions.</P>
<P>But it seems the right honourable Gentleman's favourite soucar cavalry, have proved the payment before the Mayor's court at Madras! Have they so? Why then defraud our anxiety and their cha∣racters of that proof? Is it not enough that the charges which I have laid before you, have stood on record against these poor injured gentlemen for eight years? Is it not enough that they are in print by the orders of the East India Company for five years? After these gentlemen have borne all the odium of this publication, and all the indignation
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
of the Directors, with such unexampled equanimity, now that they are at length stimulated into feel∣ing, are you to deny them their just relief? But will the right honourable Gentleman be pleased to tell us, how they came not to give this satisfaction to the Court of Directors, their lawful masters, during all the eight years of this litigated claim? Were they not bound, by every tie that can bind man, to give them this satisfaction? This day, for the first time, we hear of the proofs. But when were these proofs offered? In what cause? Who were the parties? Who inspected? Who contested this be∣lated account? Let us see something to oppose to the body of record which appears against them. The Mayor's court! the Mayor's court! Pleasant! Does not the honourable Gentleman know, that the first corps of creditors (the cre∣ditors of 1767) stated it as a sort of hardship to them, that they could not have justice at Madras, from the impossibility of their supporting their claims in the Mayor's court. Why? because, say they, the members of that court were themselves creditors, and therefore could not sit as judges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memorial from the Creditors to the Governor and Council, 22d January, 1770.</NOTE>. Are we ripe to say that no creditor under similar circumstances was member of the Court, when the payment which is the ground of this cavalry debt was put in proof <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the year 1778, Mr. James Call, one of the proprie∣tors of this specific debt, was actually Mayor.

This was two years after the transaction; and the affidavit is made before George Proctor, Mayor, an attor∣ney, for certain of the old creditors. Proceedings of the President and Council of Fort Saint George, 22d February 1779.</NOTE>? Nay, are we not in a manner
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
compelled to conclude that the Court was so con∣stituted, when we know there is scarcely a man in Madras, who has not some participation in these transactions? It is a shame to hear such proofs men∣tioned, instead of the honest vigorous scrutiny which the circumstances of such an affair so indispensably calls for.</P>
<P>But his Majesty's ministers, indulgent enough to other scrutinies, have not been satisfied with au∣thorizing the payment of this demand without such enquiry as the Act has prescribed; but they have added the arrear of twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> interest, from the year 1777 to the year 1784, to make a new capital, raising thereby 160 to £. 294,000. Then they charge a new twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> on the whole from that period, for a transaction, in which it will be a miracle if a single penny will be ever found really advanced from the private stock of the pretended creditors.</P>
<P>In this manner, and at such an interest, the Mi∣nisters have thought proper to dispose of £. 294,000 of the public revenues, for what is called the <HI>ca∣valry loan.</HI> After dispatching this, the right ho∣nourable gentleman leads to battle his last grand division, the consolidated debt of 1777. But having exhausted all his panegyric on the two first, he has nothing at all to say in favour of the last. On the contrary, he admits that it was contracted in defiance of the Company's orders, without even the pretended sanction of any pre∣tended representatives. Nobody, indeed, has yet been found hardy enough to stand forth avowedly in its defence. But it is little to the credit of the age, that what has not plausibility enough to find an advocate, has influence enough to obtain a pro∣tector. Could any man expect to find that pro∣tector any where? But what must every man think, when he finds that protector in the Chair∣man

Even in his official letter, when he tramples on his parliamentary Report, yet his general language is the same. Read the preface to this part of the ministerial arrange∣ment, and you would imagine that this debt was to be crushed, with all the weight of in∣dignation which could fall from a vigilant guar∣dian of the public treasury, upon those who at∣tempted to rob it. What must be felt by every man who has feeling, when, after such a thunder∣ing preamble of condemnation, this debt is or∣dered to be paid without any sort of enquiry into its authenticity? without a single step taken to settle even the amount of the demand? without an attempt so much as to ascertain the real persons claiming a sum, which rises in the accounts from one million three hundred thousand pound sterling to two million four hundred thousand pound prin∣cipal money <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Appendix to the 4th Report of Mr. Dundas's Commit∣tee, N<SUP>o</SUP> 15.</NOTE>? without an attempt made to ascer∣tain the proprietors, of whom no list has ever yet been laid before the Court of Directors; of proprietors who are known to be in a collusive shuffle, by which they never appear to be the same in any two lifts, handed about for their own parti∣cular purposes?</P>
<P>My honourable Friend who made you the mo∣tion, has sufficiently exposed the nature of this debt. He has stated to you that <HI>its own agents</HI> in the year 1781, in the arrangement <HI>they proposed</HI> to make at Calcutta, were satisfied to have twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> at once struck off from the capital of a
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
great part of this debt; and prayed to have a pro∣vision made for this reduced principal, without any interest at all. This was an arrangement of their <HI>own,</HI> an arrangement made by those who best knew the true constitution of their own debt; who knew how little favour it merited <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"No sense of the common danger, in case of a war, can prevail on him [the Nabob of Arcot] to furnish the Company with what is absolutely necessary to assemble an army, though it is beyond a doubt, that money to a large amount is now hoarded up in his coffers at Chepauk; and tunkaws are granted to <HI>individuals</HI> upon some of his most <HI>valuable coun∣tries,</HI> for payment of part of those debts which he has con∣tracted, and <HI>which certainly will not bear inspection, as neither the debtor or creditors have ever had the confidence to submit the accounts to our examination,</HI> though they expressed a wish to consolidate the debts under the auspices of this government, agreeably to a plan they had formed." Madras Consultations, 20th July 1778. Mr. Dundas's Appendix to 2d Report, 143. See also last Appendix to ditto Report, N<SUP>o</SUP> 376 B.</NOTE>, and how little hopes they had to find any persons in authority abandoned enough to support it as it stood.</P>
<P>But what corrupt men, in the fond imaginations of a sanguine avarice, had not the confidence to propose, they have found a Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer in England hardy enough to undertake for them. He has cheered their drooping spirits. He has thanked the peculators for not despairing of their commonwealth. He has told them they were too modest. He has replaced the twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> which, in order to lighten themselves, they had abandoned in their conscious terror. Instead of cutting off the interest, as they had themselves consented to do, with the fourth of the capital, he has added the whole growth of four years usury of twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> to the first over-grown principal; and has again grafted on this meliorated stock a perpetual annuity of six <HI>per cent.</HI> to take place from the year 1781. Let no man hereafter talk
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
of the decaying energies of nature. All the acts and monuments in the records of peculation; the consolidated corruption of ages; the patterns of exemplary plunder in the heroic times of Roman iniquity, never equalled the gigantic corruption of this single act. Never did Nero, in all the insolent prodigality of despotism, deal out to his praetorian guards a donation fit to be named with the largess showered down by the bounty of our Chancellor of the Exchequer on the faithful band of his Indian Sepoys.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE> lets you freely and voluntarily into the whole transaction. So per∣fectly has his conduct confounded his understand∣ing, that he fairly tells you, that through the course of the whole business he has never con∣ferred with any but the agents of the pretended creditors. After this, do you want more to esta∣blish a secret understanding with the parties? to fix, beyond a doubt, their collusion and parti∣cipation in a common fraud?</P>
<P>If this were not enough, he has furnished you with other presumptions that are not to be shaken. It is one of the known indications of guilt to stag∣ger and prevaricate in a story; and to vary in the motives that are assigned to conduct. Try these Ministers by this rule. In their official dispatch, they tell the Presidency of Madras, that they have established the debt for two reasons; first, because the Nabob (the party indebted) does not dispute it; secondly, because it is mischievous to keep it longer afloat; and that the payment of the European creditors will promote circulation in the country. These two motives (for the plainest reasons in the world) the right honourable gentleman has this day thought fit totally to abandon. In the first place, he rejects the authority of the Nabob of Arcot.
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
It would indeed be pleasant to see him adhere to this exploded testimony. He next, upon grounds equally solid, abandons the benefits of that circu∣lation, which was to be produced by drawing out all the juices of the body. Laying aside, or for∣getting these pretences of his dispatch, he has just now assumed a principle totally different, but to the full as extraordinary. He proceeds upon a supposition, that many of the claims may be fic∣titious. He then finds, that in a case where many valid and many fraudulent claims are blended together, the best course for their discrimination is indiscriminately to establish them all. He trusts (I suppose) as there may not be a fund sufficient for every description of creditors, that the best warranted claimants will exert themselves in bring∣ing to light those debts which will not bear an en∣quiry. What he will not do himself, he is persuad∣ed will be done by others; and for this purpose he leaves to any person a general power of excepting to the debt. This total change of language, and prevarication in principle, is enough, if it stood alone, to fix the presumption of unfair dealing. His dispatch assigns motives of policy, concord, trade, and circulation. His speech proclaims dis∣cord and litigations; and proposes, as the ultimate end, detection.</P>
<P>But he may shift his reasons, and wind, and turn as he will, confusion waits him at all his doubles. Who will undertake this detection? Will the Nabob? But the right honourable gen∣tleman has himself this moment told us, that no prince of the country can by any motive be pre∣vailed upon to discover any fraud that is prac∣tised upon him by the Company's servants. He says what, (with the exception of the complaint against the cavalry loan) all the world knows to
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
be true; and without that Prince's concurrence, what evidence can be had of the fraud of any the smallest of these demands? The Ministers ne∣ver authorized any person to enter into his ex∣chequer, and to search his records. Why then this shameful and insulting mockery of a pretended contest? Already contests for a preference have arisen among these rival bond creditors. Has not the Company itself struggled for a preference for years, without any attempt at detection of the na∣ture of those debts with which they contended? Well is the Nabob of Arcot attended to in the only specific complaint he has ever made. He com∣plained of unfair dealing in the cavalry loan. It is fixed upon him with interest on interest; and this loan is excepted from all power of litigation.</P>
<P>This day, and not before, the right honoura∣ble gentleman thinks that the general establishment of all claims is the surest way of laying open the fraud of some of them. In India, this is a reach of deep policy. But what would be thought of this mode of acting on a demand upon the Trea∣sury in England? Instead of all this cunning, is there not one plain way open, that is, to put the burthen of the proof on those who make the de∣mand? Ought not Ministry to have said to the creditors,
<Q>The person who admits your debt stands excepted to as evidence; he stands charged as a collusive party, to hand over the public re∣venues to you for sinister purposes? You say, you have a demand of some millions on the In∣dian treasury; prove that you have acted by lawful authority; prove at least that your money has been <HI>bonâ fide</HI> advanced; entitle yourself to my protection, by the fairness and fulness of the communications you make.</Q>
Did an honest creditor ever refuse that reasonable and honest test?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49"/>There is little doubt, that several individuals have been seduced by the purveyors to the Nabob of Arcot to put their money (perhaps the whole of honest and laborious earnings) into their hands, and that at such high interest, as, being condemn∣ed at law, leaves them at the mercy of the great managers whom they trusted. These seduced creditors are probably persons of no power or inte∣rest, either in England or India, and may be just objects of compassion. By taking, in this arrange∣ment no measures for discrimination and disco∣very; the fraudulent and the fair are in the first instance confounded in one mass. The subse∣quent selection and distribution is left to the Na∣bob. With him the agents and instruments of his corruption, whom he sees to be omnipotent in England, and who may serve him in future, as they have done in times past, will have precedence, if not an exclusive preference. These leading inte∣rests domineer, and have always domineered, over the whole. By this arrangement the persons seduced are made dependent on their seducers; honesty (comparative honesty at least) must become of the party of fraud, and must quit its proper character, and its just claims, to entitle itself to the alms of bribery and peculation.</P>
<P>But be these English creditors what they may, the creditors, most certainly not fraudulent, are the natives, who are numerous and wretched indeed: by exhausting the whole revenues of the Carnatic, nothing is left for them. They lent <HI>bonaâ fide</HI>; in all probability they were even forced to lend, or to give goods and service for the Nabob's obligations. They had no trusts to carry to his market. They had no faith of alliances to sell. They had no nations to be∣tray to robbery and ruin. They had no lawful go∣vernment seditiously to overturn; nor had they a
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
Governor, to whom it is owing that you exist in India, to deliver over to captivity, and to death, in a shameful prison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Pigot.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These were the merits of the principal part of the debt of 1777, and the universally conceived causes of its growth; and thus the unhappy natives are deprived of every hope of payment for their real debts, to make provision for the arrears of unsatis∣fied bribery and treason. You see in this instance, that the presumption of guilt is not only no ex∣ception to the demands on the public treasury; but with these ministers it is a necessary condition to their support. But that you may not think this pre∣ference solely owing to their known contempt of the natives, who ought with every generous mind to claim their first charities; you will find the same rule religiously observed with Europeans too. At∣tend, Sir, to this decisive case.—Since the begin∣ning of the war, besides arrears of every kind, a bond debt has been contracted at Madras, uncertain in its amount, but represented from four hundred thousand pound to a million sterling. It stands only at the low interest of eight <HI>per cent.</HI> Of the legal authority on which this debt was contracted, of its purposes for the very being of the state, of its publicity and fairness, no doubt has been en∣tertained for a moment. For this debt, no sort of provision whatever has been made. It is rejected as an outcast, whilst the whole undissipated atten∣tion of the Minister has been employed for the discharge of claims entitled to his favour by the merits we have seen.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to find out, if possible, the amount of the whole of those demands, in order to see how much, supposing the country in a con∣dition to furnish the fund, may remain to satisfy
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
the public debt and the necessary establishments. But I have been foiled in my attempt. About one-fourth, that is about £. 220,000 of the loan of 1767, remains unpaid. How much interest is in arrear, I could never discover; seven or eight years at least, which would make the whole of that debt about £. 396,000. This stock, which the Ministers in their instructions to the Governor of Madras state as the least exceptionable, they have thought proper to distinguish by a marked severity, leaving it the only one, on which the interest is not added to the principal, to beget a new interest.</P>
<P>The cavalry loan, by the operation of the same authority, is made up to £.294,000, and this £. 294,000, made up of principal and interest, is crowned with a new interest of twelve <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>What the grand loan, the bribery loan of 1777, may be, is amongst the deepest mysteries of state. It is probably the first debt ever assuming the title of consolidation, that did not express what the amount of the sum consolidated was. It is little less than a contradiction in terms. In the debt of the year 1767, the sum was stated in the act of consoli∣dation, and made to amount to £. 880,000 capi∣tal. When this consolidation of 1777 was first an∣nounced at the Durbar, it was represented authenti∣cally at £. 2,400,000. In that, or rather in an higher state, Sir Thomas Rumbold found and con∣demned it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Sir Thomas Rumbold's letter to the Court of Direc∣tors, March 15th, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, he represents it as higher, in the fol∣lowing manner:—
<Q>How shall I paint to you my astonish∣ment on my arrival here, when I was informed, that inde∣pendent of this four lacks of pagodas [the cavalry loan]; independent of the Nabob's debt to his old creditors, and the money due to the Company; he had contracted a debt to the enormous amount of sixty-three lacks of pagodas [£. 2,520,000].—I mention this circumstance to you <HI>with horror</HI>; for the creditors being in general <HI>servants of the Company,</HI> renders my task, on the part of the Company, <HI>difficult and invidious.</HI></Q> — <Q>I have freed the sanction of this government from <HI>so corrupt</HI> a transaction. It is, in my mind, the most venal of all proceedings, to give the Com∣pany's protection to debts that cannot bear the light; and though it appears exceedingly alarming, that a country, on which you are to depend for resources, should be so involved, as to be nearly three years revenue in debt; in a country too, where one year's revenue can never be called <HI>secure,</HI> by men who know any thing of the politics of this part of India.</Q>
—
<Q>I think it proper to mention to you, that although the <HI>Nabob reports his private debt to amount to upwards of sixty lacks,</HI> yet I understand that it is not quite so much.</Q>
—Afterwards Sir Thomas Rumbold recommended this debt to the favourable attention of the Company, but without any sufficient reason for his change of disposition. However he went no further.</NOTE>. It afterwards fell into such a terror, as to sweat away a million of its weight at once;
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
and it sunk to £. 1,400,000 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's proposals, November 25th, 1778; and memorial of the creditors, March 1st, 1779.</NOTE>. However, it never was without a resource for recruiting it to its old plumpness. There was a sort of floating debt of about 4 or £. 500,000 more, ready to be added, as occasion should require.</P>
<P>In short, when you pressed this sensitive plant, it always contracted its dimensions. When the rude hand of enquiry was withdrawn, it expanded in all the luxuriant vigour of its original vegetation. In the treaty of 1781, the whole of the Nabob's debt to private Europeans is by Mr. Sullivan, agent to the Nabob and the creditors, stated at £ 2,800,000, which (if the cavalry loan, and the remains of the debt of 1767, be subtracted) leaves it nearly at the amount originally declared at the Durbar, in 1777. But then there is a private instruction to Mr. Sullivan, which it seems will re∣duce it again to the lower standard of £. 1,400,000. Failing in all my attempts, by a direct account, to
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
ascertain the extent of the capital claimed (where in all probability no capital was ever advanced) I en∣deavoured, if possible, to discover it by the interest which was to be paid. For that purpose, I looked to the several agreements for assigning the territories of the Carnatic to secure the principal and interest of this debt. In one of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's proposals to his new consolidated creditors, No∣vember 25th, 1778.</NOTE> I found in a sort of Postscript, by way of an additional remark, (not in the body of the obligation) the debt represented at £. 1,400,000. But when I computed the sums to be paid for interest by instalments in another paper, I found they produced the interest of two millions, at twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> and the assignment supposed, that if these instalments might exceed, they might also fall short of the real provision for that interest <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Paper signed by the Nabob, 6th January 1780.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another instalment bond was afterwards granted. In that bond the interest exactly tallies with a ca∣pital of £. 1,400,000 <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Kistbundi to July 31, 1780.</NOTE>. But pursuing this capital through the correspondence, I lost sight of it again, and it was asserted that this instalment bond was con∣siderably short of the interest that ought to be com∣puted to the time mentioned <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Governor's letter to the Nabob, 25th 1779.</NOTE>. Here are, therefore, two statements of equal authority, differing at least a million from each other; and as neither persons claiming, nor any special sum as belonging to each particular claimant, is ascertained in the instruments of consolidation, or in the instalment bonds, a large scope was left to throw in any sums for any persons, as their merits in advancing the interest of that loan might require; a power was also left for reduc∣tion, in case a harder hand, or more scanty funds, might be found to require it. Stronger grounds for a presumption of fraud never appeared in any
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
transaction. But the ministers, faithful to the plan of the interested persons, whom alone they thought fit to confer with on this occasion, have ordered the payment of the whole mass of these unknown unliquidated sums, without an attempt to ascertain them. On this conduct, Sir, I leave you to make your own reflexions.</P>
<P>It is impossible (at least I have found it im∣possible) to fix on the real amount of the pretended debts with which your ministers have thought proper to load the Carnatic. They are obscure; they shun enquiry; they are enormous. That is all you know of them.</P>
<P>That you may judge what chance any ho∣nourable and useful end of government has for a provision that comes in for the leavings of these gluttonous demands, I must take it on myself to bring before you the real condition of that abused, insulted, racked, and ruined country; though in truth my mind revolts from it; though you will hear it with horror; and I confess, I tremble when I think on these awful and confounding dispensa∣tions of Providence. I shall first trouble you with a few words as to the cause.</P>
<P>The great fortunes made in India in the begin∣nings of conquest, naturally excited an emulation in all the parts, and through the whole succession of the Company's service. But in the Company it gave rise to other sentiments. They did not find the new channels of acquisition flow with equal riches to them. On the contrary, the high flood-tide of private emolument was generally in the lowest ebb of their affairs. They began also to fear, that the fortune of war might take away what the fortune of war had given. Wars were accordingly discouraged by repeated injunctions and menaces; and that the servants might not be bribed into them by the native princes, they were strictly forbidden
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
to take any money whatsoever from their hands. But vehement passion is ingenious in resources. The Company's servants were not only stimulated, but better instructed by the prohibition. They soon fell upon a contrivance which answered their purposes far better than the methods which were forbid∣den; though in this also they violated an ancient, but they thought, an abrogated order. They reversed their proceedings. Instead of receiv∣ing presents, they made loans. Instead of carrying on wars in their own name, they contrived an autho∣rity, at once irresistible and irresponsible, in whose name they might ravage at pleasure; and being thus freed from all restraint, they indulged themselves in the most extravagant speculations of plunder. The cabal of creditors who have been the object of the late bountiful grant from his Majesty's mi∣nisters, in order to possess themselves, under the name of creditors and assignees, of every country in India, as fast as it should be conquered, inspired into the mind of the Nabob of Arcot (then a de∣pendant on the Company of the humblest order) a scheme of the most wild and desperate ambition that I believe ever was admitted into the thoughts of a man so situated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Report of the Select Committee, Madras Consultations, January 7, 1771. See also papers published by the order of the Court of Directors in 1776; and Lord Macartney's cor∣respondence with Mr. Hastings and the Nabob of Arcot. See also Mr. Dundas's Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP> 376 B. Nabob's proposi∣tions thro' Mr. Sulivan and Assam Khân, Art. 6. and indeed the whole.</NOTE>. First, they persuaded him to consider himself as a principal member in the political system of Europe. In the next place, they held out to him, and he readily imbibed the idea of the general empire of Indostan. As a preliminary to this undertaking, they prevailed on him to pro∣pose a tripartite division of that vast country. One
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
part to the Company; another to the Marattas; and the third to himself. To himself he reserved all the southern part of the great peninsula, comprehend∣ed under the general name of the Decan.</P>
<P>On this scheme of their servants, the Company was to appear in the Carnatic in no other light than as a contractor for the provision of armies, and the hire of mercenaries for his use, and under his direction. This disposition was to be secured by the Nabob's putting himself under the guarantee of France; and by the means of that rival nation, preventing the English for ever from assuming an equality, much less a superiority in the Carnatic. In pursuance of this treasonable project (treason∣able on the part of the English) they extinguished the Company as a sovereign power in that part of India; they withdrew the Company's garrisons out of all the forts and strong holds of the Car∣natic; they declined to receive the ambassadors from foreign courts, and remitted them to the Nabob of Arcot; they fell upon, and totally de∣stroyed the oldest ally of the company, the king of Tanjore, and plundered the country to the amount of near five millions sterling; one after another, in the Nabob's name, but with English force, they brought into a miserable servitude all the princes, and great independent nobility of a vast country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The principal object of the expedition is to get money from Tanjore to pay the Nabob's debt: if a surlpus, to be applied in discharge of the Nabob's debts to his pri∣vate creditors.</Q>

<Q>We are alarmed, lest this debt to <HI>individuals</HI> should have been the <HI>real</HI> motive for the aggrandizement of Mahomed Ali [the Nabob of Arcot] and that <HI>we are plunged into a war</HI> to put him into possession of the Mysore revenues <HI>for the discharge of the debt.</HI></Q>

ruined the people, the fund of the Nabob's debt grew and flourished.</P>
<P>Among the victims to this magnificent plan of universal plunder, worthy of the heroic avarice of the projectors, you have all heard (and he has made himself to be well remembered) of an In∣dian chief called Hyder Ali Khan. This man possessed the western, as the Company under the name of the Nabob of Arcot does the eastern di∣vision of the Carnatic. It was among the leading measures in the design of this cabal (according to their own emphatic language) to <HI>extirpate</HI> this Hyder Ali <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Nabob, May 1st, 1768; and ditto, 24th April 1770, 1st October; ditto, 16th September 1772, 16th March 1773.</NOTE>. They declared the Nabob of Arcot to be his sovereign, and himself to be a rebel, and publicly invested their instrument with the so∣vereignty of the kingdom of Mysore. But their victim was not of the passive kind. They were soon obliged to conclude a treaty of peace and close alliance with this rebel, at the gates of Ma∣dras. Both before and since that treaty, every principle of policy pointed out this power as a na∣tural alliance; and on his part, it was courted by every sort of amicable office. But the cabinet coun∣cil of English creditors would not suffer their Nabob of Arcot to sign the treaty, nor even to give to a prince, at least his equal, the ordinary titles of re∣spect and courtesy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Presidency at Madras to the Court of Directors, 27th June 1769.</NOTE>. From that time forward, a continued plot was carried on within the divan, black and white, of the Nabob of Arcot, for the destruction of Hyder Ali. As to the outward members of the double, or rather treble govern∣ment of Madras, which had signed the treaty, they were always prevented by some over-ruling
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
influence (which they do not describe, but which cannot be misunderstood) from performing what justice and interest combined so evidently to en∣force <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas's Committee, Report I. Appendix No. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either would sign no conven∣tion, or whom no treaty, and no signature could bind, and who were the determined enemies of hu∣man intercourse itself, he decreed to make the coun∣try possessed by these incorrigible and predestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved, in the gloomy recesses of a mind capa∣cious of such things, to leave the whole Carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance; and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection. He became at length so confident of his force, so collected in his might, that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution. Having terminated his disputes with every enemy, and every rival, who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter, whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and desolation, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains. Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly burst, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic.—Then ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
horrors of war before known or heard of, were mercy to that new havoc. A storm of universal fire blasted every field, consumed every house, de∣stroyed every temple. The miserable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages, in part were slaughtered; others, without regard to sex, to age, to the respect of rank, or sacredness of function; fathers torn from children, husbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the goading spears of drivers, and the trampling of pursuing horses, were swept into captivity, in an unknown and hostile land. Those who were able to evade this tempest, fled to the walled cities. But escaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.</P>
<P>The alms of the settlement, in this dreadful ex∣igency, were certainly liberal; and all was done by charity that private charity could do: but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation which stretched out its hands for food. For months together these creatures of sufferance, whose very excess and luxury in their most plen∣teous days, had fallen short of the allowance of our austerest fasts, silent, patient, resigned, with∣out sedition or disturbance, almost without com∣plaint, perished by an hundred a day in the streets of Madras; every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the streets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and expired of famine in the granary of India. I was going to awake your justice towards this un∣happy part of our fellow citizens, by bringing be∣fore you some of the circumstances of this plague of hunger. Of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of man, this comes the nearest to our heart, and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is: but I find myself unable to manage it with decorum; these details are of a species of horror so nauseous
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
and disgusting; they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the hearers; they are so humiliating to human nature itself, that, on better thoughts, I find it more adviseable to throw a pall over this hideous object, and to leave it to your general con∣ceptions.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 4, Report of the Committee of assigned Revenue.</NOTE> For eighteen months, without intermission, this destruction raged from the gates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and so compleatly did these masters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more fe∣rocious son, absolve themselves of their impious vow, that when the British armies traversed, as they did the Carnatic for hundreds of miles in all direc∣tions, through the whole line of their march they did not see one man, not one woman, not one child, not one four-footed beast of any description whatever. One dead uniform silence reigned over the whole region. With the inconsiderable excep∣tions of the narrow vicinage of some few forts, I wish to be understood as speaking literally. I mean to produce to you more than three witnesses, above all exception, who will support this assertion in its full extent. That hurricane of war passed through every part of the central provinces of the Carnatic. Six or seven districts to the north and to the south (and these not wholly untouched) escaped the general ravage.</P>
<P>The Carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to England. Figure to yourself, Mr. Speaker, the land in whose representative chair you sit; figure to yourself the form and fashion of your sweet and cheerful country from Thames to Trent, north and south, and from the Irish to the German sea east and west, emptied and embowelled (May God avert the omen of our crimes!) by so accomplished a desolation. Extend your imagina∣tion
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
a little further, and then suppose your minis∣ters taking a survey of this scene of waste and de∣solation; what would be your thoughts if you should be informed, that they were computing how much had been the amount of the excises, how much the customs, how much the land and malt tax, in order that they should charge (take it in the most favourable light) for public service, upon the relicks of the satiated vengeance of re∣lentless enemies, the whole of what England had yielded in the most exuberant seasons of peace and abundance? What would you call it? To call it tyranny, sublimed into madness, would be too faint an image; yet this very madness is the principle upon which the ministers at your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues of the Carnatic, when they were providing, not supply for the establishments of its protection, but rewards for the authors of its ruin.</P>
<P>Every day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant,
<Q>the Carnatic is a country that will soon recover, and become instantly as prosperous as ever.</Q>
They think they are talk∣ing to innocents, who will believe that by sow∣ing of dragons teeth, men may come up ready grown and ready armed. They who will give themselves the trouble of considering (for it re∣quires no great reach of thought, no very profound knowledge) the manner in which mankind are in∣creased, and countries cultivated, will regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded. In order that the people, after a long period of vexation and plunder, may be in a condition to maintain government, government must begin by maintain∣ing them. Here the road to oeconomy lies not through receipt, but through expence; and in that country nature has given no short cut to your ob∣ject. Men must propagate, like other animals, by
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
the mouth. Never did oppression light the nup∣tial torch; never did extortion and usury spread out the genial bed. Does any of you think that Eng∣land, so wasted, would, under such a nursing at∣tendance, so rapidly and cheaply recover? But he is meanly acquainted with either England or India, who does not know that England would a thou∣sand times sooner resume population, fertility, and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from both, revenue, than such a country as the Carnatic.</P>
<P>The Carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile soil. The general size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise. It is some days since I moved, that a curious and interesting map, kept in the India House, should be laid before you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Barnard's Map of the Jaghire.</NOTE>. The India House is not yet in readiness to send it; I have therefore brought down my own copy, and there it lies for the use of any gentleman who may think such a matter worthy of his attention. It is indeed a noble map, and of noble things; but it is decisive against the golden dreams and san∣guine speculations of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know must be the case in every part of the world (the necessity of a previous provision of habitation, seed, stock, capital) that map will shew you, that the use of the influences of Heaven itself, are in that country a work of art. The Carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or running streams, and it has rain only at a season; but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command. This is the national bank of the Carnatic, on which it must have a perpetual credit, or it perishes irre∣trievably. For that reason, in the happier times of India, a number almost incredible of reservoirs have been made in chosen places throughout the whole country; they are formed, for the greater
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
part, of mounds of earth and stones, with sluices of solid masonry; the whole constructed with admi∣rable skill and labour, and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit. From these reservoirs cur∣rents are occasionally drawn over the fields, and these watercourses again call for a considerable ex∣pence to keep them properly scoured and duly le∣velled. Taking the district in that map as a mea∣sure, there cannot be in the Carnatic and Tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs of the larger and middling dimensions, to say nothing of those for domestic services, and the use of reli∣gious purification. These are not the enterprizes of your power, nor in a style of magnificence suited to the taste of your minister. These are the monu∣ments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an unsatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the con∣tracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to ex∣tend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the pro∣tectors, the nourishers of mankind.</P>
<P>Long before the late invasion, the persons who are objects of the grant of public money now be∣fore you, had so diverted the supply of the pious funds of culture and population, that everywhere the reservoirs were fallen into a miserable decay <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Report IV. Mr. Dundas's Committee, p. 46.</NOTE>. But after those domestic enemies had provoked
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
the entry of a cruel foreign foe into the coun∣try, he did not leave it until his revenge had compleated the destruction begun by their avarice. Few, very few indeed, of these magazines of water that are not either totally destroyed, or cut through with such gaps, as to require a serious attention and much cost to re-establish them, as the means of present subsistence to the people, and of future revenue to the state.</P>
<P>What, Sir, would a virtuous and enlightened ministry do on the view of the ruins of such works before them? on the view of such a chasm of de∣solation as that which yawned in the midst of those countries to the north and south, which still bore some vestiges of cultivation? They would have re∣duced all their most necessary establishments; they would have suspended the justest payments; they would have employed every shilling derived from the producing to reanimate the powers of the un∣productive parts. While they were performing this fundamental duty, whilst they were celebrat∣ing these mysteries of justice and humanity, they would have told the corps of fictitious creditors, whose crimes were their claims, that they must keep an awful distance; that they must silence their inauspicious tongues; that they must hold off their profane unhallowed paws from this holy work; they would have proclaimed with a voice that should make itself heard, that on every coun∣try the first creditor is the plow; that this ori∣ginal, indefeasible claim supersedes every other de∣mand.</P>
<P>This is what a wise and virtuous ministry would have done and said. This, therefore, is what our minister could never think of saying or doing. A ministry of another kind would have first im∣proved the country, and have thus laid a solid
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
foundation for future opulence and future force. But on this grand point of the restoration of the country, there is not one syllable to be found in the correspondence of our ministers, from the first to the last: they felt nothing for a land desolat∣ed by fire, sword, and famine; their sympathies took another direction; they were touched with pity for bribery, so long tormented with a fruit∣less itching of its palms; their bowels yearned for usury, that had long missed the harvest of its returning months <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Interest is rated in India by the mouth.</NOTE>; they felt for peculation which had been for so many years raking in the dust of an empty treasury; they were melted into compas∣sion for rapine and oppression, licking their dry, parched, unbloody jaws. These were the objects of their solicitude. These were the necessities for which they were studious to provide.</P>
<P>To state the country and its revenues in their real condition, and to provide for those fictitious claims, consistently with the support of an army and a civil establishment, would have been impossi∣ble; therefore the ministers are silent on that head, and rest themselves on the authority of lord Ma∣cartney, who in a letter to the Court of Directors, written in the year 1781, speculating on what might be the result of a wise management of the countries assigned by the Nabob of Arcot, rates the revenues as in time of peace, at twelve hundred thousand pound a year, as he does those of the king of Tanjore (which had not been assigned) at four hundred and fifty. On this lord Macartney grounds his calculations, and on this they choose to ground theirs. It was on this calculation that the ministry, in direct opposition to the remon∣strances of the Court of Directors, have compelled that miserable, enslaved body, to put their hands
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
to an order for appropriating the enormous sum of £. 480,000 annually, as a fund for paying to their rebellious servants a debt contracted in defiance of their clearest and most positive injunctions.</P>
<P>The authority and information of Lord Macart∣ney is held high on this occasion, though it is to∣tally rejected in every other particular of this busi∣ness. I believe I have the honour of being almost as old an acquaintance as any Lord Macartney has. A constant and unbroken friendship has subsisted between us from a very early period; and, I trust, he thinks, that as I respect his character, and in general admire his conduct, I am one of those who feel no common interest in his reputation. Yet I do not hesitate wholly to disallow the cal∣culation of 1781, without any apprehension, that I shall appear to distrust his veracity or his judgment. This peace estimate of revenue was not ground∣ed on the state of the Carnatic as it then, or as it had recently stood. It was a statement of former and better times. There is no doubt, that a pe∣riod did exist, when the large portion of the Car∣natic held by the Nabob of Arcot might be fairly reputed to produce a revenue to that, or to a great∣er amount. But the whole had so melted away by the slow and silent hostility of oppression and mis∣management, that the revenues, sinking with the prosperity of the country, had fallen to about £. 800,000 a year, even before an enemy's horse had imprinted his hoof on the soil of the Carnatic. From that view, and independently of the decisive effects of the war which ensued, Sir Eyre Coote conceived that years must pass before the country could be restored to its former prosperity and pro∣duction. It was that state of revenue, (namely, the actual state before the war) which the Directors have opposed to Lord Macartney's speculation. They refuse to take the revenues for more than
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
£. 800,000. In this they are justified by Lord Macartney himself, who, in a subsequent letter, in∣forms the Court, that his sketch is a matter of spe∣culation; it supposes the country restored to its antient prosperity, and the revenue to be in a course of effective and honest collection. If there∣fore the ministers have gone wrong, they were not deceived by Lord Macartney: they were deceived by no man. The estimate of the Directors is nearly the very estimate furnished by the right honourable gentleman himself, and published to the world in one of the printed Reports of his own Committee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas's Committee, Rep. I. p. 9; and ditto, Rep. IV. 69. where the revenue of 1777 stated only at 22 lacks —30 lacks stated as the revenue,
<Q><HI>supposing</HI> the Carnatic to be <HI>properly</HI> managed.</Q></NOTE>; but as soon as he obtained his power, he chose to abandon his account. No part of his official conduct can be defended on the ground of his parliamentary information.</P>
<P>In this clashing of accounts and estimates, ought not the ministry, if they wished to preserve even appearances, to have waited for information of the actual result of these speculations, before they laid a charge, and such a charge, not condi∣tionally and eventually, but positively and authori∣tatively, upon a country which they all knew, and which one of them had registered on the records of this House, to be wasted beyond all example, by every oppression of an abusive government, and every ravage of a desolating war. But that you may discern in what manner they use the correspondence of office, and that thereby you may enter into the true spirit of the ministerial Board of Control, I desire you, Mr. Speaker, to remark, that through their whole controversy with the Court of Directors, they do not so much as hint at their ever having seen any other paper from lord Macartney, or any other
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
estimate of revenue, than this of 1781. To this they hold. Here they take post; here they en∣trench themselves.</P>
<P>When I first read this curious controversy be∣tween the ministerial Board and the Court of Di∣rectors, common candour obliged me to attribute their tenacious adherence to the estimate of 1781, to a total ignorance of what had appeared upon the records. But the right honourable gentleman has chosen to come forward with an uncalled-for de∣claration; he boastingly tells you, that he has seen, read, digested, compared every thing; and that if he has sinned, he has sinned with his eyes broad open. Since then the ministers will obstinately shut the gates of mercy on themselves, let them add to their crimes what aggravations they please. They have then (since it must be so) wilfully and corrupt∣ly suppressed the information which they ought to have produced; and for the support of peculation, have made themselves guilty of spoliation and sup∣pression of evidence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 4, Statement in the Report of the Committee of assigned Revenue.</NOTE>. The paper I hold in my hand, which totally overturns (for the present at least) the estimate of 1781, they have no more taken notice of in their controversy with the Court of Directors than if it had no exist∣ence. It is the Report made by a Committee appointed at Madras, to manage the whole of the six countries assigned to the Company by the Nabob of Arcot. This Committee was wisely instituted by Lord Macartney, to remove from himself the sus∣picion of all improper management in so invidious a trust; and it seems to have been well chosen. This Committee has made a comparative estimate of the only six districts which were in a condition to be let to farm. In one set of columns they state the gross and net produce of the districts as let
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
by the Nabob. To that statement they oppose the terms on which the same districts were rented for five years, under their authority. Under the Nabob, the gross farm was so high as £. 570,000 sterling. What was the clear produce? Why, no more than about £. 250,000; and this was the whole profit to the Nabob's treasury, under his own management, of all the districts which were in a condition to be let to farm on the 27th of May 1782. Lord Macartney's leases stipulated a gross produce of no more than about £. 530,000: But then the estimated net amount was nearly double the Nabob's. It how∣ever did not then exceed £. 480,000; and lord Ma∣cartney's commissioners take credit for an annual revenue amounting to this clear sum. Here is no speculation; here is no inaccurate account clandes∣tinely obtained from those who might wish, and were enabled to deceive. It is the authorized re∣corded state of a real recent transaction. Here is not twelve hundred thousand pound, not eight hun∣dred. The whole revenue of the Carnatic yielded no more in May 1782 than four hundred and eighty thousand pounds; nearly the very precise sum which your minister, who is so careful of the public security, has carried from all descriptions of esta∣blishment to form a fund for the private emolu∣ment of his creatures.</P>
<P>In this estimate, we see, as I have just observed, the Nabob's farms rated so high as £. 570,000. Hitherto all is well; but follow on to the effective net revenue: there the illusion vanishes; and you will not find nearly so much as half the pro∣duce. It is with reason therefore lord Macartney invariably throughout the whole correspondence, qualifies all his views and expectations of re∣venue, and all his plans for its application, with this indispensable condition, that the management is not in the hands of the Nabob of Arcot. Should
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
that fatal measure take place, he has over and over again told you, that he has no prospect of realizing any thing whatsoever for any public purpose. With these weighty declarations, confirmed by such a state of indisputable fact before them; what has been done by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his accomplices? Shall I be believed? They have de∣livered over those very territories, on the keeping of which in the hands of the Committee, the de∣fence of our dominions, and what was more dear to them, possibly, their own job depended; they have delivered back again without condition, without arrangement, without stipulation of any sort for the natives of any rank, the whole of those vast countries, to many of which he had no just claim, into the ruinous mismanagement of the Nabob of Arcot. To crown all, according to their miserable practice whenever they do any thing transcendent∣ly absurd, they preface this their abdication of their trust, by a solemn declaration that they were not obliged to it by any principle of policy, or any de∣mand of justice whatsoever.</P>
<P>I have stated to you the estimated produce of the territories of the Carnatic, in a condition to be farm∣ed in 1782, according to the different managements into which they might fall; and this estimate the ministers have thought proper to suppress. Since that, two other accounts have been received. The first informs us, that there has been a recovery of what is called arrear, as well as of an improvement of the revenue of one of the six provinces which were let in 1782 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Province of Tinnevelly.</NOTE>. It was brought about by making a new war. After some sharp actions, by the resolution and skill of Colonel Fullarton, several of the petty princes of the most southerly of the unwasted pro∣vinces were compelled to pay very heavy rents and
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
tributes, who for a long time before had not paid any acknowledgment. After this reduction, by the care of Mr. Irwin, one of the Committee, that province was divided into twelve farms. This ope∣ration raised the income of that particular province; the others remain as they were first farmed. So that instead of producing only their original rent of £. 480,000, they netted in about two years and a quarter £. 1,320,000 sterling, which would be about £. 660,000 a year, if the recovered arrear was not included. What deduction is to be made on account of that arrear I cannot determine, but certainly what would reduce the annual income considerably below the rate I have allowed.</P>
<P>The second account received, is the letting of the wasted provinces of the Carnatic. This I un∣derstand is at a growing rent, which may or may not realise what it promises; but if it should an∣swer, it will raise the whole, at some future time, to £. 1,200,000.</P>
<P>You must here remark, Mr. Speaker, that this revenue is the produce of <HI>all</HI> the Nabob's do∣minions. During the assignment, the Nabob paid nothing, because the Company had all. Supposing the whole of the lately assigned territory to yield up to the most sanguine expectations of the right ho∣nourable gentleman; and suppose £. 1,200,000 to be annually realized (of which we actually know of no more than the realizing of six hundred thou∣sand) out of this you must deduct the subsidy and rent which the Nabob paid before the assignment, namely, £. 340,000 a year. This reduces back the revenue applicable to the new distribution made by his Majesty's Ministers, to about £. 800,000. Of that sum five-eighths are by them surrendered to the debts. The remaining three are the only fund left for all the purposes so magnificently displayed in the letter of the Board of Control; that is for
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
a new-cast peace establishment; a new fund for ord∣nance and fortifications; and a large allowance for what they call "the splendour of the Durbar."</P>
<P>You have heard the account of these territories as they stood in 1782. You have seen the <HI>actual</HI> re∣ceipt since the assignment in 1781, of which I reckon about two years and a quarter productive. I have stated to you the expectation from the wasted part. For realizing all this, you may value yourselves on the vigour and diligence of a Gover∣nor and Committee that have done so much. If these hopes from the Committee are rational—re∣member that the Committee is no more. Your Ministers, who have formed their fund for these debts on the presumed effect of the Committee's ma∣nagement, have put a complete end to that Com∣mittee. Their acts are rescinded; their leases are broken; their renters are dispersed. Your Minis∣ters knew when they signed the death-warrant of the Carnatic, that the Nabob would not only turn all these unfortunate farmers of revenue out of employ∣ment, but that he has denounced his severest ven∣geance against them, for acting under British au∣thority. With a knowledge of this disposition, a Bri∣tish Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Treasurer of the Navy, incited by no public advantage, impelled by no public necessity, in a strain of the most wan∣ton perfidy which has ever stained the annals of mankind, have delivered over to plunder, imprison∣ment, exile, and death itself, according to the mercy of such execrable tyrants as Amir al Omra and Paul Benfield, the unhappy and deluded souls, who, un∣taught by uniform example, were still weak enough to put their trust in English faith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 5; and for the peculiar hardship of one of the cases, N<SUP>o</SUP></NOTE>. They have gone farther; they have thought proper to mock
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
and outrage their misery by ordering them protec∣tion and compensation. From what power is this protection to be derived? and from what fund is this compensation to arise? The revenues are delivered over to their oppressor; the territorial jurisdiction, from whence that revenue is to arise, and under which they live, is surrendered to the same iron hands: and that they shall be deprived of all refuge, and all hope, the Minister has made a solemn, voluntary declaration, that he never will interfere with the Nabob's internal government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Extract of their Letter in the Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP> 6 A.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The last thing considered by the Board of Con∣trol among the debts of the Carnatic, was that arising to the East India Company, which after the provision for the cavalry, and the consolidation of 1777, was to divide the residue of the fund of £. 480,000 a year with the lenders of 1767. This debt the worthy Chairman, who sits opposite to me, contends to be three millions sterling. Lord Ma∣cartney's account of 1781, states it to be at that pe∣riod £. 1,200,000. The first account of the Court of Directors makes it £. 900,000. This, like the private debt, being without any solid existence, is incapable of any distinct limits. Whatever its amount or its validity may be, one thing is clear; it is of the nature and quality of a public debt. In that light nothing is provided for it, but an eventual surplus to be divided with one class of the private demands, after satisfying the two first classes. Never was a more shameful postponing a public demand, which by the reason of the thing, and the uniform practice of all na∣tions, supersedes every private claim.</P>
<P>Those who gave this preference to private claims, consider the Company's as a lawful de∣mand;
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
else, why did they pretend to provide for it? On their own principles they are condemned.</P>
<P>But I, Sir, who profess to speak to your under∣standing and to your conscience, and to brush away from this business all false colours, all false appellations, as well as false facts, do positively deny that the Carnatic owes a shilling to the Com∣pany; whatever the Company may be indebted to that undone country. It owes nothing to the Company, for this plain and simple reason—The territory charged with the debt is their own. To say that their revenues fall short, and owe them money, is to say they are in debt to themselves, which is only talking nonsense. The fact is, that by the invasion of an enemy, and the ruin of the country, the Company, either in its own name or in the names of the Nabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tanjore, has lost for several years what it might have looked to receive from its own estate. If men were allowed to credit themselves, upon such prin∣ciples any one might soon grow rich by this mode of accounting. A flood comes down upon a man's estate in the Bedford Level of a thousand pounds a year, and drowns his rents for ten years. The Chancellor would put that man into the hands of a trustee, who would gravely make up his books, and for this loss credit himself in his account for a debt due to him of £. 10,000. It is, how∣ever, on this principle the Company makes up its demands on the Carnatic. In peace they go the full length, and indeed more than the full length, of what the people can bear for current establishments; then they are absurd enough to consolidate all the calamities of war into debts; to metamorphose the devastations of the country into demands upon its future production. What is this but to avow a resolution utterly to destroy their own country, and to force the people to pay for
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
their sufferings, to a government which has proved unable to protect either the share of the hushand∣man or their own? In every lease of a farm, the invasion of an enemy, instead of forming a de∣mand for arrear, is a release of rent; nor for that release is it at all necessary to show, that the inva∣sion has left nothing to the occupier of the soil; though in the present case it would be too easy to prove that melancholy fact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is certain that the incursion of a <HI>few</HI> of Hyder's horse into the Jaghire, in 1767, cost the Company upwards of Pagodas 27,000, <HI>in allowances for damages.</HI></Q> Consul∣tations, February 11th, 1771.</NOTE>. I therefore ap∣plauded my right honourable friend, who, when he canvassed the Company's accounts, as a prelimi∣nary to a bill that ought not to stand on falsehood of any kind, fixed his discerning eye, and his de∣ciding hand, on these debts of the Company, from the Nabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tanjore, and at one stroke expunged them all, as utterly irrecove∣rable; he might have added as utterly unfounded.</P>
<P>On these grounds I do not blame the arrange∣ment this day in question, as a preference given to the debt of individuals over the Company's debt. In my eye it is no more than the preference of a fiction over a chimera; but I blame the preference given to those fictitious private debts, over the standing de∣fence and the standing government. It is there the public is robbed. It is robbed in its army; it is robbed in its civil administration; it is robbed in its credit; it is robbed in its investment which forms the commercial connection between that country and Europe. There is the robbery.</P>
<P>But my principal objection lies a good deal deeper. That debt to the Company is the pretext under which all the other debts lurk and cover themselves. That debt forms the foul putrid mucus, in which are engendered the whole brood of creeping ascarides,
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
all the endless involutions, the eternal knot, added to a knot of those inexpugnable tape-worms which de∣vour the nutriment, and eat up the bowels of India<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proceedings at Madras, 11th February 1769, and throughout the correspondence on this subject; particularly Consultations October 4th, 1769, and the Creditors Me∣morial, 20th January 1770.</NOTE>. It is necessary, Sir, you should recollect two things: First, that the Nabob's debt to the Company carries no interest. In the next place you will observe, that whenever the Company has occasion to borrow, she has always commanded whatever she thought fit at eight <HI>per cent.</HI> Carrying in your mind these two facts, attend to the process with regard to the public and the private debt, and with what little appear∣ance of decency they play into each other's hands a game of utter perdition to the unhappy natives of India. The Nabob falls into an arrear to the Company. The Presidency presses for payment. The Nabob's answer is, I have no money. Good. But there are soucars who will supply you on the mortgage of your territories. Then steps forward some Paul Benfield, and from his grateful com∣passion to the Nabob, and his filial regard to the Company, he unlocks the treasures of his virtuous industry; and for a consideration of twenty-four or thirty-six <HI>per cent.</HI> on a mortgage of the territorial revenue, becomes security to the Company for the Nabob's arrear.</P>
<P>All this intermediate usury thus becomes sanc∣tified by the ultimate view to the Company's pay∣ment. In this case, would not a plain man ask this plain question of the Company; If you know that the Nabob must annually mortgage his ter∣ritories to your servants, to pay his annual arrear to you, why is not the assignment or mortgage made directly to the Company itself? By this simple obvious operation, the Company would
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
be relieved and the debt paid, without the charge of a shilling interest to that prince. But if that course should be thought too indulgent, why do they not take that assignment with such interest to themselves as they pay to others, that is eight <HI>per cent.?</HI> Or if it were thought more adviseable (why it should I know not) that he must borrow, why do not the Company lend their own credit to the Nabob for their own payment? That credit would not be weakened by the collateral security of his territorial mortgage. The money might still be had at eight <HI>per cent.</HI> Instead of any of these honest and obvious methods, the Company has for years kept up a shew of disinterestedness and mo∣deration, by suffering a debt to accumulate to them from the country powers without any interest at all; and at the same time have seen before their eyes, on a pretext of borrowing to pay that debt, the revenues of the country charged with an usury of twenty, twenty-four, thirty-six, and even eight-and-forty <HI>per cent.</HI> with compound interest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, E.</NOTE>, for the benefit of their servants. All this time they know that by having a debt subsisting without any in∣terest, which is to be paid by contracting a debt on the highest interest, they manifestly render it necessary to the Nabob of Arcot to give the pri∣vate demand a preference to the public; and by binding him and their servants together in a com∣mon cause, they enable him to form a party to the utter ruin of their own authority, and their own affairs. Thus their false moderation, and their affected purity, by the natural operation of every thing false, and every thing affected, becomes pan∣der and bawd to the unbridled debauchery and li∣centious lewdness of usury and extortion.</P>
<P>In consequence of this double game, all the ter∣ritorial
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
revenues have, at one time or other, been covered by those locusts, the English soucars. Not one single foot of the Carnatic has escaped them; a territory as large as England. During these operations what a scene has that country pre∣sented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For some part of these usurious transactions, see Consul∣tation 28th January 1781; and for the Nabob's excusing his oppressions on account of these debts, Consultation 26th November 1770.
<Q>Still I undertook, first, the payment of the money belonging to the Company, who are my kind friends, and by borrowing, and <HI>mortgaging my jewels,</HI> &amp;c. by <HI>taking from every one of my servants</HI> in proportion to their circumstances, by <HI>fresh severities</HI> also on my country, <HI>notwithstanding its distressed state,</HI> as you know.</Q>
—The Board's remark is as follows; after controverting some of the facts, they say,
<Q>that his countries are oppressed is most certain, but not from real necessity; <HI>his debts indeed have afforded him a constant pretense</HI> for using severities and cruel oppressions.</Q></NOTE>! The usurious European assignee supersedes the Nabob's native farmer of the revenue; the farmer flies to the Nabob's presence to claim his bargain; whilst his servants murmur for wages, and his soldiers mutiny for pay. The mortgage to the European assignee is then resumed, and the native farmer replaced; replaced, again to be removed on the new clamour of the European assignee <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Consultation 28th January 1781, where it is asserted, and not denied, that the Nabob's farmers of revenue, seldom continue for three months together. From this the state of the country may be easily judged of.</NOTE>. Every man of rank and landed fortune being long since extinguished, the remaining miserable last cultivator, who grows to the soil, after having his back scored by the farmer, has it again flayed by the whip of the assignee, and is thus by a rave∣nous, because a short-lived succession of claimants, lashed from oppressor to oppressor, whilst a single drop of blood is left as the means of extorting a single grain of corn. Do not think I paint. Far,
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
very far from it; I do not reach the fact, nor approach to it. Men of respectable condition, men equal to your substantial English yeomen, are daily tied up and scourged to answer the multiplied demands of various contending and contradictory titles, all issuing from one and the same source. Tyrannous exaction brings on servile concealment; and that again calls forth tyrannous coercion. They move in a circle, mutually producing and produced; till at length nothing of humanity is left in the government, no trace of integrity, spirit, or manliness in the people, who drag out a precarious and degraded existence under this system of outrage upon human nature. Such is the effect of the establishment of a debt to the Company, as it has hitherto been managed, and as it ever will remain, until ideas are adopted totally different from those which prevail at this time.</P>
<P>Your worthy ministers, supporting what they are obliged to condemn, have thought fit to renew the Company's old order against contracting private debts in future. They begin by rewarding the vio∣lation of the antient law; and then they gravely re-enact provisions, of which they have given bounties for the breach. This inconsistency has been well exposed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Mr. Fox's Speech.</NOTE>. But what will you say to their having gone the length of giving positive directions for contracting the debt which they positively for∣bid?</P>
<P>I will explain myself. They order the Nabob, out of the revenues of the Carnatic, to allot four hundred and eighty thousand pounds a year, as a fund for the debts before us. For the punctual payment of this annuity, they order him to give <HI>soucar</HI> security<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The amended Letter, Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 6 B.</NOTE>. When a <HI>soucar,</HI> that is a money
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
dealer, becomes security for any native prince, the course is, for the native prince to countersecure the money dealer, by making over to him in mortgage a portion of his territory, equal to the sum annually to be paid, with an interest of at least twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> The point fit for the House to know is, who are these soucars, to whom this security on the revenues in favour of the Nabob's creditors is to be given? The majority of the House, unaccustomed to these transactions, will hear with astonishment that these soucars are no other than the creditors themselves. The Minister, not content with au∣thorizing these transactions in a manner and to an extent unhoped for by the rapacious expectations of usury itself, loads the broken back of the Indian revenues, in favour of his worthy friends the sou∣cars, with an additional twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> for being security to themselves for their own claims; for condescending to take the country in mortgage, to pay to themselves the fruits of their own ex∣tortions.</P>
<P>The interest to be paid for this security, accord∣ing to the most moderate strain of soucar de∣mand, comes to one hundred and eighteen thousand pounds a year, which added to the £.480,000 on which it is to accrue, will make the whole charge on account of these debts on the Carnatic revenues amount to £.598,000 a year, as much as even a long peace will enable those revenues to produce. Can any one reflect for a moment on all those claims of debt, which the Minister exhausts himself in con∣trivances to augment with new usuries, without lifting up his hands and eyes in astonishment of the impudence, both of the claim and the adjudication? Services of some kind or other these servants of the Company must have done, so great and eminent, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot think that all they have brought home is half enough.
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
He halloos after them,
<Q>Gentlemen, you have forgot a large packet behind you, in your hurry; you have not sufficiently recovered yourselves; you ought to have, and you shall have, interest upon interest, upon a prohibited debt that is made up of interest upon interest. Even this is too little. I have thought of another charac∣ter for you, by which you may add something to your gains; you shall be security to yourselves; and hence will rise a new usury, which shall efface the memory of all the usuries suggested to you by your own dull inventions.</Q></P>
<P>I have done with the arrangement relative to the Carnatic. After this it is to little purpose to ob∣serve on what the Ministers have done to Tanjore. Your Ministers have not observed even form and ceremony in their outrageous and insulting robbery of that country, whose only crime has been, its early and constant adherence to the power of this, and the suffering of an uniform pillage in consequence of it. The debt of the Company from the Rajah of Tanjore, is just of the same stuff with that of the Nabob of Arcot.</P>
<P>The subsidy from Tanjore, on the arrear of which this pretended debt (if any there be) has accrued to the Company, is not, like that paid by the Nabob of Arcot, a compensation for vast countries obtained, augmented, and preserved for him; not the price of pillaged treasuries, ran∣sacked houses, and plundered territories.—It is a large grant, from a small kingdom not obtained by our arms; robbed, not protected by our pow∣er; a grant for which no equivalent was ever given, or pretended to be given. The right honourable Gentleman, however, bears witness in his Reports to the punctuality of the pay∣ments of this grant of bounty, or, if you please, of fear. It amounts to one hundred and sixty thou∣sand
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
pound sterling net annual subsidy. He bears witness to a further grant of a town and port, with an annexed district of thirty thousand pound a year, surrendered to the Company since the first donation. He has not borne witness, but the fact is, (he will not deny it) that in the midst of war, and during the ruin and desolation of a consider∣able part of his territories, this prince made many very large payments. Notwithstanding these me∣rits and services, the first regulation of ministry is to force from him a territory of an extent which they have not yet thought proper to ascertain, for a military peace establishment, the particulars of which they have not yet been pleased to settle.</P>
<P>The next part of their arrangement is with re∣gard to war. As confessedly this prince had no share in stirring up any of the former wars, so all future wars are completely out of his power; for he has no troops whatever, and is under a stipu∣lation not so much as to correspond with any fo∣reign state, except through the Company. Yet, in case the Company's servants should be again involved in war, or should think proper again to provoke any enemy, as in times past they have wantonly provoked all India, he is to be subjected to a new penalty. To what penalty?—Why, to no less than the confiscation of all his revenues. But this is to end with the war, and they are to be faithfully returned?—Oh! no; nothing like it. The country is to remain under confiscation until all the debt which the Company shall think fit to incur in such war shall be discharged; that is to say, for ever. His sole comfort is to find his old enemy, the Nabob of Arcot, placed in the very same con∣dition.</P>
<P>The revenues of that miserable country were, before the invasion of Hyder, reduced to a <HI>gross</HI> annual receipt of three hundred and sixty thou∣sand
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
pound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Petrie's evidence before the Select Committee, App.</NOTE>. From this receipt the subsidy I have just stated is taken. This again, by payments in advance, by extorting deposits of additional sums to a vast amount for the benefit of their soucars, and by an endless variety of other extortions, pub∣lic and private, is loaded with a debt, the amount of which I never could ascertain, but which is large undoubtedly, generating an usury the most completely ruinous that probably was ever heard of; <HI>that is, forty-eight per cent, payable monthly, with compound interest</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 8</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such is the state to which the Company's servants have reduced that country. Now come the re∣formers, restorers, and comforters of India. What have they done? In addition to all these tyrannous exactions with all these ruinous debts in their train, looking to one side of an agreement whilst they wilfully shut their eyes to the other, they withdraw from Tanjore all the benefits of the treaty of 1762, and they subject that nation to a perpetual tribute of forty thousand a year to the Nabob of Arcot; a tribute never due, or pretended to be due to <HI>him,</HI> even when he appeared to be something; a tribute, as things now stand, not to a real potentate, but to a shadow, a dream, an incubus of oppression. Af∣ter the Company has accepted in subsidy, in grant of territory, in remission of rent, as a compensation for their own protection, at least two hundred thousand pound a year, without discounting a shil∣ling for that receipt, the Ministers condemn this harassed nation to be tributary to a person who is himself, by their own arrangement, deprived of the right of war or peace; deprived of the power of the sword; forbid to keep up a single regiment of soldiers; and is therefore wholly disabled from all
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
protection of the country which is the object of the pretended tribute. Tribute hangs on the sword. It is an incident inseparable from real so∣vereign power. In the present case to suppose its existence, is as absurd as it is cruel and oppressive. And here, Mr. Speaker, you have a clear exem∣plification of the use of those false names, and false colours, which the Gentlemen who have lately taken possession of India choose to lay on for the purpose of disguising their plan of oppression. The Nabob of Arcot, and Rajah of Tanjore, have, in truth and substance, no more than a merely civil authority, held in the most entire dependence on the Company. The Nabob, without military, with∣out federal capacity, is extinguished as a poten∣tate; but then he is carefully kept alive as an in∣dependent and sovereign power, for the purpose of rapine and extortion; for the purpose of perpetuat∣ing the old intrigues, animosities, usuries, and cor∣ruptions.</P>
<P>It was not enough that this mockery of tribute, was to be continued without the correspondent protection, or any of the stipulated equivalents, but ten years of arrear, to the amount of £. 400,000 sterling, is added to all the debts to the Company, and to individuals, in order to create a new debt, to be paid (if at all possible to be paid in whole or in part) only by new usuries; and all this for the Nabob of Arcot, or rather for Mr. Benfield, and the corps of the Nabob's creditors, and their sou∣cars. Thus these miserable Indian princes are con∣tinued in their seats, for no other purpose than to render them in the first instance objects of every species of extortion; and in the second, to force them to become, for the sake of a momentary shadow of reduced authority, a sort of subordinate tyrants, the ruin and calamity, not the fathers and cherishers, of their people.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="85"/>But take this tribute only as a mere charge (without title, cause, or equivalent) on this people; what one step has been taken to furnish grounds for a just calculation and estimate of the proportion of the burthen and the ability? None; not an at∣tempt at it. They do not adapt the burthen to the strength; but they estimate the strength of the bearers by the burthen they impose. Then what care is taken to leave a fund sufficient to the future reproduction of the revenues that are to bear all these loads? Every one, but tolerably conversant in Indian affairs, must know that the existence of this little kingdom depends on its control over the river Cavery. The benefits of Heaven to any community, ought never to be con∣nected with political arrangements, or made to depend on the personal conduct of princes; in which the mistake, or error, or neglect, or distress, or passion of a moment on either side, may bring famine on millions, and ruin an innocent nation perhaps for ages. The means of the subsistence of mankind should be as immutable as the laws of Nature, let power and dominion take what course they may.—Observe what has been done with regard to this important concern. The use of this river is indeed at length given to the Rajah, and a power provided for its enjoyment <HI>at his own charge</HI>; but the means of furnishing that charge (and a mighty one it is) are wholly cut off. This use of the water, which ought to have no more connexion than clouds and rains, and sunshine, with the politics of the Rajah, the Na∣bob, or the Company, is expressly contrived as a means of enforcing demands and arrears of tri∣bute. This horrid and unnatural instrument of extortion had been a distinguishing feature in the enormities of the Carnatic politics that loudly called for reformation. But the food of a whole
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
people is by the reformers of India conditioned on payments from its prince, at a moment that he is overpowered with a swarm of their demands, with∣out regard to the ability of either prince or people. In fine, by opening an avenue to the irruption of the Nabob of Arcot's creditors and soucars, whom every man who did not fall in love with oppression and corruption on an experience of the ca∣lamities they produced, would have raised wall before wall, and mound before mound, to keep from a possibility of entrance, a more destructive enemy than Hyder Ali is introduced into that kingdom. By this part of their arrangement, in which they establish a debt to the Nabob of Arcot, in effect and substance, they deliver over Tanjore, bound hand and foot, to Paul Benfield, the old be∣trayer, insulter, oppressor, and scourge of a coun∣try, which has for years been an object of an un∣remitted, but unhappily an unequal struggle, be∣tween the bounties of Providence to renovate, and the wickedness of mankind to destroy.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE> talks of his fairness in determining the territorial dispute between the Nabob of Arcot and the prince of that country, when he superseded the determi∣nation of the Directors, in whom the law had vested the decision of that controversy. He is in this just as feeble as he is in every other part. But it is not necessary to say a word in refutation of any part of his argument. The mode of the proceeding sufficiently speaks the spirit of it. It is enough to fix his character as a judge, that he <HI>never heard the Directors in defence of their adjudication, nor either of the parties in support of their respective claims.</HI> It is sufficient for me, that he takes from the Ra∣jah of Tanjore, by this pretended adjudication, or
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
rather from his unhappy subjects, £. 40,000 a year of his and their revenue, and leaves upon his and their shoulders all the charges that can be made on the part of the Nabob, on the part of his creditors, and on the part of the Company, without so much as hearing him as to right or to ability. But what principally induces me to leave the affair of the territorial dispute between the Nabob and the Rajah to another day, is this, that both the parties being stripped of their all, it little signifies under which of their names the un∣happy undone people are delivered over to the merciless soucars, the allies of that right honourable gentleman, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In them ends the account of this long dispute of the Nabob of Arcot, and the Rajah of Tanjore.</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman is of opinion, that his judgment in this case can be censured by none but those who seem to act as if they were paid agents to one of the parties. What does he think of his Court of Directors? If they are paid by either of the parties, by which of them does he think they are paid? He knows that their decision has been directly contrary to his. Shall I believe that it does not enter into his heart to con∣ceive, that any person can steadily and actively interest himself in the protection of the injured and oppressed, without being well paid for his service? I have taken notice of this sort of discourse some days ago, so far as it may be supposed to relate to me. I then contented myself, as I shall now do, with giving it a cold, though a very direct con∣tradiction. Thus much I do from respect to truth. If I did more, it might be supposed, by my anxiety to clear myself, that I had imbibed the ideas, which, for obvious reasons, the right honourable gentleman wishes to have re∣ceived
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
concerning all attempts to plead the cause of the natives of India, as if it were a disreputable employment. If he had not forgot, in his present occupation, every principle which ought to have guided him, and I hope did guide him, in his late profession, he would have known, that he who takes a fee for pleading the cause of distress against power, and manfully performs the duty he has assumed, receives an honourable recompence for a virtuous service. But if the right honourable gen∣tleman will have no regard to fact in his insinua∣tions, or to reason in his opinions, I wish him at least to consider, that if taking an earnest part with regard to the oppressions exercised in India, and with regard to this most oppressive case of Tanjore in particular, can ground a presumption of inte∣rested motives, he is himself the most mercenary man I know. His conduct indeed is such that he is on all occasions the standing testimony against himself. He it was that first called to that case the attention of the House: The Reports of his own Committee are ample and affecting upon that subject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Report IV. Committee of Secrecy, p. 73, and 74; and Appendix in sundry places.</NOTE>; and as many of us as have escaped his massacre, must remember the very pathetic picture he made of the sufferings of the Tanjore country, on the day when he moved the unwieldy code of his Indian resolutions. Has he not stated over and over again in his Reports, the ill treatment of the Rajah of Tanjore, (a branch of the royal house of the Marattas, every injury to whom the Marattas felt as offered to them∣selves) as a main cause of the alienation of that people from the British power? And does he now think, that to betray his principles, to contradict his declarations, and to become himself an active in∣strument

in those oppressions which he had so tragi∣cally lamented, is the way to clear himself of having been actuated by a pecuniary interest, at the time when he chose to appear full of tenderness to that ruined nation?</P>
<P>The right honourable gentleman is fond of pa∣rading on the motives of others, and on his own. As to himself, he despises the imputations of those who suppose that any thing corrupt could influence him in this his unexampled liberality of the public treasure. I do not know that I am obliged to speak to the motives of ministry, in the arrange∣ments they have made of the pretended debts of Arcot and Tanjore. If I prove fraud and collu∣sion with regard to public money on those right honourable gentlemen, I am not obliged to assign their motives; because no good motives can be pleaded in favour of their conduct. Upon that case I stand; we are at issue; and I desire to go to trial. This, I am sure, is not loose railing, or mean insinuation, according to their low and degenerate fashion, when they make attacks on the measures of their adversaries. It is a regular and juridical course; and, unless I choose it, nothing can compel me to go further.</P>
<P>But since these unhappy gentlemen have dared to hold a lofty tone about their motives, and affect to despise suspicion, instead of being careful not to give cause for it, I shall beg leave to lay before you some general observations on what I conceive was their duty in so delicate a business.</P>
<P>If I were worthy to suggest any line of pru∣dence to that right honourable gentleman, I would tell him, that the way to avoid suspicion in the settlement of pecuniary transactions, in which great frauds have been very strongly presumed, is, to attend to these few plain principles:—First, To
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
hear all parties equally, and not the managers for the suspected claimants only.—Not to proceed in the dark; but to act with as much publicity as possible.—Not to precipitate decision.—To be religious in following the rules prescribed in the commission under which we act. And, lastly, and above all, not to be fond of straining con∣structions, to force a jurisdiction, and to draw to ourselves the management of a trust in its nature invidious and obnoxious to suspicion, where the plainest letter of the law does not compel it. If these few plain rules are observed, no corruption ought to be suspected; if any of them are violated, suspicion will attach in proportion. If all of them are violated, a corrupt motive of some kind or other will not only be suspected, but must be vio∣lently presumed.</P>
<P>The persons in whose favour all these rules have been violated, and the conduct of ministers towards them, will naturally call for your consideration, and will serve to lead you through a series and combi∣nation of facts and characters, if I do not mistake, into the very inmost recesses of this mysterious bu∣siness. You will then, be in possession of all the materials on which the principles of sound juris∣prudence will found, or will reject the presump∣tion of corrupt motives; or if such motives are indicated, will point out to you of what particular nature the corruption is.</P>
<P>Our wonderful minister, as you all know, form∣ed a new plan, a plan <HI>insigne recens alio indictum ore,</HI> a plan for supporting the freedom of our consti∣tution by court intrigues, and for removing its corruptions by Indian delinquency. To carry that bold paradoxical design into execution, sufficient funds and apt instruments became necessary. You are perfectly sensible that a Parliamentary Reform occupies his thoughts day and night, as an es∣sential
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
member in this extraordinary project. In his anxious researches upon this subjest, natural instinct, as well as sound policy, would direct his eyes, and settle his choice on Paul Benfield. Paul Benfield is the grand parliamentary reformer, the reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow, and to whom even the right honourable gentleman himself must yield the palm: For what region in the empire, what city, what borough, what county, what tribunal, in this kingdom, is not full of his labours? Others have been only speculators; he is the grand practical reformer; and whilst the Chancellor of the Exchequer pledges in vain the man and the minister, to increase the provincial members, Mr. Benfield has auspiciously and prac∣tically begun it. Leaving far behind him even Lord Camelford's generous design of bestowing Old Sarum on the Bank of England, Mr. Ben∣field has thrown in the borough of Cricklade to reinforce the county representation. Not con∣tent with this, in order tostation a steady phalanx for all future reforms, this public-spirited usurer, amidst his charitable toils for the relief of India, did not forget the poor rotten constitution of his native country. For her, he did not disdain to stoop to the trade of a wholesale upholsterer for this house, to furnish it, not with the faded ta∣pestry figures of antiquated merit, such as decorate, and may reproach some other houses, but with real, solid, living patterns of true modern virtue. Paul Benfield made (reckoning himself) no fewer than eight members in the last parliament. What copious streams of pure blood must he not have transfused into the veins of the present!</P>
<P>But what is even more striking than the real ser∣vices of this new-imported patriot, is his modesty. As soon as he had conferred this benefit on the constitution, he withdrew himself from our ap∣plause.
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
He conceived that the duties of a member of parliament (which with the elect faithful, the true believers, the <HI>Islam</HI> of parliamentary reform, are of little or no merit, perhaps not much better than specious sins) might be as well attended to in India as in England, and the means of refor∣mation to Parliament itself, be far better provided. Mr. Benfield was therefore no sooner elected than he set off for Madras, and defrauded the long∣ing eyes of parliament. We have never enjoyed in this House the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race, and contemplating that visage, which has so long reflected the happiness of na∣tions.</P>
<P>It was therefore not possible for the minister to consult personally with this great man. What then was he to do? Through a sagacity that never failed him in these pursuits, he found out in Mr. Benfield's representative, his exact resemblance. A specific attraction by which he gravitates towards all such characters, soon brought our minister into a close connection with Mr. Benfield's agent and attorney; that is, with the grand contractor (whom I name to honour) Mr. Richard Atkinson; a name that will be well remembered as long as the Records of this House, as long as the Records of the British Treasury, as long as the monumental debt of England, shall endure.</P>
<P>This gentleman, Sir, acts as attorney for Mr. Paul Benfield. Every one who hears me, is well acquainted with the sacred friendship, and the steady mutual attachment that subsists between him and the present minister. As many members as chose to attend in the first session of this par∣liament, can best tell their own feelings at the scenes which were then acted. How much that honourable gentleman was consulted in the origi∣nal frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
Mr. Pitt's India Bill, is matter only of conjecture; though by no means difficult to divine. But the public was an indignant witness of the ostentation with which that measure was made his own, and the authority with which he brought up clause after clause, to stuff and fatten the rankness of that cor∣rupt act. As fast as the clauses were brought up to the table, they were accepted. No hesitation; no discussion. They were received by the new minister, not with approbation, but with implicit submission. The reformation may be estimated, by seeing who was the reformer. Paul Benfield's associate and agent was held up to the world as legislator of Indostan. But it was necessary to authenticate the coalition between the men of in∣trigue in India and the minister of intrigue in Eng∣land, by a studied display of the power of this their connecting link. Every trust, every honour, every distinction, was to be heaped upon him. He was at once made a director of the India Com∣pany; made an alderman of London; and to be made, if ministry could prevail (and I am sorry to say how near, how very near they were pre∣vailing) representative of the capital of this king∣dom. But to secure his services against all risque, he was brought in for a ministerial borough. On his part, he was not wanting in zeal for the common cause. His advertisements shew his motives, and the merits upon which he stood. For your minis∣ter, this worn-out veteran submitted to enter into the dusty field of the London contest; and you all re∣member, that in the same virtuous cause, he sub∣mitted to keep a sort of public office or counting-house, where the whole business of the last general election was managed. It was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of Benfield. It was managed upon Indian principles, and for an Indian interest. This was the golden cup of abominations;
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
this the chalice of the fornications of rapine, usury, and oppression, which was held out by the gorgeous eastern harlot; which so many of the people, so many of the nobles of this land, had drained to the very dregs. Do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch? that no pay∣ment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenness and national prostitution? Here! you have it here before you. The principal of the grand election manager must be indemnified; ac∣cordingly the claims of Benfield and his crew must be put above all enquiry.</P>
<P>For several years, Benfield appeared as the chief proprietor, as well as the chief agent, director, and controller, of this system of debt. The wor∣thy chairman of the Company has stated the claims of this single gentleman on the Nabob of Arcot, as amounting to five hundred thousand pound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Smith's Protest.</NOTE>. Pos∣sibly at the time of the chairman's state, they might have been as high. Eight hundred thousand had been mentioned sometime before<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Madras correspondence on this subject.</NOTE>; and according to the practice of shifting the names of creditors in these transactions, and reducing or raising the debt itself at pleasure, I think it not impossible, that at one period, the name of Benfield might have stood before those frightful figures. But my best information goes to fix his share no higher than four hundred thousand pounds. By the scheme of the present ministry for adding to the principal twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> from the year 1777 to the year 1781, four hundred thousand pounds, that smallest of the sums ever mentioned for Mr. Benfield, will form a capital of £. 592,000, at six <HI>per cent.</HI> Thus, besides the arrears of three years, amounting to £. 106,500 (which, as fast as received, may be legally lent out at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI>) Benfield has received by
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
the ministerial grant before you, an annuity of £. 35,520 a year, charged on the public revenues.</P>
<P>Our mirror of Ministers of finance, did not think this enough for the services of such a friend as Benfield. He found that Lord Macartney, in order to frighten the Court of Directors from the project, of obliging the Nabob to give sou∣car security for his debt, assured them, that if they should take that step, Benfield <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP> 5 A.</NOTE> would in∣fallibly be the soucar; and would thereby become the entire master of the Carnatic. What Lord Macartney thought sufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with Benfield in his iniquities, was the inducement to the two right honourable gentlemen to order this very soucar security to be given, and to recal Benfield to the city of Madras, from the sort of decent exile, into which he had been relegated by Lord Macartney. You must therefore consider Benfield as soucar security for £. 480,000 a year, which at twenty-four <HI>per cent.</HI> (supposing him contented with that profit) will, with the interest of his old debt, produce an an∣nual income of £. 149,520 a year.</P>
<P>Here is a specimen of the new and pure aristo∣cracy created by the right honourable gentleman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Right honourable William Pitt.</NOTE>, as the support of the crown and constitution, against the old, corrupt, refractory, natural interests of this kingdom; and this is the grand counterpoise against all odious coalitions of these interests. A single Benfield outweighs them all; a criminal, who long since ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal, is, by his majesty's ministers, en∣throned in the government of a great kingdom, and enfeoffed with an estate, which in the compa∣rison effaces the splendor of all the nobility of Europe. To bring a little more distinctly into
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
view the true secret of this dark transaction, I beg you particularly to advert to the circumstances which I am going to place before you.</P>
<P>The general corps of creditors, as well as Mr. Benfield himself, not looking well into futurity, nor presaging the minister of this day, thought it not expedient for their common interest, that such a name as his should stand at the head of their list. It was therefore agreed amongst them, that Mr. Benfield should disappear by making over his debt to Messrs. Taylor, Majendie, and Call, and should in return be secured by their bond.</P>
<P>The debt thus exonerated of so great a weight of its odium, and otherwise reduced from its alarming bulk, the agents thought they might ven∣ture to print a list of the creditors. This was done for the first time in the year 1783, during the duke of Portland's administration. In this list the name of Benfield was not to be seen. To this strong negative testimony was added the further testimony of the Nabob of Arcot. That Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix N<SUP>o</SUP> 8.</NOTE> (or rather Mr. Benfield for him) writes to the Court of Directors a letter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dated 13th October. For further illustration of the style in which these letters are written, and the principles on which they proceed, see letters from the Nabob to the Court of Di∣rectors, dated August 16th, and September 7th, 1783, deli∣vered by Mr. James Macpherson, Minister to the Nabob, Ja∣nuary 14th, 1784.</NOTE> full of complaints and accu∣sations against Lord Macartney, conveyed in such terms as were natural for one of Mr. Benfield's ha∣bits and education to employ. Amongst the rest, he is made to complain of his Lordship's endea∣vouring to prevent an intercourse of politeness and sentiment between him and Mr. Benfield; and to aggravate the affront, he expressly declares Mr. Benfield's visits to be only on account of respect
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
and of gratitude, as no pecuniary transactions sub∣sisted between them.</P>
<P>Such, for a considerable space of time, was the outward form of the loan of 1777, in which Mr. Benfield had no sort of concern. At length intelli∣gence arrived at Madras, that this debt, which had always been renounced by the Court of Directors, was rather like to become the subject of something more like a criminal enquiry, than of any patronage or sanction from Parliament. Every ship brought accounts, one stronger than the other, of the preva∣lence of the determined enemies of the Indian sys∣tem. The public revenues became an object despe∣rate to the hopes of Mr. Benfield; he therefore re∣solved to fall upon his associates, and, in viola∣tion of that faith which subsists among those who have abandoned all other, commences a suit in the Mayor's Court against Taylor, Majendie, and Call, for the bond given to him, when he agreed to dis∣appear for his own benefit as well as that of the common concern. The assignees of his debt, who little expected the springing of this mine, even from such an engineer as Mr. Benfield, after recover∣ing their first alarm, thought it best to take ground on the real state of the transaction. They divulged the whole mystery, and were prepared to plead, that they had never received from Mr. Benfield any other consideration for the bond, than a transfer, in trust for himself, of his demand on the Na∣bob of Arcot. An universal indignation arose against the persidy of Mr. Benfield's proceeding: The event of the suit was looked upon as so cer∣tain, that Benfield was compelled to retreat as precipitately as he had advanced boldly; he gave up his bond, and was reinstated in his original de∣mand, to wait the fortune of other claimants. At that time, and at Madras, this hope was dull in∣deed; but at home another scene was preparing.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="98"/>It was long before any public account of this discovery at Madras had arrived in England, that the present minister, and his Board of Control, thought fit to determine on the debt of 1777. The recorded proceedings at this time knew no∣thing of any debt to Benfield. There was his own testimony; there was the testimony of the list; there was the testimony of the Nabob of Arcot against it. Yet such was the minister's feel∣ing of the true secret of this transaction, that they thought proper, in the teeth of all these testimo∣nies, to give him licence to return to Madras. Here the ministers were under some embarrassment. Confounded between their resolution of reward∣ing the good services of Benfield's friends and associates in England, and the shame of sending that notorious incendiary to the court of the Nabob of Arcot, to renew his intrigues against the British government, at the time they authorize his return they forbid him, under the severest penalties, from any conversation with the Nabob or his Ministers; that is, they forbid his communication with the very person on account of his dealings with whom they permit his return to that city. To overtop this contradiction, there is not a word restraining him from the freest intercourse with the Nabob's second son,the real author of all that is done in the Nabob's name; who, in conjunction with this very Ben∣field, has acquired an absolute dominion over that unhappy man, is able to persuade him to put his signature to whatever paper they please, and often without any communication of the con∣tents. This management was detailed to them at full length by Lord Macartney, and they cannot pretend ignorance of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, F.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I believe, after this exposure of facts, no man
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
can entertain a doubt of the collusion of ministers with the corrupt interest of the delinquents in In∣dia. Whenever those in authority provide for the interest of any person, on the real but con∣cealed state of his affairs, without regard to his avowed, public, and oftensible pretences, it must be presumed that they are in confederacy with him, because they act for him on the same fraudulent principles on which he acts for himself. It is plain, that the Ministers were fully apprised of Benfield's real situation, which he had used means to conceal whilst concealment answered his pur∣poses. They were, or the person on whom they relied was, of the cabinet council of Benfield, in the very depth of all his mysteries. An honest magistrate compels men to abide by one story. An equitable judge would not hear of the claim of a man who had himself thought proper to re∣nounce it. With such a judge his shuffling and pre∣varication would have damned his claims; such a judge never would have known, but in order to an∣imadvert upon proceedings of that character.</P>
<P>I have thus laid before you, Mr. Speaker, I think with sufficient clearness, the connection of the ministers with Mr. Atkinson at the general election; I have laid open to you the connection of Atkinson with Benfield; I have shewn Benfield's employment of his wealth, in creating a parlia∣mentary interest, to procure a ministerial protection; I have set before your eyes his large concern in the debt, his practices to hide that concern from the public eye, and the liberal protection which he has received from the minister. If this chain of circumstances do not lead you necessarily to con∣clude that the minister has paid to the avarice of Benfield the services done by Benfield's connections to his ambition, I do not know any thing short of the confession of the party that can persuade

<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
you of his guilt. Clandestine and collusive practice can only be traced by combination and comparison of circumstances. To reject such combination and comparison is to reject the only means of detecting fraud; it is indeed to give it a patent and free licence to cheat with impunity.</P>
<P>I confine myself to the connection of ministers, mediately or immediately, with only two persons concerned in this debt. How many others, who support their power and greatness within and with∣out doors, are concerned originally, or by transfers of these debts, must be left to general opinion. I refer to the Reports of the Select Committee for the proceedings of some of the agents in these affairs, and their attempts, at least, to furnish mi∣nisters with the means of buying general courts, and even whole parliaments, in the gross <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Second Report of Select (General Smith's) Committee.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I know that the ministers will think it little less than acquittal, that they are not charged with hav∣ing taken to themselves some part of the money of which they have made so liberal a donation to their partizans, though the charge may be indisputably fixed upon the corruption of their politics. For my part, I follow their crimes to that point to which legal presumptions and natural indications lead me, without considering what species of evil motive tends most to aggravate or to extenuate the guilt of their conduct. But if I am to speak my private sentiments, I think that in a thousand cases for one it would be far less mischievous to the public, and full as little dishonourable to themselves, to be polluted with direct bribery, than thus to become a standing auxiliary to the oppression, usury, and peculation of multitudes, in order to obtain a cor∣rupt support to their power. It is by bribing, not so often by being bribed, that wicked politicians
<PB N="93" REF="103"/>
bring ruin on mankind. Avarice is a rival to the pursuits of many. It finds a multitude of checks, and many opposers, in every walk of life. But the objects of ambition are for the few; and every person who aims at indirect profit, and therefore wants other protection than innocence and law, instead of its rival, becomes its instrument. There is a natural allegiance and fealty due to this domineering paramount evil, from all the vassal vices, which acknowledge its superiority, and rea∣dily militate under its banners; and it is under that discipline alone that avarice is able to spread to any considerable extent, or to render itself a general public mischief. It is therefore no apology for ministers, that they have not been bought by the East India delinquents, but that they have only formed an alliance with them for screening each other from justice, according to the exigence of their several necessities. That they have done so is evident; and the junction of the power of office in England, with the abuse of authority in the East, has not only prevented even the appearance of re∣dress to the grievances of India, but I wish it may not be found to have dulled, if not extinguished, the honour, the candour, the generosity, the good-nature, which used formerly to characterise the people of England. I confess, I wish that some more feeling than I have yet observed for the suf∣ferings of our fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects in that oppressed part of the world, had manifested itself in any one quarter of the kingdom, or in any one large description of men.</P>
<P>That these oppressions exist, is a fact no more de∣nied, than it is resented as it ought to be. Much evil has been done in India under the British authority. What has been done to redress it? We are no longer surprized at any thing. We are above the unlearned and vulgar passion of ad∣miration.
<PB N="94" REF="104"/>
But it will astonish posterity, when they read our opinions in our actions, that after years of enquiry we have found out that the sole grievance of India consisted in this, That the ser∣vants of the Company there had not profited enough of their opportunities, nor drained it suffi∣ciently of its treasures; when they shall hear that the very first and only important act of a com∣mission specially named by act of parliament, is to charge upon an undone country, in favour of a handful of men in the humblest ranks of the pub∣lic service, the enormous sum of perhaps four mil∣lions of sterling money.</P>
<P>It is difficult for the most wise and upright go∣vernment to correct the abuses of remote delegated power, productive of unmeasured wealth, and pro∣tected by the boldness and strength of the same ill-got riches. These abuses, full of their own wild native vigour, will grow and flourish under mere neglect. But where the supreme authority, not content with winking at the rapacity of its inferior instruments, is so shameless and corrupt as openly to give bounties and premiums for disobedience to its laws; when it will not trust to the activity of avarice in the pursuit of its own gains; when it se∣cures public robbery by all the careful jealousy and attention with which it ought to protect property from such violence; the commonwealth then is be∣come totally perverted from its purposes; neither God nor man will long endure it; nor will it long endure itself. In that case, there is an unnatural infection, a pestilential taint fermenting in the con∣stitution of society, which fever and convulsions of some kind or other must throw off; or in which the vital powers, worsted in an unequal struggle, are pushed back upon themselves, and by a reversal of their whole functions, fester to gangrene, to death; and instead of what was but just now the delight
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
and boast of the creation, there will be cast out in the face of the sun, a bloated, putrid, noisome carcass, full of stench and poison, an offence, a horror, a lesson to the world.</P>
<P>In my opinion, we ought not to wait for the fruitless instruction of calamity to enquire into the abuses which bring upon us ruin in the worst of its forms, in the loss of our fame and virtue. But the right honourable gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas.</NOTE> says, in answer to all the powerful arguments of my honourable friend—
<Q>that this enquiry is of a delicate nature, and that the state will suffer detriment by the exposure of this transaction.</Q>
But it is exposed; it is per∣fectly known in every member, in every particle, and in every way, except that which may lead to a remedy. He knows that the papers of correspon∣dence are printed, and that they are in every hand.</P>
<P>He and delicacy are a rare and a singular coa∣lition. He thinks that to divulge our Indian po∣litics, may be highly dangerous. He! the mover! the chairman! the reporter of the Committee of Secrecy! He that brought forth in the utmost de∣tail, in several vast printed folios, the most recon∣dite parts of the politics, the military, the revenues of the British empire in India. With six great chopping bastards <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Six Reports of the Committee of Secrecy.</NOTE>, each as lusty as an infant Her∣cules, this delicate creature blushes at the sight of his new bridegroom, assumes a virgin delicacy; or, to use a more fit, as well as a more poetic comparison, the person so squeamish, so timid, so trembling lest the winds of heaven should visit too roughly, is expanded to broad sunshine, exposed like the sow of imperial augury, lying in the mud with all the prodigies of her fertility about her, as evidence of her delicate amours — <HI>Triginta ca∣pitum
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
foetus enixa jacebat, alba solo recubans albi circum ubera nati.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst discovery of the misgovernment of others led to his own power, it was wise to enquire: it was safe to publish; there was then no delicacy; there was then no danger. But when his object is obtained, and in his imitation he has outdone the crimes that he had reprobated in volumes of Re∣ports, and in sheets of bills of pains and penalties; then concealment becomes prudence; and it con∣cerns the safety of the state, that we should not know, in a mode of parliamentary cognizance, what all the world knows but too well, that is, in what manner he chooses to dispose of the public revenues to the creatures of his politics.</P>
<P>The debate has been long, and as much so on my part, at least, as on the part of those who have spoken before me. But long as it is, the more mate∣rial half of the subject has hardly been touched on; that is, the corrupt and destructive system to which this debt has been rendered subservient, and which seems to be pursued with at least as much vigour and regularity as ever. If I considered your ease or my own, rather than the weight and importance of this question, I ought to make some apology to you, perhaps some apology to myself, for hav∣ing detained your attention so long. I know on what ground I tread. This subject, at one time taken up with so much fervour and zeal, is no longer a favourite in this House. The House it∣self has undergone a great and signal revolution. To some the subject is strange and uncouth; to several harsh and distasteful; to the reliques of the last parliament it is a matter of fear and apprehen∣sion. It is natural for those who have seen their friends sink in the tornado which raged during the late shift of the monsoon, and have hardly escaped on the planks of the general wreck, it
<PB N="97" REF="107"/>
is but too natural for them, as soon as they make the rocks and quicksands of their former disas∣ters, to put about their new-built barks, and, as much as possible, to keep aloof from this perilous lee shore.</P>
<P>But let us do what we please to put India from our thoughts, we can do nothing to separate it from our public interest and our national reputa∣tion. Our attempts to banish this importunate duty, will only make it return upon us again and again, and every time in a shape more unpleasant than the former. A government has been fabri∣cated for that great province; the right honour∣able Gentleman says, that therefore you ought not to examine into its conduct. Heavens! what an argu∣ment is this! We are not to examine into the con∣duct of the Direction, because it is an old govern∣ment: we are not to examine into this Board of Control, because it is a new one. Then we are only to examine into the conduct of those who have no conduct to account for. Unfortunately the basis of this new government has been laid on old condemned delinquents, and its superstructure is raised out of prosecutors turned into protectors. The event has been such as might be expected. But if it had been otherwise constituted; had it been consti∣tuted even as I wished, and as the mover of this ques∣tion had planned, the better part of the proposed establishment was in the publicity of its proceed∣ings; in its perpetual responsibility to parliament. Without this check, what is our government at home, even awed, as every European government is, by an audience formed of the other States of Europe, by the applause or condemnation of the discerning and critical company before which it acts? But if the scene on the other side of the globe, which tempts, invites, almost compels to tyrannny and rapine, be not inspected with
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
the eye of a severe and unremitting vigilance, shame and destruction must ensue. For one, the worst event of this day, though it may deject, shall not break or subdue me. The call upon us is authoritative. Let who will shrink back, I shall be found at my post. Baffled, discountenanced, subdued, discredited, as the cause of justice and humanity is, it will be only the dearer to me. Whoever therefore shall at any time bring before you any thing towards the relief of our distressed fellow-citizens in India, and towards a subversion of the present most corrupt and oppressive system for its government, in me shall find, a weak I am afraid, but a steady, earnest, and faithful assistant.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">NABOB OF ARCOT'S DEBTS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. GEORGE SMITH being asked, Whether the debts of the Nabob of Arcot have increased since he knew Madras? he said, Yes, they have. He distinguishes his debts into two sorts; those contracted before the year 1766, and those contracted from that year to the year in which he left Madras.—Being asked, What he thinks is the original amount of the old debts? he said, Between twenty-three and twenty-four lacks of pagodas, as well as he can recollect.—Being asked, What was the amount of that debt when he left Madras? he said, Between 4 and 5 lacks of pagodas, as he understood.—Being asked, What was the amount of the new debt when he left Madras? he said, In November 1777 that debt amounted, according to the Nabob's own ac∣count, and published at Chipauk, his place of residence, to sixty lacks of pagodas, independent of the old debt, on which debt of 60 lacks of pagodas, the Nabob did agree to pay an interest of twelve per cent per annum.—Being asked, Whe∣ther this debt was approved of by the Court of Directors? he said, He does not know it was.— Being asked, Whether the old debt was recognized by the Court of Directors? he said, Yes, it has been; and the Court of Directors have sent out repeated orders to the President and Council of Madras, to enforce its recovery and payment.— Being asked, If the interest upon the new debt is punctually paid? he said, It was not during his residence at Madras, from 1777 to 1779, in which period he thinks no more than five per cent. interest was paid, in different dividends of two and one per cent.—Being asked, What is the usual course
<PB N="4" REF="112"/>
taken by the Nabob, concerning the arrears of in∣terest? he said, Not having ever lent him monies himself, he cannot fully answer as to the mode of settling the interest with him.</P>
<P>Being asked, Whether he has reason to believe the 60 lacks of pagodas was all principal money really and truly advanced to the Nabob of Arcot, or a fictitious capital, made up of obligations given by him, where no money or goods were received, or which was increased by the uniting into it a greater interest than the 12 per cent. expressed to be due on the capital? he said, He has no reason to be∣lieve that the sum of 60 lacks of pagodas was lent in money or goods to the Nabob, because that sum he thinks is of more value than all the money, goods, and chattels in the settlement; but he does not know in what mode or manner this debt of the Nabob's was incurred or accumulated.—Being asked, Whether it was not a general and well-grounded opinion at Madras, that a great part of this sum was accumulated by obligations, and were for services performed or to be performed for the Nabob? he said, He has heard that a part of this debt was given for the purposes mentioned in the above question, but he does not know that it was so.—Being asked, Whether it was the general opinion of the settlement? he said, He cannot say that it was the general opinion, but it was the opinion of a considerable part of the settlement.— Being asked, Whether it was the declared opinion of those that were concerned in the debt, or those that were not? he said, It was the opinion of both parties, at least such of them as he conversed with.—Being asked, Whether he has reason to be∣lieve that the interest really paid by the Nabob, upon obligations given, or money lent, did not fre∣quently exceed 12 per cent.? He said, Prior to the first of August 1774, he had had reason to believe,
<PB N="5" REF="113"/>
that a higher interest than 12 per cent. was paid by the Nabob on monies lent to him; but from and after that period, when the last act of parliament took place in India, he does not know that more than 12 per cent. had been paid by the Nabob, or received from him.—Being asked, Whether it is not his opinion, that the Nabob has paid more than 12 per cent. for money due since the 1st of August 1774? he said, He has heard that he has, but he does not know it.—Being asked, Whether he has been told so by any considerable and weighty authority, that was like to know? he said, He has been so informed by persons who he believes had a very good opportunity of knowing it.— Being asked, Whether he was ever told so by the Nabob of Arcot himself? he said, He does not recollect that the Nabob of Arcot directly told him so, but from what he said, he did infer that he paid a higher interest than 12 per cent.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith being asked, Whether, in the course of trade, he ever sold any thing to the Nabob of Arcot? he said, In the year 1775 he did sell to the Nabob of Arcot pearls to the amount of 32,500 pagodas, for which the Nabob gave him an order or tankah on the country of Tanjore, payable in six months, without interest.—Being asked, Whe∣ther, at the time he asked the Nabob his price for the pearls, the Nabob beat down that price, as dealers commonly do? he said, No; so far from it, he offered him more than he asked by 1,000 pago∣das, and which he rejected.—Being asked, Whether, in settling a transaction of discount with the Nabob's agent, he was not offered a greater discount than £. 12 per cent.; he said, In discounting a soucar's bill for 1,80,000 pagodas, the Nabob's agent did offer him a discount of £. 24 per cent. per annum, saying, that it was the usual rate of discount paid by the Nabob; but which he would not accept of,
<PB N="6" REF="114"/>
thinking himself confined by the act of parliament limiting the interest of monies to £. 12 per cent. and accordingly he discounted the bill at £. 12 per cent. per annum only.—Being asked, Whether he does not think those offers were made him, because the Nabob thought he was a person of some con∣sequence in the settlement? he said, Being only a private merchant, he apprehends that the offer was made to him more from its being a general prac∣tice, than from any opinion of his importance.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LETTER from the Committee of Assigned Re∣venue, to the President and Select Committee, dated <DATE>27th May 1782</DATE>; with Comparative State∣ment, and Minute thereon.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Right honourable Lord Macartney, K. B. President, and Governor, &amp;c. Select Committee of Fort St. George.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH we have, in obedience to your commands of the 5th January, regularly laid before you our proceedings at large, and have occa∣sionally addressed you upon such points as required your resolutions or orders for our guidance, we still think it necessary to collect and digest, in a summary report, those transactions in the manage∣ment of the assigned revenue, which have princi∣pally engaged our attention, and which, upon the proceeding, are too much intermixed with ordi∣nary occurrences to be readily traced and under∣stood.</P>
<P>Such a report may be formed with the greater propriety at this time, when your Lordship, &amp;c. have been pleased to conclude your arrangements for the rent of several of the Nabob's districts. Our aim in it is briefly to explain the state of the Carnatic at the period of the Nabob's assignment; the particular causes which existed, to the prejudice of that assignment, after it was made; and the
<PB N="8" REF="116"/>
measures which your Lordship, &amp;c. have, upon our recommendation, adopted for removing those causes, and introducing a more regular and benefi∣cial system of management in the country.</P>
<P>Hyder Ally having entered the Carnatic with his whole force, about the middle of July 1780, and employed fire and sword in its destruction for near eighteen months before the Nabob's assign∣ment took place, it will not be difficult to conceive the state of the country at that period. In those provinces which were fully exposed to the ravages of horse, scarce a vestige remained either of popu∣lation or agriculture: such of the miserable inha∣bitants as escaped the fury of the sword were either carried into the Mysore country, or left to struggle under the horrors of famine. The Arcot and Trichinopoly districts began early to feel the ef∣fects of this desolating war. Tinnevelly, Madura, and Ramnadaporum, though little infested with Hyder's troops, became a prey to the incursions of the Polygars, who stript them of the greatest part of their revenues; Ongole, Nellore, and Pal∣naud, the only remaining districts, had suffered but in a small degree.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of war, however, were not the only evils which the Carnatic experienced. The Nabob's Aumildars, and other servants, appear to have taken advantage of the general confusion to enrich themselves. A very small part of the re∣venue was accounted for; and so high were the ordinary expences of every district, that double the apparent produce of the whole country would not have satisfied them.</P>
<P>In this state, which we believe is no way exagge∣rated, the Company took charge of the assigned countries. Their prospect of relief from the heavy burthens of the war, was indeed but little advanced by the Nabob's concession; and the revenues of
<PB N="9" REF="117"/>
the Carnatic seemed in danger of being irrecovera∣bly lost, unless a speedy and entire change of system could be adopted.</P>
<P>On our minutes of the 21st January, we treated the subject of the assignment at some length, and pointed out the mischiefs which, in addition to the effects of the war, had arisen from what we con∣ceived to be wrong and oppressive management.— We used the freedom to suggest an entire alteration in the mode of realizing the revenues. We pro∣posed a considerable and immediate reduction of expences, and a total change of the principal Aumildars who had been employed under the Nabob.</P>
<P>Our ideas had the good fortune to receive your approbation; but the removal of the Nabob's ser∣vants being thought improper at that particular period of the collections, we employed our at∣tention chiefly in preserving what revenue was left the country, and acquiring such materials as might lead to a more perfect knowledge of its former and present state.</P>
<P>These pursuits, as we apprehended, met with great obstructions from the conduct of the Nabob's servants. The orders they received were evaded under various pretexts; no attention was paid to the strong and repeated applications made to them for the accounts of their management; and their attachment to the Company's interest appeared, in every instance, so feeble, that we saw no prospect whatever of success, but in the appointment of renters under the Company's sole authority.</P>
<P>Upon this principle we judged it expedient to recommend, that such of the Nabob's districts as were in a state to be farmed out, might be imme∣diately let by a public advertisement, issued in the Company's name, and circulated through every province of the Carnatic; and with the view of en∣couraging
<PB N="10" REF="118"/>
bidders, we proposed, that the countries might be advertised for the whole period of the Nabob's assignment, and the security of the Com∣pany's protection promised, in the fullest manner, to such persons as might become renters.</P>
<P>This plan had the desired effect; and the at∣tempts which were secretly made to counteract it, afforded an unequivocal proof of its necessity: But the advantages resulting from it were more pleasingly evinced, by the number of proposals that were delivered, and by the terms which were in general offered for the districts intended to be farmed out.</P>
<P>Having so far attained the purposes of the as∣signment, our attention was next turned to the heavy expences entailed upon the different pro∣vinces; and here, we confess, our astonishment was raised to the highest pitch. In the Trichino∣poly country, the standing disbursements appeared, by the Nabob's own accounts, to be one lack of rupees more than the receipts. In other districts, the charges were not in so high a proportion, but still rated on a most extravagant scale; and we saw, by every account that was brought before us, the absolute necessity of retrenching considera∣bly in all the articles of expence.</P>
<P>Our own reason, aided by such enquiries as we were able to make, suggested the alterations we have recommended to your Lordship, &amp;c. under this head. You will observe, that we have not acted sparingly; but we chose rather, in cases of doubt, to incur the hazard of retrenching too much, than too little; because it would be easier, after any stated allowance for expences, to add what might be necessary, than to diminish. We hope, however, there will be no material increase in the articles as they now stand.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="119"/>One considerable charge upon the Nabob's country was for extraordinary sibbendies, sepoys, and horsemen, who appeared to us to be a very unnecessary incumbrance on the revenue. Your Lordship, &amp;c. have determined to receive such of these people as will enlist into the Company's ser∣vice, and discharge the rest. This measure will not only relieve the country of a heavy burthen, but tend greatly to fix in the Company that kind of authority, which is requisite for the due collec∣tion of the revenues.</P>
<P>In consequence of your determination respecting the Nabob's sepoys, &amp;c. every charge under that head has been struck out of our account of ex∣pences. If the whole number of these people be enlisted by the Company, there will probably be no more than sufficient to complete their ordinary military establishment. But should the present re∣duction of the Nabob's artillery render it expe∣dient, after the war, to make any addition to the Company's establishment, for the purposes of the assigned countries; the expence of such addition, whatever it be, must be deducted from the present account of savings.</P>
<P>In considering the charges of the several dis∣tricts, in order to establish better regulations, we were careful to discriminate those incurred for troops kept, or supposed to be kept up for the de∣fence of the country, from those of the sibbendy, servants, &amp;c. for the cultivation of the lands, and the collection of the revenues, as well as to pay at∣tention to such of the established customs of the country, ancient privileges of the inhabitants, and public charities, as were necessarily allowed, and appeared proper to be continued; but which, un∣der the Nabob's government, were not only rated much higher, but had been blended under one
<PB N="12" REF="120"/>
confused and almost unintelligible title of, Ex∣pences of the districts; so joined, perhaps, to afford pleas and means of secreting and appropriating great part of the revenues to other purposes than fairly appeared; and certainly betraying the ut∣most neglect and mismanagement, as giving lati∣tude for every species of fraud and oppression. Such a system has, in the few latter years of the Nabob's necessities, brought all his countries into that situation, from which nothing but the most rigid oeconomy, strict observance of the conduct of managers, and the most conciliating attention to the rights of the inhabitants, can possibly recover them.</P>
<P>It now only remains for us to lay before your Lordship, &amp;c. the inclosed statement of the sums at which the districts lately advertised have been let, compared with the accounts of their produce delivered by the Nabob, and entered on our pro∣ceedings of the 21st January. Likewise a com∣parative view of their former and present ex∣pences.</P>
<P>The Nabob's accounts of the produce of these districts state, as we have some reason to think, the sums which former renters engaged to pay to him (and which were seldom, if ever, made good) and not the sums actually produced by the districts; yet we have the satisfaction to observe, that the present aggregate rents, upon an average, are equal to those accounts. Your Lordship, &amp;c. cannot indeed expect, that, in the midst of the danger, in∣vasion, and distress, which assail the Carnatic on every side, the renters now appointed will be able at present to fulfil the terms of their leases; but we trust, from the measures we have taken, that very little, if any, of the actual collections will be lost, even during the war; and that, on the return of peace and tranquillity, the renters will have it in
<PB N="13" REF="121"/>
their power fully to perform their respective agree∣ments.</P>
<P>We much regret that the situation of the Arcot province will not admit of the same settlement which has been made for the other districts; but the enemy being in possession of the capital, toge∣ther with several other strong holds, and having entirely desolated the country, there is little room to hope for more from it than a bare subsistence to the few garrisons we have left there.</P>
<P>We shall not fail to give our attention towards obtaining every information respecting this pro∣vince, that the present times will permit; and to take the first opportunity to propose such arrange∣ments for the management as we may think eli∣gible.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract of a Letter from the President and Council of Fort St. George,
<DATE>25th May 1783.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>"ONE of them [the renters] Ram Chunder Raus, was indeed one of those unfortunate Rajahs, whose country, <HI>by being near to the territories of the Nabob,</HI> forfeited its title to independence; and became the prey of ambition and cupidity. This man, though not able to resist the Company's arms, <HI>employed in such a deed at the Nabob's instiga∣gation,</HI> had industry and ability. He acquired, <HI>by a series of services,</HI> even the confidence of the Na∣bob; who suffered him to <HI>rent a part of the country of which he had deprived him of the property.</HI> This man had afforded no motive for his rejection by the Nabob, but that of being ready to engage with the Company; a motive most powerful in∣deed, but not to be avowed."</P>
<P>[This is the person whom the English instruments of the Nabob of Arcot have had the audacity to charge with a corrupt transaction with Lord Ma∣cartney; and, in support of that charge, to pro∣duce a forged letter from his Lordship's steward. The charge and letter, the reader may see in this Appendix, under the proper head. It is asserted, by the unfortunate prince above mentioned, that the Company first settled on the Coast of Coro∣mandel
<PB N="16" REF="124"/>
under the protection of one of his an∣cestors. If this be true (and it is far from unlike∣ly) the world must judge of the return the de∣scendant has met with. The case of another of the victims, given up by the Ministry, though not altogether so striking as the former, is worthy of attention. It is that of the renter of the province of Nellore.]</P>
<P>"IT is, with a wantonness of falshood, and in∣difference to detection, asserted to you, in proof of the validity of the Nabob's objections, that this man's failures had already forced us to remove him; though in fact he has continued invariably in office; though our <HI>greatest supplies have been re∣ceived from him</HI>; and that, in the disappointment of your remittances [the remittances from Bengal] and of other resources, the specie sent us <HI>from Nellore alone</HI> has sometimes enabled us to carry on the public business; and that the <HI>present expedition against the French</HI> must, without <HI>this</HI> assistance from the assignment, have been laid aside, or delayed until it might have become too late."</P>
<P>[This man is by the Ministry given over to the mercy of persons capable of making charges on him, "<HI>with a wantonness of falshood, and indifference to detection.</HI>" What is likely to happen to him and the rest of the victims, may appear by the follow∣ing.]</P>
<LETTER>

<P>THE speedy termination to which the people were taught to look, of the Company's interference in the revenues, and the vengeance denounced against those who, contrary to the mandate of the Durbar, should be connected with them, as report∣ed

<P>The timid disposition of the Hindoo natives of this country was not likely to be insensible to the specimen of that vengeance given by his excel∣lency the Amur, who, upon the mere rumour that a Bramin, of the name of Appagee Row, had given proposals to the Company for the rentership of Vellore, had the temerity to send for him, and to put him in confinement.</P>
<P>"A man thus seized by the Nabob's seapoys within the walls of Madras, gave a general alarm; and government found it necessary to promise the protection of the Company, in order to calm the apprehensions of the people.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXTRACT of a Letter from the Council and Select Committee at Fort St. George, to the Go∣vernor General and Council, dated
<DATE>25th May 1783.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN the prosecution of our duty, we beseech you to consider as an act of strict and necessary justice, previous to reiteration of your orders for the surrender of the assignment, how far it would be likely to affect third persons, who do not ap∣pear to have committed any breach of their en∣gagements. You command us to compel our aumils to deliver over their respective charges as shall be appointed by the Nabob, or to retain
<PB N="18" REF="126"/>
their trust under his sole authority, if he shall chuse to confirm them. These aumils are really renters, they were appointed in the room of the Nabob's aumils, and contrary to his wishes; they have already been rejected by him, and are there∣fore not likely to be confirmed by him. They ap∣plied to this government, in consequence of public advertisements in our name, as possessing in this instance the joint authority of the Nabob and the Company, and have entered into mutual and strict covenants with us, and we with them, re∣lative to the certain districts not actually in the possession of the enemy; by which covenants, as they are bound to the punctual payment of their rents, and due management of the country, so we, and our constituents, and the public faith, are in like manner bound to maintain them in the en∣joyment of their leases, during the continuance of the term; that term was for five years, agreeably to the words of the assignment, which declare that the time of renting shall be for three or five years, as the governor shall settle with the renters, —Their leases cannot be legally torn from them. Nothing but their previous breach of a part could justify our breach of the whole; such a stretch and abuse of power would indeed not only favour of the assumption of sovereignty, but of arbitrary and oppressive despotism. In the present contest, whether the Nabob be guilty, or we be guilty, the renters are not guilty. Which ever of the con∣tending parties has broken the condition of the assignment, the renters have not broken the con∣dition of their leases. These men, in conducting the business of the assignment, have acted in op∣position to the designs of the Nabob, in despite of the menaces denounced against all who should dare to oppose the mandates of the Durbar justice. Gratitude and humanity require that provision
<PB N="19" REF="127"/>
should be made by you, before you set the Nabob's ministers loose on the country, for the protection of the victims devoted to their vengeance.</P>
<P>Mr. Benfield, to secure the permanency of his power, and the perfection of his schemes, thought it necessary to render the Nabob an absolute stranger to the state of his affairs. He assured his highness, that full justice was not done to the strength of his sentiments, and the keenness of his attacks, in the translations that were made by the Company's servants from the original Persian of his letters. He therefore proposed to him, that they should for the future be transmitted in Eng∣lish.—Of the English language or writing his highness, or the ameer, cannot read one word, tho' the latter can converse in it with sufficient fluency. The Persian language, as the language of the Ma∣hommedan conquerors, and of the court of Delhi, as an appendage or signal of authority, was at all times particularly affected by the Nabob:—it is the language of all acts of state, and all public transctions, among the mussulman chiefs of In∣dostan. The Nabob thought to have gained no inconsiderable point, in procuring the correspon∣dence from our predecessors to the Rajah of Tan∣jore to be changed from the Marattah language, which that Hindoo prince understands, to the Persian, which he disclaims understanding. To force the Rajah to the Nabob's language, was gra∣tifying the latter with a new species of subser∣viency. He had formerly contended with consider∣able anxiety, and it was thought no inconsiderable cost, for particular forms of address to be used towards him in that language. But all of a sudden, in favour of Mr. Benfield, he quits his former affections, his habits, his knowledge, his curiosity, the increasing mistrust of age, to throw himself upon the generous candour, the faithful interpretation, the
<PB N="20" REF="128"/>
grateful return and eloquent organ of Mr. Benfield! —<HI>Mr. Benfield relates and reads what he pleases to his excellency the Ameer-ul-Omrah—his excellency com∣municates with the Nabob his father, in the language the latter understands. Through two channels so pure, the truth must arrive at the Nabob in perfect refine∣ment; through this double trust, his highness receives whatever impression it may be convenient to make on him: he abandons his signature to whatever paper they tell him contains, in the English language, the sen∣timents with which they had inspired him. He thus is surrounded on every side. He is totally at their mercy, to believe what is not true, and to subscribe to what he does not mean. There is no system so new, so foreign to his intentions, that they may not pursue in his name, without possibility of detection: for they are cautious of who approach him, and have thought prudent to decline, for him, the visits of the governor,</HI> even upon the usual solemn and acceptable occasion of delivering to his highness the Company's letters. <HI>Such is the com∣plete ascendency gained by Mr. Benfield.</HI> It may be partly explained by the facts observed already some years ago by Mr. Benfield himself, in regard to the Nabob, of the infirmities natural to his advanced age, joined to the decays of his constitution. To this ascendency, in proportion as it grew, must chiefly be ascribed, if not the origin, at least the continuance and increase, of the Nabob's disunion with this presidency; a disunion which creates the importance, and subserves the resentments of Mr. Benfield; <HI>and an ascedency, which, if you effect the surrender of the assignment, will entirely leave the exercise of power, and accumulation of fortune, at his boundless discretion; to him, and to the Ameer-ul-Omrah, and to Syed Assam Cawn, the assignment would in fact be surrendered.</HI> HE WILL (IF ANY) BE THE SOUCAR SECURITY; <HI>and security in this country is countersecured by possession. You would not
<PB N="21" REF="129"/>
chuse to take the assignment from the Company, to give it to individuals.</HI> Of the impropriety of its returning to the Nabob, Mr. Benfield would now again argue from his former observations, that under his high∣ness's management, his country declined, his people emigrated, his revenues decreased, and his coun∣try was rapidly approaching to a state of political insolvency. Of Syed Assam Cawn, we judge only from the observations this letter already contains. But of the other two persons [Ameer-ul-Omrah and Mr. Benfield] we undertake to declare, not as parties in a cause, or even as voluntary witnesses, but as executive officers, reporting to you in the dis∣charge of our duty, and under the impression of the sacred obligation which binds us to truth, as well as to justice, that, from every observation of their principles and dispositions, and every information of their character and conduct, they have prose∣cuted projects to the injury and danger of the Company and individuals; <HI>that it would be im∣proper to trust, and dangerous to employ them, in any public or important situation; that the tranquillity of the Carnatic requires a restraint to the power of the Ameer; and that the Company, whose service and protection Mr. Benfield has repeatedly and recently for∣feited, would be more secure against danger and confu∣sion, if he were removed from their several presiden∣cies</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">[After the above solemn declaration from so weighty an authority, the principal object of that awful and deliberate warning, instead of "being removed from the several Presidencies," is licensed to return to one of the principal of those Presidencies, and the grand theatre of the operations on account of which the Presidency recommends his total removal. The reason given is for the accommodation of that very debt which has been the chief instrument of his dangerous practices, and the main cause of all the confusions in the Company's government.]</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXTRACTS from the Evidence of Mr. Petrie, late Resident for the Company at Tanjore, given to the Select Committee, relative to the Reve∣nues and State of the Country, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>9th May 1782.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM PETRIE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> attending ac∣cording to order, was asked, In what station he was in the Company's service? he said, He went to India in the year 1765, a writer upon the Madras establishment; he was employed, during the former war with Hyder Ali, in the capacity of paymaster and commissary to part of the army, and was afterwards paymaster and commissary to the army in the first siege of Tanjore, and the subse∣quent campaigns; then secretary to the secret de∣partment from 1772 to 1775; he came to England in 1775, and returned again to Madras the begin∣ning of 1778; he was resident at the durbar of the Rajah of Tanjore from that time to the month of May; and from that time to January 1780 was chief of Nagore and Carrecal, the first of which was received from the Rajah of Tanjore, and the second was taken from the French.—Being asked, Who sent him to Tanjore? he said, Sir Thomas Rumbold, and the Secret Committee.—Being then asked, upon what errand? he said, He went first up with a letter from the Company to the Rajah of Tanjore; he was directed to give the Rajah the strongest assurances that he should be kept in pos∣session of his country, and every privilege to which he had been restored; he was likewise directed to negociate with the Rajah of Tanjore for the ces∣sion of the sea-ports and district of Nagore, in
<PB N="23" REF="131"/>
lieu of the town and district of Devicotta, which he had promised to Lord Pigot: these were the principal, and to the best of his recollection at present the only objects in view, when he was first sent up to Tanjore. In the course of his stay at Tanjore other matters of business occurred be∣tween the Company and the Rajah, which came under his management as resident at that durbar. —Being asked, Whether the Rajah did deliver up to him the town and the annexed districts of Na∣gore voluntarily, or whether he was forced to it? he said, When he made the first proposition to the Rajah, agreeable to the directions he had received from the Secret Committee at Madras, in the most free, open, and liberal manner, the Rajah told him the sea-port of Nagore was entirely at the service of his benefactors the Company, and that he was happy in having that opportunity of testi∣fying his gratitude to them; these may be supposed to be words of course, but from every experience which he had of the Rajah's mind and conduct, whilst he was at Tanjore, he has reason to believe that his declarations of gratitude to the Company were perfectly sincere; he speaks of the town of Nagore at present, and a certain district, not of the districts to the amount of which they afterwards received. The Rajah asked him, To what amount he expected a jaghire to the Company: And the witness further said, That he acknowledged to the Committee that he was not instructed upon that head; that he wrote for orders to Madras, and was directed to ask the Rajah for a jaghire to a certain amount; that this gave rise to a long ne∣gociation, the Rajah representing to him his ina∣bility to make such a gift to the Company as the Secret Committee at Madras seemed to expect; while he (the witness) on the other hand, was di∣rected to make as good a bargain as he could for
<PB N="24" REF="132"/>
the Company. From the view that he then took of the Rajah's finances, from the situation of his country, and from the load of debt which pressed hard upon him, he believes he at different times, in his correspondence with the government, repre∣sented the necessity of their being moderate in their demands, and it was at last agreed to accept of the town of Nagore, valued at a certain annual reve∣nue, and a jaghire annexed to the town, the whole amounting to 2,50,000 rupees.—Being asked, Whe∣ther it did turn out so valuable? he said, He had not a doubt but it would turn out more, as it was let for more than that to farmers at Madras, if they had managed the districts properly, <HI>but they were strangers to the manners and customs of the people; when they came down they oppressed the in∣habitants, and threw the whole district into confusion; the inhabitants, many of them, left the country, and deserted the cultivation of their lands, of course the farmers were disappointed of their collections, and they have since failed, and the Company have lost a con∣siderable part of what the farmers were to pay for the jaghire.</HI>—Being asked, Who these farmers were? he said, One of them was the renter of the St. Thomé district, near Madras, and the other, and the most responsible, was a Madras dubash.—Being asked, Who he was dubash to? He said, To Mr. Cass∣major.</P>
<P>Being asked, Whether the lease was made upon higher terms than the district was rated to him by the Rajah? he said, It was.—Being then asked, What reason was assigned why the district was not kept under the former management by amildars, or let to persons in the Tanjore country acquaint∣ed with the district? he said, No reasons were as∣signed: he was directed from Madras to adver∣tise them to be let to persons of the country; but before he received any proposal, he received ac∣counts
<PB N="25" REF="133"/>
that they were let at Madras in consequence of public advertisements which had been made there: he believes, indeed, there were very few men in those districts responsible enough to have been entrusted with the management of those lands. —Being asked, Whether, at the time he was au∣thorized to negociate for Nagore in the place of Devicotta, Devicotta was given up to the Rajah? he said, No.—Being asked, Whether the Rajah of Tanjore did not frequently desire that the districts of Arné and Hanymantygoodé should be restored to him, agreeable to treaty, and the Company's orders to Lord Pigot? he said, Many a time; and he transmitted his representations regularly to Ma∣dras. — Being then asked, Whether those places were restored to him? he said, Not while he was in India.</P>
<P>Being asked, Whether he was not authorized and required by the Presidency at Madras to de∣mand a large sum of money over and above the four lacks of pagodas that were to be annually paid by a grant of the Rajah, made in the time of Lord Pigot? he said, He was; to the amount, he believes, of four lacks of pagodas, common∣ly known by the name of deposit-money.—Being asked, Whether the Rajah did not frequently plead his inability to pay that money? he said, He did every time he mentioned it, and complained loud∣ly of the demand. — Being asked, Whether he thinks those complaints were well founded? he says, He thinks the Rajah of Tanjore was not only not in a state of ability to pay the deposit-money, but that the annual payment of four lacks of pagodas was more than his revenues could af∣ford. —Being asked, Whether he was not fre∣quently obliged to borrow money, in order to pay the instalments of the annual payments, and such parts as he paid of the deposit? he said, Yes,
<PB N="26" REF="134"/>
he was.—Being asked, Where he borrowed the money? he said, He believes principally from soucars or native bankers, and some at Madras, as he told him.—Being asked, Whether he told him that his credit was very good, and that he borrowed upon moderate interest? he said, That he told him he found great difficulties in raising money, and was obliged to borrow at a most ex∣orbitant interest, even some of it at 48 <HI>per cent.</HI> and he believes not a great deal under it: <HI>he de∣sired him (the witness) to speak to one of the soucars or bankers at Tanjore, to accommodate him with a loan of money; that man shewed him an account between him and the Rajah, from which it appeared that he charged</HI> 48 <HI>per cent. besides compound interest.</HI>—Being asked, Whether the sums due were large? he said, Yes, they were considerable; though he does not recollect the amount.—Being asked, Whether the banker lent the money? he said, He would not, unless the witness could procure him payment of his old arrears.</P>
<P>Being asked, What notice did the government of Madras take of the King of Tanjore's repre∣sentations of the state of his affairs, and his ina∣bility to pay? he said, He does not recollect that, in their correspondence with him, there was any reasoning upon the subject; and in his corre∣spondence with Sir Thomas Rumbold, upon the amount of the jaghire, he seemed very desirous of adopting the demand of government to the Ra∣jah's circumstances; but whilst he staid at Tan∣jore, the Rajah was not exonerated from any part of his burthens.—Being asked, Whether they ever desired the Rajah to make up a statement of his accounts, disbursements, debts, and payments, to the Company, in order to ascertain whether the country was able to pay the increasing demands upon it? he said, Through him he is certain they
<PB N="27" REF="135"/>
never did.—Being then asked, If he ever heard whether they did through any one else? he said, He never did.</P>
<P>Being asked, Whether the Rajah is not bound to furnish the cultivators of land with seed for their crops, according to the custom of the country? he said, <HI>The king of Tanjore, as proprietor of the land, always makes advances of money for seed for the cultivation of the land.</HI>—Being then asked, If mo∣ney beyond his power of furnishing should be ex∣torted from him, might it not prevent, in the first instance, the means of cultivating the country? he said, It certainly does, <HI>he knows it for a fact; and he knows that when he left the country there were several districts which were uncultivated from that cause.</HI>—Being asked, Whether it is not ne∣cessary to be at a considerable expence in order to keep up the mounds and water-courses? He said, <HI>A very considerable one annually.</HI> — Being asked, What would be the consequence if money should fail for that? he said, <HI>In the first instance the country would be partially supplied with water, some districts would be overflowed, and others would be parched.</HI>—Being asked, Whether there is not a considerable dam, called the Anicut, on the keeping up of which the prosperity of the coun∣try greatly depends, and which requires a great expence? he said, Yes, there is; the whole of the Tanjore country is admirably well supplied with water, nor can he conceive any method could be fallen upon more happily adapted to the culti∣vation and prosperity of the country; but, as the Anicut is the source of that prosperity, any injury done to that must essentially affect all the other works in the country; it is a most stupendous piece of masonry, but from the very great floods frequently requiring repairs, which if neglected not only the expence of repairing must be greatly
<PB N="28" REF="136"/>
increased, but a general injury done to the whole country.—Being asked, Whether that dam has been kept in as good preservation since the preva∣lence of the English government as before? he said, From his own knowledge he cannot tell, but from every thing he has read or heard of the for∣mer prosperity and opulence of the kings of Tanjore, he should suppose not.—Being asked, Whether he does not know of several attempts that have been made to prevent the repair, and even to damage the work? he said, The Rajah himself frequently complained of that to him, and he has likewise heard it from others at Tanjore.—Being asked, Who it was that attempted those acts of violence? he said, He was told it was the inhabitants of the Nabob's country adjoining to the Anicut.—Being asked, Whether they were not set on or instigated by the Nabob? he answered, The Rajah said so.—And being asked, What steps the President and Coun∣cil took to punish the authors, and prevent those violences? he said, To the best of his recollec∣tion, the Governor told him he would make en∣quiries into it, but he does not know that any en∣quiries were made: That Sir Thomas Rumbold, the Governor, informed him that he had laid his representations with respect to the Anicut before the Nabob, who denied that his people had given any interruption to the repairs of that work.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>10th May.</HEAD>
<P>Being asked, What he thinks the real clear receipt of the revenues of Tanjore were worth when he left it? he said, He cannot say what was the net amount, as he does not know the expence of the Rajah's col∣lection, but while he was at Tanjore he understood from the Rajah himself, and from his ministers, that the gross collection did not exceed 9 lacks of pa∣godas
<PB N="29" REF="137"/>
(£. 360,000).—Being asked, Whether he thinks the country could pay the 8 lacks of pago∣das which had been demanded to be paid in the course of one year? he said, Clearly not.—Being asked, Whether there was not an attempt made to remove the Rajah's minister, upon some delay in payment of the deposit? he said, The Governor of Madras wrote to that effect, which he represented to the Rajah.—Being asked, Who was mentioned to succeed to the Minister that then was, in case he should be removed? he said, When Sir Hector Munro came afterwards to Tanjore, the old Dau∣biere was mentioned, and recommended to the Rajah as successor to his then Dewan.—Being asked, Of what age was the Daubiere at that time? he said, Of a very great age, upwards of fourscore. —Being asked, Whether a person called Kanonga Saba Pilla was not likewise named? he said, Yes, he was, he was recommended by Sir Thomas Rumbold; and one recommendation as well as I can recollect, went through me.—Being asked, What was the reason of his being recommended? he said, He undertook to pay off the Rajah's debts, and to give security for the regular payment of the Ra∣jah's instalments to the Company.—Being asked, Whether he offered to give any security for preserv∣ing the country from oppression, and for support∣ing the dignity of the Rajah and his people? he said, He does not know that he did, or that it was asked of him.—Being asked, Whether he was a per∣son agreeable to the Rajah? he said, He was not.— Being asked, Whether he was not a person who had fled out of the country to avoid the resentment of the Rajah? he said, He was.—Being asked, Whe∣ther he was not charged by the Rajah with mal-prac∣tices, and breach of trust relative to his effects? he said, He was; but he told the Governor that he would account for his conduct, and explain every
<PB N="30" REF="138"/>
thing to the satisfaction of the Rajah.—Being asked, Whether the Rajah did not consider this man as in the interest of his enemies, and particularly of the Nabob of Arcot and Mr. Benfield? he said, He does not recollect that he did mention that to him; he remembers to have heard him complain of a transaction between Kanonga Saba Pilla and Mr. Benfield; but he told him he had been guilty of a variety of mal-practices in his administration, that he had oppressed the people, and defrauded him.— Being asked, In what branch of business the Rajah had formerly employed him? he said, He was at one time, he believes, renter of the whole country, was supposed to have great influence with the Rajah, and was in fact Dewan some time.—Being asked, Whether the nomination of that man was not par∣ticularly odious to the Rajah? he said, He found the Rajah's mind so exceedingly averse to that man, that he believes he would almost as soon have sub∣mitted to his being deposed, as to submit to the nomination of that man to be his prime minister.</P>

<P>MR. PETRIE being asked, Whether he was in∣formed by the Rajah, or by others, at Tanjore or Madras, that Mr. Benfield, whilst he managed the revenues at Tanjore, during the usurpation of the Nabob, did not treat the inhabitants with great rigour? he said, He did hear from the Rajah, that Mr. Benfield did treat the inhabitants with rigour during the time he had any thing to do with the administration of the revenues of Tanjore.—Being asked, If he recollects in what particulars? he said, The Rajah particularly complained, that grain had been delivered out to the inhabitants, for the pur∣poses of cultivation, at a higher price than the market price of grain in the country; he cannot
<PB N="31" REF="139"/>
say the actual difference of price, but it struck him at the time as something very considerable.— Being asked, Whether that money was all recovered from the inhabitants? he said, The Rajah of Tan∣jore told him, that the money was all recovered from the inhabitants.—Being asked, Whether he did not hear that the Nabob exacted from the country of Tanjore, whilst he was in possession of it? he said, From the accounts which he received at Tan∣jore, of the revenues for a number of years past, it appeared, that the Nabob collected from the country, while he was in possession, rather more than 16 lacks of pagodas annually; whereas, when he was at Tanjore, it did not yield more than 9 lacks.—Being asked, From whence that difference arose? he said, when Tanjore was conquered for the Nabob, he has been told that many thousand of the native inhabitants fled from the country, some into the southern provinces, some into the country of Mysore, and others into the domi∣nions of the Marattas; he understood from the same authority, that while the Nabob was in pos∣session of the country, many inhabitants from the Carnatic, allured by the superior fertility and opu∣lence of Tanjore, and encouraged by the Nabob, took up their residence there, which enabled the Nabob to cultivate the whole country; and, upon the restoration of the Rajah, he has heard that the Carnatic inhabitants were carried back to their own country, which left a considerable blank in the population, which was not re-placed while he was there, principally owing to an opinion which prevailed through the country, that the Rajah's government was not to be permanent, but that an∣other revolution was fast approaching. During the Nabob's government the price of grain was considerably higher (owing to a very unusual scar∣city in the Carnatic) than when he was in Tan∣jore.
<PB N="32" REF="140"/>
—Being asked, Whether he was ever in the Marawar country? he said, Yes; he was commis∣sary to the army in that expedition.—Being asked, Whether that country was much wasted by the war? he said, Plunder was not permitted to the army, nor did the country suffer from its operations, ex∣cept in causing many thousands of the inhabitants who had been employed in the cultivation of the country to leave it.—Being asked, Whether he knows what is done with the palace and inhabitants of Ramnaut? he said, The town was taken by storm, but not plundered by the troops; it was immediately delivered up to the Nabob's eldest son.—Being asked, Whether great riches were not supposed to be in that palace and temple? he said, It was universally believed so.—Being asked, What account was given of them? he said, He cannot tell; every thing remained in the possession of the Nabob.—Being asked, What became of the chil∣dren and women of the family of the prince of that country? he said, The Rajah was a minor; the government was in the hands of the Ranny, his mother; from general report he has heard they were carried to Trichinopoly, and placed in con∣finement there.—Being asked, Whether he per∣ceived any difference in the face of the Carnatic when he first knew it, and when he last knew it? he said, He thinks he did, particularly in its popu∣lation.—Being asked, Whether it was better or worse? he said, It was not so populous.—Being asked, What is the condition of the Nabob's eldest son? he said, He was in the Black Town of Madras, when he left the country.—Being asked, Whether he was entertained there in a man∣ner suitable to his birth and expectations? he said, No; he lived there without any of those exterior marks of splendor which princes of his rank in India are particularly fond of.—Being asked, Whe∣ther
<PB N="33" REF="141"/>
he has not heard that his appointments were poor and mean? he said, He has heard that they were not equal to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank and expectations.—Being asked, Whether he had any share in the govern∣ment? he said, He believes none; for some years past the Nabob has delegated most of the powers of government to his second son—Being asked, Whether the Rajah did not complain to him of the behaviour of Mr. Benfield to himself personally; and what were the particulars? he said, He did so, and related to him the following particulars: About fifteen days after Lord Pigot's confinement, Mr. Benfield came to Tanjore, and delivered the Rajah two letters from the then Governor, Mr. Stratton, one public, and the other private; he demanded an immediate account of the presents which had been made to Lord Pigot, payment of the tunkahs, which he (Mr. Benfield) had received from the Nabob upon the country; and that the Rajah should only write such letters to the Madras government as Mr. Benfield should approve, and give to him: the Rajah answered, that he did not acknowledge the validity of any demands made by the Nabob upon the country; that those tun∣kahs related to accounts which he (the Rajah) had no concern with; that he never had given Lord Pigot any presents, but Lord Pigot had given him many; and that, as to his correspondence with the Ma∣dras government, he would not trouble Mr. Ben∣field, because he would write his letters himself— That the Rajah told the witness, that by reason of this answer he was much threatened, in consequence of which he desired Colonel Harper, who then commanded at Tanjore, to be present at his next interview with Mr. Benfield; when Mr. Benfield denied many parts of the preceding conversation, and threw the blame upon his interpreter Comroo. When Mr. Benfield found (as the Rajah informed
<PB N="34" REF="142"/>
him) that he could not carry these points, which had brought him to Tanjore, he prepared to set off for Madras; that the Rajah sent him a letter which he had drawn out, in answer to one which Mr. Ben∣field had brought him; that Mr. Benfield disap∣proved of the answer, and returned it by Comroo to the Durbar, who did not deliver it into the Rajah's hands, but threw it upon the ground, and expressed himself improperly to him.</P>
<P>Being asked, Whether it was at the King of Tanjore's desire, that such persons as Mr. Benfield and Comroo had been brought into his presence?— he said, The Rajah told him, that when Lord Pigot came to Tanjore, to restore him to his dominions, Comroo, without being sent for, or desired to come to the palace, had found means to get access to his person; he made an offer of introducing Mr. Ben∣field to the Rajah, which he declined.—Being asked, Whether the military officer commanding there protected the Rajah from the intrusion of such people? he said, The Rajah did not tell him that he called upon the military officer to prevent these intrusions; but that he desired Colonel Harper to be present as a witness to what might pass be∣tween him and Mr. Benfield.—Being asked, If it is usual for persons of the conditions and occupa∣tions of Mr. Benfield and Comroo to intrude them∣selves into the presence of the Princes of the country, and to treat them with such freedom? he said, Certainly it is not; less there than in any other country.—Being asked, Whether the King of Tanjore has no Ministers to whom application might be made to transact such business as Mr. Benfield and Comroo had to do in the country? he said, Undoubtedly; his minister is the person whose province it is to transact that business.— Being asked, Before the invasion of the British troops into Tanjore, what would have been the
<PB N="35" REF="143"/>
consequence, if Mr. Benfield had intruded himself into the Rajah's presence, and behaved in that manner? he said, He could not say what would have been the consequence; but the attempt would have been madness, and could not have happened.— Being asked, Whether the Rajah had not particular exceptions to Comroo, and thought he had betrayed him in very essential points? he said, Yes, he had.— Being asked, Whether the Rajah has not been ap∣prised that the Company have made stipulations, that their Servants should not interfere in the con∣cerns of his government? he said, He signified it to the Rajah, that it was the Company's positive orders, and that any of their Servants so interfer∣ing would incur their highest displeasure.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, N<SUP>o</SUP> 8. Referred to from p. 75, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commissioners amended clauses for the Fort St. George dispatch, relative to the indeterminate rights and pretensions of the Nabob of Arcot, and Rajah of Tanjore.</HEAD>
<P>IN our letter of the 28th January last, we stated the reasonableness of our expectation that certain contributions towards the expences of the war, should be made by the Rajah of Tanjore. Since writing that letter, we have received one from the Rajah, of the 15th of October last, which contains at length his representations of his inability to make such further payment. We think it unnecessary here to discuss whether these representations are or are not exaggerated, because, from the explanations we have given of our wishes
<PB N="36" REF="144"/>
for a new arrangement in future, both with the Nabob of Arcot, and the Rajah of Tanjore, and the directions we have given you to carry that arrangement into execution, we think it impolitic to insist upon any demands upon the Rajah for the expences of the late war, beyond the sum of four lacks of pagodas annually; such a demand might tend to interrupt the harmony which should prevail between the Company and the Rajah, and impede the great objects of the general system we have already so fully explained to you.</P>
<P>But although it is not our opinion that any fur∣ther claim should be made on the Rajah, for his share of the extraordinary expences of the late war, it is by no means our intention in any man∣ner to affect the just claim which the Nabob has on the Rajah for the arrears due to him on ac∣count of peshcush, for the regular payment of which we became guarantee by the treaty of 1762; but we have already expressed to you our hopes that the Nabob may be induced to allow these ar∣rears and the growing payments, when due, to be received by the Company, and carried in discharge of his debt to us. You are at the same time to use every means to convince him, that when this debt shall be discharged, it is our intention, as we are bound by the above treaty, to exert ourselves to the utmost of our power to insure the constant and regular payment of it into his own hands.</P>
<P>We observe, by the plan sent to us by our go∣vernor of Fort St. George, on the 30th October 1781, that an arrangement is there proposed, for the receipt of those arrears from the Rajah, in three years.</P>
<P>We are unable to decide how far this proposal may be consistent with the present state of the Rajah's resources; but we direct you to use all proper means to bring these arrears to account as
<PB N="37" REF="145"/>
soon as possible, consistently with a due attention to this consideration.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CLAUSES H.</HEAD>
<P>You will observe, that by the 38th section of the late act of parliament, it is enacted, That for settling upon a permanent foundation the present indeterminate rights of the Nabob of Arcot and the Rajah of Tanjore, with respect to each other, we should take into our immediate consideration the said indeterminate rights and pretensions, and take and pursue such measures as in our judgment and discretion shall be best calculated to ascertain and settle the same according to the principles, and the terms and stipulations contained in the treaty of 1762, between the said Nabob and the said Rajah.</P>
<P>On a retrospect of the proceedings transmitted to us from your presidency, on the subject of the disputes which have heretofore arisen between the Nabob and the Rajah, we find the following points remain unadjusted, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Whether the Jaghire of Arnee shall be enjoyed by the Nabob, or delivered up either to the Rajah, or the descendants, Tremaul Row, the late Jaghiredar.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Whether the fort and district of Hana∣mantagoody, which is admitted by both parties to be within the Marawar, ought to be possessed by the Nabob, or to be delivered up by him to the Rajah.</P>
<P N="3">3d. To whom the government share of the crop of the Tanjore country, of the year. 1775-6, properly belongs.</P>
<P>Lastly. Whether the Rajah has a right, by usage and custom, or ought, from the necessity of
<PB N="38" REF="146"/>
the case, to be permitted to repair such part of the Annacut, or dam and banks of the Cavery, as lie within the district of Trichinopoly, and to take earth and sand in the Trichinopoly territory, for the repairs of the dam and banks within either or both of those districts.</P>
<P>In order to obtain a complete knowledge of the facts and circumstances relative to the several points in dispute, and how far they are connected with the treaty of 1762, we have with great circum∣spection examined into all the materials before us on these subjects, and will proceed to state to you the result of our enquiries and deliberations.</P>
<P>The objects of the treaty of 1762 appear to be restricted to the arrears of tribute to be paid to the Nabob for his past claims, and to the quantum of the Rajah's future tribute or peshcush; the cancelling of a certain bond given by the Rajah's father to the father of the Nabob; the confir∣mation to the Rajah of the districts of Coveladdy and Elangaud, and the restoration of Tremaul Row to his jaghire of Arnee, in condescension to the Rajah's request, upon certain stipulations, viz. That the fort of Arnee and Doby Gudy should be retained by the Nabob; that Tremaul Row should not erect any fortress, walled pagodas, or other strong hold, nor any wall round his dwelling-house, exceeding eight feet high, or two feet thick; and should in all things behave himself with due obedience to the government; and that he should pay yearly, in the month of July, unto the Nabob or his successors, the sum of ten thousand rupees, the Rajah thereby becoming the security for Tre∣maul Row, that he should in all things demean and behave himself accordingly, and pay yearly the stipulated sum.</P>
<P>Upon a review of this treaty, the only point
<PB N="39" REF="147"/>
now in dispute, which appears to us to be so im∣mediately connected with it as to bring it within the strict line of our duty to ascertain and settle, according to the terms and stipulations of the treaty, is that respecting Arnee. For although the other points enumerated may in some respects have a relation to that treaty, yet as they are foreign to the purposes expressed in it, and could not be in the contemplation of the contracting parties at the time of making it, those disputes cannot in our comprehension fall within the line of descrip∣tion of rights and pretensions to be now ascertained and settled by us, according to any of the terms and stipulations of it.</P>
<P>In respect to the jaghire of Arnee, we do not find that our records afford us any satisfactory infor∣mation by what title the Rajah claims it, or what degree of relationship or connection has subsisted between the Rajah and the Kelledar of Arnee, save only that by the treaty of 1762 the former be∣came the surety for Tremaul Row's performance of his engagements specified therein, as the con∣ditions for his restoration to that jaghire; on the death of Tremaul Row we perceive that he was succeeded by his widow, and after her death, by his grandson Seneevasorow, both of whom were admitted to the jaghire by the Nabob.</P>
<P>From your minutes of consulation of the 31st October 1770, and the Nabob's letter to the pre∣sident, of the 21st March, 1771, and the two letters from Rajah Beerbur, Atchener Punt (who, we presume, was then the Nabob's manager at Arcot) of the 16th and 18th March, referred to in the Nabob's letter, and transmitted therewith, to the president, we observe that, previous to the treaty of 1762, Mr. Pigot concurred in the expe∣diency of the Nabob's taking possession of this jaghire, on account of the troublesome and refrac∣tory
<PB N="40" REF="148"/>
behaviour of the Arnee Braminees, by their affording protection to all disturbers; who, by reason of the little distance between Arnee and Arcot, fled to the former, and were there protected, and not given up, though demanded.</P>
<P>That though the jaghire was restored in 1762, it was done under such conditions and restrictions as were thought best calculated to preserve the peace and good order of the place, and due obe∣dience to government.</P>
<P>That nevertheless the Braminees (quarrelling among themselves) did afterwards, in express vio∣lation of the treaty, enlist and assemble many thousand sepoys, and other troops; that they erected gaddies and other small forts, provided themselves with wall pieces, small guns, and other warlike stores, and raised troubles and disturban∣ces in the neighbourhood of the city of Arcot, and the forts of Arnee, and Shaw Gaddy; and that finally they imprisoned the hircarrahs of the Nabob, sent with his letters and instructions, in pursuance of the advice of your board, to require certain of the Braminees to repair to the Nabob of Chepauk, and though peremptorily required to re∣pair thither, paid no regard to those, or to any other orders from the Circar.</P>
<P>By the 13th article contained in the instructions given by the Nabob to Mr. Dupré, as the basis for negotiating the treaty made with the Rajah in 1771, the Nabob required that the Arnee district should be delivered up to the Circar, because the Brami∣nees had broken the conditions which they were to have observed. In the answers given by the Rajah to these propositions, he says,
<Q>I am to give up to the Circar the jaghire district of Arnee;</Q> and on the 7th of November 1771, the Rajah, by letter to Seneewasorow, who appears by your con∣sultations and country correspondence to have been
<PB N="41" REF="149"/>
the grandson of Tremaul Row, and to have been put in possession of the jaghire at your recommen∣dation (on the death of his grandmother) writes, acquainting him, that he had given the Arnee country then in his (Seneewasarow's) possession, to the Nabob, to whose aumildars Seneewasarow was to deliver up the possession of the country. And in your letter to us of the 28th February 1772, you certified the district of Arnee to be one of the countries acquired by this treaty, and to be of the estimated value of two lacks of rupees per annum.</P>
<P>In our orders, dated the 12th April 1775, we declared our determination to replace the Rajah upon the throne of his ancestors, upon certain terms and conditions, to be agreed upon for the mutual benefit of himself and the Company, with∣out infringing the rights of the Nabob. We de∣clared, that our faith stood pledged by the treaty of 1762 to obtain payment of the Rajah's tribute to the Nabob; and that for the ensuring such pay∣ment, the fort of Tanjore should be garrisoned by our troops. We directed that you should pay no regard to the article of the treaty of 1771, which respected the alienation of part of the Rajah's do∣minions; and we declared, that if the Nabob had not a just title to those territories before the con∣clusion of the treaty, we denied that he obtained any right thereby, except such temporary sove∣reignty, for securing the payment of his expences, as is therein mentioned.</P>
<P>These instructions appear to have been executed in the month of April 1776; and by your letter of the 14th May following you certified to us, that the Rajah had been put into the possession of the whole country his father held in 1762, when the treaty was concluded with the Nabob; but we do not find that you came to any resolution either an∣tecedent
<PB N="42" REF="150"/>
or subsequent to this advice, either for questioning or impeaching the right of the Nabob to the sovereignty of Arnee, or expressive of any doubt of his title to it. Nevertheless we find, that although the Board passed no such resolution, yet your president, in his letter to the Nabob, of the 30th July, and 24th August, called upon his highness to give up the possession of Arnee to the Rajah; and the Rajah himself, in several letters to us, particularly in those of 21st October 1776, and the 7th of June 1777, expressed his expecta∣tion of our orders for delivering up that fort and district to him; and so recently as the 15th of October 1783, he reminds us of his former ap∣plication, and states, that the country of Arnee being guaranteed to him by the Company, it of course is his right; but that it has not been given up to him, and he therefore earnestly entreats our orders for putting him into the possession of it. We also observe, by your letter of the 14th of October 1779, that the Rajah had not then ac∣counted for the Nabob's peshcush since his re∣storation, but had assigned as a reason for his withdrawing it, that the Nabob had retained from him the district of Arnee, with a certain other district (Hanamantagoody) which is made the subject of another part of our present dispatches.</P>
<P>We have thus stated to you the result of our enquiry into the grounds of the dispute relative to Arnee; and as the research has offered no evidence in support of the Rajah's claim, nor even any lights whereby we can discover in what degree of rela∣tionship, by consanginuity, cast, or other circum∣stances, the Rajah now stands, or formerly stood, with the Killidar of Arnee, or the nature of his connection with, or command over that district, or the authority he exercised or assumed previous to the treaty of 1771, we should think ourselves
<PB N="43" REF="151"/>
highly reprehensible in complying with the Rajah's request; and the more so, as it is expressly stated, in the treaty of 1762, that this fort and district were then in the possession of the Nabob, as well as the person of the Jaghiredar, on account of his dis∣obedience, and were restored to him by the Nabob, in condescension to the Rajah's request, upon such terms and stipulations as could not, in our judg∣ment, have been imposed by the one, or submitted to by the other, if the sovereignty of the one, or the dependency of the other, had been at that time a matter of doubt.</P>
<P>Although these materials have not furnished us with evidence in support of the Rajah's claim, they are far from satisfactory, to evince the justice of, or the political necessity for, the Nabob's continuing to withhold the jaghire from the descendants of Tremaul Row; his hereditary right to that jag∣hire seems to us to have been fully recognized by the stipulations of the treaty of 1762, and so little doubted, that on his death, his widow was admit∣ted by the Nabob to hold it, on account, as may be presumed, of the non-age of his grandson and heir, Seneewasarow, who appears to have been confirm∣ed in the jaghire, on her death, by the Nabob, as the lineal heir and successor to his grandfather.</P>
<P>With respect to Seneewasarow, it does not ap∣pear, by any of the proceedings in our possession, that he was concerned in the misconduct of the Braminees complained of by the Nabob in the year 1770, which rendered it necessary for his high∣ness to take the jaghire into his own hands, or that he was privy to, or could have prevented those disturbances.</P>
<P>We therefore direct, that if the heir of Tremaul Row is not at present in possession of the jaghire, and has not, by any violation of the treaty, or act of disobedience, incurred a forfeiture thereof, he be
<PB N="44" REF="152"/>
forthwith restored to the possession of it, according to the terms and stipulations of the treaty of 1762. But if any powerful motive of regard to the peace and tranquillity of the Carnatic shall in your judg∣ment render it expedient to suspend the execution of these orders, in that case you are with all con∣venient speed to transmit to us your proceedings thereupon, with the full state of the facts, and of the reasons which have actuated your conduct.</P>
<P>We have before given it as our opinion that the stipulations of the treaty of 1762 do not apply to the points remaining to be decided. But the late act of parliament having, from the nature of our connection with the two powers in the Carnatic, pointed out the expediency, and even necessity, of settling the several matters in dispute between them, by a speedy and permanent arrangement, we now proceed to give you our instructions upon the se∣veral other heads of disputes before enumerated.</P>
<P>With respect to the fort and district of Hanaman∣tagoody we observe that on the restoration of the Ra∣jah in 1776, you informed us in your letter of the 14th of May—
<Q>That the Rajah had been put into possession of the whole of the country his father held in 1762 when the treaty was concluded with the Nabob;</Q> and on the 25th of June you came to the resolution of putting the Rajah into poses∣sion of Hanamantagoody, on the ground of its ap∣pearing on reference to the Nabob's instructions to Mr. Dupré in June, 1762, to his reply, and to the Rajah's representations of 25th March, 1771, that Hanamantagoody was actually in the hands of the late Rajah at the time of making the treaty of 1762. We have referred as well to those papers as to all the other proceedings on this subject, and must confess they fall very short of demonstrating to us the truth of that fact. And we find, by the Secret Consultations of Fort William of the 7th
<PB N="45" REF="153"/>
of August, 1776, that the same doubt was enter∣tained by our Governor General and Council.</P>
<P>But whether, in point of fact, the late Rajah was or was not in possession of Hanamantagoody in 1762, it is notorious that the Nabob had always claimed the dominion of the countries of which this fort and district are a part.</P>
<P>We observe, that the Nabob is now in the ac∣tual possession of this fort and district; and we are not warranted, by any document we have seen, to concur with the wishes of the Rajah to dispossess him.</P>
<P>With regard to the government share of the crop of 1775▪6, we observe by the Dobeer's memo∣randum, recited in your consultations of the 13th of May, 1776, that it was the established custom of the Tanjore country, to gather in the harvest, and complete the collections, within the month of March; but that, for the causes therein particu∣larly stated, the harvest (and of course the col∣lection of the government share of the crop) was delayed till the month of March was over. We also observe, that the Rajah was not re∣stored to his kingdom until the 11th of April, 1776; and from hence we infer, that if the harvest and collection had been finished at the usual time, the Nabob (being then sovereign of the country) would have received the full benefit of that year's crop.</P>
<P>Although the harvest and collection were de∣layed beyond the usual time, yet we find by the proceedings of your government, and particularly by Mr. Mackay's minute of the 29th of May, 1776, and also by the Dobeer's account, that the greatest part of the grain was cut down whilst the Nabob remained in the government of the country.</P>
<P>It is difficult, from the contradictory allegations
<PB N="46" REF="154"/>
on the subject, to ascertain what was the precise amount of the collections made after the Nabob ceased to have the possession of the country. But whatever it was, it appears from General Stuart's letter of the 2d of April, 1777, that it had been asserted with good authority, that the far greater part of the government share of the crop was plun∣dered by individuals, and never came to account in the Rajah's treasury.</P>
<P>Under all the circumstances of this case, we must be of opinion, that the government share of the crop of 1776 belonged to the Nabob, as the then reigning sovereign of the kingdom of Tanjore, he being, <HI>de facto,</HI> in the full and absolute posses∣sion of the government thereof, and consequently that the assignments made by him of the govern∣ment share of the crop were valid.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, we would by no means be under∣stood by this opinion to suggest, that any further demands ought to be made upon the Rajah, in re∣spect of such parts of the government share of the crop as were collected by his people.</P>
<P>For, on the contrary, after so great a length of time as hath elapsed, we should think it highly un∣just that the Rajah should be now compelled, ei∣ther to pay the supposed balances, whatever they may be, or be called upon to render a specific ac∣count of the collection made by his people.</P>
<P>The Rajah has already, in his letter to Governor Stratton, of the 21st of April, 1777, given his as∣surance, that the produce of the preceding year, accounted for to him, was little more than one lack of pagodas; and as you have acquainted us, by your letter of the 14th of October, 1779, that the Rajah has actually paid into our treasury one lack of pagodas, by way of deposit, on account of the Nabob's claims to the crop, till our sentiments should be known, we direct you to surcease any further demands from the Rajah on that account.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="155"/>We learn by the proceedings, and particularly by the Nabob's letter to Lord Pigot, of the 6th of July, 1776, that the Nabob, previous to the restoration of the Rajah, actually made assign∣ments, or granted tuncaws of the whole of his share of the crop to his creditors and troops; and that your government (entertaining the same opi∣nion as we do upon the question of right to that share) by letter to the Rajah of the 20th August, 1776, recommended to him
<Q>to restore to Mr. Benfield (one of the principal assignees or tuncaw-holders of the Nabob) the grain of the last year, which was in possession of his people, and said to be forcibly taken from them; and further, to give Mr. Benfield all reasonable as∣sistance in recovering such debts as should ap∣pear to have been justly due to him from the inhabitants; and acquainted the Rajah, that it had been judged by a majority of the council, that it was the Company's intention to let the Nabob have the produce of the crop of 1776, but that you had no intention that the Rajah should be accountable for more than the go∣vernment share, whatever that might be; and that you did not mean to do more than recom∣mend to him to see justice done, leaving the manner and time to himself.</Q>
Subsequent re∣presentations appear to have been made to the Rajah by your government on the same subject, in favour of the Nabob's mortgages.</P>
<P>In answer to these applications, the Rajah, in his letter to Mr. Stratton, of the 12th January, 1777, acquainted you,
<Q>that he had given orders respecting the grain which Mr. Benfield had heaped up in his country; and with regard to the money due to him by the farmers, that he had desired Mr. Benfield to bring accounts of it, that he might limit a time for the payment
<PB N="48" REF="156"/>
of it, proportionably to their ability, and that the necessary orders for stopping this money out of the inhabitants share of the crop, had been sent to the ryots and aumildars; that Mr. Ben∣field's gomastah was then present there, and oversaw his affairs; and that in every thing that was just he (the Rajah) willingly obeyed our Governor and Council.</Q></P>
<P>Our opinion being, that the Rajah ought to be answerable for no more than the amount of what he admits was collected by his people for the go∣vernment share of the crop; and the proceedings before us not sufficiently explaining whether, in the sum which the Rajah, by his before-mentioned letter of the 21st April, 1777, admits to have col∣lected, are included those parts of the government share of the crop which were taken by his people from Mr. Benfield, or from any other of the assig∣nees, or tuncaw-holders; and uninformed as we also are, what compensation the Rajah has or has not made to Mr. Benfield, or any other of the parties from whom the grain was taken by the Rajah's people; or whether, by means of the Ra∣jah's refusal so to do, or from any other circum∣stances, any of the persons dispossessed of their grain, may have had recourse to the Nabob for sa∣tisfaction; we are, for these reasons, incompetent to form a proper judgment what disposition ought in justice to be made of the one lack of pagodas deposited by the Rajah. But as our sentiments and intentions are so fully expressed upon the whole subject, we presume you, who are upon the spot, can have no doubt or difficulty in making such an application of the deposit as will be con∣sistent with those principles of justice whereon our sentiments are founded. But should any such difficulty suggest itself, you will suspend any ap∣plication of the deposit, until you have fully ex∣plained
<PB N="49" REF="157"/>
the same to us, and have received our fur∣ther orders.</P>
<P>With respect to the repairs of Annacut and banks of the Cavery, we have upon various occa∣sions fully expressed to you our sentiments, and in particular, in our general letter of the 4th July 1777, we referred you to the investigation and correspondence on that subject of the year 1764, and to the report made by Mr. James Bourchier, on his personal survey of the waters, and to several letters of the year 1765, and 1767; we also, by our said general letter, acquainted you, that it appeared to us perfectly reasonable that the Rajah should be permitted to repair those banks, and the Annacut, in the same manner as had been practised in times past; and we directed you to establish such regu∣lations, by reference to former usage, for keeping the said banks in repair, as would be effectual, and remove all cause of complaint in future.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding such our instructions, the Rajah, in his letter to us of the 15th October 1783, com∣plains of the destruction of the Annacut; and as the cultivation of the Tanjore country appears, by all the surveys and reports of our engineers employed on that service, to depend altogether on a supply of water by the Cavery, which can only be secured by keeping the Annacut and banks in repair, we think it necessary to repeat to you our orders of the 4th July 1777, on the subject of those repairs.</P>
<P>And further, as it appears, by the survey and re∣port of Mr. Pringle, that those repairs are at∣tended with a much heavier expence when done with materials taken from the Tanjore district, than with those of Trichinopoly, and that the last-mentioned materials are far preferable to the other, it is our order, That if any occurrences should make it necessary or expedient, you apply to the
<PB N="50" REF="158"/>
Nabob in our name, to desire that his highness will permit proper spots of ground to be set out, and bounded by proper marks on the Trichino∣poly side, where the Rajah and his people may at all times take sand and earth sufficient for these re∣pairs; and that his highness will grant his lease of such spots of land for a certain term of years to the Company, at a reasonable annual rent, to the intent that through you the cultivation of the Tanjore country may be secured, without infring∣ing or impairing the rights of the Nabob.</P>
<P>If any attempts have been, or shall be hereafter made to divert the water from the Cavery into the Coleroon, by contracting the current of the Upper or Lower Cavery, by planting long grass, as mentioned in Mr. Pringle's report, or by any other means, we have no doubt his highness, on a proper representation to him in our name, will prevent his people from taking any measures detrimental to the Tanjore country, in the prospe∣rity of which his highness, as well as the Com∣pany, is materially interested.</P>
<P>Should you succeed in reconciling the Nabob to this measure, we think it but just, that the pro∣posed lease shall remain no longer in force than whilst the Rajah shall be punctual in the payment of the annual peshcush to the Nabob, as well as the rent to be reserved for the spots of ground. And in order effectually to remove all future oc∣casions of jealousy and complaint between the par∣ties, that the Rajah on the one hand may be sa∣tisfied that all necessary works for the cultivation of his country will be made and kept in repair; and that the Nabob on the other hand may be sa∣tisfied that no encroachment on his rights can be made, nor any works detrimental to the fertility of his country erected; we think it proper that it should be recommended to the parties, as a part
<PB N="51" REF="159"/>
of the adjustment of this very important point, that skilful engineers, appointed by the Company, be employed at the Rajah's expence to conduct all the necessary works, with the strictest attention to the respective rights and interests of both parties. This will remove every probability of injury or dispute; but should either party unexpectedly con∣ceive themselves to be injured, immediate redress might be obtained by application to the govern∣ment of Madras, under whose appointment the engineer will act, without any discussion between the parties, which might disturb that harmony which it is so much the wish of the Company to establish and preserve, as essential to the prosperity and peace of the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Having now, in obedience to the directions of the act of parliament, upon the fullest considera∣tion of the indeterminate rights and pretensions of the Nabob and Rajah, pointed out such measures and arrangements as in our judgment and discre∣tion will be best calculated to ascertain and settle the same, we hope, that upon a candid considera∣tion of the whole system, although each of the parties may feel disappointed in our decision on particular points, they will be convinced that we have been guided in our investigation by principles of strict justice and impartiality, and that the most anxious attention has been paid to the substantial interests of both parties, and such a general and comprehensive plan of arrangements proposed, as will most effectually prevent all future dissatisfac∣tion.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>EXTRACT of a Letter from the Court of Direc∣tors, to the President and Council of Fort St. George, as amended and approved by the Board of Control:</HEAD>
<P>WE have taken into our consideration the se∣veral advices and papers received from In∣dia, relative to the assignment of the revenues of the Carnatic, from the conclusion of the Bengal treaty to the date of your letter in October, 1783, together with the representations of the Nabob of the Carnatic upon that subject; and although we might contend, that the agreement should subsist till we are fully reimbursed his highness's propor∣tion of the expences of the war, yet from a prin∣ciple of moderation and personal attachment to our old ally, his highness the Nabob of the Carna∣tic, for whose dignity and happiness we are ever solicitous, and to cement more strongly, if possible, that mutual harmony and confidence which our connection makes so essentially necessary for our reciprocal safety and welfare, <HI>and for re∣moving from his mind every idea of secret design on our part to lessen his authority over the internal go∣vernment of the Carnatic,</HI> and the collection and ad∣ministration of its revenues, we have resolved that the assignment shall be surrendered; and we do ac∣cordingly direct our president, in whose name the
<PB N="53" REF="161"/>
assignment was taken, <HI>without delay,</HI> to surrender the same to his highness. But while we have adopted this resolution, we repose entire confidence in his highness, that, actuated by the same motives of liberality, and feelings of old friendship and al∣liance, he will chearfully and instantly accede to such arrangements as are necessary to be adopted for our common safety, and for preserving the re∣spect, rights, and interests we enjoy in the Carna∣tic. The following are the heads and principles of such an arrangement as we are decisively of opinion must be adopted for these purposes, viz.</P>
<P>That for making a provision for discharging the Nabob's just debts to the Company and indivi∣duals (for the payment of which his highness hath so frequently expressed the greatest solicitude) the <HI>Nabob shall give soucar security for the punctual pay∣ment, by instalments,</HI> into the Company's treasury, of twelve lacks of pagodas per annum (as voluntarily proposed by his highness) until those debts, with interest, shall be discharged; and shall also consent that the equitable provision lately made by the British legislature for the liquidation of those debts, <HI>and such resolutions and determinations</HI> as we shall <HI>hereafter make,</HI> under the authority of that provi∣sion for the liquidation and adjustment of the said debts, <HI>bonâ fide</HI> incurred, shall be carried into full force and effect.</P>
<P>Should any difficulty arise between his highness and our government of Fort St. George, in respect to the <HI>responsibility of the soucar security,</HI> or the times and terms of the instalments, it is our pleasure that you pay obedience to the orders and resolutions of our Governor General and Council of Bengal in respect thereto, not doubting but the Nabob will in such case consent to abide by the determination of our said supreme government.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="162"/>Although, from the great confidence we repose in the honour and integrity of the Nabob, and from an earnest desire not to subject him to any embarrassment on this occasion, we have not pro∣posed any specific assignment of territory or reve∣nue for securing the payments aforesaid, we ne∣vertheless think it our duty, as well to the private creditors, whose interests in this respect have been so solemnly intrusted to us by the late act of parlia∣ment, as from regard to the debt due to the Com∣pany, to insist on a declaration that in the event of the failure of the security proposed, or in default of payment at the stipulated periods, we reserve to ourselves full right to demand of the Nabob such <HI>additional security,</HI> by assignment on his country, as shall be effectual for answering the purposes of the agreement.</P>
<P>After having conciliated the mind of the Na∣bob to this measure, and adjusted the particulars, you are to carry the same into execution by a for∣mal deed between his highness and the Company, according to the tenor of these instructions.</P>
<P>As the administration of the British interests and connections in India has in some respects assumed a new shape by the late act of Parliament, and a general peace in India has been happily accom∣plished, the present appears to us to be the proper period, and which cannot without great impru∣dence be omitted, to settle and arrange, by a just and equitable treaty, a plan for the future defence and protection of the Carnatic, both in time of peace and war, on a solid and lasting foundation.</P>
<P>For the accomplishment of this great and ne∣cessary object, we direct you, in the name of the Company, to use your utmost endeavours to im∣press the expediency of, and the good effects to be derived from this measure, so strongly upon the
<PB N="55" REF="163"/>
minds of the Nabob and the Rajah of Tanjore, as to prevail upon them, jointly or separately, to enter into one or more treaty or treaties with the Com∣pany, grounded on this principle of equity, That áll the contracting parties shall be bound to contribute jointly to the support of the military force and garrisons, as well in peace as in war.</P>
<P>That the military peace establishment shall be forthwith settled and adjusted by the Company, in pursuance of the authority and directions given to them by the late act of parliament.</P>
<P>As the payments of the troops and garrisons, oc∣casional expences in the repairs and improvements of fortifications, and other services incidental to a military establishment, must of necessity be punc∣tual and accurate, no latitude of personal assurance or reciprocal confidence of either of the parties on the other, be accepted or required; but the Nabob and Rajah must of necessity specify particular dis∣tricts and revenues for securing the due and regu∣lar payment of their contributions into the treasury of the Company, with whom the charge of the de∣fence of the coast, and of course the power of the sword, must be exclusively intrusted, with power for the Company, in case of failure or default of such payments, at the stipulated times and seasons, to enter upon and possess such districts, and to let the same to renters, to be confirmed by the Nabob and the Rajah respectively; but trusting that in the execution of this part of the arrangement no undue obstruction will be given by either of those powers, we direct that this part of the treaty be coupled with a most positive assurance, on our part, of our determination to support the dignity and authority of the Nabob and Rajah, in the ex∣clusive administration of the civil government and revenues of their respective countries; and further,
<PB N="56" REF="164"/>
that in case of <HI>any</HI> hostility committed against the territories of either of the contracting parties, on the coast of Coromandel, the whole revenues of their respective territories shall be considered as one common stock, to be appropriated in the com∣mon cause of their defence—That the Company on their part shall engage to refrain, <HI>during the war,</HI> from the application of any part of their revenues to any commercial purposes whatsoever, but apply the whole, save only the ordinary charges of their civil government, to the purposes of the war—That the Nabob and the Rajah shall in like manner en∣gage on their parts to refrain, during the war, from the application of any part of their revenues, save only what shall be actually necessary for the sup∣port of themselves, and the civil government of their respective countries, to any other purposes than that of defraying the expences of such mili∣tary operations as the Company may find it neces∣sary to carry on for the common safety of their in∣terests on the coast of Coromandel.</P>
<P>And to obviate any difficulties or misunder∣standing which might arise from leaving indeter∣minate the sum necessary to be appropriated for the civil establishment of each of the respective powers, that the sum be now ascertained which is indispensably necessary to be applied to those pur∣poses, and which is to be held sacred under every emergency, and set apart, previous to the applica∣tion of the rest of the revenues, as hereby stipulat∣ed, for the purposes of mutual or common defence against any enemy, for <HI>clearing</HI> the incumbrance which may have become necessarily incurred in addition to the expenditure of those revenues <HI>which must be always deemed part of the war establish∣ment.</HI> This vve think absolutely necessary, as no∣thing can tend so much to the preservation of peace, and to prevent the renewal of hostilities, as the
<PB N="57" REF="165"/>
early putting the finances of the several powers upon a clear footing; and the shewing to all other powers, that the Company, the Nabob, and the Rajah, are firmly united in one common cause, and combined in one system of permanent and vi∣gorous defence, for the preservation of their re∣spective territories, and the general tranquillity.</P>
<P>That the whole aggregate revenue of the con∣tracting, shall, during the war, be under the ap∣plication of the Company, and shall continue as long after the war <HI>as shall be necessary, to discharge the burthens contracted by it</HI>; but it must be de∣clared that this provision shall in no respect extend to deprive either the Nabob or the Rajah of the substantial authority necessary to the collection of the revenues of their respective countries. But it is meant, that they should faithfully perform the conditions of this arrangement; and if a division of any part of the revenues, to any other than the sti∣pulated purposes, shall take place, the Company shall be entitled to take upon themselves the col∣lection of the revenue.</P>
<P>The Company are to engage, during the time they shall administer the revenues, to produce to the other contracting parties regular accounts of the application thereof, to the purposes stipulated by the treaty, and faithfully apply them in support of the war.</P>
<P>And lastly, as the defence of the Carnatic is thus to rest with the Company, the Nabob shall be satisfied of the propriety of avoiding all unneces∣sary expence, and will therefore agree not to main∣tain a greater number of troops than shall be ne∣cessary for the support of his dignity, and the splen∣dour of the Durbar, which number shall be speci∣fied in the treaty; and if any military aid is requi∣site for the security and collection of his revenues, other than the fixed establishment employed to en∣force
<PB N="58" REF="166"/>
the ordinary collections, and preserve the po∣lice of the country, the Company must be bound to furnish him with such aid: the Rajah of Tan∣jore must likewise become bound by similar en∣gagements, and be entitled to similar aid.</P>
<P>As, in virtue of the powers vested in Lord Ma∣cartney by the agreement of December 1781, sun∣dry leases, of various periods, have been granted to renters, we direct that you apply to the Nabob, in our name, for his consent, that they may <HI>per∣mitted</HI> to hold their leases to the end of the stipu∣lated term <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the ground of this "great reliance," see the papers in this Appendix, beginning p. 15; as also the Nabob's letters to the Court of Directors, in this Appendix.</NOTE>; and we have great reliance on the li∣berality and spirit of accommodation manifested by the Nabob on so many occasions, that he will be disposed to acquiesce in a proposition so <HI>just and reasonable</HI>; but if, contrary to our expectations, his Highness should be impressed with any particular aversion to comply with this proposition, we do not desire you to insist upon it as an essential part of the arrangement to take place between us; but in that event you must take especial care to give such indemnification to the renters for any loss they may sustain, as you judge to be reason∣able.</P>
<P>It equally concerns the honour of our govern∣ment, that such natives as may have been put in any degree of authority over the collections, in consequence of the deed of assignment, and who have proved faithful to their trust, shall not suffer inconvenience on account of their fidelity.</P>
<P>Having thus given our sentiments at large, as well for the surrender of the assignment, as with regard to those arrangements which we think ne∣cessary to adopt in consequence thereof, we cannot dismiss this subject without expressing our highest
<PB N="59" REF="167"/>
approbation of the <HI>ability, moderation, and command of temper,</HI> with which our President at Madras has conducted himself in the management of a very delicate and embarrassing situation. His conduct, and that of the Select Committee of Fort St. George, in the execution of the trust delegated to Lord Macartney, by the Nabob Mahomed Ally, has been vigorous and effectual, for the purpose of realizing as great a revenue, at a crisis of necessity, as the nature of the case admitted; and the impu∣tation of corruption, suggested in some of the pro∣ceedings, appears to be totally groundless and un∣warranted.</P>
<P>While we find so much to applaud, it is with regret we are induced to advert to any thing which may appear worthy of blame, as the step of issuing the Torana Chits in Lord Macartney's own name can only be justified upon the ground of absolute necessity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the full proof of this necessity, Lord Macartney's whole cor∣respondence on the subject may be referred to. Without the act here condemned, not one of the acts commended in the preceding paragraph could be performed. By referring to the Nabob's letters in this Ap∣pendix it will be seen what sort of task a Governor has on his hands, who is to use, according to the direction of this letter,
<Q>acts of ad∣dress, civility, and conciliation, and to pay, upon <HI>all</HI> occasions, the <HI>highest attention</HI></Q> to persons, who at the very time are falsely, and in the grossest terms, accusing him of peculation, corruption, treason, and every species of malversation in office. The recommendation, under menaces of such behaviour, and under such circumstances, conveys a lesson the tendency of which cannot be misunderstood.</NOTE>; and as his Lordship had every reason to believe that the demand, when made, would be irksome and disagreeable to the feelings of Maho∣med Ally, every precaution ought to have been used, and more time allowed, for proving that ne∣cessity, by previous acts of address, civility, and conciliation, applied for the purposes of obtaining his authority to such a measure. It appears to us, that more of this might have been used; and there∣fore we cannot consider the omission of it as blame∣less,
<PB N="60" REF="168"/>
consistent with our wishes of sanctifying no act contrary to the spirit of the agreement, or derogatory to the authority of the Nabob of the Carnatic, in the exercise of any of his just rights, in the government of the people under his authority.</P>
<P>We likewise observe, the Nabob has complained that no official communication was made to him of the peace, for near a month after the cessation of arms took place. This, and every other mark of disrespect to the Nabob, will ever appear highly reprehensible in our eyes; and we direct that you do, upon all occasions, pay the highest attention to him and his family.</P>
<P>Lord Macartney, in his minute of the 9th of September last, has been fully under our conside∣ration: we shall ever applaud the prudence and foresight of our servants, which induces them to collect, and communicate to us, every opinion, or even ground of suspicion, they may entertain, re∣lative to any of the powers in India, with whose conduct our interest, and the safety of our settle∣ments, is essentially connected. At the same time we earnestly recommend, that those opinions and speculations be communicated to us with prudence, discretion, and all possible secrecy; <HI>and the terms in which they are conveyed be expressed in a manner as little offensive as possible to the powers whom they may concern, and into whose hands they may fall.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The delicacy here recommended in the <HI>expressions</HI> concerning con∣duct,
<Q>with which the safety of our settlements is essentially con∣nected, is a lesson of the same nature with the former.</Q>
Dangerous designs, if truly such, ought to be expressed according to their nature and qualities; and as for the <HI>secrecy</HI> recommended concerning the designs here alluded to, nothing can be more absurd, as they appear very fully and directly in the papers published by the authority of the Court of Directors in 1775, and may be easily discerned from the pro∣positions for the Bengal treaty, published in the Reports of the Com∣mittee of Secrecy, and in the Reports of the Select Committee. The keeping of such secrets too long has been one cause of the Carnatic war, and of the ruin of our affairs in India.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="169"/>We next proceed to give you our sentiments re∣specting the private debts of the Nabob; <HI>and we cannot but acknowledge,</HI> that the origin and justice, both of the loan of 1767, and the loan of 1777, commonly called the cavalry loan, appear to us clear and indisputable, agreeable to the true sense and spirit of the late act of parliament.</P>
<P>In speaking of the loan of 1767, we are to be understood as speaking of the debt as constituted by the original bonds of that year, bearing interest at £.10 per cent.; and therefore, if any of the Na∣bob's creditors, under a pretence that their debts made part of the consolidated debt of 1767, al∣though secured by bonds of a subsequent date, carrying an interest exceeding £. 10 per cent. shall claim the benefit of the following orders, we direct that you pay no regard to such claims, without our further especial instructions for that purpose.</P>
<P>With respect to the consolidated debt of 1777, it certainly stands upon a less favourable footing. So early as the 27th of March, 1769, it was or∣dered by our then President and Council of Fort St. George, that for the preventing all persons living under the Company's protection from hav∣ing any dealings with any of the country powers, or their ministers, without the knowledge or con∣sent of the Board, an advertisement should be pub∣lished, by fixing it up at the sea-gate, and sending round a copy to the Company's servants and inha∣bitants, and to the different subordinates, and our garrisons, and giving it out in general orders; stat∣ing therein, that the President and Council did consider the irreversible order of the Court of Di∣rectors of the year 1714 (whereby their people were prohibited from having any dealings with the country governments in money matters) to be in full force and vigour; and thereby expressly for∣bidding
<PB N="62" REF="170"/>
all servants of the Company, and other Europeans under their jurisdiction, to make loans, or have any money transactions with any of the princes or states in India, without special licence and permission of the President and Council for the time being, except only in the particular cases there mentioned; and declaring, that any wilful deviation therefrom should be deemed a breach of orders, and treated as such. And on the 4th of March, 1778, it was resolved by our President and Council of Fort St. George, that the consoli∣dated debt of 1777 was not, on any respect what∣ever, conducted under the auspices or protection of that government; and on the circumstance of the consolidation of the said debt being made known to us, we did, on the 23d of December, 1778, write to you in the following terms:
<Q>Your ac∣count of the Nabob's private debts is very alarming; but from whatever cause or causes those debts have been contracted or increased, we hereby repeat our orders, that the sanction of the Company be on no account given to any kind of security for the payment or liquidation of any part thereof (except by the express au∣thority of the Court of Directors) on any ac∣count or pretence whatever.</Q></P>
<P>The loan of 1777 therefore has no sanction or authority from us; and in considering the situation and circumstances of this loan, we cannot omit to observe, that the creditors could not be ignorant how greatly the affairs of the Nabob were at that time deranged, and that his debt to the Company was then very considerable; the payment of which the parties took the most effectual means to post∣pone, by procuring an assignment of such specific revenues, for the discharge of their own debts, as alone could have enabled the Nabob to have dis∣charged that of the Company.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="171"/>Under all these circumstances, we should be warranted to refuse our aid or protection in the recovery of this loan; but when we consider the inexpediency of keeping the subject of the Nabob's debts longer afloat than is absolutely necessary; when we consider how much the final conclusion of this business will tend to promote tranquillity, credit, and circulation of property in the Carnatic; and when we consider that the debtor concurs with the creditor in establishing the justice of those debts consolidated in 1777 into gross sums, for which bonds were given, liable to be transferred to persons different from the original creditors, and having no share or knowledge of the trans∣actions in which the debts originated, and of course how little ground there is to expect any sub∣stantial good to result from an unlimited investi∣gation into them, we have resolved so far to recog∣nize the justice of those debts, as to extend to them that protection which, upon <HI>more</HI> forcible grounds, we have seen cause to allow to the other two classes of debts. But, although we so far adopt the general presumption in their favour, as to admit them to a participation in the manner hereafter directed, we do not mean to debar you from receiving any complaints against those debts of 1777, at the instance either of the Nabob him∣self, or of other creditors injured by their being so admitted, or by any other persons having a proper interest, or stating reasonable grounds of objection; and if any complaints are offered, we order that the grounds of all such be attentively examined by you, and be transmitted to us, together with the evidence adduced in support of them, for our final decision; and as we have before directed, that the sum of twelve lacks of pagodas, to be received an∣nually from the Nabob, should be paid into our
<PB N="64" REF="172"/>
treasury, it is our order that the same be distri∣buted according to the following arrangement.</P>
<P>That the debt be made up in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The debt consolidated in 1767 to be made up to the end of the year 1784, with the current inte∣rest at ten <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The cavalry loan to be made up to the same period, with the current interest at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The debt consolidated in 1777 to be made up to the same period, with the current interest at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> to November 1781, and from thence with the current interest at 6 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The 12 lacks annually to be received, are then to be applied,</P>
<P N="1">1. To the growing interest on the cavalry loan, at 12 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To the growing interest on the debt of 1777, at 6 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The remainder to be equally divided; one half to be applied to the extinction of the Company's debt, the other half to be applied to the payment of growing interest, at £.10 <HI>per cent.</HI> and towards the discharge of the principal of the debt of 1767.</P>
<P>This arrangement to continue till the principal of the debt 1767 is discharged.</P>
<P>The application of the 12 lacks is then to be,</P>
<P N="1">1. To the interest of the debt 1777, as above. The remainder to be then equally divided; one half towards the discharge of the current interest and principal of the cavalry loan, and the other half towards the discharge of the Company's debt.</P>
<P>When the cavalry loan shall be thus discharged, there shall then be paid, towards the discharge of the Company's debt, seven lacks.</P>
<P>To the growing interest and capital of the 1777 loan, 5 lacks.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="173"/>When the Company's debt shall be discharged, the whole is then to be applied in discharge of the debt 1777.</P>
<P>If the Nabob shall be prevailed upon to apply the arrears and growing payments of the Tanjore peishcush in further discharge of his debts, over and above the 12 lacks of pagodas, we direct that the whole of that payment, when made, shall be applied towards the reduction of the Company's debt.</P>
<P>We have laid down these general rules of dis∣tribution, as appearing to us founded on justice, and the relative circumstances of the different debts; and therefore we give our authority and protection to them only, on the supposition that they who ask our protection acquiesce in the con∣dition upon which it is given; and therefore we expressly order, that if any creditor of the Nabob, a servant of the Company, or being under our protection, shall refuse to express his acquiescence in these arrangements, he shall not only be excluded from receiving any share of the fund under your distribution, but shall be prohibited from taking any separate measures to recover his debt from the Nabob, it being one great inducement to our adopting this arrangement, that the Nabob shall be relieved from all further disquietude by the importunities of his individual creditors, and he left at liberty to pursue those measures for the pro∣sperity of his country, which the embarrassments of his situation have hitherto deprived him of the means of exerting. And we further direct, that if any creditor shall be found refractory, or disposed to disturb the arrangement we have suggested, he shall be dismissed the service, and sent home to England.</P>
<P>The directions we have given only apply to
<PB N="66" REF="174"/>
the three classes of debts which have come under our observation. It has been surmised, that the Nabob has of late contracted further debts; if any of these are due to British subjects, we forbid any countenance or protection whatever to be given to them, until the debt is fully investigated, the nature of it reported home, and our special in∣structions upon it received.</P>
<P>We cannot conclude this subject, without ad∣verting in the strongest terms to the prohibitions which have from time to time issued under the au∣thority of different Courts of Directors against any of our servants, or of those under our protection, having any money transactions with any of the country powers, without the knowledge and pre∣vious consent of our respective governments abroad; we are happy to find that the Nabob, sensible of the great embarrassments both to his own and the Company's affairs, which the enormous amount of their private claims have occasioned, is willing to engage not to incur any new debts with individu∣als, and we think little difficulty will be found in persuading his highness into a positive stipulation for that purpose; and though the legislature has thus humanely interfered in behalf of such indi∣viduals as might otherwise have been reduced to great distress by the past transactions, we hereby, in the most pointed and positive terms, repeat our prohibition upon this subject; and direct, that no person, being a servant of the Company, or being under our protection, shall, on any pretence what∣ever, be concerned in any loan or other money transaction with any of the country powers, unless with the knowledge and express permission of our respective governments. And if any of our ser∣vants, or others being under our protection, shall be discovered in any respect counteracting these orders, we strictly enjoin you to take the first op∣portunity
<PB N="67" REF="175"/>
of sending them home to England, to be punished as guilty of disobedience of orders, and no protection or assistance of the Company shall be given for the recovery of any loans connected with such transactions. Your particular attention to this subject is strictly enjoined; and any con∣nivance on your parts, to a breach of your orders upon it, will incur our highest displeasure.</P>
<P>In order to put an end to those intrigues, which have been so successfully carried on at the Nabob's durbar, we repeat our prohibition in the strongest terms respecting any intercourse between British subjects and the Nabob and his family, as we are convinced that such an intercourse has been carried on greatly to the detriment and expence of the Nabob, and merely to the advantage of individuals. We therefore direct, that all persons who shall of∣fend against the letter or spirit of this necessary order, whether in the Company's service, or under their protection, be forthwith sent to England.</P>

<P>IT is with extreme concern that we express a dif∣ference of opinion with your right honourable Board, in this early exercise of your controuling power; but in so novel an institution, it can scarce be thought extraordinary, if the exact boun∣daries of our respective functions and duties should not at once, on either side, be precisely and fami∣liarly

<HEAD>6th. Concerning the private Debts of the Nabob of Arcot, and the Application of the Fund of 12 Lacks of Pagodas per Annum.</HEAD>
<P>Under this head you are pleased, in lieu of our paragraphs, to substantiate at once the justice of all those demands which the act requires us to investi∣gate, subject only to a right reserved to the Nabob, or any other party concerned, to question the jus∣tice of any debt falling within the last; of the three classes; we submit, that at least the opportu∣nity of questioning, within the limited time, the justice of any of the debts, ought to have been fully preserved; and supposing the first and se∣cond classes to stand free from imputation (as we incline to believe they do) no injury can result to individuals from such discussion: and we further submit to your consideration, how far the express direction of the act to examine the nature and ori∣gin of the debts has been, by the amended para∣graphs, complied with; and whether at least the rate of interest, according to which the debts aris∣ing from soucar assignment of the land revenues to the servants of the Company, acting in the capacity of native bankers, have been accumulated, ought not to be enquired into, as well as the reasonable∣ness of the deduction of 25 <HI>per cent.</HI> which the
<PB N="69" REF="177"/>
Bengal government directed to be made from a great part of the debts on certain conditions. But to your appropriation of the fund, our duty re∣quires that we should state our strongest dissent. Our right to be paid the arrears of those expences, by which, almost to our own ruin, we have pre∣served the country, and all the property connected with it, from falling a prey to a foreign conqueror, surely stands paramount to all claims for former debts upon the revenues of a country so preserved, even if the legislature had not expressly limited the assistance to be given the private creditors to be such as should be consistent with our own rights. The Nabob had, long before passing the act, by treaty with our Bengal government, agreed to pay us 7 lacks of pagodas, as part of the 12 lacks, in liquidation of those arrears, of which 7 lacks the arrangement you have been pleased to lay down would take away from us more than the half, and give it to private creditors, of whose demands there are only about a sixth part which do not stand in a predicament that you declare would not entitle them to any aid or protection from us in the reco∣very thereof, were it not upon grounds of expe∣diency, as will more particularly appear by the an∣nexed estimate. Until our debt shall be discharged, we can by no means consent to give up any part of the 7 lacks to the private creditors; and we humbly apprehend, that in this declaration we do not exceed the limits of the authority and rights vested in us.</P>

<HEAD>Sixth Article.</HEAD>
<P>WE think it proper, considering the particular nature of the subject, to state to you the follow∣ing remarks on that part of your representation which relates to the plan for the discharge of the Nabob's debts.</P>
<P N="1">1st. You compute the revenue which the Car∣natic may be expected to produce only at twenty
<PB N="71" REF="179"/>
lacks of pagodas. If we concurred with you in this opinion, we should certainly feel our hopes of advantage to all the parties from this arrange∣ment considerably diminished. But we trust, that we are not too sanguine on this head, when we place the greatest reliance on the estimate trans∣mitted to you by your President of Fort St. George, having there the best means of informa∣tion upon the fact, and stating it with a parti∣cular view to the subject matter of these para∣graphs. Some allowance, we are sensible, must be made for the difference of collection in the Nabob's hands, but we trust not such as to re∣duce the receipt nearly to what you suppose.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. In making up the amount of the private debts, you take in compound interest at the dif∣ferent rates specified in our paragraph. This it was not our intention to allow; and lest any mis∣conception should arise on the spot, we have add∣ed an express direction, that the debts be made up with simple interest only, from the time of their respective consolidation.

We have also the strongest grounds to believe, that the debts will be, in other respects, considerably less than they are now computed by you; and consequently, the Company's annual proportion of the twelve lacks will be larger than it appears on your estimate. But even on your own statement of it, if we add to the £.150,000 or 3,75,000 pagodas (which you take as the an∣nual proportion to be received by the Company for five years, to the end of 1789) the annual amount of the Tanjore peshcush for the same period, and the arrears on the peshcush (proposed by Lord Macartney to be received in three years); the whole will make a sum not falling very short of pagodas 35,00,000, the amount of pagodas 7,00,000 <HI>per annum</HI> for the same period.

if we carry our calculations farther, it will ap∣pear that, both by the plan proposed by the Na∣bob, and adopted in your paragraphs, and by that which we transmitted to you, the debt from the Nabob, if taken at £ 3,000,000, will be dis∣charged nearly at the same period, viz. in the course of the eleventh year. We cannot therefore be of opinion that there is the smallest ground for objecting to this arrangement, as injurious to the interests of the Company, even if the measure were to be considered on the mere ground of ex∣pediency, and with a view only to the wisdom of re-establishing credit and circulation in a com∣mercial settlement, without any consideration of those motives of attention to the feelings and ho∣nour of the Nabob, of humanity to individuals, and of justice to persons in your service, and liv∣ing under your protection, which have actuated the legislature, and which afford not only justi∣fiable, but commendable grounds for your conduct.</P>
<P>Impressed with this conviction, we have not made any alteration in the general outlines of the arrangement which we had before transmitted to you. But, as the amount of the Nabob's reve∣nue is matter of uncertain conjecture, and as it does not appear just to us, that any deficiency should fall wholly on any one class of these debts, we have added a direction to your government of Fort St George, that if, notwithstanding the pro∣visions contained in our former paragraphs, any deficiency should arise, the payments of what shall be received shall be made in the same proportion which would have obtained in the division of the whole twelve lacks, had they been paid.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>[THE following Extracts are subjoined, to shew the matter and the style of representation employed by those who have obtained that ascen∣dency over the Nabob of Arcot, which is described in the above Letter, and is so totally destructive of the authority and credit of the lawful British go∣vernment at Madras. The charges made by these persons have been solemnly denied by Lord Macart∣ney; and, to judge from the character of the par∣ties accused and accusing, they are probably void of all foundation. But as the Letters are in the name and under the signature of a person of great rank and consequence among the natives; as they contain matter of the most serious nature; as they charge the most enormous crimes, and corruptions of the grossest kind, on a British Governor; and as they refer to the Nabob's minister in Great Britain for proof and further elucidation of the matters complained of, common decency, and com∣mon policy, demanded an enquiry into their truth or falshood. The writing is obviously the product of some English pen. If, on enquiry, these charges should be made good (a thing very unlikely) the party accused would become a just object of ani∣madversion. If they should be found (as in all probability they would be found) false and calum∣nious, and supported by <HI>forgery,</HI> then the censure would fall on the accuser; at the same time the necessity would be manifest for proper measures towards the security of government against such infamous accusations. It is as necessary to protect the honest fame of virtuous governors, as it is to punish the corrupt and tyrannical. But neither the Court of Directors nor the Board of Controul have made any enquiry into the truth or falshood of
<PB N="74" REF="186"/>
these charges. They have covered over the accusers and accused with abundance of compliments. They have insinuated some oblique censures; and they have recommended perfect harmony between the chargers of corruption and peculation, and the persons charged with these crimes.]</P>

EXTRACT of a Transla∣tion of a Letter from the Nabob of Arcot to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the East India Company.</HEAD>
<P>"FATALLY for me, and for the public inte∣rest, the Company's favour and my unbounded confidence have been lavished on a man totally unfit for the exalted station in which he has been placed, and unworthy of the trusts that have been reposed in him. When I speak of one who has so deeply stabbed my honour, my wounds bleed afresh, and I must be allowed that freedom of ex∣pression which the galling reflexion of my injuries and my misfortunes naturally draw from me. Shall your servants, unchecked, unrestrained, and unpu∣nished, gratify their private views and ambition, at the expence of my honour, my peace, and my happi∣ness, and to the ruin of my country, as well as of all your affairs? No sooner had Lord Macartney obtained the favourite object of his ambition, than he betrayed the greatest insolence towards me, the most glaring neglect of the common civilities and attentions paid me by all former Governors, in the worst of times, and even by the most inveterate of my enemies. He insulted my servants, endeavoured to defame my character by unjustly censuring my administration, and extended his boundless usur∣pation to the whole government of my dominions, in all the branches of judicature and police; and, in violation of the express articles of the agree∣ments,
<PB N="75" REF="187"/>
proceeded to send renters into the coun∣tries, unapproved of by me, men of bad character, and unequal to my management or responsibility. Though he is chargeable with the greatest acts of cruelty, even to the shedding the blood and cut∣ting off the noses and ears of my subjects, by those exercising his authority in the countries, and that even the duties of religion and public worship have been interrupted or prevented; and though he car∣ries on all his business by the arbitrary exertion of military force; yet does he not collect from the countries one fourth of the revenue that should be produced. The statement he pretends to hold forth of expected revenue, is totally fallacious, and can never be realized under the management of his Lordship, in the appointment of renters, totally dis∣qualified, rapacious, and irresponsible, who are ac∣tually embezzling and dissipating the public reve∣nues, that should assist in the support of the war. Totally occupied by his private views, and go∣verned by his passions, he has neglected or sacri∣ficed all the essential objects of public good, and by want of co-operation with Sir Eyre Coote, and refusal to furnish the army with the necessary sup∣plies, has rendered the glorious and repeated vic∣tories of the gallant General ineffectual to the ex∣pulsion of our cruel enemy. To cover his in∣sufficiency, and veil the discredit attendant on his failure in every measure, he throws out the most illiberal expressions, and institutes unjust ac∣cusations against me; and, in aggravation of all the distresses imposed upon me, he has abetted the meanest calumniators, to bring forward false charges against me, and my son Ameer-ul-Omrah, in order to create embarrassment, and for the dis∣tress of my mind. My papers and writings sent to you, must testify to the whole world the malevo∣lence of his designs, and the means that have been used to forward them. He has violently seized and opened all letters addressed to me and my ser∣vants,
<PB N="76" REF="188"/>
on my public and private affairs. My vac∣keel, that attended him, according to ancient cus∣tom, has been ignominiously dismissed from his presence, and not suffered to approach the go∣vernment-house. He has in the meanest manner, and as he thought in secret, been tampering and intriguing with my family and relations, for the worst of purposes. And if I express the agonies of my mind under these most pointed injuries and oppressions, and complain of the violence and in∣justice of Lord Macartney, I am insulted by his affected construction, that my communications are dictated by the insinuations of others. At the same time that his conscious apprehensions for his misconduct, have produced the most abject appli∣cations to me, to smother my feelings, and entrea∣ties to write in his Lordship's favour to England, and to submit all my affairs to his direction. When his submissions have failed to mould me to his will, he has endeavoured to effect his purposes by menaces of his secret influence with those in power in England, which he pretends to assert, shall be effectual to confirm his usurpation, and to deprive me and my family, in succession, of my rights of sovereignty and government for ever. To such a length have his passions and violences car∣ried him, that all my family, my dependants, and even my friends and visitors, are persecuted with the strongest marks of his displeasure. Every shadow of authority in my person is taken from me, and respect to my name discouraged throughout the whole country. When an officer of high rank in his majesty's service was some time since introduced to me by Lord Macartney, his Lordship took oc∣casion to shew a personal derision and contempt of me. Mr. Richard Sulivan, who has attended my Durbar under the commission of the Governor Ge∣neral and Council of Bengal, has experienced his resentment; and Mr. Benfield, <HI>with whom I have no business,</HI> and who, as he has been accustomed to do
<PB N="77" REF="189"/>
for many years, has continued to pay me his visits of respect, has felt the weight of his lordship's dis∣pleasure, and has had every unmerited insinuation thrown out against him, to prejudice him, and deter him from paying me his compliments as usual.</P>
<P>"Thus, Gentlemen, have you delivered me over to a stranger; to a man unacquainted with government and business, and too opinionated to learn; to a man whose ignorance and prejudices operate to the neglect of every good measure, or the liberal co-operation with any that wish well to the public interests; to a man who, to pursue his own passions, plans, and designs, will certainly ruin all mine, as well as the Company's affairs. His mismanagement and obstinacy have caused the loss of many lacks of my revenues, dissipated and embezzled, and every public consideration sa∣crificed to his vanity and private views. I beg to offer an instance in proof of my assertions, and to justify the hope I have, that you will cause to be made good to me all the losses I have sustained, by the mal-administration and bad practices of your servants, according to all the account of receipts of former years, and which I made known to Lord Macartney, amongst other papers of information, in the beginning of his management in the collec∣tions. The district of Ongole produced annually, upon a medium of many years, ninety thousand pagodas; but Lord Macartney, <HI>upon receiving a sum of money from Ramchundry,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tellinga Letter at the end of this correspondence.</NOTE> let it out to him, in April last, for the inadequate rent of 50,000 pagodas per annum, diminishing, in this district alone, near half the accustomed revenues. After this manner hath he exercised his powers over the countries, to suit his own purposes and designs; and this secret mode has he taken to reduce the collection."</P>

<DATE>7th April 1783.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE distresses which I have set forth in my for∣mer letters, are now increased to such an alarming pitch, by the imprudent measures of your Gover∣nor, and by the arbitrary and impolitic conduct pursued with the merchants and importers of grain, that the very existence of the fort of Madras seems at stake, and that of the inhabitants of the settle∣ment appears to have been totally overlooked; many thousands have died, and continue hourly to perish of famine, though the capacity of one of your youngest servants, with diligence and atten∣tion, by doing justice, and giving reasonable en∣couragement to the merchants, and by drawing the supplies of grain which the northern countries would have afforded, might have secured us against all those dreadful calamities. I had with much difficulty procured and purchased a small quantity of rice, for the use of myself, my family, and at∣tendants, and with a view of sending off the great∣est part of the latter to the northern countries, with a little subsistence in their hands. But what must your surprize be, when you learn, that even this rice was seized by Lord Macartney with a mi∣litary force! and thus am I unable to provide for the few people I have about me, who are driven to such extremity and misery, that it gives me pain to behold them. I have desired permission to get a little rice from the northern countries for the subsistence of my people, without its being liable to seizure by your sepoys: this even has been re∣fused me by Lord Macartney. What must your feelings be, on such wanton cruelty exercised to∣wards

me, when you consider that of thousands of villages belonging to me, a single one would have sufficed for my subsistence!</P>

TRANSLATION of a Letter from the Nabob of Arcot to the Chairman and Directors of the East India Company.—Received from Mr. James M'Pherson,
<DATE>1st January, 1784.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>"I AM willing to attribute this continued usur∣pation to the fear of detection in Lord Macartney: he dreads the awful day when the scene of his enormities will be laid open, at my restoration to my country, and when the tongues of my oppres∣sed subjects will be unloosed, and proclaim aloud the cruel tyrannies they have sustained. These sentiments of his Lordship's designs are corrobo∣rated by his sending, on the 10th instant, two Gentlemen to me and my son Ameer-ul-Omrah; and these Gentlemen from Lord Macartney especial∣ly set forth to me, and to my son, that all depend∣ance on the power of the superior government of Bengal, to enforce the intentions of the Company to restore my country, was vain and groundless; that the Company confided in his Lordship's judgment and discretion, and upon his representations, and that if I, and my son Ameer-ul-Omrah, would enter into friendship with Lord Macartney, and sign a paper, declaring all my charges and complaints against him to be false, that his Lordship might be induced to write to England, that all his allega∣tions against me and my son were not well founded; and, notwithstanding his declarations to with-hold my country, yet, on these considerations, it might be still restored to me.</P>
<P>"What must be your feelings for your ancient and faithful friend, on his receiving such insults to
<PB N="80" REF="192"/>
his honour and understanding from your principal servant, armed with your authority? From these manoeuvres, amongst thousands I have experienced, the truth must evidently appear to you, that I have not been loaded with those injuries and op∣pressions from motives of public service, but to answer the private views and interests of his Lord∣ship, and his secret agents: <HI>some papers to this point are inclosed</HI>; others, almost without number, must be submitted to your justice, when time and cir∣cumstances will enable me fully to investigate those transactions. This opportunity will not permit the full representation of my load of injuries and distresses: I beg leave to refer you to my minister, Mr. Macpherson, for the papers, according to the inclosed list, which accompanied my last dispatches by the Rodney, which I fear have failed; and my correspondence with Lord Macartney, subsequent to that period, such as I have been able to prepare for this opportunity, are inclosed.</P>
<P>"Notwithstanding all the violent acts and de∣clarations of Lord Macartney, yet a consciousness of his own misconduct was the sole incentive to the menaces and overtures he has held out, in va∣rious shapes. He has been insultingly lavish in his expressions of high respect for my person; has had the insolence to say, that all his measures flowed from his affectionate regard alone; has presumed to say, that all his enmity and oppres∣sion were levelled at my son, Ameer-ul-Omrah, to whom he before acknowledged every aid and assistance: and, his Lordship being without any just cause or foundation for complaint against us, or a veil to cover his own violences, he has now had recourse to the meanness, and has dared to inti∣mate of my son, in order to intimidate me, and to strengthen his own wicked purposes, to be in league with our enemies the French. You must
<PB N="81" REF="193"/>
doubtless be astonished, no less at the assurance, than at the absurdity of such a wicked sugges∣tion."</P>
<Q>(In the Nabob's own hand.)</Q>
<P>"P. S. In my own hand-writing I acquainted Mr. Hastings, as I now do my ancient friends the Company, with the insult offered to my honour and understanding, in the extraordinary proposi∣tions sent to me by Lord Macartney, through two Gentlemen, on the 10th instant, so artfully veiled with menaces, hopes, and promises. But how can Lord Macartney add to his enormities, after his wicked and calumniating insinuations, so evidently directed against me and my family, through my faithful, my dutiful, and beloved son, Ameer-ul-Omrah, who, you well know, has been ever born and bred amongst the English, whom I have stu∣diously brought up in the warmest sentiments of affection and attachment to them; sentiments, that in his maturity have been his highest ambition to improve, insomuch that he knows no happi∣ness, but in the faithful support of our alliance and connexion with the English nation?"</P>

TRANSLATION of a Letter to the Chairman and Directors of the East India Com∣pany.—Received from Mr. James M'Pherson,
<DATE>14th January, 1784.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>"YOUR astonishment and indignation will be equally raised with mine, when you hear that your President <HI>has dared,</HI> contrary to your intention, to continue to usurp the privileges and hereditary powers of the Nabob of the Carnatic, your old and unshaken friend, and the declared ally of the King of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="194"/>"I will not take up your time by enumera∣ting the particular acts of Lord Macartney's vio∣lence, cruelty, and injustice; <HI>they indeed occur too frequently, and fall upon me, and my devoted subjects and country, too thick, to be regularly related.</HI> I re∣fer you to my Minister, Mr. James M'Pherson, <HI>for a more circumstantial account of the oppressions and enormities, by which he has brought both mine</HI> and the Company's affairs to the brink of destruction. I trust that such flagrant violations of all justice, ho∣nour, and the faith of treaties, will receive the se∣verest marks of your displeasure, and that Lord Macartney's conduct, in making use of your name and authority as a sanction for the continuance of his usurpation, will be disclaimed with the utmost indignation, and followed by the severest punish∣ment. I conceive that his Lordship's arbitrary retention of my country and government can only originate in his <HI>insatiable cravings,</HI> in his implacable malevolence against me, and through fear of de∣tection, which must follow the surrender of the Carnatic into my hands, of those nefarious pro∣ceedings, which are now suppressed by the arm of violence and power.</P>
<P>"I did not fail to represent to the supreme go∣vernment of Bengal, the deplorable situation to which I was reduced, and the unmerited persecu∣tions I have unremittingly sustained from Lord Macartney; and I earnestly implored them to stretch forth a saving arm, and interpose that con∣trouling power which was vested in them, to check <HI>rapacity and presumption,</HI> and preserve the honour and faith of the Company from violation. The Governor General and Council not only felt the cruelty and injustice I had suffered, but were greatly alarmed for the fatal consequences that might result from the distrust of the country powers in the professions of the English, when they saw the
<PB N="83" REF="195"/>
Nabob of the Carnatic, the friend of the Company, and the ally of Great Britain, thus stripped of his rights, his dominions, and his dignity, by the most fraudulent means, and under the mask of friendship. The Bengal government had already heard both the Mharattas and the Nizam urge as an objection to an alliance with the English, the faithless behaviour of Lord Macartney to a prince whose life had been devoted, and whose treasures had been exhausted, in their service and support; and they did not hesitate to give positive orders to Lord Macartney for the restitution of my govern∣ment and authority, on such terms as were not only strictly honourable, but equally advantageous to my friends the Company; for they justly thought that my honour and dignity, and <HI>sovereign rights,</HI> were the first objects of my wishes and am∣bition: But how can I paint my astonishment at Lord Macartney's presumption, in continuing his usurpation, after their positive and reiterated man∣dates! and as if, nettled by their interference, which he disdained, in redoubling the fury of his violence, and sacrificing the public and myself, to his malice and ungovernable passions!</P>
<P>"I am, Gentlemen, at a loss to conceive where his usurpation will stop, and have an end; has he not solemnly declared that the assignment was only made for the support of war? and if neither your instructions, nor the orders of his superiors at Ben∣gal, were to be considered as effectual, has not the treaty of peace virtually determined the period of his tyrannical administration? but so far from sur∣rendering the Carnatic into my hands, he has, since that event, affixed advertisements to the walls and gates of the Black Town, for letting to the best bidder the various districts, for the term of three years; and has continued the Committee of Reve∣nue, which you positively ordered to be abolished, to
<PB N="84" REF="196"/>
whom he has allowed enormous salaries, from 6000 to 4000 pagodas per annum, which each member has received from the time of his appointment, though his Lordship well knows that most of them are by your orders disqualified, by being my principal creditors.</P>
<P>"If those acts of violence and outrage had been productive of public advantage, I conceive his Lordship might have held them forward, in exte∣nuation of his conduct; but whilst he cloaks his justification under the veil of your secret records, it is impossible to refute his assertions, or to expose to you their fallacy; and when he is no longer able to support his conduct by argument, he refers to those records, where, I understand, he has exercised all his sophistry and malicious insinuations, to ren∣der me and my family obnoxious in the eyes of the Company, and the British nation; and when the glorious victories of Sir Eyre Coote have been ren∣dered abortive by a constant deficiency of supplies; and when, since the departure of that excellent Ge∣neral to Bengal, whose loss I must ever regret, a dreadful famine, at the close of last year, occasioned by his Lordship's neglect to lay up a sufficient stock of grain at a proper season, and from his prohibitory orders to private merchants; and when no exertion has been made, nor advantage gained over the enemy; when Hyder's death and Tippoo's return to his own dominions operated in no degree for the benefit of our affairs; in short, when all has been a continued series of disappointment and disgrace under Lord Macartney's management (and in him alone has the management been vested) I want words to convey those ideas of his insuffi∣ciency, ignorance, and obstinacy, which I am con∣vinced you would entertain, had you been specta∣tors of his ruinous and destructive conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="197"/>"But against me and my son, Ameer-ul-Omrah, has his Lordship's vengeance chiefly been exerted; even the Company's own subordinate Zemindars have found better treatment, probably because they were more rich; those of Nizanagoram have been permitted, contrary to your pointed orders, to hold their rich zemindaries at the old dispro∣portionate rate of little more than a sixth part of the real revenue; and my zemindar of Tan∣jore, though he should have regarded himself equally concerned with us in the event of the war, and from whose fertile country many valuable harvests have been gathered in, which have sold at a vast price, has, I understand, only contributed last year, towards the public exigencies, the very in∣considerable sum of one lack of pagodas, and a few thousand pagodas-worth of grain.</P>
<P>"I am much concerned to acquaint you, that ever since the peace a dreadful famine has swept away many thousands of the followers, and sepoys families of the army, from Lord Macartney's ne∣glect to send down grain to the camp, though the roads are crowded with vessels: but his Lordship has been too intent upon his own disgraceful schemes, to attend to the wants of the army. The negociation with Tippoo, which he has set on foot through the mediation of Monsieur Bussy, has em∣ployed all his thoughts, and to the attainment of that object he will sacrifice the dearest interests of the Company to gratify his malevolence against me, and for his own private advantages. The en∣deavour to treat with Tippoo, through the means of the French, must strike you, Gentlemen, as highly improper and impolitic; but it must raise your utmost indignation to hear, that by intercept∣ed letters from Bussy to Tippoo, as well as from their respective vakeels, and from various accounts from Cudalore, we have every reason to conclude
<PB N="86" REF="198"/>
that his Lordship's secretary, Mr. Staunton, when at Cudalore, as his agent to settle the cessation of arms with the French, was informed of all their operations and projects, and <HI>consequently that Lord Macartney has secretly connived at Monsieur Bus∣sy's recommendation to Tippoo to return into the Carnatic, as the means of procuring the most ad∣vantageous terms, and furnishing Lord Macartney with the plea of necessity for concluding a peace after his own manner:</HI> and what further confirms the truth of this fact is, that repeated reports, as well as the alarms of the inhabitants to the west∣ward, leave us no reason to doubt that Tippoo is approaching towards us. His Lordship has issued public orders, that the garrison store of rice, for which we are indebted to the exertions of the Bengal government, should be immediately dis∣posed of, and has strictly forbid all private grain to be sold; by which act he effectually prohibits all private importation of grain, and may eventu∣ally cause as horrid a famine as that which we ex∣perienced at the close of last year, from the same short-sighted policy and destructive prohibitions of Lord Macartney.</P>
<P>But as he has the fabrication of the records in his own hands, he trusts to those partial representa∣tions of his character and conduct, because the sig∣natures of those members of government whom he seldom consults, are affixed, as a public sanction; but you may form a just idea of their correctness and propriety, when you are informed that his Lordship, <HI>upon my noticing the heavy disbursements made for secret service money, ordered the sums to be struck off, and the accounts to be erased from the cash-book of the Company</HI>; and I think I can∣not give you a better proof of his management of my country and revenues, than by calling your at∣tention to his conduct in the Ongole province, and
<PB N="87" REF="199"/>
by referring you to his Lordship's administration of your own jaghire, from whence he has brought to the public account the sum of twelve hundred pagodas for the last year's revenue, yet blazons forth his vast merits and exertions, and expects to receive the thanks of his Committee and Council.—I will beg leave to refer you to my minister, James Macpherson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for a more par∣ticular account of my sufferings and miseries, to whom I have transmitted copies of all papers that passed with his Lordship.</P>
<P>"I cannot conclude without calling your atten∣tion to the <HI>situation of my different creditors,</HI> whose claims are the claims of justice, and whose demands I am bound by honour, and every moral obliga∣tion, to discharge; it is not, therefore, without great concern, I have heard insinuations tending to question the legality of their right to the payment of those just debts; they proceeded from advances made by them openly and honourably for the sup∣port of my own and the public affairs. But I hope the tongue of calumny will never drown the voice of truth and justice; and while that is heard, the wisdom of the English nation cannot fail to accede to an effectual remedy for their distresses, by any arrangement in which their claims may be duly considered, and equitably provided for; and for this purpose my minister, <HI>Mr. Macpherson, will readily subscribe, in my name, to any agreement you may think proper to adopt, founded on the same prin∣ciples</HI> with either of the engagements I entered into with the supreme government of Bengal, for our mutual interest and advantage.—I always pray for your happiness and prosperity."</P>

I am informed that Lord Ma∣cartney, at this late moment, intends to write a letter; I am ignorant of the subject; but fully perceive, that by delaying to send it till the very eve of the dispatch, he means to deprive me of all possibility of communicating my reply, and for∣warding it for the information of my friends in England. Conscious of the weak ground on which he stands, he is obliged to have recourse to these artifices to mislead the judgment, and support for a time his unjustifiable measures by deceit and im∣position.

Such of the inhabitants as had escaped the sword and pillage of Hyder Naik, by taking refuge in the woods, and within the walls of Vellore, &amp;c. on the arrival of Lord Macartney's Amildar to Vellore, and in consequence of his cowle of protec∣tion and support, they most chearfully returned to the villages, set about the cultivation of the lands, and with great pains rebuilt their cottages.—But
<PB N="90" REF="202"/>
now the Amildar has imprisoned the wives and chil∣dren of the inhabitants, seized the few jewels that were on the bodies of the women, and then, before the faces of their husbands, flogged them, in order to make them produce other jewels and effects, which he said they had buried somewhere under ground, and to make the inhabitants bring him money, notwithstanding there was yet no cultiva∣tion in the country.—Terrified with the flagella∣tions, some of them produced their jewels and wearing apparel of their women, to the amount of ten or fifteen pagodas, which they had hidden; others, who declared they had none, the Amildar flogged their women severely, tied cords around their breasts, and tore the sucking children from their teats, and exposed them to the scorching heat of the sun. Those children died, as did the wife of <HI>Ramsoamy,</HI> an inhabitant of Bringpoor. Even this could not stir up compassion in the breast of the Amildar. Some of the children, that were some∣what large, he exposed to sale. In short, the violences of the Amildar are so astonishing, that the people, on seeing the present situation, re∣member the loss of Hyder with regret. With whomsoever the Amildar finds a single measure of <HI>natehinee</HI> or <HI>rice,</HI> he takes it away from him, and appropriates it to the expences of the <HI>Sibindy</HI> that he keeps up. No revenues are collected from the countries, but from the effects of the poor wretch∣ed inhabitants. Those <HI>ryotts</HI> [yeomen] who intended to return to their habitations, and hearing of those violences, have fled for refuge, with their wives and children, into Hyder's country. Every day is ushered in and closed with these violences and disturbances. I have no power to do any thing; and who will hear what I have to say? My business is to inform your highness, who are my master. The people bring their complaints to
<PB N="91" REF="203"/>
me, and I tell them I will write to your high∣ness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">[The above recited practices, or practices similar to them, have prevailed in almost every part of the miserable countries on the coast of Coromandel, for near twenty years past. That they prevailed as strongly and generally as they could prevail, under the administration of the Nabob, there can be no question, notwithstanding the assertion in the begining of the above petition—nor will it ever be otherwise, whilst affairs are conducted upon the principles which influence the present system. Whether the particulars here asserted are true or false, neither the Court of Directors nor their ministry have thought proper to enquire. If they are true, in order to bring them to affect Lord Macartney, it ought to be proved that the complaint was made <HI>to him; and that he had refused redress.</HI> Instead of this fair course, the complaint is carried to the Court of Directors.—The following is one of the documents transmitted by the Nabob, in proof of his charge of corruption against Lord Macartney. If genuine, it is con∣clusive, at least against Lord Macartney's principal agent and manager. If it be a forgery (as in all likelihood it is) it is conclusive against the Nabob and his evil counsellors; and fully demonstrates, if any thing further were necessary to demonstrate, the necessity of the clause in Mr. Fox's bill prohibiting the residence of the native Princes in the Company's principal settlements; which clause was, for obvious reasons, not admitted into Mr. Pitt's. It shews too the absolute ne∣cessity of a severe and exemplary punishment on certain of his English evil counsellors and creditors, by whom such practices are carried on.]</NOTE>."</P>

<HEAD>TRANSLATION of a Tellinga Letter from Veira Permaul, Head Dubash to Lord Macart∣ney, <HI>in his own hand writing,</HI> to Rajah Ramchun∣dah, the Renter of Ongole; dated 25th of the Hindoo month Mausay, in the year Plavanamal, corresponding to
<DATE>5th March 1782.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I PRESENT my respects to you, and am very well here, wishing to hear frequently of your welfare.</P>
<P>Your Peasher Vancatroyloo has brought the Visseel Bakees, and delivered them to me, as <HI>also what you sent him for me to deliver to my master, which I have done. My master at first refused to take it, because he is unacquainted with your disposition,</HI> or what kind of a person you are. But after I made
<PB N="92" REF="204"/>
encomiums on your goodness and greatness of mind, and took my oath to the same, and that <HI>it would not become public,</HI> but be held as precious as our lives, <HI>my master accepted it.</HI> You may remain satisfied, that I will get the Ongole business settled in your name, I will cause the jamaubundee to be settled agreeable to your desire. It was formerly the Nabob's intention to give this business to you, as the Governor knows full well, but did not at that time agree to it, which you must be well ac∣quainted with.</P>
<P>Your Peasher Vancatroyloo is a very careful good man—he is well experienced in business— <HI>he has bound me by an oath to keep all this business secret, and that his own, yours, and my lives are re∣sponsible for it.</HI> I write this letter to you with the greatest reluctance, and I signified the same to your Peasher, and declared that I would not write to you by any means; to this the Peasher urged, that <HI>if I did not write to his master, how could he know to whom he (the Peasher) delivered the money,</HI> and what must his master think of it? therefore I write you this letter, and send it by my servant Ramanah, accompanied by the Peasher's servant, and it will come safe to your hands: after perusal you will send it back to me immediately—until I receive it I don't like to eat my victuals, or take any sleep. Your Peasher took his oath, and urged me to write this for your satisfaction, and has engaged to me that I shall have this letter returned to me in the space of twelve days.</P>
<P>The present Governor is not like the former Go∣vernors—he is a very great man in Europe— and all the great men of Europe are much obliged to him for his condescension in accepting the govern∣ment of this place. It is his custom when he makes friendship with any one to continue it always, and
<PB N="93" REF="205"/>
if <HI>he is at enmity with any one, he never will desist till he has worked his destruction; he is now exceedingly displeased with the Nabob, and you will understand by and by that the Nabob's business cannot be carried on,</HI> he (the Nabob) will have no power to do any thing in his own affairs; <HI>you have therefore no room to fear him.</HI> You may remain with a contented mind— I desired the Governor to write you a letter for your satisfaction; the Governor said he would do so when the business was settled. This letter you must peruse as soon as possible, and send it back with all speed by the bearer Ramadoo, ac∣companied by three or four of your people, to the end that no accident may happen on the road. These people must be ordered to march in the night only, and to arrive here with the greatest dispatch. You sent ten mangoes for my master, and two for me, which all I have delivered to my master, thinking that ten was not sufficient to pre∣sent him with. I write this for your information, and salute you with ten thousand respects.</P>
