<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of CHESTERFIELD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did not dare, so coldly was this Play received by the Town, to ask Leave, in the usual Forms, to dedicate it to your Lordship. Its Fate was early determin∣ed, and in such a Manner, that I very lit∣tle flatter myself, it can be worthy of your Lordship's Patronage, or may presume to boast it was once honoured with your Ap∣probation. But as I may, probably, never have another Opportunity, certainly not in this Kind of writing, of publicly professing my Respect, my Esteem, I had almost said, my Affection for your Lordship, may I not be forgiven, if I thus dedicate, not the Play, but its Author; not his Poetry, but his Understanding and his Heart?</P>
<P>WITH Sentiments such as these, I dare assure your Lordship, you shall not be in∣sulted with the usual, too civil, Language of Dedications. Yet I confess, I would gladly recover the Name of Dedications to its an∣tient Dignity, before they were prostituted, most absurdly prostituted, by the Author of the <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> when he dedicated to a Tyrant a Poem in Defence of Liberty. I
<PB REF="4"/>
confess, I mean to praise; for honest Praise is not only one of the warmest Incitements to Virtue, but its most honourable Reward. Great Minds will receive it with their na∣tural Greatness, and only little Spirits have an Affectation of refusing it. The Task, I own, is not without Difficulty, but when the Original is marked with strong and pleasing Lines of Life, a meaner Hand may preserve the Likeness. The Integrity of his Colouring, if I may be allowed the Ex∣pression, is of more Consequence, than the Glow and Richness of it. Dedications would then be like Pictures in Miniature, which the future Historian might draw out into larger Proportion, Grace, and Dig∣nity.</P>
<P>LET me then have the Honour of in∣forming your Lordship's Historian, that al∣though your Youth perhaps was spent, a∣mong Pleasures, not ill-suited to that gay∣er Season of Life (neque tu choreas sperne, puer) yet it was not lost among its too fre∣quent Dissipations. Ancient and modern Languages, with an accurate and critical Knowledge of the English Tongue, its Har∣mony, Copiousness, and Variety of Expres∣sion, are not to be acquired without much Application. Nor could the greatest natu∣ral
<PB REF="5"/>
Abilities, not even your own, my Lord, have appeared in the most important De∣bates of the House of Lords, with such superior Strength of Reasoning, with Elo∣quence (in the true Character of Eloquence) at once pleasing and powerful, had they not been improved by all Advantages of Education.</P>
<P>TO such Abilities were intrusted the Ho∣nour and Interest of the Nation in Embassies abroad, and the most important Employ∣ments at Home. How happily for IRELAND was the Possessor of them sent thither as Lord Lieutenant in that dangerous Crisis, the late Rebellion? One Part of the Na∣tion, the natural Enemies of his Majesty's Government, were to be awed by Power, tempered with Lenity; the other were to be restrained in their Zeal of Loyalty, which though sometimes shewn, perhaps, with too much Warmth, hath ever been their Glory and their Boast. How happily the Goodness of your Lordship's Heart was mixed with the Wisdom of your Councils, the Gratitude of the whole People will for ever acknowledge. Long may you enjoy their Wishes, their Prayers for your Hap∣piness. Long may you enjoy the Con∣sciousness of your own Integrity, that nobly
<PB REF="6"/>
refused a Vote of Credit, and an Offer of raising a Body of Forces, which you wisely foresaw would be an useless Expence to the Kingdom. What must be the Firmness, and Generosity of that Spirit, which is not to be seduced by Gold, intimidated by Dan∣ger, or corrupted by Views of enlarging its Power!</P>
<P>YOUR Lordship now seems determined (and surely the gallant Veteran deserves his Dismission) to retire from all public Business. Permit, my Lord, this honest Dedication, for well you know that Flattery would not desire it, to attend you to your Retreat, and with it be pleased to accept the sincerest Respect of</P>

<L>O'ER a soft Tale of well imagin'd Woes</L>
<L>The willing Tear with feeble Transport flows;</L>
<L>But when the Muse in her own Griefs appears,</L>
<L>The storied Sorrows of a thousand Years;</L>
<L>A nobler Tribute, than our Tears we pay,</L>
<L>Our Passions hear her, and our Hearts obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such Scenes to-night—Oh! for a Muse of Fire,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Shakespear,</HI> thine, our Author to inspire;</L>
<L>Then fierce Ambition, Guilt, Despair, and Rage,</L>
<L>And frantic Jealousy should shake the Stage;</L>
<L>Tyrants and Slaves her equal Wrath should find,</L>
<L>Her Furies haunt them, and revenge Mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where's the modern Spirit can sustain</L>
<L>The Weight of Greece, or draw the Roman Scene?</L>
<L>Their Heroes seem of some superior State,</L>
<L>Great in their Virtues, in their Vices great;</L>
<L>Here wild Ambition Earth and Heaven defies,</L>
<L>And there—Oh! glorious Fate! the Patriot greatly dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if, with modest Hope, our Author aim</L>
<L>At your Applause—for your Applause is Fame,</L>
<L>Let him, to-night, your wonted Candour find,</L>
<L>Oh! be the Critic's Eye a little blind;</L>
<L>And if to You, ye Fair, he pours his Heart,</L>
<L>To your Distresses gives his tenderest Art,</L>
<L>To Beauty, Virtue, and to You he sues,</L>
<L>As you inspir'd—Oh! patronize his Muse.</L>

<LG>
<L>WELL! you expect—so says the Taste in Vogue—</L>
<L>To these sad Scenes a laughing Epilogue!</L>
<L>But I'm untaught in every comic Grace,</L>
<L>Wit's bolder Mirth, or Humour's various Face;</L>
<L>Nor shall I dare, with your lov'd, mimic, Art,</L>
<L>Take off the Cit—the Beau—the Blood—the Smart.</L>
<L>Shall I the dear Coquet's sweet Trifling try?</L>
<L>Pish—as I live—be quiet—let me die—</L>
<L>Then, melt a Look—deliciously explaining</L>
<L>The double—no, good Faith! the single Meaning.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As for our Play—methinks, this tragic Plot</L>
<L>Might furnish precious Hints, for you know what—</L>
<L>To leave an Empress—tho' so wondrous chaste—</L>
<L>With a young Lover—two full Hours at least—</L>
<L>In our frail Times, this dangerous tete a tete—</L>
<L>In the first Act—had made the Play complete.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then the Moral—ye, whose happy Lives</L>
<L>Are bless'd with rare Discretion—in your Wives;</L>
<L>When Trifles—light as Air—shall turn your Heads,</L>
<L>Ah! shun that naughty Trick—of separate Beds,</L>
<L>Besides the midnight—reconciling Billing,</L>
<L>Ah! think, how near was <HI>CONSTANTINE</HI> to killing.</L>
<L>But hush our Bard—</L>
<L>If should he hear us laughing, wont he say,</L>
<L>Your flippant Mirth,—good Ma'am—may damn my Play.</L>
<L>Then for my Sake—but I'm in such a Fright—</L>
<L>Well—I'll give out the Play—for Monday Night.</L>

<STAGE>Miss BELLAMY's Illness prevented her speaking it.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>IN all this Scene of Treason, Swords and Death</L>
<L>My Fright has almost ta'en away my Breath;</L>
<L>And yet our Bard insists, that I must say</L>
<L>Something for him, and something for his Play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most of the Fair-ones sure must be contented,</L>
<L>And must approve the Part I've represented,</L>
<L>Who think these Characters no Stain to Life,</L>
<L>The duteous Daughter, and the tender Wife,</L>
<L>Who taste the highest Blessings, while they prove</L>
<L>The Husband's Fondness, and the Parent's Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' I confess, there are of our sweet Sex,</L>
<L>Who, form'd to please, transform themselves to vex;</L>
<L>Rebels to gentlest Sway, Foes to Restriction,</L>
<L>Whose chiefest Bliss is plac'd in Contradiction;</L>
<L>Who think Obedience to the milder Will</L>
<L>Of a kind Parent, smells of Childhood still.</L>
<L>And that the Father should not be obey'd—</L>
<L>Not half an Hour—after the Portion's paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To such alone, whose virtuous Bosoms prove</L>
<L>Paternal Fondness, or connubial Love</L>
<L>Our Author freely offers up his Cause,</L>
<L>And let those generous Passions stand for Laws;</L>
<L>By them he will be try'd; if they acquit,</L>
<L>He's safe; if they condemn, he must submit.</L>

<L>The Empress, Sir!</L>

<L>Ill of whom?</L>
<L>Not of my Wife? my FULVIA? Is she not</L>
<L>A noble Proof, where Men may see, and wonder</L>

<L>You are a Christian; Truth is your Religion;</L>

<L>It was my Sense of Honour and Allegiance,</L>

<L>I might have learn'd (not thus abrupt and bold)</L>
<L>With silken Language to have cloth'd my Purpose.</L>
<L>But, Sir, I am a Soldier, rough, and simple,</L>

<L>Oh! my dear Lord forget it, lest th' Idea</L>

<L>The Empress was in private with AURELIAN.</L>

<L>Dear my Lord—</L>

<L>She was most just; most faithful to her Promise.</L>
<L>With more than Woman's Arts; with Tears, Distrac∣tion;</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBINUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>In Truth, 'tis somewhat strange. Yet still, my Lord,</L>
<L>Appearances, most probable, are oft</L>
<L>Most false. Truth is of simpler Kind.</L>
<L>And unperplex'd with Circumstance. AURELIAN</L>
<L>Has every Shew of Worth; is brave and wise,</L>

<L>That Marriage made her yours.</L>

<L>He lov'd to Madness—for he lov'd like me.</L>
<L>Fool that I was; dull Fool. I thought his Friendship</L>
<L>Conquer'd his Love; but, oh! that Thought how vain</L>
<L>My own Heart proves. Amidst these wildest Transports</L>
<L>My Reason hates; my Glory sickens at her,</L>
<L>Yet still my Soul's in Love. With lavish Tongue</L>
<L>She dwelt upon his Praise—"The Soldier's Pride;</L>

<L>Of that I question. But my present Hours</L>
<L>Have other Cares. This Night your Lord, your Em∣peror</L>
<L>Began to be immortal. Ere he went</L>
<L>To take his Throne among his kindred Gods,</L>
<L>(We shall to-morrow deify his Virtues)</L>
<L>He left a Present for his much-lov'd FULVIA;</L>
<L>That noble Choice of Death.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter a Soldier with a Dagger and a Bowl of Poison.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULVIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! truly welcome,</L>
<L>Thou Freedom of the Soul, at whose great Bidding</L>
<L>Th' immortal Spirit wings its gladsome Way,</L>
<L>Throws off its Earth, and sports without its Weight</L>
<L>In yonder Fields of Light. There mine, perhaps,</L>
<L>May meet my Lord, cloth'd with ethereal Brightness;</L>
<L>How the World shrinks, with all its vast Ambition,</L>
<L>Its little Greatness at a Thought like this.</L>
<STAGE>[Taking the Bowl.</STAGE>
<L>Now, thou immortal Spirit of my Lord,</L>
<L>In whatsoever Orb of Light enthron'd,</L>
<L>Look down upon me, your suspected FULVIA.</L>
<L>This to our second Nuptial Day in Heaven.</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>As she is going to drink</HI> CONSTANTINE <HI>enters with</HI> AURELIAN, MARCELLUS. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONSTANTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is it then given me, ye all-gracious Powers,</L>
<L>Once more to gaze upon thy Beauty's Wonders!</L>
<L>While Love—for, oh! the Rage of Jealousy,</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="73"/>Even Madness self was Love—now cover'd o'er</L>
<L>With Blushes, with Confusion, kneels before thee.</L>
<STAGE>[He kneels.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULVIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Restor'd to Life! Can Miracles do this?</L>
<STAGE>[CONSTANTINE <HI>rises.</HI></STAGE>
<L>'Tis he; 'tis he! My living Lord, my Emperor!</L>
<L>For, oh, my Heart, I feel thy wonted Transports,</L>
<L>Which he alone, the Lord of Love, inspires.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONSTANTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! excellent in Goodness! My AURELIAN,</L>
<L>Behold, and wonder at the bright Perfection.</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> FULVIA.</STAGE>
<L>He too forgives, O generous Proof of Friendship,</L>
<L>The Outrage to his Virtue. See MARCELLUS,</L>
<L>And know my Safety thence. ALBINUS thought him</L>
<L>Firm to their Cause, and sent him to the Legions,</L>
<L>To gain their Strength. He thence returned at Night;</L>
<L>Came by the secret Way to my Apartment,</L>
<L>And told to my astonish'd Ears such Horrors—</L>
<L>Then begg'd, in Proof of his Fidelity,</L>
<L>To lay a Slave, who was this Morn condemn'd,</L>
<L>In th' Imperial Bed. MAXIMIAN's Rage</L>
<L>Declares the rest.</L>

<L>Hence with that Slave, and bear him to his Fate.</L>
<STAGE>[ALBINUS <HI>carried out.</HI></STAGE>

<L>But, Sir, my Father—Speak; Oh! Look upon me.</L>
<L>Oh! Hear these speechless Sorrows; hear and pity me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>
<SPEAKER>CONSTANTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>With all the fearful Tenderness of Love;</L>
<L>With Eyes, that flow in Pity; with a Tongue,</L>
<L>That faulters to pronounce it—can I speak it?</L>
<L>The Justice of the World demands his Fate.</L>
<STAGE>[As commanding him to go.</STAGE>
<L>MARCELLUS, tho' I know th' ungrateful Office—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULVIA <HI>kneeling.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! for his Sake, th' eternal Power of Mercy,</L>
<L>Who when thy great Heart's quell'd by Age or Sick∣ness,</L>
<L>Shall hear thy Weakness, hear thy Cries of Pain,</L>
<L>Give me my Father's Life. This Day has join'd</L>
<L>My Fame to his Misfortunes. Should he perish,</L>
<L>Oh! will it not be said, that I betray'd him?</L>
<L>And, can you, Sir, behold me; can you make me</L>
<L>A Name of horrid Parricide for ever?</L>
<L>To all succeeding Times? Unnumber'd Ages</L>
<L>Shall curse your FULVIA's Memory.</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> MARCELLUS.</STAGE>
<L>Stay; oh! stay.</L>
<L>I see soft Pity drop the saving Tear—</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> MARCELLUS.</STAGE>
<L>A little Moment more—and CONSTANTINE</L>
<L>Becomes a God of Mercy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONSTANTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is there a Strength in Man, that can resist</L>
<L>The Power of Beauty, when it pleads its Tears.</L>
<L>Go, my AURELIAN, and relieve his Terrors;</L>
<L>Sooth his Despair, his disappointed Rage:</L>
<L>Assure him of his Life, nor Life alone,</L>
<L>But grac'd with Honors, worthy of our Friendship.</L>
<L>My FULVIA shall be Mistress of his Fate.</L>

<SPEAKER>FULVIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Angels of Mercy, hear the sacred Sounds,</L>
<L>That bid my Father live.</L>
<L>And thou, O Love, in all thy golden Records,</L>
<L>For it is thine, preserve this Act of Wonder,</L>
<L>And on thy purple Pinions waft it wide</L>
<L>O'er Earth and Heaven, the Glory of thy Reign.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAXIMIAN <HI>speaking as he comes forward.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Well then; the Gods have otherwise decreed;</L>
<L>And be it so. MAXIMIAN shall appear,</L>
<L>(I thank thee, Jove; the Trial's worthy of me)</L>
<L>In his own Strength; superior to his Fortune,</L>
<L>And CAESAR's haughty Clemency.</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> AURELIAN.</STAGE>

<L>My Father—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAXIMIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>How that Name comes o'er my Heart!</L>
<L>She kneels and weeps! Art thou so wondrous good?</L>
<L>Can'st thou forgive me, FULVIA; call me Father,</L>
<L>And give me back thy Love? Did not my Rage</L>
<L>Accuse thy Innocence, and blast thy Fame?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULVIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>It was Ambition's Rage; no more remember'd.</L>
<L>But even Ambition shall be satisfied.</L>
<L>Greatness and Power, for CONSTANTINE hath spoke it,</L>
<L>Duty and Love, shall wait upon your Age,</L>
<L>'Till Time, with lenient Hand, shall lay it down</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="76"/>In honourable Death; 'till Fame shall crown</L>
<L>Your Life, and that last Hour with equal Glory.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAXIMIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>If Life could pass away in the Delight</L>
<L>Of fondly gazing on thee; could th' Idea</L>
<L>Of that full Sway, which aw'd the western World,</L>
<L>Be ever from my Memory; could I forget</L>
<L>I was an Emperor once, dispensing Fame,</L>
<L>Greatness and Honors round me, then, perhaps,</L>
<L>I might forget, I liv'd to be forgiven,</L>
<L>And bow'd me to the Power, that gave me Life,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONSTANTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>It shall not need—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAXIMIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indeed, my Lord, it shall not.</L>
<L>MAXIMIAN better shall consult his Glory.</L>
<L>Your Father, Sir, depos'd me; not by War,</L>
<L>By the fair Fortune of th' embattled Field,</L>
<L>But by his better Arts, and skill in Treaties,</L>
<L>Arts, which I boasted not; but yet it joy'd</L>
<L>My gloomy Soul, to think I should repay them</L>
<L>With equal Vengeance. Thence my haughty Spirit</L>
<L>Stoop'd to the Baseness of a midnight Murder.</L>
<L>You now would give me Life—to crown that Gift</L>
<L>An honourable Share of Power and Greatness.</L>
<L>Now mark a Generosity above thee;</L>
<L>Take from this Hand th' unrival'd Throne of Power,</L>
<L>The undivided Empire of the World,</L>
<STAGE>[Stabs himself.</STAGE>
<L>For my last Groan gives you the Universe.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONSTANTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! FULVIA—but I'll not insult thy Sorrows,</L>
<L>By talking Comfort to them. Yet remember,</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="77"/>Why we are placed thus high; not to exempt us</L>
<L>From human Woes, but that the World may learn</L>
<L>A nobler Fortitude by our Example.</L>
<L>To wake the Soul to Virtue, and impart</L>
<L>A warmer Spirit to the languid Heart,</L>
<L>The Passions were design'd; but here behold</L>
<STAGE>[Looking back to the Scenes.</STAGE>
<L>Wild when they Rage, by reason uncontroul'd,</L>
<L>Less rapid is the Storm's destructive Sway,</L>
<L>While Guilt, Remorse, Despair, and Ruin mark their Way.</L>
