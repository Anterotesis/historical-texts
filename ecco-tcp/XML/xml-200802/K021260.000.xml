</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Madam, my Injuries are of a different Na∣ture. The Fall that I feigned to have receiv'd from my Horse, as I was travelling homewards, was no∣thing more than a contrived Excuse for concealing my∣self in these Parts. In short, Madam, I am not what I seem.</P>

<P>You must know then, Madam, that I am a Woman of good Birth and considerable Fortune; my Name Amelia, the Daughter of Sir William Hartley. Perse∣cuted by my Family, who wou'd have driven me into the Arms of a Man, who is my mortal Aversion, I have taken Refuge here, under the Disguise that you now see me wear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Miss Hartley, your Distresses affect me, and I think you justified in the Step you have taken. Give me leave to ask you what Preference directed you to this Neighbourhood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Madam, your Question is a natural one, but the severest that can be asked me. What Preference directed me hither? it was a Passion so deeply rooted in my Heart, that no Time, no Injury can displace it. 'Twas Love.—How shall I excuse it to you?—Unhap∣py, disappointed Love.—O Frederick, Frederick! dear false forgetful Youth!</P>

<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do I hear? Was Frederick, was young Withers thus ingrateful, thus insensible? Let me hope, Amelia, there is some Misapprehension in this Matter: I know his Intimacy with your Brother, and that he made him a Visit this Summer of some Continuance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was then, Madam, that my poor Bosom lost that peaceful Indifference it had ever before enjoyed. My Family were then in Treaty with the Person I men∣tioned to you before: intoxicated with his extravagant Offers, they omitted no Measures to engage me to ac∣cept his Addresses; nay they were desperate enough to employ Frederick to solicit me: but alas! their Advocate ruined their Cause; my Heart first con¦ceived a Distaste to Lord Wealthy, and the Interposi∣tion of young Withers confirm'd me in my Aversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did Frederick betray his Commission by turning it to his own Advantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot charge him with that Dishonour; therein I must condemn myself: it was my own fond un∣guarded

Heart that told him too plainly what it felt; till one fatal Moment my Father surpriz'd him kneel∣ing at my Feet, and the next transported him from my Sight for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Relation, my dear Amelia, is truly pitiable; but as you know not what Motives Frederick had for so abruptly leaving you, so I think you cannot positively charge him with Infidelity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, how kindly you console me! I own to you I have some Hopes that Frederick still remembers me, and still loves me: those Hopes conducted me hither; I find he is this Day expected home; this Event and Sir Antony's ridiculous Assiduities make it no longer possible for me to conceal myself at his Te∣nant's. I must therefore retire till by some means I can discover the real State of Frederick's Heart. What I have to entreat of you, Madam, is, for a short Time to afford me the Protection of your House.</P>

<P>I have made free with some of his Worship's Flowers; there is no Robbery in that I trust. She stays a long while methinks! sure no Accident has betided her! I am fit to think his old Honour does not bear an honest Mind towards her; he is always hankering about our House, and I am sure, before Mrs. Clara was with us, he never us'd to come to Father's, except upon Rent-day. I don't know what ails me; I am not half the Lad I was awhile ago; I neither eat, nor sleep, nor work as I us'd to do; and as for Wakes and Pastimes and such like, lackaday! I have no longer any Heart for them, or any thing else.</P>

<P>Alas! Henry, I came to bid you farewel. Some Reasons which I can't explain to you, oblige me to take a hasty Leave of your Father and Mother, and depart this Night. Well, Henry, give me my Things.—Commend me kindly to the good Folks; tell them I'll call in the Evening, and settle Matters with them to their Satisfaction:—as for thee, my good Lad, I desire you will accept this Purse; I hope it will compensate for the Trouble I have given thee, and the Ill-will thou hast got from thy Landlord on my Account.—Why, what dost weep for, Henry?</P>

If any thing's amiss, that they can remedy, they'll be proud to do it, I'll vouch for them—and as for me, If I be in Fault, I ask your Pardon heartily on my Knees.</P>

<P>Nothing is amiss, nothing. Kneel not to me, young Man; your Humility, your Tenderness oppresses me.

<P>Save you, Sir, may the Sun-beam never scorch you by Day, nor the Dew-damps strike you by Night: for the Stars tell strange Tales, and, if you are false-hearted, Perjury is wrote on the Face of the Moon, and every Owl-ey'd Wizard can read it. For my own Part, I care not who sees my Face; 'tis honest, and such as Na∣ture made it; but there are Spies abroad, and therefore I go mask'd.</P>
