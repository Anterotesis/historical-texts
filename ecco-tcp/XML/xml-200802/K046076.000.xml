<HEAD>TO THE Right Honorable, and Publick-Spirited, The <HI>President, Officers,</HI> and <HI>Committee,</HI> OF THE SOCIETY FOR <HI>Encouragement</HI> of LEARNING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LEST it shou'd be consider'd as a Disregard of Pro∣priety, when a Poem of a <HI>Satirical</HI> Species, is ad∣dress'd to the Patronage most distinguish'd for Ex∣tent of Humanity, please to receive it, as a poetical <HI>Janus</HI>; of whose Opposite two Faces, the fairest and best drawn you will find to be <HI>Panegyric.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, on That Side, you were <HI>attach'd.</HI>—And, such devoted Admirers of the <HI>Life</HI> wou'd with Difficulty have been brought to allow a <HI>Resemblance</HI> in the <HI>Picture.</HI> Whereas, on the Side of the <HI>Satire,</HI> you cou'd not pos∣sibly
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
be Parties concerned: and were, therefore, best qualify'd, to judge it, impartially.</P>
<P>YET, since it is not by any Merit of mine, that you are so safe on the Satirical Quarter, It was fit I shou'd do <HI>something,</HI> that might have room to expect your Acknow∣ledgment. I have, therefore, declin'd any <HI>Encomium</HI> on your generous Society; or on Any of its particular Mem∣bers: tho', to Every Reader, <HI>not such,</HI> It wou'd have in∣creas'd the <HI>Delight</HI> of the Poem.</P>
<P>BUT, You are such Enemies to every Kind of <HI>Corrup∣tion,</HI> that I apprehended the very Appearance, of an Attempt at evading your <HI>Judgment,</HI> by engaging your <HI>Generosity</HI> in my Favour.</P>
<P>IN this Situation, there are preserv'd to you all the na∣tural Rights of the <HI>Critic.</HI> Yet, I am under no Pain from the Use you may make of that Freedom: For, what candid Writer wou'd wish to escape a Reproach, where, being sure of its <HI>Justice,</HI> he can be made but the Wiser, from Effect of its <HI>Severity?</HI> And, as to the more desirable <HI>Reverse</HI> of the Prospect, no Man is in Danger of missing your <HI>Approbation,</HI> unless he has, no where, <HI>deserved</HI> it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Muses</HI> have used you too kindly, not to expect your <HI>Concern,</HI> for the Fate you will find 'em reduc'd to: And, to hear of <HI>your</HI> Grief, and good Wishes in their Be∣half, may, from the Knowledge they have of your <HI>Conse∣quence,</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
deserve to be thought little less, than a <HI>Balance,</HI> for the Neglect they are under, from Thousands.</P>
<P>BUT, to speak a plain Truth, without <HI>Metaphor,</HI> what∣ever Advantage the Poetical World wou'd have deriv'd from imaginary <HI>Muses,</HI> might be, <HI>really,</HI> an Effect, of some such confederate Influence as yours, in good Earnest ex∣erted.</P>
<P>HOW many great and desirable Changes in literate Taste, may we not reasonably expect, from the associated Preva∣lence of Numbers, united, as <HI>you</HI> are, upon the most ge∣nerous Principle in Nature, an unprofitable and voluntary Pursuit of the Benefit of Others, from Effect of your own Cost, and Labour?</P>
<P>TO instance, in One, the most obvious and easy of many: How soon wou'd our present low Relish for <HI>dra∣matical Buffoonery</HI> give Way, to your <HI>nobler Example?</HI>—persevering (indeed, with some necessary Obstinacy) to applaud, and support, good <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy:</HI> till what is now but mere <HI>Reason,</HI> might have the Honour to be consider'd as <HI>Fashion</HI>—by Concurrence of your munifi∣cent Endeavours, but for one or two short Winters?</P>
<P>AND, yet, what a National Deliverance were This!—With what Effusion of <HI>unmercenary</HI> Gratitude would it immortalize those generous Conquerors, who, protecting the noblest of our Youth from bad Principles, had, by
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
expelling Mean-spiritedness, Corruption, and Folly, from our <HI>Theatres,</HI> intercepted them in their Passage upward, into Situations whence their Effects, extended wider, be∣come in Proportion more dreadful.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Misconceptions have arisen, with View to your more immediate and particular good Purpose, from its Relation to the <HI>Profession</HI> of a considerable Body, in Trade, whose Interest may appear to be concern'd, not in the <HI>Intention,</HI> but <HI>Effect,</HI> of your Establishment, There will never, I am persuaded, lie any Objection at all against this opener and easier Road, to the Redemption of one Branch of Polite Learning, that stands in too visible Need of your Patronage.</P>
<P>AND, now, since All the Motive I had to this distant Address was the Pleasure of professing, in public, my Re∣spect for so <HI>public</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI>; you will forgive me, that I with-hold from your Knowledge a Discovery of so little Importance, as the <HI>Name,</HI> of</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your devoted Humble Servant, <HI>The Author.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>NOT assuming such an Air of Authority, as to give Rules, much less <HI>Examples,</HI> of Writing, the Author in the fol∣lowing Verses intended no more, than an humble Attempt, from mere private Curiosity, upon an Idea of <HI>Satire,</HI> which appear'd to be <HI>New:</HI> or not <HI>practis'd.</HI></P>
<P>There is indeed, something so like <HI>Cruelty</HI> in the <HI>Face</HI> of that Species of Poetry, that it can only be reconcil'd to <HI>Humanity,</HI> by the general Benevolence of its <HI>Purpose:</HI> attacking Particulars, for the Public Advantage.</P>
<P>But, methinks, It gives up this <HI>End,</HI> (which is Reformation) when, mistaking the <HI>Means,</HI> It attempts the good Work with a Hand either too <HI>rough,</HI> or too <HI>gentle.</HI></P>
<P>In the first Case, It <HI>corrodes,</HI> where It professes to <HI>cure:</HI> In the second, It is only sportive and wanton, with what It shou'd <HI>correct,</HI> and discountenance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Medium</HI> perhaps might be found, in an Art like that of the <HI>Painters:</HI> who, by opposing their <HI>Shades</HI> against <HI>LIGHTS,</HI> call out Darkness into open Distinction.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>So, Enormities, which <HI>Satirists</HI> wou'd censure, are but dimly and imperfectly mark'd, till the <HI>Defect</HI> admits Disgrace, from the Neighbourhood of <HI>Perfection.</HI>—Then Contempt stings more scarply, in <HI>One,</HI> by the compar'd Admiration of the <HI>Other:</HI> Be∣sides, that the Censur'd are driven, at the same Time, from their la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t little Refuge of Vanity, and can no longer recriminate upon the Censurer his <HI>Ill-nature,</HI> and Malevolence of Purpose.</P>
<P>I am afraid, there is another Particular, that calls aloud for the Regard of the <HI>Satirist:</HI> and That is, a Reflexion, how far Decency may make it a <HI>Duty,</HI> to abandon his personal Self, and insinuate Opinions, with <HI>Modesty.</HI> I mean from the Mouth of some <HI>figurative Speaker,</HI> whom He ought to <HI>suppose</HI> of more Con∣sequence; and whose Sentiments the Reader will <HI>be sure</HI> to receive with less Scruple.</P>
<P>There is a Meaning, in the very <HI>Name,</HI> of a <HI>Poet,</HI> that shou'd seem to prescribe us this Duty: And the Use and Necessity of <HI>In∣vention</HI> can never be more manifest, than where the Subject is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vidious, as <HI>Satire.</HI></P>
<P>Who is there, to say Truth, so unguilty of the Follies of Life, that he dares, in his own proper Person, stand out and <HI>justify</HI> the Right he assumes, of reproaching the Conduct of Others?</P>
<P>Reproof is too bitter a Potion, to be welcome from our Sense of its <HI>Use.</HI> And the administring Hand shou'd be <HI>dear,</HI> not <HI>disgustful,</HI> if it would incline us to taste it, with Pleasure.</P>
<P>I thought it but necessary, to prefix this short Note, to an Es∣say toward a <HI>New Kind of Satire.</HI> I will not pretend to assert my own System: because it is the most probable Thing in the World, that I shou'd conceive a <HI>mistaken Idea.</HI> Yet, since by frequent At∣tempts and Miscarriages, there are started, at least, some good <HI>Hints,</HI> He, whose false Steps have contributed either to the Caution, or Direction, of Others, may be said to have <HI>err'd, with Good Fortune.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L><HI>GERMANICUS,</HI> for Love, and Empire, born,</L>
<L>At once to <HI>govern</HI> Kingdoms, and <HI>adorn</HI>;</L>
<L>Too good for Greatness, but that Kings can <HI>bless,</HI></L>
<L>Too firm for Fear, but of his <HI>Friend</HI>'s Distress:</L>
<L>Fore-temp'ring Pow'r by Reason's generous Plan,</L>
<L>To task the <HI>Monarch,</HI> meditates the <HI>Man.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN a Town Grove, whence Dryads <HI>Noise</HI> exclude,</L>
<L>And hush loud Streets, to Sylvan Solitude,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>Veil'd by a verdant Skreen's incircling Shade,</L>
<L>Whose angly Sides eight arching Lights pervade,</L>
<L>Friend to Mankind, their pensive Fav'rite stood;</L>
<L>Revolving previous Plans of purpos'd Good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOFT, to his Sight, a <HI>Female Suppliant</HI> press'd,</L>
<L>In all the speaking Marks of Mis'ry dress'd:</L>
<L>Down-look'd, relax'd of Mien, oft bending, low;</L>
<L>Now stopping short, now re-advancing, slow:</L>
<L>Pardon, she cry'd, th' intruding Sighs of Grief;</L>
<L>Hope is the friendless Wretche's <HI>last</HI> Relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>GERMANICUS,</HI> who when Distress draws nigh,</L>
<L>Catches quick Sorrow, from the Suff'rer's Eye,</L>
<L>With gentle Waft invites her back'ning Fears,</L>
<L>And smiles the Warmth of Pity on her Tears.</L>
<L>Her, while advancing, heedful he survey'd,</L>
<L>Chance stretch'd his Eye to the remoter Shade:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>Where, dimly obvious from the bord'ring Wood,</L>
<L>Dark'ning the Arches, Eight new Phantoms stood;</L>
<L>All, like the First, thin Forms of shivering Woe,</L>
<L>Wept All—in dumb, sad, solemn, circly Show!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THINK, cry'd th' Approacher, prostrate at his Feet,</L>
<L>How sharp is Insult! and Relief how sweet!</L>
<L>Pity a wretched Sisterhood of Tears:</L>
<L>Nine friendless Mourners, whom no Comfort chears.</L>
<L>All Arts were Ours, that polish'd Life cou'd gain:</L>
<L>But Arts, and polish'd Life, were Ours in vain.</L>
<L>See! what Reward wish'd Knowledge cou'd impart!</L>
<L>Where Fool is Fashion, Ignorance is <HI>Art.</HI></L>
<L>Urg'd by Derision, and escaping Hate,</L>
<L>We, sad, slow, Exiles, seek some gentler Fate.</L>
<L>To the bleak <HI>North's</HI> new-rising Coasts we go;</L>
<L>Less <HI>cold</HI> than These, amidst eternal <HI>Snow.</HI></L>
<L>Glory's gay Beams, to whose felt Warmth we run,</L>
<L>More than supply the Absence of their Sun.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>There, mourning Merit cannot miss Relief;</L>
<L>Where watchful <HI>Pow'r</HI> supplants <HI>prevented</HI> Grief.</L>
<L>Fam'd for Munificence, Thy princely Hand</L>
<L>Singly <HI>absolves</HI> an unbestowing Land.</L>
<L>Ah! Save the Friendless—Help the Wrong'd away:</L>
<L>Too <HI>poor</HI> to go, yet too <HI>un-lov'd</HI> to stay!</L>
<L><HI>Pay</HI> but wish'd <HI>Passage</HI> from this cruel Shore:</L>
<L>And never, never, will we trust it more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SCARCE had th' imploring Accents voic'd her Pray'r,</L>
<L>When the known Sounds and recollected Air</L>
<L>Through the false Semblance, natively convey'd,</L>
<L>To the charm'd Prince, a speaking <HI>Muse,</HI> betray'd.</L>
<L>Round, while, uncrediting the storied Woe,</L>
<L>His curious Eyes discov'ring Glances, throw,</L>
<L>Th' examin'd Umbrage, as he turn'd, reveal'd</L>
<L>Each <HI>Muse,</HI> that every distant Arch conceal'd.</L>
<L>Waiting impatient, for the finish'd Tale,</L>
<L>Quit your vain Hope, he cry'd, by <HI>Want's</HI> thin Veil</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/><HI>Unhid,</HI> to 'scape the Rev'rence of my Zeal,</L>
<L>Who all your Power, through all your Changes, feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>JOYFUL, He snatch'd th' Implorer from the Ground,</L>
<L>Then, turning graceful, bow'd progressive, round;</L>
<L>Press'd their joint Access undisguis'd and gay;</L>
<L>And shone, receptive of each effluent Ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SEATED, and circled by the beamy Train,</L>
<L>Their Shapes, resuming, and Themselves again,</L>
<L>Tell me, said He—Ye Soul-inspiring <HI>Nine!</HI></L>
<L>Ye living Fires, that give the Great, to <HI>shine!</HI></L>
<L>Who, quick'ning Regal Courage into Flame,</L>
<L>Guide it, by Justice, to immortal Fame!</L>
<L>Why wou'd ye <HI>leave</HI> a Land distinguish'd, long,</L>
<L>For Love of Valour, and for Hate of Wrong?</L>
<L>Where Freedom unrestrain'd her Empire holds,</L>
<L>And Legal Monarchy new Bloom unfolds?</L>

<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<L>HE paus'd—and CLIO answering, thus began,</L>
<L>Perish pale <HI>Malice!</HI>—It oblit'rates <HI>Man.</HI></L>
<L>Where Envy <HI>blasts,</HI> the Muse inspires in vain:</L>
<L>No human Culture, there, extends its Reign.</L>
<L>Lost in Malignity by civil Hate,</L>
<L>Virtues that clash with Virtues curse a State.</L>
<L>Stifled in Faction, Arts unfriended sink:</L>
<L>Or, pigmy'd into partial Flatt'ry shrink.</L>
<L><HI>Hist'ry</HI> must blush, the Wiles of <HI>Spleen</HI> to pen,</L>
<L>And grace the bloodless Broils of angry Men.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SMOTHER'D in <HI>Self,</HI> there breathes no public Soul,</L>
<L>Where sep'rate Strugglings gen'ral Strength controul:</L>
<L>There, Policy's old gen'rous Straitness <HI>bends</HI>;</L>
<L>And shifting <HI>Medium</HI> crawls, to sidelong Ends.</L>
<L>There, Fraud <HI>triumphant</HI> tempts the Just to fall:</L>
<L>And every one Man's Gain is Loss, to All.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>There, Love internal, checking Sighs that roam,</L>
<L>Begins, and ends, all Charity,—at Home.</L>
<L>Each Pray'r appropriates one Man's modest Aim:</L>
<L>And humbly trusts to <HI>God</HI> the Common Claim.</L>
<L>Crush'd by Contempt of Praise, <HI>Exertion</HI> dies:</L>
<L>And Public Spirit, laugh'd at, shuns to rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THITHER when Hope misleads th' Historic Muse,</L>
<L>Swift let her seek some Scene of nobler Views.</L>
<L>Where guileless Pow'r no Praise to <HI>Graft</HI> ascribes,</L>
<L>Where Courage scorns <HI>Deceit,</HI> and Duty—<HI>Bribes.</HI></L>
<L>Where nervous Meaning dares, <HI>directly,</HI> speak:</L>
<L>And crooked Windings teach no Truth to <HI>sneak.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TIS <HI>found</HI>—for, see!—The icy <HI>Pole</HI> dissolves!</L>
<L>Honour's new Warmth with sunny Force evolves!</L>
<L>There, glows <HI>Event!</HI> There, more than <HI>Roman</HI> Arms</L>
<L>Clash their <HI>prophetic</HI> Thunder's fear'd Alarms!</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>There, the puls'd Public beats, in ev'ry Vein:</L>

<L>No <HI>vile</HI> Pretension, there, at <HI>Titles</HI> aims:</L>
<L>No Pride-swoln Lumber <HI>lazy Lordship</HI> shames.</L>
<L>There, shines the <HI>Sword,</HI> in Honour's guarded Track,</L>

<L>Weigh'd the long Charge, and wish'd it, Half, untrue.</L>
<L>Sigh'd at the Waste domestic Discord made:</L>

<L>Snatch'd at <HI>One</HI> sweet Example, <HI>New</HI> to <HI>Fame,</HI></L>
<L>Urg'd its dear Pow'r, th' <HI>Unhappier</HI> to reclaim:</L>

<L>Yet I, vain Hoper! Still new Helps apply:</L>
<L>And, ever failing, wou'd for ever <HI>try.</HI></L>
<L>To slighted Beauty wou'd new Powers impart;</L>
<L>And stretch the aided Empire of the Heart.</L>
<L>Teach Man, that Woman's Strength in Softness lies:</L>

<L>Int'rest and Vanity, and Self, disarm</L>
<L>Mutual Esteem, till neither Sex can charm.</L>

<L>Then, Man's <HI>lac'd Lightness</HI> apes the Lady's Air:</L>
<L>And bluff big Boldness <HI>masculates</HI> the Fair.</L>
<L>With changing Sexes, Love's lost Motives change,</L>
<L>From Wish to Wish the short-liv'd Passions range.</L>
<L>Recorded Constancy becomes <HI>Romance:</HI></L>
<L>And, among Millions, Two may love—by Chance!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHY should I, then, supporting present Scorn,</L>
<L>Stretch my too patient Hope, to Times unborn?</L>
<L>When, to the <HI>North,</HI> where Nature shines unstain'd,</L>
