<L>MOURN! Son of Amos, mourn! in accent sharp</L>

<L>Those lips, that, touch'd with thy coelestial fire,</L>
<L N="5">Clear'd, from the gather'd clouds of many an age,</L>
<L>The bright'ning flame of thy prophetic rage;</L>
<L>Those lips, thro' Learning's sacred sphere renown'd,</L>
<L>Have stain'd their▪glory by a servile sound.</L>
<L>Envy with ranc'rous joy these accents heard,</L>

Waging against Renown eternal wars,</L>

<L>"Forgotten prelates hail thee from the grave;</L>
<L>"O Lucifer! of prophecy the star,</L>
<L>"Rolling through Hebrew clouds thy radiant car!</L>
<L>"Art thou too fall'n as we? Can Flatt'ry's tide</L>
<L N="20">"Drown thy free spirit and thy Attic pride?</L>
<L>"Is this the man who spoke, in language strong,</L>
<L>"The praise of Liberty's Athenian song?</L>
<L>"Blest are her notes, but curst the sordid things</L>
<L>"That priestcraft offers to the pride of Kings;</L>
<L N="25">"For never, never shall fair Freedom's hand</L>
<L>"Enroll one prelate in her sacred band!"</L>

<L>Plunge ranks unsifted in the gulph of Shame?</L>
<L>If some be servile, shall we madly rave</L>
<L>That ev'ry churchman is in soul a slave?</L>
<L N="35">Abhorr'd idea! fraught with basest guile!</L>
<L>Turn to the splendid annals of our isle!</L>
<L>See mitred Langton lead the patriot van,</L>
<L>And bear, O Liberty! thy sacred plan!</L>
<L>Though lust of vengeance regal pride inflame</L>
<L N="40">To brand his virtue with Rebellion's name,</L>
<L>Still in the tented field, from fear exempt,</L>
<L>No menace shakes him, and no offers tempt;</L>
<L>Till England, sav'd from tyrannous control,</L>
<L>Owes her bright charter to his guardian soul.</L>
<L N="45">Let Freedom's eye our later story search!</L>
<L>Her modern champion issues from the church;</L>

<L N="50">God's gracious edict, and the rights of man!</L>
<L>To shield the dearest gift of Nature's hand</L>

<L>With ardent Sidney, with the milder Locke,</L>
<L N="55">And guarded by the Muse of Glory, shine</L>
<L>In manly Akenside's immortal line.</L>
<L>But these examples rise from hallow'd earth;</L>
<L>The church has models still of living worth:</L>
<L>Though some grave bishops, fond of dull repose,</L>
<L N="60">Without a dream of Learning's friends or foes,</L>
<L>Enjoy their table, or from thence withdrawn,</L>
<L>Sink in soft slumber on their sleeves of lawn;</L>
<L>Though one fierce pedant, proud of ancient rule,</L>
<L>Rashly mistook a senate for a school,</L>
<L N="65">Till angry nobles bid his fury cease,</L>
<L>And lash'd the fiery pedagogue to peace;</L>
<L>We boast a Shipley, who with taste refin'd</L>
<L>Enjoys that richest treasure, wealth of mind;</L>

Intent to pen, in Leisure's learned hour,</L>
<L N="70">His just Philippic on oppressive pow'r,</L>
<L>Or teach thy flow'rs, Simplicity, to bloom</L>
<L>With Attic sweetness o'er an English tomb.</L>
<L>Nor you with honour can we fail to name,</L>
<L>Law! gen'rous guardian of that sage's name, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preface to the new edition of Locke, by the Bishop of Carlisle.</NOTE></L>
<L N="75">Who made mild government with faith agree,</L>
<L>And "stripp'd intolerance of every plea."</L>
<L>Nor dignity corrupts, nor time subdues</L>
<L>Your spirit, glowing with the noblest views;</L>
<L>While your keen eyes, undimm'd by age, explore</L>
<L N="80">The utmost depths of metaphysic lore,</L>
<L>Still guard his fame, whose genius you enjoy,</L>
<L>And the dark sophist's baleful web destroy,</L>
<L>That seeks to shroud, with subtle falsehood spun,</L>
<L>The praise of Freedom's scientific Son!</L>
<L N="85">O Lowth! we saw thy radiant name on high</L>
<L>Amid the the purest lights of Learning's sky;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
And long, if true to Freedom's guiding voice,</L>
<L>Long in thy splendor shall that sphere rejoice;</L>
<L>One passing vapour shall dissolve away,</L>
<L N="90">And leave thy glory's unobstructed ray.</L>
<L>But while on Fame's high precipice you stand,</L>
<L>Be nobly firm! nor bend the virtuous hand,</L>
<L>Fill'd with rich sweets from Freedom's flow'ry mead,</L>
<L>To pluck Servility's oblivious weed!</L>
<L N="95">High in the Court's rank soil that creeper winds,</L>
<L>And oft with dark embrace the Crosier binds;</L>
<L>While squeez'd from thence the subtle prelate flings</L>
<L>Its luscious poison in the ear of Kings.</L>
<L>Nor spread in courts alone these noxious leaves,</L>
<L N="100">My Lord, as largely as he pays, receives,</L>
<L>And supple chaplains to a prelate bring</L>
<L>A dose as rich, as what he gives a King.</L>
<L>Such sycophants (could such to thee belong)</L>
<L>Might vent their venom on this friendly song;</L>
<L>"Shame on the wretch (these flatt'rers would exclaim)</L>
<L N="106">"Who dares one accent of your voice to blame,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>
"But fearing with your foes his name to blend,</L>
<L>"Yet, more abusive, calls himself your friend.</L>
<L>No! let that radiant Truth, whose pow'r supreme</L>
<L N="110">Rewards her genuine bard with Glory's beam,</L>
<L>Search my free spirit, and pronounce it clear</L>
<L>From meanness, spleen, malignity, or fear!</L>
<L>To ardent friendship I my numbers owe;</L>
<L>Whate'er their failings, from that source they flow;</L>
<L N="115">If weak, yet honest; if presumptuous, true;</L>
<L>Thy worth the motive, and thy fame the view!</L>
<L>The man whose writings pure delight dispense,</L>
<L>Enchant my fancy, or enlarge my sense,</L>
<L>Whose heav'nly wisdom mending human faults,</L>
<L N="120">Warms my chill'd virtue and my soul exalts;</L>
<L>Friend of my bosom I this man declare,</L>
<L>And in my inmost-heart the treasure wear,</L>
<L>Bishop or clerk! his fortune bright or blank!</L>
<L>Rever'd as noble whatsoe'er his rank!</L>
<L N="125">His praise I echo with a fond acclaim,</L>
<L>Joy in his health, and triumph in his fame.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
With pure attachment, and with joy refin'd,</L>
<L>I boast such friendship with thy letter'd mind.</L>
<L>Whene'er, with deep delight and new regard,</L>
<L N="130">We search thy comments on each Hebrew bard,</L>
<L>Where thy bold precepts to young minds impart</L>
<L>The end and value of the poet's art,</L>
<L>Its pow'rs ennobled by applause like thine,</L>

<L>When touch'd by Warburton's vindictive gall</L>
<L N="140">It fires at Freedom's controversial call;</L>
<L>From wounded Genius flows your splendid line,</L>
<L>As from the trodden grape the sparkling wine:</L>
<L>Your hand, like Israel's unanointed King</L>
<L>Launching the pebble from his certain sling,</L>
<L N="145"><PB N="13" REF="10"/>
Strikes to the dust Presumption's mighty boast,</L>
<L>The proud Goliah of her critic host.</L>
<L>Thus robe'd in honour of the richest dye,</L>
<L>And view'd by Freedom with a parent's eye,</L>
<L>From thee that goddess with amazement hears</L>
<L N="150">One note that sounds discordant in her ears;</L>
<L>Wild sparkles flash from her astonish'd eyes,</L>
<L>O save my falt'ring son! (she fondly cries)</L>
<L>Call his past glories to his sharpen'd sight,</L>
<L>And let him learn from their collected light,</L>
<L N="155">My flow'rs, immortal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear no winter's frown;</L>
<L>While lost in darkness Adulation's down</L>
<L>Flies like the gossamer, that whirlwinds bear,</L>
<L>In sport contemptuous, through the waste of air.</L>
<L>Tell him, though bright the smile of Kings may seem,</L>
<L N="160">There shines a jewel of a brighter beam,</L>
<L>Above that smile, all human wealth above,</L>
<L>'Tis worn by Keppel in his country's love.</L>
<L>Shall Lowth adapt no more his Attic style</L>
<L>To the meridian of my fav'rite isle?</L>
<L N="165"><PB N="14" REF="11"/>
But feebly speak, in France's languid tone,</L>
<L>Faint as beneath Oppression's burning zone?</L>
<L>Or, blazing only with a bigot's fire,</L>
<L>Awake the slumb'ring flames of regal ire;</L>
<L>Stretch the state-theorist on Priesthood's rack,</L>
<L N="170">And from the pulpit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the late sermon by the Bishop of London, and his note on Dr. Price.</NOTE>aim the personal attack?</L>
<L>Far other precepts suit the hallow'd sage,</L>
<L>Who aims to purify this venal age:</L>
<L>With juster wrath our mitred Lords declaim</L>
<L>On man's adult'rous guilt, and woman's shame;</L>
<L N="175">Yes! lovely woman! Fashion's wayward spleen</L>
<L>Has idly plung'd, like Aegypt's giddy queen,</L>
<L>Thy purity, that pearl of richest price,</L>

<L>Though thy unblushing frailties scorn excuse,</L>

Confirm'd by ages, let this truth be known,</L>
