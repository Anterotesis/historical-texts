<HEAD>REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Address the following Remarks to you, not be∣cause I pretend to guess at your Person, but because I think you are most interested in them; and I send you them plain and simple, without prefacing them either with Compliments or Acri∣mony.</P>
<P>I entirely agree with you in your first general Observation, (P. 2.) that of most, if not <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all Arts or Exertions of human Faculty, those which Dr. Brown has chosen for his Subject are most liable to be influenced by a Variety of Causes; seem∣ingly most remote and minute, and most difficult to be observed".</Q> But surely your Conclusion is not logical; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That to think, by laying down one or a few Principles, to deduce the Progress of them systematically, is parallel to <HI>Almanack∣makers</HI> foretelling the Weather."</Q> In my Opi∣nion the present Question is not whether they can be solved systematically or not, but whether Dr. B—'s Solution is just or groundless: And if
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
you apply this Conclusion to his Work, before you have examined it, your Determination must be ranked with the Judgments of those Coun∣tries, where they <HI>behead</HI> a Man first and try after∣wards whether he is Guilty.</P>
<P>Your second Observation is of the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Unimpor∣tance of such Investigations, as being mere amus∣ing Gratifications of Curiosity."</Q>Yet if you are really in earnest, how came you (who have affected to display so large a Fund of Reading) to have <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 2.</NOTE> employed so much of your Thoughts on a <HI>small Part</HI> of this very Subject? And <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> if ever you publish your Thoughts,"</Q>I ap∣peal to your own Heart, in what Estimation you would hold the Man who should tell you they were of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no Importance to Mankind, or rank <HI>them,</HI> as you have done Dr. B—'s, with <HI>Alma∣nack-making.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Your third Objection <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of the doctorial Man∣ner and Air of Science with which it has been fashionable of late to advance Conjectures;"</Q> is at least not liberal. If Dr. B—'s Conjectures are false, it <HI>ought</HI> to be Triumph enough for you to prove them so; if on the contrary, notwith∣standing your Arguments, they prove <HI>true, ought</HI> they not to be advanced with the Confidence of Truth, by a Man who knows them <HI>so."</HI></P>
<P>I entirely acquiesce in your fourth Observa∣tion <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, since Truth is the principal Purpose these Investigations can answer, <HI>Misrepresentation</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
or even <HI>Error</HI> in matter of Fact is less excusable in them than in any other Kind of Enquiry,"</Q> ex∣cept in such as <HI>your's</HI> and <HI>mine,</HI> where if we <HI>mis∣represent</HI> either thro' <HI>Prejudice</HI> or <HI>Partiality,</HI> or <HI>err</HI> in Matters of Fact when we would correct the <HI>Errors</HI> of others, then we are <HI>less excusable,</HI> be∣cause we are <HI>less honest.</HI></P>
<P>So much may suffice for your Preliminaries; The Body of your Work remains now to be exa∣mined.</P>
<P N="1">1. You say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will not take the Advantage of the obvious Ridicule which arises from the searching the Seeds and Principles of all the most refined and transporting Poetry of Greece, in the dreary Wilds of North-America <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>."</Q>—'Tis indeed out of the common road, for Dr. B. to carry us so <HI>far</HI> in Quest of <HI>Brutality,</HI> when he might have found it so much nearer Home, among the old <HI>Pelasgi</HI> of ancient <HI>Greece;</HI> who certainly were no better than the modern <HI>Iroquois.</HI> We know they were <HI>Acorn-Eaters</HI> and <HI>Man-Eaters:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sylvestres Homines,</HI> Sacer Interpresque Deorum, <HI>Caedibus</HI> &amp; <HI>Victu foedo</HI> deterruit ORPHEUS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Horace.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the most we know of them; and this we know of the modern <HI>Iroquois</HI> too, but then we know <HI>a great dealmore.</HI> Now, what we know of the <HI>mordern Iroquois,</HI> Dr. B. on the Foundation of <HI>Analogy,</HI> applies to the <HI>old Pelasgi:</HI> He attempts
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
to prove by an easy Chain of Reasoning, that in Case of a supposed Civilization of <HI>Iroquois,</HI> such Consequences might naturally be expected to arise, as did actually arise in <HI>antient Greece;</HI> and <HI>viceversa,</HI> that as the <HI>old Pelasgi</HI> were once in the same State as the <HI>Iroquois</HI> are now, they actually did proceed by the same Steps as these would probably do upon a similar Civilization. The Argument is new I confess, but is not therefore to be treated with Contempt. If the Principles on which all Savage Tribes proceed are <HI>always</HI> simple, and nearly the same in all, making only some small Allowance for the Difference of Soil, and Cli∣mate: If the Similarity of Causes and Effects be too clear and convincing to be denied; in a Word if, even where Variations of Character arise, they serve rather to illustrate than confound the Sub∣ject, certainly any Conclusions properly drawn from so amazing an Analogy, must fall little short of Demonstration.—The Method then of Argu∣mentation no rational Man can object to; let us therefore see whether Dr. B—has sustained it properly in those Parts which regard ancient Greece.</P>
<P>You begin with a very material Point, which if once made out would overthrow Dr. B—'s Hypothesis from the Foundation. You tell us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is taken for granted all along, that the Poetry and Music, and Legislation, and Religion of Greece, were entirely the spontaneous Productions of that Climate"</Q> but that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is certain, the first Seeds
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
of them were imported <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>."</Q>You then appeal to ancient Authors, and affirm (from them) that Dr. B's System <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cannot hold, since their <HI>first Civilizers</HI> did certainly introduce <HI>foreign Gods,</HI> and <HI>were not the Object of Worship themselves</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 5.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To prove that it was otherwise, you cite <HI>Hero∣dotus;</HI> and you say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he assures us that the Pe∣lasgi had no more than some general Notion of <HI>a superior Power</HI> who <HI>made</HI> the World <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>."</Q> Now, how can <HI>You,</HI> whose Work professes to be built on the Pillar of <HI>strict Quotation,</HI> how can <HI>You</HI> begin with so egregious an Untruth? In your Translation you have represented the PE∣LASGI <HI>(Acorn-Eaters</HI> and <HI>Man-Eaters)</HI> as <HI>pure Theists;</HI> and it seems it was <HI>Orpheus</HI> who <HI>after∣wards</HI> debased them into gross <HI>Idolaters</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Euterpe, l. 52.</NOTE>. Now <HI>Herodotus</HI> says nothing of all this. He men∣tions not <HI>a superior Power;</HI> but expressly says <HI>Gods</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) nor does he speak one Word of their <HI>making,</HI> but only of their <HI>governing</HI> the World <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>. And is not this a palmary Argument in Proof of their having no Religion, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they <HI>worshiped</HI> the <HI>Gods,</HI> who in their Opinion <HI>governed the World?"</HI></Q>—Well: but it seems, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they knew no Name for any Divinity; the Names of their Gods were brought from Egypt; and if their Gods had been their own Chiefs, <HI>their</HI> Names would have been better remembered than
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
any Thing else <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>."</Q> Here, I confess with Pleasure, is some Appearance of good Reason∣ing.</P>
<P>But to set this Matter in its true Light; and acquaint you whence it probably came to pass, that the <HI>savage Pelasgi</HI> had no Names for their Gods, I must (in Imitation of Dr. B.) carry you once more among your new Acquaintances, the Savages of America.—You must know, then, that the savage Tribes seldom retain the <HI>particular Name</HI> of the <HI>Chieftain</HI> whom they <HI>deify</HI> and <HI>wor∣ship:</HI> and the Reason of this is, because he ge∣nerally <HI>loses</HI> it even <HI>before be dies.</HI> When he is exalted to the Rank of <HI>Chief,</HI> his former Name is commonly dropped, and a new Appellation is giv∣en him, suited to the Station he is raised to: This Title (rather than Name) is generally that of <HI>Father, Senior,</HI> or <HI>Sun</HI> of the Tribe. In Proof of this I might refer you to all the Writers on the Manners of savage Tribes: On this Subject, how∣ever, LAFITAU and the <HI>Lettres Edifiantes,</HI> will give you ample Satisfaction. Under this State of Things, the savage Tribes offer Sacrifice, consult Oracles, and perform the general Acts of a na∣tive Religion. This, then, seems to have been the idolatrous State of the old Pelasgi: They probably worshipped their first savage Chief∣tains; for it is clear, on the Evidence of <HI>Hero∣dotus</HI> himself, that they offered <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to their Gods, and <HI>consulted</HI> the <HI>Oracle</HI> of <HI>Dodona,</HI> whe∣ther
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
they should give the <HI>Egyptian Names</HI> to <HI>their own Deities</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herod. ib.</NOTE>: two Circumstances which prove even to Demonstration, that they had Deities be∣fore the Time of Orpheus.</P>
<P>You will say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what then did Orpheus intro∣duce, if he introduced not the Gods of Greece?"</Q> Why, Herodotus tells us, as plain as Words can tell us: He introduced <HI>Mysteries</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>): and that he might distinguish the native Gods whom he found already established by a general Wor∣ship, he appropriated particular Rites to each; and to this End, very properly distinguished each God by a particular Appellation, But sure, ne∣ver was Critic so unlucky in his Remarks as You: For it has been made appear by a learned Wri∣ter, that these <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, these very <HI>Mysteries</HI> which ORPHEUS introduced to Greece, were so far from being the <HI>Beginnings</HI> of <HI>Heroe Worship,</HI> that they were intended as a <HI>Detection</HI> (to the <HI>initiated)</HI> of the <HI>Errors</HI> of <HI>pre-established Polytheism</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Div. Leg. of Moses, B. ii. Sect. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the <HI>oldest Gods</HI> of Greece were strictly <HI>native:</HI> I shall now prove that they were the <HI>Chiefs</HI> and <HI>first Civilizers</HI> of the savage Inhabitants. That they were such, is evident from the Testimony of several ancient Authors, found∣ed on the Traditions of the Country, which are the only original Evidences that can be obtained in a Case of this Nature.—The first and chief of these was He, to whom <HI>Orpheus</HI> (it seems) gave
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
the Name of JUPITER. This old Chieftain was born in Crete: and was brought young by his Mother into Greece <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. x.</NOTE>. He conquered the <HI>Ti∣tans</HI> (probably another Tribe of Savages, at En∣mity with the <HI>Pelasgi)</HI> and civilized the Inhabi∣tants of the Country which he subdued <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Diodorus, l. iii.</NOTE>. Af∣ter he had vanquished the <HI>Titans,</HI> he is said by some Authors to have instituted the Olympian Games, in Commemoration of his Victory <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pausanias, l. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another of these most ancient Gods of Greece, to whom ORPHEUS gave the Name of APOLLO, was a Chief who killed the Serpent <HI>Python,</HI> and the Tyrant <HI>Titius;</HI> taught the Inhabitants of Greece the Use of the Fruits of the Earth, and civilized the Inhabitants of several Districts <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. ix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two more of these ancient Gods of Greece, were the famed Brothers, CASTOR and POLLUX. They were Natives of the little Isle of <HI>Pephnos</HI> near <HI>Messene</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Pausanias, l.</NOTE>; and taught the Lacedemonians the Arts of Dancing and of War <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Lucian. de Saltati∣one.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now these <HI>four</HI> are the very <HI>ancient Gods</HI> whom Dr. B. has singled out, as being delivered down to Posterity under the Characters of Musi∣cians, Singers, and Dancers. All of them Chiefs and Civilizers of ancient Greece, in some Depart∣ment or other of Legislation.</P>
<P>But he might have added several more. Of this Class was MERCURY. He was born in
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Greece <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Pausanias Arcad.</NOTE>; was the <HI>Inventor</HI> of the <HI>Lyre;</HI> and is said to have been deified for this Invention <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eliac.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another Deification I must not pass over: You have led me to it yourself: It is that of BAC∣CHUS; whose Love of Wine, Dance, and Music, is too well known to need a Comment. You speak of his Mysteries, as being not of Grecian but foreign Original; and thence you conclude, that the God himself was so. I need hardly bid you turn back to the preceding Pages, to put you in Mind how inconclusive this Argument is. The <HI>old Chieftain</HI> himself was a Civilizer of <HI>Greece,</HI> tho' his <HI>Mysteries</HI> (introduced by ORPHEUS) were <HI>Egyptian.</HI> You will demand a Proof of the God being a Civilizer of Greece. Take the following Account, then; which unfortunately contains as ample a Confutation of all you have advanced on this Subject, as any Heart can wish. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"PHILO∣NIDES informs us, that the Vine having been transplated from the Borders of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> by BACCHUS;—the Greeks, when the unmixed Wine is brought to Table at Sup∣per, invoke the good Genius or God, honouring (or worshipping) the Power who invented it: This God is BACCHUS <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Athen. Deip. l. xv.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Thus, your capital Objection to Dr. B's Sys∣tem seems absolutely untenable, and void of all Foundation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
3. You proceed, next, to object against his Account of the Origin of <HI>poetic Numbers</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 8, 9, 13, &amp;c.</NOTE> What you have advanced on this Subject, I shall only stile an Instance of your <HI>Power of Repre∣sentation.—</HI>You confound the Origin of <HI>Poetry</HI> with the Origin of <HI>mere Rythm;</HI> nor perhaps is it necessary that a mere Critic should know the Difference.—You represent Savages, in their lowest State of Nature, to have no Leisure for Amusement; when, if you will <HI>read,</HI> you will <HI>find,</HI> they have <HI>more</HI> Leisure than any <HI>civilized</HI> Nations:—You charge Dr. B. with representing them as going formally to Work, with an <HI>a-priori Notion</HI> of Harmony and Measure, to adapt their Words to Music; when in Reality he tells you from <HI>Lafitau,</HI> that they dance and sing, and join their Words to their Music as well as they can; and to this End, that they <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"even retrench and strike off some Syllables from their Words,"</Q>that they <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"may tally better with their Dance and Music; and hence the natural Origin of Rythm or Numbers"</Q>—You own that the Dance <HI>cannot be totally without Measure;</HI> and yet you deny its Tendency to produce a <HI>correspondent Measure</HI> in the <HI>annexed Words:—</HI>You say that violent Emotions of the Mind naturally produce harmonious Periods, yet though you are very angry through your whole Work, you never produce one harmonious Period.—Such
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
are the Materials of this Article, which I shall leave to the Reader's Contemplations.</P>
<P N="4">4. But you have not yet done with the old Dei∣ties of Greece: You say you remember a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pas∣sage of ARISTOTLE full in the Teeth of Dr. B's System: wherein it is observed, that "the Poets never represent Jupiter singing <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>."</Q>Truly, neither does Dr. B. for he only says (on the Authority of a very old Poet) that <Q REND="inline margQuotes"> <HI>"Jupiter</HI> danced."</Q> 'Tis a little hard upon the Father of Gods and Men, thus to tie him Hand and Foot because he wanted an <HI>Ear,</HI> or happened to be <HI>hoarse:</HI> and because he did not <HI>sing,</HI> that you won't let him <HI>dance</HI> neither. Good Sir, be a lit∣tle more ingenuous in your Application of ancient Authors.</P>
<P>But you affirm, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Arctinus mentions Ju∣piter's Dancing as a Thing <HI>unusual</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">lb.</NOTE>."</Q> Now, why did not you refer to the Passage in Athenaeus which you here allude to? Was it for Fear the Reader might consult it?—With some Trouble I have found it; and am sorry to say, I have detected you in what an illiberal Critic would call a downright Falsehood. The following is a literal Translation of the Passage. <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"Eumelus</HI> or <HI>Arctinus</HI> the Corinthian somewhere intro∣duces Jupiter dancing; saying, "Among them danced the Sire of Gods and Men <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deip. l. i.</NOTE>."</Q> Not a Syllable occurs here, on its being either an <HI>usual</HI> or <HI>unusual Thing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>But it seems, 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Character of the Poet should be ascertained whether serious or bur∣lesque, &amp;c. before any thing concerning the whole System of Grecian Religion be deter∣mined by one Quotation at Second-hand from him <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>."</Q>—You are a notable Logician.—But it happens, that the Proof of Dr. B's Sys∣tem does not depend upon this one Quotation: he has (in the Course of his Dissertation) given twenty more, which are generally corroborative of This.</P>
<P N="5">5. You next come to consider Dr. B's Account of the Origin of Poetic History: You charge Dr. B. with misquoting and misrepresenting the Author of the Life of Homer, in order to bring him to his own Purpose <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 15.</NOTE>. But in reality, all that Dr. B. has done, is to express that <HI>properly,</HI> which the Author of the Life of Homer had ex∣pressed <HI>improperly:</HI> Both their Expressions imply the same Thing. You farther charge Dr. B. in∣deed, with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"turning <HI>Spanish</HI> Works into <HI>Arabic</HI> ones <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>."</Q> Now these Spanish Fragments are indeed Arabic by Descent; and this is evidently Dr. B's Meaning. But You, I find, being igno∣rant of their Original, did not comprehend his Meaning.</P>
<P N="6">6. On the Subject of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ancient Laws being written in Verse,"</Q>you say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Actions of their Gods and Heroes were such as could not
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
be a Foundation for moral Exhortations to Imi∣tation <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>."</Q> Here, I suspect, that instead of putting <HI>yourself</HI> in the Place of the <HI>Savages,</HI> you have put the <HI>Savages</HI> in <HI>your Place.</HI> Certainly, to a <HI>modern Englishman,</HI> the Actions of their Gods and Heroes could never have seemed a worthy Model for Imitation: Yet to an ancient savage Greek (an Acorn-Eater, and a Man-Eater) they might very well pass for such. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Plunder and Revenge (as you observe <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 13.</NOTE>) being what the Savage chiefly values,"</Q> an Exhortation to this Purpose would naturally be included in the Song-Feast.—</P>
<P N="7">7. You say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would fain know why the Doctor should suppose the Practice of <HI>religious Dance</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> to have <HI>necessarily arisen</HI> from a <HI>false Religion,</HI> which, as he himself takes No∣tice, made a Part of the <HI>true</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P. 17.</NOTE>."</Q> But where has the Doctor asserted, that they <HI>necessa∣rily arose?</HI> That they <HI>naturally</HI> arose both among <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> he has made it very evident. Now, why should we have Recourse to a pedantic Principle of <HI>Imitation,</HI> void of Evi∣dence, for a Practice which manifestly arises from <HI>Nature?</HI> I expect, you will prove in your next Work, that all <HI>Pagans</HI> learnt of the <HI>Jews,</HI> how to beget Children, and eat their Victuals.</P>
<P N="8">8. You now come to the old poetic Oracles of GREECE: So far as the Affair of mere Reasoning
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
is concerned, I shall again leave you to the natu∣ral Penetration of the Reader. With Respect to the literary Part of the Argument, I at length give you Joy of a small Discovery: for you have detected Dr. B. in calling an ancient Priestess of Apollo by the Name of PHEMONOE instead of HEROPHILE. I wish you had been as successful in your next Attack.</P>
<P>For the main Point worth contending for an this Subject is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whether the ancient Pythian Oracles were the Effect of Enthusiasm."</Q> To prove that they were not, you bring a Story from Homer, who tells us of a wonderful Feat of APOLLO, who 1st changed himself into a Dol∣phin; 2dly, drove the Cretan Voyagers from their Course at Sea; 3dly, appeared to them (Qu. in his own Shape, or the Dolphin's?) and told them, they were to be his Sacrificers; 4thly, that the poor Fellows being hungry, he assured them, they need not fear for a Subsistence; for that he could foretel, they should live comfortably on the Sacrifices: on which, they believed him, and be∣came his Priests.—Now, on this curious and au∣thentic Trait of History, which you call <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>probable,</HI> you found the Rise of the Delphic Oracle. Believe your Creed who may, I shall not endeavour to shake his Faith: But in Respect to those who may think that any thing can possibly be fabulous which comes from that most <HI>scrupu∣lous</HI> and <HI>true Historian, Old</HI> HOMER, I can only set against him the weak Authority of that poe∣tical
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and lying Romancer, DIODORUS the <HI>Sicili∣an.</HI> Now this Author tells us, in the most express Terms, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Rise of this famed Oracle was from Enthusiasm: That the first Diviners being seized with this, began to prophecy, and were agitated with <HI>wild and frantic Gestures,</HI> which were so violent, that many of them leapt into the deep Cleft of the Earth, near the Place where now the Temple of Delphi stands: And that in Process of Time, the Diviner or Pythia, was <HI>confined</HI> to the <HI>Tripos,</HI> as the Means of <HI>pre∣venting</HI> the <HI>like</HI> fatal <HI>Consequences</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Diodorus, l. 16.</NOTE>."</Q> This whole Account confirms all that Dr. B. has ad∣vanced concerning the Origin of the old poetic Oracles of GREECE: it overturns all the Objec∣tions you have mustered on this Subject: And as to the illiberal Misrepresentations of Dr. B's Method of Reasoning, which close your Argu∣ment, I am quite ashamed of them, and might give you for Answer, a Maxim of your own; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a Buffoon always places Things in that Light which is most advantageous to his Satire <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 35.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. On the Subject of the Greek Melody, you say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you have little to object:"</Q> and for the same Reason, perhaps, I have nothing to object; and I fear the Reason is, because we do not un∣derstand it.—However, you are even with him in the next Paragraph; in which you prove your∣self
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
a greater Adept in Prosody, not only than Dr. B. but even than the learned <HI>Vossius</HI> himself: And here you have laid hold of a fair Opportu∣nity of exposing Dr. B. for <HI>another Man's Igno∣rance</HI> at least, if <HI>not</HI> for <HI>his own.</HI> On this im∣portant Head, therefore I will lay down a Brace of Maxims, built on your most ingenious Criti∣cism, which I defy him and all his Adherents to overturn. 1. That a Writer is answerable for any incidental Error of the Author whom he quotes, though it be not essential to his Subject. 2. That though the Author who <HI>made</HI> a trifling Mistake may be a Man of <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> yet he who <HI>passes</HI> it unnoticed <HI>must</HI> be an <HI>ignorant Blockhead.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. You own that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Power of the Greek Melody is justly attributed by Dr. B. to the <HI>Power of Association</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">P. 39.</NOTE>."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"But,"</HI></Q>—Ay, right or wrong, there must be a <HI>but—</HI><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But this is in Effect owning, that it is in a great Measure un∣accountable <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>."</Q> Let us see, now, how this Argument stands.—If we know that it is <HI>justly</HI> attributed to <HI>Association,</HI> then surely we know what <HI>Association</HI> means; and if so, then, I appre∣hend, it is clearly <HI>accounted for.—</HI>Had I not been tolerably acquainted with you before I arrived at this logical Paragraph, I should have wondered to hear a Man <HI>saying</HI> and <HI>unsaying</HI> the <HI>same</HI> thing
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
at a Breath.—Well; but we will pass over this as one of those Propositions you speak of, which are <HI>neither true</HI> nor <HI>false.</HI> We will suppose, that all you mean to assert is only what follows; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that their <HI>particular Associations</HI> being <HI>unknown,</HI> the <HI>particular</HI> Nature of their <HI>Melody</HI> (which arose from <HI>these Associations)</HI> must be <HI>unknown like∣wise:"</HI></Q>—This is a Proposition which has both Sense and Truth in it: <HI>But then,</HI> unluckily for you, it is the very thing that Dr. B. asserts: For he tells you, even again and again, that notwith∣standing all the Pretences of your whole critical Fraternity, we know nothing particular about the Matter.</P>
<P N="11">11. But now you hasten into the midst of things; and, to confess the Truth, take such Strides in Absurdity, that it requires some Pains to follow you.—Dr. B. says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Their Songs were of a legislative Cast, and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or History of their own Coun∣try, contained the essential Parts of their reli∣gious, political, and moral Systems."</Q>—This it seems you cannot <HI>digest;</HI> and yet, I fear, you will be compelled to <HI>swallow</HI> it.—</P>
<P>First, you acknowledge, that the Songs of <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Amphion</HI> were of this <HI>legislative Cast:</HI> that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they employed them to perswade the Savages to live together sociably, and with∣out injuring each other, and to worship the

As a full Proof, that this was the Fact in the Poems of the ancient Greeks, I need only refer to what Dr. B. has quoted from Plato <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Dissert. Sect. v. Art 12.</NOTE>. There it appears at large, that the Poems of their Bards were taught to their Children, as the <HI>Foundation</HI> both of their <HI>Opinions</HI> and their <HI>Manners.</HI> And the very Rea∣son is assigned by Plato <HI>why</HI> this Method of <HI>In∣struction</HI> was <HI>used,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Because the <HI>youthful</HI> Mind is <HI>not apt</HI> to attend to <HI>serious</HI> Study, therefore the <HI>pleasing Vebicle</HI> of <HI>Song</HI> is to be administered."</Q></P>
<P>But you urge further, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Bard's Profession was not of that Dignity, which Dr. B. ascribes to it;"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and as for his ranking the Bard next to <HI>Kings,</HI> I can quote him two Pas∣sages where he is ranked with <HI>Carpenters</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 29.</NOTE>."</Q>
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
—You might have saved yourself the Trouble: because Dr. B. himself has produced an Instance from another Country, <HI>(Ireland)</HI> where the Bards had thought proper to rank themselves with <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Dissert. p. 163.</NOTE>. Yet in this very Country, there had been a time, when they were ranked with <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Gods</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ib p. 161.</NOTE>. This shrewd Observa∣tion, therefore, arises only from your being un∣fairly carried off your Ground, and obliged to talk on a Subject you are not acquainted with: You suppose the Dignity of the Bard's Character to have been always <HI>stationary</HI> and <HI>the same,</HI> whereas indeed, it appears from Dr. B's Work, that it was generally <HI>fluctuating,</HI> according to the accidental Changes in Civilization, Arts, and Manners.</P>
<P>Again, you say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Had Homer's Work been <HI>legislative,</HI> his Business would have been to deliver a <HI>more perfect</HI> and <HI>improved</HI> System in each Kind <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">P. 29.</NOTE>."</Q> How do you know that?

<P><PB N="20" REF="21"/>
But now, after having granted, that Homer <HI>did not</HI> deliver a perfect and improved System of Doctrines, you proceed (like a profound Phi∣losopher) to prove that he <HI>did</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. 29, 30.</NOTE>. Your Argu∣mentation on this Head I shall leave to the na∣tural and common Sense of the Reader; only adding this Remark, that Homer's Fables were such a Picture of Life and Morals, as <HI>Plato</HI> (in a more refined Period) thought proper to banish from his Republic, lest they should <HI>de∣stroy all good Morals.—</HI>Dr. B. has particularized some of the Chief of them, which sufficiently justify <HI>Plato's</HI> Censure <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Differt. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>You next proceed to <HI>Pindar:</HI> and here, when I found you allowed that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the poetic Songs <HI>must</HI> abound with Reflections on what was laudable, or the contrary; and with Pictures and Recom∣mendations of what that Age and Nation re∣puted <HI>Virtue;"</HI></Q>and also that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fables built on the current Traditions, at once struck the Imagination, soothed the Vanity, and excited the awful Respect of the Hearers <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 32.</NOTE>:"</Q> Now, said I, we are happily agreed: But see the Vanity of human Hopes! In the very next Line we are all broke to Pieces. For it seems <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pin∣dar's intermixed Fables were so far from being

necessary to his Odes, that in his first Ode he wrote without mixing Fables at all, until an elder and more experienced Artist, <HI>Corinna,</HI> told him how <HI>necessary they were</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>."</Q>—I durst hold an even Wager, that this same <HI>Corinna</HI> was a sensible old Woman: You see, she was instruct∣ing a young Greek Divine in the Art of Preach∣ing: You tell us too, that <Q REND="inline">"he followed her Advice."</Q> Marry, and with good Reason: for it appears, from Dr. B's Dissertation, as well as Corinna's Advice, that Fables were regarded as an essential Part of the Performance <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dissert. p. 83, 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Your subsequent Remark is a downright Tri∣umph. For here you prove irrefragably, that Dr. B. has called Pindar's Chair, a Chair of <HI>Gold;</HI> when in Reality, it was only a Chair of <HI>Iron.</HI> This is the second Error you have luckily hit; by which you have more than made good the ancient Proverb, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"once a blind Man killed a Batt."</Q> I cannot conceive how Dr. B. will bring himself off here; unless he should perversely affirm, that he speaks metapho∣rically; and calls Pindar's a Chair of <HI>Gold,</HI> in the same Manner, as if he were to speak of the Chair in which certain modern Critics sit and write, he would call it a Chair of <HI>Lead.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23"/>You go on: 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The three Greek Tragedians, says the Doctor, are the last of this illustrious Catalogue of legislative Bards."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wo is me!"</Q>—For <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the most private Conversations I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve had, they never gave me a Hint of their being Legislators, or legislative Writers <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 33, 34.</NOTE>."</Q> No Wonder they never whispered the Secret to You, who seem only to have been counting your Fingers, and scanning Verses.

You remember what grave Creature it was that formerly <HI>carried the Mysteries,</HI> and yet was <HI>never the wiser:</HI> But I make no ill-natured Applications.</P>
<P>But Solon (you say) does not seem to have <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had that high Idea of <HI>the tragic Writers,</HI> as <HI>use∣ful Servants of the State</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>."</Q> What Tragic Writers?

this set down to the Account of your <HI>Learning</HI> or your <HI>Modesty.—</HI> But <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Plutarch informs us, that he expressed a great Dislike of their Art, in the Practice of Thespis <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 34.</NOTE>."</Q> True; he did so: And you tell us yourself, in another Place, what it was that Solon disliked: It was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the <HI>new Circumstance</HI> of <HI>dramatic Representation</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P. 47.</NOTE>."</Q> But this was not the Place for you to bring that Circumstance into View; because it would have unmasked your Battery. Solon was alarmed at a a Change in their poetic and musical Contests, which hitherto had maintained their <HI>simpler Form;</HI> and it was probably his high Idea of their <HI>pre∣established Utility,</HI> which induced him so severe∣ly to censure this <HI>Innovation.</HI> Thus, in the End, this Affair of Solon and Thespis tends to con∣firm Dr. B's Opinion, rather than to confute it.</P>
<P>But now you suddenly come round, and become quite good-humoured; nay you are willing to lend Dr. B. a Lift; and produce a Passage which tends to the Confirmation of his System <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P. 34, 35.</NOTE>: For you tell us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Euripides himself is introduced, affirming that the Reason why Poets are to be honoured is for their <HI>Ingenuity, salutary Admo∣nitions,</HI> and <HI>bettering</HI> their Fellow-Citizens."</Q> This is a Method of Confutation altogether new, and very ingenious: To confirm an Adversary's System by Proofs which he himself was ig∣norant
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
of; and thus to demonstrate your Su∣periority.</P>
<P>And now to close this Article in your own Manner, I will also produce some additional Evi∣denees in Favour of Dr. B's System; and then I think we shall have <HI>humbled</HI> him sufficiently between us.</P>
<P>The Doctor must know then (for to be sure if he <HI>had known</HI> it, he would have <HI>said</HI> it) that in the ancient Times of Greece, there was no other <HI>Code,</HI> either <HI>religious, moral,</HI> or <HI>political,</HI> but the Songs of their Bards. If there was even one let Dr. B. produce it at his Peril. These Songs or Poems, then, were indeed the great <HI>Re∣pository</HI> of their <HI>Principles:</HI> having no <HI>real Reve∣lation</HI> or <HI>Guide</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> they took up with the <HI>best they could find;</HI> and hence laid hold of the <HI>Examples</HI> of their fabulous <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Heroes,</HI> as the Means of <HI>fixing</HI> the <HI>fluctuating Principles</HI> of their refpective Societies by a certain <HI>Stan∣dard,</HI> however <HI>defective.</HI> These Songs, there∣fore, may, on this Foundation, be properly stiled <HI>legislative,</HI> because they actually stood in the Place of <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>In farther Proof of this, I will give Dr. B. two or three Authorities. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hesiod and Homer (says Herodotus) were they who formed a Theogony for the Greeks, giving Names to their Gods, and fixing their Shapes or Figures <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Herod. Euterpe.</NOTE>."</Q>As a
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
Consequence of this, a respectable Modern tells us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Writings of Homer became the <HI>Standard</HI> of <HI>private Belief,</HI> and the <HI>grand Di∣rectory</HI> of <HI>public Worship</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Life of Homer, p. 174.</NOTE>."</Q>—Another learn∣ed Modern expresses himself in still stronger Terms. For speaking of the ancient Greeks, he affirms that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Homer was their <HI>Bible:</HI> and what∣soever was not <HI>read therein,</HI> nor could be ex∣pressly <HI>proved thereby,</HI> passed with them for <HI>apo∣cryphal</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Div. Leg. of Moses, Vol. ii. Part i. p. 52.</NOTE>."</Q>Again, He calls Homer and He∣siod <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the popular and only <HI>authorized Books of Divinity</HI> amongst the Greeks; which assign the <HI>Names,</HI> the <HI>Attributes,</HI> and the <HI>Form,</HI> to each God <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ib. P. 259.</NOTE>."</Q> How it happened, that these Fables which were swallowed in Times of Ignorance, came to be established in a more knowing Age, this learned Person likewise inform us. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The great Poets of Greece, who had <HI>most contributed</HI> to <HI>refine</HI> the <HI>public Taste</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> and were now grown into a Kind of <HI>sacred Autho∣rity,</HI> had <HI>sanctified</HI> these silly Tales in their Writings, which Time had now consigned to Immortality <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">lb. Vol. i. Part ii. P. 303.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Now all these Authorities, every one of them tending to confirm his System, Dr. B. hath igno∣rantly omitted; and (with <HI>an a-priori Notion,</HI> as
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
you elegantly stile it) has pretended to be <HI>wiser</HI> than his Neighbours, and gone about to prove with the most consummate Arrogance that it <HI>must</HI> be so; and that from the <HI>natural Progression</HI> of <HI>sa∣vage</HI> Manners, it <HI>could not</HI> be <HI>otherwise.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus sufficiently humbled Dr. B. by bringing Arguments in his Favour which he knew nothing of; we will now take Leave of this Ar∣ticle, and proceed to Number</P>
<P N="12">12. You preface your Criticisms on this Article, by stiling them <Q REND="inline">"loose Observations <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P. 35.</NOTE>;"</Q>which we must take without much <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Order, for you have not Time enough to methodize them."</Q>—And yet you have been a whole Year in throwing up your Crudities.</P>
<P>Your first loose Observation on the 12th Article is this; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that although the Greeks regarded Music as a necessary Part of a liberal Educa∣tion, yet this only implies that it was an Accom∣plishment parallel to <HI>Dancing</HI> in present Times:"</Q> and in Proof of this, you add, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one (modern) Author intitles his Book on the Subject, <HI>the Rudiments of genteel Education</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 35, 36.</NOTE>."</Q> I could have furnished you with an Instance still more to your Purpose, of a Dancing Master who writ a Treatise to prove, that all the Vices of the present Age are owing to the <HI>Neglect</HI> of <HI>Dancing.</HI> —You go on: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Even the abstracted Locke and
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Rousseau insist on it, in their Treatises on Edu∣cation.—May we not then conjecture, the Cases were in some Measure alike <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>?"</Q> Truly, we might conjecture as we pleased, if the clear Evi∣dence of Antiquity was not against us. But <HI>un∣luckily</HI> again, Dr. B. has proved from various an∣cient Authors, that their Poems were the <HI>Bible</HI> of ancient Greece: that these Poems were <HI>sung,</HI> both in <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private;</HI> and not only so, but that their Children were taught to sing them to the Lyre, as the very first Foundation of a virtuous Education <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Dissert.

Sect. v. Art. 12. p. 86, &amp;c.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Well: But <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Plato gives Notice, that when he speaks of Music, he includes the Subject, Words, or Song; and by the Passage quoted from the Alcibiades it appears, that this was not the popular Sense <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE>."</Q> Very true, but very consistent with, nay corroborative of, all that Dr. B. has said. He has observed, that in the Time of Plato, the <HI>Separation</HI> of Poetry and
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Music had <HI>commenced:</HI> Therefore it was proper and natural in Plato, to explain himself <HI>particular∣ly,</HI> whenever he writ on this Subject; and to in∣form his Readers that he spoke of Music in the <HI>ancient</HI> Sense, and not in the <HI>new.</HI> In his Alcibi∣ades too, he writ altogether according to Charac∣ter: For it was natural for Alcibiades (a young Debauche) to adopt the <HI>new</HI> Sense, and for So∣crates to put him in Mind of the <HI>old.</HI></P>
<P>You next charge Dr. B. with writing in that Stile which <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is neither true nor false, because he has not precisely fixed the Point which separates what he calls the <HI>early</HI> from the <HI>late</HI> Periods of Antiquity, with regard to the Use of Music merely instrumental <HI>(y)."</HI></Q> In this Point you not a little resemble an honest Lawyer at the Bar, who was examining a Witness to a Fact: The Witness said, it happened between Nine and Ten in the Morning. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Was it at five Minutes, or ten Minutes, or a Quarter, or Half, or three Quarters after Nine?"</Q> said the honest Lawyer. The Witness declaring he could not fix it to a few Minutes, the Man of Logic turned about to the Jury, and said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now Gentlemen, I hope you are convinced that the Fellow talks in a Stile that is neither true nor false, and that he knows nothing of the Matter."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>But it seems, you have at length discovered a Passage, 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where Dr. B. speaks of a particular Pe∣riod as an early one, in which I will prove that a Separation had taken Place. In a Passage from Strabo, he speaks of something done after the Crissaean War, as done in ancient Times <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>."</Q> Dr. B. says no such Thing: Pray, exa∣mine his Book once again: He says exactly what Strabo says: but <HI>unluckily,</HI> you understand neither Dr. B. nor Strabo. That Author says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in ancient Times, there was a Contest of Musici∣ans:"</Q>and then he tells us farther <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>this</HI> was <HI>established</HI> at Delphi, after the Crissaean War."</Q> This Dr. B. translates literally from Strabo <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Dissert. p. 107.</NOTE>, who manifestly speaks of two distinct Periods; but the first of these happening to lie beyond the Depth of your chronological Plum∣met, you have learnedly jumbled them into one. The ancient Times that Dr. B. (after Strabo) speaks of here, were the Times of Apollo, and his immediate Followers.—But of this you will hear more in due Time.</P>
<P>However, an early Period you are resolved to find, though it make never so much against you. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If this should not satisfy the Doctor; Pausanias, in his History of the Pythian Contentions, will tell him of one Eleutheres, whom he mentions before Hesiod, that gained the Prize for <HI>mere</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
<HI>Execution,</HI> singing a Composition <HI>not his own.</HI> He will tell him likewise, that Hesiod did not play on the Harp; so that there was a Sepa∣ration of the Poet's and Musician's Character very early <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 39.</NOTE>."</Q>—Certain Stars there are, which ray out <HI>Light;</HI> and others I have read of in a pro∣found Author, which are said to ray out <HI>Dark∣ness.</HI> Of this latter Kind is the Paragraph before us, which in this Sense may be stiled of the <HI>first Magnitude.</HI> It requires no common Genius for Absurdity, to crowd so much of it into so small a Compass, as you have put into this short Para∣graph. The Point in Question is, whether at this early Period, there was an <HI>allowed Separation</HI> of <HI>vocal</HI> and <HI>instrumental</HI> Music, in the public Con∣tests? Dr. B. affirms there was not; and You bring this Passage to prove that there was. Now whoever will look into Pausanias, will find from this very Passage, 1st, that Eleutheres, because he <HI>could join</HI> the <HI>vocal</HI> with <HI>instrumental</HI> Music, was allowed to <HI>sing</HI> the Composition of <HI>another;</HI> and Hesiod, because <HI>he could not join them,</HI> was not allowed to <HI>sing his own</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pausanias, Phoc.</NOTE>. His not being able to join the <HI>vocal</HI> and <HI>instrumental</HI> Melody was regarded as such a Defect in this Poet, as all his eminent Talents could not make up for. Thus the very Passage which you bring in Confutation of Dr. B's System, when <HI>fairly</HI> and <HI>honestly</HI> given
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
to the Reader, is a collateral Proof of the Truth of all he has said on the Subject.</P>
<P>These Cavils arise manifestly from your <HI>Power of Representation.</HI> The next, to give You your <HI>Due,</HI> is chiefly the Effect of pure Ignorance. This relates to the second Instance which Dr. B. has alledged, concerning the Power of ancient Music: On this You observe, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Instru∣ment in Question was the <HI>Flute,</HI> both Quintili∣an and Iamblicus agree: and how the most able Musician could <HI>play</HI> on this Instrument and <HI>sing too,</HI> I do not well conceive, except it could be proved, that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was that truly respec∣table and ancient Instrument the Scottish Bag∣pipe <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 41.</NOTE>."</Q> Right sorry I am, to lie under a Ne∣cessity of exposing the <HI>Errors</HI> of a <HI>learned Critic,</HI> who piques himself on a Familiarity with all an∣cient Authors.—Now, that the Instrument was the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Tibia,</HI> these Authors do both agree. But did they agree to give <HI>you</HI> Leave to <HI>translate</HI> or <HI>transform</HI> it into a <HI>Flute?</HI> A <HI>Pipe,</HI> if you please: But the Name and Fashion of a <HI>Flute</HI> are so <HI>con∣nected</HI> in the Idea of a Modern, that by this Trans∣ition you carry your Cause at once, even before your Argument comes on. Every <HI>Flute</HI> is indeed a <HI>Pipe;</HI> but every <HI>Pipe</HI> is not a <HI>Flute.</HI> And here lies the whole Mystery of the Matter. For in the first Place, you will see, from the Passage
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
you have quoted from Pausanias, that Echem∣brotus gained the Prize at the Pythian Games for <HI>singing and playing on the Pipe;</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There was the Song to the Harp, as formerly; there was the <HI>Song to the Pipe;</HI> and there was the Pipe itself, without Song.

In their Contention, they are represented as accom∣panying their Song with the Pipe; and to pre∣pare us for this Union, we are told in the Open∣ing of the Pastoral, that they were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"both skilled in playing on the Pipe, both skilled in sing∣ing."</Q>—In <HI>Virgil's</HI> Eclogues, this Union of the Shepherd's Pipe and Song is no less clearly al∣luded to.

17. Your next Attack on Dr. B. is upon the Subject of the <HI>hymnal</HI> or <HI>lyric</HI> Species: And here you charge him with confounding two Things together, which were essentially different: You affirm, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the <HI>Hymn</HI> was always written in <HI>heroic Measure,</HI> and was the more ancient Form of the two; that the <HI>lyric Ode</HI> was always written in <HI>varied Measures,</HI> and was much later in its Production, being no older than the Age of Thespis <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">P. 42, 43, 44.</NOTE>."</Q> You are so confident of the Propriety and Truth of this Distinction, that you insult Dr. B. on his Ignorance; and boast, that by this Argument alone you have cut and torn his Cobweb Hypothesis <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">P. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of all the Men of Criticism I ever read, You, my Friend, are the most unfortunate. Had you been as well acquainted with ancient Authors as you are with your Prosody, you would not have given Dr. B. such an Oportunity of exposing your Ignor∣ance. I will prevent your having the Mortifica∣tion of being severely chastised; and will lay on the Rod as gently as I can, by referring you to a Passage in Dr. B's <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"History of the Rise and Pro∣gress of Poetry,"</Q> which I have now lying be∣fore me: It is a Quotation from <HI>Proclus;</HI> in which that Author tells us, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the <HI>Pythian No∣mos,</HI> or <HI>Hymn</HI> in Praise of <HI>Apollo, Terpander</HI> (who lived after the Age of <HI>Homer)</HI> was the first who used the <HI>hexameter</HI> or <HI>heroic</HI> Verse; and that
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
after Him, <HI>Phrynes</HI> joined <HI>This</HI> to the <HI>various</HI> or <HI>lyric Measure,</HI> which alone had been employ∣ed before <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Terpandrum vero Nomon absolvisse apparet; <HI>cum ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibuisset heroicum Carmen:—</HI>Phrynes vero novam Rationem commentus est: Hexametrum enim cum soluto Carmine con∣janxit. <HI>Proclus apud Photium.—</HI>See the Passage quoted at large below, p. 47, 48.</NOTE>"</Q> Here, then, it appears, that both (what you call) the <HI>hymnal</HI> and the <HI>lyric Measure</HI> were actually <HI>employed together,</HI> and this, many Ages before Thespis existed. It appears farther, to the total Annihilation of all your cri∣tical Pretensions, that the <HI>various</HI> or <HI>lyric Measure</HI> (<Q REND="inline">"solutum Carmen"</Q>) was the more ancient of the two, in this <HI>Pythian Hymn</HI> or <HI>Song:</HI> so far from being the the Invention of the Age of <HI>Thespis,</HI> it was from the earliest Times employed in the <HI>Pythian Song,</HI> even as far back as the Times of <HI>Apollo.</HI> Indeed, it had been very strange, had it been otherwise. That <HI>regular Hexameters</HI> should have been <HI>invented</HI> before <HI>irregular Rythms</HI> were <HI>used,</HI> could never have been supposed by any one whose Researches had gone beyond his <HI>Prosody:</HI> But <HI>there</HI> the <HI>Hexameter</HI> standing <HI>first</HI> in <HI>Rank,</HI> it was natural enough for a mere <HI>Scanner</HI> of <HI>Verses</HI> to imagine it was the <HI>first</HI> in the Order of <HI>Nature.</HI> But how consistent you are with yourself in ano∣ther Place, I leave Yourself to determine. You have told us before, that in the rudest Periods of Society, the Passions of Men naturally produce a <HI>loose</HI> Kind of <HI>Verse</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE> (the <HI>solutum Carmen);</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
now, towards your Conclusion, you tell us that the <HI>loose</HI> Kind of <HI>Verse</HI> (the <HI>solutum Carmen)</HI> had no Existence till about the Time of <HI>Thespis,</HI> and that the <HI>regular Hexameter</HI> existed long before it. You might as reasonably affirm, that Savages built <HI>Palaces,</HI> before <HI>Caves</HI> and <HI>Cabins</HI> had Exist∣ence."</P>
<P N="19">19. You next proceed to deliver <HI>Your</HI> Senti∣ments concerning the Rise and Progress of Tra∣gedy: But as you confess that it is no more than <Q REND="inline">"what every School Boys knows <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 45.</NOTE>,"</Q> I shall save myself the Trouble of commenting on it; This being indeed the vulgar Track of Criticism, which Dr. B. has set himself to expose, through the Course of his Work. As therefore you offer no new Evidences, but only retail the old ones, <Q REND="inline">"which every School Boy knows,"</Q> I shall leave this Part of your Observations to shift for itself; with this general Remark, which Truth compels me to make, that the Inconsistency and Disagreement of the several ancient Writers which you quote on this Subject is so glaring; that in Fact they overturn each other's Authority, and would induce any unprejudiced Man to go in Quest of some more general and rational Foun∣dation for the Rise of Tragedy, than the mere ac∣cidental Adventure of Thespis and his Route: And this, I perceive, is one of the main Purposes
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
of Dr. B's Inquiry; with which, if you please, we will therefore go on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To this (you say) I have a few Objections to urge.—1st, I would fain know, if this be the natural Origin of Tragedy, how it came to pass that in all Nations, except Greece, the more pathetic Drama is without a Chorus at all <HI>(r)."</HI></Q> Critic, be a little more cautious in your Asserti∣ons. In three other Instances, where Tragedy has arisen from Nature, among the <HI>Chinese,</HI> pro∣per <HI>Indians,</HI> and <HI>Peruvians,</HI> Dr. B. has shewn, that in the first there is a manifest Remnant of a Choir, in the second a Choir actually exists, and in the third (that of <HI>Peru)</HI> we know not whether there was a Choir or not <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Disiert. p. 166, &amp;c.</NOTE>. So far is it from the Truth, what you assert, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in all Nati∣ons, except Greece, the more pathetic Drama is without a Chorus."</Q></P>
<P>Again, you object, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the Rise and Progress of Tragedy be so extremely natural, since <HI>every Thing</HI> that is <HI>natural</HI> is <HI>universal,</HI> how came this Species of Poetry to arise, or be cultivat∣ed in Athens only, which that it was we have Plato's Word <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">P. 48.</NOTE>?"</Q>—My Remarks on this Observation are—1st, Every thing that is <HI>natu∣ral</HI> is not <HI>universal,</HI> because there are different Degrees of Civilization and Knowledge among Mankind, which are attended with Accidents or Improvements <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>natural</HI> to <HI>each,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
but <HI>not universal</HI> or <HI>natural</HI> to <HI>all.—</HI>2. Dramatic Representation was not cultivated at Athens only: It has been cultivated in <HI>China,</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> and <HI>Peru:</HI> though <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we have not <HI>Plato's</HI> Word for it."</Q>—3. The Degree of Civilization, and the concomitant Powers of the Mind, may be so weak among many Nations, as never to produce the dramatic Form, which was the Case among some of the Tribes of ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> as likewise of ancient <HI>Gaul, Britain,</HI> and other Countries.—4. The Progress of Poetry, up to the drama∣tic Form, may be checked by a Variety of Acci∣dents either <HI>internal</HI> or <HI>external.</HI> By Accidents <HI>internal,</HI> as among the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> where the first rude Forms of Poem and Melody were establish∣ed by Law, which prevented all <HI>Change;</HI> that is, either <HI>Improvement</HI> or <HI>Corruption.</HI> And again, as among the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> where the Purity of Re∣ligion prevented their Poetry from assuming the dramatic Form.—By Accidents <HI>external;</HI> as where War, Conquest, a Subversion of Religion or Go∣vernment destroyed that original System of Pa∣gan Principles on which natural Tragedy is built: And if, by any of these, the original Form of Tragedy was once changed, it could not proba∣bly be renewed, by the mere Force of Nature.—I have been the more particular on this Article, because the Objection, though ignorantly made by You, gave Room for a farther Opening of the main Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41"/>But 3dly, you object, that 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"unfortunately it is declared as fully as any thing can or need be, that the <HI>ancient</HI> Tragedy consisted of a <HI>Chorus alone,</HI> and without an Actor <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">P. 48.</NOTE>."</Q>—I suppose you mean it was so at <HI>Athens;</HI> but does it therefore follow that it wore the same Form every where else? Dr. B. has prov∣ed (in a Passage which must soon rise up in Judgment against you) that even in the <HI>earliest</HI> Celebration of the <HI>Pythian</HI> Games at <HI>Delphi,</HI> there was a <HI>narrative</HI> (if not a <HI>dramatic) Episode,</HI> divided into <HI>five Acts:</HI> From this Passage it far∣ther appears that long before the Time of <HI>Thes∣pis,</HI> or even of <HI>Homer,</HI> this Episode was perform∣ed by a <HI>single Person,</HI> and not by the <HI>Choir</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See Hist. of Poetry, p. 110, &amp;c. The Passage is quoted below, p. 30, 31.</NOTE>. Now if this existed at <HI>Delphi,</HI> even <HI>soon after</HI> the <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Apollo,</HI> what is it to the Purpose to say that it did not exist at <HI>Athens?</HI> Dr. B. is investi∣gating the Rise of Tragedy from Nature and finds its first rude Form existing <HI>at Delphi,</HI> in or about <HI>the Time of Apollo:</HI> and to disprove This, <HI>you</HI> most philosophically endeavour to make it out, that it did not appear <HI>at Athens</HI> till <HI>many Ages after.</HI> This is another of your new Modes of Confutation.</P>
<P>Your 4th Objection is as follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It will likewise follow from the Doctor's System, that the Choral Part would be of Course, only an Appendage to the Episode; and the Chorus
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
would be but a supposed Spectator of the Ac∣tion, or a subordinate Personagein it: But that the contrary does happen in striking In∣stances, is well known to those, whose Ideas of Greek Tragedy are taken from Eschylus, Eu∣ripides, and Sophocles; not merely from Dis∣sertations, Bibliotheca's, and Institutiones Poe∣ticae <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. 49.</NOTE>."</Q>—Again:— <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Chorus, in several ancient Tragedies, are themselves principal Per∣sonages, and deeply interested:—in two, Eu∣menides and Iketides, they are the leading Per∣sonages, &amp;c.</Q> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 49.</NOTE>.—In Reply to this, I shall give you the following Paragraph, from Dr. B's His∣tory of Poetry.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>"By thus tracing the tragic <HI>Choir</HI> to its true Foundation, the <HI>savage Song-Feast;</HI> we are now inabled to give a clear and easy Solution to a Difficulty which hath embarrassed all the Critics. It hath been held a Circumstance un∣accountable or absurd, that the <HI>Choir,</HI> in seve∣ral of the ancient <HI>Greek Tragedies,</HI> should be made <HI>privy</HI> to some of the most <HI>atrocious De∣signs,</HI> and yet should not <HI>reveal</HI> them, though its <HI>Character</HI> was confessedly <HI>moral.</HI> This in∣deed, on the common Supposition, that the <HI>Choir originally</HI> made an essential Part of the <HI>dramatic Persons,</HI> is a thorough Absurdity. But in Reality it appears in the <HI>savage Song-Feast,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
that they who <HI>recite</HI> or <HI>represent</HI> the <HI>Action,</HI> are a <HI>Body</HI> quite distinct from the <HI>Choir;</HI> and that the <HI>Choir,</HI> in its <HI>original</HI> State, is indeed the <HI>Audience</HI> who surround the <HI>Narrator</HI> or <HI>Actor,</HI> and <HI>answer</HI> him at every <HI>Pause,</HI> with Shouts of <HI>Triumph, Approbation,</HI> or <HI>Dislike.</HI> This being so, how could they (the <HI>Choir</HI> or <HI>Audience)</HI> pro∣perly <HI>reveal</HI> any secret Designs, either good or bad?—To whom should they <HI>reveal</HI> them? To each other?—This was needless, because they knew them already.—Must they, then, reveal them to the <HI>Actors</HI> of the Drama? This could only have confounded the Representation, and destroyed the Plot. It would have been pre∣cisely on a Level with the Practice of an honest Country Lad, who was present at the Represen∣tation of OTHELLO: When he foresaw, that IAGO's Treachery was likely to end tragically for poor DESDEMONA, he called aloud to OTHELLO, <HI>Sir, the Rascal lies: he stole the Handkerchief himself.—</HI>This naturally leads to the Elucidation of another Circumstance. In the Beginning of the Time of ESCHYLUS, the <HI>Choir</HI> consisted of no less than <HI>fifty</HI> Persons: Afterwards the Number was lessened to <HI>fifteen.</HI> How came it to pass, that in the more barba∣rous Periods the Number should be so much greater? Manifestly (on the Principles here given) because <HI>that</HI> rude Age bordered on the <HI>savage</HI> Times, when the <HI>whole Audience</HI> had
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
<HI>sympathized</HI> with the <HI>narrative Actor,</HI> and be∣came as <HI>one general Choir.</HI></P><P>"This Solution naturally clears up another Circumstance, which is unaccountable on the common System. If the <HI>Choir</HI> were <HI>originally</HI> a Part of the <HI>dramatic Actors,</HI> why were they placed in a <HI>Balcony</HI> or <HI>Gallery, separate</HI> from the <HI>Stage?</HI> No good Reason can be assigned. But if we suppose them to have been <HI>originally</HI> the <HI>Spectators</HI> of the <HI>Drama,</HI> we see they were in their <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>proper Situation.</HI></P><P>"But to this it may be objected, "that the <HI>Choir</HI> sometimes maintains a <HI>Dialogue</HI> with the <HI>Actor,</HI> in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedies; and ought there∣fore to be regarded as a <HI>dramatic Person."</HI>—To this (which hath been observed above) it is reply'd, that though the <HI>Choir</HI> sometimes <HI>speaks,</HI> yet this is only by its <HI>Leader,</HI> and then only <HI>occasionally,</HI> and from <HI>Necessity,</HI> to fill the <HI>Place of another Actor,</HI> when no more than one or two are upon the Stage. For this Reason ESCHYLUS uses the Expedient oftener than his Successors, because his dramatic Persons were <HI>fewer.</HI> But though the <HI>Choir</HI> sometimes speak by their <HI>Leader,</HI> yet they never take Part in the <HI>Action;</HI> as sufficiently appears by their not revealing the Secrets of it.</P><P>"It may be urged again, that in the <HI>Eume∣nides</HI> and <HI>Iketides</HI> of ESCHYLUS, the <HI>Choir</HI> is certainly to be considered as a <HI>dramatic Person,</HI> because they are indeed the <HI>chief Actors</HI> in
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
the Drama. True; they are so: but though this Objection looks formidable, yet on a deeper Consideration, the Bugbear will vanish—ESCHY∣LUS was desirous to represent an Action of <HI>fifty Furies,</HI> and another of <HI>fifty Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aids,</HI> at a Time when only <HI>two dramatic Persons</HI> were allow∣ed by Custom to come on the Stage together. What Expedient could he use? Why, surely, no other than That which we find he <HI>hath</HI> used: To throw these <HI>numerous Bodies</HI> into the Form of a Choir; and thus he gained them Admittance on the Stage.—To speak with Precision, therefore, we ought to say, that the Action of these two Tragedies passeth <HI>without a Choir,</HI> that is, without any supposed <HI>Specta∣tors</HI> who <HI>take no Part in it</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Poetry, p. 126, &amp;c.</NOTE>."</P></Q>
<P>I hope that in your <HI>next Edition,</HI> you will prove this strange Paragraph to be a Heap of Nonsense and Absurdity; or perswade the Reader by all Means (if you can) that Dr. B. picked it out of some Dissertation, Bibliotheca, or Institutio Poe∣tica.</P>
<P>I must now give you a gentle Rebuke, for rashly charging Dr. B. either with <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> for saying that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we are assured, on the Authority of other Writers, that a Report prevailed in Greece, that certain Poets had <HI>in ancient Times</HI> contended at the Tomb of <HI>The∣seus."</HI></Q>—This, you affirm, happened at a late Pe∣riod

(which late Period, by the Way, Dr. B. had mentioned in his Dissertation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 125.</NOTE>, when <HI>Sophocles</HI> won the Prize from <HI>Eschylus;</HI> and then you leave it to Dr. B's Choice, whether he will sub∣mit to the Charge of <HI>Ignorance</HI> or <HI>Dissimulation.</HI> Now I perceive, that in the History of Poetry, he has cleared himself of <HI>both</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="margQuotes">This (says Dr. B.) is asserted by SCA∣LIGER, in the clearest Terms; and is alledged by him as a Proof of the Existence of Tragedy, before the Age of THES∣PIS.

<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Thus, in this most ancient <HI>Pythian Song,</HI> as delivered down from the Times of APOLLO himself, and performed and augmented through the succeeding Periods of ancient GREECE; we have the very <HI>Substance</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> of a first rude Essay towards Tragedy, divided into <HI>five Acts,</HI> and compounded of <HI>poetic Narration, imitative Music, Dance,</HI> and <HI>Choral Song.—</HI>And it is worthy of singular Observation, that through this whole representative Scene, of APOLLO <HI>singing, dancing,</HI> and <HI>praising his own Exploits;</HI> the <HI>ancient Greek Historians</HI> transport us, as it were, into the Wilds of <HI>modern America;</HI> and present to us the <HI>genuine Picture</HI> of a <HI>savage Chieftain</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="margQuotes">"See the Description of the savage Song Feast, from LAFITAU.

<P><PB N="52" REF="53"/>
<Q REND="margQuotes">"It appears, therefore, that Tragedy had a much earlier and deeper Foundation in ancient GREECE, than the accidental Adventure of THESPIS and his Route: That it arose from <HI>Nature,</HI> and an unforced <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Progression</HI> of <HI>Melody, Dance,</HI> and poetic <HI>Song</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">History of Poetry, p. 109, &amp;c.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>You see here, that your whole critical Fabric is annihilated at a Blow. For 1st, it appears on the clearest Evidence, that this Pythian Song was performed <HI>in ancient Times;</HI> even as <HI>ancient</HI> as those of <HI>Apollo</HI> himself. 2dly, It appears, that when you charge Dr. B. with Ignorance, in sup∣posing the <HI>Crissaean</HI> War to have been before the Time of <HI>Homer;</HI> your Objection is unhappily founded on your own Ignorance, on your not un∣derstanding <HI>Strabo</HI> nor Dr. B. who both speak of two different Periods, which you have pro∣foundly jumbled into one. 3dly, It appears, that this musical Contest was not merely instrumental, but contained a <HI>mimetic Song,</HI> performed by a <HI>single Person,</HI> in <HI>Imitation</HI> of <HI>Apollo's</HI> Victory: and 4thly, we are at no Loss for the <HI>essential</HI> Parts of it; but know certainly that it contained a progressive Description of <HI>Apollo's Battle</HI> and <HI>Victory</HI> over the <HI>Python.</HI></P>
<P>And now, let me cordially advise you for the future to be less insolent in a State of imagined Security and Conquest; lest your own Expres∣sions

should be retorted upon you:—Thus,—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a few such Mistakes as Mr.—here pre∣sents you in a Bunch, would serve a Man of ordinary Genius to spread through a whole Book."</Q>—<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it not a fine Thing for a Man to set up for an Instructor of Mankind, who is ignorant of what his commonest Readers know <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 53.</NOTE>:"</Q>—And other modest Expressions, scattered through your Work, of the same Nature.</P>
<P N="20">20. The same <HI>Spirit</HI> still impels you to pro∣ceed: though I look upon you <HI>now,</HI> as little more than the <HI>Ghost</HI> of a <HI>departed Critic.—</HI>Dr. B. hav∣ing endeavoured to prove, by a Variety of Argu∣ments, that <HI>Eschylus</HI> was an <HI>original</HI> Writer, and not a mere <HI>Imitator</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> you say, you can oppose <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Testimony of <HI>Eschylus</HI> himself; of whom it was a common and well-known Saying, as <HI>Athenoeus</HI> tells us, that his Pieces were small Scraps or Morsels of the magnificent Entertain∣ment of <HI>Homer</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">P. 55.</NOTE>."</Q>—I could not but smile at your Simile of the <HI>Faggot-Binder;</HI> and thought you had got a small Advantage over Dr. B. till I looked into the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"History of Poetry, where I found the following Note.

it in that Sense only, to which a Comparison of their Writings leads us. And, as it appears that there is no Resemblance between them, either in the <HI>particular Subjects,</HI> or in the <HI>Manner</HI> of treating them; the only rational Interpretation that can be given, seems to be this "that the Subjects of his Tragedies were only small <HI>Mor∣sels</HI> or <HI>Fragments</HI> of the <HI>Grecian Story;</HI> whereas HOMER had given a <HI>general System</HI> of their fabulous History, both in a more <HI>extensive</HI> and a more <HI>connected</HI> Manner."</Q> </P>
<P N="22">22.

<P N="24">24. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Concerning his Comment on <HI>Aristotle's</HI> Definition of Tragedy (you add) I have more to say than You or I have, at present Time for <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>."</Q> My learned Friend, find a little Time if you can: I am satisfyed, that <HI>Your</HI> Comment will be a great Curiosity.</P>
<P N="25">25.

To satisfy Dr. B. in this Point, you must tell him what were the Subjects of all those <HI>fifteen Tragedians,</HI> who were prior to the Age of <HI>Thespis.</HI> Nay, I question whether he will be content with this
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
(for we have found him very exorbitant in his Claims) but will insist upon your telling him, what were the Subjects of all the oldest irregular savage Bards, who existed as early, or perhaps even more early, than <HI>Apollo</HI> himself. This will carry us, you see, up to the Period of savage Life, in which we must allow (I am afraid) that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the tallest and strongest Men are commonly se∣lected as Chiefs."</Q>—But then you will say, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Masque was the Invention of a later Age: even a later than <HI>Thespis</HI> himself."</Q>—In <HI>Attica, possibly</HI> it might be so. But though <HI>Eschylus</HI> is said by some, to have been the Inventor of the <HI>Masque,</HI> yet <HI>Aristotle</HI> fairly confesses that its <HI>Ori∣gin</HI> is absolutely <HI>unknown;</HI> and <HI>Clemens Alexan∣drinus</HI> affirms that it was in Use, even in the <HI>Times</HI> of <HI>Orpheus.</HI> These Circumstances are not a little favourable to Dr. B's System; and seem to imply, that dramatic Representation had existed in <HI>Greece,</HI> though not perhaps at <HI>Athens,</HI> even as long ago as the Age of <HI>Orpheus.</HI> And it is be∣yond all Doubt, that a very little before the Age of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> the Time was, when <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Savages elected the tallest and strongest Men for Chiefs."</Q></P>
<P N="26">26, &amp;c.—You now declare, you are tired with the Task of <Q REND="inline">"combating Chimeras <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. 56.</NOTE>."</Q> And truly, so am I.—We will therefore hasten to a
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
Conclusion as fast as possible. Some few scat∣tered Observations only now remain.</P>
<P>You charge Dr. B. with an Error in <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in∣sisting that the last Institution of the Pythian Games was no more than a Separation of the Gymnastic Exercises from the Musical; whereas the Words of Strabo, whom he quotes, are as clear as possible, that only the Musical sub∣sisted before, and that the Gymnastic and Equestrian were then added to them <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 57.</NOTE>."</Q> For Truth's and Decency's Sake, do not give Dr. B. so many repeated Occasions of calling your Sincerity in Question. Who would not believe, from the Tenor of this Passage, but that Dr. B. in his Quotation from <HI>Strabo,</HI> had some how or other disguised this Circumstance, of the Addition of the gymnastic and equestrian Exer∣cises? Yet, on looking into the Passage in Dr. B's Dissertation, I find it quoted in the <HI>very same Words.</HI> Indeed, the Doctor questions the strict <HI>Propriety</HI> of <HI>Strabo's</HI> saying <Q REND="inline">"that the <HI>gymnastic</HI> Exercises were <HI>added;"</HI> because he conceives they were there <HI>before,</HI> making a Part of the <HI>ancient Musical</HI> Exercises, under the Denomina∣tion of the <HI>Dance</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Diss. p. 121.</NOTE>."</Q> This he has attempted to prove by some very plausible Arguments, I must confess: not one of which <HI>you</HI> have <HI>dis∣proved.</HI> However, what you cannot <HI>disprove,</HI> you can <HI>misrepresent;</HI> which, with some Readers, may do as well.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>Again, you charge him with 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"interpreting as an Account of the Effect of Music on Manners, what Plato means only as an Illus∣tration of the ill Effects of a licentious demo∣cratic Spirit, &amp;c. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 57.</NOTE>."</Q> On the contrary, Dr. B. has made it appear, by Passages quoted from <HI>Plato</HI> himself, that <HI>Plato's</HI> Argument included <HI>both</HI> these Causes. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Diss. Sect. vi. Art. 31, 32, 33, 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another Censure is on <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his supposing that the Writings of <HI>Archilochus</HI> were banished from <HI>Sparta</HI> on Account of their <HI>sarcastic Turn,</HI> which was indeed on Account of their <HI>Obscenity</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 57.</NOTE>."</Q> As the Passage in Dr. B. is short, I will give it entire; that every one may judge for himself. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Spartans ordered the Writings of <HI>Archilochus</HI> to be banished from their City, because they thought the Perusal of them was <HI>dangerous</HI> to the <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Man∣ners</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Diss. Sect. vii. Art. 5.</NOTE>."</Q>In a correspondent Article, he ex∣plains himself still more particularly: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"because nothing could be more dangerous to a Common∣wealth established on <HI>Severity</HI> of <HI>Manners,</HI> than the <HI>unbounded Licentiousness</HI> of <HI>Sentiment</HI> and <HI>Speech,</HI> which this (the <HI>old)</HI> Comedy must <HI>tend</HI> to <HI>produce</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>."</Q>—Seriously I am at a Loss, how to express myself properly on this Occasion; and therefore shall briefly set down this, as an∣other Instance of <HI>your Modesty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
I shall now conclude all, with a most shining Proof of your being eminently possessed of this great Virtue. After very notably squabbling with Dr. B. about a dubious Passage in Xeno∣phon, and quarrelling him for not rendering it exactly as You would have him; you charge him with falsely translating the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the better to serve his Purpose: You affirm, that this Word does not imply <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"good</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> Men,"</Q> but <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"only the <HI>rich</HI> or <HI>powerful,</HI> the <HI>better Sort</HI> as we say <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 57.</NOTE>."</Q>—Now, my most ingenuous Friend, turn back to the 34th and 35th Pages of your own Work, and you will see a Gorgon's Head, which (if you are not totally melted into Modesty) will turn you into Stone. Here we find this very Word translated by your good Self, in that very Sense in which Dr. B. had translated it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Reason (say You) why Poets are to be honoured is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for their Admoni∣tions, and <HI>bettering</HI> their Fellow-Citizens."</Q>—Reader, <Q REND="inline">"you may stare:"</Q> but the Assertion lies open to broad Day Light in his 34th and 35th Pages.—<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"Wits</HI> have <HI>short</HI> Memories (says <HI>Pope)</HI> and <HI>Dunces none:"</HI></Q> But <HI>one Class</HI> of Men there is, who, all the World agree, either <HI>have,</HI> or <HI>ought to have</HI> GOOD MEMORIES.</P>
<P>Two or three other Paragraphs there are, on which I might very reasonably bestow a far∣ther
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
Panegyric: But this last contains so deli∣cate a Picture of your <HI>amiable Mind,</HI> and of the <HI>generous Motives</HI> that set you to work, to criticize Dr. B. that I am unwilling to draw off the Reader from the Contemplation of so <HI>sweet</HI> a Pourtrait.</P>
<P>Thus, through the Course of my Remarks, you see I have been very <HI>free,</HI> but very <HI>friendly.</HI> I cannot help congratulating you on your good For∣tune, in falling into the Hands of one who has made great Allowances for your Imperfections; and even passes over many inferior Blots, which a censorious Critic would have hit <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Of this Kind is a slight Mistake (p. 5.) in your saying the <Q REND="inline">"Oracle of <HI>Delphos,</HI> instead of the "Oracle of <HI>Delphos."</HI></Q> You may knock down your Adversary with your critical Dungfork, if you please: but who gave you Leave, without Provocation to break poor <HI>Priscian's</HI> Head? What would <HI>You</HI> say of Dr. B's Knowledge in Grammar, should he affirm that <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"Aristotelem</HI> was not so profound a Reasoner, nor <HI>Longinum</HI> so sublime a Critic as <HI>You?"</HI></Q>—Yet this he might have said with the same Propriety:—I mean, so far as Grammar is con∣cerned.</NOTE>. The more so, because you openly profess to treat Dr. B's <HI>Errors</HI> with <HI>Severity</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P. 55.</NOTE>; whereas mere <HI>Errors</HI> have ever been supposed to merit <HI>Indulgence.</HI> Add to this, that your Bitterness to a Man who has put his <HI>Name</HI> to his Work, while You <HI>conceal Yours,</HI> has (in the Opinion of some People) the Air of dishonest Cowardice, and what they will needs call <HI>stabbing in the Dark.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62"/>You conclude with a solemn Charge against Dr. B. of his being 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"flagrantly guilty of mis∣quoting Authors."</Q> I wish you had better main∣tained this heavy Charge: I am bold to say, that the Instances you have produced have turned out to the Confirmation of <HI>his</HI> System, and little to <HI>your</HI> Honour. Give me leave to put you in Mind of a Passage in a certain Book, which relates to a Man's pulling a <HI>Mote</HI> out of his <HI>Brother's</HI> Eye, while he sees not the <HI>Beam</HI> that is in his <HI>own.</HI></P>
<P>I will now conclude with a Hint of Advice to you; in which I am sure I shall <HI>deserve</HI> your Thanks, whether I <HI>obtain</HI> them or <HI>not.</HI> I mean only to exhort you for the future to stick to that Species of Criticism for which you are apparently qualified. In every Instance where you attack the larger Parts of Dr. B's System, my Regard to Truth obliges me to say, that you fail most miserably. But when you get hold of him upon a <HI>minute</HI> Article, you are sure to pinch him to the Bone. Thus on the <HI>wide</HI> Subject of the old <HI>Greek Religion,</HI> the <HI>Origin</HI> of <HI>poetic Num∣bers,</HI> the Genius of <HI>savage Manners,</HI> the <HI>Rise</HI> and <HI>Progressions</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI> consequent on these, with several other large and extensive Articles of Inquiry, you are totally off your Ground: But to make Amends for this small Defect, you are amply re∣venged by detecting him in the important Blunder
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
of calling <HI>Herophile</HI> by the Name of <HI>Phenomoë,</HI> stiling Pindar's Chair a Chair of <HI>Gold,</HI> when it was only of <HI>Iron:</HI> And in the painful and labori∣ous Article of <HI>Prosody</HI> or <HI>scanning Verses, Isaac Vossius</HI> himself is forced to yield to you.</P>
<P>Now, as you observe in the Beginning of your Work, <Q REND="inline">"Multi multa possunt, sed nemo omnia."</Q>—Nobody can have at once the <HI>microscopic</HI> and the <HI>telescopic</HI> Eye. Therefore, improve the Talent which Nature has given you: If you cannot <HI>see</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, cultivate that Kind of Vision which is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: that is, if you cannot comprehend <HI>large</HI> and <HI>distant</HI> Objects, apply yourself diligent∣ly to the <HI>near-at-hand</HI> or <HI>purblind</HI> Criticism.</P>
<P>With this Advice, I shall take my Leave of you; esteeming it a sufficient Waste of Time and Labour, thus for once to have <HI>un∣masqued</HI> the <HI>empty Parade</HI> of a trifling and disinge∣nuous Caviler.</P>
