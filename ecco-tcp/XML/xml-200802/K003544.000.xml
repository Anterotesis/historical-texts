<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following POEMS, wrote by THOMAS ELLWOOD, (which have lain dormant in <HI>Manuscript</HI> for many Years) being lately communica∣ted to me by a Friend, I thereupon gave them a serious Perusal; and observing the pious and religious Sentiments wherewith they abound, thought they were too good <HI>to be lost</HI>; especially as there is room to hope, the uncaptious and sincerely religious Youth of either Sex, may be benefit∣ted thereby.</P>

<L>Assist blest Pow'r whom I adore;</L>
<L>Breath on my Muse, and fill her Quill</L>
<L>With sacred Dews from <HI>Hermon-hill.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Momus</HI> be gone, fly all ye Vain,</L>
<L>Who the Wit of Poems place</L>
<L>In florid Strains, my Muse is plain;</L>
<L>Fine Cloth exceeds fantastick Lace</L>
<L>On Kersey set; I leave those Flights,</L>
<L>To such as Fiction most delights.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let them also avoid the Place,</L>
<L>Should there be of that scoffing Stock,</L>
<L>Who are so destitute of GRACE,</L>
<L>They at the SPIRIT's <HI>Infl'ence</HI> mock;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>To such my Muse no Pleasure brings,</L>
<L>Who scorn the Power by which she sings.</L>
</LG>

<L>But come all ye who TRUTH embrace,</L>
<L>Whose Souls do pure Religion love,</L>
<L>Who prize the Gift of sacred GRACE,</L>
<L>Whose Treasure lies in Realms above;</L>
<L>Nay all, that are not Foes, draw near,</L>
<L>And grant my Song a willing Ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In early Times, when Man was made,</L>
<L>Before the <HI>Priesthood</HI> was confin'd,</L>
<L>While TRUTH in <HI>Adam's</HI> Houshold stay'd,</L>
<L>And GOD ador'd by all Mankind;</L>
<L>No Form of Worship, that appears,</L>
<L>Had been prescrib'd for many Years.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While Men with GOD a Converse kept,</L>
<L>And on Him did devoutly wait,</L>
<L>He gracious, while they wak'd or slept,</L>
<L>Did so their Minds illuminate,</L>
<L>That they not only knew His Will,</L>
<L>But by His Aid could it fulfill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<L>Before the Flood, and after long,</L>
<L>The <HI>Patriarchs</HI> directed were,</L>
<L>Both when to warble out their Song,</L>
<L>And how to ope Heav'ns Gate by <HI>Pray'r</HI>;</L>
<L>Whatever Act the LORD requir'd,</L>
<L>Their Hearts He thereunto inspir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But after that, Heav'n did decree,</L>
<L>In special Love to <HI>Abraham,</HI></L>
<L>That his Posterity should be</L>
<L>Sacred to Him, and bear His Name;</L>
<L>A Worship asked at their hand,</L>
<L>Which did in <HI>Observations</HI> stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What must be <HI>offer'd, when</HI> and <HI>where,</HI></L>
<L>Each Part was carefully exprest;</L>
<L>The <HI>various Modes</HI> prescribed were</L>
<L>For <HI>sacrificing,</HI> and the rest;</L>

<L>Diff'rence 'twixt <HI>clean,</HI> and <HI>unclean Beasts,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This legal Worship, as it stood</L>
<L>In <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks,</HI> and <HI>carnal Rites,</HI></L>
<L>Were Types of that eternal Good,</L>
<L>To which the Gospel all invites;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>The longest Date that it could claim,</L>
<L>Was but till <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 10.</NOTE> REFORMATION came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When that auspicious Time drew nigh,</L>
<L>The Morning of that Day was come,</L>
<L>The WORD, descending from on high,</L>
<L>Took sinless Flesh in Virgin's Womb;</L>
<L>At whose blest Birth, Heaven's Host rejoice,</L>
<L>And pour their Hymns with raptur'd Voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHILOH, so oft foretold, thus come,</L>
<L>His Death the Temple-vail did rend,</L>
<L>And being of those Types the SUM,</L>

<L>'Twas meet the <HI>Servant</HI> should withdraw,</L>

<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 33. Ezek. xi. 19, 20.</NOTE> <HI>After those Days, I in the Heart</HI></L>

<L>In Types, but in SPIRIT and TRUTH:</L>
<L>God's a Spirit!—among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI></L>

<L>Thanks and Praise, Sacrifices are</L>
<L>To GOD most pleasing, when they spring</L>
<L>From a pure Heart He doth prepare,</L>

<HEAD>LOVE's Original.</HEAD>
<L>LOVE is a <HI>Cyon</HI> cropt from Virtue's Tree,</L>
<L>And grafted in the Stock of Purity;</L>
<L>Planted at first in Nature's choisest Soil,</L>
<L>Before the Fiend did Nature's Beauty spoil;</L>
<L>But thence transplanted to a richer Ground,</L>
<L>Than can in all Dame Nature's Realm be found,</L>
<L>Where being well manur'd, it takes deep Root</L>
<L>Downward, and Branches upward forth doth shoot:</L>
<L>The Sap, which doth this stately Tree maintain,</L>
<L>Is <HI>Sympathy</HI>; which runs as in a Vein</L>
<L>Thro' every Branch, causing it first to sprout,</L>
<L>And e'er awhile, young tender Buds spring out.</L>
<L>Nor is it barren, but much Fruit doth bear,</L>
<L>To Taste most pleasing, and to Sight most fair;</L>
<L>A sound substantial Fruit, that can indure</L>
<L>The sharpest Frost, and yet continue pure:</L>
<L>And that ye may this Fruit the more admire,</L>
<L>Take Notice, that I call it <HI>Chaste Desire.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>Thus they went on a while; but e'er 'twas long,</L>
<L>The Glew of Gold to pastoral Fingers stuck,</L>

<L>The Sheep, by blind Devotion led, still give,</L>

<L>A common Sheep, being by Chance in Place,</L>

<L>They may the Sheep, and what they have devour.</L>

<LG>
<L>And they so many Ways have found to pull,</L>
<L>Lock after Lock from the deluded Sheep,</L>

<LG>
<L>A <HI>Ram</HI> and <HI>Ewe</HI> may not with nuptial Rite</L>

<L>And when the pregnant <HI>Ewe</HI> her <HI>Lamb</HI> doth yean,</L>

<HEAD>On WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Worship, Heav'n with Approbation crowns,</L>
<L>Consisteth not in <HI>Cringes,</HI> or in <HI>Sounds</HI>;</L>
<L>In <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> or in <HI>Cut of Coat,</HI></L>
<L>Nor in <HI>long Pray'rs,</HI> expressed all by Rote;</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="60"/>'Tis not perform'd with <HI>tuned Instrument</HI></L>
<L>In costly Domes, Houses magnificent,</L>
<L>Which strike the Senses, and Affections draw</L>
<L>Into a <HI>superstitious lifeless Awe</HI>;</L>
<L>But unreforms, and leaves the Soul as poor,</L>
<L>As impotent, and filthy as before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No! genuine WORSHIP is a nobler Thing,</L>
<L>LOVE's its Original and only Spring;</L>
<L>It is perform'd <HI>in Spirit</HI> and <HI>in Heart,</HI></L>
<L>By th' Ability GOD doth Himself impart;</L>
<L>And it consisteth in <HI>a holy living,</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>Pray'r,</HI> in <HI>Praise,</HI> and <HI>true Thanksgiving.</HI></L>

<HEAD>The INTERNAL MONITOR.</HEAD>
<L>THOU need'st not say, with mental Sighs, O Man!</L>
<L>Who will unfold JEHOVAH's mystick Plan?</L>
<L>Who bring the sacred <HI>Pandects</HI> from the Sky?</L>
<L>That we may hear, and with the Terms comply.</L>
<L>Who perch upon the Morning's early Breeze?</L>
<L>And waft it to us from beyond the Seas.</L>
<L>Or, who descend to the unmeasur'd Deep,</L>
<L>And fetch it where tremendous Waters sleep?</L>
<L>For in thy Heart the WORD's divinely wrote,</L>
<L>Indelible and fair, without a Blot;</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="61"/>Speaks ev'ry Tongue beneath the Cope of Heav'n,</L>
<L>Extensive as the LIGHT! to All 'tis giv'n.</L>
<L>Unto this Oracle Attention give,</L>
<L>Obey its Dictates, and thy Soul shall live.</L>
<L>Nor need'st thou say, Wherewith, alas, shall I</L>
<L>Approach the Great Eternal DEITY?</L>
<L>Or how prostrate myself to gain his Eye?</L>
<L>Shall I before His awful Presence come</L>
<L>With Yearling-calves, in a full Hecatomb?</L>
<L>Will Rams in thousands please from <HI>Bashan</HI>'s Soil?</L>
<L>Or, shall I give ten thousand Rills of Oil?</L>
<L>Shall my First-born be offer'd as a Toll,</L>
<L>The Body's Fruit ransom the guilty Soul?</L>
<L>No! none of these, JEHOVAH will delight;</L>
<L>Thy Heart is <HI>Conscious</HI> of the Thing <HI>that</HI>'s <HI>Right.</HI></L>
<L>The Rule is short—<HI>Be merciful, be just,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And humbly in thy</HI> MAKER <HI>put thy Trust.</HI></L>

<L>WHAT Words JEHOVAH! shall I chuse</L>
<L>T' express my Thanks to Thee?</L>
<L>What reverential Posture use?</L>
<L>Down on my Face or Knee?</L>

<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
<L>External Forms may seem devout,</L>
<L>Yet no Acceptance find;</L>

<L>The Heart's an Index; read me, there</L>
<L>See Gratitude and Praise;</L>
<L>For Competence, a Conscience clear,</L>
<L>With Health, and Length of Days;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For one true Friend, an Offspring large;</L>
<L>And what is dearer still,</L>
<L>For LOVE, that did my Debts discharge,</L>
<L>And brought from Heav'n Thy Will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall I, O GOD! thus highly blest,</L>
<L>E'er disobedient prove,</L>
<L>Or make <HI>revealed Truths</HI> a Jest,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sceptick</HI> Reas'ning love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall I prefer a transient Sin,</L>
<L>Renounce Thy sacred Laws,</L>
<L>And slight Thy holy Checks within,</L>
<L>To gain the World's Applause?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No; rather let my Hand forget</L>
<L>To guide the passive Quill;</L>
<L>My Eyes in total Darkness set,</L>
<L>My lab'ring Heart stand still.</L>
