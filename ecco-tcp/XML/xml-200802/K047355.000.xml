<HEAD>TO THE PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will perceive at first sight that the hint of this piece is borrowed from an Italian Opera, entitled, <HI>Il Filofofo di Campagna.</HI> There is also a circumstance from Moliere, which, except about twenty lines taken from different publications, and thrown occasionally into the songs, are the only pas∣sages in it that have ever appeared either on the stage, or in print.</P>
<P>Indeed conscious of my own inability, I should have collected all the materials, had it been practicable; but attempting this with∣out success, and being unwilling to throw away a subject than which 'tis hardly possible to conceive any thing more operatical, I de∣termined to make a tryal of what I could do to it myself, and this in no respect with a view of setting myself up for an author, but merely from a desire of assisting my reputa∣tion as a musician.</P>
<P>And now I should very little deserve the
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>
pains they have taken for me, if I did not in the warmest manner acknowledge my ob∣ligations to the performers, to whose merit I am convinced I owe a considerable share of that applause the WEDDING RING has been favoured with.</P>
<P>I have little more to say concerning the piece. The dialogue is given for nothing more than such as would immediately arise from the situations; and if the songs are found to be irregular, I would beg leave to remark, that they were written so (the comic ones especially) on purpose, it being very often necessary, that the measure should halt in order to give a novelty to the expression of the musick. And having said thus much, such as it is, I take the liberty of submitting this trifle to the public; to that public to whom I have such infinite obligations, whose humanity and generosity I have so lately ex∣perienced, and to whose amusement it will always be my greatest pride, that I have the honour of endeavouring to contribute.</P>

<L>"I Give and bequeath to Zerbino my son,</L>

<L>Good fortunes, I'faith! next come watches, and rings,</L>

<L>Of which, some were pawn'd, some detain'd, and some plunder'd,</L>
<L>From widows, and heirs, little short of a hundred;</L>
<L>These, and all his possessions, without one omission,</L>
<L>Are giv'n to this Spark, on the following condition:</L>
<L>"In hopes, that my son will to virtue incline;</L>
<L>"And lead a life careful and honest, like mine;</L>

<L>"In short, treading just in the path that I trod;</L>

<P>Well, this is the first word upon that sub∣ject I ever heard out of your mouth.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you have been overhearing what I read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, 'tis no secret; we all know well enough that you want to marry my young lady to a spark with more money than understanding, and I suppose you was contriving now to load her with riches, in return for the happiness you intend to deprive her of.</P>
</SP>

<P>I wonder what possesses me that I bear all this. Hear me, Mrs. Impudence, send your mis∣tress to me, and let me have no more of this be∣haviour, if you expect to stay in my family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir, you may do as you please; you are not content I find with preventing my young lady's happiness, but you want to rob her of the only friend she has in the world.</P>

<P>I would fain persuade myself, that all the chattering of this wench, is no more than the com∣mon cant of creatures in her situation; and yet Felicia's disingenuous behaviour has half convinc'd me, that there's a lover in the case.

<L>I saw, what seem'd a harmless child,</L>

<L>Not aware of the danger, too soon I comply'd,</L>

<P>I understood, Sir, you desired to see me, but I find you are busy.</P>

<P>Only labouring for thee, Felicia. I am contriving the securest method of adding the vast possessions of Sig. Zerbino to the estate of our family.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why should you do that, Sir? have not we fortune sufficient already?</P>

<P>To be sure fifteen thousand crowns a year, well paid, is no contemptible thing; but, as I told you, I am desiring this for you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't see how I am concern'd in it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus: Zerbino's father was my par∣ticular friend; and I can't bear to think that all his vast wealth should be lavish'd away in equi∣pages, courtezans, and such sort of expences; so out of friendship to the young man, and with a view to your interest at the same time, I intend to make him my son-in-law.</P>

<P>There, Madam, you'll believe me another time.</P>

<P>Hold your tongue, Lissetta, for shame!</P>

you don't seem to enter cordially into this proposal of mine.</P>

<P>Lord, Ma'am! how can you, begging your pardon, be so foolish? I would not make myself miserable to oblige all the fathers in the world.</P>

<P>Will you hold your tongue? 'tis you that have spoilt her.</P>

<P>I beg, Lissetta, you'll not treat my father in this familiar manner.</P>

<P>I am terrified to death at my situation; I have not the courage to refuse my father, and yet find it impossible to comply with his cruel request. Why indeed should I comply with it?

But then is not this the request of a tender and indulgent father, who has always made my happi∣ness his constant study; and even now wishes this union from no one motive, but to see me plac'd in a still superior situation? alas, how weak and vain! as if felicity was the ceriain consequence of splen∣dour; and that all the pleasures and enjoyments of life follow'd in the train of the great.

<P>Ah, this is always the case, the moment a man knows his power he abuses it; however, Sir, I think, since I have been so condescending, you ought, at least, to say something handsome to me now on the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, for that matter, I've a vast deal to say to you, but I dont know how it is, I've such a prodigious pleasure in your company, that when∣ever I go to speak I can't get out a word for the life of me.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, since it is so, will you, as the

<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then you don't believe me?</P>

<P>I don't absolutely say that; but it would be a satisfaction to me, I confess, to hear it from the young lady herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, you shall have that satisfaction in a minute, for here she comes.—Felicia, here's a strange importunate sort of a gentleman, who has the audacity to expect my consent to his mar∣riage with you; I told him of the promise you made me, and nothing, forsooth, will satisfy him but hearing it from your mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, what I heard from your father might well surprise me, I was in doubt, I own; and that final sentence, which determines the fate of my unbounded passion, must be so sen∣sibly felt by me, that it can be no offence if I desire a repetition of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'd have it known, that fate has pre∣sented two objects to my view, which inspiring me with different sentiments, agitate all the passions of my soul, one, by a reasonable choice whereto honour engages me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Possesses all my esteem and love.</P>

<P>I know, 'tis highly improper for young women to own their love so freely; but in the con∣dition fate has plac'd me, these liberties may be allow'd, and I can without a blush confess, that I have declared my real sentiments.</P>

<P>Lord, Sir, you won't be pleased let one talk how one will; did not you say, my young lady treated him too cruelly? and would not any body in the world say the same? is there any com∣parison now between him and Signor Zerbino? Oh, Ma'am, your father is perfectly in the right; shew more compassion to Henrico by all means.</P>

<P>Sure, Sir, there's no harm in speaking one's mind; I have said no more than what I actually think of the matter, and you can't do better than first of all to marry your daughter to Henrico, and afterwards, as a reward for my faithful services, prevail upon Zerbino to marry me.</P>

<P>Oh, Ma'am, If you don't exert a little spi∣rit we are undone: I have taken care to apprise Henrico of all that's going forward; and poor Zerbino—if he does not repent his gallantry—I have such a battery to play off against him; nay, I'll make both him and your father principal actors in this plot of ours, even without their knowledge.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Felicia, what can be the meaning of a strange story I have heard from Zerbino?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, how should I know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinc'd he could not mean to im∣pose upon me, and yet, upon reflection, I hardly think you could have been guilty of so much du∣plicity at the very time I had every reason in the world to believe you was perfectly obedient to my will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me understand you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does not signify repeating the matter, he'll be here in a few minutes himself, and then—Oh, here he comes—Zerbino, I am glad to see you; let us now clear up this affair; you say you was informed that I intended to refuse you my daughter, and give her to Sig. Henrico.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you be content if I give her to you now, and call in friends to witness it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't desire any better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then take her hand, and I hope you'll both be happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sig. Pandolfo, I did not think you was ca∣pable of using me so ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, is the man mad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I am not mad, nor such a fool as you think me; I find it's all true, and perhaps you may repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Repent, what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why offering me your daughter's maid. Do you think I can't see she's dizen'd out that way on purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Fool—Ideot—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you have found it out, have you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I would have you keep your promise of marrying me to your daughter; here she stands
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
by me, frightened out of her wits, and poor soul! I don't wonder it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter! that's her maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew well enough you would say so; but your daughter, or not your daughter, I'll marry her, and no body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I tell you you are imposed upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am, 'tis by no body but you, and you are only mad that your scheme did not take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever man thus abus'd! I could find in my heart to let him continue in his ignorance, to punish him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't spoil a poor girl's fortune, Sir; you see he does not deserve your daughter, bestow her then on Henrico.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for the hint; I made him a kind of promise this afternoon, and I declare if he was here I'd give him her hand this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I take you at your word, and hope you'll never have cause to repent your promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you, Sir, forgive my having de∣ceiv'd you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Felicia, you have not deceived me more than I have dcceiv'd myself; I therefore not only forgive you, but confess I was rightly serv'd for opposing your inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now I drop my disguise. I assum'd the character of my young lady to prevent you, Sig. Zerbino, from interrupting her happiness, it has answer'd my end and I am sufficiently re∣warded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Lissetta, you are two dif∣fident, this gentleman made a promise to marry you before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I made a promise to marry her before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you know you did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if I did, I'll tell you what—I'll keep it—she has wit enough in all conscience, and she ought to be made a gentlewoman of; and as for money, I have enough for us both, so let's have no more misunderstandings, but for the fu∣ture be all friends—what d'ye say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I accept your proposal with pleasure; since things have turn'd out in this manner, and Lissetta, is in some sort a relation of mine, my friendship and countenance you may command upon all occasions: for my part I am perfectly convinc'd, that two young people who have an af∣fection for each other are able to baffle all the pre∣caution in the world. And for the future, I wou'd no more attempt to oppose the decrees of love than I wou'd the decrees of fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pan.</SPEAKER>
<L>As light'ning shoots from place to place,</L>
<L>Which through the clouds we wond'ring trace,</L>
<L>Or darts a beam from Phaebus' face,</L>
<L>Whose flight no eye discovers;</L>
<L>Or from the moon a silver ray,</L>
<L>Will, glittering, on a river play;</L>
<L>So pointed arrows wing their way,</L>
<L>To wound the heart of lovers.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lis.</SPEAKER>
<L>I am your voucher, here's the pair,</L>
<L>But trust me they may thank my care;</L>
<L>Remember, Sir, the carrier,</L>
<L>Who, praying, did endeavour</L>
<L>To help his team along the road,</L>
<L>Cries out, this time is ill bestow'd;</L>
<L>Friend, clap your shoulders to the load,</L>
<L>Or you'll stay here for ever.</L>

<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>What will you say in excuse?</L>
<L>Your maxims are in little use;</L>
<L>Too oft we find 'tis wealth profuse</L>
<L>The female heart bewitches;</L>
<L>But you, an instance rare, remove</L>
<L>The shameful prejudice; and prove,</L>
<L>Though riches, most, prefer to love,</L>
<L>Some love, prefer, to riches.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fel.</SPEAKER>
<L>Zerbirto, take your Wedding Ring,</L>
<L>Of serious, sacred use—a thing</L>
<L>That us'd, or well, or ill, will bring</L>
<L>To mortals joy or sorrow:</L>
<L>It sav'd us both to day—ah, think,</L>
<L>From a rude precipice's brink,</L>
<L>Where, plunging, we were sure to sink</L>
<L>In misery to-morrow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zer.</SPEAKER>
<L>I see it, and the Ring once more</L>
<L>To its right owner thus restore;</L>
<L>By whom 'twas won, it should be wore,</L>
<L>Trust me I'll prove no rover;</L>
<L>And now if fortune kindly sends,</L>
<L>That we have pleas'd these best of friends,</L>
<L>I've gain'd my most ambitious ends,</L>
<L>And all my cares are over.</L>
