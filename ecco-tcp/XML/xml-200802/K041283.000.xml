<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable <HI>PHILIP,</HI> Earl of <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG> CHESTERFIELD! My Patron and my Pride,</L>
<L>In whom does all that's Great and Good reside;</L>
<L>Noble by Birth, by Liberal Arts refin'd;</L>
<L>Delight of Heav'n, and Darling of Mankind!</L>
<L>The publick Patriot, and the private Friend;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>To hated Indolence no more impute</L>
<L>The Muse's Silence, if, hereafter mute,</L>
<L>She quits her former Toils for future Ease;</L>
<L>And checks that Genius which (perhaps) might please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis Time my fruitless Labours to decline,</L>
<L>When all Men's Works can climb the Stage, but mine:</L>
<L>When, in my stead, behold! a motley Herd</L>
<L>Of upstart Witlings to my self preferr'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so when <HI>Booth, Wilks, Cibber,</HI> rul'd the Stage,</L>
<L>Dramatick Ornaments of this our Age:</L>
<L>My small Attempts to please were then approv'd,</L>
<L>And not for ev'ry trifling <HI>Farce</HI> remov'd.</L>
<L><HI>Booth</HI> ever shew'd me <HI>Friendship</HI> and <HI>Respect,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Wilks</HI> wou'd rather forward than reject.</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Cibber,</HI> Terror to the Scribbling Crew!</L>
<L>Would oft Sollicit me for something New.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, Younger Rulers Younger Authors take,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>These handy Hirelings can, in half a Day,</L>
<L>Steal a new Ballad FARCE from some old PLAY;</L>
<L>To mangled Scraps of many an Ancient Tune</L>
<L>Tagg Feetless Jingle, Jarring and Jejune;</L>
<L>The jaded Play'rs with equal haste rehearse,</L>
<L>'Till Sing Song limps, to Horrid! Hobbling Verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' Blunder follows Blunder, Line by Line,</L>
<L>The 'Squire is taught to think <HI>'tis wond'rous Fine</HI>!</L>
<L>It suits his Taste, he gives his plaudit Voice,</L>
<L>And shews his Understanding in his Choice.</L>
<L>Framing Conceptions both of Men and Things,</L>
<L>Just as Sir <HI>Figg</HI> directs his Leading-Strings:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sir <HI>Figg,</HI> grand Master of the double Sneer,</L>
<L>Who, when He most deceives, seems most Sincere;</L>
<L>Dissembler Born, but much improv'd by Art,</L>
<L>A Friendly Aspect, an Infernal Heart:</L>
<L>The Mischievous, the Busy <HI>Go between</HI></L>
<L>Easy 'Squire <HI>Amb's-Ace,</HI> and sly <HI>Harlequin</HI>;</L>
<L>Who, like two wrangling Counsellors at Bar,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>But yet, in Private, like dear Friends caress,</L>
<L>And form Designs, poor Players to distress.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woe to the Stage! if once their Schemes Succeed;</L>
<L>Actors will then be Abject Slaves indeed:</L>
<L>Poets had better lay their Pens aside,</L>
<L>Than tamely truckle to Stage Tyrant's Pride;</L>
<L>Who, Vain and Partial, keep Old Authors down,</L>
<L>To force their own Low Trump'ry on the Town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why to such Wretches should I yeild my Cause,</L>
<L>So lately honour'd with so much Applause?</L>
<L>My little Ballads still on ev'ry Tongue,</L>
<L>Are in politest Conversation Sung:</L>
<L>Nor can severest Censure trace one Line.</L>
<L>That tends to Vice, in any Verse of mine.</L>
<L>To please and yet instruct is all my Aim,</L>
<L>Let Venal Poetasters boast the same;</L>
<L>Whose utmost Views are to corrupt the Taste,</L>
<L>To sooth the Vicious, and to shock the Chaste;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>And, quite estrang'd to any Sense of Shame,</L>
<L>Make Women speak what Rakes wou'd blush to name;</L>
<L>Then, in Excuse, plead Nothing else goes down;</L>
<L>A wretched Compliment upon the Town!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wretched as false—The Town's not so deprav'd,</L>
<L>Were Authors and were Actors less enslav'd:</L>
<L>Could one good Piece be suffer'd to appear,</L>
<L>The Town wou'd gladly lend a candid Ear;</L>
<L>Prefer pure Nature and the simple SCENE,</L>
<L>To all the <HI>Monkey Tricks</HI> of <HI>Harlequin:</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Man of Taste</HI> proves this Assertion true,</L>
<L>We want what's rational as well as New.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, this Declension of the <HI>British</HI> Stage,</L>
<L>BOOTH, <HI>Britain's Roscius,</HI> justly did presage;</L>
<L>That Rules Dramatic, Humour, Taste and Wit,</L>
<L>Must to that Monster <HI>Pantomime</HI> submit:</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Pantomime,</HI> in all its Grandeur drest,</L>
<L>Is but a pompous <HI>Puppet-Shew</HI> at best.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<L>Then, farewell Stage! be Bus'ness now my Boast,</L>
<L>With what was Irksome once Delighted most;</L>
<L>Pleas'd and contented with my little Store,</L>
<L>I scorn to prostitute my Muse for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! What Fame, what Gain can I propose,</L>
<L>When others Father fast as I compose?</L>
<L>To such a pitch is pert Presumption grown,</L>
<L>'Tis well if this Poor Piece be thought my own.</L>
<L>So when, long since, in simple Sonnet Lays,</L>
<L>I made the 'Prentice Sing his <HI>Sally</HI>'s Praise,</L>
<L>Tho' rude the Numbers, yet the Subject mov'd;</L>
<L>Immortal ADDISON the Song approv'd;</L>
<L>Then Prejudice with Envy did combine,</L>
<L>Because 'twas Good, 'twas thought too Good for mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So common Fame did various Authors chuse</L>
<L>To <HI>Namby Pamby,</HI> Offspring of my Muse;</L>
<L>Till POPE, who ever prov'd to Truth a Friend,</L>
<L>With Gen'rous Ardour did my Cause defend;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>Trac'd me obscure and in Detraction's Spite</L>
<L>Display'd me in a more conspicuous Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To mention more wou'd prove a needless Task,</L>
<L>Why shou'd they not be mine? That's all I ask:</L>
<L>Because I'm Chearful, Unreserv'd and Free,</L>
<L>Can nothing Good or New proceed from me?</L>
<L>What have I done, injurious to Mankind,</L>
<L>My Works must be to other Men assign'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well! let 'em go, I all my Right resign,</L>
<L>Entirely Easy, had they ne'er been mine:</L>
<L>Yet, this Reflection consolates my Fate,</L>
<L>I see my Error e'er it proves too late.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more half Maz'd I hurry thro' the Town,</L>
<L>With Magazines of Projects in my Crown:</L>
<L>While Pyrate Printers rob me of my Gain,</L>
<L>And reap the labour'd Harvest of my Brain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="y"/>
<L>Like other Men, I walk a common Pace,</L>
<L>Nor run through <HI>London</HI> one continued Race;</L>
<L>But know When, Where and What I am to do,</L>
<L>You'll think tis strange, <HI>My Lord!</HI> but yet 'tis true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome, Sweet Tranquillity of Mind!</L>
<L>I now a Treasure in Contentment find;</L>
<L>Can labour or relax when e'er I please,</L>
<L>And boast I've once enjoy'd a moment's Ease;</L>
<L>Of all a Moderate Man can wish possest,</L>
<L>But most in such a Godlike <HI>Patron</HI> blest.</L>
<L>Beneath the Sacred Sanction of whose Name,</L>
<L>I build my present Peace, my future Fame.</L>
