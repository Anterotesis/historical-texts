<P>THE fame of Gratian, before he had ac∣complished the twentieth year of his age, was equal to that of the most cele∣brated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and con∣duct of the emperor Gratian. A. D. 379—383.</NOTE> princes. His gentle and amiable dispo∣sition endeared him to his private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the liberality, acknowledged the taste and eloquence, of their sovereign; his valour and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
soldiers; and the clergy considered the humble piety of Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues. The victory of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion; and the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of Theodosius, to the author of <HI>his</HI> greatness, and of the public safety. Gratian survived those me∣morable events only four or five years; but he survived his reputation; and, before he fell a victim to rebellion, he had lost, in a great mea∣sure, the respect and confidence of the Roman world.</P>
<P>The remarkable alteration of his character or <NOTE PLACE="marg">His de∣fects.</NOTE> conduct, may not be imputed to the arts of flat∣tery, which had besieged the son of Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headstrong passions which that gentle youth appears to have escaped. A more attentive view of the life of Gratian, may perhaps suggest the true cause of the disappoint∣ment of the public hopes. His apparent vir∣tues, instead of being the hardy productions of experience and adversity, were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education. The anxious tenderness of his father was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages, which he might perhaps esteem the more highly, as he himself had been deprived of them; and the most skilful masters of every science, and of every art, had laboured to form the mind and body of the young prince <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Valentinian was less attentive to the religion of his son; since he entrusted the education of Gratian to Ausonius, a professed Pagan (Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xv. p. 125—138.). The poetical fame of Ausonius condemns the taste of his age.</NOTE>. The knowledge which they pain∣fully
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
communicated was displayed with ostenta∣tion, and celebrated with lavish praise. His soft and tractable disposition received the fair impres∣sion of their judicious precepts, and the absence of passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason. His preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of ministers of state <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ausonius was successively promoted to the Praetorian praefecture of Italy (A. D. 377.), and of Gaul (A. D. 378.); and was at length invested with the consulship (A. D. 379.). He expressed his gratitude in a servile and insipid piece of flattery (Actio Gratiarum, p. 699—736.), which has survived more worthy productions.</NOTE>; and, as they wisely dissembled their secret autho∣rity, he seemed to act with firmness, with pro∣priety, and with judgment, on the most important occasions of his life and reign. But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not penetrate be∣yond the surface; and the skilful preceptors, who so accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil, could not infuse into his feeble and indolent cha∣racter, the vigorous and independent principle of action, which renders the laborious pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness, and almost to the existence, of the hero. As soon as time and accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne, the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his na∣tural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the ambitious hands which were stretched for∣wards to grasp them; and amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications. A public sale of favour and injustice was instituted, both
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
in the court, and in the provinces, by the worth∣less delegates of his power, whose merit, it was made <HI>sacrilege</HI> to question <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Disputare de principali judicio non oportet. Sacrilegii enim in∣star est dubitare, an is dignus sit, quem elegerit imperator. Codex Justinian. l. ix. tit. xxix. leg. 3. This convenient law was revived and promulgated, after the death of Gratian, by the feeble court of Milan.</NOTE>. The conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and bishops <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ambrose composed, for his instruction, a theological treatise on the faith of the Trinity: and Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 158. 169.) ascribes to the archbishop the merit of Gratian's intolerant laws.</NOTE>; who procured an Imperial edict to punish, as a capital offence, the violation, the neglect, or even the ignorance, of the divine law <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Qui divinae legis sanctitatem, nesciendo omittunt, aut negli∣gendo violant, et offendunt, sacrilegium committunt. Codex Justi∣nian. l. ix. tit. xxix. leg. 1. Theodosius indeed may claim his share, in the merit of this comprehensive law.</NOTE>. Among the various arts which had exercised the youth of Gratian, he had applied himself, with singular inclination and success, to manage the horse, to draw the bow, and to dart the jave∣lin; and these qualifications, which might be useful to a soldier, were prostituted to the viler purposes of hunting. Large parks were inclosed for the Imperial pleasures, and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts; and Gratian neglected the duties, and even the dignity, of his rank, to consume whole days in the vain dis∣play of his dexterity and boldness in the chace. The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to excel in an art, in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of his slaves, reminded the nu∣merous spectators of the examples of Nero and
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
Commodus: but the chaste and temperate Gra∣tian was a stranger to their monstrous vices; and his hands were stained only with the blood of animals <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxxi. 10.) and the younger Victor acknowledge the virtues of Gratian; and accuse, or rather lament, his degenerate taste. <Q>The odious parallel of Commodus is saved by "licet incru∣entus;" and perhaps Philostorgius (l. x. c. 10. and Godefroy, p. 412.) had guarded, with some similar reserve, the comparison of Nero.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The behaviour of Gratian, which degraded his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontent of the Roman troops. A. D. 383.</NOTE> character in the eyes of mankind, could not have disturbed the security of his reign, if the army had not been provoked to resent their peculiar injuries. As long as the young emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters, he pro∣fessed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers; many of his hours were spent in the familiar con∣versation of the camp; and the health, the com∣forts, the rewards, the honours, of his faithful troops, appeared to be the object of his attentive concern. But, after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing taste for hunting and shooting, he naturally connected himself with the most dex∣terous ministers of his favourite amusement. A body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic service of the palace; and the ad∣mirable skill, which they were accustomed to dis∣play in the unbounded plains of Scythia, was exercised, on a more narrow theatre, in the parks and inclosures of Gaul. Gratian admired the talents and customs of these favourite guards, to whom alone he entrusted the defence of his per∣son:
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
and, as if he meant to insult the public opi∣nion, he frequently shewed himself to the soldiers and people, with the dress and arms, the long bow, the sounding quiver, and the fur garments, of a Scythian warrior. The unworthy spectacle of a Roman prince, who had renounced the dress and manners of his country, filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. iv. p. 247.) and the younger Victor ascribe the re∣volution to the favour of the Alani, and the discontent of the Roman troops. Dum exercitum negligeret, et paucos ex Alanis, quos in∣genti auro ad se transtulerat, anteferret veteri ac Romano militi.</NOTE>. Even the Germans, so strong and formidable in the armies of the empire, affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of the savages of the North, who, in the space of a few years, had wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine. A loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and garrisons of the West; and as the mild indolence of Gratian neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent, the want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of fear. But the subversion of an established go∣vernment is always a work of some real, and of much apparent, difficulty; and the throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom, law, religion, and the nice balance of the civil and military powers, which had been established by the policy of Constantine. It is not very im∣portant to enquire from what causes the revolt of Britain was produced.

His abilities, and even his integrity, are acknow∣ledged by the partial writers of the age; and the merit must indeed have been conspicuous, that could extort such a confession in favour of the vanquished enemy of Theodosius. The discon∣tent of Maximus might incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign, and to encourage, per∣haps without any views of ambition, the mur∣murs of the troops.

But his feeble efforts announced his degenerate spirit and desperate situation; and deprived him of the resources, which he still might have found, in the support of his subjects and allies. The armies of Gaul, instead of opposing the march of Maximus, re∣ceived him with joyful and loyal acclamations; and the shame of the desertion was transferred from the people to the prince. The troops, whose station more immediately attached them to the service of the palace, abandoned the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in the neighbourhood of Paris. The emperor of the West fled towards Lyons, with a train of only three hundred horse; and, in the cities along the road, where he hoped to find a refuge, or at least a passage, he was taught, by cruel ex∣perience, that every gate is shut against the un∣fortunate.

The events of this revolution had passed in such rapid succession, that it would have been impossible for Theodosius to march to the relief <NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of peace be∣tween Maximus and Theo∣dosius, A.

During the sea∣son of sincere grief, or ostentatious mourning, the Eastern emperor was interrupted by the ar∣rival of the principal chamberlain of Maximus: and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office which was usually exercised by eunuchs, announced to the court of Constantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper. The ambassador condescended to justify, or ex∣cuse, the conduct of his master; and to protest, in specious language, that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated, without his knowledge or consent, by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers. But he proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodosius the alternative of peace, or war. The speech of the ambassador concluded with a spirited declaration, that although Maximus, as a Roman, and as the father of his people, would chuse rather to employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was armed and prepared, if his friendship should be rejected, to dispute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. An immediate and peremptory answer was required; but it was extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy, on this im∣portant occasion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honour and gratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of Gra∣tian,

he had received the Imperial diadem: his patience would encourage the odious suspicion, that he was more deeply sensible of former in∣juries, than of recent obligations; and if he ac∣cepted the friendship, he must seem to share the guilt, of the assassin. Even the principles of justice, and the interest of society, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus: and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age. But, as the sentiments of gratitude and honour should invariably regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced in the mind of a sove∣reign, by the sense of superior duties: and the maxims both of justice and humanity, must per∣mit the escape of an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in the conse∣quences of his punishment. The assassin of Gra∣tian had usurped, but he actually possessed, the most warlike provinces of the empire: the East was exhausted by the misfortunes, and even by the success, of the Gothic war; and it was seriously to be apprehended, that, after the vital strength of the republic had been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest, the feeble conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Bar∣barians of the North. These weighty considera∣tions engaged Theodosius to dissemble his resent∣ment, and to accept the alliance of the tyrant.

If Constan∣tine had the advantage of erecting the standard of the cross, the emulation of his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy, and of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world. Theodosius was the first of the emperors baptised in the true faith of the Trinity. Although he was born of a Christian family, the maxims, or at least the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delay the ceremony of his initiation; till he was admonished of the danger of delay, by the serious illness which threatened his life, towards the end of the first year of his reign.

But the dangerous interview was pre∣vented by the prayers of the Empress Flaccilla, who trembled for the salvation of her husband; and the mind of Theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument, adapted to the rudest capa∣city. He had lately bestowed, on his eldest son Arcadius, the name and honours of Augustus; and the two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage of their subjects. A bishop, Amphilochius of Iconium, approached the throne, and after saluting, with due reverence, the person of his sovereign, he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar tenderness, which he might have used towards a plebeian child. Provoked by this insolent behaviour, the monarch gave orders, that the rustic priest should be in∣stantly driven from his presence. But while the guards were forcing him to the door, the dex∣terous polemic had time to execute his design, by exclaiming, with a loud voice, <Q>"Such is the treatment, O Emperor! which the King of Heaven has prepared for those impious men, who affect to worship the Father, but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his divine Son."</Q> Theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of Iconium; and never forgot the import∣ant lesson, which he had received from this dra∣matic parable <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Sozomen, l. vii. c. 6.

But the saint (who had not subdued the imperfections of human virtue) was deeply affected by the mortifying consideration, that his entrance into the fold was that of a wolf, rather than of a shepherd: that the glittering arms, which surrounded his person, were necessary for his safety; and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great party, whom, as men and citizens, it was impossible for him to despise. He beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex, and of every age, who crowded the streets, the windows, and the roofs of the houses; he heard the tumultuous voice of rage, grief, astonishment, and despair; and Gregory fairly confesses, that on the memorable day of his installation, the capital of the East wore the appearance of a city taken by storm, and in the hands of a Barbarian con∣queror <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">See Gregory Nazianzen, tom. ii. de Vitâ suâ, p. 21, 22.

Yet there is reason to imagine that the violence of zeal and revenge was, in some measure, eluded by the want of resistance; and that, in their adversity, the Arians displayed much less firmness, than had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of Constantius and Valens. The moral character and conduct of the hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common principles of nature and religion: but a very material circum∣stance may be discovered, which tended to dis∣tinguish the degrees of their theological faith. Both parties, in the schools, as well as in the temples, acknowledged and worshipped the divine majesty of Christ; and, as we are always prone to impute our own sentiments and passions to the Deity, it would be deemed more prudent and re∣spectful to exaggerate, than to circumscribe, the adorable perfections of the Son of God.

<P>The hope that truth and wisdom would be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The coun∣cil of Con∣stanti∣nople, A.

and opinions; and in the various revolutions of the church and state, the religion of their sove∣reign was the rule of their obsequious faith. When the emperor suspended his prevailing in∣fluence, the turbulent synod was blindly impelled, by the absurd or selfish motives of pride, hatred, and resentment. The death of Meletius, which happened at the council of Constantinople, pre∣sented the most favourable opportunity of ter∣minating the schism of Antioch, by suffering his aged rival, Paulinus, peaceably to end his days in the episcopal chair. The faith and virtues of Paulinus were unblemished.

But the name of the sincere historian who has conveyed this in∣structive lesson to the knowledge of posterity, must silence the impotent murmurs of superstition and bigotry.

Their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions which the bishop of Constantinople derived from the choice of the people, and the approbation of the em∣peror. But Gregory soon became the victim of malice and envy. The bishops of the East, his strenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
in the affairs of Antioch, abandoned him, without support, to the adverse faction of the Egyptians; who disputed the validity of his election, and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon, that pro∣hibited the licentious practice of episcopal transla∣tions. The pride, or the humility, of Gregory prompted him to decline a contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice; and he publicly offered, not without some mixture of indignation, to renounce the government of a church, which had been restored, and almost created, by his labours. His resignation was accepted by the synod, and by the emperor, with more readiness than he seems to have expected. At the time when he might have hoped to enjoy the fruits of his victory, his episcopal throne was filled by the senator Nectarius; and the new arch∣bishop, accidentally recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect, was obliged to de∣lay the ceremony of his consecration, till he had previously dispatched the rites of his baptism <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">The whimsical ordination of Nectarius is attested by Sozomen (l. vii. c. 8.); but Tillemont observes (Mem.

The orthodox emperor considered every heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven, and of earth; and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty. The decrees of the council of Constantinople had ascertained the true standard of the faith; and the ecclesiastics, who governed the conscience of Theodosius, suggested the most effectual methods of persecution. In the space of fifteen years, he promulgated at least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">See the Theodosian Code, l. xvi. tit. v. leg. 6—23., with Godefroy's commentary on each law, and his general summary, or <HI>Paratition,</HI> tom. vi. p. 104—110.</NOTE>; more especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity; and, to deprive them of every hope of escape, he sternly enacted, that if any laws, or rescripts, should be alleged in their fa∣vour, the judges should consider them as the ille∣gal productions either of fraud, or forgery. The penal statutes were directed against the ministers, the assembles, and the persons, of the heretics; and the passions of the legislator were expressed
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
in the language of declamation and invective. I. The heretical teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops, or Presbyters, were not only ex∣cluded from the privileges and emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy, but they were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation, if they presumed to preach the doctrine, or to practise the rites, of their <HI>accursed</HI> sects. A fine of ten pounds of gold (above four hundred pounds Sterling) was imposed on every person who should dare to confer, or receive, or pro∣mote, an heretical ordination: and it was reason∣ably expected, that if the race of pastors could be extinguished, their helpless flocks would be com∣pelled, by ignorance and hunger, to return within the pale of the Catholic Church. II. The rigor∣ous prohibition of conventicles was carefully ex∣tended to every possible circumstance, in which the heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping God and Christ according to the dictates of their conscience. Their religious meetings, whether public or secret, by day or by night, in cities or in the country, were equally proscribed by the edicts of Theodosius; and the building, or ground, which had been used for that illegal purpose, was forfeited to the Imperial do∣main. III. It was supposed, that the error of the heretics could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds; and that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment. The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil excommunication; which separated them from their fellow-citizens, by a peculiar brand of
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
infamy; and this declaration of the supreme ma∣gistrate tended to justify, or at least to excuse, the insults of a fanatic populace. The sectaries were gradually disqualified for the possession of honour∣able, or lucrative, employments; and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice, when he decreed, that, as the Eunomians distinguished the nature of the Son from that of the Father, they should be incapable of making their wills, or of receiv∣ing any advantage from testamentary donations. The guilt of the Manichaean heresy was esteemed of such magnitude, that it could be expiated only by the death of the offender; and the same capital punishment was inflicted on the Audians, or <HI>Quar∣todecimans</HI> <NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">They always kept their Easter, like the Jewish Passover, on the fourteenth day of the first moon after the vernal equinox; and thus pertinaciously opposed the Roman church and Nicene synod, which had <HI>fixed</HI> Easter to a Sunday.

But an accurate, or rather a candid, enquiry, will dis∣cover, that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of nature, it was not by the licentiousness, but by the austerity, of their lives. They absolutely con∣demned the use of the marriage-bed; and the peace of families was often disturbed by indiscreet separations. They enjoined, or recommended, a total abstinence from all animal food; and their
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
continual prayers, fasts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of strict and perfect devotion. The specu∣lative tenets of the sect, concerning the person of Christ, and the nature of the human soul, were derived from the Gnostic and Manichaean system; and this vain philosophy, which had been trans∣ported from Egypt to Spain, was ill adapted to the grosser spirits of the West. The obscure dis∣ciples of Priscillian suffered, languished, and gra∣dually disappeared: his tenets were rejected by the clergy and people, but his death was the sub∣ject of a long and vehement controversy; while some arraigned, and others applauded, the justice of his sentence. It is with pleasure that we can observe, the humane inconsistency of the most illustrious saints and bishops, Ambrose of Milan <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">Ambros. tom. ii. epist. xxiv. p. 891.</NOTE>, and Martin of Tours <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">In the Sacred History, and the Life of St. Martin, Sulpicius Severus uses some caution; but he declares himself more freely in the Dialogues (iii. 15.).

They pitied the unhappy men, who had been executed at Treves; they refused to hold communion with their epis∣copal murderers; and if Martin deviated from that generous resolution, his motives were laudable, and his repentance was exemplary. The bishops of Tours and Milan pronounced, without hesita∣tion, the eternal damnation of heretics; but they were surprised, and shocked, by the bloody image of their temporal death, and the honest feelings of

nature resisted the artificial prejudices of theology. The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was con∣firmed by the scandalous irregularity of the pro∣ceedings against Priscillian, and his adherents. The civil and ecclesiastical ministers had trans∣gressed the limits of their respective provinces. The secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal, and to pronounce a definitive sentence, in a matter of faith, and episcopal jurisdiction. The bishops had disgraced themselves, by exer∣cising the function of accusers in a criminal pro∣secution. The cruelty of Ithacius <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">The Catholic presbyter (Sulp.

He was descended from a noble family of Romans; his father had exercised the im∣portant office of Praetorian praefect of Gaul; and the son, after passing through the studies of a liberal education, attained, in the regular grada∣tion of civil honours, the station of consular of Liguria, a province which included the Imperial residence of Milan. At the age of thirty-four, and before he had received the sacrament of bap∣tism, Ambrose, to his own surprise, and to that of the world, was suddenly transformed from a go∣vernor to an archbishop. Without the least mix∣ture, as it is said, of art or intrigue, the whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the episcopal title; the concord and perseverance of their acclamations were ascribed to a praeter∣natural impulse; and the reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual office, for which he was not prepared by the habits and occupations of his former life. But the active force of his genius soon qualified him to exercise, with zeal

and prudence, the duties of his ecclesiastical juris∣diction; and, while he cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal greatness, he condescended, for the good of the church, to direct the conscience of the emperors, and to con∣troul the administration of the empire. Gratian loved and revered him as a father; and the ela∣borate treatise on the saith of the Trinity, was designed for the instruction of the young prince. After his tragic death, at a time when the em∣press Justina trembled for her own safety, and for that of her son Valentinian, the archbishop of Milan was dispatched, on two different embassies, to the court of Treves. He exercised, with equal firmness and dexterity, the powers of his spiritual and political characters; and perhaps contributed, by his authority and eloquence, to check the am∣bition of Maximus, and to protect the peace of Italy <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">Ambrose himself (tom. ii. epist. xxiv. p. 888—891.) gives the emperor a very spirited account of his own embassy.</NOTE>. Ambrose had devoted his life, and his abilities, to the service of the church.

midst of an orthodox people, had the misfortune of professing the Arian heresy, which she endea∣voured to instil into the mind of her son. Justina was persuaded, that a Roman emperor might claim, in his own dominions, the public exercise of his religion; and she proposed to the arch∣bishop, as a moderate and reasonable concession, that he should resign the use of a single church, either in the city or suburbs of Milan. But the conduct of Ambrose was governed by very dif∣ferent principles <NOTE N="63" PLACE="foot">His own representation of his principles and conduct (tom. ii. epist. xx. xxi. xxii. p. 852—880.) is one of the curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity. It contains two letters to his sister Mar∣cellina, with a petition to Valentinian, and the sermon <HI>de Basilicis non tradendis.</HI></NOTE>. The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caesar; but the churches were the houses of God; and, within the limits of his diocese, he himself, as the lawful successor of the apostles, was the only minister of God. The privileges of Christianity, temporal as well as spi∣ritual, were confined to the true believers; and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied, that his own theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy. The archbishop, who refused to hold any conference, or negociation, with the in∣struments of Satan, declared, with modest firm∣ness, his resolution to die a martyr, rather than to yield to the impious sacrilege; and Justina, who resented the refusal as an act of insolence and re∣bellion, hastily determined to exert the Imperial prerogative of her son. As she desired to perform her public devotions on the approaching festival
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
of Easter, Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council. He obeyed the summons with the respect of a faithful subject, but he was followed, without his consent, by an innumerable people: they pressed, with impetuous zeal, against the gates of the palace; and the affrighted ministers of Valentinian, instead of pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of Milan, humbly re∣quested that he would interpose his authority, to protect the person of the emperor, and to restore the tranquillity of the capital. But the promises which Ambrose received and communicated, were soon violated by a perfidious court; and, during six of the most solemn days, which Christian piety has set apart for the exercise of religion, the city was agitated by the irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism. The officers of the household were directed to prepare, first, the Portian, and afterwards, the new, <HI>Basilica,</HI> for the immediate reception of the emperor, and his mother. The splendid canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged in the customary manner; but it was found necessary to defend them, by a strong guard, from the insults of the populace.

<P>But while he laboured to restrain the effects of their zeal, the pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry and seditious tem∣per

of the people of Milan. The characters of Eve, of the wife of Job, of Jezabel, of Herodias, were indecently applied to the mother of the em∣peror; and her desire to obtain a church for the Arians, was compared to the most cruel perse∣cutions which Christianity had endured under the reign of Paganism. The measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the evil. A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the corporate body of merchants and manu∣facturers: an order was signified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and inferior ser∣vants, of the courts of justice, that, during the continuance of the public disorders, they should strictly confine themselves to their houses: and the ministers of Valentinian imprudently con∣fessed, that the most respectable part of the citi∣zens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop. He was again solicited to restore peace to his country, by a timely compliance with the will of his sovereign. The reply of Am∣brose was couched in the most humble and re∣spectful terms, which might, however, be inter∣preted as a serious declaration of civil war. <Q>"His life and fortune were in the hands of the em∣peror; but he would never betray the church of Christ, or degrade the dignity of the episcopal character.

A large body of Goths had marched to occupy the <HI>Basilica,</HI> which was the object of the dispute: and it might be expected from the Arian principles, and bar∣barous manners, of these foreign mercenaries, that they would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most sanguinary orders. They were encountered, on the sacred threshold, by the archbishop, who, thundering against them a sen∣tence of excommunication, asked them, in the tone of a father and a master, Whether it was to invade the house of God, that they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic? The suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more effectual negociation; and the empress was persuaded, by the advice of her wisest coun∣sellors, to leave the Catholics in possession of all the churches of Milan; and to dissemble, till a
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
more convenient season, her intentions of revenge. The mother of Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose; and the royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation, that his own servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent priest.</P>
<P>The laws of the empire, some of which were <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 386.</NOTE> inscribed with the name of Valentinian, still con∣demned the Arian heresy, and seemed to excuse the resistance of the Catholics. By the influence of Justina, an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the provinces which were subject to the court of Milan; the free exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the faith of Rimini; and the emperor declared, that all per∣sons who should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution, should be capitally punished, as the enemies of the public peace <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Sozomen alone (l. vii. c. 13.) throws this luminous fact into a dark and perplexed narrative.</NOTE>. The character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the suspicion, that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground, or at least a specious pre∣tence, to the Arian ministers; who watched the opportunity of surprising him in some act of dis∣obedience to a law, which he strangely represents as a law of blood and tyranny. A sentence of easy and honourable banishment was pronounced, which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without delay; whilst it permitted him to chuse the place of his exile, and the number of his companions. But the authroity of the saints, who have preached and practised the maxims of
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
passive loyalty, appeared to Ambrose of less mo∣ment than the extreme and pressing danger of the church. He boldly refused to obey; and his refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful people <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Excubabat pia plebs in ecclesiâ mori parata cum episcopo suo . . . Nos adhuc frigidi excitabamur tamen civitate attonitâ atque turbatâ. Augustin. Confession. l. ix. c. 7.</NOTE>. They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop; the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly secured; and the Imperial troops, who had formed the blockade, were unwilling to risk the attack, of that impregnable fortress. The numerous poor, who had been relieved by the liberality of Ambrose, embraced the fair occasion of signalising their zeal and gratitude; and as the patience of the multitude might have been exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils, he prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful institution of a loud and regular psalm∣ody. While he maintained this arduous con∣test, he was instructed, by a dream, to open the earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs, Gervasius and Protasius <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">Tillemont, Mem. Eccless. tom. ii. p. 78. 498. Many churches in Italy, Gaul, &amp;c. were dedicated to these unknown martyrs, of whom St. Gervase seems to have been more fortunate than his com∣panion.</NOTE>, had been deposited above three hundred years. Immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect skeletons were found <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot"><P>Invenimus mirae magnitudinis viros duos, ut prisca aetas fere∣bat.

<P>Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.</P></NOTE>, with the heads separated from their

The holy relics were presented, in solemn pomp, to the veneration of the people; and every circum∣stance of this fortunate discovery was admirably adapted to promote the designs of Ambrose. The bones of the martyrs, their blood, their garments, were supposed to contain a healing power; and the praeternatural influence was communicated to the most distant objects, without losing any part of its original virtue. The extraordinary cure of a blind man <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">Ambros. tom. ii. epist. xxii. p. 875. Augustin. Confes. l. ix. c. 7. de Civitat. Dei, l. xxii. c. 8.

I should recommend this miracle to our divines, if it did not prove the worship of relics, as well as the Nicene creed.</NOTE>, and the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs, appeared to justify the faith and sanctity of Ambrose; and the truth of those miracles is attested by Ambrose himself, by his secretary Paulinus, and by his proselyte, the ce∣lebrated Augustin, who, at that time, professed the art of rhetoric in Milan. The reason of the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of Justina and her Arian court; who derided the theatrical representations, which were exhibited by the contrivance, and at the expence, of the archbishop <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Paulin. in Vit. St. Ambros. c. 5. in Append. Benedict. p. 5.</NOTE>. Their effect, however, on the minds of the people, was rapid and irresistible; and the feeble sovereign of Italy found himself
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
unable to contend with the favourite of heaven. The powers likewise of the earth interposed in the defence of Ambrose: the disinterested advice of Theodosius was the genuine result of piety and friendship; and the mask of religious zeal con∣cealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the tyrant of Gaul <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Tillemont, Mem.

<P>The reign of Maximus might have ended in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximus invades Italy, A. D. 387, August.</NOTE> peace and prosperity, could he have contented himself with the possession of three ample coun∣tries, which now constitute the three most flou∣rishing kingdoms of modern Europe. But the aspiring usurper, whose sordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms, con∣sidered his actual forces as the instruments only of his future greatness, and his success was the immediate cause of his destruction. The wealth which he extorted <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">The modest censure of Sulpicius (Dialog. iii. 15.) inflicts a much deeper wound than the feeble declamation of Pacatus (xii. 25, 26.).</NOTE> from the oppressed provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employed in levying and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians, collected, for the most part, from the fiercest nations of Germany. The conquest of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations; and he secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth, whose government was abhorred and de∣spised by his Catholic subjects. But as Maximus wished to occupy, without resistance, the passes of
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
the Alps, he received, with perfidious smiles, Domninus of Syria, the ambassador of Valen∣tinian, and pressed him to accept the aid of a considerable body of troops, for the service of a Pannonian war. The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Esto tutior adversus hominem, pacis involucro tegentem, was the wise caution of Ambrose (tom. ii. p. 891.), after his return from his second embassy.</NOTE>; but the Syrian Dom∣ninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal favour of the court of Treves; and the council of Milan obstinately rejected the suspicion of dan∣ger, with a blind confidence, which was the effect, not of courage, but of fear. The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador; and they were admitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the Alps. But the crafty tyrant fol∣lowed, with hasty and silent footsteps, in the rear; and, as he diligently intercepted all intelligence of his motions, the gleam of armour, and the dust excited by the troops of cavalry, first announced the hostile approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan. In this extremity, Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence, and the per∣fidious arts of Maximus; but they wanted time, and force, and resolution, to stand against the Gauls and Germans, either in the field, or within the walls of a large and disaffected city. Flight was their only hope, Aquileia their only refuge; and as Maximus now displayed his genuine cha∣racter, the brother of Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same assassin.
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
Maximus entered Milan in triumph; and if the wise archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the usurper, he might indirectly contribute to the success of his arms, by incul∣cating, from the pulpit, the duty of resignation, rather than that of resistance <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">Baronius (A. D. 387. No 63.) applies to this season of pub∣lic distress some of the penitential sermons of the archbishop.</NOTE>. The unfortunate Justina reached Aquileia in safety; but she dis∣trusted the strength of the fortifications; she dreaded the event of a siege; and she resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius, whose power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the West. A vessel was secretly pro∣vided to transport the Imperial family; they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure harbours of Venetia, or Istria; traversed the whole extent of the Hadriatic and Ionian seas; turned the extreme promontory of Peloponnesus; and, after a long, but successful, navigation, re∣posed themselves in the port of Thessalonica. All the subjects of Valentinian deserted the cause of a prince, who, by his abdication, had absolved <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flight of Valen∣tinian.</NOTE> them from the duty of allegiance; and if the little city of Aemona, on the verge of Italy, had not presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory, Maximus would have obtained, without a struggle, the sole possession of the western em∣pire.</P>
<P>Instead of inviting his royal guests to the palace <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodo∣sius takes arms in the cause of Valen∣tinian. A. D. 387.</NOTE> of Constantinople, Theodosius had some unknown reasons to fix their residence at Thessalonica; but 
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
these reasons did not proceed from contempt or indifference, as he speedily made a visit to that city, accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate. After the first tender expres∣sions of friendship and sympathy, the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina, that the guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world, as well as in the next; and that the public profession of the Nicene faith, would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of her son, by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth and in heaven. The momentous question of peace or war was referred, by Theo∣dosius, to the deliberation of his council; and the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honour and justice, had acquired, since the death of Gratian, a considerable degree of addi∣tional weight. The persecution of the Imperial family, to which Theodosius himself had been in∣debted for his fortune, was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries. Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition of Maximus; and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures, instead of prolonging the blessings of peace, would expose the eastern empire to the danger of an hostile invasion. The Barbarians, who had passed the Danube, had lately assumed the character of soldiers and subjects, but their native fierceness was yet untamed; and the ope∣rations of a war, which would exercise their valour, and diminish their numbers, might tend to relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression. Notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons,
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
which were approved by a majority of the coun∣cil, Theodosius still hesitated, whether he should draw the sword in a contest, which could no longer admit any terms of reconciliation; and his mag∣nanimous character was not disgraced by the ap∣prehensions which he felt for the safety of his in∣fant sons, and the welfare of his exhausted people. In this moment of anxious doubt, while the fate of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man, the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the cause of her brother Valentinian <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">The flight of Valentinian, and the love of Theodosius for his sister, are related by Zosimus (l. iv. p. 263, 264.). Tillemont pro∣duces some weak and ambiguous evidence to antedate the second marriage of Theodosius (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 740.), and consequently to refute ces contes de Zosime, qui seroient trop con∣traires à la pieté de Theodose.</NOTE>. The heart of Theodosius was softened by the tears of beauty; his affections were insensibly engaged by the graces of youth and innocence; the art of Justina managed and directed the impulse of passion; and the celebra∣tion of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil war. The unfeeling critics, who consider every amorous weakness as an in∣delible stain on the memory of a great and ortho∣dox emperor, are inclined, on this occasion, to dispute the suspicious evidence of the historian Zosimus. For my own part, I shall frankly con∣fess, that I am willing to find, or even to seek, in the revolutions of the world, some traces of the mild and tender sentiments of domestic life; and, amidst the crowd of fierce and ambitious con∣querors, I can distinguish, with peculiar com∣placency,
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
a gentle hero, who may be supposed to receive his armour from the hands of love. The alliance of the Persian king was secured by the faith of treaties; the martial Barbarians were per∣suaded to follow the standard, or to respect the frontiers, of an active and liberal monarch; and the dominions of Theodosius, from the Euphrates to the Hadriatic, resounded with the preparations of war both by land and sea. The skilful dis∣position of the forces of the East seemed to mul∣tiply their numbers, and distracted the attention of Maximus. He had reason to fear, that a chosen body of troops, under the command of the in∣trepid Arbogastes, would direct their march along the banks of the Danube, and boldly pene∣trate through the Rhaetian provinces into the centre of Gaul. A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbours of Greece and Epirus, with an apparent design, that as soon as the passage had been opened by a naval victory, Valentinian, and his mother, should land in Italy, proceed, with∣out delay, to Rome, and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire. In the mean while, Theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and disciplined army, to encounter his un∣worthy rival, who, after the siege of Aemona, had fixed his camp in the neighbourhood of Siscia, a city of Pannonia, strongly fortified by the broad and rapid stream of the Save.</P>
<P>The veterans, who still remembered the long <NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat and death of Maximus, A. D. 388. June—August.</NOTE> resistance, and successive resources, of the tyrant Magnentius, might prepare themselves for the labours of three bloody campaigns. But the con∣test

with his successor, who, like him, had usurped the throne of the West, was easily decided in the term of two months <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">See Godefroy's Chronology of the Laws, Cod. Theodos. tom. i. p. cxix.</NOTE>, and within the space of two hundred miles. The superior genius of the emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus; who, in this important crisis, shewed himself destitute of military skill, or personal cou∣rage; but the abilities of Theodosius were se∣conded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and active cavalry. The Huns, the Alani, and, after their example, the Goths them∣selves, were formed into squadrons of archers; who fought on horseback, and confounded the steady valour of the Gauls and Germans, by the rapid motions of a Tartar war. After the fatigue of a long march, in the heat of summer, they spurred their foaming horses into the waters of the Save, swam the river in the presence of the enemy, and instantly charged and routed the troops who guarded the high ground on the oppo∣site side. Marcellinus, the tyrant's brother, ad∣vanced to support them with the select cohorts, which were considered as the hope and strength of the army. The action, which had been inter∣rupted by the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a sharp conflict, the sur∣viving remnant of the bravest soldiers of Maxi∣mus threw down their arms at the feet of the con∣queror. Without suspending his march, to re∣ceive the loyal acclamations of the citizens of Aemona, Theodosius pressed forwards, to ter∣minate
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the summit of the Julian Alps, he de∣scended with such incredible speed into the plain of Italy, that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the first day; and Maximus, who found himself encompassed on all sides, had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city. But the gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy; and the despair, the disaffection, the indifference of the soldiers and people, hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus. He was dragged from his throne, rudely stripped of the Imperial orna∣ments, the robe, the diadem, and the purple slippers; and conducted, like a malefactor, to the camp and presence of Theodosius, at a place about three miles from Aquileia. The behaviour of the emperor was not intended to insult, and he shewed some disposition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the West, who had never been his per∣sonal enemy, and was now become the object of his contempt. Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are ex∣posed; and the spectacle of a proud competitor, now prostrate at his feet, could not fail of pro∣ducing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked by his regard for public justice, and the memory of Gra∣tian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the soldiers, who drew him out of the Im∣perial presence, and instantly separated his head from his body. The intelligence of his defeat

and death was received with sincere, or well∣dissembled, joy: his son Victor, on whom he had conferred the title of Augustus, died by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold Arbogastes; and all the military plans of Theodosius were successfully executed. When he had thus ter∣minated the civil war, with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally expect, he em∣ployed the winter months of his residence at Milan, to restore the state of the afflicted pro∣vinces; and early in the spring he made, after the example of Constantine and Constantius, his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">Besides the hints which may be gathered from chronicles and ecclesiastical history, Zosimus (l. iv. p. 259—267.), Orosius (l. vii. c. 35.), and Pacatus (in Panegyr.

<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
wisdom of his laws, and the success of his arms, rendered his administration respectable in the eyes both of his subjects, and of his enemies. He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life, which seldom hold their residence in the palaces of kings. Theodosius was chaste and temperate: he enjoyed, without excess, the sensual and social pleasures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous passions was never diverted from their lawful objects. The proud titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of a faithful husband, an indulgent father; his uncle was raised, by his affectionate esteem, to the rank of a second parent: Theodosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and sister; and the expressions of his regard were extended to the most distant and obscure branches of his nu∣merous kindred. His familiar friends were ju∣diciously selected from among those persons, who, in the equal intercourse of private life, had ap∣peared before his eyes without a mask: the con∣sciousness of personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he had forgotten all the injuries, while he most grate∣fully remembered all the favours and services, which he had received before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire. The serious, or lively, tone of his conversation, was adapted to the age, the rank, or the character, of his sub∣jects whom he admitted into his society; and the affability of his manners displayed the image of his mind. Theodosius respected the simplicity of
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
the good and virtuous; every art, every talent, of an useful, or even of an innocent, nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and, except the heretics, whom he persecuted with implacable hatred, the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by the limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire may assuredly suffice to occupy the time, and the abi∣lities, of a mortal: yet the diligent prince, with∣out aspiring to the unsuitable reputation of pro∣found learning, always reserved some moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of read∣ing. History, which enlarged his experience, was his favourite study. The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years, pre∣sented him with a various and splendid picture of human life; and it has been particularly observed, that whenever he perused the cruel acts of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla, he warmly expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity and freedom. His disinterested opinion of past events was usefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodosius has deserved the singular commendation, that his virtues always seemed to expand with his fortune: the season of his pro∣sperity was that of his moderation; and his cle∣mency appeared the most conspicuous after the danger and success of the civil war. The Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat of the victory; and a small number of the most obnoxious criminals suffered the punish∣ment of the law. But the emperor shewed him∣self much more attentive to relieve the innocent,
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
than to chastise the guilty. The oppressed sub∣jects of the West, who would have deemed them∣selves happy in the restoration of their lands, were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to their losses; and the liberality of the conqueror supported the aged mother, and educated the orphan daughters, of Maximus <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Ambros. tom. ii. epist. xl. p. 955. Pacatus, from the want of skill, or of courage, omits this glorious circumstance.</NOTE>. A character thus accomplished, might almost excuse the ex∣travagant supposition of the orator Pacatus; that, if the elder Brutus could be permitted to revisit the earth, the stern republican would abjure, at the feet of Theodosius, his hatred of kings; and ingenuously confess, that such a monarch was the most faithful guardian of the happiness and dignity, of the Roman people <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">Pacat. in Panegyr.

<P>Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the re∣public must have discerned two essential imper∣fections, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Faults of Theodo∣sius.</NOTE> which might, perhaps, have abated his recent love of despotism.

was capable of the most vigorous exertions; but, as soon as the design was accomplished, or the danger was surmounted, the hero sunk into in∣glorious repose; and, forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his people, resigned him∣self to the enjoyment of the innocent, but trifling, pleasures of a luxurious court. The natural dis∣position of Theodosius was hasty and choleric; and, in a station where none could resist, and few would dissuade, the fatal consequence of his re∣sentment, the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the consciousness of his infirmity, and of his power. It was the constant study of his life to suppress, or regulate, the intemperate sallies of passion; and the success of his efforts enhanced the merit of his clemency. But the painful vir∣tue which claims the merit of victory, is ex∣posed to the danger of deseat; and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an act of cruelty, which would stain the annals of Nero or Domitian. Within the space of three years, the inconsistent historian of Theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of Antioch, and the inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica.</P>

excited the murmurs of the two unsuccessful con∣gregations. The exigencies of the Gothic war, and the inevitable expence that accompanied the conclusion of the peace, had constrained the em∣peror to aggravate the weight of the public im∣positions; and the provinces of Asia, as they had not been involved in the distress, were the less inclined to contribute to the relief, of Europe. The auspicious period now approached of the tenth year of his reign; a festival more grateful to the soldiers, who received a liberal donative, than to the subjects, whose voluntary offerings had been long since converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burthen. The edicts of taxation interrupted the repose, and pleasures, of Antioch; and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant crowd; who, in pathetic, but, at first, in respectful, language, solicited the redress of their grievances. They were gradually incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers, who treated their complaints as a criminal resistance; their satirical wit degenerated into sharp and angry invectives; and, from the subordinate powers of government, the invectives of the people insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor himself. Their fury, provoked by a feeble opposition, discharged itself on the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26.</NOTE> images of the Imperial family, which were erected, as objects of public veneration, in the most conspicuous places of the city. The statues of Theodosius, of his father, of his wife Flaccilla, of his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, were
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
insolently thrown down from their pedestals, broken in pieces, or dragged with contempt through the streets: and the indignities which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty, sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the populace.

The noblest, and most wealthy, of the citizens of Antioch, appeared before them in chains; the examination was assisted by the use of torture, and their sentence was pronounced or suspended, according to the judgment of these extraordinary magistrates.

Theodosius had already subsided; the deputies of the people, both the bishop and the orator, had obtained a favourable audience; and the re∣proaches of the emperor were the complaints of injured friendship, rather than the stern menaces of pride and power. A free and general pardon was granted to the city and citizens of Antioch; the prison-doors were thrown open; the senators, who despaired of their lives, recovered the pos∣session of their houses and estates; and the capital of the East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and splendour. Theodosius con∣descended to praise the senate of Constantinople, who had generously interceded for their distressed brethren: he rewarded the eloquence of Hilarius with the government of Palestine; and dismissed the bishop of Antioch with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude. A thousand new statues arose to the clemency of Theodosius; the <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE> applause of his subjects was ratified by the appro∣bation of his own heart; and the emperor con∣fessed, that, if the exercise of justice is the most important duty, the indulgence of mercy is the most exquisite pleasure, of a sovereign <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">The sedition of Antioch is represented in a lively, and almost dramatic, manner, by two orators, who had their respective shares of interest and merit.

more dreadful consequences. That great city, the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces, had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by strong fortifications, and a numerous gar∣rison. Botheric, the general of those troops, and, as it should seem from his name, a Barbarian, had among his slaves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The insolent and brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric; and he sternly rejected the importunate clamours of the multitude, who, on the day of the public games, lamented the absence of their favourite; and con∣sidered the skill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue. The resent∣ment of the people was embittered by some pre∣vious disputes; and, as the strength of the gar∣rison had been drawn away for the service of the Italian war, the feeble remnant, whose numbers were reduced by desertion, could not save the un∣happy general from their licentious fury. Bo∣theric, and several of his principal officers, were inhumanly murdered: their mangled bodies were dragged about the streets; and the emperor, who then resided at Milan, was surprised by the intel∣ligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of Thessalonica. The sentence of a dis∣passionate judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of the crime; and the merit of Botheric might contribute to exasperate the grief and indignation of his master. The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was im∣patient of the dilatory forms of a judicial enquiry;
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
and he hastily resolved, that the blood of his lieu∣tenant should be expiated by the blood of the guilty people. Yet his mind still fluctuated be∣tween the counsels of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the bishops had almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a general pardon; his passion was again inflamed by the flattering suggestions of his minister Rufinus; and, after Theodosius had dispatched the messen∣gers of death, he attempted, when it was too late, to prevent the execution of his orders. The pu∣nishment of a Roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of the Barbarians; and the hostile preparations were concerted with the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal con∣spiracy. The people of Thessalonica were trea∣cherously invited, in the name of their sovereign, to the games of the Circus: and such was their in∣satiate avidity for those amusements, that every consideration of fear, or suspicion, was disre∣guarded by the numerous spectators. As soon as the assembly was complete, the soldiers, who had secretly been posted round the circus, received the signal, not of the races, but of a general massacre. The promiscuous carnage continued three hours, without discrimination of strangers or natives, of age or sex, of innocence or guilt; the most mo∣derate accounts state the number of the slain at seven thousand; and it is affirmed by some writers, that more than fifteen thousand victims were sacri∣ficed to the manes of Botheric. A foreign mer∣chant, who had probably no concern in his murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth, to sup∣ply
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
the place of <HI>one</HI> of his two sons; but, while the father hesitated with equal tenderness, while he was doubtful to chuse, and unwilling to condemn, the soldiers determined his suspense, by plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the defenceless youths. The apology of the as∣sassins, that they were obliged to produce the pre∣scribed number of heads, serves only to increase, by an appearance of order and design, the horrors of the massacre, which was executed by the com∣mands of Theodosius. The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent residence at Thessalonica. The situation of the unfortunate city, the aspect of the streets and buildings, the dress and faces of the inhabitants, were familiar, and even present, to his imagination; and Theo∣dosius possessed a quick and lively sense of the existence of the people whom he destroyed <NOTE N="91" PLACE="foot">The original evidence of Ambrose (tom. ii. epist. li. p. 998.), Augustin (de Civitat.

to the archbishop; who acted from the laudable persuasion, that every measure of civil government may have some connection with the glory of God, and the interest of the true religion. The monks and populace of Callinicum, an ob∣scure town on the frontier of Persia, excited by their own fanaticism, and by that of their bishop, had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the Va∣lentinians, and a synagogue of the Jews. The seditious prelate was condemned, by the magi∣strate of the province, either to rebuild the syna∣gogue, or to repay the damage; and this mode∣rate sentence was confirmed by the emperor.

The emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and by those of his spiritual fa∣ther; and, after he had bewailed the mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury, he proceeded, in the accustomed manner, to perform his devotions in the great church of Milan. He was stopped in the porch by the archbishop; who, in the tone and language of an ambassador of Heaven, declared to his sovereign, that private contrition was not sufficient to atone for a public fault, or to appease the justice of the offended Deity. Theodosius humbly represented, that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide, David, the man after God's own heart, had been guilty, not only of murder, but of adultery. <Q>"You have imitated David in his crime, imitate then his repentance,"</Q> was the reply of the un∣daunted Ambrose. The rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted; and the public pennance of the emperor Theodosius has been re∣corded as one of the most honourable events in the annals of the church. According to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline, which were esta∣blished in the fourth century, the crime of homi∣cide was expiated by the penitence of twenty

It was sufficient, that the emperor of the Romans, stripped of the ensigns of royalty, should appear in a mournful and sup∣pliant posture; and that, in the midst of the church of Milan, he should humbly solicit, with sighs and tears, the pardon of his sins <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">The pennance of Theodosius is authenticated by Ambrose (tom. vi. de Obit.

<P>After the defeat and death of the tyrant of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Generosity of Theo∣dosius, A. D. 388—391.</NOTE> Gaul, the Roman world was in the possession of Theodosius. He derived from the choice of Gratian his honourable title to the provinces of the East: he had acquired the West by the right of conquest; and the three years, which he spent in Italy, were usefully employed to restore the
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
authority of the laws; and to correct the abuses, which had prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of Maximus, and the minority of Va∣lentinian. The name of Valentinian was regularly inserted in the public acts: but the tender age, and doubtful faith, of the son of Justina, appeared to require the prudent care of an orthodox guardian; and his specious ambition might have excluded the unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and almost without a murmur, from the admini∣stration, and even from the inheritance, of the empire. If Theodosius had consulted the rigid maxims of interest and policy, his conduct would have been justified by his friends; but the gene∣rosity of his behaviour on this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most inveterate enemies. He seated Valentinian on the throne of Milan; and, without stipulating any present or future advantages, restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces from which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus. To the restitution of his ample patrimony, Theodosius added the free and generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps, which his successful valour had recovered from the assassin of Gratian <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is the niggard praise of Zosimus himself (l. iv. p. 267.).

and, in the peaceful possession of the East, in∣sensibly relapsed into his former habits of luxury and indolence. Theodosius discharged his obli∣gation to the brother, he indulged his conjugal tenderness to the sister, of Valentinian: and poste∣rity, which admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation, must applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory.</P>
<P>The empress Justina did not long survive her return to Italy; and, though she beheld the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Valen∣tinian, A.

The pernicious attachment to the Arian sect, which Valentinian had imbibed from her example and instructions, were soon erased by the lessons of a more orthodox education.

His real merit, and apparent fidelity, had gained the confidence both of the prince and people; his boundless liberality corrupted the allegiance of the troops; and, whilst he was universally esteemed as the pillar of the state, the bold and crafty Barbarian was secretly determined, either to rule, or to ruin, the empire of the West. The important commands of the army were distributed among the Franks; the creatures of Arbogastes were promoted to all the honours and offices of the civil government; the progress of the conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of Valentinian; and the emperor, without power, and without intelligence, insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent condition of a cap∣tive <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. 9. p. 165. in the second volume of the Historians of France) has preserved a curious fragment of Sul∣picius Alexander, an historian far more valuable than himself.</NOTE>.

He secretly invited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office of a mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity, and the guardian of his safety. He contrived to ap∣prise the emperor of the East of his helpless situa∣tion; and he declared, that, unless Theodosius could speedily march to his assistance, he must attempt to escape from the palace, or rather prison, of Vienna in Gaul, where he had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile faction. But the hopes of relief were distant, and doubt∣ful; and, as every day furnished some new pro∣vocation, the emperor, without strength or coun∣sel, too hastily resolved to risk an immediate con∣test with his powerful general. He received Arbogastes on the throne; and, as the count approached with some appearance of respect, de∣livered to him a paper, which dismissed him from all his employments. <Q>"My authority" replied Arbogastes with insulting coolness, "does not depend on the smile, or the frown, of a mo∣narch;"</Q> and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground. The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards, which he struggled to draw from its scabbard; and it was not without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using the deadly weapon against his enemy, or against himself.

Five days of the week he spent in prayer and meditation; but on Satur∣days and Sundays he regularly opened a small window, and gave audience to the crowd of sup∣pliants, who successively flowed from every part of the Christian world. The eunuch of Theodo∣sius approached the window with respectful steps, proposed his questions concerning the event of the civil war, and soon returned with a favourable oracle, which animated the courage of the em∣peror by the assurance of a bloody, but infallible, victory <NOTE N="114" PLACE="foot">Sozomen, l. vii. c. 22.

This narrow theatre of the war, circumscribed by the Alps and the Hadriatic, did not allow much room for the operations of military skill; the spirit of Ar∣bogastes would have disdained a pardon; his guilt extinguished the hope of a negociation: and Theodosius was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge, by the chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian. Without weighing the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts, the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications of his rivals, assigned the post of honourable danger to the Goths, and cherished a secret wish, that the bloody conflict might di∣minish the pride and numbers of the conquerors. Ten thousand of those auxiliaries, and Bacurius, general of the Iberians, died bravely on the field of battle. But the victory was not purchased by their blood: the Gauls maintained their advan∣tage; and the approach of night protected the disorderly flight, or retreat, of the troops of Theodosius.

The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp; whilst the active and vigilant Ar∣bogastes secretly detached a considerable body of troops to occupy the passes of the mountains, and to encompass the rear of the Eastern army. The dawn of day discovered to the eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger: but his apprehensions were soon dispelled, by a friendly message from the leaders of those troops, who expressed their inclination to desert the stand∣ard of the tyrant. The honourable and lucra∣tive rewards, which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy, were granted without hesitation; and as ink and paper could not easily be procured, the emperor subscribed, on his own tablets, the ratification of the treaty. The spirit of his sol∣diers was revived by this seasonable reinforce∣ment: and they again marched, with confidence, to surprise the camp of a tyrant, whose principal officers appeared to distrust, either the justice, or the success, of his arms.

The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their position from the impetuosity of the wind, which blew a cloud of dust in the faces of the enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested their weapons from their hands, and diverted, or repelled, their ineffectual javelins. This accidental advantage was skilfully improved; the violence of the storm was magnified by the superstitious terrors of the Gauls; and they yielded without shame to the invisible powers of heaven, who seemed to mili∣tate on the side of the pious emperor. His vic∣tory was decisive; and the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the difference of their characters. The rhetorician Eugenius, who had almost acquired the dominion of the world, was reduced to implore the mercy of the conqueror; and the unrelenting soldiers separated his head from his body, as he lay prostrate at the feet of Theodosius. Arbogastes, after the loss of a bat∣tle, in which he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general, wandered several days among the mountains. But when he was con∣vinced, that his cause was desperate, and his escape impracticable, the intrepid Barbarian imi∣tated the example of the ancient Romans, and
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
turned his sword against his own breast. The fate of the empire was determined in a narrow corner of Italy; and the legitimate successor of the house of Valentinian embraced the archbishop of Milan, and graciously received the submission of the provinces of the West. Those provinces were involved in the guilt of rebellion; while the inflexible courage of Ambrose alone had resisted the claims of successful usurpation. With a manly freedom, which might have been fatal to any other subject, the archbishop rejected the gifts of Eugenius, declined his correspondence, and withdrew himself from Milan, to avoid the odious presence of a tyrant; whose downfal he predicted in disoreet and ambiguous language. The merit of Ambrose was applauded by the conqueror, who secured the attachment of the people by his alliance with the church: and the clemency of Theodosius is ascribed to the humane intercession of the archbishop of Milan <NOTE N="121" PLACE="foot">The events of this civil war are gathered from Ambrose (tom. ii. epist. lxii. p. 1022.), Paulinus (in Vit.

death, only four months after his victory, was considered by the people as an unforeseen and fatal event, which destroyed, in a moment, the hopes of the rising generation.

The strength of Theodosius was unable to support the sudden and violent transition from the palace to the camp; and the increasing symptoms of a dropsy an∣nounced the speedy dissolution of the emperor. The opinion, and perhaps the interest, of the public had confirmed the division of the Eastern and Western empires; and the two royal youths, Arcadius and Honorius, who had already ob∣tained, from the tenderness of their father, the title of Augustus, were destined to fill the thrones of Constantinople and of Rome. Those princes were not permitted to share the danger and glory of the civil war <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">Zosimus supposes, that the boy Honorius accompanied his father (l. iv. p. 280.).

The arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a splendid exhibition of the games of the Circus;
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
and the emperor, through he was oppressed by the weight of his disorder, contributed by his pre∣sence to the public joy. But the remains of his strength were exhausted by the painful effort, which he made, to assist at the spectacles of the morning. Honorius supplied, during the rest of the day, the place of his father; and the great Theodosius expired in the ensuing night. Not∣withstanding the recent animosities of a civil war, his death was universally lamented. The Bar∣barians, whom he had vanquished, and the churchmen, by whom he had been subdued, ce∣lebrated, with loud and sincere applause, the qualities of the deceased emperor, which ap∣peared the most valuable in their eyes.

An historian, perpetually adverse to the fame of Theodosius, has exaggerated his vices, and their pernicious effects; he boldly asserts, that every rank of sub∣jects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign; that every species of corruption pol∣luted the course of public and private life; and that the feeble restraints of order and decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that de∣generate
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
spirit, which sacrifices, without a blush the consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and appetite <NOTE N="124" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. iv. p. 244.</NOTE>. The com∣plaints of contemporary writers, who deplore the increase of luxury, and depravation of manners, are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation. There are few observers, who possess a clear and comprehensive view of the re∣volutions of society; and who are capable of discovering the nice and secret springs of action, which impel, in the same uniform direction, the blind and capricious passions of a multitude of individuals. If it can be affirmed, with any de∣gree of truth, that the luxury of the Romans was more shameless and dissolute in the reign of Theo∣dosius than in the age of Constantine, perhaps, or of Augustus, the alteration cannot be ascribed to any beneficial improvements, which had gra∣dually increased the stock of national riches. A long period of calamity or decay must have checked the industry, and diminished the wealth, of the people; and their profuse luxury must have been the result of that indolent despair, which enjoys the present hour, and declines the thoughts of futurity. The uncertain condition of their property discouraged the subjects of Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious undertakings which require an im∣mediate expence, and promise a slow and distant advantage. The frequent examples of ruin and desolation tempted them not to spare the remains
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
of a patrimony, which might, every hour, be∣come the prey of the rapacious Goth. And the mad prodigality which prevails in the confusion of a shipwreck, or a siege, may serve to explain the progress of luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation.</P>
<P>The effeminate luxury, which infected the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The in∣fantry lay aside their armour.</NOTE> manners of courts and cities, had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the camps of the legions: and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military writer, who had accurate∣ly studied the genuine and ancient principles of Roman discipline. It is the just and important observation of Vegetius, that the infantry was invariably covered with defensive armour, from the foundation of the city, to the reign of the emperor Gratian. The relaxation of discipline, and the disuse of exercise, rendered the soldiers less able, and less willing, to support the fatigues of the service; they complained of the weight of the armour, which they seldom wore; and they successively obtained the permission of laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy weapons of their ancestors, the short sword, and the formidable <HI>pilum,</HI> which had subdued the world, insensibly dropped from their feeble hands. As the use of the shield is incompatible with that of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to suffer, either the pain of wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative. The cavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani, had felt the benefits, and adopted the use,
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
of defensive armour; and, as they excelled in the management of missile weapons, they easily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, whose heads and breasts were exposed, without defence, to the arrows of the Barbarians. The loss of armies, the destruction of cities, and the dishonour of the Roman name, ineffectually soli∣cited the successors of Gratian to restore the hel∣mets and cuirasses of the infantry. The enervated soldiers abandoned their own, and the public, defence; and their pusillanimous indolence may be considered as the immediate cause of the down∣fal of the empire <NOTE N="125" PLACE="foot">Vegetius, de Re Militari, l. i. c. 10.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. <HI>Final Destruction of Paganism.—Introduction of the Worship of Saints, and Relics, among the Christians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theo∣dosius, is perhaps the only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular su∣perstition <NOTE PLACE="marg">The de∣struction of the Pagan religion. A. D. 378—395.</NOTE>; and may therefore deserve to be con∣sidered, as a singular event in the history of the human mind. The Christians, more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent delays of Constantine, and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or secure, as long as their adver∣saries were permitted to exist. The influence, which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodosius, was employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their Imperial proselytes. Two specious principles of religious jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous conclusion, against the subjects of the empire, who still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: <HI>that,</HI> the magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and, <HI>that</HI> the idolatrous worship of fa∣bulous deities, and real daemons, is the most abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator. The laws of Moses, and the
<PB N="92" REF="100"/>
examples of Jewish history <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">St. Ambrose (tom. ii. de Obit. Theodos. p. 1208.) expressly praises and recommends the zeal of Josiah in the destruction of idola∣try. The language of Julius Firmicus Maternus on the same sub∣ject (de Errore Profan. Relig. p. 467, edit. Gronov.) is piously in∣human. Nec filio jubet (the Mosaic Law) parci, nec fratri, et per amatam conjugem gladium vindicem ducit, &amp;c.</NOTE>, were hastily, per∣haps erroneously, applied, by the clergy, to the mild and universal reign of Christianity <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Bayle (tom. ii. p. 406, in his Commentaire Philosophique) justifies, and limits, these intolerant laws by the temporal reign of Jehovah over the Jews. The attempt is laudable.</NOTE>. The zeal of the emperors was excited to vindicate their own honour, and that of the Deity: and the temples of the Roman world were subverted, about sixty years after the conversion of Con∣stantine.</P>
<P>From the age of Numa, to the reign of Gra∣tian, <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Paganism at Rome.</NOTE> the Romans preserved the regular succes∣sion of the several colleges of the sacerdotal order <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See the outlines of the Roman hierarchy in Cicero (de Legibus, ii. 7, 8.), Livy (i. 20.), Dionysius Harlicarnassensis (l. ii. p. 119—129. edit.

Fifteen PONTIFFS exercised their su∣preme jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated to the service of the gods; and the various questions which perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system, were submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal. Fifteen grave and learned AUGURS observed the face of the heavens, and prescribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sybilline books (their name of QUIN∣DECEMVIRS
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
was derived from their number) oc∣casionally consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of contingent, events. Six VESTALS devoted their virginity to the guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the duration of Rome; which no mortal had been suffered to behold with impunity <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">These mystic, and perhaps imaginary, symbols have given birth to various fables and conjectures. It seems probable, that the Palladium was a small statute (three cubits and a half high) of Minerva, with a lance and distaff; that it was usually inclosed in a <HI>seria,</HI> or barrel; and that a similar barrel was placed by its side, to disconcert curiosity, or sacrilege. See Mezeriac (Comment. sur les Epitres d'Ovide, tom. i. p. 60—66.), and Lipsius (tom. iii. p. 610. de Vestâ, &amp;c. c. 10.).</NOTE>. Seven EPULOS prepared the table of the gods, conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the cere∣monies of the annual festival. The three FLA∣MENS of Jupiter, of Mars, and of Quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the three most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of Rome and of the universe. The KING of the SACRIFICES represented the person of Numa, and of his successors, in the religious functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. The confraternities of the SALIANS, the LUPERCALS, &amp;c. practised such rites, as might extort a smile of contempt from every reasonable man, with a lively confidence of re∣commending themselves to the favour of the im∣mortal gods. The authority, which the Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of the republic, was gradually abolished by the establishment of monarchy, and the removal of
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
the seat of empire. But the dignity of their sacred character was still protected by the laws and manners of their country; and they still con∣tinued, more especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital, and sometimes in the pro∣vinces, the rights of their ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction. Their robes of purple, chariots of state, and sumptuous entertainments, at∣tracted the admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated lands, and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally supported the splendour of the priesthood, and all the expences of the religious worship of the state. As the service of the altar was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans, after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of pontiff, or of augur; the seats of <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cicero, frankly (ad Atticum, l. ii. epist. 5.), or indirectly (ad Familiar. l. xv. epist. 4.), confesses, that the <HI>Augurate</HI> is the supreme object of his wishes.

The fifteen priests, who composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished rank as the compa∣nions of their sovereign; and the Christian em∣perors condescended to accept the robe and en∣signs, which were appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff. But when Gratian ascended the throne, more scrupulous, or more enlightened,
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
he sternly rejected those prophane symbols <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. iv. p. 249, 250.

Paganism was still the constitu∣tional religion of the senate. The hall, or temple, in which they assembled, was adorned by the statue and altar of victory <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">This statue was transported from Tarentum to Rome, placed in the <HI>Guria Julia</HI> by Caesar, and decorated by Augustus with the spoils of Egypt.</NOTE>; a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing gar∣ments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her out-stretched hand <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Prudentius (l. ii. in initio) has drawn a very awkward portrait of Victory: but the curious reader will obtain more satisfaction from Montfaucon's Antiquities (tom. i. p. 341.)</NOTE>.

The orator, whose petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had assumed. He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his so∣vereign; humbly declares, that prayers and en∣treaties are his only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. Symmachus en∣deavours to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory; he insinuates, that the confiscation of the revenues, which were consecrated to the ser∣vice of the gods, was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character; and he main∣tains, that the Roman sacrifices would be de∣prived of their force and energy, if they were no longer celebrated at the expence, as well as in the name, of the republic. Even scep∣ticism is made to supply an apology for su∣perstition. The great and incomprehensible

Where reason cannot instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful at∣tachment to those rites, and opinions, which have received the sanction of ages. If those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity, if the devout people has frequently obtained the bles∣sings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods, it must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary practice; and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any rash innova∣tions. The test of antiquity and success was ap∣plied with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and ROME herself, the caelestial genius that presided over the fates of the city, is intro∣duced by the orator to plead her own cause before the tribunal of the emperors. <Q>"Most excellent princes," says the venerable matron, "fathers of your country! pity and respect my age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of piety.

He justly derides the absurd reverence for antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements of art, and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism. From thence gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone, he pronounces, that Christianity alone is the doctrine of truth and salvation; and that every mode of Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of error, to the abyss of eternal perdi∣tion <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">See Ambrose (tom. ii. epist. xvii, xviii. p. 825—833.).

It is whimsical enough, that Montesquieu (Considerations, &amp;c. c. xix. tom. iii. p. 487.) should overlook the two professed antagonists of Symmachus; and amuse himself with descanting on the more remote and indirect con∣futations of Orosius, St. Augustin, and Salvian.</NOTE>.

Arguments like these, when they were suggested by a favourite bishop, had power to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth of a con∣queror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariot-wheels of Theodo∣sius <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">See Prudentius (in Symmach. l. i. 545, &amp;c.).

His attack was resisted, by the skill and solidity, with which the temple of Jupiter had been constructed.

The rites of Pagan superstition, which might seem less bloody and atrocious, are abolished, as highly injurious to the truth and honour of religion, luminaries, gar∣lands, frankincense, and libations of wine, are specially enumerated and condemned; and the harmless claims of the domestic genius, of the household gods, are included in this rigorous pro∣scription. The use of any of these profane and illegal ceremonies, subjects the offender to the forfeiture of the house, or estate, where they have been performed; and if he has artfully chosen the property of another for the scene of his impiety, he is compelled to discharge, with∣out delay, a heavy fine of twenty-five pounds of gold, or more than one thousand pounds sterling. A fine, not less considerable, is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies of religion, who shall neglect the duty of their respective stations, either to reveal, or to punish, the guilt of idolatry.

The experience of ages had betrayed the weakness, as well as folly, of Paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already exposed, to the greatest part of mankind, the vanity of idols; and the declining sect, which still adhered to their wor∣ship, might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obscurity, the religious customs of their an∣cestors.

The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly imitated the postures, and recited the prayers, of the faithful, they sa∣tisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere invocation of the gods of antiquity <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Libanius (pro Templis, p. 17, 18.) mentions, without cen∣sure, the occasional conformity, and as it were theatrical play, of these hypocrites.</NOTE>.

The coffins of Gamaliel, of his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when the fourth coffin, which con∣tained the remains of Stephen, was shewn to the light, the earth trembled, and an odour, such as that of paradise, was smelt, which instantly cured the various diseases of seventy-three of the assist∣ants.

he has selected those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of the martyr. Many prodigies were omitted, or for∣gotten; and Hippo had been less favourably treated than the other cities of the province.

Sometimes, indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of a less exalted kind: they viewed, with partial affection, the places which had been consecrated by their birth, their residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their re∣lics. The meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may be deemed unworthy of a ce∣lestial breast; yet the saints themselves conde∣scended to testify their grateful approbation of the liberality of their votaries: and the sharpest bolts of punishment were hurled against those impious wretches, who violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their supernatural power <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">Fleury, Discours sur l'Hist.

If they approached the balustrade of the altar, they made their way through the prostrate crowd, consisting, for the most part, of strangers and pilgrims, who resorted to the city on the vigil of the seast; and who al∣ready felt the strong intoxication of fanaticism, and, perhaps, of wine.

The Christians frequented the tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more especially of tem∣poral, blessings.

Whenever they undertook any distant or dangerous journey, they requested, that the holy martyrs would be their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned, without having experienced any mis∣fortune, they again hastened to the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of those heavenly patrons. The walls were hung round with symbols of the favours, which they had re∣ceived; eyes, and hands, and feet, of gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion, represented the image, the attributes, and the miracles of the tutelar saint.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. <HI>Final Division of the Roman Empire between the Sons of Theodosius.—Reign of Arcadius and Ho∣norius.—Administration of Rufinus and Stilicho.—Revolt and Defeat of Gildo in Africa.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE genius of Rome expired with Theo∣dosius; the last of the successors of Au∣gustus and Constantine, who appeared in the field <NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the empire between Arcadius and Hono∣rius, A. D. 395. Jan. 17.</NOTE> at the head of their armies, and whose authority was universally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire. The memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the feeble and inexperienced youth of his two sons. After the death of their father, Arcadius and Honorius were saluted, by the unanimous consent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the East, and of the West; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by every order of the state; the senates of old and new Rome, the clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people. Ar∣cadius, who then was about eighteen years of age, was born in Spain, in the humble habitation of a private family. But he received a princely education in the palace of Constantinople; and his inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia and Aethiopia. His younger brother, Honorius, assumed, in the eleventh year
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
of his age, the nominal government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom, were opposed, on one side, to the Caledonians, and on the other to the Moors. The great and martial praefecture of Illyricum was divided between the two princes: the defence and possession of the pro∣vinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, still belonged to the western empire; but the two large dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, which Gratian had entrusted to the valour of Theodosius, were for ever united to the empire of the East. The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now separates the Germans and the Turks; and the respective advantages of territory, riches, populousness, and military strength, were fairly balanced and compensated, in this final and permanent division of the Roman em∣pire. The hereditary sceptre of the sons of Theo∣dosius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of their father; the generals and ministers had been accustomed to adore the majesty of the royal in∣fants; and the army and people were not admo∣nished of their rights, and of their power, by the dangerous example of a recent election. The gradual discovery of the weakness of Arcadius and Honorius, and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to obliterate the deep and early impressions of loyalty. The sub∣jects of Rome, who still reverenced the persons, or rather the names, of their sovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who opposed,

<P>Theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and admi∣nistration of Rufi∣nus, A.

He was raised, by just degrees, to the station of master of the offices. In the exercise of his various functions, so essen∣tially connected with the whole system of civil go∣vernment, he acquired the confidence of a mo∣narch, who soon discovered his diligence and capacity in business, and who long remained ig∣norant of the pride, the malice, and the covetous∣ness of his disposition. These vices were concealed beneath the mask of profound dissimulation <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">A passage of Suitlas is expressive of his profound dissimulation; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>;
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
his passions were subservient only to the passions of his master: yet, in the horrid massacre of Thes∣salonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury, without imitating the repentance, of Theodosius. The minister, who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind, never forgave the appearance of an injury; and his personal enemies had for∣feited, in his opinion, the merit of all public ser∣vices. Promotus, the master-general of the in∣fantry, had saved the empire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but he indignantly supported the pre-eminence of a rival, whose character and profession he despised; and, in the midst of a public council, the impatient soldier was pro∣voked to chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the favourite. This act of violence was repre∣sented to the emperor as an insult, which it was incumbent on <HI>his</HI> dignity to resent. The dis∣grace and exile of Promotus were signified by a peremptory order, to repair, without delay, to a military station on the banks of the Danube: and the death of that general (though he was slain in a skirmish with the Barbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. iv. p. 272, 273.</NOTE>. The sacrifice of an hero gratified his revenge; the honours of the consulship elated his vanity; but his power was still imperfect and precarious, as long as the im∣portant posts of praefect of the East, and of praefect of Constantinople, were filled by Tatian <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, who describes the fall of Tatian and his son (l. iv. p. 273, 274.), asserts their innocence: and even <HI>his</HI> testimony may outweigh the charges of their enemies (Cod.

his son Proculus; whose united authority ba∣lanced, for some time, the ambition and favour of the master of the offices. The two praefects were accused of rapine and corruption in the ad∣ministration of the laws and finances. For the trial of these illustrious offenders, the emperor constituted a special commission: several judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of in∣justice; but the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the president alone, and that pre∣sident was Rufinus himself. The father, stripped of the praefecture of the East, was thrown into a dungeon; but the son, conscious that few mini∣sters can be found innocent, where an enemy is their judge, had secretly escaped; and Rufinus must have been satisfied with the least obnoxious victim, if despotism had not condescended to em∣ploy the basest and most ungenerous artifice. The prosecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation, which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favourable event; his con∣fidence was fortified by the solemn assurances, and perfidious oaths, of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred name of Theodosius him∣self; and the unhappy father was at last persuaded to recal, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus. He was instantly seized, examined, condemned, and beheaded, in one of the suburbs of Constan∣tinople, with a precipitation which disappointed
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>
the clemency of the emperor. Without respect∣ing the misfortunes of a consular senator, the cruel judges of Tatian compelled him to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cord was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment when he expected, and perhaps desired, the relief of a speedy death, he was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><L>—Juvenum rorantia colla</L>

The new praefect of the East (for Rufinus instantly succeeded to the vacant honours of his adversary) was not diverted, however, by the most criminal pursuits, from the performance of the religious duties, which in that age were considered as the most essential to salvation. In the suburb of Chal∣cedon, surnamed the <HI>Oak,</HI> he had built a magni∣ficent villa; to which he devoutly added a stately church; consecrated to the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, and continually sanctified by the prayers, and pennance, of a regular society of monks. A numerous, and almost general, synod of the bishops of the eastern empire was summoned to celebrate, at the same time, the dedication of the church, and the baptism of the founder. This double ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp; and when Rufinus was purified, in the holy font, from all the sins that he had hitherto committed, a venerable hermit of Egypt rashly proposed him∣self as the sponsor of a proud and ambitious statesman <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ammonius . . . Rufinum propriis manibus suscepit sacro fonte mundatum. See Rosweyde's Vitae Patrum, p. 947. Sozomen (l. viii. c. 17.) mentions the church and monastery; and Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. ix. p. 593.) records this synod, in which St. Gregory of Nyssa performed a conspicuous part.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The character of Theodosius imposed on his <NOTE PLACE="marg">He op∣presses the East, A.

A tyrannical statute always proves the existence of ty∣ranny; but a laudable edict may only contain the specious professions, or ineffectual wishes, of the prince, or his ministers. This, I am afraid, is a just, though mortifying, canon of criticism.</NOTE>. But the absence, and, soon afterwards, the death, of the emperor, con∣firmed the absolute authority of Rufinus over the person and dominions of Arcadius; a feeble youth, whom the imperious praefect considered as his pupil, rather than his sovereign. Regardless of the public opinion, he indulged his passions with∣out remorse, and without resistance; and his ma∣lignant and rapacious spirit rejected every passion that might have contributed to his own glory, or the happiness of the people. His avarice <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot"><L>—fluctibus auri</L>

<P>This character (Claudian. in Rufin. i. 184.—220.) is confirmed by Jerom, a disinterested witness (dedecus insatiabilis avaritiae, tom. i. ad Heliodor. p. 26.), by Zosumus (l. v. p. 286.), and by Suidas, who copied the history of Eunapius.</P></NOTE>, which seems to have prevailed, in his corrupt mind, over every other sentiment, attracted the wealth of the East, by the various arts of partial, and general, extortion; oppressive taxes, scan∣dalous bribery, immoderate fines, unjust confis∣cation, forced or fictitious testaments, by which the tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of strangers, or enemies; and the public sale of justice, as well as of favour, which he in∣stituted in the palace of Constantinople. The
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>
ambitious candidate eagerly solicited, at the ex∣pence of the fairest part of his patrimony, the ho∣nours and emoluments of some provincial go∣vernment: the lives and fortunes of the unhappy people were abandoned to the most liberal pur∣chaser; and the public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal, whose punishment was profitable only to the prae∣fect of the East, his accomplice and his judge. If avarice were not the blindest of the human passions, the motives of Rufinus might excite our curiosity; and we might be tempted to inquire, with what view he violated every principle of humanity and justice, to accumulate those immense treasures, which he could not spend without folly, nor possess without danger. Perhaps he vainly ima∣gined, that he laboured for the interest of an only daughter, on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil, and the august rank of Empress of the East. Perhaps he deceived himself by the opinion, that his avarice was the instrument of his ambition. He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis, which should no longer depend on the caprice of the young em∣peror; yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people, by the liberal distri∣bution of those riches, which he had acquired with so much toil, and with so much guilt. The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only the reproach, and envy, of ill-gotten wealth; his de∣pendents served him without attachment; the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of servile fear.

Lucian proclaimed to the East, that the praefect, whose industry was much abated in the dispatch of ordinary business, was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge. Lucian, the son of the praefect Florentius, the oppressor of Gaul, and the enemy of Julian, had employed a considerable part of his inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the friendship of Rufinus, and the high office of Count of the East. But the new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and of the times; disgraced his benefactor, by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration; and presumed to re∣fuse an act of injustice, which might have tended to the profit of the emperor's uncle. Arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult; and the praefect of the East resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance, which he meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed with incessant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles, from Constantinople to Antioch, entered the capital of Syria at the dead of night, and spread universal consternation among a people, ignorant of his design, but not ignorant of his character. The count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dragged, like the vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus. Not∣withstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity, which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuser, Lucian was condemned, almost with∣out a trial, to suffer a cruel and ignominious pu∣nishment. The ministers of the tyrant, by the order, and in the presence, of their master, beat

him on the neck with leather thongs, armed at the extremities with lead; and when he fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in a close litter, to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city. No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act, the sole object of his expedition, than he returned, amidst the deep, and silent, curses of a trembling people, from Antioch to Constantinople; and his dili∣gence was accelerated, by the hope of accomplish∣ing, without delay, the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the East <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot"><L>—Caetera segnis;</L>

<P>But Rufinus soon experienced, that a prudent <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is dis∣appointed, by the marriage of Arca∣dius, A. D. 395.

While the praefect satiated his revenge at Antioch, a secret conspiracy of the favourite eunuchs, directed by the great chamberlain Eu∣tropius, undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople. They discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of Rufinus, who had been chosen, without his consent, for his bride; and they contrived to substitute in her place the fair Eudoxia, the daughter of Bauto <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. iv. p. 243.) praises the valour, prudence, and in∣tegrity, of Bauto the Frank.

a general of the Franks in the service of Rome; and who was educated, since the death of her fa∣ther, in the family of the sons of Promotus. The young emperor, whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious care of his tutor Arsenius <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">Arsenius escaped from the palace of Constantinople, and passed fifty-five years in rigid pennance in the monasteries of Egypt. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 676—702.; and Fleury, Hist. Eccles. tom. v. p. 1, &amp;c.: but the latter, for want of authentic materials, has given too much credit to the legend of Metaphrastes.</NOTE>, eagerly listened to the artful and flattering descrip∣tions of the charms of Eudoxia: he gazed with impatient ardour on her picture, and he under∣stood the necessity of concealing his amorous de∣signs from the knowledge of a minister, who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his happiness. Soon after the return of Rufinus, the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the people of Constantinople, who prepared to celebrate, with false and hollow acclamations, the fortune of his daughter. A splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued, in hymeneal pomp, from the gates of the palace; bearing aloft the diadem, the robes, and the in∣estimable ornaments, of the future empress. The solemn procession passed through the streets of the city, which were adorned with garlands, and filled with spectators; but, when it reached the house of the sons of Promotus, the principal eunuch re∣spectfully entered the mansion, invested the fair Eudoxia with the Imperial robes, and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arca∣dius <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">This story (Zosimus, l. v. p. 290.) proves that the hymeneal rites of antiquity were still practised, without idolatry, by the Christians of the East; and the bride was <HI>forcibly</HI> conducted from the house of her parents to that of her husband. Our form of marriage requires, with less delicacy, the express and public consent of a vir∣gin.</NOTE>. The secresy, and success, with which
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
this conspiracy against Rufinus had been con∣ducted, imprinted a mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister, who had suffered him∣self to be deceived, in a post where the arts of deceit and dissimulation constitute the most di∣stinguished merit. He considered, with a mix∣ture of indignation and fear, the victory of an aspiring eunuch, who had secretly captivated the favour of his sovereign; and the disgrace of his daughter, whose interest was inseparably con∣nected with his own, wounded the tenderness, or, at least, the pride, of Rufinus. At the moment when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the house of his implacable enemies, was introduced into the Imperial bed; and Eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit, to improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful husband. The emperor would soon be instructed to hate, to fear, and to destroy, the powerful subject, whom he had injured; and the consciousness of guilt deprived Rufinus of every hope, either of safety or comfort, in the retire∣ment of a private life. But he still possessed the most effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of oppressing his enemies. The prae∣fect still exercised an uncontrouled authority over the civil and military government of the East:
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
and his treasures, if he could resolve to use them, might be employed to procure proper instruments, for the execution of the blackest designs, that pride, ambition, and revenge, could suggest to a desperate statesman. The character of Rufinus seemed to justify the accusations, that he conspired against the person of his sovereign, to seat himself on the vacant throne; and that he had secretly in∣vited the Huns, and the Goths, to invade the pro∣vinces of the empire, and to increase the public confusion.

His silence concerning the family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof, that his patron was neither able, nor desirous, to boast of a long series of illustrious pro∣genitors; and the slight mention of his father, an officer of Barbarian cavalry, in the service of Valens, seems to countenance the assertion, that the general, who so long commanded the armies of Rome, was descended from the savage and per∣fidious race of the Vandals <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Vandalorum, imbellis, avarae, perfidae, et dolosae, gentis, ge∣nere editus.

court, as an act of hostility. The prompt and unexpected obedience of the general of the West, convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and modera∣tion; and, as he had already engaged the affec∣tion of the Eastern troops, he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design, which might be accomplished in his absence, with less danger perhaps, and with less reproach. Sti∣licho left the command of the troops of the East to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity he firmly re∣lied; with an assurance, at least, that the hardy Barbarian would never be diverted from his pur∣pose by any consideration of fear or remorse. The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the ene∣my of Stilicho, and of Rome; and such was the general hatred which Rufinus had excited, that the fatal secret, communicated to thousands, was faithfully preserved during the long march from Thessalonica to the gates of Constantinople. As soon as they had resolved his death, they con∣descended to flatter his pride; the ambitious prae∣fect was seduced to believe, that those powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and the treasures which he distribut∣ed, with a tardy and reluctant hand, were accept∣ed by the indignant multitude, as an insult, rather than as a gift. At the distance of a mile from the capital, in the field of Mars, before the pa∣lace of Hebdomon, the troops halted: and the emperor, as well as his minister, advanced, ac∣cording to ancient custom, respectfully to salute the power which supported their throne. As Rufinus passed along the ranks, and disguised,
<PB N="158" REF="166"/>
with studied courtesy, his innate haughtiness, the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left, and inclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms. Before he could reflect on the danger of his situation, Gainas gave the signal of death; a daring and forward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty praefect, and Rufinus fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of the affrighted emperor. If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder of Rufinus. His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the populace of either sex, who hastened in crouds, from every quarter of the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty minister, at whose frown they had so lately trembled. His right hand was cut off, and carried through the streets of Constantinople, in cruel mockery, to extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant, whose head was publicly exposed, borne aloft on the point of a long lance <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">The <HI>dissection</HI> of Rufinus, which Claudian performs with the savage coolness of an anatomist (in Rufin. ii. 405—415.), is like∣wise specified by Zosimus and Jerom (tom. i. p. 26.).</NOTE>.

Even Stilicho did not derive from the murder of his rival, the fruit which he had proposed; and though he gratified his revenge, his ambition was disappointed. Under the name of a favourite, the weakness of Arcadius required a master; but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius, who had obtained his domestic confidence; and the emperor contemplated, with terror and aversion, the stern genius of a foreign warrior. Till they were divided by the jealousy of power, the sword of Gainas, and the charms of Eudoxia, supported the favour of the great chamberlain of the palace: the perfidious Goth, who was appointed master-general of the East, betrayed, without scruple, the interest of his be∣nefactor; and the same troops, who had so lately massacred the enemy of Stilicho, were engaged to support, against him, the independence of the throne of Constantinople. The favourites of Arcadius fomented a secret and irreconcileable war against a formidable hero, who aspired to govern, and to defend, the two empires of Rome, and the two sons of Theodosius. They incessantly laboured, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive him of the esteem of the prince, the respect of the people, and the friendship of the Barbarians. The life of Stilicho was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired assassins; and a decree was obtained, from the senate of Con∣stantinople,
<PB N="161" REF="169"/>
to declare him an enemy of the re∣public, and to confiscate his ample possessions in the provinces of the East. At a time when the only hope of delaying the ruin of the Roman name, depended on the firm union, and recipro∣cal aid, of all the nations to whom it had been gradually communicated, the subjects of Arca∣dius and Honorius were instructed, by their re∣spective masters, to view each other in a foreign, and even hostile, light; to rejoice in their mutual calamities, and to embrace, as their faithful allies, the Barbarians, whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">See Claudian (i Cons.

During those twelve years, the provinces of Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant, who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger, with the partial resentments of domestic faction. The forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison; and if the trembling guests, who were invited to the table of Gildo, presumed to express their fears, the insolent suspicion served only to excite his fury, and he loudly summoned the ministers of death.

In the civil war between Theodosius and Eugenius, the count, or rather the sovereign, of Africa, maintained a haughty and suspicious neutrality; refused to assist either of the contending parties with troops or vessels, expected the declaration of fortune, and reserved
<PB N="164" REF="172"/>
for the conqueror, the vain professions of his alle∣giance. Such professions would not have satis∣fied the master of the Roman world: but the death of Theodosius, and the weakness and dis∣cord of his sons, confirmed the power of the Moor; who condescended, as a proof of his mo∣deration, to abstain from the use of the diadem, and to supply Rome with the customary tribute, or rather subsidy, of corn. In every division of the empire, the five provinces of Africa were in∣variably assigned to the West; and Gildo had consented to govern that extensive country in the name of Honorius; but his knowledge of the character and designs of Stilicho, soon engaged him to address his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign. The ministers of Arcadius em∣braced the cause of a perfidious rebel; and the delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of Africa to the empire of the East, tempted them to assert a claim, which they were incapable of sup∣porting, either by reason, or by arms <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Inque tuam sortem numerosas transtulit urbes.

The subsistence of Rome depended on the harvests of Africa; and it was evident, that a declaration of war would be the signal of famine.

The affliction of the father was suspended only by the desire of revenge. The vigilant Stilicho already prepared to collect the naval and military forces of the Western empire; and he had resolved, if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal and doubtful war, to march against him in person.

The predecessors of Honorius were accustomed to animate, by their example, or at least by their presence, the valour of the legions; and the dates of their laws attest the perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the Roman world. But the son of Theodosius passed the slumber of his life, a captive in his palace, a stranger in his country, and the patient, almost the indifferent, spectator of the ruin of the West∣ern empire, which was repeatedly attacked, and finally subverted, by the arms of the Barbarians.

<P>IF the subjects of Rome could be ignorant of their obligations to the great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully the spirit and abilities of their deceased emperor had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of the Goths, A.

The Barbarian auxiliaries erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds. Their countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of the last treaty, to a life of tran∣quillity and labour, deserted their farms at the first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down. The barriers of the Danube were thrown open; the savage warriors of Scythia issued from their forests; and the uncommon severity of the winter allowed the poet to remark,<Q> "that they

The interruption, or at least the diminution, of the subsidy, which the Goths had received from the prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the spe∣cious pretence of their revolt: the affront was embittered by their contempt for the unwarlike sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was in∣flamed by the weakness, or treachery, of the mi∣nister of Arcadius. The frequent visits of Ru∣finus to the camp of the Barbarians, whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate, were considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspond∣ence: and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude or of policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare the private estates of the unpopular praefect. The Goths, instead
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>
of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their chiefs, were now directed by the bold and artful genius of Alaric. That renowned leader was descended from the noble race of the Balti <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baltha,</HI> or <HI>bold:</HI> origo mirifica, says Jorandes (c. 29.).

The lords of Baux, near Arles, and of seventy-nine sub∣ordinate places, were independent of the counts of Provence (Lon∣guerue, Description de la France, tom. i. p. 357.).</NOTE>; which yielded only to the royal dignity of the Amali: he had solicited the command of the Roman armies; and the Imperial court pro∣voked him to demonstrate the folly of their re∣fusal, and the importance of their loss. What∣ever hopes might be entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. In the midst of a divided court, and a discontented people, the emperor Arcadius was terrified by the aspect of the Gothic arms: but the want of wisdom and valour was supplied by the strength of the city; and the fortifications, both of the sea and land, might securely brave the impotent and random darts of the Barbarians. Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had hitherto escaped the ravages of war <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. v. p. 293—295.) is our best guide for the conquest of Greece: but the hints and allusion of Claudian are so many rays of historic light.</NOTE>.</P>

The character of the civil and military officers, on whom Rufinus had devolved the government of Greece, confirmed the public suspicion, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alaric marches into Greece, A.

The proconsul Antiochus was the unworthy son of a respectable father; and Gerontius, who commanded the pro∣vincial troops, was much better qualified to exe∣cute the oppressive orders of a tyrant, than to de∣fend, with courage and ability, a country most re∣markably fortified by the hand of nature. Alaric had traversed, without resistance, the plains of Macedonia and Thessaly, as far as the foot of Mount Oeta, a steep and woody range of hills, almost impervious to his cavalry. They stretched from East to West, to the edge of the sea-shore; and left, between the precipice and the Malian Gulf, an interval of three hundred feet, which, in some places, was contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Compare Herodotus (l. vii. c. 176.) and Livy (xxxvi. 15.).

In this narrow pass of Thermopylae, where Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans had gloriously devoted their lives, the Goths might have been stopped, or destroyed, by a skilful general; and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have kindled some sparks of military ardour in the breasts of the degenerate Greeks.

The travellers, who visited Greece se∣veral years afterwards, could easily discover the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths; and Thebes was less indebted for her pre∣servation to the strength of her seven gates, than to the eager haste of Alaric, who advanced to oc∣cupy the city of Athens, and the important har∣bour of the Piraeus. The same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and danger of a siege, by the offer of a capitulation; and as soon as the Athenians heard the voice of the Gothic herald, they were easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth, as the ransom of the city of Minerva, and its inhabitants. The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with mu∣tual fidelity. The Gothic prince, with a small and select train, was admitted within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the bath, accepted a splendid banquet which was provided by the magistrate, and affected to shew that he was not ignorant of the manners of civil∣ised nations <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>In obedience to Jerom, and Claudian (in Rufin. l. ii. 191.), I have mixed some darker colours in the mild representation of Zosi∣mus, who wished to soften the calamities of Athens.</P>

from the promontory of Sunium to the town of Megara, was blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the comparison of a contemporary philosopher, Athens itself resembled the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim. The distance between Megara and Corinth could not much exceed thirty miles; but the <HI>bad road,</HI> an expressive name, which it still bears among the the Greeks, was, or might easily have been made, impassable for the march of an enemy.

The vases and statues were distributed among the Barbarians, with more re∣gard to the value of the materials, than to the elegance of the workmanship; the female cap∣tives submitted to the laws of war; the enjoy∣ment of beauty was the reward of valour; and the Greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse, which was justified by the example of the heroic times <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Homer perpetually describes the exemplary patience of these female captives, who gave their charms, and even their hearts, to the murderers of their fathers, brothers, &amp;c.

Alaric appears to have seized the favourable moment to execute one of those hardy enterprises, in which the abilities of a general are displayed with more genuine lustre, than in the tumult of a day of battle. To extri∣cate himself from the prison of Peloponnesus, it was necessary that he should pierce the intrench∣ments which surrounded his camp; that he should perform a difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles, as far as the Gulf of Corinth; and that he should transport his troops, his captives, and his

This un∣fortunate delay allowed Alaric sufficient time to conclude the treaty, which he secretly negociated, with the ministers of Constantinople.

<P>A Grecian philosopher <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Synesius passed three years (A. D. 397—400.) at Constan∣tinople, as deputy from Cyrene to the emperor Arcadius. He pre∣sented him with a crown of gold, and pronounced before him the instructive oration de Regno (p. 1—32. edit. Petav. Paris 1612.). The Philosopher was made bishop of Ptolemais, A.

Synesius observes, and deplores the fatal abuse, which the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the military service. The citizens, and subjects, had purchased an exemp∣tion from the indispensable duty of defending
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>
their country; which was supported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. The fugitives of Scy∣thia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious dig∣nities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who disdained the salutary restraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the riches, than to imitate the arts, of a people, the object of their contempt and hatred; and the power of the Goths was the stone of Tantalus, perpetually suspended over the peace and safety of the devoted state. The measures, which Synesius recommends, are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot. He exhorts the em∣peror to revive the courage of his subjects, by the example of manly virtue; to banish luxury from the court, and from the camp; to substitute, in the place of the Barbarian mercenaries, an army of men, interested in the defence of their laws and of their property; to force, in such a mo∣ment of public danger, the mechanic from his shop, and the philosopher from his school; to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of plea∣sure, and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the laborious husbandman. At the head of such troops, who might deserve the name, and would display the spirit, of Romans, he ani∣mates the son of Theodosius to encounter a race of Barbarians, who were destitute of any real courage; and never to lay down his arms, till he had chaced them far away into the solitudes of Scythia; or had reduced them to the state of ig∣nominious servitude, which the Lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the captive Helots <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Synesius de Regno, p. 21—26.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="188" REF="196"/>
court of Arcadius indulged the zeal, applauded the eloquence, and neglected the advice, of Sy∣nesius. Perhaps the philosopher, who addresses the emperor of the East, in the language of reason and virtue, which he might have used to a Spartan king, had not condescended to form a practicable scheme, consistent with the temper, and circumstances, of a degenerate age. Perhaps the pride of the ministers, whose business was seldom interrupted by reflection, might re∣ject, as wild and visionary, every proposal, which exceeded the measure of their capacity, and de∣viated from the forms and precedents of office. While the oration of Synesius, and the downfal of the Barbarians, were the topics of popular conver∣sation, an edict was published at Constantinople, which declared the promotion of Alaric to the rank of master-general of the Eastern Illyricum. The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had respected the faith of treaties, were justly indig∣nant, that the ruin of Greece and Epirus should be so liberally rewarded. The Gothic conqueror was received as a lawful magistrate, in the cities which he had so lately besieged. The fathers, whose sons he had massacred, the husbands, whose wives he had violated, were subject to his autho∣rity: and the success of his rebellion encouraged the ambition of every leader of the foreign mer∣cenaries. The use to which Alaric applied his new command, distinguishes the firm and judi∣cious character of his policy. He issued his orders to the four magazines and manufactures of offen∣sive and defensive arms, Margus, Ratiaria, Nais∣sus,
<PB N="189" REF="197"/>
and Thessalonica, to provide his troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords, and spears; the unhappy provincials were com∣pelled to forge the instruments of their own de∣struction; and the Barbarians removed the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the ef∣forts of their courage <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot"><L>—qui foedera rumpit</L>

His march, perhaps from Thes∣salonica, through the warlike and hostile country of Pannonia, as far as the foot of the Julian Alps; his passage of those mountains, which were strongly guarded by troops and intrench∣ments; the siege of Aquileia, and the conquest of the provinces of Istria and Venetia, appear to have employed a considerable time. Unless his operations were extremely cautious and slow, the

the general of the West could only pro∣mise, that, if the court of Milan would maintain their ground during his absence, he would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic king. Without losing a moment (while each moment was so important to the public safety) Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian lake, ascended the mountains of ice and snow, amidst the severity of an Alpine winter, and sud∣denly repressed, by his unexpected presence, the enemy, who had disturbed the tranquillity of Rhaetia <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">The face of the country, and the hardiness of Stilicho, are finely described (de Bell.

The cohorts, who were delivered from the neighbour∣ing foe, diligently repaired to the Imperial stand∣ard; and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the West, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of Honorius and of Italy. The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned; and the safety of Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans, and the ancient terror of the Roman name.

and a numerous body of the cavalry of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor, who anxiously expected the return of his general. The prudence and vigour of Stili∣cho were conspicuous on this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the weakness of the falling empire. The legions of Rome, which had long since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars; and it was found impos∣sible, without exhausting and exposing the pro∣vinces, to assemble an army for the defence of Italy.</P>
<P>When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sove∣reign <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is pur∣sued and besieged by the Goths.</NOTE> in the unguarded palace of Milan, he had probably calculated the term of his absence, the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles that might retard their march. He principally de∣pended on the rivers of Italy, the Adige, the Mincius, the Oglio, and the Addua; which, in the winter or spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting of the snows, are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous torrents <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Every traveller must recollect the face of Lombardy (see Fon∣tenelle, tom. v. p. 279.), which is often tormented by the capricious and irregular abundance of waters.

In the last, and almost hope∣less extremity, after the Barbarians had already proposed the indignity of a capitulation, the Im∣perial captive was suddenly relieved by the fame, the approach, and at length the presence of the hero, whom he had so long expected. At the head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, Stilicho swam the stream of the Addua, to gain the time which he must have lost in the attack of the bridge; the passage of the Po was an enterprise of much less hazard and difficulty; and the suc∣cessful action, in which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of Asta, re∣vived the hopes, and vindicated the honour, of Rome. Instead of grasping the fruit of his vic∣tory, the Barbarian was gradually invested, on every side, by the troops of the West, who suc∣cessively issued through all the passes of the Alps; his quarters were straightened; his convoys were intercepted; and the vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers. A military council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the Gothic nation; of aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in furs, and whose stern countenances were marked with honourable wounds. They weighed the glory of persisting
<PB N="198" REF="206"/>
in their attempt against the advantage of securing their plunder; and they recommended the pru∣dent measure of a seasonable retreat. In this im∣portant debate, Alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of Rome; and after he had reminded his countrymen of their atchievements and of their designs, he concluded his animating speech, by the solemn and positive assurance, that he was resolved to find in Italy, either a kingdom, or a grave <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot"><L>Hanc ego vel victor regno, vel morte tenebo</L>

In this engage∣ment, which was long maintained with equal courage and success, the chief of the Alani, whose diminutive and savage form concealed a magna∣nimous soul, approved his suspected loyalty, by the zeal with which he fought, and fell, in the service of the republic; and the fame of this gal∣lant Barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of Claudian, since the poet, who cele∣brates his virtue, has omitted the mention of his name. His death was followed by the flight and dismay of the squadrons which he command∣ed; and the defeat of the wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of Alaric, if Stilicho had not immediately led the Roman and Barbarian infantry to the attack.

gates of Rome. The capital was saved by the active and incessant diligence of Stilicho: but he respected the despair of his enemy; and, instead of committing the fate of the republic to the chance of another battle, he proposed to purchase the absence of the Barbarians. The spirit of Alaric would have rejected such terms, the per∣mission of a retreat, and the offer of a pension, with contempt and indignation; but he exercised a limited and precarious authority over the inde∣pendent chieftains, who had raised him, for <HI>their</HI> service, above the rank of his equals; they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful gene∣ral, and many of them were tempted to consult their interest by a private negociation with the minister of Honorius. The king submitted to the voice of his people, ratified the treaty with the empire of the West, and repassed the Po, with the remains of the flourishing army which he had led into Italy. A considerable part of the Roman forces still continued to attend his mo∣tions; and Stilicho, who maintained a secret cor∣respondence with some of the Barbarian chiefs, was punctually apprised of the designs that were formed in the camp and council of Alaric. The king of the Goths, ambitious to signalize his re∣treat by some splendid atchievement, had re∣solved to occupy the important city of Verona, which commands the principal passage of the Rhaetian Alps; and, directing his march through the territories of those German tribes, whose al∣liance would restore his exhausted strength, to in∣vade, on the side of the Rhine, the wealthy and

unsuspecting provinces of Gaul. Ignorant of the treason, which had already betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise, he advanced towards the passes of the mountains, already possessed by the Imperial troops; where he was exposed, almost at the same instant, to a general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear. In this bloody action, at a small distance from the walls of Verona, the loss of the Goths was not less heavy than that which they had sustained in the defeat of Pollentia; and their valiant king, who escaped by the swiftness of his horse, must either have been slain or made prisoner, if the hasty rashness of the Alani had not disappointed the measures of the Roman general. Alaric secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks; and prepared himself, with undaunted resolution, to maintain a siege against the superior numbers of the enemy, who invested him on all sides. But he could not oppose the destructive progress of hunger and disease; nor was it possible for him to check the continual desertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians. In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage, or in the moderation of his adversary; and the retreat of the Gothic king was considered as the deliver∣ance of Italy <NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">The Getic war and the sixth consulship of Honorius, obscurely connect the events of Alaric's retreat and losses.</NOTE>.

The emperor resided several months in the capital, and every part of his behaviour was regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy, the senate, and the people of Rome. The clergy was edified by his frequent visits, and liberal gifts, to the shrines of the apostles. The senate, who, in the triumphal procession, had been excused from the humiliat∣ing ceremony of preceding on foot the Imperial chariot, was treated with the decent reverence which Stilicho always affected for that assembly. The people was repeatedly gratified by the atten∣tion and courtesy of Honorius in the public games, which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence not unworthy of the specta∣tor. As soon as the appointed number of chariot∣races was concluded, the decoration of the Circus was suddenly changed; the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various and splendid entertainment; and the chace was succeeded by a military dance, which seems, in the lively description of Claudian, to present the image of a modern tournament.</P>

to the natives of Umbria. Augustus, who had observed the opportunity of the place, prepared, at the distance of three miles from the old town, a capacious harbour, for the reception of two hundred and fifty ships of war. This naval esta∣blishment, which included the arsenals and maga∣zines, the barracks of the troops, and the houses of the artificers, derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the Roman fleet; the intermediate space was soon filled with buildings and inhabitants, and the three extensive and po∣pulous quarters of Ravenna gradually contri∣buted to form one of the most important cities of Italy. The principal canal of Augustus poured a copious stream of the waters of the Po through the midst of the city, to the entrance of the har∣bour; the same waters were introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls; they were distributed, by a thousand subordinate canals, into every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of small islands; the com∣munication was maintained only by the use of boats and bridges; and the houses of Ravenna, whose appearance may be compared to that of Venice, were raised on the foundation of wooden piles. The adjacent country, to the distance of many miles, was a deep and impassable morass; and the artificial causeway, which connected Ra∣venna with the continent, might be easily guard∣ed, or destroyed, on the approach of an hostile army. These morasses were interspersed, how∣ever, with vineyards; and though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops, the town enjoyed
<PB N="209" REF="217"/>
a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Martial (epigram iii. 56, 57.) plays on the trick of the knave, who had sold him wine instead of water; but he seriously declares, that a cistern, at Ravenna, is more valuable than a vineyard.

The air, instead of receiving the sickly, and almost pestilential, exhalations of low and marshy grounds, was distinguished, like the neigh∣bourhood of Alexandria, as uncommonly pure and salubrious; and this singular advantage was ascribed to the regular tides of the Hadriatic, which swept the canals, interrupted the unwhole∣some stagnation of the waters, and floated, every day, the vessels of the adjacent country into the heart of Ravenna. The gradual retreat of the sea has left the modern city at the distance of four miles from the Hadriatic; and as early as the fifth or sixth century of the Christian aera, the port of Augustus was converted into pleasant orchards; and a lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet once rode at anchor <NOTE N="62" PLACE="foot">The fable of Theodore and Honoria, which Dryden has so ad∣mirably transplanted from Bocaccio (Giornata iii. novell. viii.) was acted in the wood of <HI>Chiassi,</HI> a corrupt word from <HI>Classis,</HI> the naval station, which, with the intermediate road or suburb, the <HI>Via Caesaris,</HI> constituted the <HI>triple</HI> city of Ravenna.</NOTE>.

The Chinese annals, as they have been interpreted by the learned industry of the present age, may be usefully applied to re∣veal the secret and remote causes of the fall of the Roman empire. The extensive territory to the north of the great wall, was possessed, after the flight of the Huns, by the victorious Sienpi; who were sometimes broken into independent tribes, and sometimes re-united under a supreme chief; till at length styling themselves <HI>Topa,</HI> or masters of the earth, they acquired a more solid consistence, and a more formidable power. The Topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of
<PB N="211" REF="219"/>
their arms; they invaded China in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and these for∣tunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the vanquished people, founded an Imperial dynasty, which reigned near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of the monarchy. Some generations before they as∣cended the throne of China, one of the Topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a slave of the name of Moko, renowned for his valour; but who was tempted, by the fear of punishment, to desert his standard, and to range the desert at the head of an hundred followers. This gang of rob∣bers and outlaws swelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous people, distinguished by the appella∣tion of <HI>Geougen;</HI> and their hereditary chieftains, the posterity of Moko the slave, assumed their rank among the Scythian monarchs. The youth of Toulun, the greatest of his descendants, was exercised by those misfortunes which are the school of heroes. He bravely struggled with ad∣versity, broke the imperious yoke of the Topa, and became the legislator of his nation, and the conqueror of Tartary. His troops were distributed into regular bands of an hundred and of a thou∣sand men; cowards were stoned to death; the most splendid honours were proposed as the re∣ward of valour; and Toulun, who had know∣ledge enough to despise the learning of China, adopted only such arts and institutions as were favourable to the military spirit of his govern∣ment.

The countries towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes; and their hasty flight, which they soon converted into a bold at∣tack, would more naturally be directed towards the rich and level plains, through which the Vistula gently flows into the Baltic sea.

The examples of Caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the Roman warriors; and the fortifications of Dyrra∣chium, which connected twenty-four castles, by a perpetual ditch and rampart of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which might confine, and starve, the most numerous host of Barbarians <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot"><L>Franguntur montes, planumque per ardua Caesar</L>

The despair of the hungry Barbarians would precipitate them against the fortifications of Stilicho; the general might sometimes indulge the ardour of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly pressed to assault the camp of the Germans; and these various incidents might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the narrative of Zosimus, and the Chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">See Zosimus, l. v. p. 331. and the chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus.</NOTE>.

but the causes of separation are obvious and forcible; the pride of birth, the insolence of va∣lour, the jealousy of command, the impatience of subordination, and the obstinate conflict of opi∣nions, of interests, and of passions, among so many kings and warriors, who were untaught to yield, or to obey.

Yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of Germany, who inhabited the banks of the Rhine, their hopes were disappoint∣ed. The Alemanni preserved a state of inactive neutrality; and the Franks distinguished their zeal and courage in the defence of the empire. In the rapid progress down the Rhine, which was the first act of the administration of Stilicho, he had applied himself, with peculiar attention, to secure the alliance of the warlike Franks, and to remove the irreconcileable enemies of peace and of the republic. Marcomir, one of their kings, was publicly convicted, before the tribunal of the Roman magistrate, of violating the faith of trea∣ties. He was sentenced to a mild, but distant, exile, in the province of Tuscany; and this de∣gradation of the regal dignity was so far from ex∣citing the resentment of his subjects, that they punished with death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge his brother; and main∣tained a dutiful allegiance to the princes, who were established on the throne by the choice of Stilicho <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot"><L>—Provincia missos</L>

They paid the penalty of their rashness; and twenty thou∣sand Vandals, with their king Godigisclus, were slain in the field of battle. The whole people must have been extirpated, if the squadrons of the Alani, advancing to their relief, had not trampled down the infantry of the Franks; who, after an honourable resistance, were compelled to relin∣quish the unequal contest. The victorious con∣federates pursued their march, and on the last day of the year, in a season when the waters of the Rhine were most probably frozen, they entered, without opposition, the defenceless provinces of Gaul. This memorable passage of the Suevi, the Vandals, the Alani, and the Burgundians, who never afterwards retreated, may be consider∣ed as the fall of the Roman empire in the coun∣tries beyond the Alps; and the barriers, which had so long separated the savage and the civilised na∣tions of the earth, were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">See Zosimus (l. vi. p. 373.), Orosius (l. vii. c. 40. p. 576.), and the Chronicles.

disputants overlooked the invariable laws of na∣ture, which have connected peace with innocence, plenty with industry, and safety with valour. The timid and selfish policy of the court of Ravenna might recal the Palatine legions for the protection of Italy; the remains of the stationary troops might be unequal to the arduous task; and the Barbarian auxiliaries might prefer the unbounded licence of spoil, to the benefits of a moderate and regular stipend. But the provinces of Gaul were filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth, who, in the defence of their houses, their families, and their altars, if they had dared to die, would have deserved to vanquish. The knowledge of their native country would have en∣abled them to oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an invader; and the deficiency of the Barbarians, in arms as well as in discipline, removed the only pretence which ex∣cuses the submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a veteran army.

They <NOTE PLACE="marg">Constan∣tine is ac∣knowledg∣ed in Bri∣tain and Gaul, A.

Yet the authority of Constantine was less precarious, and his go∣vernment was more successful, than the transient reigns of Marcus and of Gratian. The danger of leaving his inactive troops in those camps, which had been twice polluted with blood and sedition, urged him to attempt the reduction of the Western provinces. He landed at Boulogne with an inconsiderable force; and after he had re∣posed himself some days, he summoned the cities
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
of Gaul, which had escaped the yoke of the Bar∣barians, to acknowledge their lawful sovereign. They obeyed the summons without reluctance. The neglect of the court of Ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of allegiance; their actual distress encouraged them to accept any circumstances of change, without apprehen∣sion, and, perhaps, with some degree of hope; and they might flatter themselves, that the troops, the authority, and even the name of a Roman emperor, who fixed his residence in Gaul, would protect the unhappy country from the rage of the Barbarians. The first successes of Constantine against the detached parties of the Germans, were magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive victories; which the re∣union and insolence of the enemy soon reduced to their just value. His negociations procured a short and precarious truce; and if some tribes of the Barbarians were engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promises, to undertake the defence of the Rhine, these expensive and uncertain trea∣ties, instead of restoring the pristine vigour of the Gallic frontier, served only to disgrace the ma∣jesty of the prince, and to exhaust what yet re∣mained of the treasures of the republic. Elated however with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South, to encounter a more pressing and per∣sonal danger. Sarus the Goth was ordered to lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius; and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily consumed in this domestic quar∣rel.

After the loss of his two bravest generals, Justinian and Nevigastes, the former of whom was slain in the field of battle, the latter in a peaceful but treacherous interview, Constantine fortified himself within the walls of Vienna.

<P>On the side of the Pyrenees, the ambition of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He reduces Spain, A.

The only opposition which was made to the authority of Constantine, proceeded not so much from the powers of government, or the spirit of the people, as from the private zeal and interest of the family of Theodosius. Four brothers <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">Verinianus, Didymus, Theodosius, and Lagodius, who, in modern courts, would be styled princes of the blood, were not distinguished by any rank or privileges above the rest of their fellow∣subjects.</NOTE> had obtained,
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>
by the favour of their kinsman, the deceased em∣peror, an honourable rank, and ample possessions, in their native country: and the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the service of his son. After an unsuccessful effort to maintain their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania, they retired to their estates; where they armed and levied, at their own expence, a considerable body of slaves and dependents, and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenaean mountains. This domestic insurrec∣tion alarmed and perplexed the sovereign of Gaul and Britain; and he was compelled to negociate with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries, for the service of the Spanish war.

The rustic army of the Theodosian family was surrounded and de∣stroyed in the Pyrenees: two of the brothers had the good fortune to escape by sea to Italy, or the East; the other two, after an interval of suspence, were executed at Arles; and if Honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace, he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his generous kinsmen. Such were the feeble arms which decided the possession of the Western provinces of Europe, from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules. The events of peace and war have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view of the historians of the times, who were equally ignorant of the causes, and of the effects, of the most important revolu∣tions.

this unfortunate expedition, the king of the Goths must indeed have sustained a considerable loss; and his harassed forces required an interval of re∣pose to recruit their numbers, and revive their confidence. Adversity had exercised, and dis∣played, the genius of Alaric; and the fame of his valour invited, to the Gothic standard, the bravest of the Barbarian warriors; who, from the Euxine to the Rhine, were agitated by the desire of rapine and conquest. He had deserved the esteem, and he soon accepted the friendship, of Stilicho himself. Renouncing the service of the emperor of the East, Alaric concluded, with the court of Ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was declared master-general of the Roman armies throughout the praefecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the true and an∣cient limits, by the minister of Honorius <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">These dark transactions are investigated by the Count de Buat (Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii. c. iii—viii. p. 69—206.), whose laborious accuracy may sometimes fatigue a superficial reader.</NOTE>. The execution of the ambitious design, which was either stipulated, or implied, in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus; and the neu∣trality of the Gothic king may perhaps be com∣pared to the indifference of Caesar, who, in the conspiracy of Catiline, refused either to assist, or to oppose, the enemy of the republic. After the defeat of the Vandals, Stilicho resumed his pre∣tensions to the provinces of the East; appointed civil magistrates for the administration of justice,

and of the finances; and declared his impatience to lead, to the gates of Constantinople, the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths. The prudence however of Stilicho, his aversion to civil war, and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state, may countenance the suspicion, that domestic peace, rather than foreign conquest, was the object of his policy; and, that his prin∣cipal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a distance from Italy. This design could not long escape the penetration of the Gothic king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a treacherous correspondence, with the rival courts; who protracted, like a dissatisfied mercenary, his languid operations in Thessaly and Epirus, and who soon returned to claim the extravagant re∣ward of his ineffectual services.

The necessity of finding some arti∣ficial support for a government, which, from a principle, not of moderation, but of weakness, was reduced to negociate with its own subjects, had insensibly revived the authority of the Roman senate: and the minister of Honorius respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic. Stilicho assembled the senate in the palace of the Caesars; represented, in a studied oration, the actual state of affairs; proposed the demands of the Gothic king, and submitted to their con∣sideration the choice of peace or war. The se∣nators, as if they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred years, appeared on this important occasion to be inspired by the cou∣rage, rather than by the wisdom, of their prede∣cessors. They loudly declared, in regular speeches, or in tumultuary acclamations, that it was un∣worthy of the majesty of Rome, to purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barbarian king; and that, in the judgment of a magnani∣mous people, the chance of ruin was always pre∣ferable to the certainty of dishonour.

whose pacific intentions were seconded only by the voices of a few servile and venal followers, attempted to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct, and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. <Q>"The payment of a subsidy, which had excited the indignation of the Romans, ought not (such was the lan∣guage of Stilicho) to be considered in the odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ransom, extorted by the menaces of a Barbarian enemy. Alaric had faithfully asserted the just preten∣sions of the republic to the provinces which were usurped by the Greeks of Constantinople: he modestly required the fair and stipulated recompence of his services; and if he had de∣sisted from the prosecution of his enterprise, he had obeyed, in his retreat, the peremptory, though private, letters of the emperor himself. These contradictory orders (he would not dis∣semble the errors of his own family) had been procured by the intercession of Serena. The tender piety of his wife had been too deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers, the sons of her adopted father; and the senti∣ments of nature had too easily prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare."</Q> These ostensible reasons, which faintly disguise the ob∣scure intrigues of the palace of Ravenna, were supported by the authority of Stilicho; and ob∣tained, after a warm debate, the reluctant appro∣bation of the senate. The tumult of virtue and freedom subsided; and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was granted, under the name of
<PB N="238" REF="246"/>
a subsidy, to secure the peace of Italy, and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the Goths. Lampadius alone, one of the most illustrious members of the assembly, still persisted in his dis∣sent; exclaimed with a loud voice, <Q>"This is not a treaty of peace, but of servitude <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 338, 339. He repeats the words of Lam∣padius, as they were spoke in Latin, "Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis," and then translates them into Greek for the benefit of his readers.</NOTE>;"</Q> and escaped the danger of such bold opposition by im∣mediately retiring to the sanctuary of a Christian church.</P>
<P>But the reign of Stilicho drew towards its end; and the proud minister might perceive the symp∣toms <NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the pa∣lace, A. D. 408, May.</NOTE> of his approaching disgrace. The generous boldness of Lampadius had been applauded; and the senate, so patiently resigned to a long servi∣tude, rejected with disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom. The troops, who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the Roman legions, were exasperated by the partial affection of Stilicho for the Barbarians: and the people im∣puted to the mischievous policy of the minister, the public misfortunes, which were the natural con∣sequence of their own degeneracy. Yet Stilicho might have continued to brave the clamours of the people, and even of the soldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil. But the respectful attachment of Honorius was converted into fear, suspicion, and hatred. The crafty Olympius <NOTE N="104" PLACE="foot">He came from the coast of the Euxine, and exercised a splen∣did office, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. His actions justify his character, which Zosimus (l. v. p. 340.) exposes with visible satisfaction. Augustin revered the piety of Olympius, whom he styles a true son of the church (Baronius, Annal. Eccles. A. D. 408. No 19, &amp;c. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 467, 468.). But these praises, which the African saint so unworthily be∣stows, might proceed, as well from ignorance, as from adulation.</NOTE>, who con∣cealed
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>
his vices under the mask of Christian piety, had secretly undermined the benefactor, by whose favour he was promoted to the honourable offices of the Imperial palace. Olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor, who had attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without weight, or authority, in his own government; and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent dis∣position by a lively picture of the designs of Stili∣cho, who already meditated the death of his sove∣reign, with the ambitious hope of placing the dia∣dem on the head of his son Eucherius. The em∣peror was instigated, by his new favourite, to as∣sume the tone of independent dignity; and the minister was astonished to find, that secret reso∣lutions were formed in the court and council, which were repugnant to his interest, or to his intentions. Instead of residing in the palace of Rome, Honorius declared, that it was his plea∣sure to return to the secure fortress of Ravenna. On the first intelligence of the death of his bro∣ther Arcadius, he prepared to visit Constantinople, and to regulate, with the authority of a guardian, the provinces of the infant Theodosius <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 338, 339.

The Eastern empire would not have obeyed, and could not have been conquered.</NOTE>. The

representation of the difficulty and expence of such a distant expedition, checked this strange and sudden sally of active diligence; but the dangerous project of shewing the emperor to the camp of Pavia, which was composed of the Ro∣man troops, the enemies of Stilicho, and his Barbarian auxiliaries, remained fixed and unal∣terable. The minister was pressed, by the ad∣vice of his confident Justinian, a Roman advo∣cate, of a lively and penetrating genius, to op∣pose a journey so prejudicial to his reputation and safety. His strenuous, but ineffectual, efforts confirmed the triumph of Olympius; and the prudent lawyer withdrew himself from the im∣pending ruin of his patron.</P>
<P>In the passage of the emperor through Bologna, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgrace and death of Stilicho, A. D. 408, Aug. 23.</NOTE> a mutiny of the guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of Stilicho; who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty, and ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their par∣don. After this tumult, Honorius embraced, for the last time, the minister whom he now con∣sidered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to camp of Pavia; where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were as∣sembled for the service of the Gallic war. On the morning of the fourth day, he pronounced, as he had been taught, a military oration in the presence of the soldiers, whom the charitable visits, and artful discourses, of Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy. At the first signal, they massacred the friends of Stilicho, the most illustrious officers of the em∣pire;
<PB N="241" REF="249"/>
two Praetorian praefects, of Gaul, and of Italy; two masters-general, of the cavalry, and infantry; the master of the offices; the quaestor, the treasurer, and the count of the domestics. Many lives were lost; many houses were plunder∣ed; the furious sedition continued to rage till the close of the evening; and the trembling em∣peror, who was seen in the streets of Pavia, with∣out his robes or diadem, yielded to the persuasions of his favourite; condemned the memory of the slain; and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their assassins. The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled the mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions: and he instantly summoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the confederate leaders, who were attached to his service, and would be involved in his ruin. The impetuous voice of the assembly called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a mo∣ment's delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had so often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate the guilty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. Instead of executing a resolution, which might have been justified by success, Stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost. He was still igno∣rant of the fate of the emperor; he distrusted the fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal consequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians, against the soldiers and people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of
<PB N="242" REF="250"/>
his timorous and doubtful delay, hastily retired, with fear and indignation. At the hour of mid∣night, Sarus, a Gothic warrior, renowned among the Barbarians themselves for his strength and va∣lour, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his person, and penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and sleep∣less, meditated on the dangers of his situation. Stilicho escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths; and, after issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of Italy, to shut their gates against the Barbarians, his confidence, or his despair, urged him to throw himself into Ra∣venna, which was already in the absolute pos∣session of his enemies. Olympius, who had as∣sumed the dominion of Honorius, was speedily informed, that his rival had embraced, as a sup∣pliant, the altar of the Christian church. The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was in∣capable of pity or remorse; but he piously af∣fected to elude, rather than to violate, the pri∣vilege of the sanctuary. Count Heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared, at the dawn of day, before the gates of the church of Ravenna. The bishop was satisfied by a solemn oath, that the Imperial mandate only directed them to secure the person of Stilicho: but, as soon as the un∣fortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution. Stilicho supported, with calm resignation, the injurious names of traitor and
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
parricide; repressed the unseasonable zeal of his followers, who were ready to attempt an inef∣fectual rescue; and, with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals, submitted his neck to the sword of Heraclian <NOTE N="105" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. v. p. 336—345.) has copiously, though not clearly, related the disgrace and death of Stilicho.

<P>The servile crowd of the palace, who had so <NOTE PLACE="marg">His memo∣ry perse∣cuted.</NOTE> long adored the fortune of Stilicho, affected to insult his fall; and the most distant connection with the master-general of the West, which had so lately been a title to wealth and honours, was studiously denied, and rigorously punished. His family, united by a triple alliance with the family of Theodosius, might envy the condition of the meanest peasant. The flight of his son Eucherius was intercepted; and the death of that innocent youth soon followed the divorce of Thermantia, who filled the place of her sister Maria; and who, like Maria, had remained a virgin in the Imperial bed <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 333.

The services of Stilicho are great and manifest; his crimes, as they are vaguely stated in the language of flattery and hatred, are obscure, at least, and improbable. About four months after his death, an edict was published, in the name of Honorius, to restore the free com∣munication of the two empires, which had been so long interrupted by the <HI>public enemy</HI> <NOTE N="109" PLACE="foot">See the Theodosian Code, l. vii. tit. xvi. leg. 1. l. ix. tit. xlii. leg. 22.

The minister, whose fame and fortune depended on the prosperity of the state, was accused of betraying Italy to the Barbarians; whom he repeatedly vanquished at Pollentia, at Verona, and before the walls of Florence.

humble station of tribune of the notaries. Even the religion of Stilicho was arraigned by the ma∣lice of his rival. The seasonable, and almost miraculous, deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause of the clergy; who asserted, that the restoration of idols, and the persecution of the church, would have been the first measure of the reign of Eucherius. The son of Stilicho, how∣ever, was educated in the bosom of Christianity, which his father had uniformly professed, and zealously supported <NOTE N="110" PLACE="foot">Augustin himself is satisfied with the effectual laws, which Stilicho had enacted against heretics and idolaters; and which are still extant in the Code.

These are foolish stories: yet the charge of <HI>impiety</HI> adds weight and credit to the praise, which Zosimus reluctant∣ly bestows, of his virtues.</NOTE>. The pride and power of Stilicho constituted his real guilt.

base ingratitude to the guardian of his youth, and the support of his empire.</P>
<P>Among the train of dependents, whose wealth <NOTE PLACE="marg">The poet Claudian.</NOTE> and dignity attracted the notice of their own times, <HI>our</HI> curiosity is excited by the celebrated name of the poet Claudian, who enjoyed the favour of Stilicho, and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron. The titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the Imperial court: he was in∣debted to the powerful intercession of Serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the pro∣vince of Africa <NOTE N="113" PLACE="foot">At the nuptials of Orpheus (a modest comparison!) all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts; and the gods themselves enriched their favourite. Claudian had neither flocks, nor herds, nor vines, or olives. His wealthy bride was heiress to them all. But he carried to Africa, a recommendatory letter from Serena, his Juno, and was made happy (Epist. ii. ad Se∣renam).</NOTE>; and the statue of Claudian, erected in the forum of Trajan, was a monument of the taste and liberality of the Roman senate <NOTE N="114" PLACE="foot">Claudian feels the honour like a man who deserved it (in praefat.

The statue of a poet, far superior to Claudian, should have been erected, during his life-time, by the men of letters, his coun∣trymen, and contemporaries. It was a noble design!</NOTE>. After the praises of Stilicho became offensive and criminal, Claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful and unforgiving courtier, whom he had provoked by the insolence of wit. He had compared, in a lively epigram, the opposite cha∣racters of two Praetorian praefects of Italy; he contrasts the innocent repose of a philosopher, who sometimes resigned the hours of business to
<PB N="247" REF="255"/>
slumber, perhaps to study; with the interested diligence of a rapacious minister, indefatigable in the pursuit of unjust, or sacrilegious gain. <Q>"How happy, continues Claudian, how happy might it be for the people of Italy, if Mallius could be constantly awake, and if Hadrian would always sleep <NOTE N="115" PLACE="foot"><P>See Epigram xxx.</P>

<P>Hadrian was a Pharian (of Alexandria). See his public life in Godefroy, Cod. Theodos. tom. vi. p. 364. Mallius did not always sleep. He composed some elegant dialogues on the Greek systems of natural philosophy (Claud. in Mall. Theodor. Cons. 61—112.).</P></NOTE>!"</Q> The repose of Mallius was not disturbed by this friendly and gentle admonition; but the cruel vigilance of Hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge, and easily obtained, from the enemies of Stilicho, the trifling sacrifice of an obnoxious poet. The poet concealed himself, however, during the tumult of the revolution; and, consulting the dictates of prudence rather than of honour, he addressed, in the form of an epistle, a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended praefect. He deplores, in mournful strains, the fatal indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly; submits to the imitation of his adversary, the generous examples of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and expresses his hope, that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample on a defenceless and contemptible foe, already humbled by disgrace

and poverty; and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and the death of his dearest friends <NOTE N="116" PLACE="foot">See Claudian's first Epistle. Yet, in some places, an air of irony and indignation betrays his secret reluctance.</NOTE>. Whatever might be the success of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet; but the name of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion, while Claudian is read with plea∣sure in every country which has retained, or ac∣quired, the knowledge of the Latin language. If we fairly balance his merits and his defects, we shall acknowledge, that Claudian does not either satisfy, or silence, our reason. It would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse, that melts the heart, or enlarges the imagination. We should vainly seek, in the poems of Clau∣dian, the happy invention, and artificial conduct, of an interesting fable; or the just and lively re∣presentation of the characters and situations of real life. For the service of his patron, he published occasional panegyrics and invectives: and the de∣sign of these slavish compositions encouraged his propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature. These imperfections, however, are compensated in some degree by the poetical virtues of Clau∣dian. He was endowed with the rare and pre∣cious talent of raising the meanest, of adorning the most barren, and of diversifying the most simi∣lar, topics: his colouring, more especially in de∣scriptive poetry, is soft and splendid; and he
<PB N="249" REF="257"/>
seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the advantages of a cultivated understanding, a co∣pious fancy, an easy, and sometimes forcible, ex∣pression; and a perpetual flow of harmonious versification. To these commendations, inde∣pendent of any accidents of time and place, we must add the peculiar merit which Claudian de∣rived from the unfavourable circumstances of his birth. In the decline of arts, and of empire, a native of Egypt <NOTE N="117" PLACE="foot">National vanity has made him a Florentine, or a Spaniard. But the first epistle of Claudian proves him a native of Alexandria (Fabricius, Bibliot. Latin. tom. iii. p. 191—202. edit.

The king of the Goths would have conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to destroy the formidable adversary, by whose arms, in Italy as well as in Greece, he had been twice overthrown. <HI>Their</HI> active and in∣terested hatred laboriously accomplished the dis∣grace and ruin of the great Stilicho. The valour of Sarus, his fame in arms, and his personal, or hereditary, influence over the confederate Bar∣barians, could recommend him only to the friends of their country, who despised, or detested, the worthless characters of Turpilio, Varanes, and Vigilantius. By the pressing instances of the new
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>

The Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the edict which the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and devout emperor. Honorius excluded all persons, who were adverse to the catholic church, from holding any office in the state; obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from his religion; and rashly dis∣qualified many of his bravest and most skilful officers, who adhered to the Pagan worship, or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianism <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Eos qui catholicae sectae sunt inimici, intra palatium militare prohibemus.

These measures, so advantageous to an enemy, Alaric would have approved, and might perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful, whe∣ther the Barbarian would have promoted his in∣terest at the expence of the inhuman and absurd cruelty, which was perpetrated by the direction, or at least with the connivance, of the Imperial ministers. The foreign auxiliaries, who had been attached to the person of Stilicho, lamented his death; but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their
<PB N="252" REF="260"/>
wives and children; who were detained as host∣ages in the strong cities of Italy, where they had likewise deposited their most valuable effects. At the same hour, and as if by a common signal, the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal massacre and pillage, which in∣volved, in promiscuous destruction, the families and fortunes of the Barbarians. Exasperated by such an injury, which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit, they cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimously swore to pursue, with just and implacable war, the perfidious nation, that had so basely violated the laws of hospitality. By the imprudent conduct of the ministers of Hono∣rius, the republic lost the assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty thousand of her bravest sol∣diers: and the weight of that formidable army, which alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred from the scale of the Ro∣mans into that of the Goths.</P>
<P>In the arts of negociation, as well as in those of war, the Gothic king maintained his superior <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alaric marches to Rome, A. D. 408, Oct. &amp;c.</NOTE> ascendant over an enemy, whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and de∣sign. From his camp, on the confines of Italy, Alaric attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the progress of faction and dis∣content, disguised the hostile aspect of a Barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appear∣ance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho; to whose virtues, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute of sincere
<PB N="253" REF="261"/>
praise and regret. The pressing invitation of the malcontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he might speciously com∣plain, that the Imperial ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of gold; which had been granted by the Roman senate, either to reward his services, or to appease his fury. His decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the success of his designs. He required a fair and reasonable satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances, that, as soon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. He refused to trust the faith of the Romans, unless Aetius and Jason, the sons of two great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his camp: but he offered to de∣liver, in exchange, several of the noblest youths of the Gothic nation. The modesty of Alaric was interpreted, by the ministers of Ravenna, as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear. They disdained either to negociate a treaty, or to assemble an army; and with a rash confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war. While they expected, in sullen silence, that the Barbarians should evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches, passed the Alps and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty thousand
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
auxiliaries; and, without meeting a single enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected the impregnable resi∣dence of the emperor of the West. Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the ancient mistress of the world. An Italian her∣mit, whose zeal and sanctity were respected by the Barbarians themselves, encountered the vic∣torious monarch, and boldly denounced the in∣dignation of heaven against the oppressors of the earth: but the saint himself was confounded by the solemn asseveration of Alaric, that he felt a secret and praeternatural impulse, which directed, and even compelled, his march to the gates of Rome. He felt, that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the Goths, insensibly removed the popular, and al∣most superstitious, reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name. His troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of the Flaminian way, occupied the un∣guarded passes of the Apennine <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Addison (see his Works, vol. ii. p. 54. edit.

of the Punic war, had accomplished his term of military service, either in a subordinate or a su∣perior station; and the decree, which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave the repub∣lic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals. In the beginning of the war, the Roman people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an age to bear arms <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">In the three <HI>census</HI> which were made of the Roman people, about the time of the second Punic war, the numbers stand as follows (see Livy, Epitom. l. xx. Hist. l. xxvii. 36. xxix. 37.), 270, 213, 137, 108, 214,000. The fall of the second, and the rise of the third, appears so enormous, that several critics, notwithstanding the unanimity of the MSS. have suspected some corruption of the text of Livy. (See Drakenborch ad xxvii. 36. and Beaufort, Republique Romaine, tom. i. p. 325.) They did not consider that the second <HI>census</HI> was taken only at Rome, and that the numbers were diminished, not only by the death, but likewise by the <HI>absence,</HI> of many soldiers.

From the numbers on the list, we must always deduct one twelfth above threescore, and in∣capable of bearing arms. See Population de la France, p. 72.</NOTE>. Fifty thousand had already died in the defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and Spain, re∣quired about one hundred thousand men. But there still remained an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent territory, who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained, from his earliest youth, in the discipline and exercises of a soldier. Hannibal was asto∣nished by the constancy of the senate, who, with∣out
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>
raising the siege of Capua, or recalling their scattered forces, expected his approach. He en∣camped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance of three miles from the city: and he was soon informed, that the ground on which he had pitch∣ed his tent, was sold for an adequate price at a public auction; and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite road, to reinforce the legions of Spain <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Livy considers these two incidents as the effects only of chance and courage. I suspect that they were both managed by the admi∣rable policy of the senate.</NOTE>. He led his Africans to the gates of Rome, where he found three armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him; but Hannibal dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could not hope to escape, unless he de∣stroyed the last of his enemies; and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans.</P>
<P>From the time of the Punic war, the uninter∣rupted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Genealo∣gy of tho senators.</NOTE> succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the dege∣nerate subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal, and subdued the nations of the earth.

The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascend∣ed as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a Grecian origin; but her mother, Blaesilla, num∣bered the Scipios, Aemilius Paulus, and the Grac∣chi, in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the Julian line. The vanity of the rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions. Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they easily im∣posed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were countenanced, in some measure, by the custom of adopting the name of their patron, which had al∣ways prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families. Most of those families, however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay, were gradually extir∣pated: and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations, among the mountains of the Alps, or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions. Under each successive reign, and from every province of the empire, a crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices, usurped the wealth, the honours, and the palaces of Rome; and oppress∣ed, or protected, the poor and humble remains of consular families; who were ignorant, per∣haps, of the glory of their ancestors <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Tacitus (Annal. iii. 55.) affirms, that, between the battle of Actium and the reign of Vespasian, the senate was gradually filled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> families, from the Municipia and colonies of Italy.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
the money. Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a thousand or fifteen hun∣dred pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the sena∣torian rank, which required many expences of a public and ostentatious kind. Several examples are recorded in the age of Honorius, of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship, by a festival, which lasted seven days, and cost above one hundred thousand pounds sterling <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">The sons of Alypius, of Symmachus, and of Maximus, spent during their respective praetorships, twelve, or twenty, or forty, <HI>cen∣tenaries</HI> (or, hundred weight of gold). See Olympiodor. ap. Phot. p. 197. This popular estimation allows some latitude; but it is dif∣ficult to explain a law in the Theodosian Code (l. vi. leg. 5.), which fixes the expence of the first praetor at 25,000, of the second at 20,000, and of the third at 15,000 <HI>folles.</HI> The name of <HI>follis</HI> (see Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 727.) was equally ap∣plied to a purse of 125 pieces of silver, and to a small copper coin of the value of 1/2625 part of that purse. In the former sense, the 25,000 folles would be equal to 150,000 l. in the latter to five or six pounds sterling. The one appears extravagant, the other is ridiculous. There must have existed some third, and middle value, which is here understood; but ambiguity is an inexcusable fault in the language of laws.</NOTE>. The estates of the Roman senators, which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.

According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the Ro∣mans were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer. The oeconomi∣cal writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method, wherever it may be practi∣cable; but if the object should be removed, by its distance or magnitude, from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil, and interested in the produce, to the mercenary ad∣ministration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaith∣ful, steward <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Volusius, a wealthy senator (Tacit.

Yet it appears from the Theodosian Code (see Godefroy ad l. ii. tit. xxxiii. tom. i. p. 230—289.), that they were permitted to take six per cent. or one half of the legal interest; and, what is more singular, this permission was granted to the <HI>young</HI> senators.</NOTE>. A considerable mass of trea∣sure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many side∣boards in the time of Pliny, which contained more solid silver, than had been transported by Scipio from vanquished Carthage <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Plin.

The great∣er part of the nobles, who dissipated their for∣tunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth; and idle in a constant round of dissipation. Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a thousand hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.

The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent-roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man, who recollects, that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers, by the delicacy of their food, or the splendour

The baggage and ward∣robe move in the front; and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks, and inferior ministers, employed in the service of the kit∣chens, and of the table. The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians. The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of se∣niority. Their numbers, and their deformity, excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are rèady to execrate the memory of Se∣miramis, for the cruel art which she invented, of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future gene∣rations. In the exercise of domestic jurisdic∣tion, the nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a con∣temptuous indifference for the rest of the human species. When they have called for warm wa∣ter, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with three hundred lashes: but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe, that he is a worthless fellow; but that, if he repeats the offence, he shall not escape punish∣ment.

Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune, was relieved, or rewarded, by their generosity. At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to one of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the first audience, with such warm professions, and such kind enquiries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of man∣ners, as well as of empire. Secure of a favour∣able reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery, that his person, his name, and his country, are already forgotten. If he still has resolution to perse∣vere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haugh∣ty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship; who scarcely deigns to remark his presence, his departure, or his return.

But the fre∣quent and familiar companions of the great, are those parasites, who practise the most use∣ful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word, and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns, and variegated pavements; and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance, which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.

Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great, is derived from the pro∣fession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.

urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy, childless, citizen is the most powerful of the Romans. The art of obtaining the signature of a favour∣able testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly under∣stood; and it has happened, that in the same house, though in different apartments, a hus∣band and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare, at the same time, their mutual, but contradictory, inten∣tions. The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury, often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients. When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declama∣tion of the grandsons of Hercules. If the de∣mand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent cre∣ditor; who is seldom released from prison, till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.

But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work, and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices, within the walls of Rome, should not exceed the mea∣sure of seventy feet from the ground <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot"><P>The successive testimonies of Pliny, Aristides, Claudian, Ru∣tilius, &amp;c. prove the insufficiency of these restrictive edicts.

House-rent was there∣fore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expence, the ground, which they co∣vered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the Roman people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors, and apartments, of the same house, were divided, as it is still the custom of Paris, and other cities, among several families of plebeians. IV.

The first emotions of the nobles, and of the people, were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile Barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world: but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim. Perhaps in the person of Serena, the Romans might have respected the niece of Theo∣dosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor: but they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with cre∣dulous passion to the tale of calumny, which ac∣cused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the Gothic invader. Actu∣ated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death. Serena was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find, that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the Barbarians, and the deliverance of the city.

gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine. The daily allowance of three pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion. The poorer citizens, who were unable to purchase the neces∣saries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her resi∣dence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue, which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">The mother of Laeta was named Pissumena. Her father, fa∣mily, and country are unknown. Ducange, Fam. Byzantin. p. 59.</NOTE>. But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators them∣selves. The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavail∣ing treasures of gold and silver, to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain. The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger. A dark suspicion was entertained, that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-crea∣tures,

The assur∣ances <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plague.</NOTE> of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Raven∣na, supported, for some time, the fainting reso∣lution of the Romans, till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance.

The last resource of the Romans was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths. The senate, who in this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alaric ac∣cepts a ransom, and raises the siege, A. D. 409.</NOTE> emergency assumed the supreme powers of go∣vernment, appointed two ambassadors to nego∣ciate with the enemy. This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator, of Spanish ex∣traction, and already conspicuous in the admini∣stration of provinces; and to John, the first tri∣bune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his for∣mer intimacy with the Gothic prince. When they were introduced into his presence, they de∣clared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the Romans were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if Alaric refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innu∣merable people, exercised in arms, and animated by despair. <Q>"The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed,"</Q> was the concise reply of the Barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accom∣panied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine. He then condescended to fix the ransom, which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: <HI>all</HI> the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; <HI>all</HI> the rich and precious moveables; and <HI>all</HI> the
<PB N="295" REF="303"/>
slaves who could prove their title to the name of <HI>Barbarians.</HI> The ministers of the senate presum∣ed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, <Q>"If such, O King, are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?"</Q> <Q>"YOUR LIVES;"</Q> replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled, and retired. Yet before they retired, a short sus∣pension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negociation. The stern features of Alaric were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the im∣mediate payment of five thousand pounds of gold, of thirty thousand pounds of silver, of four thou∣sand robes of silk, of three thousand pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of three thousand pounds weight of pepper <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">Pepper was a favourite ingredient of the most expensive Ro∣man cookery, and the best sort commonly sold for fifteen denarii, or ten shillings, the pound. See Pliny, Hist. Natur. xii. 14. It was brought from India; and the same country, the coast of Malabar, still affords the greatest plenty: but the improvement of trade and navigation has multiplied the quantity, and reduced the price. See Histoire Politique et Philosophique, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 457.</NOTE>. But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in Italy and the provinces, were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city. As soon as the Romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were re∣stored,
<PB N="296" REF="304"/>
in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty. Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river, and the adjacent country, was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market, which was held during three days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade, made a considerable profit, the future sub∣sistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries. A more regular discipline, than could have been expected, was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise Barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious Goths, who had insulted some Roman citizens on the road to Ostia. His army, en∣riched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his win∣ter-quarters; and the Gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand Barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries, and the disgrace, of their cruel ser∣vitude. About the same time, he received a more honourable reinforcement of Goths and Huns, whom Adolphus <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">This Gothic chieftain is called by Jornandes and Isidore, <HI>Athaulphus;</HI> by Zosimus and Orosius, <HI>Ataulphus;</HI> and by Olympio∣dorus, <HI>Adaoulphus.</HI> I have used the celebrated name of <HI>Adolphus,</HI> which seems to be authorised by the practice of the Swedes, the sons or brothers of the ancient Goths.</NOTE>, the brother of his wife,

<P>At the distance of fourteen centuries, we may <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruitless negocia∣tions for peace, A.

In the midst of his apparent prosperity, Alaric was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed, was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius. The king of the Goths repeatedly declared, that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace, and of the Romans. Three senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambas∣sadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages, and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals, which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negociations, could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune. The Barbarian still aspired to the rank
<PB N="298" REF="306"/>
of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Nori∣cum, and Venetia, for the seat of his new king∣dom, which would have commanded the impor∣tant communication between Italy and the Da∣nube. If these modest terms should be rejected, Alaric shewed a disposition to relinquish his pe∣cuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Noricum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 367, 368, 369.</NOTE>. But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius. Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military es∣cort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence. Six thousand Dalmatians, the flower of the Imperial legions, were ordered to march from Ravenna to Rome, through an open country, which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians. These brave legionaries, encompassed and betray∣ed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their gene∣ral Valens, with an hundred soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and one of the ambas∣sadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty thousand pieces of gold. Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renew∣ed

his proposals of peace: and the second embassy of the Roman senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of Gothic soldiers <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 360, 361, 362.

The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of Honorius, and the empire, to Jovius, the Praetorian praefect; an unworthy servant, who did not atone, by the merit of personal attachment, for the errors and misfortunes of his administration. The exile, or escape, of the guilty Olympius, reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a second time into disgrace; his ears were cut off; he expired under the lash; and his ignominious death afford∣ed a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho. After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the Pagans and heretics were delivered from the im∣politic proscription, which excluded them from the dignities of the state. The brave Gennerid <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Zosimus (l. v. p. 364.) relates this circumstance with visible complacency, and celebrates the character of Gennerid as the last glory of expiring paganism. Very different were the sentiments of the council of Carthage, who deputed four bishops to the court of Ravenna, to complain of the law, which had been just enacted, that all conversions to Christianity should be free and voluntary. See Baronius, Annal. Eccles. A. D. 409. No 12. A. D. 410. No 47, 48.</NOTE>,

a soldier of Barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been oblig∣ed to lay aside the military belt: and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself, that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispen∣sation, and persevered in honourable disgrace, till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the Roman government. The conduct of Gennerid, in the important station, to which he was promoted or restored, of master∣general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic. From a life of idleness and want, his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise, and plentiful subsistence; and his private generosity often supplied the rewards, which were denied by the avarice, or poverty, of the court of Ravenna. The valour of Gen∣nerid, formidable to the adjacent Barbarians, was the firmest bulwark of the Illyrian frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a rein∣forcement of ten thousand Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a con∣voy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient, not only for the march of an army, but for the
<PB N="301" REF="309"/>
settlement of a colony. But the court and coun∣cils of Honorius still remained a scene of weak∣ness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy. Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny, and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two principal eunuchs. The generals, under a perfidious promise of safe∣ty, were sent on ship-board, and privately exe∣cuted; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at Milan and Con∣stantinople. Eusebius the eunuch, and the Bar∣barian Allobich, succeeded to the command of the bed-chamber and of the guards; and the mu∣tual jealousy of these subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction. By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks, before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life, in which Ho∣norius discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment. Yet before they fell, Eusebius and Allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire, by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and per∣haps a criminal, motive, had negociated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini. During the absence of Jovius, the em∣peror was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation, nor his character, could enable him to support: and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius,
<PB N="302" REF="310"/>
was immediately dispatched to the Praetorian praefect, granting him a free permission to dis∣pose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian. This letter was imprudently communicated to Alaric himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed, in the most outrageous language, his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person, and to his nation. The conference of Rimini was hastily interrupted; and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court. By his advice and example, the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear, that, without listening, in <HI>any</HI> circumstances, to <HI>any</HI> conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic. This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negociation. The ministers of Hono∣rius were heard to declare, that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would con∣sult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn, by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched, in solemn ceremony, that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion <NOTE N="85" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 367, 368, 369. This custom of swearing by the head, or life, or safety, or genius, of the sovereign, was of the highest antiquity, both in Egypt (Genesis xlii. 15.) and Scythia. It was soon transferred, by flattery, to the Caesars; and Tertullian complains, that it was the only oath which the Romans of his time affected to reverence.

While the emperor and his court enjoyed, with sullen pride, the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Second siege of Rome by the Goths, A.

Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that, as he moved with his army along the Flaminian way, he suc∣cessively dispatched the bishops of the towns of Italy to reiterate his offers of peace, and to con∣jure the emperor, that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire, and the sword of the Barbarians <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 368, 369.

The accidents to which
<PB N="304" REF="312"/>
the precarious subsistence of the city was con∣tinually exposed in a winter-navigation, and an open road, had suggested to the genius of the first Caesar the useful design, which was executed under the reign of Claudius. The artificial moles, which formed the narrow entrance, ad∣vanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basons, which received the northern branch of the Tyber, about two miles from the ancient colony of Ostia <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Ostia Tyberina</HI> (see Cluver. Italia Antiq. l. iii. p. 870—879.), in the plural number, the two mouths of the Tyber, were separated by the Holy Island, an equilateral triangle, whose sides were each of them computed at about two miles.

the corn of Africa was deposited in spacious gra∣naries for the use of the capital. As soon as Alaric was in possession of that important place, he summoned the city to surrender at discretion; and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration, that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines, on which the life of the Roman peo∣ple depended. The clamours of that people, and the terror of famine, subdued the pride of the senate; they listened, without reluctance, to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the Gothic conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city. The grateful mo∣narch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adol∣phus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the two hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance <NOTE N="90" PLACE="foot">For the elevation of Attalus, consult Zosimus, l. vi. p. 377—380.

After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, Attalus convened an assembly of the senate; before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the
<PB N="306" REF="314"/>
majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of Egypt and the East, which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome. Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper; whose ele∣vation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the Barbarians. But the popu∣lace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters. The public discontent was favour∣able to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince, who, in his native country of Io∣nia, had been educated in the Pagan superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of bap∣tism from the hands of an Arian bishop <NOTE N="91" PLACE="foot">We may admit the evidence of Sozomen for the Arian baptism, and that of Philostorgius for the Pagan education, of Attalus. The visible joy of Zosimus, and the discontent which he imputes to the Anician family, are very unfavourable to the Christianity of the new emperor.</NOTE>. The first days of the reign of Attalus were fair and prosperous. An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of Italy submitted to the terror of the Gothic powers; and though the city of Bologna made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted, with loud acclamations, the choice of the Roman senate. At the head of a formidable army, Alaric conducted his royal cap∣tive
<PB N="307" REF="315"/>
almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a so∣lemn embassy of the principal ministers, of Jovius, the Praetorian praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the first of the notaries, was intro∣duced, with martial pomp, into the Gothic camp. In the name of their sovereign, they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his, competitor, and to divide the provinces of Italy and the West between the two emperors. Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting cle∣mency of Attalus, who condescended to promise, that, if Honorius would instantly resign the pur∣ple, he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island <NOTE N="92" PLACE="foot">He carried his insolence so far, as to declare, that he should mutilate Honorius before he sent him into exile. But this assertion of Zosimus is destroyed by the more impartial testimony of Olym∣piodorus, who attributes the ungenerous proposal (which was abso∣lutely rejected by Attalus) to the baseness, and perhaps the treachery, of Jovius.</NOTE>. So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of Theodosius appear, to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that Jovius and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival. Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, Honorius trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger. He dreaded the secret ene∣mies,
<PB N="308" REF="316"/>
who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bed-chamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of Ravenna, to transport the abdi∣cated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.</P>
<P>But there <HI>is</HI> a Providence (such at least was the opinion of the historian Procopius <NOTE N="93" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 2.</NOTE>) that watches <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is de∣graded by Alaric, A. D. 410.</NOTE> over innocence and folly; and the pretensions of Honorius to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed. At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, medi∣tated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of four thousand veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna. To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the fac∣tions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city; and the slumbers of the empe∣ror were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger. The favour∣able intelligence which was received from Africa, suddenly changed the opinions of men, and the state of public affairs. The troops and officers, whom Attalus had sent into that province, were defeated and slain; and the active zeal of Hera∣clian maintained his own allegiance, and that of his people. The faithful count of Africa trans∣mitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the Imperial guards; and his vigi∣lance, in preventing the exportation of corn and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and discontent, into the walls of Rome. The failure of the
<PB N="309" REF="317"/>
African expedition, was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of At∣talus; and the mind of his protector was insen∣sibly alienated from the interest of a prince, who wanted spirit to command, or docility to obey. The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge, or against the advice, of Alaric; and the obstinate refusal of the senate, to allow, in the embarkation, the mixture even of five hundred Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper, which, in their situation, was neither generous nor prudent. The resentment of the Gothic king was exasperated by the mali∣cious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy, by declaring, without a blush, that he had only <HI>seemed</HI> to abandon the service of Honorius, more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper. In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barbarians, the wretched Attalus was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by Alaric, as the pledge of peace and friendship, to the son of Theodosius <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot">See the cause and circumstances of the fall of Attalus in Zosi∣mus, l. vi. p. 380—383.

His indignation was kindled by the report, that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the per∣sonal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace. At the head of three hundred followers, that fearless Barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna; surprised, and cut in pieces, a considerable body of Goths; re-entered the city in triumph; and was permitted to insult his ad∣versary, by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared, that the guilt of Alaric had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor <NOTE N="96" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. vi. p. 384.

But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics; who, either from birth or interest, were attached to the cause of the enemy. At the hour of mid∣night, the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremen∣dous sound of the Gothic trumpet. Eleven hun∣dred and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the Imperial city which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germany and Scythia <NOTE N="97" PLACE="foot">Adest Alaricus, trepidam Roman obsidet, turbat, irrumpit.

<P>The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Respect of the Goths for the Christian religion.</NOTE> entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, how∣ever, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion. He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich them∣selves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people: but he exhorted them, at the same time, to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and
<PB N="312" REF="320"/>
to respect the churches of the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, as holy and inviolable sanctuaries. Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult, several of the Christian Goths displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">Orosius (l. vii. c. 39. p. 573—576.) applauds the piety of the Christian Goths, without seeming to perceive that the greatest part of them were Arian heretics. Jornandes (c. 30. p. 653.) and Isidore of Seville (Chron. p. 714. edit. Grot.), who were both attached to the Gothic cause, have repeated and embellished these edifying tales. According to Isidore, Alaric himself was heard to say, that he waged war with the Romans, and not with the Apostles. Such was the style of the seventh century; two hundred years before, the fame and merit had been ascribed, not to the apostles, but to Christ.</NOTE>. While the Barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by one of the powerful Goths. He immediately demand∣ed, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession; and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate, of the richest ma∣terials, and the most curious workmanship. The Barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: <Q>"These, said she, are the con∣secrated vessels belonging to St. Peter; if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience. For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to

defend."</Q> The Gothic captain, struck with reverential awe, dispatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered; and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle. From the extre∣mity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill, to the distant quarter of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected, with glittering arms, the long train of their devout compa∣nions, who bore aloft, on their heads, the sacred vessels of gold and silver; and the martial shouts of the Barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody. From all the adjacent houses, a crowd of Christians hastened to join this edify∣ing procession; and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age, or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the se∣cure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican. The learned work, concerning the <HI>City of God,</HI> was professedly composed by St. Augustin, to justify the ways of Providence in the destruction of the Roman greatness. He celebrates, with peculiar satisfaction, this memorable triumph of Christ; and insults his adversaries, by challeng∣ing them to produce some similar example, of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either them∣selves, or their deluded votaries <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">See Augustin, de Civitat.

In the sack of Rome, some rare and extraor∣dinary examples of Barbarian virtue had been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pillage and fire of Rome.</NOTE> deservedly applauded. But the holy precincts of the Vatican, and the apostolic churches, could receive a very small proportion of the Roman people: many thousand warriors, more especially of the Huns, who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ; and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that, in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed, and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the Gothic Christians. The writers, the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency, have freely confessed, that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot"><P>Jerom (tom. i. p. 121. ad Principiam) has applied to the sack of Rome all the strong expressions of Virgil:</P>

The despair of the citizens was some∣times converted into fury; and whenever the Barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless. The private
<PB N="315" REF="323"/>
revenge of forty thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes, which they had formerly received, were washed away in the blood of the guilty, or ob∣noxious, families. The matrons and virgins of Rome were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue, for the admiration of future ages <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">Sozomen, l. ix. c. 10. Augustin (de Civitat.

Per∣haps the good bishop of Hippo was too easy in the belief, as well as too rigid in the censure, of this act of female heroism. The twenty maidens (if they ever existed), who threw themselves into the Elbe, when Magdeburgh was taken by storm, have been multiplied to the number of twelve hundred. See Harte's History of Gustavus Adol∣phus, vol. i. p. 308.</NOTE>. A Roman lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the Arian heresy. Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck. The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his re∣sentment, and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave six pieces of gold to the guards of the church, on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband. Such in∣stances of courage and generosity were not ex∣tremely

common. The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites, without consulting either the inclination, or the duties, of their female captives: and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, Whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity <NOTE N="102" PLACE="foot">See Augustin, de Civitat. Dei, l. i. c. 16. 18. He treats the subject with remarkable accuracy; and after admitting that there cannot be any crime, where there is no consent, he adds, Sed quia non solum quod ad dolorem, verum etiam quod ad libidinem, per∣tinet, in corpore alieno perpetrari potest; quicquid tale factum fuerit, etsi retentam constantissimo animo pudicitiam non excutit, pudorem tamen incutit, ne credatur factum cum mentis etiam voluntate, quod fieri fortasse sine carnis aliquâ voluptate non potuit. In c. 18. he makes some curious distinctions between moral and physical virgin∣ity.</NOTE>. There were other losses indeed of a more sub∣stantial kind, and more general concern. It can∣not be presumed, that all the Barbarians were at at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the Ro∣man women from the danger of a rape. But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind, may be procured by the possession of wealth. In the pillage of Rome, a just prefer∣ence was given to gold and jewels, which con∣tain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight: but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of Rome were rudely stripped of their splendid
<PB N="317" REF="325"/>
and costly furniture. The side-boards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons, that always followed the march of a Gothic army. The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled, or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials; and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battle∣axe. The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious Barbarians, who proceeded, by threats, by blows, and by tor∣tures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure <NOTE N="103" PLACE="foot">Marcella, a Roman lady, equally respectable for her rank, her age, and her piety, was thrown on the ground, and cruelly beaten and whipped, caesam fustibus flagellisque, &amp;c.

They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury: and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the Roman pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the <HI>Italians.</HI> At the same aera, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were the terror both of the Old and New World: but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.

The <HI>Germans</HI> were less cor∣rupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spa∣niards; and the rustic, or even savage, aspect of those <HI>Tramontane</HI> warriors, often disguised a simple and merciful disposition. But they had imbibed, in the first fervour of the reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.

The character and political system of the new king of the Goths, may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne; who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St. Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius. <Q>"In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the uni∣verse; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.

From that mo∣ment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish, that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who em∣ployed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the Roman empire <NOTE N="129" PLACE="foot">Orosius, l. vii. c. 43. p. 584, 585.

their quarters from the Mediterranean to the Ocean. The oppressed provincials might exclaim, that the miserable remnant, which the enemy had spared, was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate, or justify, the violence of the Goths. The cities of Gaul, which they attacked, might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Ho∣norius: the articles of the treaty, or the secret instructions of the court, might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular, un∣successful, act of hostility, might always be im∣puted, with an appearance of truth, to the un∣governable spirit of a Barbarian host, impatient of peace or discipline.

The ministers of Honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance, so injurious to every

But the daugh∣ter of Theodosius submitted, without reluctance, to the desires of the conqueror, a young and va∣liant prince, who yielded to Alaric in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.

Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania, obtained an indulgence of five years: the ordinary tribute was reduced to one fifth, and even that fifth was destined to restore, and support the useful institu∣tion of the public posts. By another law, the lands, which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation, were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy, or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors. About the same time, a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and me∣mory of all the <HI>involuntary</HI> offences, which had been committed by his unhappy subjects, during the term of the public disorder and calamity. A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were en∣couraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extra∣ordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa. The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the Barbarians, were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure; and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise; that, in a single day, he had taken an account of the arrival of fourteen thousand strangers <NOTE N="143" PLACE="foot">Olympiodorus ap.

Yet with such an arma∣ment, which might have subverted, or restored, the greatest empires of the earth, the African usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.

<PB N="342" REF="350"/>
of the public disorder, he shared the dominion, and the plunder, of Gaul and Spain; with the tribes of Barbarians, whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees. Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Hono∣rius, he extorted, from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratifica∣tion of his rebellious claims. Constantine en∣gaged himself, by a solemn promise, to deliver Italy from the Goths; advanced as far as the banks of the Po; and after alarming, rather than assisting, his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate, with intemperate luxury, his vain and ostentatious triumph. But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals; who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the Imperial purple, had been left to com∣mand in the provinces of Spain. For some rea∣son, of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed for∣wards, through the Pyrenees, to surprise the two emperors, Constantine and Constans, before they could prepare for their defence. The son was made prisoner at Vienna, and immediately put to death; and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family; which had tempted, or compelled him, sacrile∣giously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the mo∣nastic life. The father maintained a siege within
<PB N="343" REF="351"/>
the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants, had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Ita∣lian army. The name of Honorius, the procla∣mation of a lawful emperor, astonished the con∣tending parties of the rebels. Gerontius, aban∣doned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain; and rescued his name from oblivion, by the Roman courage which appeared to ani∣mate the last moments of his life. In the middle of the night, a great body of his perfidious sol∣diers surrounded, and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded. His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faith∣ful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used, with so much skill and resolution, a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above three hundred of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt. His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such ob∣stinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house. In this fatal extremity, he complied with the request of his Barbarian friend, and cut off his head. The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword; and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who, after three ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger, and sheathed it in

his heart <NOTE N="150" PLACE="foot">The praises which Sozomen has bestowed on this act of de∣spair, appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an ecclesiastical historian.

The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.

<P>The general, Constantius was his name, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and victo∣ries of the general Constan∣tius.</NOTE> raised by his approach the siege of Arles, and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman: and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.

In the familiar intercourse of private life, his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the licence of convivial mirth, to vie

with the pantomimes themselves, in the exercises of their ridiculous profession. But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, Constantius then struck terror into his foes, and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory. He had received from the court of Ra∣venna the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negociation with the Franks and Ale∣manni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon re∣turned, at the head of an army, to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles. The Roman general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the Rhône, and to meet the Barbarians. His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the front, they were suddenly at∣tacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear. The remains of the army of Edobic were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend; who too clearly understood, that the head of his
<PB N="346" REF="354"/>
obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lu∣crative present for the Imperial general. On this occasion, Constantius behaved with the magna∣nimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing, or sup∣pressing, every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas: but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic; and sternly intimated his commands, that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality. The usurper, who beheld, from the walls of Arles, the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror. He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a Christian Presbyter, he ven∣tured to open the gates of the city. But he soon experienced, that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality. The Ro∣man <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the usurper Constan∣tine, A.

rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise. This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of Spain and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion. Before Constantine resigned the pur∣ple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the Imperial camp, that Jovinus had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate, on whom they had bestowed the empire, ad∣vanced, with a formidable host of Barbarians, from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Rhône. Every circumstance is dark and extraor∣dinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to expect, that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorious army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius. The hasty retreat of Constantius might be justified by weighty rea∣sons; but he resigned, without a struggle, the possession of Gaul: and Dardanus, the Praetorian praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate, who refused to yield obedience to the usurper <NOTE N="152" PLACE="foot">Sidonius Apollinaris (l. v. epist. 9. p. 139. and Not.

Yet the praefect supported a respectable character in the world, and even in the church; held a devout correspondence with St. Augustin and St. Jerom; and was complimented by the latter (tom. iii. p. 66.) with the epithets of Christianorum Nobilissime, and Nobilium Christianissime.</NOTE>.

When the Goths, two years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch. Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to as∣sign a cause, or a date), Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on Attalus the ignominious task of negociating the treaty, which ratified his own disgrace. We are again surprised to read, that, instead of con∣sidering the Gothic alliance as the firmest support of his throne, Jovinus upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Se∣bastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince, who knew not how to reward, or punish. Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their in∣heritance, advanced with a body of ten thousand Goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti. He attacked Sarus at an un∣guarded moment, when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his valiant followers. United by friendship, animated by despair, but
<PB N="349" REF="357"/>
at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils <NOTE N="153" PLACE="foot">The expression may be understood almost literally; Olympi∣odorus say, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) may signify a sack, or a loose garment; and this method of entangling and catch∣ing an enemy, laciniis contortis, was much practised by the Huns (Ammian. xxxi. 2.). Il fut pris vif avec des filets, is the trans∣lation of Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 608.</NOTE>, than he was in∣stantly dispatched. The death of Sarus dissolved the loose alliance which Adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul. He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon sa∣tisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit, to the pa∣lace of Ravenna, the heads of the two tyrants, Jovinus and Sebastian. The king of the Goths executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any per∣sonal merit, were abandoned by their Barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of Valentia was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest cities of Gaul. The emperor, chosen by the Roman senate, who had been promoted, de∣graded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate: but when the Gothic king withdrew his protec∣tion, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of At∣talus. The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in one of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and so∣litary
<PB N="350" REF="358"/>
retreat: but he was intercepted at sea, con∣ducted to the presence of Honorius, led in tri∣umph through the streets of Rome or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the second step of the throne of his <HI>invincible</HI> conqueror. The same measure of punishment, with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on Attalus himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of two fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life. The remainder of the reign of Honorius was undisturbed by rebel∣lion; and it may be observed, that, in the space of five years, seven usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince, who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.</P>

The footsteps of the Barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the Chris∣tian aera, the cities of Emerita or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the Roman

As long as the defence of the mountains was en∣trusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the Barbarians. But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post to the Honorian bands, in the service of Constantine; than the gates of Spain were trea∣cherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of Rome by the Goths <NOTE N="155" PLACE="foot">The date is accurately fixed in the Fasti, and the Chronicle of Idatius.

Pes∣tilence soon appeared, the inseparable compa∣nion of famine; a large proportion of the peo∣ple was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends. At length the Barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the

The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the Suevi and the Vandals; the Alani were scattered over the provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of Boetica was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the Vandalic nation. After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again oc∣cupied by a captive people.

A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: Placidia was honourably restored to her brother; six hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths <NOTE N="163" PLACE="foot">This supply was very acceptable: the Goths were insulted by the Vandals of Spain with the epithet of <HI>Truli,</HI> because, in their extreme distress, they had given a piece of gold for a <HI>trula,</HI> or about half a pound of flour.

A bloody war was in∣stantly excited among the Barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have ad∣dressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the Western emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest; the events of which must be favour∣able to the Romans, by the mutual slaughter of

The idea is just; but I can∣not persuade myself that it was entertained, or expressed, by the Barbarians.</NOTE>. The Spanish war was obstinately supported, during three campaigns, with desperate valour, and various success; and the martial atchievements of Wallia diffused through the empire the superior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Boetica. He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those Scy∣thian wanderers, who escaped from the field, in∣stead of chusing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded. The Vandals themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths. The pro∣miscuous multitude of Barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the moun∣tains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass, and on a barren soil, to exer∣cise their domestic and implacable hostilities. In the pride of victory, Wallia was faithful to his engagements: he restored his Spanish conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the Imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their Barbarian ser∣vitude. While the event of the war was still doubtful, the first advantages obtained by the
<PB N="358" REF="366"/>
arms of Wallia, had encouraged the court of Ra∣venna to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign. He entered Rome like the an∣cient conquerors of nations; and if the monu∣ments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should pro∣bably find that a crowd of poets, and orators, of magistrates, and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage, of the emperor Honorius <NOTE N="165" PLACE="foot">Romam triumphans ingreditur, is the formal expression of Prosper's Chronicle.

His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the second Aquitain; a maritime province between the Garonne and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux. That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous in∣habitants were distinguished among the Gauls by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners. The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil, and a temperate

About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bur∣gundians.</NOTE> the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and do∣minion in the provinces of Gaul. The liberal grant of the usurper Jovinus to his Burgundian allies, was confirmed by the lawful emperor: the lands of the First, or Upper, Germany, were ceded to those formidable Barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the two provinces which still retain, with the titles of <HI>Duchy</HI> and of <HI>County,</HI> the national appel∣lation of Burgundy <NOTE N="167" PLACE="foot">Orosius (l. vii. c. 32. p. 550.) commends the mildness and modesty of these Burgundians, who treated their subjects of Gaul as their Christian brethren.

A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials, who had escaped the cala∣mities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.

by the Romans themselves, not only in the in∣solence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord. The Triumvirs proscribed eighteen of the most flourishing colonies of Italy; and distributed their lands and houses to the ve∣terans who revenged the death of Caesar, and op∣pressed the liberty of their country. Two poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar cir∣cumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of Augustus appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the Barbarians, who invaded Gaul, under the reign of Honorius.

The title of Honorius and his successors, their laws, and their civil magistrates, were still respected in the pro∣vinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the Barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent autho∣rity over their native subjects, ambitiously soli∣cited the more honourable rank of master-gene∣rals of the Imperial armies <NOTE N="171" PLACE="foot">This important truth is established by the accuracy of Tille∣mont (Hist. des Emp. tom. v. p. 641.), and by the ingenuity of the Abbé Dubos (Hist. de l'Etablissement de la Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules, tom. i. p. 259.).</NOTE>.

The independence of Britain and Armorica was soon confirmed by Honorius himself, the lawful em∣peror of the West; and the letters, by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety, might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty. This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event. After the usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen, the ma∣ritime provinces were restored to the empire.

Under the mild and gene∣rous influence of liberty, the Roman empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability

But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects. The emperor Honorius ex∣presses his surprise, that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited. A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold, was imposed on the absent representatives; who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their op∣pressors.</P>

These ornaments, and his purple garments, are reserved for his sacred person alone; and his robes of silk are em∣broidered with the figures of golden dragons. His throne is of massy gold. Whenever he appears in public, he is surrounded by his courtiers, his guards, and his attendants. Their spears, their shields, their cuirasses, the bridles and trappings of their horses, have either the substance, or the appearance, of gold; and the large splendid boss in the midst of their shield, is encircled with smaller bosses, which represent the shape of the human eye. The two mules that draw the chariot of the monarch, are perfectly white, and shining all over with gold. The chariot itself, of pure and solid gold, attracts the admiration of the spectators, who contemplate the purple cur∣tains, the snowy carpet, the size of the pre∣cious stones, and the resplendent plates of gold, that glitter as they are agitated by the motion of the carriage. The Imperial pictures are white, on a blue ground; the emperor appears seated on his throne, with his arms, his horses, and his guards beside him; and his vanquished enemies in chains at his feet."</Q> The successors of Constantine established their perpetual residence in the royal city, which he

Inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies, and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received, with each wind, the tributary produc∣tions of every climate; while the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to defy the hostile attempts of the Barbarians.

His former habits of life had not introduced him to the study of the laws, or the exercises of the field; his awkward and unsuc∣cessful

His three services, which Claudian more particularly describes, were these: 1. He spent many years as the catamite of Ptolemy, a groom or soldier of the Imperial stables. 2. Ptolemy gave him to the old general Arintheus, for whom he very skilfully exercised the profes∣sion of a pimp. 3. He was given, on her marriage, to the daughter of Arintheus; and the future consul was employed to comb her hair, to present the silver ewer, to wash, and to fan his mistress in hot weather.

As long as he despoiled the oppressors, who had enriched themselves with the plunder of the peo∣ple, Eutropius might gratify his covetous dis∣position without much envy or injustice: but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had been acquired by lawful inheritance, or laudable industry. The usual methods of ex∣tortion were practised and improved; and Clau∣dian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public auction of the state. <Q>"The impotence of the eunuch" (says that agreeable satirist) "has served only to stimulate his avarice: the same hand which, in his servile condition, was exercised in petty thefts, to unlock the coffers of his master, now grasps the riches of the world; and this infamous broker of the em∣pire appreciates and divides the Roman pro∣vinces, from Mount Haemus to the Tigris. One man, at the expence of his villa, is made proconsul of Asia; a second purchases Syria with his wife's jewels; and a third laments, that he has exchanged his paternal estate for the government of Bithynia. In the anti∣chamber of Eutropius, a large tablet is exposed to public view, which marks the respective prices of the provinces. The different value of Pontus, of Galatia, of Lydia, is accurately distinguished. Lycia may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold; but the opulence of Phrygia will require a more considerable sum. The eunuch wishes to obliterate, by the general disgrace, his personal ignominy; and as he has

been sold himself, he is desirous of selling the rest of mankind. In the eager contention, the balance, which contains the fate and fortunes of the province, often trembles on the beam; and till one of the scales is inclined, by a su∣perior weight, the mind of the impartial judge remains in anxious suspense <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot"><L>—certantum saepe duorum</L>

See Zosimus, l. v. p. 302. Jerom, tom. i. p. 26. The dif∣ference of place is easily reconciled; but the decisive authority of Asterius of Amasia (Orat. iv. p. 76. apud Tillemont, Hist. des Em∣pereurs, tom. v. p. 435.) must turn the scale in favour of Pityus.</NOTE> had reason to dread the first effects of the resentment of Eutro∣pius. He had been guilty of the unpardonable

crime of introducing that abject slave to the pa∣lace of Constantinople: and some degree of praise must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favourite, who was satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor. Abundantius was stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript, and ba∣nished to Pityus, on the Euxine, the last frontier of the Roman world; where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the Barbarians, till he could obtain, after the fall of Eutropius, a milder exile at Sidon in Phoenicia. The destruction of Tima∣sius <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Suidas (most probably from the history of Eunapius) has given a very unfavourable picture of Timasius.

That great officer, the master-general of the armies of Theodosius, had signalised his valour by a decisive victory, which he obtained over the Goths of Thessaly; but he was too prone, after the example of his sovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace, and to abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers. Timasius had despised the public clamour, by promoting an infamous dependent to the com∣mand of a cohort; and he deserved to feel the ingratitude of Bargus, who was secretly instigat∣ed by the favourite to accuse his patron of a trea∣sonable conspiracy. The general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himself; and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne,
<PB N="382" REF="390"/>
to suggest the questions and answers of his sove∣reign. But as this form of trial might be deem∣ed partial and arbitrary, the farther enquiry into the crimes of Timasius was delegated to Satur∣ninus and Procopius; the former of consular rank, the latter still respected as the father-in-law of the emperor Valens. The appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the blunt honesty of Procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the obsequious dexterity of his col∣league, who pronounced a sentence of condemna∣tion against the unfortunate Timasius. His im∣mense riches were confiscated, in the name of the emperor, and for the benefit of the favourite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile at Oasis, a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of Libya <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">The great Oasis was one of the spots in the sands of Libya, watered with springs, and capable of producing wheat, barley, and palm-trees. It was about three days journey from north to south, about half a day in breadth, and at the distance of about five days march to the west of Abydus, on the Nile. See d'Anville, Descrip∣tion de l'Egypte, p. 186, 187, 188. The barren desert which en∣compasses Oasis (Zosimus, l. v. p. 300.) has suggested the idea of comparative fertility, and even the epithet of the <HI>happy island</HI> (Hero∣dot. iii. 26.).</NOTE>. Secluded from all human converse, the master-general of the Roman armies was lost for ever to the world; but the circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and con∣tradictory manner.

<P>The public hatred, and the despair of indi∣viduals, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel and unjust law of treason, A.

I. It is enacted, in the name, and by the autho∣rity, of Arcadius, that all those who shall con∣spire, either with subjects, or with strangers, against the lives of any of the persons whom the emperor considers as the members of his own body, shall be punished with death and confis∣cation. This species of fictitious and metaphori∣cal treason is extended to protect, not only the <HI>illustrious</HI> officers of the state and army, who are admitted into the sacred consistory, but likewise the principal domestics of the palace, the senators of Constantinople, the military commanders, and the civil magistrates of the provinces: a vague and indefinite list, which, under the successors of Constantine, included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers. II. This extreme severity might perhaps be justified, had it been only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from any actual violence in the exe∣cution of their office. But the whole body of Imperial dependents claimed a privilege, or rather impunity, which screened them, in the loosest moments of their lives, from the hasty, perhaps the justifiable, resentment of their fellow-citizens: and, by a strange perversion of the laws, the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private quarrel, and to a deliberate conspi∣racy against the emperor and the empire. The edict of Arcadius most positively and most ab∣surdly declares, that in such cases of treason, <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>actions</HI> ought to be punished with equal severity; that the knowledge of a mis∣chievous intention, unless it be instantly revealed,

Stigmatised with hereditary in∣famy, excluded from the hopes of honours or fortune, let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt, till they shall consider life as a calamity, and death as a comfort and relief."</Q> In such words, so well adapted to insult the feel∣ings of mankind, did the emperor, or rather his favourite eunuch, applaud the moderation of a law, which transferred the same unjust and in∣human penalties to the children of all those who had seconded, or who had not disclosed, these fictitious conspiracies.

yet they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital. Every misfortune was exag∣gerated in dark and doubtful hints; and the future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious conjecture. Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country, the Romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage of Mount Taurus, and the invasion of Syria. If he descended towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to the Gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the harbours of Ionia, and of extending his depre∣dations along the maritime coast, from the mouth of the Nile to the port of Constantinople. The approach of danger, and the obstinacy of Tribi∣gild, who refused all terms of accommodation, compelled Eutropius to summon a council of war <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">The council of Eutropius, in Claudian, may be compared to that of Domitian in the fourth satire of Juvenal.

and the dulness of his mind, was surnamed the Ajax of the East, had deserted his original trade of a woolcomber, to exercise, with much less skill and success, the military profession: and his uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed, with an ignorance of real difficulties, and a timorous neglect of every favourable op∣portunity. The rashness of the Ostrogoths had drawn them into a disadvantageous position be∣tween the rivers Melas and Eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the peasants of Pamphylia; but the arrival of an Imperial army, instead of completing their destruction, afforded the means of safety and victory. Tribigild sur∣prised the unguarded camp of the Romans, in the darkness of the night; seduced the faith of the greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries, and dissipated, without much effort, the troops, which had been corrupted by the relaxation of discipline, and the luxury of the capital. The discontent of Gainas, who had so boldly contrived and exe∣cuted the death of Rufinus, was irritated by the fortune of his unworthy successor; he accused his own dishonourable patience under the servile reign of an eunuch; and the ambitious Goth was convicted, at least in the public opinion, of secretly fomenting the revolt of Tribigild, with whom he was connected by a domestic, as well as by a national, alliance <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">The <HI>conspiracy</HI> of Gainas and Tribigild, which is attested by the Greek historian, had not reached the ears of Claudian, who at∣tributes the revolt of the Ostrogoths to his own <HI>martial</HI> spirit, and the advice of his wife.</NOTE>.

To the Imperial court he repeatedly magnified the valour, the genius, the inexhaust∣ible resources of Tribigild; confessed his own inability to prosecute the war; and extorted the permission of negotiating with his invincible ad∣versary.

In this hour of distress and despair, his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church, whose privileges he had wisely, or profanely, attempted to circumscribe; and the most eloquent of the saints, John Chrysostom, enjoyed the triumph of protecting a prostrate minister, whose choice had raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of Con∣stantinople. The archbishop, ascending the pul∣pit of the cathedral, that he might be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either sex and of every age, pronounced a seasonable and pathetic discourse on the forgiveness of in∣juries, and the instability of human greatness. The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch, who lay groveling under the table of the altar, exhibited a solemn and instructive spectacle; and the orator, who was afterwards accused of in∣sulting the misfortunes of Eutropius, laboured to excite the contempt, that he might assuage the fury, of the people <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">See the Homily of Chrysostom, tom. iii. p. 381—386. of which the exordium is particularly beautiful.

The vain hope of eluding, by a change of place, the obligation of an oath, engaged the empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution, from Constantinople to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon. The consul Aurelian pro∣nounced the sentence; and the motives of that sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government.

Gainas bowed, with re∣verence, at the feet of the emperor, whilst he required the sacrifice of Aurelian and Saturninus, two ministers of consular rank; and their naked necks were exposed, by the haughty rebel, to the edge of the sword, till he condescended to grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite. The Goths, according to the terms of the agreement, were immediately transported from Asia into Europe; and their victorious chief, who accepted the title of master-general of the Roman armies, soon filled Constantinople with his troops, and distributed among his dependents, the honours and rewards of the empire. In his early youth, Gainas had passed the Danube as a suppliant, and a fugitive: his elevation had been the work of valour and fortune; and his indiscreet, or perfi∣dious conduct, was the cause of his rapid down∣fal. Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the archbishop, he importunately claimed, for his Arian sectaries, the possession of a peculiar church; and the pride of the catholics was of∣fended by the public toleration of heresy <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">The pious remonstrances of Chrysostom, which do not appear in his own writings, are strongly urged by Theodoret; but his in∣sinuation, that they were successful, is disproved by facts.

In this state of <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20.</NOTE> mutual and suspicious hostility, the guards, and the people of Constantinople, shut the gates, and rose in arms to prevent, or to punish, the conspiracy of the Goths. During the absence of Gainas, his troops were surprised and oppressed; seven thousand Barbarians perished in this bloody massacre. In the fury of the pursuit, the catho∣lics uncovered the roof, and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood, till they over∣whelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or conventicle of the Arians. Gainas was either innocent of the design, or too confident of his success: he was astonished by the intelli∣gence, that the flower of his army had been in∣gloriously destroyed; that he himself was declared a public enemy; and that his countryman, Fra∣vitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had assumed the management of the war by sea and land. The enterprises of the rebel, against the cities of Thrace, were encountered by a firm and well∣ordered defence: his hungry soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin of
<PB N="396" REF="404"/>
the fortifications; and Gainas, who vainly re∣gretted the wealth and luxury of Asia, embraced a desperate resolution of forcing the passage of the Hellespont. He was destitute of vessels; but the woods of the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsonesus afforded materials for rafts, and his intrepid Barbarians did not re∣fuse to trust themselves to the waves.

This de∣sign was secretly communicated to the national troops, who devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader; and before the signal of depar∣ture was given, a great number of provincial auxiliaries, whom he suspected of an attachment to their native country, were perfidiously mas∣sacred. The Goths advanced, by rapid marches, through the plains of Thrace; and they were soon delivered from the fear of a pursuit, by the vanity of Fravitta, who, instead of extinguishing the war, hastened to enjoy the popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honours of the con∣sulship.

<P>After the death of the indolent Nectarius, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Election and merit of Chry∣sostom, A.

On this occasion, Eutropius seems to have deviated from his ordinary maxims; and his uncorrupted judgment was determined only by the superior merit of a stranger. In a late journey into the East, he had admired the sermons of John, a native and presbyter of An∣tioch, whose name has been distinguished by the epithet of Chrysostom, or the Golden Mouth <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">The sixth book of Socrates, the eighth of Sozomen, and the fifth of Theodoret, afford curious and authentic materials for the life of John Chrysostom.

A private order was dispatched to the governor of Syria; and as the people might be unwilling to resign their favourite preacher, he was trans∣ported, with speed and secrecy, in a post-chariot, from Antioch to Constantinople. The unani∣mous and unsolicited consent of the court, the clergy, and the people, ratified the choice of the minister; and, both as a saint and as an orator, the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine ex∣pectations of the public. Born of a noble and opulent family, in the capital of Syria, Chrysos∣tom had been educated, by the care of a tender mother, under the tuition of the most skilful masters. He studied the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius; and that celebrated sophist, who soon discovered the talents of his disciple, ingenuously confessed, that John would have de∣served to succeed him, had he not been stolen away by the Christians. His piety soon disposed
<PB N="400" REF="408"/>
him to receive the sacrament of baptism; to re∣nounce the lucrative and honourable profession of the law; and to bury himself in the adjacent desert, where he subdued the lusts of the flesh by an austere pennance of six years. His infirmities compelled him to return to the society of man∣kind; and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the service of the church: but in the midst of his family, and afterwards on the archie∣piscopal throne, Chrysostom still persevered in the practice of the monastic virtues. The ample revenues, which his predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury, he deligently applied to the establishment of hospitals; and the multitudes, who were supported by his charity, preferred the eloquent and edifying discourses of their arch∣bishop, to the amusements of the theatre, or the circus. The monuments of that eloquence, which was admired near twenty years at Antioch and Constantinople, have been carefully pre∣served; and the possession of near one thousand sermons, or homilies, has authorised the critics <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">As I am <HI>almost</HI> a stranger to the voluminous sermons of Chry∣sostom, I have given my confidence to the two most judicious and moderate of the ecclesiastical critics, Erasmus (tom. iii. p. 1344.), and Dupin (Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique, tom. iii. p. 38.): yet the good taste of the former is sometimes vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity; and the good sense of the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations.</NOTE> of succeeding times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom. They unanimously attri∣bute to the Christian orator, the free command of an elegant and copious language; the judg∣ment to conceal the advantages which he derived
<PB N="401" REF="409"/>
from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy; an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and simili∣tudes, of ideas and images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics; the happy art of en∣gaging the passions in the service of virtue; and of exposing the folly, as well as the turpitude, of vice, almost with the truth and spirit of a dra∣matic representation.</P>
<P>The pastoral labours of the archbishop of Con∣stantinople <NOTE PLACE="marg">His admi∣nistration and de∣fects, A. D. 398—403.</NOTE> provoked, and gradually united against him, two sorts of enemies; the aspiring clergy, who envied his success, and the obstinate sinners, who were offended by his reproofs. When Chry∣sostom thundred, from the pulpit of St. Sophia, against the degeneracy of the Christians, his shafts were spent among the crowd, without wounding, or even marking, the character of any individual. When he declaimed against the pe∣culiar vices of the rich, poverty might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives: but the guilty were still sheltered by their numbers; and the reproach itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority, and enjoyment. But as the pyramid rose towards the summit, it insensibly diminished to a point; and the magistrates, the ministers, the favourite eunuchs, the ladies of the court <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">The females of Constantinople distinguished themselves by their enmity or their attachment to Chrysostom.

The personal applications of the audience were anticipated, or confirmed, by the testimony of their own conscience; and the intrepid preacher assumed the dangerous right of exposing both the offence, and the offender, to the public abhorrence. The secret resentment of the court encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of Constantinople, who were too has∣tily reformed by the fervent zeal of their arch∣bishop. He had condemned, from the pulpit, the domestic females of the clergy of Constanti∣nople, who, under the name of servants, or sisters, afforded a perpetual occasion either of sin, or of scandal. The silent and solitary ascetics, who had secluded themselves from the world, were intitled to the warmest approbation of Chryso∣stom; but he despised and stigmatised, as the disgrace of their holy profession, the crowd of degenerate monks, who, from some unworthy motives of pleasure or profit, so frequently in∣fested the streets of the capital. To the voice of persuasion, the archbishop was obliged to add the terrors of authority; and his ardour, in the ex∣ercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, was not al∣ways exempt from passion; nor was it always guided by prudence. Chrysostom was naturally of a choleric disposition <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Sozomen, and more especially Socrates, have defined the real character of Chrysostom with a temperate and impartial freedom, very offensive to his blind admirers.

Although he strug∣gled,

He detested the noise and le∣vity of great dinners. 5. He saved the expence for the use of the poor. 6.

Se∣parated from that familiar intercourse, which fa∣cilitates the knowledge and the dispatch of bu∣siness, he reposed an unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion; and seldom applied his spe∣culative knowledge of human nature to the par∣ticular characters, either of his dependents, or of his equals. Conscious of the purity of his inten∣tions, and perhaps of the superiority of his ge∣nius, the archbishop of Constantinople extended the jurisdiction of the Imperial city, that he might enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labours; and the conduct which the profane imputed to an am∣bitious motive, appeared to Chrysostom himself
<PB N="404" REF="412"/>
in the light of a sacred and indispensable duty. In his visitation through the Asiatic provinces, he deposed thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phry∣gia; and indiscreetly declared, that a deep cor∣ruption of simony and licentiousness had infected the whole episcopal order <NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Chrysostom declares his free opinion (tom. ix. hom. iii. in Act.

A bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of Constantino∣ple; but the frivolous or improbable nature of the forty-seven articles which they presented against him, may justly be considered as a fair and unexceptionable panegyric. Four successive summons were signified to Chrysostom; but he still refused to trust either his person, or his re∣putation, in the hands of his implacable enemies, who prudently declining the examination of any particular charges, condemned his contumacious disobedience, and hastily pronounced a sentence of deposition. The synod of the <HI>Oak</HI> immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their judgment, and charitably insinuated, that the penalties of treason might be inflicted on the au∣dacious preacher, who had reviled, under the name of Jezabel, the empress Eudoxia herself.

A sea∣sonable earthquake justified the interposition of heaven; the torrent of sedition rolled forwards to the gates of the palace; and the empress, agitated by fear, or remorse, threw herself at the feet of Arcadius, and confessed, that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration of Chrysostom. The Bosphorus was covered with innumerable vessels; the shores of Europe and Asia were profusely illuminated; and the accla∣mations of a victorious people accompanied, from the port to the cathedral, the triumph of the archbishop; who, too easily, consented to resume the exercise of his functions, before his sentence had been legally reversed by the authority of an ecclesiastical synod.

Instead of listening to his humble prayer, that he might be permitted to reside at Cyzicus, or Nicomedia, the inflexible empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of Cucusus, among the ridges of Mount Taurus, in the Lesser Armenia. A secret hope was entertained, that the archbishop might perish in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days in the heat of summer, through the provinces of Asia Minor, where he was continually threatened by the hos∣tile attacks of the Isaurians, and the more im∣placable fury of the monks. Yet Chrysostom arrived in safety at the place of his confinement; and the three years, which he spent at Cucusus, and the neighbouring town of Arabissus, were the last and most glorious of his life. His cha∣racter was consecrated by absence and persecu∣tion;

The mind of the illustrious exile was still independent; but his captive body was ex∣posed to the revenge of the oppressors, who con∣tinued to abuse the name and authority of Arca∣dius <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot">After the exile of Chrysostom, Theophilus published an <HI>enor∣mous</HI> and <HI>horrible</HI> volume against him, in which he perpetually repeats the polite expressions of hostem humanitatis, sacrilegorum principem, immundum daemonem; he affirms, that John Chrysostom had deli∣vered his soul to be adulterated by the devil; and wishes that some farther punishment, adequate (if possible) to the magnitude of his crimes, may be inflicted on him.

Yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained, whether any stain of hereditary guilt could be derived from Arcadius to his successor. Eudoxia <NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Arca∣dius, A. D. 408, May 1.</NOTE> was a young and beautiful woman, who indulged her passions, and despised her husband: Count John enjoyed, at least, the familiar confidence of the empress; and the public named him as the real father of Theodosius the younger <NOTE N="59" PLACE="foot">Zosimus, l. v. p. 315. The chastity of an empress should not be impeached without producing a witness; but it is astonishing, that the witness should write and live under a prince, whose legiti∣macy he dared to attack.

The birth of a son was accepted, however, by the pious husband, as an event the most fortunate and honourable to himself, to his family, and to the eastern world: and the royal infant, by an unprecedented favour, was invested with the titles of Caesar and Augustus.

Arca∣dius considered, with anxious foresight, the help∣less condition of his son Theodosius, who was no more than seven years of age, the dangerous fac∣tions of a minority, and the aspiring spirit of Jezde∣gerd,
<PB N="413" REF="421"/>
the Persian monarch. Instead of tempting the allegiance of an ambitious subject, by the participation of supreme power, he boldly ap∣pealed to the magnanimity of a king; and placed, by a solemn testament, the sceptre of the East in the hands of Jezdegerd himself. The royal guar∣dian accepted and discharged this honourable trust with unexampled fidelity; and the infancy of Theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of Persia. Such is the singular narrative of Procopius; and his veracity is not disputed by Agathias <NOTE N="64" PLACE="foot">Agathias, l. iv. p. 136, 137. Although he confesses the pre∣valence of the tradition, he asserts, that Procopius was the first who had committed it to writing.

His criticism was not warped by any ecclesiastical authority: both Procopius and Agathias are half Pagans.</NOTE>, while he presumes to dissent from his judgment, and to arraign the wisdom of a Christian emperor, who, so rashly, though so fortunately, committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a stranger, a rival, and a heathen. At the distance of one hundred and fifty years, this political question might be de∣bated in the court of Justinian; but a prudent historian will refuse to examine the <HI>propriety,</HI> till he has ascertained the <HI>truth,</HI> of the testament of Arcadius. As it stands without a parallel in the history of the world, we may justly require, that it should be attested by the positive and unani∣mous evidence of contemporaries. The strange novelty of the event, which excites our distrust, must have attracted their notice; and their uni∣versal

<P>The maxims of Roman jurisprudence, if they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adminis∣tration of Anthe∣mius, A. D. 408—415.</NOTE> could fairly be transferred from private property to public dominion, would have adjudged to the emperor Honorius the guardianship of his nephew, till he had attained, at least, the fourteenth year of his age. But the weakness of Honorius, and the calamities of his reign, disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim; and such was the absolute separation of the two monarchies, both in interest and affection, that Constantinople would have obeyed, with less reluctance, the orders of the Persian, than those of the Italian, court. Under a prince, whose weakness is disguised by the external signs of manhood and discretion, the most worthless favourites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace; and dictate to submissive provinces, the commands of a master, whom they direct and despise. But the ministers of a child, who is incapable of arming them with the sanc∣tion of the royal name, must acquire and exercise an independent authority. The great officers of the state and army, who had been appointed be∣fore the death of Arcadius, formed an aristo∣cracy, which might have inspired them with the idea of a free republic; and the government of the eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the praefect Anthemius <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Socrates, l. vii. c. 1. Anthemius was the grandson of Philip, one of the ministers of Constantius, and the grandfather of the em∣peror Anthemius.

abilities, a lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals. The safety of the young emperor proved the merit and integrity of Anthemius; and his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation of an infant reign. Uldin, with a formidable host of Barbarians, was encamped in the heart of Thrace: he proudly rejected all terms of accommodation; and, pointing to the rising sun, declared to the Roman ambassadors, that the course of that planet should alone terminate the conquests of the Huns. But the desertion of his confederates, who were privately convinced of the justice and liberality of the Imperial mi∣nisters, obliged Uldin to repass the Danube: the tribe of the Scyrri, which composed his rear∣guard, was almost extirpated; and many thou∣sand captives were dispersed, to cultivate, with servile labour, the fields of Asia <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Sozomen, l. ix. c. 5.

was inscribed on a tablet of gold and gems; which they publicly offered in the great church of Con∣stantinople. Their palace was converted into a monastery; and all males, except the guides of their conscience, the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes, were scrupulously ex∣cluded from the holy threshold. Pulcheria, her two sisters, and a chosen train of favourite dam∣sels, formed a religious community: they re∣nounced the vanity of dress; interrupted, by fre∣quent fasts, their simple and frugal diet; allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery; and devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of prayer and psalmody. The piety of a Christian virgin was adorned by the zeal and liberality of an empress. Ecclesiastical history describes the splendid churches, which were built at the expence of Pulcheria, in all the provinces of the East; her charitable foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor; the ample donations which she assigned for the per∣petual maintenance of monastic societies; and the active severity with which she laboured to suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches. Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar favour of the Deity; and the relics of martyrs, as well as the knowledge of future events, were communicated in visions and reve∣lations to the Imperial saint <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">She was admonished, by repeated dreams, of the place where the relics of the forty martyrs had been buried. The ground had successively belonged to the house and garden of a woman of Con∣stantinople, to a monastery of Macedonian monks, and to a church of St. Thyrsus, erected by Caesarius, who was consul A. D. 397; and the memory of the relics was almost obliterated. Notwithstand∣ing the charitable wishes of Dr. Jortin (Remarks, tom. iv. p. 234.), it is not easy to acquit Pulcheria of some share in the pious fraud; which must have been transacted, when she was more than five-and-thirty years of age.</NOTE>. Yet the devotion
<PB N="418" REF="426"/>
of Pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable at∣tention from temporal affairs; and she alone, among all the descendants of the great Theodo∣sius, appears to have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities. The elegant and fa∣miliar use which she had acquired, both of the Greek and Latin languages, was readily applied to the various occasions of speaking, or writing, on public business: her deliberations were ma∣turely weighed; her actions were prompt and de∣cisive; and, while she moved without noise or ostentation the wheel of government, she dis∣creetly attributed to the genius of the emperor, the long tranquillity of his reign. In the last years of his peaceful life, Europe was indeed af∣flicted by the arms of Attila; but the more ex∣tensive provinces of Asia still continued to enjoy a profound and permanent repose. Theodosius the younger was never reduced to the disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebel∣lious subject: and since we cannot applaud the vigour, some praise may be due to the mildness, and prosperity, of the administration of Pul∣cheria.</P>
<P>The Roman world was deeply interested in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Education and cha∣racter of Theodo∣sius the younger.</NOTE> education of its master. A regular course of study and exercise was judiciously instituted; of
<PB N="419" REF="427"/>
the military exercises of riding, and shooting with the bow; of the liberal studies of grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy: the most skilful masters of the East ambitiously solicited the attention of their royal pupil; and several noble youths were introduced into the palace, to animate his dili∣gence by the emulation of friendship. Pulcheria alone discharged the important task of instructing her brother in the arts of government; but her precepts may countenance some suspicion of the extent of her capacity, or of the purity of her in∣tentions. She taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment; to walk, to hold his robes, to seat himself on his throne, in a manner worthy of a great prince; to abstain from laugh∣ter; to listen with condescension; to return suit∣able answers; to assume, by turns, a serious or a placid countenance; in a word, to represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman emperor. But Theodosius <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">There is a remarkable difference between the two ecclesiastical historians, who in general bear so close a resemblance.

<PB N="420" REF="428"/>
presume to measure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakness of his father and his uncle. Arcadius and Honorius had been assisted by the guardian care of a parent, whose lessons were en∣forced by his authority, and example. But the unfortunate prince, who is born in the purple, must remain a stranger to the voice of truth; and the son of Arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy, encompassed only by a ser∣vile train of women and eunuchs. The ample leisure, which he acquired by neglecting the es∣sential duties of his high office, was filled by idle amusements, and unprofitable studies. Hunting was the only active pursuit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he most assiduously laboured, sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp, in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the elegance with which he transcribed religious books, entitled the Roman emperor to the singular epithet of <HI>Calligraphes,</HI> or a fair writer. Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil, Theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved; he loved those who were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence; and as he never perused the pa∣pers that were presented for the royal signature, the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his character, were frequently perpetrated in his name. The emperor himself was chaste, tem∣perate, liberal, and merciful; but these qua∣lities, which can only deserve the name of vir∣tues, when they are supported by courage, and
<PB N="421" REF="429"/>
regulated by discretion, were seldom beneficial, and they sometimes proved mischievous, to man∣kind. His mind, enervated by a royal educa∣tion, was oppressed, and degraded, by abject superstition: he fasted, he sung psalms, he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines, with which his faith was continually nourished. Theodo∣sius devoutly worshipped the dead and living saints of the Catholic church; and he once re∣fused to eat, till an insolent monk, who had cast an excommunication on his sovereign, conde∣scended to heal the spiritual wound which he had inflicted <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Theodoret, l. v. c. 37.

The most ancient account of her history is in John Malala (part ii. p. 20, 21. edit. Venet. 1743), and in the Paschal Chronicle (p. 311, 312.). Those authors had probably seen original pictures of the empress Eudocia. The modern Greeks, Zonaras, Cedrenus, &amp;c. have displayed the love, rather than the talent, of fiction. From Nicephorus, indeed, I have ventured to assume her age. The writer of a romance would not have <HI>imagined,</HI> that Athenais was near twenty-eight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young emperor.</NOTE> was educated by her father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the Greeks; and so ad∣vantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philosopher entertained of his contemporaries,
<PB N="422" REF="430"/>
that he divided his patrimony between his two sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively con∣fidence that her beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion. The jealousy and avarice of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge at Constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice, or favour, to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria. That sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint; and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the East, who had now attained the twentieth year of his age. She easily excited the curiosity of her bro∣ther, by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais; large eyes, a well-proportioned nose, a fair complexion, golden locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanour, an understanding improv∣ed by study, and a virtue tried by distress, Theodosius, concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modest youth imme∣diately declared his pure and honourable love; and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the provinces. Athenais, who was easily persuaded to renounce the errors of Paganism, received at her baptism the Christian name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of Augusta, till the wife of Theodosius had approved her fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen years afterwards, the emperor of the West. The
<PB N="423" REF="431"/>
brothers of Eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety, her Imperial summons; but, as she could easily forgive their fortunate unkindness, she indulged the tenderness, or perhaps the vanity, of a sister, by promoting them to the rank of consuls and praefects. In the luxury of the palace, she still cultivated those ingenious arts, which had con∣tributed to her greatness; and wisely dedicated her talents to the honour of religion, and of her husband. Eudocia composed a poeticall para∣phrase of the first eight books of the Old Testa∣ment, and of the prophecies of Daniel and Za∣chariah; a cento of the verses of Homer, appli∣ed to the life and miracles of Christ, the legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Persian victories of Theodosius: and her writings, which were applauded by a servile and superstitious age, have not been disdained by the candour of im∣partial criticism <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">Socrates, l. vii. c. 21. Photius, p. 413—420. The Homeric cento is still extant, and has been repeatedly printed; but the claim of Eudocia to that insipid performance is disputed by the critics. See Fabricius, Biblioth. Graec. tom. i. p. 357. The <HI>Ionia,</HI> a mis∣cellaneous dictionary of history and fable, was compiled by another empress of the name of Eudocia, who lived in the eleventh century; and the work is still extant in manuscript.</NOTE>. The fondness of the emperor was not abated by time and possession; and Eu∣docia, after the marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful vows by a so∣lemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Her ostentatious progress through the East may seem inconsistent with the spirit of Christian humility: she pro∣nounced, from a throne of gold and gems, an
<PB N="424" REF="432"/>
eloquent oration to the senate of Antioch, declar∣ed her royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city, bestowed a donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public baths, and accepted the statues, which were decreed by the gratitude of Antioch. In the Holy Land, her alms and pious foundations exceeded the muni∣ficence of the great Helena; and though the public treasure might be impoverished by this excessive liberality, she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of returning to Constantinople with the chains of St. Peter, the right arm of St. Ste∣phen, and an undoubted picture of the Virgin, painted by St. Luke <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A. D. 438, 439.) is copious and florid; but he is accused of placing the lies of different ages on the same level of authenticity.</NOTE>. But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of the glories of Eudocia. Satiat∣ed with empty pomp, and unmindful, perhaps, of her obligations to Pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired to the government of the Eastern empire: the palace was distracted by female discord; but the victory was at last decided, by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius. The exe∣cution of Paulinus, master of the offices, and the disgrace of Cyrus, Praetorian praefect of the East, convinced the public, that the favour of Eudocia was insufficient to protect her most faith∣ful friends; and the uncommon beauty of Pauli∣nus encouraged the secret rumour, that his guilt was that of a successful lover <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">In this short view of the disgrace of Eudocia, I have imitated the caution of Evagrius (l. i. c. 21.), and count Marcellinus (in Chron.

As soon as the
<PB N="425" REF="433"/>
empress perceived that the affection of Theodo∣sius was irretrievably lost, she requested the per∣mission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jeru∣salem. She obtained her request; but the jea∣lousy of Theodosius, or the vindictive spirit of Pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat; and Saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish with death two ecclesiastics, her most favoured servants. Eudocia instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count: the furious passions, which she indulged on this suspicious occasion, seemed to justify the severity of Theo∣dosius; and the empress, ignominiously stript of the honours of her rank <NOTE N="78" PLACE="foot">Priscus (in Excerpt.

The remainder of the life of Eudocia, about sixteen years, was spent in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of Theodosius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a captive from Rome to Carthage, and the society of the Holy Monks of Palestine, insensibly con∣firmed the religious temper of her mind. After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life, the daughter of the philosopher Leontius expired, at Jerusalem, in the sixty-seventh year of her age; protesting with her dying breath,

that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence and friendship <NOTE N="79" PLACE="foot">For the <HI>two</HI> pilgrimages of Eudocia, and her long residence at Jerusalem, her devotion, alms, &amp;c. see Socrates (l. vii. c. 47.) and Evagrius (l. i. c. 20, 21, 22.). The Paschal Chronicle may sometimes deserve regard; and, in the domestic history of Antioch, John Malala becomes a writer of good authority. The Abbé Gue∣née, in a memoir on the fertility of Palestine, of which I have only seen an extract, calculates the gifts of Eudocia at 20,488 pounds of gold, above 800,000 pounds Sterling.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The gentle mind of Theodosius was never in∣flamed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per∣sian war, A. D. 422.</NOTE> by the ambition of conquest, or military renown; and the slight alarm of a Persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East. The motives of this war were just and honourable. In the last year of the reign of Jezdegerd, the supposed guardian of Theodosius, a bishop, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom, destroyed one of the fire-temples of Susa <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Theodoret, l. v. c. 39. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xii. p. 356—364. Assemanni, bibliot. Oriental. tom. iii. p. 396. tom. iv. p. 61. Theodoret blames the rashness of Abdas, but extols the constancy of his martyrdom. Yet I do not clearly understand the casuistry which prohibits our repairing the damage which we have unlawfully committed.</NOTE>. His zeal and ob∣stinacy were revenged on his brethren: the Magi excited a cruel persecution; and the intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his son Vara∣ranes, or Bahram, who soon afterwards ascended the throne. Some Christian fugitives, who escaped to the Roman frontier, were sternly de∣manded, and generously refused; and the refusal, aggravated by commercial disputes, soon kindled a war between the rival monarchies. The moun∣tains of Armenia, and the plains of Mesopotamia,
<PB N="427" REF="435"/>
were filled with hostile armies; but the operations of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive or memorable events. Some en∣gagements were fought, some towns were besieg∣ed, with various and doubtful success; and if the Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long lost possession of Nisibis, the Persians were repulsed from the walls of a Mesopotamian city, by the valour of a martial bishop, who pointed his thundering engine in the name of St. Thomas the Apostle. Yet the splendid victories, which the incredible speed of the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of Constan∣tinople, were celebrated with festivals and pane∣gyrics. From these panegyrics the <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">Socrates (l. vii. c. 18, 19, 20, 21.) is the best author for the Persian war. We may likewise consult the three Chronicles, the Paschal, and those of Marcellinus and Malala.</NOTE> historians of the age might borrow their extraordinary, and, perhaps, fabulous, tales; of the proud challenge of a Persian hero, who was entangled by the net, and dispatched by the sword, of Areobindus the Goth; of the ten thousand <HI>Immortals,</HI> who were slain in the attack of the Roman camp; and of the hundred thousand Arabs, or Saracens, who were impelled by a panic terror to throw them∣selves headlong into the Euphrates. Such events may be disbelieved, or disregarded; but the charity of a bishop, Acacius of Amida, whose name might have dignified the saintly calendar, shall not be lost in oblivion. Boldly declaring, that vases of gold and silver are useless to a God
<PB N="428" REF="436"/>
who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate sold the plate of the church of Amida; employ∣ed the price in the redemption of seven thousand Persian captives; supplied their wants with affec∣tionate liberality; and dismissed them to their native country, to inform the king of the true spirit of the religion which he persecuted. The practice of benevolence in the midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of contend∣ing nations; and I wish to persuade myself, that Acacius contributed to the restoration of peace. In the conference which was held on the limits of the two empires, the Roman ambassadors degrad∣ed the personal character of their sovereign, by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power; when they seriously advised the Persians to pre∣vent, by a timely accommodation, the wrath of a monarch, who was yet ignorant of this distant war. A truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified; and, although the revolutions of Ar∣menia might threaten the public tranquillity, the essential conditions of this treaty were respected near fourscore years by the successors of Constan∣tine and Artaxerxes.</P>
<P>Since the Roman and Parthian standards first <NOTE PLACE="marg">Armenia divided be∣tween the Persians and the Romans,</NOTE> encountered on the banks of the Euphrates, the kingdom of Armenia <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">This account of the ruin and division of the kingdom of Ar∣menia is taken from the third book of the Armenian history of Moses of Chorene.

by its formidable protectors; and, in the course of this History, several events, which inclined the balance of peace and war, have been already re∣lated. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 431—440.</NOTE> A disgraceful treaty had resigned Arme∣nia to the ambition of Sapor; and the scale of Persia appeared to preponderate. But the royal race of Arsaces impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan; the turbulent nobles asserted, or be∣trayed, their hereditary independence; and the nation was still attached to the <HI>Christian</HI> princes of Constantinople. In the beginning of the fifth century, Armenia was divided by the progress of war and faction <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">The western Armenians used the Greek language and charac∣ters in their religious offices; but the use of that hostile tongue was prohibited by the Persians in the eastern provinces, which were obliged to use the Syriac, till the invention of the Armenian letters by Mesrobes, in the beginning of the fifth century, and the subse∣quent version of the Bible into the Armenian language; an event which relaxed the connection of the church and nation with Con∣stantinople.</NOTE>; and the unnatural division precipitated the downfal of that ancient monarchy. Chosroes, the Persian vassal, reigned over the Eastern and most extensive portion of the coun∣try; while the Western province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces, and the supremacy of the emperor Arcadius. After the death of Ar∣saces, the Romans suppressed the regal govern∣ment, and imposed on their allies the condition of subjects. The military command was dele∣gated to the count of the Armenian frontier; the city of Theodosiopolis <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Moses Choren. l. iii. c. 59. p. 309. and p. 358.

<PB N="430" REF="438"/>
a strong situation, on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the Euphrates; and the de∣pendent territories were ruled by five satraps, whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and envied the honours of their equals, were provoked to nego∣ciate their peace and pardon at the Persian court; and returning, with their followers, to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Chosroes for their law∣ful sovereign. About thirty years afterwards, Artasires, the nephew and successor of Chosroes, fell under the displeasure of the haughty and ca∣pricious nobles of Armenia; and they unani∣mously desired a Persian governor in the room of an unworthy king. The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose sanction they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a superstitious peo∣ple. He deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of Artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to accuse him before the tribunal of a Christian emperor, who would punish, without destroying, the sinner. "Our king," continued Isaac, <Q>"is too much addicted to licentious plea∣sures, but he has been purified in the holy waters of baptism. He is a lover of women, but he does not adore the fire or the elements. He may deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is an undoubted Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are flagitious.

D. 431. (l. iii. c. 61. p. 312.); and under Veramus, or Bahram, king of Persia (l. iii. c. 64. p. 317.), who reigned from A. D. 420 to 440. See Assemanni, Bibliot.

were soon terminated by an amicable, though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of Armenia; and a territorial acquisition, which Augustus might have despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of the younger Theodosius.</P>
