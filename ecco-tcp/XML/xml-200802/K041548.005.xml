<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems to be a kind of duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to Poetry, to raise, if possible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Composition, and the character of modern Times will allow: The ages, in∣deed, are past, in which the song of the Poet was idoli∣zed for its <HI>miraculous effects;</HI> yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may still perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of some little ser∣vice to society in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober Reason, it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delu∣sions, in which a poetical Enthusiast may be safely indulged.</P>
<P>The following production owes its existence to an in∣cident in real life, very similar to the principal action of
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
the last Canto; but in forming the general plan of the work, it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwith∣standing the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of Pope. I considered his Cave of Spleen as a most exquisite ca∣binet picture; and, to avoid the servility of imitation, I determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvass: Happy, indeed, if the judg∣ment of the Public may enable me to exclaim, with the honest vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael,
<Q>"E son Pittore anch' Io!"</Q></P>
<P>The celebrated Alessandro Tassoni, who is generally considered as the inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition, that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS. copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an inscription, in which he stiled it a new species of Poetry, invented by himself.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6"/>
A few partial friends have asserted, that the present performance has some degree of similar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it possesses, may rather require an apology, than entitle its Author to challenge commen∣dation, I shall explain how far the conduct of the Po∣em differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing, and slightly mention the poetical effects, which such a variation appeared likely to produce.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the favourite Poems, which blend the serious and the comic, represent their principal characters in a satirical point of view: It was the in∣tention of Tassoni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to satirize a particular Italian Noble∣man, who happened to be the object of his resentment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Ecclesiastics in his Lutrin; Garth, our English Physicians, in his Dis∣pensary; and the Rape of the Lock itself, that most ex∣cellent and enchanting Poem, which I never contem∣plate but with new idolatry, is denominated <HI>the best Satire extant,</HI> by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very clegant and ingenious, but severe Essay on Pope: A sentence which seems to be confirmed by the Poet himself, in his letter to Mrs. Fermor, where he says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the cha∣racter
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
of Belinda, as it is now managed, resembles you in nothing but in beauty."</Q> Though I think, that no composition can surpass, or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of Genius, as a sportive Satire, I ima∣gined it might be possible to give a new Character to this mixed species of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the most beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have seen it carried to inimitable perfection, in the most delicate raillery on Female Foibles:—It remained to be tried, if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence. The idea appeared to me worth the experiment; for, if it succeeded, it seemed to promise a double advantage; first, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, secondly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more interesting to the heart. On these principles, I have endeavoured to paint <HI>SERENA</HI> as a most lovely, en∣gaging, and accomplished character; yet I hope the co∣louring is so faithfully copied from <HI>general Nature,</HI> that every man, who reads the Poem, may be happy enough to know many Fair ones, who resemble my Heroine.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
There is another point, in which I have also at∣tempted to give this Poem an air of novelty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes, which compose it; by shifting these in alternate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allego∣rical Picture afford a strong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an appear∣ance particularly diversified. I wished, indeed (but I fear most ineffectually) for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of Ariosto, and the more seri∣ous sublime painting of Dante, with some portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagination, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if possible, with∣out violating those rules of propriety, which Mr. Cam∣bridge has illustrated, by example as well as precept, in The Scribleriad, and in his sensible Preface to that ele∣gant and learned Poem.</P>
<P>I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the <HI>extent,</HI> or rather of the <HI>extravagance</HI> of my desire; for I will not give it the serious name of <HI>design:</HI> They, whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sen∣sible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea, will not only be the first to discern, but the most
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
ready to pardon those errors, into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public, by a Dissertation of considerable length on this species of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks, as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce, from the reflection, that, however ingeniously written, they add little or nothing to the success of a good Poem, and are utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</P>
<P>In dismissing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their perusal, I shall only re∣commend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the pleasant and courteous Tassoni— <Q><L>"Vaglia il buon voler, s' altro non lice,</L>
<L>"E chi la leggera, viva felice!"</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Mind's soft Guardian, who, tho' yet unsung,</L>
<L>Inspires with harmony the Female tongue,</L>
<L>And gives, improving every tender grace,</L>
<L>The smile of angels to a mortal face;</L>
<L N="5">Her powers I sing; and scenes of mental strife,</L>
<L>Which form the maiden for th' accomplish'd wife;</L>
<L>Where the sweet victor sees, with sparkling eyes,</L>
<L>Love her reward, and Happiness her prize.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Daughters of Beauty, who the song inspire,</L>
<L N="10">To your enchanting notes attune my lyre!</L>
<L>And O! if haply your soft hearts may gain</L>
<L>Or use, or pleasure from the motley strain,</L>
<L>Tho' formal critics, with a surly frown,</L>
<L>Deny your artless Bard the laurel crown,</L>
<L N="15">He still shall triumph, if ye deign to spread</L>
<L>Your sweeter myrtle round his honour'd head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In your bright circle young SERENA grew;</L>
<L>A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew;</L>
<L>For the fond Graces form'd her easy mien,</L>
<L N="20">And Heaven's soft azure in her eye was seen.</L>
<L>She seem'd a rose-bud, when it first receives</L>
<L>The genial sun in its expanding leaves:</L>
<L>For now she enter'd those important years,</L>
<L>When the full bosom swells with hopes and fears;</L>
<L>When conscious Nature prompts the secret sigh,</L>
<L N="26">And sheds sweet languor o'er the melting eye;</L>
<L>When nobler toys the female heart trepan,</L>
<L>And Dolls rejected, yield their place to Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath a Father's care SERENA grew;</L>
<L N="30">The good SIR GILBERT, to his country true,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
A faithful Whig, who, zealous for the state,</L>
<L>In Freedom's service led the loud debate;</L>
<L>Yet every day, by transmutation rare,</L>
<L>Turn'd to a Tory in his elbow-chair,</L>
<L N="35">And made his daughter pay, howe'er absurd,</L>
<L>Passive obedience to his sovereign word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In his domestic sway he borrow'd aid</L>
<L>From prim PENELOPE, an ancient maid,</L>
<L>His upright Sister, conscious of her worth,</L>
<L N="40">Who valued still her beauty, and her birth;</L>
<L>Tho' from her birth no envied rank she gain'd,</L>
<L>And of her beauty but the ghost remain'd;</L>
<L>A restless ghost! that with remembrance keen</L>
<L>Proclaim'd incessant what it once had been;</L>
<L N="45">Delighted still the steps of youth to haunt,</L>
<L>To watch the tender nymph, and warm gallant;</L>
<L>And, with an eye that petrified pursuit,</L>
<L>Hang like the dragon o'er th' Hesperian fruit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' strictly guarded by this jealous power,</L>
<L N="50">The mild SERENA no restraint could sour:</L>
<L>Pure was her bosom, as the silver lake,</L>
<L>Ere rising winds the ruffled water shake,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
When the bright pageants of the morning sky,</L>
<L>Across th' expansive mirror lightly fly,</L>
<L N="55">By vernal gales in quick succession driven,</L>
<L>While the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven.</L>
<L>In gay content a sportive life she led,</L>
<L>The child of Modesty, by Virtue bred:</L>
<L>Her light companions Innocence and Ease:</L>
<L N="60">Her hope was Pleasure, and her wish to please:</L>
<L>For this to Fashion early rites she paid:</L>
<L>For this to Venus secret vows she made;</L>
<L>Nor held it sin to cast a private glance</L>
<L>O'er the dear pages of a new romance,</L>
<L N="65">Eager in Fiction's touching scenes to find</L>
<L>A field, to exercise her youthful mind:</L>
<L>The touching scenes new energy imprest</L>
<L>On all the virtues of her feeling breast.</L>
<L>Sweet Evelina's fascinating power</L>
<L N="70">Had first beguil'd of sleep her midnight hour:</L>
<L>Possest by Sympathy's enchanting sway,</L>
<L>She read, unconscious of the dawning day.</L>
<L>The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd</L>
<L>Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid.</L>
<L N="75"><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
The nymph, attentive as the brooding dove,</L>
<L>Pored o'er the tender scenes of Franzel's love:</L>
<L>The sinking taper now grew weak and pale;</L>
<L>SERENA sigh'd, and dropt th' unfinish'd tale;</L>
<L>But, as warm clouds in vernal aether roll,</L>
<L N="80">The soft ideas floated in her soul:</L>
<L>Free from ambitious pride, and envious care,</L>
<L>To love, and to be lov'd, was all her prayer:</L>
<L>While these fond thoughts her gentle mind possess'd,</L>
<L>Soft slumber settled on her snowy breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="85">Scarce had her radiant eyes began to close,</L>
<L>When to her view a friendly vision rose:</L>
<L>A fairy Phantom struck her mental sight,</L>
<L>Light as the gossamer, as aether bright;</L>
<L>Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form,</L>
<L N="90">When the sage Goddess stills the martial storm.</L>
<L>Her casque was amber, richly grac'd above</L>
<L>With down, collected from the callow dove:</L>
<L>Her burnish'd breast-plate, of a deeper dye,</L>
<L>Was once the armour of a golden fly:</L>
<L N="95">A lynx's eye her little aegis shone,</L>
<L>By fairy spells converted into stone,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
And worn of old, as elfin poets sing,</L>
<L>By Aegypt's lovely queen, a favourite ring:</L>
<L>Mysterious power was in the magic toy,</L>
<L N="100">To turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy.</L>
<L>Her tiny lance, whose radiance stream'd afar,</L>
<L>Was one bright sparkle from the bridal star.</L>
<L>A filmy mantle round her figure play'd,</L>
<L>Fine as the texture, by Arachne laid</L>
<L>O'er some young plant, when glittering to the view</L>
<L N="106">With many an orient pearl of morning dew.</L>
<L>The Phantom hover'd o'er the conscious Fair</L>
<L>With such a lively smile of tender care,</L>
<L>As on her elfin lord Titania cast,</L>
<L N="110">When first she found his angry spell was past.</L>
<L>Round her rich locks SERENA chanc'd to tie</L>
<L>An ample ribband of caerulean dye:</L>
<L>High o'er her forehead rose the graceful bow,</L>
<L>Whose arch commanded the sweet scene below:</L>
<L N="115">The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting spot,</L>
<L>And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot;</L>
<L>As the fair flutterer, of Psyche's race,</L>
<L>Is seen to terminate her airy chace,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
When, pleas'd at length her quivering wings to close,</L>
<L N="120">Fondly she settles on the fragrant rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in soft notes, more musically clear</L>
<L>Than ever Fairy breath'd in mortal ear,</L>
<L>These words the visionary voice convey'd</L>
<L>To the charm'd spirit of the sleeping maid:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thou darling of my care, whose ripen'd worth</L>
<L N="126">Shall spread my empire o'er the smiling earth;</L>
<L>Whom Nature blest, forbidding modish Art</L>
<L>To cramp thy spirit, or contract thy heart;</L>
<L>Screen'd from thy thought, nor in thy visions felt,</L>
<L N="130">Long on thy opening mind I've fondly dwelt;</L>
<L>In childhood's sorrows brought thee quick relief,</L>
<L>And dry'd thy April showers of infant grief;</L>
<L>Taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy,</L>
<L>Who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy,</L>
<L N="135">To bear what ills the little Female haunt,</L>
<L>The testy Nurse, the imperious Governante,</L>
<L>And that tyrannic pest, the prying maiden Aunt.</L>
<L>Now ripening years a nobler scene supply;</L>
<L>For life now opens on thy sparkling eye:</L>
<L N="140">Thy rising bosom swells with just desire</L>
<L>Rapture to feel, and rapture to inspire:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Not the vain bliss, the transitory joys,</L>
<L>That childish Woman feels, in radiant toys;</L>
<L>The costly Diamond, or the lighter Pearl,</L>
<L N="145">The massive Nabob, or the tinsel Earl.</L>
<L>Thy heart demands, each meaner aim above,</L>
<L>Th' imperishable wealth of sterling love;</L>
<L>Thy wish, to please by ev'ry softer grace</L>
<L>Of elegance and ease, of form and face!</L>
<L N="150">By lively fancy and by sense refin'd,</L>
<L>The stronger magic of the cultur'd mind!</L>
<L>Thy pure ambition, and thy virtuous plan,</L>
<L>To fix the variable heart of Man!</L>
<L>Short is the worship paid at Beauty's shrine;</L>
<L N="155">But lasting Love and Happiness are mine:</L>
<L>Mine, tho' the earth's mistaken, blinded race</L>
<L>Despise my influence, and my name debase;</L>
<L>Nor breathe one vow to that aetherial friend,</L>
<L>On whom the colours of their life depend.</L>
<L N="160">But to thy innocence I'll now display</L>
<L>The mystic marvels of my secret sway;</L>
<L>And tell, in this thy fate-deciding hour,</L>
<L>My race, my name, my office, and my power.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
<L>First, hear what wonders human forms contain!</L>
<L N="165">And learn the texture of the Female brain!</L>
<L>By Nature's care in curious order spread,</L>
<L>This living net is fram'd of tender thread;</L>
<L>Fine, as thy hand, some favour'd youth to grace,</L>
<L>Knits with nice art to form the mimic lace.</L>
<L N="170">Within the center of this fretted dome,</L>
<L>Her secret tower, her heaven-constructed home,</L>
<L>Soft Sensibility, sweet Beauty's soul!</L>
<L>Keeps her coy state, and animates the whole,</L>
<L>Invisible as Harmony, who springs,</L>
<L>Wak'd by young Zephyr, from Aeolian strings:</L>
<L N="176">Her subtle power, more delicately fine,</L>
<L>Dwells in each thread, and lives in every line,</L>
<L>Whose quick vibrations, without end, impart</L>
<L>Pleasure and pain to the responsive heart.</L>
<L N="180">As Zephyr's breath the willing chord inspires,</L>
<L>Whispering soft music to the trembling wires,</L>
<L>So with fond care I regulate, unseen,</L>
<L>The softer movements of this nice machine;</L>
<L>TEMPER my earthly name, the nurse of Love!</L>
<L N="185">But call'd SOPHROSYNE in realms above!</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
When lovely Woman, perfect at her birth,</L>
<L>Blest with her early charms the wond'ring earth,</L>
<L>Her soul, in sweet simplicity array'd,</L>
<L>Nor shar'd my guidance, nor requir'd my aid.</L>
<L N="190">Her tender frame, nor confident nor coy,</L>
<L>Had every fibre tun'd to gentle joy:</L>
<L>No vain caprices swell'd her pouting lip;</L>
<L>No gold produc'd a mercenary trip;</L>
<L>Soft innocence inspir'd her willing kiss,</L>
<L N="195">Her love was nature, and her life was bliss.</L>
<L>Guide of his reason, not his passion's prey,</L>
<L>She tamed the savage, Man, who bless'd her sway.</L>
<L>No jarring wishes fill'd the world with woes,</L>
<L>But youth was ecstacy, and age repose.</L>

<L>The Powers of Mischief met, in dark Divan,</L>
<L N="201">To blast these mighty joys of envied Man:</L>

While the terrific master of the spell</L>
<L>With adjurations shook the depths of hell,</L>
<L N="210">And in dark words, unmeet for mortal ear,</L>
<L>Bade the dire offspring of his art appear.</L>
<L>Forth from the vase, with sullen murmurs, broke</L>
<L>A towering mass of pestilential smoke:</L>
<L>Emerging from this fog of thickest night,</L>
<L N="215">A Phantom swells, by slow degrees, to sight;</L>
<L>But ere the view can seize the forming shape,</L>
<L>From the mock'd eye its lineaments escape:</L>
<L>It seem'd all passions melted into one,</L>
<L>Assum'd the face of all, and yet was none:</L>
<L N="220">Hell stood aghast at its portentous mien,</L>
<L>And shuddering Demons call'd the spectre Spleen.</L>
<L>Hie thee to earth! its mighty master cried,</L>
<L>O'er the vex'd globe in heavy vapours ride!</L>
<L>Within its center fix thy shadowy throne!</L>
<L>With shades thy subjects, and that hell thy own!</L>
<L N="226">Reign there unseen! but let thy strong controul</L>
<L>Be hourly felt in Woman's wayward soul!</L>
<L>With darkest poisons from our deep abyss,</L>
<L>Taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss!</L>
<L N="230"><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Th' enormous Phantom, at this potent sound,</L>
<L>Roll'd forth obedient from the vast profound:</L>
<L>The quaking Fiends recover'd from their dread,</L>
<L>And Hell grew lighter, as the monster fled.</L>
<L>But now round earth the gliding vapours run,</L>
<L N="235">Blot the rich aether, and eclipse the sun;</L>
<L>All Nature sickens; and her fairest flower,</L>
<L>Enchanting Woman, feels the baneful power:</L>
<L>As in her soul the clouds of Spleen arise,</L>
<L>The sprightly essence of her beauty flies:</L>
<L>In youth's gay prime, in hours with rapture warm,</L>
<L N="241">Love looks astonish'd on her altering form:</L>
<L>To pleasing frolics, and enchanting wiles,</L>
<L>Life-darting looks, and soul-subduing smiles,</L>
<L>Dark whims succeed: thick-coming fancies fret;</L>
<L N="245">The sullen passion, and the hasty pet;</L>
<L>The swelling lip, the tear-distended eye,</L>
<L>The peevish question, the perverse reply;</L>
<L>The moody humour, that, like rain and fire,</L>
<L>Blends cold disgust with unsubdu'd desire,</L>
<L N="250">Flies what it loves, and, petulantly coy,</L>
<L>Feigns proud abhorrence of the proffer'd joy:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
For Nature's artless aim, the wish to please</L>
<L>By genuine modesty and simple ease,</L>
<L>Fashion's pert tricks the crowded brain oppress</L>
<L N="255">With all the poor parade of tawdry dress:</L>
<L>The sickly bosom pants for noise and shew,</L>
<L>For every bauble, and for every beau;</L>
<L>The voice, that Health made harmony, disowns</L>
<L>That native charm for Languor's mimic tones;</L>
<L N="260">And feigns disease, till, feeling what it feigns,</L>
<L>Its fancied maladies are real pains.</L>
<L>Such, and a thousand still superior woes,</L>
<L>From Spleen's new empire o'er the earth arose:</L>
<L>Each simple dictate of the soul forgot,</L>
<L N="265">Then first was form'd the mercenary plot;</L>
<L>And-Beauty practis'd that pernicious art,</L>
<L>The art of angling for an old man's heart;</L>
<L>Tho' crawling to his bride with tottering knees,</L>
<L>His words were dotage, and his love disease.</L>
<L N="270">From sex to sex this base contagion ran,</L>

<L>Courtship was traffic: and the married life</L>

<L>From Cynthia call'd me to his kindred orb;</L>
<L N="280">And, eager to redress the woes of Man,</L>

<L>So spake that friend of Man, who lights above</L>
<L>His heavenly lamp of Hymenaeal love:</L>
<L>In his just aim my kindred spirit join'd,</L>
<L N="305">And flew obedient to the charge assign'd.</L>
<L>Hence, as the biass sways the unconscious bowl,</L>
<L>I long unseen have sway'd the careless soul;</L>
<L>Tho' oft I feel my power by Spleen subdu'd,</L>
<L>In the shrill Vixen, and the sullen Prude,</L>
<L N="310">In some fair forms my soft dominion grows,</L>
<L>Like fragance, rising from the opening rose:</L>
<L>Still I preserve, in many a lovely face,</L>
<L>That gay good-humour, and that constant grace,</L>
<L>Which heavenly Powers united to infold</L>
<L N="315">In perfect Woman's new-created mould;</L>
<L>When Nature, in her infant beauty blest,</L>

But of those Nymphs, who, delicately fair,</L>
<L>Draw their soft graces from my forming care,</L>
<L N="320">My young SERENA shines her peers above,</L>
<L>Pride of my hopes, and darling of my love.</L>
<L>Hence I to thee such mysteries unfold,</L>
<L>As Man's pedantic eye shall ne'er behold;</L>
<L>Whose narrow science, tho' it proudly boast</L>
<L N="325">To pierce the sky, and count the starry host,</L>

<L>Who flutter round him in his secret hours:</L>
<L>But if to me, thy guardian now display'd,</L>
<L>Thy duteous orisons are justly paid,</L>
<L>Thou to those realms shalt pass, with me thy guide,</L>

<L>'Tis my fond purpose in thy form to shew</L>

With whom thy innocence, secure from strife,</L>

<L>Pleas'd I observe thy little heart begin</L>

<L>But know, tho' Elegance herself be seen</L>

<L>Tho' Beauty o'er thy filial cheek diffuse</L>
<L>The soft enchantment of her roseate hues,</L>

<L>What hard conditions are annex'd by Fate:</L>

<L N="365">Which Fate allows not even me to know:</L>

<L>Perchance three prime supporters of her sway,</L>

<L>Her base suggestion, and her envious hint:—</L>

<L>Of amorous Vanity, and angry Scorn,</L>

<L>With this, my Caestus, thy soft bosom arm;</L>

<L>To hide the mystic band from mortal eyes!</L>
<L>When Spleen's dark Powers would teach that breast to swell,</L>
<L N="400">This guardian Cincture shall those Powers repel:</L>
<L>As the touch'd talisman, more swift than thought,</L>

<L>YE radiant Nymphs! whose opening eyes convey</L>
<L>Warmth to the world, and lustre to the day!</L>
<L>Think what o'ershadowing clouds may cross your brain,</L>
<L>Before those lovely lids shall close again!</L>
<L>What funds of Patience twelve long hours may ask,</L>
<L N="6">When cold Discretion claims her daily task!</L>
<L>Ah think betimes! and, while your morning care</L>
<L>Sheds foreign odors o'er your fragrant hair,</L>
<L>Tinge your soft spirit with that mental sweet,</L>
<L N="10">Which may not be exhal'd by Passion's heat;</L>
<L>But charm the sense, with undecaying power,</L>
<L>Thro' every chance of each diurnal hour!</L>
<L>O! might you all perceive your toilets crown'd</L>
<L>With such cosmetics as SERENA found!</L>
<L N="15">For, to the warning Vision fondly true,</L>
<L>Now the quick Fair-one to the toilet flew:</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
With keen delight her ravish'd eye survey'd</L>
<L>The mystic ribband on her mirror laid:</L>
<L>Bright shone the azure, as Aurora's car,</L>
<L N="20">And every spangle seem'd a living star.</L>
<L>With sportive grace the smiling damsel prest</L>
<L>The guardian Cincture to her snowy breast,</L>
<L>More lovely far than Juno, when she strove</L>
<L>To look most lovely in the eyes of Jove;</L>
<L N="25">And willing Venus lent her every power,</L>
<L>That sheds enchantment o'er the amorous hour:</L>
<L>For spells more potent on this band were thrown,</L>
<L>Than Venus boasted in her beauteous zone.</L>
<L>Her dazzling Caestus could alone inspire</L>
<L N="30">The sudden impulse of short-liv'd desire:</L>
<L>These finer threads with lasting charms are fraught,</L>
<L>Here lies the tender, but unchanging thought,</L>
<L>Silence, that wins, where eloquence is vain,</L>
<L>And Tones, that harmonize the mad'ning brain,</L>
<L N="35">Soft Sighs, that Anger cannot hear, and live,</L>
<L>And Smiles, that tell, how truly they forgive;</L>
<L>And lively Grace, whose gay diffusive light</L>
<L>Puts the black phantoms of the brain to flight,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Whose cheering powers thro' every period last,</L>
<L N="40">And make the present happy as the past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such secret charms this richer Zone possest,</L>
<L>Whose flowers, now sparkling on SERENA's breast,</L>
<L>Give, tho' unseen those swelling orbs they bind,</L>
<L>Smiles to her face, and beauty to her mind:</L>
<L N="45">For now, observant of the Sprite's behest,</L>
<L>The Nymph conceals them by her upper vest:</L>
<L>Safe lies the spell, no mortal may descry,</L>
<L>Not keen PENELOPE's all-piercing eye;</L>
<L>Who constant, as the steps of morn advance,</L>
<L N="50">Surveys the houshold with a searching glance,</L>
<L>And entering now, with all her usual care,</L>
<L>Reviews the chamber of the youthful Fair.</L>
<L>Beneath the pillow, not compleatly hid,</L>
<L>The Novel lay—She saw—she seiz'd—she chid:</L>
<L N="55">With rage and glee her glaring eye-balls flash,</L>
<L>Ah wicked age! she cries, ah filthy trash!</L>
<L>From the first page my just abhorrence springs;</L>
<L>For modern anecdotes are monstrous things:</L>
<L>Yet will I see what dangerous poisons lurk,</L>
<L N="60">To taint thy youth, in this licentious work.</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="34"/>
She said: and rudely from the chamber rush'd,</L>
<L>Her pallid cheek with expectation flush'd,</L>
<L>With ardent hope her eager spirit shook,</L>
<L>Vain hope! to banquet on a luscious book.</L>
<L N="65">So if a Priest, of the Arabian sect,</L>
<L>In Turkish hands forbidden wine detect,</L>
<L>The sacred Mussulman, with pious din,</L>
<L>Arraigns the culprit, and proclaims the sin,</L>
<L>Curses with holy zeal th' inflaming juice,</L>
<L N="70">But cursing takes it for his secret use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The gay SERENA, with unruffled mind,</L>
<L>The pleasing Novel, thus unread, resign'd.</L>
<L>The Vision on her soul such virtue left,</L>
<L>She only smil'd at the provoking theft;</L>
<L N="75">The teazing incident she deem'd a jest,</L>
<L>Nor felt the Zone grow tighter on her breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in full charms descends the finish'd Fair,</L>
<L>For now the morning banquet claims her care;</L>
<L>Already at the board, with viands pil'd,</L>
<L>Her Sire impatient sits, and chides his tardy child.</L>
<L N="81">On his imperial lips rude Hunger reigns,</L>
<L>And keener Politics usurp his brains:</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
But when her love-inspiring voice he hears,</L>
<L>When the soft magic of her smile appears,</L>
<L N="85">In that glad moment he at once forgets</L>
<L>His empty stomach, and the nation's debts:</L>
<L>He bends to Nature's more divine controul,</L>
<L>And only feels the Father in his soul.</L>
<L>Quick to his hand behold her now present</L>
<L N="90">The Indian liquor of celestial scent!</L>
<L>Not with more grace the nectar'd cup is given</L>
<L>By rose-lip'd Hebe to the Lord of Heaven.</L>
<L>While her fair hands a fresh libation pour,</L>
<L>Fashion's loud thunder wakes the sounding door.</L>
<L N="95">The light SERENA to the window springs,</L>
<L>On Curiosity's amusive wings:</L>
<L>Her quick eyes sparkle with surprise, to see</L>
<L>The glories of a golden vis-à-vis:</L>
<L>Its glittering tablet gleam'd with mimic pearl,</L>
<L N="100">And the rich coronet announc'd an Earl.</L>
<L>The good old Knight grew somewhat proud to hear</L>
<L>Of this new visit from the early Peer:</L>
<L>SERENA recollects the Vision's truth,</L>
<L>And fluttering, hopes it is the promis'd Youth:</L>
<L N="105"><PB N="34" REF="36"/>
PENELOPE from her high chamber peeps;</L>
<L>There her unfinish'd charms she coyly keeps;</L>
<L>With sage reserve her modesty abhorr'd</L>
<L>To shew her morning face before a Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Peer alights: the well-rang'd vassals bawl</L>
<L N="110">His sounding title thro' the spacious hall,</L>
<L>Till in the deep saloon's extremest bound</L>
<L>Th' ear-tickling words, "LORD FILLIGREE," re∣sound!</L>
<L>As when great Hector, setting war apart,</L>
<L>Advanc'd to parley, with his spear athwart,</L>
<L N="115">The Greeks beheld him with a still delight;</L>
<L>And silent reverence stopt the rising fight;</L>
<L>With such respect, but unchastis'd by fear,</L>
<L>Sir GILBERT and the Nymph first meet the Peer;</L>
<L>And, while his morning compliments commence,</L>
<L N="120">The slighted breakfast stands in cold suspence.</L>
<L>But far unlike to Hector's ruder grace</L>
<L>His modern stature, and his modish face!</L>
<L>Nor less he differs from those Barons old,</L>
<L>Whose arms are blazon'd on his car of gold;</L>
<L N="125">Whose prostrate castle guarded once the lands,</L>
<L>Where, spruce in motley pride, his villa stands,</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
By Taste erected, in her trimmest mode,</L>
<L>Her mushroom structure, and her quaint abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the neat Daisy to the Sun's broad flower,</L>
<L N="130">As the French Boudoir to the Gothic Tower,</L>
<L>Such is the Peer, whom Fashion much admires,</L>
<L>Compar'd in person to his ancient sires:</L>
<L>For their broad shoulder, and their brawny calf,</L>
<L>Their coarse, loud language, and their coarser laugh,</L>
<L N="135">His finer form, more elegantly slim,</L>
<L>Displays the fasionable length of limb:</L>
<L>With foreign shrugs his country he regards,</L>
<L>And her lean tongue with foreign words he lards;</L>
<L>While Gallic Graces, who correct his style,</L>
<L N="140">Forbid his mirth to pass beyond a smile.</L>
<L>As the nice workman in the wooden trade,</L>
<L>Hides his coarse ground, with finest woods o'erlaid,</L>
<L>Thus our young Lord, with Fashion's phrase refin'd,</L>
<L>Fineer'd the mean interior of his mind:</L>
<L N="145">And hence, in Courtesy's soft lustre seen,</L>
<L>His spirit shone, as graceful as his mien.</L>
<L>The artless Fair, on Fashion's kind report,</L>
<L>Thought him the mirror of a matchless Court:</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Much she his dress, his language much observes,</L>
<L N="150">Whose finer accents prove his feeling nerves.</L>
<L>Her fancy now the destin'd Lover spies,</L>
<L>But her free heart abjures the quick surmise;</L>
<L>Yet as he spoke, at every flattering word</L>
<L>The Vision's promise to her thought recurr'd.</L>
<L N="155">Far more parental pride contrives to blind</L>
<L>The good Sir GILBERT's more-experienc'd mind,</L>
<L>Who fondly saw, and at the prospect smil'd,</L>
<L>A future Countess in his favourite child.</L>
<L>But what new flutterings shook SERENA's breast,</L>
<L N="160">What hopes and fears the modest Nymph op∣prest,</L>
<L>When with a simpering smile, and soft regard,</L>
<L>The Peer display'd a mirth-expressive card,</L>
<L>Where the gay Graces, in a sportive band,</L>
<L>Shew the sweet art of Cipriani's hand;</L>
<L N="165">Where, in their train, his airy Cupids throng,</L>
<L>And laughing drag a comic mask along!</L>
<L>"We," cries my Lord, with self-sufficient joy,</L>

"We, who possess true science, we, who give</L>
<L N="170">The world a lesson in the art to live,</L>
<L>We for the the Fair a splendid Fête design,</L>
<L>And pay our homage thus at Beauty's shrine."</L>
<L>He spoke; and speaking, to the blushing Maid,</L>
<L>With modish ease, th' inviting card convey'd,</L>
<L>Where Mirth announc'd her masque-devoted hour</L>
<L N="176">In characters intwin'd with many a flower:</L>
<L>The blushing Maid, with eyes of quick desire,</L>
<L>View'd it, and felt her little soul on fire;</L>
<L>For of all scenes she had not yet survey'd,</L>
<L N="180">Her heart most panted for a Masquerade:</L>
<L>But her gay hopes increasing terrors drown,</L>
<L>And dread forebodings of her Father's frown.</L>
<L>In mute suspence to read his thought she tries,</L>
<L>And strongly pleads with her prevailing eyes,</L>
<L>Her eyes, for doubt enchain'd her modest tongue,</L>
<L N="186">While on his sovereign word her pleasure hung.</L>
<L>With such a tender, and persuasive air</L>
<L>Of soft endearment, and of anxious care,</L>
<L>Thetis attended from th' almighty Sire</L>
<L N="190">His fateful answer to her fond desire:</L>

The good old Knight, like the Olympian God,</L>

<L>Her lively spirit the kind signal took,</L>
<L>And her glad heart, in every fibre, shook.</L>
<L N="195">The party settled, it imports not how,</L>
<L>The Peer politely made his parting bow:</L>
<L>The Nymph, with eyes that sparkled joyous fire,</L>
<L>Kiss'd the round cheek of her complying Sire,</L>
<L>Then swiftly flew, and summon'd to her aid</L>
<L N="200">Th' important counsel of her favourite maid,</L>
<L>To vent her joy, and, as the moments press,</L>
<L>To fix that first of points, a Fancy-dress.</L>

<L>Quick as the Poet's eyes o'er Nature fly,</L>

<L>Now in Diana's form she hopes to meet</L>

Thus the departing Fury left behind</L>
<L>Her venom, latent in Sir GILBERT's mind.</L>
<L>The hidden mischief tho' no eye observes,</L>
<L>He feels it fretting on his alter'd nerves;</L>
<L N="295">But the kind habit of his healthy soul</L>
<L>Still struggled hard against its base controul.</L>
<L>Now Spleen's dark vapours, in his bosom hid,</L>
<L>Prompt him the promis'd pleasure to forbid;</L>
<L>Now Love's soft pleadings that dire thought destroy,</L>
<L N="300">And save the blossom of his daughter's joy;</L>
<L>Her envious Aunt now serves him for a jest,</L>
<L>And gay good-humour reassumes his breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While Spleen's dark power now sinks and now revives,</L>
<L>At length the day, th' important day, arrives,</L>
<L N="305">Which in his breast must end the close debate,</L>
<L>And fix the colour of SERENA's fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now comes the hour, when the convivial Knight</L>
<L>Waits to begin the dinner's chearful rite:</L>
<L>His fond heart ever, with a Father's pride,</L>
<L N="310">Joys to behold his darling at his side;</L>
<L>But most the absence of her smile he feels</L>
<L>In the gay season of his social meals:</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="47"/>
Hence, while for her the rich repast attends,</L>
<L>His hasty summons to the Nymph he sends:</L>
<L N="315">The happy Nymph superior cares induce</L>
<L>To risk his anger by a rash excuse:</L>
<L>She craves his pardon; but, for time distrest,</L>
<L>She still is busy on her magic vest;</L>
<L>To range her diamonds in a sparkling zone,</L>
<L N="320">She begs to snatch her scanty meal alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Knight in sullen state begins to dine:</L>
<L>Spleen, like a Harpy, flutters o'er his wine:</L>
<L>Invisible she poisons every dish,</L>
<L>Tinging with gall his mutton, fowl, and fish.</L>
<L N="325">The more he eats, the more perverse he grows;</L>
<L>For as his hunger sunk, his choler rose.</L>
<L>The cloth remov'd, he cries, with vapours sick,</L>
<L>The Pears are mellow, and the Port is thick;</L>
<L>Tho' nicer fruit Pomona never knew,</L>
<L N="330">And his rich wine surpass'd the ruby's hue!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A thousand times his dizzy brain revolves</L>
<L>A stern command: now doubts, and now resolves</L>
<L>To bid the Nymph descend, and, disarray'd,</L>
<L>Quit her dear project of the Masquerade:</L>
<L N="335"><PB N="45" REF="48"/>
As oft kind Nature to his heart recurr'd,</L>
<L>And Love parental stopt the cruel word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean time, unconscious of the brooding storm,</L>
<L>The Nymph exults in her improving form:</L>
<L>Gay is her smile, as those the Queen of Love</L>
<L N="340">Darts on the Graces in her court above,</L>
<L>While they contrive, with love-inspiring cares,</L>
<L>New modes of beauty for the robe she wears.</L>
<L>At length, each duty of the toilet past,</L>
<L>The glance of triumph on the mirror cast,</L>
<L N="345">Now the light wand our finish'd Ariel arms;</L>
<L>Glad Jenny glories in her Lady's charms;</L>
<L>And gives full utterance, as she smooths her vest,</L>
<L>To the sweet bodings of SERENA's breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! lovely biass of the Female soul!</L>
<L>Which trembling points to Pleasure's distant pole;</L>
<L>Which with fond trust on flattering Hope relies,</L>
<L>O'erleaps each peril, that in prospect lies,</L>
<L>And springing to the goal, anticipates the prize!</L>
<L>Such was SERENA's fear-discarding state;</L>
<L N="355">Her eye beheld not the dark frowns of Fate:</L>
<L>She only saw, the combat all forgot,</L>
<L>The triumph promis'd as her glorious lot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
<L>Now, eager to display her light attire,</L>
<L>The sprightly Damsel seeks her sullen Sire;</L>
<L N="360">His gloomy brow with sportive air she kist:</L>
<L>Ah! how could Spleen that magic lip resist?</L>
<L>That voice, whose melting music might assuage</L>
<L>The scorpion Anger's self-tormenting rage?</L>
<L>For ne'er did Nature to a Sire's embrace</L>
<L N="365">Present a filial form of softer grace;</L>
<L>Or Fancy view a shape of lovelier kind</L>
<L>In the bright mirror of her Shakespeare's mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sulky Fiend, in spite of all her art,</L>
<L>Had now been banish'd from the Father's heart,</L>
<L N="370">But that, resolv'd her utmost force to try,</L>
<L>She summon'd to her aid her old ally,</L>
<L>The fiery Demon, temper-troubling Gout,</L>
<L>Who sinks the lively, and appalls the stout;</L>
<L>Who now, assisting Spleen's malignant aim,</L>
<L N="375">Shoots in quick throbbings through Sir GILBERT's frame.</L>
<L>Thus sorely pester'd by a double foe,</L>
<L>Galling his giddy brain, and burning toe,</L>
<L>The testy Knight, with stern and sullen air,</L>
<L>Denounc'd his humour to the shudd'ring Fair:</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="50"/>
"Go change your dress! give up this vain delight!</L>
<L N="381">"I will not hear of Masquerades to-night:</L>
<L>"Your Chaperone's inform'd, she need not wait,</L>
<L>"So change your dress! and sit with me sedate."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the proud dame, whose avaricious glee</L>
<L N="385">Built golden castles in the rich South Sea,</L>
<L>Gaz'd on her Broker, when he told her first</L>
<L>Her wealth was vanish'd, and the bubble burst:</L>
<L>So gaz'd the Nymph, hearing her Sire destroy</L>
<L>Her airy palace of ideal joy.</L>
<L>First her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline,</L>
<L N="391">And deem the harsh command no fix'd design,</L>
<L>But the quick sally of a peevish word,</L>
<L>That Love revokes, the moment it is heard:</L>
<L>Or haply mirth, in mimic wrath exprest,</L>
<L N="395">A feign'd forbiddance utter'd but in jest:</L>
<L>To this short hope her sinking spirit clung,</L>
<L>To see his softening eyes refute his tongue.</L>
<L>Ah fruitless hope! for there she cannot find</L>
<L>The well-known signals of the friendly mind.</L>
<L N="400">Stern Contradiction, with the frown of Fate,</L>
<L>On his dark visage reign'd in sullen state;</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="51"/>
Felt in each feature, in each accent shewn,</L>
<L>Lower'd in his look, and thunder'd in his tone.</L>
<L>Hence the warm bosom of the lively Fair</L>
<L N="405">Now shivers with the chill of blank despair:</L>
<L>Now Disappointment's thick'ning shadows roll</L>
<L>A cloud of horror o'er the darken'd soul;</L>
<L>And Fancy, in a sick delirium tost,</L>
<L>Gives double value to each pleasure lost.</L>
<L N="410">The blasted joys, she labours to forget,</L>
<L>Rush on her mind, and waken keen regret:</L>
<L>Her cheek turns pale—the tear prepares to start,</L>
<L>And palpitation heaves her swelling heart.</L>
<L>But here, SOPHROSYNE! thy guardian aid</L>
<L N="415">Saves from her potent foe the sinking Maid.</L>
<L>Her bosom, into strong emotions thrown,</L>
<L>Now feels the pressure of thy friendly Zone.</L>
<L>Swift thy kind cautions to her soul recur,</L>
<L>More quick to cancel faults, than prone to err.</L>
<L N="420">As the rough swell of the insurgent tides</L>
<L>By the mild impulse of the Moon subsides:</L>
<L>So, by her mystic Monitor represt,</L>
<L>The flood of passion leaves her lighten'd breast,</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="52"/>
From her clear brain each cloudy vapour flies,</L>
<L N="425">And Joy's bright ray rekindles in her eyes.</L>
<L>Reviving Gaiety full lustre spread</L>
<L>O'er all her features, and with smiles she said:</L>
<L>"Let others drive to Pleasure's distant dome!</L>
<L>"Be mine the dearer joy to please at home!"</L>
<L>Scarce had she spoke, when she with sportive ease</L>
<L N="431">Prest her Piano-forte's fav'rite keys,</L>
<L>O'er softest notes her rapid fingers ran,</L>
<L>Sweet prelude to the Air she thus began!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOPHROSYNE! thou Guard unseen!</L>
<L N="435">Whose delicate controul</L>
<L>Can turn the discord of Chagrin</L>
<L>To Harmony of Soul!</L>
<L>Above the lyre, the lute above,</L>
<L>Be mine thy melting tone,</L>
<L N="440">Which makes the peace of all we love</L>
<L>The basis of our own!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So sung the Nymph, not uninspir'd: the Sprite</L>
<L>Invok'd so fondly in the mystic rite,</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="53"/>
With richest music swell'd her warbling throat,</L>
<L N="445">And gave new sweetness to her sweetest note.</L>
<L>As when the seraph Uriel first begun</L>
<L>His carol to the new-created Sun,</L>
<L>The sacred echo shook the vast profound,</L>
<L>And Chaos perish'd at the potent sound:</L>
<L N="450">So, at the magic of SERENA's strain,</L>
<L>Spleen vanish'd from her Sire's chaotic brain;</L>
<L>Whose fibres, lighten'd of that load, rejoice</L>
<L>In the dear accents of her dulcet voice.</L>
<L>Much he inclines his mandate to recall,</L>
<L N="455">And send the Fair-one to the promis'd Ball;</L>
<L>But stubborn Pride forbids him to revoke</L>
<L>The solemn sentence, which Ill-humour spoke.</L>
<L>Still, conscious of her power, the Nymph prolongs</L>
<L>The soft enchantment of her soothing songs;</L>
<L N="460">Which his fond mind in firm attention keep,</L>
<L>To his fixt hour of supper and of sleep:</L>
<L>This now arriv'd, the Knight retiring, shed</L>
<L>A double blessing on his Darling's head;</L>
<L>And with unusual exultation prest</L>
<L N="465">His lovely Child to his parental breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
<L>Thus while to rest the happy Sire withdrew,</L>
<L>The Nymph, more happy, to her chamber flew;</L>
<L>And, Jenny now dismiss'd, the grateful Fair</L>
<L>Breathes to her guardian Sprite this tender prayer:</L>
<L N="470">"Thou kind Preserver! whose attentive zeal</L>
<L>"Gives me in this contented hour to feel</L>
<L>"That dearest pleasure of a soul refin'd,</L>
<L>"The triumph of the self-corrected mind;</L>
<L>"If happy in the strength thy smiles impart,</L>
<L N="475">"I own thy favour in no thankless heart,</L>
<L>"Still let me view thy form, so justly dear!</L>
<L>"Still in kind Visions to these eyes appear!</L>
<L>"Thy friendly dictates teach me to fulfil!</L>
<L>"And let thy aid avert each future ill!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While fond Devotion taught her thus to speak,</L>
<L N="481">The soft Down sinks beneath her lovely cheek,</L>
<L>And settling on her lips, that sweetly close,</L>
<L>Silence, enamour'd, lulls her to repose.</L>

<L>There was a time, when Fortune's bright decrees</L>

<L>And, lightly hovering o'er th' illumin'd bed,</L>

"Their Sires, by Avarice or Ambition led,</L>

"Observe this Fiend, that Nature scorn'd to frame,</L>

And, indeed, when I reflect on the inimitable talents, the public spirit, and the charitable institutions of Swift, I am almost ready to address his Spirit with this humilia∣ting apostrophe:
<Q>"I confess that I have done thee wrong."—</Q>
But a superior attention to the interest of society inclines me to persevere in a very different sentiment, and still to think, that no talents, no virtues in a writer, can properly exempt even the most brilliant work from se∣vere reprehension, when, instead of improving, it has an evident tendency to debase and vilify human nature—a tendency, that I consider as most evident in the composition to which I have alluded:—if I am wrong in this idea, I may yet shelter myself under the authority of two most honourable names—a moral Poet of a ge∣nerous and exalted spirit, and a learned Critic of in∣finite candour and discernment.—In Young's Essay on Original Composition, and in the posthumous work just bequeathed to the public by the lamented Mr. Harris, the misanthropy of Swift is most warmly censured. The words of the latter are so striking and apposite, that I cannot wish for a stronger justification. <Q REND="inline">"Misanthropy is so dangerous a thing, and goes so far in sapping the very foundations of Morality and Reli∣gion, that I esteem the last part of Swift's Gulliver (that I mean relative to his Houyhnhnms and Yahoos) to be a worse book to peruse, than those which we for∣bid, as the most flagitious and obscene. One absurdity in this Author (a wretched Philosopher though a great Wit) is well worth remarking—in order to render the nature of Man odious, and the nature of Beasts ami∣able, he is compelled to give human characters to his Beasts, and beastly characters to his Men; so that we are to admire the Beasts, not for being Beasts, but amiable Men; and to detest the Men, not for being Men, but detestable Beasts."</Q> <BIBL>HARRIS's Philological Enquiries, vol. ii. page 538.</BIBL></NOTE></L>

To blast thy peace, and poison'd darts to aim</L>

<L>For Scandal, restless Fiend, who never knows</L>
<L>The balmy blessing of an hour's repose,</L>
<L N="45">Worn, yet unsated with her daily toil,</L>
<L>In her base work consumes the midnight oil.</L>
<L>O'er fiercer Fiends when heavy slumbers creep,</L>
<L>When wearied Avarice and Ambition sleep,</L>
<L>Scandal is vigilant, and keen to spread</L>
<L N="50">The plagues that spring from her prolific head.</L>
<L>On Truth's fair basis she her falsehood builds,</L>

In Satire's tints the injur'd Fair she drew,</L>

<L>A wealthy Senator, infirm and old;</L>
<L>Who, dup'd too early by a generous heart,</L>
<L>Rashly assum'd a Misanthropic part:</L>
<L>Tho' peevish fancies would his mind incrust,</L>
<L N="70">Good-nature's image lurk'd beneath their rust;</L>
<L>And gay SERENA, with that sportive wit</L>
<L>Which heals the folly that it deigns to hit,</L>
<L>Would oft the sickness of his soul beguile,</L>
<L>And teach the sullen humorist to smile;</L>
<L N="75">Pleas'd by her virtuous frolics to assuage</L>
<L>The mental anguish of distemper'd age.</L>
<L>This ancient friend, in a sarcastic sketch,</L>
<L>Was mark'd by Scandal as a monied wretch,</L>
<L>For whom the young, yet mercenary Fair</L>
<L N="80">Had subtly spread a matrimonial snare.</L>
<L>With such base matter, more diffusely wrought,</L>
<L>The spirit-piercing paragraph was fraught,</L>
<L>O'er which with glee the eye of Scandal glar'd,</L>
<L>Which for the opening Press herself prepar'd;</L>
<L N="85"><PB N="88" REF="92"/>
She on the types her inky wad let fall,</L>
<L>And smear'd each letter with her bitterest gall;</L>
<L>The Press, whose ready gripe the charge receives,</L>

<LG>
<L>Now, as the trembling child, which long has laid</L>

<L N="95">Springs to her breast, and shakes off all alarms,</L>
<L>Feeling its safety in her fostering arms:</L>
<L>With such quick joy, in innocence as young,</L>

<L N="100">And feel the chearful Sun's returning beam.</L>
<L>Eager she rose, in busy thought, nor staid</L>
<L>The wonted summons of her punctual Maid,</L>
<L>And as her own fair hands adjust her vest,</L>
<L>The guardian Cincture flutters on her breast;</L>
<L N="105">For fondly, when she wak'd, or when she slept,</L>
<L>Still round her heart th' important Zone she kept.</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="93"/>
Thou happy Girdle! to thy charge be just!</L>
<L>Firm be thy threads, and faithful to their trust;</L>
<L>For hours approach, when all the stores they hide</L>
<L N="110">Of magic virtue, must be strongly tried!—</L>
<L>Now, while her kind domestic heart intends</L>
<L>To please her early Sire, the Nymph descends;</L>
<L>But Sleep, who left the Fair with sudden flight,</L>
<L>With late wings hover'd o'er the good old Knight;</L>
<L N="115">And the chill circle of the lone saloon</L>
<L>Informs the shiv'ring Maid she rose too soon.</L>
<L>'Tis true, attentive John's unfailing care</L>
<L>Began the rites of breakfast to prepare;</L>
<L>But yet no fires on the cold altar burn,</L>
<L N="120">No smoke arises from the silver urn,</L>
<L>And the blank tea-board, where no viands lay,</L>
<L>Only supplied the Paper of the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' mild SERENA's peace-devoted mind</L>
<L>The keen debate of politics declin'd,</L>
<L>And heard with cold contempt, or generous hate,</L>
<L N="126">The frauds of Party and the lies of State;</L>
<L>Nor car'd much more for Fashion's loose intrigues,</L>
<L>Than factious bickerings, or foreign leagues;</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="94"/>
Yet, while she saunters idle and alone,</L>
<L N="130">Her careless eyes are on the Paper thrown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As some gay Youth, whom sportive friends engage</L>
<L>To view the furious Ourang in his cage,</L>
<L>If while amus'd he sees the monster grin,</L>
<L>And trusts too careless to the bolts within,</L>
<L N="135">If the sly Beast, as near the grate he draws,</L>
<L>Tear him unguarded with projected paws,</L>
<L>Starts at the wound, and feels his bosom thrill</L>
<L>With pain and wonder at the sudden ill:</L>
<L>So did SERENA start, so wildly gaze,</L>
<L N="140">In such mixt pangs of anguish and amaze,</L>
<L>Feeling the wound which Scandal had design'd</L>
<L>To lacerate her mild and modest mind.</L>
<L>Startled, as one who from electric wire</L>
<L>Unheeding catches unsuspected fire,</L>
<L N="145">She reads, then almost doubts that she has read,</L>
<L>And thinks some vision hovers round her head.</L>
<L>Now, her fixt eye some striking words confine,</L>
<L>And now she darts it thrice thro' every line;</L>
<L>Nor could Amazement more her senses shake,</L>
<L N="150">Had every letter been a Gorgon's snake.</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="95"/>
Now rising Indignation takes its turn,</L>
<L>And her flush'd cheeks with tingling blushes burn,</L>
<L>With restless motion and with many a frown,</L>
<L>Thro' the wide room she paces up and down:</L>
<L N="155">Now, musing, makes a momentary stand,</L>
<L>The fatal Paper fluttering in her hand.</L>
<L>So the shy Bird, by cruel sportsmen sprung,</L>
<L>And by their random fire severely stung,</L>
<L>Scar'd, not disabled, by the distant wound,</L>
<L>Now trembling flies, now skims along the ground,</L>
<L N="161">Now vainly tries, in some sequester'd spot,</L>
<L>From her gor'd breast to shake the galling shot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye tender Nymphs! whose kindling souls would flame,</L>
<L>Touch'd, like SERENA's, by injurious blame,</L>
<L N="165">O let your quick and kindred spirits form</L>
<L>A vivid picture of the mental storm</L>
<L>In which she labour'd, and whose force to paint</L>
<L>The Muse's strongest tints appear too faint;</L>
<L>In sympathetic thought her suffering see!</L>
<L N="170">But O, for ever from such wrongs be free!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her faithful Girdle try'd its power to save,</L>
<L>And oft a monitory impulse gave;</L>
<L><PB N="92" REF="96"/>
Still unregarded, still unfelt, it prest</L>
<L>With useless energy her heaving breast;</L>
<L N="175">Her mind, forgetful of the magic Zone,</L>
<L>Full of the burning shaft by Scandal thrown,</L>
<L>With blended notes of sorrow and disdain,</L>
<L>Thus in disorder'd language vents its pain:—</L>
<L>"Had Malice dar'd my honour to defame,</L>
<L N="180">"The self-refuted lie had lost its aim:</L>
<L>"But here the world, deceiv'd by sland'rous art,</L>
<L>"Must think SERENA has a venal heart."</L>
<L>A venal heart! at that detested sound,</L>
<L>In swelling anguish her sunk voice was drown'd.</L>
<L N="185">Now was a fearful crisis of her fate:</L>
<L>Distended now by Passion's growing weight,</L>
<L>And for its Mistress fill'd with conscious dread,</L>
<L>The magic Girdle crack'd thro' every thread,</L>
<L>And snapp'd perchance by Scandal's force accurst,</L>
<L>From her full heart the guardian Zone had burst,</L>
<L N="191">And, spite of all the virtues of the Fair,</L>
<L>The spell of Happiness had sunk in air,</L>
<L>But that SOPHROSYNE, whose friendly fear</L>
<L>Timely foresaw this trial too severe,</L>

An early succour gain'd from secret Love,</L>
<L>From the fell Kite to snatch the falling Dove.</L>

<L>As Nature studies, in her wide domain,</L>
<L>To blend some antidote with every bane;</L>
<L>Thus her kind aid the friendly Power contriv'd,</L>
<L>That, from the quarter whence the wound arriv'd,</L>
<L N="201">There flow'd, the anguish of that wound to calm,</L>
<L>A soothing, soft, and medicinal balm.</L>
<L>As in her agitated hand the Fair</L>
<L>Wav'd the loose Paper with disorder'd air,</L>
<L N="205">In capitals she saw SERENA flame:</L>
<L>She blush'd, she shudder'd, as she view'd the name;</L>
<L>Her ready fears subside in new surprize,</L>
<L>And eager thus she reads with lighten'd eyes:</L>

<L>"Go, faithful Sonnet, to SERENA say</L>

<L>As ancient Chiefs were wont of old to gaze,</L>
<L>With eyes of tender awe and fond amaze</L>
<L>On the fair Priestess of the Delphic fane,</L>
<L>When first she utter'd her prophetic strain,</L>
<L>Entranc'd in wonder, thus Sir GILBERT view'd</L>
<L N="351">His child, yet more inspir'd, who thus pursu'd:</L>
<L>"For me, I own, these lines, with gall replete,</L>
<L>"Shot thro' my simple heart a sudden heat;</L>
<L>"But happier thoughts my rising rage represt,</L>
<L N="355">"And turn'd the pointless insult to a jest:</L>
<L>"And O! should Slander still new wrath awake,</L>
<L>"Still may my Father, for his Daughter's sake,</L>
<L>"Disdain the vengeance of litigious strife,</L>
<L>"And let SERENA's answer be—her life!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="360">She ended with a smile, whose magic flame</L>
<L>Shot youthful vigour thro' her Father's frame:</L>
<L>His Age, his Anger, and his Gout, are fled;</L>
<L>"Enchanting Girl!" with tears of joy, he said,</L>
<L>"Enchanting Girl!" twice echoed from his tongue,</L>
<L N="365">As, speaking, from his elbow-chair he sprung,</L>
<L>"Come to thy Father's arms!—By Heaven, thou art</L>

<L>He spoke; and his fond arms around her curl'd</L>
<L>With proud grasp, seeming to infold the world.</L>
<L N="370">Her conscious heart she feels with triumph beat,</L>
<L>And joys to find that triumph is compleat;</L>
<L>For stiff PENELOPE, who near them stood,</L>
<L>"Albeit unused to the melting mood,"</L>
<L>Squeez'd from her eye-lid one reluctant tear,</L>
<L N="375">And soften'd with a smile her brow severe;</L>
<L>But 'twas a smile of such a gloomy grace,</L>
<L>As lighten'd once upon Alecto's face,</L>
<L>When Orpheus past her, leading back to life,</L>
<L>From Pluto's regions, his recover'd wife,</L>
<L N="380">When Love connubial, join'd to Music's spell,</L>
<L>Moisten'd with tender joy the eyes of Hell.</L>
<L>Far other smiles, with Pleasure's softest air,</L>

<L>She looks like sportive Spring, when her young charms</L>
<L N="385">Wind round her hoary Sire's reluctant arms,</L>
<L>And, by a frolic infantine embrace,</L>
<L>Banish the rugged frown from Winter's face.</L>

<L>Thro' the long day she felt the glowing tide</L>
<L>Of exultation thro' her bosom glide;</L>

And oft she wish'd for slow-approaching Night,</L>

<L>At length the hour approach'd her heart desir'd,</L>
<L>And, in her lonely chamber now retir'd,</L>
<L>Her tender fancy gave the fondest scope</L>
<L N="395">To ardent Gratitude and eager Hope.</L>
<L>"Dear airy Being!" (the soft Nymph exclaim'd)</L>
<L>"Whose power can break the spell that Spleen has fram'd,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, with her lovely eyes devoutly fixt,</L>
<L>Where rays of hope, and fear, and reverence mixt,</L>
<L N="406">The tender Fair her faithful Guard addrest,</L>
<L>Then with her cheek her downy pillow prest;</L>
<L>But long her wakeful lids refuse to close,</L>

<L N="410">Her busy mind the mystic veil would pierce,</L>

Her lips involuntary catch the chime,</L>

<L>That Fairy shape no more she deigns to wear,</L>

<L>From her fair brow a radiant diadem</L>
<L>Rose in twelve stars, and every separate gem</L>

Shot magic rays, of virtue to controul</L>
<L>Some passion hostile to the human soul.</L>
<L N="65">Round her sweet form a robe of aether flow'd,</L>
<L>And in a wonderous car the smiling Spirit rode;</L>
<L>Firm as pure ivory, it charm'd the sight</L>
<L>With finer polish and a softer white.</L>
<L>The hand of Beauty, with an easy swell,</L>
<L N="70">Scoop'd the free concave like a bending shell;</L>

<L>Ambition, with his sceptre snapt in twain,</L>
<L>And Avarice, scorning what his chests contain.</L>
<L>Round the tame Vulture flies the fearless Dove;</L>
<L N="80">Soft Innocence embraces playful Love;</L>

Breathe on the car; whose sight-enchanting frame</L>
<L N="86">Four wheels sustain, of pale and purple flame;</L>
<L>For no fleet animals, to earth unknown,</L>
<L>Bear thro' aetherial fields this flying throne.</L>
<L>As by the subtle electrician's skill,</L>

<L>So these four circles of instinctive fire</L>
<L>Move by the impulse of their Queen's desire,</L>
<L>Mount or descend by her directing care,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, springing from her car, that hovering staid</L>
<L N="96">High in the chamber of the sleeping Maid,</L>
<L>The Goddess, with a voice divinely clear,</L>
<L>Breath'd these kind accents in her Votary's ear:—</L>
<L>"Come, my fair Champion, who so well hast fought</L>
<L N="100">"The useful battles of contentious Thought;</L>

"By one blest effort seal thy triumphs past,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thus she spake, her heavenly arms embrac'd,</L>
<L N="110">And in the car the conscious Maiden plac'd.</L>
<L>Quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend,</L>
<L>No clouds impede them, wheresoe'er they bend.</L>
<L>As thro' the empire of the winds they rush'd,</L>
<L>The winds were all in mute submission hush'd:</L>
<L N="115">And now SERENA, from th' exalted car,</L>
<L>Look'd down, astonish'd, on each sinking star;</L>
<L>Flying o'er lucid orbs, whose distant light</L>
<L>Yet has not reach'd the scope of human sight;</L>
<L>And now, not distant from the bounds of Space,</L>
<L N="120">The guardian Sprite suspends their rapid race;</L>
<L>And, while in deep amaze the Nymph admires</L>
<L>The circling meteor's inoffensive fires,</L>
<L>Pleas'd at her wonder, the mild Power addrest,</L>
<L>With kind intelligence, her earthly guest:—</L>
<L>"Of those three Orbs, that in yon chrystal sphere</L>
<L N="126">"A separate system in themselves appear,</L>
<L>"The last, whose luminous and steady form</L>
<L>"Shines softly bright, and moderately warm,</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="115"/>
"Contains my palace, and the gentle train</L>
<L N="130">"Whom I have wafted to this pure domain.</L>
<L>"At equal distance my dominions lie</L>
<L>"From these two larger worlds, more near thine eye:</L>
<L>"Observe their difference as our wheels advance,</L>
<L>"And passing, take of each a transient glance."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="135">So speaking, to the grosser globe she sprung,</L>
<L>Her car suspended o'er its surface hung,</L>
<L>In heavy air; for round this orb was roll'd</L>
<L>A circling vapour, dull, and damp, and cold.</L>
<L>"Here," says SOPHROSYNE, "those Beings dwell,</L>
<L N="140">"Who wanted soul to act or ill or well;</L>
<L>"Who saunter'd thoughtless thro' their mortal time,</L>
<L>"Without a Care, a Virtue, or a Crime:</L>
<L>"Here still they saunter, in this languid scene;</L>
<L>"But pass the dozing crowd, and mark their Queen."</L>
<L N="145">And now, slow riding on a Tortoise' back,</L>
<L>Her features lifeless, and each fibre slack,</L>
<L>Full in their view the Nymph Indifference came;</L>
<L>The quick SERENA soon perceiv'd her name;</L>
<L>For, as in solemn creeping state she rode,</L>
<L N="150">In her lax hand she held fair GREVILLE's Ode.</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="116"/>
Ne'er did the Muse from her sweet treasure cull</L>
<L>Incense so precious for a Power so dull.</L>
<L>Still, as she mov'd along her even way,</L>
<L>The heavy Goddess try'd to read the lay;</L>
<L N="155">But at each pause her inattentive eye</L>
<L>Stray'd from the paper, which she held awry;</L>
<L>Nor could her lips a single line repeat,</L>
<L>Tho' the soft Verse, most ravishingly sweet,</L>
<L>Thro' Time's dull ear will lasting pleasure spread,</L>
<L N="160">And charm the poppy from Oblivion's head.</L>
<L>Thus like a City Mayor, whose heavy barge</L>
<L>Steers its dull progress at the public charge,</L>
<L>This Power, so cumber'd by her empire's weight,</L>
<L>Makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state.</L>
<L N="165">Around her, tribes of rambling Sceptics crawl,</L>
<L>Tho' moving, dubious if they move at all.</L>
<L>Before her, languid Pomp, her Marshal, creeps,</L>
<L>Whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps:</L>
<L>Its quaint device her dull dominion spoke—</L>
<L N="170">An Eagle, numb'd by the Torpedo's stroke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul,"</L>
<L>SOPHROSYNE exclaim'd; "from this dark goal</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="117"/>
"Pass we to regions opposite to this."</L>
<L>She spoke; and, darting o'er the wide abyss,</L>
<L N="175">Her car, like lightning in soft flashes hurl'd,</L>
<L>Shot to the confines of a clearer world.</L>
<L>Now lovelier views the Virgin's mind absorb;</L>
<L>For now they hover'd o'er a lucid orb.</L>
<L>Here the soft air, luxuriously warm,</L>
<L N="180">Imparts new lustre to SERENA's form:</L>
<L>Her eyes with more expressive radiance speak,</L>
<L>And richer roses open on her cheek.</L>
<L>Here, as she gaz'd, she felt in every vein</L>
<L>A blended thrill of pleasure and of pain;</L>
<L N="185">Yet every object opening to her view,</L>
<L>Her quick regard with soft attraction drew.</L>
<L>SOPHROSYNE, who saw the gentle Fair</L>
<L>Lean o'er these confines with peculiar care,</L>
<L>Smil'd at the tender interest she display'd,</L>
<L N="190">And spoke regardful of the pensive Maid:</L>
<L>"Well may'st thou bend o'er this congenial sphere;</L>
<L>"For Sensibility is Sovereign here.</L>
<L>"Thou seest her train of sprightly damsels sport,</L>
<L>"Where the soft Spirit holds her rural court;</L>
<L N="195"><PB N="113" REF="118"/>
"But fix thine eye attentive to the plain,</L>
<L>"And mark the varying wonders of her reign."</L>
<L>As thus she spoke, she pois'd her airy seat</L>
<L>High o'er a plain exhaling every sweet;</L>
<L>For round its precincts all the flowers that bloom</L>
<L N="200">Fill'd the delicious air with rich perfume;</L>
<L>And in the midst a verdant throne appear'd,</L>
<L>In simplest form by graceful Fancy rear'd,</L>
<L>And deck'd with flowers; not such whose flaunting dyes</L>
<L>Strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes;</L>
<L N="205">But those wild herbs that tenderest fibres bear,</L>
<L>And shun th' approaches of a damper air.</L>
<L>Here stood the lovely Ruler of the scene,</L>
<L>And Beauty, more than Pomp, announc'd the Queen.</L>
<L>The bending Snow-drop, and the Briar-rose,</L>
<L N="210">The simple circle of her crown compose;</L>
<L>Roses of every hue her robe adorn,</L>
<L>Except th' insipid Rose without a thorn.</L>
<L>Thro' her thin vest her heighten'd beauties shine;</L>
<L>For earthly gauze was never half so fine.</L>

<L>Her fair left arm around a vase she flings,</L>

Unnumber'd damsels different charms display,</L>

<L>From her sweet brow the thorny Rose she rends,</L>

<L>So spoke the Knight; and spoke with so much weight,</L>
<L N="110">The listening Females saw his word was fate;</L>
<L>For ne'er did Jove with so resolv'd a brow</L>

<L>Heard the firm Knight his fixt resolve impart,</L>
<L>Tickling at once and torturing her heart.</L>
<L N="125">The Ball she relish'd, but abhorr'd the task</L>
<L>To hide her beauties in a Beldam's mask:</L>
<L><PB N="142" REF="148"/>
Miranda's name would better suit her plan,</L>
<L>A simple Maiden, not afraid of Man;</L>

<L>Trusting her charms will any garb enrich,</L>

<L>So in her glass the ancient Maiden pries,</L>
<L>And dreams new graces in her person rise.</L>
<L>No such delights, whose dear delusions please,</L>
<L>The mild SERENA in her mirror sees;</L>
<L N="145">She, at whose toilet Beauty's latent Queen</L>
<L>Attends, enchanted with her filial mien,</L>
<L>And o'er her Favourite's unconscious face</L>

<L><PB N="143" REF="149"/>
She hastes her glittering garments to adjust,</L>

<L>The native diffidence which sway'd her mind,</L>

<L N="155">The robes of Ariel to the Nymph recall</L>
<L>Those disappointments that may yet befall;</L>
<L>As her fair hands the gauze or tissue touch,</L>
<L>They fondly warn her not to hope too much.</L>
<L>She feels the friendly counsel they impart,</L>
<L N="160">And Caution reigns protector of her heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fateful evening comes—the coach attends,</L>

<L>Then, in Deformity's well-suited pride,</L>
<L>Sour Sycorax is station'd by his side;</L>
<L N="165">And last, with sportive smiles, divinely sweet,</L>
<L>Light Ariel perches on the vacant seat.</L>
<L>Fancy now paints the scene of pleasure near,</L>

<L>Her wish to view the festive sight runs high;</L>
<L N="170">But the fond Nymph remembers, with a sigh,</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="150"/>
From Hope's keen hand the cup of joy may slip,</L>
<L>And fall untasted, though it reach the lip.</L>
<L>As the fine Artist, whose nice toils aspire</L>
<L>To fame eternal by encaustic fire;</L>
<L N="175">If he, with grief, has seen the faithless heat</L>
<L>Mar the rich labour it should make compleat,</L>
<L>When next his hands, with trembling care, confide</L>
<L>To the fierce element his pencil's pride,</L>

<L N="180">Terror and Hope contending in his frame,</L>
<L>While his fair work the dangerous fire sustains,</L>

<L>Hears the Gem crack, and sees its cruel flaws:</L>
<L N="185">With such solicitude the panting Maid</L>
<L>Past the long street, of every noise afraid.</L>
<L>Now, while around her rival flambeaus flare,</L>
<L>And the coach rattles thro' the crowded square,</L>
<L>She fears some dire mischance must yet befall,</L>
<L>Some Demon snatch her from the promis'd Ball;</L>
<L N="191">And dreams no trial more severe than this,</L>

Yet, horrid as it seems, her heart is bent</L>
<L>To bear e'en this, and bear it with content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, whirl'd at length within the Porter's gate,</L>
<L N="196">She thinks what perils at the Ball may wait;</L>
<L>And, as she now alights, the fluttering Fair</L>
<L>Invokes her Guardian to protect her there,</L>
<L>Till thoughts of danger, thoughts of caution, fly</L>
<L N="200">Before the magic blaze that meets her eye.</L>
<L>Th' advancing Nymph, at every step she takes,</L>
<L>Pants with amazement, doubtful if she wakes;</L>
<L>Far as her eyes the glittering scene command,</L>

<L N="205">No vestiges of modern pomp appear,</L>

<L>The rich <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Views of this Palace in Swinburn's Travels.</NOTE>Alhambra of the Moorish kings.</L>
<L>The Peer, who keenly thirsts for Fashion's praise,</L>

His genius, equal to the wildest task,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="220">The Peer himself, his prowess to evince,</L>

<L>All pomp and circumstance of Moorish state:</L>

<L><PB N="147" REF="153"/>
She too must prove, to fix his coy desire,</L>

<L N="240">If sweet SERENA, on this signal night,</L>

They call him EDWIN, who around him throng,</L>
<L>EDWIN, immortaliz'd in BEATTIE's song;</L>
<L N="260">And, sooth to say, within a comely frame,</L>
<L>He bore a heart that answer'd to the name;</L>
<L>For this neat habit deck'd a generous Youth,</L>

<L>Tho' on his birth propitious Fortune smil'd,</L>
<L N="265">No proud parental folly spoil'd the Child;</L>
<L>And Genius, more beneficently kind,</L>

Watching the moment, with infernal care,</L>
<L>To form with deepest art her final snare,</L>

<L>Well might her soul to brilliant hopes incline,</L>
<L>A thousand Youths had call'd her charms divine;</L>
<L N="300">A thousand friends had whisper'd in her ear,</L>

Her youthful fancy, tho' by pomp amus'd,</L>

For in the moment, the lost Fair devotes</L>

<L>Lost in this sweet surprize, she could not hear</L>

SERENA, startled at th' injurious sound,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the following Plays were intended only for a pri∣vate theatre, I have been tempted by that circum∣stance to introduce a kind of novelty into our language, by writing three comedies in rhyme, though the Comic Muse of our country has been long accustomed to express herself in prose, and her custom has the sanction of set∣tled precept, and successful example. The Antiquarian, indeed, may remind me that Gammer Gurton's Needle, one of the earliest of our old plays, with other comic productions of that rude period, was written in rhyme; and possibly some fastidious enemies of that Gothic jin∣gle, as they affect to call it, may consider the present Publication as nothing more than a relapse into the most barbarous mode of dramatic composition.</P>
<P>For the boldness of an attempt, which has no modern precedent to plead in its behalf, some apology may be due to the Public.</P>
<P>In the first place, I beg it may not be supposed, that by writing a comedy in rhyme, I mean to convey an in∣direct
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
censure on the contrary practice. No one can prize more highly than I do the many excellent comedies in prose, with which our language is enriched. I am very far from entertaining a wish to overturn the cere∣monial which the Comic Muse of England has esta∣blished; but I hope to find our country as much a friend to toleration in the forms of literature, as in those of re∣ligion. The custom of other enlightened nations, both ancient and modern, may be pleaded on this occasion in behalf of verse. Aristophanes, in his play of the Clouds, seems to pride himself on his poetry. Ariosto having written two comedies in prose, converted them both into metre at a maturer period of his life; and Moliere, the unrivalled master of the French comie theatre, who has written admirably both in prose and rhyme, is, I think, most admirable, and most truly comic, when he adheres to the latter.</P>
<P>To the author who attempts a comedy in English rhyme, our language seems to offer an advantage, which the French poet did not enjoy. The Comic Muse of France has chiefly confined herself to that structure of verse, which belongs equally to her Tragic Sister. In the poetry of our nation, this particular measure is ap∣propriated to sportive subjects, and though hitherto not used in Comedy, it possesses to an English ear a very co∣mic vivacity. That it is highly calculated for poems of wit and humour, we have a striking proof in that
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
most exquisite production the Bath Guide. How far it may succeed through the varied scenes of an English play, experiment only can determine. As some rea∣ders, on the first sight of a comedy in rhyme, may has∣tily suppose that the fashion and the materials of the work are borrowed from the Theatre of France, I think it proper to declare, in justice to the writers of that country, that they are by no means answerable for any defects which may be found in these dramatic per∣formances. I am not conscious of having borrowed a single character or situation from any comic writer what∣ever, either foreign or domestic.—The first of the three comedies, contained in the present Publication, was founded on a real anecdote related to me by an intimate friend, who, concealing the names of the par∣ties, mentioned their ludicrous adventure as a new and tempting subject for the Comic Muse.—The plan of the second arose in the mind of its author, from his re∣marking the various effects of Connoisseurship in diffe∣rent characters. An attachment to the fine arts, which is allowed to refine and strengthen the virtues of a manly and a generous spirit, has perhaps a peculiar ten∣dency not only to shew, but to increase the narrowness of a vain and feeble mind; and if such a tendency exists, it is the province of a comic writer to counteract and correct it.—The aim of the third comedy in this col∣lection is to laugh at two distinct species of affectation,
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
very prevalent in our age and country; the affectation of refined sentiment, and the affectation of pompous and pedantic expression. I protest however against personal application: and, to guard against it, let me declare, that this ridicule is levelled, not at the great and respectable Veteran in the field of literature, whose phrases may sometimes be borrowed by a character in the play; but at the nameless and servile herd of his awkward imitators.—Vigor and originality of thought give a sanction to the pomp and peculiarity of his lan∣guage. If singularities of style are united with genius and moral excellence, they are properly regarded with a partial respect; but when these singularities are pre∣posterously copied, and seem to prevail as a fashion, they become, I apprehend, very fair subjects of sportive satire.</P>
<P>When I reflect what long and established prejudice a rhyming play must encounter—when I remember that even Dryden himself, the most able advocate, and the greatest master of rhyme in our language, has expressly condemned the use of it in comedy—I am alarmed at the hardiness of my attempt; but when I recollect that time, the most infallible test of literary opinion, has fully shewn the mistake of that immortal Poet, in re∣commending the use of rhyme in English Tragedy, I am inclined to hope that he might be equally mistaken in supposing it utterly unsuited to our Comic Muse. It may be urged indeed, with great truth, that a comedy
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
in rhyme cannot be so close a copy of Nature as a co∣medy in prose, the latter adhering to the very language of common life. But from a sister-art we may borrow, at least a plausible argument in favour of Poetry, on the present occasion. The great master, who has descanted so happily on the principles of Painting, observes with great propriety, in one of his discourses, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we are not always pleased with the most absolute possible re∣semblance of an imitation to its original object: cases may exist, in which such a resemblance may be even disagreeable. I shall only observe, that the effect of figures in wax-work, though certainly a more exact representation than can be given by painting or sculp∣ture, is a sufficient proof that the pleasure we receive from imitation is not increased merely in proportion as it approaches to minute and detailed reality: we are pleased, on the contrary, by seeing ends answered by seeming inadequate means<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourse of December 1782.</NOTE>."</Q>—On these prin∣ciples, which perhaps are equally just in the two kindred arts, a comedy in Rhyme may be still more entertaining than a comedy, of equal merit in other points, which confines itself to prose; and a critic who exclaims against the unnatural effect of a rhyming dialogue, may as justly censure a portrait on canvass, because it is not so exact a copy of life, as an image of coloured wax. In both cases, the artist, whether painter or poet, may be
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
justly called a true and a pleasing copier of Nature, if he preserves as high a degree of resemblance, as his mode of imitation will admit, and embellishes his work with the attractive and almost indispensable graces of ease, spirit, and freedom.</P>
<P>It is said by Voltaire of theatrical composition in general, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tous les genres sont bons hors le genre en∣nuyeux."</Q> If the present comedies fall not within the class which that lively Writer has so justly proscribed, the Author may be allowed to hope, that his liberal and enlightened readers will look with indulgence on a Pub∣lication, which arose from his wish to introduce a strik∣ing, and he trusts not a blamable, variety into the amusements of English literature.</P>

<L>COME, dear Mr. Jonathan, tell me the whole:</L>
<L>An account of a battle I love to my soul;</L>
<L>There is nothing on earth I so truly delight in,</L>
<L>As to hear a brave Soldier discourse about fighting.—</L>
<L>So the Colonel was wounded, you say, near the wall:</L>
<L>Whereabouts was the shot? Did he instantly fall?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>No; recoiling a little, he rush'd on again,</L>
<L>And fought like a lion, made fiercer by pain;</L>
<L>Tho' a cursed keen arrow, an Indian let fly,</L>
<L>Pierc'd the bone of his cheek just below the right eye.</L>
<L>'Twas a horrible wound! but it could not appall him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<L>O mercy! that such a hard fate should befall him.</L>
<L>Alas! I'm afraid that his fine manly face</L>
<L>Must have lost by the scar all its spirit and grace.</L>
<L>Does he look very hideous?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>No; thanks to my Master,</L>
<L>You can hardly perceive that he e'er wore a plaister.</L>
<L>There never was known a more wonderful cure;</L>
<L>But kind Heaven assists my good Master, I'm sure;</L>
<L>Without it, the skill of no mortal could save</L>
<L>The many brave lads he has kept from the grave.</L>
<L>You would weep with delight to behold him surrounded</L>
<L>With a hundred fine fellows, once horribly wounded;</L>
<L>Who with thanks for their lives are still eager to greet him,</L>
<L>And hail him with blessings whenever they meet him.</L>

<L>God reward him, say I, for the good he has done;</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Aye, twice he preserv'd me when all thought me dead,</L>
<L>And once brought me off at the risque of his head.</L>
<L>It was not his business to mix in the strife,</L>
<L>And some thought him mad when he ventur'd his life</L>
<L>To bring off a poor mangled private like me;</L>
<L>But I've still a heart left, in this trunk that you see,</L>
<L>Which loves the brave spirit who snatch'd me from death,</L>
<L>And will serve him, I hope, till my very last breath.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your scenes of hard service, I hope, are all over;</L>
<L>It is now fairly time you should both live in clover.</L>
<L>Your Master, I trust, has brought home as much treasure</L>
<L>As will make him a parliament-man at his pleasure;</L>
<L>And, to recompense you for the wound in your arm,</L>
<L>Perhaps he will buy you a snug little farm.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>When a Gentleman comes from the East, my good girl,</L>
<L>You all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl;</L>
<L><PB N="208" REF="213"/>
You fancy his treasure too great to be told,</L>
<L>And suppose he possesses a mountain of gold.</L>
<L>A few daring blades, by a bold kind of stealth,</L>
<L>Have indeed from the Indies brought home so much wealth,</L>
<L>That with all their keen senses they ne'er could em∣ploy it,</L>
<L>And have dy'd from the want of a heart to enjoy it:</L>
<L>But some hundred brave lads, whom gay youth led to enter</L>
<L>That promising region of hope and adventure,</L>
<L>Have toil'd many years in those rich burning climes,</L>
<L>With small share of their wealth, and with none of their crimes.</L>
<L>Now my Master and I both belong to this tribe;</L>
<L>Not a single Nabob have we kill'd for a bribe;</L>
<L>And to tell you a truth, which I hope you'll not doubt,</L>
<L>We're as poor and as honest as when we set out.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! your Master still poor in so thriving a trade!</L>
<L>And, with patients so rich, has he never been paid</L>
<L>For the wounds he has heal'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="209" REF="214"/>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, my dear, for his fees</L>
<L>I know he has touch'd many thousand rupees;</L>
<L>But the sight of distress he could never endure;</L>
<L>What he took from the rich he bestow'd on the poor.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENNY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well, Heaven will pay him, no doubt, in due season.</L>
<L>But what brings him home?—I would fain know the reason</L>
<L>Why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life:</L>
<L>I suppose, from the want of a cherry-cheek'd wife?</L>
<L>They say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures,</L>
<L>And tho' they've fine shapes they have horrible features.</L>
<L>Does he want a white sweetheart? or has he a Black?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis indeed a white woman that brings us both back:</L>
<L>But, alas! 'tis an old one—my Master, it seems,</L>
<L>Has a fond simple mother that's troubled with dreams,</L>
<L>And he, like a tender and soft-hearted youth,</L>
<L>Resigns his fine prospect, and comes home, forsooth,</L>
<L>Because the old dame has express'd her desires</L>
<L>To see him in England before she expires:</L>
<L>And egad, since he's come she will live long enough,</L>
<L>For she seems to be made of good durable stuff.</L>

<L>Well, now I shall love him a hundred times more</L>

<L>I could stay here all day while you're talking about him.—</L>

<L>Dear excellent Friend, since I owe to your worth</L>
<L>The safety of what I most value on earth,</L>
<L>With those it loves best my heart yields you a place,</L>
<L>And I clasp your kind hand with a sister's embrace.</L>
<L>To judge of the man whom such service endears,</L>
<L>I want not the tardy acquaintance of years;</L>
<L><PB N="211" REF="216"/>
But in strong tho' quick ties, that no chances can sever,</L>
<L>In an instant he seizes my friendship for ever:</L>

<L>My regard and esteem I should still think your due,</L>
<L>From the picture my Felix has drawn of your mind.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>His warm soul to his friends is most partially kind:</L>
<L>But such as I am I most truly am yours;</L>
<L>Your goodness my grateful attachment ensures,</L>
<L>And my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces.</L>
<L>Tho' I ne'er gaz'd before on your personal graces,</L>
<L>I've beguil'd some long weeks of hard wearisome duty</L>
<L>With frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty;</L>

<L>You're an excellent creature to sooth a fond Wife,</L>

<L>To the ten thousand questions I've ask'd you already,</L>
<L>I'll spare you to-day, and, if 'tis in my power,</L>
<L>Mention Felix's name only once in an hour.</L>
<L><PB N="212" REF="217"/>
That my thoughts to the Indies no longer may roam,</L>
<L>Let me talk to you now about matters at home;</L>
<L>Your counsel may make our perplexity less,</L>
<L>And finish our odd tragi-comic distress.</L>
<L>First tell me, and speak without any disguise,</L>
<L>(Tho' I fancy I read all your thoughts in your eyes)</L>
<L>What d'ye think of my Cousin?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her graces indeed</L>
<L>The glowing description of Felix exceed;</L>
<L>Tho' in praising her, oft he with pleasure has smil'd,</L>
<L>Like a father describing his favourite child.</L>
<L>For my part, I think she is lavishly blest</L>
<L>With those beauties by which the pure mind is exprest,</L>
<L>That her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm,</L>
<L>That sweet sensibility shines in her form;</L>
<L>A form, on which no man his eye ever turn'd</L>
<L>Without feeling his breast in her welfare concern'd.</L>
<L>'Tis the lot of such graces, wherever they dwell,</L>
<L>None can see their soft mistress and not wish her well.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Very gallantly said, and the praise is her due—</L>
<L>But how came her Lovers so well known to you?</L>
</SP>

<PB N="213" REF="218"/>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Her Lovers!—dear Madam, I hope you're in jest—</L>
<L>Or if by their vows your sweet Friend is addrest,</L>
<L>Heaven grant, for the peace of her delicate mind,</L>
<L>That her hand may be never to either resign'd!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>From my soul, I assure you, I join in your prayer;</L>
<L>But whence does it spring?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will freely declare,</L>
<L>Tho' they're both men of fortune, fair birth, and good name,</L>
<L>With figures that set some young nymphs in a flame;</L>
<L>Tho' at each, many ladies are ready to catch</L>
<L>At what the world calls, a most excellent match;</L>
<L>Yet, if I have read your fair Cousin aright,</L>
<L>A bosom so tender, a spirit so bright,</L>
<L>Must be wretched with such a companion for life,</L>
<L>As each of these Lovers would prove to his Wife.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>You are right; but their characters where could you know?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>I knew them at college a few years ago,</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="219"/>
Before, by a whimsical odd sort of fate,</L>
<L>And some family losses, too long to relate,</L>
<L>In Europe my views of prosperity ceas'd,</L>
<L>And chance sent me forth to my friends in the East.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX,</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray what sort of youths were these two modish men?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>You now find them both what they seem'd to me then;</L>
<L>Two characters form'd like most young men of fashion,</L>
<L>Whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion:</L>
<L>In each, tho' they're men of an opposite turn,</L>
<L>The same heart-freezing vanity still you discern.</L>
<L>To indulge that dear vanity, each still displays</L>
<L>All the force of his mind, tho' in different ways.</L>
<L>Thence, in spinning weak verse Sapphic's toil never ends,</L>
<L>And Decisive ne'er stops in deriding his friends;</L>
<L>Each equally fancies no nymph can resist</L>
<L>His lips, which he thinks all the Graces have kift.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown!—</L>
<L>The warmth of these Lovers diverts me, I own.</L>
<L><PB N="215" REF="220"/>
Of conquest each seems to himself very clear,</L>
<L>And feels from his rivals no diffident fear.</L>
<L>'Tis easy to see, from their satisfied air,</L>
<L>Each loves his own person much more than the Fair.</L>
<L>But, my poor gentle Coz wishes both at a distance;</L>
<L>And I want to contrive, by your friendly assistance,</L>
<L>To relieve her, and quietly send them from hence</L>
<L>Without the Knight's knowledge.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>As neither wants sense,</L>
<L>Can't the Lady pronounce their dismission at once,</L>
<L>Which none can mistake but an impudent dunce?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>This measure seems easy indeed at first view;</L>
<L>But, alas! 'tis a measure we dare not pursue.</L>
<L>Our warm-hearted, whimsical, positive Knight,</L>
<L>Allows not to woman this natural right;</L>
<L>And hence my young Friend, in a pitiful case,</L>
<L>Knows not how to reject what she ne'er can embrace;</L>
<L>For nothing her Uncle's resentment would smother,</L>
<L>Should she banish one suitor, and not take the other.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then indeed I am griev'd for the Lady's distress;</L>
<L>But how can I aid her?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis hard, I confess,</L>
<L>To a sudden retreat this bold Pair to oblige,</L>

<L>Don't question me what,</L>
<L>Lest you think me a fool for too simple a plot:</L>
<L>'Tis simple, and yet I would venture my life</L>
<L>It will drive from these Beaus all their thoughts of a Wife;</L>

<L>But my voice seems opprest in a heavenly dream;</L>
<L><PB N="258" REF="263"/>
Though your kindness is greater than language can paint,</L>
<L>I beg this fair hand may be free from constraint.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>From constraint!—Gad, if now she affects to demur,</L>
<L>I can tell her my wrath she will so far incur,</L>
<L>She shall go to a convent for life, or at least</L>
<L>Be sent as a venture herself to the East.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Uncle I long have obey'd, and at present</L>
<L>I cannot complain his commands are unpleasant:</L>
<L>Nay more; could he place all mankind in my view,</L>
<L>And bid me chuse from them, my choice would be you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>To this dear declaration my life must reply,</L>
<L>All words are too weak—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>The whole earth I defy,</L>
<L>To shew me a scene more delightful than this;</L>
<L>Dear honest frank Girl, come and give me a kiss;</L>
<L>Thou'rt the creature of Nature much more than of Art,</L>
<L>And I own thee again as the Child of my heart.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN, <HI>entering and speaking to the</HI> Colonel.</SPEAKER>
<L>There are two chests for you, Sir, just come to the hall.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COLONEL.</SPEAKER>
<L>A few Indian things for the Ladies—that's all.</L>
<L><PB N="259" REF="264"/>
Pray, Jonathan, pay those who brought them with this. <STAGE>(giving money.)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MORLEY.</SPEAKER>
<L>My brave lad must share in our general bliss.</L>
<L>Here, Jonathan, if you're to marriage inclin'd,</L>
<L>And can luckily meet with a girl to your mind,</L>
<L>You may marry and settle, as soon as you please;</L>
<L>The Colonel has taken good care of your ease.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>God bless him, whate'er he is pleas'd to bestow!</L>

<SPEAKER>SIR NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Egad, they shall have my new farm on the hill,</L>
<L>And raise young recruits there as fast as they will.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JONATHAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>Heaven prosper you all! I will pray for you ever,</L>
<L>And to serve my King still, as I can, I'll endeavour.</L>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>SIR NICHOLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well said, honest Soldier;—we'll have no delay,</L>
<L>Go and tell the old Parson to keep in the way.</L>

<L>Come with me, fair Cousin, examine my chests;</L>
<L>I long to present you a few bridal vests.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FELIX, <HI>to</HI> Morley.</SPEAKER>
<L>As we view with delight the events of to-day,</L>
<L>A fair lesson, my Friend, in your fate we survey;</L>
<L>While, from love to an aged fond parent, with speed</L>
<L>From wealth's open road you most kindly recede,</L>
<L>Heaven sends you that fortune you nobly have slighted,</L>
<L>And your warm filial piety here is requited;</L>
<L>This bright moral truth by your lot is exprest,</L>
<L>They who seek others' bliss, are by Providence blest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR NICHOLAS, <HI>to</HI> Morley.</SPEAKER>
<L>Here, my worthy young Friend, take and cherish this Fair,</L>
<L>And, trust me, you'll find her deserving your care;</L>
<L>For although of her sex she may have a small spice,</L>
<L>She'll please you ten times where she vexes you twice;</L>
<L>And happy the man, in this skirmishing life,</L>
<L>Who is able to say half as much of his Wife.</L>
