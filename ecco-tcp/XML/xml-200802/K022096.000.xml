<LG>
<L>SWEET youth, sweet smiling nymph, divinely fair,</L>
<L>Source of all joy, and foe to every care;</L>
<L>With whom full many a summer's sunny morn,</L>
<L>While yet the dew drop glittered on the thorn,</L>
<L>I've sought the cliff, or in the flowery vale</L>
<L>Imbibed the fragrance of the evening gale;</L>
<L>Fair fugitive, whose eye of heavenly blue,</L>
<L>And rosy cheek no longer bless my view,</L>
<L>Whose loved idea, which can never fly,</L>
<L>Wakes the fond wish, and heaves the fruitless sigh,</L>
<L>Thy sweet remembrance now the song inspire,</L>
<L>And touch the lover with a poet's fire.</L>

<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>What brighter genius, what distinguished name</L>
<L>Shall lend its lustre to the pleasing theme?</L>
<L>Lives there a man that with superiour art</L>
<L>Sounds all the deep recesses of the heart;</L>
<L>Calls up the genial hopes, the chilling fears;</L>
<L>Now shakes with laughter, now dissolves to tears;</L>
<L>Who, Proteus like, at pleasure shifts the scene,</L>
<L>Or old, or young, impassioned, or serene?</L>
<L>Still faithful to his aim, if such there be,</L>
<L>Blest child of Nature, Garrick, thou art he.</L>
<L>Come then, a while forego the thronged applause,</L>
<L>Which never-erring judgment justly draws,</L>
<L>And with the light, the gay descriptive muse,</L>
<L>While pleased her airy travel she pursues,</L>
<L>Recall the happy scene which once was ours,</L>
<L>The smiles, the graces, and the jocund hours,</L>
<L>With whom we frolicked in our early day,</L>
<L>When pleasure filled her cup without allay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From every quarter of earth's peopled sphere,</L>
<L>See, at the Muse's call, what crowds appear,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Eager alike to run life's little span,</L>
<L>The gay, the reckless progeny of man.</L>
<L>Ah, happy race! far happier than they know,</L>
<L>Light as the summer breeze, first bid to blow,</L>
<L>Unceasing as the busy tribes on wing,</L>
<L>That roam the blossoms, and despoil the spring,</L>
<L>Along the verge of that fair seeming hill,</L>
<L>Where life ascends, and Hebe sports at will,</L>
<L>They move, nor mark upon the neighbouring heights</L>
<L>What envious eyes o'erlook their young delights,</L>
<L>Suspicion, Rumour with uncertain stare,</L>
<L>And farther up the fiend sharp visaged Care;</L>
<L>Blest ignorance! to partial views confined;</L>
<L>Where sight wou'd injure, who wou'd not be blind?</L>
<L>Young is the sense, enjoyment in it's spring,</L>
<L>Hope yet unbroken, fancy on the wing;</L>
<L>The jest, the easy laugh, the wanton wile,</L>
<L>And antick trick which mocks with harmless guile,</L>
<L>These are the sweets their youthful morn bestows,</L>
<L>The bloomy flush of health, and sound repose:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Thrice happy, whom no greater cares employ</L>
<L>Than for to morrow's sure returning joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet have they ills, for man to ills is heir,</L>
<L>And youth, as well as age, has got it's share;</L>
<L>The interdicted wish, the harsh command,</L>
<L>The terrours of Correction's rigid hand;</L>
<L>Mishaps, the chance of light unthinking years,</L>
<L>Pale surfeit, that oft wakes a mother's fears:</L>
<L>Discord beside inflames with little rage,</L>
<L>For Discord has her part on every stage;</L>
<L>But here she walks not in her tragick form,</L>
<L>As easy raised, as easy laid the storm.</L>
<L>Oh how unlike the wasteful ire that rends</L>
<L>The labouring breast when riper age contends!</L>
<L>Turn ye ambitious, at whose unblest call,</L>
<L>War wakes his terrours, and whole nations fall;</L>
<L>Ye whom the curse of civil rage impels,</L>
<L>When parricide, not war, the tumult swells,</L>
<L>As o'er Britannia's much afflicted land</L>
<L>The fiend hath often waved her horrid brand,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<L>Turn, turn, nor in this youthful school despise</L>
<L>To catch the virtues of the simply wise.</L>
<L>Here no ambition mocks it's fruitless toils,</L>
<L>No hero weeps repentant o'er his spoils,</L>
<L>Nor frowning shade of warriour lost in fight</L>
<L>Breaks the soft slumbers of the peaceful night:</L>
<L>Light as the clouds that drop the vernal showers</L>
<L>To ope the buds, and cheer the rising flowers,</L>
<L>Their quarrels pass, and smiling peace returns,</L>
<L>And a new friendship in each bosom burns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too much of discord; glad the wandering muse</L>
<L>The peaceful and more pleasing toil renews,</L>
<L>To mark yon tribe, where o'er the mossy ground</L>
<L>They fly, pursue, and leap, or run, or bound,</L>
<L>As buoyant spirits prompt them, all intent;</L>
<L>As swallows, whom chill winter long hath pent,</L>
<L>Now issuing forth upon the warmer beam,</L>
<L>Wave the smooth pool, or skim the murmuring stream;</L>
<L>Now here, now there their airy sports they ply,</L>
<L>And many a playful circle cleaves the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<L>Still as the eye wide wanders o'er the green,</L>
<L>New aims, new objects, crowd the changeful scene.</L>
<L>Here rise the mimick works of war like hands,</L>
<L>There in mock fight engage the marshaled bands;</L>
<L>Here too the painted galley meets the view,</L>
<L>Along the shores exult the admiring crew,</L>
<L>While o'er the lake it spreads it's silken sails,</L>
<L>And all it's streamers feel the rising gales.</L>
<L>Nor frown ye wise, if wisdom deign to hear,</L>
<L>Because such artless trifles meet the ear;</L>
<L>The rose so loved must bud before it bloom,</L>
<L>And yonder oak, that spreads so wide a gloom,</L>
<L>Beneath whose arms the flocks and herds repose,</L>
<L>His full-grown honours to an acorn owes.</L>
<L>In this fair field are sown the seeds of fame,</L>
<L>In each young bosom lives it's native flame,</L>
<L>Which through these trifles breaks with early ray,</L>
<L>These but the dawnings of their brighter day.</L>
<L>In peaceful councils this shall gain renown,</L>
<L>For that Bellona wreaths the war like crown;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
He too, who gave his galley to the breeze,</L>
<L>One day may hold the empire of the seas;</L>
<L>And now, even now elate with fancied power,</L>
<L>Enjoys the glories of the future hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus roll the months and years, a golden round,</L>
<L>With peace their nights, their days with pleasure crowned;</L>
<L>Nature mean time, industrious to fulfil</L>
<L>The dictates of her mighty Master's will,</L>
<L>The well-beloved task incessant plies,</L>
<L>And sees the work in fair proportion rise;</L>
<L>Acts with new vigour on the conscious soul,</L>
<L>Each part enlarges, and informs the whole.</L>
<L>As when the stream first issues from it's source,</L>
<L>A gentle brook it murmurs without force,</L>
<L>Plays through the pebbles, and with silver maze▪</L>
<L>By many a flower and bending willow strays,</L>
<L>Till with fresh tributary stores supplied</L>
<L>It pours into the main a copious tide;</L>
<L>Thus swells the stream of life; while evermore▪</L>
<L>Impatient youth regards the wider shore,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Where man's adventurous bark with sails unfurled</L>
<L>First tries the deep, and launches on the world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Passed is the dawn, the boyish hours are fled,</L>
<L>And lo the stripling rears his radiant head,</L>
<L>With front erect and brightly beaming eye,</L>
<L>Fresh as the star which gilds the evening sky.</L>
<L>As the young plant, the favourite of some fair,</L>
<L>Her early solace, and her later care,</L>
<L>Uprising soft, with living verdure crowned,</L>
<L>Puts forth it's blooms, and spreads it's fragrance round;</L>
<L>Flushed with the gift of health, sweet rosy hue,</L>
<L>Thus breaks the riper stripling on the view;</L>
<L>In all the pride of youth he stands displayed,</L>
<L>Nor dreams that beauty blossoms but to fade.</L>
<L>Blest season! brightest in life's varied year,</L>
<L>Too soon, alas! thy verdures disappear;</L>
<L>Too soon thy roses wither in the wind,</L>
<L>And leave the sharp unsightly thorn behind.</L>
<L>Mean time from violet beds and wreathed bowers</L>
<L>Advance the graces and the smiling hours,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
With yonder son of hope to sport and play,</L>
<L>And crown the revels of his flowery May.</L>
<L>No more of artless words, which on the tongue</L>
<L>With untaught lisp e'er while imperfect hung;</L>
<L>Proud of his opening reason, nor less vain</L>
<L>Of stature that o'er-tops the younger train,</L>
<L>He glances on them with averted eye,</L>
<L>Admires himself, and walks superiour by.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now glows the bosom with more potent fires,</L>
<L>Teems with new projects, throbs with new desires;</L>
<L>Robuster sports the stripling youth employ,</L>
<L>And all his soul is up for manly joy.</L>
<L>Now to the well-replenished fields he hies,</L>
<L>Sometimes the plain, sometimes the wood-land tries,</L>
<L>Where haunts the partridge, or the timorous hare,</L>
<L>And where the lapwing beats the sounding air;</L>
<L>O'er hill, o'er dale, by lake, or river toils,</L>
<L>And late returns, exulting in his spoils:</L>
<L>The cheerful glass, the lengthened tale succeeds,</L>
<L>And all the game again in fancy bleeds.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Sweet are the slumbers that from toils arise,</L>
<L>More sweet the bliss which innocence supplies;</L>
<L>Light from his couch and well refreshed he springs</L>
<L>What time the lark the lively summons sings;</L>
<L>New joys invite him forth, the dewy morn,</L>
<L>The hound wide opening to the high-toned horn,</L>
<L>The stag unharboured, and the madding throng</L>
<L>With furious emulation borne along;</L>
<L>O'er the swift steed Actaeon like he bends,</L>
<L>And with the masters of the chase contends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus speeds the morn; now sits the sun on high,</L>
<L>And a fierce lustre breaks thro' all the sky;</L>
<L>Parched are the flowers and blossoms, all around</L>
<L>The panting flocks lie scattered o'er the ground,</L>
<L>And from the reach of Phoebus' sultry fires</L>
<L>Imbowered the visionary muse retires.</L>
<L>Not thus the glowing youth; he on the shore,</L>
<L>Where breezy waters spread their grateful store,</L>
<L>Forthwith disrobes, and in the midway flood</L>
<L>Allays the tumult of his boiling blood.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Too daring thou, thus fond the deep to brave,</L>
<L>Be taught the dangers of the insidious wave;</L>
<L>It chills, relaxes, deadly cramps assail;</L>
<L>Ah what shall then thy boasted art avail,</L>
<L>When with exhausted limbs thou strivest in vain</L>
<L>To reach the shores thou never shalt regain?</L>
<L>Such was Ambrosio's, such Endymion's doom,</L>
<L>Oh early lost in youth's ethereal bloom!</L>
<L>Twin brothers they, the only lov'd remains</L>
<L>Of many sons that payed a mother's pains.</L>
<L>I'll-fated dame! to early sorrows bred,</L>
<L>The wretched mourner of a widowed bed,</L>
<L>Whose lord the chance of battle snatched away</L>
<L>E'er yet the double off-spring saw the day:</L>
<L>But now the blooming pair her hopes renew,</L>
<L>In these she seems again her lord to view;</L>
<L>Their filial piety, their rising years</L>
<L>Sooth all her losses, and assuage her tears.</L>
<L>'Twas on a day, the feverish heat to cool,</L>
<L>They sought the windings of the well known pool,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Along whose margin flowers were thickly spread,</L>
<L>And many a poplar reared it's graceful head.</L>
<L>Like two fair swans elate in youthful pride</L>
<L>They breast the waves, and roll the deep aside;</L>
<L>They sport, they toss, now vanish, now appear,</L>
<L>Fate overlooks them with malignant leer.</L>
<L>Ambrosio now the safer shore had gained,</L>
<L>Endymion still within the flood remained;</L>
<L>Full oft the former chid his long delay,</L>
<L>In vain, Death challenges the destined prey:</L>
<L>Chill torture now had seized on all his frame,</L>
<L>Ambrosio saw, he heard the fearful scream;</L>
<L>What doubts, what thrilling woes the youth surprize!</L>
<L>What boding horrours in his bosom rise!</L>
<L>Swift to relieve into the deep he drove;</L>
<L>Oh sad requital of fraternal love!</L>
<L>Exhausted, faint, Endymion round him clings,</L>
<L>And marrs the generous aid his friendship brings.</L>
<L>Vain are all efforts, in the embrace he holds,</L>
<L>Fate ratifies the indissoluble folds;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Nor can or youth find grace, or beauty save</L>
<L>The tender victims from a watry grave;</L>
<L>At once they sink, and once again they rise,</L>
<L>The deep at length ingulfs the precious prize.</L>
<L>Hail hapless pair! ye names for ever dear,</L>
<L>Whose sad remembrance draws the painful tear,</L>
<L>Loved youths, companions of my brighter days,</L>
<L>These mournful rites the song of friendship pays;</L>
<L>So may the song survive when I decay,</L>
<L>Nor die like you, the blossom of a day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see, the sun declines, a fresher breeze</L>
<L>Breathes on the flowers, and rustles thro' the trees:</L>
<L>Far in the vale, where calm retirement dwells</L>
<L>Mid solitary rocks, and moss-grown cells,</L>
<L>O'erhung with shade, that breaks the evening beam,</L>
<L>Now plies the youthful angler on the stream;</L>
<L>Marks the crisped waters with attentive eye,</L>
<L>And cautious flings the well dissembled fly.</L>
<L>Meantime his toils are soothed with various sounds,</L>
<L>The mingled musick of the rural grounds,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
The thrush's mellow note, the lark's more shrill,</L>
<L>The woodman's echo from the neighbouring hill,</L>
<L>While oft the cuckow from the steepy wood</L>
<L>Cheers the soft murmurs of the nether flood.</L>
<L>Thrice happy youth, to whom is given such joy!</L>
<L>Thrice happy, whom such guiltless sports employ!</L>
<L>Such were the dear delights that once were mine,</L>
<L>And such the scenes, loved Erne, which still are thine.</L>
<L>Fairest of floods! with whom my youthful day</L>
<L>Smooth like thyself stole unperceived away;</L>
<L>Blest days! when near thy ample wave I ranged,</L>
<L>To all the busy cares of life estranged;</L>
<L>When up the breezy hill each morn I flew,</L>
<L>And airy youth gave rapture to the view,</L>
<L>The sunny mead, the love-inviting bower,</L>
<L>The rush-clad hamlet, and the ruined tower,</L>
<L>Thy numerous isles, with waving verdure crowned,</L>
<L>And azure hills, the landscape's distant bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But turn we now where other prospects rise,</L>
<L>Proud structured domes, that shade the lessening skies,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
The city's splendour and the motley throng,</L>
<L>By business, or by pleasure urged along;</L>
<L>The scene we vary, not the purposed aim,</L>
<L>For nature in all places is the same:</L>
<L>The rustick, and the citizen we see</L>
<L>In manners differ, but in soul agree;</L>
<L>They love, they hate, to wrath alike give way,</L>
<L>And hopes, and fears by turns their bosoms sway;</L>
<L>Alike the passions live in every mind,</L>
<L>And spread their empire over human kind.</L>
<L>But here within the city's ample round,</L>
<L>Where opulence, and men, and arts abound,</L>
<L>All shoots more forward, nature earlier blooms,</L>
<L>And sooner youth the port of man assumes;</L>
<L>Superiour in each polished art appears,</L>
<L>And thinks, and talks, and acts beyond his years.</L>
<L>Here then amid this fruitful scene of things,</L>
<L>The pride of riches, and the pomp of kings,</L>
<L>Let's mark his motions as the soul expands,</L>
<L>And on the verge of manhood nature stands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
<L>Till now unnoted, or but dimly seen</L>
<L>While the first spring revealed it's fainter green,</L>
<L>Come forth the passions, nor come forth in vain,</L>
<L>An ever wakeful, and imperious train,</L>
<L>Swift agents, full of Heaven's ethereal fires,</L>
<L>Whose magick touch to instant act inspires;</L>
<L>A giant host they approach with fearless van,</L>
<L>Mount up, and take the little fort of man;</L>
<L>Pride, envy, hatred, wrath with fiery glare,</L>
<L>And fell revenge, that knows not how to spare;</L>
<L>A numerous throng which follow without names,</L>
<L>Toss their fierce brands, and spread the works in flames.</L>
<L>Thus when the darts of sultry Sirius fly,</L>
<L>And sudden horrours oft involve the sky,</L>
<L>From the dark riven cloud the thunder rolls,</L>
<L>And frequent flashes wrap the blazing poles;</L>
<L>At once the loosened winds impetuous sweep,</L>
<L>Roar through the forest, and upheave the deep,</L>
<L>Weak to resist the reeling bark gives way,</L>
<L>Rolls with the billows, and admits their sway;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Such the mixed tumult now that inly swells,</L>
<L>And such the force of passions which impels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But this outrageous phalanx to control,</L>
<L>Their heat to temper, and to sooth the soul,</L>
<L>In sweeter notes Love sounds his soft alarms,</L>
<L>And Beauty stands revealed in all her charms;</L>
<L>Awed by her look their terrours they resign,</L>
<L>Compose their rage, and own the form divine.</L>
<L>What hopes, what fears, what mixed emotions rise!</L>
<L>What pleasing anguish now the bosom tries!</L>
<L>Blest raptures! never to be twice enjoyed,</L>
<L>When all is novel, and the sense uncloyed,</L>
<L>E'er blooming youth, unconscious of alloy,</L>
<L>Has proved the fallacy of human joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With love, and earlier oft than love, desire</L>
<L>Wakes in the soul, a loose ungoverned fire,</L>
<L>That quick thro' all the vital frame obtains,</L>
<L>Flames in the heart, and revels in the veins;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Dethrones fair wisdom, and assaults the shrine</L>
<L>Where dwell the virtues, and the graces shine.</L>
<L>Soft is the voice, persuasive are the smiles</L>
<L>With which the mercenary fair beguiles:</L>
<L>How bright the dome that wooes the passing eye!</L>
<L>How sweet the odours which around it fly!</L>
<L>Airs too, Eolian airs salute the ear,</L>
<L>And happiness, and heaven itself seems near—</L>
<L>Turn generous youth, nor let the love-tuned lay</L>
<L>Of Thais lure thy heedless steps astray,</L>
<L>Fly, fly the sorceress, fly her tainted charms,</L>
<L>Remorse, disease, and death are in her arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But other powers, should wily Thais fail,</L>
<L>More fatal oft the youthful sense assail.</L>
<L>Gay blooming, fresh with never fading green,</L>
<L>Here Bacchus opes the jocund nightly scene,</L>
<L>Through the glad circle breaths his social fires,</L>
<L>Cheers with false hopes, and fills with vain desires.</L>
<L>Quick flies the jest, with laughter loud repayed,</L>
<L>And many a chorus echoes through the shade;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Till flushed, and pregnant with the purple god,</L>
<L>As when of old the potent mystick rod,</L>
<L>Waved high in air, with frenzy fired the throng,</L>
<L>And the loud I'o swelled the barbarous song,</L>
<L>At once they rouse, at once their shouts ascend,</L>
<L>And war and tumult o'er the town impend.</L>
<L>Unhappy wanderer! doomed to certain woes,</L>
<L>Whose steps these sons of Belial now oppose;</L>
<L>Thrice hapless he, the youth whose fairer fame</L>
<L>Such wild excesses soil with early shame!</L>
<L>In some lewd quarrel, haply not his own,</L>
<L>This fatal night his force is overthrown;</L>
<L>Struck with base fears his false associates fly,</L>
<L>And leave him in the inglorious cause to die.</L>
<L>Ah what avail him now the joys of wine,</L>
<L>His social merits, and his form divine?</L>
<L>Sealed are those lips, for ever mute that tongue</L>
<L>On which this morn such sweet persuasion hung;</L>
<L>The smiles, the graces, every charm is fled,</L>
<L>And mortal paleness settles in their stead.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
In vain for him the fond expectant sire</L>
<L>Counts the slow clock, and cheers the slumbering fire;</L>
<L>In vain the anxious matron mounts on high,</L>
<L>Looke forth, and often heaves the boding sigh,</L>
<L>Far from her aid a bleeding corse he lies,</L>
<L>And never more shall bless a parent's eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus here while various ills from Bacchus flow,</L>
<L>Mark well the close approach of yonder foe;</L>
<L>Dark son of stratagem, who lives by spoils,</L>
<L>Works in the shade, and nightly spreads his toils.</L>
<L>Detested monster! whom no tears can bend,</L>
<L>At war with all, to all a seeming friend;</L>
<L>Who quotes the maxims of the truly wise,</L>
<L>And feigns to damn the very art he plies;</L>
<L>Who hugs him in the spoil his frauds have won,</L>
<L>And turns to laughter those he has undone.</L>
<L>See how to yonder Youth he winds his way,</L>
<L>Calls up his wiles, and meditates the prey:</L>
<L>Short is the strife with such unequal foes,</L>
<L>At every game a wealthy manor goes;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Flocks, herds, and fields are lost beyond recall,</L>
<L>And one finesse deprives the youth of all.</L>
<L>What shall he do? An hopeless wretch he stands,</L>
<L>No longer now the lord of many lands;</L>
<L>Unhoused, unpitied, forced to beg for bread,</L>
<L>Perhaps from those his former fortunes fed,</L>
<L>Or in the caverns of a jail to lie,</L>
<L>There mourn his folly, and by famine die.</L>

<LG>
<L>These are the changes nature now unfolds,</L>
<L>And thus her favourite son his progress holds;</L>
<L>Here range the virtues, there the vices stand,</L>
<L>He weighs their worth, but with unequal hand;</L>
<L>Warped in his choice the balance he suspends,</L>
<L>And spite of odds the vicious scale descends.</L>
<L>Now Vanity her playful part assumes,</L>
<L>And tricks him out in all her gayest plumes;</L>
<L>South, East, and West are sought with curious care,</L>
<L>And Boreas wafts the fluttering youth a share.</L>
<L>For him the inventive artist hourly plies,</L>
<L>Views every flower, and blends the varied dyes:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
He raves of fashions, gives the important rule</L>
<L>Which guides the mode of every mimick fool;</L>
<L>Smiles, simpers, tosses his fantastick head,</L>
<L>And strikes in thought each hapless fair one dead.</L>
<L>Turn to the insect, youth, that art so vain,</L>
<L>Then, if thou can'st, thy folly still maintain;</L>
<L>Dressed by the summer sun from earth he springs,</L>
<L>Opes his gay downs, and spreads his gold-drop'd wings,</L>
<L>Turns every beauty to the sunny ray,</L>
<L>And winnows with soft wing his easy way,</L>
<L>Till from the North a sudden blast arise,</L>
<L>Down drops the painted flutterer, and dies:</L>
<L>Even such the frail condition, such the span</L>
<L>Which circumscribes the little race of man,</L>
<L>Offspring of earth, that blooms but to decay,</L>
<L>The gaudy, glittering insect of a day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold him now adrift, without a guide,</L>
<L>Borne down where pleasure rolls her rapid tide;</L>
<L>Erroneous flood, that wide it's wave expands,</L>
<L>And in it's progress views a thousand lands;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
A thousand springs their copious urns supply</L>
<L>Swell the rich stream, and pour temptation by.</L>
<L>What stir, what bustle, what a mighty throng</L>
<L>Press to the shores, or urge the deep along!</L>
<L>Nor youth alone, all ages, all degrees,</L>
<L>Female, and male the eye of fancy sees:</L>
<L>For who from Pleasure yet e'er turned the eye,</L>
<L>Despised the Fair, and passed her beauties by?</L>
<L>Deluding sorceress! stored with every art</L>
<L>To warp the judgment, and ensnare the heart.</L>
<L>By thee seduced the warriour doffs his arms,</L>
<L>And sells his laurels for thy softer charms;</L>
<L>The merchant too, caught by thy wily train,</L>
<L>Foregoes the rich, the golden hour of gain:</L>
<L>Thee the fond youth his brighter genius styles,</L>
<L>Hangs on thy looks, and lives but in thy smiles;</L>
<L>Blest youth indeed, if in her smiles sincere</L>
<L>His mistress were as constant as she's fair.</L>
<L>Ah much misjudging, to the future blind,</L>
<L>Who thinks that pleasure always will be kind;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
Then when she sooths, when most her charms delight,</L>
<L>Even then she meditates dishonest flight,</L>
<L>Bids her false breast with well-feigned raptures heave,</L>
<L>And plays the fond one only to deceive.</L>
