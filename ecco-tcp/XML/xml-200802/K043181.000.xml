<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THE</HI> TRAVELLERS <HI>in their Dramatic Tour through</HI> SWITZERLAND, <HI>have derived so considerable a share of their celebrity from your judicious guidance—and their Author owes so much to your zealous friend∣ship on all occasions, that it were impossible to inscribe this</HI> OPERA <HI>to any other person than yourself, with∣out violating those feelings, which have so invariably represented you, as the object of his regard, and esteem.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE STORY on which the following DRAMA is founded, however defective, is not borrowed—Various curtailments, and transpositions of Scenes, have unavoidably deranged the unities of the Piece, for the convenience of Stage represen∣tation. Several of the AIRS, and all the CHORUSES having been written to compiled Music, the critical reader will make a suitable indulgence for some irregular, and uncouth numbers, which he will necessarily meet with.</P>
<P>The AUTHOR has too high a sense of the zealous exer∣tions of his whole DRAMATIS PERSONAE, to make any distinction in that general tribute of thanks, which he gratefully pays to their united merit. To Mr. SHIELD, he is indebted on this occasion, for every thing that friend∣ship, and professional talent, could contribute.—</P>
<P>The Passages omitted on the Stage, are marked with inverted Commas.</P>

Yet the service is still hazardous, for with my dialect, I must continue to disguise those feel∣ings also, which the presence of her I love so na∣turally inspires!—Poor Dalton! harder still is his fate, to loose his own mistress in the kind en∣deavour to secure mine! When in compassion to my natural diffidence, he was prevailed upon to convey my sentiments of affection to JULIA, I little thought it could afford to Miss Somerville the slightest ground, for jealousy or suspicion.

Now for this fam'd Castle, which Lady Phi∣lippa, still thinking it the Count's, is so impa∣tient to behold: no improper scene for an appeal to her pride, from the detection of an impostor: there my day's experiments will terminate; should they fail in the reformation of a wife, they will enable me at least to secure, in honest Dorimond, the happiness of my child.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where is he? I'm impatient to welcome his arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cazell.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's in his own apartments, my lady, but rather in a dishabille.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry this wretch is return'd to torment us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Som.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can all this mean? <STAGE>(aside to Cazell.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cazell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ma'am, the plain matter of fact is, that like other great men, some of the Count's enterprizes have miscarried: his last de∣sign was to dispossess you of this castle; but fail∣ing in this attempt, he has modesty enough, as a freebooter, to put up with one of its dun∣geons!</P>

<P>The leader of the banditti!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Count disgraced, and in a dungeon? Oh, that Mr. Sidney were returned! <STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE> Lopez shall instantly depart for Stras∣burgh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cazell.</SPEAKER>
<P>On what errand, my lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In search of Mr. Sidney, the only person in whom I can safely confide.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>SIDNEY</HI> in his own dress.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>A single wish of your's restores him back to happiness, as well as sight!— <STAGE>(Lifts up his bandeau.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am petrified, astonished, and every way deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so my Lady Philippa, if I have at last but the good fortune to prove—the man to your mind!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Sidney!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear father in faithful Lopez!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>'Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Where's the wonder, Lady Phi∣lippa, that I, an old friend, should have pro∣cured you a more trusty guide than your new fashion'd acquaintance?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can it be possible, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, your fellow-servant in dis∣guise.—But once or twice, young spark, we had nearly been too cunning for each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>'Dalton.</SPEAKER>
<P>'You have contrived Sir, to hit off an admirable character in this travelling mas∣querade.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>'Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>'The shaft of ridicule has reached me. I perceive but too late, that to persist, even in a family prejudice, is unworthy of a great, or a good mind.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>'Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>'<STAGE>(Taking her by the hand)</STAGE> Oh, never too late to renounce an error, which an amiable
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
heart must have long disclaim'd! This billet, which I confess to have perused, has removed all my serious apprehensions. I return it, therefore, as an harmless, tho' unguarded do∣cument of fashionable levity.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Twice has this gallant adventurer saved our only child: join with me then, Lady Philippa, in bestowing her hand upon him, and thus secure the faithful services of an honest fel∣low thro' life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most chearfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dori.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall I ever repay—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by long speeches, Dorimond—You have won her by no feats of ancestry, but your own natural deserts; if she prove a blessing therefore, long may you live to wear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Mr. Sidney, you have taught me at length to feel, that to contribute to the happiness of those around us, is far more honour∣able than all the pomp that heraldry can boast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>'Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Then have I neither toil'd, nor travell'd in vain!'</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>SIR LEINSTER.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Leinster.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you generally contrive that Sir Leinster shou'd be front rank, where there's a prison; and always in the rear, when there's either love, or fair fighting! But I'm in luck that the Comte has got his deserts, tho' I have lost mine! And what a mighty pretty siege you have had, where you've mann'd all your works with women! <STAGE>(looking at Miss Som.)</STAGE> 'Palliluh! why, is the devil's self come to you all, that you ladies shou'd turn soldiers, and your lacquies become fine gentlemen? I dare say, now, it's all very funny, if one could but find out the reason why?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
<SPEAKER>Dan.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, I've heard of all your pranks, and find I am the only sufferer, by keeping my own countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>All shall be explained, Sir Leinster, to your satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dalton.</SPEAKER>
<P>But its time we muster our little garrison, to get a return of our missing, and wounded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is poor Daniel?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>NERINDA,</HI> leading in <HI>DANIEL.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ner.</SPEAKER>
<P>Having properly disposed of the ruf∣fianly Comte, who basely surprized me, I thought in my duty to administer the best comfort in my power to one, who has suffered a little too se∣verely from his own curiosity, and my mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daniel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have an odd way here of re∣warding merit, that's certain; for you open your gates to a banditti, and throw your best friends, neck and heels into a dungeon!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Som.</SPEAKER>
<P>'And is this your arch valet, that put us all in such a fright?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>'The very same; and as inoffensive a creature as ever breath'd.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dau.</SPEAKER>
<P>'What a rare thing my curiosity has prov'd to all except myself! It was rather hard, after escaping the canister-shot of these ladies tongues, to be stuck upon the battlements, to be pelted with double-round, and grape!'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Poor creature!'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where are you wounded, Daniel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not where its likely to disfigure me much, my lady—being as it were—in a place a little out of sight!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll find the means of a speedy cure; but you don't seem to recollect your old friends, Dan?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Som.</SPEAKER>
<P>But here, Dalton, I owe more than I can express. <STAGE>(points to Ner.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dalton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much her debtor also; for she was the guiding star, that led me, a disconsolate wanderer, to this spot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Som.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Is that so, Nerinda?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ner.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Nearly, Ma'am, and one time or other, perhaps you may do me as good a turn.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Som.</SPEAKER>
<P>'The day seems to have been devoted to strange mysteries, and as the night is too far advanc'd to allow of your departure, I trust the new possessor of this castle will allow me to give you welcome.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dalton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most welcome all! for thus our lovely hostess bids me say; and though we have no feats of chivalry to boast, we may, at least, as good∣natured travellers, amuse ourselves with recount∣ing our various adventures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lein.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when you do that, you'll re∣member, if you please, to forget mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>First accept my open recantation! for here do I renounce the vain parade, and follies of false grandeur, convinced, that the just distinc∣tions of honourable rank, are best supported by their own intrinsic merit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then am I raised to the enviable dig∣nity of a happy man. Come, you young destined brides, ere you set out on your nuptial travels, will you deign to accept of a hint from one, who has gone this crooked road before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Som.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, with pleasure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sidney.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then build not too much on convert∣ing a man into a husband, unless you can conde∣scend at the same time—to create that husband your GUIDE thro' life!</P>
