<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this Musical Farce, begs leave to inform the readers, if there should be any, that it was merely intended to introduce the <HI>Little Gipsy</HI> to the public, whose youth and total inexperience of the stage, made it necessary to give as little dialogue to her character as possible, her success depending wholly upon her singing—This reason added to another, which is, that the piece was produced at an early part of the season, when better writers are not willing to come forth, is the best apology the Author can make for its defects.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>GO on, dear sister Dolly—And so my sweet girl was brought to the Widow Gadly's, as a relation of her's from Shropshire, and went by the name of Belton?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes—you had not been gone to London two days, before your father and she met in the Wi∣dow's garden; I was with him, he was very inquisi∣tive indeed, and was struck with her lively manner; I could hardly get him home to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this was beyond expectation; and so, Dolly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, his liking went much beyond my ex∣pectation,
<PB REF="6"/>
or your wishes: In a week he fell in love with her, and is at this time a very dangerous rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure to have some mischief happen in all my schemes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her singing, and twenty little agreeable fooleries she puts, on have bewitch'd him: Her mi∣miking the Gipsies has so inchanted him, that he has prevailed upon her to come to the May-pole to-day among the holiday lads and lasses, and tell their for∣tunes. She has dress'd up herself often and been among 'em, without their knowing who she is—in short, she has bewitch'd the whole village—I am to be there too as her mother—My father will have it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better, while you are telling fortunes, I may talk to her without being observ'd; send but a fortune-teller, or a mountebank, among country people, and they have no eyes, and ears, for any thing else: Where is my father now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon some knotty point with Roger Dozey, the clerk—I must go, and prepare for the frolick: don't be melancholy, Will; the worst that can hap∣pen is to marry the girl without your father's consent, turn gipsy with your wife, and send your children to steal his poultry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But harkee, Dolly, who is to have Mr. Goodwill's May-day legacy? A hundred pounds is a tolerable foundation to build upon—What is become of George, Dolly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not time to tell you—He is a rogue like the rest of you: But as I have a heart that can make an honest man happy that possesses it, so it has a spirit within it to despise a knave, or a coxcomb.</P>

<P>Well, but dear Dozey, you are the fore∣horse of this parish, and can lead the rest of the team as you please. Pray now con over this matter by yourself, you shall sit in my little smoaking room, and have a bottle of my best October to help your study, and when you have finished the bottle, and settled your mind with a dram afterwards, meet me at the may∣pole, and give your opinion. I shall be there by that time, to claim the girl, and the legacy—If it is mine, a good large fee out of it shall be yours. Remember that.—</P>

<P>It is the only thing you have said worth re∣membering—let me see—a large fee, and a good bot∣tle of October will do wonders—and yet to make the union of one and twenty, with sixty-five <HI>fit,</HI> will re∣quire more fees than his purse can furnish, and more October than ever was, or ever will be in his cellar—However, not to be rash—I'll drink the bottle, and consider the case.</P>
