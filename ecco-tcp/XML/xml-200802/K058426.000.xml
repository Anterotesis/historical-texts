<HEAD>THE Lover's Treat: or, UNNATURAL HATRED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>IN this last Century there has been no Vice more gene∣rally rooted in the Minds of Men than a Discordency in Families, and which flows from the very Springs, from which we should naturally expect to find the most agreeable Harmony; but Interest whose Power is invincible, too frequently creates us Enemies where we are most nearly and Consanguinity, which ought most especially to endear to each other, is now become a standing Maxim to forget those tender Principles which Nature claims, and the World must necessarily approve.</P>
<P>This unfortunate Depravity of Sense, laid want of frater∣nal Affection, was the unhappy Cause of many Sufferings and severest Hardships, which a very worthy Youth for many Years endured; and from whom I had a particular Account of a long Series of Misery occasioned by his elder Brother, and since I have his Permission, will give a succinct Account both of him and his Family.</P>
<P>This young Gentleman was the second and last Son of Mr. <HI>Anthony Elstone,</HI> born of a very reputable Family in <HI>Gloucester∣shire,</HI> and whose Father was a wealthy Grazier, worth a con∣siderable
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Deal of Money, but having a very large Family to whom he paid an equal regard: He portion'd out his Sons and Daughters alike, often declaring that one Child was as dear to him as another: and that what he was worth was the happy Effects of his own Industry, so he was determined to dispose it in such a Manner, that no Envy should arise a∣mong his Children from his Partiality, having ten of them, he left to each when died One Thousand Pounds a piece; and as a farther Proof of his paternal Affection, (his Wife dying when the Youngest of his Offspring was but two Years of Age) he resolved never to make a second Choice, in respect to the Memory of a very worthy Woman, and a fond Regard to the infant Blood she left behind her; he look'd on every Child as a particular Blessing sent from Heaven, and as such resolved never to put it in the Power of a Mother-in-Law to contra∣dict his pious Purposes in acting like a tender Father, or enu∣merating his Issue: And consequently, obliging himself to di∣vest those he had Part of their natural Rights, to provide for a foreign Stock.</P>
<P>Many Years before he died he had the Happinness of seeing even the Youngest of his Children disposed of in different Callings, and set up for themselves; amongst which Mr. <HI>An∣thony Elslone,</HI> his Youngest, was well established in Merchandize in the City of <HI>London;</HI> and behaving extreamly well in his Clerkship; he married a Niece of his Master's, who was a Dependant on her Uncle, who gave her to Mr. <HI>Elstone,</HI> with a Fortune of Two Thousand Pounds; and would have done more but that he had a Family of his own to provide for, by this young Gentlewoman he had several little ones, all of whom died in their Infancy, except the last three, <HI>viz. An∣thony</HI> the Eldest, <HI>George</HI> the second Son, and <HI>Jane</HI> their last and only Daughter, who were Twins.</P>
<P><HI>Anthony</HI> and <HI>George</HI> were as opposite in their Dispositions as Fire and Water, the elder being the first that lived up to a Twelvemonth, the fond Parents by an over acted Indulgence,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
ruined his Principles which in Infancy might have been Cul∣tivated to have rendered him, the reverse of which be proved, by that Time he was six Years of Age he was absolute Ma∣ster of the Family, and was passed off as Life and Spirit in one so Young, very soon made him hateful and contemptible to all about him, except his Father and Mother; in about four Years after his Birth their second Son and only Daughter made their Appearance in the World, to the unspeakable transport of their Parents, and the Admiration of all who be∣held them, being without Exception, two of the finest Children that even were born at one Birth. Young as <HI>Anthony</HI> was he conceived an Aversion for his little Brother and Sister, and grew jealous at the Sight of them: this rancourous Disposi∣tion grew up with him, and strengthened with his Years, the other two whose tender Dispositions and Affability of Soul, inclined them to love each other, also excited them to sue for <HI>Anthony'</HI> Affection, but all in vain, he openly declared his Aversion thro' every Action of his Life, and several Times, even at Play attempting to maim or destroy them. This wicked Disposition was once the Occasion of his Father's strip∣ping him stark-naked and disciplin'd him with a Horsewhip till he <HI>had</HI> almost left him for dead; it happen'd Mr. <HI>Elsione</HI> luckily went into the Room when he was within an Inch of rushing a sharp Penknife into his Brother's Throat, which na∣turally enraged the Father and urged him to excuse the fore∣mentioned Justice on him.</P>
<P>Notwithsanding Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI>'s Reason convienced him of the Justice of the Punishment he had inflicted, yet when his Anger subsided. Fondness then prevailed and reduced the pi∣teous Father to an immoderate Flood of Anguish and repene∣ant Tears for having proceeded with such Vigiour to his dar∣ling worthless Son. Master <HI>George</HI> tenderly pleaded for his Brother, and would have prevented the dreadful Stripes he un∣derwent, but even that wrought no Effect upon the Mind of this young Barbarian; for he remembered the Smart of the
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>Whip</HI> to a long and cruel Detriment to his Brother's Interest and Reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI> had been often heard to declare his Intention of providing for his Family by the worthy Example of his Father, this catch'd the Ears of his Son <HI>Anthony</HI> who from twelve Years of Age to Maturity, industriously employed his Thoughts to Engross the <HI>Whole</HI> of what his <HI>Father</HI> should die possessed of. To which End he made it his constant Business to influence his Father against his Brother <HI>George,</HI> whose con∣tinual Obedience and Regard made it a very difficult Task. For Example: Even in Infancy he was unexceptionably en∣dearing to his Parents through a continued Course of Good-Nature, at the same Time giving promising Hopes of an ex∣traordinary Undertaking, when ripen'd into Years; in his School Days he made his Studies his peculiar Care, and by that Time he arrived to the Age of Sixteen, was Master of several Languages; and as he was designed to follow his Fa∣ther's Business closely, applied himself to the perfect Know∣ledge of Merchants Accompts, of which he is justly esteem∣ed to be at this Time the compleatest Master in <HI>Great-Bri∣tain.</HI></P>
<P>His Brother <HI>Anthony</HI> was as entirely regardless of every Advantage of this Nature, Mis making chief and Pleasure his only Study; and having from the Hour of his Birth gain'd such an Ascendency over the Hearts of both his Parents, they found it an impacticable Scheme ever to get the better of that Power their mistaken Fondness had invested him with▪ Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI> was too plainly convinced of the rancourous Dispositi∣on of <HI>Anthony</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inoffensive Brother, therefore tenderly ad∣monish'd his Son <HI>George</HI> to be contented with being put Ap∣prentice to some other Merchant to prevent any Feuds or Ani∣mosities between 'em, tho' he originally designed to have bound him to himself. The good <HI>Youth</HI> received his Father's Advice with that dutiful Respect that became him, tho' sorry to be obliged to leave his Father, and greatly affected with
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
the unnatural and cruel Motive of their Separation. In a short Time Mr. <HI>George</HI> was put Clerk to one Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> an eminent <HI>Hamburgh</HI> Merchant, and seldom visited home above twice or thrice a Year, tho' Mr <HI>Elstone</HI> often went to see him; this Removal any reasonable Person would have thought might have made his <HI>Brother</HI> perfectly easy, but so far from it, the constant Praises he heard of his <HI>Brother</HI>'s good Behaviour and Assiduity in his Business greatly corroded his Mind, as he knew that this universal good Character must entirely frustrate all his wicked Intents of depriving him of his Birth right, and that any Falshoods he could alledge against him must conse∣quently prove ineffectual; but in order to give Birth to his cruel Purposes, he suddenly put on a Mask of Friendship and feign'd a hearty Repentance for his unnatural Behaviour to his <HI>Brother,</HI> earnestly requesting his Father to become his Advo∣cate to poor <HI>George,</HI> and endeavour at his Reconciliation with him. Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI> and his Wife were pleasingly amazed at this wonderful and happy Charge in their Son's temper, and without delay sent for the other home to close this unlucky Breach, and six a wish'd for Friendship between the <HI>Brothers.</HI> Mr. <HI>Elstene</HI> urged his Son <HI>Anthony</HI> to write, but the artful vil∣lain pretended he should be at a Loss to Express himself in a Manner suitable to his Offence, and begged his Father for that Reason to do it for him, to which he joyfully agreed as follows:<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR GEORGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>'TIS with amazing and unspeakable Transport I inform you that your Brother</HI> Anthony <HI>is at last grown sensible of his Error, and feels so strong Compunction for his ill grounded Aversion to you; he can no longer forbear suing for a Reconcilia∣tion, and as he confessed himself unequal to the Task of moving for it as he ought, has entreated me to be his Mediator: I don't in this Case use the Commands of a Parent, but the tender Ad∣monition of a Friend, which I hope will be sufficiently prevalent on your Good-Nature, to come on the Receipt of this to fix a last∣ing</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HI>union between you, which will be an infallible Joy to your Mother and Sister, as also to dear</HI> George's</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>most tenderly affectionate Father, ANTHONY ELSTONE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>George</HI>'s good Sense and Sweetness of Temper was easi∣ly moved to obey his Father's pleasing Summons, and went directly with the Servant who brought the Letter to him. On his approaching to embrace his deceitful <HI>Brother,</HI> he shewed the real Signs of Love, real Pity and Forgiveness, while the the other artfully strain'd from his Eyes the Crocodile's pre∣tending Sorrow, which influenced the generous <HI>Youth</HI> to pay a sincere and grateful Retribution flowing from the Result of an <HI>honest</HI> Heart, and Joy un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eign'd.</P>
<P><HI>When his Brother attempted to make Confession of his Error, he would not permit him to proceed in, but with the politest Tenderness desired him to regard but as a Dream what had passed, and make at once to all the Transport of belonging, and being beloved by a truly affectionate Friend and Brother.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Elstone</HI> with their agreeable <HI>Daughter</HI> bore an equal Part in this pleasing Distress, for such <HI>they</HI> thought it to be in regard to Mr. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who affected every Symp∣tom without feeling the smallest Degree of it; <HI>however,</HI> it passed current upon the worthy Part of <HI>the</HI> Family, who were esolved on <HI>this</HI> seeming Happiness to celebate it <HI>with</HI> a Festival; and as <HI>the</HI> Discord between <HI>these Brothers</HI> was uni∣versally known among <HI>their</HI> Friends and Acquaintance: Many of <HI>them</HI> were invited to a publick Rejoicing, each congratu∣lating the <HI>whole</HI> Family on so laudable and reasonable a Re∣conciliation.</P>
<P><HI>'Tis necessary to inform the Reader that Mr.</HI> George <HI>and Miss</HI> Jenny, <HI>who came together into the World, went Hand in Hand in every Point of Brother and Sisterly Affection, and on</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>such Terms as ought to stand for an Example to all such Re∣lations, though singly born: But alas! those Principles are lost in this present Age, and is almost deemed a Crime in some Fa∣milies to he related to them.</HI></P>
<P>The tender Regard this young Gentleman and his Sister from Infancy preserved for each other, tho' entirely innocent and infallible, was the first Motive thro' the Villainy of <HI>An∣thony</HI> to their long and unprecedented Sufferings.</P>
<P>The Day appointed for their public Rejoicing being come, among their numerous Friends were Mr. <HI>George</HI>'s Master, and his only Son, who had for very near a Twelvemonth paid his Addresses to Miss <HI>Jenny,</HI> by Consent of both Parties, who thought proper to defer their Marriage till her Admirer had served his Clerkship, which he did to his Father, by which Time he would arrive to the Age of Two and Twenty, and the young Lady to about Nineteen. As they were happy in the Knowledge of being designed for each other, entirely cor∣respondent to their Wishes, they passed their Time with a∣greeable Chearfulness, and a pleasing Reflection of being one Day till Death to be rendered inseparab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; they were so near their destin'd Happiness, that it wanted but three Months to confirm it, which was Part of the Discourse at their Feast, and gave Birth to a very barbarous Plot, both on them and poor Mr. <HI>George,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> put in force.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Elstone <HI>being resolved to express the Fullness of his Joy on this Occasion, concluded his Entertainment with a Ball, and because Miss</HI> Jenny <HI>would not seem particular, chose her Bro∣ther</HI> George <HI>for a Partner instead of young Mr</HI> Hume, <HI>her in∣tended Husband. 'Tis true he entreated her to dance with him, but she modestly declined it for the formentioned Reason, as Peo∣ple are apt to take Notice of every Look and Action of a young Couple so near Marriage.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Accordingly Mr. <HI>George</HI> and his Sister both of whom danced most excessively genteel, open'd the Ball with a Minuet and Louvre, and continued Partners for the Night, the whole Company were in a Flow of Spi its and good Humour, ex∣cept the villainous Hypocrite, on whose Account these good∣natured People were all assembled; next Day this Monster of Inhumanity and Falshood, goes to pay a Visit at Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s under a Pretence of strengthening that Affection he had the Night before wav'd for his injured Brother, he staid some Time expatiating on <HI>George</HI>'s kind forgiving Nature, and condemn∣ing his own mistaken Folly in being blind to so much Merit, and obstinately depriving himself for so many Years of his fraternal Love and Friendship. During <HI>his</HI> stay at Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>George Elslone</HI> was obliged to go out for an Hour upon Business of very great Consequence, but made his Brother promise to stay and pass the Evening with <HI>them;</HI> to which <HI>he</HI> readily agreed: While Mr. <HI>George</HI> was gone, young Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s Fondness naturally turn'd his Discourse upon dear Miss <HI>Jenny,</HI> expressing the tenderest Regard for her, and the Hap∣piness he promised to himself when he should become her Hus∣band. Ah! said <HI>Anthony,</HI> with a kind of a Sneer in his Coun∣tenance, <HI>'tis all a Lottery, some Blanks, some Prizes, Women are dangerous Things to encounter:</HI> And the very best of them according to the old Phrase, <HI>Won't upon Trial have much Good∣ness to spare:</HI> adding, that for his Part, if he owed any Man a Spleen he'd advise <HI>him</HI> to marry, but if <HI>he</HI> were his Friend <HI>he'd</HI> sonner offer him a Knife or a Pistol than propose a Match for him; and so you'd say too if you knew as much of the Sex, <HI>said be,</HI> as I do; perhaps, <HI>said Mr. Hume,</HI> you have met with some Disappointment, but that should not urge you to an open War with the rest of Womenkind, but be it as it may, I'm fully persuaded that your Sister is intirely exempt from any of the Follies or Imperfections, which are I own too incidental to Females; and till I find her wrong 'tis my Duty and my Interest to believe <HI>her</HI> in the Right. Why, <HI>says An∣thony,</HI> did I say she was not? No, <HI>says the other,</HI> but you were speaking in reference to Women in general, And tho'
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
I am naturally inclined to be partial to <HI>them</HI> all, I cannot help on every Occasion, to express the tenderest Sentiments of my Soul, for her whom <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> equally <HI>have</HI> fix'd in my Heart a most implicit Regard for; Well well, <HI>replied Anthony,</HI> these are all very fine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lights, and I know you think this Opi∣nion will last as long as you live, yet I'll hold youfifty Gui∣neas that I alter it in less than a Quarter of an Hour. And says Mr. <HI>Huine,</HI> I'll hold you a Hundred to Fifty you don't; done <HI>says the other;</HI> done again, <HI>says Mr. Hume,</HI> neither you or the World combin'd together will ever be able to alter my present Thoughts, in regard to your Sister: You'll stand to the Wager, <HI>says Anthony;</HI> I will, <HI>says young Hume,</HI> and now exert your ut∣most Skill to win it; but I pronounce you the Loser before you begin, upon which this wicked Wretch takes out of his Pocket a forged Letter directed to Miss <HI>Jenny Elstone,</HI> which <HI>he</HI> pretended she had carelessly left in her Escrutore which stood open; upon her being hastily call'd down to her Mamma, that he accidentally coming in, and seeing it to be a Man's Hand to which <HI>he</HI> was a Stranger, <HI>he</HI> had a Curiosity to dis∣cover the Contents, which <HI>he</HI> read to young <HI>Hume</HI> as fol∣lows:<LETTER>

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Now, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> what think you? Why really Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI> that <HI>this</HI> Letter is a villainous Contrivance to blast <HI>both</HI> your <HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Sister</HI>'s Reputation, rather than that <HI>they</HI> are the least concern'd in it, <HI>there</HI> is no single Action of <HI>either</HI> of <HI>their</HI> Lives that proclaims <HI>them</HI> capable of so monstrous a Crime, and so far from being accessary to Miss <HI>Jenny</HI>'s De∣struction, I'm certain Mr. <HI>George</HI> would lose his Life to pre∣serve or vindicate <HI>her</HI> Honour, and as that base Scroll so infa∣mously Calls it in Question, I think myself bound by all <HI>the</HI> Ties of Love and Friendship to find out the wicked <HI>Author</HI> of it, and use him at <HI>his</HI> Villainy deserves; nor will I rest 'till I have put my Resolution in force, and as you are her <HI>Brother</HI> I think you ought to join in so honourable a Design, even at the <HI>Hazard</HI> of your Life.</P>
<P>Why, that is my Intent, <HI>says Anthony,</HI> who was left dead with the Fears of being detected in <HI>this</HI> Villainy: What I said of the Sex just now was only to see <HI>how</HI> far you was inclined to think well of <HI>them,</HI> abstracted from my Sister, in whom I know your Soul is wrapt; and my Reason for <HI>showing</HI> you the Letter, was as my <HI>Brother</HI>'s Character suffers in <HI>the</HI> Con∣tents, and we having but within a few Hours healed up an un∣happy Breach which <HI>had</HI> been from Infancy subsisting: I thought proper to take <HI>the</HI> advice of a Friend in the clearing up this Point, lest by undertaking it myself I might be deem'd fond of retracting the solemn Professions of our new-born Friendship and pleased to think my <HI>Brother</HI> guilty of a Crime which I'm certain his <HI>honest</HI> Nature would most abhor. There∣fore Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> as I have open'd myself so freely to you, let me prevail on you not to take the least Notice of it till we meet again; I'll find an Opportunity to replace the Letter in <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Escrutere and if I don't doubt, but she'll take Notice, then we may publickly endeavour to find out by whom, and what Means it was there placed, it must be by some of the Servants who may be reasonably judged as an Accomplice with the invidious Wretch, whom I suppose has a wicked De∣sign upon <HI>her</HI> Person, and hopes to bring the Matter to bear
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
by blasting <HI>her</HI> Reputation, with a forged Process of an Amour with <HI>her.</HI> I know out eldest Clerk once made an Overture of Marriage, but <HI>Jenny</HI> being engaged to you, <HI>he</HI> was soon repulsed; perhaps <HI>his</HI> Disoppointment <HI>(for I know he was ex∣tremely in Love with her)</HI> may have urged <HI>him</HI> to this wick∣ed Design, at least will endeavour to find it out; agreed, <HI>said Mr. Hume,</HI> and or a Day or two I give you my Word and Honour, to be quite silent in the Affair, nor drop the least Hint of it, even to my Friend <HI>George.</HI> These last Words gave <HI>Anthony</HI> new Spirits, as they afforded him more Leisure to per∣petrate his Cruelty, and with less Hazard of being found out.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> George <HI>returning home, the three young Gentlemen con∣cluded the Evening together.</HI> Anthony <HI>still continuing to repeat the tenderest Sense of Obligations to his Brother, and expressing the highest Satisfaction at their being reconciled; it growing late Mr.</HI> Anthony <HI>took Leave, and went away full fraught with all the Mischief Hell itself could inspire with, to perpetrate the wicked Means to destroy the Happiness and Peace of two Fa∣milies.</HI></P>
<P>Next Morning <HI>he</HI> went out very early to pay a Visit to one Mrs. <HI>Grimes,</HI> an elderly Woman of decayed Circumstances, and <HI>Low Cunning,</HI> whose Son was Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Emanuenfis, who writing several Sorts of exceeding good Hands, he found him put for his Purpose, being possessed of a Heart like his Mother's capable of any Evil, by which he could get a Shil∣ling: This Mrs. <HI>Grimes</HI> kept a little House near <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> in which she entertain'd several Disorderly Women of the lowest Class, among wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Number Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> had a favourite Lady which served his turn as well as the finest or most elegant Creature Nature could produce, having no other Sense of Love superior to that of a Brute, deeming the only Happiness arising from that generous Passion, consisted in the immediate Gratification which Animals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are capable of conceiving.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<HI>Mr.</HI> Anthony <HI>opened his whole Design to the old Woman which was to use the most effectual Means he could to get his poor Brother and Sister totally disinherited, which if Mrs</HI> Grimes <HI>by being Assistant, could bring to bear, he promised her a reward of five Hundred Pounds, and as earnest of his Intention gave her twenty Guineas to encourage her and her Son to put in practise every Method that could forward his barbarous Undertaking, the Money was a sure Bait for both, and she promised most faithfully to transact whatever he should employ her in. Accordingly he told her all that had passed the Night before between him and Mr.</HI> Hume, <HI>in regard to the forged Letter, and made her tho∣roughly acquainted with the Plan, on which she was to proceed, which when she had heard entirely out; the old Jade burst into a Fit of Laughing at a Conceit which came into her wicked Head more immediately to confirm what he had insinuated to young Mr.</HI> Hume, <HI>pray tell me, said she, what Hour and at what Place this young Gentleman is to be found? Oh! replied</HI> Anthony, <HI>you may always be sure to see him going to, or returning from the</HI> Exchange <HI>at the usual Hours, but you don't know him, but I do, Sir, says the Son and his Father too pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fectly well; that's enough, says the Mother, you shall go and point him out to me, and I warrant I do your Business, at that Time they parted, appointing to meet in the Evening to know the Success of their Negociation, about the Hour of Twelve o'Clock away goes Madam and her Son and waited Mr.</HI> Hume<HI>'s coming to the</HI> 'Change, <HI>at his return from thence, she follows him in a very poor Garb suited to her Purpose, and implored his Charity, which he refusing, she still persisting in her Importunity, till be growing tired, hastily bid her begone, upan which with an Air of Resentment, she told him he need not be so short, for 'twas in her Power to do him more Ser∣vice by a secret Knowledge she had, than his trifling Alms could possibly be of to her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as a Proof she bid him not bespeak his Wedding Cloaths, for she was well assured if he did they would be out of fashion for many Years before he'd want them. This Declaration start∣led the young Gentleman, and claimed his Attention, as he knew</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>his Marriage was near at Hand, he thought she must either know his Person, or have a supernatural Understanding, upon which he asked if she had any Knowledge of him, she answered no, nor could she charge her Memory with ever having seen him before, but no Matter for that, at first Sight of you I was rendered ca∣pable by the Linaments of your Face of teaching you to avoid a fatal Snare you'll suddenly fall into, if you don't listen to what I can tell you, said the old Beldam: Mr.</HI> Hume<HI>'s Curiosity began to be raised, so he ordered ber to go to a particular Public House, giving her Six-pence, and wait till he came, not caring to be seen in the Streets, with such an Object of Misery, as she at that time appeared to be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He was not long after, when to the great Surprize of the Man of the House, he called for a Pint of Wine and a private Room ordering this old Trapes to follow him up Stairs, upon which she directly told him in a kind of ambiguous Phrase all that was contained in the Letter Mr.</HI> Anthony <HI>had read to him the Night before; and tho' he gave no Credit to it at that Time, he then began to be staggered in his Opinion, and in short, grew very un∣easy, after she had thoroughly work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d up his Imagination to an absolute Credulity of every Thing she uttered; she told him though she was a Stranger to his Names, she would be bound to tell him the first Letters of each; and that if she thought it worth while to study about it, in a very few Hours by her Art, though he were himself to lock her up, upon Condition she had her Books with her, she'd tell him his Names entire. Well,</HI> says he, <HI>to convince me of a Likelihood of it, tell me directly the first Letters of my Christian and Sirname,</HI> J. <HI>said she, is the first of the Christian, and</HI> H <HI>the first of your Sirname. Mr.</HI> Hume <HI>was perfectly astonished, and began to consider whether it was or was not possible for her to be Mistress of so much Art, or whe∣ther she might not have had some private Intelligence of whom he was, and did this to get Money from him, but that he might be sure to trap her if he could, he bid her if her Art extended so far to tell him any one Circumstance that would happen to him before he slept, that I will, Sir, and to convince you that</HI>

<HI>I don't tell your Fortune for the Lucre of Gain, as many Im∣postors do without knowing any Thing of the Matter: You shan't give me a Farthing more than the Six pence I had of you in the Street; but I'll tell you one Thing that shall happen before you go to Bed, and I will meet you here Tomorrow, and if I tell you Truth will leave it to-your own Houour to reward me as You think fit; to which he agreed, and appointed to meet her next Day at the same Time and Place. And now let's hear what is to happen in particular to Night: Pray, Sir, say she, let me see your Hand, which after she palm'd and peer'd over for about five Minutes, she looked very stedfastly at him and told him there was a young Gentleman that he frequently conversed with, and that to her thinking lived in the same House, and for whom be had hitherto a very great Friendship, but something would hap∣pen that very Night to break it off; not that they would come to any high Word, but a Foundation would be laid for a Coldness that would grow into a mutual Contempt of each other very speedily; and that it would not be long before they came to Repa∣ration. Look ye, Sir, said she,</HI> I am the seventh Daughter of the seventh Son, <HI>(a common Cant the real Professors of Fortune Telling make use on.)

<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>he had given his Honour to be silent till they met again; he con∣cealed the Cause, though twas too obvious, from his Countenance that his Mind was disturbed, as well it might, when labouring with the conflictious Passions of Love, Despair, and Rage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Anthony <HI>whose wicked Heart never rested till he had accomplished his barbarous Design prompted him to fly with eager Haste to his inferral Instruments, where he found the old Caeature stripping out of her ragged Attire, and so pleas'd at the Thoughts of her Adventure, she had scarce Power to recite it for laughing: However, when he heard it he greatly approv'd the Scheme, and ordered her to make a swinging Bowl of Punch to drink to the Success of her next Expedition to the</HI> Royal Ex∣change.</P>
<P>According to <HI>her</HI> Instructions <HI>Anthony</HI> posted away to young <HI>Hume</HI> to forward the Intent of making the <HI>Breach</HI> between him and Mr. <HI>George</HI> that <HI>she</HI> might gain the greater Credit, and be thereby more amply enabled to carry on the Plot and bring it speedily to Perfection, among the rest of her Contrivances she advised Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> to engage his Sister to a Country Dancing, which was to be at a noted private House of Dis∣tinction for the Ladies of Pleasure of the first Order, and con∣trive a means for young <HI>Hume</HI> to know of <HI>her</HI> being there, <HI>which</HI> would naturally confirm <HI>his</HI> growing Jealousy, and cor∣roborate all that could be invented to raise it, a tristing Hint was sufficient: And the Evening for <HI>the</HI> Ball was to be the old Lady's Undertaking, (at one <HI>Lucas</HI>'s) where every Thing was prepared in a very elegant Manner, and the Ladies being all let into the Secret, <HI>they</HI> and <HI>their</HI> Sparks were admonish'd too with the utmost Decorum and good Breeding, but of that we shall treat hereafter. Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s present Business was to go and work upon poor Mr <HI>Hume,</HI> whom <HI>he</HI> found sitting alone in the Compting House reading in a very melancholy Posture: Why, how now, says <HI>Anthony,</HI> why so pensive!

on it very deeply since, and confess notwithstanding my seeming lncredulity to you, that I am greatly alarmed; but to act upon bare Supposition, strongly puzzles me as I am fond of your Sister, and too tenacious of <HI>her</HI> Honour, without some positive Proof of her Misconduct to accuse or condemn her, but pray tell me Mr. <HI>Elstone,</HI> have you gain'd any far∣ther Knowledge concerning the Affair? Partly, says the other, but whether it may serve as Loop or Hinge to <HI>hang</HI> a doubt on, I cannot absolutely say: Poor impatient Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> hastily demanded what it was, expressing in his Countenance all the Agony of Horror and Distraction.—Nay, nay says <HI>Anthony,</HI> put yourself out of Temper so unreasonably till you hear what it is▪ perhaps I may be mistaken in my Conjecture, and you may be working yourself into a Disorder; there is no Grounds for, but in short, I happened to over hear an Appointment be∣tween her and one of her particular intimates, to go to a Ball, and the Place appointed (unless my Ears deceived me) is one of the most infamous Houses in Town. Do you know one <HI>Lucas</HI> a famous Retailer of Beauty in or about <HI>White Chapel?</HI> Know her, answered young <HI>Hume</HI>▪ Aye, too well, she's one of the most notorious Bawds in <HI>Christendom,</HI> sure Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> is not engaged to go thither, if so, I shall no longer doubt the Truth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Letter; but however, that is easily found out, and you and I will go there and confront her in her wick∣edness; with all my Heart, said <HI>Anthony,</HI> but first let me find out whether 'tis so or no, and if it is so I'll give you my Word to go with you, for I am certain there can be no good Intent in a Meeting of that kind at such a Place: that I'm well assured on said young <HI>Hume,</HI> for I have experienced it, for to tell you the Truth, before I fell in Love with your Sister I had a ridiculous Affair of Gallantry there, which cost me a monstrous Sum of Money, and had it not been for my Attach∣men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> might have continued still, but the strict Regard I paid to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r brought me into a Resolution rever more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> associate with the terrible Crew that reside in that House, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle dreaming ever to hear so angelic a Creature as <HI>Jenny</HI> ap∣pears, should scandalously resolve to herd with such a Set of
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Devils, but sure 'tis impossible, added he, yet be it as it may, I'm resolved to know the Truth: He then began to Question whether <HI>George</HI> was of the Party, to which the other answer'd, he was not certain, nor was it very material to <HI>Anthony</HI> to bring him into that Scrape as he had two or three different Pleas for <HI>George</HI>'s Ruin without making him a Party in their Affair, to be short, they concluded to come at the Bottom of Miss <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Designs, and <HI>Anthony</HI> shook Hands with <HI>Hume,</HI> promising him to assist him in the Discovery, with many Pro∣fessions of the most solemn Friendship. Mr. <HI>George</HI> coming into the Room they changed their Discourse, and <HI>Anthony</HI> seemed highly delighted that the Scene was chang'd between them; and <HI>George</HI> on his Part answered his Falsehood with the tenderest Marks of real Love.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> was not in a very extraordinary Humour for Campany, <HI>Anthony</HI> took Leave and went to consult with his evil Counsellers what was farther to be do e to effect his cruel Purposes; upon which the old Woman bid h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m if he could find out who was his Sister's most particular Intimate amongst the Females? Oh! I can tell you that directly, there's one Miss <HI>Edwards</HI> in <HI>Thames-Street,</HI> who is <HI>Jenny</HI>'s greatest Fa∣vourite among all her Acquaintance; upon the least Summons <HI>Jenny</HI> will come into any Scheme of Pleasure, so we'll serd her a Note, and I believe I have some of Miss <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Writing in my Pocket which your Son shall counterfeit, and carry it directly to our House, he's not known, and may pass upon our Family for one of Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Servants.</P>
<P>Accordingly he gives a Copy of Verses of Miss <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Writing to young <HI>Grimes.</HI> who directly wrote the following Epistle to Miss <HI>Elstone</HI> in a beautiful <HI>Italian</HI> Hand as follows:<LETTER>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Young <HI>Grimes</HI> was dispatched with <HI>this</HI> Letter to Miss <HI>El∣stone,</HI> who sent back <HI>her</HI> Service to Miss <HI>Edwards,</HI> and that she would be ready to wait on <HI>her</HI> if she'd call at the Hour appointed, the <HI>Thursday</HI> following: and begg'd her Pardon for not writing for her, Mamma had Company, and she was ob∣liged to make Tea directly.</P>
<P>Away comes <HI>Grimes</HI> with his Message which pleased Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> highly, but when he said that there was Company the old Woman forgetting the Answer, thro' fear cries out to her Son <HI>Suppose the very Gentleman should be there?</HI> Why then, says <HI>Anthony</HI> directly, <HI>My Sister would not have sent such an Answer,</HI> besides you Simpleton, said he, I knew 'twas im∣possible, for Miss <HI>Edwards</HI> is at her Father's Country House at <HI>Enfield,</HI> and don't come to Town this Fortnight; this was the Reason why I pitch'd upon her to make the Appointment, that's well enough, <HI>says the old Woman,</HI> then we are safe, but what's to be done when Miss is to call upon your Sister: Why, says <HI>Anthony, Dick</HI> here shall carry a Note to excuse her com∣ing, and intreat <HI>Jenny</HI> to take Coach directly and meet her at the Lady's House where they are to pass the Evening, in the mean time do you be punctual to the Hour in which you are to
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
meet young <HI>Hume,</HI> so at present farewell; I won't go up to poll this Evening, because I have no Time to lose, therefore don't own I have been here. Away he march'd home, and was immediately accosted by his Sister, who told him of her Invitation from Miss <HI>Edwards,</HI> and tho' she expected to be re∣fused she was resolved to try if the Brute would have Com∣plaisance enough to squire her to the Bali, which he peremp∣torily refused as she expected; upon which his Mother chide him, telling him she wonder'd he would not endeavour to po∣lish himself a little and throw off that Roughness of Beha∣viour which he never had the least Example of, either from his Father or Brother, he answered that Dancing was no En∣tertainment to him, and that <HI>George</HI> would be glad of the Opportunity, so refered her to him.</P>
<P><HI>All that Evening young</HI> Hume <HI>and</HI> George Elstone <HI>were at home alone, but Mr.</HI> Hume <HI>seemed very cold and distant in his Discourse which greatly surprized poor Mr.</HI> George, <HI>who of∣ten kindly enquired into the Reason of his short Manner of speak∣ing to him desiring to know wherein he had offended him, to which the other sullenly replied, Time would show he could not but own he was offended in the highest Degree, and did not doubt but Mr</HI> George <HI>was sensible enough of the Occasion; in this Manner they conversed for some Hours till they parted with a downright Querrel, as well Mr.</HI> George <HI>might to meet with such unexpected ill Treatment from his Friend without a Cause, or knowing what was the Motive of so sudden and un∣kind a Change in the Temper of one who till that Time had ever treated bim with the utmost Marks of friendly Tenderness; 'tis not to be supposed that either these Persons enjoyed much Rest that Night. Next morning when they met Mr</HI> Hume <HI>be retained the sullen Mood he went to bed with: Mr.</HI> George <HI>being con∣scious of not having deserved this unaccountable Alieration in his Friend, took as little Notice of him, but each went to their Bu∣siness without exchanging a Syllable; at Change Time Mr.</HI> Hume <HI>went out, and from thence to his Appointment with his expected Fortune-Tellor, who was punctual to a Minute, he found her at</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<HI>the Door of the Alehouse in the same tattered Trim she appeared in the Day before, but as he thought the Landlord might wonder to see him twice together in such Company, he beckon'd her to him before he got to the House, and directed to another in the next Street, when they were got together, well, Sir,</HI> says she, <HI>have I told you Truth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or no? Indeed,</HI> says he, <HI>You have, and though I'm not pleased at it yet I'm bound in Honour to re∣ward You, and directly gave her a Crown▪ which he supposed would be a valuable present for one in her seeming wretched Circumstance, but Madam expected Gold, not considering that many a Fortune-Teller would have thought him an excellent Chap. Now,</HI> says he, <HI>if you can tell me any Thing farther that is ma∣terial, I'll double that Sum to-morrow: Ah, Sir,</HI> said she, <HI>I can tell you any Thing you want to know, but I wish you'd double the Sum now, for I want to buy a few Cloaths to my Back, for you see I'm very bare, and to convince you that I'm skilled in my Art, I have only this to say to You,</HI> Whatever you do listen to one particular Man (who is your Friend) <HI>on which she descri∣bed</HI> Anthony<HI>'s Person to a Hair, and gave him the first Letters of his Names to his very great Astonishment, and afterwards describing</HI> George, <HI>she bid him carefully avoid such a one, as∣suring him that under the Mask of Friendship, he was a bitter Enemy. She also bid him beware of a fair Young Woman, and farther added that where he loved most he had the least Occa∣sion. Now, Sir, I have said as much to You as I think will be serviceable to You, and will take my Leave; upon which he gave her another Crown, and they parted. Mr.</HI> Hume <HI>first en∣joining her to meet him again in two or three Days, but she took Care not to keep her Word for fear through any Accident she might be found out.</HI></P>
<P>The Day being come when the Ball was to be, Miss <HI>El∣stone</HI> was very elegantly dressed waiting at home for Miss <HI>Ed∣wards,</HI> but inhead of the young Lady, young <HI>Grimes</HI> brings a second Letter to request Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> would take Coach, and come directly with their Man to wait on her there, and begg'd her Excuse for not waiting on her herself, for the young Lady
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
whose Birth Day it was had sent their Coach for her, which had three more in it, but that she was there ready to intro∣duce her; this passed Current with poor Miss, and away she went with <HI>Dick</HI> behind the Coach to attend her: when she came to the appointed Place she was received by the pretended young Lady with the highest Elegance and respectful Breeding. Miss <HI>Elstone</HI> was under a good dea of Confusion when she found her Friend not there; but the Lady who received her begged her not to be uneasy, for Miss <HI>Edwards</HI> had been there and left her Compliments to her, that she was only gone to per∣suade another young Lady to come, whom nobody but Miss <HI>Edwards</HI> could prevail on to oblige them with their Company. Tea was immediately ordered, after which a Glass of Wine round, but still no Miss <HI>Edwards</HI> appeared, and Miss <HI>Elstone</HI> being among a Set of Strangers she began to grow very un∣easy, at last up came half a Dozen Beaus who were imme∣diately addressing Miss <HI>Elstone</HI> who was an undoubted Beauty, which was considerably heightened by an unaffected Modesty.</P>
<P>At last the Musick came, and with much Difficulty Miss <HI>Elstone</HI> was prevailed on to lead down one Dance, which when ended she positively insined upon going home; but as every Body there present had their Cues from Mr. <HI>Anthony,</HI> (who paid the Expence of the whole Night's Entertainment) she was not suffered to stir: she was not only excessively un∣easy but began to suspect by <HI>her</HI> Friend not appearing there was some design laid against her, yet Miss <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Hand be∣ing so well counterfeited, she thought Herself wrong to sup∣pose that so <HI>worthy</HI> a Young Lady would keep bad Company, and began to be a little more composed, but <HI>the</HI> Evening be∣ing pretty far spent, she again insisted upon going Home, but the Company one and all insisted upon her staying Supper to which she sat down, but never eat a Morsel; and upon at∣tempting to slip out after the Cloth was taken away while they were pretending to settle a Dance, she found the Dining-Room Door double lock'd, upon which she shriek'd out, cry∣ing, Oh! Heavens, I'm undone; she then began to reflect on
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
herself for not asking Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> and her Brother <HI>George</HI> to be of the Party, and found too late there was some wicked Fraud in the Affair: the old Lady of the House seeing her burst into Tears, ask'd her the Reason, assuring her she was among Friends, and that she was surprized she should discover such dreadful Signs of Uneasiness; if Madam, answer'd Miss <HI>Jenny,</HI> I'm among Friends, what is the Reason notwithstand∣ing my frequent Solicitation to go home, I've not only been detained against my Will, but must have this Door lock'd up∣on me. Why Child, says the old Lady, you won't think of going home till Morning, there's a Bed for you, 'tis my Daughter's Birth Day, and we are resolved to make a Night on't; at these Words Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> fell into a Soon, and one fit was succeeded so fast by the other that they were obliged to undress and put her to Bed; where when she came a little to herself, and found how she was disposed, she fell into strong Convulsions which lasted for a considerable Time, the old Jade who kept the House began to repent having any Con∣cern in the Affair, and privately sent Word to Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> the Danger his Sister was in, and that they might be rumed upon his Account. He directly sent Word not to own to any living Mortal that she was there, and that he would be with them early in the Morning and get her removed.</P>
<P>About Ten the next Day he went, and ill as she was be∣ing light-headed in a violent Fever) she was conveyed to Mo∣ther <HI>Grimes</HI>'s House, and put to Bed there in a Garret: this secured Mrs. <HI>Lucas,</HI> and was the dreadful Means of poor Miss <HI>Jenny</HI>'s being never after permitted to see her distracted Parents, as they did not know the Place where she was (as they thought to meet Miss <HI>Edwards,</HI> 'twas impossible for her to send, but when it grew near Twelve o'Clock her Father took Coach to Mr <HI>Edwards</HI>'s House, but the Family were in Bed, but he persisting in knocking at the Door, a Servant looking out of Window he asked for his Daughter, and Miss <HI>Edwards,</HI> they told him their young Lady was down at <HI>End-field,</HI> and was not expected Home for a Fortnight; and that
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Miss <HI>Elstone</HI> had not been at their House for several Days past. Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI> returned home full of distracted Thoughts about his Child, and through excessive Tenderness to his Wife, who was just before gone to bed, he concealed his Grief that Night, but in the Morning it burst it's Passage through his Heart, and Mrs. <HI>Elstone</HI> was soon made the melancholy Partner of his Sorrow: Mr. <HI>Anthony</HI> was called on to assist in endeavour∣ing to find her out, and with a pretended Grief set out on that Occasion, but in fact was carefully employed in removing his hapless Sister to that shocking Seat of Infamy before∣mentioned; the whole Family were dispersed to different Parts of the Town, but to no Purpose. <HI>Mr. George</HI> was sent for who was doubly assiduous in the pursuit of her, and that she might be more likely to be found, he advertised her, and by his Father's Order offered a Thousand Pounds reward to any Person who should produce her Living or dead; young <HI>Mr. Hume</HI> was quite convinced that she was false, and credited every Thing her Brother <HI>Anthony</HI> had insinuated against her, but when the whole mischief was perfected by her wicked Brother and his Accomplices, it had a different Effect on her Lover than either he or <HI>Anthony</HI> imagined, for Despair and Grief reduced him to a raging madness which immediately seized him, and he was obliged forthwith to be confined in a private noted Mad house at <HI>Chelsea,</HI> after two or three Days ineffectual Search. Her viliainous Brother with a mixture of pretended Grief and Anger, produces the forged Letter he had shewn to poor young <HI>Hume,</HI> and gave it his Father to read, which when he had done, he vow'd severest Vengeance on his Son <HI>George,</HI> and as her Absence corroborated with the Con∣tents no Arguments could convince him to the Contrary of what was inserted in the Letter. <HI>Mr. Elstone</HI> flew with the utmost Rage to <HI>Mr Hume</HI>'s and shewed him the Letter, which when poor <HI>George</HI> came to be acquainted with, his Distress was not to be painted or conceived; his <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> were equally enraged, the one for the positive Loss of his Daughter, and the other for the dreadful Apprehension of the Loss of his Son.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<HI>Mr. George</HI> used all the Arguments he was master of to con∣vince him how highly they all were injured by that Letter, but to no Purpose; <HI>Mr. Hume</HI> gave up his Indentures, and the Father forbid him from that Instant ever to see him more, nor did he leave the Place till he saw his Son absolutely turned out of Doors The poor melancholy Youth went to a Friends House, where he was very frequent in his Visits, and was greatly esteemed, as he truly deserved; when he told the Story of his being deserted both by his <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> for a Fault he was not Guilty of, nor ever could though reduced to the lowest Ebb of Fortune, his Friend greatly pitied his Di∣stress and promised him all the Assistance in his Power towards his Relief; first he advised him to insist on his master's turn∣ing him over to another, or permit him to serve out his Time with him, but that <HI>Mr. George</HI> declined till he had first endea∣voured to clear up his Reputation with his Father, which both he and his Friend took infinite Pains to do, but to no Pur∣pose, so far from it that <HI>Mr. Jennison</HI> (who was the Person who espoused <HI>Mr. George</HI>'s Cause) offering to be at any Ex∣pence towards finding out the Author of the Letter which had caused the Separation of the Father and Son, he was desired never more to darken the Doors for any Person that would plead in <HI>George</HI>'s Behalf would only be regarded in an equal Light. <HI>Mr. Jennison</HI> finding his Advocation out of tune, resol∣ved never to trouble the old Gentleman again, but in every other Point to serve the unhappy Youth to the extent of his Power.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs.</HI> Elstone <HI>despairing of ever seeing her Daughter more, sickened and Languished out a few Weeks till Death terminated the most sincere and real Sorrow that maternal Fondness ever felt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Anthony</HI> took particular Care to behave with all the Duty and Affection to his Father that <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> was capable of acting, and as an Addition to his Deceit upon the Father's Declaration of cutting off the Brother with a Shilling, and
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
making him his sole Heir, he begged him to forego so severe a Resolution as it must necessarily make him very unhappy to know he was possessed of an Affluence, while they, perhaps, were wandering thro' the World in search of Bread.</P>
<P><HI>This seeming Tenderness made the fond believing Father still more a Friend to his worthless, wicked Son, and in short, he settled the whole of what he was worth upon him and his Heirs for ever, which when he came to possess, would have made him Master of about Twenty Thousand Pounds: As Mr.</HI> Elstone <HI>was very industrious and successful in his Business, he acquired in fewer Years than any Merchant had ever been known to do be∣fore him.</HI></P>
<P>Young <HI>Mr. Hume</HI>'s madness daily encreased, and continued for the Space of fifteen months, at the End of which Time he expired raving to the never-ceasing Sorrow of his discenso∣late Father. This young Gentleman's sad Catastrophe was the lucky means of preventing the Discovery of <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Villainy; for had he retained his Senses but an Hour after he heard of <HI>Miss Jenny</HI>'s Departure from her Father's House, he would undoubtedly have cleared up every Point as Cir∣cumstances, would have so strongly concurred to have proved the Innocence of the abused Party and the unparallel'd Wick∣edness of him who was the base Contriver of this shocking Scene of Ruin.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Miss Jenny</HI> continued so very ill for near three Weeks, that her Life was hourly despaired of, which News pleased <HI>Anthony</HI> extreamly well, but <HI>Mrs Grimes,</HI> who always con∣sulted her own Interest, was resolved (seeing her a beautiful Creature) to spare neither Cost or Pains to restore her, and as her Brother refused to advance a single Shilling upon that Score, the old woman took <HI>Miss</HI>'s Cloaths and Jewels, in which she was brought to her House and sold them to the best Advan∣tages, which amounted to a considerable Value, out of which she laid out about five Pounds to Cloath the poor unfort∣nate

Girl in a plain manner, as soon as she was able to sit up, and when she was tolerably recovered, resolved to make her market of her, and that she might be secure of her Prey, she kept her locked up, never suffering any mortal to go nigh her but herself and Son, sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l providing every Thing necessary for her, and to poor Miss's Imagination behaving with the motherly Tenderness of a disinterested old Woman.</P>
<P>This poor Girl on the Recovery of her Senses demanded by what means she was brought thither, upon which the old Woman mumps up a Tale of seeing her in the Hands of wick∣ed People, and though a Stranger, she rescued her from them; and poor as she was had her brought Home to her House to prevent ill Usage, she must unavoidably have met with where she was, for do you know, <HI>Madam,</HI> said she, the House you was brought from was no less than a common Brothel; and if the wicked Jade who keeps it had not been frighted out of her Senses, seeing you to be a Person of Condition, you had not escaped so luckily, but she knew I was too well acquainted with her Tricks, and have it in my Power to hang her if I had a mind, therefore was glad to let You go at any Rate; I'm sure my poor old Heart bled to see your Danger, and glad I am to find you are likely to do well again, then for∣cing a dissembled Tear or two she desired miss to acquaint her with her Name and Family, all which the infamous Wretch knew before, but the poor unhappy Victim directly told her who she was, and intreated her to take a Letter from her to her Father's House, and go herself with it as she was best able to give an Account of the melancholy Cause of her Absence; in short, Letter after Letter was wrote for several Days, but all committed to the Flames by <HI>Mrs. Grimes,</HI> who pretended that her Father would send no Answer: And in fine, that she was forbid ever to bring any more, for he positively resolved never to see or hear of her again. She told her her mother was dead on the Account, the Loss of whom, as she was looked on to be the Occasion of her Death, greatly added to her Father's Anger, which by all she could

learn was irrevocably fixed against her. The poor Thing al∣so wrote several Letters to her Brother <HI>George,</HI> which met the same Fate of those intended for her Father. Such a mul∣tiplicity of Sorrows might reasonably be thought sufficient to break an adamantine Heart, but it pleased Heaven to preserve this unhappy maid, and furnish her with Strength to bear the severest Griefs her Fate could possibly inflict; when the old Woman brought her new plain Cloaths to put on, she pre∣tended they were her Daughter's which she lent her to save her own, for which this poor Innocent was very thankful and thought herself highly obliged, but on her being able to walk about and intreating to walk down Stairs, she was ter∣ribly startled at <HI>Mrs Grimes</HI> refusing to let her out of the Room, and still insisting to lock her in, alledging that it was dangerous for her to go out lest she should be way laid and in∣trap'd by those wicked People she had redeemed her from, besides, said she, you want for nothing, and my Son and I will be with you as frequently as possible, and till you have gathered Strength you are much better in your own Apart∣ment, than by catching cold, run the Hazard of a Relapse. Poor miss <HI>Jenny</HI> was in the Lion's Paws and obliged to Com∣ply, but began to have a Secret dread at <HI>Richard</HI>'s Approach, who had for his three or four last Visits pretended to be mighty fond of her, and as she was too often in his Power she feared the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsequences of it, which one Evening had liked to have proved very fatal had it not been for a sudden Accident which prevented it. <HI>Mrs Grimes</HI> was gone out for the whole Day and left a strict Charge with her Son <HI>Dick</HI> to take all imaginable Care of poor <HI>Jenny,</HI> which he promised very saithfully to do, paying her several Visits and behaved very decently; at last he proposed if she pleased to play a Game at Cards with her to pass away a few melancholy Hours, which she with great Reluctancy at last consented to, it grow∣ing pretty late in the Evening. According to his Order the maid brought up a roasted Fowl for Supper, and a Bowl of Punch; <HI>Dick</HI> still behaving with the utmost Complaisance, hIS mother not being come Home, he entreated the Favour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
with her after Supper, which he did till all the <HI>Family</HI> were gone to Bed except the maid who sat up for her mistress, when he was quite assured that all was safe, master <HI>Richard</HI> began to be very Amorous, and thereby troublesome to the poor Soul who sat trembling <HI>by</HI> him with terrible Apprehensions of <HI>his</HI> using the horrid Power he had to do her the greatest In∣jury in the World: at last he began to take such Freedoms as too plainly convinced her of his cruel Design, on which she shrieked out, and he being only possessed of a brutal Passion struck her, menacing severest Vengeance on her if she dared to speak above her Breath, telling her plainly he would not stir-out of the Room till he had gained <HI>his Ends;</HI> the poor Soul struggled with him till she had no longer Strength to re∣sist him, and throwing her on the Bed, and intended Sacrifice to <HI>his</HI> Brutality, before he could accomplish <HI>his</HI> wicked Purpose a dreadful Outery of Fire was heard in the Street; and though a terrible Circumstance proved the happy means of Miss <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Deliverance; the very next Door was a very great Oil-shop, which was unhappily set on fire through the Care∣lessness of a Servant who was very sleepy going to Bed, leav∣ing the Candle in an old matted Chair, and in less than two Hours most of the Houses were consumed on that Side of the Street: <HI>Dick</HI> was alarmed at the Outery and ran down di∣rectly, and poor <HI>Jenny</HI> after him as well as she could, tho' more terrified at the Thoughts of the Danger she was in re∣solved within herself to take that Opportunity of escaping from her Prison, late as it was, was determined to sit all Night in the Street rather than run the Chance of being ruin∣ed by that infamous Fellow, in her weak Condition. <HI>The Reader may suppose with the Addition of her Fright she must be terribly reduced—Richard</HI> in his Confusion never missed or thought of her till next Morning, and could not very well tell whether she came out of the Room when he did, or pe∣rished in the Flames; for his Mother's House was reduced to Ashes before she came home, when to her great surprize she found she had not a Place to shelter herself nor bed to lie on, as the Neighbourhood in every Street about are naturally a∣sarmed
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
at such dreadful Disasters. Poor <HI>Jenny</HI> was luckily met by a good-natured Man who was going to the Fire, and perceiving by her Looks she was just come from it, he advised her to go in and set down in the Watch-House, but she told him she had no Money, and she supposed they would not let her set there for nothing, upon which he conducted her, and giving the Watchmen a Shilling with positive Or∣ders to take Care of her that Night.</P>
<P>In the morning she wandered to Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s in hopes of seeing her Brother <HI>George,</HI> bat how great was her Amaze∣ment when she heard of his being turned away in the man∣ner he was, and when she was informed ofher Lover's Death she was like a distracted Creature; farther she was told her Father had cut both her and Mr. <HI>George</HI> off with a Shilling, and made <HI>Anthony</HI> his sole Heir, and that all was owing to her running away, and <HI>George</HI> being thought accessary to it: This Information she received from an old Servant of mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s, who was left in Care of his House till it was lett, his master since his Son's Death having lest off Business and retired into the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Miss Jenny</HI> assured the good man of her and her Brother's Innocence, alledging that she found they had been both be∣trayed but by whom she could not tell; she then requested him to go to her Father with a Letter, but he assured her it would be a sruitless Attempt, for he was so enraged he would not suffer her's or mr. <HI>George</HI>'s Name to be mentioned in his hearing: what to do in this exquisite Distress she could not tell, however, one Gleam of Comfort appeared through all this Cloud of Sorrow, for she got Information where to find mr. <HI>George</HI> at mr. <HI>Jennison</HI>'s; the good-natured man sent for a Coach to conduct her thither, and believing her to be quite Innocent and positively an injured Person, slipped a Guinea into her Hand, and wishing her better Fortune, begged her not to be seen there again, as it might endanger his losing his Place if it should be known. When she arrived at mr.
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
<HI>Jennison</HI>'s, the Joy of seeing her Brother greatly alleviated her misery, as the unexpected Interview did his; they wept and kindly condoled each other's Fate, but from what Cause it sprung they neither of them could imagine: The Cause said mr. <HI>Jennison</HI> is plain enough, your Brother <HI>Anthony</HI> is at the Bottom on it as sure as Light, and he has gain'd his point, and take my word for it one Day or other when it may be too late, his Villainy may be discovered. However, you may depend on this Friend <HI>George,</HI> while I am master of a Shilling neither you or miss <HI>Jenny</HI> shall want, though said he, sighing, Heaven only knows how long that may be, for Things are not with me now as formerly, as indeed it soon after proved, for the poor Gentleman was in about six weeks Time obliged to step aside, and all he was worth in the world was not sufficient to answer the large Demands upon him, which was chiefly occasioned through considerable Losses in Trade.</P>
<P><HI>This unlucky stroke of Fortune drove poor</HI> George <HI>and his Sister into the wide World, but they never separated, shifting for three Years as well as they could for daily Bread: Miss</HI> Jenny <HI>earned what she could by her Needle, at best poor Subsistance. And her Brother, whose Credit was broke amongst the merchants, under∣took to teach those Accompts, and kept a little School, but with much Difficulty between them both could raise even a homely live∣lihood.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Grimes upon her misfortune went to mr. Anthony El∣stone to claim his Promise of the Five Hundred Pound, which be would have declined as not being in immediate Possession of the Fortune, but she insisted on a Bond, which he gave her out of Fear of a Discovery: As to his Sister she was concluded to have perished by the Fire, as they had never heard any Thing of her since.</HI></P>

<HEAD>As Providence has in itself several wonderful and surprising Turns, I must now give a very remarkable Instance of its Care of poor <HI>George</HI> and his Sister <HI>Jane.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GEORGE's Reputation having been so cruelly blasted in <HI>the</HI> City, He chose to reside at a different End of the Town, for which Reason he took a couple of Rooms in one of the little Streets near <HI>Red Lion Square,</HI> and in an Even∣ing in the Summer Time would frequently take a walk with his Sister up as far as <HI>Pancras;</HI> and at the End of one of <HI>Red-Lion Fields,</HI> he had for many weeks observed a venerable clean old man, who did not ask Charity, but bowed with a submissive supplicating Look that claimed a Human Regard from every Passer by, among the rest poor <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Jenny</HI> as often as they could would throw in their mites, and with so tender and compassionate an Air, it seemed rather an Ob∣ligation to themselves than to the Person on whom they be∣stowed their kind Benevolence; the poor old man had taken particular Notice of this couple whom he took for man and wife, but observed something in their Aspect and Deportment that declared them what they really were, two well bred di∣stressed People, and resolved within himself the next Time he saw them to be better acquainted with them. Soon after they took their Evening walk, and the old man spying them at a Distance, made towards them and met them half way the Field: my good master, said he, I beg pardon for stopping you, but <HI>I</HI> have been often obliged to your friendly Charity, and am now come to thank you for it in a particular manner, and if you will condescend to give a poor man your Com∣pany for few moments, I'll conduct you to a House where we

can more freely converse than in this Place, don't be offend∣ed Sir, nor you my good mistress, for what <HI>I</HI> have to say is worth Your Attenuca, and if you should not approve of a Proposal <HI>I</HI> have to make You. <HI>I</HI> can but ask your Pardon and trouble you no farther, they answered him in a very good natured and obliging Manner, and consented to walk back to <HI>Powis Wells,</HI> where they called for a private Room, and the old man to their great Surprize, ordered a Cloath to be laid, and the Table was spread in 'an instant' with a cold Fowl and a Place of Ham, and a Bottle of Wine; he threw aside his Crutches, and begged of 'em not to be surprized if he took the Liberty to alter his Countenance which he did by taking of a long grey Beard and his worsted Cap, and placing in its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a very neat bob wig he had in his Pocket: This Tranformation discovered him to be a very handsome man, very little more than forty Years of Age, and when he pulled off his wash-leather Gloves to sit at Table, made another Discovery of the finest and whitest Hand they had ever beheld; he helped Mr. <HI>George</HI> and his Sister in a very polite manner, and before he eat, drank a Glass of wine to a lasting F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>endship between them, which they very readily pledged; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we have regaled, <HI>said he,</HI> if you are not in haste, I'll tell you the Reason why I have asked this Fa∣vour of You, and hope it will prove as agreeable to you as I have some Reason to believe it will be to me, they soon finished their Collation, and when the Things were taken away he ordered the Landlord not to let any body come to them till they rang, which in a very respectful manner, <HI>he said,</HI> they should not, on which he began asking mr. <HI>George</HI> first of all whether they were man and wife? And upon hear∣ing they were only Brother and Sister, they perceived an un∣usual Joy sparkle in his Eyes, and begged the Favour of miss <HI>Jenny</HI> to favour him with the Privilege of saluting her, which she did, and now, madam, <HI>said he.</HI> give me Leave to inform you that though I live by Charity, I am better able to bestow it than three Parts of those from whom <HI>I</HI> receive

it, but <HI>I</HI> hope as <HI>I</HI> design to do good with what <HI>I</HI> have got <HI>I</HI> shan't be blamed for the means by which <HI>I</HI> have acquired an immense Fortune; and the first Step towards it <HI>I</HI> humbly offer that, and an honest Heart to make you honourably hap∣py for the remaining Part of Life.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> own, madam, <HI>said he,</HI> this is a sudden Attack upon your modesty, but as it flows from the Result of a tender Pas∣sion <HI>I</HI> have for some weeks past sustained for you, <HI>I</HI> hope you will excuse this quick manner of requesting the only. Blessing <HI>I</HI> wish to enjoy on Eath: miss <HI>Jenny</HI> blushed and was at a Loss for words to express her Thanks, and avoid the Appearance of being either forward in complying or impertinently rejecting if what he said was true, must be a very advantageous offer, but to prevent her Confusion her Brother answered for her intreating the Gentleman which he perceived he was not to insalt on a positive Answer till they were a little better acquainted; for, Sir, <HI>said he,</HI> we are two unfortunate Twins who have sustained very great injuries, which have made us the outcast of our Families, and cut us of from a very good inheritance, which <HI>I</HI> believe would have amounted to near <HI>Seven Thousand Pounds</HI> a Piece. Now, Sir, our misfortunes <HI>have</HI> taught us rather to increase that Store of Friendship we imbibed from infancy, therefore thro' every Change of Life <HI>I</HI> am resolved to be a faithful Guar∣dian to my Sister's Honour, and protect her even at Life's Expence from any Danger she may be liable to, not that <HI>I</HI> suspect any ill from You Sir, and hope You will not be offend∣ed at my cautious Care for so dear and near a Relation. No, Sir, replied the other, <HI>I</HI> rather applaud than condemn You for it; but as Earnest of my Truth, I beg, Sir, You will do me the favour to accept of this Trifle for Your pre∣sent Use (putting into his Hand a Silk Purse with fifty Guineas in it.) To-morrow <HI>I</HI> desire to see You and this fair Lady at my House by Dinner; please to enquire for mr. Cornish at the Two Red Lamps in Dean-Street, Soho, where you'll find every Thing <HI>I</HI> hope agreeable to You and your

Sister's Expectations. I won't detain you longer but beg you to consider well on what I have of∣fered, and know me hereafter as a Friend, and I hope a Brother; they took leave, and the Gentle∣man resumed his venerable Appearance, and dis∣charging the reckoning he went to his Stand till Evening, and went home well pleased at his Af∣ternoon's Adventure. Mr. <HI>George</HI> had a great deal of Reason to conceive a high Opinion of his new Acquaintance, and advised his Sister to resolve upon the Match, which she promis'd to do in case every thing answer'd to what he had told them.</P>
<P>Next Day he went to <HI>Dean-street,</HI> and upon the Coach stopping at the Door, was open'd by a foot∣man in a lac'd Livery before the Coachman could get off his Box; and Mr <HI>Cornish</HI> dress'd like a Man of Fashion ready to hand the Lady in, whom he conducted into a very handsome Dining-Room splendidly Furnished, and at one End a noble Sideboard of Plate fit for a Nobleman: Now, Madam, said he, permit me to bid you welcome to your House for that, and all that it contains is Your's if you please to except of it; she bow'd and blush'd, and Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> continu'd paying his Addresses in the politest Manner pos∣sible, Dinner was served, at which there was fif∣teen Dishes, five at a Course with the best the Season of the Year afforded, when that Ceremony was over Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> brought Mr <HI>Elstone</HI> a Pocket
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
Book, out of which he counted out Bank Notes to the amount of upwards of forty Thousand Pounds, which he and his Father before him had amass'd by begging; yet this is not all that I am worth, for I have several Houses, and have often received charity from my tenants in their coaches, who at the same Time did not know they were relieving their Landlord. I have but one Servant belonging to me that knows any thing of my Course of Life, and he's an old Fellow that lived with my Father before my Remembrance: he al∣ways attends me to our House of Rendezvous, and is principal Secretary of our begging State, in short, they pass'd the Afternoon with a Reci∣tal of both their Fortunes; and Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> heard of the Cruelty of <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Jenny</HI>'s Fate he shed a kind, commiserating Tear for both, but most especially for Miss <HI>Jenny,</HI> whom he loved, and was pleased to find she had an equal share of sense and beauty: After <HI>they</HI> had told their separate Tales, Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> requested 'em to pass the E∣vening, and as Mr. <HI>Elstone</HI> was perfectly con∣vinc'd of his being in all Points capable of mak∣ing his Sister happy On Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI>'s moving his suit again, 'twas concluded in a few Days to fix their Widding, which was at <HI>Queen's-Square</HI> Cha∣pel, near <HI>Ormond-street;</HI> and as Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> was King of the Begging Crew, there was a grand Festival held the next Day at their House of Ren∣dezvous, where he resigned his Throne to ano∣ther,
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
allowing a <HI>Yearly Pension</HI> to support the Dignity of their Society, which was kept in more exact Order and strict Decorum than some Consti∣tutions which might fare much better if they were governed by their Example.</P>
<P><HI>The Wedding was kept at home with great Splen∣dor, where was present a young Lady of ten Thou∣sand Pound Fortune, who changed Hearts at first Sight with Mr.</HI> Elstone, <HI>but he not having it in his Power to address the young Lady for want of an equi∣valent Stipend, he heartily sigh'd for her, till his Brother-in-Law perceiving him grow melancholy, en∣quiring into the Cause, soon made up the Match to the unspeakable Satisfaction of both Parties.</HI></P>
<P>As Providence had been careful in rewarding these injured Innocents, so was it no less concern∣ed in punishing the Guilty, as will appear by the powerful End of Mr. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who was in a Visit to Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> attack'd on the Road by a party of <HI>Highwaymen,</HI> whom he endeavoured to rest, but they resolvidg on their Booty, shot at him, which not proving effectual, they drew their Hangers and stabbed him in different Parts of his <HI>Body,</HI> and left him weltering in his Blood upon the Road, where he soon expired. The <HI>Highwaymen</HI> made off, and the Deceased was soon own'd <HI>by</HI> some Pas∣sengers coming along the Road, the News was directly carried to town to his Father, who griev'd much for him, till in a few Days upon searching in his Closet, he found several Papers under his
