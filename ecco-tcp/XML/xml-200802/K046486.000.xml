<HEAD>VERSES ON SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS'S PAINTED WINDOW AT NEW-COLLEGE OXFORD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AH, stay thy treacherous hand, forbear to trace</L>
<L>Those faultless forms of elegance and grace!</L>
<L>Ah, cease to spread the bright transparent mass,</L>
<L>With Titian's pencil, o'er the speaking glass!</L>
<L>Nor steal, by strokes of art with truth combin'd,</L>
<L>The fond illusions of my wayward mind!</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>For long, enamour'd of a barbarous age,</L>
<L>A faithless truant to the classic page;</L>
<L>Long have I lov'd to catch the simple chime</L>
<L>Of minstrel-harps, and spell the fabling rime;</L>
<L>To view the festive rites, the knightly play,</L>
<L>That deck'd heroic Albion's elder day;</L>
<L>To mark the mouldering halls of barons bold,</L>
<L>And the rough castle, cast in giant-mould;</L>
<L>With Gothic manners Gothic arts explore,</L>
<L>And muse on the magnificence of yore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But chief, enraptur'd have I lov'd to roam,</L>
<L>A lingering votary, the vaulted dome,</L>
<L>Where the tall shafts, that mount in massy pride,</L>
<L>Their mingling branches shoot from side to side;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Where elfin sculptors, with fantastic clew,</L>
<L>Oer the long roof their wild embroidery drew;</L>
<L>Where SUPERSTITION, with capricious hand</L>
<L>In many a maze the wreathed window plann'd,</L>
<L>With hues romantic ting'd the gorgeous pane,</L>
<L>To fill with holy light the wonderous fane;</L>
<L>To aid the builder's model, richly rude,</L>
<L>By no Vitruvian symmetry subdued;</L>
<L>To suit the genius of the mystic pile:</L>
<L>Whilst as around the far-retiring ile,</L>
<L>And fretted shrines with hoary trophies hung,</L>
<L>Her dark illumination wide she flung,</L>
<L>With new solemnity, the nooks profound,</L>
<L>The caves of death, and the dim arches frown'd.</L>
<L>From bliss long felt unwillingly we part:</L>
<L>Ah, spare the weakness of a lover's heart!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>Chase not the phantoms of my fairy dream,</L>
<L>Phantoms that shrink at Reason's painful gleam!</L>
<L>That softer touch, insidious artist, stay,</L>
<L>Nor to new joys my struggling breast betray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was a pensive bard's mistaken strain.â€”</L>
<L>But, oh, of ravish'd pleasures why complain?</L>
<L>No more the matchless skill I call unkind</L>
<L>That strives to disenchant my cheated mind.</L>
<L>For when again I view thy chaste Design,</L>
<L>The just proportion, and the genuin line;</L>
<L>Those native pourtraitures of Attic art,</L>
<L>That from the lucid surface seem to start;</L>
<L>Those tints, that steal no glories from the day,</L>
<L>Nor ask the sun to lend his streaming ray;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>The doubtful radiance of contending dies,</L>
<L>That faintly mingle, yet distinctly rise;</L>
<L>Twixt light and shade the transitory strife;</L>
<L>The feature blooming with immortal life:</L>
<L>The stole in casual foldings taught to flow,</L>
<L>Not with ambitious ornaments to glow;</L>
<L>The tread majestic, and the beaming eye</L>
<L>That lifted speaks its commerce with the sky:</L>
<L>Sudden, the sombrous imagery is fled,</L>
<L>Which late my visionary rapture fed:</L>
<L>Thy powerful hand has broke the Gothic chain,</L>
<L>And brought my bosom back to truth again:</L>
<L>To truth, by no peculiar taste confin'd,</L>
<L>Whose universal pattern strikes mankind;</L>
<L>To truth, whose bold and unresisted aim</L>
<L>Checks frail caprice, and fashion's fickle claim;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>To truth, whose Charms deception's magic quell,</L>
<L>And bind coy Fancy in a stronger spell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye brawny Prophets, that in robes so rich,</L>
<L>At distance due, possess the crisped nich;</L>
<L>Ye Rows of Patriarchs, that sublimely rear'd,</L>
<L>Diffuse a proud primeval length of beard:</L>
<L>Ye Saints, who clad in crimson's bright array,</L>
<L>More pride than humble poverty display:</L>
<L>Ye Virgins meek, that wear the palmy crown</L>
<L>Of patient faith, and yet so fiercely frown:</L>
<L>Ye Angels, that from golden clouds recline,</L>
<L>But boast no semblance to a race divine:</L>
<L>Ye tragic Tales of legendary lore,</L>
<L>That draw devotion's ready tear no more:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>Ye Martyrdoms of unenlighten'd days,</L>
<L>Ye Miracles, that now no wonder raise:</L>
<L>Shapes, that with one broad glare the gazer strike,</L>
<L>Kings, Bishops, Nuns, Apostles, all alike!</L>
<L>Ye Colours, that th' unwary sight amaze,</L>
<L>And only dazzle in the noontide blaze!</L>
<L>No more the Sacred Window's round disgrace,</L>
<L>But yield to Grecian groupes the shining space.</L>
<L>Lo, from the canvas Beauty shifts her throne,</L>
<L>Lo, Picture's powers a new formation own!</L>
<L>Behold, she prints upon the crystal plain,</L>
<L>With her own energy, th' expressive stain!</L>
<L>The mighty Master spreads his mimic toil</L>
<L>More wide, nor only blends the breathing oil;</L>
<L>But calls the lineaments of life compleat</L>
<L>From genial alchymy's creative heat;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Obedient forms to the bright fusion gives,</L>
<L>While in the warm enamel Nature lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ARTIST, tis thine, from the broad window's height,</L>
<L>To add new lustre to religious light:</L>
<L>Not of it's pomp to strip this antient shrine,</L>
<L>But bid that pomp with purer radiance shine:</L>
<L>With arts unknown before, to reconcile</L>
<L>The willing Graces to the Gothic pile.</L>
