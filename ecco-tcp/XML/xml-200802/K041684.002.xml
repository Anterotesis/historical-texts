<L>A Rope-maker a Poet!—write a play!</L>
<L>O hang the blockhead! wicked wits will say;</L>
<L>—Before you turn him off—a word I pray.</L>
<L>Genius is not to place, or state fix'd down,</L>
<L>But flies at random all about the town;</L>
<L>Now at Whitehall, now at St. James's smiles,</L>
<L>Then whisks to Wapping, or to Broad St. Giles.</L>
<L>O let not prejudice, rank weed, take root,</L>
<L>Which may of Genius choak the fairest fruit:</L>
<L>If none but gentlemen high-born must write,</L>
<L>I fear we soon should wish you all good night!</L>
<L>Shakespeare and Johnson, our Dramatick Lords,</L>
<L>Did they amuse themselves with twisting cords?</L>
<L><PB N="226" REF="4"/>
Were they fine gentlemen?—O no—Old Ben</L>
<L>Was famous for his trowel as his pen;</L>
<L>With mortar and the Muse he pass'd his days,</L>
<L>And built good walls, before he built good plays.</L>
<L>Shakespeare, a genius born! his taste was such,</L>
<L>Too exquisite! he lov'd fat buck too much!</L>
<L>And he whose matchless muse can soften rocks,</L>
<L>Fled to Parnassus to avoid the Stocks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to the Rope-maker I come again,—</L>
<L>Who having spun much hemp, now spins his brain:</L>
<L>This <HI>hempen</HI> produce any test will stand;</L>
<L>This, of his brain, may prove a rope of sand;</L>
<L>But should this spinning of his head deceive him,</L>
<L>This hempen manufacture may relieve him!</L>
<L>Had I but time to give my fancy scope,</L>
<L>I'd shew, how <HI>tragedy</HI> was like a <HI>rope;</HI></L>
<L>How several parts well twisted, make a whole,</L>
<L>To curb the passions, and to melt the soul.</L>
<L>The cause of justice each alike befriends,</L>
<L>Both salutary means for moral ends;</L>
<L>Thus the most crabbed <HI>Critic</HI> plainly sees,</L>
<L>That making <HI>Ropes</HI> is writing <HI>Tragedies:</HI></L>
<L>And should he fail to please, poor scribbling els—</L>
<L>O—then he makes a rope to hang himself.</L>

<L>So furious are they to be free,</L>

<L>THIS night we add some heroes to our store,</L>

<L>Opposing sword to sword, and shield to shield;</L>
<L>With different instruments our troop appears;</L>
<L>Needles to thimbles shall, and sheers to sheers;</L>
<L>With parchment gorgets, and in buckram arm'd,</L>
<L>Cold-blooded taylors are to heroes warm'd,</L>
<L>And, slip-shod, slide to war.—No lyon's glare,</L>
<L>No eye-balls darting fire, shall make you stare:</L>
<L>Each outside shall belye the stuff within;</L>
<L>A Roman spirit in a taylor's skin:</L>
<L>A taylor-legg'd Cassius, Pompey, shall you see,</L>
<L>And the ninth part of Brutus strut in me!</L>

<L>Should female artists with the male combine,</L>
<L>And mantua-makers to the taylors join;</L>
<L>Should all, too proud to work, their trades give o'er,</L>

<SP>
<L>BOLD is the man, and <HI>compos mentis</HI> scarce,</L>
<L>Who, in these nicer times, dares write a farce;</L>
<L>A vulgar, long-forgotten taste renew;</L>
<L>All now are comedies, five acts or two.</L>
<L>Authors have ever, in a certain strain,</L>
<L>Begg'd mercy for the bantling of their brain:</L>
<L>That you, kind nurse, would fondle't on your lap,</L>
<L>And rear it with applause, that best of pap.</L>
<L>Thus babes have in their cradle 'scap'd a blow,</L>
<L>Tho' lame and ricketty from top to toe.</L>
<L>Our bard, with prologue out-works, has not fenc'd him,</L>
<L>For all that I shall say will make against him.</L>
<L><HI>Imprimis,</HI> this his piece—a farce we call it—</L>
<L><HI>Ergo</HI> 'tis low, and ten to one you maul it!</L>
<L>Would you, because 'tis low, no quarter give?</L>
<L>Blackguards, as well as gentlemen, should live.</L>

'Tis downright English too—nothing from France;</L>

<L>Nay, what is worse—you'll see it, and must know it—</L>
<L>I, Thomas King, of King-street, am the poet!</L>
<L>The murder's out, the murderer detected,</L>
<L>And, in one night, be try'd, condemn'd, dis∣sected.</L>
<L>'Tis said, for Scandal's tongue will never cease,</L>

<L>There's not one frown a single brow disgraces:</L>

<L>Suppose Old Nick, before you righteous folk,</L>

<L>ALL fable is figure—I your bard will maintain it,</L>

<L>Which frees the poor poet from care and vexa∣tion:</L>
<L>Should want make his mistress too keen to dis∣pute,</L>
<L>Your smiles fill his pockets—and madam is mute.</L>
<L>Should his wife, that's himself, for they two are but one;</L>
<L>Be in hell, that's in debt, and the money all gone;</L>
<L>Your favour brings comfort; at once cures the evil;</L>

<L>Nay, Cerberus critics their fury will drop:</L>
<L>For such barking monsters, your smiles are a sop.</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="18"/>
But now to explain what you most will require,</L>
<L>That cows, sheep, and calves, should dance after the lyre.</L>
<L>Without your kind favour, how scanty each meal!</L>
<L>But with it comes dancing, beef, mutton, and veal.</L>

<L>You may, but if you do, sir, I must tell ye,</L>

<L>Still he preach'd on—"Bards of a former age</L>
<L>" Held up abandon'd pictures on the stage,</L>
<L>" Spread out their wit, with fascinating art,</L>
<L>" And catch'd the fancy, to corrupt the heart;</L>
<L>" But, happy change!—in these more moral days,</L>

<L>CRITICKS, before you rise, one word, I pray;</L>
<L>You cannot to a female, sure, say nay!</L>

<L>And then to church with Master Hazard run:</L>
<L>Yes, run, I say, nay fly, my zeal to prove,</L>

<L>Love, a choice plant, once native of this soil,</L>
<L>Grew, spread, and blossom'd, without care or toil;</L>

'Twas thro' the land in such perfection kept,</L>

<L>Poor Love is fall'n, cast like a weed away!</L>
<L>I will revive the plant in spite of fashions;</L>
<L>The heart is dead without that best of passions:</L>
<L>Ay, but says Surly, (there I see him sit,</L>

<L>Sir, by your leave, your praise I wish to merit,</L>
<L>For stepping forth with more than female spirit!</L>
<L>Am I not brave, amid the tempest's roar,</L>
<L>To plunge, and bring a drowning man to shore?</L>
<L>But should the monster so ungrateful prove,</L>
<L>When I have sav'd, and warm'd him with my love,</L>
<L>To let his former sins his heart entice,</L>

<L>I'll strike a bargain, and I say <HI>done</HI> first;</L>
<L>As soon as e'er my wretched spouse is hears'd;</L>

<L>Believ'd in spirits and astrology!</L>
<L>'Twas by the stars they prosper'd, or miscarried;</L>
<L>Thro' them grew rich, or poor; were hang'd, or married;</L>
<L>And if their wives were naught, then they were born</L>
<L>Under the Ram, or Bull, or Capricorn!</L>

<L>Our faces never change, they tell no tales;</L>
<L>Or should a husband, rather unpolite,</L>
<L>Lock up our persons, and our roses blight;</L>
<L>When once set free again, there's nothing in it,</L>

<L>To walk when dark no belles now make a fuss,</L>
<L>No spectres or hobgoblins frighten us!</L>
<L>No, says Old Crab, of Fops the last editions,</L>
<L>Pray, madam, what are they but apparitions!</L>
<L>So slim, so pale, so dress'd from foot to head,</L>
<L>Half girl, half boy, half living and half dead,</L>
<L>They are not flesh and blood, but walking gin∣gerbread!</L>
<L>Mere flimsy beings kept alive by art,</L>
<L>" They come like shadows, and they so depart."</L>
<L>O fye, for shame! said I—he turn'd about,</L>

<L>HER age five months, four days and seventeen years,</L>
<L><HI>The Country Girl,</HI> this awful night appears:</L>

<L>And hopes to find some kindness among men:</L>
<L>Tho' in the shell, by some device or other,</L>
<L>We hope to rear her, and without her mother.</L>

<L>When first the linnet by the fowler caught,</L>
<L>From native woods, and fields to town is brought,</L>
<L>Unus'd to crowds, its bosom nimbly heaves;</L>
<L>In broken thrills the little songster grieves,</L>
<L>Till bolder grown the warbler swells its throat,</L>

<L>Where, Ladies, shall the flutt'rer find a nest?</L>

<L>Heal it, and let it once more chirp, and sing:</L>
<L>Yet to approach you were infatuation;</L>
<L>If souls like mine so prone to inflammation,</L>
<L>Shou'd meet your tinder hearts—there wou'd be conflagration!</L>
<L>Indeed so prudent are most men of fashion,</L>
<L>They run no danger, for they feel no passion:</L>
<L>Tho' fairest faces smile, they can defy 'em,</L>
<L>Tho' softest tongues shou'd plead, they can deny 'm,</L>
<L>Mankind wou'd cease, but for such loving Fools as I am;</L>

<L>I'd <HI>warm</HI> the one, and make the other <HI>cooler,</HI></L>

<L>PRAY let me see, if what France says be true,</L>
<L>That smiling faces in this land are few.</L>
<L>I'll tell you how they mark you to a tittle;</L>
<L>They say, you think too much, and talk too little;</L>
<L>While you with scorh, cry out against their prate,</L>
<L>And swear, with heels so light, their heads want weight.</L>
<L>Be but some clouds of politics blown o'er,</L>
<L>England would shew its laughing face once more.</L>
<L>For this good end, our bard throws in his mite,</L>

<L>And life's rough path make gay by strewing flowers.</L>
<L>Let but the fashion spread throughout our isle,</L>
<L>And what makes Frenchmen grin, will make you smile.</L>
<L>The drama, would like Alkalis, protect you</L>
<L>From those four humours, which so much affect you;</L>
<L>Sweeten your blood, with its swift current mix,</L>
<L>And cure the crudities of polities.</L>
<L>Our farce exhibits such a scene as thie—</L>

<L>The various servants at a country feet,</L>
<L>As <HI>actors</HI> furnish out the curious treat.</L>

<L>If smoak prevails, and the choak'd flame is dying,</L>
<L>Then gently fan it with some little sighing;</L>
<L>Then drop into the flame a tear or two,</L>
<L>And, blazing up like oil, 'twill burn him thro';</L>
<L>Then add kind looks, soft words, sweet smiles—no pout,</L>

<HEAD>SONG, sung by Mr. LOWE, at Drury-lane Theatre, 20th November, 1740<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the performance of the TEMPEST, for the Benefit of Captain Pedlie's Crew, who on this occasion came on the Stage, and returned thanks; the Prince of Wales, Father of his present Majesty, honoured the Theatre writh his attendance. Captain Peddie was Commander of the Prince of Orange, homeward bound from St. Christopher's. Oct. 23, after a tedi∣ous passage, about 30 leagues E. of Scilly, he was attacked by a Spanish Privateer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8 guns, as many swivels, and 150 Men. The Spaniards holsting English Colours, Capt. Peddie had no suspicion of him till he was close on board, when his adversary poured in a broadside upon him with all his small arms. Captain Peddie's guns being all wet below, he coud only return him his quarter deck guns and small arms; but clapping the helm hard a-weather, he had the courage to run him aboard on the quarter, which did him considerable damage. When the Spaniard got clear, he shot ahead and lay by a quarter of an hour, which gave the captain time to get ready for him; and on his bearing down again, a smart engagement ensued for about three hours and a half; when the Don bore away, and Captain Peddie after him; but finding he outsailed him, he clapped upon a wind, and continued his voyage with a favoura∣ble wind till he arrived in the Downs, October 30, having lost but four men and five wounded. After so brave a deliverance he was scarcely anchored, before, by a violent storm, his ship was driven a shore and lost; himself narrowly escaping, and five of his crew having perished with the cold. The gallant beha∣viour of this Gentleman, and his subsequent misfortunes, made a deep impression on the publick. On the 20th November 1740, CATO was acted at Covent Garden for his Benefit. His Majesty sent him 100 Guineas, the Dutchess of Marlbo∣rough 20, and Mr. Onslow, Speaker of the House of Com∣mons, with many of the Nobility, made him presents to the value of near 3000 pounds. Soon after he had given him the Command of the Basilisk Bomb. The above Song was written by Mr. Walmsley, the patron of Mr. Garrick, and the friend of Doctor Johnson, except the third Stanza, which was added by Mr. Garrick himself.</NOTE></HEAD>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Or, The POWER of RIOT:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN ODE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In honour of the 25th and 26th of January, and 24th February, 1763.</HEAD>
<P>I AM a theatrical politician, and can talk as learnedly in my field of politics as you, or any of your correspondents, can do in your's. I can remember the day when a Gray's-Inn Journalist, or a Herald, has mauled a manager weekly, as ably as the Monitor or the North Briton has lately attacked the Minister. Some of your po∣liticians allow Mr. Pitt to be a great man, but think he has been too fond of continental con∣nections. In like manner, I not only allow Garrick to be the greatest actor the world ever saw, but also am of opinion that he is an excel∣lent manager; and yet I must, as a true patriot, blame him for his encouragement of pantomime. Two Pantomimes in one winter, and the town had only sense enough to damn one. O tempora! O mores! but I shall conclude what I have to say at present, with taking notice, that the revo∣lutions of theatres are as extraordinary as those
<PB N="493" REF="270"/>
of states and republics; and tumults in king∣doms are scarce attended with greater confusion than riots at the Playhouse. On these occasions great patriots, theatrical and political, chiefly shew themselves. Hampden, who opposed ship∣money, is not more celebrated than Thady Fitz∣patrick, who demolished full price. The fol∣lowing poem is a parody on that celebrated ode of Dryden's, which that great orator, Mr. She∣ridan, has so often recited with uncommon ap∣plause at Spring-gardens, Pewterers-hall, Drury∣lane Theatre, Oxford, Cambridge, and Bath; and I most heartily wish, that it were in my power to prevail with that gentleman to employ his noble powers of elocution on the following parody.</P>

<L>'TWAS at the rabble rout, when Mima won</L>

<L>His noisy peers were plac'd around,</L>

<L>The blarneying Burky by his side,</L>
<L>In impudence and ignorance ally'd,</L>
<L>With brazen front was seen in riot's pride,</L>
<L>Shameless, shameless, shameless pair,</L>
<L>Well do your heads your hearts declare!</L>
<L>Our Garrick's voice on high</L>
<L>A while the rout confounds,</L>
<L>He runs with rapid skill thro' elocution's bounds:</L>
<L>The lofty sounds ascend the sky,</L>
<L>And in the sons of poetry</L>
<L>Celestial joys inspire!</L>
<L>From Shakespeare's self the lore he caught,</L>
<L>From him the glowing pow'r possest,</L>

<L>Jars, he sung, are toil and trouble,</L>
<L>Faction a misleading bubble,</L>
<L>Path to discontent and frenzy,</L>
<L>Fighting still, and still destroying,</L>

<L>Who check'd his plan,</L>
<L>And groan'd and hiss'd, and groan'd and hiss'd,</L>
<L>Groan'd and hiss'd, and groan'd again.</L>
<L>At length with fear and shame at once opprest,</L>
<L>Away the Gen'ral slunk, and left the rest.</L>

<LG>
<L>Lo! now the russians roar amain,</L>

<L>How they break the orchestral abodes,</L>
<L>How the instruments shatter by loads!</L>
<L>The ruffians applaud with a furious joy,</L>
<L>And a buck seiz'd a candle with zeal to destroy.</L>
<L>Burky led the way,</L>

<L>Could kindle manly rage, or melt with soft desire.</L>

<LG>
<L>At last enormous Fitzgig came,</L>

<L>AS late at Comus' Court I sat,</L>
<L>(Observe me well, I mean not that</L>
<L>Where ribaldry in triumph sits,</L>
<L>Delighting lords, and 'squires, and cits;</L>
<L>But there, where mirth and taste combine,</L>

<L>Suspended for a while the joke,</L>
<L>With rapture of your muse we spoke;</L>
<L>But all blam'd me, cry'd out, oh fye!</L>
<L>What, send to verse a prose reply?</L>
<L>My friend the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hale.</NOTE>Col'nel made th' attack,</L>
<L>And wicked Calvert clapp'd his back.</L>
<L>Nay, Pottinger, tho' low in feather,</L>

<L>What! send to Anstey such dull stuff?</L>
<L>'Twas modesty, dear Hale; don't huff.</L>
<L>Could I but rhyme as much as you,</L>

While independent Plummer cry'd,</L>
<L>He'd not vote plump on either side.</L>
<L>E'en Boon, who ne'er inclines to satire,</L>

<L>Could not but say there was some blame,</L>

<L>Our landlord shook his sides and shoulders,</L>

<L>For that to him is always best,</L>

<L>No baited bear was e'er so worry'd;</L>
<L>I took my hat, and home I hurry'd,</L>

<L>A monkey of the sprightly kind</L>
<L>Could mock and mimic half mankind:</L>
<L>Could twist him to a thousand shapes;</L>
<L>In short, a perfect jackanapes.</L>
<L>As once our mimic Pug display'd</L>
<L>His talents in the summer shade,</L>
<L>By chance a nightingale was there,</L>
<L>Well pleas'd the farce to see and hear.</L>
<L>His joy began his notes to raise;</L>
<L>He warbled forth the monkey's praise.</L>
<L><PB N="524" REF="301"/>
Pug, too much flatter'd, thought it wrong,</L>
<L>Not to return his thanks in song;</L>
<L>And such a fit of squalling took him,</L>
<L>Beasts, birds, and nightingale forsook him.</L>
<L>An owl, who in a hole was dreaming,</L>
<L>Was rais'd at once with all this screaming;</L>
<L>Who-o-hoo! hoo! neighbour, curse your clatter!</L>
<L>Zounds! are you murder'd? what's the matter?</L>
<L>The monkey to his senses brought,</L>
<L>And must'ring what he had of thought,</L>
<L>Told to the owl his silly tale,</L>
<L>How he had scar'd the nightingale.</L>
<L>Grave Madge began to roll her eyes,</L>
<L>And being what she seem'd, most wise,</L>
<L>Thus spoke—Thou empty-headed thing,</L>
<L>Skip, grin, and chatter—never sing,</L>
<L>Would you, without a voice or ear,</L>
<L>Tune up, when Philomel is near?</L>
<L>Nature her pleasure has made known,</L>
<L>That nightingales should sing alone.</L>

<LG>
<L>GARRICK, I've read your Fools' Petition,</L>
<L>And thank you for the composition;</L>
<L>Tho' few will credit all you say,</L>
<L>Yet, 'tis a friendly part you play;</L>
<L>A part which you perform with ease,</L>
<L>Whate'er you act is sure to please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But give me leave, on this occasion,</L>
<L>To make one little observation:</L>
<L>Though no good reason is assign'd,</L>
<L>At least not any I can find,</L>
<L>Why I should be deaf, dumb, or blind;</L>
<L>Yet since it was resolv'd above,</L>
<L>By this same fool-obeying JOVE,</L>
<L>I must not speak, or hear, or see,</L>
<L>Surely to soften the decree,</L>
<L>He might have left the choice to me.</L>
<L>Were that the case, I would dispense</L>
<L>With sight, and wit, and eloquence,</L>
<L>Still to retain my fav'rite sense;</L>
<L>For grant, my friend, we would admit</L>
<L>What some may doubt, that I have wit;</L>
<L>What are the mighty pow'rs of speech,</L>
<L>What useful purpose do they reach?</L>
<L>When vain and impotent you see,</L>
<L>Ev'n down from Socrates to me,</L>
<L>All the bons-mots that e'er were said</L>
<L>To mend the heart, or clear the head;</L>
<L>Fools will be fools, say what we will,</L>
<L>And rascals will be rascals still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="531" REF="308"/>
<L>But rather I your case would be in,</L>
<L>Say you, than lose the pow'r of seeing?</L>
<L>The face of nature you will say</L>
<L>Is ever chearful, ever gay,</L>
<L>And beauty, parent of delight,</L>
<L>Must always charm the ravish'd sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This choice perhaps I might commend,</L>
<L>But here, you have forgot my friend,</L>
<L>That nature's face, and beauty's heav'n,</L>
<L>Lose all their charms at seventy-seven;</L>
<L>The brightest scenes repeated o'er,</L>
<L>As well you know, will please no more;</L>
<L>The prospect's darken'd o'er with age,</L>
<L>The drama can no more engage,</L>
<L>We wish, with you, to quit the stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short, it is a point I'm clear in,</L>
<L>The best of senses is, our hearing:</L>
<L>Happy who keeps it still, and he</L>
<L>Who wants must mourn the loss like me;</L>
<L>For though I little should regret</L>
<L>The table's roar where fools are met,</L>
<L>The flatt'ring tribe who sing or say</L>
<L>The lies or tattle of the day;</L>
<L>Still have I cause for discontent,</L>
<L>Still lose what most I must lament,</L>
<L>The converse of a chosen few,</L>
<L>The luxury of—hearing you.</L>

<L>A copious stream thro' banks of slow'rs;</L>
<L>When Barrè stern, with accents deep,</L>
<L>Calls up Lord North, and murders sleep;</L>
<L>And if his Lordship rise to speak,</L>
<L>Then wit and argument awake.</L>
<L>When Rigby speaks, and all may hear him,</L>
<L>Who can withstand, <HI>ridendo verum?</HI></L>
<L>When Thurlow's words attention bind,</L>
<L>The spell's of a superior mind.</L>
<L>Now, whether I were whig or tory,</L>
<L>This was a time for me to glory:</L>
<L><PB N="539" REF="316"/>
My glory farther still extends,</L>
<L>For most of these I call my friends.</L>
<L>But if, 'Squire B—n, you were hurt,</L>
<L>To see me as you thought so pert,</L>
<L>You might have punish'd my transgression,</L>
<L>And damp'd the ardour of expression.</L>
<L>A brute there is, whose voice confounds,</L>
<L>And frights all others with strange sounds;</L>
<L>Had you, your matchless powers displaying,</L>
<L>Like him, 'Squire B—n, sat a braying,</L>
<L>I should have lost all exultation,</L>
<L>Nor gloried in my situation.</L>
