<HEAD><HI>PROLOGUE.</HI> Spoken by Mr. MURRAY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE time hath been, but in a barbarous age,</L>
<L>When poets brav'd their audience from the stage,</L>
<L>Poets pontifical, whose lofty tone</L>
<L>Acknowledg'd no tribunal but their own,</L>
<L>And sent their Prologue-purveyor to raise</L>
<L>First fruits and fines of tributary praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our modern bards are taught an humbler strain,</L>
<L>And, if less valiant, are not half so vain;</L>
<L>No longer aim the nation's taste to lead,</L>
<L>Content if they can follow and succeed.</L>
<L>Thus if the time should come, when in the place</L>
<L>Of Nature you shou'd substitute grimace,</L>
<L>(Fatal reverse!) What cou'd the Poet do?</L>
<L>Offend the many to appease the few?</L>
<L>No, if in Greece true taste had been as scarce,</L>
<L>The Stagyrite himself had stood for farce.</L>
<L>If wit thro' five long acts will not hold out,</L>
<L>Momus must help to stir the laugh about,</L>
<L>And when you crown his mummery with applause,</L>
<L>You bribe him to transgress the drama's laws.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He were a very wild romantic elf,</L>
<L>Who only wrote to figure on the shelf;</L>
<L>To hear his own sad sentiments rebound</L>
<L>Thro' empty galleries with a dying sound,</L>
<L>And sit like Seneca in calm decay,</L>
<L>Watching how life steals drop by drop away:</L>
<L>No, let him take his profit and his ease,</L>
<L>And trifle on so long as trifles please:</L>
<L>Too weak to struggle against fashion's tide,</L>
<L>If with the current he's content to glide,</L>
<L>He only yields as Caesar did before,</L>
<L>When Tiber's torrent drove him from the shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The simple tale we have to tell this night,</L>
<L>Shews truth triumphant over ranc'rous spite,</L>
<L>Casts in dark shades the base defamer's part,</L>
<L>And crowns with just reward the liberal heart.</L>
<L>Oh might our efforts gain their wisht for end,</L>
<L>The gay to' amuse, the faulty to amend,</L>
<L>Make fiction rule her thoughts by nature's laws,</L>
<L>And wit exert her powers in virtue's cause,</L>
<L>Then and then only might we claim applause.</L>

<P>AHA! very good, very good.

<P>Hav'n't you nam'd his name to Lady

Cypress? I doubt you have, Jerry, oftener than you ought, and in a way you shou'd be asham'd of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only said what lawyer Earling said—al∣ways had the law o' my side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>On which side was truth? on which side was gratitude? Recollect yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shou'd I recollect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you.—Your adventure at Barn∣stable races, when in the pride of your heart you must shew off in your new gig forsooth; and where wou'd you have been now if the very man you have defam'd hadn't sav'd your life at the peril of his own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, he did—I don't deny it. Tit run restive—tipt me over a wheelbarrow—tumbled un∣der his heels—might have been kick'd to atoms— surgeon's work as it was—snapt my arm—well it was not my neck—much obliged to Harry Alger∣non—never spoke against him since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak for him, man; 'tisn't enough you do not speak against him: liberate your conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jenny, Jenny, liberate my conscience, as you call it, and I shall liberate my customers; if Harry Algernon will be a rantipole; if his women and his wine, his racing and his revelling, have cross'd him out of the old lady's books, how am I to blame?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, 'tisn't your business to set the worst side of his character to view; you have be∣nefited by his courage and humanity—why don't you talk of them, and hold your tongue about his frailties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>My tongue can do nobody any harm.
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
I tell you it is all up with him: lawyer Earling has done his business. If ever he enters my lady's doors, or touches a shilling of her fortune while he breathes, set me down for a fool and a false prophet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose he does not aim at touching a shilling of her fortune; suppose he only wants— but here he comes, and will tell you what he wants.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Jerry, my worthy fellow, give me your hand, give me your help.—No, no, that's not the point at present—take your fingers off my pulse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very high, let me tell you—very full— gallops at a furious rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Expectation raises it, hope quickens it; love is my disease; and if you don't stand my friend, disappointment will be my death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love! Can't cure love—troubled enough to cure the consequences of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark ye, Jerry, you are an intimate of Lady Cypress; I, though her nearest of kin, am an exile. Within her castle lives the idol of my soul, Emily Fitzallan; obtain for me an interview with her, and though you can't cure love, you may rescue me from death, and then you may fairly boast of having sav'd one man's life by your practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't do't—not possible—fair Emily never goes out of the castle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore it is I want to go into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hopeless case—not upon the chances— Old Lady won't bear to look upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll excuse her if I may but look upon the young one: manage that for me, my good fellow.—
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
Nobody knows me; nobody can find me out; I'm a stranger to the whole family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you are likely to remain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Jerry, cast about; be good natur'd, and contrive some errand or pretence to introduce him. If there is a little danger, surely you may risque it for the preserver of your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Foolish scheme, jewel Jenny, foolish scheme.—Won't do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no medicines to send in? Can't I personate your pestle and mortar-man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not you; I keep no such pestle and mor∣tar-man in my shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you keep a heart in your body, and a memory in your brains, therefore you must stand for me as I have stood for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! here comes Simon Single, the keeper of the castle. Leave me with him, and I warrant I have a key to his castle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Angel of my hope, into your hands I com∣mit my cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, leave your cause, and quit your company.</P>

<STAGE>SIMON SINGLE, JENNY SCUD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome, welcome, my good friend!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Glad to see you, pretty Mrs. Jane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you are taking your rounds this fair morning, Mr. Simon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better take them than Jerry's doses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>So wou'd not they perhaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how are all cronies at the castle? How does the venerable virgin Mrs. Buckram,
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
pretty Rachel Williams, and the rest of the fair nuns?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name 'em not; you have not left your fellow. What is Rachel Williams? a baby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Mrs. Buckram—she is no baby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, o' my word; she is of the race of the Anakims.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that, friend Simon; you'll marry Buckram.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, that buckram shall never stick in my skirts. Harapha of Gath wou'dn't marry her. I am no knight-errant to encounter giants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd think so; for if you were a true knight, you wou'd not sleep before you had set free your lovely prisoner, Emily Fitzallan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's one a-coming will do that. Fair Emily will be a wife before you'll be a widow. Young Montrath is the man for her; he's expected every day with his uncle Sir Oliver. It is all agreed upon, and my lady's whole fortune will be settled on Miss Emily. There's a start for you—there's a sally from dependance to prosperity; from wanting every thing to possessing all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And nothing left to Harry Algernon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, patience if he possesses it, and an ill-name whether he merits it or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I can't see the justice of all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who can, where lawyer Earling is con∣cerned? That puppy of an attorney lords it over the whole castle; and now we are in the bustle of setting out Miss Emily in a stile before Sir Oliver arrives. There are fine dresses to be made, fine
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
apartments to be furnished, and fresh servants to be hir'd for the heiress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so? fresh servants? Are you full? If not, I can recommend you such a lacquey—the very man of men—Jerry shall bring him to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bring him yourself; lead him over in a white bridle, and let me judge of his points and his paces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall—my life for your's, Miss Emily will be charm'd with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adieu! time flies when I am with you. Once more, adieu! I shall expect you. I hope you are happy with your little doctor; but I must think you were much too fine a flower to be pluckt by an apothecary, and stuck into a gallipot.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's off; you may come out of your hiding hole; the coast is clear.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ALGERNON, <HI>followed by</HI> SCUD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, my fair advocate, what have you done for me? Is there any hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of the old lady's fortune, none; your aunt has not left you a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder why.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Emily is to have the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder wherefore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you then. Had my aunt bequeath'd to me her fortune, she wou'd have probably re∣stricted me from marrying Emily; having given it to Emily, she has doubtless tied her up from marrying me. Had she done neither one nor the other, I have enough to maintain her, and the prize had been my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she shall; I've a project for your meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt if I ought to seek it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; lay it aside altogether; it will bring a plaguy deal of mischief upon me, and do no good to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell it me however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll comprehend it at once. There is a proper valet to be hir'd for the heiress, fit to wait upon her person, and grace the back of her chair at table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't do it; I am not equal to the task; I can't approach so near, and yet refrain. When she spoke to me, I shou'd be lost; when she look'd on me, I shou'd betray myself; and when I hand∣ed her the plate, I should present it on my knee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, then you wou'd be vollied out of the window, and I kick'd out of the doors. Now, silly Jenny, what's become of your project?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold there! tho' dangerous in the extreme it is not altogether desperate. If I cannot under∣take the offices you describe, I may yet present myself as a candidate for her service; and in that character perhaps obtain an interview with my charmer. That hope is worth an effort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>It isn't worth a farthing, and will be pounds and pounds out of my way. Cursed scrape, foolish Jenny, cursed scrape!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where shall I get a proper dress to ap∣pear in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>No where; you can't appear at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing; I'll provide you with a dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, she has a provision for every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who but must conquer that is armed by the fair? There is a rascal in the family, Earling by name, who has slanderously defam'd me; I'll wring his ears from his head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care; Earling is an attorney, and if he has any ears you will pay for wringing them; if he has none, you'll be puzzled to lay hold of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Jerry, I see what staggers you; you are afraid of losing the old lady's custom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; I am. She takes physic, and you take pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mark me! I'll not promise you to swallow as many medicines as she does; but, come what will, I'll guarantee you against all losses incurr'd on my account; so fear nothing, but come on. Discretion I can't boast of, but in honour I will never be found wanting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scud.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's enough, that's enough! Deal upon honour and I am with you. I love to do a good natur'd action when there's nothing to be lost by it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enter, enter, Mr. Earling: you come upon a wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ever prompt to approve myself your lady∣ship's most devoted and most absolute humble servant, upon a wish I come, upon a word I vanish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied with your diligence; you may spare yourself the trouble of describing it.</P>

<P>I am dumb.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you the memorandums about you, that I dictated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my tears have not defac'd them. Be∣lieve me, gracious lady, when I saw my own name set down to a bequest so munificent, I was cover'd with blushes, I was choak'd with gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out with it then, out with your name, if such is the effect, and write in Algernon's; I warrant gratitude will not choak him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good, very good! Your ladyship has the gift of rallying me in the most pleasant way out of my metaphors. Choak is a figure somewhat of the strongest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, and I shou'd think you may venture upon the legacy, and risque the effects of it; so copy out your paper when you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll set my clerks upon it out of hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll set the world upon it when I'm out of it, for you have totally cashier'd Harry Algernon, and he is the son of my sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your sister was the wife of his father, and his father was your unremitting persecutor, who vex'd you with a suit in chancery for ten long years, and ten might have been added to ten, had it not been that I—I speak modestly of myself; I am no egotist—I speak simply of number one, and nobody else, for your barrister was a cypher—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a cypher put to number one adds no trifle to its value; so the upshot is, you gain'd the suit, and I paid the costs—a victory little to be envied—and, after all, is it just and equitable the son should suffer for the father's faults?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>O jus et aequum! as if he had not faults enough of his own to warrant your exclusion of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard enough of his faults I confess, if you are correct in describing them. If you have deceiv'd me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Earl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I! I deceive you! I defame your nephew! I who have never spoke of his offences but with regret and sorrow; never brought a story to your ears, but with the view of intercepting malice and softening down impressions; I deceive you! then where is truth and virtue?</P>

<P>Approach, my dear! Come near me. I must talk with you. Well! You have been to see the apartment I have newly furnished—and do you like it, Emily?</P>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis elegant in the extreme—'tis sump∣tuous.</P>

<P>'Tis your's, my dear; it is to grace my Emily that I have deck'd it out.</P>

<P>For me such finery?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child of my heart, for you. All I possess is your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will not tempt me to forget that I was poor and humble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not: nature has endow'd you with admirable qualities; prosperity, I trust, will not pervert them. It does not quite come on you by surprize: you cou'd not well suppose I shou'd adopt the son of my most unrelenting persecutor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not dare to reason in that case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must know how worthless in himself, how undeserving of my favour is he, who, in respect of consanguinity, is the only person that cou'd supersede you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak of Mr. Algernon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; I speak of him, whom no one speaks of but with reproach and scorn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do confess I've heard much evil speak∣ing, but 'twas from one who shou'd have more respect for truth and decency than to traduce the nephew to the aunt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? Wou'd you defend a libertine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam, I defend no libertine; but you will not be angry if I avow that I detest a li∣beller. If he, who thus has poison'd your opinion, knows not the character, the manners, habits, sen∣timents, connections, perhaps not even the out∣ward form and feature of the man, whose fame he mangles, can I be to blame if I implore you, for the love of justice, to hear before you strike?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is this, Emily? What is this warmth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honest, not prudent; out of time and place, but still sincere, tho' rash.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>You call on me to hear before I strike; I now demand if you that strike have heard?
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
Do you know Algernon? Have you convers'd with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have! when, where? he comes not hither; never was admitted, never will be, within these doors. Astonishing that you shou'd dare to tell me you have made acquaintance with this profligate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear my defence.—You gave me leave to pass a little time, for change of air after my late confinement, at your Hill-farm. One evening I had rambled about a mile from home, when upon entering a little copse, thro' which my footpath led, judge of my horror, when a villain, such I must call him, surpriz'd me, seiz'd me, and in spite of cries, prayers and entreaties—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful providence! what do you tell me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>A dreadful tale I shou'd have had to tell, or died ere I cou'd tell it, had not heaven sent me a rescue, a brave brave preserver, who with a soul all fire, and motion quick as lightning, sprung on the assailant, grasp'd him in his arms, and after a contention, furious tho' short, hurl'd him to the ground, breathless, and maim'd with bruises.— Which of these merits the name of <HI>profligate?</HI> Not be that sav'd me—It was Algernon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Algernon do you say? My worthless nephew Algernon! Take care!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Renounce me if I tell you an untruth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm all astonishment. Who was the assailant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I know not. Your heroic
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
nephew bore me half dead and fainting to my house; 'twas not till then I knew him to be Alger∣non. He staid with me no longer than till the care of the good people had recovered me: the next morning I return'd to the castle, fearing to remain any longer in so solitary a place. Of Algernon, I saw no more. Now suffer me to ask, is this the conduct of a profligate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a strange story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a true one, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why have you kept it to yourself thus long? You've been return'd two days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because until this hour I have not seen your spirits in a state to bear the slightest agitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think the agitation slight that I now suffer? No, I see your danger, Emily; I see your weak credulity, and much I fear you'll find yourself the dupe of Algernon. What business cou'd he have at my Hill-farm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, your tenant's wife nurs'd Mr. Algernon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>She never shou'd have nurs'd you, Emily, or harbour'd you one moment, had I known it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's hard; but I must suffer and be silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be silent then, and go to your cham∣ber; there you may meditate on what you have been, and call to mind, with timely recollection, what you may be again.</P>

<P>I pray you now, Master Simon Single, be kind-hearted, and consider of it. I shou'd be main proud to have him in my lady's livery; he's a docile lad, and can turn his hand, as I may say, to any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Simon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him turn it to the plough; he's a bumpkin: let him drive the team and dung the land; he's born to it: let him ring the hogs, and tend the stye, and toil in the drudgery of his voca∣tion. Nature never fashion'd him to be the lac∣quey of a lady—You are answer'd, farmer Gaw∣dry.</P>

<P>Good morning to me indeed! How long, I trow, have you been this great man, to carry your∣self in your geers so stately? I can call to mind the day when you came into this family as mere a bump∣kin as you think my boy to be.</P>

<P>I won't comfort her; I won't present your humble service to her; I don't find you are so willing to do her any service, and as for humble, it don't belong to you—but mark my words—time is at hand—county election's coming on—ask me for a plumper then, do; ask me, I say, for a plumper

<P>Madam, it was.</P>

<P>And what have you to impart, that one, who possibly may be your fellow servant, might not be privy to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I am a gentleman by birth; that being known amongst my fellow servants might chance to raise an evil mind against me, and make my humble station painful to me; your candour will not think the worse of me because I am un∣fortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not the worse in charity of thought, but I cannot employ you in my service. No gentleman must wait upon that lady, to whom I else perhaps had destin'd you. —No gentleman at least of your appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry for it—but it is my fate to be judg'd by appearances, and condemn'd by reports.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you have fallen into this decay by mere misfortune, or injurious treatment, I can pity you; nay, Henry Scudamore, if that's your name, and if I knew your story (which at present I have not time to hear) I cou'd do more—I cou'd (and something whispers me I wou'd) consider your ne∣cessities, and help you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the victim, madam, of a villain. My story is soon told, for it is founded on a simple fact, which I can make appear to full conviction, if you will condescend to give me hearing, and suffer me to state such evidence, as cannot be oppos'd by my defamer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to say to that, young man; I have no strength to spare for other's bur∣thens, and am already loaded with my own, even to the breaking down of my weak frame. If 'tis a case of pity, I've a hand that's open to your wants without enquiry; if it is matter of grievance and re∣dress, I wou'd recommend you to state it to my lawyer, Mr. Earling, and he shall see you righted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I humbly thank you; I will state it to him, and trust the goodness of your heart will see me righted.</P>

<P>Madam! what are your commands?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't answer me in that stile. I have so long been a dependant, and liv'd in such fami∣liarity with you, my good Rachel, in particular, that, tho' you are my servant, I don't wish you to use a language to me so submissive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Whatever language you wou'd have me use, so it will but convey the same respect, I will en∣deavour to conform to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd fain keep upon such terms with fortune, that I may fall back to my former poverty without a pang; therefore, if ever you perceive me giddy with prosperity, recal my recollection to the low situation I emerg'd from, and do it honestly, my girl; don't spare me.</P>

<P>You'll want no monitor to warn you against pride, and yet, as you require sincerity, there is one warning I conceive is needful just at this crisis.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rachel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your champion Algernon, has he not left a thorn in that soft heart?</P>
</SP>

<P>If you call gratitude a thorn, he has.</P>

<P>Prudence will tell you how.</P>

<P>Prudence will tell me an old gossip's tale, but who, that is in love, will hear her out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rachel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you aware how fatal it will be to all your expectations, if my lady discovers your at∣tachment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you aware how natural it is to love the man who saves you from destruction? My lady gives me riches, Algernon rescues my life and ho∣nour; I was lost but for his courage; I am only poor without her bounty; and if she demands that I shou'd sacrifice my heart's affections, she makes conditions that I cannot grant, nor wou'd her for∣tune bribe me to the attempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rachel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know Mr. Algernon's character?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he that blackens it? What does my lady know but what that lawyer instils into her ear? Infamous man! And why does he defame him? why, but because he may retain his power in the estate, and garbel it at pleasure? Besides, he has an ample legacy; believe me, I hold it a disgrace to read my name in the same page with his; nor wou'd I be his partner in the crime of plundering
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
Algernon, but that I live in hopes the time will come when I may render back the unlawful spoil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then temporize the whilst, my dearest lady, or that time never will be your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis right; you counsel well; and now I will confide a secret to you: I have warn'd Alger∣non who is his enemy, and what base stories have been forg'd against him.—Ah! who is this? 'Tis he, 'tis he himself!</P>

<SPEAKER>Alg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let her stay; I wou'd not be surpriz'd in private with you. I am here by sufferance of Lady Cypress; I have seen my aunt for the first time, convers'd with her, and lodg'd a plea for fur∣ther hearing when her friend, Sir Oliver Montrath, shall be at leisure: one of his servants is already come; he may be soon expected.</P>

<P>I am not so romantic as to think I can main∣tain my post longer than till to-morrow, to which time I have a furlough by authority; if fortune stands my friend I may effect something within that period; but even now am I not supremely blest to see you, hear you, and behold that face, that was of late so pale and wan with terror, restor'd to all the lustre of its charms?</P>

<P>Not so, not altogether so, thank heaven!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, years indeed—but you have fill'd them up with glory; your's has been a life of themes for future history, a field of laurels to adorn your tomb—mine has been tame and simple vege∣tation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have liv'd a soldier's life; but, heaven
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
be thank'd, I've plunder'd no nabob, stript no rajah of his pearls and pagodas, nor have I any blood upon my sword, but what a soldier's honour may avow—but you have here a relict of my gal∣lant comrade major Antony Fitzallan. He was wounded by my side, carried off the field, and died in my arms. With his last breath he bequeath'd ('twas all he had to bestow) a blessing to his daugh∣ter, and charg'd me, if I liv'd to come to England, to thank you for your charity, and be a friend to her.</P>

<P>I trust you'll find her worthy of your friendship.</P>

<P>If such is your disinterested wish (and greater happiness I could not pray for) I trust my fortune thrown into her scale will not make her ap∣pear less worthy of your nephew, or cause you to retract your good opinion.</P>

<P>Horrible wretch!—his murderer.—</P>

<P>Away with all such honour! Truth disavows it, nature revolts from it, religion de∣nounces it—Oh! he is born to be my shame and torment.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient for a while; suspend your judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I regard a duellist with horror; I hold him as an agent of the enemy of mankind, sent to disturb society, and rend the parent's and the widow's hearts asunder: one action, one only action, and that a doubtful one, had met my ear in favour of that wretch whom I call nephew, and henceforth even that one I totally discredit, and renounce him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, I conjure you. In the midst of wrath let us remember justice. I, like you, abhor a duellist profest; yet I am taught by long expe∣rience how to make allowances for younger spirits, and warmer passions, that will not submit to meet the world's contempt, and scorn its prejudices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away! you talk this language by profession; reason declares against it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reason demands that we should pause
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
in judgment. When two men draw their swords upon each other, reason will tell us one must be to blame; but ere we six the blame upon that one, justice decrees that we should hear them both.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Cyp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What says your nephew? He will speak the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should expect he would; yet I'll not wholly trust to any man's report against another in his own cause; and in this sentiment my nephew honourably coincides, for he declines all answer to my questions, and will state nothing to affect or criminate his antagonist—Hah! who is this?</P>

<P>Ah! that was then the only way I had to reinstate you in your property; and, tho' it cost a blush to say those words, still I could say them, for I scorn'd to rob you—but to repeat them now wou'd be—Oh heaven!—it would be every thing but false, my Henry.</P>

<P>No; for so far from thinking with my lady, that you have chosen ill, I think with you that you could no where make a better choice—And more than this—was your brave father living, and knew what I know of your Algernon, he would ap∣prove your judgment.</P>

<P>As I am sure you would not give that name but to a sacred truth, what you have said sanctions the character of Algernon—but does it warrant me in suffering him to make a sacrifice of interest by marrying a beggar?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You point the question wrong, and should have ask'd if it exculpates me, your father's friend, for suffering you to call yourself a beggar.— No, my dear child, it does not, nor will I permit it to be said, the daughter of the generous Fitzallan, who in the battle found me faint with wounds, and whilst he cover'd me receiv'd his death, wanted that dross which I abounded in.—This, Emily, this never should be said; so come with me, and don't oppose one word to my resolves; for in an act of honour I will pause at no man's bidding, no, my pretty one, nor yet at any woman's, tho' grac'd with all the charms that heaven can give her.</P>

Despairing of ad∣mission to your presence, and driven in self-defence on this resource, I took a counterfeited character, and saw what I had never been allow'd to approach— your person. Much I wish'd to speak in mitiga∣tion of your prejudice, and give a plain recital of my wrongs; but you had then no ear for such dis∣course, and I was told to wait your better leisure.</P>

<P>A friend here present told me I was accus'd to you of various crimes and gross enormities. I plead to failings, to the common errors and indis∣cretions youth is subject to, but, I trust, I have never degraded my character or debas'd my prin∣ciple; I am no gamester, as he makes me to be; no dissipater of my paternal fortune, as he insinu∣ates; no libertine, as he asserts; and, let me add, in the hearing of Sir Oliver Montrath, I am no assassin.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is now my duty, and a painful one I feel it, to bring to light, in vindication of an in∣jur'd character, the guilty person, for whose shame∣ful act no better palliation can be found than tem∣porary madness and intoxication. The monster, from whose brutal violence the purest of heaven's creatures was preserv'd by Algernon, how shall I speak it without shame and horror! was Lionel Montrath.</P>

<L>Rigour, when just, he can, he will endure,</L>
<L>The stream is bitter, but the spring is pure;</L>
<L>Candor, when candor haply he can meet,</L>

<L>He writes, and ever to some moral end,</L>

<L>Youth's yielding clay too easily receives</L>

<L>With which the Lady Cypress clos'd her part;</L>
<L>For base seduction spreads on every side</L>
<L>His treach'rous snares to mesh th' unwary bride.</L>
<L>She, in whose eyes enticing Cupids play,</L>
<L>Gives impudence the clue, and leads the way.</L>
<L>What tho' the faithless husband quits her hand,</L>
<L>Truth, like a column, of itself can stand:</L>
<L>To reas'ning minds sufficient strength is giv'n,</L>
<L>And none but fools can charge their faults on heav'n.</L>
