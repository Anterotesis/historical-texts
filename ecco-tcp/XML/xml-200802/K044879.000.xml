<LG>
<L>IN classic times, as learned authors say,</L>
<L>When <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> wits produc'd a play,</L>
<L>The herald <HI>Prologue,</HI> 'ere the sports began,</L>
<L>Fairly stept forward, and announc'd the plan:</L>
<L>In few plain words he ran the fable through,</L>
<L>And, without favour, publish'd all he knew.</L>
<L>An honest custom: for the plan was clear,</L>
<L>The scene was simple, and the Muse sincere;</L>
<L>No tawdry fashions warp'd the public taste,</L>
<L>The times were candid, and the stage was chaste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can we expect, in these enlighten'd days,</L>
<L>A courtly age should hold such vulgar ways?</L>
<L>Or that a blabbing prologue should disclose</L>
<L>Scenes, which no Muse of fashion ever shows.</L>
<L>No, Sirs,<HI>—Sethona is the lady's name—</HI></L>
<L><HI>She lives at Memphis—of unsullied fame:</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Tyrant woo'd her—but she lik'd another,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And once 'twas fear'd her lover was her brother.</HI></L>
<L>As for the rest, a little patience borrow,</L>
<L>The <HI>Chronicle</HI> will tell you all to-morrow.</L>
<L>Authors are now so over modest grown,</L>
<L>They publish all men's writings, but their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let no living bard conceive offence,</L>
<L>Nor take the general in a partial sense.</L>
<L>Peace to all such! the lab'ring bee must feed</L>
<L>From flow'r to flow'r; perchance from weed to weed;</L>
<L>And should the comb unwelcome flavour yield,</L>
<L>The fault's not in the fabric, but the field;</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
The critic wasp, mean while upon the wing,</L>
<L>(An insect fraught with nothing but a sting)</L>
<L>Disturbs th' inaustrious hive, for malice sake,</L>
<L>Marring that honey, which he cannot make.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An absent bard, engag'd in distant war,</L>
<L>This night appears by proxy at your bar:</L>
<L>As o'er Arabia's wilds he took his way,</L>
<L>From sultry Ormus and the realms of day,</L>
<L>His active mind, superior to its toil,</L>
<L>Struck out these scenes upon the burning soil.</L>
<L>No cooling grottoes, no umbrageous groves,</L>
<L>To win the Graces, and allure the Loves;</L>
<L>No Heliconian fount wherein to dip,</L>
<L>And slake the burning fever on his lip;</L>
<L>Before him all is desart, waste, and dry,</L>
<L>Above him flames the tyrant of the sky;</L>
<L>Around his temples gath'ring whirlwinds fight,</L>
<L>And drifts of scorching dust involve the light:</L>
<L>Oh, snatch your Poet from impending death,</L>
<L>And on his shrine we'll hang his votive wreath.</L>

Some <HI>Cits</HI> I see look dull, and some look gay,</L>

<L>What <HI>Mercury</HI> they have, is <HI>high</HI> or <HI>low.</HI></L>

<L>Ye <HI>Youths</HI> of fashion, and of family!</L>
<L>What are we not to hope from taste, and rank?</L>
<L>All prizes in this lottery?—Blank—blank—blank—</L>
<L>Now for the <HI>Ladies</HI>—I no lines can spy</L>
<L>To tell their fortunes—and I'll tell you why;</L>
<L>Those fine-drawn lines, which would their fate displey,</L>
<L>Are, by the hand of <HI>fashion,</HI> brush'd away;</L>
<L>Pity it is, on beauty's fairest spot,</L>
<L>Where <HI>nature</HI> writes her best, they make a blot!—</L>
<L>I'd tell our <HI>Author's</HI> fortune, but his face,</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>COLONEL DOW, when he sailed for India, left the following Tragedy in the possession of Mr. GARRICK. The event has shewn, that the reputation of an absent author could not have been trusted in safer hands. He spared no expence as a manager, no pains as a man of taste. The Scenery is strictly characteristical, and highly picturesque. The Dresses are magnificent and expensive, the Parts cast with great judgement; and the whole conducted with that regularity and ease, which can only be attained by a thorough knowledge of the Drama, and the business of the Stage. Mrs. BARRY, possessed of every power to touch, to penetrate, to dis∣solve the heart, exerted them in a degree that astonished while it pleased the audience. Mr. BARRY was judicious, chaste, and pa∣thetic in Seraphis. Mr. REDDISH, spirited, and full of fire, in Menes. In their respec∣tive parts, the two AICKINS deserved and received great applause. Ample justice was done by Mr. PACKER, and others, to the rest of the characters. The public, and the author, are indebted to Mr. CUMBERLAND, for an elegant and classical Prologue: And to Mr. GARRICK, for one of the best Epi∣logues that ever was pronounced from the stage.</P>

<L>Thou sacred prophet! whose enlighten'd mind</L>

<L>What have the gods decreed? Am I condemn'd</L>
<L>To wed my father's murderer? The man</L>
<L>Who tore my destin'd husband from my arms,</L>
<L>Ev'n at the altar e'er the rites began,</L>
<L>And left me thus to sorrow, to despair.</L>

<SPEAKER>ORUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Daughter of grief! Sethona! every hour</L>
<L>Changes the state of things. To day the sea,</L>
<L>Rous'd by the Northern wind, assails the sky,</L>
<L>And wears the face of ruin. E'er the morn</L>
<L>Unveils her eyes, it smooths its ruffl'd brow,</L>
<L>And holds a mirrour to the stars of heav'n.</L>

<SPEAKER>SETHONA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Orus, I owe this emblem of my fate</L>
<L>To thy humanity. What ray of joy,</L>

<L>Ha! what events?</L>
<L>The dimest shade of hope, in grief like mine,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>As I stood</L>
<L>Before the altar of Ammonian Jove,</L>
<L>In fervent meditation, I beheld</L>
<L>The tow'rs of Memphis tottering, and the Nile</L>
<L>Rushing thro' all her gates. I heard a sound,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
As when the winds, contending in their caves,</L>
<L>Disturb the mountains; saw the shadowy lines</L>
<L>Of banner'd armies closing in the air.</L>
<L>Streaming with blood, a headless trunk appear'd,</L>
<L>Grasping a scepter. O'er him strode in steel</L>
<L>The warlike form of Menes. Last uprose,</L>
<L>Dim thro' the gleam of arms, a hoary head</L>
<L>Encircled with a gorgeous diadem:</L>
<L>It seem'd thy father!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SETHONA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Seraphis! my father,</L>
<L>And Menes? hapless ghosts!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Peace to their shades!</L>
<L>'Twas but a vision of the mental eye,</L>
<L>Th' unbodied semblances of future things,</L>
<L>And not departed spirits.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SETHONA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hope begins</L>
<L>To dawn upon me. In thy words I feel</L>
<L>The force of inspiration. Yet my grief</L>
<L>Succeeds, like darkness to the transient gleam</L>
<L>Of some deluding meteor! Can the tomb</L>
<L>Give up its dead? Can Menes hear my voice,</L>
<L>And rescue me from the detested arms</L>
<L>Of Amasis? Can Seraphis restore</L>
<L>The long extinguish'd glories of his line?</L>
<L>Can I forget my sorrow? Idle dreams!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ORUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>And yet, such dreams may take substantial forms.</L>
<L>Three days have not elaps'd since from this fane</L>
<L>Menes was torn by Amasis, as yet</L>
<L>No certain tidings of his fate are known:</L>
<L>Tho' fame reports his death. To-day his friend,</L>
<L>Noble Otanes, by the king's command</L>

<L>Fear not his rage.</L>
<L>The fate of Menes has already rais'd</L>
