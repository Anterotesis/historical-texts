<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Comedy of Three Acts was originally written as a Farce in Two Acts, and ne∣ver intended for the Public Theatres, nor the Public Eye.</P>
<P>The Author of it publishes it at the Request of several of her Friends, who saw it <HI>mis</HI>-re∣presented on the Stage, at <HI>Drury-lane;</HI> as she chuses to submit Faults which are really her own, to the Judgment of the World, ra∣ther than be accused of those which she never committed.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE TO THE MINIATURE PICTURE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. KING.</STAGE>
<L>CHILL'D by rude gales while yet reluctant May</L>
<L>With-holds the beauties of the vernal day;</L>
<L>As some fond maid, whom matron frowns reprove,</L>
<L>Suspends the smile her heart devotes to love;</L>
<L>The season's pleasures too delay their hour,</L>
<L>And Winter revels with protracted pow'r:</L>
<L>Then blame not, Critics, if, thus late, we bring</L>
<L>A Winter's Drama—but reproach—the Spring.</L>
<L>What prudent Cit dares yet the season trust,</L>
<L>Bask in his whisky, and enjoy the dust?</L>
<L>Hous'd in Cheapside, scarce yet the gayer spark</L>
<L>Atchieves the Sunday triumph of the Park;</L>
<L>Scarce yet you see him, dreading to be late,</L>
<L>Scour the New-Road, and dash thro' Grosvenor∣gate,</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>Anxious—and fearful too—his steed to show,</L>
<L>The hack'd Bucephalus of Rotten-row:</L>
<L>Careless he seems, yet, vigilantly sly,</L>
<L>Wooes the stray glance of ladies passing by,</L>
<L>While his off-heel, insidiously aside,</L>
<L>Provokes the caper which he seems to chide.</L>
<L>Scarce rural Kensington due honour gains,</L>
<L>The vulgar verdure of her walk remains,</L>
<L>Where white-rob'd misses amble two by two,</L>
<L>Nodding to booted beaux—"how' do, how' do?"</L>
<L>With gen'rous questions that no answer wait,</L>
<L>"How vastly full! A'n't you come vastly late?</L>
<L>"Is'n't it quite charming? When do you leave town?</L>
<L>"A'n't you quite tir'd? Pray can we set you down?"</L>
<L>These suburb pleasures of a London May,</L>
<L>Imperfect yet, we hail the cold delay;</L>
<L>But if this plea's denied, in our excuse</L>
<L>Another still remains, you can't refuse;</L>
<L>It is a Lady writes—and hark—a Noble Muse!</L>
<L>But see a critic starting from his bench—</L>
<L>"A noble author"? Yes, Sir, but the Play's not <HI>French</HI>;</L>
<L>Yet if it were, no blame on us could fall;</L>
<L>For we, you know, must follow Fashion's call:</L>
<L>And true it is, things lately were <HI>en traine</HI></L>
<L>To woo the Gallic Muse at Drury-lane;</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>Not to import a troop of Foreign elves,</L>
<L>But treat you with French Actors—in ourselves:</L>
<L>A Friend we had, who vow'd he'd make us speak</L>
<L><HI>Pure flippant French</HI>—by contract—in a week,</L>
<L>Told us 'twas time to study what was good,</L>
<L>Polish, and leave off being understood;</L>
<L>That crouded audiences we thus might bring</L>
<L>To Monsieur Parsons and Chevalier King:</L>
<L>Or should the Vulgars grumble now and then,</L>
<L>The Prompter might translate—for Country Gen∣tlemen.</L>
<L>Straight all subscrib'd—Kings, Gods, Mutes, Singer, Actor—</L>
<L>A Flanders Figure-dancer our Contractor.</L>
<L>But here I grieve to own, tho't be to you,</L>
<L>He acted—e'en as most Contractors do,</L>
<L>Sold what he never dealt in, and th' amount</L>
<L>Being first discharg'd, submitted his account:</L>
<L>And what th' event? their industry was such,</L>
<L><HI>Dodd</HI> spoke good Flemish, <HI>Bannister</HI> bad Dutch;</L>
<L>Then the rogue told us, with insulting ease,</L>
<L>So it was Foreign it was sure to please:</L>
<L>Beaux, Witsapplaud, as Fashion should commend,</L>
<L>And Misses laugh—to seem to understand—</L>
<L>So from each clime our soil may something gain;</L>
<L>Manhood from Rome, and sprightliness from Spain;</L>
<L>Some <HI>Russian Roscius</HI> next delight the age,</L>
<L>And a <HI>Dutch Heinel</HI> skate along the stage.</L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="8"/>Exotic fopperies, hail! whose flatt'ring smile</L>
<L>Supplants the Sterner Virtues of our Isle!</L>
<L>Thus while with Chinese firs, and Indian pines,</L>
<L>Our nurs'ries swarm, the British Oak declines:</L>
<L>Yet vain our Muse's fear—no Foreign laws</L>
<L>We dread, while native beauty pleads our cause:</L>
<L>While you too judge, whose smiles are honours higher,</L>
<L>Than verse should gain, but where those eyes inspire.</L>
<L>But if the men presume your pow'r to awe,</L>
<L>Retort their churlish Senatorial law:</L>
<L>This is your House—and move—the gentlemen withdraw:</L>
<L>Then they may vote, with envy never ceasing,</L>
<L><HI>Your Influence has encreas'd and is encreasing.</HI></L>
<L>But there, I trust, the resolution's finish'd;</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. JEKYLL.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.</STAGE>
<L>THE men, like tyrants of the Turkish kind,</L>
<L>Have long our sex's energy confin'd;</L>
<L>In full-dress black, and bows, and solemn stalk,</L>
<L>Have long monopoliz'd the Prologue's walk;</L>
<L>But still the flippant Epilogue was our's.</L>
<L>It ask'd, for gay support, the female powr's;</L>
<L>It ask'd a flirting air, coquet and free,</L>
<L>And so to murder it, they fix'd 'on me.'</L>
<L>Much they mistake my talents—I was born</L>
<L>To tell, in sobs and sighs, some tale forlorn;</L>
<L>To wet my handkerchief with Juliet's woes,</L>
<L>Or tune to Shore's despair my 'tragic nose.'</L>
<L>Yes, Gentlemen, in education's spite,</L>
<L>You still shall find that we can read and write;</L>
<L>Like you can swell a debt or a debate.</L>
<L>Can quit the card-table to steer the State,</L>
<L>And bid our Belle-Assemblee's Rhet'ric flow,</L>
<L>To drown your dull declaimers at Soho!</L>
<L>Methinks, e'en now, I hear my sex's tongues,</L>
<L>The sweet, smart melody of female lungs!</L>
<L>The storm of Question, the Division calm,</L>
<L>With "hear her! hear her; Mrs. Speaker, Ma'am!</L>
<L>"Oh Order! Order! Kates and Susans rise,</L>
<L>And Marg'ret moves, and Tabitha replies.</L>
<L>Look to the Camp—Coxheath and Warley Common,</L>
<L>Supplied, at least, for ev'ry tent a woman;</L>
<L>The cartridge paper wrapt the billet-doux,</L>
<L>The rear and picquet form'd the rendezvous;</L>
<L>The drum's stern rattle shook the nuptial bed,d</L>
<L>The knapsack pillow'd 'Lady Sturgeon's' hea;</L>
<L><PB REF="10"/>Love was the watch-word, till the morning fife</L>
<L>Rous'd the tame Major and his warlike wife.</L>
<L>Look to the Stage—to-night's example draws</L>
<L>A female dramatist to grace the cause—</L>
<L>So fade the triumphs of presumptuous man!</L>
<L>And would you, Ladies, but complete my plan,</L>
<L>Here should ye sign some patriot petition,</L>
<L>To mend our constitutional condition.</L>
<L>The men invade our rights; the mimic elves</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Harry Revel, I believe; I did not know that you were come to the university, or I should certain∣ly have waited upon you first; but you will easily dispense with ceremony, for as you have been partly educated abroad, the formalities of an English col∣lege must appear rather strange to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA, <HI>interrupting.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes faith, strange enough, and all the old fogrums with their faces as starch'd and as prim as their bands—why we all move by clock-work; au pied de la lettre, indeed, my good sir; for the clock directs all our motions.</P>

<P>I fancy my good cousin is a great puppy. <STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> The melancholy event of your good father's death must make every place appear dull to you, Sir Harry; but I hope a change of scene, and the at∣tentions of your family—</P>

<P>Family attentions and family affairs are equally my aversion, cousin—and really the queer fancy of my father's ordering me to Oxford in his will, after I had been for three years at an academy in

<P>I suspected as much, but I would not ask. Pray what could you quarrel about? You told me you had given him your picture, and that he intended to make a demand in form to me.</P>

<P>Well, and what knowledge do you get from mine!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this dress shall reconcile me to him, that is, if he deserves it, and make Miss Loveless fling herself at your head, or at your feet, or—</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into the river sooner. I really do not under∣stand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know she has flirted with, and refus'd half the country; the only two persons who have not sacrificed their time or inclinations to her coquetry are you and Belvil. Now I think she likes you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that is quite impossible—for I never speak to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better; nothing piques a coquet like your obstinate silence. Brother, pray let me ask you one question; if you do not feel afraid of her, why should you not speak to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, why—poh, what a question. I'll tell you, Betsy; I like her too well to permit her to ex∣ercise her power over me; she is so handsome, and so capricious, that she would pretend to like me for one day, send me to the devil the next, and laugh at me for loving her all the rest of her life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not visited her these six years, because I saw you avoided her; but her repeated refusals convince me she likes some one, and that you are that one, her blushes, whenever you are named, sufficiently explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be pride hurt—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, pride to be sure.</P>

<P>Well, but Belvil and you—I am all impatience.</P>

<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said—it was yesterday se'en night he said—Miss Loveless was prodigiously handsome and very agreeable. Why no, quoth your foolish sister; no, quoth that creature—No; she is very witty. I observed that she was a great flirt, and that if I married him he should never speak to her. He said, that was very silly. I grew angry, he laugh'd me into a passion, and my passion sent him out of the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was all foolish enough, and then you were sorry—hey. <STAGE>(Eliza <HI>sighs.)</HI></STAGE> Did he take your pic∣ture with him?</P>

<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, he had it hung about his neck; but that is not the worst part of the story: I find he has been ever since with Miss Loveless; six days with that odious flirtilla. Now, as I could deceive you, I am certain of improving upon them; as Sir Harry Revel then will I go there, make violent love to her, rout Belvil, humble her vanity, and when I have deprived her of her whole train of admirers, and her airs, I will offer you as a—</P>

<P>Heyday, sister, not so fast; when it is time I can offer myself; but I do not approve of your going unless the aunt is in the plot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have wrote to her, she disapproves much of her niece's conduct, and is very glad to enter into any scheme that is likely to alter it. Come, do not look so grave—wish me success, and Belvil true. <STAGE>(Going, returns.)</STAGE> Pray contrive to make Belvil believe I am gone to London, if he should call.</P>

<P>Is there no one do you think that is near it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no; if there was any particular person whom she meant to please, she would not permit herself such universal coquetry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Madam, <STAGE>(Looking round)</STAGE> there's no man can hear me; all women are born coquets, and nothing but a great passion for one object can cure that natural propensity we all have to co∣quetry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, good sense might cure it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good sense; good sense only strengthens the foible, as it increases our power over mankind—but to our point; is there no one among your niece's train of admirers whom you should wish her to prefer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>None; Mr. Belvil is not her lover—lord Mac∣grinnon is a proud Scotchman, who praises her beauty, and talks of the delights of love from morning till night; but I suspect his views are in∣terested, from the questions he has ask'd other peo∣ple concerning her estate, her money, her plate, her houses—in short, whatever his intentions are, the secresy he involves them in, bespeaks them to be of no good kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, when Sir Harry Revel appears as a se∣rious rival, we shall find out his plan—but, ma∣dam, do you think Miss Loveless hates my bro∣ther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would to heaven your brother did not dislike her!—he would be a friend and protector to any woman that could please him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then set your heart at rest about him: I know he loves her, though he disapproves of her conduct; and if you will take the excuse of a fiddle to-mor∣row night, to call in your neighbours, by way of my brother's coming to your house, as if it was a natural thing, I will take care to bring matters to such a crisis, that your niece shall be obliged to confess a preference to my brother; if she feels it, which I suspect.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to be a connoisseur in the language of looks; I that live with her never suspected as much.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>She never names him, I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than that, I think, she generally turns off the conversation when he is named: you see, Miss Camply, this is a bad sign—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent one rather: lord, my dear madam, you seem never to have taken the trouble of peep∣ing into your own mind; you are so perfectly un∣acquainted with that of our sex in general—and—</P>
<STAGE>[Laughing.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know which delights me most, her phi∣losophy, or vivacity; my ignorance proceeds not from my not searching into my own heart, but that no one has taken the trouble of asking if I had one or not; for you know, Miss Camply, I am an old maid.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know; I suppose it is like all other uni∣versities—we young fellows leave in them all the little learning we are ever possessed of; and carry no sort of knowledge out of them, which can be of any service to us during the rest of our lives—how should we—we drink port—drive stage coaches—and laugh at the old Dons—Pshaw—Pray, my lord, how do <HI>you like</HI> Miss Loveless, is she not very handsome?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord MACGRINNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he does mean to attack her, I will mislead him. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> She has had so many fine speeches made to her, that I believe nothing but neglect would move her.—I will make him behave quite rude to her, and then she will hate him. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Pretend not to see her, tak na notice of her beauty; rail against the whole sex, and I'll warrant she's your awn.</P>

<P>And I will feed her vanity; which in good truth, as they say, is her only weakness; I woul cram it till it shall overflow all her gude sense—take this with you, Sir Harry, I believe she has a great deal of pride, but na vanity at all; na, na vanity at all, I think—</P>

<P>That's a Scotch lie now, he has some design in that. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> No vanity, my lord, why the world attribute vanity to her, as the only shade to her perfections—Now swear to your lie, Sawney. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord MACGRINNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my credit, I never saw any thing like it; pride she has, and a great deal; and my advice can only come from my desire of being of some sarvice to you.</P>

<P>Much obliged to you, my lord; have I not some reason to suspect your advice, for I am told you are one of her lovers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord MACGRINNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mere jest or calumny, Sir Harry, na, na; na Macgrinnon ever married a woman that had na title—Indeed Miss Loveless's fortune might make a mon forget she was not noble, if he might have it aw without any lawyers interfering; but not me, Sir Harry. Na, I will na be the first o' my fami∣ly to set the example of marrying only a simple gentlewoman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you think it would be very foolish for any one to marry without getting the fortune intirely into one's own hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord MACGRINNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most surely; and in truth, Sir Harry, women are come to such a pretty high-flying pass now-a-days, that ruin and beggary are the only things that can keep a wife within the bounds of decency. Why, ye hear of nathing but divorces; na, I should
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
be sorry were I to give my name to any woman, that if she chose to play the devil I must return one six-pence of her money for separate maintenance, or that she should exact an allowance from me—Na, na, Sir Harry, keep the power and the pence together in your awn hands.</P>

<P>I say the whole sex are much obliged to your lordship. I am quite of a different opinion, my lord; and as I was telling you, if I was a woman myself, I could not be better acquainted with the sex than I am; and I imagine it is the unjust usur∣pation of all their natural rights and liberties which men are possessed of that makes our sex—I say, that makes women, my lord, women, run into such errors.</P>

<P>Yes, I have seen her; but she blushes so much at every thing, and at nothing—and her counte∣nance alters from one moment to another into such a variety of expressions, that I really never could decide any thing about her—I suppose Mr. Belvil's passion for her was only a nursery prejudice.</P>

<P>Not that neither; do not be offended, Miss Loveless, if I acknowledge that I had not the least serious intentions about you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is there a combination—a plot to laugh at me—I can tell you, Miss Camply, if my beha∣viour appeared extraordinary, I think yours to the full as reprehensible, to put me on a masculine habit and personate a man for the sake of an odious man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never encouraged but that one odious man; but you, Miss Loveless, have encouraged many.</P>

<P>Why, madam, I shall be the ridicule of the country; but I will not stay to bear it—I wish you joy both of you of your intended match; and I hope you will be as heartily tired of each other soon, as I am of you at present—but you shall not have the pleasure of seeing me mortified—I shall go and live at Paris for the remainder of my life; I

have an uncle that will let me live as privately as I please. Pray, madam, make my excuses to the company—say I have got the head-ach; say any thing, and to morrow I'll go and leave you and all my follies behind me. <STAGE><HI>(Going, enter Mr.</HI> Camply)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Loveless, it is all my fault—My sister has treated you in this manner only to try you, and if my whole life can atone for the moment of pain she has occasioned, dispose of it. I tremble for her answer. <STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mr. Camply, I am determined to go, and will not make you so bad a present as that of my hand—besides, I like no one, and, not you cer∣tainly, of all men in the world; for had you liked me these three years, you could not have kept it so secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then my sister has deceived me only to make me still more wretched than I was—she—she—presumed, you—did not hate me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Talks aside to the aunt, and then comes forward)</STAGE>
<P>I am a presuming young woman, indeed; but I have good eyes and a feeling heart; and I am sure you cannot be happy without each other—so, there—come—your hand—and yours—</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I don't like him.</P>

<P>Oh, you do not like him! then, Mrs. Arabella, what do you say upon this subject?</P>
</SP>

<P>I say, since my niece has pride enough to op∣pose her own happiness, that she has owned to me that she likes Mr. Camply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, aunt, I do think you are much worse than Mr. Belvil, Miss Camply, or her bro∣ther; and therefore, to be revenged, I'll e'en stay and try to be happier than you all seem to be—and now, Mr. Camply, if upon farther acquaint∣ance we do not change our minds, we may follow the example of Mr. Belvil and your sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. CAMPLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, miss, for my sister is soon to be married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O not this twelvemonth—and as no one shall say I lead them into a scrape, we will all four be married together, and you, as my elder brother, must begin the dance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELVIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall endeavour to hasten the period, for a twelvemonth seems an age.</P>

<P>Enough of this! now we are all agreed, I will shew you a scene that may amuse you, if you will follow me into the garden.</P>

<P>This is a fine evening, my lord; but you look disturb'd, what is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord MACGRINNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matter, why all the plagues of Egypt I believe: yes, yes, I am disturb'd, and wet to the skin too; so pray what do you talk of a fine evening for, there has been a violent storm of rain. <STAGE>(All the company laugh)</STAGE> Na, na—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss LOVELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to you, my lord, for your very kind intentions, and love of my fortune; I was so insensible of the nature of your affection, that it is to me you are indebted for that shower of rain from yonder engine, and for a beating into the bargain from honest John, who thought it was his mistress you were going off with.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord MACGRINNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank ye, I feel as if you had done it. Never did any man of the family of Macgrinnon suffer such indignities as I have suffered from this com∣pany; to be deluded by a woman is a trifle; a man of sense will expect it: but I canna help re∣flecting on the impertinencies, the jeers, and the sluicing that have been thrown at me, without thinking that the happiness of my noble ancestors is disturbed by the unworthy treatment that has been offered to their lineal descendant.</P>

<P>Certainly nothing but his vanity could induce him to think that I was weak enough to comply with his request; and now, Miss Camply, I will confess that I am much indebted to you for curing me of my ridiculous plan of conduct, and I wish you may succeed in every thing you undertake as you have in this.</P>

<P>Why, mine was rather a bold scheme, I must confess? but if the rest of the company <STAGE>(bowing round)</STAGE> will forget what a very lively coxcomb I
