<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I cannot boast the Ho∣nour of a personal acquaintance with you, yet it would be passing the severest Censure on myself, to declare I had not that intellectual one, which the world, in general, claim with Men of distinguished Abilities. I will not trespass on your Deli∣cacy, by giving Vent to the Fullness of my Admiration, or by repeating what is already

universally known and acknowledged. I only solicit your Patronage for the feeble Off∣spring of a friendless Muse, conscious I can∣not lay it before a better Judge than you, Sir, whose Writings have been so long the Prop and Ornament of the DRAMA; and that if any thing can give it shelter, it must be the protecting Influence of your Name.</P>

<HEAD>THE DRAMA.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEVERE his task in these degen'rate days,</L>
<L>Who rashly dares to grasp one sprig of Bayes;</L>
<L>The frown of censure, and pale envy's blight,</L>
<L>Long damp his ardour, and retard his flight.</L>
<L>In form of critic, lo! where link'd they stand,</L>
<L>With pride and dulness fix'd on either hand,</L>
<L>Pointing with rugged thorns the painful steep,</L>
<L>They ne'er ascend, tho' round it doom'd to creep.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5"/>Not so, when Greece and Rome aspir'd to fame,</L>
<L>Then critic, and sound judgment were the same;</L>
<L>The poet sought the gen'rous critic's aid,</L>
<L>And the same laurel gave them both a shade;</L>
<L>With all the terrors beating at my heart,</L>
<L>A novice feels in first essays of art,</L>
<L>With greatest homage for superior powr's,</L>
<L>Trembling I seek the muse's sacred bow'rs;</L>
<L>Sentenc'd in fancy, ere my fate be known,</L>
<L>As Churchill's theme I've rashly made my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mistaken zeal, with folly at her side,</L>
<L>Oft has the Drama and its sons decri'd;</L>
<L>Gave the profession faults which nature knew,</L>
<L>And judg'd the many from an erring few.</L>
<L>Strictures like these for laughter only call,</L>
<L>From their own weakness they must quickly fall.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>Let railing bigots, and let pedant fools,</L>
<L>Of morals prate, and precepts taught in schools,</L>
<L>Such clouds dissolve at merit's dazzling ray,</L>
<L>As mists are melted by the eye of day:</L>
<L>Shall he, whose quick'ning, animated frame,</L>
<L>Electric like, collects the poet's flame?</L>
<L>Whose glowing breast feels ev'ry passion roll,</L>
<L>And yields a body to great Shakespear's soul;</L>
<L>Gives him each ornament of art and grace,</L>
<L>And holds his mirror up to nature's face,</L>
<L>Not gain the meed of well-earn'd honest fame?</L>
<L>GARRICK, step forward, and assert your claim.</L>
<L>Here charm'd attention could for ever wait,</L>
<L>Fixt on thy beauties, unconfin'd as great,</L>
<L>And wrapt in visions of thy magic skill,</L>
<L>Indulge the transports which my bosom fill.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>But what, tho' language were to feeling true,</L>
<L>Expressing strongly all in thought I view,</L>
<L>What could it add, O GARRICK, to thy name,</L>
<L>Already foremost on the lists of fame?</L>
<L>Warm'd, I may tell, as diff'rent masks he wears,</L>
<L>We shake with laughter, or dissolve in tears,</L>
<L>Dwell on his spirit, judgment, taste, and grace,</L>
<L>And the keen light'nings flashing from his face;</L>
<L>But once behold the wonders of his art,</L>
<L>You'll find those drawn by nature on your heart;</L>
<L>To point his excellence, or speak his praise,</L>
<L>But stamps fresh value on the poet's lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next on the line, yet distant, BARRY stands,</L>
<L>And takes precedence of the tragic bands.</L>
<L>Nor does presumption only prop his claim,</L>
<L>Once genius warm'd him with her finest flame.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="8"/>In love's soft transports, or its wasting care,</L>
<L>I feel each rapture, ev'ry pang I share;</L>
<L>If in the Moor, by wildest passions prest,</L>
<L>Who does not find the storm assail his breast?</L>
<L>Now worn with years, and almost quench'd his beam,</L>
<L>He faintly glimmers like the embers gleam;</L>
<L>Yet in the sparks of his expiring light,</L>
<L>Proves that the blaze which fir'd him once was bright:</L>
<L>Thus the grand column, or majestic dome,</L>
<L>Rear'd in the splendor of old Greece or Rome,</L>
<L>Tho' broke with tempests, and by time decay'd,</L>
<L>Retain a greatness, e'en in ruins laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' weak the million, and to judge unfit,</L>
<L>Still custom dubs them arbiters of wit;</L>
<L>Their breath alone 'tis swells the trump of fame,</L>
<L>And sounds the poet's or the sage's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<L>Severe decree, and most the actor's bane,</L>
<L>Whose art is tried by folly's giddy train.</L>
<L>This MACKLIN felt, tho' merit's sterling seal,</L>
<L>Long pass'd him current in theatric scale.</L>
<L>Grant him unequal to his daring aim,</L>
<L>Did former service no indulgence claim?</L>
<L>Too high ambition might have soar'd for praise,</L>
<L>But yet 'twas mingled with a wish to please:</L>
<L>Thus far humanity and justice plead;</L>
<L>Now let us speak as taste and candour lead.</L>
<L>Dark was his col'ring, but conception strong;</L>
<L>If hard his manner, still it ne'er was wrong.</L>
<L>Warm'd with the poet, to the part he rose,</L>
<L>His anger fir'd us, and his terror froze;</L>
<L>And more; where quaintness shut out meaning's day,</L>
<L>MACKLIN threw light with fine discernment's ray:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>If these are truths, which envy's self must breathe,</L>
<L>Applause should crown him with her greenest wreath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where, on her native quarry next to light,</L>
<L>Shall the muse bend her melancholy flight?</L>
<L>Now half her sons are swept by death's fell pow'r,</L>
<L>And scarce a gleam of hope remains of more.</L>
<L>O, sacred fire! which once with active heat,</L>
<L>In POWELL's and in MOSSOP's bosoms beat,</L>
<L>Where art thou fled? or dost thou only rest</L>
<L>In GARRICK's and in BARRY's feeling breast?</L>
<L>No, replies genius; I have found a part,</L>
<L>A favourite mansion in a female heart,</L>
<L>Where steady judgment and fine taste prepare</L>
<L>Their richest off'rings, to detain me there;</L>
<L>Behold, where beauty, in the shape of grace,</L>
<L>With sweetness beams from BARRY, form and face;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>There I reside, enamour'd of the seat,</L>
<L>Heedless of envy or ambition's cheat,</L>
<L>And ne'er will quit her, 'till my rival time,</L>
<L>Shall ravish life, as well as youth and prime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A handsome figure, with an easy mien,</L>
<L>Are all SMITH's requisites to fill the scene;</L>
<L>Flat, without compass, drawling on the ear,</L>
<L>In one dull tone th'unvaried voice we hear;</L>
<L>No flame of passion ever yet he knew,</L>
<L>Or, changing character, appear'd once new;</L>
<L>Person alone first gave him to the stage,</L>
<L>And habit guards him in this easy age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>REDDISH wants pow'r, th'emotion strong to raise,</L>
<L>But his attention gains, and merits praise;</L>
<L>Tho' voice and feeling small assistance lend,</L>
<L>He oft has pleas'd, and seldom does offend;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>Unless, when folly fain would have him great,</L>
<L>And rant and stare usurp expression's seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, how it moves me to the taunting jibe,</L>
<L>To hear some groundling of th'itin'rant tribe;</L>
<L>York, Bath, or Norwich, rank with DRURY's scene,</L>
<L>Now Frodsham's gone, and Inchbald has been seen.</L>
<L>What, tho' their Lee boasts some faint strokes of art,</L>
<L>Does he e'er touch with sympathy the heart?</L>
<L>Where is that grace, that station which commands,</L>
<L>Applause's tribute with her hundred hands?</L>
<L>His person's vulgar, his deportment's bad,</L>
<L>And tame correctness all he ever had.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hibernia, whence the stage recruits her force,</L>
<L>Has just sent LEWIS to the Thespian course;</L>
<L>Bless'd with those happy requisites to please,</L>
<L>A person, spirit, elegance, and ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<L>How cold shone Belcour before LEWIS came;</L>
<L>'Twas he restor'd him to the poet's flame:</L>
<L>Passions like his, such genuine active fire,</L>
<L>May claim, indeed, the god of day for sire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BENSLEY has little, save what art supplies,</L>
<L>For step-dame nature almost all denies;</L>
<L>Gloom shades his aspect, discord's in his tone,</L>
<L>His joy's as grating as his tragic moan.</L>
<L>Yet such a charm can industry impart,</L>
<L>Aided by worth, and merit of the heart,</L>
<L>That he stands higher on dramatic line,</L>
<L>Than he, whose talents, more than virtues, shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all her suitors in the Thespian art,</L>
<L>Thalia holds KING nearest to her heart;</L>
<L>Fix'd in his eye, the smiling goddess sits,</L>
<L>And thence deals laughter with its loudest fits.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>Ease and indulgence oft at merit's throne,</L>
<L>Prefer'd their plea, and claim'd him as their own;</L>
<L>Their wish obtained, Thalia then appear'd,</L>
<L>Struck with a danger which she long had fear'd;</L>
<L>Her sister's sables, and her tears she wore,</L>
<L>To woo the truant to her arms once more:</L>
<L>Subdu'd, the lover's fondness stood confest,</L>
<L>And clasp'd his weeping mistress to his breast;</L>
<L>Vow'd to be constant to the suppliant maid,</L>
<L>Till death dissolv'd the union nature made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That part, an actor in the bloom of life</L>
<L>Plays with success, he takes to him for wife,</L>
<L>Simpers and ogles with a wither'd face,</L>
<L>And trips the beau with antiquated grace.</L>
<L>Tho' WOODWARD once might boast of sprightly ease,</L>
<L>And ev'ry frolic wantonness to please,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>Why must he gambol after youth is fled,</L>
<L>And winter scatters hoar upon his head?</L>
<L>Still there's a cast his talents to employ,</L>
<L>Razor or Bobadil can never cloy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When partial nature gifts a fav'rite son,</L>
<L>With more than toiling art had ever won,</L>
<L>Should not the muse, if sloth the bounty mar,</L>
<L>Censure the culprit who neglects her care?</L>
<L>SHUTER, tho' bless'd with humour's richest vein,</L>
<L>And skill to reach the highest comic strain,</L>
<L>Forgets his patroness, and slights her boon,</L>
<L>And, when he wants his part, becomes buffoon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As folly's offspring sport in fashion's glare,</L>
<L>Flutt'ring in silks, with well-bred shrug and stare,</L>
<L>The insect tribe DODD paints with nicest art,</L>
<L>And gives a double edge to satire's dart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<L>Nature has dealt to CLINCH with lib'ral hand,</L>
<L>Talents, which cultur'd, might applause command;</L>
<L>But vain the grant, and slow must rise his fame,</L>
<L>Unless the manager will fan the flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BRERETON has person, is not void of grace,</L>
<L>But wants the energy of voice and face;</L>
<L>In gay description, or in polish'd ease,</L>
<L>His taste and judgment never fail to please.</L>
<L>And when by time he's ripen'd on the bow,</L>
<L>He'll merit that success he wishes now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let those whom pride attract, not sense and choice,</L>
<L>Expire in raptures at an eunuch's voice,</L>
<L>And feigning transports which they never felt,</L>
<L>At unintelligible nonsense melt.</L>
<L>For me, a plain, rough, honest Briton bred,</L>
<L>Who oft have err'd, but by my heart was led,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="17"/>Who, tho' a monarch shou'd his favours heap,</L>
<L>Dare spurn at folly, and at op'ra sleep:</L>
<L>I call on VERNON, if a sound must feast,</L>
<L>To stamp it with the currency of taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Few can, like BANNISTER, with humour strong,</L>
<L>Do equal justice both to wit and song;</L>
<L>And could the muse award the mimic praise,</L>
<L>FOOT would not stand much higher in her lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Faint as a shadow CAUTHERLEY glides by,</L>
<L>And melts without impression on the eye.</L>
<L>When DIBDIN's boast was a composer's name,</L>
<L>He stood the rival of the author's fame,</L>
<L>Till seiz'd with madness, not poetic fire,</L>
<L>He rashly dar'd himself to touch the lyre,</L>
<L>When Phoebus, shock'd at discord not his own,</L>
<L>Gave him to censure with her hiss and groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<L>A greater bard, on MOODY's brow has plac'd</L>
<L>A wreath with which it ever must be grac'd;</L>
<L>Conscious I cannot give increase of bays,</L>
<L>I'll add, at least, my humble meed of praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>QUICK wants not parts, but SHUTER is the sun</L>
<L>Round which he moves, and borrows all his fun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the harsh parent, or the rustic boor,</L>
<L>DUNSTALL and PARSONS shew strong comic pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PALMER gives spirit to the sprightly scene,</L>
<L>By gay deportment and a pleasing mien:</L>
<L>But when he woos the tuneful queen of tears,</L>
<L>His accents wound the muse's finer ears;</L>
<L>Shock'd at the sound, we scarcely can believe</L>
<L>That the same man cou'd ever pleasure give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without an effort, WESTON gains applause,</L>
<L>Nature has made him what the poet draws:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="19"/>Others, with trick, and stage manoeuvre aim,</L>
<L>To strike the groundlings, and their clap obtain;</L>
<L>Shew Johnson's Drugger, skill'd in Broughton art,</L>
<L>And Scrub, instead of fool, a downright smart:</L>
<L>But he, superior to such paltry aid,</L>
<L>Ne'er makes a jest but what his author made;</L>
<L>True humour, free from taint of low grimace,</L>
<L>Or wild distortion, sits upon his face:</L>
<L>Tho' laughter shake, unconscious he receives</L>
<L>The echoing plaudit public favour gives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LEWES, in Marlow, makes his audience feel,</L>
<L>That he has head and heart as well as heel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The needy emigrant from Gallia's shore,</L>
<L>The butt of ridicule since time of yore,</L>
<L>Who struts in frippery and tinsell'd stuff,</L>
<L>And jabbers nonsense, as he scoops up snuff;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="20"/>BADD'LY, with humour's pencil, strongly draws,</L>
<L>And meets, as he deserves, with warm applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cold, and unmeaning, AICKIN fills a part,</L>
<L>And never gains the head, or moves the heart.</L>
<L>With jointed sound, proceed his jarring tones,</L>
<L>Like currents harsh, and broke with beds of stones.</L>
<L>His acting's vappid, it wants feeling's soul,</L>
<L>To warm and quicken, into life the whole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HULL's always perfect, and displays an aim,</L>
<L>To catch the poet's spirit, and his flame;</L>
<L>At times, he soars beyond chill medium's line,</L>
<L>And shews some sparks of excellence that shine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What numbers censure, but how few judge right,</L>
<L>On subjects, which demand the soul's keen sight;</L>
<L>Each puny witling, from stark folly vain,</L>
<L>Dares JOHNSON's talents, or a SWIFT's arraign,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="21"/>Merit by malice, not with taste they scan,</L>
<L>And damn the art, because they hate the man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis certain MELMOTH has not gain'd that height,</L>
<L>On which perfection seated, drops her flight.</L>
<L>His person too wants weight, but then his heart,</L>
<L>Springs in his words, and animates each part.</L>
<L>Apollo pleads his cause; and dare the muse,</L>
<L>To hear her prince, and patron's voice refuse?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WROUGHTON has person, and conception just,</L>
<L>But wants strong feeling to be rank'd as first.</L>
<L>A happy aspect, and a wish to please,</L>
<L>Deserve at least, if not extort our praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When surly winter with his felon train,</L>
<L>Flies to some cavern on the howling main,</L>
<L>And blooming summer leads the sprightly hours,</L>
<L>Then FOOTE collects his vagrant sactter'd pow'rs,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="22"/>Poet and manager, at once he stands,</L>
<L>And starts upon the town his motley bands.</L>
<L>'Tis rash to censure, where the public praise</L>
<L>Gives to the actor, and the author bays.</L>
<L>But sure applause, should never be his meed,</L>
<L>Who sports with faults which weyward fate decreed,</L>
<L>Who breaks that tye, which binds each noble breast,</L>
<L>And stabs his friend before he'll lose his jest.</L>
<L>Success is giddy, as the veering blast,</L>
<L>And when it is not just, can never last.</L>
<L>Tho' now the senseless rabble may esteem,</L>
<L>The home-felt col'ring of his time-wrought scene,</L>
<L>Ages to come, where poets should appeal,</L>
<L>Will never laugh at what they cannot feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Person and elegance are YATES's claim,</L>
<L>They're her chief passports, to the court of fame.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="23"/>Her action's moulded into grace, and ease,</L>
<L>And plaudits from the nicest judgement raise.</L>
<L>Kindling she glows with all the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s' fires,</L>
<L>And strongly feeling ev'ry heart inspires.</L>
<L>Still with a sigh, too clearly we behold,</L>
<L>The greatest spirit must with years wax cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOUNG's speaking's just, her action too is right,</L>
<L>Yet seem like nymphs in boddice lac'd too tight,</L>
<L>What need so oft, the close join'd hands to raise;</L>
<L>Or bow like Bramin in his idol's praise.</L>
<L>And then that stalk, which Zanga well befits,</L>
<L>But ne'er with grace on female softness sits.</L>
<L>Yet spite of all her faults, her merits shine,</L>
<L>And prove her YATES's rival on the line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How shall I treat thee, HARTLEY, to preserve,</L>
<L>That homage, candour and the fair deserve?</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="24"/>For sure if Venus chose a mortal mould,</L>
<L>The radiance of her charms divine t'enfold,</L>
<L>HARTLY had been, the sacred, envi'd seat,</L>
<L>To which a goddess may indeed retreat.</L>
<L>Beauty, like charity, a charm spreads wide,</L>
<L>Veiling a multitude of faults beside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Spirit, and grace, BARSANTI I allow,</L>
<L>And hope to see her what a POPE is now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MACKLIN has judgment solid, taste refin'd,</L>
<L>With every bright embellishment of mind;</L>
<L>No charm, or spells, within her dimples lie,</L>
<L>Or fluttering cupids, ambush in her eye,</L>
<L>Sheer merit only, and the force of skill,</L>
<L>First gained her trophies, and maintain them still;</L>
<L>No touch of harmony can strike the heart,</L>
<L>With half that magic CATLEY's strains impart;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="25"/>But folly, as if envious of her fame,</L>
<L>With gesture vulgar, and uncouth, proclaim,</L>
<L>That acting in a female should have grace,</L>
<L>Or modesty, at least, to fill it's place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of sterling humour, GREEN has ample store,</L>
<L>Perhaps e'en CLIVE was never blessed with more.</L>
<L>Mark where in Heidleberg, th' extreams of life,</L>
<L>Like Groom, and Peer, are constantly at strife;</L>
<L>Or else when Termagant, with luckless hit,</L>
<L>Stumbles on nonsense, in her search for wit.</L>
<L>And if a STANHOPE's precept have no weight,</L>
<L>You'll own by laughter; that her merit's great;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No woman without beauty, or great skill,</L>
<L>Can, or cou'd ever, on the stage excell.</L>
<L>That prop alone, supports a MELMOTH's name,</L>
<L>While the sad want prevents a MATTOCK's fame.</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="26"/>If music's voice, the throbbing breast can move,</L>
<L>Or melting softness, wake the soul to love;</L>
<L>If mild expression, beaming from a face,</L>
<L>Where sweetness revels with resistless grace,</L>
<L>Can cold attention into rapture warm,</L>
<L>Behold in BADD'LY ev'ry pow'r to charm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What CLIVE was once, POPE is, as Churchill told,</L>
<L>'Ere rip'ning time her talents cou'd unfold:</L>
<L>Late may the stage lament her absent aid,</L>
<L>And never, till with equal genius paid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How few can ever reach that happy line,</L>
<L>Where sense, and spirit, by their union shine;</L>
<L>And softned into ease, with nicest art,</L>
<L>Assail at once, the judgment and the heart.</L>
<L>That rarest talent, ABINGTON alone,</L>
<L>Possesses in perfection, all her own.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="27"/>What woman else, with such a grace displays</L>
<L>The courtly manners, and true polish'd ease.</L>
<L>Her skill gives sanction to vain fashion's stare,</L>
<L>And makes the critic even folly bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fresh crouds press forward on the muse's sight,</L>
<L>But pass like shadows at th'approach of night.</L>
<L>So when the Trojan, future time t'explore,</L>
<L>Sought the dusk limits of the Stygian shore,</L>
<L>The Ghosts in throngs beset the Hero round,</L>
<L>With feeble clamours, and a shrieking sound;</L>
<L>But when he stretch'd, the fading forms to chase,</L>
<L>Their bodies melt, he grasps the vacant space.</L>
<L>Yet still these nothings, insolent and vain,</L>
<L>Expect proud reason's sentence to obtain.</L>
<L>Then mark my tale, and weigh the moral well,</L>
<L>If right conceiv'd, 'twill folly's rudeness quell.</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="28"/>The vain Florella once, at pride's command,</L>
<L>Sat for her portrait to a famous hand:</L>
<L>The painter tried the utmost of his skill,</L>
<L>But found it baffled by the object still.</L>
<L>No trace of character, or glow of heart,</L>
<L>Flush'd on her face, to strike the glance of art.</L>
<L>In fruitless toil, he saw his work must end,</L>
<L>When mind, and soul no inspiration lend.</L>
<L>Then bade the fool, some other artist try,</L>
<L>Sick of the task, and laid his pencil by.</L>
