<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE End of Satyr is Reformation: And the Author, tho' he doubts the Work of Conversion is at a gene∣ral Stop, has put his Hand to the Plow.</P>
<P>I expect a Storm of Ill Language from the Fury of the Town, and especially from those whose <HI>English</HI> Talent it is to Rail: And without being taken for a Conjurer, I may ven∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure to foretel, That I shall be Cavil'd at about my <HI>Mean Stile, Rough Verse,</HI> and <HI>Incorrect Language;</HI> Things I might indeed have taken more Care in. But the Book is Printed; and tho' I see some Faults, 'tis too late to mend them: And this is all I think needful to say to them.</P>
<P>Possibly Somebody may take me for a <HI>Dutchman;</HI> in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are mistaken: But I am one that would be glad to see <HI>Englishmen</HI> behave themselves better to Strangers, and to Governors also; that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries, for belonging to a <HI>Nation that wants Manners.</HI></P>
<P>I assure you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Strangers use us better abroad; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd we can give no reason but our Ill Nature for the contra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y here.</P>
<P>Methinks an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who is so proud of being call'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Goodfellow,</HI> shou'd be civil: And it cannot be denied but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are in many Cases, and particularly to Strangers, the hurlishest People alive.</P>
<P>As to Vices, who can dispute our <HI>Intemperance,</HI> while an <HI>Honest Drunken Fellow</HI> is a Character in a Man's Praise? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll our Reformations are Banters, and will be so, till our Magistrates and Gentry Reform themselves by way of Exam∣ple;
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
then, and not till then, they may be expected to punish others without <HI>blushing.</HI></P>
<P>As to our <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> I desire to be understood of that particular People, who pretending to be Protestants, have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Liberties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King <HI>James</HI> and his Popish Powers: Together with such who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the present Government, and yet abuse and affront the King who procur'd it, and openly profess their Uneasiness under him: These, by whatsoever Names or Titles they are dignified or distinguish'd, are the People aim'd at: Nor do I disown, but that it is so much the Temper of an <HI>Englishman</HI> to abuse his Benefactor, that I could be glad to see it rectified.</P>
<P>They who think I have been guilty of any Error, in expo∣sing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to themselves, may among many honest Instances of the like nature, find the same thing in Mr. <HI>Cowly,</HI> in his Imitation of the second Olympick Ode of <HI>Pindar:</HI> His Words are these;
<Q><L>But in this Thankless World the Givers</L>
<L>Are envi'd even by th' Receivers:</L>
<L>'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Fashion,</L>
<L>Rather to hide than pay an Obligation.</L>
<L>Nay, 'tis much worse than so;</L>
<L>It now an <HI>Artifice</HI> doth grow,</L>
<L><HI>Wrongs</HI> and <HI>Outrages</HI> to do,</L>
<L>Lest Men should think we <HI>Owe.</HI></L></Q></P>

<L>Tis not at Foreigners that we repine,</L>
<L>Wou'd Foreigners their Perquisites resign:</L>

<L>WHere-ever God erects a House of Prayer,</L>
<L>The Devil always builds a Chapel there:</L>
<L>And 'twill be found upon Examination,</L>
<L>The latter has the largest Congregation:</L>
<L>For ever since he first debauch'd the Mind,</L>
<L>He made a perfect Conquest of Mankind.</L>
<L>With Uniformity of Service, he</L>
<L>Reigns with a general Aristocracy.</L>
<L>No Nonconforming Sects disturb his Reign,</L>
<L>For of his Yoak there's very few complain.</L>
<L>He knows the Genius and the Inclination,</L>
<L>And matches proper Sins for ev'ry Nation.</L>
<L>He needs no Standing-Army Government;</L>
<L>He always rules us by our own Consent:</L>
<L>His Laws are easy, and his gentle Sway</L>
<L>Makes it exceeding pleasant to obey.</L>
<L>The List of his Vicegerents and Commanders,</L>
<L>Outdoes your <HI>Caesars,</HI> or your <HI>Alexanders.</HI></L>
<L>They never fail of his infernal Aid,</L>
<L>And he's as certain ne'er to be betray'd.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>Through all the World they spread his vast Command,</L>
<L>And Death's Eternal Empire's maintain'd.</L>
<L>They rule so politickly and so well,</L>

<L>Duly divided to debauch Mankind,</L>
<L>And plant Infernal Dictates in his Mind.</L>
<L><HI>Pride,</HI> the first Peer, and President of Hell,</L>
<L>To his share <HI>Spain,</HI> the largest Province, fell.</L>
<L>The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow</L>
<L>On these the Golden Mines of <HI>Mexico</HI>;</L>
<L>With all the Silver Mountains of Peru;</L>
<L>Wealth which would in wise hands the World undo:</L>
<L>Because he knew their Genius was such;</L>
<L>Too Lazy and too Haughty to be Rich.</L>
<L>So proud a People, so above their Fate,</L>
<L>That if reduc'd to beg, they'll beg in State.</L>
<L>Lavish of Money, to be counted Brave,</L>
<L>And proudly starve, because they scorn to save.</L>

<L>So very Rich, and yet so very Poor.</L>

<L>A Dancing Nation, Fickle and Untrue:</L>

<L>Or Deeds of Heroes done in Days of Yore,</L>
<L>In latent Records of the Ages past,</L>
<L>Behind the Rear of Time, in long Oblivion plac'd.</L>
<L>For if our Virtues must in Lines descend,</L>
<L>The Merit with the Families would end:</L>
<L>And Intermixtures would most fatal grow;</L>
<L>For Vice would be Hereditary too;</L>
<L>The tainted Blood wou'd of Necessity,</L>

<L>Vice, like Ill Nature, for an Age or two,</L>
<L>May seem a Generation to pursue:</L>
<L>But Virtue seldom does regard the Breed;</L>
<L>Fools do the Wise, and Wise Men Fools succeed.</L>

<P>An ELEGY ON THE AUTHOR OF THE True-Born-<HI>English-Man.</HI>
WITH AN ESSAY On the Late STORM.</P>
<P>By the AUTHOR of the HYMN to the PILLORY.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed in the Year 1708.</P>

<PB REF="42"/>
<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THO' these Sheets have been Wrote several Months, and in a time that seem'd to make them something more suitable than now: Yet the Occasion renewing it self every day, who can refrain from speaking?</P>
<P>Had the scribling World been pleas'd to leave me where they found me, I had left them and <HI>Newgate</HI> both together; and as I am metaphorically Dead, had been effectually so, as to Satyrs and Pamphlets.</P>
<P>'Tis really something hard, that after all the Mortification they think they have put upon a poor abdicated Author, in their scurrilous Street Ri∣baldry, and Bear Garden Usage, some in Prose, and some in those terri∣ble Lines they call Verse, they cannot yet be quiet, but whenever any thing comes out that does not please them, I come in for a share in the Answer, whatever I did in the Question, every thing they think an Au∣thor deserves to be abus'd for, must be mine.</P>
<P>Several plentiful Showers of Railery I have quietly submitted to, an thought I had a Talent of Patience as large as might serve me in com∣mon with my Neighbours, but there is a time when a Man can bear n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> longer, and if the Man is in a little Passion, he thinks he ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> born with.</P>
<P>I tried Retirement, and banish'd my self from the Town: I thought as the Boys us'd to say, 'twas but fair they should let me alone, while did not meddle with them.</P>
<P>But neither a Country Recess, any more than a Stone Doublet, on secure a Man from the Clamour of the Pen.</P>
<P>In the following Sheets I endeavour to state the Case in order to Truce; for shame, Gentlemen, let him alone, why the Man's Dead: 't<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a Cowardly Trick to beat a Man when he's down, but to fight a Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man is the Devil.</P>
<P>And with Submission, Gentlemen, the Allegory is just: for if bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tied under Sureties and Penalties not to write, at least not to write wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> some People may not like, be not equivalent to being Dead, as to the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I know not what is.</P>
<P>But how do these People treat Mankind, that they pretend to Indict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man for every thing they please, as if they had Power to Read his Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tenance in Letters, and swear to a Stile as they would to his Face?</P>
<P>'Tis easie to prove the Authors of Books, and no Man can be conceal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in such Cases; but for a Man to be charged with other Mens Faults, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>has too many of his own,</HI> is a method newly practis'd, and more up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me than any Body; and yet the Grief of this Usage does not stick so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon me, but that I may tell my Antagonists, <HI>if any think themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> deserving that Name,</HI> that they are very welcome to go on their own w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and use me as they please, I shall always be ready to reply, or by my<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦lence let them see I do not think it worth my while.</P>

<L>That High-Church Honesty's an Empty Show,</L>

<L>Their Volumes with their Loyalty may swell,</L>

<L>No fair Pretence shall blind my Pen,</L>
<L>They that <HI>in such a Reign as this</HI> Rebel</L>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not my intention to make an Apology for my <HI>Poem</HI>: Some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think it needs no Excuse; and others will receive none. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sign, I am sure, is honest: but he who draws his Pen for one Party, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expect to make Enemies of the other. For, <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Fool,</HI> are Con∣quences of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI>: And every man is a Knave or an Ass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contrary side. There's a Treasury of Merits in the <HI>Phanatick Churc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as well as in the <HI>Papist</HI>; and a Pennyworth to be had of Saintship, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦sty and Poetry, for the Leud, the Factions, and the Blockheads: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> longest Chapter in <HI>Deutoromy,</HI> has not Curses enough for an Anti-<HI>Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦mingham.</HI> My Comfort is, their manifest Prejudice to my Cause, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> render their Judgment of less Authority against me. Yet if a <HI>Poem</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a <HI>Genius,</HI> it will force its own reception in the World. For there's a sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ness in good Verse, which Tickles even while it Hurts: And no man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be heartily angry with him, who pleases him against his will. The Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦mendation of Adversaries, is the greatest Triumph of a Writer; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it never comes unless Extorted. But I can be satisfied on more easie term If I happen to please the more Moderate sort I shall be sure of an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Party; and, in all probability, of the best Judges: for the least C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦cern'd, are commonly the least Corrupt. And, I confess, I have laid for those, by relating the <HI>Satyr</HI> (where Justice would allow it) from ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rying too sharp an Edge. They, who can Criticize so weakly, as to im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gine I have done my worst, may be convinc'd, at their own Cost, that can write Severely, with more ease, than I can Gently. I have but laugh at some mens Follies. when I could have declaim'd against their Vice and, other mens Vertues I have commended, as freely as I have tax'd the Crimes. And now, if you are a Malicious <HI>Reader,</HI> I expect you should turn upon me, that I affect to be thought more Impartial than I am. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if men are not to be judg'd by their Professions, God forgive you <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦wealths-men,</HI> for Professing so plausible for the Government. You ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be so Unconscionable, as to charge me for not Subscribing of my Name; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that would reflect too grosly upon your own Party, who never dare; then they have the advantage of a Jury to secure them. If you like not <HI>Poem,</HI> the fault may, possibly, by in my Writing: (though 'tis hard an Author to judge against himself;) But more probably 'tis in y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Morals, which cannot bear the truth of it. The Violent, on both si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> will condemn the Character of <HI>Absalom,</HI> as either too favourably, or
<PB N="3" REF="86"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardly drawn. But they are not the Violent, whom I desire to please. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fault, on the right hand, is to Extenuate; Palliate and Indulge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, to confess freely. I have endeavoured to commit it. Besides the res∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct which I owe his Birth, I have a greater for his Heroick Virtues: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>David</HI> himself, could not be more tender of the Young man's Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an I would be of his Reputation. But, since the most excellent natures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e almost the most easie; and, as being such. are the soonest perverted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ill Counsels, especially when baited with Fame and Glory; 'tis no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of <HI>Achitophel,</HI> than was for <HI>Adam,</HI> not to have resisted the two Devils, the Serpent and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oman: The Conclusion of the Story, I purposely forbore to prosecute: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause, I could not obtain from my self, to shew <HI>Absalom</HI> Unfortunate. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Frame of it was cut out, but for a Picture to the Waste; and, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Draught be so far true, 'tis as much as I design'd.</P>
<P>Were I the Inventor, who am only the Historian, I should certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nclude the Piece, with the Reconcilement of <HI>Absalom</HI> to <HI>David.</HI> And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho knows but this may come to pass? Things were not brought to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtremity where I left the Story; There seems, yet, to be room left for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mposure; hereafter, there may be only be for Pity. I have not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch as an uncharitable wish against <HI>Achitophel;</HI> but, am content to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus'd of a good natur'd Error; and to hope with <HI>Origen,</HI> that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil himself may, at last, be sav'd. For which reason, in this <HI>Poem,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is neither brought to set his House in order, nor to dispose of his Person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>terwards, as he in Wisdom shall think fit. God is infinitely merciful: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his Vicegerent is only not so, because he is not Infinite.</P>
<P>The true end of <HI>Satyr,</HI> is the amendment of Vices by correction. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who writes Honestly, is no more an Enemy to the Offender, than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hysician to the Patient, when he prescribes harsh Remedies to an inve∣rate Disease: for those, are only in order to prevent the Chyrurgeon's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk of an <HI>Ense rescindendum,</HI> which I wish not to my very Enemies.

<HEAD>THE TEMPLE OF DEATH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN those cold Climates, where the Sun appears</L>
<L>Unwillingly, and hides his Face in Tears;</L>
<L>A dreadful Vale lies in a Desert Isle,</L>
<L>On which indulgent Heaven did never smile.</L>
<L>There a thick Grove of Aged Cypress Trees,</L>
<L>Which none without an awful horror sees,</L>
<L>Into its wither'd Arms, depriv'd of Leaves,</L>
<L>Whole Flocks of ill-presaging Birds receives:</L>
<L>Poisons are all the Plants the Soil will bear,</L>
<L>And Winter is the only Season there.</L>
<L>Millions of Graves cover the spacious Field,</L>
<L>And Springs of Blood a thousand Rivers yield;</L>
<L>Whose Streams opprest with Carcasses and Bones,</L>
<L>Instead of gentle Murmurs, pour forth Groans.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within this Vale a famous Temple stands,</L>
<L>Old as the World it self, which it commands:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="110"/>Round is its Figure, and four Iron Gates</L>
<L>Divide Mankind, by order of the Fates.</L>
<L>There come in Crouds, doom'd to one common Grave,</L>
<L>The Young, the old, the Monarch, and the Slave.</L>
<L>Old Age, and Pains, which Mankind most deplores,</L>
<L>Are faithful Keepers of those sacred Doors;</L>
<L>All clad in mournful Blacks, which also load</L>
<L>The sacred Walls of this obscure Abode;</L>
<L>And Tapers of a pitchy Substance made,</L>
<L>With Clouds of Smoak increase the dismal Shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Monster, void of Reason and of Sight,</L>
<L>The Goddess is, who sways this Realm of Night.</L>
<L>Her Power extends o'er all Things that have Breath;</L>
<L>A cruel Tyrant, and her Name is <HI>Death.</HI></L>
<L>The fairest Object of our wond'ring Eyes,</L>
<L>Was newly offer'd up her Sacrifice;</L>
<L>The adjoining Places where the Altar stood,</L>
<L>Yet blushing with the fair <HI>Almeria</HI>'s Blood.</L>
<L>When griev'd <HI>Orontes,</HI> whose unhappy Flame</L>
<L>Is known to all that e'er converse with Fame;</L>
<L>His Mind possest by Fury and Despair,</L>
<L>Within the Sacred Temple made this Prayer:</L>
<L><HI>Great Deity!</HI> Who in thy Hands do'st bear</L>
<L>That trusty Scepter, which poor Mortals fear;</L>
<L>Who wanting Eyes, thy self respectest none,</L>
<L>And neither spares the Laurel, nor the Crown!</L>
<L>Oh thou, whom all Mankind in vain withstands!</L>
<L>Each of whose Blood must one day stain thy Hands!</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="111"/>Oh thou, who every Eye which sees the Light,</L>
<L>Closest again in an Eternal Night!</L>
<L>Open thy Ears, and hearken to my Grief,</L>
<L>To which thy only Power can give Relief:</L>
<L>I come not hither to prolong my Fate,</L>
<L>But wish my wretched Life a shorter Date;</L>
<L>And that the Earth would in its Bowels hide</L>
<L>A Wretch, whom Heaven invades on every side:</L>
<L>That from the sight of Day I could remove,</L>
<L>And might have nothing left me but my Love.</L>
<L>Thou only Comforter of Minds opprest,</L>
<L>The Port, where wearied Spirits are at Rest;</L>
<L>Conductor to <HI>Elysium!</HI> take my Life;</L>
<L>My Breast I offer to thy Sacred Knife:</L>
<L>So just a Grace refuse not, nor despise</L>
<L>A willing, though a worthless Sacrifice.</L>
<L>Others their frail and mortal State forgot,</L>
<L>Before thy Altars are not to be brought</L>
<L>Without Constraint; the noise of dying Rage,</L>
<L>Heaps of the Slain of every Sex and Age,</L>
<L>The Blade all reeking in the Gore it shed,</L>
<L>With sever'd Arms confus'dly spread,</L>
<L>The Rapid Flames of a perpetual Fire,</L>
<L>The Groans of Wretches ready to expire:</L>
<L>This Tragick Scene makes them in Terror live,</L>
<L>Till that is forc'd which they should freely give,</L>
<L>Yielding unwillingly what Heaven will have,</L>
<L>Their Fears eclipse the Glory of their Grave.</L>
<L>Before thy Face they make undecent Moan,</L>
<L>And feel a hundred Deaths in fearing one;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="112"/>The flame becomes unhallow'd in their Breast,</L>
<L>And he a Murtherer, who was a Priest;</L>
<L>His Hands profan'd in breaking Nature's Chain,</L>
<L>By which the Body does the Soul detain:</L>
<L>But against me thy strongest Forces call,</L>
<L>And on my Head let all the Tempest fall;</L>
<L>No shrinking back shall any weakness shew,</L>
<L>And calmly I'll expect the fatal blow;</L>
<L>My Limbs not trembling, in my mind no fear,</L>
<L>Plaints in my Mouth, nor in my Eyes a Tear.</L>
<L>Think not that time, our wonted sure relief,</L>
<L>That universal Cure for every grief,</L>
<L>Whose Aid so many Lovers oft have found,</L>
<L>With like success can ever heal my wound;</L>
<L>Too weak's the Power of Nature, or of Art;</L>
<L>Nothing but Death can ease a broken heart.</L>
<L>And that thou mayst behold my helpless state,</L>
<L>Learn the extreamest rigor of my Fate.</L>
<L>Amidst th' innumerable beauteous Train,</L>
<L><HI>Paris</HI> the Queen of Cities, does contain,</L>
<L>The fairest Town, the largest, and the best,</L>
<L>So fair <HI>Almeria</HI> shin'd above the rest.</L>
<L>From her bright Eyes to feel a hopeless flame,</L>
<L>Was of our Youth the most ambitious aim;</L>
<L>Her Chains were marks of Honour to the brave,</L>
<L>She made a Prince whene'er she made a Slave.</L>
<L>Love under whose Tyrannick power I groan,</L>
<L>Shew'd me this Beauty e'er 'twas fully blown;</L>
<L>Her tim'rous charms, and her unpractis'd look,</L>
<L>Their first assurance from my Conquest took,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="113"/>By wounding me, she learnt the fatal Art,</L>
<L>And the first sigh she had, was from my heart;</L>
<L>My Eyes with Tears moist'ning her snowy Arms,</L>
<L>Render'd the Tribute owing to her Charms:</L>
<L>But as I soonest of all Mortals paid</L>
<L>My Vows, and to her Beauty, Altars made;</L>
<L>So among all those Slaves that sigh'd in vain,</L>
<L>She thought me only worthy of my Chain.</L>
<L>Love's heavy Burthen, my Submissive Heart</L>
<L>Endur'd not long, before she bore her part;</L>
<L>My violent flame melted her frozen Breast,</L>
<L>And in soft Sighs her Pity she exprest;</L>
<L>Her gentle Voice allay'd my raging Pains,</L>
<L>And her fair hands sustain'd me in my Chains;</L>
<L>Even Tears of Pity waited on my moan,</L>
<L>And tender Looks were cast on me alone▪</L>
<L>My hopes and dangers were less mine, than hers,</L>
<L>Those fill'd her Soul with Joys, and these with Fears:</L>
<L>Our hearts united, had the same desires,</L>
<L>And both alike, burn'd in impatient Fires.</L>
<L>Too faithful Memory! I give thee Leave</L>
<L>Thy wretched Master kindly to deceive;</L>
<L>Make me not once Possessor of her Charms;</L>
<L>Let me not find her languish in my Arms;</L>
<L>Past Joys are now my Fancies mournful Theams;</L>
<L>Make all my happy Nights appear but Dreams:</L>
<L>Let not that Bliss before my Eyes be brought:</L>
<L>Oh! hide those Scenes from my tormenting Thought,</L>
<L>And in their place, disdainful Beauty shew,</L>
<L>If thou would'st not be cruel, make her so;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="114"/>And something to abate my deep Despair,</L>
<L>Oh, let her seem less Gentle, or less Fair.</L>
<L>But I in vain, flatter my wounded Mind,</L>
<L>Never was Nymph so lovely or so Kind:</L>
<L>No cold Repulses, my Desires supprest,</L>
<L>I seldom sigh'd but on <HI>Almeria</HI>'s Breast;</L>
<L>Of all the Passions which Mankind destroy,</L>
<L>I only felt Excess of Love and Joy:</L>
<L>Numberless Pleasures charm'd my Sense, and they</L>
<L>Were as my Love, without the least Allay.</L>
<L>As pure, alas, but not so sure to last,</L>
<L>For like a pleassing Dream, they all are past.</L>
<L>From Heav'n her Beauty like fierce Light'ning came,</L>
<L>Which breaks thro' Darkness with its glorious Flame:</L>
<L>A while it shines, a while our Sight it chears,</L>
<L>But soon the short-liv'd Comfort disappears;</L>
<L>And Thunder follows, whose resistless Rage,</L>
<L>None can withstand, and nothing can asswage.</L>
<L>So oft the Light which those bright Flashes gave,</L>
<L>Serves only to conduct us to our Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When I had just begun Loves's Joys to taste,</L>
<L>(Those full Rewards for Fears and Dangers past)</L>
<L>A Fever seiz'd her, and to nothing brought</L>
<L>The richest Work that ever Nature wrought.</L>
<L>All Things below, alas, uncertain stand;</L>
<L>The firmest Rocks are fix'd upon the Sand:</L>
<L>Under this Law both Kings and Kingdoms bend,</L>

<L>O, Princess! and you Lords of <HI>Britain,</HI> hear</L>

<L>Has not Great <HI>France</HI>'s pow'rful Monarch seen</L>
<L><HI>Britain</HI> divided; <HI>Anna</HI> made their Queen?</L>
<L>What then remains for us to seek, but Peace?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At these base Words, the Queen in Passion rose,</L>
<L>And with becoming Zeal did thus oppose;</L>
<L>Tho' she was with the softest Nature blest,</L>
<L>Like sleeping Doves, when on their downy Rest.</L>
<L>For <HI>Europe</HI>'s Cause she was divinely fir'd,</L>

<L>Tho' War, of all our Evils, is the worst,</L>
<L>And brought on Man, when Man by Heav'n was curst;</L>
<L>Yet such the State of <HI>Britain</HI> is this day,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sought your Aid, knowing no other Way.</L>
<L>For <HI>Anna</HI> was expedient to maintain.</L>
<L>The Glories was expected from my Reign.</L>
<L>But wond'ring now I gaze with much Surprise,</L>
<L>And scarcely can believe the Object of my Eyes.</L>
<L>Is not that <HI>Maroc,</HI> Prince of <HI>British</HI> Blood?</L>
<L>That once for <HI>Britain</HI> like a Bulwark stood?</L>
<L>And can his Courage dwindle into Fear,</L>

<L>Have we not oft their boasting Courage try'd?</L>
<L>And triumph'd o'er that sawcy Monarch's Pride?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What have I heard pronounc'd from <HI>Maroc</HI>'s Tongue,</L>
<L>Of Peace, who always has of Battels sung?</L>
<L>What Peace from perjur'd <HI>Louis</HI> can we find?</L>
<L><HI>Louis,</HI> the Monster of the Monarch-kind.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="152"/>Has he not all his Ties of Friendship broke,</L>

<L>But only kept it for his Soldiers Ease?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this a general Murmur fill'd the Room,</L>
<L>Like whistling Winds, that from deep Caverns com</L>
<L>When strait, behold thro' all the secred Place,</L>
<L><HI>Consent</HI> sate chearfully on ev'ry Face;</L>
<L>And ev'ry One now strove to loose his Tongue</L>
<L>To <HI>Anna,</HI> then to <HI>Marlbro'</HI> make their Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who can forget, O Queen! the happy Day</L>
<L>Thou bless'd our <HI>Isarel</HI> with thy glorious Sway?</L>
<L>When <HI>Britain</HI> slept, thou sav'd us from our Foes,</L>
<L>And as our leading Star, at Midnight rose.</L>
<L>Heav'n did it self in bright Apparel dress,</L>
<L>And tuneful Angels sung soft Hymns of Peace</L>
<L>In dancing Airs, Stars from their Spheres were sent,</L>
<L>And springing Joy spread o'er your Royal Tent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why then should we ungratefully oppose</L>
<L>Our Royal Mistress? Why her Favours lofe,</L>
<L>Who such vast Bounties on her Land bestows?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since <HI>Marlbro'</HI> is the Man by Heav'n decred,</L>
<L><HI>Anna</HI> no more shall frown, or <HI>Marlbro'</HI> bleed;</L>
<L>For if nor Heav'n, nor yet the Queen had said,</L>
<L><HI>Marlbro'</HI> should lead out <HI>Europe</HI> as their Head,</L>

<L>Give Life and Edge so keen no surly Care</L>
<L>Wou'd venture to assault my Soul, or dare</L>
<L>Near my Retreat to hide one secret Snare.</L>
<L>But so Divine, so Noble a Repast,</L>
<L>I'd seldom, and with Moderation taste.</L>
<L>For highest Cordials all their Virtue lose,</L>
<L>By a too frequent, and too bold an use;</L>
<L>And what would cheer the Spirits in distress▪</L>
<L>Ruins our Health when taken to Excess.</L>
<L>I'd be concern'd in no litigious Jarr,</L>
<L>Belov'd by all, not vainly popular:</L>
<L>Whate'er Assistance I had power to bring</L>
<L>T' oblige my Country, or to serve my King,</L>
<L>Whene'er they call'd, I'd readily afford,</L>
<L>My Tongue, My Pen, my Counsel, or my Sword.</L>
<L>Law-suits I'd shun with as much Studious Care;</L>
<L>As I wou'd Dens where hungry Lyons are;</L>
<L>And rather put up Injuries than be</L>
<L>A Plague to him, who'd be a plague to me.</L>
<L>I value Quiet at a Price too great,</L>
<L>To give for my Revenge so dear a Rate:</L>
<L>For what do we by all our bustle gain,</L>
<L>But counterfeit Delight for real Pain.</L>
<L>If Heav'n a date of many Years wou'd give,</L>
<L>Thus I'd in Pleasure, Ease and Plenty live.</L>
<L>And as I near approach'd the Verge of Life,</L>
<L>Some kind Relation (for I'd have no Wife.)</L>
<L>Should take upon him all my Worldly Care,</L>
<L>While I did for a better State prepare.</L>
<L>Then I'd not be with any Trouble vext,</L>
<L>Nor have the Evening of my Days perplext.</L>
<L>But by a silent, and a peaceful Death,</L>
<L>Without a sigh Resign my Aged Breath:</L>
<L>And when committed to the Dust, I'd have</L>
<L>Few Tears, but Frindly drop'd into my Grave.</L>
<L>Then wou'd my Exit so propitious be,</L>
<L>All Men wou'd wish to live and dye like me.</L>

<L>Her sallow Cheeks her envious Mind did show,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd every Feature spoke aloud the Curstness of a Shrew.</L>

<L>Ah Nymph! more cruel than of humane Race,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AT a Time when we are Celebrating the Successes of our Arms Abro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Wisdom of our Councils at Home; when there seems to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no room left for Complaints, and the Nation is only prepared to receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Panegyrick; I am sensible a Piece of this kind will be severely Censur'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> For those, that are taken up with the present appearances of Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who are, by much the greatest part of the World, will be apt to say is Ʋnseasonable at least, if not False and Malicious. But, I hope, othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who are not content with such superficial Views, (and to such only wou'd write) will see the Reason and Truth of what I have said, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own that it could not be more Seasonably Ʋtter'd than at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Juncture, when we are lull'd with too much Security, and by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> means may give Opportunity to a <HI>New Sett of Men</HI> to Ruin bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Church and State with their <HI>New</HI> Politicks. But if this Poem ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out with all the Advantages imaginable, I am not yet grown so Erra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> an Author, as to think because the <HI>First Part</HI> met with a favourab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Reception, that I am now therefore Privileg'd to Dictate to the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der's Judgment, and to ascribe to my own Merit what was only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to his Candour, or perhaps Partiality. Be that the Business <HI>DEDICATING POETS.</HI> I have no Ambition of gai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the Reputation of one. 'Tis the last Thing I should desire.</P>
<P>My Aim is of another sort, and I am abundantly Rewarded, if have been able to Contribute any thing to the Publick Service, by D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tecting the Principles and Practices of this <HI>New Party,</HI> who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Assum'd to themselves a very Specious Name and Character, and wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be thought the only Patriots of their Country. But False Friends a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most Dangerous Enemies, and they are yet much more so, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are Invested with Power, and the Ministration of Affairs who put into their Hands.</P>
<P>'Tis to be wish'd there were no Occasion for Invectives of this kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Great Men did always Execute their Trusts, and perform the Duty, and were only the Objects of our Esteem and Admiration. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when the Case is quite otherwise, when they become Treacherous a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Betray the Authority Delegated to them; 'tis fit they shou'd hear their Faults, and the People be undeceiv'd, who are grosly impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon by the servile Flatteries of <HI>Hireling Scriblers.</HI> A Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="233"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Animals, that always Infest the Doors of Men in Power; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' one wou'd think their Trash could never pass upon the <HI>Moderate,</HI> the Grave, and the Wife, yet they are sometimes thought worthy of Pensions, and Places of <HI>1200</HI> l. a Year.</P>
<P>It is indeed the just Prerogative of the Throne to be approach'd with Humility and Petitions, even where the Subjects have Grievances to Represent. But I know of no such Homage due to its Officers. Nor can I yet be convinced, that it is an Arrogant Presumption in private Persons (as some wou'd have it) to examine and censure the Actions of Publick Ministers, who (say they) being nearest the Helm, are consequently best able to judge of what ought, and ought not to be done; whereas Men in a Remote Sphere, and at a distance, cannot possibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter into the Councils of State, and must therefore determine rashly, and without knowledge. This is a Doctrine necessary to be Preach'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p in Despotick and Arbitrary Governments, where all is Transacted in the Cabinet, where the Will and Choice of the Prince gives a San∣ction to his Creatures, and cannot be controverted without Treason. But in a mixt and limited Monarchy, where the deepest Resorts of Policy and Turns of Government are in some measure known to Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Rank and Condition, and where a right of Impeachment is lodged in the House of Commons, it can never be maintained; for that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rou'd destroy the Constitution, and render the Accusation of Great Of∣ficers, tho' never so Guilty, Impracticable. But I would not here be suppos'd to countenance that Scandalous Principle <HI>of Appealing to the Mob.</HI> I leave such Maxims to the <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Friends</HI> of a <HI>certain Lawyer,</HI> who at the <HI>Observator's</HI> Tryal had the <HI>Impu∣dence</HI> (as the <HI>Attorney-General</HI> very justly called it) to insinuate that <HI>the Crown was in the Disposal of the People.</HI> Nor wou'd I be thought in the least to detract from the Prerogative, which no Man living has in higher Veneration than my self. For I think it never violated but by a profligate abandon'd Nation, and I wish, for the Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Name, our Annals had Recorded no In∣stances of that kind.</P>
<P>But after all this <HI>New-Moderation Policy</HI> is not more pernici∣ous and tending to the Destruction of the Government, than it is Ab∣sur'd and Ridiculous in it self. For how can Men of Ʋnderstanding pretend to look Two Ways at once, to blow Hot and Cold, and fancy that every Body does not see thro' the pitiful Disguise and Artifice? They call themselves True Sons of the Church, and yet make no scruple of opposing a <HI>Bill,</HI> which is absolutely necessary for its Preservation; because forsooth it is offered at an unseasonable time; as if it was not as seasonable to make wholesom Laws, as to engage in a just and
<PB REF="234"/>
Honourable War for the Security of our Constitution; Can they hope for a better Opportunity than the Reign we now enjoy? They would be thought great Favourers of the <HI>Church Party,</HI> when upon all Oc∣casions they take care to Discountenance them, and Encourage only the <HI>Profest Enemies</HI> of Church and State, under a shallow Pretence, that they are a numerous and formidable Body of Men, and ought there∣fore to be preferr'd to Places of Honour and Profit, that they may not grow Mutinous and complain of <HI>Persecution;</HI> which methinks should rather be a strong Argument for using all possible Means to suppress such Turbulent Aspiring Spirits. Nay, so Tender are they of their <HI>DIS∣SENTING BRETHREN,</HI> that I am told it has lately been deliver'd as Law by a <HI>Great Man</HI> in <HI>W—————————r-Hall, that a Notorious Perjur'd Vagabond, with Two Wives at once, be¦ing possess'd of a Separate Congregation, tho' without any Li∣cence, or Legal Qualification to Preach to them, shall for that Reason only be exempt from the late Act for listing Vagrants.</HI> I must confess I cannot imagine how they would define it, or what <HI>Mo∣deration</HI> according to these Practices is. The <HI>Logicians</HI> have stated no <HI>Medium</HI> that I know of, between Truth and Falshood, nor the <HI>Moralists</HI> any between Virtue and Vice: Every Proposition and Prin∣ciple must necessarily fall under one of these Heads.</P>
<P>There is no need of a Prophetick Spirit to foresee, That they will ren∣der themselves Odious, and cannot Subsist long. I heartily Pity some young Gentlemen, who are unwarily drawn in; for they will fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> themselves Deceiv'd by their <HI>Crafty Leader,</HI> and cannot expect to be receiv'd by their old Friends again. 'Tis much to be Lamented that a late <HI>Great Character</HI> Stain'd the latter part of his Life.— but <HI>De Mortuis nil nisi bonum.</HI></P>
<P>I hope some Paragraphs in the close of his Poem will at least prove that I have not writ with Partiality, but have equally commende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Merit whereever I found it, without any regard to a Party.</P>

<L>AGain, my Muse—Nor fear the steepy Flight,</L>
<L>Pursue the Fury thro' the Realms of Night;</L>
<L>Explore the Depth of Hell, the secret Cause,</L>
<L>Whence the New Scheme of <HI>Moderation</HI> rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now <HI>Faction</HI> re-assum'd her Native Throne,</L>
<L>Which prostrate Fiends with awful Homage own.</L>
<L>A Crown of Eating Flame her Temples bound,</L>
<L>Darting a Blew Malignant Radiance round.</L>
<L>An Iron Scepter in her Hand she bore,</L>
<L>Emblem of Vengeance and Destructive Pow'r.</L>
<L>A bloody Canopy hung o're her Head,</L>
<L>Where the <HI>Four</HI> falling <HI>Empires</HI> are pourtray'd.</L>
<L>Monarchs Depos'd beneath her foot-stool lie,</L>
<L>And all around is Hell and Anarchy.</L>
<L>Whilst thus she tow'ring sat, the Subject Train</L>
<L>With Shouts proclaim'd the Triumphs of her Reign.</L>
<L>Then they the Chaos sung, and Nature's Jars,</L>
<L>How the first Atoms urg'd their <HI>Medley</HI> Wars,</L>
<L>How Civil Discord and Intestine Rage</L>
<L>Have boil'd in ev'ry Nation, ev'ry Age.</L>
<L>They sung Divided <HI>Albion</HI>'s hapless State,</L>
<L>Her Clashing Senate's Feuds, her lab'ring Church's Fate:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="236"/>And as her coming Ruin they exprest,</L>
<L>A sullen Rapture swell'd in ev'ry Breast.</L>
<L>For such the Bent of their Distorted Will,</L>
<L>Only to know Delight in Thoughts of ill.</L>
<L>But on a sudden, Lo! descending flew,</L>
<L>A Meagre Ghost, which soon the Fury knew,</L>
<L><HI>Cethego</HI> newly Dead, her Darling Pride,</L>
<L>Whose Firm Unwav'ring Faith she long had try'd,</L>
<L>Long in her Secret Councils had retain'd,</L>
<L>By which her Empire o're our Isle she gain'd.</L>
<L>No sooner was arriv'd the Welcome Guest,</L>
<L>But him in soothing Terms, she thus addrest:</L>
<L>Hail best Belov'd of all my Sons, Receive</L>
<L>What Praise, what Joy these Gloomy Realms can give</L>
<L>For 'tis to thy Successful Arts I owe</L>
<L>My Reign Above, my Triumph here below.</L>
<L>This said, th' Unbodied Shade obsequious kneel'd,</L>
<L>Struck with Amazement, and with Rapture fill'd.</L>
<L>O Mighty Queen! permit me to Adore</L>
<L>Thy Awful Shrine, thy all Informing Pow'r,</L>
<L>Whose nearer Influence my Breast Inspires</L>
<L>With Glorious Rage, and Mischievous Desires.</L>
<L>'Twas in Thy Cause I sunk a mouldring Frame,</L>
<L>Unequal to the Hardy Task of Fame.</L>
<L>But still my Mind releas'd from Mortal pains,</L>
<L>Her innate Faculty of Ill retains.</L>
<L>More he had said, but the surrounding Throng,</L>
<L>Impatient of delay, pursu'd their Noisy Song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean time the Fiend revolving in her Thought</L>
<L>The mighty Change <HI>Cethego's</HI> Death had wrought,</L>
<L>Resolv'd at length to Summon to her Aid</L>
<L>Each plotting Devil, each Seditious Shade.</L>
<L>She gave the Signal, and a Dreadful Sound</L>
<L>Ran Bellowing thro' all th' Abyss profound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then thus she eas'd her anxious Soul—</L>
<L>O dearest Friends! O faithful Ministers!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="237"/>Ye mutual Partners of my Joys and Cares,</L>
<L>New Ways, new Means my restless Thoughts imploy,</L>
<L>How <HI>Albion</HI> to reduce, her Peace destroy.</L>
<L>Long have I labour'd, but alas! in vain,</L>
<L>For now Succeeds the Heav'nly <HI>Anna's</HI> Reign;</L>
<L>Who watchful Guards a Stubborn People's Good,</L>
<L>By Fears not stagger'd, nor by Force subdu'd.</L>
<L>Such are the Gifts of her Capacious Mind,</L>
<L>Where Justice, Mercy, Piety are joyn'd.</L>
<L>As Motion, Light and Heat, combin'd in one,</L>
<L>Make up the Glorious Essence of the Sun.</L>
<L>But still she Mortal is, nor will I cease.</L>
<L>Till my Revenge be Crown'd with wish'd Success.</L>
<L>First then, suppose we shou'd devest the Throne</L>
<L>Of Friends, whose Souls are kindred to her own,</L>
<L><HI>Celsus</HI> Disgrac'd, <HI>Hortensio</HI> next appears,</L>
<L>Whose Vigilance still Baffles all my Cares;</L>
<L>To whom by Right of Ancestry belong</L>
<L>A Loyal Heart, and a perswasive Tongue.</L>
<L>Now Plots are form'd, and publick Tempests rowl,</L>
<L>He boasts a strong unshaken Strength of Soul.</L>
<L>Fearless against her Foes the Church sustains,</L>
<L>Alike their Friendship and their Hate disdains,</L>
<L>Disdains their Clamour and Seditious Noise,</L>
<L>Secure in the Applauding Senate's Voice.</L>
<L>Of Noble Stem, in whose <HI>Collat'ral</HI> Lines</L>
<L>Virtue with equal Force and Lustre shines.</L>

and contradictory to the Rules and Example<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all Fables, and to the very Design an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ʋse of them? They were first begun and rai∣sed to the highest Perfection in the <HI>Easter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Countries; where they wrote in Signs an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spoke in Parables, and delivered the mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> useful Precepts in delightful Stories; whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for their Aptness were entertaining to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most Judicious, and led the vulgar into Ʋn∣derstanding by surprizing them with thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Novelty, and fixing their Attention. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Fables carry a double meaning; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Story is one and intire; the Characters th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same throughout, not broken or chang'd and always conformable to the Nature of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Creatures they introduce. They never te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you that the Dog which snapt at a Shadow lost his Troop of Horse, that would be unin∣telligible; a piece of Flesh is proper for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to drop, and the Reader will apply it t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mankind; they would not say that the Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who was so proud of her borrow'd Plume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lookt very ridiculous when <HI>Rodriguez</HI> cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and took away all the Book but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>17th, 24th,</HI> and <HI>25th</HI> Chapters, which sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stole from him: But this is his new way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> telling a Story, and confounding the <HI>Mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and the <HI>Fable</HI> together.</P>

<P><PB REF="250"/>What relation has the <HI>Hind</HI> to our Sa∣viour? or what Notion have we of a <HI>Pan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her</HI>'s Bible? If you say he means the Church, how does the Church feed on Lawns, or range in the Forest? Let it be always a Church, or always the cloven-footed Beast, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or we cannot bear his shifting the Scene every Line. If it is absurd in Comedies to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake a Peasant talk in the Strain of a <HI>Hero,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a Country Wench use the Language of the Court; how monstrous is it to make a Priest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a Hind, and a Parson of a Panther? To bring 'em in disputing with all the For∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alities and Terms of the School? Though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to the Arguments themselves, those, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onfess, are suited to the Capacity of the Beasts, and if we would suppose a Hind ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressing her self about these Matters, she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould talk at that Rate.</P>
<P>As to the Absurdity of his Expressions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is nothing wrested to make 'em ridi∣culous, the Terms are sometimes alter'd to make the Blunder more visible; <HI>Knowldge misunderstood</HI> is not at all better Sense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han <HI>Understanding misunderstood,</HI> though tis confest the Author can play with words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o well, that this and twenty such will pass off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a slight reading.</P>
<P>There are other Mistakes which could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought in, for they were too gross for
<PB REF="251"/>
<HI>Bayes</HI> himself to commit. 'Tis hard to con∣ceive how any Man could censure the <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for Gluttony, a People that debauch in Coffee are voluptuous in a Mess of Rice, and keep the strictest <HI>Lent,</HI> without the Pleasures of a <HI>Carnival</HI> to encourage them. But 'tis al∣most impossible to think that any Man, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had not renounced his Senses, should rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Duncomb</HI> for <HI>Allen:</HI> He had been told that Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> had written a Discourse o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Humility;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference betwixt a Protestant and <HI>Socini∣an,</HI> p. 62.</NOTE> to which he wisely answers, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that magnified Piece of <HI>Duncomb</HI>'s was Tran∣slated from the <HI>Spanish</HI> of <HI>Rodriguez,</HI> and to set it beyond dispute, makes the infallible Guide affirm the same thing. There are few Mistakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 92.</NOTE> but one may imagine how a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fell into them, and at least what he aim'd at; but what likeness is there betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Duncomb</HI> and <HI>Allen?</HI> do they so much as Rhime?</P>
<P>We may have this Comfort under the Se∣verity of his Satyr, to see his Abilities e∣qually lessen'd with his Opinion of us; and that he could not be a fit Champion against the <HI>Panther</HI> till he had laid aside all his Judgment. But we must applaud his Obe∣dience to his new Mother <HI>Hind;</HI> she <HI>Disci∣plin'd</HI> him severely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 90.</NOTE> she commanded him it seems, to <HI>Sacrifice</HI> his <HI>Darling Fame,</HI> and to do it effectually he publisht this learned Piece. This is the favourable Construction we would put on his Faults, tho' he takes
<PB REF="252"/>
care to inform us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pref.</NOTE> that it was done from no Imposition, but out of a natural Propensity he has to Malice, and a particular Inclina∣tion of doing Mischief. What else could pro∣voke him to <HI>Libel the Court,</HI> Blaspheme <HI>Kings,</HI> abuse the whole <HI>Scotch Nation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 87.</NOTE> rail at the greatest Part of his own, and lay all the Indignities imaginable on the only esta∣blish'd Religion? And we must now Congra∣tulate him this Felicity, that there is no Sect or Denomination of Christians, whom he has not abused.</P>
<P><HI>Thus far his Arms have with Success been crown'd.</HI></P>
<P>Let <HI>Turks, Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> look to themselves, he has already begun the War upon them. When once a Conqueror grows thus dreadful, 'tis the Interest of all his Neighbours to oppose him, for there is no Alliance to be made with one that will face about, and destroy his Friends, and like a second <HI>Almanzor,</HI> change Sides meerly to keep his hand in ure. This Heroick Tem∣per of his, has created him some Enemies, that did by no means affect Hostility; and he may observe this Candor in the Manage∣ment, that none of his Works are concern'd in these Papers, but his last Piece; and I believe he is sensible this is a Favour. I was not ambitious of Laughing at any Per∣swasion, or making Religion the Subject of
<PB REF="253"/>
such a Trifle; so that no Man is here con¦cern'd, but the Author himself, and nothing ridicul'd but his way of arguing.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, if you won't take it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you must grant my Excuse is more reasonabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than our Author's to the Dissenters.</P>

<L>In which he plenteously did fare,</L>
<L>Assuming quite another Air.</L>
<L>The Neighbours thought, when this they spy'd,</L>
<L>The World well mended on his side.</L>

<L>They little thought, that saw him come,</L>
<L>That <HI>Robins</HI> were so quarrelsome:</L>

<HEAD>A LETTER to a Gentleman in the University.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes to Congratulate You on the agree∣able News of some late extraordinary Successes, which have bless'd the Arms of Her Majesty, and Her Allies. I leave you to the Printed Papers for a particular Account of those Actions, which have surpriz'd the World; and, we hope, given the last Stroke to the languishing Power of the Common Ene∣my of <HI>Europe.</HI> They will furnish noble Topics for the Wits of an Ʋniversity, like yours, who can embellish (if that can be done) the Glories of a <HI>Female Reign</HI> with a juster Sublimity of Verse, than what you will find in the following Performance, which was written several Months ago, and not run over with a hasty Negligence. The Ode, from whence I take my Hint, is accounted by some Critics not inferior to the <HI>4</HI>th of the same Book, which begins thus,
<Q>Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem, &amp;c.</Q>
And was written in Complement to <HI>Augustus,</HI> on oc∣casion of a famous Victory gain'd by <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as this, which I have aim'd to imitate, was written on the Praise of <HI>Claudius Nero.</HI> I need not inform Men of your Reading and Letters what occasion'd both. The Poet, as he does in almost all his Odes, has shewn a peculiar Artfulness and Elegance, and turns all the Panegyric on the Emperor (who was not in the Action) with <HI>Te concilium, &amp; tuos Praebente Divos.</HI> If You ask wherein I have trod in the Steps of <HI>Horace,</HI> You will find it in the Beginning. I have only kept him in view, and used him only where he was serviceable
<PB REF="336"/>
to my Design. He took the same liberty with <HI>Alcaeus,</HI> as appears from some Fragments of that <HI>Greek</HI> Lyriac, quoted by <HI>Athenaeus.</HI> In my Digressions and Transitions I have taken care to play always in sight, and make eve∣ry one of them contribute to my main Design. This was the Way of <HI>Pindar,</HI> to read whom, according to <HI>Rapin,</HI> will give a truer Idea of the Ode, than all the Rules and Reflections of the best Critics. I will not pretend to have div'd into him over Head and Ears, but I have endeavour'd to have made my self not the greatest Stranger to his Manner of Writing; which generally consists in the Dignity of the Sentiments, and an ele∣gant Variety, which makes the Reader rise up with greater Satisfaction than he sat down. And that which affects the Mind in Compositions of any sort, will never be disagreeable to a Gentleman of Ingenuity and Judg∣ment. I have avoided Turns, as thinking that they de∣base the Loftiness of the Ode. You will easily perceive whether I have reach'd that <HI>acer Spiritus &amp; Vis,</HI> re∣commended by <HI>Horace,</HI> as the Genius of Poetry. Whe∣ther you will call the following Lines a <HI>Pindaric</HI> Ode, or Irregular Stanza's, gives me no Disturbance: For however the seeming Wildness of this sort of Verse ought to be restrain'd, the <HI>Strophe, Antistrophe,</HI> &amp;c. will never bear in English, and it would shew a strange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Debauchery in our Taste, if it should, as may be wit∣nessed by the servile Imitation of the Dactyles and Spondees used by Sir <HI>P. Sidney.</HI> But to make an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of this tedious Epistle; you will see thro' the Whole, that Her MAJESTY is the Chief Heroine of the Ode; and the Moral, at the End, shews the solid Glo∣ries of a Reign which is not founded on a pretended Justice, or Criminal Magnanimity.</P>

<P>FOR to whom can I dedicate this <HI>Poem,</HI> with so much Justice as to you? 'T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Representation of your own Heroe: 'tis th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Picture drawn at length, which you prize and admire so much i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little.

But all Men, who can see an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

That it is necessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y for Men in your Circumstances to pretend both, is granted you; for without them there could be no ground to raise a Faction. But I would ask you one civil Question, what right has any Man among you, or any Association of Men, (to come nearer to you,) who out of Parliament, cannot be consider'd in a publick Capacity, to meet, as you daily do, in Factious Clubs, to vilify the Government in your Discourses, and to libel it in all your Writings? Who made you Judges in <HI>Isra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l?</HI> Or how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it consistent with your Zeal of the Publick Welfare, to promote Se∣dition? Does your Definition of Loy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, which is to serve the King ac∣cording to the Laws, allow you the Licence of traducing the Executive Power, with which you own he is invested? You complain that his Ma∣jesty has lost the Love and Confidence of his People; and by your very urging it, you endeavour what in you lies, to make him lose them. All g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od subjects abhor the thought of Arbitrary Power, whether it be in one or many: if you were the Patriots you would seem, you would not at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate incense the Multit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de to assume it; for no sober Man can fear it, either from the King's Disposition, or his Practice; or even, where you would odiously lay it, from his Ministers. Give us leave to enjoy the Government and the Benefit of Laws under which we were born, and which we desire to transmit to our Posterity. You are not the Trustees of the publick Liberty: and if you have not right to peti∣tion in a Croud, much less have you to intermeddle in the Management of Affairs; or to arraign what you do not like: which in effect is every thing that is done by the King and Council Can you imagine that any reasonable Man will believe you respect the Person of his Majesty, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apparent that your Seditious Pamphlets are stuff'd w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th particular Reflections on him?

<L>BLESS us! how silent is the noisy Gown?</L>
<L>How quiet are the <HI>Temples, Park,</HI> and Town?</L>
<L>As if <HI>Astraea</HI> (Great in <HI>Anna</HI>'s Reign)</L>
<L>Had banish'd Law to some deserted Plain.</L>
<L>No Gouty J—ce sits upon the Bench,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndulgent to a Bottle and a Wench;</L>
<L>Altho' his Rev'rend Garb, and Brow severe,</L>
<L>Promise his Morals, and his Sould austere.</L>
<L>Now sacred Peace, finds a secure Retreat</L>
<L>Where Laws and Justice held their awful Seat:</L>
<L>Not on Demurrers now the Serjeants drudge,</L>
<L>Nor crabbed Pleas detain the hungry Judge.</L>
<L>Each S— now may rest in Elbow-Chair</L>
<L>His veterane Limbs, broke with nocturnal Care,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n turning over Volumes, and the Fair.</L>
<L>No knotty Doubts his solid Ease beguile,</L>
<L>His Rev'rend <HI>Coke</HI> the dusty Cobwebs spoil:</L>
<L>Grave <HI>Littleton,</HI> and <HI>Leveing</HI> too, lie idle,</L>
<L>He reads them now no oftner than the <HI>Bible.</HI></L>
<L>The jangling Laws, tho' insolently rude,</L>
<L>Dare not upon his peaceful Hours intrude.</L>
<L>Wine chears his Soul, and his obliging Eyes</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew he's not dead to charming Mistresses;</L>
<L>Tho' at the Bar, in Term you'd hardly think,</L>
<L>That he had Pow'r enough to whore or drink;</L>
<L>But that the charming Beauties of the Fair,</L>
<L>Were far above his Notice, or his Care,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Furrows in his aged Cheeks appear:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="394"/>Yet ho's his Looks, an Air most solemn shew,</L>
<L>His powder'd Wig discovers he's a Beau;</L>
<L>And that when serious Business don't intrude,</L>
<L>His Worship can be both gallant and lewd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THe <HI>C—t</HI>'s <HI>Kitchin,</HI> as his Brains is cold,</L>
<L>No longer now litigious Crowds make bold</L>
<L>To knock him up, and buy their Peace with Gold.</L>
<L>No more he sees his Chambers like a Fair,</L>
<L>Of Clients full, and nev'r a Pauper there.</L>
<L>No longer now he props with noblest Wines</L>
<L>His Age, and at the <HI>Devil</HI> sups and dines.</L>
<L>Nor does the Porter light him to his Bed</L>
<L>'Twixt Twelve and One, by trusty Drawers led.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Petty-fogger, who keeps such a House</L>
<L>Would starve a Church, or ancient College Mouse,</L>
<L>Hangs down his Ears, and now begins to miss</L>
<L>His sumptuous Meals, and Term-time Luxuries:</L>
<L>Just as his Looks, so does his Purse grow thin,</L>
<L>Paleness without, and Emptiness within.</L>
<L>Quickly he thinks it prudent to repair</L>
<L>To some convenient Seat for Country Air;</L>
<L>Carrying himself with Paultry present down,</L>
<L>His Board he spunges on some Rural Clown,</L>
<L>'Till the kind Term returns him to the Town.</L>
<L>Trusting in Impudence, which seldom fails,</L>
<L>Some silvane Nymph, perchance, the Fop assails.</L>
<L>The ruddy Maid at first receives his Flame,</L>
<L>And vows her Spark's <HI>a pretty Gentleman</HI>;</L>
<L>Tho' whatsoe'er he to his Mistress says,</L>
<L>Is stoll'n from <HI>D'Urfey</HI>'s, or from <HI>Settle</HI>'s Plays:</L>
<L>In vain he shews th' abundance of his Sense,</L>
<L>And charms the Fair with borrow'd Eloquence▪</L>
<L>For soon malicious Fortune makes it clear,</L>
<L>That he's som paultry tricking <HI>Wappineer:</HI></L>
<L>Good Gods! how dull his Courtship is! How lame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>How soon he quits his bold presumptuous Flame!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="395"/>Wing'd with Disgrace, he flies the Hills and Groves,</L>
<L>And Vallies, conscious of his slighted Loves;</L>
<L>He hastes to Town, there meets what he deserves,</L>
<L>And twice two Months the Scoundrel Scribler starves;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Till the returning Winter chears the Laws,</L>
<L>And the glad Term, a Scene of Business draws.</L>
<L>Thus, when the Woods, by some Autumnal Blast,</L>
<L>Their verdant Leaves, and shady Honours cast,</L>
<L>The sick'ning Trees, their ravish'd Beauties mourn,</L>

<L>Thaws Nature's Bolts, and soon unlocks the Streams:</L>
<L>His vital Heat, the flowing Rills enlarge,</L>

<L>So at th' Appearance of the blooming Spring,</L>

<L>From <HI>Will</HI>'s and <HI>Tom</HI>'s, the well-dress'd Youths are fled,</L>
<L>And Silence there with Poppies binds her Head.</L>
<L>To Country Seats the Men of Sense go down,</L>
<L>And for their rural Joys neglect the Town.</L>
<L>Some few sham Battles bellow'd out at Night,</L>
<L>And Apparitions now the Mob affright.</L>
<L>Commets and Armies, fighting in the Air,</L>

<HEAD>LUCRETIUS A POEM AGAINST The Fear of Death</HEAD>
<L>WHat has this Bugbear Death to frighten Man,</L>
<L>If Souls can die, as well as Bodies can?</L>
<L>For, as before our Birth we felt no Pain</L>
<L>When punick Arms infested Land and Main,</L>
<L>When Heav'n and Earth were in Confusion hurl'd</L>
<L>For the debated Empire of the World,</L>
<L>Which aw'd with dreadful Expectation lay,</L>
<L>Sure to be Slaves, uncertain who shou'd sway:</L>
<L>So, when our mortal Frame shall be disjoyn'd,</L>
<L>The lifeless Lump, uncoupled from the Mind,</L>
<L>From Sense of Grief and Pain we shall be free;</L>
<L>We shall not feel, because we shall not <HI>Be.</HI></L>
<L>Though Earth in Seas, and Seas in Heav'n were lost,</L>
<L>We shou'd not move, we only shou'd be tost.</L>
<L>Nay, ev'n suppose when we have suffer'd Fate,</L>
<L>The Soul cou'd feel in her divided state,</L>
<L>What's that to us, for we are only we</L>
<L>While Souls and Bodies in one Frame agree?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="423"/>Nay, tho' our Atoms shou'd revolve by chance,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Matter leap into the former Dance;</L>
<L>Tho' time our Life and Motion cou'd restore,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd make our Bodies what they were before.</L>
<L>What Gain to us wou'd all this bustle bring,</L>
<L>The new made Man wou'd be another thing;</L>

<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the EARL of <HI>ABINGDON,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commands, with which You honour'd me some Months ago, are now perform'd: They had been sooner; but betwixt ill Health, some Business, and many Troubles, I was forc'd to deferr them till this time. <HI>Ovid,</HI> going to this Banish∣ment, and Writing from on Ship-board to his Friends, ex∣cus'd the Faults of his Poetry by his Misfortunes; and told them, that good Verses never flow, but from a serene and compos'd Spirit. Wit, which is a kind of <HI>Mercury,</HI> with Wings fasten'd to his Head and Heels, can fly but slowly, in a damp Air. I therefore chose rather to Obey You late, than ill: if at least I am capable of writing any thing▪ at any time, which is worthy Your Perusal and Your Patronage. I cannot say that I have escap'd from a Shipwreck; but have only gain'd a Rock by hard swimming; where I may pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a while and gather Breath: For the Doctors give me a sad Assurance that my Disease never took its leave of any Man, but with a purpose to return. However, my Lord, I have laid hold on the Interval, and manag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the small Stock which Age has left me, to the best Advantage, in performing this inconside∣rable Service to my Lady's Memory. We, who are Priests of <HI>Apollo,</HI> have not the Inspiration when we please; but must wait till the God comes rushing on us, and invades us with a Fury, which we are not able to resist: which gives us double Strength while the Fit continues, and leaves us languishing and spent, at its Departure. Let me not seem to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, my Lord; for I have really felt it on this Occasion; and prophe∣cy'd beyond my natural Power. Let me add, and hope to be believ'd, that the Excellency of the Subject contributed much to the Happiness of the Execution: And that the weight of thirty Years was taken off me, while I was writing. I swom with the Tide, and the Water under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was buoyant. The Reader will easily observe that I was transported, by the Multitude and Variety of my Similitudes; which are generally the Product of a luxuriant Fancy; and the Wantonness of Wit. Had I call'd in my Judgment to my Assistance, I had certainly retrench'd many of them. But I defend them not; let them pass for beautiful Faults amongst the better sort of Criticks. For the whole Poem, though writ∣ten in that which they call Heroick Verse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Pind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rick Nature, as well in the Thought as the Expression; and as such, requires the same Grains of Allowance for it. It was intended, as your Lordship sees in the Title, not for an Elegy, but a Panegyrick. A kind of Apotheosis, indeed; if a Heathen Word may be applyed to a Christian Use. And on all Occasions of Praise, if we take the Ancients for our Patterns, we are
<PB N="4" REF="439"/>
bound by Prescription to employ the Magnificence of Words, and the force of Figures, to adorn the Sublimity of Thoughts. <HI>Isocrates</HI> amongst the <HI>Grecian</HI> Orators, and <HI>Cicero,</HI> and the younger <HI>Pliny,</HI> amongst the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> have left us their Precedents for our security: For I think I need not mention the inimitable <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indar,</HI> who stretches on these Pinnions out of sight, and is carried upward, as it were, into another World.</P>
<P>This at least, my Lord, I may justly plead, that if I have not per∣form'd so well as I think I have, yet I have us'd my best Endeavours to excel my self. One Disadvantage I have had, which is, never to have known, or seen my Lady: And to draw the Lineaments of her Mind, from the Description which I have receiv'd from others, is for a Painter to set himself at work without the living Original before him. Which the more beautiful it is, will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive; when he has only a relation give him, of such and such Fea∣tures by an Acquaintance or a Friend; without the Nice Touches which give the best Resemblance▪ and make the Graces of the Picture. Every Artist is apt enough to flatter himself, (and I amongst the rest) that that their own ocular Observations, would have discover'd more Perfe∣ctions, at least others, than have been deliver'd to them: Though I have receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d mine from the best hands, that is, from Persons who neither want a just Understanding of my Lady's Worth, nor a due Veneration for her Memory.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Donn</HI> the greatest Wit, though not the greatest Poet of our Nation, acknowledges, that he had never seen Mrs. <HI>Drury,</HI> whom he has made immortal in his admirable Anniversaries; I have had the same fortune; though I have no succeeded to the same Genius. How∣ever, I have follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his Footsteps in the Design of his Panegyrick, which was to raise an Emul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion in the living, to Copy out the Example of the dead. And therefore it was, that I once intended to have call'd this Poem, the Pattern: And though on a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cond Consideration, I chang'd the Title into the Name of that Illustrious Person, yet the Design con∣tinues, and <HI>Eleonora</HI> is still the Pattern of Charity, Devotion, and Humility; of the best Wife, the best Mother, and the best of Friends.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, though I have endeavour'd to answer Your Com∣mands, yet I could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer it to the World, nor to my Conscience, if I gave not Your Lordship my Testimony of being the best Husband now living: I say my Testimony only: For the Praise of it, is given You by Your self. They who despise the Rules of Vertue both in their Practice and their Morals, will think this a very trivial Commendation. But I think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culiar Happiness of the Countess of <HI>Abingdon,</HI> to have been so truly lov'd by you, while she was living, and so gratef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly ho∣nour'd, after she was dead. Few there are who have either had, or co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d have such a Loss; and yet fewer who carried their Love and Con∣stancy beyond the Grave. The exteriours of Mourning▪ a decent Funeral, and black Habits, are the usual sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Common Husbands: and per∣haps their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deserve no better than to be mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d with Hypocrisie▪
<PB N="5" REF="440"/>
and forgot with ease. But you have distinguish'd your self from ordi∣nary Lovers, by a real, and lasting Grief for the Deceas'd. And by en∣deavouring to raise for her, the most durable Monument, which is that of Verse. And so it would have prov'd, if the Workman had been equal to the Work; and your Choice of the Artificer, as happy as your Design. Yet▪ as <HI>Phidias</HI> when he had made the Statue of <HI>Minerva,</HI> cou'd not forbear to ingrave his own Name, as Author of the Piece: so give me leave to hope, that by subscribing mine to this Poem, I may live by the Goddess, and transmit my Name to Posterity by the Memory of Hers. 'Tis no Flattery to assure Your Lorship, that she is remember'd in the present Age, by all who have had the Honour of her Conversation and Acquain∣tance. And that I have never been in any Company since the News of her Death was first brought me, where they have not ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Vir∣tues; and even spoken the same things of her in Prose, which I have done in Verse.</P>
<P>I therefore think my self oblig'd to thank Your Lordship for the Com∣mission which You have given me: How I have acquitted my self of it, must be left to the Opinion of the World, in spight of any Protestation, which I can enter against the present Age, as Incompetent or Corrupt Judges. For my Comfort they are but <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and as such, If they Think ill of me to Day, they are inconstant enough, to Think well of me to Morrow. And after all, I have not much to thank my Fortune that I was born amongst them. The Good of both Sexes are so few▪ in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngland,</HI> that they stand like Exceptions against General Rules: And though one of them has deserv'd a greater Commendation, than I cou'd give her, they have taken care, that I shou'd not tire my Pen, with frequent Ex∣ercise on the like Subjects▪ that Praises, like Taxes, shou'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be appropri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ted; and left almost as Individual as the Person. They say my Talent is Satyr; if it be so, 'tis a fruitful Age; and there is an extraordinary Crop to gather. But a single Hand is insufficient for such a Harvest: They have sown the Dragons Teeth themselves; and 'tis but just they shou'd reap each other in Lampoons. You, my Lord, who have the Cha∣racter of Honour, though 'tis not my Happiness to know You, may stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>side, with the small Remainders of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, truly such, and unhurt your selves, behold the mad Combat. If I have pleas'd you, and some few others, I have obtain'd my end. You see, I have disabled my self, like an Elected Speaker of the House; yet like him I have un∣dertaken the Charge; and find the Burden sufficiently recompenc'd by the Honour. Be pleas'd to accept of these my unworthy Labours, this Paper Monument; and let her Pious Memory, which I am sure is Sacred to You, not only Plead the Pardon of my many Faults, but gain me your Protection, which is ambitiously sought by,</P>

<LG>
<L>THo' Fuddl'd o'er Night, the next Morning we found,</L>
<L>That Sleep had recover'd what Claret had drown'd;</L>
<L>And all our numb'd Members, so feeble and weak,</L>
<L>That we scarcely were able to walk, or to speak,</L>
<L>Were now by kind <HI>Morpheus</HI> with Strength reimpower'd,</L>
<L>And all to their primitive Vigour restor'd.</L>
<L>Our Thoughts were so sprightly, our Humours so gay,</L>
<L>That we both were as brisk as a Milk-maid in <HI>May.</HI></L>
<L>And as for the Rudders that steer our Affections,</L>
<L>As Fancy, that Pilot, shall give 'em Directions;</L>
<L>Which were made over Night so incapably tender,</L>
<L>Were now grown as stiff as a Bullock's Defender:</L>
<L>That wanting Discretion I'd like to 've miscarry'd,</L>
<L>And thoughtless of Cuckldom wish my self marry'd:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="456"/>Well knowing desire of unchaste Copulation,</L>
<L>Had been an Affront to our new Reformation;</L>
<L>And therefore resolv'd to forbear the sweet Evil,</L>
<L>Tho' hugely inclin'd to the Flesh and the Devil.</L>
<L>But yet notwithstanding our over-Night's Fuddle,</L>
<L>That made us so brisk in the Tail and the Noddle,</L>
<L>We both were as dry, I may justly maintain,</L>
<L>As a Rat that is poyson'd by eating his Bane.</L>
<L>In order to quench our immod'rate Droughts,</L>
<L>That burnt in our Stomachs, and scorch'd up our Mouths▪</L>
<L>We leap'd out of Bed with a strong <HI>Appetitus,</HI></L>
<L>To swallow a Hair of the Dog that had bit us.</L>
<L>We shifted our Linen, and whip'd on our Cloaths,</L>
<L>And powder'd our Wigs like a couple of <HI>Beaus,</HI></L>
<L>Then quitted our Lodging till Night, with design,</L>
<L>To quench with that Engine, a Flask full of Wine,</L>
<L>The Fire which God <HI>Bacchus,</HI> as well as Fair <HI>Venus,</HI></L>
<L>By th' help of brisk Claret, had kindl'd within us.</L>
<L>So frensical Wretches their Senses restore,</L>
<L>By clawing the Hag who bewitch'd 'em before.</L>
<L>And skilful Physicians their Patients recover,</L>

<L>With this Resolution we cross'd to <HI>S—Lane,</HI></L>
<L>'Twixt which and <HI>B—Y</HI>—hangs a Bush and a Sign,</L>
<L>Which some call the <HI>Tuns,</HI> by whose size one wou'd guess,</L>
<L>They were three Brandy Runlets of Gallons a piece,</L>
<L>Well, well, says my Friend, you may descant upon 'em,</L>
<L>And for their diminutive sizes untun 'em:</L>
<L>But when within Doors you may think 'em much wider,</L>
<L>And Judge by the Wine they are Hogsheads of Cider.</L>
<L>However, said I, let us once venture in,</L>
<L>If it be for no cause, but to see and be seen:</L>
<L>For tho' it proves Cider 'twill quench us and clean us,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>With that we went into a pretty long Entry,</L>
<L>At th' end of which Passage a Female stood Centry,</L>

<L>To say that she Paints it might justly provoke her,</L>
<L>I'm sure that she does not, except 'tis with Oker:</L>
<L>Nor did she look warm'd with Canary or Brandy,</L>

<L>From whence we may say, without any Reflection,</L>
<L>She's blest with a sweet and a melting Complexion.</L>
<L>Her Bubb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which just peep'd above to invite ye,</L>

<L>That had but her Skin been a little more fair,</L>
<L>Like a Stone Horse enrag'd I'd leap'd over the Bar;</L>
<L>But the Ginger-bread Colour she wore in her Cheeks,</L>
<L>Was to me as offensive as Garlick or Leeks:</L>
<L>For Yellow I hate, and I'll tell you for what,</L>
<L>'Tis the Mutton Complexion that dies of the Rot.</L>
<L>And who'd be so fond of a Kiss or a Touch,</L>
<L>With a Lady that looks not as sound as a Roach?</L>
<L>Her Hips, I confess, were so charmingly plump,</L>
<L>And between them a Hillock adorning her Rump,</L>
<L>That when she turn'd round, by a glimpse I could find</L>
<L>All the best of her Beauty was seated behind.</L>
<L>Tho' perhaps upon search it wou'd have prov'd but a Cushion,</L>
<L>That rais'd up her A—se to the height of the Fashion.</L>
<L>After Ogling, and Talking, and taking a view,</L>
<L>As she stood in the Bar, like a Jilt in a Pew.</L>
<L>The Drawer, according to our desire,</L>
<L>Shew'd us into the Kitchin, for sake of the Fire:</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="458"/>The masculine Jade had the Fork in her Hand,</L>
<L>And bid him stand off at the Word of Command:</L>

<L>The Spark in his Cups, full of Courage and Vigour,</L>
<L>In spight of her Threats, rally'd on like a Tyger,</L>
<L>With his Arm, like a Fencer, he parry'd her Poker,</L>
<L>And running within her did further provoke her,</L>
<L>By falling most roughly and rudely upon her,</L>
<L>And bobbing his Hand at the Seat of her Honour;</L>
<L>But still with such Art she defended her Lips,</L>
<L>And now and then gave him such Pinches and Nips,</L>
<L>That I would not have born, to have purchas'd a Kiss,</L>
<L>From the Lips of Queen <HI>Dido,</HI> or <HI>Helen</HI> of <HI>Greece.</HI></L>

<L>Unhappily met with a Fall in the Jostle,</L>
<L>And between 'em was thrown on the Ground in the bustle;</L>
<L>The Cook at this sorrowful sight grew inflam'd,</L>
<L>And wish'd her Antagonist rotted and damn'd.</L>
<L>The Spark in return to the Quean of the Kitchin,</L>
<L>In wonderful Rage went to Cursing and Bitching:</L>
<L>But still in a Passion pursuing his Matter,</L>
<L>They scuffled about Ankle deep in the Batter:</L>
<L>As Soldiers hard set in a Battle do use,</L>
<L>To fight 'till the Blood washes over their Shooes.</L>
<L>The sturdy Defendant her Pudding beholding,</L>
<L>Fell now in good earnest to scratching and scolding.</L>
<L>And fought like a Cat when her Passion was stir'd,</L>
<L>To see the good Food trod about like a T—d,</L>
<L>Her Greasiness now all Venom and Gall,</L>
<L>Who swore she'd admit of no <HI>Kissing at all</HI>;</L>
<L>And with that she exerted her Masculine Force,</L>
<L>Who was almost as strong a Mare or a Horse,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="459"/>And push'd down the Spark, who most decently lay,</L>
<L>In the midst of the Pudding that fell in the Fray.</L>
<L>With that he arose full of Malice and Spight,</L>
<L>To see his black Cloaths painted over with white:</L>
<L>And look'd in this pickle, without any Lying,</L>
<L>Like a piece of fat Tripe dry'd in Batter for Frying.</L>

<L>For a Glass of true Claret, or any good Wine,</L>

<L>Nay, at Night, or indeed any time of the Day;</L>
<L>My Grandsire I've heard, always drank like a Fish,</L>
<L>And his Children all lov'd to about with the Dish;</L>
<L>So what's bred in the Bone, will ne'er out of the Flesh:</L>

<L>My Father and Mother have always lov'd Claret,</L>
<L>And hew do you think that the Son shou'd forbear it,</L>

<L>Turn to his Book, and snuffle out a Psalm;</L>
<L>Wherein each Zealot fond of singing Praise,</L>

<L>Over the doleful Song I'd yawn and gape,</L>
<L>What Christian could resolve against a Nap,</L>
<L>Or who forbear to dose at every Line,</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus during Pray'rs the painful Hour I'd spend,</L>
<L>And small Attention to the Sermon lend;</L>
<L>But e'er 'twas well begun, still wish it at an End.</L>
<L>With Patience I would hear the Preacher throw</L>
<L>His Darts upon the sinful Croud below;</L>
<L>Observe his Knack, when prettily he talk'd,</L>
<L>How well he hem'd, how gracefully he haulk'd;</L>
<L>How mannerly he did his Nostrils blow,</L>
<L>And how he lugg'd the Cushion to and fro;</L>
<L>How earnestly sometimes his Words came out,</L>
<L>And how he thrash'd the Pope and Dev'l about.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the last Sand of the long Hour had run,</L>
<L>And told old <HI>Spintext</HI> when 'twas time to've done,</L>
<L>I'd rise among the rest, and gaze around,</L>
<L>Till I some fam'd Intriguing Lady found.</L>
<L>Invited by her Eyes and some kind Smile,</L>
<L>As she walk'd out, I'd meet her in the Isle;</L>
<L>With Am'rous Whispers I'd her Ears approach,</L>
<L>Squeeze her soft Hand, conduct her to her Coach,</L>
<L>And lay the Ground-work of a new Debauch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to some Rakish Friends my course I'd steer,</L>
<L>Strangers to Faith, and Enemies to Fear;</L>
<L>There Ridicule with them the Canting Priest,</L>
<L>And make Religion but our common Jest;</L>
<L>Raise up dead <HI>Hobs</HI> to justifie our Cause,</L>
<L>And overthrow Divine, by Nature's Laws;</L>
<L>Burlesque the Scriptures, and asperse the Creed,</L>

<HEAD>TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the delivery of Your Royal Father's Person into the hands of the Army, I undertaking to the Queen Mother, that I would find some means to get access to him she was pleased to send me, and by the help of <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> I got my admittance, and coming well instructed from the Queen (his Majesty having been long kept in the dark) he was pleased to discourse very freely with me of the whole state of his Affairs: But, Sir, I will not launch into a History, instead of an Epistle. One morning waiting on him at <HI>Causham,</HI> smiling upon me, he said he could tell me some News of my self, which was, that he had seen some Verses of mine the Evening before (being those to Sir <HI>Richard Fanshaw</HI>) and asking me when I made them, I told him two or three years since; he was pleased to say, that having never seen them before, He was afraid I had written them since my return into <HI>England,</HI> and though he liked them well, He would advise me to write no more, alledging, that when men are young, and have little else to do, they might vent the overflowings of their Fancy that way; but when they were thought fit for more serious Employments, if they still persisted in that course, it would look as if they minded not the way to any better.</P>
<P>Whereupon I stood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait upon him, and at his departure from <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> he was pleased to com∣mand me to stay privately at <HI>London,</HI> to send to him and receive from him all his Letters from and to all his Correspondents at home and abroad, and I was furnish'd with nine several Cyphers in order to it: Which trust I performed with great safety, to the persons with whom we corresponded; but about nine months after being discovered by their knowledge of Mr. <HI>Cowley's</HI> Hand I happily escaped both for my self, and those that held correspondence with me; that time war too hot and busie for such idle speculations, but after I had the good fortune to wait upon Your Majesty in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> You were pleased sometimes to give me Arguments to divert and put off the evil hours of our Banishment, which now and then fell not short of Your Majesty's expectation.</P>
<P>After, when Your Majesty departing from St. <HI>Germans</HI> to <HI>Jersy,</HI> was pleased freely (without my asking) to confer upon me that place wherein I have now the honour to serve You, I then gave over Poetical Line,

<L>But fear prevails, and bids him trust his Feet.</L>
<L>So fast he flies, that his reviewing eye</L>
<L>Has lost the Chasers, and his ear the Cry:</L>
<L>Exulting, till he finds, their Nobler Sense</L>
<L>Their disproportion'd Speed does recompense.</L>

<L>So much his Love was dearer than his Life.</L>
<L>Now every Leaf, and every moving Breath</L>
<L>Presents a Foe, and every Foe a Death.</L>
<L>Wearied, forsaken, and pursu'd, at last</L>

<L>Courage he thence resumes, resolv'd to bear</L>
<L>All their Assaults, since 'tis in vain to fear.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="497"/>And now too late he wishes for the fight,</L>
<L>That strength he wasted in ignoble flight:</L>

<L>He strait revokes his bold resolve, and more</L>
<L>Repents his courage, than his fear before;</L>
<L>Finds that uncertain ways unsafest are,</L>
<L>And Doubt a greater mischief than Despair.</L>
<L>Then to the Stream, when neither Friends, nor Force,</L>
<L>Nor speed, nor Art avail, he shaps his course;</L>
<L>Thinks not their rage so desperate t' assay</L>
<L>An Element more merciless than they.</L>
<L>But fearless they pursue, nor can the Flood</L>
<L>Quench their dire Thirst; alas, they thirst for Blood.</L>
<L>So toward a Ship the oarefin'd Gallies ply,</L>
<L>Which wanting Sea to ride, or Wind to fly,</L>
<L>Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare</L>
<L>Tempt the last fury of extream Despair.</L>
<L>So fares the Stag among the enrag'd Hounds,</L>
<L>Repels their force, and wounds returns for wounds</L>
<L>And as a Hero, whom his baser Foes</L>
<L>In Troops surrounds, now these assails, now those,</L>
<L>Though Prodigal of Life, disdains to dye</L>
<L>By common hands; but if he can descry</L>
<L>Some nobler Foes approach, to him he calls,</L>
<L>And begs his Fate, and then contented falls.</L>
<L>So when the King a mortal Shaft lets flye</L>
<L>From his unerring hand, then glad to dye,</L>
<L>Proud of the wound, to it resigns his Blood,</L>
<L>And stains the Crystal with a purple Flood.</L>
<L>This a more innocent and happy Chase,</L>
<L>Than when of old, but in the self-same place,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Runny Mead, where that Great Charter was first sealed.</NOTE> Fair Liberty pursu'd, and meant a Prey</L>
<L>To lawless power, here turn'd, and stood at Bay.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="498"/>When in that Remedy all hope was plac'd,</L>
<L>Which was, or should have been at least, the last.</L>
<L>Here was that Charter seal'd, wherein the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Magna Charta.</NOTE> Crown</L>
<L>All marks of Arbitrary Power lays down:</L>
<L>Tyrant and Slave, those Names of hate and fear,</L>
<L>The happier Style of King and Subject bear:</L>
<L>Happy when both to the same Center move,</L>
<L>When Kings give Liberty, and Subjects Love.</L>
<L>Therefore not long in Force this Charter stood;</L>
<L>Wanting that Seal, it must be seal'd in Blood.</L>
<L>The Subjects arm'd, the more their Princes gave,</L>
<L>Th' advantage only took the more to crave.</L>
<L>Till King's by giving, gave themselves away,</L>
<L>And even that Power that should deny, betray.</L>
<L>"Who gives constrain'd, but his own Fear reviles,</L>
<L>"Not thank'd, but scorn'd; nor are thy Gifts, but Spoils.</L>
<L>Thus Kings, by grasping more than they could hold,</L>
<L>First made their Subjects by Oppression bold:</L>
<L>And popular Sway, by forcing Kings to give</L>
<L>More than was fit for Subjects to receive,</L>
<L>Ran to the same Extreams; and one Excess</L>
<L>Made both, by striving to be greater, less.</L>
<L>When a calm River rais'd with sudden Rains,</L>
<L>Or Snows dissolv'd▪ o'erflows the adjoyning Plains,</L>
<L>The Husbandmen with high-rais'd Banks secure</L>
<L>Their greedy Hopes, and this he can endure;</L>
<L>But if with Bays and Dams, they strive to force</L>
<L>His Chanel to a new or narrow Course;</L>
<L>No longer then within his Banks he dwells,</L>
<L>First to a Torrent, then a Deluge swells:</L>
<L>Stronger and Fiercer! by Restraint he roars,</L>
<L>And knows no Bound, but makes his Powers his Shores.</L>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm'd with two large Militia's on his head:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="503"/>As if he practis'd Majesty he walk'd,</L>
<L>And at his Nod, he made not hast, but stalk'd.</L>
<L>By his large shade, he saw how great he was,</L>
<L>And his vast Layers on the bended Grass.</L>
<L>His thought as large as his proportion grew,</L>
<L>And judg'd himself as fit for Empire too.</L>
<L>Thus to Rebellious hopes he swell'd at length,</L>
<L>Love and Ambition growing with his strength.</L>
<L>This hid Ambition his bold Passion shows,</L>
<L>And from a Subject to a Rival grows.</L>
<L>Sollicites all his Princes fearful Dames,</L>
<L>And in his fight Courts with rebellious flames.</L>
<L>The Prince sees this with an inflamed Eye,</L>
<L>But looks are only signs of Majesty:</L>
<L>When once a Prince's Will meets a restraint,</L>
<L>His Power is then esteem'd but his Complaint.</L>
<L>His Head then shakes, at which the affrighted Herd</L>
<L>Start to each side; his Rival not afear'd,</L>
<L>Stands by his Mistress side, and stirs not thence,</L>
<L>But bids her own his Love, and his Defence,</L>
<L>The Quarrel now to a vast height is grown,</L>
<L>Both urg'd to fight by Passion and a Throne;</L>
<L>But Love has most excuse; for all, we find,</L>
<L>Have Passions, tho' not Thrones alike assign'd.</L>
<L>The Sovereign Stag shaking his loaded head,</L>
<L>On which his <HI>Scepters</HI> with his <HI>Arms</HI> were spread,</L>
<L>Wisely by Nature, there together fix'd,</L>
<L>Where with the Tittle, the Defence was mixt.</L>
<L>The pace which he advanc'd with to engage,</L>
<L>Became at once his Majesty, and Rage:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="504"/>'Tother stands still with as much confidence,</L>
<L>To make his part seem only his defence.</L>
<L>Their heads now meet, and at one blow each strikes</L>
<L>As many strokes, as if a Rank of Pikes</L>
<L>Grew on his brows, as thick their Antlets stand,</L>
<L>Which every Year kind Nature does disband.</L>
<L>Wild Beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are,</L>
<L>But Man no season frees from Love or War.</L>
<L>VVith equal strength they met, as if two Oaks</L>
<L>Had fell, and mingled with a thousand strokes.</L>
<L>One by ambition urg'd, t'other disdain,</L>
<L>One to preserve, the other fought to Gain:</L>
<L>The Subjects and the Mistresses stood by,</L>
<L>VVith Love and Duty to crown Victory:</L>
<L>For all Affections wait on prosperous Fame,</L>
<L>Not he that climbs, but he that falls, meet shame.</L>
<L>VVhile thus with equal Courages they meet,</L>
<L>The wounded Earth yields to their strugling Feet;</L>
<L>And while one slides, t'other pursues the Fight,</L>
<L>And thinks that forc't Retreat looks like a Flight:</L>
<L>But then asham'd of his Retreat, at length</L>
<L>Drives his Foe back, his Rage renews his strength.</L>
<L>As even weights into a motion thrown,</L>
<L>By equal turns, drive themselves up and down;</L>
<L>So sometimes one, then 'tother Stag prevails,</L>
<L>And Victory yet doubtful, holds the Scales.</L>
<L>The Prince asham'd to be oppos'd so long,</L>
<L>VVith all his strength united rushes on;</L>
<L>The Rebel weaker, than at first appears,</L>
<L>And from his Courage sinks unto his Fears.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="505"/>Not able longer to withstand his might,</L>
<L>From a Retreat, at last steals to a Flight.</L>
<L>The mighty Stag pursues his flying Foe,</L>
<L>Till his own Pride of Conquest made him slow;</L>
<L>Thought it enough to scorn a thing that flies,</L>
<L>And only now pursu'd him with his Eyes.</L>
<L>The vanquish'd as he fled turn'd back his fight,</L>
<L>Asham'd to flie, and yet afraid to fight:</L>
<L>Sometimes his wounds, as his excuse survey'd,</L>
<L>Then fled again, and then look'd back and stay'd:</L>
<L>Blush't that his wounds so slight should not deny</L>
<L>Strength for a fight, that left him strength to flie.</L>
<L>Calls thoughts of Love and Empire to his Aid,</L>
<L>But fears more powerful than all those persuade,</L>
<L>And yet in spight of them retains his shame,</L>
<L>His cool'd ambition, and his half-quench'd flame,</L>
<L>There's none from their own sense of shame can flie,</L>
<L>And dregs of Passions dwell with misery.</L>
<L>Now to the shades he bends his feeble course,</L>
<L>Despis'd by those that once admir'd his force:</L>
<L>The VVretch that to a scorn'd Condition's thrown,</L>
<L>VVith the VVorld's Favour, loses too his own.</L>
<L>VVhile fawning Troops their Conquering Prince enclos'd,</L>
<L>Now render'd absolute by being oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d;</L>
<L>Princes by Disobedience get Command,</L>
<L>And by new quench'd Rebellions firmer stand</L>
<L>Till by the boundless offers of success,</L>
<L>They meet their Fate in ill-us'd happiness.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="506"/>The vanquish'd Stag to thickest shades repairs,</L>
<L>VVhere he finds safety punish't with his Cares;</L>
<L>Thorough the VVoods he rushes not, but glides,</L>
<L>And from all searches but his own he hides;</L>
<L>Asham'd to live, unwilling yet to lose</L>
<L>That wretched life he knew not how to use.</L>
<L>In this Retirement thus he liv'd conceal'd,</L>
<L>Till with his wounds his fears were almost heal'd;</L>
<L>His ancient Passions now began to move,</L>
<L>He thought again of Empire and of Love:</L>
<L>Then rouz'd himself and stretch'd at his full length,</L>
<L>Took the large measure of his mighty strength;</L>
<L>Then shook his loaded Head; the shadow too,</L>
<L>Shook like a tree, where leaveless Branches grew:</L>
<L>Stooping to drink, he sees it in the Streams,</L>
<L>And in the Woods hears clashing of his Beams;</L>
<L>No Accident but does alike proclaim</L>
<L>His growing strength, and his encreasing shame.</L>
<L>Now once again, resolves to try his Fate,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Envy always is importunate;)</L>
<L>And in the mind perpetually does move,</L>
<L>A fit Companion for unquiet Love.</L>
<L>He thinks upon his mighty Enemy,</L>
<L>Circl'd about with Pow'r and Luxury.</L>
<L>And hop'd his strength might sink in his desires,</L>
<L>Remembring he had wasted in such Fires.</L>
<L>Yet while he hop'd by them to overcome,</L>
<L>He wish'd the others fatal joys his own.</L>
<L>Thus the unquiet Beast in fasety lay,</L>
<L>VVhere nothing was to fear, nor to obey;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="507"/>Where he alone commanded, and was Lord</L>
<L>Of every Bounty Nature did afford,</L>
<L>Chose Feasts for every Arbitrary Sense,</L>
<L>An Empire in the state of Innocence.</L>
<L>But all the Feasts Nature before him plac't,</L>
<L>Had but faint relishes to his lost taste,</L>
<L>Sick Minds, like Bodies in a Fever spent,</L>
<L>Turn Food to the Disease, not nourishment.</L>
<L>Sometimes he stole abroad, and shrinking stood,</L>
<L>Under the shelter of the friendly Wood;</L>
<L>Casting his envious Eyes towards those Plains</L>
<L>Where with crown'd joys, his mighty Rival Reigns.</L>
<L>He saw th' obeying Herd marching along,</L>
<L>And weigh'd his Rival's Greatness by the Throng.</L>
<L>Want takes false Measures, both of Power and Joys,</L>
<L>And envy'd Greatness is but Crowd, and Noise.</L>
<L>Not able to endure this hated sight,</L>
<L>Back to the Shades he flies to seek out Nigt.</L>
<L>Like exiles from their native Soils, though sent</L>
<L>To better Countries, think it Banishment.</L>
<L>Here he enjoy'd what t'other could have there,</L>
<L>The woods are shady, and the streams as clear,</L>
<L>The Pastures more untainted where he fed,</L>
<L>And every Night chose out an unprest Bed.</L>
<L>But then his lab'ring Soul with Dreams was prest,</L>
<L>And found the greatest weariness in rest;</L>
<L>His dreadful Rival in his sleep appears,</L>
<L>And in his Dreams again, he fights and fears:</L>
<L>Shrinks at the strokes of t'others mighty Head,</L>
<L>Feels every wound, and dreams how fast he fled.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="508"/>At this he wakes, and with his fearful Eyes,</L>
<L>Salutes the light that fleet the <HI>Eastern</HI> Skies,</L>
<L>Still half amaz'd, looks round, and held by fear,</L>
<L>Scarce can believe no Enemy was near.</L>
<L>But when he saw his heedless fears were brought</L>
<L>Not by a Substance, but a drowsie Thought.</L>
<L>His ample sides he shakes, from whence the dew</L>
<L>In scatter'd Showers like driven Tempests flew,</L>
<L>At which, through all his breast new boldness spread,</L>
<L>And with his Courage rais'd his mighty head.</L>
<L>Then by his Love inspir'd, resolves to try</L>
<L>The Combat now, and overcome, or die.</L>
<L>Every weak Passion sometimes is above</L>
<L>The fear of death, much more the noblest love.</L>
<L>By hope 'tis scorn'd, and by despair 'tis sought,</L>
<L>Pursu'd by Honour, and by Sorrow brought.</L>
<L>Resolv'd the paths of danger now to tread,</L>
<L>From his scorn'd shelter, and his fears he fled.</L>
<L>VVith a brave hast now seeks a second Fight,</L>
<L>Redeems the base one by a Noble Flight.</L>
<L>In the mean time, the Conqueror enjoy'd</L>
<L>That Power by which he was to be destroy'd.</L>
<L>How hard 'tis for the Prosperous to see,</L>
<L>That fate which waits on Power, and Victory.</L>
<L>Thus he secuerly Reign'd, when in a Rout</L>
<L>He saw th' affrighted Herd flying about;</L>
<L>As if some Huntsmen did their Chase pursue,</L>
<L>About themselves in scatter'd Rings they flew,</L>
<L>He like a careful Monarch rais'd his Head,</L>
<L>To see what cause that strange disturbance bread.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="509"/>But when the searcht-out Cause appear'd no more,</L>
<L>Than from a Slave, he had o'ercome before,</L>
<L>A bold disdain did in his looks appear,</L>
<L>And shook his aweful Head to chide their Fear.</L>
<L>The Herd afraid of Friend and Enemy,</L>
<L>Shrink from the one, and from the other fly;</L>
<L>They scarce know which they should Obey, or Trust,</L>
<L>Since Fortune only makes it Safe and Just.</L>
<L>Yet in despight of all his Pride, he staid,</L>
<L>And this unlook't for Chance with trouble weigh'd,</L>
<L>His Rage, and his Contempt alike, swell'd high,</L>
<L>And only fear'd his Enemy should fly;</L>
<L>He thought of former Conquest, and from thence</L>
<L>Cozen'd himself into a Confidence.</L>
<L>T'other that saw his Conquerer so near,</L>
<L>Stood still and list'ned to a whisp'ring fear;</L>
<L>From whence she heard his Conquest and his Shame.</L>
<L>But new-born Hopes his ancient Fears o'recame.</L>
<L>The mighty Enemies now meet at length,</L>
<L>VVith equal Fury, though not equal Strength</L>
<L>For now, too late the Conquerer did find,</L>
<L>That all was wasted in him but his Mind.</L>
<L>His Courage in his VVeakness yet prevails.</L>
<L>As a bold Pilot steers with tatter'd Sails,</L>
<L>And Cordage crackt, directs no steddy Course,</L>
<L>Carry'd by Resolution, more than Force.</L>
<L>Before his once scorn'd Enemy he reels,</L>
<L>His wounds encreasing with his shame, he feels</L>
<L>The others strength more from his weakness grows,</L>
<L>And with one furious push, his Rival throws.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="510"/>So a tall Oak, the Pride of all the VVood,</L>
<L>That long th'assault of several storms hath stood,</L>
<L>Till by a mighty blast more pow'rfully push't,</L>
<L>His Roots torn up, and to the Earth he rusht.</L>
<L>Yet then he rais'd his Head, on which there grew,</L>
<L>Once, all his Power and all his Title too;</L>
<L>Unable now to rise, and less to fight,</L>
<L>He rais'd those Scepters to demand his Right.</L>
<L>But such weak Arguments prevail with none,</L>
<L>To plead their Titles, when their Power is gone.</L>
<L>His Head now sinks, and with it all defence,</L>
<L>Not only robb'd of Power but Pretence.</L>
<L>Wounds upon wounds, the Conqueror still gives.</L>
<L>And thinks himself unsafe, while t'other lives:</L>
<L>Unhappy State of such as wear a Crown,</L>
<L>Fortune does seldom lay'em gently down.</L>
<L>Now to the most scorn'd Remedy he flies,</L>
<L>And for some Pity seems to move his Eyes,</L>
<L>Pity, by which the best of Vertu's try'd,</L>
<L>To wretched Princes ever is deny'd,</L>
<L>There is a Debt to Fortune, which they pay</L>
<L>For all their Greatness, by no common way.</L>
<L>The flatt'ring Troops unto the Victor fly,</L>
<L>And own his Title to his Victory;</L>
<L>The Faith of most, with Fortune does decline,</L>
<L>Duty's but Fear, and Conscience but Design.</L>
<L>The Victor now, proud in his great success,</L>
<L>Hastes to enjoy his fatal happiness;</L>
<L>Forgot his mighty Rival was destroy'd</L>
<L>But that, which he so fondly now enjoy'd.</L>
<L>In Passions, thus Nature her self enjoys,</L>
<L>Sometimes preserves, and then again destroys;</L>
<L>Yet all Destruction which Revenge can move,</L>
<L>Time or Ambition, is supply'd by Love.</L>

<L>Thy Gift, <HI>Pomona,</HI> in <HI>Miltonian</HI> Verse</L>
<L>Adventrous I presume to sing; of Verse</L>
<L>Nor skill'd, nor studious: But my Native Soil</L>
<L>Invites me, and the Theme as yet unsung.</L>
<L>Ye <HI>Ariconian</HI> Knights, and fairest Dames,</L>
<L>To whom propitious Heav'n these Blessings grants,</L>
<L>Attend my Layes; nor hence disdain to learn,</L>
<L>How Nature's Gifts may be improv'd by Art.</L>
<L>And thou, O <HI>Mostyn,</HI> whose Benevolence,</L>
<L>And Candor oft experienc'd, Me vouchsaf'd</L>
<L>To knit in Friendship, growing still with Years,</L>
<L>Accept this Pledge of Gratitude and Love.</L>
<L>May it a lasting Monument remain</L>
<L>Of dear Respect; that, when this Body frail</L>
<L>Is moulder'd into Dust, and I become</L>
<L>As I had never been, late Times may know</L>
<L>I once was blest in such a matchless Friend.</L>
<L>Who-e'er expects his lab'ring Trees shou'd bend</L>
<L>With Fruitage, and a kindly Harvest yield,</L>
<L>Be this his first Concern; to find a Tract</L>
<L>Impervious to the Winds, begirt with Hills,</L>
<L>That intercept the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Blasts</L>
<L>Tempestuous, and cold <HI>Eurus</HI> nipping-Force,</L>
<L>Noxious to feeble Buds: But to the West</L>
<L>Lest him free Entrance grant, let <HI>Zephyrs</HI> bland</L>
<L>Administer their tepid genial Airs;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="518"/>Naught fear he from the West, whose gentle Warmth</L>
<L>Discloses well the Earth's all-teeming Womb,</L>
<L>Invigorating tender Seeds; whose Breath</L>
<L>Nurtures the <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>Citron</HI> Groves,</L>
<L><HI>Hesperian</HI> Fruits, and wafts their Odours sweet</L>
<L>Wide thro' the Air, and distant Shores perfumes.</L>
<L>Nor only do the Hills exclude the Winds:</L>
<L>But, when the blackning Clouds in sprinkling Show'rs</L>
<L>Distill, from the high Summits down the Rain</L>
<L>Runs trickling; with the fertile Moisture chear'd,</L>
<L>The Orchats smile; joyous the Farmers see</L>
<L>Their thriving Plants, and bless the heav'nly Dew.</L>
<L>Next, let the Planter, with Discretion meet,</L>
<L>The Force and Genius of each Soil explore;</L>
<L>To what adapted, what it shuns averse:</L>
<L>Without this necessary Care, in vain</L>
<L>He hopes an Apple-Vintage, and Invokes</L>
<L><HI>Pomona</HI>'s Aid in vain. The miry Fields,</L>
<L>Rejoycing in rich Mold, most ample Fruit</L>
<L>Of beauteous Form produce; pleasing to Sight,</L>
<L>But to the Tongue inelegant and flat.</L>
<L>So Nature has decreed; so, oft we see</L>
<L>Men passing fair, in outward Lineaments</L>
<L>Elaborate; less, inwardly, exact.</L>
<L>Nor from the sable Ground expect Success,</L>
<L>Nor from cretaceous, stubborn and jejune:</L>
<L>The Must, of pallid Hue, declares the Soil</L>
<L>Devoid of Spirit; wretched He, that quaffs</L>
<L>Such wheyish Liquors; oft with Colic Pangs,</L>
<L>With pungent Colic Pangs distress'd, he'll roar,</L>
<L>And toss, and turn, and curse th' unwholsome Draught▪</L>
<L>But, Farmer, look, where full-ear'd Sheaves of Rye</L>
<L>Grow wavy on the Tilth, that Soil select</L>
<L>For Apples; thence thy Industry shall gain</L>
<L>Ten-fold Reward; thy Garners, thence with Store</L>
<L>Surcharg'd, shall burst; thy Press with purest Juice</L>
<L>Shall flow, which, in revolving Years, may try</L>
<L>Thy feeble Feet, and bind thy fault'ring Tongue.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="519"/>Such is the <HI>Kent-church,</HI> such <HI>Dantzeyan</HI> Ground,</L>

<L>To deck this Rise with Fruits of various Tastes,</L>
<L>Fail not by frequent Vows t'implore Success;</L>
<L>Thus piteous Heav'n may fix the wandring Glebe.</L>
<L>But if (for Nature doth not share alike</L>
<L>Her Gifts) an happy Soil should be with-held;</L>
<L>If a penurious Clay shou'd be thy Lot,</L>

<L>But what, or of it self, or else compell'd,</L>

<L>Cut Sampire, to excite the squeamish Gust</L>
<L>Of pamper'd Luxury. Then, let thy Ground</L>
<L>Not lye unlabour'd; if the richest Stem</L>
<L>Refuse to thrive, yet who wou'd doubt to plant</L>
<L>Somewhat, that may to Human Use redound,</L>
<L>And Penury, the worst of Ills, remove?</L>
<L>There are, who, fond studious of Increase,</L>
<L>Rich Foreign Mold on their ill-natur'd Land</L>
<L>Induce laborious, and with fatning Muck</L>
<L>Besmear the Roots; in vain! the nursling Grove</L>
<L>Seems fair a while, cherish'd with foster Earth:</L>
<L>But, when the alien Compost is exhaust,</L>
<L>It's native Poverty again prevails.</L>
<L>Tho' this Art fails, despond not; little Pains,</L>
<L>In a due Hour employ'd, great Profit yield.</L>

<L>He cherishes, nor will his Fruit expect</L>
<L>Th'autumnal Season, but, in Summer's Pride,</L>
<L>When other Orchats smile, abortive fail.</L>
<L>Thus the great Light of Heav'n, that in his Course</L>

<L>Noxious to planted Fields, and often Men</L>

<L>Thus while my joyless Hours I lingring spend,</L>
<L>With Looks demure, and silent pace a <HI>Dund,</HI></L>
<L>Horrible Monster! hated by Gods and Men,</L>
<L>To my aerial Citadel ascends;</L>
<L>With Vocal Heel thrice Thund'ring at my Gates,</L>
<L>With hideous Accent thrice he calls; I know</L>
<L>The Voice ill boding, and the solemn Sound;</L>
<L>What shou'd I do, or whether turn? amaz'd,</L>
<L>Confounded, to the dark Recess I fly</L>
<L>Of Woodhole; streight my bristling Hairs erect,</L>
<L>My Tongue forgets her Faculty of Speech,</L>
<L>So horrible he seems; his faded Brow</L>
<L>Entrench'd with many a Frown, and <HI>conic</HI> Beard,</L>
<L>And spreading Band admir'd by Modern Saint</L>
<L>Disastrous Acts forbode; in his Right hand</L>
<L>Long Scrolls of Paper solemnly he waves,</L>
<L>With Characters and Figures dire inscribed</L>
<L>Grievous to mortal Eye, (ye Gods avert</L>
<L>Such Plagues from Righteous Men) behind him stalks</L>
<L>Another Monster, not unlike himself,</L>
<L>Of Aspect sullen, by the Vulgar called</L>
<L>A <HI>Catchpole,</HI> whose polluted hands the Gods</L>
<L>With Force incredible, and Magic Charms</L>
<L>Erst have indu'd, if he his ample Palm</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="560"/>Should haply on ill-fated Shoulder lay</L>
<L>Of Debtor, streight his Body to the touch</L>
<L>Obsequious (as Whilom Knights were wont)</L>
<L>To some enchanted Castle is convey'd,</L>
<L>Where Gates impregnable, and coercive Charm</L>
<L>In durance vile detain him, till in form</L>
<L>Of Money, <HI>Pallas</HI> set the Captive free.</L>
<L>Beware, ye Debtors, when ye walk, beware,</L>
<L>Be circumspect; oft which insiduous Ken,</L>
<L>This Caitiff eyes your steps alooff, and oft</L>
<L>Lies perdue in a Creek or gloomy Cave,</L>
<L>Prompt to enchant some inadvertent wretch</L>
<L>With his unhallow'd Touch. So (Poets sing)</L>
<L><HI>Grimalkin</HI> to Domestick Vermin sworn</L>
<L>An everlasting Foe, with watchful eye,</L>
<L>Lyes nightly brooding ore a chinky gap,</L>
<L>Protending her fell claws, to thoughtless Mice</L>
<L>Sure ruin. So her disembowell'd Web</L>
<L>The <HI>Spider</HI> in a Hall or Kitchin spreads,</L>
<L>Obvious to vagrant Flies: she secret stands</L>
<L>Within her woven Cell; the Humming Prey</L>
<L>Regardless of their Fate, rush on the toils</L>
<L>Inextricable, nor will ought avail</L>
<L>Their Arts nor Arms, nor shapes of lovely Hue,</L>
<L>The Wasp insidious, and the buzzing Drone,</L>
<L>And Butterfly proud of expanded Wings</L>
<L>Distinct with Gold, entangled in her Snares,</L>
<L>Useless resistance make: with eager strides</L>
<L>She tow'ring flies to her expected Spoils;</L>
<L>Then with envenom'd Jaws the vatal Blood</L>
<L>Drinks of reluctant Foes, and to her Cave</L>
<L>Their bulky Carcasses triumphant drags.</L>
<L>So pass my days. But when Nocturnal Shades</L>
<L>This World invelop, and th' inclement Air</L>
<L>Perswades Men to repel benumming Frosts,</L>
<L>With pleasant Wines, and crackling blaze of Wood;</L>
<L>Me lonely sitting, nor the glimmering Light</L>
<L>Of make-weight Candle, nor the joyous talk</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="561"/>Of lovely friends delights; distress'd, forlorn,</L>
<L>Amidst the Horrors of the tedious Night,</L>
<L>Darkling I sigh, and feed with dismal Thoughts</L>
<L>My anxious Mind; or sometimes mournful Verse</L>
<L>Indite, and sing of Groves and Myrtle Shades,</L>
<L>Or desperate Lady near a purling stream,</L>
<L>Or Lover pendant on a Willow-tree:</L>
<L>Mean while I labour with eternal drought,</L>
<L>And restless wish, in vain, my parched Throat</L>
<L>Finds no relief, nor heavy Eyes repose:</L>
<L>But if a Slumber haply do's invade</L>
<L>My weary Limbs, my Fancy still awake,</L>
<L>Longing for Drink, and eager in my Dream,</L>
<L>Tipples Imaginary Pots of Ale.</L>
<L>Awake, I find the setled Thirst—</L>
<L>Still gnawing, and the pleasant Phantom curse.</L>
<L>Thus do I live from Pleasure quite debarr'd,</L>
<L>Nor tast the Fruits that the Sun's genial Rays</L>
<L>Mature, John-apple, nor the Downy Peach,</L>
<L>Nor Walnut in rough-furrow'd Coat secure,</L>
<L>Nor Medlar Fruit delicious in decay;</L>
<L>Afflictions great, yet greater still remain,</L>
<L>My <HI>Galligaskins</HI> that have long withstood</L>
<L>The Winter's Fury, and encroaching Frosts,</L>
<L>By Time subdu'd, (what will not Time subdue!</L>
<L>A horrid Chasm disclose, with Orifice</L>
<L>Wide discontinuous; at which the Winds</L>
<L><HI>Eurus,</HI> and <HI>Auster,</HI> and the dreadful force</L>
<L>Of <HI>Boreas,</HI> that congeals the <HI>Cronian</HI> Waves,</L>
<L>Tumultuous enter with dire chilling Blasts,</L>
<L>Portending Agues. Thus a well-fraught Ship</L>
<L>Long sail'd secure, or through the <HI>Egean</HI> Deep,</L>
<L>Or the <HI>Ionian,</HI> 'till Cruising near</L>
<L>The <HI>Lilybean</HI> Shoar; with hideous Crush</L>
<L>On <HI>Scylla</HI> or <HI>Charybdis</HI> dangerous Rocks</L>
<L>She strikes rebounding, whence the shatter'd Oak,</L>
<L>So fierce a Shock unable to withstand,</L>
<L>Admits the Sea, in at the gaping Side,</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="562"/>The crouding Waves gush with impetuous Rage,</L>
<L>Resistless overwhelming; Horrors seize</L>
<L>The Marriners Death in their Eyes appears,</L>
<L>They stare, they lave, they plump, they swear, they pray:</L>
<L>Vain Efforts, still the battering Waves rush in</L>
<L>Implacable, 'till delug'd by the foam,</L>
<L>The Ship sinks found'ring in the vast Abyss.</L>
