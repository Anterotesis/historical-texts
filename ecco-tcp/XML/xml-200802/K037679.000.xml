<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF DERBY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR connection and friendship, as well as the partiality I know you will enter∣tain in favour of any attempt at regulated Drama, mark you as the person, to whom, with the most propriety, and inclination, I can inscribe the Comedy of the Heiress.</P>
<P>It also comes to your Lordship's hand with a secondary claim to your acceptance, as ow∣ing its existence to the leisure and tranquility I enjoyed during the two last summers at Knowsley.</P>
<P>I long intended, as your Lordship can wit∣ness, to keep the name of the author con∣cealed. After the success with which the Play has been honoured, I must expect that the change of my design will be imputed by many to vanity: I shall submit, without murmuring, to that belief, if I may obtain equal credit for the sincerity of another pride
<PB N="ii" REF="5"/>
which this discovery gratifies—that, of testify∣ing, in the most public manner, the respect, and affection with which I have the honour to be,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My dear Lord,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient, And most humble servant, J. BURGOYNE.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE approbation the following Comedy has re∣ceived upon the Stage, and the candour with which every criticism, that has come to the Author's knowledge, has been accompanied, might encou∣rage him to trust it to the closet without any other preface, than an acknowledgement of his gratitude to the Public, for the honours done to him. And if he detains the reader a few moments more, it is not to disavow what has been hinted at in some of the daily prints, as a species of plagiarism, but to plead it in behalf of dramatic writing in general▪ against rules, that if carried to the extent they lead to, would fix shackles upon genius, and give a very undue limitation to variety.</P>
<P><HI>In point of fable for instance</HI>—Is it a reproach to borrow?</P>
<P>Surely the dramatist, like the architect, brings his talents equally to the test, whether he builds upon another man's ground or his own. And if instead of small and detached parts, the writer of the Heiress had taken the compleat plot of his play from a novel; he would have imitated the exam∣ples (the only imitation to which he has any pre∣tence) of the best dramatic Poets of every age.</P>
<P><HI>In point of originality of characters</HI>—It is humbly hoped this Comedy is not without it. But present instances apart, it is submitted to the judicious, whether such an exaction of novelty as would make a resemblance to any thing ever seen upon the stage before unacceptable, might not materially vitiate the public taste, carry the major part of writers beyond the scope of nature
<PB N="iv" REF="7" MS="y"/>
and probability, and deprive the spectator of that pleasing and infinite diversity of shape and colour∣ing that the leading passions, vices, and follies of civilised life, admit. Love, avarice, misanthropy, &amp;c. &amp;c. if drawn a thousand and a thousand times with new shades, and in different points of view, will do as much credit to invention, and have as just an effect in exhibition, as if Moliere or Con∣grave had never touched the subjects. It is not whether there may not be personages in the Heiress, in whom we may discover family features, that is asked, but whether they are not still individuals, with whom we have been hitherto unacquainted— i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a question, not for the Author to determine.</P>
<P><HI>Original thought</HI>—It has been observed that there is an image in a speech of Lord Gayville, copied closely from Rousseau. Very possibly it may be so. The Author of the Heiress cer∣tainly has read that elegant writer; and to shew how easily invention may be deceived, he will quote another writer (in his estimation still more elegant) who thus accounts, and apologizes for, unconscious plagiarism—<Q>"Faded ideas," says Mr. Sheridan, "Float in the fancy like half for∣gotten dreams; and imagination, in its fullest enjoyments, becomes suspicious of its offspring, and doubts whether it has created or adopted."</Q></P>
<P>More sentiments and expression due to the ima∣gination of others, may possibly be challenged, though they are equally out of the recollection of the Author.—He would only wish the candid to admit the probability, that while he believed them his own, he thought them his best.</P>
<P>Many of the scenes now submitted to perusal, have been shortened in representation, and a few
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>
words have been altered occasionally to preserve connection—a circumstance necessary to be known lest the performers should be suspected of negli∣gence, when, on the contrary, too much cannot be said of their attention and zeal. When all have been eminent, it would be unnecessary, if not in∣vidious, to particularize any: There is nevertheless a Lady, to whom, by her standing separately and individually in one part of the performance, the Author, without departing from his maxim, may express his more than ordinary obligation. Miss Farren, by her inimitable manner of deliver∣ing the Epilogue, has made a better apology to the public than any his pen could have produced, for a composition which, from an accident, was much too hastily written in some parts, and in others pieced together with a like insufficiency of time.</P>
<P>The Epilogue excepted, no defects in the fol∣lowing sheets can be covered by the excuse of hurry: They cannot be so, consistently with truth, nor indeed, with inclination: For the Author had rather be thought incapable of pleasing, after his greatest cares, than wanting in the attention and respect which every man who ventures to publish a production of this nature owes to the world and to himself—Not to let it pass from his hands with∣out frequent revisal, and the best considered finish his abilities can give.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. By the Rt. Hon. RICHARD FITZPATRICK. Spoken by Mr. KING.</HEAD>
<L>AS sprightly sunbeams gild the face of day,</L>
<L>When low'ring tempests calmly glide away,</L>
<L>So when the Poet's dark horizon clears,</L>
<L>Array'd in smiles, the Epilogue appears.</L>
<L>She, of that house the lively emblem still,</L>
<L>Whose brilliant speakers start what themes they will,</L>
<L>Still varying topicks for her sportive rhymes</L>
<L>From all the follies of these <HI>fruitful</HI> times,</L>
<L>Uncheck'd by forms, with flippant hand may cull,</L>
<L>Prologues, <HI>like Peers,</HI> by privilege are dull.</L>
<L>In solemn strain address th' assembled Pit,</L>
<L>The legal judges of dramatic wit,</L>
<L>Confining still with dignified decorum,</L>
<L>Their observations,—to the Play before 'em.</L>
<L>Now when each batchelor a helpmate lacks,</L>
<L>(That sweet exemption from a double Tax)</L>
<L>When laws are fram'd with a benignant plan</L>
<L>Of light'ning <HI>burdens</HI> on the married man,</L>
<L>And Hymen adds one solid comfort more</L>
<L>To all those <HI>comforts</HI> he conferr'd before,</L>
<L>To smooth the rough laborious road to fame</L>
<L>Our bard has chosen—an <HI>alluring name.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="10"/>As wealth in wedlock oft is known to hide</L>
<L>The imperfections of a homely bride,</L>
<L>This tempting title, he perhaps expects,</L>
<L>May heighten beauties,—and conceal defects:</L>
<L>Thus sixty's wrinkles, view'd thro' fortune's glass,</L>
<L>The rosy dimples of sixteen surpass:</L>
<L>The modern suitor, grasps his fair one's hand,</L>
<L>O'erlooks her person, and adores—<HI>her land</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>Leers</HI> on her houses with an <HI>ogling eye,</HI></L>
<L>O'er her rich acres heaves an <HI>am'rous</HI> sigh,</L>
<L>His <HI>heartfelt</HI> pangs thro' groves of—<HI>timber</HI> vents,</L>
<L>And runs distracted for—<HI>her three per cents.</HI></L>
<L>Will thus the Poet's mimic Heiress find,</L>
<L>The bridegroom critic to <HI>her</HI> failings blind,</L>
<L>Who claims, alas! his nicer taste to hit,</L>
<L>The Lady's portion paid in <HI>sterling</HI> wit?</L>
<L>On your decrees, to fix her future fate,</L>
<L>Depends our Heiress for her whole estate:</L>
<L>Rich in your smiles, she charms th' admiring town;</L>
<L>A very <HI>bankrupt,</HI> should your chance to frown:</L>
<L>O may a verdict, giv'n in your applause,</L>
<L>Pronounce the prosp'rous issue of her cause,</L>
<L>Confirm the name an anxious parent gave her,</L>
<L>And prove her Heiress of—the Public Favour!</L>

There's phrase—There's a period— Match it if you can.</P>

<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I indeed: I am working upon a quite different plan: but you are as welcome to my cast off style, as you shou'd be to my old embroidery. Pick out the gold if it be of any use.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cast off style! Excellent assur∣ance! And pray, Sir, to whom are you indebted for the very elements of wheedling, and all that has attended it's progress, from the plaything in your nursery, to the brilliant upon your finger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the elements, my honour'd sister, and partner, I confess the obligation; but for the proficiency, I have attain'd the sublime of the science, while you with more experience are still a novice; like a Miss at her stuttering harpsicord, with a nimble finger, but no ear;—You keep in tune, 'tis true, for that is the merit of the instru∣ment, but you are continually out of time, and all-ways thrumming the same key.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which in plain English is as much as to say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>That human vanity is an instrument of such ease and compass, the most unskilful can play something upon it: but to touch it to the true purpose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and look round you pray; these apartments were not furnished from the interest of two miserable thousand pounds in the three per cents, any more than our table and equipage have been maintained by <HI>your</HI> patri∣mony—A land estate of three hundred a year, out of repair, and mortgaged for nearly it's value. I believe I have stated our original fa∣mily circumstances pretty accurately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>They wanted improvement, it must be acknowledg'd. But before we bring our in∣dustry
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
to a comparison, in the name of the old father of flattery, to whom is that perfect phrase address'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>To one worth the pains, I can tell you.—Miss Alscrip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, sensibility to Miss Alscrip! my dear sister, this is too much, even in your own way; had you run changes upon her fortune, stocks, bonds and mortgages; upon Lord Gay∣ville's coronet at her feet, or forty other coro∣nets, to make footballs of, if she pleased,—it would have been plausible; but the quality you have selected—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is one she has no pretensions to, therefore the flattery is more persuasive—that's my maxim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>And mine also, but I don't try it quite so high—Sensibility to Miss Alscrip! you might as well have applied it to her Uncle's Pig-iron, from which she derives her first fifty thousand; or the harder heart of the old Usurer, her Father, from whom she expects the second. But come <STAGE>rings</STAGE> to the business of the morning.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Prompt</HI> <STAGE>the Valet de Chambre.</STAGE></STAGE>
<P>Here Prompt—send out the chairmen with the billets and cards. — Have you any orders, ma∣dam?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>delivering her letter.</STAGE>
<P>This to Miss Alscrip, with my impatient enquiries after her last night's rest, and that she shall have my personal statute in half an hour.—You take care to send to all the lying-in ladies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prompt.</SPEAKER>
<P>At their doors, Madam, before the first load of straw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to all great men that keep the house — Whether for their own disorders, or those of the nation?</P>

<P>To all, Sir—their secretaries, and prin∣cipal clerks.</P>

<P><STAGE>aside to Prompt.</STAGE> How goes on the business you have undertaken for Lord Gayville?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Prompt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have convey'd his letter, and expect this morning to get an answer.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are the attentions that establish valuable friendships in female life. By adapting myself to the whims of one, submitting to the jest of another, assisting the little plots of a third, and taking part against the husbands with all, I am become an absolute essential in the polite world; the very foul of every fashionable party in town or country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>The country! Pshaw! Time thrown away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time thrown away! As if women of fashion left London, to turn freckled shep∣herdesses.
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
—No, no; cards, cards and backgam∣mon, are the delights of rural life; and slightly as you may think of my skill, at the year's end I am no inconsiderable sharer in the pin-money of my society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>A paltry resource — Gambling is a damn'd trade, and I have done with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, 'twas high time.—The women don't pay.— And as for the men, the age grows circumspect in proportion to it's poverty: It's odds but one loses a character to establish a debt, and must fight a duel to obtain the payment. I have a thousand better plans, but two principal ones — And I am only at a loss, which to chuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out with them, I beseech you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I shall marry my friend's in∣tended bride, or his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry his intended bride? — What pig-iron and usury? — Your opinion of her must advance your addresses admirably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord's opinion of her will advance them; he can't bear the sight of her, and defiance of his uncle, Sir Clement Flint's eagerness for the match, is running mad after an adventure, which I, who am his confidant shall keep going till I determine.—There's news for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his sister, Lady Emily, the alternative! The first match in England in beauty, wit, and accomplishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! A fig for her personal charms, she will bring me connexion that wou'd soon sup∣ply fortune; the other wou'd bring fortune enough to make connexion unnecessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as to the certainty of success with the one or the other.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Success!—Are they not women? Why even you can cajole them—What then must I do who have advantage of sex, and am equally ready to adore every feature of the face, or to fall incor∣poreally in love with the mind.—But no more of theory, I must away to practise.—And first for Gayville, and his fellow student Clifford, who is come home with a wise face, and a conceited con∣fidence in his old ascendancy over his Lordship; but thanks to the accident that kept him two months behind, Mr. Monitor will find himself mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beware of the Monitor notwith∣standing in another quarter. Lady Emily and he were acquainted at the age of first impressions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say he always meant to be the compleat friend of the family, tho' without a single talent for the purpose. I question whether he ever made a compliment in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the brute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>His game I find, has been to work upon Lord Gayville's understanding; he thinks he must finally establish himself in his esteem, by in∣exorably opposing all his follies—Poor simple∣ton!—Now my touch of opposition goes only to inhance the value of my acquiescence. So adieu for the morning—You to Miss Alscrip with an unction of flattery fit for a house painter's brush; I to Sir Clement, and his family, with a compo∣sition as delicate as aether, and to be applied with the point of a feather. <STAGE>Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark you, Blandish, a good wish before you go: To make your success compleat, may you find but half your own vanity in those you have to work on!</P>

<P>Thank you, my dear Letty; this is not the only <HI>tap</HI> you have hit me to-day, and you are right; for if you and I did not sometimes speak truth to each other, we should forget there was such a quality incident to the human mind.</P>

<P>My dear Clifford, urge me no more. How can a man of your liberality of sentiment descend to be the advocate of my uncle's family avarice?</P>

<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, you do not live for yourself. You have an ancient name and title to support.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Preposterous policy! Whenever the father builds, games, or electioneers, the heir and title must go to market. Oh the happy families Sir Clement Flint will enumerate, where this practice has prevail'd for centuries; and the estate been improved in every generation, tho' specifically spent by each individual!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you thought with him a month ago, and wrote with transport of the match — <Q>"Whenever you think of Miss Alscrip, visions of equipage and splendor, villas and hotels, the delights of independance and profuseness, dance in your imagination."</Q></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but—the who, the how, the where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I met her walking, and alone; and indeed so humbly circumstanced as to carry a parcel in her own hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot but smile at this opening of your adventure—how many such charmers have we met in our former excursions from Cambridge! I warrant she had a smart hat, and a drawn up pet∣ticoat, like a curtain in festoons, to discover a new buckle, and a neat ancle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Clifford, her dress was such as a judicious painter wou'd chuse to characterize modesty. But natural grace and elegance, stole upon the observation, and through the simplicity of a Quaker, shew'd all we cou'd conceive of a Goddess. I gazed and turn'd idolater.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was under the persecution of one of those beings peculiar to this town, who as∣sume the name of gentlemen upon the sole cre∣dentials of a boot, a switch, and round hat—The <HI>things,</HI> that escape from counters and writing desks to disturb public places, insult foreigners, and put decent women out of countenance. I had no difficulty in the rescue.</P>

<P>And having silenced the dragon, in the true spirit of chivalry, you conducted the damsel to her castle.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>The utmost I could obtain was, leave to put her into a hackney coach, which I followed unperceived and lodged her in the house of an obscure milliner in a bye street.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sweet Cyprian retreat! Such a priestess of your goddess, I dare say, did not refuse access to the shrine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true a few guineas made the milliner my own. I almost liv'd in the house; and often, when I was not suspected to be there, passed whole hours list'ning to a voice, that wou'd have captivated my very soul, tho' it had been her only attraction. At last—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is to follow!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the persuasions of the woman, who laugh'd at my scruples with an unknown girl, a lodger upon a second floor, I hid myself in the closet of her apartment. And the practiced trader assured me I had nothing to fear, from the inter∣ruption of the family.</P>

<P>I confess it, and have been pu∣nish'd.

<P>You need go no farther. I meant to rally you, but your proceedings and emotion alarm me for your peace and honour. If this girl is an adventurer, which I suspect, you are

<P>The lovely wanderer left her lodgings the next morning—but I have again found her—she is in a house of equal retirement, but of very different character, in the city, and inaccessable. I have wrote to her, and knowing her to be distress'd, I have enclos'd Bank Bills for two hundred pounds, the acceptance of which I have urged with all the delicacy I am master of, and by heaven without a purpose of corruption.</P>

<P>Dear Madam, I see you dwell upon my indiscretion in flying to London, but remember the safeguard I expected to find here. How cruel was the disappointment! how danger∣ous have been the consequences!

<P>Suspect every body, if you wou'd be safe—but most of all suspect yourself. Ah, my pretty truant—the heart that is so violent in it's aversions, is in sad danger of being the same in it's affections, depend upon it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Alton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I have not a thought, that I will not sincerely lay open to you. Mr. Heartly is made to please, and to be avoided; I desire never to see him more—his discovery of me here; his letters, his offers, have greatly alarmed me. I conjure you lose not an hour in placing me under the sort of protection I solicited.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sagely.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are resolved, I believe I can serve you. Miss Alscrip, the great Heiress, (you may have heard of the name in your family) has been enquiring among decay'd gentry for a companion.

<P>For the very marriage we have been speaking of. The little fortune my father could call his own was sunk before his death as a provision for my mother; upon an idea that whatever resent∣ment he might personally have incurred—it would not be extended to an innocent offspring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very silly confidence. How readily now, should you and I, Emily, have disco∣ver'd in a sensible old man, the irreconcilable of∣fence of a marriage of the passions—You under∣stand me?</P>

<P>Perfectly! <STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Old petrifaction, your hints always speak forceably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>But your uncle, the present Lord, made amends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amply. He offer'd to send me from Cambridge to an academy in Germany, to fit

me for foreign service: Well judging that a can∣non ball was a fair and quick provision for a poor relation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word I have known un∣cles less considerate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>When Lord Gayville's friendship, and your indulgence, made me the companion of his travels, Lord Hardacre's <HI>undivided</HI> cares devolved upon my sister; whose whole independant possession at my mother's death, was five hundred pounds— All our education had permitted that unhappy parent to lay by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for an act of justice and bene∣volence to reconcile me to the odious man! Tell me this instant what did he do for Miss Clifford?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>He bestow'd upon her forty pounds a year, upon condition that she resided with a family of his dependants in a remote county, to save the family from disgrace; and that allowance, when I heard last from her, he had threaten'd to withdraw, upon her refusing a detestable match he had en∣deavour'd to force upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor girl!</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not go out of the room for that purpose. The schedule of an Heiress's fortune is a compendium of her merits and the true security for marriage happiness.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I guess at your system— <HI>That</HI> union must be most wise which has wealth to support it, and no affections to disturb it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That makes a divorce the first promise of wedlock; and widowhood, the best blessing of life; that separates the interest of hus∣band, wife and child—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>To establish the independent com∣fort of all—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the broad basis of family ha∣tred. Excellent, my dear Uncle, excellent in∣deed; and upon that principle, tho' the Lady is likely to be your niece, and my sister, I am sure you will have no objection to my laughing at her a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll be puzzled to make her more ridiculous than I think her. What is your plan?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why tho' her pride is to be thought a leader in fashions, she is sometimes a servile co∣pyist. Blandish tells me I am her principal model; and what is most provoking, she is intent upon catching my manner as well as my dress, which she exaggerates to an excess that vexes me. Now, if she <HI>will</HI> take me in shade, I'll give her a new outline, I am resolved; and if I do not make her a caricature for a printshop—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will all this be strictly consistent with your good nature, Lady Emily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I don't know when I shall do any thing consistent with it again, except leav∣ing you two critics to a better subject than your humble servant.</P>

<P>Well, Clifford! What do you think of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>That when she professes ill-temper, she is a very aukward counterfeit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her beauty, her wit, her improve∣ment since you went abroad? I expected from a man of your age and taste, something more than a cold compliment upon her temper—Could not you compatibly with the immaculate sincerity you possess, venture as far as admiration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire her, Sir, as I do a bright star in the firmament, and consider the distance of both as equally immeasureable.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Specious rogue! <STAGE>to him.</STAGE> Well, leave Emily then to be wink'd at through telescopes; and now to a matter of nearer obser∣vation—What is Gayville doing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing you desire, Sir, I trust; but you know I have been at home only three days, and have hardly seen him since I came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither; but I find he has profited wonderfully by foreign experience—After rambling half the world over without harm, he is caught like a travell'd woodcock, at his landing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you suspect Lord Gayville of indis∣cretion, why do you not put him candidly to the test? I'll be bound for his ingenuousness not to with-hold any confession you may require.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be right, but he'll confess more to you in an hour, than to me in a month for all that; come, Clifford, look as you ought to do at your interest—Sift him—Watch him—You cannot guess how much you will make me your friend, and how grateful I may be if you will dis∣cover.—</P>
</SP>

Good air and emphasis, and well suited to the trick of the scene—He wou'd do, if the practical part of deceit were as easy at his age, as discernment of it is at mine.

I must employ Blandish in this business—A rascal of a different cast—Below Clifford in hypocrisy, but greatly above him in the scale of impudence— They shall both forward my ends, while they think they are pursuing their own.

<P>Madam, my humiliation (if such it be) is just. Perhaps I have been too proud, and my heart required this self-correction.

<P>There is something strangely mys∣terious and affecting in all this—what delicacy of sentiment—what softness of manners! and how well do these qualities accord with that sigh for Clifford! she had been proud—proud of what?— of Clifford's love. It is too plain. But then to account for her present condition?—He has betrayed and abandoned her—too plain again I fear.—She talk∣ed too of a self corrected heart—take example, Emily, and recal thine from an object, which it ought more than ever to renounce.

<P>How cruel are the circumstances that compel me to leave you under these impressions —nay more—at such a time to urge a request, that during your most favourable thoughts of me wou'd have appear'd strange if not presumptu∣ous. This is the key of my apartment. It con∣tains a secret that the exigency of the hour ob∣lig'd me, against inclination or propriety, to lodge there. Should Sir Clement return before me, I implore you to prevent his discovery, and give to what you find within, your confidence and protection. Lord Gayville—but I shall go too far—the most anxious event of my life presses on me.

<P>That, before Mr. Clifford went abroad, it is suspected his passions betray'd him into a fault that must be shocking to your mora∣lity, and that I'm sure it is not my intention to justify.

<P>Come, Sir; no more of your sar∣casms. I can treat wrong actions with levity, and yet consider them with detestation. Prudes and pretenders condemn with austerity. To the collection of suspicions you are master of, let me add one—In a young lady of the delicacy—and

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOUR knowledge in the profession, Mr. Right∣ly, is as questionless as your integrity; but there is something so surprizing in the discovery of the Charlton estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so strange, that I will not pro∣nounce a positive opinion, till I have read again the collateral papers, and consider'd fully the de∣scents in your family. Your grandfather, I think, was deceived in supposing he had a right to sell that part of the Charlton estate, which Alscrip proposes for his daughter's portion. The strength of this old settlement must have escaped my brother lawyer, or he was mad when he put it into my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you knew too, how the value of the acquisition is enhanced, by the opportune mo∣ment in which it presents itself—I am in too much emotion to thank you as I ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I want neither compliment, nor acknowledgement, for revealing what I should be a party to dishonesty to conceal—but that duty done, wou'd it be an abuse of benevolence, un∣worthy as some of the parties may be, to preserve the peace of all concerned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Clement Flint will renounce the Alscrip alliance, at the first appearance of this defalcation, and if I am well informed, Lord
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
Gayville will not lament the loss of his intended bride. The young lady is therefore free and still possessed of a great inheritance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not yet perceive what you aim at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has the faults that wealth and a false education create, but they are not incurable. Marry her yourself. By sinking the claim in the union with his family, you command the father's approbation; and the daughter must be of a strange mould indeed, if the same obligation does not become a corrective of her pride, and an excitement to her gratitude. <STAGE>smiling</STAGE> I give some token of my friendship, when, as a lawyer, I propose you a wife instead of a suit in chan∣cery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel all the kindness of your sugges∣tion; but if my claim is precarious, it is as re∣pugnant to my delicacy as to my inclination, to realize it upon such terms; if it is substantial, I have such a disposition to make—you have a right to all my thoughts; but I have an appoint∣ment to obey, that admits no time for explana∣tion; favor me for a moment with your pencil, <STAGE>Rightly takes out a pencil and pocket-book.</STAGE> And a blank page in that memorandum book.</P>

<P>Not a disappointment in love, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but in something much nearer your heart—your system is threaten'd with a blow, that I think, and from my soul I hope, it never will recover: would you guess that the sagacious observations of your whole life are upon the point of being confounded by the produc∣tion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what?</P>

<P>My dearest Harriot! the joy I pur∣posed in presenting you here, is anticipated; but, my blameless fugitive! relate the tale of your distresses, and my pride in you will not be a won∣der.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have been short—and are overpaid by your indulgence. Insulted by the fami∣ly I liv'd with; made more wretched by a detested pursuit which my uncle's violence enforc'd, and confident of your being returned, I fled to Lon∣don for an asylum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which has been admirably chosen in my house.</P>
</SP>

<P>Impressed sentiment upon de∣sire, gave honour to passion, and drew from my

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! brother, interpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, your fortune, family, and friends are much oblig'd to you. Your part is perfect—Mr. Clifford you are call'd upon. Miss, in strict propriety, throws the business upon her relations—Come finish the comedy; join one of her hands to the gallants, while, with the other, she covers her blushes—and he in rapture delivers the moral. All for Love, or, the World well Lost. <STAGE>Miss Clifford still appears agitated.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient, my Harriot, this is the school for prejudice, and the lesson of its shame is near.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Alscrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow these singular circumstan∣ces give me quite a confusion of pleasure. The astonishing good fortune of my late Protegée in finding so impassion'd a friendship in her brother's bed-chamber; the captivating eloquence of Lord Gayville in winding up an eclaircissement which I admire—not for the first time—to day—and the superlative joy, Sir Clement must feel at an union, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded upon the purity of the passions, are sub∣jects of such different congratulation, that I hardly know where to begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside</STAGE> Charming!—her insolence will justify what so seldom occurs to one—a severe retort without a possible sense of com∣punction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Alscrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in point of fortune—don't imagine, Sir Clement, I wou'd insinuate that the Lady is destitute—oh Lord, far from it. Her
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
musical talents are a portion—I can't say I have yet seen a countess open a concert for her own benefit; but there can be no reason why a woman of the first quality should not be directress of the Opera—Indeed, after all that has happen'd, it is the best chance I see for a good administration there.</P>

<P>Flaw! who has dared to talk of one? not in my reputation, Sir?</P>

<P>No, but in my estate, which is a damn'd deal worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Alscrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! what?—when!—where? —The estate that was to be settled upon me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alscrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but that <HI>me,</HI> turn'd topsy turvey —when <HI>me</HI> broke into my room this morning, and the devil followed to fly away with all my faculties at once—I am ruin'd—Let us see what you will settle upon your poor father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Alscrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I settle upon <HI>you?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is an embarrassing acci∣dent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, and a pretty help you are, with a drop chin like a frontispiece to the lamen∣tations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>coming forward with Sir Clement.</STAGE> I stated this with some doubt this morning, but now my credit as a lawyer upon the issue.—The Heiress falls short of the terms in your treaty by two thousand pounds a year—which this deed, lately and providentially discover'd, entails upon the heirs of Sir William Charlton, and con∣sequently, in right of his mother, upon this gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy disappointment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Two thousand a year to Clifford! It's pity for the parade of disinterested∣ness, that he open'd his designs upon Emily, be∣fore he knew his pretensions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Now, if there were twenty ceilings, and as many floors, could not I find a spot to settle my silly looks upon.
<STAGE><PB N="105" REF="108"/><HI>Sir Clement observes her with his usual shyness.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>Then turning towards Alscrip</STAGE> Palm a false title upon <HI>me?</HI> I shou'd have thought the attempt beyond the collective assurance of Westminster-hall—and he takes the loss as much to heart as if he bought the estate with his own money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alscrip</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>with hesitation.</STAGE> Sir Clement — what think you—of an amicable adjustment of all these businesses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>ironically.</STAGE> Nothing can be more reasonable. The value of Miss Alscrip's amiable disposition, placed against the abatement of her fortune, is a matter of the most easy computa∣tion; and to decide the portion, Mr. Clifford ought to relinquish of his acquisition — Lady Emily—will you be a referée?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Yes, the Lynx has me—I thought I should not escape— <STAGE>to him.</STAGE> No, Sir; my poor abilities only extend to an amicable en∣deavour here. <STAGE>to Miss Alscrip</STAGE> And really, Miss Alscrip, I see no reason for your being dispirit∣ed, there may be many ready made titles at market, within the reach of your purse. Or, why should not a woman of your consequence originate her own splendour? there's an old ad∣mirer of mine—He wou'd make a very pretty lord—and indeed, wou'd contribute something on his own part to ease the purchase—The Blan∣dish family is well with all administrations, and a new coronet is always as big again as an old one. I don't see how you cou'd lay out part of your independency to more advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> Yes, but since flaws are in fashion, I shall look a little into things before I agree to the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if you replace this part of your family, <STAGE>pointing to Miss Clifford</STAGE> by mak∣ing an humble companion of your old gentle∣man, I protest, I do not see any great alteration in your affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Alscrip</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>aside.</STAGE> I'll die before I'll discover my vexation—and yet, <STAGE>half crying</STAGE> no title—no place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, Miss Alscrip, your place will be found exactly where it ought to be. The public eye in this country is never long deceiv'd —Believe me—and cherish ob∣scurity—Title may bring forward merits, but it also places our defects in horrid relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to expect something from me, Miss Alscrip—Be in no pain for any thing that has pass'd between us—My pity has entirely overpower'd my resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alscrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Molly, the sooner we get out of court the better—we have damnably the worst of this cause, so come along Molly <STAGE>taking her under the arm</STAGE>—and farewel to Berkley-square. Whoever wants Alscrip's house, will find it in the neigh∣bourhood of Furnival's-Inn, with the noble title of Scrivener, in capitals —Blank bonds at the windows, and a brass knocker at the door <STAGE>pulling her.</STAGE> Come along Molly.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blandish.</SPEAKER>
<P>None of your flourishes, my dear sister —they already think you a walking dedication— When we can't escape a situation, the only way is to brave it—So let them tell us we are sycophants. —be it so—then we are the best friends society has. Flattery is the diet of good humour, and not one of you can live without it, and when you quarrel with the family of Blandish, you leave refin'd cookery to be fed upon scraps, by a poor cousin, or a led captain — <STAGE>taking his sister under his arm.</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Precious groupe, fare ye well <STAGE>to Sir Clement.</STAGE> And now, Sir, whatever may be your determinations towards me—here are pretensions you may patronize without breach of discretion. The estate which devolves to my friend—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>To prevent errors, is not his to be∣stow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>What now—more flaws?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>The estate was his beyond the reach of controversy: but before he was truly sure of it, on his way to Hyde-Park did this spendthrift, by a stroke of his pen, divest himself of every shil∣ling—Here is the covenant by which he binds himself to execute proper conveyances as soon as the necessary forms can be gone through.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in favour of whom is this desperate act?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of a most dangerous seducer—a little mercenary, that when she gets hold of the heart, does not leave an atom of it our own.</P>
</SP>

<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rightly.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>with feeling.</STAGE> And there she stands; <STAGE>pointing to Miss Clifford</STAGE> with a look and an emo∣tion that wou' d condemn her before any court in the universe.</P>

<P>Glorious—matchless Clifford!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, this must not be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your pardon, my dear Harriet, it is done. Sir Clement, my sister's fortune is still far short of what you expected with Miss Alscrip; for that deficiency, I have only to offer the virtues, Lord Gayville has proved, and the affection she found it easier to control than to coneeal. If you will receive her, thus circumstanced, into your family, mine has been an acquisition indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady. Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Coming up to Sir Clement.</STAGE> Now, Sir, where's suspicion! Where is now the ruling principle that governs mankind! Thro' what per∣spective, by what trial, will you find self-interest here? What, not one pithy word to mock my credulity!—Alas! poor Yorick—quite chop-fallen. —Forgive me, Sir, I own I am agitated to ex∣travagance—You thought me disconcerted at the
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
first discovery; I am delighted at the last, there's a problem in my disposition worthy your solving.</P>

<P>Mr. Clifford's engagement, Sir, <STAGE>Gives the paper, Sir Clement looks it over and tears it.</STAGE> What do you mean, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>To cancel the obligation, and pay the equivalent to Gayville, or if Clifford will have his own way and become a beggar by renewing it, to make an heiress of my own for his reparation— and there <HI>she</HI> stands <STAGE>pointing to Lady Emily</STAGE> With sensibility and vivacity so uncommonly blended, that they extract benevolence where ever it exists, and create it where it never was before—Your point is carried—You may both fall upon your knees, for the consent of ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Gayville.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>to Miss Clifford.</STAGE> In this happy moment, let my errors be forgot, and my love alone remember'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>With these sanctions for my avowal—I will not deny that I saw and felt the sincerity of your attachment, from the time it was capable of being restrained by respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clifford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Words are wanting, Lady Emily —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish they may with all my heart, but it is generally remarked that wanting words, is the beginning of a florid set speech—To be seri∣ous, Clifford—We want but little explanation on either side—Sir Clement, will tell you how long we have conversed by our actions. <STAGE>Gives her hand</STAGE> My dear Uncle, how a smile becomes you in its natural meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Clement.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you think me a convert, you are mistaken, I have ever believ'd <HI>self</HI> to be the pre∣dominant
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
principle of the human mind—My heart at this instant confirms the doctrine—There's my problem for yours, my dear Emily, and may all who hear me agree in this solution—to reward the deserving, and make those we love happy, is self-interest in the extreme.</P>
