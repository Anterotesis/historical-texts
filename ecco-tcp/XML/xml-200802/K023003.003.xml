<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>R. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Project to usher his Letters into the World by my Means, was the Foundation of this Scheme of <HI>A Literary Cor∣respondence;</HI> which has been so well re∣ceived, that it shall be continued while People of Taste approve of it: And that will be as long as People of Taste, who have valuable Performances in this Kind in their Power, contribute their Stores to the Emolument of Mankind. Not but that I am always ready and willing to pur∣chase any Genuine Pieces from such Pos∣sessors as expect a <HI>Premium.</HI></P>
<P>The second Volume of this Work pro∣mised (besides Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s) to contain Let∣ters to and from Lord <HI>Somers,</HI> &amp;c. notwith∣standing which, Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his Spleen, has employed his Sifters to talk his Sense of the Matter to me; particularly 'Squire <HI>Brocade,</HI> whose Objections, intermixed with my Answers, make a very notable Scene, to the following Effect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> how comes it that you call this Second Volume <HI>Mr.</HI> Pope's <HI>Correspon∣dence,</HI> when there is so much more of other Peoples: This is a mere Imposition upon the Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, be pleased to read the Title-Page. I began this Collection chiefly upon what re∣main'd of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, and besides finding most of my Customers eager to see the Minds of Men, especially in the Case of <HI>Epistolary Writing;</HI> and having considerable Supplies of the Kind, I published a <HI>Second Volume,</HI> as you see; and have Materials of equal Value, and sufficient in Quantity, to make a <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>Fourth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>D—n me, I do not desire to read any Man's Writings but <HI>Pope</HI>'s; he's the only Writer of the Age; his Equal never lived in any Time or Country. There's nothing worth reading in either of your Volumes but what is his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, It is not my Business to set up my Opinion against that of Gentlemen who do me the Favour to call at my Shop, but some of my Customers, whose Judg∣ment is much esteemed among their Ac∣quaintance,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
have said that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Share in this Second Volume is the very worst Part of the Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Z—</HI>s! what do you mean by that? Will you pretend to name any Writer in Competition with Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, they do pretend to say, that the Pieces of Bishop ATTERBURY in this Vo∣lume, are something beyond Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Compass: His Style in <HI>Prose,</HI> his Judgment in the Critical-Taste, his Heroic Love of his Country, his Vindication of Lord <HI>Cla∣rendon</HI>'s History from an unattested Ca∣lumny, and his ABSALON &amp; ACHITOPHEL, tho' done when he was a Youth at the Uni∣versity, are all inimitable by Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Judges are Blockheads, there's not a polite Man about the Town reads any Thing but what is <HI>Pope</HI>'s. How imper∣tinent is it to publish that <HI>Absalon &amp; Achi∣tophel</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> without getting it translated for the Ladies, if it be good for any Thing? What a Pox, do you think Gentlemen must be at the Slavery, like School-boys, of con∣struing it to them in <HI>English?</HI> It would be well for you if you could pacify Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> perhaps if he and you were Friends, he might be prevailed on to take a hundred Guineas to do it for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I presume you have seen the Poem, in its <HI>English</HI> Original, by Mr. <HI>Dry∣den.</HI> I doubt whether the Public would desire Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s finishing Hand to that Piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dryden</HI> was a tolerable Poet in his Time, but nothing in Comparison to <HI>Pope.</HI> There's <HI>Le Neve</HI>'s <HI>Will and Creed,</HI> I like well enough, because they contain partly my own Religion: But there's his Epitaph in <HI>Latin,</HI> why is not that translated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, Sir, it contains some Parti∣culars that cannot be so well expressed in any other Language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I think as I please; but what do you mean by those Political Letters of <HI>Addison, Prior, Harley,</HI> and the rest; there is not any <HI>Wit</HI> in them, surely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it, Sir, because the Wri∣ters of them did not intend it: But I am told there is much <HI>Good Sense</HI> in them; that they open the Scene of the famous <HI>Partition Treaty,</HI> and the Designs of <HI>France</HI> upon the Death of King CHARLES II. of <HI>Spain;</HI> that they discover the Importance of a Man who is trusted with Affairs, and how mere <HI>un homme sans consequence</HI> a Man may be, with a great Employment, if the Conduct of the secret Springs of Action is placed in other Hands: With many other useful Lessons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> you are a great Politician.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little of a Politician truly, Sir: But since there are some Gentlemen inclined to adore a single Name among the polite Writers, to the Prejudice of all the rest, and to point me out as Heretical, for being of a different Opinion, it is necessary I should be able to give some Reason for my Dissent; and that, I apprehend, is done to the Purpose, if I am able to shew the Ex∣cellency, the Superiority, of many others over Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in this Epistolary Taste especially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> have you sorted your Materials for your <HI>Third Volume.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you make it a Secret, or may we be informed what the principal Parts are to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll inform you with Pleasure; it is no Secret at all, I assure you. There are more of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Letters to Ladies, particularly her Grace the Duchess of <HI>Buck∣inghamshire:</HI> Some very pretty Letters of Mrs. <HI>Manley,</HI> full of true Humour, perfectly picturesque, in a genteel unaffected Style, natively pleasant, and, as <HI>Horace</HI> says, <HI>sim∣plex munditiis.</HI></P>
<P>There are excellent ones of the late Lord <HI>Lansdowne:</HI> They convince the Reader of
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
the Patriot, the <HI>Englishman,</HI> the Christian, the Tenderness of the most humane Mind, the Politeness of the finest Gentleman, the Dignity of the <HI>British</HI> Peer, are here united, and shine forth with full Lustre in the utmost Propriety and Perspicuity of Language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You flourish abundantly, <HI>Curll;</HI> why <HI>Lansaowne</HI> was a <HI>Jacobite.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, you are quite out; read his Lordship's Character of Queen CAROLINE. My Lord was indeed very young when he wrote some of these Letters, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was not then landed. But, I presume, had it been so, a <HI>Jacobite</HI> might possibly be a Man of Wit; for Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is allowed to be so, tho' he owns himself a Papist. But here are Letters of my Lord's, that shew other Sort of Sentiments at a riper Age, with Regard to the Revolution Settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, are there any other Writers in your Third Volume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir, we are only got for∣ward 110 Pages, and then we present you an invaluable Tract of Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI>'s: Be pleased, Sir, to read Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Opinion of him and of this Piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I pay no Regard to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Flattery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Wycherley</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI> for That! But hear, Sir, how Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> sings:<Q><L>To <HI>Walsh</HI> the Wit of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> was known,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Author's Merit but his own.</L></Q></P>
<P>And, in his Epistle to <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> he prides himself that,<Q><L>The knowing <HI>Walsh</HI> wou'd tell him he cou'd write.</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I see it appears by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> was a very great Man. Are we to have any Thing more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, The <HI>Hospital of Fools</HI> is an Imitation of <HI>Lucian,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Walsh,</HI> and Gentlemen of the best Taste among my Cus∣tomers agree, that <HI>Lucian</HI> wrote nothing equal to it. I had forgot to mention a Letter concerning Asses, containing abun∣dance of Wit. The rest of the Book will consist of Dr. <HI>Atterbury</HI>'s Pieces translated, Letters of Lady <HI>Chudleigh,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and others of great Character for Wit, or Literature, or both. And there will be some curious Anecdotes concerning that indefatigable Antiquary, the late Mr. <HI>Thomas Hearne</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and his Writings: And relating to that most exemplary, as well as most noble Princess, the late Duchess of <HI>Ormonde,</HI> with a fine Copy of Verses in her Praise, by a greater Man than Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>

I cannot lose any more Time, Sir, in such trifling De∣bates; you are resolved not to like any Writer but Mr. <HI>Pope;</HI> and I am resolved to carry on this Scheme of a <HI>Literary Correspondence,</HI> so long as Works of real Worth are sent me by the polite and judicious Part of Mankind.

<TAILNOTE>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> The FOURTH VOLUME of our LITERARY CORRESPONDENCE will open with a Collection of <HI>Historical Letters,</HI> be∣ginning 1688, and ending 1730, wherein the most important Points of the <HI>British</HI> Affairs are discussed. By an Old Whig. Printed from an Original Manuscript. With which I received the following Letter, from a very eminent Gentleman, of the Long-Robe, upon his reading the Sheets of this Third Volume, as they came from the Press.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. CURLL.</HEAD>
<P>I Have read the Three Volumes of your <HI>Li∣terary Correspondence</HI> with Satisfaction. A Collection of good Letters is much wanted in our Language. The <HI>French</HI> have several; and I think they outdo us in no other Article of polite Literature. Ar∣tificial Letters, written on Purpose to be published, are apt to fall short of the vivid Force and Openness found in the unbosom∣ing of Friend to Friend; therefore it is ex∣treamly difficult to imitate well, as it also is to obtain the Papers of a valuable real Cor∣respondence.</P>
<P>If Gentlemen could be satisfied, there would be no Endeavours to know how Letters came to the Press, I am persuaded, our free, learned, polite Age and Country, might easily find you a genuine Collection in the best Taste.</P>
<P>For my own Part I will not have any Doubt of your Conduct in this Respect; therefore you now receive inclosed the very Mind of a Man of Sense and Rank in his Country, upon public Affairs, from the Re∣volution to the Year 1730. Most of them were Letters to the late Bishop <HI>Atterbury,</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
and the rest, to an intimate Friend of his, who died before him.</P>
<P>The Bishop, a few Months before his Death, lent them to a Nobleman in <HI>France</HI> (from whom I had them) and at the same Time he told him, <HI>they were written by the honestest Whig of his Acquaintance;</HI> that he differ'd from the Writer upon several Points, but look'd upon him to be a good <HI>English∣man</HI> in the main; that he (the Bishop) had been censur'd by his Enemies as a hot Par∣ty-man, but that he could always relish the Correspondence of a Person of Sincerity and Honour, though of different Sentiments in Politics or Religion; and that if he did not live to ask for these Letters again (as he found himself in a declining Condition) he desired they might not be lost, because there was <HI>much Truth and good Sense in them;</HI> but insisted, <HI>that if they went abroad, it would be in such a Manner as not to prejudice the Writer of them in any Branch of his Family, which might have Occasion for the Counte∣nance of Men in Power.</HI></P>
<P>If you think it agreeable to your Scheme, you may publish them; if not, I wish you Supplies more to your Purpose, and am,</P>

But I am to blame to put a Distance between these two things, since Charity has so perfectly united them, that the fond Assistance you afforded your late Brother, should now prove an extra∣ordinary Comfort to you, since God will bestow that on you out of Justice, which others obtain out of his Indulgence; his in∣finite Goodness being such, as will not suf∣fer, unrewarded, so exemplary an Act of Tenderness, as what, thro' a Contempt of your own Life, engaged you in the Offices of the best and tenderest Sister in the World, beyond the Limits of all Obligations; and by an admirable Constancy, made you as∣sur'd amidst a Danger that terrifies the most daring.</P>

<P>I Here send you the Elegy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, with some other Poetical Pieces, will be found in our FOURTH Volume.</NOTE>, which you have but too often demanded of me, and which heretofore hath indeed been heard by others, but, till now, hath not been read by any.</P>
<P>It is my Wish, that the same Fortune may in this happen to me as hath befallen you; who, after you have for so long time concealed the noblest things in the World, have in the Discovery of it, dazled all those that have seen it. But it is an over-great Fondness for my own Verses, to wish them that Advantage, nor indeed should I wish them better, since they were not made for you: If you think them very ill, you are so much the more obliged to me for them, in that knowing it as well as you, yet I have not forborn sending them to you. And, to deal freely with you, a less Power than what you have within these few Days gained upon me, would not have been suf∣ficient
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
to have prevailed with me to do it: And, without your Command, Madam, they had never known any other Place than that of my own Memory. But it is high time it were delivered of them, to make room for something more delightful; I mean that which Mrs. **** had the Grace to acquaint me with the other Day, and which fills it so much at present, that I doubt whether there be Place for any thing else.</P>
<P>I perceive, Madam, that where it was my Design to send you a Letter of Excuse and Compliment, I am fallen into one of Love; but I wish all the other Defects you shall find in it, were as pardonable as that. In the mean time let me assure you, that I have not of a long time been so engaged, and that there are many in the World to whom I would not say so much, even tho' they held a Dagger at my Throat.</P>
<P>But, since there is no fear of any Scan∣dal, you are obliged, Madam, at least in my Opinion, to look favourably on those Elements of Affection, were it but to see, how I should behave myself, if I should fall in Love; and, if I were permitted, what might be the Consequence of it.</P>

In like manner, Madam, considering the Reputation you do me, if I envy his, it is not so much that which he hath acquired, as what you have bestowed on him, and he hath received no Honours which I do not look upon below my own, unless it be that you do him, when you call him your Gal∣lant. Neither his own Vanity nor his Flat∣terers have ever advanced any thing so ad∣vantageous to him, and the Quality of the Son of <HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI> was not so glorious as that. But, if nothing can cure me of
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>
the Jealousy I have of it, yet, Madam, knowing you as I do, I am confident, if you do him that Favour, it is not so much because he is the greatest of Mankind, as because it is Two Thousand Years since he was.</P>
<P>However it be, we may see, in this, the Greatness of his Fortune, which not able to forsake him so many Years after his Death, adds to his Conquests a Person which cele∣brates them more than the Wife and Daugh∣ter of <HI>Darius,</HI> and hath re-infused into him a Soul greater than that of the World he hath subdued.</P>
<P>I should fear, by your Example, to write in too high a Stile, but can a Man aim at one too high, speaking of you, and <HI>Alexan∣der?</HI> I beseech you, Madam, to assure your self I have for you the same Passion which you have for him, and that the Admiration of your Virtues shall ever engage me to be, Madam,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could never believe it possible that the Receipt of a Letter from you should add to my Affliction, or that you could have possibly sent me such bad News, as that you could not comfort me at the same time.</P>
<P>I thought my Unhappiness at such a Point as could not admit of any Addition, and that since you were able something to strengthen my Patience to endure the Ab∣sence of your Mother and You, there could not be any Misfortune which You could not have encouraged me to suffer. But give me leave to tell you, that I have found the contrary in the Affliction I have for the Death of Mrs. <HI>A****,</HI> which hath been heavy enough to crush me, and want∣ed not much to spend the Remainder of my Patience.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="25"/>
You may easily judge, Madam, what an excessive Grief it must needs be to me to have lost a Friend so good, so sprightly and so accomplished as she, and one that hav∣ing always given me so many Expressions of her Affection, would needs do some∣thing when she had not many Hours to continue here. But tho' I reflected not on my own Concernments, yet could I not but infinitely regret a Person by whom you were infinitely beloved; and who, among many particular Endowments, had that of knowing you as much as may be, and esteeming you above all things. Yet I must confess, if this Disturbance can admit of any Remission, it is to reflect on the Con∣stancy she expressed, and the Fortitude wherewith she hath suffered a Thing whereof the Name would make her trem∣ble at any time.</P>
<P>I am extremely comforted to understand, that at her Death, she had those Qualities which only she wanted in her Life, and that she so opportunely found Courage and Resolution. When I consider it seriously, it is somewhat against my Conscience to bemoan her, and methinks it speaks an over-interested Affection, to be sad because she hath left us to better her Condition, and is gone into the other World, (<HI>from</HI>
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26"/>
<HI>whose Bourne no Traveller returns</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAMLET.</NOTE>) to find that Quiet she could never meet with in this.</P>
<P>I very heartily entertain the Exhortations you give me thereupon, which is, often to con over a Lesson so profitable and neces∣sary, and to prepare myself for the like one Day; I know how to make my Advantage of your Remonstrance. The Miseries we have run thro' all this while is no small Preparation for it: There's no better Lec∣ture to instruct a Man how to die well, than not to take much Pleasure in living.</P>
<P>But if it be not impossible for the Hopes that Fortune proposes to prove effectual; if after so many Years, we may presume to expect some few fair Days, be pleased to give me leave, Madam, to entertain Thoughts more diverting than those of Death; and if it be likely that we are shortly to see one another, let me not fall out with my Life.</P>
<P>Where you say, <HI>You think me destined to great Things,</HI> you give so great Security of my Life, and so happy a Presage of the Adventures that shall happen to me, that I shall not be sorry for its Continuance yet
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27"/>
a while. For my part, if Destiny doth promise me any thing that is good, I assure you I will do my utmost to get it. I will contribute all I can thereto, that <HI>your Pro∣phesies may be fulfilled.</HI> In the mean time, I beseech you to be confident, that of all the Favours I can beg of Fortune, what I most passionately desire is, that she would do for you what she ought, and for myself, only afford me the Means to acquaint you with the Passion which obliges me to be so much,</P>

<P>THese Memoirs go no farther than the Parliament's resolving to treat no more with the King. My Lord <HI>Holles</HI> was of the Presbyterian Party, zealous at first, to take Arms against the King, but would not have carried it so far as the Independents did; he writes very virulently against them, gives Instances of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s and <HI>Haslerig</HI>'s Cowar∣dice, as may be seen in the annexed Ta∣ble;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Table in the Manuscript.</NOTE> mentions Lord <HI>Savile</HI> as an Impostor, who accused himself and others.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="50"/>
This Book is an Apology for the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Presbyterians, and a Satire against the Army and Independents, but wrote in so an∣gry and declaiming a Stile, that it does not please me; it treats only of public Facts known to every body, and tells none of those secret Intrigues, Schemes, Conferen∣ces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are what is most valuable in these sort of Books.</P>

<HEAD>TO Sir BERKELEY LUCY, Bart.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT Mr. <HI>Nelson,</HI> in his Life of Bi∣shop <HI>Bull,</HI> says of that learned Pre∣late, may with the strictest Veracity be ap∣plied to Mr. <HI>Collins, viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He hath receiv∣ed so great a Brightness from his own Pen, that it needs no auxiliary Light to increase its Lustre;"</Q> and his Character is so secure, from the Example of his Life, that all Calumnies raised against it, fly like <HI>Chaff before the Wind.</HI></P>
<P>By a Letter from <HI>King</HI>'s-College, <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> I am informed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Mr. <HI>Collins</HI> was bred at <HI>Eton,</HI> in quality of an Oppidane; where he was very remarkable, even while a Boy, for a good Taste of the Classics, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He was admitted a Fellow-Commoner of <HI>King</HI>'s-College, <HI>July</HI> 8, 1693, where, under the Tuition of Dr. <HI>Hare,</HI> he was soon perceived to grow in∣defatigable in the roughest Tracts of Phi∣losophy, particularly the <HI>Ars Cogitandi:</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="54"/>
He was almost a singular Example a∣mong those of his Station. <HI>Rarus ferme communis sensus in illa fortuna,</HI> says <HI>Horace,</HI> is as applicable to a Man of flourishing Circumstances, as to the Patriot; and tho' it has been much controverted what was the Poet's View, yet in both Lights Mr. <HI>Collins</HI> has been thought to be an Exception."</Q></P>
<P>Since Mr. LOCKE hath declared, that he <HI>considered Mr.</HI> COLLINS <HI>as a Philosopher, and a Christian,</HI> all the sneering and lucra∣tive Sarcasms of <HI>Ecclesiastics</HI> ought to be held in the utmost Contempt. His Chara∣cter is so secure from the Example of his Life, that I am the less concerned for my own Inability, to embalm his Memory; especially as the Weight and Importance of the Matter will make some Amends for those Defects which may arise from the Manner of handling it.</P>
<P>That Part of <HI>Biography,</HI> Sir, which records Men famous in the Republic of Letters, is generally acceptable to the Learned, be∣cause it attempteth to gratify a Curiosity, which prevaileth much, and is nourished among them; whereby they are prompted to search for, and enquire after the minutest Circumstances, which relate to such Authors, who are no otherwise known to them, than by the Works they have left behind them.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="55"/>
And now, Sir, as the best, and most firm Basis I can lay, for the Support of my Superstructure, give me Leave to mortify the wrangling Priesthood, by ex∣hibiting the sincere Sentiments Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> had of Mr. <HI>Collins</HI>'s Virtues and Abilities: A Character which I am certain, with all those who knew his intrinsic Worth, will turn the Balance even against the Constitu∣tions of Popes, the Decrees of Councils, or the Cavils of Convocations.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"You have exceedingly obliged me (says Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> to Mr. <HI>Collins</HI>) in the Books, <HI>of Yours,</HI> that you have sent me; and <HI>(continues our immortal Christian Philosopher)</HI> I am over-joyed with an Intimation I have re∣ceived <HI>also,</HI> that gives me Hopes of see∣ing You next Week. You are a cha∣ritable good Friend, and are resolved to make the Decays and Dregs of my Life the pleasantest Part of it; for I know nothing calls me back to a pleasant Sense of Enjoyment, and makes my Days so gay and lively, as your good Company. Come then, and multiply happy Mi∣nutes upon, and rejoice in the Good you do me; for I am, with a perfect Esteem and Respect,"</P>

Upon Mr. <HI>Collins</HI>'s Return to Town, 1703, after paying the Visit mentioned in the foregoing Letter, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> returns him the following Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>I owe you my Thanks, for the greatest Favour I can receive, the Confirmation of your Friendship, by the Visit I lately re∣ceived from you.—<HI>In some other Letters he thus expresses himself.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Mr. <HI>Collins,</HI> with whom if I desire to live upon equal Terms, it is not that I forget how much he is superior to me in many Things, wherein he will always have the Precedency.—You make my Life, since I have had <HI>your</HI> Friendship, much more valuable to me than it was before.—Tho' my Friendship be of very little Va∣lue or Use, yet being the best Thing I have to give, I shall not forwardly bestow it, where I do not think there is Worth and Sincerity: And therefore, pray pardon me the Forwardness wherewith I throw my Arms about your Neck; and holding you so, tell you, you must not hope, by any Thing that looks like Compliment, to keep one at a civiller and more fashionable Distance.—Yours of the 16th Instant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1703-4</NOTE> makes me love and value you, if it were possible, more than I did before; you having there∣in,

in short, so well described, wherein the Happiness of a rational Creature in this World consists: Tho' there are very few who make any other Use of their half-em∣ployed and undervalued Reason, but to bandy against it. 'Tis well, as you observe, that they agree as ill with one another, as they do with common Sense. For when by the Influence of some prevailing Head, they all lean one Way; Truth is sure to be borne down, and there is nothing so dan∣gerous, as to make any Enquiry after her; and to own her, for her own sake, is the most unpardonable Crime.—'Tis no small Advantage to me to have found such a Friend, at the last Scene of my Life; when I am good for nothing, and am grown so useless, that I cannot but be sure, that in every good Office you do me, you can propose to your self no other Advantage, but the Pleasure of doing it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter of 19. <HI>March</HI> 1704.</NOTE>—Give me leave to desire you, to bestow some of your spare Hours on the <HI>Epistles to the Corinthians,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Paraph. on those Epistles.</NOTE> and to try whether you can find them intelligible or no.—If I regret my old Age, it is you that make me, and calls me back to the World just as I was leaving of it, and leaving it as a Place that had very little valuable in it: But
<PB N="27" REF="58"/>
who would not be glad to spend some Years with you?—He that has any thing to do with you, must own, that Friendship is the natural Product of your Constitution, and your Soul, a noble Soil, is enriched with the <HI>two</HI> most valuable Qualities of human Nature, <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Friendship.</HI> What a Treasure have I then in such a Friend, with whom I can converse, and be en∣lightened about the highest Speculations!</P>
<P>Souls, Sir <HI>Berkeley,</HI> endowed like Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Collin</HI>'s, or <HI>your own,</HI> were made to converse with each other only, far very far, removed from the Insolence of Priests or the Pedantry of Schools! such stoical Apathy as they <HI>were,</HI> and you <HI>are</HI> possessed with, put Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> upon leav∣ing us this perpetual Memento in his <HI>Cam∣paign.</HI><Q><L>Great Souls by Instinct, to each other turn,</L>

<L>Rais'd of themselves, their genuine Charms they boast.</L>
<L>And those who paint them <HI>truest,</HI> praise them <HI>most.</HI></L></Q></P>

<HEAD>A LETTER To Mr. P***</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>EJOICE with me, my Friend, there is Probability of mine Ad∣vancement, this is the Reign of Expectancy. Never, if not now, shall I become considera∣ble: Places of National and mighty Trust, are given to those the World will trust no longer. Emulous of the <HI>Roman</HI> Simplicity, our Nobility, like so many CINCINNA∣TUS's, seem to be taken from the Plough; our Clergy, representing the Mechanic Pis∣catory Founders of Christianity, are Men of mean Descent, and altogether as emi∣nent for their Ignorance. But as the uninterrupted Succession of their Apostle∣ship is most undeniable, the Lord in∣spire these with those. <HI>Saul</HI> from a Ten∣der
<PB N="30" REF="61"/>
of his Father's ASSES, became a ten∣der Father to the People <HI>Israel,</HI> and left his former Care. <HI>Caesar</HI> too was called to be a King, but he retained his ASSES; some he made Judges, some Bishops, and some Ambassadors, which occasioned the Scoffers to say, that <HI>Caesar</HI> only wore the <HI>Lion</HI>'s Skin. What led me, I believe, to this Subject, was the hearing of Papers now crying about the Streets, intitled, <HI>The Con∣gress of Asses;</HI> which naturally brought to my Remembrance, many Folks and Occur∣rences, both at Home and Abroad. We have a Poet Laureat here, Thanks to my Lord Chamberlain, now grown old, who is twice a-Year brought forth to be kicked at by his Brethren.</P>
<Q><L>The Heels of ev'ry <HI>Ass</HI> salute <HI>old C—</HI></L></Q>
<P>If Dean <HI>B—</HI> or Doctor <HI>S—</HI> pride themselves too highly on the Linguose Fa∣culty, may not the Ass of <HI>Balaam</HI> serve for their Reproof, as well as he did for that of his Master. Nothing seems to me more unjust, than the Contempt which is offered to this noble ANIMAL by the Vul∣gar, who mistake his solemn Majesty for Dullness. Should this Epistle ever appear in Public, as I hope it never will, I am sensible it would be thought an insinuating
<PB N="31" REF="62"/>
Artifice of mine, to get a Place at Court, or recommend myself to Somebody in Power; whereas, I have no such Intention, I assure you, but shall disinterestedly, and without Flattery, as far as I am able, take away part of the Burden from the Back of this generous Beast: For, What is heavier than an ill Name? in doing which, I have only imitated the renowned <HI>Osborn's</HI> and <HI>Walsingham's</HI> of these our Times, whose Labours I must acknowledge to be as far superior to mine, as they are more diffi∣cult: But to proceed; ASSES formerly were not contemptible, their Names were not made a Reproach; they sometimes were cloathed in Furs like our Aldermen, and sometimes in Scarlet, and Cloath of Gold, and King's and Princes used to ride upon them. <HI>Midas,</HI> a <HI>Phrygian</HI> Monarch, had himself the Ears of an Ass, which was in those Days, held an uncommon Thing. Kings will not, out of brotherly Affection, despise them, moreover this stately Beast is not to be prevailed upon by Blows; the venerable Dispensers of our Laws are not endowed with more Gravity; all the Holy-gifted ones, should respect him as an Elder, and one of themselves; for he once spoke by the same Divine Power, they would be thought to speak by: Besides, he has that in him, which is well Worthy of
<PB N="32" REF="63"/>
their Imitation, I mean his <HI>Patience.</HI> Both Sacred and Profane History have emble∣matized Strength and Heroism by the Ass, than which, nothing can be more natural, noble, beautiful, or just. <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he blesses his Sons, says, Issachar <HI>is a strong</HI> Ass, <HI>crouching down between two Burdens.</HI> And <HI>Homer,</HI> in the Eleventh Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> compares <HI>Ajax,</HI> making a noble Retreat, to one of these <HI>Animals</HI> forcing his Way into a Field of Corn, there satisfying his Hunger, and then retiring with a tardy sullen Intrepidity, Maugre the Opposition of a Troop of Boys,
<Q><L>Whose ratt'ling Strokes resound upon his Sides.</L></Q>
Had I nothing else to offer in their Behalf, the above-mentioned Instances are sufficient to abate all Ridicule, and draw Respect from the viperous Tongue of Calumny itself.</P>
<P>But farther, the most eminent Poets, Orators, Historians and Naturalists, have not thought it beneath them to treat of the Ass, either in Metaphor, Simile, or De∣scription Narrative. <HI>Pliny Lib.</HI> 11. <HI>Cap.</HI> 37. gives large Account of him, describes his Na∣ture, Passions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and shews us what Judg∣ment we are to form of the pricking-up, and what from the limber and half-erected Position of his Ears. <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions him but sparingly. <HI>Horace</HI> more frequent, the
<PB N="33" REF="64"/>
<HI>Thirteenth Epistle of his First Book,</HI> is wrote <HI>Ad Vinnium Asellum,</HI> whom he banters on his <HI>Name.</HI> He was to present <HI>Horace</HI>'s Poems to <HI>Augustus,</HI> who desires, <HI>if they are too burthensome to him, that he will cast them away, and not bear them like Panniers, to be laugh'd at, and get the Surname of</HI> Ass, <HI>be∣cause his Paternal one was</HI> ASELLA. <HI>Cicero</HI> speaks of one <HI>Asellius Sempronius,</HI> an Histo∣rian, by which we know this Name to have been considerable with the <HI>Romans.</HI> There are likewise <HI>two</HI> Stars in <HI>Cancer,</HI> called the ASELLI; and <HI>Silenus,</HI> the Foster-Father of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> according to <HI>Ovid,</HI> was always mounted upon an Ass. I shall here re∣peat something truly Poetical, spoken of the Ass in our own Language, not inferior to any thing of the Ancients. It is taken from the DUNCIAD, where no less than a Goddess proclaims several Sorts of Games, and promises a Drum to him of all her Favourites, who shall out-voice the Ass.</P>
<Q><L>And his this <HI>Drum,</HI> whose hoarse Heroic Base,</L>
<L>Drowns the loud Clarion of the braying <HI>Ass.</HI></L></Q>
<P>First having encouraged her Children, they begin the Sports; the Goddess thus giving the Word of Command,<Q><L>Sound forth my Brayers, and the Welkin rend.</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="65"/>
As when the long-ear'd, milky Mothers wait,</L>
<L>At some sick Miser's triple-bolted Gate,</L>
<L>For their defrauded, absent Foals, they make</L>
<L>A Moan so loud, that all the Guild awake.</L>
<L>Sore sighs Sir <HI>Gilbert,</HI> starting at the Bray,</L>
<L>From Dreams of Millions, and three Groats to pay:</L>
<L>So swells each Wind-pipe, <HI>Ass</HI> intones to <HI>Ass,</HI></L>
<L>Harmonic Twang, of Leather, Horn, and Brass:</L>
<L>Such as from lab'ring Lungs, th' Enthusiast blows,</L>
<L>High Sounds attempted to the vocal Nose;</L>
<L>But far o'er all Sonorous <HI>Blackmore</HI>'s strain,</L>
<L>Walls, Steeples, Skies, bray back to him again.</L>
<L>In <HI>Tot'nham-Fields,</HI> the Brethren in amaze,</L>
<L>Prick all their Ears up, and forget to graze.</L>
<L>Long <HI>Chanc'ry-Lane,</HI> retentive rolls the Sound,</L>
<L>And Courts to Courts, return it round and round.</L>
<L><HI>Thames</HI> wafts it thence to <HI>Rufus'</HI> roaring Hall,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hungerford</HI> re-echoes Bawl for Bawl.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="66"/>
Scarce do I know whether the Ass is more indebted to the Poet for this excellent Description of him, or the Poet to the Ass, for those Qualifications of his, which were the Occasion of it: But certain I am, that every Language is enriched with ma∣ny terse Sayings, Proverbs and Sentences, drawn from the known Qualities of this Quadrupede, <HI>fait en dos d'Asne,</HI> signifies any Thing done with Cunning. <HI>Asinus Antro∣nius</HI> is a Lob-Cock. <HI>Asinus ad Lyram,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the Greek, are Proverbs which seem to reflect upon the Ass for his Unskilfulness in Music; whereas the con∣trary is manifest, for this Animal pays an extraordinary Attention to every sort of Wind-Music, as may be easily discover'd by the pricking-up of his Ears, his simpering Gesture, his frolic Spurning of the Heels, attended by the Clangor of his own Pipe, with a seeming Desire to bear a Part. It is most unquestionable, that he has the Ad∣vantage of all other Beasts, the Sounds he utters being more articulate: And many learned Critics agree, that no living Pipe so nearly resembles the Hautboy, Bagpipe, or that more admired new-invented Water-Music, the French-Horn; the Perfor∣mers upon which Instruments, if he does
<PB N="36" REF="67"/>
not excel every body, will readily allow, it is not for want of <HI>Ear.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> was sneered at by the Critics; but what will not Critics sneer, for applying the Word <HI>Bray</HI> to the Sound of Armour, War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which must needs have been right in him; for if the Hero himself is justly likened to an Ass, there is, as it were, a Chain of Propriety, in com∣paring the Noise of Arms and Clangor of the Battle, to Braying:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><BIBL>Vide Milton, lib. 6. lin. 209.</BIBL><L>—Arms on Armour clashing bray'd,</L>
<L>Horrible Discord—</L></Q>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> we see, was but a later Copiest of this Beau∣ty; he, it seems, stole it from <HI>Milton,</HI> who stole it from <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> who stole it from the Ancients, his Predecessors, who copied from Nature.</P></NOTE> There are others also, who reflect upon the Ass for his Ears, which is whimsical indeed; and I doubt not but that this Clamour proceeds from those only who have lost their Own. While I treat of this Subject, methinks I feel some of that Assistance which the Poets so often call for; I am hurried away, a Flood of Fire pours itself upon me, Nature is over∣power'd violently. Thou, O Art, assist me to restrain her Force, lo! I again subside, steady is my Seat, and tight my Rein. How copious is the Theme I handle! sure∣ly

the World could not contain the Volumes which might be wrote upon it! What I can say is nothing, it would not be esteemed as a Sentence in the great Folio: twelve Books, each twelve Times bigger than Dooms∣Day-Book, are to be wrote solely upon the Milk of this Animal. It is Mother's Milk to half the Nation. It is the Kettle of <HI>Me∣daea,</HI> the Waters of <HI>Aganippe;</HI> to this is owing our remarkable Progress in the libe∣ral Sciences and polite Literature; to this is owing the Politics so nobly defend∣ed by <HI>Walsingham</HI> and <HI>Osborne;</HI> to this is owing the Histories of the <HI>Burnets,</HI> the <HI>Cookes,</HI> and the <HI>Oldmixons,</HI> the Divinity of the <HI>Henleys</HI> and the <HI>Fosters,</HI> the Physic of the <HI>Misaubins</HI> and the <HI>Wards,</HI> the Poetry of the <HI>Fieldings</HI> and the <HI>Savages:</HI> And to this is owing these my Labours. To this also, but whether am I going, those of our Par∣ty already mention'd, are sufficient. How greatly have they laboured to be thought Asses, and how greately have they succeed∣ed—Here I must take Notice of a remark∣able Instance of the Ass's Principles, if that Expression may be permitted me, when our immortal Deliverer landed at <HI>Torbay,</HI> the vociferous Acclamation of a congre∣gated Drove was heard by Multitudes of his Followers; and if I am not misinform∣ed, the famous Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> assured them,
<PB N="38" REF="69"/>
it was a happy Omen; and I doubt not, but that upon the Publication of the second Volume of his History, we shall find that he, after his usual pious Manner, has dis∣cover'd Providence to be eminently inte∣rested in favour of that Undertaking, from the Declaration these Animals made as a sort of joining with their own Party.</P>
<P>I have already exceeded the Limits of a Letter, and shall conclude, after I have inter∣preted two Fables, famous for their Anti∣quity.</P>
<P><HI>First, Oenus,</HI> a Rope-maker in Hell, had an Ass always standing by him, who as fast as he twisted the Cord, bit it asunder; his Labour was thereby rendered abortive, eternally renewed, eternally frustrated.</P>
<P><HI>Oenus</HI> resembles those hellish Ministers, who thro' their evil Counsels make Ropes to bind the People in Slavery. By the Ass is meant the honest Patriot, who, ever watch∣ful for the public Safety, destroys his Schemes, discovers his Designs, drives him to invent new Mischief, which he still renders ineffectual by his Vigilance.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> An Ass being honoured with carrying on his Back the Statue of <HI>Isis,</HI> the People bowed, fell on their Knees, and worshipped the Goddess: The Ass thinking his Merit to be the Cause of their Adoration, grew insolent and proud:
<PB N="39" REF="70"/>
But when he was unloaded, they convinced him by Blows, it was not him they respec∣ted.</P>
<P>By the Ass you are to understand, all such as have Places at Court; what Re∣spect they meet with, is not paid to them, but to their Office; from which, when they are once discarded, every Man carries a Cudgel, which will convince them of the Truth of what I say. I am, my dear Friend, in all Shapes, comforted with Hopes and Expectations,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS small Packet of Letters, tho' written un∣der the Fatigue of Travelling, is a delightful Proof of the true Taste both of the Thoughts and Sense of their inimitable Author. All who had the Happiness of her Conversation, were soon convinced how free she was from the general Frailties of her Sex; what a Nobleness and Generosity of Temper she possessed; how distant her Views from the least Appearance of Self-Interest, or mean Design! How often have I heard her compassionately regretting the Miseries of Mankind, and never her own, but when they prevented her extensive Charity to Others!</P>
<P>Never was she Vindictive against the most inve∣terate Enemy; the innate Softness of her Soul, ren∣dered her Deportment equally obliging to Friends and Foes, and never did she resent but with the strictest Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="72"/>
A Journey to <HI>Exeter</HI> was undertaken by her (on account of a Law-Suit) in the Year 1694, and two Years afterwards, these Letters were made public, without her Leave, by <HI>J.H.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>James Hargrave,</HI> late of the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></NOTE> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> so highly was she disgusted at this ungenerous Treatment, that she caused them to be suppressed.</P>

<P>I Am got, as they tell me, sixteen Miles from You and <HI>London;</HI> but, I cannot help fancying, it is so many Degrees. Tho' <HI>Midsummer</HI> to All besides, in my Breast there is nothing but frozen Imaginations. The Resolutions I have taken of quitting <HI>Lon∣don</HI> (which is, as much as to say, the World) for <HI>ever,</HI> starts back, and asks my gayer Part if it has well weighed the Sense of <HI>Ever?</HI> Nor does your Letter, which I re∣ceived this Morning, taking Coach, less influence me, than when I first formed the Design. You should have used but half these Arguments, and they had undoubted∣ly prevailed. It is of the latest now to ask me why I leave the <HI>crouded</HI> Market, and retire to starve <HI>alone</HI> in Solitude? Whereas you quote the Poet.

But it is not reasonable my Dulness should ex∣tend to You, who have every thing in your Nature just and pleasing. You asked, and I eagerly engaged (because you desired me) to give an Account of myself and Travels, every Stage.

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Am got safe to <HI>Hartley-Row,</HI> and in a little better Humour than when I wrote my last. Our Landlord is a perfect Beau, and most exquisitely performs the Honours of his House. I am in pain for his Assidui∣ty: I cannot fetch a Step, no not to the Window, from the Table, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but he is Squiring me; and so dressed, and so con∣ceited, that nothing but serving a loose Apprenticeship, could have set him up a Master in the Trade of Foppery. He was a <HI>Goldsmith</HI>'s 'Prentice, where he studied more his Pleasures, than Profit. This House fell to him, and he wisely resolved to keep it himself, with the Help of his Sister, who is a neat, housewifely, obliging sort of Woman. I suppose it is, by much, the best Entertainment this Road affords. They have a tolerable Cook; and I was glad to find something I could eat at Three o'Clock, for we came in here at Two, and I can give you a little better Account of my Fellow-Travellers. The <HI>Sir,</HI> I spoke
<PB N="47" REF="78"/>
of, is a Baronet's Son, as he has carefully given me to understand: I take it for gran∣ted, he <HI>likes</HI> me, and would have me do the <HI>same</HI> by him. As he came in, he put off his Travelling Suit, for a Coat and Vest, designed to dazzle the Curate and all his Congregation. The Way I took to morti∣fy his Foppery, was, not to speak a Word of the Change; which made him extream uneasy: At length, cut of all Patience, he desired my Opinion, if his Taylor had used him well? What the Brocade was worth a Yard? How many Ounces of Silver-Fringe? And recommended to my Curio∣sity the exquisite Workmanship of the Loops; and then gave me the Sum Total of his Cost. I answered him, That Finery was lost upon me; I neither was, nor pre∣tended to be a Judge. He pertly answer∣ed, He perceived by my Sullenness, that I had a great deal of Wit; tho' I understood he had but little by his Remark. Well, all this did not do: He would fain have had me enquired into his Family, Intrigues, and Fortune; which when he perceived I had no Curiosity for, 'Faith Madam, <HI>(says he)</HI> I beg your Ladyship's Opinion, if I am not the most unfortunate Man breathing: I'll tell you a very mortifying Adventure. Nay, you must hear me. I vow, this In∣differency does not look natural to you;
<PB N="48" REF="79"/>
your Eyes promise us much more Fire. <HI>I'll shut 'em, thought I, for ever, rather than such a Fop shall find any thing to like them for.</HI> What! no Answer, Madam, <HI>(says he)</HI> I perceive your Attention by your Silence. 'Gad, I love a Person of your Breeding, that know themselves better than to inter∣rupt a good Story. Perhaps Madam is not well with her Journey, <HI>answered Mrs.</HI> May∣oress <HI>of</HI> Totness. Alas! I wonder Riding in the Coach should not have got you a better Stomach. Poor Gentlewoman, she has scarce eat any thing. I'll recompence that by a Feast of the Mind, <HI>answered my Fop.</HI> How say you, Madam, shall I be∣gin the <HI>Regalio?</HI> I had as good consent, <HI>quoth I:</HI> With or without my Leave, I see you are resolv'd upon it. Well then, Ma∣dam, <HI>says he,</HI> since you are disposed to be delighted, I'll about it instantly.</P>
<P>It happened at <HI>Oxford</HI> three Months ago (where I often came, my Father's Estate being not far distant) I saw a Lady, and fell in Love with her; ay Gad, Madam, down∣right in Love with her. She was a Person genteely bred, and had seen the <HI>Beau-Monde,</HI> made the <HI>Tour</HI> of all the Places of Gallan∣try, shined in the Drawing-Room, languish∣ed in the Boxes, adorned the Park; in a Word, was all a Man of my Circumstances
<PB N="49" REF="80"/>
could desire in one he was resolved to make an Oblation of his Heart to. But as her Honour was my Care, and not marrying my Design, I searched for a dexterous Pre∣tence to visit, and be happy. I took Mr. <HI>Slye</HI> with me, a Gentleman of the Town, who had a Wife: To give you the Character of my Friend, He was naturally amorous, had a handsome Person, and Strains of natural Wit beyond whatever I saw in the most Acquired; and your Ladyship must allow me to be a Judge of Wit, by so dexterous∣ly finding out yours, maugre your Silence. I bowed for this extraordinary Compli∣ment; and thought I could not more agreeably return it, than by continuing my Silence; and as the Poet has it, <HI>left him to his dear Mistake.</HI> Mr. <HI>Slye,</HI> continued he, was to propose a Marriage between me and my Lady <HI>Conquest,</HI> to the old People her Relations, whom she was just come to live with: But as soon as he saw her, if I was her First <HI>Oxford</HI> Victim, he was certainly the Second; and, as I found, presently took with her. She had a very fine Hand, which Mr. <HI>Slye,</HI> according to the Country Liberty, kissed; and then, with <HI>Cleveland,</HI> said,
<Q><L>So soft, 'tis Air but once remov'd;</L>
<L>Tender, as 'twere a Jelly Glov'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="50" REF="81"/>
She gave him a Look, which seemed to say, she wondered in that Place at such a Piece of Gallantry; and then pursuing with her Wit the Victory of her Eyes, charm'd my Friend to that Degree, that he told me, he must enjoy her, or die. <HI>'Gad, Madam, was not this a very odd Turn? I carried him to speak for me; and he comes to make me the Confidant of his Designs?</HI> We agreed tho', as Friends should, to keep our mutual Confidence secret from her, and to endeavour each of us to make him∣self happy, and faithfully to relate the Pro∣gress of our Amours. But because the Country is much given to Tatling, the Pretensions of Marriage went on. Lady <HI>Conquest</HI> was Airy and Coquet; loved Com∣pany and Gallantry, if they could be pur∣chased with Safety: But she knew so well how to manage every body, that none durst speak to her, more than she had a mind to hear. I was one of the awed Fools. <HI>'Gad! would you believe, Madam, that Love could make so great an Ass of a Man of my Under∣standing?</HI> And yet it was not altogether that neither, my Pride was concerned; I was resolv'd not to serve for her Diversion, till I was sure she was consenting to be mine; but could no more keep out of her Company, than I could hang myself. I desired her to walk: She consented, with a
<PB N="51" REF="82"/>
Crony she picked up, upon Condition I would engage Mr. <HI>Slye</HI> of the Party. I was jealous, but to no Purpose; either my Rival's Company, or not my Mistress's. <HI>Slye</HI> pretended Fear of his Wife, that he durst not appear in public with any other Woman; for she already began to have Ap∣prehensions of my Lady <HI>Conquest,</HI> whose Way of Living was remote to those of Country-Gentlewomens; and therefore he was resolved to think no more of her; tho' infinitely pleasing to him; for his Fortune depended, in a great measure, upon his Wife's Mother. I came back with this doleful News to Lady <HI>Conquest. Go tell him,</HI> answered she, <HI>he who has pretended to love me, should fear nothing more than not being beloved; and that I command him to meet us at the appointed Place.</HI> I ran, like a Fool, to do her Message, which I believed Raillery, because she ought to have been more cautious of a married Man's Love, if serious. <HI>Slye</HI> wanted but Intreaty: He consented, and we met, but not to my Com∣fort; tho' the Expence was mine, he had the Profit: She was not easy unless he sat nigh her; she talked to him, stared at him, did every thing to shew she was pleased; whilst I, by a Notion of Pride, would pre∣tend nothing, for fear I should not have all: <HI>For 'Gad, Madam, I do not love being baulked thus.</HI> Several Times we met, but all
<PB N="52" REF="83"/>
as little to the Purpose. Undoubtedly, she saw I loved her, but would not see, because I was of Use in her Affair with <HI>Slye.</HI> The whole Town talked of our approach∣ing Wedding, and I began to be Fool enough to resolve on it, thro' <HI>Slye</HI>'s Persuasion, who continually extolled her Honour and Virtue, and tickled my Pride with the News of her Love; but that she wanted a Declaration from me, before I could ex∣pect a Confession from her. I told him, I would think on it; and so we parted. That Night (as Chance would have it) I passed along by the House where she lived, and I found the Gate open: I know not what Devil of Curiosity carried me in; and when in, to go to her Chamber: I did both unseen, and concealed myself behind the Bed, which I saw sitted for Night. I resolved to wait till she should be in Bed, and then to take Advantage of her Woman's Absence, (who lay in the Anti-Chamber) and there to declare my Love, and offer her Marriage. Long I had not waited, <HI>(tho' 'Gad, Madam, I was very im∣patient, and thought every Minute Seven)</HI> when the charming Fair came from her Dressing-Room, with nothing on but her Night-Gown and Slippers, which were soon thrown off, and the Goddess appeared more beauteous than the naked Queen of Love. The happy Bed soon received her;
<PB N="53" REF="84"/>
and she cryed, <HI>Haste, and bring my Lover to me.</HI> At these Words her Woman went into the Anti-Chamber, and returned soft∣ly with <HI>Slye;</HI> who flew to her Arms, sigh∣ed, kissed, and died there.—<HI>Imagine my Surprize!</HI> 'Twas so great I could not in a long time shew myself to interrupt 'em: At length, seeing him undress for Bed, 'Gad, Madam, my Patience was quite ex∣pired; <HI>Traytor,</HI> says I, shewing myself, <HI>Is it thus thou preservest thy feigned Duty to thy Wife?</HI> I laid my Hand upon my Sword, and he did the like on his; and we had certainly drawn, had not the Amorous Fair thrown herself out of Bed between us, and conjured us on her Knees to make no Noise, else she was lost for ever. I raised her naked Beauties, and carried them whence they came, but complained at my hard Fortune, which had made me the Instrument of my own Ruin. She saw I was extreamly touched at it, and after her Shame and Surprize was a little over, <HI>You have no Reason, Sir,</HI> (said she) <HI>to complain of me: I could have no Engagements with a Man who never pretended to love me. Tho' you have given me the Glory of refusing you as a Husband (in the Eyes of the Town) it could not but nettle me, to know there was nothing serious on your Side, but done like a Gentle∣man, to secure my Reputation amongst ill-bred</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="85"/>
<HI>Fools, who know not the Charms of Conver∣sation, and will not permit it (without Cen∣sure) to those that do. But 'Gad, Madam,</HI> (answered I) <HI>your Ladyship is not so dull, but to know I loved you: All my Assiduities, Uneasiness, Sighs, and Ogleings, must have informed you. Our Sex dares hardly believe yours</HI> (she replied) <HI>when you take Pains to speak: And sure it were an unpardonable Va∣nity to draw such Consequences without it. These Circumstances you pretend, I have found common to all Gentlemen: Therefore must I conclude the whole World is in Love with me; and deny myself those who tell me they are my Servants, for the vain Imagina∣tion that another is silently so? 'Gad, Madam,</HI> (answered I) <HI>I cannot possibly forgive the Preference of a dull, silly, sober, married Man, to an airy, well-dressed, young, amorous One. I will be gone to</HI> London <HI>by Break of Day, for fear I should not conceal my Resentments, and so injure your Ladyship irreparably: For 'Gad, Madam, I must repeat again, you were to blame to slight all the Pains I took to breed you for nobler Game.</HI> This last, I con∣fess, broke my splenetic Silence, and I could not hold laughing heartily; which amply paid my Squire for the Pains he had taken in his Relation. He con∣cluded it with telling me his Journey to <HI>London,</HI> and short Stay there, only to ac∣couter;
<PB N="55" REF="86"/>
his Design of visiting a Lady-Si∣ster, married into <HI>Devonshire:</HI> And closed with Lauds to his good Fortune, that had thrown him into a Coach with a Lady of my Charms and Sense, to whom he had sacrificed the Relicks of Lady <HI>Conquest</HI> the first Minute that he saw me. I answered him, That I found Experience had made him resolve against losing a Second Mistress for want of speaking. He had Manners sufficient (or rather Conscience) to think he had given me enough of his <HI>Beau</HI>-self for one Day, and withdrew.</P>
<P>I could not forbear, late as it was, send∣ing you an Account: If you laugh in your Turn, I am paid for my Pains, as well as the Squire. It is now past Eleven, and they will call us by Two: Good Night; I am going to try if I can drown in Sleep that which most sensibly affects me, the cruel Separation we have so lately suffered.</P>

<P>DO not you think I am more constant than your Friendship could hope, or mine pretend to? I think it a great Proof of it, amidst the Fatigues of a West-Country Journey, to give you thus duly an Account of my insignificant self, and Travels. We parted from <HI>Hartley-Row</HI> at Three this Morning, thro' a Croud of Beggars who watch our Coach for Alms; and will never leave it unblessed. Hence my <HI>Beau</HI> took Occasion of <HI>Simile;</HI> bid me to observe how wakeful those Wretches were for small Charities, that he would do the like, in hopes of greater; and that my divine Idea had so filled his Sight, he could not resolve to let Sleep intrude, for fear of shutting me out. I perceived he took Pains to be thought uneasy, and I have more good Manners than to disappoint him. Mrs. <HI>Mayoress,</HI> now she is acquainted, has all the low, disagreeable Familiarity of Peo∣ple of her Rank. She entertained us all the Morning with a sorry Love-business

about her Second Husband; Stuff so im∣pertinent, I remember nothing of it. <HI>Beau</HI> continues in his Assiduities: I think none was ever so plagued with dying Eyes; his are continually in that Posture, and my Opposites, that I am forced to take a good deal of Pains to avoid them. The two other Fellow-Travellers were never so pro∣moted before, and are much troubled their Journey is to last no longer, and wish the four Days four Months. I hope every Jolt will squash their Guts, and give them enough of it: But they are Proof against any such Disasters, and hugely delighted with what they are pleased to call <HI>Riding in State.</HI> After this ridiculous Account, you need not doubt but I am thoroughly mortified.

<P>I Cannot give myself any Reason why these Coach-men are such unrea∣sonable Rogues: They make us rise at Two in the Morning, to bring us into our Inn at the same Hour in the After∣noon. After we were reposed a little, <HI>Beau</HI> shined again (as Yesterday) and waited upon me to Evening-Prayers. I need say nothing to you of <HI>Salisbury</HI> Cathe∣dral: If in a foreign Country, as the LADY in her <HI>Letters</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Countess D'<HI>Annois</HI>'s Travels into <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> I could entertain you with a noble Description; but you have either seen, or may see it; and so I will spare my Architecture. There are abun∣dance of pretty, innocent-looked Women, genteel enough; but I have lost my Heart to a'handsome Churchman. I never thought before that Dress was tolerable; but so wore, it seems a mighty Ornament. He was placed behind me; but I turned my Devotion, and kneeled to him, imagining him no less than (as in Antique Days) some
<PB N="59" REF="90"/>
High Priest of the Sun. The Canon gave me Cause to think he had dined too well, and was obliged to his Snuff, more than Religion, for keeping him awake. Well, Devotion done, I was forced to break up mine, and leave him without a Knowledge of his Conquest. As we were walking to our Inn, I asked <HI>Beau</HI> what we should do to pass the next Day without being very weary of each other, for <HI>Sunday</HI> does not per∣mit Travelling. He (you may be sure) did not fail to tell me, he could never be wea∣ry of me, tho' (himself) expiring by my Sight and Cruelty. I waved his Compli∣ment, and told him my Design of engaging the People in the <HI>Exeter</HI> Coach (if they seemed worth it) to live with us for the Time. When we returned, we were told it was not yet come in, occasioned by the breaking of the Axle-tree five Miles off; but that a Fellow was gone to mend it, and they were expected every Moment. My Chamber-Window answered the Court; I rose to it at the Noise of the Coach, and presently saw alight, a tall, blustering, big∣bon'd, raw Thing, like an over-grown School-Boy, but conceited above any Thing. He had an Appurtenance, called a <HI>Wife,</HI> whom he suffered to get out as well as she could. As long as he had lain by her, he did not think her worth the Civility of his Hand.
<PB N="60" REF="91"/>
She seemed a Giant of a Woman, but ve∣ry fine, with a right Cit's Air. He bluster∣ed presently for the best Lodging, which he saw taken up by her that held the fine Fan before her Face: You may guess this was your humble Servant. The Cham∣berlain told him, it was their Custom, first come, first served; but that there were very good Chambers besides. The rest of the Company were <HI>two</HI> Things that looked pert and aukward; Tradesmens Daughters I judged them. But methoughts, casting my Eyes upon a Gentlewoman and her Servant, that came out last, I found some∣thing pleased me; whether it were because she really deserved it, or that the Stuff she was with set her off. I had a Basin of fine Heart-Cherries before me, just come from the Garden: I caused them to be brought after me into the Gallery, and designed them as a Bait to the Woman whom I was to begin the Acquaintance with; for <HI>Beau</HI> designed to set up to get a Fortune in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and was unwilling to shew any Irregularity; and I thought myself above their Reflec∣tions. The first that appeared was the Wife, with a rising Belly: This seemed a good Hint; I offered them to her, not knowing but she might <HI>long.</HI> The Sight (I suppose) did not displease her, for she readily accep∣ted, and eat very greedily. The Genteel∣looked
<PB N="61" REF="92"/>
Lady had much to do to be persuad∣ed. As for the other <HI>two,</HI> they were gone to chuse a Lodging. We presently grew acquainted, taking Travellers Liberty, and supped together. But, shall I tell you! the Wife grew jealous of me. It seems, her Temper was such; and her Husband (no small Man in his Country, though him∣self just set up in Merchandizing at <HI>London;</HI> his Father, one of the Canons at <HI>Exeter:</HI>) thought he might carry all Hearts before him, as well as the Country-Lasses. They were come from visiting their Friends, and returning to their House in <HI>London.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Stanhope</HI> (for that was the Lady's Name whom I liked) told me, I was not to count upon the Conquest, for he had given her <HI>Douceurs</HI> all the Way, and made her ex∣tream uneasy, because his Wife appeared to be such. We grew into an Intimacy, and left the Company. My <HI>Beau</HI> was to me faithless and inconstant. One of the aukward little Things I told you of, and who had a tolerable Face, was a Goldsmith's Daughter of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and acquainted with his Lady-Sister; that began their Acquain∣tance. She seemed free and fond: He took the Hint, and applied himself to her; which I was very glad of. Mrs. <HI>Stanhope</HI> went with me to my Chamber; and after much Discourse, offered Friendship, and
<PB N="62" REF="93"/>
mutual Knowledge of each other; she gave me this Account of her last Adven∣ture:</P>
<P>I came now from <HI>Falmouth, (says she)</HI> where I have been ever since the Begin∣ning of the Spring, to visit a Brother and his Wife who live there. Until within these six Weeks I saw nothing that pleased me: At last it was a Captain of a Man of War had the Chance; my Brother brought him to his House: And for my Excuse, I must tell you, he is a very pretty, genteel young Gentleman, of a good Family and Education, and in Prospect of coming to very good Fortune. They talked of the Town and Country Beauties: At last, a young Creature was named, whom I had not seen; but the Captain set her before every thing he had. I was concerned at his Opinion, and asked him his of the Duchess of <HI>Grafton?</HI> He gave her due Praise; but yet in his Esteem, this ex∣ceeded. I could not but think him ex∣treamly in the Wrong; and was angry when I heard him wish himself a Man of mighty Fortune, to deserve her. He sailed that Night; and after ten Days Cruise, came in again. His first Visit was to me. I asked him if he had seen his Mistress? He said he had none. I remembred him of what he had spoke. He answered, that I
<PB N="63" REF="94"/>
had taught him better. He continued his Applications, visited me three Times a Day: And because I was still jealous of his Words, I had him watched, and an Account brought of all his Visits. The young La∣dy's Uncle made a Ball; but because my Brother and he were not well together, there was no Hopes of my being invited; which my Lover very well knew, and therefore said, he would not be there, ha∣ving received Orders to sail. He took his Leave with transporting Sorrow; and had the Glory to find mine was real. How∣ever, I would not lose the Ball, because I desired to see my reputed Rival. I for∣got to tell you he had never seen her but once, when he praised her to that Degree; and dexterously told me, a second Sight had undeceived him. I dressed myself like a Farmer's Wife, with a Basket on my Arm; and by the Help of one of the Ser∣vants, was placed like a Country Gazer at the Corner of the Room. I needed not to be told my Rival, a thousand dazzling Charms distinguished her; and tho' I look∣ed with jealous Eyes, must acknowledge I never saw any Beauty more perfect. All my Hopes lay in a certain Softness, which did not promise much Wit. In a little Time my Traytor (whom I imagined in the wide Ocean) came to the Ball, danced
<PB N="64" REF="95"/>
with his Mistress, and was as assiduous as she deserved. I was so well pleased at the Discovery, I stayed not for any more, for fear I should not escape myself. About Midnight he came (for a Minute) to see me, and told me he was just come ashore, the Ship under Sail; yet without another Sight, it was impossible for him to depart. I confounded him with telling him what had so lately passed at the Ball: Yet he drew himself out of the Embarrass, and said every thing to make me think he loved me; and we were seriously treating upon the Affair of Matrimony. I told him he must get my Father's Consent who lived at <HI>London,</HI> where I was going. He begged me to defer my Journey till he came in; which I too readily promised; and so we parted. I knew my Fortune fairer than my Rival's, and began to be persuaded I had the better of her. For, what else could draw him to address me? When I saw him return, it was with mutual Joy: But he was ordered that same Night to sail to <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> and did not expect to be back in a Week; therefore we agreed upon my Jour∣ney. He swore an inviolable Love, and would have contracted himself, if I durst, without my Father's Consent: He intended to write to his Friends above to ask it. And thus we once more parted, but not till he
<PB N="65" REF="96"/>
had severely exclaimed against any Designs upon my Rival, before a whole Crew of Town-Gossips, that I was sure would tell her. You may conclude we agreed upon Writing. I took my Journey, and stay∣ed at an Aunt's House in <HI>Exeter</HI> Ten Days; where I heard that within Four of my Departure, my Lover returned; and in three more was publickly married to my Rival. I wrote to thank him for ridding me of a knavish Husband, wish∣ed him Joy, took Coach, and resolved against too easily believing any Man again.</P>
<P>The Post has just brought me a Letter from you: I find you curse me with the Continuation of <HI>Egham</HI> Uneasiness, till I re∣turn to (the World in) <HI>London.</HI> Methinks it is unreasonable to impose the continued Slavery of Writing: I assure you, I shall take Truce with it till at my Journey's End, unless something happen worth your Notice.

<P>THE Account of so great a Man's Death as General <HI>Talmash</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fine Gentleman died of his Wounds at <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> which he received in the unfortunate Expedition before <HI>Brest.</HI> Anno 1694.</NOTE> (in the middle of all his Enterprizes, when For∣tune seemed to promise him much greener Laurels than he had yet gathered) has so added to my Melancholy, that I will not describe his Misfortune to you, for fear it be contagious; but rather suffer you to ex∣pect the public Account: For I am one of those that esteem you more than to make you uneasy; as I think none can be other∣wise that hears the Particulars of his Loss.

<P>After this doleful Subject, methinks my <HI>Beau</HI> may justly complain I have so long a time neglected his most singular self. We parted this Morning from our <HI>Sunday</HI> Ac∣quaintance.

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BEAU</HI> is now grown so <HI>insipid,</HI> that I shall say very little of him for the future; and I have Reason to believe my∣self <HI>such</HI> to him; for these two last Even∣ings (contrary to Custom) he has not re∣dressed: The Fatigue which he seems more sensible of than any of us, has tarnished the Lustre of his Eyes; and instead of any farther Ogleing, drowns all his amorous Pretensions in as profound Sleep as the un∣easy Jolting of the Coach will permit. This is what I can never be so happy to gain. But to tell you something of our last Night's Entertainment: Whilst Supper was getting ready, the Gentleman I told you of, at <HI>Beau</HI>'s Intreaty, gave us an Account of what Affairs were carrying him to <HI>London:</HI> The short of it is this,</P>
<P>Your Ladyship <HI>(says he)</HI> may soon per∣ceive by my Accent, that I am a Foreigner. I had the Glory of following the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (now our auspicious King) in his
<PB N="69" REF="100"/>
Expedition into <HI>England.</HI> We landed in the West, with all those Particulars, which are needless to repeat. During our Stay at <HI>Exeter,</HI> I rendered my constant Devotion at the Cathedral; and in coming thence one Evening, an old Woman (with a Look as mean as a Beggar) presented me a Letter; which when I had opened, I found from an Unknown, who stiled himself my Friend, and gave me this Advice, that a Lady of good Country-Quality and Fortune (and who was then in <HI>Exeter</HI>) was going to be disposed of by her Mother to a Man she no way affected: But that she had been heard to say, <HI>If the handsome</HI> Switzer <HI>were in his Place, she should obey without Reluctancy.</HI> And concluded the Letter with giving me Advice, like a good Friend, to improve my growing Fortune; for so considerable an one as Twelve Thousand Pounds was not every Day thrown into a Soldier's Lap. I had forgot to tell your Ladyship the Letter was writ in <HI>French,</HI> the Lady's Name, and Directions to her Lodgings. My Heart gave me a secret Presage that the Matter would not be lucky to me, which I follow∣ed, and therefore took no Notice of the Letter. Three Days after, the same old Woman brought me another, much more pressing: Upon which I gave myself blind∣ly up to my Destiny. I visited, and found
<PB N="70" REF="101"/>
the Lady, tho' not a Beauty, yet genteel and taking. It was easy to guess by my Reception, that the Letters came from her. I will omit the Discourse we had, and only rest upon Matter of Fact. She obliged me to leave my Command, and go with her to her Estate. Her Mother looked upon me with an evil Eye, but my Mistress was transport∣ingly kind, and much concerned that none of the Ministers round durst marry us, for fear of the old Lady. Whereupon we con∣cluded I should pretend to take my Leave, as desingning for <HI>London;</HI> but instead of that, go directly into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where she had a considerable Estate, and would meet me. The Matter happened as we agreed; but for fear her Mother should pursue us, she consented to <HI>take me for her Husband,</HI> before the Parson could be got to make us <HI>such.</HI> That happy Night I had all the Reason in the World to believe myself agreeable to her; and all was confirmed in the Morning by the Priest. Thus caressed and blessed, we returned to her House. The old Lady (who had no Command of her Daughter's Fortune, and saw the Business beyond Re∣medy) was one of the first to make her Court to me, and wish me Joy. Three happy Months I had all the Satisfaction that innocent Marriage and excessive Love in a Bride, could give me. Then I began
<PB N="71" REF="102"/>
to consider a little my Affairs, and proposed to my Wife my being naturalized, that I might look after hers. She swooned at the Name; and when she recovered, she snatched a Bayonet of mine, and wounded herself under the Left Breast, but not much. I cannot express my Surprize: We hushed the Matter for fear of her Mother; and I employed some of my Soldiery Skill to cure it, which had the Effect. I enquir∣ed into the Reason of this Extravagancy. She told me the Discovery of <HI>Interest</HI> in me, when she had believed <HI>Love</HI> was the only Motive of our <HI>Marriage.</HI> Some Days pas∣sed, and as often as I offered at it, she re∣ceived such mighty Disgust, that I resolved to get it done without her Notice; for she took me not as a Husband, but a Lover. It was true, I was received as a Guest, but not a Master; and my Circumstance (hav∣ing left my Command) required that. I got her Leave for my Journey: She shew∣ed such extravagant Passion at our Separa∣tion, that I swore a speedy Return; and resolved to leave my Naturalization depend∣ing, look after my other Affairs and return within a Fortnight to her: But before that Time I had a dangerous Fit of Sickness at <HI>London.</HI> I wrote often to her, and gave her an Account that the <HI>Act was passed,</HI> and I could now happily call myself an
<PB N="72" REF="103"/>
<HI>English</HI> Husband. She only answered, She knew how to interpret it; but she was out in her Cunning, if I should find an <HI>English</HI> Wife at my Service, who knew not the true Value and Use of one. This Letter damped me; but trusting to the Greatness of that Power Love had given me in her Heart, I did not question but my Presence would make all Things easy. I took Post, my Impatience would not stay the Coach, tho' the Remains of my Fever seemed to expect it. I gave myself no Rest during the whole Journey. I sent to give her No∣tice of my Arrival: but what was my Sur∣prize, to find all shut at home! I called under her Window where I perceived Light: It was a heavy Night of Rain: I knocked at the Gates, and stormed, but all to no Purpose; I was glad to take up my Lodging in the Porch. At Six in the Mor∣ning an Under-Servant appeared: I asked for her Lady. She told me she was gone none knew whether, and had conveyed away her Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that, if I pleased, an empty House was at my Service. I calmly bore all this, imagining it but a Tryal, sought her round the Country, but in vain; she often shifted Places, and went disguised. Not long after, she commenced a <HI>Process</HI> against me, and by a Pretence (which will for ever make her notorious)
<PB N="73" REF="104"/>
rendered me to the Court as <HI>Incapable.</HI> I was still so tender of her Fame, as to suffer the Aspersion. Common Law separted us: She got the better, by my refusing to vin∣dicate myself; and I Fifteen Hundred Pounds of her Fortune and the Charges of the Court. It is since last <HI>August</HI> that this has happened. I have vainly tried to remove her implacable Aversion, or to learn the Cause of it: But I see my Endeavours are all fruitless; and I am now going to leave <HI>England</HI> (I think) for ever.</P>
<P>I complimented him upon his Misfor∣tunes, and really, in my Opinion, he could not be deserving of them. 'Gad, Madam, (<HI>says</HI> Beau) see what inconstant Things you Ladies are! I happened to be at this Gentleman's House when he was first married, and never saw any thing so fond of him as his Wife. 'Gad, I do not be∣lieve whatever Woman I make happy, tho' her Esteem be equal to my Merit, she can possibly be fonder.</P>
<P>I am now got safely, weary into <HI>Exe∣ter;</HI> and I thank God, rid of the Imper∣tinency of my Fellow-Travellers, <HI>Beau</HI> excepted, who will see me safe home, tho' distant from his.

I would hear how you approve his Stile. I think <HI>Imi∣tation</HI> the hardest Part of Writing: It con∣fines a free-born Genius, which naturally loves untrod Wilds; at least, if I may guess at another's by my own. And now I am speaking of that, let me tell you all those romantic Ideas of <HI>Retirement,</HI> which view∣ed at a Distance, give a ravishing Prospect, now I am wedded, and bedded to, prove the worst sort of <HI>Matrimony;</HI> but it is only to such a particular Friend as yourself, that I dare complain; to the remoter Sort I assume a Stoical Appetite and Air—Tell them, <HI>The World, with all its gaudy Pleasures, are but rich Delusions, which at once corrupt</HI>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A NUN in <HI>Portugal,</HI> TO A GENTLEMAN in <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OH my <HI>fled Heart!</HI> and he that so un∣justly keeps it from me! Was not your barbarous Resolution sufficient that I should never possess <HI>Yours;</HI> but you must add the Use of all your best Art to keep me from my <HI>Own?</HI> In what Disorder do I speak and write, for want of <HI>a poor tender Heart!</HI> That is gone a Pilgrimage to Love, and (the unkind Heavens not hearing its Prayer) has thro' Distraction lost its Way, and never will return again? Fire fets on
<PB N="80" REF="111"/>
Fire: Why then does not my Flame make you burn? It is a false Maxim: <HI>Extremity of Cold scorches.</HI> Had I at first put on a Behaviour more cool and remote to your pretended Affection, and treated you with Unkindness, how many Bows and Vows would you have offered at <HI>Love's-Altar?</HI> With what Ardency would you have con∣tinued your Protestations? Who would have thought that a Fire (at first) so well kindled as yours, should need Fanning with an infectious Blast to preserve its Heat? Or that the wholsome Sun should put it out? But that alas! was my Mis∣fortune: My Burning was the greater, and drew yours away.—How can I then with any Confidence blame you, for what I myself was truly and principally the Oc∣casion of? You too easily perceived how earnestly I was wont to watch your Eyes, that they looked not on others; as if mine took it unkindly they were not gazed on altogether. How perverse are our Fates! Why else was it not contrived that you might be as happy in me, as it was possible for me to be in you? Say what you will, you was to blame. What Care you took to assault my Affections, was sufficiently discoverable in the constant Ardour and Formality of your Approaches; contriving to appear at all Times as engaging as pos∣sible.
<PB N="81" REF="112"/>
Your Conquest was not so great: You could not well have met with a Heart less fortified for a Defence: Ye Gods! that I should yield upon your very <HI>first Sum∣mons;</HI> and so dishonourably, that I was not allowed <HI>Flying Colours!</HI> Nay, what is yet more, that I should bear so mean, so low, and so contemptible a Spirit, as to take in∣finitely more Delight in my own Captivity and Vassallage, than in the most flourish∣ing Tranquillity! What do I thus rave up∣on? What would I have? If I am happy in my Condition, why do I not rest and retain my Senses like others of my Sex? But that still (and I fear ever) I have the same sad Tune to sing;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>My Conqueror (whom I adored for being so) is gone; and my Cloyster is now as much a Prison to me, as it was Heaven, and Liber∣ty, and all Things, when I had him there. It was an unworthy Thing to steal my better Part, my Soul, away, and not think this little Frame, its old Companion, worth taking with you. But what you had got, you thought was of light Carriage, needed little Stowage, paid no Freight, and (I dare stake my Life) was the All you ever intended to have of me: And to be so served, is (it seems) the All I am ever likely to expect from you. How grosly did I flatter myself, and abuse you,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="113"/>
<HI>whenever I imagined you would be kind and true to me! You that are so cruel, that could you reduce any other Woman into my ill Cir∣cumstances, if there was a Third in the World, you would certainly leave the former, and there feign fresh Adorations. If there was not, yet purely to gratify your Inhumanity to her, even I, now slighted and neglected, should then have your Company; for you could not brook being put by a Pleasure of that Kind, though it cost you the Trouble of going to one who loved you more than the World.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How very odd (and as tho' you were writing to some public Place of Intelligence) was that <HI>Discourse</HI> of yours in your last Letter! <HI>concerning the great Lightning and Thunder which you say happened in your Parts!</HI> Also, <HI>you desire to know what Wea∣ther we have had here.</HI> Are these proper Enquiries for a Love-Letter? Truly it might have <HI>Thundered, Lightened,</HI> and <HI>Rained,</HI> or it might have been very <HI>plea∣sant delightful Weather</HI> for aught I know; for I am not capable of making any Re∣marks of that kind: But this I can inform you, being too sure of the Truth of it, that it has been very <HI>stormy Weather</HI> in my <HI>Eyes</HI> ever since your Departure; and until you return (the only <HI>Sun,</HI> whose Influence
<PB N="83" REF="114"/>
can disperse these <HI>Clouds</HI>) I fear it will ever be <HI>Tempestuous.</HI> This Account (it may be) pleases you more than if I had sent you Word the ill <HI>Weather</HI> had reached our Country, demolished our Monastery, set me at Liberty, and I was in Pursuit of you. Then, then, how I would glut my Revenge by the Incursions of my Love! For it should hunt you in all Places and all Countries. And since it wore so much the Visage of an evil Spirit in your Con∣ceit here, as to make you quit the Spot, I would try whether Change of Air would alter its Complection and Features, so as to force you into a better Opinion of it, and be thoroughly revenged on you that Way: For <HI>to love,</HI> I find is the Unhappiness you would avoid above all other things: But your Appetite and Taste is as much depraved as my Project is vain and imprac∣ticable: I find the Sour of <HI>France</HI> gratifies your Palate above the Sweets of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> LADY (with her distant Re∣gards to your Address, and, at last, coun∣terfeit artificial Acceptance) shall engage you much more than the Loyalty, Integri∣ty, Truth and Freedom of my unlimited Passion. Will not the World swear we are both mad? You for preferring a Counter∣feit, (because it glisters, before the true Metal itself, which is known to every
<PB N="84" REF="115"/>
Child by its Weight:) I for my Fidelity to so much Ingratitude. But let the World blame us as it pleases, I am resolved to be as true to you, as you to your natural In∣constancy. To what a Degree of Bliss should I be advanced, if I could find you complaining of the Remissness of my Love, and admiring the Intenseness of your own: Then I should be but too happy if that Fault was not found on your Side, as alas! to all the World too visibly it is: And the same Conceptions you make of an Immen∣sity, will but just serve you to fathom my Zeal, which (although cherished and pru∣ned after the most careful Manner) is pro∣ductive of nothing but the most bitter, sour, and unpleasant Fruits imaginable.—Your unkind Dealings and Actions to me, are the Fruits of my extraordinary Passion. What Soul could imagine such dissonant Notes should strike, to interrupt the Har∣mony of my Affection? In what had you been the worse, had you retaliated my ex∣tream Kindness with but a little of yours; and although more than a little be my Due, yet with the least Grain I could have wrought my own Contentment: But you are so unjust to deny all, and leave me to a racking and a miserable Despair; one Hour's Torment of which, I would not wish you should endure Ages to come, to
<PB N="85" REF="116"/>
be set free myself; and yet no otherwise fond of my Condition, but as it is a Gift of yours, and which (for any Thing less than your Love) I will never part with. O! barbarous, barbarous Man! to deny me that which you take more Pains to throw away upon another, than I can do to ob∣tain it. You shall not use me thus; indeed you must not: It is I say it, but you re∣gard not that, so insensible are you of my Condition; which though never so unfor∣tunate as to my own particular, yet is ag∣gravated with Cares for your Welfare, who are the sole Cause of my Unhappiness. How you will relish this <HI>Letter</HI> I know not; I fear you will think there are too many Invectives against your Tyranny; in which I will agree with you myself, and ask your Forgiveness: But alas! they are as gentle as I could possibly persuade my Pen to drop; for since you take so much Pleasure in a hard Heart, I would not for the World any ways cross you, by making you less ob∣durate; so tenderly I value your Satisfac∣tion, and so little (for your sake) my own. But oh! the infinite Pleasures you would find in <HI>Love,</HI> if you thought them worth the looking after! <HI>Love</HI> (as it is, or is not mutual) is the truest Epitome of the super∣natural States: If mutual, the Joys are la∣sting, and never cloy; if not, the Tor∣ments
<PB N="86" REF="117"/>
are intolerable, yet must be endur∣ed. Oh! that any thing I could say might dissolve you to a Sense of my miserable Life; or, indeed rather your own! And yet if it could in the least enter into my Thoughts, that you are altogether at Repose, I assure you, I would never interrupt you; no Noise of my Afflictions should ever be your Distur∣bance: But I am very much mistaken, if you are altogether without Remorse for the Sufferings you have brought upon me. I remember you once was flexible, and of a compassionate Nature, and your Behaviour very like a Gentleman; whatever has mis∣guided you to the Abuse of my Favours, which (if I have Knowledge of my Heart) were at first, much more for your sake than my own, you were the Aggressor, and not I; and whatever Kindness I shewed you, was more to make me happy, than your∣self; that by Charity to a Serpent, I at last was stung. It is said that venomous Crea∣tures have a balsamick Quality in them∣selves, to cure the Wounds they make: But you (more unnatural than all the rest) have none; at least, most cruelly you with∣hold it from me. Oh Heaven! that I had but Power to contain myself! that I had but Temper to be a little calm! But it is a Condition I have long since abandoned, and (till I see you again) will never re-as∣sume.
<PB N="87" REF="118"/>
In the Rage I am in, I could think in you as many Unkindnesses, as by and by the Fury of Love would find a Task to un∣ravel; for if one Half Hour I blame you, in the next I call it Injustice. So careful am I, that no ill Thought of you appear deserving, that were you worse than you are, my Pleasure would consist in being flattered that you are better than I think you: Nay, sometimes I persuade myself that you are a Man of the greatest Justice in the World; and that it is not even in your Nature (wilfully) to do an unequal Thing. But it is most certain, I am doom∣ed to a fruitless Love, without the least Possibility of a Deliverance. Indeed, for∣merly I had a faint Prospect (as I thought) of being in some measure restored; but I looked through false Opticks, that present∣ed me with a wrong Object; and since that, I have done the great Work, of lear∣ning to be well satisfied with my intolera∣ble Condition. Did my Love run parallel with what is commonly found in the World, it would not be so desperate.—Happy they, who (in a Pet, or upon some small Disgust) can recede from their Pas∣sions, and set up for new Ones elsewhere; and whatever they pretend, Self-Interest is the greatest Thing. This is the Way of Amouring most in Fashion: This is that
<PB N="88" REF="119"/>
Imposture which prevails upon so many tender Hearts: And in Cases of Denial, very artificially can usurp languishing Eyes, want no expressive Insinuations, counter∣feit Melancholy and Distraction; and all to serve some base Bye-End. If this had been the Quality of my Love, the Ven∣geance you assign me had then been me∣rited. I verily believe, if it had had but the least Tincture of Treachery, I should have won your Heart, should have made you jealous: And that Temper would have been very inconsistent with your Resolu∣tions to make a thorough Conquest: No∣thing less than which (to a Man of Prowess like you) could have been a real Pleasure. Yes, yes; it is very plain, if my Passion had been forged, and bore a false Accent, it would certainly much better have agreed with yours, as being much nearer related; but the fatal Consequence (of a true Fer∣vency, returned with fair Assurances, and foul Actions) none knows but the wretch∣ed, solitary I. Upon the whole, I think verily I love you, because you make me miserable. If that be true, go on, be sig∣nalized to the World for your Unkindness, that the more I may be so, for my unac∣countable Affection. That I love you, Heaven knows; you know else I should see you here again, cringing out the feigned
<PB N="89" REF="120"/>
Allegations of your Sincerity, though much more distant than we are. O, that we were to begin again! What Course would I then take! I fear, even fool myself, as I have done; for since I know no greater Pleasure than the Love of you, I should too willingly run the Risque of any Disad∣vantage that could happen by it. I die a thousand Deaths every Hour, and still re∣vive, to die them over again: Adieu. What could I not endure for your sake? I have at this Moment so lively an <HI>Idea</HI> of you, that I almost fancy you here in Person. Methinks, how very kind you are! How affectionately you condole me for the Tor∣ments I have suffered in your Absence; and how thankful I am to you for them! How you press my Hand, and swear you will never part with me! And Ah, <HI>Monsieur!</HI> How I believe you, for being hitherto so faithful!—Once more Adieu. I think I never writ Letters to you in my Life, but their Length made them stayed for. The Post (at my Request) has waited a great while, and I am now sent to; I wonder else, when I should give over. You may judge a little of my Condition, when you see even hurrying-Post-haste itself can ad∣mit of a Delay to please me. The Actions of all People that see me, are designedly kind, and of a Desire to divert me. One takes
<PB N="90" REF="121"/>
me by the Hand, begging of me to be chearful, and leave my unprofitable Think∣ing; shewing me good Reason for it: But, alas! I find <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> two very se∣parate Things, not at all influencing each other. To-day a <HI>Sister</HI> brought me Varie∣ty of the best Fruits; of which, nothing but a Piece of a <HI>Pomgranate,</HI> could I be per∣suaded to eat. I might thank her, but I am not sure I had so much Manners: Eve∣ry body excuses my ill Breeding, but much wonder at my Alteration. The Rigour and Severity of our Religion can dispense with many great Faults in me, that it will not allow in others. What shall I do? Well, I have only one Thing more (be∣sides a Thousand) to say to you; which is, That if you can have Regard for any <HI>one</HI> Sentence in this long Letter; it may be to <HI>this</HI> last, <HI>I implore you to let me see you in</HI> Por∣tugal <HI>before I die.</HI> Adieu, Adieu.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Mar near Doncaster, <DATE>Oct. 6. 1688.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OUR having no Prospect of ob∣taining a Commission for me, can no way alter or cool my Desire at this important Junc∣ture, to venture my Life in some Manner or other, for my King and my Country.</P>
<P>I cannot bear living under the Reproach of lying obscure and idle in a Country Re∣tirement,
<PB N="92" REF="124"/>
when every Man, who has the least Sense of Honour, should be preparing for the Field.</P>
<P>You may remember, Sir, with what Reluctance I submitted to your Commands upon <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Rebellion, when no Im∣portunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the Academy; I was too young to be hazarded; but give me Leave to say, it is glorious at any Age to die for one's Country, and the sooner, the nobler the Sacrifice.</P>
<P>I am now older by three Years; my Uncle <HI>Bathe</HI> was not so old, when he was left among the Slain at the Battle of <HI>Newbury:</HI> Nor you yourself, Sir, when you make your Escape from your Tu∣tors, to join your Brother at the Defence of <HI>Scilly.</HI></P>
<P>The same Cause is now come round about again: The King has been mis-led; let those who have mis-led him be answer∣able for it: Nobody can deny, but he is Sacred in his own Person, and it is every honest Man's Duty to defend it.</P>
<P>You are pleas'd to say, it is yet doubt∣ful, if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are rash enough to make such an Attempt: But be that as it will, I beg Leave to insist upon it, that I may be presented to his Majesty, as one, whose utmost Ambition it is to de∣vote
<PB N="93" REF="125"/>
his Life to his Service, and my Coun∣try's, after the Example of all my An∣cestors.</P>
<P>The Gentry assembled at <HI>York,</HI> to agree upon the Choice of Representatives for the County, have prepared an Address, to as∣sure his Majesty, they are ready to sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for him, upon this, and all other Occasions; but at the same Time, they humbly beseech him to give them such Magistrates, as may be agreeable to the Laws of the Land; for at present, there is no Authority to which they can legally submit.</P>
<P>They have been beating for Volunteers at <HI>York,</HI> and the Towns adjacent, to sup∣ply the Regiments at <HI>Hull,</HI> but nobody will list.</P>
<P>By what I can hear, every body wishes well to the King, but they would be glad, his Ministers were hang'd.</P>
<P>The Winds continue so contrary, that no Landing can be so soon as was ap∣prehended; therefore, I may hope, with your Leave and Assistance, to be in Rea∣diness before any Action can begin.</P>
<P>I beseech you, Sir, most humbly and most earnestly, to add this one Act of In∣dulgence more to so many other Testi∣monies, which I have constantly received
<PB N="94" REF="126"/>
of your Goodness; and be pleas'd to be∣lieve me always, with the utmost Duty and Submission, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>TO WILLIAM-HENRY, Earl of <HI>Bathe,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>At the Camp in Flanders, <DATE>Sept. 4. 1711.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Dear Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILST you are pursuing Ho∣nour in the Field, in the earliest Time of your Life, after the Example of your Ancestors, I am commanded by the Queen, to let you know, she has declared you her Lord-Lieutenant of the County of <HI>Cornwall;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> to act for you till you are of Age.</P>
<P>You will do well to write your most humble Thanks to her Majesty, for so gra∣ciously remembring you, unsollicited, in your Absence: You should likewise do the same to my Lord <HI>Rochester,</HI> for accepting the Trouble.</P>
<P>This, my dear Lord, is a Preparative to bring you upon the Stage with some Lustre at your first Appearance in the World. You
<PB N="96" REF="128"/>
are placed at the Head of a Body of Gen∣try, entirely dispos'd in Affection to you, and your Family: You are born possess'd of all those amiable Qualities, which cannot fail of fixing their Hearts: You have no other Example to follow, but to tread in the Steps of your Ancestors: It is all that is hoped or desired from you.</P>
<P>You are upon an uncommon Foundation in that Part of the World: Your Ancestors, for at least five hundred Years, never made any Al∣liance, Male or Female, out of the <HI>Western</HI> Counties: Thus there is hardly a Gentle∣man, either in <HI>Cornwall</HI> or <HI>Devon,</HI> but has some of your Blood, or you some of theirs. I remember, the first Time I accompany'd your Grandfather into the <HI>West,</HI> upon hold∣ing his Parliament of <HI>Tinners,</HI> as Warden of the <HI>Stannaries,</HI> when there was the most numerous Appearance of Gentry of both Counties, that had ever been re∣member'd together; I observ'd there was hardly any one but whom he call'd <HI>Cousin;</HI> and I could not but observe, at the same Time, how well they were pleased with it. Let this be a Lesson for you, when it comes to your Turn to appear amongst them. Nothing is more obliging, than to seem to retain the Memory of Kindred and Allian∣ces, tho' never so remote: And by Conse∣quence, nothing more disobliging, than a
<PB N="97" REF="129"/>
Forgetfulness of them; which is always imputed to an affected, disdainful Superio∣rity and Pride.</P>
<P>There is another Particular, in my Opi∣nion, of no small Consequence to the Sup∣port of your Interest, which I would re∣commend to your Imitation; and that is, to make <HI>Stowe</HI> your principal Residence. I have heard your Grandfather say, if ever he liv'd to be possess'd of <HI>New-Hall,</HI> he would pull it down, that your Father might have no Temptation to withdraw from the ancient Seat of his Family. From the <HI>Conquest</HI> to the <HI>Restauration,</HI> your An∣cestors constantly resided amongst their Countrymen, except when the public Ser∣vice call'd upon them to sacrifice their Lives for it.</P>
<P><HI>Stowe</HI> in my Grandfather's Time, till the Civil Wars broke out, was a Kind of Academy for all the young Men of Family in the Country: He provided himself with the best Masters of all Kinds for Educa∣tion; and the Children of his Neighbours and Friends shared the Advantage with his own. Thus he, in a Manner, became the Father of his Country; and not only en∣gaged the Affection of the present Genera∣tion, but laid a Foundation of Friendship for Posterity, which is not worn out at this Day.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="130"/>
Upon this Foundation, my Lord, you in∣herit Friends without the Trouble of make∣ing them, and have only to preserve them: an easy Task for you, to whom Nature has been so liberal of every Quality ne∣cessary to attract Affection, and gain the Heart!</P>
<P>I must tell you, the Generality of our Countrymen have been always <HI>Royalists;</HI> you inherit too much Loyal Blood to like them the worse. There is an old Saying amongst them, That a <HI>Godolphin</HI> was never known to want Wit; a <HI>Trelawney,</HI> Courage; or a <HI>Granville,</HI> Loyalty. Wit and Courage are not to be mistaken; and to give those Fa∣milies their Due, they still keep up to their Character: But it is the Misfortune of Loyalty, not to be so clearly understood or defined. In a Country, subject to Revolu∣tions, what passes for Loyalty To-day, may be Treason To-morrow; but I make great Difference between Real and Nomi∣nal Treason. In the Quarrel of the Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> both Sides were pro∣claimed Traitors, as the other prevailed: Even under <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Usurpation, all who adhered to the King were proclaimed Traitors, and suffered as such; but this makes no Alteration in the Thing itself: It may be enacted Treason to call black, black; or white, white: But black will
<PB N="99" REF="131"/>
be black, and white will be white, in Spite of all the Legislators in the World.</P>
<P>There can be no Doubt about Allegi∣ance, unless Princes become Tyrants, and then they cease to be Kings: They will no longer be respected as God's Vicegerents, who violate the Laws they were sworn to protect. The Preacher may tell us of pas∣sive Obedience; that Tyrants are to be pa∣tiently suffer'd, as Scourges in the Hands of a righteous God, to chastise a sinful Na∣tion; and to be submitted to, like Plagues, Famines, and such like Judgments from above. Such Doctrine, were it true, could only serve to mislead ill-judging Princes in∣to a false Security; Men are not to be rea∣son'd out of their Senses: Human Nature, and Self-Preservation, will eternally arm against Slavery and Oppression.</P>
<P>It is therefore not to be supposed, that even the weakest Prince would run that Hazard, unless seduced by Advice, wicked∣ly palliated by evil Counsellors. <HI>Nero</HI> himself, under the Influence of a good Mi∣nistry, was the mildest, the most gracious, and best beloved of the Emperors: The most sanguinary, the most profligate, and the most abhorr'd under a bad one. A Prince may be deceiv'd, or mistaken in the Choice of his Favourites; but he has this
<PB N="100" REF="132"/>
Advantage, he is sure to hear of it from the Voice of the Public: if then he is deaf, he seems to take upon himself the Blame and Odium of those Actions which were chargeable before but upon his Advisers.</P>
<P>Idle Murmurs, groundless Discontents, and pretended Jealousies and Fears, the Ef∣fect of private Prejudice and Resentments, have been, and will ever be, under the wisest Administrations: We are pester'd with them even now, when we have a <HI>Queen,</HI> who is known to have nothing so much at Heart, as the Contentment of her People: These are transitory Vapours, which scatter at the first Appearance of Light: The Infection spreads no farther than a particular Set of four, splenetic <HI>Enthusiasts</HI> in Politics, not worth minding or correcting. Universal Discontent can never happen but from solid Provocations.</P>
<P>Many well-meaning Persons however, abounding in Zeal, have been often unwa∣rily caught by popular Pretences, and not undeceived, till it was too late. Have a Care, my dear Cousin, of splitting upon that Rock: There have been <HI>false Patriots,</HI> as well as <HI>false Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>Fear God, and Honour the King,</HI> were Injunctions so closely tack'd together, that they seem to make but one and the same Command: A Man may as well pretend
<PB N="101" REF="133"/>
to be a good Christian, without fearing God, as a good Subject without honouring the King.</P>
<P><HI>Deo, Patrice, Amicis,</HI> was your Great-Grandfather Sir <HI>Bevil</HI>'s Motto: In three Words he has added to his Example a Rule, which in following you can never err in any Duty of Life. The brightest Carriage, and the gentlest Disposition, is Part of the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Character of him; so much of him you may have begun to shew us already; and the best Wish I can make for you, is to resemble him as much in all—but his untimely Fate.</P>

<HEAD>TO WILLIAM-HENRY, Earl of <HI>Bathe.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>At the Camp in Flanders 1711.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EVery living Creature, my dear Lord, is entitled to Offices of Humanity: The Distress, even of an Enemy, should reconcile us to him: If he thirsts, give him Drink; if he hungers, give him Food; overcome Evil with Good. It is with this Disposition I would have you enter into the Exercise of that Authority, [<HI>Lord-Lieute∣nant of</HI> Cornwall] with which her Majesty has honoured you over your Countrymen. Let no body inspire you with Party-Preju∣dices and Resentments. Let it be your Business to reconcile Differences, and heal Divisions; and to restore, if possible, Har∣mony and good Neighbourhood amongst them: If then there should be any left to wish you ill, make them asham'd and confounded with your Goodness and Mo∣deration:
<PB N="103" REF="135"/>
Not that I would ever advise you to sacrifice one Hair of the Head of an old Friend to your Family, to gain fifty new ones; but if you can encrease the Number by Curtesy and Moderation, it may be worth the Trial.</P>
<P>Believe me, my dear Lord, Humanity and Generosity make the best Foundation to build a Character upon: A Man may have Birth, and Riches, and Power, Wit, Learning, Courage; but without Genero∣sity it is impossible to be a great Man: Whatever the Rich and Powerful may think of themselves, whatever Value they may set upon their Abundance and Gran∣deur, they will find themselves but the more hated and despis'd for the ill Use they make of it.</P>
<P>You should look upon yourselves but as Stewards and Trustees for the Distressed: Your Over-abundance is but a Deposit for the Use and Relief of the Unhappy; you are answerable for all Superfluities mispent: It is not to be supposed that Providence would have made such Distinctions among Men, such unequal Distributions, but that they might endear themselves to one ano∣ther by mutual Helps and Obligations. <HI>Gra∣titude</HI> is the surest Cement of Love, Friend∣ship, and Society.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="136"/>
There are, indeed, Rules to be observ'd, and Measures to be kept, in the Distribu∣tion of Favours. We know who have both the Power and Inclination to do Good, but for Want of Judgment in the Direction, they pass only for good-natur'd Fools in∣stead of generous Benefactors.</P>
<P>My Lord—will grudge a Guinea to an honest Gentleman in Distress, but rea∣dily give twenty to a common Strumper. Another shall resuse to lend fifty Pounds to his best Friend without sufficient Security, and the next Moment set his whole Fortune upon a Card or a Die; a Chance, for which he can have no Security. My Lord—is to be seen every Day at a Toy-Shop, squandring away his Money in Trinkets and Baubles; and at the same Time leaves his Brothers and Sisters without common Necessaries.</P>
<P>Generosity does not consist in a Con∣tempt of Money, in throwing it away at Random, without Judgment or Distinction; tho' that indeed is better than locking it up, for Multitudes have the Benefit of it; but in a right Disposition to proper Objects, in Proportion to the Merit, the Circumstan∣ces, the Rank, and Condition of those, who stand in Need of our Service.</P>
<P>Princes are more exposed than any others to the misplacing their Favours: Merit is
<PB N="105" REF="137"/>
ever modest, and keeps its Distance: The Forward and Importunate stand always nearest in Sight, and are not to be put out of Countenance, nor thrust out of the Way.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard a Saying of the late King <HI>James, That be never knew a mo∣dest Man make his Way in a Court. David Floyd,</HI> whom you know, being then in wait∣ing at his Majesty's Elbow, reply'd blunt∣ly, <HI>Pray, Sir, whose Fault's that?</HI> The King stood corrected, and was silent. If Princes could see with their own Eyes, and hear with their own Ears, what a happy Situation it would be both for themselves and their Subjects? To reward Merit, to re∣dress the Injured, to relieve the Oppressed, to raise the Modest, to humble the Insolent; what a God-like Prerogative, were a right Use made of it!</P>
<P>How happy are you, my dear Lord, who are born with such generous Inclinations, with Judgment to direct them, and the Means to indulge them! Of all Men most miserable is he, who has the Inclination, without the Means. To meet with a de∣serving Object of Compassion, without hav∣ing the Power to give Relief, of all the Cir∣cumstances in Life is the most disagreeable: To have the Power is the greatest Plea∣sure.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="138"/>
Methinks I see you ready to cry out, <HI>Good Cousin, why this Discourse to me? What Oc∣casion have I for these Lectures?</HI> None at all, my dear Lord; I am only making my Court to you, by letting you see, I think as you do.</P>
<P>But one Word more, and I have done.</P>
<P>In Trust, Intimacy, and Confidence, be as particular as you please: In Humanity, Charity, and Benevolence, universal.</P>

<HEAD>To my Nephew, Mr. BEVIL GRANVILLE, Upon his entring into Holy Orders.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I look upon the Date of your last Letter, I must own myself blameable for not having sooner return'd you my Thanks for it.</P>
<P>I approve very well of your Resolution of dedicating yourself to the Service of God; you could not chuse a better Master, pro∣vided you have so sufficiently search'd your Heart as to be persuaded you can serve him well: In so doing you may secure to your∣self many Blessings in this World, as well as a sure Expectation in the next. There is one thing which I perceive you have not thoroughly purg'd yourself from, which is Flattery: You have bestow'd so much of that upon me in your Letter, that I hope you have no more left, and that you meant it only to take your Leave of such Flights of Fancy, which, however well meant, oftener put a Man out of Countenance than oblige him.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="140"/>
You are now become a Searcher after Truth: I shall hereafter take it more kind∣ly to be justly reprov'd by you, than to be undeservedly complimented.</P>
<P>I would not have you understand me, as if I recommended to you a sour Presbyte∣rian Severity; that is yet more to be avoid∣ed. Advice, like Physick, should be so sweeten'd and prepar'd, as to be made pala∣table, or Nature may be apt to revolt against it. Be always sincere, but at the same Time always polite: Be humble without descending from your Character; reprove and correct without offending good Manners: To be a Cynick is as bad as to be a Sycophant: You are not to lay aside the Gentleman with your Sword, nor to put on the Gown to hide your Birth and good Breeding, but to adorn it. Such has been the Malice of the World, from the Beginning, that Pride, Avarice, and Am∣bition, have been charg'd upon the Priest∣hood in all Ages, in all Countries, and in all Religions. What they are most oblig'd to combat against in their Pulpits, they are most accus'd of encouraging in their Con∣duct. It behoves you therefore to be more upon your Guard in this, than in any other Profession: Let your Example confirm your Doctrine; and let no Man ever have it in
<PB N="109" REF="141"/>
his Power to reproach you with practising contrary to what you preach.</P>
<P>You had an Uncle, Dr. <HI>Dennis Granville,</HI> Dean of <HI>Durham,</HI> whose Memory I shall ever revere; make him your Example: Sanctity sate so easy, so unaffected, and so graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very Beauty of Holiness: He was as chearful, as familiar, and condescending in his Conversation, as he was strict, regular and exemplary in his Piety: As well bred and accomplish'd as a Courtier, as reverend and venerable as an Apostle: He was indeed in every Thing apostolical, for he abandon'd all to follow his Lord and Master.</P>
<P>May you resemble him; may he revive in you; may his Spirit descend upon you, as <HI>Elijah</HI>'s upon <HI>Elisha;</HI> and may the great God of Heaven, in guiding, directing, and strengthening your pious Resolutions, pour down his best and choicest Blessings upon you.</P>
<P>You shall ever find me, dear Nephew, your most affectionate Uncle, and sincere Friend, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Perusal of this DIA∣LOGUE, in DEFENCE of the FAIR SEX, written by a GENTLEMAN of my Ac∣quaintance, much surprized me: For it was not easy for me to ima∣gine, that one so young, could have treated so nice a Subject with so much Judgment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious, and that he had improved himself by Travelling; and from thence I might reasonably have ex∣pected
<PB N="116" REF="146"/>
that Air of Gallantry, which is so visibly diffused thro' the Body of the Work, and is indeed the Soul that animates all Things of this Na∣ture: But so much Variety of Read∣ing, both in ancient and modern Authors, such Digestion of that Read∣ing, so much Justness of Thought, that it leaves no Room for Affecta∣tion, or Pedantry, I may venture to say, are not overcommon amongst practised Writers, and very rarely to be found amongst Beginners. It puts me in Mind of what was said of Mr. <HI>Waller,</HI> the Father of our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Numbers, upon the Sight of his first Verses, by the Wits of the last Age, that <HI>he came out into the World Forty Thousand strong, before they had heard of him.</HI> Here, in Imita∣tion of my Friend's Apostrophes, I hope the Reader need not be told, that Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> is only mentioned for Honour's sake, that I am desirous
<PB N="117" REF="147"/>
of laying hold on his Memory, on all Occasions, and thereby acknow∣ledging to the World, that unless he <HI>had</HI> written, none of us <HI>could</HI> write. I know my Friend will forgive me this Digression; for it is not only a Copy of his Stile, but of his Can∣dour. The Reader will observe, that he is ready for all Hints of com∣mending Merit, and the Writers of this Age and Country are particular∣ly obliged to him, for his pointing out those Passages which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Beaux Endroits,</HI> wherein they have most excelled. And tho' I may seem in this, to have my own Interest in View, because he has more than once mentioned me, so much to my Advantage, yet I hope the Reader will take it only for a <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> because the Piece would have been very perfect without it. I may be suffered to please myself with the Kindness of my Friend,
<PB N="118" REF="148"/>
without valuing myself upon his Partiality: He had not Confidence enough to send it out into the World, without my Opinion of it, that it might pass securely, at least amongst the fair Readers, for whose Service it was principally designed. I am not so presuming, to think my Opi∣nion can either be his Touchstone, or his Passport: But I thought I might send him back to <HI>Ariosto;</HI> who has made it the Business of al∣most Thirty <HI>Stanzas</HI> in the Begin∣ning of the 37th Book of his <HI>Orlan∣do Furioso,</HI> not only to praise that beautiful part of the Creation, but also to make a sharp Satire on their Enemies; to give Mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their Envy it proceeds that the Vir∣tue and great Actions of Women are purposely concealed, and the Fail∣ings of some few amongst them ex∣posed with all the aggravating Cir∣cumstances
<PB N="119" REF="149"/>
of Malice. For my own Part, who have always been their Servant, and have never drawn my Pen against them, I had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily, than any of them suffer by Detrac∣tion: And that in this Age, and at this Time particularly, wherein I find more <HI>Heroines</HI> than <HI>Heroes.</HI> Let me therefore give them Joy of their new Champion: If any will think me more partial to him than really I am, they can only say I have returned his Bribe: And the worst I wish him, is, that he may receive <HI>Justice</HI> from the <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> only from the <HI>Ladies.</HI></P>

Edit. ult.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>William Walsh,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Son of <HI>Joseph Walsh</HI> of <HI>Abberley</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire.</HI> He became a Gentleman-Commoner of <HI>Wadham-Col∣lege, Oxford,</HI> in <HI>Easter-Term,</HI> 1678, aged 15 Years; left it without a Degree; retired to his native Country, and some∣times to <HI>London.</HI>"<P>"He wrote <HI>A</HI> DIALOGUE <HI>concerning</HI> WOMEN; <HI>Being a Defence of the</HI> FAIR SEX, and <HI>addressed</HI> it to EUGENIA, 1691."</P><P>"He also wrote another small Piece, intitled, <HI>Letters and Poems, Amorous and Gallant,</HI> 1692."</P></Q></P>

Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> will have it, that the LADY characterized by Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> under the Name of EUGENIA, was his Mistress. For this he could not have any other ground than his own malevolent Conjecture. But that our Author was a Gentleman very susceptable of the <HI>soft Passion,</HI> appears plainly from his own Pen; sending forth his <HI>Love-Letters</HI> and <HI>Poems</HI> with the following <HI>Address</HI> to the Public:<Q><L>Go, little Book, and to the World impart</L>
<L>The faithful Image of an Am'rous Heart;</L>
<L>Those who Love's dear, deluding Pains have known,</L>
<L>May, in my fatal Stories, read their own.</L>
<L>Those who have liv'd from all its Torments free,</L>
<L>May find the Thing they never felt, by Me.</L>
<L>Perhaps, advis'd, avoid the gilded Bait,</L>
<L>And, warn'd by my Example, shun my Fate.</L>
<L>While with calm Joy, safe landed on the Coast,</L>
<L>I view the Waves on which I once was tost.</L>
<L>Love is a Medley of Endearments, Jars,</L>
<L>Suspicions, Quarrels, Reconcilements, Wars;</L>
<L>Then Peace again. O! wou'd it not be best,</L>
<L>To chace the fatal Poison from our Breast?</L>
<L>But since so few can live from Passion free,</L>
<L>Happy the Man, and only happy he,</L>
<L>Who with such lucky Stars begins his Love,</L>
<L>That his cool Judgment does his Choice approve.</L>
<L>Ill grounded Passions quickly wear away;</L>
<L>What's built upon Esteem, can ne'er decay.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="152"/>
As for <HI>three</HI> Amours I have had in my Life-time, (says Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his xxth <HI>Letter</HI> to a <HI>Friend.</HI></NOTE>) I valued the <HI>one</HI> Mistress after I left loving her; I loved <HI>another</HI> after I left valuing her; I love and value the <HI>third,</HI> after having lost all Hopes of her: So that, methinks, according to the Course of my Passions, I ought to love and value the next, after having obtained her. However, from this time forward, upon what Follies soever you fall, be pleas∣ed, for my sake, to spare those of Love; being very well satisfied, there is not one Folly of that kind (except Marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without Railery, in Love with the Beauty of a Woman whom I have never seen; with the Wit of one whom I never heard speak, nor seen any thing that she has written; and with the heroic Virtues of a Woman, without knowing any one Action of her Life, that could make me think she had any.—<HI>Cupid</HI> will have it so; and what can weak Mortals do against so potent a God? Adieu; live pleasantly, that is, <HI>philosophically;</HI> and guard your <HI>Heart</HI> from the <HI>Pains of Love.</HI> Such were the Sentiments of our Author when about Thirty Years of Age.</P>

Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> pursued the Advice he gave his Friend, and left <HI>Cupid</HI> in the Lurch, wholly gave himself up to a <HI>Literatum Otium,</HI> became one of the best of Subjects to his Soveraign, King WILLIAM, whom he has immortalized in his inimitable Version of that <HI>Ode</HI> of <HI>Horace,</HI> begininng,

<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF THE FAIR SEX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To EUGENIA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a dangerous thing, MADAM, it must be confessed, this Con∣versing with fair Ladies; and it draws us into Inconveniencies, of which we do not at first see the Consequences. I little thought, when I talked with your Ladyship, of the Vir∣tues of your Sex, that you would have commanded me to have given my Senti∣ments upon that Subject in Writing. I grant you, <HI>Madam,</HI> you might have spo∣ken
<PB N="126" REF="155"/>
to several of your Acquaintance, who would have undertaken the Business at first Word, with all the Courage imaginable; but to me, who never durst take Pen in Hand to write any thing beyond a Billet, the Enterprize seems very terrible. I con∣fess, when you spoke to me of it first, I was well enough pleased with the Design; for I thought a Defence of the Sex, would be a Means of obliging all of the Sex, who were worth defending; and therefore look'd upon it as the writing a Circular Love-Letter to all the fair Ladies in the King∣dom. But as Men generally mix Interest with Honour, so, upon second Thoughts, I considered what I should get by it, be∣sides Fame, if it should succeed; and I found, if I persuaded all Men to be as pas∣sionate Servants to the Ladies as myself, I should make but a very indifferent hand of it: Thus, <HI>Madam,</HI> you would engage me in a Controversy, where it would be a Scandal to be vanquished, and a Disadvan∣tage to overcome: For I, who could never succeed in an Amour where there was any Fool pretended besides myself, should have great Hopes indeed, when I had persuaded all Mankind to be my Rivals. After all, <HI>Madam,</HI> there were your Commands to encourge me to it; and the Commands of a fair Lady are to me beyond all the Ar∣guments
<PB N="127" REF="156"/>
in Nature; I therefore resolved upon the Undertaking. But as it is no new thing to see People undertake a Business that they are altogether unable to perform, so I must own, I found a thing of this Nature quite beyond my Strength: You may believe, <HI>Madam,</HI> I was very melan∣choly at it, and it was then that a Friend coming into my Chamber, asked me the Occasion. As I never love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a Friend, so I presently told him the Business, That a Lady had commanded me to write her a Treatise in Defence of Women. If that be all (says he briskly) I am come to your Deliverance; for this very Morning have I been at a Conversation, where the Que∣stion concerning the Virtues and Vices of that Sex, has been handled as fully as can be desired. Thou appearest to me, my dear Friend, (said I, embracing him) like my better Genius, and therefore, without any farther Ceremony, sit down, and give me an Account of the Conference.</P>
<P>Taking a Walk (says he) this Morning in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> with several of my Acquaintance, there was one among the rest who was all the while, either gazing upon the Ladies as they came by, or speak∣ing with that Indifference to us, that made
<PB N="128" REF="157"/>
us very plainly see, he did not mind the Subject of our Discourse, tho' we talked of all the most considerable Things that offer themselves in such Conversations. (A very strange Man this, <HI>Madam,</HI> who was think∣ing upon some Mistress, I warrant, when they were raising Taxes, and beating the <HI>French.</HI>) Another, who was a Person of excellent Sense, and had a particular Friend∣ship for this, tho' they would often dispute about their several Thoughts of Women, in which Point they could never agree; (I wonder they should dispute about that, <HI>Madam,</HI> for the greatest Disputes in those Cases are, when they do agree) began to rally him upon this Subject; which he did so handsomely, that he pleased the rest of the Company very well, without displeasing his Friend in the least. PHILOGYNES (which was the Name of the first, as MISOGYNES was of the other) (Here, <HI>Madam,</HI> I must confess, I fancied my Friend put false Names upon me; for besides, that I re∣member neither of these Families in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> the one, you must know, signifies a Woman-hater, and the other, a Woman-lover) cried to MISOGYNES, Tho' I allow you to rally me as much as you please, and am glad of any Occasion I can give you, to exercise a Talent you possess in so eminent a Degree, yet I hope you do not in earnest
<PB N="129" REF="158"/>
think the Conversation of Women so ridi∣culous as you would make us believe. Ten times worse, said MISOGYNES, than I can represent it; and since we have often had slight Skirmishes upon that Occasion, and we have now Time enough to fight it out, if you have the Courage to lose one Morn∣ing's gazing at them, I challenge you to the private Walk by the Canal-side, to de∣fend their Cause; and these Gentlemen, if they please, shall be our Judges. Tho' I am very unwilling, answered PHILOGYNES, to lose a Morning that has called out all the best Company of the Town, yet since it is in Defence of the Ladies, and you so boldly challenge me, I take you at your Word, upon Condition, that if I get the better in the Judgment of these Gentlemen, you shall engage to be in Love by To-mor∣row Morning. Upon Condition, that if I overcome, said MISOGYNES, you will en∣gage to be out of Love by the same Time, I agree. That is no equal Stake, replied PHILOGYNES, for it is to lay Happiness against Unhappiness; however, I am so well satisfied of my Cause, that I will undertake you, even upon those Odds.</P>
<P>Upon this Agreement we walked all to the other side of the Park, full of Expecta∣tion of the Event of the Debate; when we were come thither, we found we had
<PB N="130" REF="159"/>
the whole Walk to ourselves, and so MISO∣GYNES who gave the Challenge, began in this manner:</P>
<P>The Propagation of Mankind being the only Way to preserve it from Extinction; and the Copulation with Women being the only Means that Nature has ordained to that End; there is no doubt but all Common∣wealths ought to give any reasonable En∣couragements to it; I have therefore al∣ways admir'd the Wisdom of those Go∣vernments that incited, or compelled their Subjects to marry, as a Thing so much more necessary to Mankind in general, than pleasing to any one in particular; but that a Man should, out of a mere Act of Judg∣ment, run after Women; that he should find Delight in their Company, is so very extraordinary, that the wise Men of old thought it hardly possible, otherwise they had had no need of making such severe Laws to force them to it, as they did.</P>
<P>Your Ladyship, who is so well versed in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, knows, that amongst the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Plutarch</HI> in Life of <HI>Licurgus.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>Spartans,</HI> they who lived long Batchelors were condemned to igno∣minious Punishments, and debarred the Privileges of other Citizens. That the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Strabo,</HI> Lib. 10.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Cretans</HI> had a Law to compel all the
<PB N="131" REF="160"/>
handsomest young Men to marry; as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Diod. Sicul.</HI> B. 1.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Thurians</HI> had to invite them to it, both by Honours and Rewards. That <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> Lib. 4, &amp; 6.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Plato</HI> ordains, that whoever lived a Batchelor to the five and thirtieth Year of his Age, should be capable of no Honour in his Commonwealth: And that the<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Aul. Gell.</HI> Lib. 1. Cap. 6. <HI>Sueton.</HI> in Life of <HI>Augustus: Dion.</HI> in <HI>ibid. Lucius Florus. Livy,</HI> Lib. 59</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Romans</HI> did not only take all Care imaginable, to encourage People to Marriage, but fright∣ned them into it by Punishments, if they refused.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, had you a Design of marrying them, I should not altogether so much condemn you; nay, had you but a Design of enjoying them without it, there might be somewhat still alledged in your Excuse. How unjustifiable soever such a Design may be, as to the moral Part, the Action itself is very agreeable to the natu∣ral. But to pick them out only for the Benefit of their Conversation, to fall in Love with their Understandings, and to leave the Company of wise Men for hand∣some Women, is just the same Thing, as if you should chuse rather to eat Jays and Parrots, than Woodcocks and Partridges, because the Feathers of the former make the finer Shew.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="161"/>
It is a very good, as well as a very ge∣neral Way, to guess at People by the Com∣pany they keep; and thus we may give a great Judgment of the Female Sex, by a View of those with whom they are the most pleased of our own. Well, let them appear then; what do you find? Fine Coats, large Cravat-strings, and good Per∣riwigs, I must own, but for any Thing else, they, and their Perriwig Blocks are Critics alike. It is true, to do them Justice, they talk most learnedly of Points and Ribbons; have most mathematical Heads for the erecting of Ladies Top-knots, make as con∣siderable Figures, talk as loud, and laugh more than any in Drawing-rooms and Play∣houses; and those who know nothing of their Language, would take them, by their Gestures, to be the wittiest Persons in <HI>Christendom;</HI> but if unluckily you under∣stand them, you will find it only false Fire, and that all this violent Laughter is pro∣duced by no Jest. Then take them out of their own Element, begin a Discourse of any Thing that is worth knowing, they are dumb; out of Modesty? No; but they hate to talk of Things that are <HI>grossier;</HI> and the Pedantry of Scholars, and Gravity of Men of Business, is utterly unfit for a Gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="162"/>
Were it nothing but the Company of such sort of Creatures as these, it would be enough, I should think, to frighten a Man of Sense from them. Can you see these Fops, as much as you are used to them, without laughing? except it rather makes you blush to think you should bring yourself into Competition with such Tools as they are: I am far from blaming them for fol∣lowing the Ladies: They avoid the Com∣pany of Men who despise them, for that of Women who admire them: Nor do I find fault with the Ladies, for being pleased with them; for since Likeness, they say, breeds Love, what Wonder is it they are fond of those Men whose Follies make them most like themselves? but for a Man who has some Pretences to Wit and Learning; for one who might be acceptable to Men of Sense, to run after them; nay, for a Man who spends all the Morning in the Study of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> to spend the Afternoon among the Impertinencies of Women, puts me in mind of the Moun∣tebank Stages in <HI>Naples,</HI> where the Jesuits and Jackpuddings entertain the Spectators by Turns.</P>
<P>It is possible, you will say, that all this makes for you; that the Faults of your Rivals render your Virtues the more re∣markable, and that there is no doubt, but
<PB N="134" REF="163"/>
a Man of Merit may succeed in any Place where a Man of no Merit may pretend; but, alas! Sir, you deceive yourself very much, if you encourage that Opinion. Had you fit Judges, there is no doubt but you were in the right: But if the fairest Lady in <HI>Christendom</HI> were amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> where they paint the Devil of her Colour, do you expect they should do her Beauty Justice? Or if a slender Man were among the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> do you think they would admire him for being well shaped, where they thought none but big-belly'd Men to be so? Credit me, Sir, a Man who leaves his Parts to the Judgment of Women, is very near the same Circumstances: Will you not believe me in that Case, because I profess an Enmity to them? You do well: but will you believe themselves? View all the Town, take good Notice: Among all the young Heiresses who run away from their Guardians, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense? Among all those Widows who ruin themselves by second Marriages, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense? Among all those Ladies who cuckold their Husbands, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense? We see them do these Things every Day, with Chaplains, Dancing-masters, Butlers, and Footmen. Who are the Men that shew
<PB N="135" REF="164"/>
the tender Billets received? What are they who boast of the Favours of all the finest Women in Town? Are they not the most despicable of Mankind? Are they not such whose Conversation is the Jest of Men of Sense? And have they above one Thing about them, that distinguishes them from the other Sex?</P>
<P>After all, Sir, are not the <HI>Women</HI> in the right in this Point? Or do they ever shew more Judgment, than when they pitch upon such Men? What do they look for in a Husband, but one who will admire them, who will be governed by them, and upon whom all their little Tricks will pass? And who but Fools are fit for that? What do they propose in a Gallant, but giving them Pleasure without Scandal? And to the for∣mer Part they have a received Notion of the Ability of Fools: Then for the Scan∣dal, who so likely to give none as those Men, whom the World will hardly believe were favoured by them, tho' they took their Oaths upon it? For notwithstanding Experience teaches us the contrary, yet People are apt to fancy, a Man of Sense must succeed before a Coxcomb; and will rather believe the former are favoured, tho' they swear they are not; than the latter, tho' they swear they are.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="165"/>
But, alas! Sir, Men of Sense they think know them, and that they take, as well as I do, to be a sure Means to hinder their being in Love. It was upon this Account that <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Chap. 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></BIBL></NOTE><HI>Solomon</HI> gives such severe Cha∣racters of them in his <HI>Proverbs;</HI> that <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>V.

It is upon the same Account likewise, that to call a Man Effeminate, has always been reckoned such a Reproach; and that to say a Man is governed by a Woman, has been one of the worst Characters you could give of his Understanding.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="166"/>
See here a dreadful Army, <HI>Madam,</HI> against us. I asked my Friend what these Gentlemen had said upon this Occa∣sion? He told me, <HI>Juvenal</HI> had written a very severe Satire (the XIth) against Women, which I should see very much to its Ad∣vantage, if I would consult Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Translation of it. For <HI>Simonides,</HI> he told me, he had written <HI>Iambics</HI> against them, in which he divides them into <HI>ten</HI> Sorts. The <HI>first</HI> he said was descended from a <HI>Sow,</HI> (you will find very noble Families among them, <HI>Madam</HI>) and she was sluttish: The <HI>second</HI> from a <HI>Fox,</HI> and she understands every thing, and has a great deal of Good in her, and a great deal of Ill too: The <HI>third</HI> from a <HI>Dog,</HI> and she is prying about, and snarl∣ing at every Body: The <HI>fourth</HI> is made of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and she understands nothing but how to fill her Belly, and sit by the Fire-side: The <HI>fifth</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> and she is changeable and inconstant; sometimes in a Calm, and then on a sudden in a Storm: The <HI>sixth</HI> is made of <HI>Ashes,</HI> and a <HI>Labour∣ing Ass,</HI> (an odd Composition you will say) and she is scarce driven to her Business with Threatnings or Force, but crams herself Night and Day, and lies with every one that comes; (now whether she takes this Quality of lying with all who come, from the Father's-side, or the Mother's-side, I
<PB N="138" REF="167"/>
cannot absolutely determine.) The <HI>seventh</HI> was descended from a <HI>Pole Cat,</HI> and she is nauseous and stinking: The <HI>eighth</HI> from a <HI>Mare,</HI> and she never cares to do any Work, and minds nothing but appearing neat and fine: The <HI>ninth</HI> from a <HI>Monkey,</HI> and her Ug∣liness is a Jest to every body: The <HI>tenth</HI> from a <HI>Bee,</HI> and she makes an excellent Wife. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Camerar. Hist. Med. L. 3. C. 11.</BIBL></NOTE> There is a Story also of this <HI>Simonides,</HI> that being asked about a Wife, he said, she was the Shipwreck of Man, the Tempest of a House, the Disturber of Rest, the Prison of Life, a daily Punishment, a sumptuous Conflict, a Beast in Company, a necessary Evil. And <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>On <HI>Matt.</HI> Chap. xix.</BIBL></NOTE> St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> besides the Homily upon the beheading St. <HI>John Baptist,</HI> which is almost all an In∣vective against Women, says in another Place, What is a Wife? The Enemy of Love, the inevitable Pain, the necessary Evil, the natural Temptation, a desirable Calamity, a domestical Peril, a pleasing Da∣mage. Thus you see these Ancients, Ma∣dam, had a very commendable Faculty of calling Names: What think you, might not the Matrons of <HI>Billinsgate</HI> improve in their Conversation? But it is natural,
<PB N="139" REF="168"/>
when People cannot convince our Reason, to endeavour to move our Passions.</P>
<P>I know you will object against these, <HI>Ana∣creon, Theocritus, Catullus, Tibullus, Ovid, Horace, Propertius,</HI> and all those Poets and Wits, ancient and modern, who pleas'd themselves, whilst they lived, in the Pursuit of Women, and have render'd themselves immortal after their Death, by the Tro∣phies they raised to them. It is confessed, that spending their Time upon the Sex, they ought to know them best: But on the other side, to excuse their own spending their Time, ought to represent them as fa∣vourably as possible; and yet, pray what is the Account they give us of them? Do they not all with one Consent complain, either of the Cruelty, or Falshood of their Mis∣tresses? Are not their Books full of Quar∣rels, Picques and Jealousies? and do they not shew the Levity, Perjury, and Lewd∣ness of the Sex?

Sit in one of their Drawing-Rooms all Day; observe the Discourse which passes; is it not a tedious Repetition of the same Impertinencies over and over again, to every new Visitant?

The horrid Affectation, the ridi∣culous Vanity, the gross Dissimulation, and the inveterate Malice that appears in all their Discourses, are Things for which I should think all the Paint on their Faces could not make Amends.

<P>Here, Madam, I could not forbear tel∣ling my Friend, that his Disputant grew scurrilous.

After this to talk of their Levity or Bab∣ling, what were it but trifling? All the Lovers and Poets who have had any thing to do with them, can furnish them∣selves with Instances enough of the first; and any Man who will give himself the Trouble of reading any one History, shall find Instances enough of the other, if his own Wisdom has hindered him from make∣ing them at his own Cost. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch</HI> of <HI>Garrulity.</HI></NOTE>There be∣ing a Senate called in <HI>Rome,</HI> upon some very extraordinary Occasion, one of the Se∣nators was desired by his Wife to tell her what it was?

No sooner was the Husband gone, but the Wife tells it too, under a Vow of Secrecy to her Maid; she to another who was her Fel∣low-Servant, who told it to her Lover; so that, to be short, it ran so fast, that as soon as the Senator came into the Market-Place, one took him aside, and told it him for a great Secret; aways goes he, and tells
<PB N="151" REF="180"/>
his Wife she had undone him, in divulging what he had trusted with her: She denies it, with a true feminine Impudence: How could it come to be known then? says he. Alas (reply'd she) are there not three hundred Senators, and might it not come from any of them as well as you? No, says he, for I invented it on a sudden, to satisfy your Cu∣riosity, and thus had I been served, if I had trusted you with the Secret. It is such another Story they tell us of young <HI>Papi∣rius</HI> to his Mother, who asking him what had been debated that Morning in the Se∣nate, told her, They were making a Law for Men to have a Plurality of Wives. But it is somewhat a more tragical Relation <HI>Plutarch</HI> gives of <HI>Fulvius.

<PB N="157" REF="186"/>
a Lady a Defence of her Sex, and you will make me send her a Satire against it. Truly, my dear Friend, said he, I designed to have told you all, but it is later than I thought, and I have Business waits for me. No Business, said I, can be so considerable to you, as the satisfying a fair Lady is to me, therefore sit down, and bring me fairly off what you have told me already, or you and I shall be Friends no longer. After all, <HI>Madam,</HI> to tell you the Truth, tho' there is no great Matter in this Speech of MISO∣GYNES, yet I can hardly believe he made it upon a sudden; 'tis possible tho', they two having discoursed the Matter as they told us before, might have provided themselves each with Arguments. But supposing that, I can scarce believe one Man would be suf∣fered to talk so long without Interruption; at least I am sure, some who we know were none of the Company. But it is possible, that he who told me, might leave out all that was spoke by others, for Brevity sake, being as you see in haste.</P>
<P>If you are as apt to be mistaken in your Judgment of Things as of Looks, replied PHILOGYNES, it is no wonder you should make such strange Conclusions. Whatever Seriousness you may see in my Face, does not, I'll assure you, proceed from any Dis∣trust of my Cause, but an Astonishment at
<PB N="158" REF="187"/>
what strange Arguments the Invention of Man can suggest against the best Things that are. I say, the Invention of Man, for I am far from believing you in earnest in this Point; I have too just an Opinion of MISOGYNES, to think he does any Thing but put on this Humour for a Trial of Skill; and I no more believe you a Hater of Wo∣men, for the Invective you have made against them, than I believe <HI>Erasmus</HI> a Lover of Folly, for the Encomium he has writ upon it. If you have therefore any thing more to urge, forbear it not upon any sup∣posed Conviction you see in my Counte∣nance; for, notwithstanding that I think you have handled the Subject as fully as any one who has undertaken it, yet I will assure you I cannot submit to your Argu∣ments; and therefore am very ready to hear any thing you have further to urge. No, says MISOGYNES, I am sensible I have troubled the Company long enough about a Trifle, and it is very fit you should have your Turn of speaking now. Part of the Company was already convinced by his Arguments, the other Part thought he had said as much as the Matter would bear, and therefore both agreed in desiring PHI∣LOGYNES to speak what he had to say, which he did in this Manner:</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="188"/>
I confess, Sir (said he smiling) when I saw the Associates you allotted me at first, I began to despair of my Cause; I own I was ashamed of my Company, and resolved to pack up Baggage instantly, and quit a Trade in which none but Fops and Fools were engaged; but when I saw the <HI>Ana∣creons,</HI> the <HI>Ovids,</HI> and all the Wits, antient and modern, in the same Circumstances, I even took Heart again. Courage, said I, the Business is not so bad as I thought, and it is possible his Heart may relent, and al∣low us some better Company than he con∣demned us to at first. At least, thought I, if it is a Folly to converse with Women, it is some Comfort that he owns it to be a Folly of which the greatest Wits of the World have been guilty before us: And when I saw all <HI>Greece,</HI> and the greater Part of <HI>Asia</HI> venturing their Lives for <HI>One</HI> Wo∣man, I thought I had somewhat the Ad∣vantage of them, whilst I ventured nothing but my Rhetoric for them <HI>All</HI> together. And when you named <HI>Samson, Achilles, Hannibal,</HI> and <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> I enquired who those Gentlemen were; for certainly, thought I, if they were such brave Men, and great Soldiers, as I have heard them represented, we have no Reason to despair of the Victory when we have them to lead us on.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="189"/>
You might have spoken more generally of them too, if you had pleased; you might have told us, that there never was a great Soldier <HI>who was not as famous for his Amours, as his Battles;</HI> that a Poet was scarce thought free of his Trade, <HI>who had not paid some Duties to Love</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cowley</HI>'s Preface.</NOTE>; and you might have ad∣ded to these all the Wise-men and Philoso∣phers of the World: You might have in∣formed us, that <HI>David,</HI> tho' a Man after God's own Heart, was not contented with∣out some Share in the Womens: That <HI>Solomon,</HI> who knew the Virtue of every Plant, from the Cedar of <HI>Libanus,</HI> to the Hysop that grows upon the Wall, took as much Pains to have as general a Knowledge of the Ladies: That <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> in his Lives of these Three Philo¦sophers.</NOTE><HI>Socrates,</HI> who was the ugliest as well as the wisest Man of his Time, would in spite of Nature aim at Love too, and, not terrified by one ill Wife, would try to mend his Hand in another: That <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> in his Lives of these Three Philo¦sophers.</NOTE><HI>Plato,</HI> whom Antiquity has called Divine, did not spend all his Time in erect∣ing Commonwealths, but that some of it was bestowed upon the <HI>Xantippe</HI>'s and <HI>Archeanassa</HI>'s: That <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> in his Lives of these Three Philo¦sophers.</NOTE><HI>Aristotle,</HI> whom <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> made Governor to <HI>Alexander,</HI> made himself a Slave to his Mistress; that this

<P>I am sorry, Sir, that I cannot be as civil to you, as you have been to me: It goes against my Conscience to place you with so bad Company, considering with what you have obliged me; and of those few great Men whom you have seduced to your Party, I am concerned that I must take better Part from you.

If <HI>Simonides</HI> gives you severe Cha∣racters of several Women, he gives you one at last that makes amends for all; one in whom no Fault can be found; and if you think that is not enough to take him off from your Party, if you are still so very fond of him, we will tell you, that Men who are deformed and ugly, as <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Girald, <HI>in vit</HI> Simonidis. Plutatch <HI>in vit</HI> Themistoclis.</NOTE><HI>Simonides</HI> was, naturally declare themselves Enemies to Women, because they fancy Women are Enemies to them; and upon that Account, not upon the Account of his Wit, we will allow him to you. As for St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> tho' we have all the Respect imaginable for a Father of Church, and upon that Account
<PB N="164" REF="193"/>
shall not enter into the Merits of the Cause betwixt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Socrat. Schol. Sozomen. Evagr.</NOTE>him and the Empress <HI>Eudoxia;</HI> yet this we shall say, Sir, that as Fathers of the Church are subject to Passions, as well as other Men; so it is no Wonder that a Man, who is used very ill by one Wo∣man, and converses with few else, should conclude them all alike. Thus after hav∣ing taken two of your Patriots from you, and if not taken, at least disabled the other two from being very credible Witnesses, you are reduced to <HI>Lucian</HI> and <HI>Juvenal.</HI> For the former, if I should quote you what the old Fathers say of him, if I should tell you, that he did not only abuse the Chri∣stian Religion, but even his own; that he rallied all the Philosophers, Orators, and Historians of his Time; that not content with that, he falls foul upon those his own Religion taught him to worship as Gods; I fancy you would not think what such a Man says of any great Weight; but truly, Sir, there is no need of that in this Case: What does this <HI>Lucian</HI> do, pray? Why <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Dialogues of the Courtesans.</NOTE>he describes the Bawds griping, covetous, and encouraging their Daughters in Lewd∣ness; his Courtesans false, jilting, and true Courtesans throughout. And what of all this, pray? what does this make for you?
<PB N="165" REF="194"/>
It is not the Cause of Bawds, or Courtesans that we undertake; tho' even amongst them he represents a great part easy, loving, good-natur'd Fools, and us'd accordingly by their Lovers. But does <HI>Lucian</HI> pretend that there are no good Women? Does he fall upon the Sex in general? or does not he bring in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Dialogue of Love.</NOTE><HI>Charicles</HI> in one place defending them, and does not he make the greatest En∣comium that can be of <HI>Panthaea</HI> in another, and speak with abundance of Esteem of se∣veral other Women in the same? And if he does introduce <HI>Callicratides</HI> in one of his Dialogues railing at the Sex, in Opposition to <HI>Charicles,</HI> he does it in the Defence of a Sin, which I am sure you will scarce think it civil to name. What shall we say to <HI>Ju∣venal,</HI> but what <HI>Plato</HI> did to <HI>Xenocrates,</HI> bid him sacrifice to the Graces. He is al∣ways violent, always declaiming, always in a Passion; and what Wonder if he falls upon the Women in one of his Fits? After all, you will make no great Matter of him; for if he has writ one Satire upon the Wo∣men, he has writ fifteen upon the Men. For the comic Poets and Satirists, whom you mention in general, when you name them in particular, I shall give them par∣ticular Answers. And now truly, Sir, see yourself reduced to a miserable Equipage;
<PB N="166" REF="195"/>
some old Husbands, and jilted Lovers; some Men with ill Faces, and worse Miens, may possibly stick to you still; but that is all: I am sorry to see a Man so well made, of so much Wit, and who has been so suc∣cessful amongst the Ladies, rank himself with such a Tribe; but you do it, I sup∣pose, by way of Variety only; and so let <HI>Misogynes</HI> appear, at the Head of his Regi∣ment, that makes a worse Figure than Sir <HI>John Falstaffe</HI>'s; let them be encouraged with stummed Wine and muddy Ale; let them give Fire to their Mundungus, and so let the Battel begin, whilst we with all the Heroes, Wits, and Philosophers, see how we can defend the Cause we have un∣dertaken.</P>
<P>I am sensible, Sir, that I have broken the Order of your Discourse, and I beg your Pardon for it: But I thought it was necessary to distinguish our Enemies from our Friends, before the Armies joined, that so we might know whom to attack, and whom to spare; and having done that, I shall now confine myself to your Method, and follow the Course that you please to lead me.</P>
<P>Though I perfectly agree with you in the Esteem of the Laws made for the En∣couragement of Marriage, and consequent∣ly cannot but regret the Want of them
<PB N="167" REF="196"/>
amongst ourselves; yet I must beg your Pardon, Sir, if I wholly dissent from you, in the Inference you would draw from it: For it is very apparent to me, and to any unbyassed Person else, I suppose, that those Laws were never made, as you fancy, for the forcing Men to the Love of Women, to which all Countries were naturally enough enclined; but for the restraining them to Particulars; that whilst they fol∣lowed the general Pleasures of the Sex, they might not lose the useful Part, which was the Procreation of Children. Had there been so few Virtues amongst them, as you please to imagine, there had been no Need of this; When we have but one Dish of Meat that we like, we fall upon that with∣out any Deliberation; but when the Fancy is distracted with Variety of Dainties, we often lose more Time in the making our Choice, than would otherwise be requisite to the satisfying our Appetites.</P>
<P>It is true, Sir, it is a very good Way to judge of People by the Company they are fond of; but it is not a certain Way to judge of People by the Company that is fond of them. There was a Taylor in Love with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> but it does not necessarily follow that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was in Love with a Taylor. If there are ridiculous Fellows who follow the Ladies,
<PB N="168" REF="197"/>
before we run down the Ladies for it, let us see if they do not laugh at them as well as we our selves. And I cannot think their pursuing them any Reason at all for Men of Sense to avoid them. You would think it very hard, that <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> should quit the Art of War, because some <HI>Thrasoes</HI> and bragging Bullies pretended to it as well as they; and <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> would take it very ill, that you should damn all Sorts of Poetry, because of the <HI>Bavius</HI>'s and <HI>Maevius</HI>'s, who set up for it; and whatever Reason you would give against the being a Minister of State, I dare say, Sir <HI>Politic Woudbee</HI>'s aiming at it would be none. (Here <HI>Philogynes</HI> seems to me not to understand the right Use of that consi∣derable Part of Mankind call'd Fools; For it is only the Half-Wit that is intolerable, and a true Fool, is next a true Wit the best Company in the World; for as a no∣ble Author has extreamly well observed,<Q><L>Wit, like Terce Claret, when't begins to pall,</L>
<L>Neglected lies, and's of no Use at all;</L>
<L>But in its full Perfection of Decay,</L>
<L>Turns Vinegar, and comes again in Play.</L>

<BIBL>DORSET.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="198"/>
After this I need not tell you, Sir, that it is very ill judging of People by their Out-side; and as I laugh at those who like a Man only for his being well dressed, so I fancy you will allow them to be as ridicu∣lous, who run him down only for the same Reason. It was objected against <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Diogenes Laertius <HI>in vit.</HI> Aristot.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Aristotle</HI> and <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plutarch <HI>in vit.</HI> Ciceronis.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Cicero,</HI> that they were too sumptu∣ous in their Apparel, and overcurious in their Dress; and without doubt there were deep <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Verres</HI>'s Jests upon <HI>Cicero</HI> for his Effeminacy. <HI>Plut.</HI></NOTE>Critics in those Times, said they minded nothing but making themselves fine; who yet, without any Offence to their Learning, we may suppose, could not give so good an Account of their Studies, as these two great Men have done of theirs.</P>
<P>(Courage! there are two good Precedents for the Beaux.)</P>
<P>After all, Sir, I know there are a great many of these gay Coxcombs, of these eter∣nal Pretenders to Love; and I have nothing to say in their Behalf; let them even shift for themselves amongst the <HI>Thrasoes,</HI> and <HI>Bavius</HI>'s. But they do not only pretend (you say) they are successful too. It is very possible, Sir; I do not know but there may
<PB N="170" REF="199"/>
be Fools enough of the other Sex, to like the Fools of ours. But it is with the best Sort of Women too (you say) that they succeed. And who tells you so, pray? They themselves. I swear, Sir, though I have a very great Esteem for those Gen∣tlemen, yet I must beg their Pardon for my Faith in this Point; I can never think a Woman, whose Wit we all allow, can be fond of a Man whose Folly we all see. On the other side, I know how natu∣ral it is, for every one to avoid Contempt; and when a Man is despised in one Place, what so reasonable as to make you believe he is esteemed in another. And I hope the Gentlemen themselves will take it for a Compliment, when I tell them I do not believe a Word they say in this Point; since certainly a Man of Honour would rather of the two, tell a Lye to the Prejudice of a Woman who uses him ill, than a Truth to the utter Ruin of one who grants him all the Favours he can ask.</P>
<P>But let us judge them by their Actions, say you! Do not most of the young Heiresses run away with the pitiful Fel∣lows? If they do, Sir, it should rather deserve your Pity than your Anger; or if you must be angry, be angry with the Guardians whose Severity frighten them away, and yet hinders them the Sight of
<PB N="171" REF="200"/>
any Men of Merit to run away with. It is no Wonder that one who has never seen any Town, but where he was born, should think that the finest in the World; and you cannot blame a Woman for being in Love with a Man who does not deserve her, if she never saw any who did. All that we can reasonably expect in that Point is, that she should make some Satisfaction when she sees the World better; and if she shews her Contempt of her Choice then, it is as much (if not more) than can be re∣quired. In like manner you cannot say a Widow makes an ill choice, except you prove she was offered a better. If a Man, who is obliged to ride a Journey, does it upon an ill Horse, you will be very well satisfy'd certainly, when he tells you, it is the best he could get. (I confess, Madam, this seems to me but a very indifferent Ex∣cuse for the Widows; for he would make us believe, it is but next Oars with them; and so I told my Friend; but he reply'd, I must consider, it is only those Widows who make an ill Choice, about which he is to speak; and as he cannot say of them, as of the young Maids, that it was for want of seeing the World; so they must be con∣tented with this Excuse, or make a better for themselves.) For the Wives, who you say cuckold their Husbands, there may be some∣what
<PB N="172" REF="201"/>
more to be said. Modesty being almost an inseparable Quality of Wit, there is no Wonder that a Man who is possessed of that, should so seldom succeed in these Under∣takings; whilst Fools, by their natural Impudence push on the Thing; and mar∣ried Women are a sort of Forts that are sooner taken by Storm than Treaty. So that this shews rather the great Confidence of the Man, than the little Judgment of the Woman; who it is forty to one had much rather a Man of Sense was possessed of her, if he would take the same Methods to gain her as the other had done.</P>
<P>(After all, Madam, I think none of these Excuses extraordinary; therefore if I were worthy to advise the Ladies, they should rather make Use of Men of Wit in all these Capacities, than put their Friends to the Trouble of inventing such pitiful Defences for them.)</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as I cannot see any Reason why Women should naturally love Fools more than Men of Wit, so I shall very hardly be brought to believe they do. In a Husband I suppose they propose a Man whose Conversation shall be agreeable as well as his Person; and who shall have Wit to entertain them, as well as Wisdom to direct them; and in whom can this be found, but in Men of the best Sense? If in
<PB N="173" REF="202"/>
a Gallant, as you say, they propose Plea∣sure without Scandal, tis very hard the Heat that warms a Man's Brain, should so en∣tirely settle there, as to render him inca∣pable of pleasing them otherwise; though it is possible, by reason of his having Varie∣ty of Thoughts to divert him, he may not give himself so entirely up to those Plea∣sures, as People less capable of thinking do: And for the Scandal, who so proper to hinder that, as those who have Prudence to manage Things so as not to be found out, and Wit enough to turn it off if they are? Whilst a Fool by his Want of Sense shall quickly make the Thing public, if there be an Intrigue, or by his Vanity brag of one, though there be none. Add to this, that when a Woman seems pleased with a Man of Wit, every body is apt to attribute it to the Pleasure of his Conversa∣tion; whereas, when she is fond of a Man, in whom we can see nothing to be liked, we naturally suppose she likes him for something that we do not see: And though it is possible it may be only Want of Judg∣ment in the Lady, yet the World is apt to compliment her Understanding in that Case, to the Prejudice of her Reputation. And to conclude, Sir, though I do not believe all those Men successful who say they are not, yet I am very much inclined to believe
<PB N="174" REF="203"/>
all those Men not to be successful, who say they are.</P>
<P>For your Examples of Women-haters, I have sufficiently I think reply'd to them already; and for your other Arguments, if it be an Affront to call a Man effeminate, I hope you do not think it any great Com∣pliment to tell a Woman she is masculine; and had that Argument been urged against you, I dare answer for you, you would have said, that that only proved the Perfections of the Sexes different; and as Man was made for the ruder Labours, it was requi∣site he should be strong and coarse; and the Women, being made for the easier Things, ought to be soft, tender, and de∣licate: And as for Mens being governed by their Wives, though the being hector'd by them is not so commendable; yet it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>V. Alex. ab Alex. L. 4. C. 8.</BIBL></NOTE> was observed by <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plutarch in vit.

So that I can∣not imagine how a Thing should be so very scandalous, that was practised by most of the bravest People under the Sun.</P>
<P>Here are very good Precedents for mar∣ried Women, which it is to be hoped they will lay up in their Hearts, and practise in their Lives and Conversations.</P>
<P>I have as great a Veneration for those Poets you mention, as any Man can; and upon that Account I shall not believe all the Ill they say of their Mistresses, because I suppose they would not have me: As I have been a Lover myself, so I know very well that People are apt in those Cases to take Suspicions for Realities, and Surmises for Matter of Fact. Does not <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the Tragedy by Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI></NOTE><HI>Aurengzebe</HI> call <HI>Indamora</HI> faithless, and ingrate? And yet I believe he would be very angry that you should call her so too;
<PB N="176" REF="205"/>
and would not any one who came in when he was in one of his Rants, conclude, a Man who loved so well, would not be en∣raged against a Mistress at that rate, unless her Falshood was very apparent? And yet when we come to examine the Cause of this Disorder, what is it, but <HI>Morats</HI> giv∣ing him his Life at her Request, or his leaning upon her Lap when he died. I rather mention this than any of the Poets you spoke of, not only because all the Mo∣tions and Passions of a Lover are described with as much Art and Delicacy, as in any of those Antients, but also, that seeing the whole Business before you, you may judge of every little Cause of his Disorder, as well as he himself, which in Odes and Elegies you cannot do. You see the Lover there in a Fury, but what Cause he has to be so, there is no body to tell you, but he who is in it. Add to this, that a Man often feigns Jealousy of his Mistress, to binder her from being so of him, and will upbraid her Falshood to defend his own. (That is a Thing, now I confess, Madam, which I can hardly believe.) And it is evident, they had not really any such bad Opinion of Women, since with all this they did not cease to run after them. However, if you think these general Answers not sufficient, let us see what we can say to Particulars.
<PB N="177" REF="206"/>
For the Complaints of Cruelty and Scorn. I look upon them as Things of Course; and therefore, shall say nothing to them. If <HI>Anacreon</HI>'s Mistress did ask him nothing but Money, why did he chuse one whose Necessities drove her upon it. And if other Men have made Complaints of the Wo∣mens minding Wealth more than Love; I desire to know whether Women have not as much Reason to make the same Com∣plaints of the Men. And for those who talk of their Mistresses Inconstancy, let us see first whether they were constant to them. For <HI>Ovid,</HI> he does not pretend to put it upon you, but complains in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eleg. 1 L. 10. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>one Place of his being in Love with two at once, and tells you frankly in <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Eleg. 4.

<L>Quid miserum torques Rumor acerbe tace.</L></Q></NOTE> Report was, that his Mistress was kind to other Men; yet the Report gave him so much Torment, that he desired it should be stifled; if therefore you have any Friendship for him, endea∣vour to fulfil his Desire in that Point. For <HI>Propertius,</HI> besides his <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Aspice uti coelo modo Sol, modo Luna ministrat,</L>
<L>Sic etiam nobis una puella parum</L><BIBL>2 Lib. El. 18.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> intemperate Love of all Women, he tells you his <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Lib. 4.

Thus whatever Qualifications those great Men had, Con∣stancy, you, see was none; and though we allow you, each of them had Merit enough for any one Woman, yet one Man can hardly have enough for half a Score.</P>
<P>Now if Ruin and Desolation has come to great Men, and States, from Women, it shewed they had a good Opinion of the Sex in general, that they would suffer for them; and had they not been sensible the greatest Part were good, they could never have been imposed upon by the Bad. Then as for those ill Women whom you have
<PB N="179" REF="208"/>
mentioned, as I suppose you will not un∣dertake to defend all the Actions of Ty∣rants and Murderers; so I do not think my∣self at all obliged to defend all the Women who have been guilty of some of their Crimes. The Dispute is not whether there have been any ill Women in the World, but whether there are not more Good. And when I have told you that the Book that condemns <HI>Dalilah,</HI> cries up <HI>De∣borah</HI> and <HI>Jael:</HI> That if <HI>Homer</HI> has repre∣sented <HI>Helen</HI> guilty of some Faults (for you will see that <HI>Homer</HI> does not represent her Cause so violently bad) he tells us of <HI>Hecuba</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> and a Thousand others who were very good ones; That if <HI>Clytemnestra</HI> was false to <HI>Agamemnon, Penelope</HI> was as famous for her Truth to <HI>Ulysses;</HI> and so put you Example against Example, which I forbear to do, only because it is so very ea∣sy; should I, I say, do but this, you could not complain that your Arguments were unanswered. But truly, Sir, we might carry the Thing much farther; we might defend some of those Women you mention∣ed, and excuse the rest. For <HI>Dalilah</HI> I shall say say nothing, out of Respect to the Scripture, that represents her as an ill Woman; it is possible, were she alive, she might tell you in her own Defence, that what Account you have of her, is from
<PB N="80" REF="209"/>
her professed Enemies: That however taking the Thing as they tell it; if she did commit a Piece of Treachery, it was against an Enemy of her Country; and that it was very hard she should be so much run down for the same Thing they have so much admired in <HI>Jael</HI> and <HI>Judith,</HI> as well as every body else did in <HI>Marcus Bru∣tus;</HI> she would perhaps push her Defence further, and tell you, that though she de∣liver'd <HI>Samson</HI> to the <HI>Philistines</HI> to be kept Prisoner, yet she neither drove a Nail through his Head, nor cut it off. But for <HI>Helen,</HI> give me Leave to tell you, it is a great Dispute amongst the Historians, whether she was forced away by <HI>Paris,</HI> or went by her own Consent; several are of the former Opinion; and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prologom. ad Apollon.</NOTE><HI>Hoelztzim</HI> says plainly, he wonders <HI>Homer</HI> will put such a ridiculous Story upon the World, as to make her the Occasion of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. (<HI>Menelaus,</HI> it must be confessed, Madam, if the Story be true, was a very easy good∣natur'd Husband, who would be at so much Pains and Charge to fetch back a Wife who run away with another Man. I do not remember in my own Memory, to have known above five or six Examples like it). And <HI>Plato</HI> in <HI>Phaed.</HI> speaks as if
<PB N="181" REF="210"/>
the belying her were the Cause of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Blindness, as well as of <HI>Stesichorus</HI>'s; but that the latter understood the Way of ex∣piating his Fault better, and made his Re∣cantation to this Effect, That there was not a Word of Truth in the Story of her going to <HI>Troy.</HI> If <HI>Clytemnestra</HI> was consenting to her Husband's Death, yet it was <HI>Egist∣hus,</HI> a Man, who gave the Blow: And if <HI>Thais</HI> did advise the burning <HI>Persepolis,</HI> yet it was no less a Person than <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great who put it in Execution. And as for <HI>Deianira</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> whatever Fata∣lity arrived to their Lovers from them, may certainly be very well excused upon the Innocence of their Intentions, and their Pu∣nishment of themselves afterwards, the one hanging, the other poisoning herself. If the <HI>Capuan</HI> Women destroyed <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s Army, they destroyed a Body of Enemies that all the Men in <HI>Italy</HI> could not. In like manner, for your other Instances we might tell you, that <HI>Procopius,</HI> who tells those terrible Stories of <HI>Theodora, Anecdota,</HI> is so very passionate all along, and mixes such ridiculous Fables with what he tells, that there is no great Credit to be given to him. (This <HI>Procopius</HI> was a Soldier un∣der <HI>Justinian,</HI> and has writ, amongst other Things, a secret History of those Times: In this he represents the Empress <HI>Theodora</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="211"/>
more like a Devil than a Woman; he makes her and the Emperor converse frequently with Spirits, and makes her put them to an Employment, that savours more of the Flesh than the Spirit.) Though granting she was as lewd as he represents her, what Wonder is it, that one who had been a stro∣ling Play-wench, and common Strumpet before the Emperor married her, should not turn Saint after? If the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Bentivoglio, Strada, Garnier</HI></NOTE>Princess of <HI>Parma</HI> embroiled <HI>Flanders,</HI> she did it by the Command of <HI>Philip,</HI> for whom she go∣verned. And as for your two Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s, <HI>Caussin,</HI> in his <HI>Holy Court</HI> you know, makes a Saint of the One, and <HI>Parsons,</HI> of the Other, with whom I leave you to fight it out, not thinking our Dispute very much concerned in it.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, if there are Impertinents, if there are ridiculous Persons of the other Sex, I hope you do not think they are all <HI>Platos,</HI> nor all <HI>Aristotles</HI> of our own; And I will undertake, for every Woman who plagues you with her Business, for every woud-bee Politician, and for every Pedant amongst them, to bring you double the Number of the Men. If <HI>Olivia</HI> is imper∣tinent in the <HI>Plain-Dealer,</HI> I hope there are <HI>Novels</HI> and <HI>Plausibles</HI> who keep her

And I appeal to you, whether <HI>Lucian</HI> in his <HI>Ti∣mon, Boileau</HI> in his eighth Satire, and my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> in his upon the like Sub∣ject, say not as much against Mankind, and make them as ridiculous as you can do the Women. And I will assure you, Sir, I am far from being of the Duke of <HI>Bri∣tanny's</HI> Mind, that Learning is unfit for a Woman; and shall, without any Offence, either to him or you, continue of the same Opinion, till you have answer'd <HI>Anna Ma∣ria Schurman</HI>'s Arguments in their Be∣half, and till you have taken away her∣self, who is one of the best Arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="213"/>
(This <HI>Anna Maria Schurman</HI> was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Lady of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> of whom you will hear more anon. There was a long Dispute between her and <HI>Rivetus,</HI> Whether Learning was fit for Women? 'Tis printed in her Works in <HI>Latin.</HI> Here, Madam, there follows a tedious Chapter, of Women who have been famous for Wit and Learning; which though it may be convenient for those who question their Abilities that Way, yet I do not see of what Use it can be to your Ladyship, or to any who have the Honour of being acquainted with you; therefore if you please, Madam, we will cast off here, and take Hands again at the Bottom.)</P>
<P>Nor indeed you fear that I should search three several Countries, and three several Ages, to furnish me with a learned Wo∣man apiece. No, Sir, even <HI>Greece</HI> itself, to go no further, had nine Muses, nine Siblys, and nine Lyric Poetesses, if you are delighted with the Number Nine, which is three times three. And if you have more Mind to Particulars, we will shew you there <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vassius</HI> de Poet.

After these we have <HI>Theano,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Pytha∣goras,</HI> who undertook his School when he was dead, with two others of the same Name (if you will believe <HI>Suidas</HI>) whereof one was a <HI>Lyric</HI> Poetess, the other a <HI>Thurian,</HI> who writ of <HI>Pythagoras.</HI> We have also about the same time <HI>Cleobulina</HI> (the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Cleobulus,</HI> one of the seven Wise Men of <HI>Greece</HI>) a Poetess, and <HI>Corinna</HI> who had the Surname given her of <HI>The Lyric Muse.</HI> We have presently after <HI>Telesilla,</HI> an <HI>Argive</HI> Poetess, not only famous for her Wit, but for her inspiring her Country-women with so much Courage, as to make them put to Flight the <HI>Spartiates,</HI> who came upon them in the Absence of their Husbands. At the same time lived <HI>Praxilla,</HI> one of the nine <HI>Lyrics,</HI> and of whom we have a Copy of Verses to <HI>Calais</HI> yet extant; What will you say to <HI>Aspatia Milesia,</HI> who is celebrated as a Sophistress, (you know the Word <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch</HI> in Vit. <HI>Themistoch.</HI></NOTE><HI>So∣phister</HI> was not then abused) a Teacher of Rhetoric, and a Poetess?

I shall not as much as mention any of those Ladies whose Wit <HI>Balzac</HI> and <HI>Voiture</HI> so much ad∣mire; I shall say nothing of the Mesde∣moselles <HI>Scuderie</HI> and <HI>Le Fevre,</HI> to the first of which we do not only owe several ex∣cellent Treatises published under her own Name, but who is said also to have had a great Share in those that appear under her Brother's; and to the latter of which we are obliged for so many admirable Versions, and judicious Observations upon most of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. I shall not as much as trouble you with our own Country-Women. I shall say nothing of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s Daughters, about whose Education <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Epist. ad <HI>Budeum.</HI></NOTE><HI>Eras∣mus</HI> has written; I shall pass by Sir <HI>Nicholas Bacon</HI>'s, who were as learned as they; shall say nothing of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI>'s Lady <HI>Pem∣broke;</HI> nor as much as mention Mrs. <HI>Phi∣lips,</HI> or any of the rest of our <HI>English</HI> Poetesses; but I can hardly forbear saying something of the Lady <HI>Jane Gray,</HI> of whom all Nations else speak, and whose Fame is
<PB N="189" REF="218"/>
more celebrated in <HI>Italy,</HI> both for her Learning and Piety, by the Account that <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> has given them of her, than it is here at home. Should I reckon up all those Ladies whose Wit and Learning has been celebrated by our own Poets; should I but enter upon the Praises of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in that Particular, I should never have done. But I can hardly omit two Ladies who are Strangers, and however I am straitned for Room, yet methinks I ought to be just to those who were civil to me; since there∣fore I received particular Favours from the Procurator <HI>Cornara,</HI> during my Stay at <HI>Venice,</HI> let me not pass over in silence his Daughter, for whom most of the greatest Princes, and Learned Men of <HI>Europe</HI> have testified such an Esteem. This Lady, be∣sides her Skill in <HI>Rhetoric, Logic, Music,</HI> and <HI>Astronomy,</HI> writ and spoke perfectly well seven several Languages; and made the Course of all the speculative Sciences with so much Success, that she might very well profess herself a Mistress of them; and all this before she was thirty Years of Age. Her Sister, whom I had the Honour to see (she herself being dead some Time before) is likewise a Person of very singular Endowments; and all this whilst they are one of the best Families of a Town, where
<PB N="190" REF="219"/>
the Nobility seem almost as proud of their Ignorance, as their Liberty. The other I shall mention, is <HI>Christina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> a Princess whose Accomplishments are so generally known, that it is enough to have named her; a Lady of that true Judgment, that she knew how to esteem Wit and Learning at the same Time that she de∣spised Crowns; and seemed to be born as a sufficient Recompence to the Common∣wealth of Letters, for all the Mischiefs her Predecessors the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> had done it before; I am satisfied it is impossible for me to add any Thing to a Glory so esta∣blished as that of this Princess is; yet as I never passed any Time either with greater Benefit, or greater Satisfaction, than what I passed in her Conversation, so I am very well pleased, methinks, with any thing that gives me Occasion to call it to my Remem∣brance. There might be as advantageous Characters, perhaps, given of some Ladies of our own Country now living, did not their Modesty, that inseparable Quality of Wit and Women, deter me from it.</P>
<P>We might tell you farther, Sir, that this Modesty too often hinders them from make∣ing their Virtues known: That they are not of those eternal Scriblers who are con∣tinually plagueing the World with their Works; and that it is not the Vanity of
<PB N="191" REF="220"/>
getting a Name, which several of the greatest Men of the World have owned to be the Cause of their writing, that is the Cause of the Womens. Had not <HI>Sapho</HI> been so much in Love, it is possible we had never heard any Mention of one of the greatest Wits that ever was born; had not <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> given us Accounts of <HI>Cor∣nelia,</HI> and the Daughters of <HI>Laelius,</HI> and <HI>Hortensius,</HI> they had never done it them∣selves; had not <HI>Jane Gray</HI> been put to Death, her Virtues had never been so much taken notice of; had not the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Nun been deserted by her Gallant, we had missed some of the most passionate Letters that these latter Ages have pro∣duced; and had not <HI>Anna Maria Schur∣man</HI>'s Works been published by a Friend, without her Consent, we had lost the Be∣nefit of them. We may tell you too, that it is not only in respect of their own Sex that they are admired, but even of ours. That of those two Odes we have yet of <HI>Sapho,</HI> we owe one to <HI>Dionysius Halicar∣nassaeus,</HI> the other to <HI>Longin,</HI> the two best Critics of <HI>Greece,</HI> who chose them out for Examples to their Rules, before any of the Mens: That the Epistle of <HI>Sapho</HI> to <HI>Phaon,</HI> which is esteemed the most delicate of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s, is supposed to be taken out of her Writings: That <HI>Corinna</HI> was five Times
<PB N="192" REF="221"/>
victorious over <HI>Pindar,</HI> the best Lyric Poet of our Sex. And were we here in <HI>England</HI> as forward in printing Letters, as they are in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> we might furnish Vo∣lumes of them written by our own Ladies, that would make all the Women-haters blush, or make all Men else blush for them.</P>
<P>(Here, <HI>Madam,</HI> I must own to you I grew jealous, for I could not imagine that PHILOGYNES would have said this, without having seen some of your Ladyship's Let∣ters.)</P>
<P>We may tell you too, that granting the equal Capacities of both Sexes, it is a greater Wonder to find one Learned Woman, than a hundred Learned Men, considering the Difference of their Educations. If you should go into <HI>Greece,</HI> and, seeing the Ig∣norance is among them at present, tell them their Countrymen were incapable of learn∣ing, would you not be very well satisfied, when they told you of the <HI>Platos</HI> and <HI>Ari∣stotles</HI> of Antiquity? And that if they had not as famous Men now, it was because they have not the same Advantages they had then? And pray why may not the Women be allowed the same Excuse? Will you by your Laws and Customs en∣deavour to keep them ignorant, and then blame them for being so? And forbid all
<PB N="193" REF="222"/>
Men of Sense keeping them Company, as you do, and yet be angry with them for keeping Company with Fools? Consider what Time and Charge is spent to make Men fit for somewhat; Eight or Nine Years at School; Six or Seven Years at the Uni∣versity; Four or Five Years in Travel; and after all this, are they not almost all Fops, Clowns, Dunces, or Pedants? I know not what you think of the Women; but if they are Fools, they are Fools, I am sure, with less Pains, and less Expence than we are.</P>
<P>Upon second Thoughts I hope, Sir, you will allow, that Women may have Wit and Learning; for their Courage and Con∣duct we may possibly say more anon. But for Heaven's sake, do not aggravate their Faults always at that Rate; for whatever <HI>Sapho</HI>'s Life and Conversation were, there is nothing in her Writings, but what re∣presents the most tender, and delicate Pas∣sion in the World: And as for <HI>Aloisia Sigaea,</HI> (I give you Thanks for putting me in mind of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vasaeus</HI> Chron. Hisp. <HI>Thuanus.</HI></NOTE><HI>Aloisia Sigaea,</HI>) who was as remarkable for her Wit and Learning as any of the other, I am very well assured you do not believe that infamous Book which goes un∣der her Name, to have been written by her; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Eloges des hommes illustres de Monsieur de <HI>Thou.</HI></NOTE> all who speak of it assure us the
<PB N="194" REF="223"/>
contrary; and that she was so far from writing it, that she <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Biblioth. Hispan.</NOTE> never published any Thing: On the other side, all Historians represent her as remarkable for her Virtue as her Learning. For the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> there is no mention in Scripture of her Travelling for any Thing but to be satis∣fied with the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon;</HI> however, if you will believe she went to him, for the same Reason that <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vid. <HI>Quint. Curtius,</HI> B. 6.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Thalestris</HI> did to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great; it was no such great Matter, in Countries where is was thought no Sin, if the one had a Mind to have a Child by the wisest Man in the World, and the other by the bravest. After all, we must own if there are lewd Women, they endeavour to conceal their Lewdness, they do not brag of it, nor fly openly in the Face of Religion; and if they once come to be publicly discovered, they are rendered infamous to all the World, and their nearest Friends and Relations avoid their Company: Whilst there are several Men who boast of their Iniquities, value themselves upon their being thought lewd, and what is worse, find others to value them upon it too; nay, by their Incitements and Encouragements to Wickedness, often bring themselves to that Pass, that the least
<PB N="195" REF="224"/>
Part of the Sins they are to answer for, are what they have committed themselves. But not a Word more, I beseech you, of <HI>Sapho,</HI> nor her new Crime, let <HI>Lucian</HI> be forgot∣ten for putting us in mind of it, and let it be cloistered up within the Walls of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Seraglio; I speak not this in Behalf of the Female Sex, but of our own; for if they should once hear of this Argument, and fall upon us with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Socrates</HI> was in Love with <HI>Alcibiades.</HI></NOTE><HI>Socrates,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plato</HI> writes Verses to <HI>Aster.</HI> a Boy, with whom he was in Love.</NOTE><HI>Plato,</HI> and all those Heroes of Antiquity whom <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Lucian</HI> produce in Defence of a like Sin in our Sex; should they mention <HI>Anacreon, Tibullus, Martial,</HI> and all those Poets who have eternized their Infamy in their Writings; and after that shew you what Progresses this Crime has made, not only in the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Dominion, but even in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> I am sure, Sir, you would wish you had said nothing of a Point, that may be so severely made use of against our selves.</P>
<P>Now tho' you are pleased to quote the Lampoons, yet you think, as well as I, that such Things are not worth any bodies take∣ing notice of; we both know there are a sort of People about this Town, who please themselves with Defamations: One of these,
<PB N="196" REF="225"/>
if they see a Man speak to a Woman, make their little Signs, their politic Winks, and possibly when they meet him, in their in∣sipid Way of Railery, tax him with it: If he is angry at them, then he is piqued, and afraid the Intrigue should be found out; If he says nothing (as it deserves nothing) then he is out of Countenance, and cannot say a Word; and if he laughs at them (which is all the Answer a Man would make to such Stuff) then he is pleased with the Thing; so that every Way the poor Lady's Reputation suffers; and these Sparks shall not fail to blow it about Town, that there is an Amour; not that they think so of you, but that you may return the Com∣pliment, and say so of them, when they speak to any Lady themselves.</P>
<P>For their Garrulity, if you would see Things which are against you, in that Treatise of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Garrulitate.</NOTE><HI>Plutarch,</HI> from whence you bring two of your Instances, you might have been furnished with enow of the Mens. But tho' it is lawful to forget Stories that are not for you, yet methinks you ought to tell out those you do mention; and when we have heard that the Wife of <HI>Fulvius,</HI> seeing what she had done, shewed her Hus∣band the Way to avoid the Consequences of it, by stabing herself first; we must cer∣tainly
<PB N="197" REF="226"/>
own, that such a Woman had Vir∣tue enough to make Amends for all her Faults. And if in Answer to the Instances you bring, I should mention the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Plutarch,</HI> de Clar.

But we need not go so far for Instances; our own Country, and our own Time, will furnish us with enow. In all the Plots we have had continually on foot, tho' we have had Women engaged and accused; tho' there was one pilloried in the first, three executed in another, and sixteen or seven∣teen excepted in a General Pardon; though there have been several seized upon like Accounts since, yet, you see, there has not been one of them who ever made a Dis∣covery.

Give me leave, Sir, to commend them for their Virtues at the same Time that I am far from defending their Faults; and though I have a very good Opinion of those Men who discover a Conspiracy upon Remorse of Conscience, yet I must take leave to believe that there are some, at least, who do it upon another Account; and without any Sorrow at all for their Design, except that it did not succeed, think to save their own Lives, by the Sacrifice of other Peoples; and make Amends for their Treason against the Government, by their Treachery to their Friends.</P>
<P>But no Wonder you are so severe upon the Faults of modern Women, when you fall upon those whom all Antiquity has reverenced. It is hard that <HI>Jael</HI> and <HI>Ju∣dith,</HI> whose Actions have been so long ad∣mired, should be called to Account for them so many thousand Years after. It would be an Injury to their Cause, to say any Thing in their Defence; and a Pre∣sumption in me to justify Actions, that the Scripture has celebrated so much. But must poor <HI>Penelope</HI> fall under your Displea∣sure too? I am sensible how much she is like to suffer, who is defended by so dull a Fellow as <HI>Homer,</HI> against those most inge∣nious Gentlemen, who are the Lampooners of our Age: However, as their Ability in
<PB N="199" REF="228"/>
Scandal needs no foreign Aid; and as I am satisfied they would think it a Disparage∣ment to them to be reckoned with <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ovid,</HI> let us free them, pray, from such unworthy Companions. For the for∣mer, I believe you are fully satisfied the <HI>Priapeia</HI> are none of his; and as fully sa∣tisfied that the Authority of such sort of Verses is not extreamly much to be depend∣ed upon: And for <HI>Ovid,</HI> if in the Person of a Bawd, who he tells you was a Liar, he gives you a Reflection upon <HI>Penelope;</HI> yet he makes her very sufficient Amends, when <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>Penelope</HI> mansit, quamvis custode remoto.</L>

And taking the Story as it lies, that her House was always full of Lovers whom she could by no Means get away; <HI>Laertes</HI> being too old, <HI>Telemachus</HI> too young to encounter them; it certainly shews her Virtue so much the more: For as there is no great Cou∣rage required to keep a Fortress in the Time of Peace, so a very little Virtue is sufficient to preserve that Chastity which no Body ever thought it worth his While to attempt. Now if <HI>Lycophron</HI> and <HI>Duris Samius</HI> repre∣sent her as a lewd Woman, as I understand not how they should come to know it, all

the Writers who lived before them giving so very different an Account; so for <HI>Ly∣cophron,</HI> it is no great Wonder a <HI>Greek</HI> and a Poet should lye; or that <HI>Duris Samius,</HI> seeing the Etymology of the Word <HI>Pan</HI> come so pat, should feed us with a Story upon it, of his own Invention. (<HI>Pan</HI> you remember, <HI>Madam,</HI> in <HI>Greek</HI> signifies All, and who would not tell a Lye for so pretty a Conceit?) You may observe also, that this Author was not of so established a Re∣putation as <HI>Cicero</HI> would make us believe, since <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of <HI>Alcibiades.</HI></NOTE><HI>Plutarch,</HI> who quotes him once, does it only to contradict him in a Point of History, that he ought to have known better than this. For <HI>Lucretia,</HI> observe of Sir <HI>Charles Sidley,</HI> as of <HI>Ovid</HI> before, that he only makes the Bawd say it; and if you consider the Fear in which she was, you will find that that Passion often makes Peo∣ple run into a greater Danger to avoid a less, of which you have Instances enow in our own Plantations, of the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Ligon</HI>'s History of <HI>Barbados.</HI> Fol. p. 50.</BIBL></NOTE> Slaves who hang themselves, to avoid their being beat.</P>
<P>After all this, Sir, if you still think with <HI>Le Chambre</HI> that Men have a greater natu∣ral Inclination to Virtue than Women, yet I hope you will grant they have taken a very becoming Care to overcome that Inclina∣tion;
<PB N="201" REF="230"/>
and if Nature has not given so large a Talent to the other Sex, yet they have improved that Talent much better than we have done ours. Then for your In∣stances of some few ill Women, I tell you, as I did before, that the Cause in general is not at all concerned in them; and when I shew you an <HI>Atreus</HI> cutting his Brother's Children in Pieces, and giving them to him to eat; a <HI>Phalaris</HI> roasting People alive in a brazen Bull; a <HI>Busyris</HI> murdering all his Guests; a <HI>Nero</HI> ripping open the Womb of his Mother, to see the Place where he had lain; and so for every Crime of that Sex, shew you how far they have been outdone by some of our own, as that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lucretia Marinella, La Nobiltà e l'eccellenza delle Donne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on deffetti e mancamenti degli Huomini.</NOTE><HI>Italian</HI> Lady I mentioned does in her Treatise upon a like Occasion, I am sure you will find a very great Disadvan∣tage of your Side. But I take you at your Word, let us go a Circuit with the Judges, and if you find not six Men condemn'd for one Women, I will pay the Charges of the Journey. It is true, indeed, as most of the Women who are condemn'd, are so, for a Crime which they commit to pre∣vent their Shame; so the Care of that, and Hypocrisy, are two Faults of which out Sex is not so generally guilty. Now though
<PB N="202" REF="231"/>
I do not think myself obliged to say one Word for any one of those Women you have condemned; and shall therefore leave <HI>Phoedra</HI> and <HI>Fausta</HI> to your Mercy, though neither of them expected the Cruelty of their Husbands should have carried Things so far; and shall not argue much for <HI>Se∣miramis,</HI> though certainly her having all the Bravery, Wisdom, and Virtues of our Sex in the greatest Perfection, might move you to forgive her the having some of our Faults; and for her putting Men to Death, I am contented that every one who boast of Ladies Favours should be served in the same Manner; (Here, Madam, I cannot at all agree with <HI>Philogynes,</HI> because it might be severe upon some honest Gentlemen, whom all the Laws against Adultery and Fornication would never reach.) Yet me∣thinks I have an Inclination to say some∣what for Queen <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> because she is generally represented so very ill. The common <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Essais de <HI>Montagne,</HI> L. 3.

On the other side, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Casi degli Huomini Illustri.</NOTE><HI>Boccace,</HI> who lived a great while in that Court, throws all the Blame of the Action upon the Con∣spirators, and none at all upon the Queen.

offended you: If <HI>Helen</HI> runs away from <HI>Menelaus,</HI> let all <HI>Greece</HI> arm, and fetch her back again; If <HI>Clytemnestra</HI> consents to the killing <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> let <HI>Orestes</HI> kill her for it; If <HI>Semiramis</HI> puts the Men she has made Use of to Death, let her own Son serve her in the same Manner; If <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> causes <HI>Andreossa</HI> to be strangled, let <HI>Durazzo</HI> cause her to be strangled in the same Place; Let not your Severity stop there, but let their Infamy live when they themselves are dead; and let the <HI>Euripides</HI>'s, the <HI>Juvenals,</HI> and the <HI>Misogynes</HI>'s, set out their Actions in their true Colours. But let the Business go no farther, I beseech you. Let not <HI>Hecuba,</HI> nor <HI>Andromache</HI> suffer, because <HI>Helen</HI> is a wanton Woman; nor <HI>Penelope</HI> be run down, because <HI>Clytemnestra</HI> is an ill Wife; and if <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> strangles her Husband, let not all those who have died for theirs, fall under the same Condemnation. It is one of the chiefest Ends of Punishments to distinguish the Good from the Bad, do not you there∣fore by Punishments confound them. If <HI>Tibullus</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Mistresses jilt their Lovers, let it be remembered against them two thousand Years after; and if <HI>Misogy∣nes</HI>'s serve him so, let him shew his Re∣sentment in as severe a Manner as he pleases. Let him disdain the mean Revenge of ma∣licious

Whispers, and nameless Lampoons, and the much meaner Way of railing at all, because one has injured him; but let him boldly hunt her out from the Herd; let him publish her Infamy in lasting Charac∣ters; though she is free from Conscience, let her be plagued with the Stings of Shame; and let all Women be terrified by her Ex∣ample from being false to Men of Wit, or kind to Fools. But let him have very full Sa∣tisfaction of the Matter of Fact first; let him not go upon dubious Grounds, nor jealous Surmises; let him not believe the Vanity of some, nor the Malice of others; let him consider the Stories of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Orlan.

After all, I give you even in that greater Power than I should care to take myself; I would rather by other Peoples Faults correct my own, and should think the noblest Re∣venge a Man could take upon a Woman who injured him, would be the doing some Action that would make all the World ad∣mire him; I would have every body up∣braid her with my Wrongs, whilst I myself was silent: It is true, if by the Injuries she
<PB N="206" REF="235"/>
did me, there were any Aspersions cast upon my Reputation; there Justice to myself would oblige me to make the Story public: But I would certainly endeavour to reclaim her by Mildness, before I made Use even of that Severity; and as I should scorn any Favour that was the Effect of Fear, so if I once broke into an open War, all the Sub∣mission she could make should never bring me to an Amity again, though perhaps my own Good-nature might in Time prevail upon me for a Forgiveness.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is what I thought necessary to reply to what you said; in which I see we have quite exceeded the Bounds of a Dia∣logue, and turn'd that into Declamation, which was intended only for Conversation.

Should I after this defend them in the Virtue to which they are thought to have least Pretences, which is, Courage; should I but name those who have been famous for their warlike Atchieve∣ments; should I tell you of <HI>Deborah, Pen∣thesilaea, Thalestris, Camilla;</HI> should I shew you a Country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Acosta</HI>'s History of the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Amazons,</HI> even in our own Time: Should I carry you into <HI>France,</HI> and shew you a warlike Virgin (at least an unmarried Woman) whose Memory is still annually celebrated by one of their chiefest <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orleans.</NOTE> Towns, and who, besides her Fame in their Chronicles, has given a Subject to one of the most famous <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">La Pucelle <HI>de Monsieur</HI> Chapelaine.</NOTE> Heroic Poems which that Nation has produced; would you not, after all, confess they might very easily be defended, even in this Point too? But I shall wave that; I am satisfied with the Care universal Custom has taken of them; and as Seamen in a Storm, to preserve their Things of greatest Value, throw away those of less; so I am very well pleased that Mankind should be exposed to the Hazards of War, whilst the Fair Sex is preserved in Safety at Home, whose Smiles are the noblest Reward a brave Man can
<PB N="210" REF="239"/>
desire for all the Hazards and Fatigues he has endured in a Campagne.</P>
<P>But it is generally agreed that all Virtues are requisite for those who govern well; and since there are some Countries where Women are excluded from the Throne, and no Country where they are not post∣poned, it would be convenient, methinks, to see what they do, when by Accident they are placed upon it. I shall not trouble you here with <HI>Deborah,</HI> nor <HI>Esther,</HI> nor as much as mention <HI>Semiramis,</HI> though you have mentioned her upon another Occa∣sion; and yet certainly the Bravery of most of her Actions ought to make us forget the Faults of some few; but I shall confine myself within the Bounds of our own Country.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tacitus</HI> in Vita <HI>Agric.</HI> and from him <HI>Sammes</HI> in his <HI>Bri∣tania Illustratá.</HI></NOTE>At a Time when the <HI>Britons</HI> groaned under the Servitude of the <HI>Romans;</HI> when the King, by thinking to oblige the Em∣peror, gave him an Opportunity of pillag∣ing his Country; and that their Patience under their Sufferings, was only a Means of making them more; When their Houses were robbed, their Wives and Daughters ravished, and their Sons taken away from them; then <HI>Boadicea</HI> arose, and by her Courage, as well as Eloquence, inspired
<PB N="211" REF="240"/>
her dispirited Countrymen with a Resolu∣tion of throwing off that Yoke which was grown intolerable to be born. It is true, indeed, the End was not answerable to the Successes of the Beginning; nor to the Glory so heroic an Undertaking deserved; however as it was neither Want of Courage nor Conduct in her, so we ought to render her that Veneration which is due to so resolute an Enterprize.</P>
<P>But as one of the greatest Attempts the <HI>Britons</HI> made for their Liberty was whilst they were led by a Woman, so we must own the greatest Glory our Nation could ever boast, was under the Government of one of the same Sex. It was in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> that this Island arrived at that Pitch of Greatness, to which it had been ascending for several Ages, and from which it has been declining, till very lately, ever since: It is the Name of this Princess that is dearer to all <HI>Englishmen,</HI> than the Names of all the Monarchs since the Con∣quest besides, and the only one whose Birth∣day has been celebrated after her Death, by the voluntary Gratitude of the People.</P>
<P>But however we may forget Things that are past, let us not oversee that which lies before our Eyes; and since the Occasion is so very fair, I know not how we can omit the shewing our Sense of those Virtues, of
<PB N="212" REF="241"/>
which the whole Nation has demonstrated so grateful an Acknowledgment by the Body of their Representatives; and never were they more truly their Representatives before. Yes, Sir, without going to foreign Countries, without searching the Histories of our own, we have even in our own Time, and our own Country, a Princess who has governed to their general Satis∣faction, a People the most curious to pry into the Faults of their Governors, of any People under the Sun. A Princess, who though she never shewed any Fondness of Vain-glory, or Authority, yet when the Necessity of the Kingdom called her to the Helm, managed Affairs with that Dexte∣rity, which is very rarely found in those who are the most ambitious of Command. Every Thing during that little Time of her Government, was ordered with that Cou∣rage, Conduct, and Prudence, that her greatest Friends cannot find Eloquence enough to commend, nor her greatest Enemies the least Pretences to condemn. Though she had a Husband venturing his Life in another Country, with a Bravery equal to what has made us suspect the Sto∣ries of Antiquity; tho' our Fleet, the Bul∣warks of the Nation, was managed in a Manner the Courage of the <HI>English</HI> Seamen was utterly unacquainted with; tho' a
<PB N="213" REF="242"/>
Monarch, who thinks himself able to con∣tend with all <HI>Europe</HI> together, seemed to make his utmost Efforts against a Princess, who had nothing but the universal Hearts of her Subjects to defend her; tho' all Christendom was in Suspence to see the Event of the Undertaking, and every little Prince had forgot his own Danger to con∣template hers; even at this Time did we see her look with all the Unconcern ima∣ginable, and whilst every Body else was alarmed for her Safety, she only seemed to have known nothing of the Danger. Not that this Unconcern proceeded from any Ignorance of her Condition, or unreason∣able Contempt of her Adversary; no, she provided against their Attempts with all the Prudence could be wished for, at the same Time that she looked upon the Danger with all the Courage in Nature.</P>
<P>But however great these Virtues may appear, when they are set off by the Lustre of a public Command, yet they are in Effect much greater, when they teach Peo∣ple to despise all such dazling Trifles. Here it is, Sir, that we have a fresh Field for Eloquence, when we see a Lady dissatisfied at that Glory which she had to every Bodies Satisfaction beside, and grudge herself that Authority, which she owed to the Absence of a Husband whom she loved so much
<PB N="214" REF="243"/>
better than that. What think you, Sir, of that Alacrity, of that Joy with which she resigned up the Government? Does it not put you in mind of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Gene∣rals, who quitted their Plough to command an Army, and when the Victory was gain'd, returned with greater Content to their Plough again? This is that Wisdom which we should admire; this is that Virtue which we should adore; and we ought to despise all those little Pretenders to Business, who thrust themselves into the Management of Affairs against every Bodies Will but their own; and having neither Virtue nor Pru∣dence enough to retire from it at the uni∣versal Murmurs of the People, are gene∣rally made Sacrifices at last to the just Re∣sentment of an enraged Nation.</P>
<P>These are those blazing Comets, whose fatal Glories portend Destruction to a Go∣vernment, whilst the Virtues of the others, like those of the Sun, give it Life and Heat, by their benign Influence. Much more, Sir, might be said in <HI>Defence</HI> of the <HI>Sex,</HI> which I shall purposely omit, because I am satisfied I can never conclude with a more illustrious Example.</P>

<P>I desire, Sir, that you would please to hear me first, and judge whether it is this old Man or I who have most need of your Medicines. I confess, indeed, that what he says is true. But pray consider, that I spend this Estate in pleasing myself; and were it not a great <HI>Folly</HI> to debar myself of Plea∣sure for the <HI>present Moment,</HI> which is all I am sure of, for fear of not having Means to enjoy them in a <HI>future Time,</HI> to which I have no Security that I shall ever arrive. But, granting, I were certain of Life, Is it not a Madness to waste all my Youth, which
<PB N="220" REF="249"/>
is the only Time we are capable of Plea∣sure, to lay up Wealth, which we are to make Use of in an Age when we are not capable of any Pleasure at all. But this old Man, who has the Confidence to ac∣cuse me, does ten times worse. He did not only heap up Wealth all his Youth, but he continues to do so still; and though his Age, and the Infirmities of his Body give him hourly Notice that he can hardly live one Year longer, yet is he at his Usury, his Extortion, and a hundred Ways to hoard up Wealth, as if he were to live ten Thousand Years.</P>
</SP>

<P>A very palpable <HI>Folly</HI> indeed. <HI>Mercury,</HI> put him aside too.</P>

<P>I did not doubt, Sir, but that I should convince you at last. I may go away now?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Friend! Does that Man's being a <HI>Fool</HI> hinder you from being a <HI>Fool</HI> too. If it be a <HI>Folly</HI> in him to <HI>heap</HI> up Money that he can never probably live to <HI>spend;</HI> Is it not a <HI>Folly</HI> therefore in you to <HI>squander</HI> away that Money which probably you will
<PB N="221" REF="250"/>
live to want. Take Care, <HI>Mercury,</HI> that they may be both put in the Hospital.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall be done. In the mean time here are some others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, what have you to say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>First</HI> MAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is a Friend of mine, an honest, good-natur'd Man as lives; but he has a <HI>Wife</HI> who makes him the greatest <HI>Fool</HI> in Nature; and though she abuses him in the grossest Manner imaginable, insomuch that half the Town laugh at him, yet is he him∣self blind to that in his own House, which any Stranger sees. Here is <HI>one</HI> who has been often found with <HI>her,</HI> and who can tell you more, if you examine him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and what can you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Second</HI> MAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that I can say, Sir, is, that the Gen∣tleman is a very worthy <HI>Gentleman;</HI> and his Lady a very fine <HI>Lady.</HI> He has often,
<PB N="222" REF="251"/>
indeed, bragg'd to me of the Happiness of a marry'd Life. I thought the best Way to find out this Happiness, was in going to his Lady, who has fully convinced me of all her Husband said. But as I have a perfect Friendship for the Gentleman, I must confess, Sir, I am as well satisfied with his having a fine <HI>Wife,</HI> as if I had <HI>one</HI> myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a fine Time on't, the mean while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, Sir, I have nothing to say in Contradiction to these Gentlemen. All that the one says, and the other would in∣sinuate, may be true for aught I know; nor do I think it much worth my While to enquire after it. Half the Town, the first says, laugh at me for being a <HI>Cuckold;</HI> and he would have me make it public, that the other Half might laugh at me too. But pray let us consider how much wiser he acts: He marry'd a <HI>Wife,</HI> who by the way is not extreamly taking; and yet you cannot imagine what Care, what Con∣trivances, what cunning Stratagems, this wise Person made Use of to search out a Thing, which, after all, he did not care to
<PB N="223" REF="252"/>
find. And though with all his Bustle he could find out nothing that really made against her, yet he has cast her off with Infamy and Shame, chiefly indeed to him∣self, for using a Wo man ill who never gave him Occasion for it. If there be so many who laugh at me for a tame Husband, let him hearken after his own Concerns, and he will find a much greater Number who rail at him for a base and ill-natur'd one.</P>
<P>Now for this brisk <HI>Monsieur</HI> here, for this <HI>finished</HI> Gentleman, who can with so much Delicacy rally the poor <HI>Fools</HI> that <HI>marry!</HI> So very ingenious a Person, no doubt, acts much more wisely himself. Lord, how is his Estate divided? One Part upon Taylors; another upon Milli∣ners; a third upon Perfumers; a fourth upon Perriwig-makers. All his Time spent between the Toilet, the Play-house, the Park, and Drawing-Room. And upon what noble Design, pray, is all this Time and all this Money wasted? Even, Gen∣tlemen, that this most charming Person of his, may attain that with all this Cost which I received Twenty Thousand Pound for doing. Would his Niceness be con∣tented with the Meat that had been tum∣bled, and cold upon my Trencher? Tru∣ly, Sir, his Happiness is little more than
<PB N="224" REF="253"/>
this, I that am the <HI>Fool,</HI> come to her when I will, stay with her as long as I will, and command her as I will; while this wise Gentleman is waiting a frosty Night under her Window, breaking his Brains for Songs and Billets for her; bribing her Women, losing his Rest, and venturing the being abused, kicked down Stairs, and having his Throat cut whenever he happens to be found out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very great <HI>Fools,</HI> truly, all <HI>Three!</HI> Is it not strange, <HI>Mercury?</HI> One would think every Man wise, when we hear him talk of <HI>other Peoples Concerns;</HI> and yet we find them all <HI>Fools</HI> when we look into their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> how should it be other∣wise? when a Man is told of his <HI>Folly,</HI> he does not consider whether it be true, and endeavour to mend it: He only considers whether the Man who tells him of this, be not guilty of some <HI>Folly</HI> too; and if he find he is, as I doubt we shall find few who are not, he rests as well satisfied in laughing at him, as if he were absolutely free from all sort of <HI>Folly</HI> himself.</P>

<P>An't please you, Sir, this young Man is my Husband: He made fair Pretences to me before Marriage, but now he neglects and despises me for every other Woman. Now I appeal to you, Sir, and to all the World, whether it be not a very <HI>great Fol∣ly,</HI> for a Man to tye himself, during Life, to a Woman he does not love?</P>

<P>Very good, Mistress. And if it be a <HI>Folly</HI> in him to marry a Woman that he does not love, was it not a <HI>Folly</HI> in you to marry a Man without knowing first whe∣ther he loved you or no?</P>

<P>Put them in all, without farther Deli∣beration. For though People may be al∣lowed to be as critical in their Choice as they please before Marriage, yet when that is once done, it is a great <HI>Folly</HI> to complain.</P>

<P>One who has Wit, Beauty, Virtue, Riches, and is of a very considerable Family.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very much to be suspected that thou art guilty of <HI>Folly</HI> in having this Opinion of her. A Woman with Wit and Beauty, marry an odd disagreeable Fellow, and not cuckold him! However, Friend, if it be so, you may go away, but be sure you send your <HI>Wife</HI> in your Place.</P>

<P>Do you reckon it a <HI>Folly</HI> then in a Wo∣man not to <HI>cuckold</HI> her Husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Friend, we do not tell you so. But when a Woman who finds by her Constitu∣tion that she shall make any Husband a Cuckold, takes one who is very fit for that Purpose, there are some wicked People who think she does as wisely as a Woman
<PB N="228" REF="257"/>
in her Circumstances could. But when a Woman marries a Man who is fit for no other Use than to make a Cuckold of, with∣out a Design of putting him to any Use, that that Woman commits a <HI>Folly,</HI> there was never any one yet could doubt.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But see what vast Crouds are waiting for Audience; and with how much Eagerness are they set upon discovering the <HI>Follies</HI> of one another? It is impossible for us to hear all the particular <HI>Follies</HI> of which particu∣lar Men are guilty. It seems to me there∣fore by very much the easiest Way, to pick out the wise Men first, and when we have done that, we may apply general Medi∣cines to the rest, without enquiring far∣ther into their particular Distempers. Make Proclamation therefore, <HI>Mercury,</HI> that Peo∣ple may no longer trouble themselves with bringing the <HI>Fools</HI> of their Acquaintance, but henceforward let them bring none but the <HI>Wise Men.</HI></P>

<PB N="229" REF="258"/>
may stay till the End of the World. No, <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> no: In searching the <HI>Follies</HI> of Mankind, it was necessary to have an Ac∣count of them from others, and not from themselves: But if you would search for <HI>Wise Men,</HI> you must not ask Mens Opinion of one another, but take what every Man thinks of himself.</P>

<P>Can <HI>Aesculapius</HI> know I am a Poet, and ask that Question? As much as a Man is above a Beast, so much is a Poet above another Man.

<SPEAKER>STATESMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is no great Need of con∣vincing <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> how little that Man deserves the Title of Wise, since he him∣self has been pleased to prove it sufficiently already. I will not say any Thing to the Man himself, or enquire what Pretences he has to the Title of a Poet; but taking it for granted that he is as good as he fan∣cies himself, yet can any Thing be so ri∣diculous as the very Design he proposes. He does not pretend that Poetry makes People happy in this World, because we very plainly see the contrary; but he pleases himself with a vain Reversion of imaginary Honours that he is never to enjoy till he himself is insensible of them. It will be a very great Satisfaction, doubtless, to a Man when he is in the Grave, to think his Verses run as smoothly as ever; and one must be an Infidel to doubt but that the Author of a fine Poem will be extreamly considered in the other World.</P>
<P>I do not say this out of any Malice to the Profession of a Poet, nor would I pre∣tend to take a Title from them, though they do not deserve it, but in order to shew you those who do. Do you ask me then who it is that deserves the Title of a <HI>Wise</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="261"/>
<HI>Man?</HI> Whom should I answer, but him who knows how to <HI>govern</HI> the <HI>State.</HI> If particular Persons of a Community think they have any Title to Wisdom, how much more must they allow that Title to those who are capable of governing the Com∣munity? It is they, certainly, who can move Assemblies, who can advise Kings, who can govern Commonwealths, that deserve the Title of the <HI>Wise.</HI> How con∣siderable a Figure does such a Man make in a Government? How much is he fol∣lowed and caressed? What Advantages does he get to himself and Family? And how much is he flattered and adored by these very <HI>Poets</HI> who would vainly arro∣gate the Title of <HI>Wise</HI> to themselves?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such has been the <HI>quondam</HI> Advice of Mr. POPE's <HI>Lelius,</HI> alias <HI>Saint John,</HI> alias <HI>The Examiner.</HI></NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I am of a Profession that do not trouble themselves with the Trifles of the World, yet I cannot, I confess, be pleased to see People take a Title to themselves, to which they have not the least Pretence. I might observe here, that considering how Kings are for the most part advised, and Commonwealths governed, a Man has no great Reason to boast of his having a Hand in either. But I shall wave all that as to
<PB N="233" REF="262"/>
my Particular, and speak to the Employ∣ment of a <HI>Statesman</HI> in general. Is there then any Thing so ridiculous as for a Man to pro∣pose the making himself Great, as the End of all his Actions? The only End a Wise Man proposes, is the making himself happy; how ridiculous then must he appear, who makes himself miserable, in order to make himself Great? Who seeks the Contempt of the Wise, that he may get the Admiration of Fools? Who leads a false dissembling Life; fawning upon those who treat him insolently, and treating those insolently who fawn upon him? Who values himself upon the bearing other Peoples Burdens, for which the only Thanks he gets, is Envy, or Contempt: Envy if he succeed, and Contempt if he fail? Should a Man, who came late to an Inn, instead of taking the Rest that was requisite to refresh him for the next Day's Journey, enter into Cabals, form Designs, and manage Intrigues to get the best Room in the House, which would make him very uneasy if he fail'd of it; and from which, tho' he succeeded, he must necessarily depart the next Morning; would not this Man appear ridiculously foolish, and contemptible to all the World? And when we see a Man in a World from which he must necessarily depart in a very short Space of Time, instead of preparing
<PB N="234" REF="263"/>
himself for what is to follow, waste all that little Time in senseless Cabals, in vain De∣signs, and in ridiculous Intrigues, to make himself Great and Powerful; which, if he do not attain it, makes him uneasy; and which, if he do, he must leave immediate∣ly again: Is not this Man ten Times more ridiculous, and more foolish than the other? The Man who by his Folly loses his Rest one Night, will without doubt grow wiser, and take a double Share of Rest the next: But, alas! in the other Case, it is quite different; there is no second Opportunity of correcting the first; and he who has spent <HI>one</HI> Life foolishly, will never be trust∣ed with <HI>another</HI> to employ better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wisely urged, O incomparable <HI>Stoic!</HI> The Folly of this sort of Men is very palp∣able; and you, certainly, who can so sagely find out their Infirmities, can easily disco∣ver to us the Men who are subject to no Infirmities at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>You judge right, divine <HI>Aesculapius!</HI> it is among us, and only us, that you must expect to find a real Wise Man. And our Leaders have taught us, upon a due Con∣sideration
<PB N="235" REF="264"/>
of the World, to pronounce all Men Mad beside. 'Tis true, their Extra∣vagance does not appear, perhaps, to the Vulgar; but as in a Mad-house, one of the Patients does not perceive <HI>that</HI> Madness in his Companion, which is presently found out by a sober Stander-by: So in this <HI>uni∣versal</HI> Madness which possesses the World in general, tho' they do not discover it in one another, yet it is at first Sight apparent to the Eyes of the Sage. Do you ask me then, who is this Wise Man that I have mentioned? It is he who places not his Felicity in his Beauty, his Wealth, or his Learning; who desires no Pleasure, who fears no Pain: Whom the Frowns of For∣tune cannot deject, nor her Smiles exalt: Who is happy in Prisons, in Banishments, in Torments: Who, if he were broiling in <HI>Phalaris</HI>'s BULL, would cry out, <HI>How plea∣sant is this!</HI> It matters not how many Ar∣rows Fortune aims at him, since he is im∣penetrable to them all. As there are some Stones so hard, that the Iron cannot touch; as Diamonds can neither be cut nor broken, but resist the strongest Force; as Rocks in the Sea break the Fury of the Waves, and, beaten upon so many Ages, retain no Marks of its Rage; so is the Soul of a Wise Man, solid and firm; and has collected so much Strength, that it remains as safe from all
<PB N="236" REF="265"/>
Injuries, as any of the Things I mentioned. But what will you say; is there no one then who will attempt the injuring a Wise Man? Yes, they will attempt it, but they cannot perform it: He is elevated so much above the Vulgar, that none of their ill Designs can arrive at him. When that foolish King darkened the Day with his Arrows, there was not one of them which reached the Sun; when the Chains were cast into the Sea, they could not bind the Waves; and those who destroy the Tem∣ples, do no Injury to the Divinity: In like Manner, whatever is done proudly, mali∣ciously, or insolently, against a Wise Man, (who is in nothing different from a God, but in Point of Time) is but attempted in vain.</P>

<P>O sage! O wonderful! O incomparable <HI>Stoic!</HI> This, this is a Wise Man indeed! Is it possible that People can continue Slaves to their <HI>Follies,</HI> when Wisdom proposes such sublime, such noble Rewards to her <HI>Fol∣lowers?</HI> But descend a little from this high Region, in which you are placed; con∣form yourself to the Weaknesses of others; and convince their Stupidity by living Ex∣amples of this high Pitch of Wisdom you have so nobly described to them.

<SPEAKER>AESCULAPIUS.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mercury,</HI> thou art a swift Messenger, haste away to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> inform him of what we have done, and know his further Plea∣sure in the Matter: You may tell him, that upon a full Survey of Mankind it appears, that every one has such a <HI>sufficient Share of Folly,</HI> that he has no Reason at all to com∣plain of his Neighbours having more. That in Answer to those who think their Folly obstructs their Happiness, it is very plain, that the Happiness of Mankind is so com∣plicated with this Folly, that it is impossi∣ble to cure them of the one, without endan∣gering the other too. Should we convince the <HI>Fool</HI> who squanders away his Money, that he might live to want it; should we convince the <HI>Fool</HI> who heaps up Treasure, that in a little Time he must die, and have
<PB N="240" REF="269"/>
all his Treasure taken from him; should we convince the <HI>Husband,</HI> who places his Happiness in his Wife and Children, that the one cuckolds him, and the other are none of his; should we convince the <HI>Man</HI> who does Things to be eternally famous, that after Death he will have no Sense of Fame, or of whatever is said of him; we should make them all miserable and wretch∣ed. On the other Side, by taking away their Folly, we shou'd take away one of the most useful Qualities in the World, since it is very evident, that Mankind live upon the Follies of one another. Were there not <HI>Fools</HI> who sell Estates, what would become of the <HI>Fools</HI> who buy them? Were there not <HI>Fools</HI> who marry, human Kind would come to an End. Were there not <HI>Fools</HI> of Business, how would the <HI>Fools</HI> that meddle with no Business be managed? Were there not fighting <HI>Fools,</HI> who would protect the <HI>Fools,</HI> that would not fight, from Oppression? And were there not <HI>Writing Fools,</HI> what would the <HI>Reading Fools</HI> do for a Diversion? So that upon the whole Mat∣ter I think we had even as good leave the World as we find it. However, if he thinks there ought to be somewhat done in this Matter, after having made so much Noise about it; the most general Folly in Men being that of shewing Severity to other
<PB N="241" REF="270"/>
Peoples Faults, while they neglect those they commit themselves; He may order a solemn <HI>Proclamation</HI> to be made, <HI>That no Man shall have the Privilege of censuring the Follies of other People, till he can bring a Certificate, under the Hands of three judi∣cious Neighbours, that he has none at all of his own.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I receiv'd your generous Present two Days after the Date, yet the Affairs of my Parents, and the Commands of a noble Lady,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lady <HI>Delawar.</HI></NOTE> have harrass'd me so much, that I could not get Time to return my Thanks sooner. I doubt you'll quickly be convinc'd you have formed a very unjust Idea of me; for I protest, on a Self-Examination, I can't find one of those good Qualities you lay to my Charge. However, 'tis highly obliging in you, to fancy me ingenious and agreeable, 'till you know the contrary; as such, I accept the Compliment, and acknowledge your un∣common Candor. The Question now is, Whether I ought not to stop here, and pre∣serve your favourable Opinion by my Silence, rather than hazard it by a farther Discovery of my Ignorance? The first is certainly most prudent, but the latter, being more just, I think it a Point of Honour to undeceive you, and dispel the false Charms of an imaginary Prospect. Your <HI>American</HI> Simile
<PB N="9" REF="279"/>
would have been proper enough for me, but I can by no Means allow you to make Use on't, neither can I admit of a Barter so exceedingly disadvantageous to my Cor∣respondent. No, Sir, I'll preserve your finish'd Poems as a Standard of good Verse, but I shall not pretend to traffic with you, because I never wrote any Thing that pleas'd myself; and surely if an Author can't satisfy her own Judgment, 'tis in vain to expect she should please others.</P>
<P>I hope you'll be contented with this Answer, because 'tis Truth; and I hope also, that if I should not send so quick a Return to your Letters, as you may expect, or as they deserve, you will not presently accuse me of Disrespect; for, what with the continued Weakness of my Grand∣mother, and the necessary Concerns of Life, I have so little Time at my own Disposal, that I dare not promise a constant Corre∣spondence, lest I should engage for more than I can perform. I conjure you, by your most beloved Muse, never more to call any Thing of mine <HI>excellent,</HI> since, in my Opinion, <HI>unmerited Praise</HI> is no better than <HI>civil Lampoon.</HI> I should pity your hard Fate in living among such <HI>unsociable Ani∣mals,</HI> did I not believe that a <HI>wise Man</HI> scorns to be beholden to <HI>Fortune</HI> for a pre∣carious Happiness; and that you are this
<PB N="10" REF="280"/>
Philosopher, I no more doubt, than that you imitate the <HI>Elder</HI> SCIPIO, and improve your <HI>Lucky Idleness.</HI> However, since you seem too Modest to own the Happiness you find in <HI>Solitude,</HI> and again think fit to de∣scend to Complaint, I will also confess, that I join in your just Resentments, (for I have had the same Account of the ill-natur'd <HI>Wintonians</HI> by another Hand) and am now sensible, that what I took for a <HI>Satire,</HI> was no more than a <HI>Character</HI> well <HI>drawn.</HI> But is it possible the Inhabitants should be all of a Piece? Is there no shining Exception, no generous Mind who has Fortitude enough to resist the malig∣nant Particles of its native Air? Yes, yes, you will confess, I know you will, that Mrs. <HI>Martland</HI> has Learning, Virtue, Wit, and good Humour, sufficient to atone for the Vices, Folly, and Ill-nature of a much larger City than <HI>Winchester.</HI> How then can you complain of <HI>Solitude?</HI> or how can you call that Place dull, where our <HI>English</HI> SAPHO resides? SAPHO was the Name Mr. CROMWELL chose for her, and not unde∣servedly, her excellent Verses requiring a nobler Epithet, if the Records of Time had afforded it. I know not whether you have the good Fortune to be acquainted with this incomparable Lady; if you are, and find a convenient Opportunity, I would
<PB N="11" REF="281"/>
intreat you to give her my best Respects, and to assure her that I have been many Years very ambitious of subscribing myself her unfeign'd Admirer. I have also ano∣ther Request, which is this, that you would send me the Title of that Book wherein is DURFY's Lampoon on Mr. DRYDEN's Marriage, or do me the Fa∣vour to transcribe it from your own Me∣mory.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INstead of convincing me that I have form'd a very unjust Idea of you, your last Letter has but the more confirm'd my Opinion of your Worth and Goodness: and tho' an Unwillingness of owning the shining Qualifications of your Mind, and the distinguishing Character of true Merit, has conjur'd me never to use the Word <HI>excellent</HI> for any thing of <HI>yours,</HI> yet I must and will say, that I never saw any of your Writings, but what deserv'd that <HI>Title;</HI> neither can I admit of your excusive Arguments for solid Reasons, why you should deny me the Advantage and Satisfaction of a <HI>Poetical Merchandise,</HI> but only take them to be a modest Refusal of my Offer, upon the Account of my Insufficiency to become your Correspondent in so precious a Com∣modity as <HI>Verse.</HI> Tho' I have been some∣what slow in answering your Letter, yet do not accuse me of Disrespect or Negli∣gence, since it is not design'd as a premedi∣tated Silence, for indeed I have been seiz'd with so severe a Fit of Melancholy, that for the Space of ten Days I have not had
<PB N="13" REF="283"/>
the Heart to apply my Mind to any thing but the unsociable Companions of an uneasy Being, Sorrow and Discontent; and how long it would have continu'd upon me, had not the prevailing Thoughts of Fair CORINNA rous'd me from that Lethargy of Temper, I cannot well determine. Stu∣pidity and Insipidness are the Epidemical Distempers of our Town; therefore it is no Wonder that my Spirits, naturally prone to Dullness, should so soon catch the reigning Contagion. LUCIUS FLORUS, in his <HI>History of the Second</HI> PUNIC WAR, gives us an Account, how HANNIBAL in his Nonage was sworn ROME's <HI>eternal Foe:</HI> In like manner, do I verily believe, that the <HI>Wintonians,</HI> in their Infancy, fretfully resolv'd to be everlasting Enemies to Mirth and Sense; for at the least Appearance of either, they start like wild Beasts at Fire-Arms, and raise all their Posse of Malice and Ill-nature to suppress whatever bears the Face of Wit or Diversion. Tho' I am a Stranger, Madam, to Mrs. <HI>Martland</HI>'s Perfections, yet since you are pleased to bestow so high an Elogy on her Learn∣ing, Virtue, Wit, and Good-humour, I believe her to be an extraordinary Lady, and on your Commendation, am very de∣sirous of her Acquaintance, but how to introduce myself to her is the Point; for
<PB N="14" REF="284"/>
you must know, that our <HI>Ladies</HI> here, like <HI>Snails,</HI> keep every one in their own <HI>Shell,</HI> and are wond'rous shy of Men Visitants. How far a Person of such fine Notions, and such an exalted Mind as the <HI>Elder</HI> SCIPIO was, might improve the Minutes of a solitary Retirement, I am not able to judge; but sure I am, that one of my slender Understanding, destitute of Books, and ingenious Conversation, can reap no other Advantage from a Country Life, than what DOMITIAN <HI>did from killing of Flies,</HI> passing away time in an idle Employment: Whatever Pleasures that renowned <HI>Hero</HI> found in Solitude, were certainly owing to his Choice; but my Retirement is only the Result of invincible Necessity, which gives a Tincture of Bitterness and Disgust to all the Pleasures of a rural Life.

<HEAD>THE Mosaic Creation.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first the starting Hours, with fleeting Pace,</L>
<L>O'er Time's eternal Plain began their Race:</L>
<L>The wise Creator with his Hands did rear,</L>
<L>The Fabric of this beauteous Theatre:</L>
<L>The wond'rous Frame of Heav'n and Earth arose</L>
<L>At his Command, and did their Forms disclose:</L>
<L>Th' expanded Earth was one continu'd Void,</L>
<L>'Till his creating Pow'r its Strength employ'd:</L>
<L>No Form the hudled Mass of nothing bore,</L>
<L>But gloomy Marks of wild Confusion wore,</L>
<L>Clouds of substantial Darkness to be felt,</L>
<L>On the brown Face of unshap'd Nature dwelt,</L>
<L>Th' Almighty's Spirit on the Waters play'd,</L>
<L>And all his heav'nly Energy betray'd.</L>
<L>Th' Eternal spake: Let smiling Light convey</L>
<L>Around th'Abyss an unaccustom'd Day.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="287"/>
Strait from the Region of tremendous Night,</L>
<L>Dawn'd forth, in ruddy Streaks, primaeval Light,</L>
<L>Its orient Beams e'en charm'd th' Almighty's Sight.</L>
<L>Then by his Pow'r a Separation made,</L>
<L>Between the lovely Light and beamless Shade;</L>
<L>The streaming Light, was call'd refulgent Day,</L>
<L>The Darkness Night, and sunk in Horror lay.</L>
<L>And when the Ev'ning and the Morn came round,</L>
<L>Thus far th' Almighty's <HI>First</HI> Day's Work was crown'd.</L>
<L>Again the God-head spoke: Let strait appear,</L>
<L>A Firmament amidst the Waters clear,</L>
<L>To part the Streams with an officious Care.</L>
<L>Soon a new model'd Firmament was seen</L>
<L>Divide the Waters, with its lucid Screen,</L>
<L>So in distinguish'd Channels calmly move,</L>
<L>Waters beneath the Sky, and those above:</L>
<L>Then by his Mouth the sacred Name of Heaven,</L>
<L>Was to the new-created <HI>Aether</HI> given.</L>
<L>And when the Ev'ning and the Morn came round,</L>
<L>The Labour of God's <HI>Second</HI> Day was crown'd.</L>
<L>Then from his Throne, thus said the Pow'r supreme,</L>
<L>Let all these Waters make one flowing Stream,</L>
<L>Which roll beneath the vast Aetherial Mold,</L>
<L>And let one Place their liquid Troops infold;</L>
<L>That the dry Land may shew its recent Head,</L>
<L>And with extended Force its Beauties spread.</L>
<L>No sooner spoke, but the dry Land appear'd,</L>
<L>And from the Deep, its barren Forehead rear'd;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="288"/>
The Name of Earth, th'unmeasur'd Land possess'd,</L>
<L>As that of Sea, the congregated Waves express'd;</L>
<L>The spacious Forms his Pow'rful Hands had made,</L>
<L>With secret Pleasure did his Mind invade:</L>
<L>Once more th'Eternal spoke: Let teeming Earth,</L>
<L>Disclose a sudden and prolific Birth;</L>
<L>Let grassy Burdens load the naked Plain,</L>
<L>And useful Herbs in verdant Triumph reign;</L>
<L>Let Fruit-Trees bearing Fruit, in Vigour grow,</L>
<L>Which on the Years their Product may bestow;</L>
<L>And let the pregnant Seeds of ev'ry Kind,</L>
<L>To every Herb, and every Tree assign'd:</L>
<L>With springing Grass, the Fields were cover'd o'er,</L>
<L>And Herbs, which in themselves, their Seedings bore;</L>
<L>In stately Rows the spreading Fruit-Trees stood,</L>
<L>Bearing their proper Seed, and God pronounc'd it good:</L>
<L>So when arriv'd the Ev'ning and the Morn,</L>
<L>Thus far his Work the <HI>Third</HI> Day did adorn.</L>
<L><HI>Jehovah</HI> said; let glorious Lights display</L>
<L>Their beamy Splendor round the heav'nly Way,</L>
<L>Which may distinguish Night from chearful Day;</L>
<L>Whilst in its Orb each shining Spark appears,</L>
<L>For Signs, for Seasons, and revolving Years.</L>
<L>When strait with Lights the Crystal Plain was spread,</L>
<L>That on the Earth their dazzling Lustre shed:</L>
<L>Two Lights immensely great, he form'd in haste,</L>
<L>Which in the Skies were to Advantage plac'd.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="289"/>
The greater Orb to rule the burning Day,</L>
<L>The less amidst the Shades of Night to stray,</L>
<L>And from the darken'd Space its Beams convey.</L>
<L>To these the Stars, with twinkling Lustre bright,</L>
<L>He added, to adorn the Face of Night:</L>
<L>High in the Azure Roof they took their Place,</L>
<L>With their fair Rays, this under World to grace;</L>
<L>So when the Godhead saw how all Things stood,</L>
<L>His awful Voice declar'd the Labour good:</L>
<L>And when the Ev'ning and the Morning clos'd,</L>
<L>The <HI>Fourth</HI> Day's Work in Order was compos'd.</L>
<L>Again th'Almighty spoke; Let now the watry Field,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd Shoals of moving Creatures yield,</L>
<L>With a vast Product of the feather'd Kind,</L>
<L>To fan, with various Wings, the buxom Wind.</L>
<L>Huge Whales he form'd, the Monsters of the Deep,</L>
<L>And Creatures which on Earth's low Surface creep,</L>
<L>With springing Fowls that wing the airy Steep:</L>
<L>Each in themselves their proper Kind contain'd,</L>
<L>That all was good his sacred Tongue explain'd:</L>
<L>Increase, and Multiply, the Maker said,</L>
<L>And o'er the Earth be fruitfully convey'd;</L>
<L>Full to the Brim the foaming Ocean lade,</L>
<L>And let the num'rous Fowl the Land invade:</L>
<L>So when the Ev'ning and the Morn roll'd on,</L>
<L>The <HI>Fifth</HI> Day's Labour was compleatly done.</L>
<L><HI>Jehovah</HI> said; Let th' obsequious Earth,</L>
<L>Produce a mingled instantancous Birth,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="290"/>
Of Cattle, creeping Forms, and Beasts of Prey,</L>
<L>And let their Seed be stor'd in the cemented Clay,</L>
<L>Lest moldring Time should wear the Kind away.</L>
<L>The furious Herds the shady Forest trace,</L>
<L>Low grov'ling Reptiles print the flow'ry Space,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Creature fill'd his proper Place.</L>
<L>Th' Eternal look'd, and saw 'twas wond'rous good,</L>
<L>'Cause all Things in a just Decorum stood:</L>
<L>Thus from his Seat th'Almighty did declare,</L>
<L>Let us make MAN, whose nobler Form may bear</L>
<L>Our heav'nly Image, and our Likeness wear:</L>
<L>And let the finny Race, and ev'ry Drove,</L>
<L>With Beasts that round the globous Ball shall rove,</L>
<L>And those whose Belly sweep the dusty plain,</L>
<L>Confess him Lord, and own his pow'rful Reign:</L>
<L>In his own Image God created Man,</L>
<L>As Male and Female join'd, his Hours began.</L>
<L>The Father Hand pour'd wond'rous Blessings round,</L>
<L>And with unmeasur'd Bounty they were crown'd.</L>
<L>Increase, be fruitful, and the Earth subdue,</L>
<L>The Maker said, this Pow'r is given to you.</L>
<L>Rule with unrival'd Sway the scaly Land,</L>
<L>Beast, Fishes, Birds, each living Thing command.</L>
<L>The Lord went on; Behold, to you I've given,</L>
<L>The Use of ev'ry Herb that's under Heaven;</L>
<L>And ev'ry Tree that beareth Fruit, for Food,</L>
<L>Pleasing to Life, and to the Palate good:</L>
<L>To ev'ry Beast that roams the Forest round,</L>

<P>I must confess, however, they have an Advantage which the others wants, they are pleas'd better cheap, and as they have less Delicacy, they find no Difficulties to their Satisfaction. For it is certainly a Misfor∣tune to have a Taste too refined for the Age one lives in, and to spin such Cobweb No∣tions of Excellence, as 'tis probable one may never find but in one's own Treasury of Ideas.</P>

<HEAD>THE SPEECH Of the Reverend FRANCIS ATTERBURY, D.D.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Day of his Admission to the Deanry of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> OXON. 1711<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Translated from the <HI>Latin</HI> Original. See VOL. II.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>OST Excellent Youth, this your Reception of me, in the Entrance of your Court, with your oblig∣ing Oration, is truly acceptable. I rejoyce not so much that I am, as that this House is adorned thereby; which has always been esteemed the Nur∣sery of ingenuous Education; and I am with Pleasure induced to believe, that your Cotemporaries are in all Things like your∣self: In which Expectation, if I am not deceived, you may with Confidence assure yourselves of such Incouragment and Re∣wards as I have Power to bestow.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="305"/>
Your Congratulation, select Batchelour, and that of your Society, is the more plea∣sing to me, for that it proceeds from those who are grown up to a Maturity of Judg∣ment, enlarged and perfected by the Pre∣cepts and Instructions of Philosophy, and other various Kinds of Learning. I wish I was altogether the Man, which I under∣stand from you, they take me to be. He I truly am, who with the utmost Satisfaction behold a Learned Body of young Men hap∣pily pressing after whatever is praise-worthy, and who cannot therefore but greatly en∣courage the growing Commendation of your House. I know I shall hear much concern∣ing your Love of the profound Sciences, the commendable Course of your Studies, and the Progress of your Learning, from that worthy Man the Sub-Dean of this House; whose Vigilance and Industry if I can any ways assist, he will find in me, when Occasion offers, an active Sharer of his Care and Counsel.</P>
<P>Most Eloquent Reader of Rhetoric, you indeed shew yourself well fitted to that your Province, which you have sustained for many Years with Reputation; when hav∣ing so slender a Subject to work upon, you dignify and enlarge it, with a plentiful Flow of Words, and all the forceful Charms of Eloquence. Both I myself am but too
<PB N="36" REF="306"/>
conscious, and you, notwithstanding the great Things you say of me, cannot be insensible how little I deserve these Com∣mendations; yet with what Ingenuity and Modesty do you treat me, when not judg∣ing it convenient to admonish me publick∣ly, you have Recourse to those Rules of your Art which say, That an Exhortation is then most effectual, when you extol him whom you mean to excite. If any there∣fore, led away by this Kind of Speech, should imagine that the Virtues recited are mine, great is his Mistake; it was designed to a different Intent, that whilst you thus discharged your own Duty, you might re∣mind me of mine; and your whole Endea∣vour was, that the Auditors of this Pane∣gyrick might understand not who I am, but what he ought to be that has the Ho∣nour to preside in this flourishing College; who being placed over so numerous a Body of those already Learned, and others yet a Learning, should be ever mindful to defend the Cause of Religion, cultivate good Man∣ners, and promote sound Literature; truly a very difficult Undertaking! however, you shew me the Way to make it easier, for even at this Instant, we cannot but remem∣ber those worthy Men my Predecessors in this Trust; from which Remembrance you readily hit upon all those Perfections re∣quired
<PB N="37" REF="307"/>
to compose a Picture, highly finished, of the Greatest Man, and the most Skilful Governor.</P>
<P>However, when I think of filling this Post, now fallen to my Lot, and consider my own Abilities, there arises a Dread and Diffidence sufficient to confound and over∣whelm me; nor am I ever so dispirited or out of love with myself, as when <HI>Fell</HI> and <HI>Aldrich,</HI> those two great Luminaries of your Commonwealth of Letters, present themselves to my Remembrance; for who has not Reason to dread treading in the Paths they trod, who (being endowed with the choicest Gifts of Nature, furnished with a great Variety of Arts, exercised in a long Tract of Academical Employments) brought this House, which ever had its Share of Glory, ever illustrious for its Praise of Learning, to the utmost Pitch of Splendor and Perfection.</P>
<P>Both of them were eagerly studious of Knowledge, and earnestly disposed to culti∣vate the liberal Sciences: Both of them were possessed with extraordinary Candour, so as to cherish every Appearance of Virtue that presented itself, ever interpreting fa∣vourably and to the milder Sense, whatever bore the Face of Doubt: Both of them were noble and generous, not carried away with the Thirst of Riches or of Honours:
<PB N="38" REF="308"/>
They were careless of their private Affairs, but vigilant for the Public Good: No Man ever loved his Family more ardently, or cherished it with more Affection, than both of them did this House: No Man's Country was ever dearer to him, than this University to them: By their own Labour, by their own Cost, to increase the Art of Printing, to repair, to rebuild these Walls; as it was always a Care to them, so was it a Pleasure: With these Thoughts, with these Desires were they employ'd when liv∣ing, nor was there any Intermission to the Hour of their Deaths. You are not un∣acquainted with the Things I speak of, which so lately were, and still are in your Sight and Hearing; but be they rivetted ever so strongly in your Minds, the Repeti∣tion of them will always be a Pleasure, and the Remembrance of them delightful, who excelled in every Qualification that could be in Man. The Image of that most humane Man can never be forgot by me or you, by whose Demise this House, as tho' it were deprived of a Parent, now lies in Mourning and in Sorrow: God grant that now, by my coming among you, it may in some measure be refreshed and comforted. To him nothing was wanting which indulgent Nature could bestow, either to the propa∣gating or Embellishment of Learning; no∣thing
<PB N="39" REF="309"/>
which could excite either the Love or Admiration of those over whom he presid∣ed: What Perspicuity, what Strength of Thought, what a ready Utterance was he endowed with, applying himself to different Kinds of Learning, with Ease and Quick∣ness! Never at a Loss, nor a Stranger to any Sort of Literature that was laid before him: Whatsoever he undertook in any Art, was performed to Exactness; so that one might say, he was alone born for that Part which he then sustained, and that all his Time and Labour had been imployed there∣in: Whether he followed more serious Studies, or delighted himself with those of less Consequence; whether he treated of divine or moral Subjects, you could not per∣ceive which he was more capable to per∣form, this or that: But then, in his Ad∣dress and Conversation, in his Recess and Business, how genteel was his Behaviour, how plain and open was his Mind! What Integrity in his Life, what Truth in his Words, what Modesty in his Countenance, what Gracefulness in his Front! Adorned with these Gifts of Nature, that which often seems morose and severe in abstrase Learning, he was wont to allay, with a wonderful Pleasantness; so that he could mould and form the Minds of young Be∣ginners, not barely by his Precepts and In∣structions,
<PB N="40" REF="310"/>
but by his Aspect and engaging Manner, to the Love of Learning and all the Praises of Humanity. In this Man were many Things admirable, many Things excellent, but nothing more so, than that he held the Memory of blessed <HI>Fell</HI> in singular Regard and Veneration, looking upon him, and declaring him to be the unerring Guide and Pattern of all his public Actions, the best Master for the Instruction and Govern∣ment of Youth, a Restorer of that Disci∣pline which was interrupted amongst us in the Times of Distraction; and, in a Word, the Guardian Establisher of this spacious Building: And, truly, ever since a Way was opened for the Return of true Religion and sound Learning to this Place, from whence it was driven. Whatsoever this House hath contributed to the Help of Science, or the Increase of Piety; whatsoever Benefit hath accrued from it to the Church or State, all flows from the Labour, Care, and Coun∣sels of that most holy Prelate: By him was laid the Foundation of our Praises; by him were sown the Seeds of Virtue, Industry and Learning, which even now flourish, and which from him, both living and dead, hath so often ripened into a plenteous and joyful Harvest.</P>
<P>As often, therefore, as I consider this Body still flourishing by the Instructions of
<PB N="41" REF="311"/>
<HI>Fell,</HI> methinks I see that well planted Field, which <HI>Cyrus</HI> formerly shewed <HI>Lysander,</HI> where, if I may say so, one might admire the Height, Ranks, and regular Disposi∣tion of Trees, the Ground cultivated, smooth and clean, with the sweet and flagrant Odor wafted from the Flowers, but above all, the Diligence and Industry of him by whom they were thus planted and de∣signed.</P>
<P>Happy that Husbandman of ours, who can truly say with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> All these have I thus disposed, mine is the Order, the De∣sign is mine; many of these Trees have I also planted with my own Hands, for the Benefit of this, and, perhaps, of the coming Generation. To me therefore, in the Dis∣charge of this Office (shall I say it was a Happiness or a Misfortune, immediately to succeed such eminent Men) what now re∣mains, but that I, who am diffident of my own Abilities, should rouse myself up by the Contemplation of those Virtues with which they excelled, and that those best of Masters whom I profitted by, when living, I should copy after when dead, and look on them as Examples to be followed in all Things according to my Ability.</P>
<P>They truly, by their excellent Endow∣ments obtained this, that they were singu∣larly serviceable to you, which I too well
<PB N="42" REF="312"/>
know I can never attain to. There is one Thing, however, which I boast to share in common with them. It is a certain un∣speakable Degree of Love and good Will, which I bear towards this House, by which I have at Heart, you and all your Interests. In this I trust never to be out-done by any of those my Ancestors, with some of whom, in nothing else am I worthy to be com∣pared.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS to the Gentleman's Character you intend to attack, I must desire to be excused, if I don't concern myself: He is dead, and has answered elswhere, and how far his Censures are just, I know not; he cannot now defend himself: <HI>De Mortuis nil, nisi bonum.</HI> As to the Gentle∣man to whom the MSS are left, I will not encourage you, or any Body, to apply to him. By the WILL, you'll find he has Directions from the Testator as to that Affair, and he is a Man of too nice Ho∣nour not to strictly adhere to them; so that all manner of Application, there, will be ineffectual.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Mr. <HI>Thomas Hearne.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT He, may never be forgotten, who has raked the Repositaries of Antiqui∣ty, and been indefatigable in fetching Learning from Places where many would not have sought after it; a few Memorials of his Life, and some Observations on his Writings, will, we hope, redound to his Credit.</P>
<P>In the Parish-Register of <HI>Abbots,</HI> or <HI>White-Waltham,</HI> a Village about six Miles
<PB N="2" REF="323"/>
distant from <HI>Windsor,</HI> it stands upon Re∣cord that he was baptized by the Name of <HI>Thomas,</HI> Son of <HI>George Hearne</HI> and <HI>Edith</HI> his Wife on the Eleventh of <HI>June,</HI> 1678. His Father, we have been in∣formed, was a considerable Antiquary of the lower Class; and was Sacristan of that Parochial Church to the Day of his Death. So that Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> in all pro∣bability, received his great Propensity to the Study of Antiquity as it were <HI>ex Traduce.</HI></P>
<P>It is agreed on all Hands that his early Inclination to Letters first discovered it∣self among the <HI>Tumuli</HI> of his own Parish Church-yard; over which he was observed to be continually plodding lmost as soon as he was Master of the English Alphabet. To this soon after adding a little Wri∣ting, he grew impatient after Antiquity: resolved never to be unprepared for col∣lecting Materials that might be service∣able hereafter, and accordingly stuffed his Diary (which was his constant Compa∣nion) with every Occurrence worthy his Notice. This he prudently foresaw would turn to a good Account in his more ad∣vanced Years; Vacancies in his future Labours might be supplied with a Story from his Journal; and tho' it might not
<PB N="3" REF="324"/>
be very methodical, or perhaps not at all to his Purpose in Hand, yet the Design of preserving it might sufficiently justify its Publication.</P>
<P>This was the advantageous Method he pursued all his Life Time: He co∣pied <HI>Monuments</HI> and <HI>Inscriptions; Original Letters</HI> and <HI>venerable Ballads of Antiquity;</HI> Stories of honest <HI>John Ross</HI> and <HI>Peter Langtoft; Robert</HI> of <HI>Brune</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas Cantilupe:</HI> Men! who had not Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> lived, might have lain for ever buried in an ignoble Obscurity. The Preservation of these Things may be ascribed to his <HI>Col∣lectanea</HI> which are now swelled to a pro∣digious Size.</P>
<P>It is difficult indeed to determine to what particular Number these MSS Vo∣lumes are now grown, because they are kept with as strict and sacred a Care from the Eyes of Mankind as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>'s Account of these choice <HI>Leaves</HI> in the 485 page of Vol. 2. of his <HI>Connection:</HI> where we find that none but the Keepers of them were ever suffered to pe∣ruse them, and They only upon particular Exigencies.</NOTE> Oracles of the <HI>Sibylls</HI> deposited in the Capitol. The highest Number we have yet seen quoted by himself is cxxiii, in his Preface to the
<PB N="4" REF="325"/>
 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 29.</NOTE> Annals of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Trokelowe.</HI> So that notwithstanding there can be no certain Calculation made of an exact Number, yet there is some room for a Conjecture that they are not fewer than five Hun∣dred.</P>
<P>Several Passages there are in his <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Rob. de Glouc.</HI> Vol. 2. p. 638.</BIBL></NOTE>XCV Volume which enough convince us of his not being then arrived at Years of Discre∣tion, notwithstanding he had filled so ma∣ny of them: If therefore his Industry was as great in his advanced Years as in his Youth (which we believe all will allow when they consider the uninterrupted State of Health he all along enjoyed) we think we may be allowed not to have ex∣ceeded the Number, but rather to have fallen short of it. This however we only took Notice of to shew what an <HI>inestima∣ble</HI> Loss the World must sustain, should this <HI>prodigious</HI> Treasure perish with its <HI>Collector.</HI></P>
<P>This Digression we hope the Reader will pardon; and so, without dwelling on the first eight or ten Years of his Life, we shall follow him to the School, where we
<PB N="5" REF="326"/>
are told he laid the Foundation of his fu∣ture Greatness.</P>
<P>It was happy for him as well as the <HI>World</HI> that he fell into the Hands of a good <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Gibson, <HI>Author of the excellent</HI> Grammatical Exceptions against the late Alterations made in the common Ac∣cidence and Grammar.</NOTE>Master at <HI>Bray</HI> School: it being a ma∣lancholly Thing to consider how many great Genii have either been cramped or utterly spoiled thro' the Ignorance or In∣dolence of trifling Pedagogues. Here he soon mastered the Rudiments of Learning, and by a gradual but speedy Progress be∣came acquainted with the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek Historians.</HI></P>
<P>Thus encouraged by the Pregnancy of his <HI>Parts,</HI> his assiduous Industry and Profici∣ency in School Learning, his liberal Friend <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Cherry</HI> of <HI>Shettesbroke, Berks.</HI> This Gentleman paid for Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Education, which he has gratefully acknowledged.</NOTE>thought them sufficient Motives to the Continuance of his Bounty, and sent him accordingly in the Year MDCXCV (with a considerable Addition) to the University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> Fortune here again (if we are rightly informed) seemed particularly fond
<PB N="6" REF="327"/>
of him: The Vicar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>White Kennet,</HI> M.A. afterwards Bp. of <HI>Peterborough.</HI></NOTE> of the Parish where his Benefactor lived was at that Time a considerable Tutor in <HI>Edmund Hall,</HI> and in the Study of Antiquity most eminently remarkable. Thro' this Gen∣tleman's Means he was admitted into this Place, and used more like a Son than barely a Pupil by him.</P>
<P>A few Years being spent in Academical Learning, by the Help of which he had improved his Propensity to Antiquity; He gave the World a Specimen of his fu∣ture Designs. In the Year MDCCII (but se∣ven Years from his Matriculation) he pub∣lished a copious Index of the principal Passages in Sir <HI>Roger L'Estrange</HI>'s Tran∣slation of <HI>Josephus;</HI> which seems to have met with so good a Reception, that the same was reprinted not long after in an Octavo Edition. In MDCCIII he obliged the World with (or at least occasioned the Publication of) the <HI>Reliquiae Bodleianae,</HI> or some genuine Remains of Sir <HI>Thomas Bod∣ley,</HI> adding the same Year, to his other La∣bours. <HI>Pliny</HI>'s <HI>Epistles</HI> and <HI>Panegyric,</HI> with various Lections and Annotations; not to mention his Edition of <HI>Eutropius,</HI> with
<PB N="7" REF="328"/>
many other Things published all in this Year. In MDCCIV and V came out that laborious Work called <HI>Doctor Historious,</HI> in two Volumes, 8<HI>vo,</HI> being a short Sy∣stem of Universal History, and an Intro∣duction to the Study of it.</P>
<P>It would be almost endless to expatiate particularly on his Labours, or to give an Account of the Product of every Year; for which Reason we must refer the Reader to his own printed Catalogue of them, inserted at the End of every Book, he published, since they became numerous.</P>
<P>During this Period however it is obser∣vable that his <HI>Vindication</HI> of Those who take the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> was writ∣ten, which loudly speaks in the Behalf of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Industry, and shews the early Application he had made to Books. The many just Quotations in it from sa∣cred History as well as Profane, from Acts of Parliament and Lawyers of the greatest Name, we flatter ourselves will ex∣cuse our writing a Panegyrick, and its Author's Name recommend it enough to the Perusal of Mankind.</P>
<P>In MDCCIII, on the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> he took the Degree of Master of Arts, and had
<PB N="8" REF="329"/>
no sooner compleated it, but the Eyes of the whole University were upon him: His Industry was almost become a Proverb, and (notwithstanding a little Surliness of Temper which it is thought he brought into the World with him, and which pro∣bably increased with his severe Studies) he met with Friendship in a great many, and much Respect from all Men,</P>
<P>I should have mentioned indeed before this, the Encouragement he had from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Hudson</HI> Principal of St. <HI>Mary-Hall.</HI></NOTE>Head Librarian, who (acquainted with his Diligence) made him Underkeeper of the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library. There he had Room enough for his Inquisitive Genius to range in; of which he made so good a Use, that the Product of every Year afterwards may justly be ascribed to the Acquisitions he had made in this Treasure of Learning.</P>
<P>After some Years spent in this Way, of printing <HI>Indexes, Itineraries</HI> and <HI>Collectanea,</HI> his Labours met with an additional Re∣ward; being on the 19th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1714-15, elected <HI>Architypographus</HI> of the University and superior <HI>Beadle</HI> of Civil Law <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Leland. Collect.</HI> Vol. 1. p. 56.</BIBL></NOTE> This we find him acknowledging with Pleasure and Humility to be an Honour, which
<PB N="9" REF="330"/>
he took the first <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Opportunity of menti∣oning to the World, on purpose that his Gratitude might be made known to Posterity. And notwithstanding he was conscious to himself that the University Favours were conferred upon One who every way undeserved them, in respect of Learning, and other requisite Quali∣fications, yet still he had very good Reason for accepting them upon this Account amongst others, as they sea∣sonably assisted and relieved one of their Members who had for many Years led an obscure and retired Life, and was at that Time reduced to a necessitous Con∣dition thro' the great Expence he had been at in carrying on many public Designs.'</Q></P>
<P>In this happy Posture of Affairs one would have imagined he might have been easy and satisfied: But neither Friendship nor Preferment could put a Stop to his Enquiry after <HI>Truth.</HI> Soon after this Pro∣motion he acquired better Reasons (to <HI>Himself</HI> at least) for Non-Compliance with the Oaths which were necessary for <HI>keeping</HI> it, than he had before for the <HI>Acceptance</HI> of it; and accordingly resigned that ad∣vantageous Post, which the University had so lately consered on him, as incon∣sistent
<PB N="10" REF="331"/>
with his <HI>Conscience,</HI> or at least, his Manner of <HI>Thinking.</HI></P>
<P>Ever since he steadily adhered to the Principles of a Non-juror; spent his Time in annually obliging the World with some∣thing relating to the History of <HI>England,</HI> or with some other Affairs as they accidental∣ly have fallen in his Way, both for the Be∣nefit and Pleasure of Mankind. Here we think he might have been left still labour∣ing at the Oar, deserving the Favour and Compliments of the Learned upon his yearly Revival of something (as it were) lost to every one but himself. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acta Eruditorum Anno 1729. p. 182.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Singulis fe∣re Annis Cl.</HI> Hearnius <HI>aliquid e MSS. eruere quod ad Historiam Anglicanum spectat, idque</HI> Praefationibus <HI>ac</HI> Appendicibus pro∣lixis saepe longe aliena complexis <HI>sive ornare sive</HI> onerare.—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Ed.

<P>Amongst many Qualities remarkable in him, his strict and unshaken <HI>Integrity</HI> is none of the least. No Regard for any one's Merit could ever prevail with him to con∣nive at their Errors: He chose rather to break off the strictest Friendship, than to be led aside by it in his Search after <HI>Truth;</HI> Nay his very <HI>Gratitude,</HI> when it interfered with his <HI>Integrity,</HI> was at once renounced as no longer binding. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Leland.

<P>There is one Thing indeed relating to <HI>University</HI> College (to which Society he <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Leland. Itin.</HI> p. 7, 8.</BIBL></NOTE> declares himselfe indebted) which it
<PB N="12" REF="333"/>
would really be a Fault in us not to take Notice of, because we are positive his <HI>Ve∣ritatis Amor</HI> can never be reconciled with it.</P>
<P>During the late unhappy Contest in that House, occasioned by the Death of Dr. <HI>Charlett,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> published <HI>Peter Langtoft</HI>'s Chronicle; at the End of the Se∣cond Volume of which, he adds a Glossary upon English Words. Upon the Word <HI>Writ</HI> he has it thus: We commonly understand by <HI>Writ</HI> (the same with the Latin <HI>Breve</HI>) a written Order or Precept from the King or Court of Judicature, by which any thing is commanded to be done relating to Suit or Action.</P>
<P>Had he left off here he had done very well: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rob. de Avesbury Praef. <HI>p.</HI> 1.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Sed ad Agendum Nati sumus</HI> are his own Words; upon which Principle we suppose he proceeded in this Place. Of this kind (he tells us) is that remarkable one relating to <HI>University</HI> College of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, with his Seal an∣nexed, which he just saw and hastily run over.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="334"/>
Whether he ever saw this Instrument we shall not scruple at present, but whether there is any Seal to it, or has been, within the Compass of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Years, we leave to the Enquiries of the <HI>Fellows</HI> of that Society.</P>
<P>The same he tells us was done after∣wards expresly by King <HI>Henry</HI> VI, in a Writing quoted from the Muniments of the same College by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>B. Twyne Apolog. Antiq. Acad. Oxon. <HI>p.</HI> 198.</BIBL></NOTE>Mr. <HI>Twyne.</HI> The thing will appear best to the Reader if we produce the Passage printed by Mr. <HI>Twyne,</HI> and the Translation of it by Mr. <HI>Hearne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nam cum Temporibus</HI> Henrici Sexti <HI>inter</HI> Guilielmum Abbatem <HI>de Osney, &amp;</HI> Ri∣chardum Witton <HI>illius Collegii Magistrum esset Controversia,</HI> &amp;c. And then follows the Instrument itself, which is only a com∣mon Form in the Case of a Law-Suit drawn by some Attorney, which Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> without the least Authority what∣ever, makes to be one of these <HI>Writs</HI> or Precepts from the King or Court of Judi∣cature relating to the depending Suit be∣tween the <HI>Abbot of Osney</HI> and <HI>Richard Whitton</HI> then Master of the College.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="335"/>
How he came to translate <HI>Temporibus Hen.</HI> VI<HI>ti,</HI> by the <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, looks more like <HI>Design</HI> than <HI>Blunder;</HI> tho' we would not suggest that he had any Intent of giving a Turn to a Cause then depending in some Measure upon such Instruments as he would have made this.</P>
<P>The Annals of this College lately pub∣lished by Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> we find gave our An∣tiquary some Distaste; but upon what Bot∣tom this Anger is raised, a little Enquiry (if the Reader will permit) will soon dis∣cover.</P>
<P>In his Preface to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Sprott. Pref. <HI>p.</HI> 27.</BIBL></NOTE> Dr. <HI>Sprott</HI> we find this Gentleman a very great Favourite of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s; whose Character there gi∣ven is <HI>Vir per-eruditus &amp; benevolus:</HI> But we are afraid his Temper grew four and morose as he advanced in Years. In his Preface to the Life of <HI>Richard</HI> II, we have another Account of Mr. <HI>Smith: viz. Scriptor ille</HI> ferreus <HI>atque mendax</HI> Guli∣elmus Faber <HI>de</HI> Joh. Rosso <HI>tam maligne pas∣sim locutus est.—Haec in Gratiam</HI> Guli∣elmi Fabri <HI>Ecclesiae Anglicanae (quod vix</HI>

<P>We cannot but observe here, that Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Age is made a part of his bad Character; when old Age, by some more sacred Writers than Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> is thought <HI>honourable</HI> rather than <HI>scandalous.</HI> Ma∣ny other Sentences there are in this Pre∣face, which abound with the same sort of Language of this Reverend old Gentle∣man, which the <HI>Veritatis Amor</HI> can never justify.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Life of Rich.</HI> 2. Pref. p. 19.</BIBL></NOTE>One Passage there is respecting <HI>Sprott</HI> (whose Authority we own we have some Reason to scruple) which proves, that Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> had either not kept up to his avowed Regard for <HI>Truth,</HI> or else had unhappily blundered in a Point of Chro∣nology, tho' he abused Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> for it in the very same Case. His Words are these: Sprottus <HI>floruit An. Dom.</HI> 1274, <HI>longe ni∣mirum citius quam exoptat</HI> Guil. Faber,
<PB N="16" REF="337"/>
<HI>qui</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>immemor, audectar falso∣que retulit,</HI> Ranulphum Higdenum <HI>primum omnium fuisse qui de</HI> Scholis Aluredianis <HI>aliquid tradidit,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is observable here, in the fifth place, that <HI>Sprott</HI> lived (according to Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s own Confession) in 1274, which was in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First; that he Studied <HI>in ea parte Aedis Christi quam vulgo vocant Quadrangulum Cantuari∣ense,</HI> and that he wrote of <HI>Canterbury College,</HI> and left a Book behind him con∣cerning it, is evident from the above-cited Preface to <HI>Sprott</HI>'s <HI>Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P>This is a very surprising <HI>Canterbury</HI> Tale indeed; and that would make <HI>Sprott</HI> (provided it could be proved) more Famous than the <HI>Samian</HI> Philosopher, who, by the Help of Transmigration, passed thro' two or three Successive Stages of Generation, but never under the same Name.</P>
<P><HI>Sprott,</HI> who lived in 1274, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, studied in <HI>Canterbury College,</HI> which was not built till 1363, and therefore agreeable to this Account, must either have lived about 89 Years before he was born, or at least written
<PB N="17" REF="338"/>
of a Place as many Years before it was built.</P>
<P>This Mistake we would have accounted for in our Author's Behalf, had it been in our Power; but as it was not, we left it to himself, who was better qualified to reconcile Difficulties of this Nature.</P>
<P>Another Slip of this kind appears in Page 302 of his Collection of <HI>Curious Discourses. Academia</HI> (says he) <HI>scripsit</HI> Guilielmo Wykham <HI>Episcopo</HI> Winton: <HI>ut il∣lis accommodaret Machinas, quarum Ope</HI> Scholam Theologicam <HI>Voltis &amp; Fornicibus exornarent.</HI> It is very well known that the <HI>Divinity School</HI> (for which this Loan was desired) was built in the Year 1476, by <HI>Tho. Kempe</HI> Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> This Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> allows in the Page preceding the Place before cited. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Le Neve. <HI>p.</HI> 286.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wikham</HI> Bp. of <HI>Winton</HI> died the 27th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1404. so that, according to this As∣sertion, the University sent to him <HI>ut illis accommodaret Machinas,</HI> &amp;c. 60 Years after his Death. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rymer Foed. <HI>Vol.</HI> 8. <HI>p.</HI> 392.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>Rymer</HI> in his <HI>Foedera</HI> tells us, that <HI>Hen. Beaufort</HI> Bp. of <HI>Winton</HI> died the 3d Id. of <HI>April</HI> 1447. and was succeed∣ed by <HI>William Waynflete,</HI> who lived in
<PB N="18" REF="339"/>
Possession of the same till 1486. So that if for <HI>Wikham</HI> we read <HI>Waynflete,</HI> as the Person petitioned to by the University, we shall come within the Time of building the <HI>Divinity School,</HI> and set Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> right in his Chronology. This we believe was an Alteration of no Design, but only a simple, thoughtless Blunder. Mistakes of this sort we shall conclude with an As∣sertion of his relating to <HI>University College,</HI> where he makes <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Durham</HI> to have studied in the <HI>Great Hall,</HI> which was not bought for the Use of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Durham</HI>'s Scholars till 124 Years after his Death.</P>
<P>As for the Censure passed upon Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in the Passage above-cited (which really is too severe without better Grounds for it) we may venture to say it is Unjustifi∣able. For supposing that <HI>Sprott</HI>'s Book was written before <HI>Higden</HI>'s, yet still Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> (who had never seen or heard of it till he had finished his <HI>Annals</HI>) might un∣doubtedly say, and consistent with Truth too, that <HI>Ralph Higden</HI> was the first he ever had met with quoted as a Friend to the weak Cause of K. <HI>Alfred</HI>'s Halls, and who seemed first to have introduced this Novelty into the World.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="340"/>
Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> therefore in the former Case seems to deserve the Sentence of be∣ing <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>immemor;</HI> and int he lat∣ter to be very Ungenteel, to make no worse of it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Leland.

<P>Whilst we are thus impartially consider∣ing our Antiquary's Character, by setting him right in his Mistakes, as well as com∣mending his Virtues, one thing occurs which we should have been glad never to have had the Opportunity of correcting. About twenty Years before the Publica∣tion of the Life of <HI>Richard</HI> II (which was wrote by one of the Monks of <HI>Eve∣sham,</HI> our Author, in his <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Leland.

What he has said upon these Points he hoped no <HI>Ingenuous</HI> or <HI>Impartial</HI> Person will think <HI>Uncharitalle</HI> or <HI>Unbecoming.</HI></Q> </P>
<P>These are sounding Words, and express a great deal of Loyalty to the Memory of those Princes. But such fickle Things are our <HI>Memories,</HI> that sometimes they seem to take Pleasure in exposing us. Hence doubtless it was that Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> lately run counter to his own above-cited Declarations. It must be Forgetsulness (we hope so at least) that will suffer a Man to draw his own Character in an infamous I Light; and whether he has not done it to the Life, let the <HI>Reader</HI> judge when he has heard the Accusation, and is referred to the Place where he may soon inform himself.</P>
<P>At the latter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 405</NOTE> End of the Life of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d, there is a <HI>Letter</HI> printed and Mr. (<HI>Hearne</HI> says an <HI>Original</HI> one) of
<PB N="2" REF="342"/>
<HI>Charles</HI> the First when Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> It is directed to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and interpreted by the <HI>Publisher</HI> of it, as carrying on an Affair of Gallantry. Be the Letter what it will, <HI>Original</HI> or not, He ought to have given a better Reason for making it publick. He was apprehen∣sive (he tells us) that if such a <HI>Letter</HI> should be stifled, some Persons might interpret it an Instance of Partiality, and be apt to make base Reflections upon it. Let us ex∣amine this kind of Reasoning a little. The stifling this <HI>Letter</HI> would have been thought an <HI>Instance</HI> of <HI>Partiality;</HI> The Reason of which must be this; Because Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> was necessarily obliged to pub∣lish every Thing he met with. And then, he says, that some Persons would be apt to make base Reflections on it: On the <HI>Letter</HI> we snppose, which if stifled, they might never see or hear of: Or if he meant those Gentlemen who communi∣cated it to him, he again forgot his <HI>Ve∣ritatis Amor,</HI> because they never intended it should be printed. That it might escape therefore all <HI>Censure</HI> he published it in a heap of <HI>Appendixes</HI> and <HI>Curae secvndae,</HI> and made it a hundred Times more easy for base Reflections to be cast on it than it was before.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="343"/>
This is the <HI>Reason</HI> given for publishing this <HI>Letter.</HI> In the next Book printed by him, which was <HI>Trokelowe</HI>'s Annals of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d) we have an Apology in his Preface for the very same Thing. The <HI>Letter</HI> became the Subject of almost every one's Discourse, and a Reflection cast up∣on a Prince, remarkable for his <HI>uncommon Chastity,</HI> could not but be taken Notice of by many of his Friends. Whether it had like to have discontinued any of his Subscriptions, or whether he had more maturely considered the Matter, we cannot say; this however is plain, that his <HI>Apo∣logy</HI> was designed to give a softer Turn, than was hinted in his <HI>Explanation</HI> of the <HI>Let∣ter;</HI> and that he had rather have it thought, that the <HI>Prince</HI> was unwarily <HI>misled,</HI> than <HI>inclined</HI> to this Gallantry.</P>
<P>It had been more <HI>prudent</HI> (and we may add less <HI>officious</HI>) in Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> whilst he was thus endeavouring to clear himself, to have first got leave for the Printing this Letter from the <HI>Gentleman</HI> who shewed it him, and who, we are informed since, so highly resents it, that he broke off a Friendship with him, which had been kept very strict for many Years. We must subjoin by the way, that it is certainly a greater Instance of <HI>Partiality</HI> to publish a
<PB N="23" REF="344"/>
<HI>Letter</HI> as an <HI>Original,</HI> which the Editor could not at that Time, nor afterwards, prove to be so.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apology</HI> will appear, upon a little Consideration, not at all inferior to his <HI>Reason</HI> for printing it; especially if we observe, that tho' he did not know what the <HI>Intrigue</HI> was, yet he happily conjec∣tured, by making the <HI>Prince</HI> to be inticed like <HI>Joseph</HI> by the Importunity of a lewd Mistress; tho' we do not remember that <HI>Joseph</HI> ever wrote to a third Person about his Affair. Nay, it may be remarked farther, that Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> makes the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Blunder reached our Author's Ears, and in his Preface to <HI>Tho. Caius</HI> stands corrected, th with some Re∣luctance. For he says it signifies nothing whether it was <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s or <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Wife.</NOTE> Wife of <HI>Pharoah</HI> the <HI>importunate</HI> Woman, when the Scriptures assure us, it was <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Spouse that was so deeply smit∣ten with the Comeliness of the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> But a Man may possibly forget his <HI>Bible,</HI> who is so very much taken up with <HI>Adam</HI> de <HI>Domerham,</HI> and the <HI>black Book</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Had this unfortunate <HI>Prince</HI> lived some hundred Years before he did, Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Love for <HI>Antiquity</HI> might probably have
<PB N="24" REF="345"/>
engaged him in his <HI>Defence</HI> rather than in <HI>exposing</HI> him. We find him, in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 77.</NOTE> Ap∣pendix to <HI>Leland</HI>'s <HI>Collectanea,</HI> very angry with <HI>Tyrrel</HI> the Historian for staining the Reputation of <HI>Ethelred</HI> and his first <HI>Queen:</HI> There he says <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it is a great Crime to scan∣dalize any Person; the Heinousness of it increases according to the Dignity of the Person, of whom the Scandal is raised: But this <HI>(says he)</HI> may be wiped off by a public <HI>Retraction.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>This was good Doctrine, had not a Preface to <HI>Canden</HI>'s Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> shewed, that Men do not always practise as they advise: But a public Retracta∣tion which (from the ingenuousness of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Dposition) we had Reason to think he would make, might wipe off the Blemish he may have contracted, either in the Case of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> or the inde∣cent Language given Mr. <HI>Smith.</HI> His Pretence to <HI>strict Integrity,</HI> we were almost confident, would prevail with him to do it, in a better Manner than disguising it in a trifling <HI>Apology;</HI> and as he was a strict En∣quirer after <HI>Truth,</HI> and is, by this Time, convinced it was wrong to publish the <HI>Letter,</HI> or abuse the aged <HI>Divine,</HI> we do not
<PB N="25" REF="346"/>
doubt but that he retracted what he had said in both Cases, and frustrated the Ex∣pectations of some People who thought he delighted in <HI>Abuse,</HI> tho' we hope he acowledged our <HI>Friendship</HI> in setting him right.</P>
<P>Thus have we considered one of his ex∣cellent Qualities; the next is his <HI>Fidelity</HI> as an <HI>Editor.</HI></P>
<P>One Rule which we have been informed he at first laid down, and generally speak∣ing closely observed, was always to fol∣low his Authors religiously. Their Mis∣takes by this means were punctually copied and sacredly preserved: Nay, the very Blunders of Transcribers were faith∣fully penned down for the Amusement of Posterity. <HI>Prurigo emendandi ac com∣mutandi a Nobis plane absit,</HI> are his own Words in the Notes after the Appendix of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Trokelowe</HI>'s Annals of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second. And again in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Leland. Itin. <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 15.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Leland</HI>'s <HI>Itinerary</HI> he declares, that he was so nice in this Affair, that <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I observed <HI>(says he)</HI> Mr. <HI>Leland</HI>'s Way of Spelling, and o∣mitted nothing, not so much as the As∣terisks, and other Notes of that Nature
<PB N="26" REF="347"/>
which had been inserted by him: Nor did we leave out even those Words that are plainly <HI>redundant,</HI> nor pretend to alter those which are manifestly <HI>wrong,</HI> and occasioned by the Haste the Author was in, or else by the Defect of his Memory.'</Q></P>
<P>This Method is very observable through∣out the numerous Volumes he has obliged the World with. <HI>Sic MS.</HI> he has noted perhaps in the <HI>Margin</HI> to shew that he was not ignorant of the Error in the <HI>Copy. Delenda sunt ut opinor</HI> may possibly be seen at the Bottom of one Page, and <HI>lege,</HI> &amp;c. at another. Here perhaps may be a <HI>Desunt,</HI> &amp;c. and there a <HI>Subintellige,</HI> &amp;c. But still amidst all these Regulations, the Text is generally kept <HI>purely corrupt,</HI> and scarce a Blunder thro' the whole, but what is very industriously preserved. Nay, so great a Regard had he for the old Way of Spelling, that the following <HI>Epistle</HI> (which we have printed as like the Original as pos∣sibly we could) is a standing Proof of it.</P>
<P>There are indeed a few Cases in which he has varied from this Rule, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>History of <HI>Rich.</HI> II. p. 404. <HI>Cur. Sec.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> which might have been concealed, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>had we not been apprehensive</HI> (to use his own Words
<PB N="27" REF="348"/>
in another Case) <HI>that some Persons,</HI> if such Slips should be stifled, <HI>might have interpreted it a great Instance of Parti∣ality, and made base Reflections upon it.</HI>'</Q> One of this Nature we must not pass by, lest his Character should prevail (as probably it might) with some Men here∣after to establish his <HI>Errors</HI> for <HI>Truths.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Hutton,</HI> Student of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> about the Year 1574.</NOTE>Dr. <HI>Leonard Hutton,</HI> in his Anti∣quities of <HI>Oxford,</HI> has quoted a Line from <HI>Shepreve's</HI> Life of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Claymond</HI> President of <HI>Corpus.</HI></NOTE>Dr. <HI>Claymond,</HI> con∣cerning a <HI>Shed</HI> which formerly stood in the <HI>Corn-Market,</HI> built to skreen the Corn from the Weather.

<P>In this Verse there appears a palpable Error, which a Reader of no extraordi∣nary Capacity might have discovered and corrected. But see the Misfortune of not following an old Rule.

<P>Whether this Mistake arose from his not having an Ear for the <HI>Monkish Music,</HI> an Error of the like Nature may serve to determine.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Antiq. Glaston. <HI>p.</HI> 337.</BIBL></NOTE>In the Catalogue of his Works, an∣nexed to the History of <HI>Glastonbury,</HI> he has published an Inscription in the fol∣lowing manner, now to be seen in the Remains of <HI>Rewly.</HI> <Q><L>ELE LONGESPE COMITISSE DE</L>

Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> saw this intire; but afterwards it was broken, and unskilfully placed in a Wall of one of the lower Rooms of <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A Monastery adjoining <HI>Oxon.</HI></NOTE><HI>Rewly,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> says he has
<PB N="29" REF="350"/>
often seen it, and that it is very legible. In this ancient Inscription we find there is a <HI>Jingle</HI> too; and had it been so legible as he declares it was when he saw it, we are surprised that <HI>He,</HI> of all Men, would be so inaccurate a Copyer a Trade he fol∣lowed all his Life) as to transpose one Word and add another, instead of tak∣ing it as it really is,
<Q><L>ELE DE WERWICK</L>
<L>COMITISSE VISCERA SUNT HIC.</L></Q>
The Word <HI>Longespe,</HI> inserted in his Ac∣count of it, is not upon the Stone, how legible soever he asserted it to be; and the Spelling of <HI>Werwick</HI> quite altered by him, without the least Authority whatever but his own.</P>
<P>This Blunder may in some Measure be accounted for in this Manner.—There is now in the <HI>Anatomy School</HI> (which was formerly under the Care of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>) a Stone found at <HI>Rewly,</HI> (probably the Foundation-Stone of a Chapel there) bear∣ing this Inscription—ELE LONGESP COMIT: WAREW: HANC CAPELLAM FECIT: This no doubt had often been perused by our <HI>Antiquary,</HI> as well as the other before mentioned; and perhaps the
<PB N="30" REF="351"/>
trusting too much to Memory, might raise a confused Notion of both Inscrip∣tions, and corrupt the <HI>Monkish Jingle</HI> in the former Case.</P>
<P>These few Mistakes then having taken their Rise from not sticking closely to his <HI>Copy:</HI> we shall take Notice of but One more, which was occasioned by following it too closely; and it may be seen in his Edition of that valuable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. Latino Graec. <HI>Fol.</HI> 38.</NOTE>MS. which is said to have belonged formerly to Venerable <HI>Bede.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be observed in the first Place, that this MS. is in very old Capital Letters, and each Page divided into two Co∣lumns: The first contains the <HI>Latin,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> is wrote collaterally in the other. Thro' the <HI>Oscitancy</HI> of the Scribe, the <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence is frequently carried be∣yond the Bounds of its own Column, by which means it becomes intermixed with the <HI>Greek.</HI> The Text as he has printed it stands thus: <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L>MIRARI COEPERVNT ΕΘΑΥΜΑΖΟΝ</L>
<L>ET CONFVNDEBANTVR ΜΕΝΤΕΚΑΙΔΙ*EEgr;ΠΟΡΟΥΝ</L></Q>
At the Bottom of his Page (not contented
<PB N="31" REF="352"/>
with Dr. <HI>Mills</HI>'s <HI>Reading.</HI>) he adds <HI>sic plane in Codice nostro non</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>ut a∣pud Millium;</HI> tho' it will appear beyond all Dispute upon any one's Enquiry, that the Doctor was not in the least to be blamed. For, as we observed before, thro' the Care∣lessness of the Scribe, the Latin Line be¦ing carried beyond its due Bounds into the Greek Column, and the Words MENTE and MEN TE consisting of five Capital Let∣ters, just the same in both Languages, un∣happily led Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> into this Mistake. So that by defalcating one Word from the Latin, and converting it into two Greek ones of no Signification at all, he spoiled the Sense of the one, and made the other quite superfluous.—But some Faults sure are pardonable in so <HI>voluminous</HI> a Writer.</P>
<P>To be particular in shewing his Talent at <HI>Reasoning</HI> would, we fear, be making too free with our <HI>Reader</HI>'s Time: We might quote three Parts of his Discourse on the <HI>Stunsfield Pavement,</HI> had not Mr. <HI>Peyntr</HI> thoroughly considered it already; and give such Instances of it which nothing but <HI>Envy</HI> or <HI>Ill-Nature</HI> could find Fault with: But the following <HI>Epistle</HI> prevents our dwelling upon this Excellency, it being a Master-piece of its kind, and what the Reader, we hope, will be greatly delighted with.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="353"/>
But let the Epistle speak for itself: There is one Paragraph in his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 28, 29.</NOTE>Preface to <HI>Sprott</HI>'s <HI>Chronicle,</HI> which really seems to be a new Method of <HI>Reasoning,</HI> such as no Writer but himself, we believe, dares lay any Claim to. He is there speaking in <HI>Sprott</HI>'s Praise, and his Words are these—<Q REND="inline"><HI>Adeo ut non videam cur mihi sit Detri∣mento, si publice declarem me opinari de A∣cademia nostra Oxoniensi Opus etiam justum ac distinctum contexuisse:</HI></Q> And then comes the Reason in the very next Sentence, viz. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Opinioni favet Auctoris Pietas. Quod si Tu aliter sentias, Ego in Sententia non perstabo</HI> nec <HI>quorsum recidant quaecunque animadverti magnopere laborabo, si modo il∣lud concesseris de Collegio Cantuariensi Opus post se reliquisse, in quo multa itidem de to∣ta Academia è Monumentis praeclaris obiter notaverit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the Argument produced to prove that the Author of that <HI>lean Chro∣nicle</HI> (whether <HI>Sprott</HI> or some other) it not clearly appearing that <HI>Sprott</HI> was the Au∣thor of it, composed many other valuable Books, not at all inferior to the <HI>Chronicle</HI> which is published. Great Pity indeed! that such profitable Works should be bu∣ried
<PB N="33" REF="354"/>
in Obscurity; and doubtless was there not some Hope of their being still recoverable, <HI>Sprott</HI>'s Admirers (how in∣flexible soever in other Cases) would la∣ment greatly under their Loss in this.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this new Method of Rea∣soning we find an uncommon Conjecture in his Preface to the Sixth Volume of <HI>Le∣land</HI>'s <HI>Itinerary,</HI> which very few Writers would ever have made. From a Medal of <HI>Carausius</HI> bearing this Inscription, VICTORIA CEA, he endeavours to prove, that the Brogue of the common People is the true Standard of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dialect and Pronunciation. The Word <HI>Caesar,</HI> ac∣cording to this <HI>curious Remark,</HI> is not to be pronounced as it generally is by People of Fashion and Breeding, <HI>Cesar,</HI> but a∣greeable to the broad Manner of speak∣ing used by the most rustic of Mankind, and as it stands upon the Coin, CEASAR.</P>
<P>We acknowledge the Observation to be a very curious one, and to stand upon the Authority of a Medal, but if it should ever be discovered, that it proceeded from an Error of the <HI>Mint-Master,</HI> from a simple Literal Transposition, or from any other Accident (as possibly it might) the Re∣mark will then sink into its Value; The
<PB N="34" REF="355"/>
Coin indeed may be curious upon the Ac∣count of the Blunder, but is no more an Argument to ascertain the Truth of Dia∣lect or Pronunciation, than that <HI>spurious Halfpenny</HI> of his present <HI>Majesty,</HI> would be a Standard in the next Age for pro∣nouncing GEOGIVS instead of GEORGIVS.</P>
<P>It would waste too much of the Reader's Time probably, to offer here a Collection of all the Poetical Fragments scattered thro' his Labours; the Preservation of which by Printing them, we must ob∣serve, shews no small Desire to be useful to Mankind, as these Rhythmes contain either Lessons of Oeconomy; such as,<Q><L>With a red Man reade thy read;</L>

<P>Thus have we collected some Memorials of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Life, and have taken the Liberty to correct some few Mistakes in his Writing. In a Thing of such Mo∣ment we have been very careful not to of∣fend any impartial Reader: we have a∣voided <HI>Flattery</HI> on the one Hand, and <HI>Scandal</HI> on the other. We have described his good Qualities as they occurred, and rectified such as must be acknowledged to have been gross <HI>Errors;</HI> and such as he would not pass over in any Author that fell in his way either Living or Dead. Nay, if any Person differed from Him, but in his own private Opinion, it was Ground sufficient for him to let loose the Reins of his utmost Vengeance; a flagrant and very unjustifiable Instance of which we shall here produce.</P>

bad, that I dare say their <HI>Followers</HI> will be very few; I shall therefore content my self with what <HI>Monsieur Le Clerc</HI> observes upon a particular Occasion. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Bibliotheque Choise,</HI> ARTIC. of Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Re∣marks on <HI>Italy</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. <HI>Ad∣dison</HI> is of Opinion, <HI>says he,</HI> that the Figure of <HI>Jupiter Pluvius,</HI> sending down Rain on the fainting Army of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and Thunderbolts on his Ene∣mies, is the greatest Confirmation pos∣sible of the Story of the <HI>Thundering Legion:</HI> This learned Man would ap∣parently mean to say, that this Figure is a Monument of the Shower which fell on the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, and of the Thun∣der which confounded the <HI>Germans;</HI> for as to the <HI>Thundering Legion,</HI> the Learned are agreed that it had that Denomination long before this Circum∣stance; and that there is no Probability that it was intirely made up of <HI>Christians.</HI> See <HI>Henry</HI> de <HI>Valois</HI> upon <HI>Eusebius, Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5. and Father <HI>Pagi</HI> upon the Year CLXXIV.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus, with <HI>Monsieur Le Clerc,</HI> I leave this <HI>Thundering Legend.</HI> And, may it still continue to lead up the Van of Miracles in the <HI>Romish</HI> Church; for as Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> well Remarks, as it took its Name from

<HI>Paganism</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See,</HI> his <HI>Posthum. Works,</HI> Vol. 2. p. 83.</NOTE>, it is most proper that it should end in <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>I shall by and by incur the same Censure as Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> has undergone; for I freely acknowledge, that I have the same Opi∣nion of Archibishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> which he had of Bishop <HI>Sanderson, That</HI> He <HI>had more</HI> Judgment <HI>than all the</HI> Fathers <HI>put to∣gether.</HI> And I believe the same Character might justly be given of Bishop <HI>Taylor,</HI> Bishop <HI>Pearson,</HI> Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> and that truly great Man you have named, Bishop <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI> and several other of our <HI>English</HI> Divines.</P>
<P>Before I mention any part of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s Charge, I shall give a Summary of Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI>'s Religious Principles in his own Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'If Men, <HI>says he,</HI> would but consider, that it is not only our Duty, but our Interest to be Virtuous, one would think this were no hard Task to perform, <HI>viz.</HI> reforming the Manners of the People, and restoring them to their antient Sobriety and Virtue. Among a thousand Advantages that Christianity has, above all other Religions, this is none of the least, that it has united our In∣terest
<PB N="42" REF="363"/>
and our Duty together. Would not a wise Man be Chaste for the sake of Health; Honest for the sake of Profit; Temperate for the sake of Pleasure, and all Three for the sake of Fame? For Vice was never yet so triumphant as to be in greater Reputation than Virtue. These Considerations, together with the innumerable Mischiefs and Inconveni∣encies which attend a vicious Course of Life, ought in Reason to reclaim Men from <HI>all</HI> unmanly Excesses. One would think in a Christian Nation, that Reli∣gion and Conscience; our own Hopes and Fears; the Prospect of eternal Hap∣piness or endless Misery, should be Con∣siderations strong enough to lay an effec∣tual Restraint on the most violent Lusts and Appetites.—One of the greatest Obstacles, in my Opinion, to the Re∣formation of Manners, is, that too many Men place all Virtue and Religion in warmly adhering to the Interest of this or that particular Sect or Party: As if a fiery Zeal for the Church, or the Meet∣ing-House, could atone for Lewdness and Debauchery; or as if vicious and immoral Men could be of any Christian Church or Community'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See,</HI> his Charge to the <HI>Grand Jury</HI> at <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seard. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Works.</HI> Vol. 1. p. 152, 155, 156, and 158.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="364"/>
Now Sir, tho' I should be as far from interrupting the indefatigable Labours of Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> in his Historical Studies as any Man living; yet I think no Man ought to be indefatigable in Slander, and that the Unchristian Temper he has shewn ought to be reprehended. And it gives me no small Concern to find the grave Style of an Antiquarian changed to the foul-mouthed Language of the most aban∣doned Prostitute. Neither can I by any means agree, that whatever <HI>unguarded Expressions</HI> Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> may have dropt, can be just Grounds of Provocation for such Scurrility, as I believe never before fell from the Pen of any Controvertist. But Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> has himself hit the right Nail on the Head in the Passage above cited. Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> was a professed <HI>Whig,</HI> and a hearty Well-wisher to his Country. Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> is a professed <HI>Non-Juror,</HI> and a fiery Bigot to those of his own Principles. With him, Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the XI, and Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI> were equally Infallible, and, in the true mean∣ing of the Word, I believe so too. Mr. <HI>Moyle,</HI> as a <HI>Whig,</HI> must be <HI>a Republican, a Con∣temner of Religions; one who had a natural Antipathy to the Clergy and their Friends, a meer Ignoramus,</HI> and, in good Ecclesi∣astical Charity, <HI>gone to the Devil.</HI> I can∣not
<PB N="44" REF="365"/>
help therefore asking you, Sir, whe∣ther you really think the Positions advanced by Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> in his <HI>Lescard</HI>-Charge, or any part of his Conduct to which you were ever a Witness, could deserve such Treatment, especially from one who never knew him otherwise than by his Writings.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Critical Dispute,</HI> I shall be as silent as I resolve to be about the <HI>Legendary one</HI> above mentioned. Yet I cannot help observing, that what Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI> says, is very merrily dogmatical. For, he will have it that Mr. <HI>Hearne forms a right Judgment of all Mr.</HI> Moyle<HI>'s Works,—because the best Antiquaries have judged his Shield to be a</HI> Clypeus Votivus. And Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> is highly criminal, <HI>and passes Sentence upon it, without ever having seen it,</HI> otherwise than by two Draughts. Now I would only ask the learned Doctor one plain Question; <HI>If I see the Picture of a Horse,</HI> am I to believe the <HI>living Animal</HI> it represents to be a <HI>Bear?</HI> But indeed he descends a little, and says, That <HI>the Ba∣ron</HI> Spanheim <HI>and Mr.</HI> Sellers intended to write Dissertations upon it, and that some other Antiquarians really believed it to be an Antique; <HI>(anglice)</HI> the Back of an Old Sconce, which I have been credibly in∣formed he bought in <HI>Rag-Fair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="366"/>
As to that Piece of Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI>'s, which Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> complains is imper∣fectly printed, it is to be hoped he will oblige the learned World with a more correct Copy; tho' this Imputation does not lye against Mr. <HI>Moyle,</HI> but against the <HI>Person</HI> who transmitted that Piece to him.</P>
<P>May Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> hereafter retain a more Christian Temper. May his useful Studies, as you are pleased to call them, meet with all the Success he can expect, and may the scurrillous Cavils, both of him and every other Writer, meet with that just Contempt which is due to such Performances. This is the hearty Wish of,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon this Occasion Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> also wrote the following Letter to Mr. <HI>Hearne,</HI> viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR late <HI>Invective</HI> against Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI> I shall prove to be wholly <HI>Groundless</HI> and therefore it turns upon <HI>yourself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="367"/>
In the first place you will have it, that all who dissent from Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI> are <HI>a set of abandoned Wretches, and such indeed was</HI> Walter Moyle <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose Posthumous Works all good Men ought to lay aside;</HI> for Reasons hereafter to be considered. As to Mr. <HI>Dodwell,</HI> I had above twenty Years intimate Correspondence with him, and always believed him to be a learned, and very pious Man. But at the same time, all, who knew him, will allow that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Character of a certain Peer, in <HI>Absalom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> too much re∣sembled Mr. <HI>Dodwell;</HI> for he truly was, what the Poet asserts,
<Q><L>Stiff in Opinions, <HI>mostly</HI> in the Wrong;</L>
<L>Was every thing by starts and nothing long.</L></Q>
The First Book I ever printed was the present of a Manuscript he made me, in Defence of his, now sufficiently exploded, Doctrine of the <HI>Divine Imortalizing Spirit transfused by Baptism</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>Explication</HI> of a <HI>famous Passage</HI> in the Dialogue of St. <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> with <HI>Tryphon,</HI> concerning the <HI>Immortality</HI> of <HI>Human Souls,</HI> &amp;c. 8vo. printed in the Year 1708, price 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></NOTE>. And if you will, undertake to vindicate every Notion he advanced, <HI>God speed the Plough.</HI> Secondly, you will have it, that Mr. <HI>Moyle treats</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="368"/>
<HI>with great Contumacy and Arrogance many of the best and most excellent Authors as well ancient as modern,</HI> (tho' you name none but your <HI>Doctissimus</HI> Woodwardus <HI>vir Clarissimus,</HI> of whom more in the sequel) and, you add, <HI>he does not spare even the</HI> Holy <HI>Fathers, of whom he confi∣dently asserts that Bishop</HI> Sanderson <HI>had more</HI> Judgment <HI>than all of them put together.</HI> And I am as confident that every Man of <HI>Judgment</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> believes this Article of Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI>'s CREED.</P>
<P>Now since your Breast is animated with so much Heat in behalf of these <HI>Venerabi∣lia,</HI> the <HI>Fathers,</HI> I desire to know by what better Authority, than a <HI>Popish</HI> Canoniza∣tion, are they invested with the Epithet of <HI>Holy?</HI> If indeed, all the <HI>Libertinism</HI> of <HI>Youth</HI> be sufficient to confer that Title, and all the <HI>Impotence</HI> of <HI>Age,</HI> be sufficient to confirm it, the Plea is good, and the Precedents produced may be St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> St. <HI>Origen,</HI> and that notorious Saint, of <HI>Creed-making</HI> Memory, St. <HI>Athanasius.</HI> Who in their Works may say of each o∣ther—
<Q><L>Quantum mutatus ab illo.</L></Q>
Therefore, as to their <HI>Sacredness,</HI> I think it
<PB N="48" REF="369"/>
may be fairly said to be <HI>extinct.</HI> Upon these Considerations indeed, <HI>you ought to be sorry and ashamed to mention Mr.</HI> Moyle <HI>as you have done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> With what Face, other than that of an assuming Arrogance, can you say that Mr. <HI>Moyle was but a superficial Writer,</HI> after Dean <HI>Prideaux,</HI> (with whom certainly you will have the Modesty to own you cannot stand in Competition) <HI>has thanked him for the Pains he had taken about his</HI> Connection? And declares, that <HI>he should have been glad of the Assistance of so</HI> Learned <HI>a Friend near him, to whom he might have communicated that History</HI> be∣fore it was printed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Posth. Works. Vol. 2. p. 36.</NOTE> You farther add, with an equal share of Confidence and Falshood, (as will appear from the Senti∣ments of learned Men) that, <HI>he was one, who on account of his Hatred to the Clergy, and their Friends, has boldly, according to the measure of his Understanding,</HI> (I hear∣tily wish yours was either as deep or as honest) <HI>railed against the best Writers, and the most excellent Men.</HI> (But, <HI>latet An∣guis in Herba,</HI> the Men you here hint at, are the professed Enemies of our Consti∣tution both in Church and State, and as
<PB N="49" REF="370"/>
such only were opposed by Mr. <HI>Moyle.</HI>) What you farther, with the greatest Dis∣ingenuity insinuate against him, may be strictly applied to your own Temper, that, as all good Men must despise the Censure of so scurrilous an Antagonist, so they must, upon the same Principles, have but a very slight Opinion of those Persons whose Encomiums are drawn by your Pen.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>MOYLE</HI>'s <HI>wayward-Editor,</HI> you have indeed justly reprehended; but as to your Cavils concerning the <HI>Bath</HI> In∣scription, they are equally disingenuous. Does he not tell Dr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> whom he allowed to be a superior Judge, with all the becoming Modesty of a well bred Gentlemen, that, <HI>he could pretend to no great Skill in these Matters; but since you ask my Opinion</HI> (says he to the Doctor) <HI>I will give it with my usual Frankness, not doubting but you will receive it with your usual Candour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Posth. Works, Vol. 1. pag. 169, 170.</NOTE>. This is corresponding like Men of Sense and Integrity!</P>
<P>As you began with Mr. <HI>Dodwell,</HI> I am sorry to conclude, that you are guilty of
<PB N="50" REF="371"/>
the Charge he brings against his Oppo∣nents, in the Piece I printed for him abovementioned, <HI>pag,</HI> 143. <HI>It is my great Unhappiness,</HI> says he, <HI>that I have to do with Adversaries, who will not be con∣fined to the Subject of our principal Dispute, without deviating to personal Reflections, wherein the Reader is not any Way con∣cerned.</HI> This is the Bane of all Contro∣versy, and I hope for the future you will avoid it.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> As to your <HI>Vir Clarissimus</HI> Woodwardus <HI>Doctissimus,</HI> he most learn∣edly follows the <HI>Low-bell</HI> of your Scan∣dal, and <HI>shields</HI> himself under your Senti∣ments of his <HI>Clypeus Votivus.</HI> But I would advise neither of you to be too fond of your own confined Speculation, and rest assured that there has already been more Thousands sold of Mr. <HI>Moyle</HI>'s Works, than ever there will be Hundreds either of your <HI>Monkish</HI> Chronicles, or his <HI>Fossilarian-La∣bours,</HI> including his late Fardle of <HI>Self-conceit,</HI> prefix'd to his <HI>Self-defence</HI> (against the Objections of the learned <HI>Camerarius</HI>) which was written by himself, tho' he has franked it under the Cover of his Translator <HI>Holloway.</HI> And to my other Wishes for your Welfare, may you, du∣ring

In proving of which, the</HI> Case <HI>of</HI> Maud <HI>and King</HI> Stephen <HI>is particularly considered. In a Letter to a Non-Juror.</HI> Conscientia mille Testes.

which others refused.

<P><PB N="64" REF="385"/>
And my Will further is, <HI>First,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Bedford</HI> would take special Care of the MSS and Books I have bequeathed to him; particularly of Dr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s, and of those written, collated and no∣ted by my self, so that they be all kept together, and that they fall into none but good Hands. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Bedford</HI> would act the Part of a Super∣visor or Overseer of this my last Will and Testament, and assist my Execu∣tors to the best of his Power, in which, as I rely upon his Prudence and Con∣duct, so at the same Time I hope they will readily follow his Advice.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>NE must have but little Know∣ledge of human Nature, not to be sensible of that Curiosity which prompts Mankind to be acquainted with the History of Persons distinguished by their extraordinary Vir∣tues and Qualifications, and who have experienced many uncommon Varieties of Life. In reading their Transactions, we become agreeably intimate with the Characters which have raised our Admi∣ration; we attend them in the different Scenes thro' which they pass, and are sensible of a secret Longing to imitate the shining Parts of their Conduct: They frequently teach us an easy Moderation in Prosperity, and are no less successful in reconciling us to the severe Dispensa∣tion of Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="390"/>
THE Impressions we receive from per∣sonal Characters, are more lively and affecting than such as are imparted to us by moral Precepts; and those Virtues, which Institutions of Philosophy might give us but a languid Invitation to imi∣tate, are altogether irresistable, when they are set off by the Conduct of Persons of Elevation; and they must be thrown into Action, in order to give them their last Polish and Refinement.</P>
<P>THIS may be one Reason why Bio∣graphy has generally met with such a fa∣vourable Reception, and we may venture to affirm, that if the Authors who engage in this Kind of Writing, would select such Characters as are entertaining, and instructive at the same Time, they would have no Cause to complain of any Dis∣regard from the Public.</P>
<P>THE noble Lady, who is the Sub∣ject of the following Memoirs, has made so conspicuous and engaging a Figure, thro' the series and Vicissitudes of a long Life, that she may be justly reputed an Honour to her own Sex, as
<PB N="3" REF="391"/>
she has always been the Admiration of ours.</P>
<P>IF a Descent from an illustrious Race of <HI>British</HI> Nobility, a polite and generous Education, an early Familiarity with the most amiable Accomplishments, an inchanting Harmony of Person and Mind, a Virgin Purity of Youth, and a taintless Fidelity of conjugal Life, have any Charms in the softer Sex, they have all lent their full Lustre to the late Dutchess of <HI>ORMONDE.</HI></P>
<P>IT should seem as if Providence intend∣ed to guard this Lady from every Impu∣tation that could be formed against her by envious and detracting Minds, and therefore would not confine her Virtues to Scenes of Satisfaction and Prosperity; she had long convinced the World of her Ability to act an unexceptionable Part in such a Situation, but something still remained to give her Conduct its full Perfection. The appointed Period ar∣rived; this incomparable Person was de∣prived of the dearest of all her Enjoy∣ments: She saw herself for ever sepa∣rated from her darling Consort, and her former Affluence contracted into a very
<PB N="4" REF="392"/>
moderate Limitation: Her Sunshine of Happiness darkened with Adversity; but that Adversity only gave her an Oppor∣tunity of charming all who knew her, by her inimitable Resignation to the Decrees of Heaven.</P>
<P>AS there was Reason to believe the Public would be curious to know the Particulars of a Life so diversified by such unusual Events, all possible Care has been taken to collect every authen∣tic Circumstance that could make such a Relation useful and entertaining; and, we presume, that the Impartiality with which we have proceeded, on this Oc∣cation, will intitle this Performance to a candid Reception from those who are pleased to favour it with their Perusal.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE Of Her GRACE <HI>MARY</HI> Dutchess of <HI>ORMONDE.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Dutchess of <HI>ORMONDE,</HI> whose Life we propose to write, was the Elder surviving Daugh∣ter of <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Beau∣fort,</HI> by his Dutchess <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter of that unfortunate Patriot, the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> whose steady Attachment to his distressed Soveraign, King <HI>CHARLES,</HI> I. de∣prived him, in 1648, of a Life which deserved a much happier Period.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="394"/>
THE most noble House of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> as it was august in its Original, so it has been perpetuated by a Train of Descen∣dants, who have been justly esteemed the Ornaments of their Country. And the great <HI>Plantagenets,</HI> who founded this illustrious Family, have transmitted their Virtues thro' a long Series of their Po∣sterity, and adorned the Kingdom with a Progeny, of both Sexes, which will be ever remembered with Honour.</P>
<P>THE Dutchess of <HI>ORMONDE</HI> was born at <HI>Beaufort</HI>-House, near <HI>Chelsea, Anno</HI> 1665; and, in her early Years, presented such a Dawn of amiable Qua∣lities to her noble Parents, as convinced them that the Lustre of their Family would receive no Diminution from their lovely Daughter. Animated by this Persuasion, they were particularly care∣ful to cultivate, by a suitable Education, the Virtues which had already sprung up in her Mind with such a luxuriant Bloom. Their Cares succeeded to their Wish, and there was no Accomplishment neces∣sary to give Perfection to her Sex, but what appeared with all its Charms in the Conduct of this young Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="395"/>
NATURE sometimes presents us with a great deal of Inequality in her Produc∣tions; and it is no uncommon Thing to see a very disagreeable Exterior allotted to a finished Mind; but she now determined to be uniform in her Operations, and prepared, for the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI>'s Daughter, a Form as amiable, as the Soul which was to claim it, for her Habi∣tation.</P>
<P>IT would require a Pen, much more masterly in Description than mine, to give the Reader a competent Idea of this engaging Lady; the inchanting Harmo∣ny of her Shape, the Lustre and Viva∣city of her Eyes, which inspired all who beheld them with unutterable Impressions; the glowing Blush of the Rose, which was blended in her Cheeks with the Virgin Purity of the Lilly, the flowing Shade of Hair which wantoned in a Profusion of Ringlets, that no Pencil could imitate; the delicate Turn of her Face, and the bewitching Softness which diffused itself thro' every Feature; the panting Snow of her Bosom, and the taper Whiteness of her Arms; with a thousand other Beauties which perpetually played around her, formed such an Assemblage of Perfection,
<PB N="8" REF="396"/>
that was to be resisted by nothing but Insensibility itself.</P>
<P>WE believe we shall not be taxed with Falshood, when we affirm, that such a Prodigality of Charms were capable, without any other Assistance, of capti∣vating a thousand Hearts; but we have already intimated that Nature discarded all Partiality in her Plan, and made this irresistable Form the Residence of a Soul which was altogether as attractive as its lovely Mansion: The most refined Poig∣nancy of her Wit was contrasted by the sedatest Judgment; and each of these fine Qualifications were so beautifully softened by her native Sweetness of Tem∣per, that her Pleasantry never gave Pain, and none ever thought themselves insult∣ed by her superior Penetration.</P>
<P>THE Happiness of her Memory facili∣tated her Improvement, by those Books and Industry, with which she was daily conversant; and, in a few Years, it proved such a Treasury of Knowledge and Po∣liteness, as few Ladies of her Age were ever enriched with: The little Levities of the Sex, and those refined Deviations from Sincerity and Sanctity of Manners, which are become so fashionable a Part
<PB N="9" REF="397"/>
of modern Education were altogether un∣known to her. True Virtue is certainly amiable in herself, but she puts on re∣doubled Charms when she shines in the Conduct of a blooming Virgin.</P>
<P>SUCH was the Lady we are describ∣ing; her Mind was as immaculate as her Face, and every Year that added to her Youth, presented her with new Perfec∣tions, and awaken'd a general Curiosity to know what happy Man was to be bless'd with the Endearments of her nup∣tial Love.</P>
<P>IT is not to be imagined in what Manner that pleasing Expectation influ∣enced some of the noblest of the <HI>British</HI> Youth. A virtuous young Lady of Rank and Beauty is a publick Blessing, she civi∣lizes the Souls of her Admirers more than all their Academical Institutions, and fires them to aim at a proper Simili∣tude of Accomplishments. Innocence, Purity and Honour appear so persuasive in the Fair-One, that it is no Wonder if she daily increases the Number of their Votaries, and brings them fresh Acces∣sions of Homage.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="398"/>
AMONGST the shining Crouds of Adorers who wished to inspire her with the soft Sensibility of Love, none made so conspicuous a Figure as the Duke of <HI>Ormonde;</HI> he was descended from a very antient and illustrious Family that had given many Heroes to their Country, and, in the Person of the Duke, had pre∣sented it with an Ornament that did not a little contribute to its Lustre. Death had for some Time deprived him of his first Lady (who was the eldest Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI>) and left him a Widower in the full Bloom of his Youth. His endear∣ing Behaviour to his deceased Dutchess, warmed many of the fairest with secret Wishes to succeed her in his Embraces. His Person was such as might impart the softest Impressions to the chastest Heart, and was set off by such a winning Singu∣larity of Sweetness, Generosity, and eve∣ry other Quality which constitutes the fine Gentleman, that it was almost impossible for him to be long considered with In∣difference by any Lady to whom he breathed his Passion. We may add to this, that he possessed such a Princely Estate, that Fortune seemed to contend with Nature which of them should be his greatest Benefactor. It is true, the Duke
<PB N="11" REF="399"/>
only valued the Favours of the former, as they enabled him to distinguish him∣self by numberless Acts of Humanity, and indulged him in his natural Propen∣sity to Benevolence. And if the Goddess has not of late been so liberal to many others, it may have proceeded from their being destitute of his Inclinations to com∣municate her Bounties to their Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>AFTER the Account I have attempt∣ed to give of these two illustrious Per∣sons, it will be natural to conclude, that they were formed for each other; and therefore, without entering into the Par∣ticulars of that tender Intercourse which Love, and a Similitude of Dispositions, established between them, it will be suffi∣cient if we acquaint the Reader, that his Grace was so fortunate in his Addresses, as to prevail on the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI>'s charming Daughter to consent to be the loveliest Bride in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE Number of the young Dutchess's Admirers was not diminished by her Mar∣riage, and tho' they found themselves re∣strained from disclosing to her the Senti∣ments with which her Charms had in∣spired them, yet there were several who
<GAP DESC="missing" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="400"/>
merited that Friendship by a Number of amiable Qualities.</P>
<P>IT often happens, that Men of Wit, thro' too much Partiality to themselves, are apt to fancy that a Lady's Satisfac∣tion in their Conversation, must create a Fondness for their Persons, and the Earl did not fail to impute to the Dutchess, Impressions in his Favour, which she her∣self was never sensible of; and conse∣quently he was always ready to improve every Instance of her Complacency too much to his own Advantage. The Opinion he entertained of his being more agreea∣ble to her than he really was, made him look on the dishonourable Conduct he was meditating against the Duke, as a Crime that was capable of a very easy Vindication, he thought it more hon∣ourable to succeed with the Dutchess, than to preserve Fidelity in his Friend∣ship to her Lord; and to such an Infa∣tuation was he hurried by his guilty Love, that he imagined it to be the most criminal Action in the World to neglect the Happiness which his Vanity repre∣sented the Dutchess inclinable to afford him.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="401"/>
IN Consequence of this Persuasion, as he had the Honour one Evening to lead her Grace from the Drawing Room, he slipt a Letter into her Hand, as she was stepping into her Coach, and then retired with a profound Reverence. The Lady believed the Paper contained some agreeable Piece of Poetry, in which the Earl, as we intimated before, was very happy, and was impatient to read this new Product of his Capacity: But who can describe her Confusion and Resent∣ment, when she found it to be a Decla∣ration of Love, and her Displeasure was the greater, as she was conscious that no Part of her Conduct could possibly give that Nobleman any Pretentions to the indecent Presumption with which he treated her; and tho' it was late at Night, she resolved to acquaint the Dutchess her Mother with the Affront that had been offered to her Virtue.</P>
<P>SHE accordingly ordered her Coach∣man to drive to the Dutchess of <HI>Beau∣fort</HI>'s House, and, at her Arrival there, went into her Grace's Bed-Chamber, and intreated her, with a Flood of Tears, to read the Letter she put into her Hands. The Dutchess was not a little surprized

<PB N="15" REF="403"/>

<PB N="16" REF="404"/>
to see her Daughter in a Disorder of Mind intirely new to her, and immedi∣ately read over the Letter, with an Asto∣nishment natural to such an Event. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Is it possible, Madam,</HI> said the Dutchess of <HI>Ormonde, that any Man can dare to think he has a Privilege to treat me in this dis∣honourable Manner! I can appeal to Hea∣ven and Earth, that my Conduct has hither∣to been without Reproach, which makes this Violation of the Respect due to me, so insupportable.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Dutchess of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was as much dissatisfied with this Adventure, as her Daughter, and was justly apprehen∣sive that it might be attended with very fatal Consequences; to prevent which, all imaginable Discretion was necessary.</P>
<P>WHILST they were deliberating what Steps were most proper to be taken in so delicate an Affair, a Lady of great Quality, and a near Relation to them both, came in very seasonably to assist at the Consultation; and after she had heard a particular Account of the whole Affair, she gave it as her Opinion, that <Q REND="inline"><HI>it would be most proper for the Dutchess of</HI> Ormonde <HI>to dissemble her Resentment, and treat the amorous Peer with such an</HI><PB N="17" REF="405"/>
<HI>Air of Indifference, as would effectually mortify his Vanity, and discourage him from persisting in his criminal Desires:</HI> The Lady added, <HI>that if such a Course of Behaviour should not have the Effect that might be reasonably expected, she would undertake to disclose the Affair to the Duke of</HI> Ormonde, <HI>in such a Light as should en∣gage him to come into a Scheme she had formed for making this new Lover the Di∣version of the whole Town.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Advice was allowed to be just, and, after some farther Consideration, the Dutchess of <HI>Ormonde</HI> took her Leave, with a Determination to conduct herself according to her Relations Sentiments. It was not long before the young Earl saw her, and, as he was pleased to flat∣ter himself, that the Graces of his Wit and Person were irresistable, he was not a little surprised at the negligent Man∣ner in which the Dutchess heard all the fine Things he said to her; and as he found that he had not made the least Impression on her Heart, he began to imagine she might possibly not have read his Letter, for he could not believe that so much premeditated Wit and Tenderness as it contained, could prove ineffectual; and therefore resolved to be certain that
<PB N="18" REF="406"/>
his next Letter should be read by the Dutchess; for which Purpose, he found Means to gain, as he imagined, one of her Women to his Interest; he made her a Present of a large Purse of Gold, ac∣companying it with a second Billet, which he intreated her to deliver into her La∣dy's Hands, and, at the same Time, gave her to understand, that if she ac∣quitted herself of the Confidence he re∣posed in her, to his Satisfaction, there was nothing she might not promise her∣self from his future Bounty.</P>
<P>THE Dutchess's Woman performed her Commission, and gave the Letter to her Lady, with a particular Account of the Earl's Liberality, and all the large Promises he had made her. The Dutch∣ess, after she had read the Letter, made her Mother, and the other Lady, who had instructed her how to behave, acquainted with the Contents; upon which they thought it now a proper Time to make the Duke of <HI>Ormonde</HI> privy to the Secret. This they did, in such a Manner as ea∣sily disposed his Grace to come into their Measures, to make his Rival as ridicu∣lous as his Vanity ought to render him. To accomplish which, it was agreed a∣mong them, that the Dutchess should an∣swer
<PB N="19" REF="407"/>
her Lover's Letter, and it is easy to imagine, that an Epistle dictated by such Persons, and on such an Occasion, was artful enough to deceive, even a Gen∣tleman of the Earl's Penetration. It would be no disagreeable Entertainment to the Reader, could I repeat all the plea∣sant Things, and the diverting Contri∣vances that were invented by this illu∣strious Company, to expose the presum∣ing Lover. The Dutchess of <HI>Ormonde</HI> was for having him <Q REND="inline"><HI>privately admitted in∣to the House, and shut up in some Place where he might be half frozen, before he should be set at Liberty:</HI></Q> But the Duke replied, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That would be a Management of too low a Turn for the Earl's nice and de∣licate Taste,</HI></Q> and then recollecting, that his Garden Wall was of a very conveni∣ent Heighth, he thought it would be best <Q REND="inline"><HI>for the Lover to climb over it, in order to come to his Lady, the Danger and Diffi∣culty only tending to compleat the Glory of such a gallant Adventure; besides,</HI> added he, <HI>we shall by this Means see whether his Lordship is in earnest, and dare ha∣zard his fine Person in the Prosecution of his Amour.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Proposal meeting with the Ap∣probation of all the Ladies, they went
<PB N="20" REF="408"/>
into the Garden to examine the Wall, and, observing a Place that had Hooks, which a Ladder might be commodiously fastened to, the Dutchess's Woman had Directions to describe this convenient Situation to the Earl; but it was not done till several Letters had passed be∣tween him and the Dutchess, and he be∣came persuaded, that his Addresses were as successful as he could wish. And now the Dutchess's Woman acquainted him, <Q REND="inline"><HI>he had made all imaginable Impressions on her Lady, and that she expected the Plea∣sure of his Company with the greatest Im∣patience, but then,</HI> continued she, <HI>it will be impossible for your Lordship to pass by the Porter in any Disguise; and you are not insensible what Regard is due to a Lady's Reputation, in an Affair of this Nature, and therefore some Expedient must be thought of, to prevent any Discovery of your being admitted into my Lady's Apart∣ment.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Earl, upon this, gave her the strongest Assurances of his strict Regard for the Dutchess's Honour; <Q REND="inline"><HI>and there∣fore,</HI> said he, <HI>I am desirous of being intro∣duced in any Manner you can contrive, to prevent my being discovered by any of the Servants, and there is no Danger, that I</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="409"/>
<HI>will ever decline to accomplish my Happi∣ness, with all the Privacy my lovely Dutch∣ess can possibly desire.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Gentlewoman finding him in such a Resolution, thought it then pro∣per to acquaint him, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That no Way would be more effectual, to prevent the Affair from being detected, than for his Lordship to climb over the Garden-Wall,</HI></Q> and then she described that particular Part of it, where the Hooks were fastened; <Q REND="inline"><HI>your Lordship,</HI> added she, <HI>is too gallant, to hesitate at a∣ny little Danger that you may be exposed to, on such an Occasion, and you are like∣wise to consider, that you could not have a more favourable Opportunity of convinc∣ing my Lady, that your Passion for her, can make you despise every Hazard and Diffi∣culty that may lie between you and the Happiness you are in Pursuit of, and there∣fore, if your Lordship has no Objection to what I have been proposing, I will be, at Eleven this Night, in the Garden to re∣ceive you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HIS Lordship was so animated, with the Hopes of his imagined Joys, that he told the Gentlewoman, in a Kind of Transport, <Q REND="inline"><HI>That he thought Fortune was very propitious to him, in giving him such</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="410"/>
<HI>an Opportunity of convincing her Lady how much his Passion could surmount eve∣ry Danger and Impediment;</HI></Q> upon which he took his Leave, with a solemn Pro∣mise to be punctual to the appointed Time; and then went to pay a Visit to the Duke of <HI>Ormonde,</HI> by whom, as was before observed, he was treated with the greatest Friendship and Intimacy.</P>
<P>THE Duke received him with his usual Affability, and after some Conver∣sation, walked with him in his Garden, where he could not forbear smiling to himself, to observe, with what a curious Eye his Visitor examined rhe Wall he was to scale that Evening. After they had taken a few Turns, the Earl took his Leave, and went to his own House, where he passed the Remainder of the Day with all the impatient Desires, natural to a Lover, who expects the happy Period of all his Wishes. The appointed Hour was, at last, come, and his Lordship did not fail to be exactly punctual at the Place agreed on, where he found the Ladder of Ropes thrown over the Wall, by the Means of which he mounted to the Top, with wonderful Activity, and from thence, as nimbly descended into the Garden: But, alas! how frequently
<PB N="23" REF="411"/>
do Disappointments and Disgrace attend the finest Schemes of poor Mortals; and how common is it for Men to meet with the most disagreeable Accidents, in the very Instant that he promised him∣self nothing but Rapture, and the most perfect Felicity! The adventrous Peer had no sooner set Foot on the fatal Ground, than the Gardener, who hap∣pened to be a very sturdy Fellow, pre∣tending to mistake him for a Person who intended to rob the House, fell upon him with Herculean Force, and gave him such a vigorous Drubbing, that he was ob∣liged to cry out for Assistance. The Noise alarmed the House, and the Duke, with all the Company, who were then at Supper with him, came out in a seeming Surprise to know the Occasion of the Clamours they heard. Any one will ima∣gine, that the unfortunate Lover made no very graceful Figure in such a Con∣juncture; and, as it was impossible for the Spectators of his Disgrace, to keep their Countenances, he grew sensible, that this had been a premeditated Scheme to expose him. But, as he had a peculi∣ar Presence of Mind, and was, likewise, one of those Philosophic Lovers, who never run distracted at the Disappoinment of their Passion, he asked the Duke's
<PB N="24" REF="412"/>
Pardon for the Folly he had committed, desiring his Grace to impute it to a youthful Inconsideration he would no longer indulge; after which, he joined with the Company in their Mirth, and rallied himself very pleasantly for the Discipline he had received from the ho∣nest Gardiner.</P>
<P>THE Earl's ill Success in his Amour, soon became public, and was, for a considerable Time, the Entertainment of all the gay Company about the Court; and besides this, it entirely extinguished the Hopes of all who sighed for the amiable Dutchess in Secret. They were convinced, that her Vertue was impreg∣nable, and that it was possible for a La∣dy to be the fairest of her Sex, and, at the same Time, capable of preserving an untainted Fidelity to her Nuptial Vow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foregoing was an Adventure of the late Duke of <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> when he was Earl of <HI>Mulgrave.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>ANY one will easily believe, that the Duke, after this amiable Proof of his Lady's Virtue, could not but cherish such a Treasure with the utmost Fond∣ness, and, indeed, our noble Pair lived in so mutual an Intercourse of Endear∣ments, as rendered them the Envy and
<PB N="25" REF="413"/>
Admiration of the Age. I say, the En∣vy, because there have been People ma∣licious enough to declare, that the Dutchess, some time after her Marriage, entertained such a Fondness for Cards, as in a great Measure alienated the Duke's Affection from her for a considerable Time. But whilst some have been so ungenerous as to propagate such a Re∣port, and others so weak as to believe it, all must acknowledge this to be the only Frailty that was ever imputed to that Lady, and even this has been aggravated much beyond the Reality of the Fact. The Truth is, Cards being at that Time, as well as now, the fashionable Amusement of the Fair, it was impossi∣ble for the Dutchess, whose House was continually filled with the best Company in the Kingdom, to do otherwise than comply with the Inclinations of her Vi∣sitors in that Diversion; and it may be true, that she might sometimes sit up late at Play to oblige her Company, and we will not deny, that the Duke might be sensible of some Uneasiness to find his Lady compelled by the reigning Deco∣rum among the Great, to be absent more Hours from him, than were agreeable to her Inclinations. But, at the same Time, in Justice to the Memory of that incom∣parable
<PB N="26" REF="414"/>
Lady, we must affirm, That the Moment she was sensible of the least Uneasiness in her Lord on that Account, she never after would suffer Play to de∣tain her from him, to any late or un∣seasonable Hour. A singular Instance this, of a Lady, who could resolve to sacrifice what was then thought an innocent Amusement, to the Repose of her Con∣sort; whereas the same Motive now, is frequently insufficient to make Numbers of the Sex resign Pleasures that are really criminal and injurious to their own and their Husband's Reputation. But to re∣turn to this noble Pair.</P>
<P>WHEN the Duke was constituted Lord-Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Dutchess undertook that Voyage; and her Recep∣tion and Return is so truly, and so ele∣gantly described by Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> in his Address to her Grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Dedication</HI> of his <HI>Fables.</HI></NOTE>, that it would be Injustice to his Memory to omit it, on this Occasion, <HI>viz.</HI><Q><LG>

Blue <HI>Tritons</HI> gave the Signal from the Shore,</L>

<L><HI>Portunus</HI> took his Turn, whose ample Hand</L>

<L>At your Approach, they crouded to the Port;</L>

<L>For Waste of Civil Wars, their Towns de∣stroy'd,</L>
