<L>WIth wreath of yellow crocus bound,</L>
<L>See furr-clad February creep!</L>
<L>His beard with snow is silver'd o'er,</L>
<L>Which still invests the hoary ground:</L>
<L>Two dolphins wait him on the deep,</L>
<L>And as they once Arion bore,</L>
<L>Invite him to serener skies,</L>
<L>Where the delighted spring-bird flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But he, intent to prune and plant,</L>
<L>And throw his seeds around the soil,</L>
<L>With decent grace the boon resigns,</L>
<L>Lest autumn's treasures should be scant;</L>
<L>Thence he renews his daily toil,</L>
<L>And trims with care the tender vines;</L>
<L>From rust he wipes his crooked knife,</L>
<L>And gives the infant sap new life.</L>

<L>Aurora hastens to the east:</L>
<L>And later now advances night</L>
<L>To draw her mantle o'er the day,</L>
<L>Suspending the nocturnal feast:</L>
<L>Diana sooner hails the light;</L>
<L>And hark the jolly huntsman's horn</L>
<L>With sprightly note salutes the morn!</L>

<L>What are the checquer'd months to me?</L>
<L>Or if they lower, or if they shine,</L>
<L>So Myra but approves my flame:</L>
<L>Throb not my heart; be calm and free,</L>

<L>The feather'd songsters shall proclaim</L>
<L>His festival with blither note,</L>
<L>And dress anew their bridal coat.</L>

<L>To Myra I enclos'd my heart,</L>
<L>Each letter bore an ardent vow;</L>
<L>St. Valentine the thought inspir'd,</L>

<L>Next morning with serener brow</L>

<LG>
<L>Two chaplets of lawrel, in verdure the same,</L>
<L>For George, O ye virgins, entwine!</L>
<L>From conquest's own temples these ever-greens came,</L>
<L>And those from the brows of the nine:</L>

<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>What glories, ye Britons, one emblem implies,</L>
<L>Shall to your lov'd monarch belong!</L>
<L>What Miltons, the other, what Drydens arise,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>To a wreath of fresh oak, England's emblem of power,</L>
<L>Whose honours with time shall increase,</L>
<L>Add a fair olive-sprig, just unfolding its flower:</L>
<L>Rich token of concord and peace!</L>
</LG>

<L>Next give him young myrtles, by beauty's brigh queen</L>
<L>Collected, the pride of her grove!</L>
<L>How fragrant their odour! their foliage how green!</L>
<L>Sweet promise of conjugal love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Gaul's captive lillies, cropt close from the ground,</L>
<L>As trophies of conquest be tied:</L>
<L>The virgins all cry—"There's not one to be found,</L>
<L>" Out-bloom'd by his roses they died!"</L>
</LG>

<L>Ye foes of old England! such fate shall ye share:</L>
<L>With George as our glories advance,</L>
<L>Thro' envy you'll sicken—you'll droop—you'll despair,</L>

<L>NOW ice-forming winter is melted away,</L>
<L>And gentle Favonius refreshes the day;</L>
<L>Spring sweetly in dimples now smiles on the streams,</L>
<L>And wherries sail light on the bosom of Thames:</L>
<L>No longer the cattle warm cover require,</L>
<L>The lubber no longer hangs over the fire;</L>
<L>No longer in snow the green meadows are lost,</L>
<L>And the fields are disarm'd of their breast-plate of frost.</L>

<L>Crocus, snow-drop, and primrose, that grow in the meads;</L>
<L>But if in the meadows fresh flowerets are rare,</L>
<L>Our soldiers have plenty of laurels to spare:</L>
<L>St. Valentine bids us be jovial and gay,</L>
<L>And finish with wine, love, and friendship, the day;</L>
<L>Fill, fill the large bowl, and let enmity cease;</L>
<L>Let us drink the king's health, who has crown'd us with peace.</L>
<L>Life is short, and grim death alike knocks at the door</L>
<L>Of the monarch's proud dome, and the cot of the poor:</L>
<L>Let us live then, nor longer procrastinate bliss,</L>

<L>To animate the soul, and warm the heart!</L>
<L>But oh, alas! unhallow'd and profane,</L>
<L>How shalt thou dare to raise the heavenly strain?</L>
<L>Do thou, who from the altar's living fire</L>
<L>Isaiah's tuneful lips didst once inspire,</L>
<L>Come to my aid, celestial spirit, come;</L>
<L>From my dark mind dispel the dubious gloom;</L>
<L>My passions still, my purer breast inflame,</L>

<L>Alarming thought! no wonder 'tis we dread</L>
<L>O'er these uncomfortable vaults to tread;</L>
<L>Where blended lie the aged and the young,</L>
<L>The rich and poor, an undistinguish'd throng:</L>
<L>Death conquers all, and time's subduing hand</L>
<L>Nor tombs, nor marble-statues can withstand.</L>
<L>Mark yonder ashes in confusion spread!</L>
<L>Compare earth's living tenants with her dead!</L>

<L>Once life and soul informed this mass of dust;</L>
<L>Around these bones, now broken and decay'd,</L>
<L>The streams of life in various channels play'd:</L>
<L>Perhaps that skull, so horrible to view!</L>

<L><PB N="50" REF="52"/>These hollow sockets two bright orbs contain'd,</L>
<L>Where the loves sported, and in triumph reign'd;</L>
<L>Here glow'd the lips; there white, as Parian stone,</L>

<L>This is life's goal—no farther can we view,</L>
<L>Beyond it, all is wonderful and new:</L>
<L>O deign, some courteous ghost! to let us know</L>
<L>What we must shortly be, and you are now!</L>
<L>Sometimes you warn us of approaching fate;</L>
<L>Why hide the knowledge of your present state?</L>
<L>With joy behold us tremblingly explore</L>

<L>The grave has eloquence—its lectures teach</L>
<L>In silence, louder than divines can preach;</L>
<L>Hear what it says—ye sons of folly hear!</L>
<L>It speaks to you—O give it then your ear!</L>
<L>It bids you lay all vanity aside,</L>
<L>O what a lecture this for human pride!</L>
</LG>

<L>The clock strikes twelve—how solemn is the sound!</L>
<L>Hark, how the strokes from hollow vaults rebound!</L>
<L>They bid us hasten to be wise, and show,</L>
<L>How rapid in their course the minutes flow.</L>
<L>See yonder yew—how high it lifts its head!</L>
<L>Around, the gloomy shade their branches spread!</L>
<L>Old and decay'd it still retains a grace,</L>
<L>And adds more solemn horror to the place.</L>

<L>And all his thoughts were to the world confin'd;</L>
<L>Death came unlook'd for—from his grasping hands</L>

<L>Still after death his vanity survives,</L>
<L>And on his tomb all of Hortensio lives.</L>
<L>Around me as I turn my wandering eyes,</L>

<L>Whose stones say only when their owners dy'd,</L>
<L>If young, or aged, and to whom ally'd.</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="54"/>On others pompous epitaphs are spread</L>
<L>In memory of the virtues of the dead:</L>
<L>Vain waste of praise! since, flattering or sincere,</L>
<L>The judgment-day alone will make appear.</L>
<L>How silent is this little spot of ground!</L>
<L>How melancholy looks each object round!</L>
<L>Here man dissolv'd in shatter'd ruin lies</L>
<L>So fast asleep—as if no more to rise;</L>
<L>'Tis strange to think how these dead bones can live,</L>
<L>Leap into form, and with new heat revive!</L>
<L>Or how this trodden earth to life shall wake,</L>
<L>Know its own place, its former figure take!</L>
<L>But whence these fears? when the last trumpet sounds</L>
<L>Thro' heaven's expanse to earth's remotest bounds,</L>
<L>The dead shall quit these tenements of clay,</L>
<L>And view again the long extinguish'd day:</L>
<L>It must be so—the same Almighty power</L>
<L>From dust who form'd us, can from dust restore.</L>
<L>Cheer'd with this pleasing hope, I safely trust</L>
<L>Jehovah's power to raise me from the dust,</L>

<L>For her the choicest of the woods I cull,</L>
<L>Sloes, hips, and strawberries, her belly full:</L>
<L>My hoard of apples I to her confest;</L>
<L>My heart was hers, well might she have the rest.</L>

<L>Yes, you was pleas'd; at least you said you were.</L>

<L>But oh, the soldier, blaster of my hopes!</L>
<L>(Curse on pretending kings, and papish popes)</L>
<L>He came from Flanders with the red-coat crew,</L>
<L>To fight with rebels, and he conquer'd you.</L>
<L>His doulas ruffles, and his copper lace,</L>
<L>His brickdust stockings, and his brazen face,</L>
<L>These are the charms for which you slight my youth;</L>
<L>Charms much too potent for a maiden's truth!</L>
<L><PB N="78" REF="80"/>Soon on the feather'd fool you turn'd your eyes;</L>
<L>Eager you listen'd to the braggard's lyes;</L>
<L>And, scorning me, your heart to him resign,</L>

<L>True, he is gone, by our brave duke's command,</L>
<L>To humble Britain's foes in foreign land:</L>
<L>Ah, what is that? the spoiler bears away</L>
<L>The only thing for which 'twas worth to stay.</L>
<L>But sorrow's dry;—I'll slake it in the brook;</L>
<L>O well-a-day! how frightful pale I look!</L>
<L>Care's a consumer (so the saying speaks)</L>
<L>The saying's true, I read it in my cheeks.</L>
<L>Fie! I'll be cheerful, 'tis a fancied pain;</L>
<L>A flame so constant cannot meet disdain:</L>
<L>I'll wash my face, and shake off foul despair,</L>
<L>My love is kind; alas! I would she were.</L>
<L>Well says our parson; and our parson said,</L>

<L>So pure the vows, which classic duty pays</L>
<L>To bless another Brunswic's rising rays!—</L>

<L>If votive verse, from sacred Isis sent,</L>

<L>With skill united, have conspir'd to twine.</L>
<L>Yes, guide and guardian of thy country's cause!</L>
<L>Thy conscious heart shall hail with just applause</L>
<L>The duteous muse, whose haste officious brings</L>
<L>Her blameless offering to the shrine of kings:</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="84"/>Thy tongue, well tutor'd in historic lore,</L>
<L>Can speak her office, and her use of yore:</L>
<L>For such the tribute of ingenuous praise</L>
<L>Her harp dispens'd in Grecia's golden days;</L>
<L>Such were the palms, in isles of old renown,</L>
<L>She cull'd to deck the guiltless monarch's crown;</L>
<L>When virtuous Pindar told, with Tuscan gore</L>
<L>How scepter'd Hiero stain'd Sicilia's shore,</L>
<L>Or to mild Theron's raptur'd eye disclos'd</L>
<L>Bright vales where spirits of the brave repos'd:</L>
<L>Yet still beneath the throne, unbrib'd, she sate,</L>
<L>The decent hand-maid, not the slave, of state;</L>
<L>Pleas'd, in the radiance of the regal name,</L>
<L>To blend the lustre of her country's fame:</L>
<L>For, taught like ours, she dar'd, with prudent pride,</L>
<L>Obedience from dependence to divide:</L>
<L>Tho' princes claim'd her tributary lays,</L>
<L>With truth severe she temper'd partial praise;</L>
<L>Conscious she kept her native dignity,</L>
<L>Bold as her flights, and as her numbers free.</L>
<L>And sure if e'er the muse indulg'd her strains,</L>
<L>With just regard, to grace heroic reigns,</L>
<L>Where could her glance a theme of triumph own</L>
<L>So dear to fame, as George's trophied throne?</L>

<L>Thy fix'd resolve renews each fair decree</L>
<L>That made, that kept of yore, thy country free.</L>

<L>Nor thine the pomp of indolent debate,</L>

<L>In vain corruption calls her venal tribes,</L>
<L>One common cause one common end prescribes:</L>
<L>Nor fear nor fraud or spares or screens the foe,</L>
<L>But spirit prompts, and valour strikes the blow.</L>
<L>O Pitt, while honour points thy liberal plan,</L>
<L>And o'er the minister exalts the man,</L>
<L>Isis cogenial greets thy faithful sway,</L>
<L>Nor scorns to bid a statesman grace her lay;</L>

<L>Each native effort of the feeling breast</L>
<L>To friends, to foes, in servile fear, supprest:</L>
<L>'Tis not for her to purchase, or pursue</L>
<L>The phantom favours of the cringing crew:</L>
<L>More useful toils her studious hours engage,</L>
<L>And fairer lessons fill her spotless page:</L>

<L>With nobler arts she forms the rising race:</L>
<L>With happier tasks, and less refin'd pretence,</L>
<L>In elder times, she woo'd munificence</L>
<L>To rear her arched roofs in regal guise,</L>
<L>And lift her temples nearer to the skies;</L>
<L>Princes and prelates stretch'd the social hand,</L>
<L>To form, diffuse, and fix her high command:</L>
<L>From kings she claim'd, yet scorn'd to seek, the prize,</L>
<L>From kings, like George, benignant, just, and wise.</L>
<L>Lo, this her genuine lore!—Nor thou refuse</L>
<L>This humble present of no partial muse</L>
<L>From that calm bower, which nurs'd thy thoughtful youth</L>
<L>In the pure precepts of Athenian truth:</L>
<L>Where first the form of British liberty</L>
<L>Beam'd in full radiance on thy musing eye;</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="87"/>That form, whose mien sublime, with equal awe,</L>
<L>In the same shade unblemish'd Somers saw:</L>
<L>Where once (for well she lov'd the friendly grove,</L>

<L>Her whispers wak'd sage Harrington to feign</L>
<L>The blessings of her visionary reign;</L>
<L>That reign, which now no more, an empty theme,</L>

<L>A maiden fair, just going to be married;</L>
<L>A good man torn from children, and from wife,</L>
<L>A general that ne'er in fight miscarried;</L>
<L>And, to complete the motly crew,</L>

<L>Profusive of expence and art,</L>

<LG>
<L>Lo! there inscrib'd the warrior's praise,</L>

<L>While Death, more justly crown'd with bays,</L>
<L>Grins horribly beneath.</L>

<L>There statesmen lie, emblazon'd forth</L>

<L>In vain, secure of deathless praise,</L>
<L>There poets ashes come,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lest too in death thy pleasant vein,</L>

<L>O Rare Ben Johnson, there is seen</L>
<L>Thy tragi-comic bust.</L>

<LG>
<L>Let Dryden's statue, there enshrin'd,</L>

<L>There Congreve too, consign'd to fame,</L>
<L>With envied lustre shine;</L>
<L>Yet who the Fair's respect can blame</L>
<L>To muse as chaste as thine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the monuments we raise</L>
<L>To future ages live,</L>
<L>Nor fond respect, nor venal praise,</L>
<L>Can conscious virtue give.</L>

<LG>
<L>When God our scatter'd dust shall call,</L>

<L>Tho', Oldfield, even in death thy fate</L>
<L>Continue still the scene,</L>

<LG>
<L>Pageants, and borrow'd pomp, display</L>
<L>(Where Albion's monarchs lie)</L>
<L>Thy fancied worth; till the last day</L>
<L>Thy real merit try.</L>

<L>For acting of another's part</L>

<HEAD>ON THE OLD BUST, WITH A SOUR AIR, ON MR. DRYDEN'S MONU∣MENT, IN WESTMINSTER-ABBEY.</HEAD>
<L>AT Dryden's tomb, inscrib'd with Sh—d's name,</L>
<L>That mite, slow offer'd to establish'd fame!</L>
<L>Fill'd with raw wonder, Tyro stopt to gaze;</L>
<L>And bless'd his bounteous Grace, in kind amaze:</L>
<L>The guardian genius, from the sacred dust,</L>
<L>Re-kindling upwards, wak'd the quickening bust,</L>
<L>Glowing from every awful feature—broke</L>
<L>Disdainful life—and thus the marble spoke:</L>
<L>" Teach thy blind love of honesty to see,—</L>
<L>" 'Tis not my monument,—tho' built on me.</L>
<L>" Great peers, 'tis known, can in oblivion lie;</L>
<L>" But no great poet has the power to die.</L>
<L>" At cheap expence, behold engrafted fame!</L>
<L>" The tack'd associate of a buoyant name.</L>
<L>" The pompous craft one lucky lord shall save;</L>
<L>" And Sh—d borrow life from Dryden's grave."</L>
<L>'Twas said—and, ere the short sensation died,</L>
<L>The stiffening marble writh'd its form aside:</L>
<L>Back from the titled waste of mouldering state</L>
<L>He turn'd—neglectful of the court, too late!</L>
<L>And, sadly conscious of mispointed praise,</L>
<L>Frowns thro' the stone, and shrinks beneath his bays.</L>

<HEAD>ON THE BIRTH-DAY OF THE LATE STEPHEN POYNTZ, ESQ.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN, WHEN AT SCHOOL.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FRiend to my life, and parent of my youth,</L>
<L>Accept with kindness, what I give with truth,</L>
<L>Accept! and know it undisguis'd by art,</L>
<L>Th' o'erflowing fullness of a grateful heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While joy returns with this returning morn,</L>
<L>And thousands bless the day that Poyntz was born,</L>
<L>Shall I alone no pious wishes send,</L>
<L>Forget the patron, and neglect the friend?</L>
<L>No;—tho' my mind no costly present prove,</L>
<L>Exalt my joy, and dignify my love,</L>
<L>Yet cheerful truth shall aid the muse to pay</L>
<L>The silent tribute of an humble lay;</L>
<L>Yet gratitude, that heaven-directed fire,</L>
<L>That muse shall raise, that humble lay inspire,</L>
<L>Glow in each thought, inspirit every line,</L>
<L>And, while it warms my breast, enliven thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, Poyntz, when, smiling on thy natal hour,</L>
<L>Friend, neighbour, child, their various blessings pour;</L>
<L><PB N="121" REF="123"/>When love, unvex'd by troubles, or by cares,</L>
<L>Hails thy fair series of revolving years,</L>
<L>Does not more real bliss thy thoughts employ?</L>
<L>Does not thy swelling heart dilate with joy?</L>
<L>Superior joy, to know those years were spent,</L>
<L>With ease and virtue, affluence and content?</L>
<L>Yes, conscious honour, with true greatness join'd,</L>
<L>Smiles in thy face, and glows within thy mind:</L>
<L>In vain, unmov'd by false deluding pride,</L>
<L>The modest breast would its own merits hide;</L>
<L>Still, gloriously conceal'd, true worth we see</L>
<L>Take double lustre from obscurity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! could I live like thee, with equal fate,</L>
<L>Politely good, and innocently great.</L>
<L>Each noble act, each generous thought, is thine;</L>
<L>Those acts, those thoughts, to imitate be mine.</L>
<L>Come thou, my guide, philosopher, and friend,</L>
<L>Conduct, improve, protect me, and defend;</L>
<L>Teach me, like thee, low fortune to despise,</L>
<L>Like thee, by virtue dignified, to rise;</L>
<L>Thro' life's calm voyage happily to steer,</L>
<L>Gay, not presuming, grave, yet not severe.</L>
<L>Together let us view the classic page,</L>
<L>The sophist's moral, and the poet's rage,</L>
<L>Pursue the calm advice, th' inspiring flame,</L>
<L>Compare, and know their generous end the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! did my humble artless breast but know</L>
<L>The piercing judgment, or the active flow;</L>
<L><PB N="122" REF="124"/>Sublime the muse should mount with stronger wing,</L>
<L>Thy peaceful worth, thy glorious toils to sing:</L>
<L>To thee, in loftier strains, the song should raise,</L>
<L>And with the friend's unite the patriot's praise.</L>
<L>Even now, whilst grateful truths my breast inflame,</L>
<L>I dare to celebrate the glorious theme,</L>
<L>And bold, the wilds of poetry explore</L>
<L>Thro' devious tracts, and paths unknown before.</L>
