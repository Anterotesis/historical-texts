<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO whom can I address these few sheets with so much pleasure and satisfaction, as to your beauteous self, who has at once taken the sole possession of my heart, and whose charms and amiable qualities have so often filled my soul with love and adoration. Therefore, dear charmer, deign to accept of this trifle (which is published with the greatest pleasure and delight, solely at your request,
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
and for your kind perusal) nor think me prone to flattery. I could wish it was more worthy your attention, but am convinced, if not from its intrinsic merit, at least for it's author's sake, you will condescend to look upon it with some little candour and respect. With these flattering hopes I take leave to subscribe myself,</P>

<P>THE following pages are the effusion of a youthful mind, and most of the articles herein contained have occasionally appeared in magazines and other periodical publications; and if, by selecting them together, the author should contribute towards the entertainment of the public (as well as to the lady he was in duty bound to oblige) he will think the pains he has taken amply rewarded, though, at the same time, he hopes the candid reader will not forget the following remark, that</P>

<P>{inverted ⁂} Notwithstanding that part of the title of this book, <HI>viz.</HI> "The Shrubs of Parnassus," is borrowed from Mr. WOTY, the author thinks it necessary to observe, that not a single line is taken or imitated from that gentleman's works.—He hears there is a small pamplet in being, called, "The Juvenile Muse," which he pretends to know nothing of.</P>

<L>BEFORE this awful court—to-night appears</L>
<L>A youth of tragic parts—yet full of fears;</L>
<L>Bashful and young, he ventures on the stage,</L>
<L>Hoping your kind attention to engage;</L>
<L>BARNWELL'S the theme, wherein he means to shew</L>
<L>That youth's misfortunes and excessive woe;</L>
<L>By which he hopes to draw a tender tear</L>
<L>From you, kind auditors, who're sitting here,</L>
<L>But ah! he fears that some stern wag will say,</L>
<L>"That stripling sure can never BARNWELL play;</L>
<L>"He has not courage, wants a bolder face</L>
<L>"To act young BARNWELL—with a decent grace."</L>
<L>But soft <HI>[pauses]</HI> I think he told me, if I'm right,</L>
<L>He dreamt a dream most wonderful last night;</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="71"/>
He thought that he was acting on the stage,</L>
<L>And, in an instant, burst into a rage,</L>
<L>On hearing of a critic—in the pit,</L>
<L>Exclaim against him—with his nauseous wit;</L>
<L>But presently he thought he was appeas'd,</L>
<L>By gen'rous friendship—which to him encreas'd;</L>
<L>'Twas Lady DOROTHY that stood his friend,</L>
<L>And with this critic did herself contend.</L>
<L>For she, quite vex'd, he thought, rose up at last,</L>
<L>And cry'd, "Sir critic, you condemn too fast;</L>
<L>"For know that I'm a judge, and sure can tell,</L>
<L>"That he's the very thing for young BARNWELL;</L>
<L>"Behold his figure, action, voice and mein,</L>
<L>"Gods! was there ever such a BARNWELL seen?</L>
<L>"By heavens for the lad I'm all on sire!</L>
<L>"For his success my heart glows with desire;</L>
<L>"Then, t'oblige me, critic, I prithee stop,</L>
<L>"And o'er your censures—let the curtain drop."</L>
<L>On these imagin'd things the youth relies,</L>
<L>For your indulgence in this enterprize;</L>
<L>And he his utmost efforts means to try,</L>
<L>For reasons many—and I'll tell you why!</L>
<L>First, then, your praises, which he hopes t'obtain;</L>
<L>Secondly, for honor, if he's not too vain;</L>
<L>And lastly, for pleasure—and some little gain.</L>

<L>MY worthy good critics attend to my lay,</L>
