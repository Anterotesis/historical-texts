<HEAD>To the Candid Reader.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a Series of Misfortunes, and meeting with the most ungenerous Treatment, from some whom I least sus∣pected, and least deserv'd it from, I feel the additional Grievance of being a Prisoner in the <HI>Fleet</HI>; tho' I have assign'd Two Thirds of my future Salary for the Payment of my Debts, if my Creditors will be so good to allow me Liberty to work for them, as well as myself: While I seem to complain of Want of Lenity in some, Gratitude obliges me to acknowledge the Favour shewn me by others; as Several, whose Demands on me are largest, have not only the Humanity to come into this Proposal themselves, but have endea∣vour'd to instil the same generous Sentiments into the rest. Yet a few are unkind enough to have continu'd me (for these five Months past) in a Place, where I am incapable of geting Bread, either for myself or Children. The Mind may be free, tho' the Body's confin'd; as a Proof of which, I employ'd a little of my Leisure in the few following Lines: If they in any Degree prove acceptable to the Publick, I am over pay'd.</P>
<P>My Impatience to attest my Loyalty and Affection to the Person of his Majesty and the present Establishment, may, perhaps, make me too quick in the Publication of what I have thus loosely thrown on Paper, and the Consciousness of my Inability to perfect the Task I have undertaken, require some Apology; — Let the Honesty of the Intention plead my Excuse: If I am found to be a good Subject, I'll not repine at being thought an indifferent Poet. I think, at this Juncture, it becomes not an <HI>Englishman</HI> to be totally silent, unwatchful, or inactive; Neutrality, at this Crisis, is a Crime: And may we not reasonably suspect those Gentry are not quite sound of Heart, who, like their politick Friend <HI>Scrub</HI> in the <HI>Stratagem,</HI> resolve
<Q REND="inline">"to say nothing till they're sure of a Peace?"</Q></P>

<L>WRONGS to redress, and Justice to maintain,</L>
<L>Has been the Business of our So∣vereign's Reign;</L>
<L>The Injur'd from Oppression's Sword to save,</L>

<L>Was the first End that Providence design'd,</L>
<L>When for Benificence she form'd his Mind.</L>
<L>Well this appear'd, when <HI>Gallic</HI> Arms, of late,</L>
<L>Join'd with <HI>Bavarian,</HI> threaten'd <HI>Europe</HI>'s Fate;</L>
<L><HI>Hungaria</HI>'s Princess desolate remain'd,</L>

<L>When her Allies fraternal were afraid,</L>
<L>To send that Queen her stipulated Aid,</L>
<L>Touch'd with Compassion, <HI>generous Brunswick</HI> came,</L>

<L>Thousands of <HI>Gauls</HI> lay stretch'd along the Plain,</L>
<L>Thousands were drown'd repassing thro' the <HI>Mayne</HI>;</L>

<L>So, when a <HI>Priest-rid Tyrant</HI> heretofore,</L>
