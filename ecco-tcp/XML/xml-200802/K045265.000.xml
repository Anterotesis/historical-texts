<HEAD>THE STATUES: OR, THE TRIAL of CONSTANCY▪</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a fair island, in the southern main,</L>
<L>Blest with indulgent skys, and kindly rain,</L>
<L>A Princess liv'd, of origin divine,</L>
<L>Of bloom coelestial, and imperial line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN that sweet season when the mounting Sun</L>
<L>Prepares, with joy, his radiant course to run,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="3"/>
Led by the Graces, and the dancing Hours,</L>
<L>And wakes to life the various race of flow'rs;</L>
<L>The lovely Queen forsook her shining court,</L>
<L>For rural scenes, and healthful Sylvan sport,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IT so befel, that, as in chearful talk,</L>
<L>Her Nymphs and She purfu'd their ev'ning walk,</L>
<L>On the green margin of the oozy deep,</L>
<L>They found a graceful Youth dissolv'd in sleep,</L>
<L>His charms the Queen survey'd with fond delight,</L>
<L>And hung enamour'd o'er the pleasing sight;</L>
<L>By her command the youth was strait convey'd,</L>
<L>And (sleeping) softly in her palace laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW ruddy morning purpled o'er the skies,</L>
<L>And beamy light unseal'd the stranger's eyes,</L>
<L>Who cry'd aloud, Ye Gods unfold this Scene!</L>
<L>Where am I? what can all these wonders mean?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>SCARCE had he spoke, when, with officious care,</L>
<L>Attendant nymphs a fragrant bath prepare;</L>
<L>He rose, he bath'd, and on his lovely head,</L>
<L>Ambrosial sweets, and precious oyl they shed;</L>
<L>To deck his polish'd limbs, a robe they brought,</L>
<L>In all the various dies of beauty wrought;</L>
<L>Then led him to the Queen, who, on a throne</L>
<L>Of burnish'd gold, and beamy diamonds shone:</L>
<L>But O what wonder selz'd her beauteous guest!</L>
<L>What love, what extasy his soul possest!</L>
<L>Entranc'd he stood, and on his falt'ring tongue,</L>
<L>Imperfect words, and half form'd accents hung▪</L>
<L>Nor less the Queen the blooming youth admir'd,</L>
<L>Nor less delight, and love, her soul inspir'd.</L>
<L>O Stranger! said the Queen, if hither driv'n,</L>
<L>By adverse winds, or sent a guest from Heav'n;</L>
<L>To me the wretched never sue in vain,</L>
<L>This fruitful isle with joy approves my reign;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Then speak thy wishes, and thy wants declare,</L>
<L>And no denial shall attend thy pray'r:</L>
<L>She paus'd, and blush'd; the youth his silence broke,</L>
<L>And kneeling, thus the charming Queen bespoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O GODDESS! for a form so bright as thine,</L>
<L>Speaks thee descended of coelestial line▪</L>
<L>Low at your feet a prostrate King behold,</L>
<L>Whose faithless subjects sold his life for gold;</L>
<L>I fly a cruel tyrant's lawless hand,</L>
<L>And storms have drove my vessel on your strand:</L>
<L>But why do I complain of Fortune's frowns?</L>
<L>Or what are titles! honours! sceptres! crowns!</L>
<L>To this sweet moment? whilst in fond amaze,</L>
<L>On such transporting excellence I gaze!</L>
<L>Such symetry of shape! so fair a face!</L>
<L>Such finish'd elegance! such perfect grace!</L>
<L>Hear then my only wish, and O approve</L>
<L>The ardent pray'r, which supplicates thy love.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>
From <HI>Neptune,</HI> know, O Prince, my birth I claim,</L>
<L>Replies the Queen, and <HI>Lucida</HI>'s my name;</L>
<L>This island, these attendant nymphs he gave</L>
<L>The fair-hair'd daughters of the azure wave:</L>
<L>But he whose fortune gains me for a bride,</L>
<L>Must have his constancy severely try'd;</L>
<L>One day each moon am I compell'd to go</L>
<L>To my Great Father's wat'ry realms below,</L>
<L>Where coral groves coelestial red display,</L>
<L>And blazing di'monds emulate the day;</L>
<L>In this short absence if your love endures,</L>
<L>My heart and empire are for ever your's;</L>
<L>And hoary <HI>Neptune,</HI> to reward your truth,</L>
<L>Shall crown you with immortal bloom and youth;</L>
<L>But instant death will on your falshood wait,</L>
<L>Nor can my tenderness prevent your fate:</L>
<L>Twice twenty times in wedlock's sacred band,</L>
<L>My Royal Father join'd my plighted hand;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
Twice twenty noble youths, alas! are dead,</L>
<L>Who in my absence stain'd the nuptial bed;</L>
<L>Your virtues, Prince, may claim a nobler throne;</L>
<L>But mine is yielded on these terms alone.</L>
<L>Delightful terms! reply'd the raptur'd youth,</L>
<L>Accept my constancy, my endless truth:</L>
<L>Perfidious, faithless men, enrag'd he cry'd!</L>
<L>They merited the fate by which they dy'd:</L>
<L>Accept a heart incapable of change;</L>
<L>Thy beauty shall forbid desire to range.</L>
<L>No other form shall to my eye seem fair;</L>
<L>No other voice attract my list'ning ear;</L>
<L>No charms but thine, shall e'er my soul approve;</L>
<L>So aid thy vot'ry, potent God of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW loud applauses thro' the palace ring;</L>
<L>The duteous subjects hail their God-like King;</L>
<L>To feastful mirth they dedicate the day,</L>
<L>Whilst tuneful voices chant the nuptial lay:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>
Love-dittied-airs, hymn'd by the vocal quire,</L>
<L>Sweetly attemper'd to the warbling wire.</L>
<L>But when the Sun descending sought the main,</L>
<L>And low-brow'd night assum'd her silent reign,</L>
<L>They to the marriage-bed convey'd the Bride,</L>
<L>And laid the raptur'd Bridegroom by her side.</L>
<L>Now rose the morn, and with auspicious ray,</L>
<L>Dispell'd the dewy mists, and gave the day;</L>
<L>When <HI>Lucida,</HI> with anxious cares opprest,</L>
<L>Thus wak'd her sleeping lord from downy rest,</L>
<L>Soul of my soul, and monarch of my heart,</L>
<L>This day, she cry'd, this fatal day, we part;</L>
<L>Yet, if your love uninjur'd you retain,</L>
<L>We soon shall meet in happiness again,</L>
<L>To part no more, but rolling years employ,</L>
<L>In circling bliss, and never-fading joy:</L>
<L>Alas! my boding soul is lost in woe!</L>
<L>And from my eyes the tears unbidden flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<L>JOY of my life, dismiss those needless fears,</L>
<L>Reply'd the King, and stay those precious tears;</L>
<L>Shou'd lovely <HI>Venus</HI> leave her native sky,</L>
<L>And at my feet, imploring fondness, lie,</L>
<L>Ev'n she, the radiant Queen of soft desires,</L>
<L>Shou'd, disappointed, burn with hopeless fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE heart of Man, the Queen's experience knew</L>
<L>Perjur'd, and false, yet wish'd to find him true:</L>
<L>She sigh'd, retiring; and, in regal state,</L>
<L>The King conducts her to the palace gate,</L>
<L>Where sacred <HI>Neptune's</HI> chrystal chariot stands,</L>
<L>The wond'rous work of his coelestial hands;</L>
<L>Six harness'd swans the bright machine convey,</L>
<L>Swift thro' the air, or pathless wat'ry way;</L>
<L>The birds with eagle-speed the air divide,</L>
<L>And plunge the goddess in the sounding tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
<L>SLOW to the court the pensive King returns,</L>
<L>And sighs in secret, and in silence mourns;</L>
<L>So in the grove sad Philomel complains,</L>
<L>In mournful accents, and melodious strains;</L>
<L>Her plaintive woes fill the resounding lawn,</L>
<L>From starry-vesper, to the rosy dawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE King, to mitigate his tender pain,</L>
<L>Seeks the apartment of the virgin train,</L>
<L>With sportive mirth sad absence to beguile,</L>
<L>And bid the melancholly moments smile;</L>
<L>But there deserted, lonely rooms he found;</L>
<L>And solitary silence reign'd around:</L>
<L>He call'd aloud, when, lo! a hag appears,</L>
<L>Bending beneath deformity and years;</L>
<L>Who said, My Liege, explain your sacred will,</L>
<L>With joy your sovereign purpose I fulfil.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11"/>
My will! detested wretch! avoid my sight,</L>
<L>And hide that hideous shape in endless night.</L>
<L>What? does thy Queen, o'er-run with rude distrust,</L>
<L>Resolve by force to keep a husband just?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU wrong, reply'd the hag, your royal wife,</L>
<L>Whose care is love, and love to guard your life;</L>
<L>The race of mortals are by nature frail,</L>
<L>And strong temptations with the best prevail.</L>
<L>Be that my care, he said; be thine, to send</L>
<L>The virgin train, let them my will attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Beldam fled, the chearful Nymphs advance,</L>
<L>And tread to measur'd airs, the mazy dance;</L>
<L>The raptur'd Prince, with greedy eye surveys</L>
<L>The bloomy maids, and covets still to gaze;</L>
<L>No more recals the image of his spouse,</L>
<L>(How false is Man!) nor recollects his vows;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12"/>
With wild inconstancy for all he burns,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Nymph subdues his soul by turns.</L>
<L>At length a maid superior to the rest,</L>
<L>Array'd in smiles, in virgin beauty drest,</L>
<L>Receiv'd his passion, and return'd his love,</L>
<L>And softly woo'd him to the silent grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ENCLOS'D in deepest shade of full-grown wood,</L>
<L>Within the grove a spacious grotto stood,</L>
<L>Where forty youths in marble seem'd to mourn,</L>
<L>Each youth reclining on a fun'ral urn;</L>
<L>Thither the Nymph directs the Monarch's way;</L>
<L>He treads her footsteps, joyful to obey;</L>
<L>There, fir'd with passion, clasp'd her to his breast,</L>
<L>And thus the transport of his soul exprest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DELIGHTFUL beauty! deck'd with ev'ry charm</L>
<L>High fancy paints, or glowing love can form,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13"/>
I sigh, I gaze, I tremble, I adore,</L>
<L>Such lovely looks ne'er blest my eyes before!</L>
<L>Here, under covert of th' embow'ring shade,</L>
<L>For Love's delights, and tender transports made,</L>
<L>No busy eye our raptures to detect,</L>
<L>No envious tongue to censure or direct,</L>
<L>Here yield to Love, and tenderly employ</L>
<L>The silent season in extatick joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH arms enclasp'd, his treasure to retain,</L>
<L>He sigh'd and strove, but strove and sigh'd in vain;</L>
<L>She rush'd indignant from his fond embrace,</L>
<L>Whilst rage, with blushes, paints her virgin face;</L>
<L>Yet still he sues, with suppliant hands and eyes;</L>
<L>Whilst she to magick charms for vengeance flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A LIMPID fountain murmur'd thro' the cave;</L>
<L>She fill'd her palm with the translucent wave,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="14"/>
And, sprinkling, cry'd, Receive, false man, in time▪</L>
<L>The just reward of thy detested crime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THY changeful sex in perfidy delight,</L>
<L>Despise perfection, and fair virtue slight;</L>
<L>False, fickle, base, tyrannick, and unkind,</L>
<L>Whose hearts nor vows can chain, nor honour bind,</L>
<L>Mad to possess, by passion blindly led,</L>
<L>And then as mad, to stain the nuptial bed;</L>
<L>Whose roving souls no excellence, no age,</L>
<L>No form, no rank, no beauty, can engage:</L>
<L>Slaves to the bad, to the deserving worst,</L>
<L>Sick of your twentieth love, as of your first.</L>
<L>These STATUES, which this hallow'd grot adorn,</L>
<L>Like thee were Lovers, and like thee forsworn;</L>
<L>Whose faithless hearts no kindness cou'd secure,</L>
<L>Nor for a day preserve their passion pure;</L>
<L>Whom neither love, nor beauty, cou'd restrain,</L>
<L>Nor fear of endless infamy and pain.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="15"/>
Now feel the force of heav'ns avenging hand,</L>
<L>And here inanimate for ever stand!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SHE spoke—amaz'd the list'ning monarch stood;</L>
<L>And icy horror froze his ebbing blood!</L>
<L>Thick shades of death upon his eyelids creep,</L>
<L>And clos'd them fast in everlasting sleep;</L>
<L>No sense of life, no motion he retains,</L>
<L>But fix'd, a dreadful monument remains!</L>
<L>A STATUE now! and if reviv'd once more,</L>
<L>Wou'd prove, no doubt, as CONSTANT as before▪</L>
