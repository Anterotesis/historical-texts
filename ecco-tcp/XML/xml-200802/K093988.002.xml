<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SET off in <HI>Thursday</HI>'s Stage, the 25th Instant; and beg you will get some Lodging for me.</P>
<P>I received a Letter from you on <HI>Saturday</HI> last, and another this Day: And, first, of the first. I am very glad you got safe to Town: But why all this Plaintiveness? Why will you eternally doubt my Tenderness for
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
you? Observe, that there is a childish, and a manly one: Perhaps I am a Child in every thing else; and then one may suspect, if I do not appear so in this, it is because I want the Feeling: But if you will allow me to be a Man in other Things, why will you not judge of me all together? If my Letters and Behaviour differ, it is because one proceeds from the Senti∣ments I have toward you, and the other from a certain Nonchalance, or Want of Earnestness in my Manners, which has been often mis∣interpreted.</P>
<P>What you say with regard to Love and Friendship is certainly just, as it is ingenious also. The Pleasures of those Affections are the greatest Enjoyments of Life: How careful ought we then to be to cherish them in their proper Season! which does not extend even so far as you mention: And yet we have a long Life to labour through after that Aera, which would lag heavily along without those Helps.</P>
<P>The Opinion of a continued Converse after Death has been often disputed, and by me too: But I will come over to your Sentiment, for this conclusive Reason; We are to be happy after Death. Providence always acts by the most continued, uniform, and constant Means. Love and Friendship are the highest Enjoyments of Mortals: They are likewise in the Series of Virtue. Would it not be Caprice in Provi∣dence,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
to give us new Objects, and strange Affections, when we can be made as happy by the Improvement of the former, as by the Enjoyment of any other? I will never change my Opinion more on this Subject, for your Sake, my sweet Girl, whose Charms (pardon the Quibble) I wish to enjoy, both above and below; and in that Wish I live, and in that Hope I die,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXI. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I have been, ever since I came to Town, overwhelmed with Business, I cannot say that I am displeased at this Embarras du Monde, as it prevents my having Leisure to indulge gloomy Reflections, which are the cer∣tain Consequence of Indolence and Inactivity: And, though my Spirits are too weak to bear much Fatigue, I would prefer the most labo∣rious Life to the melancholy Hours I sometimes pass; not for Want of Employment, but Reso∣lution to employ myself.</P>
<P>I am, however, far from being satisfied with my present Condition; for I, almost hourly,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
find the Want of a reasonable Companion; who, by participating in my Concerns, or ap∣proving my Actions, would double my Assi∣duity, and, of course, my Success. And this leads me to mention two Things I have often thought of—First, Providence certainly designed us social Creatures; and that our greatest Hap∣piness on Earth, and strongest Pursuit, is the Enjoyment of a rational and tender Friendship; which cannot be attained without devoting the greatest and best Part of our Lives to this single Purpose; for I am thoroughly con∣vinced, that sincere Love, or real Friendship, never was contracted after the Age of Forty: The Mind then takes another Turn, grows callous to the tender, soft Impressions of Hu∣manity, and is in Pursuit of Enjoyments directly opposite to those, the first, and best—unless before engaged in the dear Tyes of Husband, or of Friend; if so, each Day adds Strength to the blest Union, and steals the Sting from Sorrow and from Care. Can we then, my dearest Life, without arraigning the Goodness and Wisdom of the divine Being, suppose that, from the highest Excellence of our Nature, we should be engaged in laudable Pursuits, which are to take up the best and happiest Part of our Lives; and that, after having been at innu∣merable Pains to obtain them, the Enjoyment should cease, just when we are capable of it,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
by putting off this frail Mortality? No—it cannot be! With thee I'll range the liquid Fields of Air, wander through all the Immensity of Bliss, and find none equal to thy dear So∣ciety; so fix my Heaven there.</P>
<P>I grow quite an Enthusiast on this Subject, and, of course, talk an infinite deal of Nonsense; but sure you will excuse me, when I solemnly declare, I have no Idea of Happiness, either in this World or the next, unshared by thee.</P>
<P>The second Thing I have to mention is, my Surprize at your being able to live so long alone; "for, in Unequals, what Society?" And sure you appear to me like <HI>Adam,</HI> before
<Q>the last and best of all God's Works</Q>
was formed, dignified with, and conscious of that Superiority he felt, amidst his vassal Brutes: Yet could Equality alone render Society agreeable to you, you must, indeed, condemn yourself to a per∣petual Solitude; for, in that Case, I know not where it would be possible for you to find a Companion.</P>
<P>I am but just come home from Lady —'s. My Watch lies on the Table, and points to Twelve; so I must bid you a thousand Times Good-Night!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Elton.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM come so far on my Way to <HI>London,</HI> and shall be able to receive just one Letter from you, before I leave it. My Uncle is in the Gout, which will not mend his Temper; and the three Women, I left behind me, are in a hopeful Way with him, and he, of consequence, extremely unhappy with them; for Providence has ordered it's eternal Laws so equitably, that whoever makes another unhappy, by Perverseness of Temper, makes himself no less so. I have more Indulgence for great Vices, than for this peevish, unsociable Humour, which Men ab∣surdly contract at that Stage of Life, when they stand most in need of all the friendly, amusing, and social Helps, to aid them through. The other Vices have Nature on their Side, or Al∣lurements and Temptations, to excuse them; but Moroseness is contrary to Nature, (who diffuses Chearfulness among all her Works) and is also a Self-torment in the very Exercise. As I have often said, I look'd upon Chearfulness to be an Hymn to Providence, as well as a strong Indication of a virtuous Mind, so, I am almost bold to affirm, that Ill-humour is Blasphemy in the Act, and a moral Vice in the Disposition:
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Nay, to prove it a Vice, by the strict Rules of Logic, I affirm it to be a Thing diametrically opposite to the Nature of Virtue; for, as that is it's own Reward, this is it's own Punishment.</P>
<P>It is observed by <HI>Addison,</HI> that few People have all the Qualities requisite to render Life agreeable: But there are two indispensably ne∣cessary, which are in every one's Power; Chearfulness and Constancy. Now he who wants either of these, should be condemned; while those, who fall short in the Gifts of Nature, ought only to be pitied. Here it may be proper to say something in my own Defence, who seem to labour under this Rule, in <HI>some People</HI>'s Opinion; but observe, that there may be Chearfulness without Mirth, and Constancy with Professing.</P>

<P>IT may seem idle to write you a Letter now, which you will get but a few Hours before I see you; but I do it, perhaps, to shew you, I have not so paltry a Consideration for you, as
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
the saving you a Groat; though I am sure, as I have no Letter of your's to answer, that I shall not be able to say any thing which can defray the Expence.</P>
<P>Our Assizes ended this Day, by the Execu∣tion of all the Condemned; among whom was <HI>Johnson,</HI> a Rogue of some Consequence. When I heard the Guards coming down the Street, I retired to a back Room, as it is not a Spectacle I care to look on; but, considering it as an Object which might give Occasion to some useful Reflections, I returned, and saw them pass by. The first Thought which occurred to me was, that I should be glad to have been, for some Time, in their Situation, out of Curiosity, to know how a Man feels, or imagines, in such shocking Circumstances; for the mere Descrip∣tion of any thing does not sufficiently satisfy me. I should be also glad, more particularly, to know how I should behave myself, upon such an Occasion; whether I should feel myself most concerned for my Crime, or shocked at the Punishment; whether my Hopes, through the Merit of Repentance, would be sufficient to sup∣port me through the Terrors; if the Shame, or Pain, would afflict me most; whether I should act like a Madman, or a Fool; and, lastly, whether I could have Strength of Mind sufficient to support that calm and philosophic Temper at my Death, which great Part of my Life has
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
been laid out in endeavouring to attain. With regard to the Wretches themselves, I had one comfortable Reflection, which will henceforward take off greatly from the Shock, which Execu∣tions of this Kind give to the humane Mind: That few of such Creatures ever reclaim of themselves; but, proceeding in a Series of Ini∣quities, die without Repentance. In this the executed Malefactor has a great Advantage above the Rogue who escapes. The condemned Man has that Benefit which the Psalmist prays for so emphatically:
<Q>Teach me, O Lord, so to number my Days, that I may apply my Heart unto Wisdom!</Q>
And I think, that the highest Crimes, sincerely repented of, shall meet more Favour in the next World, than lesser Offences, unattoned by Sorrow and Contrition. I shall pursue these Gallows Meditations no farther; but only observe to you, the powerful Effect of this great Salvo of Repentance, towards the per∣fect Quietism of a Mind, the least imbued with Religion, though untutored by Philosophy, in the Instance of <HI>Johnson,</HI> this Day; who, just before he mounted the Ladder, declared he would not change his present Situation with any Man in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM, at present, sitting in the midst of a large Field of Barley, which I reaped the other Day; and am taking Care of the Binders and Stackers: There are forty-seven Women, and fourteen Men, at Work round about me, while I am reading <HI>Pliny,</HI> and writing to you.</P>
<P>I think Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Comment upon the seventh Epistle is extremely fine. The eighth Epistle of <HI>Pliny</HI> has a great Nobleness of Senti∣ment, and a particular Justness of Thought. I love the fine Struggle between natural Vanity, and the Contempt of Praise; which is obvious through the whole Letter. It may be Stoicism, if you please; but I never will admit any Pre∣tence to Virtue to be true Heroism, which seems to be above human Nature, 'till it has first shewn its Strife with the Frailties of it. The ninth Epistle was always a Favourite of mine: But there was a Note I expected from Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> upon this Passage,
<Q>Thou art <HI>almost</HI> preferable,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is no Doubt but <HI>Pliny,</HI> if he had consulted his own Taste and Inclinations, would have left out that Adverb, and put in <HI>omnino,</HI> or <HI>altogether</HI>: But the Philo∣sophers
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
were obliged to speak of the tranquil Joys of retired Contemplation, and learned Leisure, with some Caution and Reserve; either because the Antients had so often spoken, and written, in such Raptures of these Pleasures, that the World had got into a Kind of Enthu∣siasm, which alarmed Governments and States; and the more particularly for this Reason, that those Men, who are fittest for the World, are most fond of retiring from it; or else <HI>Pliny</HI> moderated his ecstatic Soliloquy, because he could not think a Man, who was retired from all Business, could be quite so virtuous, or, at least, capable of exercising so much Virtue, as one who employed himself in the Affairs of this World; for some Part of the Duty of a Man, born a social Creature, must be neglected.</P>
<P>In the Comment upon the tenth Epistle, there is poetical Wit in the Allusion to <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Shield. There is an Expression in the same Comment, which I think exceptionable: Speaking of the young Men among the <HI>Romans,</HI> he calls them <HI>Gentlemen</HI>; which, being a modern Phrase, is improperly applied, when we are speaking of the Antients.</P>
<P>The Observations upon the eleventh Epistle are very pretty, and very just; and please me particularly, because they flatter me about a Sentiment you may remember of mine, that
<Q><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Absence to Friends, like Death to Enemies, buries every Fault, and enlivens every Virtue.</Q></P>
<P>In the last Paragraph of the Comment upon the 20th Epistle, there is a good deal of Wit and Justness in the Simile of Lightning. There is also something extremely pretty in the Anno∣tation to the second Epistle of the second Book, in the Allusion to the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. The sixth Epistle of the same Book pleases me much. I have been always offended, when I have seen such improper and paltry Distinctions at very good Tables, which I have often done; and always made it a Rule with myself, to take Part with the despised Guest, which has some∣times had the proper Effect upon the Enter∣tainer.</P>
<P>I received your Letter, with Lady —'s in∣closed, and am much obliged to her for re∣membering me, which it seems she does, by mentioning Lord —. I know already, that I am not to expect any thing from her Kind∣ness, in that Particular; for I mentioned to you before Mr. —'s Answer to my Letter, on that Head. Now, as I have a Way of profiting something from every Disappointment in Life, I shall, from this, have the Satisfaction of feeling the grateful Sense of Lady —'s Patronage, pure and unmixed, for the Friendship she de∣signed me; whereas, had I succeeded, my Acknowledgments might be looked upon
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
rather as a Rejoicing at the Emoluments of it, than a Gratitude for the Favour itself.</P>
<P>Now have at her Ladyship's <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A Paragraph of a Letter, inquiring after three or four Persons, under the Characters of A, B, C, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Criss-Cross— A, then, is <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> B is <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> C spends his. Time between Books, Music, and the Business of his Farms; has, indeed, an un∣comfortable Prospect, with Regard to his For∣tunes; but has a certain Sturdiness in his Na∣ture, which helps to keep up his Spirits. He has that happy Constitution and Turn of Mind, that, contemplating every Fortune or Accident in this Life, as he hopes to do when he is out of it, he regards each Incident of it as a Man should do,
<Q>at the Hour of Death, or in the Day of Judgment;</Q>
so that he is resolved to regulate his present Actions upon that Plan, which the Ages, some Centuries hence, (should his Memory last so long,) shall approve, or, at least, not condemn; when all Prejudices, private Interests, or partial Connections, shall be no more. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>The fourth Letter in the Alphabet is, of course, D; but either the Carelessness of her Ladyship's Typography, or my own ready Adaption of the Letter, has made me fix on O, which, from the Figure, being the most perfect in Geometry, seems to bear the nearest Analogy to the Person decyphered by it. O! may our Loves, our Joys, our Days, end, like the Circle, as they have begun! (for I keep no Record of Time before our first Acquaintance) and may our Wishes, like that too, have but one common Center!</P>
<P>I am concerned at your Apprehensions about Lady <HI>L</HI>—'s Face; but more for her as a Child, than as a Woman: For Beauty is desirable, when we can expect nothing better; but a Woman may be amiable, without a Symmetry of Features; which I cannot instance in you, because I think you handsome; but Lady — may fill the Example, as she was never reckoned a Beauty: And may the Mother's Fortune at∣tend the Child, to miss a Fop, and gain a Man of Sense!</P>
<P>I am sorry for the Accident which happened to your Eye: But, if it ends only in a Blemish, I am quite easy; for Mens sana in Corpore sano completes all my Wishes, with Regard to you.</P>

<P>YOU speak too humbly, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> about your Person: It is, to my Liking, amiable; and no Comparison can render it otherwise to me, but that of your Understand∣ing: And, though Age, or Sickness, may forfeit your common Admirers,
<Q>Best quitted with Disdain;</Q>
yet your Charms, to me, must still remain: For, though the setting Sun (to use a bold Ex∣pression) <HI>annihilates</HI> the <HI>Shadow,</HI> the Substance still remains the same.</P>
<P>I am sorry you had nothing more particular to tell me, in your last, about <HI>our</HI> Lady —; <HI>which</HI> is a fond Expression among the Antients, signifying a particular Regard, or Friendship, to any Person.</P>
<P>I have got home the fine Edition of the <HI>Spectators</HI> I promised to send you. The Papers, I design to make Part of a Collection, (hinted to you in a former Letter,) which I mean to intitle, "The Solamen Miseris, or Cordial of Adversity," are, Numbers 210, 213, the latter Part of 225, 257, 289, 312, 381, 387, 408, 447, 459, 465, 471, 487, 494, 495, 513, 519, 520, 531, 537, 543, 571, 600, 601, 615, 621, 624, 626, 628, 633, 634, and 635. There are but four Papers in the <HI>Tatlers</HI> to be added to them: Number 89, the first Part of Number
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
170, Number 135, and 211. I have not looked into the <HI>Guardians</HI> lately, but shall soon do it, with a View to this humane and useful Work. Writings of this Kind have admirable Effects upon a Mind rightly turned: They have quelled all Ambition in me: They have recon∣ciled me to Poverty, rendered me luke-warm to Fame, have comforted me in Affliction, have even alleviated Pain, and taken away the Ter∣rors of Death: At the same Time, they have enlivened my Hope, enlarged my Views, and opened such a glorious Prospect into Eternity, that the Mind's Eye but carelessly glances over every Object, which lies intermediate to it; yet not with such an intemperate Enthusiasm, as to hinder a thorough Resignation to the Dispen∣sations of Providence; for I contemplate the Joys of Eternity, without any Impatience for the Possession of them; which is owing to the ad∣mirable Contrivance of the Almighty, who has given us such a Self-Conviction of the Pleasures of Hereafter, as may make us rest in Hope; but restrained us from such a Sense of them, as might render us impatient in our Wishes.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXVI. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT a Scene of tranquil Happiness does my dear practic Philosopher's Letter present me with! How earnestly, how passionately do I wish to share those rational Delights, which he can, at once, partake and inspire! How "<HI>altogether preferable</HI>" should I think it, to be seated by him on an Hillock of Hay, contemplating the Works of Nature, while he deduced each obvious Effect from it's first great Principle; and made me lose all Wonder, in Praise and Gratitude to that Almighty Being, who first created, and then made him mine!</P>
<P>I say, how much should I prefer that happy Situation to a Throne, without thee, thou dearest and most charming of thy Sex! Nor will I doubt, that my sharing would enhance the Pleasures of Retirement; for Solitude's the Nurse of Love, as well as Contemplation; and I am very sure, were we to live but a few Months in a calm settled Way together, you would be infinitely fonder of me than you are, or can be, at present; as I make no doubt but we should then experience the charming Theory you have somewhere laid down:
<Q>Chearfulness without Mirth, Gravity without Spleen, and
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
the warmest Love with the highest Esteem.</Q>
—You will, perhaps, be surprized, when I tell you, that I now rejoice at what I have some∣times looked on as the greatest Misfortune of my Life; that we have not lived together. We should have been miserable, if that had hap∣pened two Years ago. It is but a very short Time, since I became thoroughly acquainted with you: That Knowledge has increased my Love and Esteem for you. You have intro∣duced me to myself: Need I say, that, by knowing myself, I have triumphed over my greatest Foible? And sure I cannot err greatly, after your pointing out my Faults, when I declare, in the Sincerity of my Heart, that I have no Will of my own, nor Wish, but that of rendering my little Self agreeable to you.—If it were not a Work of Supererogation, I could even wish that I had greater Failings to surmount, as they would be a still stronger Proof of your Love and mine.</P>
<P>Though I remember the Subject of each par∣ticular Letter you mention in <HI>Pliny,</HI> I will not pretend to speak my Sentiments, as I have not the Books by me; if I had, I should certainly start Objections, for the Pleasure of being re∣futed by you.</P>
<P>I have not been at the Rock these ten Days: I have lain in <HI>Bond-Street</HI> since I came to Town, and am almost killed with Raking. I shall not
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
leave <HI>London</HI> 'till <HI>Kitty</HI> does. I know you will be a little angry with this Account of myself, 'till you recollect, that I have not seen her for some Months, and that the greatest Part of our Conversation is about you; which being a Sub∣ject I shall never be weary of, I cannot think of quitting it without Reluctance.</P>
<P>With your's I received a long Letter from Lady —. I think, according to your Defi∣nition of it, the Letter O is much better adapted to her than to me; for she is, indeed, the Center of female Perfection. By her Desire, I inclose you Lord —'s Letter. Nothing can be more elegant than your Sentiments, with Regard to her Intentions to serve you.</P>
<P>I am vastly anxious to know what you have determined about <HI>Belvidere.—Kitty</HI> is tearing the Pen out of my Hand: When shall I be able to write, or converse with you, sans Interruption? I can no longer withstand the Riot round me; but, though they force my Hand away, my Heart is unalterably your's.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the Post for this Day is not come in, I do not know yet, whether you leave Town To-morrow or no; therefore I shall write to you, because I would not spare myself any Trouble certain, for even the Chance of giving you a Quarter of an Hour's Amusement.</P>
<P>I met with a small Treatise Yesterday, intitled, "On the Employment of Time." It is wrote by <HI>Gilbert West.</HI> I think it is very well <HI>collected</HI>; for, indeed, it is mostly a Heap of Quotations, and shews more of Learning than Understand∣ing: For a Work of this Kind almost any Man may <HI>compile,</HI> who reads with a Common-place Book by him.</P>
<P><HI>Young,</HI> the Satirist, has two very severe Lines against Quotations, which, for that Reason, I shall not recite; and there is certainly nothing so tiresome to the Reader as Writings of that Kind, which are only to be admitted in Works of Fancy, but not at all necessary upon moral or philosophical Subjects. For Example; If Mr. <HI>West</HI> speaks Sense or Reason, what Occasion is there to inform us, that <HI>Cicero</HI> thought the same Way, or said the same Thing? It is Argument, not Authority, which convinces. All Know∣ledge
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
is derived originally from the human Understanding; and a Thought is nevertheless our own, because it has been hit on by some∣body else before: And one may as well quote <HI>Adam</HI> for breathing, because he was the first Creature who did so, as <HI>Euclid</HI> for saying that the three Angles of every Triangle are equal to two right ones, because, he was the first Person who demonstrated that Proposition.</P>
<P>A quoting Author is just as ridiculous as a Country Girl, who, upon her first coming to Town, being decked out by the Help of her Friends, should make public Acknowledgment from whom she had her Stockings, her Shift, her Stays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that, if every Person was there to claim their own; she would be left as naked as the Jay in the Fable, or as such a pye∣bald Author, say Writer rather, say Complier, say Publisher, say second-hand Cook, who gives you a Beggar's Dish out of Fragments, or say Printer's Sign-Post, upon which are pasted the heterogeneous Scraps of many Authors.</P>
<P>I remember a stupid Sort of Fellow, who used to put me in mind of these Men, who are too modest to say any Thing of their own; for he never asked for Bread, Drink, told you what o'Clock it was, or mentioned even the most trifling Occurrence, without adding,
<Q>as the Man said:</Q>
And whenever he had a mind, like these Men, to shew the Extent of his
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Learning, by recurring up to the most antient Authority, he would cry,
<Q>as the Man said <HI>a great while ago.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Importance of the Subject, which Mr. <HI>West</HI> treats on, is great, and ought to be the frequent Reflection of every Man of Sense, Morality, or Religion. He has considered it with Regard to the two last, and placed the Matter in several very strong Lights: But, as a Thing of this Consequence cannot stand in too many Points of View, I shall attempt to consider it with Relation to the first, merely as a rational Man, without any Regard to Virtue; relative only to our present State, and, in that Respect, confined intirely to ourselves: Which few Hints you may stile, <HI>Of the Oeconomy of Time</HI>—Of the simple Enlargement of it—Or, a certain Method to lengthen Life, in Spight of Fate, or of the Grave.</P>
<P>There is an Expression often made use of by thoughtless People, which astonishes and provokes me extremely;
<Q>Let us do so and so, to kill Time.</Q>
It is some Revenge, however, to observe, what Suicides they are, at the same Time of this most horrid and unnatural Murder: So true it is, that We and our Time must live and die together. We generally lament the Shortness of Man's Life taken together, while we are blaming the Tediousness of every Portion of it. This Contradiction may be accounted
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
for, if we consider, that as Time, unemployed, lags heavily along, an idle Person, for this Reason, must complain of tiresome Days; and as Duration is marked only by the Succession of Ideas, his Life must appear shortest, who has fewest Actions or Passages to recollect.</P>
<P>To consider Man, then, only with Regard to this Life; What a miserable Wretch must he be, whose passing Minutes are told as so many Hours, and whose past Years are reflected upon but as so many Days!</P>
<P>Let us then, as rational Creatures, contrive so to employ ourselves in a Series of Actions, which, by marking every Period of our Lives, we may enjoy this great and happy Advantage, that the present Moments shall glide imper∣ceptibly away, and our past Age appear so long, upon summing up, that we may not murmur at the short Span "of threescore Years and ten."</P>
<Q>O Vita Stulto longa, Sapienti brevis!</Q>
<P>Again, 'tis computed, that the generality of Men sleep away about one Third of their Time, that is, about eight Hours in the twenty-four. Now five Hours is full sufficient for any Person, who would preserve Health of Body, and Vigour of Mind: So that there may be above three Hours saved out of every Day, which is about one Day in the Week, and that is one Year in seven. Then, by the Time a Man has reached
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
his grand Climacteric, he may be said to have lived just nine Years more than some of his twin Cotemporaries.</P>
<P>What would a Man give for nine Years added to sixty-three! How much more valuable are nine Years before sixty-three! for surely that Time is the most preferable, which we can live without growing older. We cannot, indeed, borrow Time from Death; but we can take it from it's Semblance, Sleep — Which brings me to the Close of my Proposition, or
<Q>a certain Method to lengthen Life, in Spight of Fate, or the Grave.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read the Treatise you mention, but like your Supplement to it much better. It is a double Charity to write to me on Subjects at present, because there is not a Book in this House, which could supply me with Matter for a Minute's Reflection; which makes the Time, except what I spend in reading your Letters, or writing to you, pass like an idle Dream, which leaves no Trace behind.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>Your Letter has made me grow quite im∣patient at the Reflection of having lost so much of my Life. The Desire of improving my Mind, and fixing it's Contemplation upon proper Objects, increases daily; yet, by some unforeseen Accident, I find myself continually deprived even of one Day's Retirement, and am, if I may use the Expression, constantly immersed in Idleness.</P>
<P>The Tediousness of present Time is often irksome to the wise Man as well as the Fool, though not in so great a Degree; which has been considered as a Proof of the Soul's Immor∣tality: For we are continually pushing forward to some Point of Time, which, when arrived at, falls short of the Expectations we had raised upon it; we still persist in flattering ourselves, and fix our Happiness on some future Period, which, in it's Course, brings Disappointment too; and yet we still go on, wishing the present Hour were past, and hoping Peace or Joy from some more distant Aera; 'till the Grave open∣ing, interrupts our Schemes, and shews the only Prospect where the Soul can rest. Oh! may we fix our Grasp on that Strong-Hold, which cannot, will not fail us; and, like the Patriarch, wrestle for a Blessing! Let the incumbering World recede, and even our mutual Loves decay, before the glorious Hope of Immortality! What Joy, what more than Transport, do I
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
feel, in thinking that, when Death shall have dissolved the poor, infirm, and feeble Forms, which now incase our Spirits, we shall meet again, conscious of each other's Love and Truth, in perfect Bliss above!</P>
<P>I do not cordially approve of your lessening the Portions of Time allotted for Sleep. It is wise Nature prompts, and all Philosophy is vain which dares oppose her. She has appointed equal Periods to Labour and to Rest; while Man, impatient to be happy, steals from his only promised Blessing, Ease, to squander in the vain Pursuit of Wealth or Pleasure. I must own, notwithstanding your philosophical Moral, which I acknowledge to be very ingenious, that I am a great Friend to Sleep, whom <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> calls the most amiable of all the Gods. When tired out with Grief or Pain, it strengthens and renews the Springs of Life; we wake refreshed, and feel a Kind of silent Hymn of Gratitude arise in our Minds for this, more than for any other Blessing. While we sleep, we are, at least, negatively good, incapable of acting or designing Ill; and I am afraid, that even the best Man has more to answer for his wakin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than his sleeping Hours, be he never so great a Sluggard. However, I shall receive one Advan∣tage from your Doctrine, that I shall insist upon your Practice keeping up to your Preaching; and I will certainly produce your Letter against

you, whenever I find you begin to yawn about Ten o'Clock; for that is a most unreasonable <HI>Hour</HI> for a Person to go to Bed, who has not Occasion to sleep more than <HI>five.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR'S of the 19th I shall answer, by desiring you to look into that Letter of mine, which gave you Occasion to speak upon this Head; and you will find, that I did not say my Philosophy prevented me from feeling. A Man may be very sensible of the Gout or Stone, without roaring — nay, more so, for the Expression of either Grief or Pain is observed to lessen the Poignancy of them. I would say with <HI>Romeo,</HI> "hang up Philosophy," indeed, if it served to extinguish in my Breast the least Part of that manly Love, that tender Friendship, that soft Sentiment, or that warm Affection, which my charming <HI>Fanny</HI> is best capable of inspiring; my quick Sense of all which, I am proud to own, and grateful to acknowledge, I owe to her alone.</P>
<P>As to your leaving <HI>England,</HI> you may remem∣ber, I told you before, that, though I might
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
submit, I never should consent; because I could never sincerely do it. But upon this Subject I hope to have an Opportunity of speaking more at large in a few Days, when I design being in Town.</P>
<P>I do not remember the particular Conver∣sation, you hint at, just before I left <HI>London.</HI> I am very certain, I never came into such an Agreement; and, if you proposed it, I have forgot it — as I should do every Thing, which betrayed the least Unkindness in you.</P>
<P>I shall send this Night to the Post for your Letter, and am impatient to know how you are. I am afraid you spent your Time, careless of your own Health, I may say, of my Health, while <HI>Kitty</HI> was in Town. I wish a little Scolding Would do you any Good.</P>
<P>My dearest <HI>Fanny,</HI> I do not lessen the Portion of Time allotted by Nature for Rest. I find five Hours sufficient for my Health and Spirits; more Sleep injures both; then rationally I con∣clude, Nature meant no more. Now every Indulgence we take, beyond what Nature re∣quires, is rather a Fatigue, than a Refreshment. This is equally true in Meat, and Drink, and Sleep: And, to consider it in this Light, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Passage in Lord <HI>Grimston</HI>'s Play, which, along with the whole Performance, has been so laughed at, is not quite so absurd, as it is generally taken;
<Q>I'll rest my wearied Bones, 'till they
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
more wearied be.</Q>
I do not think, with you, that a Man is passively good, all the while he is asleep; it would be great Favour to allow him to be even negatively bad. The Mind of Man was framed for a Series of rational Thought, and his Life designed for a Course of moral Actions; if then, without Necessity, he ceases to think, or act, to the best of his Powers, he mars the Ends of his Creation. Nay, I think, we can hardly refrain from charging positive Guilt upon a Person, who sleeps more than he needs. Sleep is a temporary Death; and, as I hinted to you upon this Subject before, how a Man may lengthen his Life, he by this Means shortens it, of course; then, for so much, he is guilty of Suicide. Is not a Man guilty of Theft, who steals from an Heap, because he does not pocket the Whole? And, if a Parcel of Money be laid in a Line upon a Table, is he not equally criminal, who takes from the Middle, as if he stole from one End?</P>
<P>I have now gone through both your Letters, and, having nothing better or more agreeable to do, shall return to <HI>Pliny</HI>; but shall first observe to you, that I have had frequent Thought, since I was upon this Work, of writing Remarks upon your Letters,
<Q>and hold my Farthing-Candle to the Sun.</Q>
This would be an Undertaking, which would require a great deal, but not too much, Time; for, though your
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Letters are but few, yet the Comments would be many, either to point out the Beauties, or express my Admiration of them.</P>
<P>The sixteenth Epistle of the fifth Book is a very fine and a very affecting one. I love <HI>Pliny</HI> most, when he speaks upon such Subjects as these. His generous Friendships, extreme Tenderness, and extensive Humanity, have given me such an Affection for him, beyond any of the Antients I am acquainted with, that I am resolved he shall be the first Person I will inquire for, when I go to Heaven; for there he is, if St. <HI>Paul</HI> be there. There may be many greater Characters, I mean with Regard to History, but not one more amiable. How vain then is Ambition, when <HI>Pliny</HI> is preferred to <HI>Alexander,</HI> or <HI>Caesar!</HI> and how surprizing, that Men should still continue in a Mistake, when so little Re∣flection may set them right!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I never read with complete Pleasure, but when we are together; so it gives me Uneasiness, in my Musaeum, when any Senti∣ment or Criticism occurs to me, that I cannot immediately communicate it to you: And this
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
is the Reason, that many of my Letters treat upon Subjects, which seem not proper for such familiar Epistles, as our's generally are; so that, perhaps, some of them appear stiff merely from the Freedom of them; for I never sit down with a Design of writing you <HI>a Letter,</HI> but, when I take Pen in Hand, I write you whatever occurs to my Mind at that Time, whether Poetry, Metaphysics, Politics, or Divinity.</P>
<P>For Instance, now, who could think of en∣tertaining a young Woman of Wit, Gaiety, and poetic Rapture, with a Discourse upon Self-Murder? But I happened this Morning to look into a Treatise against Suicide, by Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> which I think a very insufficient Performance.</P>
<P>Authorities drawn from the Scriptures, or Writings of the Philosophers, may have Effect upon very weak or over religious Minds: But Reasons, not Authorities, are requisite to Men of Sense, or free Reflection; which a Man may have, without being an Atheist, or merely a Deist.</P>
<P>In those Places, where the Author attempts to reason, he does it very imperfectly; of which I shall give you two Instances, among many. He says,
<Q>We are placed here, like a Centinel at his Post,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and after going on, with a great deal of Common-place, on that Head, concludes, from the <HI>supposed</HI> Analogy of human and divine Things, that Suicide must be a
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Crime. But this is begging the Question. What Authority from Reason have we to say, that Man is placed here, as a Centinel? Or, what Certainty have we of this Analogy? In Meta∣physics, indeed, we are obliged to give some Definitions of our Ideas, in order to help us to discourse intelligibly about them; but, in Re∣ality, there may be no more Relation between the Things themselves, and our Ideas of them, than there is between Colours and Sounds; though a blind Man, to give us his Notion of Red, compared it to the Sound of a Trumpet, but yet, in true Philosophy, it comes as near the Sound of a Lute: And, indeed, the specu∣lative Divines seem to me, generally, to reason, like this Man, with more Fancy than Logic.</P>
<P>Another Piece of Reasoning, he makes use of, is this:
<Q>That, though we cannot perceive any Relation, we are placed in, with Regard to this Life, (as in some Instances may be the Case) which might make our Death a moral Evil; yet, <HI>perhaps,</HI> we may be appointed by God to influence some future Event, and so the Ends of Providence may be disappointed by one Man's Impatience.</Q>
Now I think it extremely weak, perhaps impious, to imagine, that it can be in the Power of one Man, or Mankind united, to frustrate the least Scheme or Design of Providence: And a Thief, at the Gallows, may make use of such an Argument
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
with as much Reason as any body else: So that this Reasoning, by proving too much, proves nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Watts</HI> has, indeed, summed up all that has ever been said upon this Occasion; but, to tell the Truth, I never met with any thing satisfactory upon the Subject; which is owing to the cautious, but unfair Manner of arguing, upon this Head, used by the Divines; who, for Fear of giving the least Encouragement to desperate Men, will not admit of any Sort of Latitude in this Matter. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXCI. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON finding that my dear <HI>Harry's</HI> Letter had been opened before it came to my Hands, I began to apprehend that my Letters might have been intercepted. I know not how this Treatment affects you; but it has filled me with the highest Resentment: For sure it is the Extreme of Insolence and Cruelty to deprive us of the only Means left to soften the tedious, me∣lancholy Hours of Absence: Nor can I believe that any Law, human or divine, has vested even a Parent with such a Power. What barbarous Tyranny then to assume it!</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>I have often experienced the Uneasiness you mention, at reading any thing that pleased me when you was not with me. One finds but a vague Enjoyment in any Pleasure, unshared by the Person beloved.</P>
<P>I think I have Reason to resent the Apology you make for writing upon Subjects above a tawdry Girl's Reflection. If you consider me in that Light, I must join with the World in con∣demning your Taste: But if, as you have flat∣tered me, my Person has the least Share in your Affection, that you love my Mind, and would improve it, in order to render it capable of the highest Enjoyment, that of conversing with you, why need you make any Apology for taking the proper Method of rendering it worthy of your Regard? I have often told you, that no Subject can appear dull or abstruse to me, which you wrote on: Nay, I have gone farther, and some∣times fancied, that if you were to write in a Language I was wholly unacquainted with, I should certainly understand you; at least I am sure I should, if I was to hear and see you speak it.</P>
<P>I have never met with any of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s Writings; but, from the Specimen you give, I take him to be a better Christian than Philo∣sopher. Though I am sure there may be many stronger Arguments against Suicide, than those you quote from him, yet I am pleased at his
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
considering every Individual, though without visible Tye or Connection, as necessary to the Well-being of the whole Species; for, as the Great Artificer made nothing in vain, the Wretch who finds not Happiness in his own Bosom, or in any outward Objects, may, from this Principle alone, conclude Self-Murder to be a Crime.</P>
<P>But, after all, what are all Arguments about this Matter? Only speculative Essays: For I am convinced, that no Person ever committed the Act, but an Atheist or a Madman. Then it would be in vain to reason with the first, upon Principles which he denies you; and it would be a Jest to reason with the other at all.</P>
<P>After this Reflection, I do not look upon Suicide in that shocking Light which other People do: For, with Regard to the Atheist, I fear it is pretty equal, to his poor Soul, after what Manner he dies; and, as to the Madman, I throw him upon his Mercy, who could, had he pleased, have
<Q>made Reason rule, and Pas∣sion be it's Slave.</Q></P>

<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></P>
<P><Q>I talked of dying; better Thoughts come forward;</Q>
and since the Satisfaction I have had in this Day has made me somewhat more in Love with Life, I shall here give you a Supplement to my last Letter, lest you should imagine I was quite of a different Opinion from <HI>Watts,</HI> because I did not allow his Reasoning to be sufficiently strong upon the Subject.</P>
<P>I do not look upon Suicide, or indeed upon any Act, in the Light that Divines do, as cri∣minal in itself; but regard all Actions, in a general View, as indifferent in themselves; for the same Thing may be virtuous at one Time, and vicious at another: So that the Difference seems to lie merely in Circumstance. I think, with Deference to the Pulpit, that whoever un∣derstands the Nature of Vice in any other Sense, impiously charges God with having originally generated Evil. Now, with Regard to this par∣ticular Instance we are upon, I consider a Suicide not as guilty of a particular Crime, but of so
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
much Vice, as the moral Consequences of the Act leave him chargeable with: And the Chain is so extensive, and the Dependencies so nice, in this Life, that very few Men can be free enough, from Relation or Contingency, to be perfectly clear from Guilt in this Act: And, so far as it is a Crime, it is of the highest Nature so, as it has the Aggravation of Presumption, the Sin of acting against Nature, and the Im∣possibility of Repentance.</P>
<P>However there may be particular Instances where the Thing may be indifferent in itself; yet, even here, though the Action be innocent, the Turn of Mind, which prompts to it, must be extremely vicious. It argues an Impatience and Rashness, which are the Signs of an In∣temperance of Soul, a Disregard to the Opinion of this World, which every good Man should have Respect for, or a Despair of God's Provi∣dence, which a Man of Philosophy or Religion should never betray.</P>
<P>There are, I think, but three Things which can provoke a Person to this desperate Act; Pain, Poverty, or Shame. If from the first Cir∣cumstance, then he has forgot what all the Trials in this Life were intended for; and so foolishly refuses that Physic, which may give him Health to Immortality. If from the second, it is owing to a false Pride, and an unchristian Spirit, joined to a Habit of Idleness, which
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
creates a slothful Despondency. If from the third, he but seals his Name with Infamy, makes that Shame the more public, and de∣prives himself of any Opportunity of retrieving his Character. It was finely said, by some great Man, upon hearing Libels had been wrote against him,
<Q>I will live so, as to give the Lye to their Reproach.</Q></P>
<P>Suppose a Criminal, leading forth to Execu∣tion, even he shall have no Power over his own Life, though already forfeited and condemned; for he adds to his Crime, by rebelling against the Laws of his Country, and deprives the Community of a wholesome Example of public Justice. Beside, as all human Inflictions may be considered as Trials of our Virtue, so may even legal Punishments, if undergone with Re∣signation, Contrition, and Hope, be considered as Attonements for our Crimes.</P>
<P>Thus you see, that even in the most indif∣ferent Case, though the Action itself may be morally innocent, yet it can never be performed but by a vicious Actor.</P>
<P>In short, it is an Action contrary to the Laws of God and Man. The first, without recurring to Authorities, may be proved from the natural Abhorrence we find in ourselves from the Act, which, to Demonstration, shews the Sense of Providence about the Matter: And the second we know from the general Sense of Mankind,
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
who have endeavoured to deter from, by affixing Ignominy upon it, the only Way of dealing with the Dead.</P>
<P>But all these Reflections may not occur to a Man in the Hurry of the Act; for there are but few deliberate Suicides: Yet surely any Moment of Time may afford us Leisure for this short Expostulation;
<Q>What if it should be a Crime? Then, great God, how shocking must his Si∣tuation be, whose Conviction comes too late for Repentance!</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter last Post, with the Pamphlet wrote against the
<Q>Essay on Spirit.</Q>
I do not think it is well done; nor has he answered the Essay in any Sort to my Satisfaction. He shelters himself entirely under Texts of Scripture, which may be explained and understood as well for the Essay as himself. He does not venture into the Field at large, nor engage at all in the metaphysical Parts of that Work.</P>
<P>What does he mean by saying, that
<Q>to suppose the one only self-existing God can
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
delegate a Power of Creation, even to the highest Spirit, is impious and absurb?</Q>
It does not appear to me that there is any thing, in such a Supposition, beyond the Power, or contrary to the Nature of God.</P>
<P>There is something new in his Opinion, that, by the Expression of the Angel of the Lord, is to be understood, not a distinct Spirit, but only the Form or Matter with which the Most High has sometimes indued himself, in order to be∣come visible to the Grossness of human Fa∣culties. This may be true, for any thing that either he or I know: But I think there is no Authority for it in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>In speaking of the three Men, who were stiled Jehovah, and appeared to <HI>Lot,</HI> and from which he means to deduce a Hint of the Trinity in Unity, he gives a very unsatisfactory Reason why only two of them were stiled Angels: And I shall here venture upon a Sentiment of my own on this Head, which has just now occurred to me. Two of the Persons are called Angels, intimating the Father and the Holy Ghost; and the third is only spoken of as Man, prealluding to that State of Humanity, which God the Son was, thereafter, to take upon himself, in this World.—I think that this Passage, thus ex∣plained, greatly strengthens the Allegory of that Apparition, supposed to manifest to <HI>Abraham</HI> the Trinity in Unity.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/>The Insincerity which he charges upon the Author, in the Dedication to the Primate, is, perhaps, true; but he unfairly passes by, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was quoted for it, in giving Way, in some Things, to the Customs of the Jews.</P>
<P>As to the "Essay on Spirit," my Objection is not to the Treatise, but to the Author; for, as he confesses himself to be a Clergyman, he should have kept himself within the Trammels of his Garb; and, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some former Letter.</NOTE> as I said before, rather have go∣verned himself by Form, than guided himself by Reason. The Church <HI>Catholicon,</HI> indeed, may be a proper Subject for human Disquisition, and has, in former Times, been purged, modelled, and reformed, to the great Advantage of Christianity: But the Church <HI>established</HI> is a sacred Thing; the Peace of it is not to be disturbed, and Noli irritare is it's Motto. The Author is guilty of the same Officiousness of a Person that should rouze a Friend, dozing away his Life in a Lethargy; who would prefer peaceful Slumbers to the Vigour of Health, or the Length of Days. It had been a more pru∣dent Attempt to have affirmed Atheism, than Unitheism; as Truth and Reason are more safely combated, than Prejudice or Superstition. It is the same Indiscretion, as it would be in a State, for an enthusiastic Patriot to venture his Life or Fortunes for the Sake of Liberty or
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
Justice. In short, Truth is no more to be spoken by all Persons, than at all Times.</P>
<P>For my Part, I think this Essay, though it has not immediately advanced the Principles of Christian Morality, has had that great End ulti∣mately in View, by strengthening our Faith in the Hierarchy. Metaphysics are, in Truth, a dangerous Science to introduce into Religion; for, where there can be no Certainty, the Doubts must be infinite. Natural Philosophy, with the rational Deductions therefrom, afford, to every contemplative Man, sufficient Light to work his Salvation by: But surely the super-metaphysical Doctrine, of Trinity in Unity, has made more Christians recur to Deism, than Divines, perhaps, are aware of; while the Trinity, as explained in this Essay, sufficiently vouched, I think, from the Scriptures, and the Opinions of the antient Fathers of the Church, who immediately followed the Apostles, has nothing anti-metaphysical in it: The Possibility of it is comprehensible; and then, and then only, it becomes the proper Object of Faith.</P>
<P>But there are some enthusiastic Believers, who are over zealous for Mysteries, and think, that any thing, which falls short of Impossibility, is not sufficient Exercise for the Christian Faith. Perhaps these Men are of that dangerous Sect, who affirmed, that perfect Faith alone was suf∣ficient to Salvation, and that the Doctrine of
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Good Works was impiously presuming to add to the Merits of our Saviour; though the Apostle says,
<Q>Give all Diligence to add to your Faith Virtue.</Q>
2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i.5.</P>
<P>For my Part, I think that there is Mystery enough in the Incarnation, and Redemption, to satisfy a reasonable Man: And, as these Things are indeed incomprehensible, but not directly contrary to our Reason, they square, as I said before, with the allowed Definition of Faith.</P>
<P>I shall conclude these Remarks with an Al∣lusion to the Body natural. That Constitution is in Danger, whose Appetite swallows more than it's Stomach can digest; and the most valid Health is always found to be with the most temperate Man.</P>

<P>TO-MORROW is to be a very busy Day with me, both at home and abroad; therefore I shall dedicate this pleasant, tranquil <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening to you, lest I should miss a Post. I am in Haste too to finish <HI>Pliny,</HI> that I may send it up along with the rest of your Books.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>In a Note upon the twenty-seventh Epistle of the seventh Book, we are informed of the Name of that Philosopher, who gave the famous Advice to <HI>Augustus,</HI> to repeat the twenty-four Letters, whenever he found his Passion rising. I wish I had seen this Passage before the last Evening we spent at —. The Advice, indeed, I have often heard of; but never knew the Author's Name before, or I should have honoured it. I have very seldom known the Charm put in Practice; but always imagined, when I saw a Man in a Passion, that either he had never heard of it, or had never learnt his Alphabet: Upon which Hint, I am tempted sometimes to treat such Persons like Children, and hang a Horn-Book about their Necks, saying, with <HI>Brutus,</HI>
<Q>I will use thee for my Sport, yea, for my "Laughter, when thou grow'st waspish.</Q>
The Cure for a Scold, a Poem in one of the <HI>Tatlers,</HI> is from such a Hint, as this of <HI>Athe∣nodorus.</HI></P>
<P>In the Observations upon this same Epistle, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> inveighs against the Weakness and Credulity, with Regard to Ghosts and Appa∣ritions. Now I cannot join with him in this Particular; because there are some Stories of this Kind so well attested, that they should gain Credit, like other Parts of History, upon the same Authority. The Belief of this Matter is
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
a Thing above our Reason, but not contrary to it; which is the proper Definition of Faith: And, if it were made an Article of our Creed, I do not think it would be amiss; for it is not contrary to Religion, as being vouched by Holy Writ: At least, I would not discourage the Belief, since it is a strong Proof of Life, after Death; which every Argument that tends to prove, adds Strength to Religion and Virtue. As to the Immortality of the Soul, which I lay hold of every Opportunity to discourse upon, it is a Thing, which a Christian cannot doubt of; because there is express Authority for it in that Book, upon which his Faith is founded: And even to a Deist it may be proved, ex absurbo; which is a Method of arguing in the Mathe∣matics, when the Truth of a Proposition cannot be demonstrated in a direct Manner, the Assent is gained, by shewing the Absurdity of the con∣trary Opinion: As thus; If there be no Here∣after for Mankind, God is inconsistent, and unjust; the first, in giving us Hopes (which we certainly have from the Light of Nature alone) that are never to be fulfilled; and the second, in suffering Virtue, in any Shape, to go unre∣warded. That Being, then, which is incon∣sistent, or unjust, cannot be God; ergo, a Mortalist Deist sinks into an Atheist. I would treat an Atheist after the same Manner that I mentioned just now, and brand him with that
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
pupil Ensign, which is the proper Emblem of his extreme Ignorance; for, as the Psalmist justly expresses it,
<Q>The <HI>Fool</HI> hath said in his Heart, there is no God.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Orrery,</HI> in the Notes upon the twenty-eighth Epistle, says, this Letter should be placed the first of the whole Collection; and he is certainly right: Proper Lights, and particular Points of View, are a great Advantage to every thing. He often complains of the Want of Order through the Whole; and I am angry at him, for not setting this Matter right; for it would be as little Trouble, as the Observing upon it. I have a Mind to do so myself, when I have finished the Reading.</P>
<P>I am pleased with <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Sentiment upon Ridicule, in the last Paragraph of the twenty-ninth Epistle: And I approve of it as an ad∣mirable Weapon against Vice; and surely fitter here employed, than, as <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> recommends it, for the Test of Truth. Almost any Man would rather undergo Fine, Imprisonment, or Pain itself, rather than the Mortification of being laughed at. <HI>Addison,</HI> and other ingenious Writers, have spoken so admirably upon the Power of Shame, or Influence of Modesty, that, for very Shame, I shall not attempt to pursue the Subject in this Light; but shall take the Liberty, for the Honour of human Nature, to
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
consider this Matter in a particular Manner, which I never met with, in any Author.</P>
<P>Speech is not the distinguishing Sign of an human Creature; for Birds have been taught to speak: Nay, all the Brute, or Animal Creation converse naturally; for their Tones are intel∣ligible to each other; and what are Words, but Sounds, and Expressions of our Ideas? Ratio∣nality is not the proper Sign neither; for In∣stinct makes that Matter doubtful; and it is certain, that all Animals act logically. Risi∣bility is a Mark much insisted upon; but, if this is meant merely of a Distortion of Countenance, I have seen Dogs laugh; and if it be meant as a Sign of Chearfulness, or Pleasure, then the various Expressions of these Sensations, through∣out the whole Brute World, sufficiently answer to this Definition. I look upon Modesty, then, to be the only Characteristic, or Criterion, which properly distinguishes Man from other Animals; as we are certainly the only Creatures known, who have the least Sense of Shame.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXCVI. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SENT a second Messenger to the Post, suspecting the first had deceived me; but not a Line from you, though you must know how anxious I am, at present, to learn some Par∣ticulars relating to your Situation. Well! I am angry now — but A, B, C, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and now kiss, and Friends; and you are my own spoiled Pet again: But, if I do not hear from you by To∣morrow, I must eke out the <HI>Roman</HI> Alphabet with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew.</HI> I sent to know, if <HI>Kitty</HI> had any Account of you, but received no Satisfaction from thence.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Pliny:</HI> I think <HI>Orrery</HI> too severe upon the second Epistle of the eighth Book, not considering it as wrote to a Friend, and not to the World. The Privilege of Friendship is, to think aloud: And shall I be reprimanded for communicating to my dearest <HI>Fanny</HI> my humane Sentiments, with Regard to the Gleaner's Harvest, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Or, shall I be thought ridiculous for telling you, that I have spent good Part of this Morning in the Amuse∣ment of a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, catching Flies? not like <HI>Domitian,</HI> to kill them; but to retrieve them from their torpid State by the Heat of my Hand, and have the Joy to see them flutter
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
about the Room with added Life and Vigour. I think it a wrong Thing, to discourage, in any Sort, the Exercise of Humanity, even the Talking of it; as by this Means, perhaps, some People may be, as it were, intrapped into Virtue; by professing it first out of Vanity, they may come afterwards to practise it out of Shame. Many a Coward has been induced to fight, because he has happened to boast that he would.</P>
<P>In the twenty-second Epistle there is a very just Sentiment, and a very proper one to be considered by the severe Moralist, or the out∣rageously Virtuous:
<Q>He, who hates Faults, hates Mankind.</Q></P>
<P>The twenty-third Epistle is a very affecting one, and the Character of <HI>Junius Avitus</HI> is very amiable. It is, indeed, the Nature of the Afflicted to enumerate every little Circumstance, which once gave us Pleasure in the Enjoyment of what we have lost; and it is sometimes a mortifying Reflection, that, while we are multiplying our Joys, we may, perhaps, be but increasing the Earnest of our Griefs.</P>
<P>In the seventh Letter of the ninth Book, and several precedent ones, I find the Reason for Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Essay upon antient Architecture, which, you may remember, I was a little alarmed about in his Preface to this Work; for which I here offer my Palinode.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53"/>On the eighth Epistle there is an Instance of Wit in the Comment:
<Q>Vanity, like Smoke, smothers and obscures the Flame, from whence it proceeds.</Q>
I have observed a great deal of lively Fancy, as well as just Thought, in my Lord's Writing, through the Course of this Work: And, upon the Whole, I think he has shewn himself a Man of Virtue, a Man of Learning, and a Man of Taste; and if he was not also a Man of Rank and Fortune, which might make my Attachment suspected by Per∣sons, who have none of the Qualities above∣mentioned to ennoble their Sentiments, I would certainly take some solicitous Pains to become acquainted with him.</P>
<P>In the last Paragraph of the Preface to the tenth Book, my Lord seems in Doubt about the rendering the Word, <HI>Dominus</HI>; which he has done very justly, by translating it, <HI>Sir</HI>; as it is addressed by <HI>Pliny</HI> to <HI>Trajan.</HI> It is in this Manner we speak to our Kings; and the <HI>French,</HI> who are Patterns of all Politeness and Decorum, salute their Grand Monarque by the Stile of <HI>Sire.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty-eighth Epistle of the tenth Book should immediately precede the thirtieth; be∣cause, in this last, he refers to the former, in these Words:
<Q>I had informed you, by my last Letter, that <HI>Lycormas,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
I take especial Notice of the Want of Order in this Particular,
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
because my Lord has attempted to place all the Letters of this tenth and last Book in a regular Series; and, upon this Occasion, I shall repeat what I said in a former Letter, Why did he not take the same Pains throughout?</P>
<P>In his thirtieth Epistle <HI>Pliny</HI> gives an absurd Reason for not detaining the Ambassador: He says, it was because <HI>Lycormas</HI> had desired he should be detained, 'till he himself arrived.</P>
<P>The thirty-fifth and thirty-ninth Epistles from <HI>Trajan</HI> are exact Models of all the Court Answers to Public Addresses.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXCVII.</HEAD>
<P>MY dear little Shrub, my Arbutus, my Ever-green, I wish you Joy of your Retirement, and happy Vacation from <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></P>
<P>I am really charmed with your Reasoning upon the Analogy between the finite Perfections and the divine Attributes, so justly deduced from
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
the Wisdom and Goodness of Providence; and am pleased, that I carried my Sentiments no farther upon that Subject, than merely to sug∣gest, that, <HI>perhaps,</HI> there might be no Relation between them: For, when I come close to the Argument with the Divines, I enter the Lists upon their own Terms; but I only fix the Feet of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Ladder on the Earth, while you soar upon it to the Skies.</P>
<P>I meant to consider Mercy, as a self-sufficient, distinct, operating Excellence in the Godhead; the proper Objects of which were those, which did not come within the Merits of that Repen∣tance, which might intitle them to the Justice defined in that Letter. I am, my dearest <HI>Fanny,</HI> well aware, how little orthodox I am in this Opinion; and therefore call upon myself for some Explanation of this Subject, as I seem to make no Difference between the Good and Bad, with Regard to the unbounded Mercy of God. In order to which, I shall make Use of an Allusion, by considering Man in this Life, like a Silk-Worm in it's Nymph-State, involved and incompassed round with Toils of their own weaving; the one waiting 'till God's Blessing, as the other for a warm Sun, shall rescue him to a joyful Resurrection. Now some Insects carry the Seeds of Death with them into the Grave, and, consequently, perish immediately, without being able to revive to a new Life;
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
in which forlorn Situation I consider a wicked Man — and think I have some Authority from Scripture for this Hypothesis.
<Q>The Wages of Sin are <HI>Death.</HI></Q>
And again,
<Q>The Lord wisheth not the <HI>Death</HI> of a Sinner, but rather, that he may turn from his Wickedness, and <HI>live.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, though the Inflicting of Punishments, as I have somewhere said, would, in some Sort, deprive Heaven of the full Enjoyment of it's own Perfection; yet such a literal Death, as I understand from these Texts, that is, the intire Deprivation of Sense or Being from a Sinner, is not only agreeable to Justice, but to Mercy too; for
<Q>they say, bad Men would be unbless'd in Heaven:</Q>
And as this Life is given us, in order to prepare our Souls for the Relish of that contemplative Bliss, which is hereafter to be permitted to the Spirits of good Men made perfect, it would be rather an Instance of Cruelty, than Mercy, to grant Immortality to those unhappy Wretches, in a State of Existence, which would not admit the Gratification of mortal Senses, or the Indulgence of human Passions.</P>
<P>As I am drawing toward the Conclusion of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Works, I shall finish my Remarks upon him, and his Translator, in the Remander of this Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57"/>In a Note upon the forty-sixth Epistle, <HI>optimo Viro</HI> is called an Idiom, but I cannot see for what Reason: And my Lord might very well have rendered it literally, <HI>the best of Men,</HI> with∣out appearing the least stiff in the Stile of that Expression.</P>
<P><HI>Trajan</HI>'s Speech, in the last Part of the Com∣ment upon the fifty-first Epistle, puts me in mind of a Humour of the Widow —, in this Country; who was some Time ago married, and the Morning after she appeared caparisoned with an Horse-whip pinned to her Girdle; and told her Husband, she meant always to wear it about her, that it might be ready, whenever she deserved his Chastisement.</P>
<P>In the sixty-seventh Epistle, read <HI>since,</HI> for <HI>scarce.</HI></P>
<P>I have gone through the rest of this Book, which finishes the Volume, and find nothing more, fit to be remarked upon, that is not already taken Notice of by the Commentator, much better than I can pretend to do; and this, in general, is the Reason, why I have made so few Observations upon the whole Work. As to the Freedom I have taken, in some Criticisms, both with the Author, and his Commentator, I shall excuse myself with a Quotation out of the thirteenth Epistle of the third Book:
<Q>If I find you so frank, as to make Objections to particular Passages, I shall take
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
it for granted, that you are pleased with all the rest.</Q>
And so indeed I am.</P>
<P>I think, the twentieth Epistle of the fourth Book would be proper to conclude these Remarks with; changing the Word <HI>Grief</HI> for <HI>Sense,</HI> and applying that Letter to <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Orrery.</HI></P>
<P>And now let me assure you, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> that I feel a real Concern, upon the Close of this Work, at parting with three such Men, as <HI>Trajan, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Orrery:</HI> But one I hope to know in this Life, and shall die in Trust of meeting the others in the next; and you, my best-loved Girl, shall know them too:
<Q>Together to the Realms of Bliss well go.</Q>
'Till then, let us live, and love; for, while we do one, I am sure we shall do the other.</P>

to your Prudence. It is certain, that no Man partakes of the Lowness of his Situation, while he appears above it: And the Question in Life is, not what Part we acted, but how we per∣formed it. What she says, is extremely just,
<Q>that Misfortunes should be rather a Spur, than a Bridle, to us;</Q>
as a Man exerts himself more in a Bog, than upon Terra firma; and the noble Mind, like a Tennis-Ball, always rises in Proportion to it's Fall. <HI>Caesar</HI> said bravely, that he would rather be the first Man in a Village, than the second at <HI>Rome</HI>; and I would rather appear above a low Part, than beneath a great one.</P>
<P>I am glad to find, that you have contracted the Maxim of <HI>Athenodorus</HI> to the Vowels; tho', by mentioning the <HI>Water-Bottle,</HI> I suspect you mean to add the <HI>Liquids</HI> to them. Now I will cut the Work still shorter; for I will confine myself, not only to the Vowels, but to two of them, in Honour of ourselves: For I think, upon any such Occasion, we need have Regard but to U and I; and, to shorten it still further, let us consider those two Letters but as Diphthong.</P>

out of my Head — Not, as one might conjecture, to leave myself yet the Appearance of Youth, sufficient to justify so much Fondness, but for a very extraordinary Reason; to present my lively, gay, young Love with a Locket of them.

I give you your Choice of them; tho', as I hope, and shall take Care, that we shall be both laid under one Stone, I will have them both inscribed, as of one Sentence, to shew that in Death, as well as Life, I consider you Part of myself—

<P>I AM almost angry with my sweet Love for not attributing his Disappointment to any Cause, rather than my Neglect. I did indeed write, by <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Post, to Lady —, to <HI>Kitty,</HI> and to you. How extremely rude must Lady — think me, as there is no Doubt but all my Letters miscarried! I am vastly uneasy about them, but particularly for her's, it being of most Consequence.</P>
<P>I join with you in thinking that Friendship not only allows the Privilege of communicating our inmost Thoughts, and of acknowledging the honest Pride we feel from the Exercise of any moral Virtue, but that it is a Breach of that noble Intercourse to conceal even our Faults or Foibles. For my Part, I have shewn my Heart as naked to thy View, as to the Eye of Heaven. Real Friendship, like true Love, is understood by very few, yet common in the Mouths of every one. It can only be conceived by Minds capable of the most refined and disinterested Sentiments:
<Q>Reserve will wound it, and Distrust destroy;</Q>
and this makes
<Q>Friends such Rarities below.</Q>
I think, that Persons of different Sexes, who, with a tolerable Under∣standing, have had a sincere Affection for each other, are most likely to be capable of real
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
Friendship; for even the Remains of Love will create a Gentleness in our Manners, and Complacency of Behaviour; the Want of which is too often the Effect and Bane of common Friendships. I declare solemnly, I have felt a higher Satisfaction in considering myself as your first Friend, than ever I did in thinking myself the Object of your Affection. I know myself capable of retaining your Esteem, because I will never do any Thing to forfeit it; and therefore I receive greater Pleasure from any Mark of your Confidence, than from the fondest Expressions of your Love — Not but I shall ever wish to pre∣serve that too, as I have paid the Price for it, by giving mine; but we are, in general, fonder of what we have no Right to, than what is justly our's.</P>
<P>There is no Part of your Character so much indears you to me, as the Tenderness and Humanity of your Disposition. I have actually felt the same Transport in thinking of it, as you have done in the Exercise; my Heart has trembled, and Eyes overflowed with Pleasure, as if I had done some generous or humane Act myself.</P>
<P>I do assure you, that often in the extreme Fondness of my Heart, when I have looked at, and heard you with the sincerest Delight, I have been ready to burst into Tears, from reflecting that the Happiness, I then enjoyed, might some
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
Time prove an Aggravation of my Misery; and sure there is no Anguish equal to that, which arises from our departed Joys. I do not re∣member I was ever so much affected at any thing I read, as at a Passage of <HI>Young</HI>'s, which I met with during the Interregnum of our Loves.
<Q><L>And she <HI>was</HI> mine; and I <HI>was—was</HI> most bless'd!</L>
<L>Gay Title of the deepest Misery!</L></Q>
But I will have done with this melancholy Sub∣ject; and I sincerely hope it will never more occur to my Remembrance.</P>
<P>Your Brother and Sister have been with me all Day; so that I must quit you sooner than I would. Set down all the Blots and Blunders to their Account; for though my Thoughts are fixed on you, yet being obliged to converse with them, makes both my Hands and Eyes to wander.

<P>I AM concerned at the Account of your Health: You say you do not know what ails you; but that you are sick, and have lost your Appetite, and Spirits. Now take it thus, and you will find the true State of your Dis∣order: You have lost your Spirits; consequently your Appetite; and then it is no Wonder you are sick. But the Cause of this Progression is yet to be related; namely, the Fretting, you have humoured yourself in, upon this late Oc∣casion. I wish, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> I could make you as good a Philosopher in Practice, as you are in Theory. You have made me both; for which I am more beholden to you, than to my Mother for my Birth. She made me but an Animal; you have made me a Man.</P>
<P>I desire you will send me Lady —'s Letter, when you have answered it. I am interested in the smallest Circumstance relating to you, and am vain of every Compliment paid you.</P>
<P>I think there is something very pretty in your Sentiments about Friendship. You have carried the Thought farther, than I had ever considered it, by saying, even our Faults, or Foibles, we
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
should not hide, in such an Intercourse; but I think there is even a certain Honesty in such an open Dealing; for Friendship, such as deserves that Name, is an Union for Life; and, as in the meaner Partnerships of Trade, we should reveal the Drawbacks of Debts, or Insufficiencies upon our Stock, how much more nice ought we to be in this noble and generous Society! I think, with you, that Persons of different Sexes are most likely to preserve the best, and most lasting Friendships; and really believe, that, in the very few Marriage States, which can be deemed happy, the most perfect Concords of this Kind are to be found. That Gentleness of Manners, and Complacency of Behaviour, which you mention, may be considered as the Essence of Virtue, rather than the mere Orna∣ment of it; and the <HI>French</HI> Writers treat of them in this pretty Light, under the Title of "Les petites Morales." If strict Philosophy will not admit of this Expression, they may cer∣tainly be allowed the Marks of the most amiable Virtues; as they are sure Signs of Good-nature, Humility, and Humanity. As some of the Sages said, that Virtue need but put on a visible Form, to bewitch Mankind with her Charms, I think, that, what is meant by the Term, Good-breed∣ing, must certainly be the Dress, she would ap∣pear in. Mere naked Virtue, perhaps, may be a fit Contemplation for an Angel; but she must
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
be cloathed, with Decency, to be admired by Man. A blessed Spirit, as it has no
<Q>Sense to ake,</Q>
can bear the transcendent Splendor of Truth; but her Glory is too dazzling for the human Mind to bear without a Veil; as we look at the Sun through a smoaked Glass, and are obliged to use Shades, to mark the Beauties of Proportion.</P>
<P>Upon this Occasion, has happily occurred to me, Part of the most noble Descriptions of the State of the Blessed, that can be conceived; though it was imagined, by an unenlightened Heathen, <HI>Plotinus,</HI> a Philosopher of the <HI>Platonic</HI> Sect. A Translation will serve you, as well as the Original.</P>
<P><Q>In Heaven, the blessed Inhabitants enjoy a happy Tranquillity, having Truth itself for the Author of their Being, for their Essence and Support. They see Things there, not only as they are produced, but contemplate them in their first Principles, and behold themselves in those about them; for there all Things are obvious and perspicuous, nothing obscure, nothing opposite: All is conspicuous to all, intrinsical throughout; for Light every-where blends with Light: Every one has every thing in himself, and beholds the same in others: All Things then are every-where, and immense Splendor shines through all: Motion there is perfectly pure; for one Mo∣tion
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
does not impede another: Rest also there is never disturbed by Change; for it is not blended with unstable Nature: There dwells Beauty in the Abstract, independent of Form, or Matter. We may farther presume, that those, who behold these Things, can never be fatigued in the Contemplation of them; nor can any Satiety occur, to occasion any Fatigue; for there will be no Emptiness in any one, which, by being filled and sa∣tiated, may put an End to their Enjoyment.</Q></P>
<P>I have here given you the Sense of this beau∣tiful Passage; though, I am afraid, I have but poorly imitated the Spirit of it. The whole Author is extremely fine; and this is but a very small Part of the great Description, he has so gloriously attempted; but it was all, which fairly occurred to me upon the Subject of this Letter, and, as I thought, had some Relation to it. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>There is something so extremely elegant and tender in the first Part of your second Letter, as would render Life pleasing, under the severest Agonies, if, by enduring them, I might repay such Goodness. Indeed, thou dearest, kindest, best of Men, I will do all I can for the Re∣covery and Preservation of that Health, whose only Charm to me is, being dear to you. I wish I could tell you I was better. I think I grow worse every Day; but I do not make the least Doubt of my Recovery, for there is nothing dangerous in my Disorder; though I suffer more than I thought my Constitution could possibly bear. I am convinced I should mend, imme∣diately, if you were with me. This may ap∣pear childish; but sick Folks, and Children, are fanciful alike. Tell me then, thou dear Phy∣sician to my Soul and Body, when wilt thou give me new Life, and Health? I consider myself in the same Situation as the little But∣terfly, you mention, insensible to every thing
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
round me; or rather, like <HI>Promotheus</HI>'s Man of Clay,
<Q><L>I stand unmov'd, and wait, in dull Suspence,</L>
<L>Thy heav'nly Charms, to warm me into Sense.</L></Q></P>
<P>I can, no more than you, determine, whether it is kind, or cruel, to prolong the Life of your little Favourite. What does it subsist on, during the Time of it's natural Existence? If you know, and can provide it with natural Suste∣nance, we may suppose it dies only for Want of the Sun's Heat; then, to revive it with an artificial Warmth cannot be Cruelty: But if it's Food, as I believe, be of the Summer's Pride, and is not now to be found in the vegetable World, I fear the poor little Insect suffers by your Fondness, as Annihilation is preferable to Misery. Besides, I fancy a Butterfly does not die; but, according to the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> System, changes it's Form, and Being. This I am not quite clear in; though I have met with some poetical Simile, that warrants this Opinion.</P>
<P>To consider our present State of Existence, as rational Beings, who hope for a glorious Im∣mortality, it must appear the highest Act of Folly to aim at lengthening it, even for a Mo∣ment: It is as absurd, as to suppose a Prisoner should desire to continue in a Dungeon, when he may have Liberty to quit it, and enjoy all the Delights of Life; Yet were there any
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
Person, who had been born and bred in such a dismal Situation, that had entered into Ties and Connections with Wretches, as unhappy as himself, he would, I dare say, feel a strong Re∣luctance at entering into a happier State, when he must part from those, who had been Partners in his Misery, and all the Solace of it. So we, though Providence has wisely ordered, that Dis∣appointments, Pain, and Loss of Friends should, by Degrees, unloose the Hold we take of this dim Spot; that our Loves, our Friendships, should be torn asunder; that even our Desires and Passions should decay, and leave us scarce a Wish on Earth; yet stripped of, and aban∣doned by all, that makes Life pleasing; left, as it were, naked, on a barren Shore; when we have nothing else to grasp at, we lay Hold on our own frail and feverish Beings, and seem to find a <HI>Pain,</HI> in being separated from <HI>Pain.</HI></P>

<P>YOU may see, by my Paper, that I am not at home, and consequently have not your last Letter with me, to answer; therefore you can expect no other Reason for my writing to you now, but to shew you I would not neglect it, even for one Post, though unprepared with my best Help, your Love-inspiring, Sense-inditing Epistles.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> dined with me To-day, and hurried me home with them this Evening. I would have excused myself, but that I avoid the Appearance of any thing which looks queer; and I am apt to suspect, that a Person has but the Appearance of Sense, Courage, or Philosophy, who affects to manifest them upon trifling Occasions. I declare that I have, of late, so entirely given myself up to the charming Pleasures of Solitude, that I begin to endure Company, as one plays a bad Hand of Cards, not for the Enjoyment of the Sport, but merely to keep one's Self within the Game. This Turn of Mind has sometimes so alarmed me, that I have argued the Point with myself, pro and con; but have declared for the Pleasures of retired and philosophic Leisure, upon this
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
Reasoning, that it is possible some Accident or Misfortune of Life may hereafter deprive me of the Enjoyment of Society; for few and rare Friends are found at the Poor, the Sick, or the Prisoner's Levee; but Death alone can rob me of the Heart-approving, rational Joys of Soli∣tude. If I quitted the <HI>Converse</HI> of the World out of an Austereness of Manners, or a Severity of Morals, I might justly appear in the uncouth and unphilosophic Light of a Misanthrope; but when I retire, in order to prepare myself for a <HI>better,</HI> I seem to myself to act the Part of one, who takes a larger Scope in view, than the scanty Horizon of this narrow Globe. I retire, to converse with you, and to make Assignations with thee, my charming Seraph, where I shall have Myriads of unjealous Rivals in thy Love, in the Harmony of thy Sense and Virtue. It is you alone, who can make me endure Society; as it was you only, who have inspired me with those Helps, which can enable me to live alone. You need not be apprehensive, that such ab∣stracted Speculations, as these, can ever abate the Warmth of my Affection to you; for what is my Love to my dearest <HI>Fanny,</HI> but that <HI>Taste</HI> for Virtue, which I hinted at, in a former Letter, and that high Admiration for Beauty, Harmony, and Order, which is the proper Contemplation of the truly philosophic Mind? So that even my Relish for every thing that is amiable, may be

considered but as a Part of that Love and Esteem, which I bear to you.</P>

<P>THE Dependence, you express, upon my doing every thing for our mutual Happi∣ness, was not necessary to encourage me to do so, upon all Occasions; but, if I needed any Inducement, that Confidence alone would be sufficient to oblige me to it; and I shall never attempt to over-rule your Will, but to better inform it; or the more effectually to answer the great End of all my Thoughts and Actions, namely, your Happiness and Establishment, and my own, only through such charming Means. My not going to <HI>London</HI> before this, is one Instance, I may give, that I prefer both our Interests, before our Pleasure; and, if I have not fixed the Day, at your frequent Request, it is

How have I <HI>undeserved</HI> from you, or what Merits have those Persons you so falsely stile my Friends, toward you, that their Satisfaction is so unkindly and unwar∣rantably preferred before mine? What Com∣fort could they afford me, for your Loss? or where else could I expect to find it? It is too late in Life for me to begin the World anew: My Habits are grown too strong to be counter∣acted now: What a Turn must my whole Set of Ideas take! and how many refined Pleasures must I <HI>unlearn,</HI> or lose the Relish of, before I could be satisfied with the Enjoyment of any other Woman! I have often quarrelled with you, upon such Subjects, and take it very un∣kindly that you will not recollect yourself a little, before you treat me with so much Ingra∣titude and Ungenerosity.

<P>THE sincere Pleasure I received from my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s last Letter is, indeed, suf∣ficient to make me wish for Life, nay, a long one, to enable me to repay his generous Ten∣derness. Believe me, my sweet Love, your Kindness is not thrown away; for all the poor Return, which I can make, is most sincerely your's, in Thought, in Word, in Deed:—And, if I really am so blest, as to contribute to your Happiness, well may you call me ungenerous and ungrateful, for wishing to exchange that Bliss, even for the Joys of Immortality. The Transport, which I feel, from thinking I am dear to you, is much too great to be expressed.

<P>I am still une pauvre Solitaire; and look upon myself to be the truest female Recluse, that ever was; as my Confinement, Solitude, and Fasting, are dictated by Choice, not Necessity:—Yet I am afraid this voluntary Restraint is not founded in Reason, or Virtue. My Moderation may be compared to that of an Epicure, who, though he may have a good Appetite, eats sparingly of a coarse Dinner; but provide him with Delica∣cies, and he shews the Glutton. So I go seldom abroad, see no Company at home, never think of public Diversions, and pass my Life in a State of Indifference to the Objects which are within my Reach; but, were it in my Power to enjoy the Feast of Reason, in thy Converse, I should quickly lose the Appearance of Self-Denial, and gladly indulge myself in the extreme Enjoyment of the highest Pleasures—those of seeing, hearing, loving, and being loved by thee. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>I AM at a Loss for Epithets fond or expressive enough to address you with; but must refer self to the Intuition of angelic Minds, to shew you how far short the warmest Terms of human Language fall of that sincere Affection and tender Love I bear you.</P>
<P>I am surprised at the Weakness of your Con∣cern upon my mentioning my dying; for surely a Man is not the nearer, though he may be the better prepared for it, by his making a Will; nay, even the very Approach of it ought to alarm us no more, than it should a fond Parent, that his Child was growing taller; for Death, in the Philosophy of a Man, or the Hope of a Christian, is to be considered, not as a Change of our State, but an Improvement of it. How∣ever, I will indulge your Tenderness so far, as to speak no more upon this Head; but am pleased to find I am even with you, for some unkind Hints, much stronger than mine, upon this Subject, in one of your late Letters.</P>
<P>I have been to see the large Manufacture at —, as I have engaged in the same; and it has given me great Satisfaction; though it would make any one, of less Spirit than myself, despair of bringing so vast a Work to Perfection, from
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
the complexed Machinery, various Business, in∣tense Application, and large Sums of Money, and Credit, which are necessary to carry it on; yet, believe me, that every Difficulty, which oc∣curred, has but strengthened my Resolution to pursue it. It would surprise and startle your Philosophy, at the same Time, to see so many different Machines performing the Parts of ra∣tional Agents, and requiring no farther As∣sistance from Man, than to set them in Motion, and to preserve their Courses regular, which is no more than what often Man from Man re∣quires, as Patients from Physicians: Nay, some of them, like a Person in Health, perform their Parts by the mere Help of the Elements only; and, if the sole Difference between these and Animals be, that the first regularly labours to pursue the Design of it's Formation, while the other, through Caprice, is capable of disappoint∣ing the Ends of it's Creation, I do not think that living Creatures have much to boast of, in the Superiority of their Mechanism. Man, indeed, as exercised in the Contemplation of Truth, Beauty, Harmony, and Order, and employed in the Practice of Virtue, Morality, and Religion, is, in Reality, a noble and exalted Creature; but the many-headed Monster, the vulgar Herd, who are insensible to these great Advantages, I take to be a more imperfect Instrument, than a Windmill or a Loom.</P>

<P>I AM still a poor lonely Wretch. Judge, from your own Heart, how earnestly I wish for you, and how tenderly and constantly my Thoughts are employed in lamenting your Ab∣sence, and the cruel Necessity which occasions it. It is now a Month, by common Calcula∣tion, since we parted; what a Length of Time, when measured by the Pangs of Absence! and
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
yet you do not speak of coming to me. I envy you the complicated Hurry of Business, you are engaged in: It divides your Anxiety, and pre∣vents your thinking too earnestly on any one Subject. I rejoice at it, while I feel the Unea∣siness of having my every Sentiment and Idea fixed on the only Object which can give me Pain or Pleasure, thy dear Self alone.</P>
<P>Your kind, your charming Letter has, indeed, raised my Spirits to an higher Degree of Chear∣fulness, than they have known, for some Time past: But while the elegant Tenderness, which you there express, elates my Heart to a kind of Rapture, it, necessarily increases my Sorrow for our Separation:
<Q><L>So Mourning comes, by Bliss convey'd,</L>
<L>And ev'n the Sweets of Love allay'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>My dearest Life may be perfectly assured, that there is no Enjoyment, however dear to me, that I would not readily sacrifice to the Pleasure of obliging him: For this Reason, I was picqued at your seeming to suspect me of Irregularity. Take my Word, that the dear little Object of our mutual Care, and, I hope, Bliss; shall not suffer through any Fault of mine, that I can avoid. I am in Bed every Night by Twelve, and up at Nine. If my lying so long be a Fault, I will not cover it with a Falsehood: But if you knew the many restless and uneasy Hours I pass in Bed, you would more wonder at my rising so early, than
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
at my lying so late. You must allow something to the Weakness of my Condition, and consider the vast Difference between this, and my former Way of living; and you will find my Nine almost equal to your Five in the Morning.</P>

When you have engaged in such a Course of dead Authors, you will have the less Reason to lament my Absence; for you will there find, much better, that Sense, Philosophy, and Virtue, which you are so partial to compliment me with; and the real Excel∣lencies of those Things may, perhaps, be as dead in me, as they are in them.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED the Monody, and am as much charmed with it as you are; but I could not help smiling at your jealous Criticism. I do not look upon the Poem in the Light that you do; for it affected me in a higher Concern, that it was possible for your Death to inspire me with every Sentiment of Grief there expressed, without the Poetry to publish them to the World.</P>
<P>To a Person used to read and write Poetry, Figures, Allusions, and Numbers are as familiar, as plain Prose is to other People:
<Q>—For the Numbers came.</Q></P>
<P>Poets have generally pleaded their Incapacity, on Account of Grief; but this was always in
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
order to raise the Merit of the Poem. <HI>Tickel</HI> says,
<Q><L>Grief unaffected suits but ill with Art,</L>
<L>And flowing Numbers with a broken Heart.</L></Q>
However, he has contrived to sigh out as beautiful an Elegy, as ever was written in any Language.</P>
<P><HI>Waller</HI> said, that Poets excel only in Fiction; but this was rather an ingenious Apology for writing better on <HI>Cromwell</HI> than on <HI>Charles:</HI> It had more of Wit than Criticism in it; or, if there was any thing of the latter, it must be true only of Heroic Poetry; because neither the Actions, Virtues, or real Characters of Men are high enough to adorn the Epic Verse.</P>
<P>But there is a Mixture of Tenderness and Dignity, which form the Characteristic of Elegy, that agrees perfectly well with Figures, which it naturally inspires; and the more sincere the Grief, the bolder will these be of course.</P>
<P>There is one Authority, which puts an End to any further Criticism upon this Subject. <HI>Horace</HI> says,
<Q>If you would make me weep, you must first drop Tears yourself:</Q>
Which shews, that the Beauty of Elegy must rise in Proportion to the Sincerity of the Mourner.</P>
<P>I remember the elder <HI>Palma,</HI> whose Taste in Music I was fond of, sat down, one Day, to compose something for me; perhaps I was in Love at that Time, for I desired he would make
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
it expressive of the most melting Tenderness: Upon which he replied, "Il faut pleurer donc;" and, as the <HI>Italians</HI> have their Passions at Will, he began to sigh, and actually wrought himself up to a Flow of Tears, while he was writing.</P>
<P>But I might have saved you the Trouble of all this Criticism, only by referring you to Mr. <HI>Lyt∣telton</HI>'s Character; who is far from being so flight a Man, as to <HI>play</HI> the Poet upon so serious and affecting a Subject: And there is one Particular, which proves to me his Sincerity beyond all Doubt; which is, that, among a great Choice and Variety of his truly classical and poetic Writings, this Poem is, I think, the Chef d'Oeuvre.</P>
<P>All the Fault I find with Mr. <HI>Lyttelton,</HI> is, that he did not under-write himself upon this Occasion; for there is a certain gallant Pride in an ingenuous Nature, which tempts it to fall short even of the Praise it thinks is due, and is willing to bestow, lest it should be mistaken for Adulation. However, there is, at the same Time, a certain Fondness in the Lover, which inclines him to give Immortality to the Object of his Passion, which is not to be hoped for, without an Exertion of the fullest Powers of Poesy.</P>
<P>I pity a Poet's Grief more than any other Man's; for his natural Warmth, Tenderness of Sentiment, and Liveliness of Imagination, give
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
Sorrow a Power of sinking deeper in his Heart, than others can possibly be affected with. When a plain Man loses a Mistress, Wife, Child, or Friend, he laments merely for the Loss of so much Property: But, when these dear Con∣nections are torn off from a Person of a delicate Taste, he feels as if he had lost Part of himself, <HI>Animae Dimidium</HI> — nay worse, for the Remain∣der is a Burden to him.</P>
<P>Your Criterion I will not admit of; for a Man, who is sincere in his Grief for the Loss of a Wife, is the more likely to marry again. When Pleasures are flown, Nature strongly solicits the Recovery of them: The chaste nuptial Joys engross the whole Man, and form his Taste and Sentiments entirely to such social Enjoyments, which, by fond Indulgence, become at last his sole Scheme of Happiness; and when those charming Ties are dissolved, he has the World, as it were, to begin anew; and it is surely then more natural, and more rational too, to endeavour to renew the Pleasures we have been so well acquainted with, and approved of, than to attempt a spiritless Succedaneum to them.</P>
<P>So that, if ever your <HI>Crisis</HI> should come to pass, we ought not to doubt his Sincerity to the last Wife, but rather say, that he had paid a very high Compliment to his future one.</P>

<P>THE Heat of the Day, and the Coolness of my unperforming Nag, obliged me to stop here to Dinner. When the Sun's Strength declines, and my Horse recovers his, I shall make a desperate Push for St. <HI>Alban's.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Parcel of loose Papers, which I put into my Pocket, for Amusement on the Road, I find the inclosed Letter from <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to his Wife; which I send you, as Part of a Comment upon <HI>Hudibras</HI>; which I left you reading. You may observe, from this Letter, the hypocritical and fanatic Stile of the leading Men at that Aera, which will give you Light into the Characters of Knight and 'Squire.</P>
<P>Though it is but three Hours since we parted, I found I could not eat my Dinner without writing to you; for my Love is stronger than my Hunger. The Eagerness of Appetite some∣times makes me omit a Grace, and Sleep too often inclines me to neglect a Prayer at Night; but at Bed, or Board, I never forget to think of you, or cease to wish you, most earnestly, a Participation of such Entertainment, as I can afford you at either.</P>
<P>I shall call at —, in my Road, this Evening; where I expect to find the good Lady
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
in such a Condition,
<Q>as is her Custom always in the Afternoon.</Q></P>
<P>There is something remarkably odious in this Vice in Women, as Custom and Education are against it, and that it has not even the Excuse of Nature or Temptation on it's Side.
<Q><L>When Women err, let Nature be their Guide;</L>
<L>Love has some soft Excuse for female Pride.</L></Q>
For my Part, I should think the Embraces of a Harlot chaster than the Fondness of such a Wife.</P>
<P>What a shocking Thing must it be to any Woman's Reflection, at a sober Interval, to think, that, by this Vice, she has rendered herself the Subject of Lust, without being the Object of Desire! For such must be the Con∣sequence, when Passions are inflamed, while Reason is extinct, and, as the Wife of <HI>Bath</HI> says,
<Q>There is a Rule I never knew to fail, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
And what a dreadful Situation must that unhappy Man be in, who thinks he has no Security over his Wife's Chastity, but the natural Abhorrence which her Vice creates! For, in such a State, one could only think her a fit Paramour for an Incubus, which is a Species of Daemon, that is reported to hold criminal Commerce with dead Bodies. But enough of this vile Subject.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dearest</HI> Rediviva,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter of last Post, wrote by your own dear Hand, which gave me extreme Transport. What your Secretary said of your Health, or rather of your Life, which I was for a thousand Years alarmed about, could not make my Mind easy, 'till I had the Confirmation from yourself. How I passed the Age between the two last Posts, would be too tedious a Detail to trouble you with now.</P>
<P>I was ill for several Days, of the worst Sort of Illness, an Inattention to Reading, and a Lowness of Spirits. It was upon these Hints that I wrote to you for the Precedent of a Will, tho' I pretended it was for another Person, for fear of alarming you; and you cannot imagine what a Shock it gave me, that I had deferred a Matter of such Consequence to you, and to our dear Pledge, so long. I wrote that Letter from my Bed, and lay down between every Paragraph.</P>
<P>What a Sympathy was between us at the same Time! for I think we fell ill, and reco∣vered, at the same Instant. How lucky it was too, that neither of us knew the other was ill, 'till we had both recovered!</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97"/>I am no farther displeased at your having made Use of <HI>our</HI> Money, than that you should mention it. In a Fortnight, from this Date, I design to be in Town; neither my Health or Business will permit me sooner.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>The Paper, which he inclosed, was his Will, in the Wrapper of which was the following Writing:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="document">
<P>AS my Marriage, which I hereby publish, which I have privately owned to some Friends already, and which I hope, long before these Seals shall be broke open, I shall find myself at Liberty to acknowledge to all the World, may surprize some of my Relations and Friends, to whom I would, living or dying, give Satis∣faction in any Particular relating to myself, I shall leave this Declaration behind me for their Perusal.</P>
<P>I was not over-reached into this Match by Art, nor hurried into it by Passion; but, from long Experience of her Sense and Worth, I reasoned myself into it: And that I have not had any Cause to change my Opinion since, may be seen by my leaving this Writing un∣cancelled at my Death.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98"/>I considered, that there were three Things necessary in a Wife, which the World or myself should approve; Money, to accommodate my Fortunes; — Birth, to satisfy the Pride of my Relations; — and Sense, to render my own Life happy.</P>
<P>I considered, that it was an extraordinary Chance for one Man to compass all three; any one of which being as much good Luck as generally falls to one Man's Share, and the last the most seldom: There was, then, no Dispute which of them I should prefer, considering that I was, at that Time, thirty-six Years of Age, and that
<Q>a Man, who is born of a Woman, has but a short Time to live,</Q>
and a much shorter to be happy.</P>
<P>I considered, that I had formed my own Mind, and made my own Fortune too, having never had Tutor or Patron to either; and that my Friends ought surely to give me Leave to frame my own Happiness too.</P>
<P>I found I had so engaged her Affections, that no other Man could make her happy; and so dallied with her Character, that only myself could repair it. Thus Honour, Justice, and Generosity concurred to what my Love and Reason had before approved.</P>
<P>The Progress of our Loves may be seen in a Collection of our Letters, which are, at present, in the Hands of a Friend; and, in reading them,
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
one may see how our Studies, Sentiments, and whole Turn of Mind, were adapted for each other: So that, in our Case, it might most emphatically be said,
<Q>Whom the Lord hath joined, let no Man put asunder.</Q>
Amen.</P>
<P>I am, in my constitutional Principles, for a limited Monarchy; and, in my national Policy, for the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession; and think that any one, who differs from me, must do so more from private Reasons, than any Regard to the public Good.</P>
<P>I am, in my Religion, a Christian; but of the <HI>Arian</HI> Heresy, as it is stiled by bigoted Councils. I was, for many Years, a Deist; 'till Dr. <HI>Clayton,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Clogher,</HI> his Essay on Spirit, and subsequent Writings, upon the same Subject, had reconciled the Doctrine of the Trinity to human Reason, and metaphysical Science.</P>

<P>INDEED, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I wish to live for no other Reason, but to make you amends for all your Goodness to me: God grant my Power may be in any Proportion equal to my Will, and we shall be the happiest Couple breathing: And, indeed, I think I may, without Vanity, say, I know no two Persons, who seem better qualified for such a State, than we are; and therefore we must be thoroughly miserable, if we are not entirely happy; for both our Feelings and Sentiments are too delicate and refined, to be capable of that Indifference, which the generality of Mortals pass their Lives in. For which Reason, I am not displeased that your Situation and Circumstances prevented our living together, before I was thoroughly acquainted

with you, or myself; but, though I think I might now safely answer for my future Conduct, I own my most fervent Wishes are sometimes damped with fearing, that, if ever we should live together, you may grow weary of me, or, as <HI>Milton</HI> phrases it,
<Q>Too much Converse thee perhaps may satiate.</Q>
However, I more often lament the sad Necessity which parts us; and I think you more to be pitied in this Separation, even than I am, sup∣posing our Love to be quite equal. I have the Pains of Absence to combat with, which are perhaps as much as I can bear: You have these also, joined to the Reflection of having attached yourself to me, for no other Reason, but the Hope of finding a sincere tender Friend, and an agreeable Companion: You have made it my Duty, as well as Inclination, to become the sole Partner, and chief Solace of your every Care, to smooth the rugged Path of Life, and make the Uphill, as well as the Descent, less painful; nay, even your common Affairs and Oeconomy are so situated, that you really want a reasonable Woman, and a faithful Friend, in whom you might confide. Will you not think me vain, if I say you are deprived of such a Person by our Separation? When I consider the Opportunities I lose of endearing myself to you by numberless nameless Acts of Love and
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
Gratitude, I lament each passing Moment, and regret my fleeting Youth; for, oh! I want unnumbered Ages, beyond the common Date of Man, to prove my fond, faithful, grateful Soul to thee: Oh! never may the Veil of Passion cloud it more.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></P>
<P>What I meant to take Notice of in your Letters was, to reprimand you for even sup∣posing it possible I should ever cease to love you. This Subject, which you too often enter upon, always alarms me; for, if ever I should love you less, it must be owing to yourself. I assure you, that it never once enters into my Head, but when you mention it; and, upon such Occasions, I naturally reflect upon every Circumstance, in our past, present, and future Lives, which might possibly effect such a Change; which is, by no Means, a healthful Contemplation. On the contrary, when my Thoughts and Reflections are left to my own Guidance, I direct them to your Conversation,
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
to your Letters, to your Kindness to, and Con∣fidence in me: I compare you to any other Woman, and, taking you all in all, give you your Advantage. I beg Leave to put you in Mind, that this is not the first Time, by many, that I have warned you against this Indiscretion; but your Wit does not always give Way to your Sense;
<Q><L>And, when we grasp the Happiness we wish,</L>
<L>We call on Wit to argue it away.</L></Q>
I have taken a great deal of Pains, well re∣warded, to gain your Love; but have taken a great deal more to teach you how to preserve mine. That my Happiness depended upon it, was not so strong a Reason to me, as that I be∣lieved yours rested upon the same Foundation: And I have been always more your Friend than your Lover; not by exerting the first Character, which my Sense and Reason sufficiently inclined me to; but by restraining the latter, which my Heart so strongly impelled me to: And my best Love, my first, my last, my only Love, shall always find the Exercise of both these Characters exerted toward her, while there is one Quality in her charming Composition, which can be the proper Subject of either; or, rather, she is very near being that clever Creature, which is ca∣pable of happily blending both these Affections in one; for which nothing more is necessary, but to use that Understanding, upon all Occa∣sions,
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
which you are capable of exerting upon some: Nor did I mean to be ridiculous, when I said you should not comb your Head, or call a Coach, without consulting it; for you cannot imagine to what mean and trifling Offices good Sense will condescend to accompany us; and, perhaps, it is in what the World esteem Trifles, that a good Understanding should most employ itself; for great or extraordinary Occasions ge∣nerally direct their own Operations.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> There is a Gentleman in the House where I am, at present, who has lately read his Recantation, in order to preserve an Estate of about 70 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> He has a Brother at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> who is a beneficed Priest, from whom he received a Letter this Morning, so full of Fire and Brimstone, that it had almost thrown him into a Fit of Despair: But I had the good Fortune to quiet his Mind, after a Quarter of an Hour's Conversation; and he begged I would reduce my Reasoning upon this Subject into the Form of a Letter, which he would copy, and send to his Brother. I did so; and, as he has just done with it, I send you the Original inclosed.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your religious Exhortation, and brotherly Admonition, which I must ac∣knowledge
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
to be in the Stile of a Priest, but not in the Spirit of a Christian; both for the same Reason, that it so boldly and ignorantly denounces Damnation against those, who differ from you in controverted Opinions and Forms, even though, in Essentials, you should both agree; as if the God of the Universe was but a King of one Nation of Men, and declared War against all those, who refused to submit to the same Policy. This I speak, in general, with Regard to the uncharitable Sentiments of the whole Body of Christians, against the Professors of every other Worship, in the rest of the World. But, as to the Points in Question between you and me, let me fairly state the Case between us.</P>
<P>We believe and adore the same God, and have the same Faith in the Trinity: We also observe the same Principles of Morality, hinted first to the antient Philosophers by the Light of Reason, and afterwards more fully illustrated, and made obvious to the meaner Capacities, by the divine Grace of Revelation. We both de∣rive our Doctrines from the same Text of Holy Writ, and are, therefore, both of the one only true and universal Church.</P>
<P>The only Difference, then, between us, is, that in the Infancy of Christianity, making it's Way through the Errors of Judaism and Heathenism, it necessarily contracted a great
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
deal of the Foulness of Superstition in it's Pas∣sage, and grew up incumbered with many idle Forms, and useless and absurd Ceremonies, which are by no Means authorized from Scrip∣ture. There was likewise a good deal of Time∣serving in the first Preachers after the Apostles; for they were but Men, and the Grace of In∣spiration ceased with the Apostles. These Men, then, finding it impossible to propagate this new Faith, pure and intire, against the superstitious Prejudices of antient and established Modes of Worship, at least with that Dispatch which their Zeal required, temporized with the Cere∣monies and Idolatries of the Nations round them, in order to be the better received among them. They thought, perhaps, that, as this Religion was first established by the Power of Miracles, it must be maintained so; and then introduced that absurd and unphilosophical Doctrine of Transubstantiation. They thought too, that to give Men Hopes of a Redemption, even after Death, and by the Merit of another's Devotion, would naturally allure them to the Embracing this new Faith; and so published the Doctrine of Supererogation, which unluckily contradicts another, broached at the same Time, of Purgatory, in the most express Manner; as the last supposes, that no Person can be virtuous or religious enough to save his Soul intire, before he dies, therefore must necessarily pass
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
through a Purgation; and the other supposes, that a Man may not only perform sufficient Acts to secure himself, but the Overplus of his Merits may go toward the Salvation of another. This Contradiction puts me in Mind of the old saying, that
<Q>Lyars should have good Me∣mories.</Q>
Now you are drinking from the polluted Stream, while we have recurred up to the pure Fountain, and original Source. Our Religion is deduced from the plain Text of the Scriptures, your's from the sophistical Comments of the Priests. When a Priest once asked a Protestant, where his Religion was before <HI>Luther,</HI> he answered humourously, but not less justly, by asking him, where was his Face before it was washed?</P>
<P>As for your Doctrine of seven Sacraments, which you say we are deficient in, I answer, that we receive the Essence of them all in our two; and the fewer Heads any Proposition is divided into, the less Confusion there will be in the Comprehension of it.</P>
<P>In short, you seem to have more of the Sub∣tilties of the Schools, in your Reasoning, than the Purity of Religion, which, the more simple it is, is the more divine.</P>
<P>What you say, with Regard to the Saints, Martyrs, Virgins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not only Idolatry, in general, but that particular Species of it imbibed by the Church with it's Nurse's Milk; for the
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
assigning separate Charges to them, over Na∣tions, Trades, Distempers, Perils by Land and Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the same Error among <HI>Roman</HI> Catholics, which Theologicians attribute to the Heathen <HI>Romans,</HI> who are said to have wor∣shipped the only true God, but mistook every Attribute for a distinct Deity.</P>
<P>I shall trouble you no farther now, upon these Subjects; but conclude, that, if Religion be your Trade, I would have you stick to it; for a better you cannot get, for that Purpose: But, if it is your Science, quit it for a more virtuous and rational one, and you can hardly go amiss.

<P>I HAVE filled one Letter so full of Business, that I had not Room to take Notice of the pretty Part of your last; but I shall not suffer the Post to go out without a Letter, intirely in Answer to the refined Scruples you hint at in your's.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111"/>Your Love for me does not destroy your pre∣sent Happiness, but rather constitutes it. Those Apprehensions, and that Uneasiness, which some∣times afflict you, are not, indeed, Part of your Happiness, but are the natural Consequence of it, in tender and delicate Minds; for Absence, or Fear of losing, affects us always, in Pro∣portion to the Height of our Enjoyments. Now those who desire their Pleasures to be less, in order to rid themselves of their Pains, know not what they wish for: Apathy is a wretched Ex∣change for fond Sensations, even with all their Incumbrances; and to prefer such an Indolence of Mind is, as if a Man should refuse an Estate, because it was subject to Quit-Rent.</P>
<P>As for your extraordinary Notion, that per∣haps your Love and Fondness for me may af∣fect your Happiness hereafter, this must be your own Fault, and not the Nature of the Thing, if it should. The Love of God, and the Love of Man, are very different Things, and both made our express Duties, by distinct Command∣ments: Therefore the latter cannot become a Crime, of the Nature you apprehend, even by it's Excess; for parallel Lines can never inter∣fere, though extended infinitely: But the smallest Portion of mortal Love, or any other worldly Affection, rises into a Sin, when it intersects, or runs counter to our Love of God, the Duties of Religion, or the Morals of Virtue. Now
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
there is nothing, surely, in our chaste, sincere, and constant Regards, toward each other, which can possibly violate any of these high Concerns; but rather strengthen us in them, by inspiring our Hearts with the most grateful Sense, toward Providence, and possessing our Minds with the warmest Devotion and Thanksgiving, to the Almighty, for our mutual Happiness.</P>
<P>To a Mind rightly formed, the Paths of Heaven are strewn with Roses, not stuck with Thorns:
<Q><L>For Heaven is paid, when Man receives;</L>
<L>T'enjoy is to obey.</L></Q>
And the Possession of all the Pleasures of Life, bounded by Reason and Religion, beyond which alone we taste the Bitterness of the Draught, leads us not a Step out of the Road to Hap∣piness hereafter; referring every thing to God, hymning out his Praise, and submitting ourselves implicitly, and humbly, to the Justice, Good∣ness, and Wisdom of the divine Dispensations, whenever Heaven shall think fit to withdraw any of it's <HI>free Gifts</HI> from us.</P>
<P>As for the Concern and Unhappiness we shall unavoidably feel upon the Disappointment or Loss of those Things, which our fond Hearts are set upon here, you need not moralize so rigidly upon this Subject; for this Grief, like the Sighs and Tears which are the Consequence of bodily Pain, will be attributed, by him who
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
made us, to the Weakness of that Nature with which he was pleased to cloath our Souls; and, in either Case, it is not our Feelings, but the Repinings, Impatience, or Despondency, which create the Crime.</P>
<P>You see I have here renewed the Strain of our former Correspondence; for I am always pleased to enter into Subjects with you, when∣ever you give me an Opportunity; and, if you would more frequently write to me, in such a Manner as your last Letter, to shew the Deli∣cacy of your Sentiment, and the Excellency of your Heart, you would do yourself infinite Service, in the Improvement of your own Mind and Virtue, in the Securing of my Love and Esteem, and, at the same Time, afford the most extreme Pleasure and Pride to my dearest <HI>Fanny</HI>'s constant, sincere, and fond Husband,</P>

Nor would change even those Pains thy Absence gives me, for the dull Insensibility in which the common Race of Mortals pass their Lives; though I confess these Pains imbitter every Hour of Life; for even while you are with me, my Thoughts are continually filled with the sad Idea of our Parting;—and, indeed, it is dreadful to think of passing the Morn of Life, the Season for tender Converse, domestic Happiness, and so∣cial Joys, the Remembrance of which should gild the down-hill Path, the Evening Tide of Life, in a State of Separation from all we love! to have the fleeting Days of Youth pass, like a Dream, unmarked by any pleasing Aera, or in∣teresting Event! Not but I agree with <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> that they know not their own Interest, who wish never to be separated from
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
those they truly love;
<Q>for Solitude is some∣times best Society; and short Retirement urges sweet Return.</Q>
But mine is, I think, a perpetual State of Banishment; for the Months you are from me appear like Centuries, and the few Days you are with me fly away like the Moments of a dying Man, who knows he has but one short Hour to live; or seem, at best, but like the wretched Exile's Interval of taking Leave for Life.</P>
<P>However, I will, henceforward, remember that Happiness is reserved for Immortality; and learn to consider those Anxieties, which the Ten∣derness of my Affection sometimes occasions, as the Purchase of that Felicity, which it has, and I hope will still continue to produce; I mean the redoubled Joys of meeting.</P>
<P>What you say, with Regard to the Resent∣ment I express'd upon <HI>Tom</HI>'s Behaviour, is very just; but I own my Nature is warm, and im∣patient of Injuries, especially when they are loaded with the vile Weight of Ingratitude; but, believe me, <HI>Harry,</HI> I have a Heart as tender, and a Hand as open to soft Compassion, and to melting Charity, even as your generous Self; but I confess, with a Kind of Pride not to be described, that, in the stoical Habitude of sub∣duing the first Impulse of Passion, and attending to the Dictates of Reason and Humanity, you have, as in every thing else, a considerable Ad∣vantage
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
over me. You are, indeed, the steady <HI>Rock,</HI> that keeps one even Course, and I the unsettled Cloud below, liable to the Gust of every varying Wind, which veers it from it's purposed Bearing.</P>
<P>There is really something singular in my Af∣fection for you, which makes me triumph at every Mark of your Superiority in Sense or Virtue, even over myself; and I feel a more exulting Pleasure at being excelled by you, than I should in being superior to all the World beside. Perhaps this may be owing to my having placed my chief Merit and Happiness in the Tenderness and Excess of my Love, (and there alone I will not yield the Prize, even to you;) and as every new Proof of your Worth confirms and justifies the ruling Passion of my Soul, I am doubly pleased and grateful for it.</P>
<P>I will not yet despair of your Success with your <HI>petrified Patronymic</HI>; for I depend on your Perseverance; and constant Dropping wears at length the <HI>Marble:</HI> Besides, you find that the Proposal you made him, two Months ago, has at last made it's Way, and penetrated into his most obdurate Brain. So I take it for granted, that your last Offer is travelling the same round-about Road, and may, in the same Time, arrive, much fatigued with the tedious Barrenness of the Way, at the same Inn; and truly I think an Inn a proper Simile for his Brain, where neither
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
Sense nor Science take up their Rest, where every thing passes in dull Rotation, and leaves no more Impression than
<Q>the Remembrance of a Guest, who tarrieth but a Night.</Q>
If I were Genie of the Black Isles, mentioned in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tales, I would certainly take Measure of him, with my Wand, for a compleat Suit of Marble; his Wig, at least, should
<Q>eternal buckle take in <HI>Parian</HI> Stone.</Q></P>
<P>I should have been glad to have known, from the ossified Man, <HI>which</HI> I hear is deposited in <HI>Dublin</HI> College, whether his Mind partook of his Body's Disorder, and if his Heart grew hard in Proportion as his Nerves grew rigid; for if that be the Case, I would have the Gentle∣man, in Question, anointed with Oils, like an Olympic Wrestler; for indeed I believe an Act of Generosity would be a gymnastic Exercise to him; and I would have him put to sleep in a Tub of Goose-Grease, to increase his Sen∣sibility.</P>
<P>Forgive me, <HI>Harry,</HI> for making so free; but I think it is better to laugh than cry, at Things which we cannot remedy; for I do not believe, what poor <HI>Lear</HI> makes a Question of, that there is any Cause, or Cure, in Nature, for hard Hearts.</P>
<P>Your Observation, about <HI>Charles</HI>'s Uneasiness, at being separated from his Wife, is, I believe, very just; for I own I think him incapable of
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
that delicate Tenderness, which renders Absence painful; but it is very possible he may be uneasy for the Reasons you assign; the Difficulty of Disuse, when Men are governed more by Habit than Reason; the miserable Vacuum which this has left in his Mind and Time, and which he is at a Loss how to fill up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for there is not, I believe, a more helpless Mortal breathing, or one less qualified for Solitude: His poor vague Mind is neither imbued with Religion or Philo∣sophy, nor stored with Ideas enough to enter∣tain himself, or any one else, for half an Hour; and, as he is generally much fatigued with Bu∣siness, and cannot read, he must necessarily fall asleep, whenever he is left to himself; and such a Situation would make one regret the Loss of any Sort of Companion; therefore I heartily pity the poor Man.</P>
<P>I should be very unhappy, if I doubted the Sincerity of your last Paragraph; but indeed I do not, for you have given me many kind Proofs to illustrate it; and you may believe me, in Return, when I assure you, that I would be content to give up half the Duration of my Life, to be cer∣tain of spending the Remainder of it with you; which is, however, no great Compliment; for all the Time you are absent I consider myself in a State of Annihilation, as I am deprived of the principal Spring, or Movement, which actuates this little Machine; or, rather, like a Clock,

with the striking Weight taken off, which is silent, though the Pendulum moves, and only expresses itself by the <HI>Hand,</HI> as I do now: But, though I am dumb to every one else, I find, as you may have <HI>long</HI> since observed in this <HI>long</HI> Letter, a vast Inclination of prating away to you; and should go on with this running Pattern, without any Ground, for an Hour or two more, but that the Piece of Mechanism, I have been alluding to, has, luckily for you, just now informed me, that the Post-Office will be shut in five Minutes. <HI>Adieu!

<P>I AM almost ashamed to acknowledge the Re∣ceipt of my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s last Letter. I ab∣solutely blush, while I think of it. I can bear any thing better than Praise, which I do not deserve: Yet Praise from you will always be pleasing to me; for, though I may be conscious I do not merit it, yet I cannot distrust your Sin∣cerity; and sure I shall always be delighted with your thinking I am what I would wish to be.</P>
<P>I, by no Means, doubt your receiving much Pleasure from such a Bundle of my Letters coming at once to your Hands. My Idea of it is like passing a Day together. Though the
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
Subject was often changed, the Discourse was continued; while a single Letter appears like a short Visit, where the greatest Part of those Moments, we should wish to employ more agreeably, is taken up with the Form of coming in, and going out: Yet, I confess, I would rather see a Person I loved, for half an Hour every Day, than be debarred that Pleasure for a Month, though I were certain they would then stay a Week with me; for I think the
<Q>Joys of Meeting harldly pay the Pangs of Absence.</Q>
This may be owing to an Im∣patience in my Temper, which I would gladly correct, as it occasions me many melancholy Hours; for, alas! the greatest Part of my Life is passed in a State of Separation from you; and even when you are with me, the Certainty of parting, at such a Time, embitters the present Pleasure. Pardon me, when I tell you, that I have often suspected your Love, when I have seen you quit me, with as much Indifference as you would a common Acquaintance; while my poor foolish Heart has heaved, and Eyes strained to follow you. I know you have so strong an Understanding, as would, were you possessed of such a fond Weakness, get the better of it; and yet, at this Moment, I swear (I speak from my own Heart) I wonder how you can bear to be so long, and often, absent. There is, I fear, but one Way of accounting for it;—
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
but, as I will not now say anything, that might appear ill-natured, I will leave you to guess at my Meaning. I am, however, at this Time, well pleased at your seeming indifferent to our part∣ing; for I am now almost determined to take a long Adieu of my dear, dear <HI>Harry</HI>; and indeed there is not any thing will contribute so much to make me easy, as thinking he is so. I will not dwell longer on this Subject, but wait your Answer to my last Letter; for my Determination shall, on this and every other Occasion, be only the Result of your Opinion, or Desire.</P>
<P>I parted from <HI>Kitty,</HI> at —, this Morning: She pressed me much to go with her: I own, I was strongly prompted by Inclination to accept her Invitation; but durst not venture, without your Consent. <HI>Nancy</HI> has promised to make her a Visit, by next <HI>Thursday</HI>'s Stage: If you do not think it improper, and I do not hear from Lady —, I shall gladly accompany her; but if you have any, the least Objection, or are ap∣prehensive of any ill Consequence from my going, I conjure you, by your Love, to speak freely, and prevent me.</P>
<P>Lady —'s going to settle in <HI>France</HI> is not a sudden Start: She always said she would go, whenever she had completed her Affairs here: That Time is come; and I must either lose, or follow her.</P>

<P>BELIEVE me sincere in my Praises of you; for, upon that Subject, all Hyperbole is lost in Truth. Whether, indeed, you really deserve all that I think, which is ten-fold more than ever I said of you, I cannot tell: Nay, sometimes I fancy not; only for this Reason, that I am afraid there is not, in Reality, any Woman in the World so charming, as I imagine you to be; yet your Merit is the same to me, which is ca∣pable of inspiring me with such pleasing Ideas; as it amounts to the same, let Sceptics wrangle ever so long, whether there is such a Thing as Matter in the Universe, or whether it is only a Spirit, which has the Power of conveying such an Idea to our Senses. And, as the amiable Opinion I have of my dearest <HI>Fanny</HI> makes up most of my Happiness in this Life, I shall con∣sider
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
it as <HI>Cicero</HI> does an higher Subject,
<Q>that, if it should be a Mistake, I would not part with the Belief of it, for a Certainty of the highest Good, in this World.</Q></P>
<P>Your Simile, with Regard to your Letters, has a pretty Fancy in it; and there is a good deal of the same Kind of Turn in many of your Writings, which has often made me declare, that I never met with any thing, in the episto∣lary Stile, so very clever, as they are; so that, even abstracted from the Consideration of their coming from you, and being addressed to me, I do not read any thing, which gives me a more refined Entertainment.</P>
<P>I take it very unkindly, your seeming to sus∣pect me of the least Indifference to you. When∣ever I can be near you, how few Hours am I from you? And, be assured, it is my Misfor∣tune, not my Fault, that I am not constantly with you. If I do not always part from you with the Appearance of that Fondness, which you might expect, it is owing intirely to that Temper, which I have endeavoured to practise myself into, as I have very little of it from Nature. No Man has more Tenderness, or soft Affection about his Heart, than I have; and my Philosophy, which is not of the Stoic Kind, does not make me feel less in myself, but only serves to save Appearances to the rest of the World. How often, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> have I
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
most earnestly intreated of you never to say any thing of that Kind to me again? and, if you re∣collect yourself, you will find, we have had very few Disputes, but upon this Subject.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXIII. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I RECEIVED your's by the Stage, and that by the Post, within the same Hour. I am, however, obliged to you for your Design of ex∣pediting it, though it did not answer.</P>
<P>I have somewhere (I think in the <HI>Spectator</HI>) met a Comparison between the Effect, which Praise has on a generous Mind, and fine Weather, on a Thermometer. I like the Si∣mile, and think it might be carried a great Way. I am not ashamed to own, that I re∣ceive the highest Transport from your Praise: It raises such a noble Emulation in my Mind, as would, were my Power equal to my Will, render me worthy of it. I think there is a Kind of Inspiration in your Praise, which might lead me to any great or virtuous Act: Add to this, that it sets my Faults and Foibles in the strongest Light. I consider you as the Person, who has bestowed the Merits you approve of;
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
and find myself ashamed of every Weakness I discover in myself, which may lessen them. In short, it has the same Effect on the Qualities of my Mind, which our Belief of the divine Om∣nipresence ought to have on all our Actions. May my dear <HI>Harry</HI> continue still to see me with the same Eyes of Fondness, 'till, by never ceasing to desire, I, at last, deserve his Praise! and so, as you somewhere say,
<Q>strengthen Habit into Virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding your repeated Interdictions, I must ask one Question: Why should you en∣deavour to get the better of that natural Softness, you say you are possessed of? why lay yourself under a Restraint, to appear indifferent to the Woman you love? You cannot be ashamed of that Passion, which is the Boast of human Nature. If then you thought the Object worthy of your Tenderness, why should you wish to suppress it? nay, why not boast
<Q>the graceful Weakness of your Heart?</Q>
I must say, you are a Laggard in the Race of Love: I have out-stripped, and left you far behind:
<Q>My <HI>Anthony</HI> is fat, and scant of Breath.</Q>
At the Hazard of every thing, that is dear to me, I have proclaimed my Fondness; and do you blush at your's? Indeed I claim no Merit from the too public Confession of my Love:— I could not help it; for
<Q>I am made a shallow, forded Stream, seen to the Bottom, all my Clearness
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
scorned, and all my Faults exposed.</Q>
My Nature is not capable of Disguise; nor do I wish it were.—I hope we shall never dispute on this, or any other Subject: I do, indeed, believe you love me; and shall conclude with your own Quotation,
<Q>that, if it should be a Mistake, I would not part with the Belief of it, for a Certainty of the highest Good in this World.</Q></P>
<P>I am sorry I ever thought of leaving <HI>England:</HI> It has cost me much Uneasiness. I am still un∣determined. I fear my Resolution will not stand the Shock of quitting you: Believe me, I have nothing else to encounter:—My Interest and Pleasure both point the Way; yet still I loiter here. If my Going were fixed, I should suffer as much on your Account, as my own. Ab∣sence, and a strong Probability of never meeting more, might, perhaps, make us both regret our having ever met. The Delicacy of my Love is shocked, by supposing we shall ever repent our mutual Affection, or Engagements; yet, under the Circumstances I have mentioned, it is not impossible that it should happen. While we retain the pleasing. Expectation of seeing each other, our Thoughts are all employed on the approaching Joy, and every intervening Object appears scarce worthy our Regard: But, were we parted with a moral Certainty, that Years must roll before we meet again, would it not be natural to seek for a Consolation among those,
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
who could best make Amends for the Loss we had sustained? and who can say to their Heart, "thus far shalt thou go, and no farther?"— You have loved before, and may again. This Thought, I own, disturbs me: But why should I torment myself with (I hope) groundless Fears? for I will not part with thee.—Let me be satis∣fied that you desire my Stay, then find the Plea∣sure, or Advantage, that shall force me from thee.—Let not this Confession put you under any Restraint; for this be assured of; though, at your Desire, I would chearfully forego every other Happiness in Life, I will, if you require it, as readily embrace the Prospect of an everlasting Separation:—My Heart shall only feel, not speak it's Anguish. Here give me Leave to re∣mind you of a Conversation we had on this Subject some little Time before you left <HI>London:</HI> The Amount of it was, that, when I left the Kingdom, we should no longer maintain any Correspondence, but mutually endeavour to forget each other. To this I stedfastly adhere: For why should we strive to make each other more unhappy? If I go, I again repeat my Desire of not seeing you: Indeed I could not bear it.—But I do not think I shall go.—I will let it rest intirely upon you.</P>
<P>I told you, in my last Letter, I had given up the Thoughts of going to the Country; yet I long to see you; and, could I as easily go to
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
you, as you can come to me, I would not com∣plain of Absence. I have much to say to you; but, if I leave <HI>England,</HI> my Thoughts and Faults be buried with me!—Though I have no Right to expect a Letter by To-morrow's Post, I hope for one.</P>
<P>I have not <HI>Pliny</HI> by me now: But, though I am ignorant of the Text, I admire the Com∣ment; which I beg you will continue. I look on it, at present, as I should on a large Sum of Money, which I had in reserve, to purchase some particular Pleasure, at a stated Time. I therefore, again, desire you will go on in∣creasing my little Hoard, more valuable to me, than all the Wealth of <HI>Croesus.</HI></P>
<P>I intend going to the Rock To-morrow, for two or three Days. I have found prodi∣gious Benefit from bathing. I am grown al∣most as fat as you are. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter upon the Subject of your leaving <HI>England</HI>; of which you desire my Opinion. I refer my dearest Life to a former Letter, wrote upon this Occasion:
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
The Particulars of it I do not, at present, re∣collect; but am certain of this, that my Senti∣ments are still the same, as both my Love and Friendship for you are so. In short, I shall neither consent to it, because it is agreeable to your Inclinations, nor dissent from it, because it is irksome to mine; but shall venture to let it rest upon a more infallible Principle, by referring my Heart's best Love to Lady —'s Determi∣nation about the Matter. Her Sense can direct, and her Goodness will support you. May Heaven bless you! And, if I could, at any Time, recommend myself to Providence, with that fervent Devotion, which my Soul feels, at present, for you, I should think, at that Mo∣ment, it were a Bliss to die.</P>
<P>When you first mentioned Lady —'s leaving the Kingdom, I confess received a Shock, which I could not account for: I did not know her enough to feel any personal Concern at her Loss; but your last Letter has given me some Superstition, which could never affect me, if my Spirits were not as low, as they are at present.</P>
<P>It was extremely unkind, at this Time, to mention your Letters, after the Manner you did. You speak of quitting the Kingdom; and, at the same Time, grudge to leave me even your Picture, more estimable than any that <HI>Titian</HI> ever drew. When you desired me merely to
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
return them, you were cruel only to me; but when you requested me to destroy them, you were unkind to the World, which may, perhaps, one Day see them. I despair of any, the smallest Portion of Fame, from my own Writings; but to be loved and praised in your's, may render my Name immortal. So <HI>Phaon</HI> will be ever remembered: But the same Fate cannot attend us both; for he, from his Inconstancy, as <HI>Pope</HI> strongly expresses it, is but
<Q>damned to ever∣lasting Fame.</Q></P>
<P>I shall not dwell any longer on the Subject of your Letter, because, indeed, I find myself too much affected with it; and I cannot, in my present Temper of Mind, think of <HI>Pliny,</HI> or any thing else. — So I shall make my Letter shorter, than I am ever inclined to do to you.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with a Saying of some of the Philosophers,
<Q>that the Grief at losing a Thing, and the Fear of losing it, are equal.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXV. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WOULD have answered your's of the 7th last Post; but my not being well, joined to the present unsettled Situation of my Mind, had so much lowered my Spirits, that I feared my Letter would appear to you of the splenetic Cast.</P>
<P>I now return my Thanks for the very elegant Compliments you make me. To deserve them, would be too high a Boast for the most perfect of my Sex; yet I confess, though conscious of my Want of Merit, I feel a secret Pleasure, mixed with Pride, (not Vanity,) when praised by you. Though I am, perhaps, naturally vain, I find myself humbled, by the very Means which might be supposed to raise it. I look on the Compliments, you make me, as I should on a Picture, which, though I had sat for, the Painter, from the Elegance of his Fancy, not Judgment, had made a finished Beauty. I am, however, proud of that Affection, which can, to the very few Merits I possess, add the Multi∣tude I want, and place me in such a Light, as it should be my utmost Wish to appear in.</P>
<P>I have much to tell you about our Lady —. I am, at present, a good deal surprized at not hearing from her. She has wrote for her Chil∣dren
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
to leave Town on <HI>Wednesday.</HI>—Is it not strange she did not mention me? Though I cannot account for it, I am resolved to give her Credit for acting right: She must have strong Reasons for altering her Purpose. I neither can, nor will suspect any Change in her Friendship: She gave it me voluntarily, unmerited, and un∣sought; and, should she withdraw it, I have not any Right to complain;—but I will not torment myself with anticipating what I should, indeed, think a severe Misfortune. To-morrow's Post may, perhaps, clear all.</P>
<P>I wrote to desire your Opinion about my going with <HI>Nancy.</HI> I have changed my Mind, in that Particular, and think of it no longer. If I were certain of going to <HI>France,</HI> I could not bear the Agony of a last Parting; which, I am sure, that would be: The Pain is already past; why should I renew it? We are separated; let us remain so.—If I stay in the Kingdom, it would be an idle Frolic, and might be attended with disagreeable Consequences.—I will not go there, on any Terms.</P>
<P>Your last Letter has almost distracted me. How can you write with such tender Concern, yet leave me in Suspence? When I apply to you, my Guide, my Director, for Advice, why refer me to another? Is there a Creature breath∣ing, on whose Love, or Friendship, I ought to depend, more than your's? I hoped there was
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
not: If I have been deceived, it is equal what becomes of me.—I will not indulge a Thought so injurious to your Honour, and my Peace. How can you say it is agreeable to my Inclina∣tions to quit <HI>you</HI>? for I neither think or speak of any other Tye.—In Return for your unkind Suspicion, I might tell you, that Thought was suggested by your Wishes, rather than Opinion. You know my Heart hangs on you; you are it's Support, and the sole Source of all it's Hap∣piness, or Misery; and is it possible you can suspect my Love? Does not your own Heart bear Witness for me, and contradict so cruel an Aspersion? Unkind, ill-natured <HI>Harry!</HI> —Per∣haps I wrong you. My Concern transports me beyond the Bounds of Reason. You could not mean to injure me so highly.</P>
<P>The Concern, you express, at my leaving the Kingdom, shall, for the present, prevent my taking any Steps towards it, 'till I have your Opinion in more explicit Terms; for by that only I will be determined. What can prevent your giving it freely? You certainly know what you would have me do; and you are bound, by every Tye, to direct and guide my little Bark through all the Storms of Life.</P>
<P>Though I should be glad my Letters were destroyed, I will not, if I go, desire to deprive you of them: Their Value is owing to your Opinion: The insisting on them would be some∣what
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
like stealing your Reputation; impoverish∣ing you, without enriching myself. It would give me the greatest Uneasiness, if I thought they would be ever seen by a third Person. They were wrote from my Heart to your's, without a View of extorting Praise; and were never designed for the unfeeling Vulgar. I have not any Apprehension of their being made public. You will not, for your own Sake, expose my Weakness to the World; and I dare swear there is not another Person in it, who would think them worth the Trouble of reading. I confess I have often wished for so much Ge∣nius, or poetic Fire, call it which you please, as might transmit to Posterity an Idea of my Affection for you, and
<Q>graft my Love im∣mortal on thy Fame:</Q>
But that Wish, like most of mine, is vain. <HI>Apollo</HI> denied my Suit, though seconded by the antient, not modern, <HI>Cupid</HI>; but made me large Amends, by pro∣mising that my Name should be immortalized by you.</P>
<P>I have this Instant recollected, that on this Day Twelvemonth I first saw <HI>Belvidere</HI>: Will you forgive me, if I say, I wish I had never seen it? What an infinite deal of Anxiety have we suffered for each other, since that Aera! and who can tell where it will end? Believe me, my Heart's dear <HI>Harry,</HI> this Reflection affords me as much Uneasiness on your Account, as on
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
my own: I fear we were born to make each other unhappy.—This, I own, is a Reflection unbecoming the Woman you love; but still I am a Woman; and, though I think your loving me would make Amends for every Distress, that could befal <HI>me,</HI> I cannot bear to consider myself as the Cause of any Misfortune to <HI>you.</HI> Had we not met, at that unlucky Crisis, I should, at this Time, have been happily in∣different to all your Sex; and you, perhaps, might have been fortunately engaged in the laudable Pursuit of some more worthy and amiable Woman.—But, as I am so far a Pre∣destinarian, as to believe
<Q>whatever is, is right,</Q>
I think there seems a Kind of Fate in our Reconciliation. We have mutually given up the Prime of our Lives to each other; and, after an Acquaintance of almost six Years, we find our Love, Friendship, and Esteem, in∣creasing every Day.—Does not this look as if we should spend the calm Evening, as well as the Noontide of our Lives, together? I will indulge this Hope, cast every black, and gloomy Thought behind, and rely on the Opinion I have of your Love, and the Consciousness of my own, for all my future Happiness. — Do with me what you will; bid me go, or stay; I will chearfully conform to whatever is most agreeable to you.</P>
<Q><PB N="135" REF="136"/>
<L>My Thoughts shall fix, my latest Wish depend,</L>
<L>On thee, Guide, Guardian, Kinsman, Father, Friend.</L>
<L>By all these tender Names be <HI>Henry</HI> known</L>
<L>To <HI>Fanny</HI>'s Heart; and grateful let him own,</L>
<L>That she, of all Mankind, has lov'd but him alone.</L></Q>
<P>I beg you to excuse this wild Rhapsody. My Thoughts are not reduced to any Kind of Form: They are filled with Love, Grief, and you. If I had wrote last Post I would not send this: I am quite ashamed of it: Indeed it is sad inco∣herent Stuff. Can you blame me for not being Mistress of myself, when I think of parting from you? I have done nothing but weep since I received your last Letter. If you consent to my going, do not write so tenderly; for it will only make our Parting more painful.</P>
<P>I have yet a thousand Things to say to you, but cannot speak them. I have already said too much; yet, like a peevish Child, I go on sob∣bing to myself, after my Reason tells me I should have done.</P>
<P>Adieu, my ever-dear, my best-loved Friend! May Happiness, equal to my Wishes, attend you through every Scene of Life! and may we

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I said your going to <HI>France</HI> was contrary to my Inclinations, I did not mean selfishly; it was my Fears and Appre∣hensions of many Kinds, which made my Sen∣timents doubtful about the Matter: And when I said it was agreeable to your's, I did not mean to upbraid you for the Want of any, the least Part of that Affection, and kind Regard, you have so generously bestowed upon me; but merely alluded to the great Hopes, and sanguine Expectations, which you had formerly from this Scheme, and which, I thought, depended on too many Hazards, to be hastily ventured upon. For both these Reasons, therefore, I referred a Determination in this Matter to Lady —, because her Patronage and Protection would obviate a good deal of my Fears, and justify a great deal of your Hopes; and in that Case I should submit, though in any Case I could never consent. Be well assured, my Heart's fondest Wish, that no Distance in this World,
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
nor Chance in this Life, can ever alter my Love, my Friendship, my tenderest Regard toward you; for, as I think it is impossible they can ever improve, I am certain, from late Experience, and frequent Reflection both upon you and my∣self, that my warmest Affection, highest Esteem, and sincerest Attachment both to your Person and Merits, will last during our Lives, and can only be increased or improved hereafter.</P>
<P>Your mentioning the first Day you came to <HI>Belvidere,</HI> has made me recollect, that I am but about a Year old; for I cast every Day out of my Aera, before the Time I may be truly said to begin to live; though, as I reckon my whole Existence only with regard to you, I shall thus divide it: The 12th of <HI>May,</HI> 1746, I was born; the 6th of <HI>November</HI> following I was christened; and the 13th of <HI>August,</HI> 1750, I became of Age; and I should deem that the Day of my Death, upon which we should ever be parted. Your visiting this Recess has made me in Love with Life, and every Enjoyment of it; it has made my own more my own; so that I may say, you have bestowed it on me —
<Q><L>For what Purpose, Love?</L>
<L>But to be frank, and give it thee again.</L></Q>
Accept then the Dedication of this Temple and these Plains, these Groves and Springs: The Hamadryads are your's; the Fawns—not

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE you desire me to continue my Notes upon <HI>Pliny,</HI> I shall go on with that Subject again.</P>
<P>The first Epistle of the third Book puts me in mind of Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Wish about the latter Scenes of his Life, hinted at in one of my former Letters to you; and in the Passage I here allude to, for Want of better Light from History, he supposes after what Manner <HI>Pliny</HI> passed the Decline of Life; but I think the latter Part of the Letter, I am now upon, affords a strong Presumption of this Supposition; and, as <HI>Pliny</HI> desires <HI>Calvisius</HI> to keep that Letter by him, in order to judge of his Philosophy, so shall we remember Lord <HI>Orrery</HI>'s Declaration with the same View. I think the Character of <HI>Spurinna</HI> not unlike his own; and there is one Circumstance hinted at, when he takes the Air in his Chariot, in which they happily agree. In this Letter there is a pretty Distinction between being pleased, and being proud of a Thing.
<Q>The only Mark of Age he discovers, is Prudence.</Q>
This is a fine Trait.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140"/>In the sixth Epistle of the same Book, in the Comment on it, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> gives us a gay Ode, to divert our Thoughts from the melan∣choly Prospect of an old Man; which is like the merry Epilogues, they give us often, after our Tragedies. This Argument has been treated pro and con in the <HI>Spectators:</HI> But for my Part, I always chuse to retire with the Bier; for sober Thoughts do me no Harm, as I can be grave, without being melancholy. I am surprized his Lordship should say an old Man was a dismal Sight; for a Person, who views all Things
<Q>In the calm Light of mild Philosophy,</Q>
regards with equal Eyes both Youth and Age; nay, I cannot think it requires any great Strain∣ing of Philosophy to bear even our own Decay, as there are Pleasures and Solations indulged by Providence to every Stage of Life; and, to a Mind rightly turned, perhaps, not the least to the last; and, if any Uneasiness arises in our Senescence, from a nearer Prospect of the Grave, it is unbecoming a Christian, who rests in Hope.</P>
<P>There is something extremely elegant, and a fine Address of Compliment, in several of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Epistles, with a certain <HI>Tour d'Expression et de Sentiment,</HI> which is observable in the Writings of the best and politest <HI>French</HI> Authors. I shall give you but one Example, among many; because I would not prevent you, as you have
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
not gone through his Works. It is in the eighth Epistle of this Book:
<Q>And, since it is equally excellent to merit and confer Benefits, I see you are resolved to lay Claim to the Praise of both, by giving to another what you have deserved yourself.</Q></P>
<P>In the Observations upon the second Epistle of the fourth Book, my Lord, after his humane Way, reprimands <HI>Pliny</HI> for his frequent Abuse of <HI>Regulus</HI>; which, as I hinted, is an Instance of his Humanity, but not of his Judgment. There are many Men of vile Deserts, so far beyond the Reach of Laws, that there is no Way to punish them, but by Satire or Invective; and I believe that several People, naturally vicious in themselves, have been restrained within the Bounds of social Morality, not from Respect to the Tables, but out of Fear of being
<Q>damn'd to everlasting Fame.</Q>
From the whole Tenor of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Character, and it is this Way we should judge of Men, he inveighs against <HI>Regulus</HI> from a virtuous Rage, rather than from Hatred, Malice, or any Un∣charitableness. This puts me in Mind of a Sentiment of your's, upon some such Occasion as this, which may not be improperly repeated here: It is upon the Subject of Revenge;
<Q>As a Passion, it is a Vice; but, as a Principle, a Virtue.</Q>
Pursued with Malice and Ill-nature,
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
upon slight or common Provocations, it is a Passion instigated by the Devil; but great and real Injuries, proceeding from extreme Vice and Immorality, call aloud for Justice, and then Vengeance becomes a godlike Principle. Perhaps it would be a proper Criticism here, to distinguish between the Words <HI>revenge</HI> and <HI>avenge.</HI></P>
<P>In the latter Part of the Comment upon the fourth Epistle, there is a very just Observation, That it is absolutely necessary for us to be as wary in the Choice of our Amusements, as of our Studies: For which Reason, I have often thought, that there wanted extremely such an Office to be established in all States, as a general Reveller; who should prescribe and preside over the Amusements, Pleasures, and Diversions of all Ranks, all Professions, and all Ages of Men, even from their childish Years; which would be an Institution of admirable Service to the World.</P>
<P>Read the whole nineteenth Epistle, and the Comment upon it. I fancy there are some Passages in both, which will strike and please my dear <HI>Fanny</HI>; and, in order to leave the Impression on your Mind, I shall put an End to this Letter, with the Addition only of an Allusion to one of <HI>Prior</HI>'s Poems,

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXVIII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SUPPOSE, by my not hearing from you last Post, that you do not get my Letters regularly; which, I hope, is owing to your being retired to the Rock, though you have, at present, extreme bad Weather for Bathing. I have a melancholy Prospect before me for my Wheat Harvest, and I have the greatest Quantity, and the best in this Country; most of which is lodged by the Rain, and shedding by the Wind. Mais vive la Philosophie!</P>
<P>I hope to have a Letter from you To-day; but cannot get it, before this goes to the Post: So I shall go on with my <HI>Pliny,</HI> which I never read, but when I am to write to you; and, as I undertook this Work merely for your Amuse∣ment, so I find it now, for that Reason, if I had no other, the pleasantest Manner of reading: It is certainly the most improving Method too; and, if I had a great Fortune, I would allow a good Salary to a Librarian, who should <HI>antecede</HI> my Study, and mark out to me only those Passages, which were remarkable or ingenious, improving or entertaining; as I would give my new Shoes to a Servant to wear first. The Person, I would employ for this Purpose, should
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
rather be one of a refined Taste than of deep Learning, and of more natural Understanding than great acquired Knowledge. In short, my dearest <HI>Fanny,</HI> you should be my <HI>Minerva,</HI> my Preceptor; for even from your Fragments I might hope to grow rich in Wisdom, and to be <HI>polished into Virtue.</HI> This last Expression has made a Sentiment occur to me, that there is a certain refined Taste, (Parsons may call it Grace, if they will) which, unless born with a Man, the best-disposed Christian will be but an heavy, unformed Lump of Morality. What is that Reverence for the Antients, that humane Love for our Cotemporaries, that generous Benevolence for Posterity, that tender Sense for another's Sorrow, that high Relish for a Stranger's Happiness, and, lastly, that noble, philosophic, heart-thrilling, and religious Ardor, which possesses the whole Soul with enthusiastic Rapture, upon the Contemplation of the asto∣nishing Greatness of the Works of Providence, and the infinite Goodness of their incompre∣hensible Author? What are all these refined Pleasures owing to, I say, but to a natural Taste and quick Relish for Virtue; to a certain gifted Capacity, large enough to comprehend the whole intellectual Universe; that is, all Man∣kind, past, present, and to come; and reaches so high, as to embrace even God himself? all which a plain, good Man has no more Idea of,
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
than we can of the Pleasures of a sixth Sense. <HI>Addison</HI> has somewhat the same Turn of Thought with Regard to Piety, when he says,
<Q>that some People want Parts to be devout, and could as soon make an Epic Poem, as a fervent Prayer.</Q></P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Pliny,</HI> who is properly enough introduced after such a Subject, as carried me beyond myself just now.</P>
<P>The twenty-first Epistle of the fourth Book is an extreme pretty one. I wept for the <HI>Helvidiae,</HI> not so much for their Death, as for <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Grief at it.</P>
<P>In the next Epistle there is a poetical Wit∣ticism in the Allusion of the Arrow; which is, I think, the first Instance of that Kind, I have met with in this Author.</P>
<P>I am charmed with the whole twenty-third Epistle. That truly noble and philosophic Ex∣clamation, wishing for that Stage of Life, when he might live to himself, transports me. There is nothing, for which I despise a Person so much, as the paltry Wish to be younger; a childish Longing for a Bib and Bells again! He must have spent his Life very ill, or mean to do so, who would desire to return back to any Aera of it; for we are, at any Stage, capable of Virtue.</P>
<P>In the twenty-eighth Epistle, <HI>Pliny</HI> has mis∣taken the Matter, with regard to Painting; for,
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
I think, it is a much easier Matter to copy a Picture, than to draw from the Life.</P>
<P>In the last Epistle of this fourth Book, he mentions a Spring, which ebbed and flowed. There is a Well some Miles from this, which is reported to do the same. I never examined into it, but shall ride over there some Day, on Purpose.</P>
<P>I am surprized, that any Person of common Sense could mistake the Legacy, which he was so pleased with, Epistle I. Book V. for that from <HI>Curianus</HI> was the only one, which did him Honour. He says,
<Q>A small Legacy is fallen to me;</Q>
which shews, he was telling his Friend something new: And the former Legacy was above two Years before, at least; for he says, that the Suit, with the Coheirs, was of so long standing. The Mistake of the Com∣mentator's could never have happened, but from the mere Force of Prejudice; which has amazing Powers, in many higher Instances. <HI>Pliny</HI> first speaks of <HI>Pomponia</HI>'s Favour, to which it was natural to apply his Expressions of the Grateful∣ness of the Present; and, leaving the Reader in this Error, almost during the whole Letter, what he says at last, tho' it breaks with full Day upon you, could not open the Eyes of Prejudice.</P>
<P>In the fourth Epistle you may see the extra∣vagant Fees, which were given to Lawyers, in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Time. This may make us a little better
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
reconciled to the Extortion in our own Days: Though, to view this Matter in the Light of political Morality, the present Exorbitancy ought to alarm us extremely; for, the higher Law or Justice is vended, the scarcer it must be; and the Poor, who need it most, will, consequently, have least of it. Then Oppression reigns, and Liberty is no more; and then is a State in the proper Crisis for a Revolution, either by Rebel∣lion at home, or Invasion from abroad. At the Time <HI>Pliny</HI> hints at this Extravagance, the great <HI>Roman</HI> Empire was hastening to it's Ruin.</P>

<DATELINE><HI>Musaeum.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OUR Assizes are over, and I am returned to myself, that is, to you. I wait not for the <HI>Pleasure</HI> of hearing from you, but amuse myself, in the mean Time, with the more imperfect <HI>one</HI> of writing to you. I am now retired among my Books, the best Part of which Library I esteem your Letters; for they not only teach me Wisdom, but promise me that glorious End, of which Wisdom is the surest Means, Happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148"/>I have read some Pages this Morning in the second Volume of <HI>Orrery</HI>'s <HI>Pliny</HI>; but should not, at this Time, think of entertaining you out of this Author, if I had not from thence a fair Opportunity of addressing myself more particularly to my Heart's only Aim.</P>
<P>You may remember, that you rallied me upon not taking Notice of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Epistles to <HI>Calpurnia,</HI> in my former Remarks; but I de∣fended myself, upon there not being any in the first Volume. The fourth of the sixth Book, which is the first of the second Volume, is the first of these Epistles. I confess myself charmed with it; and am the more particularly fond of her, as, from the Hint of her Constitution and Make, she seems to resemble you; as you, in Return, do her in this; that I think you would deserve, on the like Occasion, a Letter full of the same Fondness, and Tenderness, and con∣jugal Regard. Whenever I raise a Statue to <HI>Pliny,</HI> I will have that whole Epistle inscribed on the Pedestal.</P>
<P>The two first Lines of the fortieth Page con∣tain a very fine and a just Sentiment. From the second Paragraph of the Comment upon this sixteenth Epistle, you may draw a Comparison between <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> by observing, that the little Jingle, and affected Turns, in both their Writings, were rather the false Taste of their Age, than the Vices of the Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149"/>The Reflection in the seventeenth Epistle, that
<Q>he, who envies another, must be his Inferior,</Q>
is fine.</P>
<P>At the End of the Notes upon the fourth Epistle of the seventh Book, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> wishes that this Letter had perished; I suppose, because it betrays a little Vanity about his trifling Per∣formances in Poetry. He is very often angry at him, when he shews a Weakness of any Kind; because it is natural for us to wish those, we love or esteem for some Qualities, perfect in all. Now I am not quite so severe in this Matter: "Non ego paucis offendor Maculis." Human Nature has many Foibles; and, when I perceive some in a great Character, I suppose I see the whole Man; but, when a perfect System is presented to me, I suspect the Genuineness of the whole; for, as I conclude a Part is acted somewhere, I think it possible it may be done throughout: Which gives me Occasion to re∣mark upon the only Foible, I ever could object to my own <HI>Calpurnia</HI>; that I have now begun to consider it like a Tree or Shrub, which happens sometimes to be met with in forming the regular Alley of a Parterre; which, though it would be out of Rule to plant it there, would betray a Want of Taste to root it out.</P>
<P>The first Paragraph of the fifteenth Epistle gives me an Opportunity of renewing my Remark upon one of the Epistles of the first Volume:
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
I forget which of them; and, as I have returned you that Book, I cannot set myself right now; but it is where he comes very near preferring a Life of retired Leisure to public Business; but dares not speak quite out, for the Reasons there mentioned. In the Passage of this Letter, which I am now quoting, he says,
<Q>I <HI>dare</HI> not say my Life would be better, but certainly it would be happier, if my Studies were my sole Employments.</Q></P>
<P>I think, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> has mistaken that Passage in the eighteenth Epistle, where <HI>Pliny</HI> says,
<Q>The Land itself will never want a Proprietor;</Q>
for <HI>Pliny</HI> seems to consider this Farm with a View of setting it, not of selling; and therefore rather wants a Tenant, than a Purchaser. The ori∣ginal Expression <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>By whom the Land is occupied</HI>; which distinguishes a Tenant from the Owner of the Soil.</NOTE>, "à quo <HI>exerceatur,</HI>" seems to warrant this Sense.</P>
<P>On the nineteenth Epistle, <HI>Faulkner</HI> makes a remarkable Blunder in the Comment, about the Genealogy of <HI>Fannia</HI>; but, indeed, the whole Edition of this Book is very faulty.</P>
<P>In the Observations upon the twenty-fifth Epistle, my Lord quotes, as a Proverb, this Sentence:
<Q>He, that is not for me, is against me;</Q>
by which he seems not to recollect, that it is a Passage in Scripture, and spoken by
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
our Saviour <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> ii.23.</NOTE>. I am sure, if he had been aware of this, he would not have introduced it so lightly here.</P>

<P>I AM infinitely obliged to my dearest Life, for the Kindness and Constancy of his Letters: They have, indeed, almost made me Amends for the Pangs of Absence. I know nothing else that could have soothed, or even amused my Mind, but those dear Pledges of your Love. I confess I never felt such severe Anguish in my Life, as at our last Parting; and, though you appeared so then, I do not now believe you was indifferent. A thousand Circumstances con∣curred to render it more painful to me, than any of our former Separations. You have kindly obviated the most material; and I shall now endeavour to forget the past, and only look for∣ward with the pleasing Hope of our Meeting.</P>
<P>The Gentleness with which you treat my greatest Fault, will, I flatter myself, have a better Effect, than the severest Reproof.

<P>I RECEIVED no Letter from you by <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night's Post, so suppose there was not any Certainty, or Alteration in your Affairs, at that Time, worth recording. I have sent to Town,
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
expecting a Letter by <HI>Thursday</HI>'s Post, and am very sure I shall not be disappointed. I hope the Letter itself may not disappoint me.</P>
<P>Since I received Lady —'s last Letter, I have had frequent Struggles with myself about answering it. If I do not answer it, I suffer the Correspondence to drop on my Side; which is unpolite: If I do answer, I may seem to pre∣sume too much upon an occasional Adven∣ture, and thereby be deemed unworthy of the Honour proceeding from it. Upon the whole, I have determined in the Negative, and sacri∣ficed my Inclinations to my Prudence, upon this Reasoning; that few Men can deserve such high Honour, by their Merits; but almost any Man may appear not unworthy of it, by his Modesty. One particular Thing, which tempted me to write, was, the occurring of some farther Thoughts upon that comfortable Subject of the Mercy of God; which was Part of my Letter to her; and which I did not carry as far as I might, with a little Reflection, at that Time, lest it should look like a premeditated Essay, what was, in Rea∣lity, but an occasional Occurrence; though, after what Manner hinted to me, from any Part of my Letter, I cannot, at present, recollect.</P>
<P>The only Objection which Divines make to the unbounded Mercy of God, is his infinite Justice; for, say they, Justice is concerned about punishing the Wicked, as well as re∣warding
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
the Virtuous; and the only Scope they will allow to Mercy, is Remission upon Re∣pentance.</P>
<P>Now let us consider the Matter impartially among ourselves; for observe, there is nobody by, but you and I.</P>
<P>In the first Place, it is high Presumption to pretend to reason about the Attributes of God; and all Definitions of this Kind may be con∣sidered
<Q>like the Eye in Prospect, whose, Strength can find no End; but Weakness makes one.</Q>
The Qualities and Faculties of the human Mind, from whence they vainly argue, may have (and it is more than probable) so little Relation to the divine Mind, that there may not be even any Analogy between them; and may, perhaps, to a Spirit capable of con∣ceiving both, be as different Ideas, as Sound and Colour.</P>
<P>But let us dispute with them, upon their own Terms, and speak of God as Man; and let us agree, for the Sake of Argument, that, though the Qualities of a human Creature certainly bear no Proportion to the Attributes, they may, however, have such a Relation to them as Time has to Eternity; and thus we may come to a clear Method of reasoning upon this Subject.</P>
<P>Human Justice then, as blended with human Passions and human Policies, may be defined a Retribution of Rewards and Punishments; but,
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
to consider it in the Abstract, I do not think that even human Justice comprehends the latter Part of this Definition; for Punishments are inflicted either to revenge or to deter. Now, with Regard to the first, a Legislature is dis∣passionate; and, with Regard to the latter, I am sure, that if a Man could commit any Crime, which it was impossible for him, or any body else, ever to commit again, it would be a Cru∣elty to allot any Penalty for it; because, in this Case, the Benefit of the Example would never operate. In this State, then, I look upon our Souls in the next World; as having committed Offences, which we can no longer repeat, and the Punishment of which can then no more avail us, or serve as a wholesome Example, to deter others; nor is God a Man, that he should be angry.</P>
<P>I shall not add any thing farther upon this Head, but just to observe to you, that the De∣finition of Mercy, as it is given in the Beginning of this Discourse, absolutely annihilates the Virtue, by making it only Part of another; for Forgiveness, upon Repentance, is not a distinct Operation, according to that Sense; but merely a Piece of Justice. If I forgive my Debtor, he is obliged to my Generosity: But, if he pays the Debt, he releases himself; and I but perform common Equity, by giving up his Obligation, upon Conditions performed. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXXII. <HI>FRANCES</HI> to <HI>HENRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE unsettled, and, of Course, uncom∣fortable Situation I have been in, these three Months, makes me feel a very sincere Satisfaction at being able to date this Letter from my own Apartment, or, rather, your's; for I cannot, will not call it mine, 'till you have blest it with your Presence. Haste, then, my dearest Life, my kindest Love, my All, my Being, haste, and restore your <HI>Fanny</HI> to the En∣joyment of herself in you! bring to her Wishes, to her Transports bring all that can make Mor∣tality endured, and render Immortality still more desirable!</P>
<P>The Impatience of my fond Desire to see you, has hurried my Imagination into a Kind of Rhapsody; but I own I should think it a Crime to love you after the common, sober, insipid Manner; and, if Excess of Love be pardonable in any Woman, I may stand ex∣cused. My Constitution is naturally cold; nor could it be warmed into Love by an Object less worthy, than my Heart's dear <HI>Harry.</HI> This Declaration, which is, indeed, a true one, may well secure you from any Fear of Change in my Heart: I wish, both for your Sake and my
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
own, that I had Merits sufficient to furnish me with the same Security. But, as your Love and Constancy outweigh even your other Merits to me, I will rest satisfied, from my Dependence on them, though conscious of my Want of Worth to deserve them, in any other Way, but by returning them an hundred-fold.</P>
<P>I cannot help saying, I am sorry the Corre∣spondence, between Lady — and you, is at an End; though, I am certain, you judged it right.</P>
<P>Though we can have no perfect Knowledge of the Attributes of God, I cannot think it Pre∣sumption to form an Idea, according to our finite Capacity, that he is just and merciful. If we believe the Bible to be a Work of Inspira∣tion, we must assent to this Opinion. If we consider it as the Work of mere Man, un∣assisted, uninspired, it appears, that the Result of natural Reason, as far as <HI>finite</HI> can compre∣hend <HI>infinite,</HI> has given us an Idea both of the Almighty and his Attributes; and sure it cannot be criminal to employ that Reason, which he hath bestowed upon us, in Contemplation of his Excellence. The Fault, which I think the Generality of Men, and particularly Divines, run into, is not the Reasoning on the divine Attributes, but daring to set Bounds to what their poor finite Capacities cannot comprehend. —I cannot, by any Means, agree with you,
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
that it is probable there should be no Analogy between the divine and human Mind. We believe God to be all-wise, all-good. We must change the Idea of these Attributes into Folly and Cruelty, if we supposed he did not form the Faculties of our Souls by the most perfect Model—by himself; though he confined their Operation within a narrow Sphere. But when we shall put off this frail Mortality, that now clogs and incloses the Faculties of our Souls, I do believe they will be enlarged; and of what Use could they be, had they no Analogy to the divine Being, in the Contemplation of whose endless Glory and Perfection our chief Happiness will, I presume, consist?</P>

<P>AS I am still in the same disagreeable Way, with Regard to my Health, I would not write to my sweet Love this Night, but to prevent his Apprehension of my being worse. There is something extremely odd in my Dis∣order, as there is not the least Alteration in it. Time has, however, lessened my Feelings, but not abated my Complaints. I own I am greatly alarmed at my Illness; but I will not say more on a Subject, which, I am sure, occasions you almost as much Pain as me.</P>
<P>I will not, by any Means, accept either of the Epitaphs, you offer me, unless I should survive you. (What a Thought was that!) Forgive me, Heaven, when I say, thy Joys, as far as my poor finite Views can reach, could hardly counterpoise my <HI>Henry</HI>'s Loss. I will not, can∣not bear to part with thee. My Spirits are much too low, to be able to get the better of this melancholy Reflection; and, believe me, <HI>Harry,</HI> fully certain as I am of the Mercies of

my Creator, I find no Pang in the Thoughts of dying; nor do I think I should find a Sting in Death itself, but that of being torn from thee, my Life, my Soul, my Immortality! and could I call it "an Escape, a blest Exchange?" ah! no:—I must want much of that passionate Re∣gard I feel for thee, e'er I can think it Bliss to part from you. I'll not endure the Thought.</P>
<P>I hope, indeed, you will take Care to see me laid in some Place, where Death shall not divide our poor Remains;

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dearest Life,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much alarmed about your Disorder, and extremely concerned at it. For Heaven's Sake take Care of yourself. Go early to Bed, though you lie awake three Hours after it; and get up early, though you should be obliged to dose in the Middle of the Day for it. Consider, my Heart's Passion, my Mind's Reflection, my Life's Happiness, and my Soul's Hope, that all these precious Concerns depend upon you, and are employed about you. If I had a more fa∣vourite Scheme in View, than your Felicity, or imagined to myself any Transport, but through that Means, you might then, perhaps, be at Liberty to trifle away your Time and Health, upon Persons who have neither Sense or Taste enough to conceive your Merits, nor Tender∣ness or Love to be affected by them. Re∣member now, my warmest Wish, that I trust you with yourself; and surely the high Confi∣dence of so dear a Pledge deserves, at least, that it shall not be impaired in your Keeping.</P>
<P>Since you do not approve of my Epitaphs, I beg you will frame others more to your Fancy; or, rather, let the Actions of our Lives form the
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
Mottos for our Graves. It was finely said of <HI>Socrates,</HI> when called upon by his Judges to make his Defence,
<Q>I have been doing nothing else all my Life.</Q>
<HI>Montaigne</HI> observes, very justly, upon the Subject of Death,
<Q>that the Philosophy of the Schools but increases, by Prepensity, the Terrors of it; and only pre∣pares us for the Preparation.</Q>
What signifies all the Sophistry deduced from the Considera∣tion of the Mortality of our State, that we had Life itself but upon these Conditions,
<Q>that Death, a necessary End, will come when it will come?</Q>
with other Quibbles of the same Kind.—The only Way to make ready for Death, is to prepare our Lives for it. Actions, not Words, can comfort us at such a Crisis.</P>
<P>After so solemn a Subject as this, it may ap∣pear light to mention such a Trifle, as I am going to speak of, but that, in Truth, though I expect to be laughed at, I have some Scruples of Conscience about it. There is a Butterfly in my Study, which would be dead some Time past, but that I watched it, at the End of the Season, and have frequently revived it by the Warmth of my Breath, every Day since; and you cannot conceive the Pleasure I receive, when I feel it flutter in my Hand, upon such Occasions. By this Means I have prolonged it's Life beyond the Date of Butterflies. Now perhaps I am coun∣teracting the Order of Providence, and may
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
deserve the Punishment of <HI>Promotheus,</HI> for steal∣ing Fire from Heaven, to animate his Man of Clay: Perhaps too, I am but making this poor Insect linger out a Life in Pain; for I believe no Creature, but Man, ever received Pleasure from any thing which was contrary to Nature. In short, I begin to fancy I am guilty of such a Cruelty, as the keeping a Man awake all Night, by Way of adding so many Hours to his Day. Should any Physician discover an Elixir, which might equal our Lives to the Age of the Pa∣triarchs, would he not deserve to have his own cut short, for tempting Men to cheat themselves of some Portion of a glorious Immortality, merely to lengthen out some Years of Misery, here below? The Gymnosophists have a fine Sentiment; that we are, in this Life, but in a State of <HI>Conception</HI>; and that Death is our <HI>De∣livery.</HI> A Man, then, who has lived beyond the Bounds prescribed by Nature, may, perhaps, be considered, in the next Life, as a monstrous <HI>Birth.</HI> For my Part, I desire not to die before the ordinary Fate of human Nature; but, at the same Time, wish, with <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>Nec turpem senectutem degere,</L>
<L>Not to consume a loathsome Age.</L></Q></P>

<P>I DO not, indeed, think it would be possible for me to support myself, under the very dis∣agreeable Situation I am in, both of Body and Mind, were it not for the Pleasure I receive from my dear, dear Life's kind Letters. I own I am jealous of Solitude; and cannot help being uneasy, when I think your Fondness for that must, by Degrees, lessen your Love for me: And, should I ever be so happy as to live with you, my Company, or Converse, may appear an Interruption to your Scheme of Life: It will, of Course, grow distasteful, and I unhappy. I only speak my Fears, not my Opinion; for that shall always be guided by you; nor will I doubt your Love, your Truth, and Constancy.</P>
<P>I am vastly alarmed at hearing, from your Brother, you do not intend coming to Town. I will not believe you could form so unkind a Resolution: Pray answer me directly, will you come, or no? and when, if you do come, may I expect to see you? You cannot conceive what a Shock this Report gave me. My whole Life is, indeed, spent in waiting for you: I count every Hour an Age, 'till we meet, and would gladly
<Q>imp the Wings of Time, which thy
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
Absence clips.</Q>
I rejoice, every Night, that a Day is passed, and that I am so much nearer the happy Aera, I had fondly fixed for our Meeting. In short, I should have no Idea of Time, or it's Limits, but from the Expecta∣tion of seeing you. Yet, notwithstanding my earnest Desire, let me intreat you not to think of coming, unless it be quite convenient to you.</P>
<P>Though I object, from selfish Views, to my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s Love of Solitude, I perfectly agree with him in thinking the Generality of People and Conversations, we meet with, to be mostly disagreeable; at best, trifling and insipid, and quite incapable of affording that Delight, which should arise from the Converse of rational and immortal Beings; yet do I think Life would become irksome, and every Virtue stagnate in our Souls, were they not called into Action by a Desire of being approved by some particular Person.
<Q><L>Nature, in Zeal for human Amity,</L>
<L>Denies, or damps an undivided Joy:</L>
<L>'Tis Converse qualifies for Solitude,</L>
<L>As Exercise, for salutary Rest:</L>
<L>By that untutor'd, Contemplation raves</L>
<L>A lunar Prince, or famish'd Beggar dies;</L>
<L>And Nature's Fool, by Wisdom's, is outdone.</L>
<L>Needful Auxiliary is a Friend, to give</L>
<L>To social Man true Relish of himself;</L>
<L>Full on ourselves descending, in a Line,</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="166"/>Pleasure's bright Beam is feeble in Delight;</L>
<L>Delight intense is taken by Rebound;</L>
<L>Reverberated Pleasure fires the Breast.</L>
<L>Celestial Happiness, whene'er she stoops</L>
<L>To visit Earth, one Shrine the Goddess finds,</L>
<L>And one alone, to make her sweet Amends</L>
<L>For absent Heav'n—the Bosom of a Friend:</L>
<L>Where Heart meets Heart, reciprocally soft,</L>
<L>Each other's Pillow to Repose divine.</L></Q>
Oh! were I capable of being that pleasing, kind, and rational Companion to my <HI>Henry,</HI> my Bliss would be compleat. I would, with Transport, quit the World this Moment, if I might be Par∣taker of thy Solitude in the most distant Desart; nor cast a Wish, a Sigh, or Thought away on aught on Earth;—for thou to me art all. And yet, perhaps, we never shall spend a single Day together, in that delightful, undisturbed, peace∣ful Retirement, which we both pant after.—My Spirits were low before: This Thought has sunk them quite.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear giddy Girl,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND you, inclosed, the Cover of your last Letter, which you see was sent without a Seal. Through what Perusals it has passed I cannot say; but am glad it has escaped the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library of Manuscripts, to arrive safe to my Hands, at last.</P>
<P>You have no Reason to apprehend, that my Fondness for Retirement can ever seclude you from my Society: That Taste, or Turn of Mind, which gives me a Disrelish to Conversa∣tion in general, does but create in me a stronger Impatience for the Enjoyment of your's in par∣ticular. I own that my Passion for Solitude has grown very strong in me of late; but must con∣fess, that I should chuse to carry it no farther, than to that blessed State, which <HI>Adam</HI> rejoiced in, between the last Creation and his Fall:
<Q><HI>Adam</HI> relating, she sole Auditress.</Q></P>
<P>I agree with you, that the Approbation we expect from virtuous Actions, is a very high In∣citement to them; and the Love of Fame, so strongly implanted in all Mankind, has always appeared to me a very good Proof of the Soul's Existence after Death, even of it's eternal Existence: For, as this is a Passion,
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
which nothing less than Immortality can gratify, it would be impiously charging Providence with inspiring us with a Desire, which we were never designed to possess the Enjoyment of, were we to exclude the Hope of an Hereafter.</P>
<P>As the Immortality of the Soul, and the Ex∣istence of a God, have been often made use of, as reciprocal Proofs, I shall add a few Words, upon this last Subject, to the many excellent Arguments, more at large insisted upon by the Divines. If Infidels, or Sceptics, deny, or doubt the Certainty of an intelligent Providence, yet surely the Belief of it ought to be received, as we give Credit to the <HI>Copernican</HI> System; if not for it's Demonstration, at least, because this Hypothesis accounts for all the Phaenomena of the celestial Bodies; which would otherwise ap∣pear a Heap of wild Incoherence: And rashly to deny a Thing, because we cannot compre∣hend it, is such a Pyrrhonism, as to affirm we cannot see, because we are not sufficiently in∣formed how we see: For to say we see by our Eyes, is unphilosophical; for our Eyes are but the Organs of Sight; that is, the Instrument, not the Cause. In looking up through the Chain of Effects, our Reason hesitates at a cer∣tain Period, which we presume to be the first Cause; though, beyond our Comprehension, the Links may be infinite, before they reach the first Cause; and, then, to say we cannot com∣prehend
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
that first Cause, is but a Sort of Defi∣nition of it; for, if we could comprehend it, it could not be what we must suppose it.</P>
<P>Ever since you attacked me so well upon my Hint, that, perhaps, there was as little Analogy, as Comparison, between the Virtues of Man, and the Attributes of God, I have been re∣volving that Subject in my Mind; for we should have Reasons, even for our Doubts, in so high a Matter; and, the more I consider it, the more am I confirmed in an Opinion, which was but a Surmise, at first. If we stick to the Religion of Nature, we can, indeed, only say, perhaps there may be no Relation between them; but when we come down to Revelation, we shall find many express Authorities to sup∣port my Argument; two of which I think suf∣ficient to produce. What Notions of Justice can the human Mind supply us with, for the Curse derived to all Mankind from original Sin? Then, again, Part of the second Cammandment says,
<Q>I will visit the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children, to the third and fourth Genera∣tion of them that hate me,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> What human Equity is there in this? Is not the Crime of hating God, in the proper Sense of that Expres∣sion, sufficient to incur the Punishments de∣nounced against the Wicked, without involving us in our Parent's Guilt? Perhaps it was from such Instances as these in Scripture, that the
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
Papists have deduced their absurd Doctrine of Supererogation; for, if we are to be damned by another's Sin, it may be reasonably implied, that we may be saved by another's Merits. Upon the whole, I shall conclude with another Passage from the Scriptures,
<Q>that the Wisdom of Man is but Foolishness, in the Sight of God.</Q>
Away, then, with all presumptuous Reasonings of this Kind; but let us submit our Minds to Faith, and begirt ourselves to good Works.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED no Letter from you last Post, and cannot know whether I shall hear from you by this, 'till I return To-morrow to —. It was unkind in you to neglect writing, when you knew how uneasy I must be to have some Account of your Health. I saw <HI>Kitty</HI> Yesterday, who heard from some of her Friends; and, by not mentioning you, I hope this Omission was not owing to your Disorder.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171"/>I had a wild Night of it, coming here, and have not been so wet, since I was last in the River. I had no Cloaths with me, but what I had on my Back; so I have betaken myself to my Bed; from whence I am now writing to you, and drinking your Health, and my own too, in Milk-Whey. My kind Landlady, who is also my Tenant, upon Notice of my coming here To-day, has washed my Sheets in the Morning, and my Room in the Evening, to make me welcome.</P>
<P>I observed an extraordinary Phaenomenon, as I came along. The Night was extremely dark, and the Rain fell excessively: Notwithstanding which, the whole Mountain, I rode over, seemed to be on Fire, with such an ember Light, as is seen after the Blaze of a Bonfire is gone out. I asked my Guide the Meaning of it, (whom I hired at the Foot of the Hill,) and he told me, that all the heathy Grounds here∣abouts have this Appearance, by Night. This is certainly a very great natural Curiosity; but what I never observed, or heard of before. If this were real Fire, it might put this Part of the Country into a terrible Combustion, as the Collieries happen to meet in the Center of these Hills.</P>
<P>This Thought led me insensibly on to the Consideration of the general Conflagration, which is prophesied in Scripture; and which
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
our Faith makes us expect, at a certain Period, from some extraordinary Act of divine Power; but which I never heard accounted for, from the Philosophy of Nature, as it stands at present. I shall therefore amuse you, and myself, with an Hypothesis for this Purpose; and may, sometime or other, hereafter, refer it to wiser Heads than ours, whether there be any real Weight in this whimsical Opinion of mine, or no.</P>
<P>I must first give your a short Account of Astronomy. This Globe of Earth, as well as all the Planets of our solar System, revolves about the Sun; which Rotation is effected from the compounding of two different Powers; the <HI>Centripetal,</HI> which is the common Gravity of Bodies, that mutually attract each other, and, if acting alone, would occasion the Earth to be swallowed up by the Sun; and the <HI>Centrifugal,</HI> which is a Force impulsed upon all the Planets, at their Creation, that directs them forward, in a right Line, and, if not counteracted by the first Power, would propel the Body on, through in∣finite Space, to all Eternity. Now both these Powers acting, by the almighty Oeconomy, upon our Earth, at the same Time, occasion a Motion compounded of both these Causes; every Revolution of which is performed in that Period of Time, that is called a Year. From what I have said it is plain, that, if the <HI>Centrifugal</HI> Power was taken away, the Earth must rush
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
into the Sun, and so be destroyed by Fire. But this would be a particular Act of the Almighty; and my Philosophy is to explain the Possibility and Probability of this Effect, by plain and natural Means; which I apprehend may be occasioned by increasing the Weight of the Earth, and con∣sequently it's gravitating Powers: For I think natural Philosophers agree, that Bodies attract, in Proportion to their Quantity of Matter; which, at a certain Degree, will make the <HI>Cen∣tripetal</HI> overcome the <HI>Centrifugal</HI> Force. Now my Opinion is, that every living Creature, Man, Brute, Insect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has been produced since the Creation, has made an Addition of so much Matter to the Earth, as it's Weight came to at it's Birth. The Increase of Bulk, during it's Life, I make no Account of, because that proceeds from the Consumption of the Fruits of the Earth, which drawing their Nourishment from the Earth itself, alters only the Form, not the specific Gravity; but that Weight, which the Creature brings into the World, is certainly an Addition, because the Parent neither eats or drinks more, to bring the Foetus to Perfection, than if she were not pregnant; and, if tried in Scales, would be found to be of equal Weight, before, and after—except in the Case of Sickness, or hard Labour; neither of which is the natural Consequence of Procreation; as may be observed from Brutes, and other Ani∣mals;
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
and from the Generality of the human Species too, who have not weakened or de∣bauched their natural Forces by Luxury, Effe∣minacy, or Excess. I have no Library here, so must be excused, if I am not as full, and as correct, upon this Subject, as I might be, if I were among my Books: But I always write to you in the same loose Manner that Things occur to my Mind at first Thought; and often but just enter down Hints, to supply us with Topics for Conversation, when we are together.</P>
<P>I am particularly pleased at this Hypothesis presenting itself to my Reflection; as the ex∣planation of any Prophecy, by natural Means, is a stronger Motive to our Belief, than the mere Faith of it, from a Miracle. Now the Destruction of the World by Fire was de∣nounced, as I apprehend, long before the Laws of Astronomy, or the Gravitation of Matter, was sufficiently known, to authorize such an Hypothesis as this; and, as I am not quite or∣thodox insome Points, I own that I heartily re∣joice, when I can make Amends in others; and, in reasoning about Religion, or contemplating the Ways of Providence, I think we ought, in a stronger and more particular Manner, to apply an Observation, which I remember out of <HI>Lon∣ginus:</HI> That, in the reading of <HI>Homer, Plato,</HI> or any of those precious Spirits of Antiquity, when any Passages occur, to which we cannot readily
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
reconcile our Reason, we ought firmly to be∣lieve that, were those great Genii present to explain themselves, we should, to our Confusion, be convinced, that we only were guilty of those Errors, which we blindly charged upon them.</P>
<P>I think I may now lay myself down to sleep, esteeming this Essay in the Place of a Prayer: And may I have the Blessing of it in my Dreams, by meeting you there in perfect Health!</P>

Represent your Si∣tuation particularly to Lady —; for to me you have spoken only in general Terms; and strictly follow her friendly and considerate Advice. My Fortunes shall be your's, so use them freely; and that I did not offer this before, was from a Regard to your Character, which I have very nice and honest Reasons to be tender of.

In short, I am such an Adventurer in this World, that, if I have Luck, there's nothing in it; and if not, no Oeconomy can save my Fortune. A Year's Industry will not make me rich; but a Minute's Reflection can reconcile me to Po∣verty.

<P>Your Sentiment is both philosophic and re∣ligious, "that your present Distress may produce your future Happiness." <HI>Socrates</HI> said, he owed all his Philosophy to his Wife. Every Man should endeavour to be a Philosopher, not so much to support himself in Death, as to be able to endure Life; and, when Misfortunes or Mor∣tifications come upon us, instead of repining, we should thank Providence for the lucky Occasions of exercising that Virtue. A wretched Man has greater Scope for Virtue, than a happy Man; and a poor Man, than a rich.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXLII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dearest Life,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SENT off an Express to —, and reco∣vered your Letter of the third. I return you Lady —'s Letter, which is very kind. You cannot imagine what Pleasure your saying she stays here for the Winter has given me. It is a very lucky, as well as pleasing Circum∣stance for you, at this particular Time; which is enough to shew you, how happy this Account has made me. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></P>
<P>I shall go to Town in the Beginning of the Term; but am extremely uneasy to know what is the Meaning of the Hint, you gave me in your last Letter,
<Q>that you have something to say to me, which you will not mention, 'till we meet.</Q>
I beg, my <HI>Fanny,</HI> you will explain yourself by next Post.</P>
<P>I am now returned to <HI>Montaigne,</HI> which I quitted for <HI>Pliny,</HI> at your Request; and I make it a Rule to give you my Observations upon every Book I read.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>In his History of the three most excellent Men, he names <HI>Homer, Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Epaminondas.</HI> By Excellence, here, he seems merely to con∣sider this Expression, with regard to Fame only: But I think he has not, as one might expect, given us Examples from different Classes. The first is a Poet, the second a Soldier, and so is the third, when I expected a Philosopher; and here I would name <HI>Plato,</HI> or better, <HI>Socrates:</HI> But perhaps <HI>Montaigne</HI> considered <HI>Epaminondas</HI> in this Class, and in the highest Degree, as he is recorded to have practised what others only teach.</P>
<P><HI>Montaigne</HI> makes a good Defence for represent∣ing human Nature not much to it's Advantage; as, in general, the <HI>French</HI> Writers are apt to do: "Others make Men, I but report them."</P>
<P>I am pleased to find he had some of my Whims: He mentions one, which, you may remember, I sometimes hinted to you; of taking a particular Fancy to some one Glass laid down at Table, though of equal Dimensions with the rest, out of which I often take a greater Pleasure in drinking; nay, I have gone so far, once or twice, as to pay a Man's Club for the Exchange of his Glass. Whence such Caprices, as this, proceed, I do not remember that any of the Expositors upon human Nature have accounted; and I think it would be an ingenious and amusing Subject to inquire into.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183"/>This puts me in Mind of a Theme, I have a great Mind to recommend for a Premium to the Society of <HI>Dijon,</HI> in <HI>France</HI>; which is an Essay upon <HI>Metaphorical Taste</HI>; being a Liking, or Admiration, not confined to, or deducible from, the established Rules of Beauty, Harmony, Order, or Truth, which should be the natural or rational Foundations of our Approbation. Why is the Mind of Man, when endued with what is called Taste, delighted with extravagant Flights in Poetry, extraordinary Metaphors, Ex∣cesses in Grammar, Chromatics in Music, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> How come we to be charmed with Things, which offend common Sense, or shock the natural Ear? And from what Turn of Caprice does it proceed, that the very Errors and Faults of some of the Arts and Sciences are esteemed as Beauties? Nay, to shew that Taste is not only above, but even sometimes averse from rational Admiration, we need but recollect the Pleasure we receive from viewing some of the Deformities of Nature, as Rocks, Precipices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the same Time remember, that we are sensible of a certain Horror, during the Contemplation.</P>
<P>Have you seen that Piece, which carried the last Premium at <HI>Dijon,</HI> upon this Thesis, Whe∣ther the Re-establishment of Arts and Sciences has contributed to the Refinement of Manners? I have read it, and like the Side of the Question
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
he has chosen, by denying it. I think, the Subject might have been handled more at large, and to better Advantage, than the Author has done there.
<Q><L>Quid juvat innumeros scire atque evolvere Casus,</L>
<L>Si fugienda facis, et facienda fugis?</L></Q>
What does it import us to know the Springs of Good and Ill, while we do those Things, which we ought not to have done, and leave undone those Things, which we ought to have done? I have not yet seen the Answer to it; but, when I have, I shall probably determine the Dispute like Sir <HI>Roger de Coverley,</HI> by concluding "that much may be said on both Sides."</P>
<P>What the <HI>Genevan</HI> says of Learning with regard to Morals, I have often said of it with regard to Understanding — That it has so over∣loaded the Mind of Man, that, like too full a Stomach, the digestive Powers have not Room to exert themselves; or it has confined our Reflections, by setting Bounds to our Inquiries, or given us a Biass out of the right Road, by obliging us to think too much after one another, and following in a beaten Track. When Reason attempts to exercise herself in the Mind of the Learned, she finds it, like a Storehouse, so filled with the old Trumpery of the Antients, that she has hardly Room to stretch her Limbs. I am for recurring up to the Original of all
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
Things, and drinking Truth at the Fountain-head; not quenching my Thirst of Knowledge in polluted Streams. Rivers, in passing through populous Cities, acquire indeed a Softness and a Richness, but lose the Sweetness and Purity, which they brought from their Spring. If you want to inform yourself of Art or Science, withdraw to your Study; if of Truth or Nature, retire within yourself. Reading should be your Exercise, but Reflection your Study. Sense is a Bottle of Essence, which loses it's Strength by Dilatation; or like a Wedge of Gold, which, hammered into Plates, or drawn into Wire, extends it's Dimensions, but weakens it's Substance.</P>

<P><HI>ROchefoucault</HI> says,
<Q>In the Adversity of our best Friends we find something that does not displease us.</Q>
I will not absolutely say this Maxim is verified in you; yet I cannot help observing, with what vast Calmness you have endured my Misfortunes. I do indeed believe,
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
that the Distresses of others furnish the best Opportunity for exerting our Philosophy.
<Q><L>When they are lash'd, we kiss the Rod,</L>
<L>Resigning to the Will of God:</L></Q>
And then we have such a charming Superiority, by making light of those Misfortunes, which do not affect ourselves. But I should be glad to see one of our modern Philosophers endure the Loss of Health with that Indifference, they recommend to others.</P>
<P>If Lady — stays in the Kingdom, which is yet doubtful, she will not come to <HI>London</HI> the whole Winter. I heartily wish she may hold her Resolution of staying at —, as I hope and believe I shall spend some Time with her; for I am absolutely determined not to continue here long. When we meet, you shall know my Reasons; which, I fancy, will be sufficient to make you entirely of my Opinion: In the mean Time, I shall exert the little Strength of Body and Mind, I have left, to bear up against the Distresses of both, without complaining. I must intreat, for the present, you will not desire any Explanation from me; for I am resolved not to enter into Particulars, 'till I see you; which I never so earnestly longed for, as now. I could almost wish, you were as im∣patient to see me; we should then meet before "the Beginning of Term." However, a few
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
Days will make no great Difference; and I am content to wait, 'till Business answers the same End as Inclination.</P>
<P>Though I never wanted the Aid of Philosophy more than now, I find myself less qualified than ever to seek it's Help:
<Q>In Pain, Philosophy is Spleen; in Health, 'tis only Ease.</Q>
— Perhaps it is owing to my Want of Health, that I find my Mind a perfect Chaos. I have not Attention sufficient to read for a Quarter of an Hour. I perceive myself frequently absent in Company, without being able to recollect, what I was thinking of: Strange Situation! — When wilt thou recall me to myself? If you have fixed the Time of your coming to Town, let me know by Return of the Post, that I may be certified, not <HI>how long,</HI> but <HI>when</HI> I shall live.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED a Letter from you, just as I was leaving <HI>Belvidere</HI> Yesterday, which has surprized me more than any thing I have ever met with.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188"/>The Reason of applying those philosophic Lectures, which you are offended at, was from this Blunder: That I thought the Loss of Health, Fortune, Friends, or any other Unhappiness of Life, was the proper Season to recommend such Medicines; and it ought to be observed, I did not use such Reflections to shew how <HI>I</HI> could bear your Misfortunes, but to instruct and assist <HI>you</HI> to support yourself under them. He, who would comfort another, comes not, as I appre∣hended, with Sighs and Groans.</P>

<P>I RETURN you Lady —'s Letter, and am pleased to find, that you still hold on a Correspondence with her. I love her for rallying your Spirits. I am ashamed for my <HI>Fanny,</HI> with two such philosophic Friends, to be so cast down. She seems to solicit your writing often to her,
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
which surely I need not intreat you to obey; but shall only leave you more at Liberty to do so, by letting you know, that, if Time presses, I will take your having wrote to her, as a sufficient Apology for your leaving me to hunt through the Stores of Antiquity for something to amuse me, in the room of those Letters you neglect to me. How much do I regard your Advantage, before my own Pleasure? And for any Favour, she can ever do me, I thus pay the Price before-hand.</P>
<P>I thank you for your kind Sentiments with Regard to passing your Time with me; and it is certain that those Portions of Life, which we spend agreeably to ourselves, are all that can be computed in a Philosopher's Kalendar. I am pleased with the Epitaph, which <HI>Similis,</HI> a General under <HI>Adrian,</HI> directed to be inscribed on his Tomb-stone. He had spent a long Life in Perils and Fatigues, 'till about seven Years before his Death; when he retired to his Villa, passing his Time as became a Man of Religion, Sense, and Philosophy. The <HI>Latin</HI> is,
<Q>Hic jacet <HI>Similis,</HI> cujus Aetas multorum Annorum suit: Ipse septem duntaxat Annos vixit.</Q>
I will attempt the Translation for you:
<Q><L>My Life, O Time! to many Years amount,</L>
<L>But seven only make my own Account.</L></Q>
For my Part, I have made three Divisions of my Time; and, according to the Distinctions
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
I make, there are but two Portions of them to be attributed to my Life. When I am in Company, I <HI>pass</HI> my Time; when I am alone, I <HI>spend</HI> it; and, while I am with you, I <HI>enjoy</HI> it.</P>
<P>Since the Election at —, I have had the Happiness to be entirely alone; which the Hurry, I was then in, has given me a thorough Relish for. I do not think it amiss to consider the World as a Prison; where we are subject to such Company, as Chance, Necessity, Vice, or Misfortune, have associated us with: And Soli∣tude may be deemed the true Siege of Freedom; as there alone we can be Masters of Ourselves, our Time, and Occupations. The only Thing, in which I think <HI>Augustus</HI> attempted to be great, was his Wish to live, to retire; but he was never great enough to execute that noble Sen∣timent. It is somewhere said, that
<Q>Privacy and Freedom is the Wish of the Great, but the Privilege of the Mean.</Q>
The Life, I lead at present, is certainly the End proposed of all the Labours and Perils of the Great, in all States of Life; then what a true, philosophic Pleasure must a Man be sensible of, who has reached this Goal, without being out of Breath for it! while he looks back, with Compassion, upon Millions, who are sweating and toiling, casting away Pomps, Fasces, and Fortune, to make themselves light for the Race, and shoul∣dering through opposing Crouds, to come up
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
to him! What the Philosopher <HI>Cyneas</HI> said to <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> might be here applied, but that I hate Quotations; however, I shall give you one: <HI>Diogenes</HI> said, that
<Q><HI>Aristotle</HI> must go to Din∣ner, when <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Bell rung; but <HI>he</HI> was at Liberty to wait for the Summons of his Appetite.</Q>
In the World, we are obliged to act by Rule; but, in Retirement, we can act according to Reason.</P>

<P>I AM much obliged to my dear <HI>Harry</HI> for the Indulgence he is so kind to grant me: I have a much better Right to plead that Privilege, at present, than I can ever have from writing to Lady —, or any other Person; which is my being utterly incapable of writing, from real Illness. I have been all Day on the Bed; and, though I ventured to <HI>Bond-Street,</HI> in hopes of rouzing my Spirits, I find myself so very weak and languid, that I am hardly able to hold the Pen.

prevents my sleeping an Hour at a Time, the whole Night.</P>

<P>I SENT to the Post Yesterday, but had no Letter from you; which I should have been extremely uneasy at, but that <HI>Kitty</HI> sent me on▪ from you to her, which does not say you are worse, though you still complain. I came over here, just after I wrote last to you, and break∣fasted with <HI>Kitty</HI> in my Way. This was but the second Time I have seen her, since you left her; which she seems picqued at, and complains
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
that I am grown peevish; for she is one of those, who cannot distinguish between Gravity and Ill-humour, or knows any Difference between Reproof and Scolding.</P>
<P>I enjoy as much Solitude here, as I did lately at <HI>Belvidere</HI>; and live after my own Manner, which is, not to dine 'till Night. I am more the Hermit here too, which makes some Variety; for I dress my own Meals, broil my Chops, and roast my Potatoes, by my Chamber Fire; for I chuse them clean; and they are but flatternly People, who rent this House from me, though they are <HI>English,</HI> and Protestants. I do assure you, my Life, that I grudge myself every Morsel I eat in this or any Retirement, unenjoyed by thee; and would very chearfully fast three Days, for the Pleasure of your dining with me the fourth.</P>
<P>As I have a Way of philosophizing upon even the most trifling Occasions, I have begun to look upon Epicurism in a very different Light, from what I have always considered it. It is certain, that the Epicure has a greater and more frequent Enjoyment of Life, than a Man of vulgar Appetite. I grant, that the reducing our Wants to as few Things as possible, has more of the Philosopher in it; but, perhaps, to multiply our Pleasures may be the more sensible Scheme, within the Bounds of Reason and Innocence. They, who argue against this Voluptuousness,
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
may, from the same Rule, prohibit a refined Taste for Letters, Painting, or Music. But, though they should indulge us a little in (what they call) rational Pleasures, they will find, that all their vain Philosophy against the Enjoyments of Sense, is but a certain Stoical Pride, which would pretend to set human Nature above any Satisfaction, which they may have in common with Brutes. I wonder, they have not yet at∣tempted to stop our Breath and Motion, because Brutes have both.</P>

<P>AS I know it will give my sweet Love Pleasure, I find a very sincere one in being able to acquaint him, that I am vastly better, than when I wrote last. My Cough is somewhat abated, and I have slept tolerably well these two Nights.</P>
<P>I fancy, I live as retired, in the midst of a great City, as you in your Hermitage. I cook for myself, and drink (rather than eat) by my∣self; for I live entirely on Broth, Chocolate, and Tea. I find, Slops agree with me much
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
better than Meat; for I am surely sick, if I touch it.</P>
<P>My Wishes for you are not confined to Meal-Times, nor do I suppose your's are: No Moment passes, but I sigh for you: What do I suffer in being separated from thee! When, when shall we meet, to part no more?</P>
<P>I am so far an Epicurean, as to believe, that Providence designed a full and perfect Use of all it's Bounties to his Creature, Man.
<Q><L>For Heav'n is paid, when Man receives;</L>
<L>T' enjoy, is to obey.</L></Q>
Else wherefore, with an unwithdrawing Hand, did he create them? It is the Abuse of these, which constitutes the Crime; and which, in general, bears it's Punishment in the very Com∣mission of it.
<Q><L>To the late Revel, and protracted Feast,</L>
<L>Wild Dreams succeeded, and disorder'd Rest.</L></Q>
They, who indulge the Gratification of any Appetite to Excess, are far below the Brutes; and to debar ourselves of any Enjoyment, within the Bounds of Innocence and Reason, is
<Q>to live like Nature's Bastards, not her Sons.</Q>
Every Person's particular Circumstances ought to fix the Bounds of their Self-Indulgence; for there are many Gratifications, which would be criminal in me, that may be both reasonable and innocent for a Person, who has a large Fortune.
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
Were I Mistress of ten thousand Pounds a Year, I would not wish to multiply my Desires, (which are now confined within a very narrow Com∣pass) because, by not having many of my own, I might gratify others; which is to me the highest Enjoyment, human Nature is capable of. There, indeed, we rise superior to the Brute Creation, who, I believe, have much the Ad∣vantage in all sensual Pleasures; for theirs are unmolested with Intemperance or Remorse. Yet I do not think this is a Cause for us to spurn the rational Enjoyment of those Pleasures, we have in common with the Animal World: Let us rather follow their Example in those Par∣ticulars, where we appear most on a Level with them, by following, not oppressing Nature; which is, in them, another Name for (what we call) Reason.</P>
<P>I have been insensibly led into a Subject, which, I am conscious, I am by no Means capable of treating justly: But you, I am sure, will excuse my Errors on this and every Occa∣sion; as they proceed only from the Weakness of my Head, not Badness of my Heart; which is filled and guarded by your loved Idea.</P>

<P>YOU reproach me gallantly enough with only wishing for your Company at Board: But indeed, my Love, I have one constant, equal Earnestness toward you, which is never broke through; except that I wish for your Company with a more particular Fondness upon some Occasions, when I happen to be in such a Situation, or romantic Circumstance, as I know would suit your Taste, or give you an additional Relish to my Company. Have you not some∣times, during a constant Tenor of Health, per∣ceived, at particular Periods, a certain Lightness of Heart, and Wantonness of Fancy, which you could not account for? somewhat like the Gleam of Chearfulness in the Mind, which is raised by the sudden Rays of Sunshine, breaking through a Cloud. Something analogous to this I am frequently sensible of toward you. My Love is never less than Health; but my Fond∣ness often rises to an Excess of Ardor, equal to those extraordinary Spirits I am alluding to: And, as these Flights of the Soul seem to be it's Essays towards a more perfect State, I may be said to love you, in general, like a Man; but, upon such extraordinary Occasions, to adore you with the Fervor of an Angel.</P>

<P>I AM particularly concerned at your Cough; for it is the worst Symptom of a Cold, and what your slight Constitution, inclined to an Hectic and Decay, is very little able to bear. My Love to the <HI>India</HI> Folk, because you say they have been very kind and affectionate to you.</P>
<P>I am displeased at your saying, you are weary of Life: It is, at least, unkind, if not something
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
worse: It is the Sign of a Lowness of Spirits, and a Carelessness; which is much below your Sense, Virtue, or Religion. I cannot excuse any one for speaking without Thought, who is capable of thinking so well. It was said by one of the Antients,
<Q>that a patient Resignation to necessary Evils was next to the Merit of a voluntary Martyrdom.</Q>
This was a fine Saying in the Days of superstitious Enthusiasm, when Men officiously threw themselves in the Way of Persecution, in order to merit the eighth Beatitude; but, at present, the first Virtue, mentioned above, stands unrivalled. Let Men repine at what Misfortune they will, it will be found, upon Examination, that their Loss of Patience is the greatest Evil they labour under. The absurd Notion of natural Right to the good Things of this Life, occasions our Uneasiness at their Loss; but consider Matters philosophically or religiously, and all the Concern vanishes. We cannot challenge a Property in any Thing, from Providence, in this Life; for we were not in a Condition to make Terms for ourselves, before we came into it; but we should consider ourselves here, in an happy State of establishing an indefeasible Right to the highest Enjoyments of the next. Neither Health or Fortune we can call our own, where every Thing fluctuates incessantly; and, if our Furniture be Glass, why should we be surprized at it's being broken?
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
And it is as vain and ridiculous to grieve at any Loss of worldly Advantage, as it would be to be mortified, because
<Q><L>The very Air, you breathe this Day,</L>
<L>The next may help an Ass to bray.</L></Q>
Which is the only Distich, I remember, of a Poem, I wrote, some Years ago, upon this very Subject.</P>
<P>Now observe, ma Seule, et chere Mignonne, that I am not scolding, but only philosophizing; which being premised, I shall go on with an Observation, I have made, long since, upon one of the Beatitudes; I forget which, in Order; but the Text is,
<Q>Blessed are the Poor in Spirit,</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here is, methinks, an Instance, among many, of the Difference between the Christian and Heathen Philosophy; which some Authors, vain of the natural Reason of Man, have affirmed to be the same. The latter teaches us Contempt for Riches, and Fortitude in Misfortunes: But the former inspires us with a Resignation to Poverty, and Patience under Sufferings. One but increases the savage Fierce∣ness of Man's Nature into a Pride and Stoicism above it: The other softens us into a Spirit of Humility and Meekness, not below, but con∣sonant to, the imperfect State of Man in this Life. While Men, either before, or during their Ignorance of, Revelation, considered themselves
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
only with Regard to this Life, perhaps the Heroism of Stoic Philosophy might sufficiently answer the Purposes of human Nature, in this confined View: But of what Use are Virtues, Sentiments, or Affections, cultivated here, which can never be exerted in that State, where there will be no Pomps fit to contemn, or Misfortunes to oblige us to suffer? while the Spirit of Meek∣ness and Humility will sufficiently answer our Ends here, and is the proper Temper to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Love, and Contem∣plation, which are the Occupations of <HI>the Blest above.</HI></P>
<P>As your Cold has probably taken away what little Appetite you had, I shall send you up, by <HI>Thursday</HI>'s Stage, a Crock of the finest pickled Walnuts, you ever saw or tasted. I wish I could send you some of my Mutton, as little, and as sweet, (but somewhat fatter) as yourself. My Hams, however, will soon come, and I shall carry up some of them for you.—Sweet, good Night!—</P>

<P>I thank you for your intended Present: I doubt not their being excellent; but, alas! unshared by thee, what Delicacy can please? Haste then, my Love, to give me a Relish for every Enjoy∣ment; for I neither know, wish, nor hope for any, but in thee.</P>

<P>I AM at a Loss to know, whether my Love or Pride is most gratified at your kind Ac∣ceptance of those little occasional Essays, which I sometimes send you, for your Amusement, or Guidance in Life; but I shall refer the Satis∣faction to my Love, as that comprehends my best and highest Pride too. It is but just in me to make you some Return of that Philosophy, which you have taught me: But in this Science you are infinitely my Superior; for I can but create in you a Disregard for the Things stiled
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
of this World, merely by shewing their Trivial∣ness and Vanity in themselves; but you have inspired me with an utter Contempt of them, by putting them in Comparison with your own Worth. However, my Philosophy is neither of the Cynic or Misanthrope Kind: I have neither an Aversion to Men or Things; for I can very well indulge myself with both; but then I con∣sider them like a Dream or a Feast, which serve as Amusements for the Time, and leave either no Longing, or a Satiety, behind. Indeed, I take the true Use of Philosophy to be, not to vex ourselves in Prosperity, but to comfort us in Adversity. In short, we need not be so rigidly on our Guard against the Pleasures of this Life; for they seldom happen, or continue long enough to soften or emasculate our Natures: But Dis∣appointments or Misfortunes are the Things, which are most familiar to us; and yet, by our Uneasiness, seem the Things, which we are least used to. Most of the Mortifications, we complain of, are what we owe to one another; a great many of which may be avoided, if we justly considered Men but as Tools. An In∣strument, which has not Sharpness enough for a Razor, may have Strength sufficient for a Paring-Shovel; and that, which has not Toughness for an Hammer, may have proper Weight for a Mallet. Now, to instance in Men: — would make a miserable Confidant; but, if you are to
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
make an Apology, he can tell an admirable Lye for you. — is not of Stuff to make a Friend, but nobody directs a Coachman to <HI>Ranelagh</HI> better. —, indeed, cannot write Letters; but sure he can carry them to the Post. — would be but an indifferent Comforter in Affliction; but then he can make you laugh, and forget it. So that a tolerable Judgment, upon the different Characters of Mankind, may help us to work some useful End, even out of the Worst and Meanest: And, as to the Evils and Goods of Life, a religious Sense of them will be found to be the only true philosophic one — to consider the first as a Reprobation of our Faults, and so amend; and the latter as a Reward of our Virtues, and so persevere.</P>
<P>I took a solitary Walk in my Fields this Evening, contemplating upon such Subjects as these; and think, I never observed a more beautiful Western Sky, at the Setting of the Sun. This shall be the Test with me, whether there be a true poetical Genius in this Island, at present; for such a one must certainly, like <HI>Prometheus,</HI> catch Fire at the Sun in so much Glory: For no Person can be eminent in this Art, who has not a strong Enthusiasm about the Beauties of Nature; nor without a certain inspired, though not an acquired Knowledge of the Philosophy of it too. What are all the Hints and Allusions to Arts and Sciences, some
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
of them unknown to the World, and others supposed to be so to himself, which the Com∣mentators mark out in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Works, but a Sort of Prae-sentiment, or, as it were, a Flight at Science, which duller Mortals were forced to earn thro' the Labour of Academies? I think, such Instances as these, with Dreams, and many other Proofs of stronger Force, may be brought as Arguments for the Independence of the human Soul upon Matter: For, tho' we should allow the Materialists, that the Knowledge, we attain from the Deductions of Reasoning or Reflection, may be but the natural Effect of the animal Spirits upon the Fibres of the Brain, which is the unintelligible Jargon they speak; yet surely the Discoveries, we sometimes make, without any Deduction at all, cannot be accounted for from the mere Organization of Matter, but must arise from a certain Impulse foreign to it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have had no Letter from you last Post, I shall employ that Portion of Time, which is more particularly dedicated to you three Times a Week, in communicating to you such Reflections as occur to me, at present; which I take just in the very Order they succeed one another in my own Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211"/>I am, forsooth, a great Philosopher:—I prac∣tise it in myself, and perform it to all the World. In the severest Trials, I think I should be able to exhibit myself to the Satisfaction of all Spec∣tators. In a Gaol, I could comfort myself with these Reflections:
<Q>Here I can enjoy a perfect Vacation from all Business or Care: All Soli∣citude after Honours, and all Anxiety about Fortune, are useless here, because incom∣patible with my present State. I can here give up my whole Time to Reading and Contemplation, without the Reproach of Idleness; and can here indulge my much-loved Solitude, without the Imputation of a misanthrope Singularity. Here my Occupa∣tion and my Leisure are all my own; for few intrude upon the Wretch's Levee. Wel∣come the Interruption of those that do; for he must be a Friend indeed, who seeks us in a Gaol. Happy then, thrice-happy State, which, at the same Time, proves our Virtue, and approves our Friends!</Q>
Even in the Day of Sickness, and the Night of Death, could I sustain the Pains, and survey the Terrors, with an unshaken Mind, from this Soliloquy:
<Q>Grant, just God, that the Vices, Errors, and Follies, of my past intemperate Youth, may be opposed, at the great Day of Account, against the humane Offices I have performed in Act, and the general Benevolence I have
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
always had in Will, even to the vast Circle of all created or possible Beings of the Universe; and, in this Hope, welcome thou glorious Death, so much dreaded, because so little understood!</Q>
<Q><L>Welcome, thou Cordial to a troubled Breast,</L>
<L>The softest Remedy, that Grief can find;</L>
<L>The gentle Spell, that lulls our Cares to Rest,</L>
<L>And calms the ruffling Passions of the Mind!</L></Q>
<Q>Thou happy Minute, the first of Immortality, how have Men traduced thee, by comparing thee to a long Sleep! but Sleep is a tedious Death, while Death is but an instant Sleep.</Q></P>
<P>Yet, with all this Appearance of Philosophy, I am prone to Anger, Passion, and Resentment; and, though I am sufficiently aware of this Foible, and set the whole Force of my Reason against it, I am not Master enough of myself to preserve my Temper sometimes, upon the slightest Provocation, even of the Folly of a Child. Now what is the Reason of such a re∣markable Inconsistency in my Character, has been the Subject of this Hour's Contemplation; and I have attributed it to this; that Nature must universally prevail, and will always be found too strong for Art. In the first Instances, I mentioned to you, I owe my Philosophy to an happy Turn of Constitution and Genius; to a certain Carelessness about, and sovereign Con∣tempt
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
for, the Things of this Life, when they are out of my Power, though nobody enjoys them more, when they are within my Reach; and an elevated Hope, and strong Conviction of the Enjoyments of the other World; by the frequent Contemplation of which I have happily improved Nature into an Habit of Philosophy: But, in the latter Case, I am almost afraid Art will never be able to conquer Nature; though, at some Times, it may govern, or disguise it; because, perhaps, trifling Occasions do not sufficiently call upon my Philosophy to exert itself; and no Army is so soon overcome, as that which too much despises it's Enemy.</P>

<P>YOUR Letters fill me, at once, with the extremest pleasure, and the tenderest Con∣cern. My Heart melts in me, while I read thy Thoughts: A Kind of gentle Tremor throbs my Breast, which is not to be described, nor understood by any, who have not felt the Ex∣tremes of Joy, and Grief, which I have known for thee. The little Understanding I am Mistress of is charmed with truly philosophic Sentiments: But the fond Woman is hurried into Grief and Madness, at the bare Mention
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
of those Subjects, which are, indeed, the real, but severe Trials of our Religion and Philo∣sophy. I have many Times been so weak (you, perhaps, may call it cruel) as to lament the Pos∣sibility of your dying. I am certain, I shall never be able to think of your Death, either in a christian or philosophic Light. Let me intreat you never to mention it more: Indeed I cannot bear the Thought.—
<Q>Forlorn of thee, whither should I betake me? where subsist?</Q>
Oh! if you love me, <HI>Harry,</HI> the single Consideration of my Distress, in being torn from thee, should make you even anxious to delay your future Happiness. You would not call the Moment of our Separation an happy one, were thy Soul linked to mine, as mine to thee.</P>
<Q><L>Oh! the soft Commerce! oh! the tender Ties,</L>
<L>Close twisted with the Fibres of the Heart;</L>
<L>Which broken, break them—and drain off the Soul</L>
<L>Of human Joy, and make it Pain to live!—</L>
<L>And is it, then, to live, when we two part?</L>
<L>'Tis the Survivor dies.—My Heart, no more!</L></Q>
<P>I doubt not but you will think my Tender∣ness, upon this Occasion, intirely selfish: Indeed I grant it is so;—for I would leave thee, <HI>Harry</HI>; with Transport leave thee! well knowing that my Death would be conducive to thy Happiness. Your Religion and Philosophy would prevent
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
the Effects of your natural Tenderness.—My little, happy Spirit (for such, I doubt not, it would be) should minister unseen to thy gentle Sorrow, and bring thee Peace and Comfort from above. My Mind is somewhat chear'd by this last Hope.</P>
<P>I shall conclude my Letter here, as it would be the Art of sinking, to mention even our Meeting in this World; which, indeed, I begin to despair of; but, in a strong Hope of our future Happiness, I subscribe myself,</P>

<P>I AM vastly uneasy at not hearing from you last Post.

Every Drop of Rain, that falls, shrinks me, as if it touched my Heart, when I think that thou, it's dearest Part, art, perhaps, exposed to it.

I have frequently amused myself with thinking of the extreme Pleasure I should have in sur∣prising you with my Presence, at the very Moment you were, perhaps, lamenting my Absence, or wishing for me to share in the rational Delight, you sometimes receive, from a fine Passage in a favourite Author. This Whim has entertained me much; and, by the Force of Fancy, I have spent many delightful Hours in your Musaeum, when you little thought I was so near you. I have, in the same Manner, accompanied you many a Mile in your Evening Walks, and held long Con∣versations with you, though you, perhaps, never utttered a Syllable, during the Time of such imaginary Discourse.

<P>I AM returned home safe to my Elysium, and did not see so sweet a Place since I left it. A Cow dead, two Sheep, six Turkeys, two Ducks, and a Goose, stolen, was all my Loss, while I was away. I forgot; a Ferret died. These Things have greatly ruffled the Calmness of my Uncle's Humour, especially the first; for it was one of my Weaver's Cows, which I had sold to him, about a Month before; and thought it between half honest and half humane to make good his Loss. My Uncle disputed very logi∣cally with me, upon this Head; that it was not an Act which Honesty required, because I had fulfilled my Part already, in delivering the Cow; and was not to be a Guarantee against Accidents. He said, that Humanity was no
<PB N="219" REF="220"/>
more concerned with him, than any other Ob∣ject of Charity, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> All which I acknow∣ledge to be true; and yet I had some strong Idea roving in my Mind, that I was but acting justly; not from any particular Law of Mo∣rality or Religion, but from something higher, that adapts itself to many nice Circumstances, which express Laws cannot reach. This is, I suppose, what the Philosophers and Divines stile Conscience; something, as <HI>Prior</HI> expresses it,
<Q><L>Beyond the fix'd and settled Rules</L>
<L>Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
There is, certainly, such a Thing as original Truth, coeval with Eternity; Part of the Essence of God, and not a Law of his ordaining. This is that charming Idea, which the Mind of Man contemplates in itself with so much philosophic Rapture. This primitive Reason is the great Criterion, which guides noble or uninslaved Minds, when they see fit to depart from, ex∣ceed, or act directly opposite to the express Laws of God, or Man; which being but im∣perfect Deductions from that original Source, necessarily established for the Regulation of Men's Lives, who have not Sense or Leisure to contemplate the native Beauty of Truth, or Virtue enough to embrace it, may be deviated, according as Reason or Conscience instructs the unprejudiced Mind, the great Law would have
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
been directed in such a particular Case or In∣stance. I am extremely provoked at the un∣philosophic Assertion of <HI>Descartes,</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE set up here at the old Inn; though you all say it is a bad one: This may be a Reason for new Guests not to come, but not for old ones to quit it. I always suppose, in such Cases, that Poverty is the Reason of bad Accommodations; and make it a Sort of Cha∣rity, to support the Indigent; and, when I eat or lye badly, it helps Digestion, and softens my Repose, to consider that others eat or sleep the better for it. I made a vile Breakfast at —, this Morning, from this Turn of Mind; though I had forsworn the old House, upon my going up to Town last. Such Reflections as these, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> are extremely pleasant; and their being uncommon is, perhaps, one of the Reasons, I amuse myself with them.</P>
<P>I halted here, in order to write to —, instead of paying him a Visit; for I do Business better by Proxy, than in Person. The Reason that I write better than I speak, is not, as <HI>Dryden</HI> observes upon <HI>Persius,</HI> that I have a Difficulty in finding a Meaning; but rather, as the same Critic remarks upon <HI>Juvenal,</HI>
<Q>car il est bon de se fair valoir,</Q>
that it is hard to chuse one. I have too much Fancy, and am
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
too nice about my Expression, to explain myself off-hand distinctly and intelligibly. Besides, the Persons and Objects, which strike on my Eyes, throw me into a Confusion, which hinders my Judgment from having fair Play to exert itself, My Ideas resemble a Painter's Pallet, where you have great Variety of Colours lying together, without Harmony or Order; 'till a skilful Pen∣cil has blended them into proper Lights and Shades, to compose an agreeable Picture. This Difference between my Writing and Speaking must be very obvious to you, with whom I have corresponded, almost constantly, for above five Years past: And, upon a Review of my Letters lately, I do not recollect to have repeated the same Sentiment twice; yet I remember to have said the same Words, in Conversation, to you, an hundred times.</P>
<P>Every Mile I rode, since I left Town, my Impatience to see <HI>Belvidere</HI> has increased. — Perhaps, the Affection, I have for it, being suspended, while I was with you, (the greater Passion absorbing the less) was then set at liberty to operate, when we parted; or, perhaps, the Thoughts of quitting, as is natural in soft Minds, have the more attender'd me toward it. If I thought there was a Naiad or Dryad in the Place, who would lament my Absence, I should sacrifice my Interest to my Superstition; but my Religion teaching me, that, where-ever we go,
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
our Guardian-Angel accompanies us, I think I but obey it's Call, whenever I change my Situation to my wholesome Advantage.</P>
<P>I would have you, by all means, write to Lady —. You may also present my <HI>Duty</HI> to her, as she is to you a <HI>Mother.</HI></P>
<P>Adieu, my Life! my double Life now!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCLXVII.</HEAD>
<P>I BELIEVE, I need not take much Pains to assure my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> that nothing, but a very severe Illness, could have prevented my writing last Post. However, I hope his own Thoughts furnished him with some other Cause for my Silence; and that he had not the least Apprehension of the terrible Situation, his poor <HI>Fanny</HI> was in. I was seized with a Contraction in my Stomach on <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning, attended with an unusual Pain; but, as I had Intervals of Ease, I hoped it would go off. I dressed myself, in order to go to —; but, finding myself grow worse every Hour, I was, at last, obliged to send an Apology. The Pain threw me into perfect Convulsions; and, in spite of all the Medicines which were given me, I continued on the Rack 'till <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, when a violent Emetic gave me Ease. I am now free from Pain, but so extremely weak, that I cannot walk from my
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
Bed to the Dining-Room, without Help. Even in those Moments, which I thought my last, I rejoiced you were not with me; as your Sufferings would have added to mine, and made them more than I could bear. Besides, I should not have had any Thing to struggle for, had you been present; but the earnest Desire, I have again to see thee, gave me Strength to encounter those Agonies, that would have torn me from thee, my more than Life! I would not let <HI>Tom</HI> write to acquaint you with my Illness, lest your Apprehension should suggest something even worse than the Reality.</P>
<P>I now congratulate you on my Recovery, and shall proceed to thank my sweet <HI>Harry</HI> for both his Letters.</P>
<P>There is, doubtless, something inexpressibly charming in reflecting on those Exercises of Humanity, which my dear practic Philosopher is so constantly employed in: But, with regard to the two recent Instances you mention, I cannot help thinking, that it is rather doing a general Injury, than a particular Charity, to support Persons in any Profession, which their Want of Capacity, Industry, or a proper Fund, renders them unfit for: These Persons, so dis∣qualified, prevent others, who may be capable, from engaging in that Business, which they do not execute; while themselves might become useful Members of Society, in another Situation.
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
You may, perhaps, think this Way of arguing too severe: But, were we not to regard the general Good more than that of Individuals, the Tenderness of our Dispositions might impel us to Acts of the highest Injustice, and lead us, perhaps, to the Rescue of a Murderer; if we did not reflect on the salutary Effects, which Examples produce, in the general Community. But, while I talk with such seeming Strictness, my Heart and Pen disagree; and an inward Consciousness of the many Failings, I am in∣cident to, strongly reminds me of the mutual Claim, which every Part of the Creation has to each other's Indulgence; and, perhaps, none has more Need of it, than my poor, faulty, helpless Self.</P>
<P>I can very easily account for your being able to write in a more clear and distinct Manner, than you speak: For, besides the Confusion of Ideas, which you have found so just and pretty a Resemblance for, you have, probably, more Modesty than any Man, who has lived so long, and been so conversant with the World, as you have; and I am sure there are Men, who are not possessed of the thousandth Part of your Understanding or Knowledge, who could make a better Figure in a general Conversation.</P>
<Q><L>Distrustful Sense with modest Caution speaks,</L>
<L>While flutt'ring Nonsense in full Vollies breaks.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232"/>You express much Reluctance at parting with the Child of your Fancy; and I will allow your Attachment too to be a reasonable one: But, like good Reason, let it give way to better; and remember, "Your Home is every-where." I am, perhaps, partial to this new Scheme, as I first mentioned it; for this, if for no other Reason; you cannot condemn me for desiring it's Success, as my utmost Wish has ever been to become, in some Shape or other, the Means of Good to thee. Let me then, my sweet Love, flatter myself, that, in this Affair, I was the Agent to thy Guardian-Angel, and pointed out the Road to thy future Advantage. But I will not inforce the Subject farther; as I am sure you will do every Thing, which Sense and Prudence direct.</P>

<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
I apprehended, was well and safe, from your writing; but I expected a <HI>Lapsus Linguae</HI> at every Line. The Remedy I knew to be pleasant, but the Delay of the Cure intolerably tedious. I am not so fond of this Life, as to desire to renew my Age; but I should wish most ardently to revive it in my Posterity.</P>
<P>I must insist upon it, that, 'till I see you again, which shall be the sooner for your Compliance with this Request, you are in Bed, every Night, by Eleven o'Clock, — as much sooner, as you please; and up at Eight, — as much earlier, as you will; and that, in every other Particular, you will live, as we should do together, alone at <HI>Belvidere,</HI> or whatever Place we may here∣after spend and enjoy our Lives together in.</P>

<P>AND so, Sir, your chief Concern was for Bab! Indeed, Bab's Mam is affronted; tho' I may venture to assure you, she was more anxious for it, than herself. I have as little Fondness for Life, as most People; nor is there
<Q>a single Hour o'erpass'd, that I could wish should take it's Turn again:</Q>
Yet I acknow∣ledge the same Desire, which you express; and, I am persuaded, feel it infinitely stronger, than you can do, at present. There is the same Kind of Difference in our Attachment to the dear little one, as in our Affection for each other. You were the first and only Object of my Love: For you I felt all the romantic Tenderness of a first Passion; while you, who had loved much and many, were utterly in∣sensible to all the soft Inquietudes, the indearing Anguish, the heart-rending Fears, which Pro∣vidence, in Mercy to Mankind, decreed should never be re-felt.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235"/>I am to be sent to Bed at Eleven o'Clock, and made to get up at Eight, for Bab's Sake; and these are the Conditions, you annex to your Coming. Indeed, my sweet Love, I will comply with them, or any other Command of your's, not grudgingly, nor of Necessity, but with the utmost Chearfulness; as it shall always be my highest Pride to love, honour, and obey thee, my Guide, Guardian, Kinsman, Father, Friend.</P>
<P>I should, indeed, be vastly ashamed of myself, did I argue against your Sentiments, from my own: But, as you first enter on those Subjects, you leave me only the wrong Side of the Ar∣gument; which I sometimes take up, for the Pleasure of being fully confirmed in the right by you. With Regard to the late Matter in Question, you may be thoroughly assured, that both our Ways of thinking and acting will ever be the same; for I hope, and believe, I have as much Humanity in my Disposition, as any Person I ever knew, except yourself. Did I not love you extremely, I should envy your Supe∣riority there, and there alone.</P>
<P>Rejoice with me! I have had two whole Days sacred to Peace and Contemplation — But they are over, and Noise and Folly re-assume their Throne.</P>
<P>I have sent you the Answer to the <HI>Essay on Spirit:</HI> I know not whom it was wrote by — nor do I know what I am now writing, for the

<P>I rejoice in this fine Weather, because you enjoy it; though I cannot help lamenting my own Confinement, doubly uneasy from the Dis∣agreeableness of my Companion. But I will bear it patiently, in hopes of happier Days; Days spent with thee. When, oh! when will that Time come?</P>

<P>AND so, Madam, you are jealous of Bab, are you? I have known such Instances with regard to dead Rivals, but none before of Objects not yet in Being. However, I shall allow you some Foundation for your Jealousy here; for, if any Thing ever rivals you, it must be some new Perfection of your's; for nothing can excel you, but what is derived from you. <HI>Prior</HI> makes but a lame Compliment to his Mistress, "I'll love thee o'er again in Age;" for this hints rather a Revival, than a Con∣tinuance, of his Passion: But I say, I will love thee o'er in Youth; which shews a Constancy

In his Situation it would have been prudent rather to conform to Rule, than submit to Reason; and I am afraid, that it would have done less Hurt to his Orthodoxy, in the Conclave, to have made an Essay upon the <HI>Flesh,</HI> than the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>

<P>The Prologue, you sent me, is, in general, very well, has a good Turn and Spirit of Poetry in it; but there is one vile Line, as it has but a simple Meaning in itself, and no Sort of Context with the rest:
<Q>To greet his Shade this grateful Night we give.</Q>
"A Foe to Folly, but the Friend of Man," is an old Line: I think, it is in <HI>Rochester</HI>'s Poem upon <HI>Dorset</HI>'s Satires, where also is this Line,

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your Letter; and, since you are well once more, observe, that I will never give you <HI>Credit</HI> for being sick again; and I hope you will never have Discredit for being irregular, to which, believe me, all your Complaints are owing. At the same Time, I disclaim any Com∣passion from, you too, when I am ill again of my old Disorder; for, from the Discontinuance of it, since I left Town, I am convinced, that early Hours, and supperless Slumbers, are the absolute Cure for it. As truly as that Vice produces Vice, Excesses, being of the same Nature, beget each other. We ought certainly to sit up after Supper; then we shall, as surely, lie a-bed in the Morning; and, consequently, a late Breakfast falls too suddenly upon Dinner; then a slight Repast keeps back the natural. Appetite 'till Night, when the Irregularity must, of course, begin again. And yet the Cure is easy; for, but any one Excess in this Rotation being omitted, the whole will fall again into it's due Order; as, by stopping any single Point of a Circle, you arrest the whole.</P>
<P>Just as I had gone so far, a poor Boy begged at my Door, in the Stile of a poor Scholar, and
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
modestly asked for nothing but Paper. It seems, he is orphan'd both of Father and Mother, and lives from Cottage to Cottage in the Parish where he was born. The Boy had a good honest Look, and I took him into <HI>Thompson</HI>'s Shop, and bound him Apprentice. I am pleased with the Thought of what charming Surprize it will be To-morrow to the whole Parish, when they inquire after their Foundling, to hear, that Providence met him begging in the Way, had Charity for him, and bound him to a Trade.</P>
<P>I am very glad to hear, that <HI>our</HI> Lady is coming to Town; but would not have you decline writing to her, on that Pretence. You can say many prettier and genteeler Things in a Letter, than you could in Person; and Writing, such as your's, to such Taste and Understanding as her's, has confirmed more lasting Friendships, than ever Conversation did.</P>
<P>I have not hinted any Thing to this House about my Correspondence with —; nor shall I, 'till I see the Event of it. If it should not answer your Expectations, I will not speak of it at all. I would not, for fifty Guineas, I had not proceeded as far as I did; but my failing of Success will not give me one Shilling's Worth of Concern.

<P>I HAVE three of your Letters lying before me now, which I had not Time to answer or remark upon before; as you know the Hurry, and Complication of Business, I am engaged in.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246"/>As to —, whom you inquire about, I have not heard one Syllable, since his first, and only Letter to me. Tho' he said then, he was to stay at — for a Fortnight; which Time was not elapsed, before he had my last Letter; yet, perhaps, he did not stay as long as he designed, and might have gone home, before I had finished my Essay. This may account for the Delay of hearing from him: Or, perhaps, he has taken Time to consider, and consult some Friends about it. But, as I said in a former Letter on this Head, I was so prepared, as not to suffer any Disappointment, from the very first of my Application to him; so shall trouble myself no more about the Matter, unless I hear from him again; and then it shall be as a new Affair to me.</P>
<P>You have renewed a Subject, which we have had frequent Disputes about; that my Sense is better than your's, but your Love greater than mine. Now I shall still argue both these Points with you; and the latter, I hope, I shall make, at least, doubtful, during our Lives. If I have a stronger Sense, you have a prettier one; and, if I appear to have any Advantage over you, in the Humility of your Opinion only, it is more owing to the Fortitude of my Mind, than the Excellence of my Understanding. As to the second Point, it is out of Debate, as you seem to have given it up, by the first; for
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
a Man must love you in Proportion to his Understanding.</P>
<P>I did not mean to scold, but warn my Pet, when I hinted at Irregularities; which, I appre∣hended, was the Occasion of the heavy Cold, you complained of. What I meant was sitting up, and lying in Bed, late; both of which are very bad, in a <HI>double</HI> Sense, at present. But I am quite easy, since you have promised to conform to the Rules, I shall prescribe to you: As you likewise know my Sentiments already, I need not repeat them; for I have that Con∣fidence in you, that you will strictly govern yourself by them. Nor need I endeavour to give them Weight, by hinting to you, that not only your own Health and Spirits, but the Health, Strength, and Happiness of that, which may, one Day, be as dear to you as your own, entirely depend upon the prudent Regimen of yourself, at this Time. I am up every Morning at Five, tho' I do not go to Bed 'till Twelve; and, notwithstanding the Labour of Body, and Anxiety of Mind, I go through, all the Day, I feel such Chearfulness and Flow of Spirits about me, owing to this alone, that I cannot contain myself from singing and dancing about my Fields, like one stung by the Tarantula.</P>
<P>I am now gone through your three Letters, and am sorry they are at an End; for, like a

You sometimes unkindly take me to Pieces, and I am not Beauty enough to stand such a Scrutiny.

<HEAD>LETTER CCLXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>BELIEVE me, my ever-dear, my much-loved <HI>Harry,</HI> when I tell you that my talking of Death need not alarm your Jealousy; for I solemnly declare, I find nothing dreadful in the Thoughts of his Approach, but the too tender Concern, I feel at parting with you. If this be a Crime, I confess my Guilt: But let it be a Consolation to you, as well as me, that I am not conscious of any other unrepented Sin; but find my Soul filled with a stedfast Hope, that, thro' the Merits of my Redeemer, I shall be happy. Now let the Resignation, with which I bear the present Pains inflicted on me, and the Calmness, with which I expect those that are to come, bear witness to my Love for thee; since that alone enables me to support the present, and expect the future, without even wishing for that
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
certain Relief, which Death affords to human Misery. Nay, I will go farther yet, and say, I wish to live, from the dear Hope that my Life is, and may be of Moment to thy Happiness. But in this, and every Thing, let us endeavour at a perfect Resignation to the Dispensations of the Almighty; and say, with Truth and Chear∣fulness, his Will, not our's, be done!</P>
<P>Be assured, my charming tout en semble, you cannot be hurt, by what you call,
<Q>my taking you to Pieces.</Q>
You are perfect enough to stand a much nicer Scrutiny, than I am capable of making. But indeed you misapprehend me, when you suspect me of intending any such Matter. It is more than I can do, to defend myself; nor had I ever the least Design of finding Fault with you.</P>
<P>You sometimes accuse me of Weakness, which I am actually guilty of, but cannot help. I am mortified at your seeming to expect I should be perfect, when I set up for nothing more, than a mere, simple, mortal Woman: Of course, I endeavour to lay the Fault on Nature, rather than Will: And indeed I am convinced, that Constitution has a greater Share in our Virtues and Vices, than we are willing to allow; and that a strong Frame of Body is a great Help to the Mind. We have had frequent Instances of Persons, possessed of the greatest Fortitude, becoming miserably pusillanimous, when the
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>
animal Spirits were oppressed by Pain, Age, or Sickness. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> in the latter Part of his Life, used to cry, like a sick Girl, if he lost a Game at Picquet, and say, every one could beat him then:
<Q><L>Did this become</L>
<L>Whom Armies follow'd, and a People lov'd?</L></Q>
Yet sure it would have been the utmost Cruelty to have reproached him for this Weakness; or from thence to have thrown any Reflection on that noble spirit, he formerly possessed. In short, my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> it is my Opinion, that Pro∣vidence, to moderate the Pride of Man, has made the Faculties of the Mind depend more on the Formation of the Body, than we are aware of; at least, I am willing to think so, as it naturally accounts for my Want of Resolution and Strength of Mind, besides an hundred and fifty other Failings, I am incident to.</P>
<P>Adieu, my first, my best, my only Wish and Hope! May you ever retain that Philosophy, which I admire, not reproach you for; and may I never furnish you with Trials, which may prove it's Virtue, or exhaust it's Strength!</P>
<P>I am, and ever shall be, in Sickness or in Health, truly and affectionately your's.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK your noble Correspondent makes a very paltry Figure in his last Letter. I own, I had a better Opinion of his Sense and Spirit, than to suppose he could be alarmed at finding a Person, who possessed these Merits in an higher Degree, than himself; but I am now convinced, that the Superiority, you demonstrated, is the Reason of his declining any farther Connection with you. It is not easy to fall, with a good Grace, from a Principal to a Second, in any Point, which we have much at Heart; nor can we bear the Person, whose superior Excellence makes us appear in an inferior Light, even to ourselves. <HI>Swift</HI> is the only Author, or Person, I ever met with, who honestly confesses this Foible:
<Q><L>Why must I be outdone by <HI>Gay,</HI></L>
<L>In my own hum'rous, biting Way?</L>
<L><HI>Arbuthnot</HI> is no more my Friend,</L>
<L>Who dares to Irony pretend;</L>
<L>Which I was born to introduce,</L>
<L>Refin'd it first, and shew'd it's Use.</L></Q></P>
<P>When I plain'd my lonely Situation, did I seem to lament the Want of any Friend, or Companion, but thee? Indeed, I neither did,
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
nor do; for all other Company and Converse are tasteless to me. I with I had Religion or Philosophy sufficient to support your Absence with a proper Firmness, I will not say, Unconcern. But to those, who truly love, believe me, <HI>the best Authors</HI> appear but bad Comforters, under the Pains of Separation: To me they must be rather a Disservice, than Help; as they would but more strongly remind me of thee, thou charming, practic Essence of them all! How∣ever, if I live, I will fall into whatever Course of reading you think proper, as I shall always be pleased with adopting your Sentiments, or modelling mine by them, as far as my poor, little Capacity will admit. But let me beg you not to attempt curing me of the Pain, which your Absence will ever give me; for, as nothing but Indifference can render me easy in that Particular, be assured it is out of your Power to make me so.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding your Situation, which I know requires your Presence, I very seriously and sin∣cerely wish you here, at this and every Moment. There is no saying how far the Weakness of my Body affects my Mind: Perhaps my being disqualified for every other Pleasure and Satis∣faction, makes me feel your Loss more strongly. Be that as it will, I cannot help thinking it a little melancholy to be left in the forlorn, unsettled Way, I am, in my present Condition.
<PB N="253" REF="254"/>
How is the Time fixed for your Coming, when my falling ill is so uncertain? And sure you need not grudge me the Happiness of seeing you a little sooner than, perhaps, my latest Moment. However, if it is inconvenient, I relinquish your Promise; for I shall always prefer your Interest to my Satisfaction; nor can I receive any Joy from the Thoughts of your coming with Re∣luctance to me.</P>

<P>YOUR Observation upon — is extremely just, and expressed in a very pretty Turn and Manner; and, tho' I did not flatter myself in the Way you have taken it, yet that may rather be his Reason, than none at all; for, as to the Objection he makes, with regard to the Expence, I think my Letters sufficiently proved that the Expence of my Scheme would be considerably less than his own Plan.</P>
<P>Your Remark upon — puts me in mind of a Passage of Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI>'s Treatise upon the Wisdom of the Antients; where he labours to give a new Moral to the old Fables of Antiquity. <HI>Juno</HI> is said to be woo'd by <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
in the Form of a Cuckow; upon which he makes the following Comment:
<Q>That Men often impede their own Success by Ostentation of superior Merit; and that especially with Persons, who have more Arrogance and Pride, intimated by the Character of <HI>Juno,</HI> than Sense or Merit. The surest Way to win their Favour is, to appear as mean and humble, both in Virtue and outward Appearance, as possible.</Q></P>
<P>The whole Treatise, which I am now quoting from, is, in my Opinion, a very poor Performance, and much below so great a Man. The Morals drawn from the Tales of the Pan∣theon are wretchedly forced, and many of them improperly adapted. His Stile is ordinary, and Expressions paltry.</P>
<P>My dearest Life, you cannot surely think, that I would not rather be with you, even in Town, than from you, even here: Why then do you seem to upbraid me? Oh! never, never do so again. Be assured this once for all, and then never let a Doubt or Surmise disturb your Breast, that I never stay a Day from you, but when it is necessary I should, both for your present Security and future Happiness. You can surely calculate pretty near the Time, you would most particularly desire my Attendance; and it will certainly be Time enough for me to go up then. If I should go at present, perhaps I should
<PB N="255" REF="256"/>
be, for many Reasons, under a Necessity of leaving you, at that Time, I should most wish to be with you. Thus your own Impatience would disappoint your End. I shewed the same Impatience in desiring you to come down; but I have been uneasy, ever since, about it, as I am apprehensive the Attempt would be extremely hazardous, and the Journey too fatiguing; and an unlucky Contretemps might happen in the Country, before you could be able to return again. I hope this Letter will reach you Time enough to prevent you; or, rather, I hope your Prudence has corrected my Indiscretion already. There are many Reasons, too, against your coming at present; which, however material in themselves, are Considerations too insignificant to mention, after the Objection, I have made, of your Danger.</P>
<P>I am, indeed I am, tout a vous Seul.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="281" TYPE="letter">

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS to the Conversation with —, I should be much obliged, if you would let me know who was the second Person; which, upon my Honour, I shall never mention either to him or the other; and this you may be assured of,
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
both upon your Account and mine. It may be of Use to me to know his Confident upon this Occasion, but only so, if I keep my Mind to myself.</P>
<P>Such Expressions, as he made Use of, though the same that you quoted, may very well bear a different Sense from what Mistake, Prejudice against him, or in favour of me, might possibly apprehend them in; or, even supposing them capable of no other Meaning, but the unkind one reported to you, yet the Ill-nature of the Tongue does not always proceed from the Ma∣lice of the Heart; and the unmeaning Purposes of a light Reverie, or the vague Folly of an idle Dream, may sometimes be mistaken for a deliberate and determined Scheme of Action. I have not, thank Providence, in my own Heart, Malice to any Man: I have therefore no Jealousy of any Man's evil Designs towards me. The few, I love, I love entirely, both with Friend∣ship and Esteem: Those, whom I merely love not, (for I hate no one) have my general Bene∣volence and Charity. This happy Cast of Mind has enabled me to live hitherto very easily and comfortably, both in the World, and my own Closet; and has turned the Edge of many Mortifications and Disappointments, I have met with, in my Communication with Mankind; which, though frequent, I may be supposed to be not well qualified to bear with; as, from the
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
general favourable Opinion I have of human Nature, in Honour to it's Creator, the Con∣viction of Yesterday prepares me not for the Disappointment of To-morrow. My Affections vary, but my Friendships never; for the first depend upon others, but the latter upon myself; or, rather, this rests upon an higher Principle than the slight Basis of human Connections. This Principle is not my own; it was graciously lent me by Providence, who would have un∣kindly given me Life without it. I will spend it here with pious Use, and pay it back with grateful Tribute! And the Lord incline our Hearts to keep this Law!</P>

<P>NEED I tell my dearest Life, with what unfeigned Pleasure I should accept his Invitation, were it in my Power to undertake such a Journey, without the immediate Hazard of my own Life, and one far dearer to me? Surely my dear <HI>Harry</HI> has forgot my being forbid to go even three Miles, at a Time, in an Hackney-Coach: The least Exercise fills me with such violent Pains, as almost distract me. I have not been able to turn myself in Bed, without the utmost Difficulty, these ten Days; and have been obliged to take Opiates, to make
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
me sleep, for several Nights past. The Want of my Rest has reduced me to the lowest Degree of Weakness imaginable: Besides, those, who know more of the Matter than I, think I shall not hold up above three Weeks, at farthest. But why do I go on assigning Reasons for declining what would afford me the highest Transport, when my not accepting it too fully proves my Want of Power, not Will? I can∣not help thinking I have suffered infinitely more, than the generality of People in my Condition: Be that as it will, I know my Strength and Spirits are quite exhausted; and I am more than half persuaded, that we shall never meet again on Earth — in Heaven, I am sure, we shall; for in thy Sight alone I can be blest! — Something too much of this —</P>
<P>There is an extreme pretty Poem come out, called <HI>Elfrida.</HI> If you will allow yourself an Hour's Leisure to read it, I will send it to you. I have received much melancholy Pleasure from it.</P>
<P>Your Picture is come home, and is almost my only Companion: I talk to it frequently; but, alas! it does not answer. I find myself disappointed, and turn from it to your Letters: They, indeed, afford me a more sensible Satis∣faction; they tell me of your Health, your Love and Constancy. Thus do I divide my Time, as it were, between the Shade and Substance.
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
I begin to regret my not having had <HI>my Picture</HI> some Months ago; for, though I do not wish you should lament me, if I die, I do not wish you should entirely forget me; and <HI>that</HI> would just furnish a bare Remembrance, un∣attended with Pain or Pleasure.</P>

<P>AS I was sitting down to write about three Hours ago, I was taken so ill, I feared I should not be able to hold the Pen this Day. I have got a little Ease, and shall employ the happy Interval in acknowledging your Letters. I have already declared my Incapacity of accept∣ing the Pleasure, you designed me. I am glad to find your mature Consideration approves my pleaded Reason. I shall say no more on the Subject, but that I am in a very disagreeable Way, oppressed with continual Pains, Weak∣ness, and low Spirits.</P>
<P>As to your coming to me, take my Word, I was never more in earnest, than when I desired you to consult your own Interest, rather than
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
my Inclination; nor did I mean to upbraid your Want of Tenderness, when I supposed you might not come. I do not, indeed I do not, doubt your Love:
<Q><L>My Mind nor pines with sickly Jealousy,</L>
<L>Nor triumphs in Security and Ease:</L>
<L>Who loves, must fear; and sure who loves like me,</L>
<L>Must greatly fear.</L></Q>
I have taken much Pains to render Life indifferent to me: I have accomplished it: I neither wish to live, or die. If I were thoroughly persuaded I should not recover, I would insist on your not coming near me; for I am convinced there is a vast Difference in the Sensations, which arise from being present or absent at the Death of any one we love: But, as I cannot be certain in this Point, I leave the Matter entirely to your Discretion; and be assured, I will not be offended, if you should determine on staying where you are. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>AS you have condescended to be my Pupil, I shall recommend the Course of Reading I should chuse for you; and, to lead the Way, have here sent you one of my former Letters
<PB N="261" REF="262"/>
to you, upon this Subject. I beg you will seriously consider, how strongly I have there recommended those Tracts referred to, with other Writings of this Kind; and that you will carefully and leisurely read them regularly thro', with that sober Sense and rational Reflection, which is necessary to give you the full Benefit of such a Study. For, as <HI>Young</HI> says,
<Q><L>Unless for some peculiar End design'd,</L>
<L>Learning's the specious Trifling of the Mind.</L></Q>
To settle the Course of Study is but half the Work; the Method of reading is what com∣pletes the Scheme. He, who reads most, studies least: For it is with the Mind, as with the Stomach; where not the Food it swallows, but the Digestion it performs, turns that to Nou∣rishment, which would otherwise be a Poison. Therefore I would recommend it to you never to take a Book in one Hand, without a Pen in the other: And I expect your sesinble Remarks and philosophical Reflections, of which indeed you are very capable, upon every one of the Papers, I have quoted for you, in the inclosed Letter; and, by the Time you have gone regularly thro' them, I hope to point out some∣thing farther for you, in our mutually desired Conversation together.</P>
<P>You talk in a splenetic Way, in your Letter, of dying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now I will not scold you again,
<PB N="262" REF="263"/>
for the hundredth Time; because I am very sure, if you could avoid it, you would, when you know how often it has disobliged and dis∣pleased me. I am indeed sincerely concerned at your ill State of Health, at present; and as much so, that you will not exert that Strength of Mind, which you may find yourself Mistress of, if you will but take a little Pains to try. Indeed, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> you are capable of being a cleverer Creature, than you sometimes appear to be; and I own it vexes me, when I see you, at any Time, fall below your own Sense and Virtue, which I am always rouzing you to, as there needs nothing more to make you perfect.</P>

<P><PB N="264" REF="265"/>It was, indeed, very lucky for me, that I got to my Aunt's: She has behaved with great Care and Tenderness, the Want of which must have added greatly to my Sufferings, if not imme∣diately endangered mine, and the poor Bab's Life. As to the Noise, I must compound for it, and endeavour to bear with one Inconvenience, where there are so many Conveniencies.</P>
<P>I cannot help telling you, that I think our Friends in — have behaved very ill to you. I had no Claim to their Friendship or Regard; but I think they should have rejoiced in any Opportunity of shewing their Gratitude and Affection to so near a Relation, and kind a Benefactor. The Particulars of their Conduct I refer to our Meeting, which I hope and believe will be soon. Observe, that I have never seemed to take the least Notice of their Behaviour, nor shewn any kind of Picque or Resentment at it. By this you may perceive, your Example has not been thrown away. I strive to copy it, though convinced I shall never, in any Thing, arrive at the same Degree of Perfection; and, I assure you, I scarce engage in the most trifling Action, without asking myself, would my <HI>Harry,</HI> if present, approve my doing so? or, how would he act in the same Circumstances? So really anxious am I to become thy Epitome.</P>
<P>I hope I shall keep up a little longer, to gather Strength and Spirits for the approaching

<P>INCLOSE you this Paper, because it relates to the Subject of one of my late Letters, about Reading. I send it to you more for your Amusement, than Instruction; as you need no Hint of this Kind: Nor, indeed, do I think
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
Reading itself any otherwise necessary to my charming Philosopher, than to direct or adapt your Thoughts to proper Studies; for an Ant, or a Straw, which gave you Occasion to exercise your own Reflections, would answer the End as well. Give but fair Play to the ingenuous Nature inhabiting thy Breast, my proudest Mansion, and all human Learning were superfluous to thee. Happy for Mankind, if Arts and Sciences were merely so! As all States thrive best upon their proper Forces, so these, like Auxiliaries, tho' called in as Friends, often remain as Tyrants.</P>
<P>I am well. Amen to you!</P>
<P><HI>Fielding,</HI> in the second Page of this Paper, has rendered the <HI>decens</HI> of <HI>Horace</HI> too literally. In the Original, it comprehends all the higher Morals; but, in the Translation, it means no more than what the <HI>French</HI> stile Les petites Morales.</P>

<P>THOUGH you caution me about speaking my Opinion freely about <HI>Elfrida,</HI> I must not be confined or restrained by any Thing, but my own Judgment, as far as that will go.</P>
<P>The Author's prefatory Letters shew him to be a better Critic, than his Work shews him
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
to be a Poet. There are some pretty Turns, which any one, who <HI>imitates,</HI> may write: But the Soul of Poetry is wanting; which I am certain of, from my not <HI>feeling,</HI> through the whole; and a Work must be very slight and insipid, which amuses only the Fancy, without affecting the Heart. I will not allow any Thing to make us <HI>wiser,</HI> which does not make us better; and the cold inanimate Contemplation of moral Beauty is not sufficient for this. He, who said, Virtue need but be seen, to be adored, expressed himself but faintly; I say, she must be felt.</P>
<P>But to return — <HI>Orgar</HI> is a vile, unnatural Brute, who would prostitute his Daughter to the Honour of being a King's Mistress. <HI>Athelwold</HI> is but a poor Character thro' the whole; and, as to <HI>Elfrida,</HI> I will not compliment her so much, to say there is any Parity between your Sentiments and her's. She seems, in her first Speech, to be picqued, in Pride, that she is not more publickly manifested to the World; talks high of <HI>Orgar</HI>'s Daughter, Courts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I think her rather like <HI>Semele,</HI> than you; and that im∣patient Temper of her's, jealous of his Love in Absence, and, not without Murmur, submitting to the Prudence of concealing their Marriage, perhaps drew upon her that Judgment of Providence, which destroyed her Husband, and rendered her miserable. I think the Stile very
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>
indifferent, and, in some Places, mean and absurd. One or two of the Heroes, I think, says '<HI>Sdeath,</HI> which is not a Word in the <HI>English</HI> Dictionary.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Pet! May you never have <HI>Elfrida</HI>'s Fate! though I would rather you had that than <HI>Semele</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I met Yesterday with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s Letters upon the Method and Use of reading History, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have gone through but the two first Letters. I like them extremely, but dare not say they are sensible and clever; because I have several times spoke and wrote to you upon this Subject, and have often inculcated that we mis∣apply our Study-Leisure extremely, who read for mere Amusement, or even Theory Contem∣plation. Such Persons may be said to study, as the College Lad expressed himself, by an happy Blunder,
<Q>I read six Hours a Day, and no one is the wiser.</Q></P>
<P>I think such a Man may as well be asleep; for he can only be said to have pleasant Dreams, who reads any Thing, but with a View of im∣proving his Morals, or regulating his Conduct. I mean Men, who are happy enough to be under no Necessity of reading, but for themselves; for Arts and Sciences must be studied by some People for the useful Purposes of Life. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<P>You say, that the present Uneasiness of your Mind calls for Amusement. I should think, that Amusements were fitter for a Mind at Ease. Irksome Thoughts are not to be relieved by Trifles; and it requires high Studies, and deep Reflections, to divert us from present Ills, or melancholy Prospects. But let Amusement be the Word! Will not <HI>Shakespeare</HI>'s Plays amuse you better than <HI>Durfey</HI>'s, and would you not find better Entertainment in the <HI>Spectator</HI> than the <HI>Rambler?</HI> No Boarding-School Girl reads more for Amusement, than I do. I would have you do so too: For I know very well, that Sense, Philosophy, and Virtue will make any Reading an higher Entertainment to you; and
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
that you are capable of receiving Pleasure or Amusement from many Writings, which are capable of instructing half the World. This was what I meant to hint to you, by any of my Letters on this Subject; that the <HI>utile</HI> was not inconsistent with the <HI>dulce</HI>; as I was too anxious for even your Amusements, to leave them to Chance or Carelessness for the Hap. I recommended some Papers to you lately, which, I flattered myself, would have highly amused you; as I am sure the Comments, I expected from you, upon them, would have greatly entertained me. But I will not presume to set you Tasks — Your own good Sense be your Guide!</P>
<P>I am sincerely concerned to find you still in that plaintive Mood of
<Q>Misfortunes, Anxiety of Mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
I hope, and believe, that you are not in any Circumstance of Life, which can provoke such melancholy Reflections. In short, I have observed, that there is a great deal of Sense and Virtue, with some Smattering of Philosophy, in the World; but that great, noble, and comprehensive Quality, called For∣titude, seems to have quite forsaken Mankind; and <HI>Scarron</HI> might well say, if, in Truth, he could even say so much,
<Q><L>None, but myself, could e'er that Pitch attain,</L>
<L>To sport with Misery, and jest in Pain.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274"/>May Heaven, most earnestly solicited by my Prayers, defend my dearest, amiable Love from both! and from every Evil, natural and moral, except the Penalties, which she deserves herself! and then surely her Happiness here will be an Earnest of that Bliss, which perfect Spirits enjoy hereafter. Amen to that sweet Prayer!</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> has a fine Passage, which may be quoted here, as a noble Definition of that Constancy, and Fortitude of Mind, which I am lamenting;
<Q>prepared for every Event, armed in all Fortunes, foreseeing without Fear, enjoying without Satiety, and suffering without Impatience.</Q>
This great Character is in the Power of so small a Portion of Sense and Virtue to attain to, that, for my Part, I am resolved to commence Hero from the Date of this Letter. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXCIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD the provoking Pleasure of receiving two Letters from my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> by Yesterday's Post. Tho' they were of different Dates, the Post-Mark was the same on both; so that these teizing Delays must be owing to the Person, you send with your Letters.</P>
<P>We do indeed too often misapprehend each other. I make no Doubt but the Fault lies chiefly on my Side; for I am conscious I have too much Quickness in my Disposition; which,
<PB N="275" REF="276"/>
joined to the earnest Desire I have to render my∣self agreeable to you, puts me on endeavouring to justify or explain away my Faults, perhaps, with too much Warmth. It is long since I have agreed with my dear Preceptor, in owning that Trifles will not, even for the present Moment, amuse a rational Mind. There is a Kind of Self-contempt inseparable from the mis-spending our Time, in Pursuit of any Thing, which does not tend to make us wiser or better, and, of course, happier. But this Feeling is, I believe, only known to intelligent Minds; tho' I have heard People complain of throwing away their Time on a Book, that did not please them, who were utterly incapable of making any Reflection, or forming any Sentiment from <HI>Milton, Shake∣speare,</HI> or <HI>Addison.</HI></P>
<P>It is, indeed, as my sweet Love observes, not in the Power of Trifles to relieve or calm the Sorrows of the Mind, or divert the Thoughts from bodily Pain. It is only in the Power of Religion, Philosophy, and Sense, to aid us in surmounting present Ills, by teaching us to look forward to an happy Futurity.</P>
<P>As I had entered into a regular Course of reading the <HI>Spectators,</HI> I have not yet gone thro' the particular Set of Papers, you recommended. I think it is impossible you should doubt my being really charmed with those, I have met: But, alas! what Comment could you expect
<PB N="276" REF="277"/>
from me, on Subjects, where the little Under∣standing, I am Mistress of, may be compared to an Infant just weaned from Leading-Strings, afraid to make a Step without a Guide?</P>
<P>I never did set up for the least Degree of Fortitude: My Sensations are much too lively for a Stoic: A decent Resignation to the Will of the Supreme Being is the utmost I aspire to. Nor do I look upon it, that my complaining to you can be deemed a Breach of Duty, in this Point: You are so much myself, and every Faculty of my Soul is so much devoted to you, that I can scarce call them mine. You have my Thoughts all wild and uncorrected: Tho' you may not approve them, you should pardon, while you endeavour to reform them, as you do those faulty ones, that rise involuntarily in your own Heart.
<Q>For where's the Palace, where∣into foul Things intrude not?</Q></P>
<P>My Heart's dear <HI>Harry</HI> must give me Leave to assure him, I am sincerely grateful for that elegant and affecting Solicitude, he expresses for my Happiness; of which he is, and I hope ever will be, the first and only Agent, in the Hand of Heaven. May it reward and bless him for the Kindness, and return those Wishes, which he makes for me, to him an hundred-fold!</P>
<P>You do me but strict Justice, when you believe that nothing, but <HI>extreme Illness,</HI> or some very extraordinary Accident, could prevent
<PB N="277" REF="278"/>
my writing. Your not hearing from me, by <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Post, was owing to the <HI>first.</HI> I was the whole Day in racking Pain, and could not rest three Minutes in any Place; therefore, as I had no Letter from you to answer, I thought it cruel to make you uneasy with my Pains.</P>
<P>Tho' I am transported at the Thoughts of seeing my dearest <HI>Harry,</HI> I would, by no means, desire you to come, unless you can do it with Convenience to yourself; for I would have you leave all your Cares behind, when your dear Presence is to banish mine. But in this, and every Thing, I submit myself to your Discretion and your Love.</P>

<P>I WRITE this from my new Farm, which I might stile the Paraclete; for there are "white Walls and silver Springs" enough to intitle it to that Appellation; though there are better Reasons for it. So romantic a Place never
<PB N="278" REF="279"/>
was, if Wildness, Solitariness, with the Print of <HI>Astraea</HI>'s last Footsteps in the Situation, and Love and Constancy in the Proprietor, be the distinguishing Marks of that Character.</P>
<P>There is something amuses and pleases me extremely in this Chain of Thought; that Pro∣vidence seems to have marked out this Spot of Earth for your's, by a Train of unforeseen Accidents. I had taken the Land at a Time, when you and I were upon such Terms, that it it was highly probable we should never be again reconciled. You had good Reasons to be highly picqued at my Behaviour; and your Prudence, your Pride, and Honour, was a just Bar to a Re-union. At that Time, perhaps, all Libertine as I was, with many Schemes in Imagination, and many Views in Prospect, I might have had some Consolation in the Loss of a Woman, whom my Passion loved, and my Reason esteemed, in the Thought of being, in some Sort, eased from that Restraint, which my Regard to your Worth, with my natural Sentiments of Generosity and Honour, never yet (thank God!) extinguished in me, must have laid me under—at such a Time, I say, we met by Chance: When speaking of this extra∣ordinary, bold, and enterprizing Purchase of mine, engaging for six hundred Acres of Land at a desperate Rent, at a hazardous Crisis, and in a dangerous Country, which required a large
<PB N="279" REF="280"/>
Fund to improve, when I was above two thou∣sand Pounds in Debt, and had neither Money, Credit, nor Stock to apply; upon describing the Situation of the Place, you desired I would name it —; adding, that it was probably the only Compliment, you might ever desire from me. Some time after this, you and I projected a Plan of Paraclete; which I have, this Day, by an accidental Turn of Thought, adapted to this Place. You may remember, last Winter, that, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and, when I was to look out for a Nurse, and Accommodation for your sweet ante-loved Babe, I was, from some prior Reasons, directed to this particular Place, for both.</P>
<P>Let me indulge myself farther in the Con∣templation of this Scheme of Providence, with regard to you and me. You chose and approved of me, when you had before you, as <HI>Milton</HI> says,
<Q>The World to chuse, and Providence your Guide.</Q>
Sense, Wit, and Reading were, from my earliest Years, the Objects of my implicit Adoration; and, whenever I changed my Passion, it was in Search of a fit Subject for my Admiration. I, at length, possessed, unknowing, these rare Qualities in you, and was in Danger,
<Q>like the base <HI>Indian,</HI> to throw a Pearl away, richer
<PB N="280" REF="281"/>
than all my Tribe:</Q>
But, as my Reason improved by your charming Converse more than my own Reflection, I found, acknowledged, and incased the Gem, thou
<Q>one entire and perfect Chrysolite!</Q>
and hope never to exchange thee, but for a better World than this, made more eminently so, by a nobler and higher Con∣verse there with thee, thou amiable Cherubim and Seraphim in one! in whom are so perfectly joined their two distinguishing Characteristics, Love and Knowledge! the pleasing Hope of which Enjoyment above will be a stronger In∣citement to my Virtue here below. In short, I do not know two Persons alive, who seem more adapted by Nature for each other. Excuse this Vanity in me, when your Approbation has already made my Panegyric. My Calmness and Philosophy is fit to temper the Misfortunes and Disappointments of Life; and your Wit and Spirit proper to season and enliven the Ease or Pleasures of it;
<Q>Dull, tasteless all, if unenjoy'd by thee!</Q></P>

<P>I DRANK hard at —, and it is now too late to reach home: However, I might get as far as —, with Ease; but have stopped short here, that I might be at Liberty to think of, and write to you, more agreeable to me than any Company or Converse, I can meet with in this World, while my Back is turned to you.</P>
<P>I received a very pretty Letter from you last Post, a very generous and a kind one too. The fatal Necessity of my too long Absence from you is sufficiently irksome in itself; and the sensible Light in which you apprehend it, and the ra∣tional Manner you speak of it in, saves me that additional Weight of Anxiety, which would be intolerable. You can always command Sense and Reason enough, when you are Mistress of yourself; and, in Obedience to them, let me be proud to own myself your Vassal too.</P>
<P>The Comments, I expect from you, upon those Writings, and others of the same Class, which I have recommended to you, are best shewn in your Life, by Chearfulness and Con∣tent; the first manifested in Philosophy, and the latter in Resignation. Whenever I sit down to
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>
read any Writings of this Kind, I first suppose myself, in order to try their Power, labour∣ing under all the Ills of Sickness, Sorrow, Poverty, and Oppression: When, in a short Time, all these gloomy Cares are dispelled, like Mists before the enlivening Sun-beams; and I look back first, with Triumph, and Contempt upon those fleeting Shadows, which are now posting so far behind me; and then look forward, with Gratitude and Joy, to that glorious Prospect wide-opening before me. In short, there is but one Misfortune in Life, which I think could prove too hard for such Reflections as these to support me through; I mean the Loss of thee, of thee, my only Gain: And I am very certain, that nothing could prevent me from following you precipitately, but the Fear, by that rash Action, of losing you for ever.</P>
<P>Among the Papers, which I design to collect in my <HI>Solamen miseris,</HI> I would insert the Hymn to Contentment, and Night-piece on Death, of <HI>Parnell</HI>'s. I happened to read them both this Morning, at <HI>Kitty</HI>'s; and, if it would not appear too much Vanity, I would add some of my Letters to you, where I speak of the Providence and Mercy of God, and the Immortality of the Soul; which, as they are my own Reflections, might have a better Effect on myself, at least, than better Writings on the same Subjects. A Collection of Essays, intitled <HI>Spectacle de la
<PB N="283" REF="284"/>
Nature,</HI> occurs to me here, as they give you a general and comprehensive View of natural Philosophy; which is such a Manifestation of a God infinitely wise, powerful, and good, as — away all impious Thoughts! — almost renders particular Revelation superfluous; at least, to contemplative Minds. There are also many Passages in these Writings, especially two Let∣ters from the Prior to the Chevalier, which are masterly in their Kind, that are admirable to abate the Self-sufficiency of Man's Pride, and to humble all human Presumption to a religious and implicit Obedience and Submission to the infinitely great Dispensations of Providence; before whose Throne let us both kneel, with a pious and virtuous Devotion, not with an enthusiastic or fanatic Zeal; and from whose Grace may we both receive such Reward, as shall merit our just and honest Inclinations and Actions toward each other!

<P>YOU cannot imagine with what Anxiety I wait for every Post, at present, to hear a favourable Account of your safe Delivery. I own my Concern is double, at this Time, but double for you alone; and, had I the Universe to leave an Inheritance, I would rather make Hospitals my Heirs, than have you forfeit your Life, or Health, to give me one.

<P>The Delays in the Posts, which you complain of, are owing to this: That, for some Time past, they have gone later out than usual; so that I had Time to write my Letters in the Morning, and send soon enough: But now, I find, they have recovered their former Dili∣gence, which I was not aware of 'till Yesterday Morning. I will take Care, that you shall meet with no more Disappointments.</P>

<P>YOU know I was lately angry: And I am so ashamed of it, that I have been re∣collecting what my Reading, or own Reflections can suggest, first, to palliate the Offence for what is past; and to prevent, for the future, the ill Effects of a Vice and Weakness, which I think even I have Sense and Virtue enough to guard myself from.</P>
<P>The best Hints, which I shall offer here, are taken from an Essay upon this very Subject of Anger, wrote by Lord <HI>Verulam.</HI></P>
<P>To extinguish this Passion entirely, is but a Bravery of the Stoics: For, like all ill Habits, we must cure ourselves by Degrees; as a skilful Rider manages an headstrong Horse, guides his Steps in the safest Course, and pulls and relaxes the Rein by Turns. The Reason that so few People reclaim themselves from bad Affections, is owing more to Want of Judgment, than Virtue. We grow careless, upon finding the
<PB N="292" REF="293"/>
Imperfections of human Nature not easily con∣quered by the Perfection of Philosophy; not being aware that Habit must be overcome by Habit; as Regimen cures chronical Distempers better than Medicines. Intermissions are as ne∣cessary in Ethics, as in Physic. The Scriptures, which are better Guides in Morals, than the whole Body of Philosophers, give some In∣dulgence to human Frailty in this Particular: "Be ye angry, but sin not." And in another Place,
<Q>Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath;</Q>
which seems to declare, that the Continuance of Anger, not the first Start of it, makes the Vice. <HI>Bacon</HI> says, the best Way to cure the natural Inclination or Habit of Resent∣ment, is to reflect upon the Effects of Anger, "how it troubles a Man's Life;" and the best Time to do this is to look back upon Anger, when the Fit is over. <HI>Seneca</HI> says well, that
<Q>Anger is like a Ruin, which breaks itself upon that it falls.</Q>
<HI>Socrates</HI> being asked what a Man was doing, who was seen in the Street chafing himself in a Rage, answered justly,
<Q>he is punishing an angry Man.</Q>
The Scripture exhorts us to possess our Souls in Patience; then whoever is out of Patience, is out of Possession of his Soul. A passionate Man may be com∣pared to a Bee, according to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Expression, that, when they sting, they lose their Spirit in the Wound. Perhaps this may leave an Open
<PB N="293" REF="294"/>
to Sarcasm, to compare a calm Man to a Drone. <HI>Bacon</HI> says, it ought to make Men ashamed of Anger, the Consideration of those Persons, who are most subject to it; Children, Women, old People, and sick Folks. Men should carry their Resentment rather with Scorn, than Passion; especially where our Pride is picqued; for that same Pride should rather shew us above, than below an Injury or Affront. Many other Ar∣guments, drawn from Prudence, Morality, and Religion, occur to me at present; but, I am sure, there are none of them necessary to inform your Sense and Understanding; and all I mean by this Essay, is to furnish you with a few Hints to be offered to my own Consideration, whenever you find me relapsing into that Weak∣ness, which you may remember in a former Letter, some Time ago, I mentioned as the only Thing, which, now and then, gets the better of the Tenor of my Philosophy.</P>
<P>Adieu, my fairest Guide! I assure you, that I fly to your Arms with all the Impatience of an angry Man, and with all that Good-nature and Affection, which passionate Persons are re∣markable for.</P>

Somewhat like the Emotion we feel upon meet∣ing an old School-fellow; whether it be one we have a particular Attachment to, or no; for I am not speaking here of a rational Affection, but such a Prejudice and Partiality, as is con∣tracted from early Habit and Custom, before we have the free Exercise of our Understandings. The Love of our Country may be ranked under this Head; by which, I do not mean that Patriotism, which is but universal Benevolence, poorly bounded by a Province or Kingdom; but that superstitious Attachment, Men have even to the very Soil, they were born in. I fancy that departed Spirits, even in Bliss, look some∣times back upon this World with a Regard like this, though without any Desire of exchanging Situations. I speak this upon a Presumption that we carry our Consciousness with us to the
<PB N="295" REF="296"/>
next World, which I look upon to be a Thing so far from requiring Proof, that to assert the contrary is arguing God to be partial or unjust. Should you be rendered a blessed Spirit for your Virtues, or I an unhappy one for my Vices, you might indeed be said to be happy, and I miserable; but neither of us could be said to be rewarded or punished, without a Consciousness of our being the Persons, who, in the other Life, had merited or incurred these Judgments. It is Consciousness, which makes the Identity of a Person relative to himself; and, if Death destroys this, it in Effect creates another Spirit in our stead; and to reward or punish such a one for our Actions here, would be Partiality or Injustice. I should be ashamed to insist upon an Argument, which, by appearing so obvious to me, makes me conclude has been often urged before; but, as I really never met with any Thing on this Head, at least, deducted from this Reasoning, and that it is a Subject you know I am fond of, I should carry it a good deal farther, if I were writing to any one else; but your Apprehension saves me that Trouble, as it has often done before. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCCIII.</HEAD>
<P>I DID not receive my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s first Letter 'till <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening. I was then at the Rock, and had no possible Means of sending an Answer to the Post-office; therefore was obliged, for the first Time, to disobey your Commands.</P>
<P>In answer to your Inquiry after mine and my Pet's Health, I must tell you, you have been very near losing both, since you left us. I attribute my Illness to the irregular Way we lived in, the four last Days you were in Town. I was seized on <HI>Monday</HI> Night with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever: I raved incessantly, and did not recover my Senses 'till <HI>Tuesday. Polly</HI> sent an Express to Town, but no one came near us 'till <HI>Wednesday.</HI> I went thro' all the necessary Operations, and am now, thank God, very well. I came to Town Yesterday, and shall return no more. Poor little Bab has had two Convulsion Fits; the last was very near carrying him off. They did not let me know of his Illness, 'till I came to Town. He is vastly altered; but I hope, and believe, he will recover. You may judge (by your own) the Anxiety I feel for him.</P>
<P>I am vastly delighted with your Sentiments in regard to our future Consciousness, as they are, in my Mind, highly conformable to Reason and Religion: But I am still more charmed with
<PB N="297" REF="298"/>
them, as they corroborate my darling Hope, that we shall see, know, and converse with each other in a future State. For certainly, if we retain a Consciousness of the Affections and Actions of this Life, we shall likewise retain the Idea of those Persons, who were the Cause of those Actions, for which we are to be pu∣nished or rewarded. The only Thing, I ever heard objected to this Opinion, is, that such Remembrances might lessen the Happiness of those blessed Spirits, who may, in this Life, be connected by natural or acquired Ties to Persons, who are to make up the Number of the Unhappy, in the next. To this I answer, from my own Belief and Hope, that no Soul will be doomed to everlasting Damnation: Or, if there should be such unhappy Beings, the Heinousness of those Crimes, which deserve everlasting Misery, would entirely erase the Affection or Regard we bore them, unknowing of their Guilt; and make us readily acknow∣ledge, when purged from gross and selfish Passions, that their Doom is just. I cannot think, that, even in this Life, there ever did, or will subsist, a real Friendship, or sincere Affection between the Good and Bad. Virtue alone is the sure Basis, that can make those Unions firm and lasting. Without that only true Foundation, like <HI>Estcourt's</HI> Guests,
<Q><PB N="298" REF="299"/>
<L>They part in Time —</L>
<L>Whoever hears this my instructive Song —</L>
<L>For, tho' such Friendships may be dear,</L>
<L>They ne'er continue long.</L></Q>
I have not wrote these Lines right, but 'tis no great Matter: I have only altered the Form, the Sense remains.</P>
<P>I received two Letters from you Yesterday. The Compliment, you pay to my Understand∣ing, is more justly due to you, than me. If I am sensible, or intelligent, it is you have made me so. The fond Desire of gaining your Approbation first rouzed me to exert the little Powers, which Nature lent me. Your Con∣verse, your Letters have improved my Mind, and given my Thoughts a Turn superior to the Trifles, which employ the Generality of my Sex. Yet still I plead no Merit from this Boast, for such a Preceptor must have improved the dullest Pupil. It is you, my charming Guide, who have made me, as far as I am either, wise or good. You have illustrated your Theory by Practice, and, by your dear Example, shewn me what it is to be a Christian and Philosopher. Go on then, my loved Master; continue to instruct, and (I hope) improve me, 'till I arrive as near thy own Perfection, as my small Powers admit. Yet still remember I am a Woman, nay a weak one too; subject to all the Failings
<PB N="299" REF="300"/>
of my Sex, which require Time, as well as Reason, to conquer.</P>
<P>I am now to thank you for your Concurrence to my Request; which I do very sincerely; but cannot help saying, tho' without Resentment, that I had rather you had refused, than in∣hanced the Merit of granting it, by such unkind Suspicions. I thought I had fully explained my Reasons for desiring, at the Time I mentioned it; tho' perhaps I thought it needless, as I did not, 'till now, believe my dear <HI>Harry</HI> could think me capable of any mean or selfish Views. Far from desiring to enlarge the Number of those, whom you stile Confidants, I sincerely lament the Necessity, which obliged us to make any; and I solemnly assure you, I would much rather encounter any Consequence, which might arise from the World's thinking ill of me, than purchase their good Opinion, by running the smallest Hazard of injuring you. Nor do I now, nor ever did mean to make any Use of it, on my own Account. My sole Reason for desiring it, was in regard to a third Person, whose future Credit, and Happiness in Life, is, I believe, as dear to you, as me. However, if you distrust my Prudence, or my Confidence in you, I am very ready to resign this trifling Proof of your's in me; as I would not have you think it can either lessen or increase the sincere and unbounded Dependence, I ought to have on you.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="301"/>I long to know what Success you have with the —. I am glad you did not explain your∣self to —. There are some People, who become Enemies from the Time they refuse to be Friends.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dearest Life! I am, and ever shall be, faithfully and affectionately your's.</P>

<P>I HAD the Pleasure of your's from Hermitage, and am highly delighted with your Account of Lady —, and her Babes. I have long been certain, that, whenever you knew, you would love and esteem her; and this Belief was, I think, the highest Compliment, I ever paid her. Has she not Abundance of that Clever∣ness, which is not to be defined; which, to the common Actions of Life, is like Grace to Beauty? And, as the latter does not arise from any particular Complexion, Limb, or Feature, but is the joint Result of all; so neither can the former be said to depend on Sense or Virtue,
<PB N="302" REF="303"/>
tho' I am morally certain it cannot exist without both: For, as we have seen many handsome People, who wanted the charming Je ne sçai quoi; so we must have met with many good and sensible Folks, who had not one Grain of Cleverness about them.</P>
<P>I am heartily concerned at the Account, you give of your Affairs. It is really a melancholy Thing, that you have no Person about you, whom you can depend upon; for those, whose Integrity is past Dispute, for Want of a little <HI>Cleverness,</HI> may injure you as highly, as others could by defrauding you. May I live to see the Day, when you shall have made me as capable, as I am willing and faithful, to become my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s only Steward!</P>
<P>Our dear little Baby is still very far from well. <HI>Blackstone</HI> say him Yesterday: He has ordered him to live entirely on Chicken-Broth and Sack-Whey. I am sorry to find his Constitution so extremely delicate. I grieve over again for every Grief, I felt and indulged, while he was immediately a Part of me; but I hope he will get the better of every Thing, and never have Reason to sigh as much as he does now from Constitution.</P>
<P>I am to sit, for the first Time, to <HI>Hudson,</HI> on <HI>Saturday:</HI> He has been engaged every Day since I came to Town. I repent of my Folly already, but do not know how to get off:
<PB N="303" REF="304"/>
Indeed I think it a very great one, to have <HI>my</HI> Picture drawn, especially as you cannot take it with you — But it is too late to help it now, and I must go on with the Farce.</P>
<P>As your Affairs are in such an irregular Way, I suppose you will not stay long at Hermitage. Let me know when you intend coming to Town. I wish I were to change my Lodgings every Time you leave me! for I can neither sleep or wake, without having your Idea continually before me; nor can I sit or walk in any Part of the House, without recollecting that you sat or walked there, at such or such a Time. As this local Memory is but a Kind of Interruption to the constant Remembrance I have always of you, independent of Time or Place, I am sometimes tempted to take up my Abode in the Kitchen, where (to the best of my Knowledge) you never were, that I may be free to think of you, without Regard to particular Circumstances, or material Objects.</P>
<P>I have, with great Care and Attention, read about half of <HI>Brown</HI>; but I must give him a second Reading, before I pretend to give my Opinion, or communicate my Remarks.</P>
<P>Your Brother and Sister are come to dine with me. I cannot say they interrupt me, as I have nothing farther to add, but that I am, and ever will be, your's.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE am I at the Bishop's House quite alone, and shall be so 'till <HI>Monday</HI> next; when the Family return from —. I met some of the Servants of this House about six Miles off, and they acquainted me with the State of Matters here; which would have been Hint enough for any reasonable Man to turn back upon; but, you know, it was rather a Matter for me to rejoice at, that I should have so much Time to myself, my Books, Paper, and Music. The Servants, who are left behind, are the higher Sort; and, as we are unfortunately old Acquaintance, they fall foul on me, from mistaken Kindness, at an unmerciful Rate. The Butler was immediately for sending to the Par∣son of the Parish,
<Q>to notify the Arrival of a Relation and Friend of the Bishop's, who was in such a <HI>lonesome</HI> Way, that it would pity one's Heart to see it.</Q>
But, upon In∣quiry, I found this Man would not go away, when I bid him, nor take a Denial, if he asked me to go home with him; and, not being at the Top of his Preferment in this Diocese, I begged to be excused from the Over-abounding of his Civility. My Friend, the Butler, then,
<PB N="305" REF="306"/>
apprehending that I thought the Parson too grave and wise for me, (for he could not get it into his Head, that a Man should chuse to be alone) recommended the Bishop's Agent to me; who, he said, would much delight me, as he was a brave, jolly Batchelor, like myself, and could crack a Bottle and a Joke with any Man. I asked him, whether this Man would give me any of my Lord's Money, without his Leave? and, being answered▪ No, I said I desired no Acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>Lady — and I had a good deal of Con∣versation about you, the Day before I came away. She spoke very handsomely of you, and kindly too. She said also, that you had but a slight Constitution, and was subject to low Spirits often; which she attributed to Irregularity of Hours, late at Night and Morning, and recommended to me to take some Care about that Matter for you. She assured me, that she was herself so sensible of the great Effect of rising early, that, as she has naturally such a Flow of Spirits, which were first owing to early Hours, she is now obliged to lie in Bed some Time longer than she is inclined, lest she should run wild about the Country, to the utter Scandal and Astonishment of all her Neighbours.</P>

<P>I Congratulate my dear <HI>Harry</HI> on the unexpected Indulgence, which his Taste for Retirement has met with. I am not at all surprized that you neither returned to Hermitage, nor accepted the Company that has been offered you at —; for I am well aware how pleasant it must be to a Mind like your's, to be allowed the free Exercise of it's own Faculties. I have often looked with great Pity, not entirely unmixed with Contempt, on very good Kind of People, for seeming to be utter Strangers to the Pleasures of Self-society; for I will not call it Solitude to be sometimes alone. However, I hope your contemplative Amusements are, by this Time, heightened into the Joys of a rational Converse, by the Bishop's Return. I am sure he is a sensible Man, from the Friendship that has so long subsisted between you, and the Manner you always speak of him in.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to dear Lady — for the Expressions, as well as Proofs of Regard, she has honoured me with. There is really something extraordinary in her Attachment, for indeed I cannot plead the least Merit to her Friendship; yet I hope, and believe, I shall ever retain it; for I am well convinced, I must be highly to blame, whenever I forfeit it.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="308"/>I am very certain, that you and she are quite right with regard to early Hours: But I would not disgrace the Goodness of her Heart, as well as Understanding, to suppose her chearful Spirits arise merely from Constitution. Believe me, that, in order to support them, she has had Recourse to Religion and Philosophy; nor has her high Station exempted her from wanting their Aid. May both you and she ever retain that sensible Chearfulness, which so well be∣comes ye! which, tho' you modestly ascribe to Regularity and early Hours, has it's Effect from another Cause, a Consciousness of acting right, and a Mind filled with
<Q>that sweet Peace, which Goodness bosoms ever.</Q></P>
<P>I will not however pretend to deny, that, in such Constitutions as mine, Irregularity may weaken the Faculties of the Mind, as well as the Body, and diffuse a Lassitude and Heaviness over both; Providence having ordained, for their mutual Preservation, that what injures the one, shall immediately or remotely affect the other. This Sentiment may be carried a great Way, even to the mental Vices of Envy, Avarice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and every Person, who has ever felt Sickness or Pain, must know,
<Q>we are not ourselves, when Nature, being oppressed, commands the Mind to suffer with the Body.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL alone still, in my own Kingdom; where, though I have no very extensive Sway, I have those Subjects to govern, that should be the first Essay of a Monarch's Politics, namely, my own Passions and Foibles. I might have answered your Letter last Post, but declined it; as I had not Time to do it Justice, to speak still in the kingly Stile.</P>
<P>I am extremely pleased, when you answer my Letters properly, by entering into the Spirit and Subject of them, which indeed you can do so well; not with
<Q>I received your's, and for Answer say.</Q></P>
<P>A Correspondence should be properly a Con∣versation; not mere Question and Answer. I often just hint at Subjects, and leave them imperfect, to give you Occasion to complete them; and I am vexed and disappointed, when you neglect it, out of Laziness or Diffidence; for it must be owing to either of these, when∣ever I am disappointed. You have sometimes told me, that I over-awe you, from an Appre∣hension of my superior Understanding; so that, in writing or speaking to me, you have not always the full Exercise of your own Powers.
<PB N="309" REF="310"/>
Now, for Argument's sake, we will let this pass; but then believe me, <HI>Fanny,</HI> if I remem∣ber right, I had not so refined and speculative Sense, as you have now, when I was at your Age. All the Improvement, I have ever made to it, has been almost since that Time; and a practised Wrestler may be able to overcome an inexperienced Man of greater natural Abilities. You are now in a State and Stage of Life proper to improve yourself, and may have this Advantage over me, that you can have the Help of one, who has lately travelled through the Road, you are to go; so that I hope, in Return, to have your Assistance, as your Un∣derstanding will be at the Height, when mine, from the Course of Nature, will be on the Decline. This I should look upon as a Sort of Triumph, of the most flattering Kind, namely, a Conquest over myself; that is, my better Part overcoming my worse. Besides, you have the Advantage of a chaste and religious Education, which will the sooner enable you to reach the only End I have ever proposed from my Studies, to make me rather a better, than a wiser Man. Moral Philosophy may reform our Manners, and subdue our Passions; but slowly the one, and with a constant Struggle the other; while Religion effects the first at once, and the latter with Ease, by substituting more charming Plea∣sures in their stead.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="311"/>This is the most romantic Place I ever saw: There are not two hundred Yards of level Ground in the whole Country; for it is com∣posed of an infinite Number of green Hills, lying so close to each other, that it resembles a Codlin Pye in a Bowl-dish. So that the Nurse's Story of Giants, of old, stepping from one Hill to another, round the Country, would not appear an improbable Tale here. It is much the same Way at Hermitage too, and, in general, thro' all those Parts of this Country, I have yet seen.</P>
<P>I hope you are reading <HI>Brown</HI> upon the <HI>Characteristics,</HI> and writing Notes upon it: I am sure you are, because I desired it. I should be glad to have your Opinion upon the Definition of Virtue, given in the last Lines of the third Section of the second Essay, upon the moral Obligations of Man to Virtue. I give you fair Play, by telling you that I think this Definition false and imperfect; and only ask you, how it is so. Read the first, second, and third Sections carefully, before you give your Opinion; not that you will discover the Error from them, but they will help you to judge the better.</P>
<P>This is a severe Trial of my dear Pupil; for, I own, when first I read the Book, I was fully satisfied with the Definition: And, to give you some Help in this Matter, I agree that he has shewn the Imperfection of the other
<PB N="311" REF="312"/>

<HEAD>LETTER CCCIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the disagreeable and embarrassed Situation I am at present, I know nothing could tempt me to write, but the Fear of your thinking I poorly declined the Task you have assigned me, without being ingenuous enough to confess myself unequal to it. I had gone through the whole Essay on the Obligations of Man to Virtue, before I received your Letter; and had remarked the Definition, you mention, to be as <HI>imperfect</HI> as any of those, he terms <HI>so:</HI> For which Reason, I had contented myself with thinking that Virtue is not to be defined; and had taken up so much of Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Opinion, as to believe, that though, like the Certainty of an Almighty Being, it cannot be reduced to Terms, or fully proved and explained by Words, yet is it self-evident to every rational Creature. <HI>Brown</HI> says, Virtue consists
<Q>in the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good, and the voluntary Production of the greatest Hap∣piness▪</Q>
If, by the Public, he means all
<PB N="312" REF="313"/>
human Kind, he might have explained it by <HI>universal Benevolence</HI>; which is so far from excluding the natural or moral Ties, that it certainly strengthens them.
<Q><L>Friends, Parents, Neighbours first it will embrace,</L>
<L>It's Country next, — and next all human Race.</L></Q>
But, if he confines his Idea of the Public to a particular Nation or People, he doubtless makes Virtue of a variable and indeterminate Nature; and, at once, destroys his own System, and it's Existence: For, tho' the Love of our Country is certainly a very noble and proper Principle; yet, as the Interests of every Nation and People vary, what may be virtuous with regard to the Advantages of one, may be highly criminal by becoming prejudicial to another. This therefore cannot be the true Criterion of Virtue: It's Effects must be uniform, independent of Time or Place, as it is itself the same in the Vale of <HI>Santone,</HI> or the Palace of <HI>Versailles.</HI></P>
<P>I am still more displeased at the latter Part of his Definition,
<Q>the voluntary Production of the greatest Happiness.</Q>
As this may be understood, poorly confining Virtue to the par∣ticular Stations of Affluence or Power. I cannot think this was the Author's Meaning; yet, as it may be wrested to this Point, I think it is dangerously expressed; for it may tend to dis∣courage
<PB N="313" REF="314"/>
the Exercise of Virtue in those, who have it not in their Power to do great or generous Actions.</P>
<P>I have now given my dear Preceptor the highest Proof of my Obedience to his Com∣mands; and, as we are told in Scripture, that "Obedience is better than Sacrifice," I hope he will accept the Will for the Deed. Believe me, my dearest Life, I have never been so much hurt at the Consciousness of my own Weakness, as at this Moment. I know I have exposed it; but I know I have an indulgent Master, who will forgive and instruct me. From the first of our Correspondence, I have ever declined writing, tho' I was vain enough of my Capacity in that Way before; but the Perfection of your Letters has shewn me my Insufficiency in such a glaring Light, that I never sit down to answer a Letter of your's, without blushing. You say, I am now
<Q>at an Age, and in a State of Life, to admit Improvement.</Q>
My Age is doubtless on your Side, but my Situation much against you. The Quickness of my Apprehension, which is, or should be my best Help to study, is turned to melancholy Prospects, and my Attention to any Thing I read continually interrupted, as I never am one Moment alone.</P>

<P>AS my dear <HI>Harry</HI> knows the Uneasiness, which his Silence gives me, I cannot help saying it is more than unkind, it is absolutely cruel, to neglect writing. There was a Report last Week, that you died suddenly. I heard it last <HI>Friday</HI>; and my not receiving a Letter from you that Day almost distracted me. Tho' your Letters are the most sensible and elegant Pleasure I can receive in your Absence, yet is my Affec∣tion so much stronger than my Understanding, that I would willingly give up the Entertainment they afford me, to be certain of a single Line by every Post, which should barely tell me you are well. I know it is a Weakness to expect such exact Punctuality; but it is the natural Effect of a <HI>greater,</HI> the having so entirely given up my Heart, as to render my Happiness wholly dependent on you; a Trust, for which (contrary to the general Opinion) you can, with Ease, give me sufficient Security.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="317"/>I received your two Letters of the former Posts; and think it is really something extra∣ordinary, that a Person, who was bred and has lived like you, should, at your Time of Life, (immersed in Business, and involved in disagree∣able Circumstances) without any outward Call, or visible Help, become so great a Proficient in a Science, which to the Generality of the World appears so tedious and abstruse, as to deter them from being at all acquainted with it; and in which many learned (and from thence called wise) Men have passed their Lives, with∣out either making themselves, or the World, one whit the better for it. In short, I look upon it as a particular Mark of the Almighty's Goodness, that has been pleased to give you a Turn of Mind, which must render you superior to the common Accidents of Life; and that he has thought proper to make you an Instance, among the few, that neither Riches, Power, nor Honours are necessary to constitute the real Happiness of a rational Being; since, with a Taste and Relish for them all, yet unpossessing any of them, your State is infinitely preferable to those, who, in the full Enjoyment of them all, are unblest with true Religion and Philosophy.</P>

I remember the Reason of my throwing it aside, when I bought it for you, was, upon looking a little into it, I observed the Author had alluded to a great Number of private Characters, to illustrate general Theorems; and, as I had sometimes met with many insipid moral Novels of that Kind, I conceived a Prejudice against the Book: But I find, from this Author, that, when such a Manner is managed with Wit and Address, it gives a certain Vivacity to this Kind of Writings, and strengthens the Stile, by adding Action to Reason.</P>
<P>What incited my Inclination to read this Book, was a Paragraph in the public Papers, that it had given great Offence in <HI>France,</HI> where it was written, and that there was likely to be
<PB N="318" REF="319"/>
a Prosecution against the Author; and, as far as I have gone, I find it has a Merit in it very apt to give Offence to Priests and Bigots. The Writer is, I think, a Man of Sense, Learning, Parts, and unprejudiced Reflections. I am, therefore, highly pleased to find he is of the same Opinion with me, of an innate Idea of irrelative Virtue; which is a Sentiment I am so charmed with, that I am fond of laying hold on every Occasion of discoursing about it. So I shall here take a Flight at it again.</P>
<P>We have, from the mere Beauty of Nature, a Smell for Flavours, a Taste for Savours, a Sight for Symmetry, an Hearing for Sounds, and a Feeling for more sensual Gratifications. Shall then the Goodness, nay the Justice of God leave us void of as immediate a Sensation of Virtue, which is a Thing of so much higher Consequence both to ourselves and others, and both with regard to this Life and the next? Shall, I say, the Bounty of God be greater than his Justice? Shall our instinct Faculties be governed by a divine Impulse, and shall our moral Powers be left without a Guide? for human Reason is insufficient to form the Rule, tho' it's proper Province is to be exercised, and conversant about it.</P>
<P>But the Senses are only the Organs to convey Ideas to the Mind; it is the Soul, which per∣ceives. Brutes then have a Soul: They have
<PB N="319" REF="320"/>
also a Spirit, if you give me Leave to make a Distinction here; for Matter, of itself, is inactive. There are so many Instances in Brutes of what we partially stile little, mimic Reason, that Mankind has no great Cause to be vain upon the sole Prerogative of this Excellence; since all we can claim is but a higher Degree of this boasted Superiority.</P>
<P>But we are taught to believe that God formed Man after his own Image: This Favour surely was not shewn in his human Figure, which <HI>Diogenes</HI> humourously ridiculed, by plucking a Goose, and leading it through the Streets of <HI>Athens,</HI> crying, "Behold <HI>Plato</HI>'s Man!" which that Philosopher had defined to be a two-legged Animal without Feathers. Nor can this glorious Characteristic be presumed from any one Quality, which Brutes have in any Degree or Analogy with us. What then is this great Distinction, upon which we do, and ought so justly to value ourselves, but a certain, innate, moral Sense, which, as the Serpent expresses it,
<Q>makes us as Gods, knowing Good from Evil?</Q></P>
<P>Brutes are capable of Virtue, according to the common Sense of it; for many of their Actions demonstrate Love, Gratitude, and Benevolence: And though, when the Spaniel beats the Field for our Sport or Food, he may be considered as acting merely for his own Pleasure; this is no more than some Moralists have charged upon
<PB N="320" REF="321"/>
human Virtue, which they have resolved into a Self-satisfaction. In short, it is an innate, moral Idea, which makes us <HI>sensible</HI> of Virtue; while Reason and free Will only make us capa∣ble of it.</P>
<P>As soon as I have read this Book, I will send it up to you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD not tell you any thing of the Matter, 'till it was over; but I left Town with a sore Throat, which increased very fast upon me, last Night; but I am this Morning, thank God, as well as ever, and am just setting out for your own <HI>Belvidere.</HI></P>
<P>I have gone a good Way in <HI>Manners</HI>; and, upon a farther View in that Author, I begin to find the same Fault with him, which I did at first. His Characters are too frequently intro∣duced, are tedious, and ill drawn, and many of them not at all to the Purpose. However, there are here and there certain Traits of Genius, which, upon the whole, make the Work appear to have been written by two different Persons; or rather, I have taken it into my Head, that
<PB N="321" REF="322"/>
it was wrote by a Woman, who had, for some Time, conversed freely with sensible Men.</P>
<P>The Author, Authors, or Compiler of this Book speaks very rationally against the Doctrine of eternal Misery; which is a Matter, I think, I have in some of my Letters given my Opinion upon; and is a Subject I am so fond of, that I shall venture to speak the Sentiments, which at present occur to me on that Head, without waiting to recollect whether I have said the same Things to you before or no, or whether any one has said them before me.</P>
<P>The Doctrine of eternal Misery establishes the Empire of the Devil; for twenty Men must be damned, for one that can be saved, upon the orthodox Christian Scheme; and the Mediator has suffered in vain.</P>
<P>Suppose, during the Millennium of the Just, there should be a Millennium of the Unjust — don't you think a thousand Years Sufferings may make sufficient Atonement to divine Justice? And I think the popish Doctrine of Purgatory only absurd in the Opinion, that any Merits of the Living can avail the Dead there. How∣ever, this wild Notion may be considered as a pious Fraud to be of Service in Religion, as it multiplies our Inducements to Devotion — As for Example; If I thought my dear <HI>Fanny</HI> was receiving many Stripes there for her Crossness to me, no Anchorite ever led such an exemplary
<PB N="322" REF="323"/>
Life, as I should, to rescue my own spoiled Pet.</P>
<P>Infinite Justice, they say, requires infinite Satisfaction. Perhaps this is only a Quibble upon Words: But, to take it their own Way, has not the Mediator's Suffering already given this infinite Satisfaction? and must every miser∣able Wretch, who dies in Sin, become an additional Victim to infinite Justice? In short, this shocking Doctrine seems rather to be a Piece of Priest's Rage, than divine Wrath; and is such a blasphemous Opinion of the Godhead, as exceeds almost any of those Lay Crimes, they anathematize so vehemently and presumptuously at the same Time; and are not aware that they reduce God to a Kind of Fate, while, by extending his Justice, they limit his Mercy, and so peremptorily destroy the Power of free Will in the Exercise of his Attributes. But I cannot let this <HI>infinite</HI> Satisfaction pass by so quietly, without shewing that it proves nothing, by proving too much; for infinite Satisfaction must be infinite every Way, in Degree as well as Duration; then this destroys the equitable Rule of proportionable Punishments; for the least Crime requires Satisfaction, infinite Satis∣faction, infinite in Degree, and infinite in Du∣ration — so that a Man must be made a God, before he can be rendered capable of giving such infinite Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324"/>I have not done with this Subject, and shall resume it in my next; for the Post is just going out. Adieu, my own <HI>Fanny!</HI> Read and write, my charming Pupil, while I endeavour to reflect that Light back again upon you, which you first inspired me with.</P>

<P>I AM just come home. My Uncle is as usual; or, as some Man construed Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Motto, <HI>semper eadem,</HI> worse and worse.</P>
<P>Every Thing here in a backward and neglected Way — Why do not you come done, and set Matters to rights? I hope in God I shall not be long the only Slave in your Affairs. I have many Things to take care of; and there is but one Person, I can, or should chuse to confide in, and her Help I am deprived of.

<P>I have finished <HI>Manners,</HI> and still think of that Book, as I did in my last; and could point out several Passages, to shew that it is rather a Collection, than an original Work. I do not mean from his general Reasoning; which, if right, cannot avoid being the same with others,
<PB N="324" REF="325"/>
who have wrote justly upon the same Subject; but what I would instance, are particular Turns of Thought and Expression, which I have met with before. There is one among them taken from <HI>Montesquieu</HI>'s <HI>Persian Letters:</HI>
<Q>That it appears more reasonable, that the Minority, instead of the Majority, should determine a Question; for ten Men think wrong, for one who judges right.</Q>
The only Difference between this Whim in the <HI>Lettres Persanes,</HI> and this Book, is, that <HI>Montesquieu</HI> only threw out this Sentiment as a Stroke of Fancy; but our Moralist seems to advance it as a grave Argument, and supports it by a Text from <HI>Exodus,</HI> disingenuously quoted. His Words are, that the <HI>Jewish</HI> Legislator advises us
<Q>not to pass our Judgment according to the Opinion of the greater Number;</Q>
which Words do certainly support his ridiculous Argument: But observe the literal Words of the Text, and you will see how unfairly he deals with it.
<Q>Thou shalt not follow a Multitude, <HI>to do evil</HI>; neither shalt thou speak in a Cause, to decline after many, <HI>to wrest Judgment.</HI></Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FORGOT to mention to you, in my last, another remarkable Passage in our moral Plagiarist; even <HI>Pope</HI>'s much-admired Simile of a Stone thrown into a standing Lake, verbatim, except the Rhyme.</P>
<P>But let us have done with him, for he inter∣rupted me last Post in the Prosecution of my Argument upon eternal Misery; and how, or how far, I reasoned upon that Subject, I do not recollect at present; for I have been deep involved in Affairs of this World, since I came home: But I shall proceed as Thoughts now occur, without Regard to Order; as you know I take the Liberty with you of making my Letters a Sort of Common-Place-Book. Not that I desire any Writer should see, or expect they would borrow any Thing from these rude Essays, which I find an Amusement to revolve in my own Mind, and a Pleasure to communicate to you, for whom alone I write, tho' it is for both our sakes I read.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that the Scriptures are full of penal Threats; but I do not remember that they are denounced to all Eternity: Nay I think the contrary is implied in a Text, which the Popish Clergy quote for Purgatory;
<Q>there to
<PB N="327" REF="328"/>
remain, 'till thou hast paid the uttermost Farthing.</Q>
It is an Allusion made to the State of a Debtor. I am afraid that even eternal Happiness is not fully promised in the Scriptures, which surely is a more reasonable Faith than the other; and that this glorious Hope is rather a moral Presumption than a divine Revelation. Our principal Arguments upon this Head are drawn from the perfect Goodness of God, the Analogy running through all his Works. The natural Frame of the human Soul, it's frequent Satiety of all worldly Enjoyments, (except alone it's Contemplation of the Divine Nature,) it's earnest Longings after that supreme, elevated, and complete Bliss, and a certain natural Sym∣pathy, the virtuous and religious Mind feels to be again allied to some more excellent Nature, which it seems to have, as it were, a Sense of being lately separated from. I think it may be rationally inferred from all this, that, to satisfy the natural Frame of such a Soul, it's Bliss must be eternal; for Pleasures not made to cloy can give no Satiety. Now extend, rather say limit, our heavenly Bliss to the millionth Power of a millionth Myriad of Years, which is almost infinitely beyond the Art of Numbers to enumerate; yet even the immediate Bliss of the sublimed Spirit would be, from that Re∣flection, rendered imperfect; as, the higher our Happiness in Possession, the more sensibly are
<PB N="328" REF="329"/>
we affected at even the most remote Thought of parting with it. And I should prefer my State even in this vile World, satiated with frail, mortal Joys, and oppressed with life-long Cares, but presuming upon the great Hope of a glorious Immortality, to the most sublime Pleasures of the next, limited in Prospect even one Thought short of Eternity. Shall we lose our earnest Relish, our virtuous Longing after Immortality in a State of certain Bliss, which operates so emphatically in our Souls, even while the Vices of the Body, and the Corruption of the Heart, occasion that Thought to be attended with a Dread of what Eternity we may be doomed to? or may the Soul, in perfect Bliss, have one Desire ungratified? In short, to bring this heart-transporting, metaphysic-inspiring Subject as near to Demonstration as possible, let me presume to argue thus: If the Souls of Men are not im∣mortal, God has granted us less Happiness, than we are capable of, which is contrary to our Notion of God,
<Q>with whom is Fulness of Joy, and Pleasure for evermore.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Man has a rational Prae-sentiment of future Bliss, and a rational Deduction of it's Eternity; but he has neither one or the other with regard to future Misery, or it's Eternity. The only Dread, which appears to me natural to the Mind of Man, is that very shocking one of Annihilation.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="330"/>What I mean is, that Man has not any natural Forebodings of future Misery, tho' his Reason may draw some Inference about it: But then this Reason can never conclude for eternal Punishments; and his Faith must be blind, who could credit that Religion, which adhibited such a Revelation.</P>
<P>So that the Doctrine of Punishments rests merely upon what Revelation is made about them; which, as I hinted before, does not de∣nounce them eternal, at least the Misery.</P>
<P>Nay I think farther, that, tho' Rewards may be agreeable to divine Justice, Punishments are not. If I remember right, I said something upon this Subject to you in a former Letter, by alluding to human Laws; so shall insist on it no farther here: But, to take away all Cavil from this Paradox, and to treat this Subject more equally, I shall deny that either Rewards or Punishments, tho' allowed in the moral Sense, are agreeable to divine Goodness or Justice, in the legislative Sense; and perhaps I may argue in concert with the Scripture too.</P>
<P>The Pleasing or Displeasing of God are but figurative Expressions, which, taken in a literal Sense, have occasioned the Terms of Rewards and Punishments; for thus are divine Matters confounded and impured, by drawing Analogies between them and human Things. Now our good or bad Actions relate entirely to our own
<PB N="330" REF="331"/>
Happiness or Misery; and would it not be partial to bestow a Reward, where there can possibly be no Merit? for, as the Scripture says,
<Q>after all we shall be but unprofitable Servants:</Q>
As it would be cruel to inflict a Punishment, where Ignorance, Passion, or Temptation may lead a Man into Vice; for, as the same Scripture says, "where little is given, little shall be expected."</P>
<P>I would not hazard this Subject, so unfinished, to any Hands but your's, as I am obliged to break off in a very dangerous Crisis; but the Night is far spent, and next Post shall be em∣ployed to extract the Poison.</P>
<P>Adieu, thou sole Partner of my Heart, and only Confidante of all it's Sentiments!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Henry.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="317" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER CCCXVII.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK then, with some sensible Divines, that Rewards and Punishments are not be∣stowed or inflicted upon our Actions, good or bad; but that Happiness or Misery is the pre∣ordained Consequence of Virtue or Vice; and that, as natural Virtue or Vice, as Temperance and Exercise, or Intemperance and Inactivity, produce Health or Disease in this World, so moral Virtue or Vice as essentially are attended with Happiness or Misery in the next.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="332"/>Now, if our Portions hereafter be general moral Consequences, and not particular justiciary Adaptions, I can perceive no Reason how the Soul of Man can be, at any Time, precluded from redeeming itself by a thorough Contrition, and sincere Repentance; or that a Halter or a Quinsey shall be sufficient to deprive it of Bliss, to all Eternity: For a Spirit, at any Period of it's Existence, reclaimed to a full and perfect Sense, Love, and Adoration of the Essence, Truth, Goodness, and Power of God, must necessarily attract to itself that Happiness, which is essentially allied to such a State of Mind.</P>
<P>But some severe Divines may here object, that a departed Spirit can possibly have no Merit in Contrition or Repentance, when Temptation to Sin is no more, and when the consequential Misery is demonstratively ascertained, and severely experienced. To which, Part of my last Letter may be an Answer, where the Merit of Virtue is denied; and the Beginning of this Letter may be referred to, where Happiness is said to be the Consequence, not the Reward of Virtue. And, as we are taught to believe that higher Spirits than our's have been plunged into the Abyss for Sin, in the next World; why may we not hope that a poor human Soul may be capable of emerging from thence, by Righteousness here∣after? for surely Religion is not limited, either in Place or Time, to the narrow Bounds and
<PB N="332" REF="333"/>
short Duration of this paltry Globe; but extends itself thro' the whole Universe of Intelligence, and shall continue to all Eternity.</P>
<P>I look upon this Life to be a State of Trial, and the next to be a State of Purgation, from which, perhaps, the most perfect Man may not be exempt: For Vengeance is not of the Essence of God; but his Nature is so pure, that no Spirit may approach the Throne of his Grace, obscured by Stain or Blemish; and a State of thorough Purgation, that is, of sincere Repen∣tance, without Temptation to Sin, is necessary to prepare us for the Bliss of Angels. So that I look upon the Devil's Empire to be of this World only, and not extended to the next; for here he may tempt, but there he cannot.</P>
<P>I think, then, that a Soul purged from Sin, by any Method, is a proper Object of the Divine Favour.
<Q>Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.</Q>
Can Chastisement then be deemed the Effect of Hatred, in the Lord, "who hateth nothing, which he has made?" And does not a Father cordially love a Son, whom he has reclaimed by Discipline? Is not the Penitence of a Sinner accepted of by God, tho' effected by Pain, Poverty, or other Mis∣fortune in this Life? Shall the whole heavenly Host rejoice over a repentant Sinner in this World; and shall the Circumstance of Time or Place deprive them of Charity, when our
<PB N="333" REF="334"/>
Souls become more nearly allied to them, than in the Flesh?</P>
<P>In short, if Punishments, or Misery, either judiciary or consequential, be eternal, in any one Instance, the Devil has triumphed so far; which is Blasphemy: But, according to the Severity of some Divines, there can be but a small Minority saved; which would look like a very paltry Composition for the Redeemer of Mankind to make.</P>
<P>If this Doctrine may appear to set Men too free from Terror, to influence their Conduct toward a virtuous Life, I shall consider this Subject in that Light, in another Letter; and do assure you, my dearest Ally, that I am as sincerely attached to you, as if I thought my Salvation depended upon it. <HI>Adieu!</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCCXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE my last Letter I have looked into the Bible, and find some Passages, where eternal Punishments are denounced; but then I find also several other Places, where the Words <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>everlasting</HI> are meant in a limited Sense, for a long and indefinite Time. So that I think these Texts do not preclude me from reasoning upon this Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="335"/>I own, the first Thing which occurred to me, when I met with Expressions in the Scripture, that seemed to shock my Reason, and my Idea of God, was, to suppose them only Threats <HI>in Terrorem</HI>; but then this alarmed me about the Consequence, which such a Surmise might draw after it, with regard to the Promises mentioned in the same Scripture. However, upon Recol∣lection, I did not think this Inference should logically follow; for a Promise is a Contract, the virtuous Man a Purchaser, and Justice exacts the Obligation: But the Case is quite different with regard to Threats. A Lord may say to his Steward,
<Q>Tend well this Farm 'till my Return, and I will make thee an Inheritance out of it; but, if you suffer the Soil to be over-grown with Briars, I will cause thee to be flayed alive.</Q>
Now, tho' the Lord must fulfil his Promise out of Justice, he surely may forgive the Penalty out of Mercy.</P>
<P>But I do not mean to insist upon this Argu∣ment; for, as the Texts I hint at may be so interpreted as to agree with the Reasoning of my former Letters, I should be very tender of charging the least Disingenuousness upon the Words of God; and, if they were express and uncontrovertible in this or any other Particular, against my Sense or Opinion, I would, as becomes me, submit my Reason to my Faith. And indeed, tho' the Distinction I have made
<PB N="335" REF="336"/>
between Promises and Threats, does sufficiently prove that Justice or Reason does not require the Completion of denounced Vengeance, yet certainly <HI>Truth</HI> requires that every Thing shall be, as it is affirmed.</P>
<P>In order to help us the better to frame a Judgment upon this Subject, let us take the Matter as high as we can, by beginning at original Sin; and yet all the Curse, we hear, upon that Occasion, seems to be Temptation, Labour, and Death, (<HI>Genesis</HI> iii.15, and to the End.) That is, it may be apprehended, that the natural Consequence of the first Parent's Sin was the debasing human Nature to a State of Frailty, Mechanics, and Mortality; which imperfect Nature was, from thence, derived down to all their Race:
<Q>For an evil Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit.</Q></P>
<P>Our Redeemer afterwards, at a certain Time, (though resolved from the Beginning) takes our Nature upon him, (and is thence stiled our second <HI>Adam</HI>) by which benevolent and godlike Condescension Mankind was retrieved to their former Dignity, so far as to be rendered capable of their former Perfection, perhaps greater; in which the whole Mystery of the Incarnation seems to lie, not in the unaccountable Doctrine of satisfying the Divine Justice; which Doctrine has perplexed the Faith of many well-disposed Christians, and, perhaps, has prevented this
<PB N="336" REF="337"/>
Religion from becoming as universal, as it's other Evidence, and moral Perfection, seems to promise.</P>
<P>That Mankind should labour under Guilt, for the Sin of our first Parents, and that they should be redeemed by the Sacrifice of God; the first not our Crime, and the latter not our Merit; seems to be a Scheme of Providence contrary to Sense or Religion: But that a Race of Beings, proceeding from <HI>Adam,</HI> after his Fall, should consequentially be of too corrupt a Nature to be capable of perfect Bliss; and that our Redeemer, becoming our second Parent, a Man every Way, (Sin only excepted) should thereby restore that Purity to our Nature, as may render it capable of perfect Happiness, is, in my Opinion, a Doctrine agreeable to meta∣physical Philosophy, reconcileable to the Nature of Things, to the eternal Laws of God; and likewise vindicates him from the Charge of Vengeance or Partiality, as the whole Conse∣quences seem to proceed from the original Formation of Things.</P>
<P>From all which Reasoning, I shall venture to conclude against eternal Punishments: For, in the first Instance, at the Fall, even temporary ones are not threatened <HI>in futuro</HI>; and, in the second Instance, at Man's Redemption, if they became so then, how many wretched Souls would be Losers by the Bargain! and Christ
<PB N="337" REF="338"/>
may be said to have overcome Death only, by his Sacrifice, but not to have conquered Sin.</P>
<P>These few Thoughts occurring to me, when I sat down to write, have obliged me to defer my Promise in my last, 'till the next Post.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now retired from the Grand Jury, to perform a Promise I have delayed for some Posts, and think an Assizes a proper Time to discourse about <HI>Judgment to come.</HI></P>
<P>When I first entered upon this Subject, I own I trembled, as <HI>Felix</HI> did, for fear of the Con∣sequence of my Doctrine; therefore I canvassed the Matter a good deal in my own Mind, before I ventured to treat upon it even to you; tho' I was perfectly certain that the Notion of eternal Misery could not add any thing to the Strength of your Virtue, tho' it might, perhaps, take away somewhat of the Merit of it. The Reasons, then, which suffered me to proceed, were these.</P>
<P>If I argued justly, which I endeavoured to do, I cannot apprehend any ill Consequence from
<PB N="338" REF="339"/>
my Subject. Truth cannot injure Truth; and Error is not necessary to bring about the Ends or Designs of Providence.</P>
<P>I do not say that the Propitiation of our Saviour was self-sufficient to redeem us totally; but that it did not leave us in a worse State under the Gospel, than it found us under the Law, (which, with regard to the many, it would have done, upon this Doctrine;) and only enabled us to work out our own Salvation, but I do not think it has limited the Time.</P>
<P>I think that the severe Divines endeavour to prove too much: For, as there is no proportional Justice in eternal Misery, Men may suspect the whole Scheme, from one Flaw, to be but a pious Fraud to deter from Vice; but, when Misery is taught to be the natural Consequence of Vice, Damnation may appear to be unavoid∣able, unless the Great, Immutable Being shall contradict his eternal Laws; which is absurd, and still less to be expected in Favour of a Sinner.</P>
<P>The Terror of eternal Torments either drives Men to Despair, and so does more Harm than Good; or is balanced by the Hope of Mercy, in Proportion to it's Fear, and so is destroyed.</P>
<P>A Man would certainly, with more Prudence, put himself into the Power of a provoked Enemy, than expose himself naked to an easterly Wind;
<PB N="339" REF="340"/>
because, in one Case, something might be hoped from Generosity and Mercy; but, in the other, he must expect the natural Consequence of his Indiscretion and Folly.</P>
<P>I think the Doctrine, as it stands in the Ortho∣doxy, savours too much of human Politics; and the mixing profane with sacred Things has often a dangerous Tendency.</P>
<P>Some Divines argue very unfairly, and un∣comfortably too, upon the Obligations of Man to Virtue, by attributing it to Hope and Fear; as if Rewards and Punishments were, as an <HI>Allay,</HI> necessary to make the too refined Idea of it permanent, and fit for Use. But surely the Love of Virtue is not Hope, nor is the Abhorrence of Vice, Fear; though these very distinct Ideas seem to be confounded by their Definition.</P>
<P>I believe that any Man, who has observed the least upon the Motions of the human Mind, has, at several Times of his Life, perceived a certain Impulse to some Actions, and a Sort of Unwillingness to others, though both, in all human Appearance, indifferent in themselves; nay, sometimes these secret Intimations have moved us contrary to the most obvious Reason about such Things; but in a little Time per∣haps the Genius of these intimate Directions has manifested itself in some remarkable Event
<PB N="340" REF="341"/>
of our Lives, unforeseen, and improbable at that Time.</P>
<P>Is it reasonable then to suppose that such Hints should be afforded us in Things merely relative to our Lives or Fortunes in this World, and that we should be left without some unerring Guide or Impulse with regard to Virtue, upon which our nobler Fortunes and immortal Lives depend? These inward Workings of the Spirit, this natural Consciousness, this Self-evidence, which I have, at several Times, supposed in the Mind of Man, I am well convinced, have, in general, a stronger Effect toward the Influence of Virtue, than all the Art of Logic, supported by the Doctrine of eternal Misery. For my Part, I have been often guilty of Vice, with all the Fear and Trembling of an orthodox Christian; and have, at other Times, been capable of Virtue, without the least Contemplation about Hope.</P>
<P>As true Religion consists in the perfect Love of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>Mark</HI> says of the Love of God,
<Q>This is the first Commandment.</Q></NOTE>, I do not see how Fear is, any way, necessary to Piety; except that best and strongest of all Fears, which proceeds from extreme Love.
<Q>There is Mercy with thee; therefore shalt thou be feared.</Q>
And I cannot help joining
<PB N="341" REF="342"/>
with <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who says,
<Q>that Priests have made Religion so very selfish, that I do not see, after all, what Merit there is in it worth rewarding.</Q>
Fear may deter from Vice, but can never conduce to Virtue.</P>
<P>The less we suppose the Deity capable of Cruelty or Revenge, the higher our Love must naturally rise; and it is certain that Mankind is apt to undertake nobler and more difficult Actions from the Spirit of Love, than from the Passion of Fear. There is a Courage in our Natures, which spurns at Fear; but a Tender∣ness in our Frames, which disposes to Love: And, if any Man is base enough to be in∣fluenced by Terror, it is because he has not had his Mind sufficiently imbued with more worthy Principles; and, in this Case, which is corrupt Morals, it is too often found that even Fear will have no Avail. Instances are num∣berless of moral Pagans, independent of Hope: For, tho' in the Writings of the Antients there are very fine Reasonings upon a future Life, and Retributions of Justice; yet these appear to be rather the <HI>Effect</HI> of their Philosophy, than the <HI>Cause</HI> of their Virtue.</P>
<P>The Jesuits have a blasphemous Tenet with regard to Communicants:
<Q>That Attrition alone, which proceeds merely from the Fear of Hell-Torments, without Contrition, which
<PB N="342" REF="343"/>
comprehends the Love of God, is sufficient to justify a Sinner at the Sacrament.</Q></P>
<P>I will here give you some of the truly religious Sentiments of Father <HI>Quesnel,</HI> which I think regard this Subject; and, in order to raise your Esteem for them, I need only tell you, they are some of the Propositions condemned by the infamous Bull <HI>Unigenitus.</HI></P>
<P><Q>As Sin proceeds from a mistaken Love of ourselves, so Virtue proceeds from a true Love of God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Fear stops only the Hand; but the Heart remaineth adherent to Sin, as long as it is not directed by the Love of Justice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He, who refrains from Evil only out of Fear of Punishment, commits it in his Heart, and is already guilty of it before God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He, who is baptized, is yet under the Law, even as a <HI>Jew,</HI> if he doth not fulfil it, or if he fulfil it only thro' Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Moses,</HI> and the Prophets, the Priests, and the Doctors of the Law are dead, without sending any Children to God, since they have made Slaves, but thro' Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They, that are under the Curse of the Law, do no Good; because it is equal Sin to do Evil, or to shun it thro' Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He, that approacheth God, should not come to him with brutal Passions; nor be
<PB N="343" REF="344"/>
led by Instinct or Fear, as Beasts, but by Faith and Love, as Children.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Slavish Fear represents God as a severe, imperious, unjust, and unmerciful Master.</Q></P>
<P>To all which I shall add, that Fear may make good Citizens, but Love alone makes good Christians. And, upon the whole, I really think that in my Doctrine there is Mystery enough to exercise Faith, and Inducements sufficient to influence Action.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<Q>Several other Thoughts occurred to me upon this Subject, but I think I have hinted them in former Letters.</Q>

<HEAD>LETTER CCCXX.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE, ever since the Close of my late nice and extraordinary Subject, been examining and viewing it in several Lights, to find out whether my Reasoning had proceeded from the Prejudice of former Opinions, or had arisen from an Hope produced by a Sinner's Fear. But I found, that, during a constant Neglect of religious and Christian Duties, and a free Indulgence of a debauched and libertine Life,
<PB N="344" REF="345"/>
I preserved an unhesitating Belief in the Ortho∣doxy of Hell-Torments; and that, 'till within these few Years, that is, since I became in Practice, as well as Belief, a Christian, I never had the least Doubt upon the Subject. The Truth is, that I had never before given myself Leisure to reason about Religion, and had en∣tirely rested upon a childish Belief, instead of supporting myself by a rational Faith. Perhaps a Dispute upon this Subject may be put an End to by a very strong, though not obvious, Distinction between <HI>Punishment</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI>; and I will agree with the Orthodoxy, that Sinners may be eternally punished, though not eternally miserable. A less Degree of Bliss, than we are taught from Reason and Revelation our Souls are capable of, is a Punishment, but not a Misery; and, after having suffered such Pains and Torment, emblematized by the <HI>purging so as by Fire,</HI> as is sufficient to fulfil the Measure of divine Justice, some inferior Degree of immortal Bliss may be the highest Portion of a Sinner's Redemption; the Consciousness of which Limi∣tation having proceeded from his own Vices, or Demerits, may be that Punishment, which is described in Scripture by the Metaphor of <HI>the Worm that never dieth.</HI></P>
<P>As I have, thro' the Course of this Argument, made use merely of human Reason, instead of
<PB N="345" REF="346"/>
scriptural Authority, I shall here call in Aid some profane Writing to support me. <HI>Socrates</HI> speaks by <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Gorgias</HI> much to this same Purpose; and again in his <HI>Phaedo,</HI> where he is discoursing just before his Death. I have not the Book here, or I would send you the Quotations.</P>
<P>Now I can hardly suffer this to pass for pro∣fane Authority; for he was not only the greatest Heathen that ever lived, but was stiled, by some of the Fathers of the Church, a Christian before Christianity; and <HI>Erasmus</HI> seems to consider him as an inspired Person. Perhaps, the Fulness of Time being then near at Hand, and the World, as it were, entient with the God of Life and Immortality, some Ray of Divinity might have illumined that great Man, as the Sun disperses a Twilight, before itself appears.</P>
<P>It was at this remarkable Aera, when moral Philosophy was brought to the highest Pitch that ever it arrived at, in the Heathen World, that <HI>Socrates,</HI> or <HI>Plato</HI> for him, acknowledged the Insufficiency of natural Reason to perfect this great Scheme, and called aloud for a Revelation to dispel the Mists of Error, and afford us a certain, infallible, and safe Guide to direct Mankind in the Paths of Virtue.</P>
<P>If I have erred in my Reasonings upon this Subject, it has been owing more to the Weak∣ness
<PB N="346" REF="347"/>
of my Understanding, than the Wickedness of my Heart. So I shall conclude here with the two last Lines of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Epitaph, the whole of which I once translated for you:
<Q><L>Humanum est errare, et nescire:</L>
<L>Ens Entium, miserere mei!</L></Q></P>
