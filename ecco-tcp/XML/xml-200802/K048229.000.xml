<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>FINDING among the different pieces I have composed for Ranelagh and the Theatre a number of Ballads which I took great pains with, and which have been but little heard, I thought I could not better employ my leisure time than in furnishing upon some fa∣miliar plan the dialogue necessary to work up these materials into a Ballad Farce, a species of entertainment which has always been well re∣ceived, and which as it has lain dormant for some time, I thought would have so far the charms of novelty to recommend it.</P>
<P>I had heard of a piece of this sort, which has the characters of a Waterman and a Gardener in it; and the scene of which is laid at Bat∣tersea: This I enquired after, but was informed it was out of print; I nevertheless liked the idea of those two characters so well, that I de∣termined
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
to pursue the hint as for as it was ne∣cessary for my purpose; I dare say it must be evident to every one that I have done no more; I never read the piece in question, nor do I for a certainty at this moment know the title of it.</P>
<P>I mention this circumstance because I am re∣solved to acknowledge at all times from whence I collect any matter for the trifles I may have an opportunity of presenting to the public. I must be an egregious egotist indeed, and little entitled to the indulgence they have hitherto favoured me with, if I could be so unconscious of my own inability as to suppose I ever can present them with any thing worthy their notice with∣out assistance of this sort; beside, in this I am serving myself, for I must be well convinced, the most effectual way to secure their indul∣gence is to deal as honestly by them as they deal generously by every man in my situation.</P>
<P>With regard to the performers, if I men∣tioned the merit of any one in particular, I
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
should do injustice to the rest; I shall there∣fore say in general, that their assiduity has been unwearied upon this, as well as upon every other similar occasion.</P>
<P>The piece is indeed incomparably performed, and it is very apparent that the greatest part of its success is owing to this circumstance.</P>

<P>This, now, is my delight, to sit at breakfast while the men work. Come, honest Tom, let us make an end of our tankard, before my wife gets up; her raking so in London, (where between you and I, she stays a devilish deal longer than while she sells the sparrow-grass) keeps her a-bed woundy late of a morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Master Bundle, I have often-times thought to myself, that it was a wondersome kind of thing, how it came to pass, that you two agree so badly; when, out of all the four and twenty hours, you are hardly ever above two of them together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Thomas! Thomas! 'tis very hard that a man like me can't be allow'd to get drunk once a day, without being call'd to an account for it; but between you and I, she is the arrantest—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(within)</STAGE> What are you all about there? Where's your lazy, idle master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear she has begun to ring her usual peal; this is the way the moment she is up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I believe she seldom leaves off till she goes to bed; does she Master Bundle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor then neither; every thing must be her way, or there's no getting any peace. As soon as the marketing's over in town, away she and her favourite Robin, trudge to the two-shilling gallery of one of the play-houses; where they have pick'd up such a pack of damn'd nonsense, about sentiments and stuff, that I am not only obliged to put up with her scolding me all the time I do see her, but I am scolded in a language I don't understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I should like that best now; for then, you know, one has no right to take it for scolding at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, when once she raises her voice, you never can take it for any thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, mayhap, 'tis all concerning this same play-house business, that she's so stout against
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
me, and does all she can to serve Master Robin with Miss Wilhelminy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there was another of her freaks; she was then as fond of romances, as she is now of plays; and though my father, who was as plain a man as myself, swore he would not leave us a farthing, if we did not call the girl Margery; nothing would satisfy her forsooth, but we must give her the name of Wilelmina:—'Tis such a damn'd, confounded, hard name, that I was a matter of three years before I cou'd pronounce it right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, stand to your oars, for here she comes!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS it not a most marvellous thing, Mr. Bundle, that I must be such an eternal slave to my family, in this here manner, while you and your cologuing companions are besotting, and squandering away your time with your guzzling, and every thing goes to rack and manger. I that am such a quiet, well-bred, easy, tame creature, that never scolds, nor riots, nor dins your faults in your ears; but am always as gentle and as patient as a lamb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a very good wife to be sure, my dear, only a little inclined to talking; if you, now, had no tongue, or I had no ears, we should be the happiest couple in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a provocating creature!—tongue! But this comes of marrying such a scum of a fellow, one that you may throw away all the tenderness in the world for, before it makes any oppression upon him.—But it serves me right, for 'tis very well known, what great offers I refused upon your account!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how it shou'd be otherwise than well-known, my love; for I generally hear of it about six times a day: But, my dear, don't you think it will be necessary to give orders about loading the cart, against you go to London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall not go to London to-night at all: Robin, Miss Wilelmina, and I, are invited to go with a party to see the rowing match, this after∣noon; and afterwards there is to be a hop at Mr. Wick's, the tallow-chandler's, where I intend to settle the purliminaries about my daughter's wedding: And I desire you to take care, that the pines are not all gone before next week, for I intend to invite the whole party to a hop here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam Bundle, be'n't you some how or other afraid, that what with one thing, and what with another, you'll hop all the money out of your hus∣band's pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't direct my discourse to you, Sir; but tis my husband that encourages you to behave in such a brutish and outrageous manner. He has pro∣mised you I know, that you shall have my daughter, but I'll make him know who's at home—I will:—I'll assure you, indeed!—Such a fellow as you!—A nasty, idling, scurvy rapscallion, that leads a filthy, drunken, lazy life; sotting in one ale-house, and sot∣ting in another; and shall such a low brute dare to expire to the honour of marrying Miss Wilelmina Bundle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what, Ma'am Bundle, I should not care much for marrying your daughter, if she was not of a little better temper than yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the villain!—Why you vile, wicked—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, how can you put yourself in such a passion, you, you know, who are such a tame creature—one that never scolds, or riots?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. BUN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll riot you all to some tune, I will—therefore Mr. Bundle, unless you wou'd have me sue for a separate maintainance—mind what I say—next time I go to London, I shall take Robin with me to Doctor's Commons, and nothing but your consent to his marrying your daughter, shall ever make me look upon you again.</P>

<P>Well, 'tis a most charming thing to plague these creatures—die for me—If I had not given myself some airs to him, he never cou'd have thought of such a thing; but that's the way, if one does not use them like dogs, there's no getting any thing civil from them—but here comes Robin, I must plague him in another way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Wilelmina, may I have the unspeakable happiness to tell you, how much words fall short of the great honour, you wou'd prefer upon me, if you wou'd grant me the request, of favouring me with your hand this evening at the hop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Robin, what particular inclina∣tion can you have to dance with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>What inclination, Miss! ask the plants why they love a shower? ask the sun-flower why it loves the sun? ask the snow-drop why it is white? ask the violet why it is blue? ask the trees why they blossom? the cabages why they grow? 'tis all because they can't help it; no more can I help my love for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Robin, how gallant you are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Wilelmina! thou art straiter than the straitest tree! sweeter than the sweetest flower! thy hand is as white as a lilly! thy breath is sweet as honey-suckles! and when you speak, grace is in all your steps! heav'n in your eye! in every gesture—Oh dear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Robin, you have said that so often—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you never heard me say this in your life—now mind. My heart is for all the world just like a hot-bed, where the seed of affection, sown by your matchless charms, and warmed by that sun, your
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
eyes, became a beautiful flower, which is just now full blown; and all I desires, Miss, is that you'll condescend to gather it and stick in your bosom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what pretensions have you to think I shall ever consent to such a thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretensions, Miss! because my love is bound∣less as the sea, and my heart is as full of Cupid's ar∣rows, as a sweet briar is full of thorns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am afraid if I was foolish enough to believe you, you wou'd soon forget me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forget you, Miss! 'tis impossible! sooner shall asparagus forget to grow, seed forget to rise, leaves to fall, sooner shall trees grow with their roots in the air, and their branches buried in the earth, than I forget my Wilelmina.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I do declare there's no resisting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROB.</SPEAKER>
<P>Resisting me, Miss! no I don't know how you shou'd; my heart is stock'd with love, as a flower garden is stock'd with flowers. The Cupids that have fled from your eyes and taken shelter there, are as much out of number as the leaves on a tree, or the colours in a bed of tulips; You are to me what the summer is to the garden, and if you don't revive me with the sun-shine of your favour, I shall be over∣run with the weeds of disappointment, and choak'd up with the brambles of despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That wou'd be a pity, indeed.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, I have seen him, and a most deplorable figure he cuts; I believe by this time he has enter'd himself on board a man of war; that so, as the his∣tory book says, he may put an end to his existence and my cruelty together.</P>

<P>WHAT shall I do with this perverse girl?

<P>Why, my dear, are you ever in a passion?</P>

<P>Don't provoke me—you think, I sup∣pose, because you have got your daughter on your side, to carry all before you; but, Mr Bundle, though

you have been coaxing and wheedling her to marry that low, dirty—I won't bemean myself by repeating his filthy name.

<P>My dear, if you had about half as much reason as you have passion, how very easily cou'd all these matters be settled; for you are wrong, from the begining to the end, in this affair; in the first place, I don't think it wou'd be very undutiful in a girl to do what her father desires her, was it as you say; in the next, I desired her to give her consent to marry Thomas, 'tis true, but she refused me.</P>
</SP>

<P>What you saw my wife with me, she is the most agreeable company, it must be confess'd.</P>

<P>Yes, but I hope I shan't have such a crank and humoursome piece of stuff to deal with as you have; I don't know not I, but for my share, I can't see why married people mayn't be happy as well as others; 'tis my mind, Miss here, is trying which is the most loving of us two, and if so I wou'd not give my little Robin three-pence for his chance, for I know as well as can be, that he has no more notion of making a woman happy than nothing at all—but here she comes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Miss, as to breaking my heart, to be sure I should go well-nigh to do that, if I could not persuade you to have me; but I have been thinking that it would be better to try if I can't stay at home, and do something to obtain your consent, for to be sure the pleasure of having you, is not what every body deserves.</P>

<L><HI>I see, my dear, 'tis all in vain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Since this you think expedient,</HI></L>
<L><HI>If of the past you'll not complain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Henceforth I'll prove obedient.</HI></L>

<L><HI>My child, you've fairly won my heart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You took no counsel from us;</HI></L>

<L><HI>Preferr'd your honest Thomas:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twas wisely done,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shake hands, my son,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Love's lesson you have taught her;</HI></L>
