<P>IT may perhaps be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the author has ventured to make Polydore a person of the Drama, on the autho∣rity of Hyginus, a Greek grammarian, who tells us in one of his fables, that Ilione, by a feigned murder, deceived Polymestor, and preserved her brother's life.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. LLOYD.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>And spoken by Mr. GARRICK.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>A Grecian bard, two thousand years ago,</L>
<L>Plan'd this sad fable, of illustrious woe;</L>
<L>Waken'd each soft emotion of the breast,</L>
<L>And call'd forth tears, that would not be supprest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, O ye mighty sirs, of judgement chaste,</L>
<L>Who, lacking genius, have a deal of taste,</L>
<L>Can you forgive our modern ancient piece,</L>
<L>Which brings no chorus, tho' it comes from Greece;</L>
<L>Kind social chorus, which all humours meets,</L>
<L>And sings and dances, up and down the streets.</L>
<L>— Oh! might true taste in these unclassic days,</L>
<L>Revive the Grecian fashions, with their plays!</L>
<L>Then rais'd on stilts, our player's would stalk and rage,</L>
<L>And at three steps, stride o'er a modern stage;</L>
<L>Each gesture then would boast unusual charms,</L>
<L>From lengthen'd legs, stuff'd body, sprawling arms!</L>
<L>Your critic eye would then no pigmies see,</L>
<L>But buskin's make a giant, ev'n of <HI>Me.</HI></L>
<L>No features then the poet's mind would trace,</L>
<L>But one blank vizor blot out all the face.</L>
<L>O! glorious times, when actors thus could strike</L>
<L>Expressive, inexpressive, all alike!</L>
<L>Less change of face, than in our Punch they saw,</L>
<L>For Punch can roll his eyes, and wag his jaw;</L>
<L>With one set glare they mouth'd the rumbling verse,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> look not half so fierce!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>Yet tho' depriv'd of instruments like these,</L>
<L>Nature, perhaps, may find a way to please;</L>
<L>Which, wheresoe'er she glows with genuine flame,</L>
<L>In <HI>Greece,</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> is the same.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of raillery then, ye modern wits beware,</L>
<L>Nor damn the Grecian poet, for the player.</L>
<L>Theirs was the skill, with honest help of art,</L>
<L>To win by just degrees, the yielding heart.</L>
<L>What if our Shakespear claims the magic throne,</L>
<L>And in one instant makes us all his own,</L>
<L>They differ only, in the point of view,</L>
<L>For Shakespear's nature, was their nature too.</L>

<L>Yes, from releas'd Polyxena may spring</L>

<L>Yes, th' old man</L>

<L>The princess shall be fetter'd with a charm</L>
<L>Faster than his fond efforts can undo.</L>
<L>And for the queen — why, let the queen go free.</L>
<L>It harms not us: her barren womb no more</L>
<L>Shall teem with Trojan pests: and such an act</L>
<L>May smooth the roughness of our enterprize,</L>
