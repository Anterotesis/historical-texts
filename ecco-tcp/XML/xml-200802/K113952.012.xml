<HEAD>DECEMBER.</HEAD>
<L>LAst of the months, severest of them all,</L>
<L>Woe to the regions where thy terrors fall!</L>
<L>Hail to thy tempests, which the deep deform,</L>
<L>Thrice hail thy ruthless hurricane and storm!</L>
<L>Now Eolus, let forth thy mightiest blast,</L>
<L>By land to rock the spire, by sea the mast;</L>
<L>Let earth and ocean feel thy potent sway,</L>
<L>And give thy blasts their full impetuous way:</L>
<L>For lo! the fiery horses of the sun</L>
<L>Thro' the twelve Signs their rapid course have run,</L>
<L>Time, like a serpent, bites his forked tail,</L>
<L>And Winter on a Goat bestrides the gale;</L>
<L>Rough blows the north wind near Arcturus' star,</L>
<L>And sweeps, unrein'd, across the polar bar,</L>
<L>On the world's confines, where the sea-bears prowl,</L>
<L>And Greenland whales, like moving islands, roll:</L>
<L>There, thro' the skies, on brooms, are seen to ride,</L>
<L>The Lapland wizzard, and his hellish bride;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>There, on a sledge, the rain-deer drives the swain</L>
<L>To meet his mistress on the frost-bound plain:</L>
<L>Have mercy, Winter!—for we own thy power,</L>
<L>Thy flooding deluge, and thy drenching shower;</L>
<L>Yes—we acknowledge what thy prowess can,</L>
<L>But oh! have pity on the toil of man!</L>
<L>And, tho' the floods thy adamantine chain</L>
<L>Submissive wear—yet spare the treasur'd grain:</L>
<L>The peasants to thy mercy now resign</L>
<L>The infant seed—their hope and future mine:</L>
<L>Not always Phoebus bends his vengeful bow,</L>
<L>Oft in mid winter placid breezes blow,</L>
<L>Oft tinctur'd with the bluest transmarine,</L>
<L>The fretted canopy of heaven is seen;</L>
<L>Girded with argent lamps, the full-orb'd moon</L>
<L>In mild December emulates the noon;</L>
<L>Tho' short the respite, if the saphire blue</L>
<L>Stains the bright lustre with an inky hue;</L>
<L>Then a black wreck of clouds is seen to fly,</L>
<L>In broken shatters, thro' the frighted sky:</L>
<L>But if fleet Eurus scour the vaulted plain,</L>
<L>Then all the stars propitious shine again;</L>
<L>Like Myra's face appears the vivid scene,</L>
<L>And, like her mind, free, open, and serene.</L>

<L>Thy face as smooth, and placid as the Spring,</L>
<L>Has felt, with comfort felt, the beam of heaven,</L>

<LG>
<L>THY justice, heavenly King, and that great day,</L>
<L>When virtue, long abandon'd and forlorn,</L>
<L>Shall raise her pensive head; and vice, that erst</L>
<L>Rang'd unreprov'd and free, shall sink appall'd;</L>
<L>I sing adventurous.—But what eye can pierce</L>
<L>The vast immeasurable realms of space,</L>
<L>O'er which Messiah drives his flaming car</L>
<L>To that bright region, where enthron'd He sits,</L>
<L>First-born of heaven, to judge assembled worlds,</L>
<L>Cloath'd in celestial radiance! Can the Muse,</L>
<L>Her feeble wing all damp with earthly dew,</L>
<L>Soar to that bright empyreal, where, around,</L>
<L>Myriads of angels, God's perpetual choir,</L>
<L>Hymn hallelujahs; and, in concert loud,</L>
<L>Chant songs of triumph to their Maker's praise?—</L>
<L>Yet will I strive to sing, albeit unus'd</L>
<L>To tread poetic soil. What tho' the wiles</L>
<L>Of Fancy me enchanted ne'er could lure</L>
<L>To rove o'er fairy lands; to swim the streams</L>
<L>That thro' her valleys weave their mazy way,</L>
<L>Or climb her mountain tops; yet will I raise</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>My feeble voice, to tell what harmony</L>
<L>(Sweet as the music of the rolling spheres)</L>
<L>Attunes the moral world: that virtue still</L>
<L>May hope her promis'd crown; that vice may dread</L>
<L>Vengeance, tho' late; that reasoning pride may own</L>
<L>Just, tho' unsearchable, the ways of heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sceptic! whoe'er thou art, who say'st the soul,</L>
<L>That particle divine, which God's own breath</L>
<L>Inspir'd into the mortal mass, shall rest</L>
<L>Annihilate, till duration has unroll'd</L>
<L>Her never-ending line; tell, if thou know'st,</L>
<L>Why every nation, every clime, tho' all</L>
<L>In laws, in rites, in manners disagree,</L>
<L>With one content expect another world,</L>
<L>Where wickedness shall weep? why Paynim bards</L>
<L>Fabled Elysian plains; Tartarean lakes,</L>
<L>Styx and Cocytos? tell, why Hali's sons</L>
<L>Have feign'd a paradise of mirth, and love,</L>
<L>Banquets, and blooming Nymphs? or rather tell,</L>
<L>Why on the brink of Orellana's stream,</L>
<L>Where never Science rear'd her sacred torch,</L>
<L>Th' untutor'd Indian dreams of happier worlds</L>
<L>Behind the cloud-topt hill? why in each breast</L>
<L>Is plac'd a friendly monitor, that prompts,</L>
<L>Informs, directs, encourages, forbids?</L>
<L>Tell why, on unknown evil, grief attends;</L>
<L>Or joy on secret good? Why conscience acts</L>
<L>With tenfold force, when sickness, age, or pain,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>Stands tottering on the precipice of death?</L>
<L>Or why such horror gnaws the guilty soul</L>
<L>Of dying sinners; while the good man sleeps</L>
<L>Peaceful and calm, and with a smile expires?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look round the world! with what a partial hand</L>
<L>The scale of bliss and misery is sustain'd!</L>
<L>Beneath the shade of cold obscurity</L>
<L>Pale Virtue lies; no arm supports her head;</L>
<L>No friendly voice speaks comfort to her soul;</L>
<L>Nor soft-eyed Pity drops a melting tear:</L>
<L>But, in their stead, Contempt and rude Disdain</L>
<L>Insult the banish'd wanderer: on the goes</L>
<L>Neglected and forlorn: disease, and cold,</L>
<L>And famine, worst of ills, her steps attend:</L>
<L>Yet patient, and to heaven's just will resign'd,</L>
<L>She ne'er is seen to weep, or heard to sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now turn your eyes to yon sweet-smelling bower,</L>
<L>Where, flush'd with all the insolence of wealth,</L>
<L>Sits pamper'd Vice! for him th' Arabian gale</L>
<L>Breathes forth delicious odours; Gallia's hills</L>
<L>For him pour nectar from the purple vine;</L>
<L>Nor think for these he pays the tribute due</L>
<L>To heaven: of heaven he never names the name;</L>
<L>Save when with imprecations, dark, and dire,</L>
<L>He points his jest obscene. Yet buxom Health</L>
<L>Sits on his rosy cheek; yet Honour gilds</L>
<L>His high exploits; and downy-pinion'd Sleep</L>
<L>Sheds a soft opiate o'er his peaceful couch.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
<L>See'st thou this, righteous Father! see'st thou this,</L>
<L>And wilt thou ne'er repay? shall good and ill</L>
<L>Be carried undistinguish'd to the land</L>
<L>Where all things are forgot?—Ah! no; the day</L>
<L>Will come, when Virtue from the cloud shall burst</L>
<L>That long obscur'd her beams; when Sin shall fly</L>
<L>Back to her native hell; there sink eclips'd</L>
<L>In penal darkness; where nor star shall rise,</L>
<L>Nor ever sunshine pierce th' impervious gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On that great day the solemn trump shall sound,</L>
<L>(That trump, which once, in heaven, on man's revolt,</L>
<L>Convok'd th' astonish'd seraphs;) at whose voice</L>
<L>Th' unpeopled graves shall pour forth all their dead.</L>
<L>Then shall th' assembled nations of the earth</L>
<L>From every quarter at the judgment-seat</L>
<L>Unite; Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks,</L>
<L>Parthians; and they who dwelt on Tyber's banks,</L>
<L>Names fam'd of old: or who of later age,</L>
<L>Chinese, and Russian, Mexican, and Turk,</L>

<L>Their tents on Niger's banks; or, where the sun</L>
<L>Pours on Golconda's spires his early light,</L>
<L>Drink Ganges' sacred stream. At once shall rise</L>
<L>Whom distant ages to each others sight</L>
<L>Had long denied: before the throne shall kneel</L>
<L>Some great Progenitor, while at his side</L>
<L>Stands his descendant thro' a thousand lines.</L>
<L>Whate'er their nation, and whate'er their rank,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>Heroes, and patriarchs, slaves, and sceptred kings,</L>
<L>With equal eye the God of All shall see;</L>
<L>And judge with equal love. What tho' the great</L>
<L>With costly pomp, and aromatic sweets,</L>
<L>Embalm'd his poor remains; or thro' the dome</L>
<L>A thousand tapers shed their gloomy light,</L>
<L>While solemn organs to his parting soul</L>
<L>Chanted slow orisons? say, by what mark</L>
<L>Do'st thou discern him from that lowly swain,</L>
<L>Whose mouldering bones beneath the thorn-bound turf</L>
<L>Long lay neglected?—All at once shall rise;</L>
<L>But not to equal glory: for, alas!</L>
<L>With howlings dire, and execrations loud,</L>
<L>Some wail their fatal birth.—First among these</L>
<L>Behold the mighty murtherers of mankind;</L>
<L>They who in sport whole kingdoms slew; or they</L>
<L>Who to the tottering pinnacle of power</L>
<L>Waded thro' seas of blood! how will they curse</L>
<L>The madness of ambition! how lament</L>
<L>Their dear-bought laurels; when the widow'd wife,</L>
<L>And childless mother, at the judgment-seat</L>
<L>Plead trumpet-tongu'd against them!—Here are they</L>
<L>Who sunk an aged father to the grave:</L>
<L>Or, with unkindness hard, and cold disdain,</L>
<L>Slighted a brother's sufferings:—Here are they,</L>
<L>Whom fraud and skilful treachery long secur'd;</L>
<L>Who from the infant virgin tore her dower,</L>
<L>And eat the orphan's bread:—who spent their stores</L>
<L>In selfish luxury; or, o'er their gold</L>
<L>Prostrate and pale, ador'd the useless heap.—</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="27"/>Here too who stain'd the chaste connubial bed;—</L>
<L>Who mix'd the poisonous bowl;—or broke the ties</L>
<L>Of hospitable friendship;—And the wretch,</L>
<L>Whose listless soul, sick with the cares of life,</L>
<L>Unsummon'd, to the presence of his God</L>
<L>Rush'd in with insult rude. How would they joy</L>
<L>Once more to visit earth; and, tho' oppress'd</L>
<L>With all, that pain or famine can inflict,</L>
<L>Pant up the hill of life? vain wish! the Judge</L>
<L>Pronounces doom eternal on their heads,</L>
<L>Perpetual punishment. Seek not to know</L>
<L>What punishment! for that th' Almighty Will</L>
<L>Has hid from mortal eyes. And shall vain man,</L>
<L>With curious search refin'd, presume to pry</L>
<L>Into thy secrets, Father! no: let him</L>
<L>With humble patience all thy works adore,</L>
<L>And walk in all thy paths: so shall his meed</L>
<L>Be great in heaven; so haply shall he 'scape</L>
<L>Th' immortal worm, and never-ceasing fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who are they, who, bound in ten-fold chains,</L>
<L>Stand horribly aghast? this is that crew</L>
<L>Who strove to pull Jehovah from his throne,</L>
<L>And, in the place of heaven's eternal King,</L>
<L>Set up the phantom Chance. For them in vain</L>
<L>Alternate seasons cheer'd the rolling year;</L>
<L>In vain the sun, o'er herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</L>
<L>Shed genial influence, mild; and the pale moon</L>
<L>Repair'd her waning orb.—Next these is plac'd</L>
<L>The vile blasphemer; he, whose impious wit</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="28"/>Profan'd the sacred mysteries of faith;</L>
<L>And 'gainst th' impenetrable walls of heaven</L>
<L>Planted his feeble battery.—By these stands</L>
<L>The arch-Apostate: He with many a wile</L>
<L>Exhorts them still to foul revolt. Alas!</L>
<L>No hope have they from black despair, no ray</L>
<L>Shines thro' the gloom to cheer their sinking souls.</L>
<L>In agonies of grief they curse the hour</L>
<L>When first they left Religion's onward way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These on the left are rang'd: but on the right</L>
<L>A chosen band appears, who fought beneath</L>
<L>The banner of Jehovah, and defied</L>
<L>Satan's united legions. Some, unmov'd</L>
<L>At the grim tyrant's frown, o'er barbarous climes</L>
<L>Diffus'd the gospel's light: Some, long immur'd,</L>
<L>(Sad servitude!) in chains, and dungeons pin'd:</L>
<L>Or, rack'd with all the agonies of pain,</L>
<L>Breath'd out their faithful lives. Thrice happy they</L>
<L>Whom heaven elected to that glorious strife!—</L>
<L>Here are they plac'd, whose kind munificence</L>
<L>Made heaven-born Science raise her drooping head;</L>
<L>And on the labours of a future race</L>
<L>Entail'd their just reward.—Thou, amongst these,</L>

<L>Who fed the hungry; to the thirsty lip</L>

<L>Who heard the widow's tender tale; and shook</L>
<L>The galling shackle from the prisoners feet:</L>
<L>Who each endearing tie, each office knew,</L>
<L>Of meek-eyed, heaven-descended Charity.—</L>
<L>O Charity, thou Nymph divinely fair!</L>
<L>Sweeter than those whom antient poets bound</L>
<L>In Amity's indissoluble chain,</L>
<L>The Graces! how shall I essay to paint</L>
<L>Thy charms, celestial Maid; and, in rude verse,</L>
<L>Blazon those deeds thy self didst ne'er reveal?</L>
<L>For thee nor rankling Envy can infect,</L>
<L>Nor rage transport, nor high o'erweening Pride</L>
<L>Puff up with vain conceit: ne'er didst thou smile</L>
<L>To see the sinner, as a verdant tree,</L>
<L>Spread his luxuriant branches o'er the stream;</L>
<L>While like some blasted trunk the righteous fall,</L>
<L>Prostrate, forlorn.—When prophecies shall fail,</L>
<L>When tongues shall cease, when knowledge is no more,</L>
<L>And this great day is come; thou by the throne</L>

<L>And dark abyss, where Sin, and Satan reign!</L>

<LG>
<L>But, can the Muse, her numbers all too weak,</L>
<L>Tell how that restless element of fire</L>
<L>Shall wage with seas and earth intestine war,</L>
<L>And deluge all creation? Whether (so</L>

<L>Lawless he wanders, shall rush headlong on</L>
<L>Thwarting th' ecliptic, where th' unconscious earth</L>
<L>Rolls in her wonted course: whether the sun,</L>

<L>Attract her long reluctant: or the caves,</L>
<L>Those dread volcanos, where engendering lie</L>
<L>Sulphureous minerals. from their dark abyss</L>
<L>Pour streams of liquid fire; while from above,</L>
<L>As erst on Sodom, heaven's avenging hand</L>
<L>Rains fierce combustion.—Where are now the works</L>
<L>Of art, the toil of ages? Where are now</L>
<L>Th' imperial cities, sepulchres, and domes,</L>
<L>Trophies, and pillars?—Where is Egypt's boast,</L>
<L>Those lofty pyramids, which high in air</L>

<L>Of Memphian pride a lasting monument?—</L>
<L>Tell me where Athens rais'd her towers?—Where Thebes</L>

<L>And aw'd the tributary world to peace?—</L>
<L>Shew me the rampart, which o'er many a hill,</L>

<L>As now by streaming cataracts of fire,</L>
<L>Was whelm'd by mighty waters?—All at once</L>
<L>Are vanish'd and dissolv'd: no trace remains,</L>
<L>No mark of vain distinction: heaven itself,</L>

<L>Spangling the golden canopy of night,</L>
<L>Which oft the Tuscan with his optic glass</L>
<L>Call'd from their wonderous height, to read their names,</L>
<L>And magnitude, some winged minister</L>
<L>Shall quench: and (surest sign that all on earth</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is that awful, that tremendous day,</L>
<L>Whose coming who shall tell? for as a thief</L>
<L>Unheard, unseen, it steals with silent pace</L>
<L>Thro' night's dark gloom—Perhaps as here I sit,</L>

<LG>
<L>To tame the barren earth by toil and skill,</L>
<L>Raise the low stream, and sink the lofty hill,</L>
<L>The soul first taught; and o'er the mounting tide,</L>
<L>Borne by the winds, in floating forts to ride;</L>
<L>From various climes to bring their various store.</L>
<L>Silver and gold from rich Peruvia's shore;</L>

<L>While Persia's costly silks our limbs array.</L>
<L>By letters we converse with every sage,</L>

<L>And imitate the bounteous power above,</L>
<L>In justice, goodness, purity, and love!</L>
<L>But will the wise Creator throw away</L>
<L>Such talents on the creature of a day?</L>
<L>A creature, which to virtue's heights can soar,</L>
<L>And, drinking deep of knowledge, thirsts for more.</L>
<L>Shall he! cut off from life, no more to bloom,</L>
<L>For ever sleep forgotten in the tomb?</L>
<L>Or may we not, with humble hope, conclude,</L>
<L>That since, with such prerogatives endued,</L>
<L>Our heavenly Sire will bid his image rise</L>

<L>Not so, if truly sings the heaven-born Muse:</L>
<L>And she can tell; for she the limpid fount</L>

<L>Our earth-born ears. Then mark her tale divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ere yet creation was, ere sun and moon</L>
<L>And stars bedeck'd the splendid vault of heaven,</L>
<L>Was God; and God was Mind; and Mind was Beauty,</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="57"/>And Truth, and Form, and Order: For all these</L>
<L>In Mind's profound recess, and union pure</L>
<L>Together dwelt, involv'd, inexplicate.</L>
<L>Then matter (if then matter was) devoid,</L>
<L>Formless, indefinite, and passive lay;</L>
<L>Mysterious Being, in one instant found,</L>
<L>Nor any thing, nor nothing; but at once</L>
<L>Both all and none; none by privation, all</L>
<L>By vast capacity, and pregnant power.</L>
<L>This passive nature th' active Almighty Mind</L>
<L>Deeming fit subject for his art, at once</L>
<L>Expell'd privation, and pour'd forth himself;</L>
<L>Himself pour'd forth thro' all the mighty mass</L>
<L>Of matter, now first bounded. Then was beauty</L>
<L>And truth, and form, and order, all evolv'd,</L>
<L>Was open'd all, that lay enwrapp'd and hid</L>
<L>In the great mind of Godhead. Forth it went,</L>
<L>Forth went the pure quintessence far and wide</L>
<L>Thro' the vast whole; nor did its force not feel</L>
<L>The last of minim atoms. So (great things</L>
<L>It we compare with small) in sable cloud</L>
<L>Invelop'd, lies the lightning: mortal men</L>
<L>Look up, and dread th' event: When, lo! illum'd</L>
<L>All in a moment, the small nitrous seeds</L>
<L>Expanding, fill heaven's mighty vault, and quick</L>
<L>From pole to pole the fiery terror flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus Mind thro' all things pass'd, essence and worth</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="58"/>Giving and limiting to each in bounds</L>
<L>Proportion'd to its kind. To clods and stones</L>
<L>It gave cohesion; to things vegetant</L>
<L>Nutrition, and the power of growth; to brutes,</L>
<L>Sense, appetite, and motion: but to man</L>
<L>All these it gave, and join'd to these the grace,</L>
<L>The chosen grace, of reason, beam divine!</L>
<L>Hence man, allied to all, in all things meets</L>
<L>Congenial being, effluence of mind.</L>
<L>And as the tuneful string spontaneous sounds</L>
<L>The answer to his kindred note; so he</L>
<L>The secret harmony within him feels,</L>
<L>When aught of beauty offers. This the joy,</L>
<L>While verdant plains and grazing herbs we view,</L>
<L>Or ocean's mighty vastness; or the stars,</L>
<L>In midnight silence as along they roll.</L>
<L>Hence to the rapture, while th' harmonious bard</L>
<L>Attunes his vocal song; and hence the joy,</L>
<L>While what the sculptor graves, the painter paints,</L>
<L>And all the pleasing mimickries of art</L>
<L>Strike our accordant minds. Yet chief by far,</L>
<L>Chief is man's joy, when, mixt with human kind</L>
<L>He feels affection melt the social heart;</L>
<L>Feels friendship, love, and all the charities</L>
<L>Of father, son, and brother. Here the pure</L>
<L>Sincere congenial, free from all alloy,</L>

<L>What dearer is than man? say you, who prove</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="59"/>The kindly call, the social sympathy,</L>
<L>What but this call, this social sympathy,</L>

<L>O Gomez! gives thy pelf such bliss? or ye,</L>

<L>Such solid happiness? like giants old,</L>
<L>Ye fight 'gainst Nature, Nature's order spurn,</L>
<L>And would o'erthrow. But she, be well assur'd,</L>
<L>Will baffle all your efforts vain, and plant</L>
<L>Fell daggers in your hearts, terror and guilt,</L>
<L>Heart-burning hate, and dreary black remorse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Rome her last of heroes lost (e'er since</L>
<L>The wretched nurse of Caesars, and of Monks,)</L>
<L>When Brutus, urg'd by faction, and a mob</L>
<L>For basest servitude now ripen'd, sled</L>
<L>From Latian soil, then, to attend her lord,</L>
<L>Fled to the faithful partner of his bed,</L>
<L>The wise, the virtuous Portia. Much she fear'd;</L>
<L>For much she lov'd. He, godlike man, inspir'd</L>
<L>Not with less love, tho' with superior strength</L>
<L>Of reason, thus her anxious thoughts reliev'd:</L>
<L>" O Portia, best of wives, grateful thy sight,</L>
<L>" Grateful thy converse. Yet, whene'er we part,</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="60"/>" (And soon we must) then do not, Portia, thou,</L>
<L>" Like other women, sink; but bravely rouse</L>
<L>" Thy mighty sire's remembrance. His firm deeds</L>
<L>" May steel thy soul to sufferance. Me the fates</L>
<L>" O'er distant seas to hostile arms compel.</L>
<L>" Should we succeed, then is thy lot and mine</L>
<L>" Fortunate virtue; should we fail, 'tis still,</L>
<L>" Still, Portia, virtue: think on that; then turn</L>
<L>" Thy mental eye to every worst event:</L>
<L>" And, by premeditating, learn to bear</L>
<L>" Whate'er befalls of ill. Joys will not come</L>
<L>" The less for this; and each joy unforeseen</L>
<L>" With doubled energy will bless thy soul."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he with balmy words the labouring pain</L>
<L>Within her bosom sooth'd, and she was cheer'd:</L>
<L>Stedfast she travell'd, stedfast she arriv'd</L>
<L>To the sea-brink, where many a vessel lay</L>
<L>With fails expanded, Brutus to receive.</L>
<L>Now were they lodg'd in hospitable house,</L>
<L>The tender scene of their long last farewel:</L>
<L>Yet stedfast still she was; stedfast she saw</L>
<L>The mariners prepare. When lo! by chance</L>
<L>A picture meets her wandering eye. It show'd,</L>
<L>In living lines, brave Hector's last embrace,</L>
<L>When from his weeping long-lov'd spouse he went,</L>
<L>Never to see her more. Ah, Portia! then</L>
<L>Where fled thy courage? where thy stedfast heart?</L>
<L>Thou look'st, thou feel'st: The sad moving scene</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="61"/>Too near resemblance bears. Forth gush thy tears,</L>
<L>Thy spirits sink, thy limbs forget their strength,</L>
<L>And thou forgettest all thy Brutus said.</L>
<L>Yet he forgives—forgives? yet still he loves,</L>
<L>Loves thee, that thou forgettest all he said;</L>
<L>For well he knows the cause: 'twas faithful love,</L>
<L>By faithful love affected, like by like;</L>
<L>Congenial by congenial.—</L>
<L>But thy song</L>
<L>'Tis time, my Muse, to end. This verse, O thou,</L>

<L>HAil, bright-eyed harbinger of sacred light!</L>
<L>Nature, refresh'd, beholds thy cheering ray,</L>
<L>At thy approach the gloomy shades of night,</L>
<L>And all its dreary horrors, pass away:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet not to him, within whose manly breast</L>
<L>Reason, with olive-twined sceptre, sways,</L>
<L>I there in darkness aught that can molest;</L>
<L>But nights serene succeed to virtuous days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unlike that Lucifer whose baleful reign</L>
<L>Excites to every deed of foulest dye,</L>
<L>Repine and Lust, and all the savage train</L>
<L>Retire, abash'd, before thy holy eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With silver hair, bright-flowing in the east,</L>
<L>And ruby-tinctur'd mantle, lightly spread,</L>
<L>With pearl-bestudded girdle bound her vest,</L>
<L>Aurora rises from her coral bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I feel her sweet breath in the balmy gale,</L>
<L>Purging from noxious fumes the humid air,</L>
<L>Shedding fresh odours on the flowery vale,</L>
<L>And genuine roses on the village fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
<L>I see the dappled fleece, her favourite woof,</L>
<L>And golden-fringed clouds adorn the sky,</L>
<L>Skimming with light wing o'er its azure roof,</L>
<L>And softening every object to the eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While yet the mind retains her tranquil ease,</L>
<L>From day's perplexing cares and passions free.</L>
<L>While Nature's charms are best array'd to please,</L>
<L>And Health and Pleasure join in amity,</L>

<LG>
<L>Oft let me rove beneath thy gentle beam,</L>
<L>Ere sultry Phoebus mounts his burning throne,</L>
<L>And to the soaring sky-lark's grateful theme,</L>
<L>In numbers less melodious join my own:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And as I range th' ambrosial fields along,</L>
<L>Or climb the verdant hills unshaded height,</L>
<L>Pause on those blessings that inspire my song,</L>
<L>And gather thence instruction and delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Springs not a blade upon the spacious plain,</L>
<L>Bends not a flower beneath the crystal tear,</L>
<L>Chirps not an insect of the turf in vain;</L>
<L>But Contemplation Wisdom's voice can hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See! yonder feather'd parent, skimming round,</L>
<L>Sudden she darts upon her humble food:</L>
<L>Yet, nobly scorning hunger, spurns the ground,</L>
<L>And soars aloft, to serve her callow brood:</L>

<L>Sweet moralist! to reason-vaunting man</L>
<L>Thy generous lesson teach; oft, in thy place,</L>

<L>He feeds his follies, and neglects his race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What sudden burst of oriental rays</L>
<L>Disturbs the peaceful musings of my breast,</L>
<L>Involves the ample firmament in blaze,</L>
<L>And shoots its glories to the distant west?</L>

<L>How bright the scene! magnificent and large,</L>

<L>Fresh-springing flowrets strew his radiant way,</L>

<LG>
<L>From hill to dale, from grove to verd'rous spring,</L>

<L>FRiendship, how sweet! how comely dost thou seem!</L>

<L>A pleasing dream, where mines of wealth we own;</L>
<L>But, by distress awak'd, we find our comfort flown:</L>

<L>Yet have I read amongst the poets tales</L>

<L>Their love above the love of women rose,</L>

<L>Barometers alike thus rise and fall,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And some there are, I ween, who, like the sun,</L>
<L>Cheer the fair opening bud with friendly gleam;</L>

<L>While from on high the flaming sun displays</L>

<L>The fertile ground is stock'd with plenteous grain?</L>

<L>And waving copses ornament the scene,</L>
<L>Can shades or plenty, or delightful views,</L>
<L>O'er wounded minds the smiles of joy diffuse?</L>
<L>When fond Maria fled her shepherd's arms,</L>

<L>O Night, dark Night! wrapt round with Stygian gloom,</L>
<L>Thy riding-hood opaque! wove by the hands</L>
<L>Of Clotho and of Atropos:—Those hands</L>
<L>That spin my thread of life,—how near its end!</L>
<L>Ah wherefore, silent Goddess, should'st thou thus</L>
<L>Awake my terrors? silence sounds alarms</L>
<L>To me, and darkness dazzles my weak mind.</L>
<L>Hark!—'tis the death-watch!—posts themselves can speak</L>
<L>Death's language!—stop, O stop, insatiate worm,</L>
<L>I feel thy summons; to my fellow-worms</L>
<L>Thou bidst me hasten!—I obey thy call;—</L>
<L>For wherefore should I live?—vain life to me</L>
<L>Is but a tatter'd garment, a patch'd rag,</L>
<L>That ill defends us from the cold of age.</L>
<L>Cramp'd are my faculties, my eyes grow dim,</L>
<L>No music charms my ear, no meats my taste;</L>
<L>The females fly me, and my very wife—</L>
<L>Poor woman!—knows me not.—</L>
<L>Ye flattering, idle vanities of life,</L>
<L>Where are ye flown? the birds, that us'd to sing</L>
<L>Amidst my spreading branches, now forsake</L>
<L>This leafless trunk, and find no shelter there,</L>
<L><PB N="103" REF="105"/>What's life?—what's death? thus coveted and fear'd?—</L>
<L>Life is a fleeting shadow—death's no more:—</L>
<L>Death's a dark lantern; life a candle's end,</L>
<L>Stuck on a save-all, soon to end in stench—</L>
<L>Foh! death's a privy; life the alley green,</L>
<L>That leads to't; where, perchance, from either side</L>
<L>A sweet briar hedge, or shrubs of broader leaf,</L>
<L>And more commodious, breathe their treacherous sweets.</L>
<L>Death follows life, and stops it ere it reach</L>
<L>The topmost spoke of Fortune's envied wheel!—</L>
<L>Wheel!—life's a wheel, and each man is the ass,</L>
<L>That turns it; oft receiving in the end</L>
<L>But water and rank thistles for his pains.</L>
<L>And yet, Lorenzo, if consider'd right,</L>
<L>A life of labour is a life of ease!</L>
<L>Pain is true joy, and want is luxury!</L>
<L>Vain mirth's an opera tune, a tortur'd sigh,</L>
<L>The breath of eunuchs; it dismembers bliss,</L>
<L>Makes man not man, and castrates real joy.</L>
<L>Would you be merry?—seek some charnel-house</L>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MR. WILLIAM COLLINS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. William Collins was born at Chichester in Sussex, in the year 1721: in which city his father was a reputable tradesman. He was admitted a scholar of Winchester college, Feb. 23, 1733. where he spent seven years under the care of the learned Dr. Burton. In the year 1740, in consideration of his merit, he was placed first in the list of those scholars who are elected from Winchester college to New college in Oxford: but no vacancy happening at the latter, he was entered, the same year, a commoner of Queen's college, Ox. and July 29, 1741. was elected a demy, or scholar, of Magdalen college in the same university. At school he began to study poetry and criticism, particularly the latter. The fol∣lowing epigram, made by him while at Win∣chester-school, discovers a genius, and turn of ex∣pression, very rarely to be met with in juvenile compositions.</P>

</LG>
<P>His Latin exercises were never so much admired as his English.—At Oxford he wrote the epistle to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and Oriental eclogues, which were first published in 1742, under the title of Persian eclogues. About the year 1743, he left Oxford, having taken the degree of bachelor of arts, weary of the confinement and uniformity of an academical life; fondly imagining that a man of parts was sure of making his fortune in London; and struck with the name of author and poet, without consulting his friends, he imme∣diately removed to town, and rashly resolved to
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
live by his pen, without undertaking the drudgery of any profession. Here he soon dissipated his small fortune, to compensate for which, he pro∣jected the history of the revival of learning in Italy, under the pontificates of Julius II. and Leo X. His subscription for this work not answering his expectations, he engaged with a bookseller, to translate Aristotle's Poetics, and to illustrate it with a large and regular comment. This scheme also being laid aside, he turn'd his thoughts to dra∣matic poetry, and being intimately acquainted with the manager, resolved to write a tragedy, which however he never executed. In the year 1746 he published his odes; and shortly after went abroad to our army in Flanders, to attend his uncle, colonel Martin, who, dying soon after his arrival, left him a considerable fortune; which however he did not live long to enjoy, for he fell into a nervous disorder, which continued, with but short intervals, till his death, which happened in 1756. and with which disorder his head and intellects were at times affected.</P>
<P>For a man of such an elevated genius, Mr. Collins has wrote but little: his time was chiefly taken up in laying extensive projects, and vast de∣signs, which he never even begun to put in execution.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>We have been favoured with the following ac∣count of Mr. Collins by a gentleman, deservedly eminent in the republic of letters, who knew him intimately well.</P>
<P>Mr. Collins was a man of extensive literature, and of vigorous faculties. He was acquainted not only with the learned tongues, but with the Italian, French, and Spanish languages. He had employed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction, and subjects of fancy; and, by indulging some peculiar habits of thought, was eminently delighted with those flights of imagination which pass the bounds of nature, and to which the mind is reconciled only by a passive acquiescence in popular traditions. He loved fairies, genii, giants, and monsters; he delighted to rove through the meanders of inchant∣ment, to gaze on the magnificence of golden pa∣laces, to repose by the waterfals of Elysian gar∣dens. This was however the character rather of his inclination than his genius, the grandeur of wildness, and the novelty of extravagance, were always desired by him, but were not always at∣tained. But diligence is never wholly lost: if his efforts sometimes caused harshness and obscu∣rity, they likewise produced in happier moments sublimity and splendour. This idea, which he had formed of excellence, led him to oriental fictions, and allegorical imagery; and, perhaps,
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
while he was intent upon description, he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment: his poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire, nor unfurnished with knowledge either of books or life, but somewhat obstructed in its progress, by deviation in quest of mistaken beauties.</P>
<P>His morals were pure, and his opinions pious. In a long continuance of poverty, and long habits of dissipation, it cannot be expected that any cha∣racter should be exactly uniform. There is a degree of want by which the freedom of agency is almost destroyed, and long association with for∣tuitous companions will at last relax the strictness of truth, and abate the fervour of sincerity. That this man, wise and virtuous as he was, passed always unentangled through the snares of life, it would be prejudice and temerity to affirm. But it may be said, that at least he preserved the source of action unpolluted, that his principles were never shaken, that his distinctions of right and wrong were never confounded, and that his faults had nothing of malignity or design, but proceeded from some unexpected pressure, or casual temptation.</P>
<P>The latter part of his life cannot be remembred but with pity and sadness. He languished some years under that depression of mind which en∣chains the faculties without destroying them,
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
and leaves reason the knowledge of right, with∣out the power of pursuing it. These clouds, which he found gathering on his intellects, he endeavoured to disperse by travel, and passed into France, but found himself constrained to yield to his malady, and returned: he was for some time confined in a house of lunatics, and afterwards retired to the care of his sister in Colchester, where death at last came to his relief.</P>
<P>After his return from France, the writer of this character paid him a visit at Islington, where he was waiting for his sister, whom he had directed to meet him: there was then nothing of disorder discernable in his mind by any but himself, but he had then withdrawn from study, and travelled with no other book than an English testament, such as children carry to the school; when his friend took it into his hand, out of curiosity to see what companion a man of letters had chosen, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have but one book," says Collins, "but that is the best."</Q></P>
