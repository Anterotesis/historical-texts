<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is the just Prerogative of true Greatness to be universally admir'd by all; and one so eminently possess'd of it as your Grace, can no more escape the Tribute of our Praise and Admiration, than you can cease to deserve it: Not that 'tis in the Power of any one, or even the Applause of Multitudes, to reach half your Merit, yet may we be al∣low'd, according to the Proportion of our poor Stock, to throw in our Mite; and not be frightned from the Hopes of your Grace's Patronage, by considering the Unwor∣thiness of the Offering; for were none but worthy Offerings made, the Gods themselves wou'd lose their Sacrifice; and they that deserve most our Praise shou'd have it least, because 'tis hardest to give them their Due.</P>
<P>And 'tis impossible, my Lord, this Poem should find Sanctuary any where but in the Umbrage of your Fa∣vour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are so fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a Disappointment to the Publick. to lay at any other's Door, what is so much your Duee And tho' I hit not a <HI>Wildair</HI> for the Humour of the
<PB REF="5"/>
Town in my Play, I may boldly say I have copied the greatest Part of Mankind in the just Admiration of your Grace.</P>
<P>Your particular Art, in appearing free, complaisant and conversible, without quitting a Noble Greatness proper to yourself, makes us at once approach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodness, that makes you stoop to your Inferiors, loses nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we consider your Grace arriv'd at the Height of Greatness, without a mortifying Reflection on the Low∣ness of our own Condition; nor does the World envy the truly Great, who by their Goodness and Affability make Mankind partake of their Felicity.</P>
<P>I may plead Prescription in Excuse of this Presump∣tion, and tell how Poets in all Ages have pretended a Right to lay their Works at some Nobleman's Feet; but I'd rather submit to your Grace's Goodness; for if I have offended, 'tis a Fault of the best kind, and pro∣ceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> SHOULD not trouble my Reader with a Preface, if Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> had taught Man∣ners to <HI>Masks,</HI> Sense to <HI>Beaus,</HI> and Good Nature to <HI>Criticks,</HI> as well as Morality to the Stage; the first are sure to envy what they can't equal, and condemn what they don't understand; the <HI>Beaus</HI> usually take a grea∣ter Liberty with our Sex than they wou'd with their own, because there's no Fear of drawing a Duel upon their Hands; the latter are a Sort of rude splenatick Men, that seldom commend any thing but what they have had a Hand in. These snarling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expressions, which are spoken in 'em Aside by one of the in∣ferior Characters in the Drama; and without considering the Reputation of the Persons in whose Mouths the Language is put, condemn it strait for loose and obscure: Now (with Submission to better Judges) I cannot believe that a Prayer-Book shou'd be put into the Hands of a Woman, whose innate Virtue won't secure her Reputation; nor is it reasonable to expect a Person, whose Inclinations are always forming Projects to the Dishonour of her Husband, shou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the Words of a Psalm. I heartily wish that those that find fault with the Liberty of my Stile, wou'd be pleas'd to set a Pattern to the Town, by retrenching some of their Debaucheries, for Modesty thrives best by Example. Modest Language from the truly Virtuous is expected; I mean such as will neither act ill, nor suffer ill to be acted: It is not enough that <HI>Lucy</HI> says she's honest, in having de∣nied the Brutal Part; who ever thinks Virtue centers in that, has a wrong Notion of it; no, Virtue is a tender Plant, which cannot live in tainted Ground; Virtue is what the Air
<PB REF="7"/>
of Flattery cannot blast, nor the vile sordid Dross of Gain poison; and she that can withstand these two Shocks, may be stil'd truly Virtuous. I ask my Reader's Pardon for my Bluntness, but I hope none of my Sex so qualified will con∣demn me for exposing the Vices of the seeming Religious</P>
<P>I fear there are but too many hit by the Character of Sig∣nora <HI>Pizalta;</HI> I wish, for the sake of the reverse Party, there were fewer, or they better known, since the malicious World are so apt to judge of Peoples Inclinations by the Com∣pany they keep; which is sometimes authentick, but not al∣ways an infallible Rule. I shall say little in Justification of the Play, only desire the Reader to judge impartially, and not condemn it by the Shortness of its Life, since the Season of the Year never promis'd much better Success. It went off with general Applause; and 'tis the Opinion of some of our best Judges, that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors, and a full Town, to have brought me a Sixth Night, there having been worse Plays within this Twelve-month approv'd of.</P>

He hugg'd me at these Words, seem'd transported with the News, and swore that in Intrigues, a Wife was most suitable to his Temper; for, said he, there's neither Children to fa∣ther, nor Honour to repair: and where his Pocket and Liberty are safe, he is contented to venture his Body and Soul,</P>
