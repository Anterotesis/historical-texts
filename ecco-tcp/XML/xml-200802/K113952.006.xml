<LG>
<L>HArk! 'tis the woodlark's note, he feels the sun,</L>
<L>And in full glee his mattins has begun,</L>
<L>With him the linnet and the blackbird vie,</L>
<L>Who sweetest shall salute the summer sky;</L>
<L>From bush to bush the jealousy, like fire,</L>
<L>Seems to enflame the universal choir,</L>
<L>Joint is the chorus, sweet the serenade,</L>
<L>Sweet vocal needs no instrumental aid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now swell the udders of the milky kine,</L>
<L>Now swells the green grape on the tender vine;</L>
<L>Like ripen'd strawberries of red and white</L>
<L>The germinating blossoms charm the sight;</L>
<L>Blended as in the rain-bow, various hues</L>
<L>Of flowers uncounted drink the morning dews;</L>
<L>Acanthus, hyacinth, and crocus meet</L>
<L>To make young June rich sandals for her feet;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<L>With backward pace a sea-crab leads the way,</L>
<L>As if it fled the fond pursuit of May;</L>
<L>But May is gone, and leaves to buxom June</L>
<L>What she had rear'd, with nicer care to prune;</L>
<L>With animating heat to warm the seed,</L>
<L>And of each plant the tender roots to feed.</L>
<L>Thus month to month successive recommends</L>
<L>The growth of Nature to promote her ends;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gives to each other's hands the forming care,</L>
<L>First January binds with nipping air,</L>
<L>Next February lays the earth in snows,</L>
<L>And March restrains them as his tempest blows—</L>
<L>With milder aspect April sends his shower,</L>
<L>And May's warm sun awakes herb, tree and flower,</L>
<L>'Till warmer suns, with brighter June combine</L>
<L>To aid young Nature in her great design.</L>

<L>The glories of its reign.</L>

<L>While yon few sheep enjoy the breeze,</L>

<L>This pipe, which Damon gave, shall raise</L>
<L>Its rural notes to sing thy praise,</L>

<L>Delightful season! every mead</L>

<L>WHere the light cannot pierce, in a grove of tall trees,</L>
<L>With my fair one as blooming as May,</L>
<L>Undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze,</L>
<L>Let me pass the hot noon of the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the sun less intense to the westward inclines,</L>
<L>For the meadows the groves we'll forsake,</L>
<L>And see the rays dance as inverted he shines</L>
<L>On the face of some river or lake.</L>
</LG>

<L>Where my fairest and I, on its verge as we pass,</L>

<L>Our two shadows may view on the watery glass,</L>
<L>While the fish are at play in the stream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May the herds cease to lowe, and the lambkins to bleat,</L>
<L>When she sings me some amorous strain;</L>
<L>All be silent, and husht, unless echo repeat</L>
<L>The kind words, and sweet sounds back again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when we return to our cottage at night,</L>
<L>Hand in hand as we sauntering stray,</L>
<L>Let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light,</L>
<L>Just direct us, and chequer our way.</L>

<L>Let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk,</L>
<L>As thus gently and slowly we move;</L>
<L>And let no single thought be express'd in our talk,</L>
<L>But of friendship improv'd into love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus enchanted each day with these rural delights,</L>
<L>And secure from ambition's alarms,</L>
<L>Soft love and repose shall divide all our nights,</L>

<L>Now scarce a Zephyr fann'd the placid sky,</L>
<L>But all was hush'd—save Philomel and I.</L>

<L>Still hears thee sing, and hears thee sing in vain;</L>
<L>How shall my ruder voice e'er hope to move,</L>
<L>Or charm my gentle Delia into love?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here let me nightly wander in the grove</L>
<L>To court th' idea of my absent love,</L>
<L>With fancy's eye to gaze upon her charms,</L>

<L>Yet, as a woman, who could think her true?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who knows but now, most lavish of her charms,</L>
<L>Loosely she wanton's in some rival's arms,</L>
<L>While, drunk with luscious love, th' intemperate boy</L>
<L>Riots in bliss, and surfeits with the joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Distracting thought! 'tis phrenzy, 'tis despair!</L>
<L>I'll fly this instant to th' abandon'd fair,</L>
<L>Her and her paramour I'll drag to light,</L>
<L>And feast censorious matrons with the sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet stay my heart! whence this tumultuous speed!</L>
<L>My Delia's wrong'd—she's innocence indeed;</L>
<L>She's chaste, she's virtuous, as the vestal flame,</L>

<L>His snowy garments floated in the wind;</L>
<L>A wreathe of mingled flowers adorn'd his head,</L>
<L>Immortal flowers by mold etherial fed,</L>
<L>Graceful he mov'd in youth and beauty's pride,</L>
<L>His cheeks Aurora's opening blushes dy'd,</L>
<L>A flaming torch he bore, approaching now,</L>

<L>Our artist now, elate with pride,</L>
<L>Looks big, and moves with stately stride;</L>
<L>Contracts his brow severe and awing,</L>
<L>A first-rate hand—at devil-drawing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each coxcomb, thus, in nature's spite,</L>
<L>At wit will nibble, wrong or right.</L>
<L>In vain they copy, and they steal,</L>
<L>Their folly still their jests reveal.</L>
<L>They rhime—it pleases foe nor friend;</L>
<L>They next to repartee descend.</L>
<L>'Tis dull—no laughter gains them fame;</L>
<L>They fall to pun—'tis just the same.</L>
<L>Then, tir'd with unsuccessful gleanings</L>
<L>Of wit, they try at double meanings;</L>
<L>In which of humour no more trace is,</L>
<L>Than in our Goblin of the Graces;</L>
<L>Yet see them, all their labours past,</L>
<L>Crown'd with the wish'd success at last,</L>
<L>Proud of their power, with hints obscene,</L>
<L>To give fair modesty the spleen,</L>
<L>To make bawds, whores, and coxcombs snigger,</L>
<L>They strut—no train'd-band cit looks bigger,</L>
<L>While all the good, polite and wise</L>
<L>The pert, dull, graceless apes despise.</L>

<L>DEar Gem, I'll help you to a hint,</L>
<L>Which never yet appear'd in print,</L>
<L>That most infallibly secures</L>
<L>The favour of these dread Reviewers:</L>
<L>First then get paper, pen and ink,</L>
<L>Ne'er take the needless pains to think,</L>
<L>But dip your quill, and write away,</L>
<L>No matter—poem or essay;</L>
<L>Fill up your pages plenius, plenius,</L>
<L>Against all judgment, and all genius;</L>
<L>And soon you'll view, with pleasing look,</L>
<L>Your labour swell'd into a book:</L>
<L>North-British Strahan must be your printer▪</L>
<L>He'll get your work dispatch'd by winter;</L>
<L>And, as he prints Ralph's rough Review,</L>
<L>He'll say the sweetest things of you.</L>
<L>Tho' you, with common sense at strife,</L>
<L>Write dull as Griffiths, or his wife,</L>
<L>This prudent scheme will raise your name,</L>
<L>And fill your purse, and give you fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
<L>But I, whom no such fools can awe,</L>
<L>Who mind not all they say a straw,</L>
<L>Rather than with their praise be cram'd,</L>
<L>Should deem it honour to be damn'd:</L>
<L>For what so keenly ridicules</L>
<L>As the puff flummery of fools?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if their feeble lash you fear,</L>
<L>And will not by this compass steer,</L>
<L>Once more I'll aid you, frank and free,</L>
<L>With counsel, and without a fee:</L>
<L>Exert the whole of your ill-nature,</L>
<L>And invocate the muse of satire;</L>
<L>Prove undeniably at once</L>
<L>Ralph G—s both a knave and dunce:</L>
<L>If you want facts for your behoof,</L>
<L>Ascanius may supply one proof—</L>
<L>Think you that piece too stale and common?</L>
<L>See "memoirs of a pleasurable woman"—</L>
<L>Produce miss Fanny Hill—I'll answer,</L>
<L>She'll die—who? Dame Griffiths of a CANCER.</L>
