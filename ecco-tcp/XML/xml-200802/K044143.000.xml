<HEAD>TO <HI>DAVID GARRICK,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMIDST the regrets I feel for your quitting the Stage, it is peculiarly gratifying, that a Play of <HI>mine</HI> closes your <HI>dramatic</HI> life—It is the highest pleasure to me, that <HI>that</HI> Play, from its success, reflects no disho∣nour on your judgement as a Manager.</P>
<P>Posterity will know, thro' a thousand Channels, that Mr. GARRICK was the ornament of the eighteenth Century, that he possessed the friendship of those whose Names will be the glory of English History, that the first ranks in the kingdom courted his society—may my small voice be heard amongst those who will inform it, that Mr. GARRICK's <HI>Heart</HI> was no less an honour to him, than his <HI>Talents!</HI></P>
<P>Unpatronized by any <HI>name,</HI> I presented myself to you, obscure and unknown. You perceived <HI>dawnings</HI> in my Comedy, which you <HI>nourish'd</HI> and <HI>improved.</HI> With at∣tention, and sollicitude, you <HI>embellish'd,</HI> and presented it to the world<HI>—that</HI> World, which has emulated your ge∣nerosity, and received it with an applause, which fills my heart with most lively gratitude. I perceive how much of this applause I owe to my <HI>Sex.—</HI>The RUNAWAY has a thousand faults, which, if written by a Man, would have incurred the severest lash of Criticism—but the Gallantry of the English Nation is equal to its Wisdom—they be∣held
<PB REF="2"/>
a <HI>Woman</HI> tracing with feeble steps the borders of the Parnaffian Mount—pitying her difficulties (for 'tis a thorny path) they gave their hands for her support, and placed her <HI>high</HI> above her level.</P>
<P>All this, Sir, and whatever may be its consequences, I owe to you. Had you rejected me, when I presented my little RUNAWAY, depressed by the refusal, and all con∣fidence in <HI>myself</HI> destroyed, I should never have pre∣sumed to dip my pen again. It is now my task to con∣vince You and the World, that a generous allowance for a young Writer's faults, is the best encouragement to Ge∣nius—'tis a kindly Soil, in which weak Groundlings are nourish'd, and from which the loftiest Trees draw their strength, and their beauty.</P>
<P>I take my leave of you, Sir, with the warmest wishes for your felicity, and Mrs. GARRICK's—to whose <HI>taste,</HI> and sollicitede for me, I am highly indebted. May your recess from the Stage be attended with all the blessings of retirement and ease—and may the world remember, in its most distant periods, that 'tis to Mr. GARRICK the English Theatre owes its emancipation from grossness, and buffoonery—that to Mr. GARRICK's <HI>Judgement</HI> it is indebted for being the first Stage in Europe, and to his <HI>Talents</HI> for being the delight of the most enlight∣ened and polish'd age.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your most devoted, and obedient humble Servant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<STAGE><HI>Spoken by</HI> MR. BRERETON.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>O The sweet prospect! what a fine Parterre!</L>
<L>Soft buds, sweet flowers, bright tints, and scented air! <STAGE>[Boxes.</STAGE></L>
<L>A Vale, where critic wit spontaneous grows! <STAGE>[Pit.</STAGE></L>
<L>A Hill, which <HI>noise</HI> and <HI>folly</HI> never knows! <STAGE>[Gallery.</STAGE></L>
<L>Let Cits point out green paddocks to their spouses;</L>
<L>To me, no prospect like your crouded houses—</L>
<L>If, as just now, you wear those smiles enchanting;</L>
<L>But, when you frown, my heart you set a panting.</L>
<L>Pray then, for pity, do not frown to-night;</L>
<L>I'll bribe—but how—Oh, now I've hit it—right.</L>
<L>Secrets are pleasant to each child of Eve;</L>
<L>I've one in store, which for your smiles I'll give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O list! a tale it is, not very common;</L>
<L>Our Poet of to-night, in faith's a—Woman,</L>
<L>A woman, too, untutor'd in the School,</L>
<L>Nor Aristotle knows, nor scarce a rule</L>
<L>By which fine writers fabricate their plays,</L>
<L>From sage Menander's, to these modern days:</L>
<L>How she could venture here I am astonish'd;</L>
<L>But 'twas in vain the Mad-cap I admonish'd;</L>
<L>Told her of squeaking cat-calls, hisses, groans,</L>
<L>Off, offs, and ruthless Critics' damning moans.</L>
<L>I'm undismay'd, she cry'd, critics are Men,</L>
<L>And smile on folly from a Woman's pen:</L>
<L>Then 'tis the Ladies' cause, there I'm secure;</L>
<L>Let him who hisses, no soft Nymph endure;</L>
<L>May he who frowns, be frown'd on by his Goddess,</L>
<L>From Pearls, and Brussels Point, to Maids in Boddice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now for a hint of her intended feast:</L>
<L>'Tis rural, playful,—harmless 'tis at least;</L>
<L>Not over-stock'd with repartee or wit,</L>
<L>Tho' here and there <HI>perchance</HI> there is a hit;</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
For she ne'er play'd with bright Apollo's fire,</L>
<L>No Muse invok'd, or heard th' Aönian lyre;</L>
<L>Her Comic Muse—a little blue-ey'd maid,</L>
<L>With cheeks where innocence and health's display'd;</L>
<L>Her 'Pol—in petticoats—a romping Boy,</L>
<L>Whose taste is trap-ball, and a kite his joy:</L>
<L>Her Nursery the study, where she thought,</L>
<L>Fram'd fable, incident, surprise and plot.</L>
<L>From the surrounding hints she caught her plan,</L>
<L>Length'ning the chain from infancy to man:</L>
<L>Tom plagues poor Fan; she sobs, but loves him still;</L>
<L>Kate aims her wit at both, with roguish skill:</L>
<L>Our Painter mark'd those lines—which Nature drew,</L>
<L>Her fancy glow'd, and colour'd them—for you;</L>
<L>A Mother's pencil gave the light and shades,</L>
<L>A Mother's eye thro' each soft scene pervades;</L>
<L>Her Children rose before her flatter'd view,</L>
<L>Hope stretch'd the canvas, whilst her wishes drew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We'll now present you drapery and features,</L>
<L>And warmly hope, you'll like the pretty creatures;</L>
<L>Then Tom shall have his kite, and Fan new dollies,</L>
<L>Till time matures them for <HI>important</HI> follies."</L>

<L>POST haste from Italy arrives my Lover!</L>
<L>Shall I to you, good Friends, my fears discover?</L>
<L>Should Foreign modes his Virtues mar, and mangle,</L>
<L>And <HI>Caro Sposo</HI> prove—Sir <HI>Dingle Dangle;</HI></L>
<L>No sooner <HI>join'd</HI> than <HI>separate</HI> we go,</L>
<L>Abroad—we never shall each other know,</L>
<L>At home—I mope <HI>above—</HI>he'll pick his teeth <HI>below.</HI></L>
<L>In sweet domestic chat we ne'er shall mingle,</L>
<L>And, <HI>wedded</HI> tho' I am, shall still live <HI>single.</HI></L>
<L>However modish, I detest this plan:</L>
<L>For me, no maukish creature, weak, and wan;</L>
<L>He must be <HI>English,</HI> and an <HI>English—</HI>Man.</L>
<L>To Nature, and his Country, false and blind,</L>
<L>Shou'd <HI>Belville</HI> dare to twist his form and mind,</L>
<L>I will discard him—and to Britain true,</L>
<L>A Briton chuse—and, may be, one of <HI>you!</HI></L>
<L>Nay, don't be frighten'd—I am but in jest;</L>
<L>Free Men in Love, or War, should ne'er be press'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you wou'd know my utmost expectation,</L>
<L>'Tis one unspoil'd by <HI>travell'd</HI> Education;</L>
<L>With knowledge, taste, much kindness, and some whim,</L>
<L>Good sense to govern <HI>me—</HI>and let <HI>me</HI> govern him:</L>
<L>Great love of me, must keep his heart from roving;</L>
<L>Then I'll forgive him, if he proves too loving:</L>
<L>If in these times, I shou'd be bless'd by Fate</L>
<L>With such a <HI>Phoenix,</HI> such a matchless Mate,</L>
<L>I will by kindness, and some small discerning,</L>
<L>Take care that <HI>Hymen</HI>'s torch continues burning:</L>
<L>At weddings, now-a-days, the torch thrown down,</L>
<L>Just makes a smoke, then stinks throughout the town!</L>
<L>No married Puritan—I'll follow pleasure,</L>
<L>And ev'n the Fashion—but in mod'rate measure;</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
I will of Op'ra extasies partake,</L>
<L>Tho' I take snuff to keep myself awake;</L>
<L>No rampant Plumes shall o'er my temples play,</L>
<L>Foretelling that my brains will fly away;</L>
<L>Nor from my head shall strange vagaries spring,</L>
<L>To shew the soil can teem with ev'ry thing!</L>
<L>No <HI>fruits, roots, greens,</HI> shall fill the ample space,</L>
<L>A <HI>kitchen-garden,</HI> to adorn my face!</L>
<L>No Rocks shall there be seen, no Windmill, Fountain,</L>
<L>Nor curls like Guns set round, to guard the Mountain!</L>
<L>O learn, ye Fair, if this same madness spreads,</L>
<L>Not to <HI>hold up,</HI> but to <HI>keep down</HI> your heads:</L>
<L>Be not misled by strange fantastic art,</L>
<L>But in your dress let <HI>Nature</HI> take some part;</L>
<L>Her skill alone a lasting pow'r insures,</L>
<L>And best can ornament such charms as <HI>yours.</HI></L>

<P>OH, for the luxury of night-gown and slippers! No jaded hack of Parnassus can be more tired than I am—the roads so dusty, and the sun so hot—'twould be less intolerable riding post in Africa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a wild imagination!—But in the name of Fortune, why are you alone? What have you done with all the College youths?—This is the first vacation you ever came home unaccompanied, and I assure you <HI>we</HI> are quite disappointed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, most unconscionable Woman! Never to be satisfied with conquest—There's poor Lumley shot through by your wicked eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>A notable victory indeed!—however, his name serves to make a figure in the lists of one's conquests, and so you may give him just hope enough to feed his sighs,—but not to encourage his presumption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paragon of generosity!—And what portion of comfort will your Ladyship bestow on Egerton and Fil∣mer, who still hug the chains of the resistless Arabella?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, your catalogue grows in∣teresting—'tis worth while now to enquire for your vouch∣ers—Proofs, George, proofs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the first writes sonnets in your praise, and the last toasts you till he can't see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, excellent!—The Dulcinea of one—and Circe of the other—ha! ha!—to transform him into a beast—I hope you have better love-tokens for the blushing Harriet—How does—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye, Bella—you use me ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sister, you plead guilty, before the charge is exhibited—But tell me, my sweet Harriet, who is this favour'd mortal, of whom you mean to enquire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Brother, I have no enquiries to make; but I imagine my Cousin can inform you whom she meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, doubtless—but you look so offended, Harriet, that I dare not venture the enquiry: ask for Sir Charles Seymour yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seymour! Ho, ho! Very fine truly! <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE> If Seymour be the man, my Sister, set your heart at rest—he is on the point of marriage, <HI>if I am not mistaken,</HI> with a fine blooming Girl, not more than eighteen.—Soft, dove-like eyes—pouting lips—teeth that were, doubtless, made of oriental pearl—a neck—I want a simile now—ivory, wax, alabaster!—no; they won't do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[with an air of pique.]</STAGE>
<P> One would imagine, Bro∣ther, you were drawing the picture of your own Mistress, instead of Sir Charles's, your colours are so warm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine Woman, Harriet, gives warmth to all around her—She is that universal spirit, about which Philosophers talk; the true point of attraction that go∣verns Nature, and controuls the universe of Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heiday, George! Did the charms of Lady Dinah inspire this rhapsody?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charms! What, of that antiquated, senten∣tious, delicate Lady, who bless'd us with her long speeches at dinner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must learn to be more respectful in your epithets, Sir; for that sententious, delicate Lady designs you the honour of becoming your Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Mother! Heaven sorefend—you jest, surely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall judge.—We met her in our late visit to Bath—She renewed her acquaintance with your Father, with whom, in Mrs. Hargrave's life-time, she had been intimate—He invited her to return with us, and she has been here this month—They are frequently
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
closeted together—She has <HI>forty thousand pounds,</HI> and is Sister to an Irish Peer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>She might have been Grandmother to the Peer, by the days she has numbered—But her excessive propri∣ety and decorum overcome me—How can they agree with my father's vociferation, October, and hounds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I assure you, wondrously well—she kisses Jowler, takes Ringwood on her lap, and has, more than once, sipp'd out of your Father's tankard.—Delicacies, Cousin, are easily made to give way, when we have cer∣tain ends to answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and beware of that period, when de∣licacies <HI>must</HI> give way—tremble at the hour, Bella, when you'll rise from the labours of your toilette with no end in view, but the conquest of some Quixote Galant in his grand climacteric—on whom you'll squander more en∣couraging glances, than all the sighs and ardor of two and twenty can extort from you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Memento mori!</HI> Quite a College compliment: you ought rather to have supposed that my power will increase; and that, like Ninon, I might give myself the airs of eighteen at eighty—But here's John coming to summon us to coffee.—Harriet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Harriet—why that pensive air? Give me your hand.</P>

<P>Excuse me—I'll only step and look at my birds, and follow you instantly— <STAGE><HI>[Exeunt</HI> George <HI>and</HI> Bella <HI>playfully.]</HI></STAGE>—"Set your heart at rest, my Sister."—Oh, Brother!—you have robb'd that heart of rest for ever.—Cruel intelligence!—Something has long sat heavy in my bosom—and now the weight is irremoveable—Perfidious Seymour!—yet, of what can I accuse him? He never profess'd to love me—Oh yes, his ardent looks—his sighs—his consusion—his respectful attentions, have a thousand times profess'd the strongest passion—Surely, a man cannot in honour, be exculpated, who by such methods defrauds a Woman of her heart; even tho' the <HI>word</HI> Love should never pass his lips. Yet I ought not to have trusted these seeming proofs—no; I must only blame my own credulity—O partial Nature!—why have you given us hearts so replete with tenderness, and minds so weak, so yielding?</P>

Mr. Hargrave, I wait on you, Sir, to request an apart∣ment for a young Lady of beauty, and honour, who hath put herself under my protecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.—But as I really think my house a dangerous situation for her, considering that I am single, young and handsome, <STAGE>[stroking his face]</STAGE> I cannot in conscience expose her to it.—You, being a grave, orderly man, and having a couple of decent, well∣behaved young women for a Daughter and Niece; I think she will be more agreeably protected here—and this is my business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young Lady who hath put herself under your protection! Who is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her name she wishes to conceal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very odd—Where did you meet with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the house of a Widow Tenant of mine, a few miles from hence, where she had taken refuge from a marriage to which an Uncle would have forced her.—She had no companion but the good old Lady, whom I found employed in assisting her to weep, instead of consoling her.—In short, there were <HI>reasons</HI> to think her situation highly dangerous, and I prevail'd on her to leave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so your credulity is again taken in, and the air of a weeping Beauty is the trap that caught you?—Ha, ha! ha!—Will you never be sick of impositions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember that I was ever imposed on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! don't I know how many people you have plagued yourself about, who had not a grain of me∣rit to deserve it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I want <HI>merit</HI> Mr. Hargrave; yet all the blessings of health and fortune have not been with-held from <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye—there's no getting you to hear rea∣son on this subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis too late to reason now. The young Lady is at my house—I have promised to bring her here, and we must endeavour to raise the poor Girl's spirits. She would have spoil'd the prettiest face in England—beg pardon, Ladies<HI>—one</HI> of the prettiest faces, with weep∣ing at the old Widows.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old Widow, a pretty Girl, a Lover, a tyran∣nical Uncle—'tis a charming group for the amusement of a village circle.—I long to see this Beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her beauty, according to Mr. Drummond, may be conspicuous enough—but her pretensions to <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> seem to be a more doubtful matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, why should we doubt of either? A Lady in such a situation has a right to protec∣tion; <STAGE>[to his Father]</STAGE> and I hope, Sir, you will not with∣hold yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, to be sure, George.—'Sbud! refuse protection to a fine Girl!—'twould be, with you, a crying Sin, I warrant—but Mr. Drummond, I should suppose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, be satisfied, the weaknesses with which you reproach me, might have induced me to have snatched her from an alarming situation without much examination.—But, in compliment to your delicacy, I have made proper enquiries.—She was placed under the care of Mrs. Carlton by a person of credit.—She has dis∣patched a messenger to her Uncle, who, I presume, will be here to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, permit us to wait on the Lady, and conduct her here; I am strongly interested for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis an odd affair—what say you to it, my Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Family seem desirous to receive her, Sir, I am sorry to perceive an impropriety in the request—but I should apprehend that any appearance of encourage∣ment to young Ladies in <HI>disobedience—</HI>particularly when accompanied with the glaring indecorum of an elope∣ment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, very true—'Sbud, Mr. Drummond, how can you encourage such—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I do not mean to encourage, but to restore the young Lady to her family. She seems terrified at the peculiar severity of her Uncle's temper; so we'll put ourselves in form, receive him in full assembly, and divide his anger amongst us.—Your Ladyship, I'm sure, must be happy to render the recovery of the <HI>first false step</HI> as easy as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why aye, my Lady—there can be no harm in that, you know.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir—if you think so, I can have no farther objection.</P>

And there is one—Memory, be faithful to her charms!

<P>No! ha, ha, ha—is it possible?—what style does he talk in? is it flames and darts, or esteem and sentiment?</P>

<P>I don't imagine my good Father thinks of either—her fortune, I presume, is his object; and I shall not venture to hint an objection; for contradiction, you know, only lends him fresh ardor. Where is Seymour and Harriet?</P>

<P>Your Sister is in the drawing-room, and Sir Charles I just now saw in the Orange-walk, with his arms folded thus—and his eyes fixt on a shrub, in the most <HI>penseroso</HI> style you can conceive—Why—he has no appearance of a happy youth on the verge of Bridegroomism.</P>

<P>I believe he never address'd your Sister.</P>
</SP>

<P>Aye, so he pretends, he never made love to her—ridiculous subterfuge!—he stole into her heart by the help of those silent tender observances, which are the surest battery when there's time to play 'em off—If any man had <HI>thus</HI> obtain'd my Sister's heart—left her a prey to disappoint∣ment,
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
and then said<HI>—he meant nothing—</HI>my sword should have faught him, that his conduct was not less dishonourable, than if he had knelt at her feet, and sworn a million oaths.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this might be useful—but, mercy upon us! if every girl had such a snap-dragon of a Brother,—no Beaus—and very few pretty fellows would venture to come near her—pray, when did you form this mischievous design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir Charles has been heaping up the measure of his offences some time—'twould have diverted you to have seen the tricks he play'd to get Harriet's picture—At last he begg'd it, to get the drapery copied for his Sister's; and I know 'tis at this moment in his bosom, tho' he has sworn an hundred times 'tis still at the Painter's.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do mean to plague 'em a little; and it will be the greatest favour we can do them—for they are such sentimental people—you know—that they'll blush, and hesitate, and tor∣ment each other, six months before they can come to an ex∣planation—But, by alarming their jealousy, they'll betray themselves in as many hours.</P>
</SP>

<P>Of what consequence is that to you, child?—never think about it; if you suffer your mind to be soften'd with reflections of that sort, you'll never behave with a proper de∣gree of scorn to him.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, you are quite a Heroine, I perceive—Surely you will not fly to prove your indifference?—Stay and mortify him with an appearance of carelessness and good-humour—For instance: when he appears, look at him with such an unmeaning eye, as one glances over an acquaintance shabbily dress'd at Ranelagh—and when he speaks to you, look another way; and then, suddenly recollecting yourself,—What is that you were saying, Sir Charles? I beg pardon, I really did not attend—then, without minding his answer—Bella, I was thinking of that sweet fellow who open'd the ball with Lady Harriet—Did you ever see such eyes? and then the air with which he danced!—O Lord!

<P>Why—a—I don't know—To be sure there was a kind of a distant intimation—tho' perhaps Sir Charles only means that you are aukward—ha! ha!—But consider, Sir, this character of Harriet's is but lately assumed—and new characters, like new stays, never sit till they have been worn.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, I could almost blame you, Mr. Hargrave—pardon me—but you have certainly been too precipitate—your Son has scarcely been at home four and twenty hours, and cannot possibly have received any impression, or formed an idea of my character.—He has been so much engaged, in∣deed, with other persons, that I have had no opportunity of conversing with him; and how, so circumstanced, can he have form'd a judgment of his own heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good God! Madam, he has given the best proof in the world that he has formed a judgment; for he told me this morning, that the prospect of the marriage made him very happy.—I don't know what other proof a man can give that he knows his own heart—and let me tell you, Madam, I have accustomed my children to pay a proper regard to my inclination.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am apprehensive, Sir, that Mr. George Har∣grave's obedience may influence him more than I cou'd wish—and I assure you, I cannot think of uniting myself to any man, who does not prefer me for my own sake, without ad∣verting to any other consideration.</P>
</SP>

<P>Not understand me, Mr. Hargrave! I have too high an opinion of your good sense, to suppose that I am un∣intelligible to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>My opinion, Madam, is, that an obedient Son is likely to make a kind Husband—George is a fine young fel∣low as any in England, though I his father say it,—and there's not a woman in the kingdom, who might not be proud to call him her husband—too obedient—</P>
</SP>

<P>Bless me! this man has no ideas <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>—You mistake me, Mr. Hargrave; I do not mean to lessen the merit of obedience in your Son—but, I confess, I wish him to have a more delicate, a more tender motive, for offering his hand to me.</P>

<P>And which of 'em would you relinquish in town?</P>

<P>Upon my word, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the business, Child, the business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>The business is, that we must contrive to open some door for this Girl to walk out of the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how—upon what ground—when, and where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if we could contrive the business, I have no doubt of the spirit and fire of your execution.—Do you re∣member the occupation which once gave employment to these talents of yours—I mean that of an itinerant Player?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes—I remember the barns that I have made

echo with the ravings of Orestes, and the stables in which I have sighed forth the woes of Romeo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but have you any recollection of a pretty Juliet—a tall elegant Girl—in short, do you not remember one of the strolling party exceedingly like the strange guest now in the house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum!—Why, what devil sent thee to tempt me this morning?—so I am to sell my honour—my honesty—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Susan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, pho—honesty and honour are sentiments for people whose fortunes are made—let us once be independent, and we'll be as honourable and as honest as the best of 'em—so let's go in, and settle our plan.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well—'tis the fate of great men to be in the hands of Women; and therefore, my sweet Abigail—I am yours.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be you, Bella, who this morning seem'd fearful that I should not treat him with sufficient scorn—now persuading me to allow a private interview to a Man who is professedly the lover of another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>How apprehensive you <HI>very</HI> delicate Ladies are! Why must you suppose he wants to talk to you about love—or on any topic, that his approaching marriage would make improper?</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—what <HI>can</HI> he have to say to me?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>The request I ventured to make by Miss Sidney, Madam, must appear strange to you—the engagements which I—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Renders it an extraordinary request indeed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear'd you would think so, and conscious of those engagements, I shou'd not have presum'd to have made it—but as it's probably the last time I may ever see you—I seize it, to tell you that—I adore you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles! I am astonished,—in my Father's house at least, I should have been secure from such an insult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, I intreat you. Nothing could have forced this declaration from me, but my despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The engagement you talk of, Sir, ought to have prevented <HI>these</HI> effects of your despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge it—and they have kept me silent ever since I arrived—but when I thought of leaving you in a few moments, I sound the idea insupportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The picture you wear, Sir Charles—might console you surely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah—I thought you were ignorant, Madam, of my possessing it.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold! 'tis time now to have mercy. My dear Harriet, allow me to present to you my most valued friend, as the Man whom I shou'd rejoice to see your Husband. To you, my Seymour, I present a Sister, whose heart has no en∣gagements that I am acquainted with, to supersede your claim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am speechless with joy, and with amazement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive the embarrasment I have occasion'd you—you have suffer'd something; but your felicity will be heighten'd from the comparison. My dear Harriet, Seymour has always loved you—the picture which so offended you is a proof, you cannot doubt.</P>

<P>Charming Miss Sydney—I'll never quarrel with your vivacity again.—But why have I been made to suffer thus?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you did not tell me <HI>why</HI> you wanted my Sister's picture—but I have taken a friendly vengeance; my plot has told you more of my Sister's heart in a few hours, than all your sighs and humility, wou'd have obtained in as many months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>For which I thank you—and my present happiness receives a brighter glow from this illusion of misery—I'll fly and pour out my joy and gratitude, at the feet of my charming Harriet.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, stay, stay—we may want your assistance. Here's your Father coming, George. Your repartee to Lady Dinah at dinner, spoilt her digestion—and she's been repre∣senting you—that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope she represented her sneer too, which suffused with tears the loveliest eyes in the world. Could I do less than support h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r against the ill-humour of that antiquated pedant?—By Jupiter, I'll draw her in colours to my Father, that shall make him shrink from the fate he is preparing for himself.</P>

<P>Why, George, how's this?—Dy'e know what you've done?—you've affronted Lady Dinah.</P>

<P>I did not design to affront her, Sir—I only meant to convince her that she shou'd not insult the amiable young Lady, whom Mr. Drummond placed under your protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me—amiable young Lady! How do you know what she is?—on the footing you are with Lady Dinah, let me tell you, if she had insulted an hundred young Ladies, you ought not to have seen it—at least, not resented it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What's</HI> that you say, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, to confess the truth, I am astonish'd at your partiality for that Lady—she is the last woman in the world, whom I could wish to see in the place of my amiable Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Mother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd think it a breach of my duty, to see you plunge yourself into so irretrievable a fate, without acquaint∣ing you with my sentiments—if you saw her in the light I do, Sir—you would think on your wedding day with horror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why—why—are you mad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you wished to keep your engagements a secret, Sir—I am sorry I mention'd the affair, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh—'tis no secret, Sir, I assure you—every body talks of it—for my part, I shall be quite happy in paying my respects to my new Aunt—I have put a coral string in my tambour already, that I may finish it time enough for her first Boy to wear at its christening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Sir—I perceive that you have all that backwardness in obeying me that I expected, and, in order to conceal it, are attempting to throw the affair into ridicule—but I tell you it will not do—I know what I am about, and my commands shall not be disputed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Commands, Sir!—I am quite at a loss—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to prevent further mistakes, I ac∣quaint you, that I design Lady Dinah for your <HI>Wife,</HI> and not your Mother—and moreover, that the marriage shall take place in a very few days. <STAGE>[going.]</STAGE>—And, d'ye hear?—acquaint your pert Cousin, that the coral string will do for <HI>your</HI> first Boy.</P>

<P>What can induce Mr. Hargrave to sacrifice such a fellow as George, to a Lady Dinah?—Preposterous!</P>

<P>Her rank and fortune—and I dread the lengths to which his obstinacy may carry him; he has no more respect for the divinity of Love, than for that of the Aegyptian Apis—Let us find Harriet, and tell her the strange story; she is not the only person, I fear, to whom it will be painful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible that Lady Dinah, in the depth of her wisdom, can imagine such an union proper?</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be sure—and this is the explanation. She is an unprotected, artful girl, who having caught a taste for the life of a fine Lady, thinks the shortest way to gratify her longing, is by gaining the heart of some credulous fool, who'll make her his wife for the sake of her—Beauty.</P>
</SP>

<P>True—That with this view she told her story to Mr. Drummond, who—innocent soul—not seeing her drift, introduced her here, where she attempts to succeed, by play∣ing off her artillery on the gunpowder constitution of George Hargrave, Esq; the younger.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had known it before matters had been carried so far—on a subject of this nature no woman can be affronted with impunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I▪ am careless of her resentment—I will never be her husband—nor husband to any woman, but <HI>her</HI> to whom I have given my vows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah!—have you carried your affair so forward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I have made that enchanting Girl the offer of my heart and hand, and tho' her delicacy forbids her, while our families remain unknown to each other, to give the assent my heart aspires to—yet she allows me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atch hopes, that I would not forfeit to become master of the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's a little of the ardor of youth in this—the ardor of youth, George—however, I will not blame you▪ for twenty years ago, I might have been tempted to enter the lists with you, myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd fear less to meet a Hector in the field—in such a cause the fury of Achilles would inspire me—and I would bear off my lovely prize from amidst the embattled phalanx.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo—I like to see a man romantic in his love, and in his friendships—the virtues of him who is not an enthusiast in those noble passions, will never have strength to rise into fortitude, patriotism, and philanthropy—but here comes your Father, leave us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Drummond—what, I guess your bu∣siness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you do, and I hope you are prepared to hear me with temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll talk to no purpose, for I am fixed, and therefore the temper will signify nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange infatuation! why must George be sacrificed to your ambition?—surely, it may be gratified without tying <HI>him</HI> to your Lady Dinah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>By marrying her yourself—which, till now, I supposed to have been your design—and that wou'd have been sufficiently preposterous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What!—make me a second time the slave of hysterics, longings, and vapours!—no, no, I've got my neck out of the noose—catch it there again if you can—what, her Ladyship is not youthful enough for George, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—but a more forcible objection is the dis∣proportion in their minds—it wou'd not be less reason∣able to expect a new element to be produced between earth and fire, than that felicity shou'd be the result of such a marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">Psha, psha—what, do you suppose the whole world has the same idle notions about love and constancy, and stuff, that you have? D'ye think, if George was to become a widower at five and twenty, <HI>he'd</HI> whine all his life for the loss of his deary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">Not if his deary, as you call her, should be a Lady Dinah; and if you marry him with no other view than to procure him a happy widowhood, I admire the election you have made—but, if she shou'd be like my lost love—my sainted Harriet—my—oh! Hargrave—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">Come, come, I am very sorry I have moved you so—I did not mean to affect you—come, give me your hand—'sbud, if a man has any thing to do with one of you fellows with your fine feelings, he must be as cau∣tious as if he was carrying a candle in a gunpowder barrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">'Tis over, my friend—but when I can hear my Harriet named, without giving my heart a fond re∣gret for what I have lost—reproach me—for then, I shall deserve it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">Well, well—it shall be your own way—but come, let me convince you that you are wrong in this business</P>
<P>—'sbud! I tell you it has been the study of my life to make George a great man—I brought Lady Dinah here with no
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
other design—and now, when I thought the matter was brought to bear—when Lady Dinah had consented—and my Son, as I supposed, eager for the wedding—why!—'tis all a flam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good friend—the motives, from which you wou'd sacrifice your Son's happiness, appear to me so weak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Weak!—why, I tell you, I have provided a wife for George, who will make him, perhaps, one of the first men in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, she would make him a Court Dangler, an attendant on Ministers levees—one whose ambition is to be fostered with the cameleon food of smiles and nods, and who would receive a familiar squeeze with as much rapture as the plaudits of a nation—oh—shame—to transform an independent English Gentleman into such a being!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to cut the argument short—the bar∣gain is struck, and George shall marry Lady Dinah, or never have an acre of my land, that's all.</P>

<P>I am very much surprized, Mr. Drummond—Sir—that I can't be left alone in the discharge of my magis∣terial duties, but must be continually thwarted by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>This interruption, Mr. Justice, is ill-timed, and rather out of rule—I cou'd wish you had chosen ano∣ther opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No opportunity like the present—no time like the present, Sir—you've cause, indeed, to be displeas'd with my not observing rules, when you are continually break∣ing the laws.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! let us hear—what hen-roost robbery have you to lay to my charge now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Sir, you may think to turn it off with a joke, if you please—but for all that, I can prove you to be a bad member of society, for you counteract the wise de∣signs of our legislators, and obstruct the operations of jus∣tice—yes, Sir, you do.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the poacher, whom we committed last night,
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
Mr. Drummond has released, and given money to his family—How can we expect a due observance of our laws, when rascals find encouragement for breaking them?—Shall Lords and Commons in their wisdom assemble in Par∣ment, to make laws about hares and partridges, only to be laughed at? Oh, 'tis abominable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and let me tell you, Mr. Drum∣mond, it is very extraordinary that you will be conti∣nually—</P>

<P>Peace, ye men of justice—I have all the re∣gard to the laws of my country, which it is the duty and interest of every member of society to possess—If the man had been a poacher, he shou'd not have been protected by me—the poor fellow found the hare in his garden, which she had considerably injured.</P>

<P>Ah, there it works—Susan's my own <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>—there can be no reasons—if he had found her in his house, in his bed-chamber—in his bed, and offer'd to touch her—I'd pro∣secute him for poaching.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough has been said already, Mr. Drummond,—or if not, I'll give you one answer for all—I shall never think myself obliged to study the humour of a man, who thinks in such opposition to me; I have a humour of my own, which I am determined to gratify, in seeing George a great man—He shall marry Lady Dinah in two days; and all the fine reasoning in the world, you will see, has

<P>Ah, Sir! my Uncle is in a state of mind ill prepared for yielding—He returned from Spain with eager pleasure to his native country; but the disgust he has conceiv'd for the alteration of manners during his absence, has given him an impatience that you will hardly be able to combat.</P>

<P>I was gone, Sir; but I was robb'd of my Niece on the road—she was taken out of my coach, and carried off—which forced me to return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Carried off!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Sir, carried off by George, whom you have trained to such a knowledge of his duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Stopt on the King's highway, Sir, by the fiery youth, and my Niece dragg'd from my side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What's this right too?—By heaven, it is not to be borne.</P>

<P>Where are they?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What a country am I fallen into! can a per∣son of your age and character approve of so rash and da∣ring—</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let George do what he will—he's sure of his approbation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen—if you are sure Miss Morley is at my house, I am patience itself—she is too rich a prize to be gained without some warfare.</P>

<P>Sir, I am resolved to—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Hargrave! so, Sir!—what, your Son—this new insult deprives me of utterance—but your Son—what is the reason of this complicated outrage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lady Dinah, I am as much enraged as you can be—but he shall fulfill his engagements—de∣pend on it, he shall.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Engagements!—what the young Gentleman was engaged too!—a very fine youth! upon my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[to Mr. Hargrave]</STAGE>
<P> Your honour is concern'd, Sir—and if I was sure he was drawn in by the girl's art, and that he was convinced of the impropriety—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Drawn in by the girl's art!—whatever cause I may have to be offended with my Niece's conduct, Madam, no person shall speak of her with contempt in my presence—I presume, this gentleman's son was engaged to your daugh∣ter, but that's not a sufficient reason for—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daughter! impertinent!—No, Sir, 'twas to <HI>me</HI> that he was engaged—and, but for the arts of your Niece—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To you!—A matrimonial negociation be∣tween that young Fellow and you!—Nay then, 'fore George, I don't wonder at your ill temper—A disap∣pointment in love at <HI>your</HI> time of life must be the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Hargrave, do you suffer me to be thus insulted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Lady, we must bear something from this Gentleman—the mistake we made about his Niece, was a very ugly business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I entreat you, Madam, to retire from a Fa∣mily, to whom, if you suffer me to explain myself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What new insolence is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I would spare you, my Lady, but you will not spare yourself—Blush then, whilst I accuse you of enter∣ing into a base league with your Servants, to blast the re∣putation of an amiable young Lady, and drive her from the protection of Mr. Hargrave's family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! a league with her Servants?</P>
<STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how dare you accuse me of this—Am I to answer for the conduct of my servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>villainy</HI> of your servants is the consequence of those principles with which you have poison'd their minds. Robb'd of their religion, they were left without support—against temptations to which <HI>you,</HI> Madam, have felt, Philosophy opposes its shield in vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">I feel his superiority to my inmost soul—but he shall not see his triumph <STAGE>[aside]</STAGE>—Is it your virtue which prompts you to load me with injuries, to induce Mr. Hargrave to break through every tie of honour—through the most sacred engagements!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P REND="margDots">I have just heard these terms, nearly as much prostituted by your servants, who reproach you with not keeping your engagements to them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Morley, Sir, commanded me to lead her to you—I cannot ask you to pardon a rashness, of which I do not repent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then I shall <HI>make</HI> you, I fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hah—did you really wish to return to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I left Mr. Drummond's, Sir, the moment I knew you were here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's a good girl—I'll remember it. Come, child, the coach is at the door, and we must make speed to retrieve our lost time. But have a care, young Gentleman,—tho' I have pardon'd your extravagance once, a second attempt shall find me prepared for your reception.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Miss Morley consents to go with you, Sir, you have no second attempt to fear. But since this moment is the crisis of our fate, thus I entreat you <STAGE>[kneeling]</STAGE>—you, to whom I have sworn eternal love, to become my wife. Consent, my charming Emily, and every moment of my future life shall thank you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, so, so!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What, without my leave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing!</P>
<STAGE>[All together.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>At such a moment as this, meanly to disguise my sentiments would be unworthy of the woman, to whom you offer such a sacrifice—obtain the consent of those who have a right to dispose of us, and I'll give you my hand at the altar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That you will not, my frank Madam—so no more ceremony, but away.</P>
<STAGE>[seizing her arm, and going off.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And will you go, impenetrable man—I have discovered, Sir, that your Niece is the daughter of Major Morley, who was one of the earliest friends of my youth—He would not have borne the distress she now endures—I will be a father to his orphan Emily, and ensure the fe∣licity of two children, on the point of being sacrificed to the ambition and avarice of those, on whose hearts Nature has graven duties, which they wilfully mispel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir, are you not content with the insults you have offer'd to me and Mr. Hargrave, but you must inter∣fere with this Gentleman in the disposal of his Niece!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What right have you, Sir, to dispose of our Chil∣dren?</P>

<P>Aye, very true, you don't know how to value the authority of a parent.</P>

<SPEAKER>Drum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mistaken Men! into what an abyss of misery—perhaps of guilt, wou'd you plunge them!—they claim from you happiness; and you with-hold it—they shall receive it from me. I will settle the jointur'd land of my Harriet on Miss Morley, and George shall <HI>now</HI> partake that fortune to which I have already made him heir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there's no stopping him—what can these servants have told him, that makes him so warm?—Egad, I'll hear their tale.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit, unperceived by Lady Dinah.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, this is extraordinary friendship indeed! fettle jointur'd lands—I am glad Brother Tom had prudence enough to form such a connection, 'twas seldom he minded the main chance—Honour and a greasy knapsack, running about after ragged colours, instead—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, <HI>I</HI> have served, and I love the profession.—The army is not more the school of honour than of philosophy—A true soldier is a citizen of the world; he considers every man of honour as his brother, and the urbanity of his heart gains his Country <HI>subjects,</HI> whilst his sword only vanquishes her <HI>foes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>M.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you have all this Romance, I don't wonder at your proposal—however, tho' your jointure lands might have been necessary for Major Morly's Daughter—My Niece, Sir, if she marries with my consent, shall be obliged to no man for a fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The insolence of making me witness to this is insupportable—Is this you, Sir, who this very morning paid your vows to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon, Madam, the error of this morning; I imagi∣ned myself paying my devoirs to a Lady who was to become my Mother.</P>

<P>I am here, my Lady—and have just heard a tale of so atrocious a nature from your servants—that I wou'd not, for half my estate, such an affair shou'd have happen'd in my family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you believe the malicious tale?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>Mr. Drummond's arts have then succeeded.</P>

<P><HI>Your</HI> arts have not succeeded, my Lady, and you have <HI>no</HI> chance for a husband now, I believe, unless you prevail on George to run off with <HI>you.</HI></P>

<P>Nothing, dear Sir, can prevent my feeling the most un∣bounded gratitude for the permission—now may I hope, Sir—</P>

<P>Hope, Sir!—Upon my word I don't know what to say, you have somehow contriyed to carry matters to such a length—that asking my consent is become a matter of form.</P>

<P>Upon my soul, I begin to find out, that in some cases one's children should lead.—Come, Sir,—do keep me in countenance, that I mayn't think I yielded too soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>D.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your consent, Sir, is all we want, to become a very joyous circle—let us prevail on you to permit your be∣loved Emily to receive the addresses of my Godson, and you will many happy years hence recollect his boldness on the road, as the most fortunate reneounter of your life: you shall come and live amongst us, and we'll reconcile you to your native country: notwithstanding our ideas of the degeneracy of the times, we shall find room enough to act virtuously, and to enjoy in England, more securely than in any other coun∣try in the world,—the rewards of virtue.</P>

<P>I accept the condition with pleasure.</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, permit me—</P>

<P>The proof I have given of my sentiments, Sir, ad∣mits of no disguise—or, if disguise were necessary, I could not assume it.</P>

<P>May your bliss, my dear George, be as perma∣nent as 'tis great.— <STAGE>[To Hargrave]</STAGE> Allow me, Sir, to seize this propitious moment to ask your consent to a second union—Permit me to entreat Miss Hargrave for her hand, and I'll prove George a vain boaster, when he calls himself the hap∣piest of men.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir Charles, you have chosen a very lucky moment—but there's no moment in which I should not have heard this request with pleasure. Why, Harriet—if we may believe your eyes, you are not very angry with Sir Charles for this request.</P>

<P>A request, Sir, which gives you so much pleasure ought not to give your Harriet pain.</P>
