<HEAD>TO Her Royal Highness THE PRINCESS of <HI>WALES.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Princess of the same Royal Blood to which you are so closely and so happily ally'd, presumes to throw her self at the Feet of YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS for Protection. The Character of that Excellent Lady, as it is deliver'd down to us in History,
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
is very near the same with the Picture I have endeavour'd to draw of her: And if, in the Poetical Colouring, I have aim'd at heightning and improving some of the Features, it was only to make her more worthy of those Illustrious Hands to which I always intended to present her.</P>
<P>As the <HI>British</HI> Nation, in general, is in∣finitely indebted to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, so every particular Person amongst us ought to contribute, according to their several Capacitys and Abilitys, towards the discharging that Publick Ob∣ligation.</P>
<P>We are your Debtors, MADAM, for the Preference You gave us, in chusing to wear the <HI>British</HI> rather than the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown; for giving the Best Daughter to our KING, and the Best Wife to our PRINCE. It is to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS we owe the Security that
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
shall be deliver'd down to our Childrens Children, by a most Hopeful and Beauti∣ful, as well as a Numerous Royal Issue. These are the Bonds of our Civil Duty: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid us under others yet more Sacred and Engaging; I mean, those of Religion. You are not only the Brightest Ornament, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Patroness and Defender of our Holy Faith.</P>
<P>Nor is it <HI>Britain</HI> alone, but the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>t the present and all succeeding Ages, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ho shall bless Your Royal Name for the greatest Example that can be given of a Disinterested Piety and Unshaken Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ancy.</P>
<P>This is what we may certainly reckon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mongst the Benefits YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has confer'd upon us. Tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same time, how partial soever we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay be to our selves, we ought not to be∣lieve
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
You declin'd the First Crown of <HI>Europe</HI> in regard to <HI>Britain</HI> only. No, MADAM, it is in Justice to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS that we must con∣fess, you had more excellent Motives for so great an Action as that was. Since You did it, in Obedience to the Dictates of Rea∣son and Conscience, for the Sake of True Religion, and for the Honour of God. All things that are Great have been offer'd to You, and all things that are Good and Happy, as well in this World as a Better, shall become the Reward of such Exalted Virtue and Piety. The Blessings of our Nation, the Prayers of our Church, with the faithful Service of all good Men, shall wait upon YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS as long as You live. And whenever, for the Punishment of this Land, You shall be taken from us, your Sacred Name shall be dear to Remembrance, and Almighty God, who alone is able, shall bestow upon you the Fulness of Recompence.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Amongst the several Offerings of Duty which are made to You here, be gra∣siously pleas'd to accept of this Unworthy Trifle, which is, with the greatest Re∣pect and lowest Submission, presented to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS by,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HO I have very little Inclination to writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Preface before Works of this nature, yet, upon this parti∣cular Occasion, I cannot but think my self oblig'd to give some short Account of this Play, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> justice to my self, as to a very Learned and Ingenious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man, my Friend, who is dead. The Person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Christ-Church, Oxon:</HI> one whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I could with great pleasure enter into, if it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very well known to the World. As I had the Happiness to be intimately acquainted with him, he often told me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sign'd writing a Tragedy upon the Story of the Lady <HI>Jane Gray;</HI> and if he had liv'd, I should never have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meddling with it my self. But as he dy'd without doing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the beginning of the last Summer I resolv'd to undertake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And indeed the hopes I had of receiving some considerable As¦sistances from the Papers he left behind him, were one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> principal Motives that induc'd me to go about it. These Pa¦pers were in the hands of Mr. <HI>Ducket,</HI> to whom my Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Mr. <HI>Tho. Burnett</HI> was so kind to write and procure 'em for me. The least Return I can make to those Gentlemen is this publick Acknowledgment of their great Civility on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
occasion. I must confess, before those Papers came to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and; I had intirely form'd the Design or Fable of my own Play: And when I came to look 'em over, I found it was very different from that which Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> intended; the Plan of his being drawn after that, which is in Print, of Mr. <HI>Banks:</HI> at least I thought so, by what I could pick out of his Papers, To say the truth, I was a good deal sur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz'd and disappointed at the sight of 'em. I hop'd to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et with great part of the Play written to my hand, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ast the whole Design regularly drawn out. Instead of that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found the quantity of about two Quires of Paper written over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> odd pieces, blotted, interlin'd and confus'd. What was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntain'd in 'em in general, was loose Hints of Sentiments, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> short obscure Sketches of Scenes. But how they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be apply'd, or in what order they were to be rang'd, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld not by any Diligence of mine (and I look'd 'em very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>refully over more than once) come to understand. One <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cene there was, and one only, that seem'd pretty near per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct; in which Lord <HI>Guilford</HI> singly persuades the Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne to take the Crown. From that I borrow'd all that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld, and inserted it in my own third Act. But indeed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>er and Turn of his Fable was so different from mine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I could not take above five and twenty or thirty Lines at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most; and even in those I was oblig'd to make some Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ration. I should have been very glad to have come into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtnership of Reputation with so fine a Writer as Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but in truth his Hints were so short and dark (many 'em mark'd ev'n in Short-Hand) that they were of little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> service to me. They might have serv'd as Indexes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own Memory, and he might have form'd a Play out of
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
'em; but I dare say, no body else could. In one part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Design he seem'd to differ from Mr. <HI>Banks,</HI> whose Tale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> generally design'd to follow; since I observ'd in many of those short Sketches of Scenes he had introduc'd Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> He seem'd to intend her Character Pitiful and inclining to Mercy, but urg'd on to Cruelty by the Rage and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dis∣positions of <HI>Bonner</HI> and <HI>Gardiner.</HI> This Hint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wise taken from the late Bishop of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>the Reformation;</HI> who lays, and I believe very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> horrible Cruelties that were acted at that time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> charge of that Persecuting Spirit by which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then animated, than to the Queen's own natural Disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="5+ letters" DISP="•••••…"/></P>
<P>Many People believ'd, or at least said, that Mr Smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> left a Play very near entire behind him. All that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for, is, that it was not so in fact. I should have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scruple of taking three, four, or even the whole five <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from him; but then I hope I should have had the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to let the World know they were his, and not take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man's Reputation to my self.</P>
<P>This is what I thought necessary to say, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own account, as in regard to the Memory of my Friend.</P>
<P>For the Play, such as it is, I leave it to prosper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can: I have resolv'd never to trouble the World with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publick Apologies for my Writings of this kind, as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been provok'd to it. I shall turn this my young Child out into the World, with no other Provision tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Saying which I remember to have seen before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mrs. <HI>Behn</HI>'s:<Q>Va! mon Enfant prend ta Fortune.</Q></P>

<L>TO night the Noblest Subject swells our Scene,</L>
<L>A Heroine, a Martyr, and a Queen.</L>
<L>And tho the Poet dares not boast this Art,</L>
<L>The very Theme shall something Great impart,</L>
<L>To warm the generous Soul, and touch the tender Heart.</L>
<L>To you, Fair Judges, we the Cause submit;</L>
<L>Your Eyes shall tell us how the Tale is writ.</L>
<L>If your soft Pity waits upon our Woe,</L>
<L>If silent Tears for suff'ring Virtue flow;</L>
<L>Your Grief the Muse's Labour shall confess,</L>
<L>The lively Passions, and the just Distress.</L>
<L>Oh could our Author's Pencil justly paint,</L>
<L>Such as she was in Life, the Beauteous Saint;</L>
<L>Boldly your strict Attention might we claim,</L>
<L>And bid you mark, and copy out the Dame.</L>
<L>No wandring Glance one wanton Thought confess'd,</L>
<L>No guilty Wish influm'd her spotless Breast:</L>
<L>The only Love that warm'd her blooming Youth,</L>
<L>Was, Husband, <HI>England,</HI> Liberty, and T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>.</L>

<L>To his just Care you ev'ry Blessing owe,</L>
<L>Which, or his own, or following Reigns bestow.</L>
<L>Tho his hard Fate a Father's Name deny'd,</L>
<L>To you a Father, he that Loss supply'd.</L>
<L>Then while you view the Royal Lines increase,</L>
<L>And count the Pledges of your future Peace;</L>
<L>From this great Stock while still new Glorys come,</L>
<L>Conquest abroad, and Liberty at home;</L>

<L>Our Beauteous Patriot has not dy'd in vain.</L>

<HEAD>A PROLOGUE to Lady JANE GRAY, sent by an Unknown Hand.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN waking Terrors rouze the guilty Breast,</L>
<L>And satal Visions break the Murd'rer's Rest;</L>
<L>When Vengeance does Ambition's Fate decree,</L>
<L>And Tyrants bleed, to set whole Nations free;</L>
<L>Tho the Muse saddens each distressed Scene,</L>
<L>Unmov'd is ev'ry Breast, and ev'ry Fate serene;</L>
<L>The mournful Lines no tender Heart subdue,</L>
<L>Compassion is to suff'ring Goodness due.</L>
<L>The Poet your Attention begs once more,</L>
<L>T' atone for Characters here drawn before:</L>
<L>No Royal Mistress sighs through ev'ry Page,</L>
<L>And breathes her dying Sorrows on the Stage:</L>
<L>No lovely Fair by soft Persuasion won,</L>
<L>Lays down the Load of Life, when Honour's gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nobly to bear the Changes of our State,</L>
<L>To stand unmov'd against the Storms of Fate,</L>
<L>A brave Contempt of Life, and Grandeur lost;</L>
<L>Such glorious Toils a Female Name can boast.</L>
<L>Our Author draws not Beauty's heavenly Smile,</L>
<L>T' invite our Wishes, and our Hearts beguile.</L>
<L>No soft Enchantments languish in her Eye,</L>
<L>No Blossoms sade, nor sick'ning Roses die:</L>
<L>A nobler Passion ev'ry Breast must move,</L>
<L>Than youthful Raptures, or the Joys of Love.</L>
<L>A Mind unchang'd, superiour to a Crown,</L>
<L>Bravely defies the angry Tyrant's Frown;</L>
<L>The same, if Fortune sinks, or mounts on high,</L>
<L>Or if the World's extended Ruins lie:</L>
<L>With gen'rous Scorn she lays the Scepter down,</L>
<L>Great Souls shine brightest, by Misfortunes shown:</L>
<L>With patient Courage she sustains the Blow,</L>
<L>And triumphs o'er Variety of Woe.</L>
<L>Through ev'ry Scene the sad Distress is new;</L>
<L>How well feign'd Life does represent the true!</L>
<L>Unhappy Age! who views the bloody Stain,</L>
<L>But must with Tears record <HI>Maria</HI>'s Reign?</L>
<L>When Zeal, by Doctrine flatter'd lawless Will,</L>
<L>Instructed by Religion's Voice to kill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>British</HI> Fair! lament in silent Woe,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry Eye with tender Pity flow:</L>
<L>The lovely Form through falling Drops will seem</L>
<L>Like flou'ry Shadows on the silver Stream.</L>
<L>Thus beauty, Heaven's sweet Ornament, shall prove</L>
<L>Enrich'd by Virtue, as ador'd by Love.</L>
<L>Forget your Charms, fond Woman's dear Delight,</L>
<L>The Fops will languish here another Night.</L>
<L>No Conquest from dissembline Smiles we fear,</L>
<L>She only kills, who wounds us with a Tear.</L>
