<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. W. MILLS.</STAGE>
<L>TO Night our comic MUSE the Buskin wears,</L>
<L>And gives her self no small Romantic Airs;</L>
<L>Struts in Heroics, and in pompous Verse,</L>
<L>Does the minutest Incidents rehearse;</L>
<L>In Ridicule's strict Retrospect displays,</L>
<L>The Poetasters of these modern Days:</L>
<L>When the big bellowing Bombast rends our Ears,</L>
<L>Which stript of Sound, quite void of Sense appears:</L>
<L>Or when the Fiddle Faddle Numbers flow,</L>
<L>Serenely dull, Elaborately low:</L>
<L>Either Extreme, when vain Pretenders take,</L>
<L>The Actor suffers for the Author's sake.</L>
<L>The quite tir'd Audience lose whole Hours, yet pay</L>
<L>To go un-pleas'd and un-improv'd away:</L>
<L>This being our Scheme, we hope you will excuse</L>
<L>The wild Excursion of the wanton Muse;</L>
<L>Who out of Frolic wears a mimic Mask,</L>
<L>And sets herself so whimsical a Task:</L>
<L>'Tis meant to please, but if it should offend,</L>
<L>It's very short, and soon will have an End.</L>
