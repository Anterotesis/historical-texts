<HEAD>TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</HEAD>
<L>HOW can the muse with burthen'd pinions soar?</L>
<L>No flow'rs appear among the winter's store.</L>
<L>Remov'd from FORTUNE'S vivifying heat,</L>
<L>Almost within the Frigid Zone of fate.</L>
<L>Can shiv'ring fancy fondly hope to rise,</L>
<L>Through the rough regions of tempestuous skies?</L>
<L>'Tis madness to attempt—yet REASON, proud,</L>
<L>With God-like energy thus cries aloud:</L>
<L>' Let fools the deity of FORTUNE own;</L>
<L>' I view alike a cottage or a throne.</L>
<L>' Intrinsic worth, alone, has charms for me;</L>
<L>' The worth of virtue, and of liberty.</L>
<L>' Rouze, then, nor let an apathy of soul,</L>
<L>' Thy active free-born faculties controul:</L>
<L>' Behold aright the attributes of state;</L>
<L>' They are not always happy, who are great.</L>
<L>' Invoke CONTENT to soothe thy troubled mind,</L>
<L>' CONTENT, the opulence of human kind,</L>
<L>' That like the tuneful herald of the morn,</L>
<L>' When rosy-tinctur'd beams the East adorn,</L>
<L>' From his grass pallat mounts on cow'ring wings,</L>
<L>' And from his height serene—looks down on kings:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>' Then, pleas'd, returns into his humble bed,</L>
<L>' And rests, while sleep from grandeur's couch is fled:</L>
<L>' Such is CONTENT—her sacred aid invoke.—</L>
<L>Sweet, as Orphean lyre, the voice that spoke;</L>
<L>As that could lull the savage herds to rest,</L>
<L>So this can calm the troubles of my breast:</L>
<L>'Tis done—care's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrow'd brow is render'd even,</L>
<L>The call of REASON is the call of Heav'n;</L>
<L>And, now, to justly dedicate those lays,</L>
<L>Which, through the parent-stock, must hope for praise;</L>
<L>From SOUTHERNE'S muse existence must derive,</L>
<L>Must live through him, if they should chance to live.</L>
<L>Shall I for some exalted title seek,</L>
<L>And cringe to fortune, not to merit speak?</L>
<L>No—she disdains a task so meanly low,</L>
<L>In ev'ry shape to flattery a foe:</L>
<L>But where with honest pleasure she can find,</L>
<L>Sense, taste, politeness with good-nature join'd;</L>
<L>There, gladly, will she raise her humble voice,</L>
<L>Nor fears to tell that BOSWELL is her choice.</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW difficult the task of those who aim,</L>
<L>By lays dramatic, to arrive at same;</L>
<L>Who fondly hope 'twill prove a work of ease,</L>
<L>The appetites of all their guests to please?</L>
<L>This vain attempt eludes the nicest care;</L>
<L>For taste's as different as our faces are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SOUTHERNE, whose tender muse could well impart,</L>
<L>The noblest feelings to each melting heart;</L>
<L>And raise, by force divine, for the distress'd,</L>
<L>Grief's tend'rest sympathy in ev'ry breast;</L>
<L>Who wanted but attention to command,</L>
<L>The subject passions with a master hand,</L>
<L>Was forc'd, when he adventur'd on the stage,</L>
<L>To prostitute his genius to the Age;</L>
<L>An Age, remarkable for wit and vice,</L>
<L>When pleasure must be had at any price;</L>
<L>When wounded virtue hung her languid head,</L>
<L>And ev'ry sense of public shame was fled;</L>
<L>When hapless poets, if they wish'd to eat,</L>
<L>Must furnish—tho' regret—a luscious treat.</L>
<L>This sad necessity, even DRYDEN'S muse,</L>
<L>With such immoral pieces could abuse;</L>
<L>In their deformity, his beauties fade,</L>
<L>And all his laurels wither in their shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>But now, when chaster judgment holds the scales,</L>
<L>And taste, with delicacy join'd, prevails,</L>
<L>From ribaldry to rescue virtuous lays,</L>
<L>Must plead some favour, though it reach not praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye CALEDONIAN fair, in whom we find,</L>
<L>Each charm of person, and each grace of mind;</L>
<L>For Virtue's sake, a feeble genius spare,</L>
<L>The cause of Virtue's your peculiar care;</L>
<L>In you it lies to censure, or to save;</L>
<L>To your protection take the ROYAL SLAVE.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Prologue shews the motive of this altera∣tion, it may not be improper to mention, that it was first hinted to the Author by a Noble Personage, who has eminent∣ly distinguished himself in the literary world; and who recol∣lected to have heard Mr. SOUTHERNE declare, in his latter days, that he most heartily regretted his complying with licen∣tious taste, by writing any thing so offensive to modesty, as the comic part of his works; especially that which was so unna∣turally joined to the tragedy of this play.</P>
<P>The Author thinks himself obliged, in gratitude, to acknow∣ledge the very candid reception <HI>his</HI> part of it met with from the polite and judicious audience of EDINBURGH, without one per∣son to recommend it, as he chose to lie concealed; and this ap∣probation is the more extraordinary, as the piece laboured un∣der some lamentable deficiencies in the representation.</P>
<P><HI>Such lines as have been added, to gratify curiosity, are marked thus</HI> (').</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOR.</SPEAKER>
<L>' BLANDFORD, your partial fortune ever smiles,</L>
<L>' Like a kind mistress, lavish of her grace,</L>
<L>' She beams indulgent upon every wish;</L>
<L>' Yet this time, tho' a prince becomes your slave,</L>
<L>' I envy not; but, in the former sale,</L>
<L>' Chance cross'd the strongest purpose of my heart;</L>
<L>' Your lovely prize, the fair Clemene's charms</L>
<L>' Assail'd, and won my soul.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<L>' You love her then.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<L>' Too sure I love her, more than words can speak;</L>
<L>' Each day the passion more enflames my breast,</L>
<L>' And, tho' she wears the sable veil of grief,</L>
<L>' Tho' floods of tears o'erwhelm her starry eyes,</L>
<L>' Such native beauteous innocence appears,</L>
<L>' That thought can find no other theme but her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<L>' Have you reveal'd your passion, told your love?</L>
<L>' Unless some sorrow of unknown import,</L>
<L>' Some mighty woe lies heavy on her heart,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>' Her abject state may win her to your will;</L>
<L>' And then, by shewing how you wish to please,</L>
<L>' Creating gratitude, you'll gain her love.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<L>' My tongue, unpractised in the soothing art,</L>
<L>' But ill befits the tenderness of love:</L>
<L>' My stubborn temper with reluctance bends</L>
<L>' To such soft feelings; and I strive in vain</L>
<L>' To deck persuasion in attractive phrase;</L>
<L>' Besides, I fear some settled care within—</L>
<L>' But, be it as it may, she shall be mine;</L>
<L>' I will luxuriously possess her charms,</L>
<L>' And cure this raging fever of my soul.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<L>You've my consent to try all gentle means;</L>
<L>Humanity obliges me to stand</L>
<L>Her guardian against violence—</L>
<L>' But see, here comes the sordid Buccaneer,</L>
<L>' With a malicious joy upon his brow,</L>
<L>' To boast the merit of his savage trade:</L>
<L>' A wretch as ruthless as the prowling wolf,</L>
<L>' Without one human feeling in his breast;</L>
<L>' Yet vaunts, that, as a Christian, he has right</L>
<L>' To make the most of infidels—he's here.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">' Well, Lieutenant-Governor, I believe I have done my part this trip; I have brought my full number of slaves, and some such as don't come every day; I was hard drove to bring the matter to bear; but Dick Dri∣ver don't go without his errand; so here they are. I
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
' have delivered them; and now, my lads, it is your bu∣siness to make the most of them in your way, as I have done in mine.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">' Your active spirit has serv'd the colony, Cap∣tain, and deserves our thanks.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">' Nay, do you see, for that matter, Governor, I want no complementeering; I serve the colony and myself; I am not one of your what d'ye callum's, that love their country better than themselves; no, no, I plow the deep, my masters, and give chase to Fortune with all the sail I can make; when I clap her aboard, she'll soon strike.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">' There you are right, Captain; Fortune, wo∣man-like, must be close pursu'd, and seldom can resist the brave.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">' True, spring my bowsprit; and so I often told Jack Handspike; he and I were fellow-prentices and mess-mates; as honest a fellow Jack was, as ever knock'd off a can of slip; but he had a damn'd trouble∣some companion call'd Conscience; I bid him shake hands, and part: but I don't know how he wou'd row against wind and tide; and now he plies before the mast, while I command the Charming Peggy—as good a sea-boat as ever swam: but no matter for that, he has his conscience, he! he! he!</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Captain, where are the slaves?—they are long a-coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who is this prince that's fall'n to my lot for our lord Governor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's the devil of a fellow, that I can tell you; a prince every inch of him: you have paid dear enough for him, for all the good he'll do you: I was forc'd to clap him in irons, and did not think the ship safe neither. You are in hostility with the Indians, they say; they threaten you daily: you had best have an eye upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he is son and heir to the great King of An∣gola, a mischievous monarch in those parts; who, by his good will, would never let any of his neighbours be quiet. This son was his General, a plaguy sighting fellow: I have formerly had dealings with him for slaves, which he took prisoners, and have got pretty roundly by him. But the war being at an end, and nothing more to be got by the trade of the country—I made bold to bring the prince along with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could you do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! steal a prince out of his own country? Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas hard indeed—However I did it—You must know this Oroonoko—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that his name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Oroonoko.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oroonoko.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's naturally inquisitive about the men and manners of the white nations; so, because I cou'd give him some accounts of those parts of the world, I grew very much into his 
favour—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'When I made my last voyage, he had quarrell'd with his father about some
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
woman, and grew so damn'd surly, that he wou'd scarce speak to any body; so they desir'd I wou'd get him on board my ship, and try to make him merry;'</Q>
on this I invited him; I could do no less, you know, as he had been a friend to me: I prepar'd my entertainment; so he came in the evening, and brought about twenty friends with him; the punch flew about, and as many of his companions, as I thought would be dangerous, I sent dead drunk on shore—the rest we secur'd; and so you have the Prince Oroonoko.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Plant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad a-mercy, Captain; there you was with him, i'faith.—Such men as you are fit to be employ'd in public affairs: the plantation will thrive by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2 Plant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, industry ought to be encourag'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's nothing to be done without it, boys; I have made my fortune this way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Captain, methinks you have taken a great deal of pains about this Prince Oroonoko; why did you part with him at the rate of common slaves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Lieutenant-Governor, I'll tell you, I did intend to have carried him to England, and to have shewn him there; but I found him troublesome upon my hands; and I am glad to be rid of him at any rate.—I think I hear them coming—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many of these here doom'd to drag a life of slavery, know nothing better; they were born slaves, and only change their masters; but a prince, taught on∣ly to command, betray'd, and sold, my heart drops blood for him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Driv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Governor, here he comes; pray, observe him—<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I did not strip him and his favourite of their finery, because it sets 'em off to the best advantage.</Q></P>

<P>You see, Governor, what a bloody Pagan he is; but I took care none of his followers should be in the same lot with him, for fear they shou'd undertake some desperate action to the danger of the colony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oro.</SPEAKER>
<L>Live still in fear; it is the villain's curse,</L>
<L>And will revenge my chains: fear even me,</L>
<L>Who have no power to hurt thee. Nature abhors,</L>
<L>And drives thee out from the society</L>

<L>I hear you, but I can believe no more:</L>
<L>' 'Tis not the Christian lure of fair-faced smiles,</L>

<L>There was a stranger in my father's court,</L>
<L>Valu'd and honour'd much: he was a white,</L>
<L>The first I ever saw of your complexion:</L>
<L>He chang'd his God for ours, and so grew great;</L>
<L>Of many virtues, and so fam'd in arms,</L>
<L>He still commanded all my father's wars.</L>
<L>I was bred under him. One fatal day,</L>
<L>The armies joining, he before me stept,</L>
<L>Receiving in his breast a poison'd dart</L>
<L>Levell'd at me; he dy'd within my arms.</L>

<L>Back to the court, a happy conqueror,</L>
<L>Humanity oblig'd me to condole</L>
<L>With this sad virgin for a father's loss,</L>
<L>Lost for my safety. I presented her</L>
<L>With all the slaves of battle, to atone</L>
<L>Her father's ghost. But when I saw her face,</L>
<L>And heard her speak, I offer'd up myself</L>
<L>To be the sacrifice. She bow'd, and blush'd;</L>

<L>Inclin'd her heart, and all our talk was love.</L>

<L>Her fatal beauty reach'd my father's ears:</L>
<L>He sent for her to court, where cursed court!</L>
<L>No woman comes, but for his am'rous use.</L>
<L>He raging to possess her, she was forc'd</L>
<L>To own herself my wife. The furious king</L>
<L>Started at incest: but grown desperate,</L>
<L>Not daring to enjoy what he desir'd,</L>
