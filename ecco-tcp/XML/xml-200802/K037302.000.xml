<P>THE FATE OF SPARTA; OR, THE RIVAL KINGS. A TRAGEDY. AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN DRURY-LANE. BY MRS. COWLEY.</P>

<HEAD>TO JOHN COWLEY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN letters were in their insancy, and when knowledge and the arts were groping their way through seemingly impervious mists, some splendid name was necessary to give an author celebrity—hence the custom of DEDICATIONS; hence those f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oods of adula∣tion, which poured from the press, and outraged the feel∣ings of the addresser and the addressed.</P>
<P>But now, when poets and writers of every denomina∣tion, accept patronage only from the public, and when fame is to be obtained only by deserving it, the custom of dedicating can be continued, only, as a medium through which to convey personal respect. It is <HI>delightful</HI> to make an offering to those we love, when that offering has had a value stampt on it, by the voice of the world. Thus THE FATE OF SPARTA wreathed with laurel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, seeks you in the recesses of a counting-house; and whilst you are engaged in supporting our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tional manufactures, and invoking commerce from her di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant abodes, solicits your attention to the MUSES.</P>
<P>When I hinted an intention to address this Tragedy to you, you shrunk from the idea, and desired me to choose a worthier name. My dearest Brother, where shall I
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
turn to find it? THIS shall <HI>not</HI> be an address of adula∣tion, therefore I shall only observe, that those to whom you are known, will acknowledge that I am justified in the choice I have made of a patron; and those who know you not, will do my pride the credit to believe I should not have selected for that patron, a man whose name and whose situation did not reflect honour on me.</P>
<P>There is yet another motive for using my <HI>poetic wand</HI> to call your shade before posterity. As your regard has been one of the chief blessings of my life, I wish those who succeed us to know how much I hold myself indebted to it: I wish my own children and yours to feel the sweet inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uence of our mutual friendship; and as they will carry in their veins the same blood, to cherish in their hearts the same attachment. DEAR Children! who will wan∣der again and again over this page, after the hand which traces it moves no more, after the heart to which it is addressed, hath ceased to beat!</P>
<P>I was going to conclude with this pensive idea, but I recollect that I have not yet mentioned in <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicatory form,</HI> the work dedicated. The following Tragedy then, Sir, is in its fable and events, all invention—except in the conduct of Chelonice, and the scene in the Temple;—and with the circumstance on which <HI>that</HI> is founded, I have taken some liberties. Other deviations from history will strike you, but if I have altered circumstances, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by CHARACTER. Leonidas at Drury-Lane, as in Sparta, is artful, tyrannic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and doats on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aughter. The impetuous and crafty Amphares, who
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
had destroyed Agis, continues his system. Cleombrotus, ambitious and tolerably obstinate, is yet sensible to the merits of his wife. He, though my hero, is not "a faultless monster;"—if the lady should be <HI>too perfect,</HI> I appeal to the grave authority of Plutarch, who I believe is not suspected of writing fictions to compliment women.</P>
<P>Struck with admiration at the slight yet powerful touches, with which that biographist had sketched the cha∣racter of CHELONIS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Life of Agis.</NOTE>, I wondered such a character had never been brought on the Stage, to do honour to her sex;—yet I had joy in reflecting, that this was precisely the age in which it ought to be done, for this age boasted a Mrs. SIDDONS.</P>
<P>How much the FATE OF SPARTA has been indebted to that lady, and to some of the other performers, the public prints bear testimony—and I gratefully record it: because it is a circumstance highly flattering to myself, and be∣cause I wish the present I thus offer you, to be surrounded with every appendage that can make you feel it inesti∣mable.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With the best wishes and affection, I have the honour to be, Your devoted humble servant, H. COWLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>TO ask your favour, we're by custom bound—</L>
<L>Thus Prologue bows before you to the ground.</L>
<L>But interchange of favours, we are told,</L>
<L>Is a choice method to make friendship hold.</L>
<L><HI>My</HI> gift is this;—those chilly wintry nights,</L>
<L>Whilst the frost glitters, and the north wind bites,</L>
<L>I'll waft you to the gentlest summer skies,</L>
<L>Where rose-buds swell, and the soft zephyr flies;</L>
<L>Where the bright sun, with scarce diminish'd ray,</L>
<L>November's month bids charm like florid May;</L>
<L>Where, beneath myrtle shades the lover dies,</L>
<L>Whilst gales, with fragrance fraught, perfume his sighs—</L>
<L>To GREECE I welcome ye from Drury-lane,</L>
<L>Where taste, and arts first rear'd th' immortal fane.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You've heard of Spartan boys, who let young foxes</L>
<L>Feed on their blood, placid as beaus in boxes</L>
<L><HI>Sans</HI> shriek, or groan. You've heard of sable broth</L>
<L>More priz'd than rich ieed creams, and luscious froth;</L>
<L>With many other monstious—noble things,</L>
<L>At which more <HI>naughty</HI> times have had their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings.</L>
<L>But long posterior to that virtuous day,</L>
<L>Th' events were born on which we found our play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="6"/>
<L>Sparta conceiv'd a whim to be polite,</L>
<L>Black broth, and <HI>bosom</HI>'d foxes took their flight;</L>
<L>Then luxury her flood-gates open'd wide,</L>
<L>And fashion onward roll'd its heady tide;</L>
<L>Plain dress and frugal meals soon dropt their yokes,</L>
<L>And GODLIKE SPARTANS—liv'd like other folks;</L>
<L>Turn'd fidlers, brokers, merchants, gamed and betted,</L>
<L>This boasting what he <HI>won—</HI>this what he <HI>netted.</HI></L>
<L>Ladies their Op'ra—Boxers had their stage,</L>
<L>And <HI>Spartan Humphries'</HI> soon became the rage;</L>
<L>Their placemen sinecures could ne'er refuse,</L>
<L><HI>And zeal-infected Lords, at times turn'd Jews.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their Doctors sage then hit upon a plan,</L>
<L>To mend the weak degen'rate creature Man.</L>
<L>They bad two monarchs wear the splendid crown,</L>
<L><HI>Castor and Pollux like—this up—that down? [In another voice</HI></L>
<L>Oh no, they both at once must mount the throne,</L>
<L>And subject slaves, in double slav'ry groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas wise, no doubt—yet this too pass'd away,</L>
<L>But first burst forth the deeds which fill our play.</L>
<L>The ground-work true—a little fancy grant,</L>
<L>Where FACT had in its bounties been but scant.</L>
<L>Poets will fib, all nations have allow'd it;</L>
<L>And ours with blushing terror has avow'd it.</L>
<L>Oh pardon where you can, and if YOU please,</L>
<L>This anxious hour precedes a night of ease.</L>
