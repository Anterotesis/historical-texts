<HEAD>A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>SOƲTH-SEA</HI> Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Debts of the Nation</NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is but too Notorious, That the Debts of the Nation, which, at Her Majesty's happy Acces∣sion to the Throne, were very Great, instead of being lessen'd, were ra∣ther accumulated to an immense Degree, when this present Parliament began their first Session.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Necessity to satisfie them, to restore Publick Cre∣dit.</NOTE>Without invidiously tracing up this Evil to its Causes, either primary or sub∣ordinate, it must be agreed, on all Hands, that there lay a Duty incum∣bent on the Parliament and Ministry to apply to it a speedy Remedy: Without which, Publick Credit must have had such a Fall, as might have drawn after it, if not the Ruin of the State, at least of a vast Number of private Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulties to do it, during the War.</NOTE>When a Man seriously consider'd, That the Nation has, for near Twenty Years, sustain'd the Weight of Two Burdensome expensive Wars, the second of which is yet unfinish'd, and must, of Necessity, be carry'd on with the utmost Vigour; and reflected, besides, that some of the best old Funds were clogg'd with Mort∣gages and Anticipations, and that some New ones had prov'd <HI>Deficient,</HI> there appear'd insuperable Difficulties in satis∣fying Publick Debts: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Removed by the Ministry and Parlia∣ment.</NOTE>But the Wisdom and Skill of the Ministry, and the Ho∣nesty of the Parliament, have surmount∣ed all Obstacles.</P>
<P>The First Step they made, was, like able Physicians, to probe the Wound, and inform themselves of all the Circumstan∣ces of the Evil they undertook to Cure.</P>
<P>Having, by this Means, come to a perfect Knowledge of the Debts of the Nation, and found that they amounted to about Nine Millions Sterling; which 'twas altogether impossible to discharge, whilst the War lasted, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Provision made for the Payment of an Interest on all Publick Debit.</NOTE>They made, how∣ever, Provision for the Payment of the Interest, at the Rate of Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> for ever, redeemable by Parliament: Which, considering the Goodness of the Securi∣ty, and the Exemption of Publick Taxes, may, in Time, prove more advanta∣geous to the respective Creditors, than
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
the actual Payment of the Capital Sum.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantage allow'd to the Proprietors of those Debts, by Incorpora∣ting them, to carry on a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></NOTE>Besides this Provision for the Interest at Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> of all the National Debts, the Parliament readily gave into a Pro∣ject, formed with great Wisdom and Publick Spirit by the Prime Minister, for Incorporating the Proprietors of the said Debts to carry on a <HI>Trade to the South-Seas:</HI> Whereby a further Ad∣vantage will, in all Probibility, accrue to the said Proprietors, and, through their Means, to the Whole Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">We have hi∣therto made War for Ho∣nour's sake.</NOTE>For we may here observe, That hi∣therto we seem to have been Fighting, like <HI>Knight-Errants,</HI> for <HI>Honour's sake,</HI> and to redress Publick Grievances, with∣out any Regard to our private Interest. Thus, instead of making a good Use, ei∣ther of the Necessities and Streights of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> or of the Misfor∣tunes of the Common Enemy, as the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> in the first Case, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the second, have wisely done, we have even neglected the Pur∣suit of those advantageous Conditions on which we enter'd into the Grand Al∣liance, <HI>viz.</HI> That we should remain Masters of such as we should possess our selves of in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> during the Course of the War, to be undertaken for the Recovery of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Domini∣ons.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>On the other Hand, 'tis melancholy to reflect, That <HI>France,</HI> notwithstanding all the Difficulties she has struggled with, notwithstanding those repeated Disgraces that have attended her Arms, and given such terrible Shocks to her Power, has yet got a Handle to compass her main Design, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Engrossing all the Wealth of the</HI> West-Indies: Which, if not prevented, will not only repair all her former Losses, but enable her to arrive at Universal Empire in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlements of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>America.</HI></NOTE>All the World knows, that upon Oc∣casion of taking Possession of <HI>Old-Spain</HI> for King <HI>Philip,</HI> and other specious Pre∣tences, the <HI>French</HI> took also Possession of great Part of <HI>New-Spain:</HI> Pretending to put it into a Posture of Defence; which, indeed, they have done but too well; having, in particular, built a strong Fort at <HI>Calo</HI> that secures the En∣trance to the wealthy City of <HI>Lima</HI>; and they have improved this Possession to the infinite Advantage of <HI>France,</HI> in an open Trade to the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI> directly; a Thing they never attempted before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were uneasie.</NOTE>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> could not without Jealousy and Uneasiness see the Increase of the <HI>French</HI> Trade and Power in <HI>Ame∣rica:</HI> So that, at last, the Chamber of
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Commerce in <HI>Sevil,</HI> made earnest Applica∣tion to King <HI>Philip</HI> to put a Stop to it. That Prince represented to his Grand-Father the absolute Necessity of yielding to the Importunities of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mer∣chants, back'd by the powerfull Sollici∣tations of the Nobility; but the <HI>French</HI> King, who was resolv'd not to abandon the Trade to <HI>America,</HI> contented himself with causing it to be publickly declar'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> That his Subjects should be re∣call'd from the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI>; and that the Trade thither should return to its old proper Channel; and, at the same Time, contrary to this Declaration, that Politick Monarch conniv'd at, if not directed, the sending of several Ships more than usual to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> with Cannon, Mortars, Arms, Ammunition, Officers, Soldiers, and Ingeniers, to put the several Ports of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili</HI> in a Posture of Defence; in order to keep Possession of them by Force, in Case the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should insist on the Re∣moving the <HI>French</HI> from their Settle∣ments on that Coast.</P>
<P>But succeeding Events prevented the further Importunities of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on that Head; and rather favour'd the Designs of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> who made a very politick Use of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Misfortunes. For the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
being routed at <HI>Almenara,</HI> and, soon af∣ter, totally defeated near <HI>Saragossa,</HI> up∣on the Application the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> made to the <HI>French</HI> King for im∣mediate Assistance, it was required from them, That they should give their solemn Consent to the new Treaty of Alliance, then agitating between the Two Crowns, whereby very advantage∣ous Concessions were made to the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> Which, through the desperate Condition of their Affairs, the Grandees were oblig'd to agree to. By this Treaty the <HI>French</HI> retain seve∣ral Forts and Fortifications, and being planted over the whole Kingdom of <HI>Chili,</HI> they have, at this Time, several Ships of Force Trading in those Seas, which come Home with rich Cargoes, from at least 30000 to 200000<HI>l. Ster.</HI> in Silver.</P>
<P>By this Means the <HI>French</HI> have laid a Foundation, not only to keep <HI>Old-Spain</HI> in a perpetual Dependance upon them; by depriving them of that Commerce in which their Riches and Subsistence mainly consist; but also, if not speedily prevented, to supplant all the rest of the World in the Beneficial Trade to <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Spain</HI>; and to encrease the Wealth and Power of <HI>France,</HI> to such a Degree as (which I hinted before) in
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Process of Time, to put that ambitious Crown in a Condition to give Laws to <HI>Europe,</HI> and to revive her lately baffled Project of an <HI>Universal Monarchy.</HI> It is certain, at least, that as the Trade to the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI> is the present Support of our Enemies, so, consequent∣ly, as long as they preserve that Trade, there's little Possibility of bringing this necessary, but expensive War, to a safe and honourable Conclusion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> must be remo∣ved from the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></NOTE>We may therefore lay down this Po∣litical Axiom, or Maxim, that <HI>The</HI> French <HI>must be remov'd from their Settlements in the</HI> Spanish West-Indies, <HI>as the most effectual Means, both to procure a lasting Peace, and to settle the Grand Trade and Wealth of</HI> Europe <HI>on a due Ballance.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wish to do it, but can't; therefore we must under∣take it.</NOTE>Tho' the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have it, undoub∣tedly, in their wishes, yet 'tis beyond Dispute that they are not like ever to have it in their Power to drive the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>South-America.</HI> And as, next to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> we are the most concern'd in that Undertaking, so we ought to exert our utmost Power to accomplish it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This was the main Design in Eresting the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</NOTE>Upon this wise Consideration it was, that the Ministry and Parliament thought fit to incorporate the Proprietors of the Army-Debentures, Navy-Bills, Defici∣ent-Tallies, and other Publick Debts, to
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
carry on a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas:</HI> Which Corporation, when form'd and regulated, will have the largest Stock of any Trading-Company in the whole World; and therefore will be best able, with a Small Contribution of each Pro∣prietor; the concurrent Assistance of the National Shipping and Land-Forces, and other Advantages that shall be Specified in their Charter, to dislodge the <HI>French</HI> from the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI>; or, at least, to make Settlements there; and carry on a Trade most benefical to the said Corpo∣ration, and to the whole <HI>British</HI> Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Underta∣king no new Project.</NOTE>It rather adds to, than derogates from the Honour and Praise due to the Great Genius who brought this Undertaking so near Execution, to observe, that the vast Advantages that will attend its Suc∣cess, are so obvious, that a Project, not unlike this, was form'd above Fourscore Years ago; as appears by a remarkable Speech made by Sir <HI>Benjamin Rudyerd</HI> at a Committee of the Whole House of Commons, in the Parliament 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. about a <HI>West-India-Association,</HI> which was to the Effect following: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Benjamin Rudyerd</HI>'s Speech at a Committee of the Whole House of Commons, 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> 1.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir Dudley Digs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'I do profess, that as my Affection, my Reason and my Judgment, go strongly with the Scope and Drift of
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
this Proposition; so shall a good Part of my poor Fortune, when it comes to Execution.'</P>
<P>'For to my Understanding, there was never propounded, in Parliament, a Design more proper for this Kingdom, nor of more pregnant Advantage to it, whether we consider the nature of our Scituation, or the Quality of our Ene∣my's Forces.'</P>
<P>'As we are an Island, it concerns our very Being to have Store of Ships to defend us, and also our Well-being by their Trade to enrich us.'</P>
<P>'This Association for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> when it shall be regulated and establish'd by Act of Parliament, and thereby se∣cured from the Violence and injury of <HI>any intruding hand,</HI> will certainly give many Men Encouragement and Confi∣dence, voluntarily to bring in large and liberal Contributions towards so <HI>Noble,</HI> so <HI>Profitable</HI> an <HI>Enterprise:</HI> So that, in short time, we shall see many new Ships built, many brave Men employ'd, and enabled for the Service of their Country. None of this Money shall be carried out of the Kingdom, but laid out for Shipping, which is the Defence of it, and bestow'd upon our own Men, who must be fed and maintain'd, tho' they stay at Home. For this
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
we shall reap the Fruit of whatsoever <HI>Benefit, Plantation, Traffick,</HI> or <HI>Purchase</HI> can procure us, besides <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Security.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Now, let us a little consider the Enemy we are to encounter, the King of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whatever was then said of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> may, in the main, be now appli∣ed to the <HI>French</HI> King.</NOTE> <HI>Spain.</HI> They are not his great Territories which make him so power∣ful, and so troublesome to all Chri∣stendom. For it is very well known, that <HI>Spain</HI> it self is but weak in Men, and barren of natural Commodities. As for his other Territories, they lye divided and asunder which is a weak∣ness in it self. Besides, they are held by Force, and maintain'd at an extraor∣dinary Charge. Insomuch, as altho' he be a great King, yet he is like that Gyant, who was said to have a Hundred Hands, but he had 50 Bellies to feed, so that ratably, he had no more Hands than another Man.'</P>
<P>'No, Sir, they are his MINES in the WEST-INDIES, which Minister Fuell to feed his vast <HI>ambitious Desire</HI> of UNIVERSAL MONARCHY: It is the Money he hath from thence, which makes him able to levy, and pay Soldiers in all Places; and to keep an Army continually on foot, ready to in∣vade and indanger his Neighbours.'</P>
<P>'So that we have no other way, but
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
to endeavour to cut him off at Root, and seek to impeach, or to <HI>Supplant</HI> him in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> By part of which Course that Famous Queen, of most Glorious Memory, had heretofore almost brought him on his Knees. And this our Undertaking (if it please God to bless it) must needs effect it sooner, and quicker; the whole Body of the Kingdom being United and concurring in a <HI>perpetual Supply</HI> to this Action; so that he will have no free Time given him to rest.'</P>
<P>'Moreover, this will be a Means not only to save, but to fill his Ma∣jesty's Coffers, enabling the People to give him liberally, and often; the King's Ships will have little to do but to guard the Coasts, for the Sea-War will chiefly be made at the Charge of the Subject. Thus (Sir <HI>Dudley Digs</HI>) I doubt not but that, in a short Time, both King and People shall be safe at Home, and fear'd Abroad. To con∣clude, I shall be very glad to hear any Man make <HI>Objections</HI> against this <HI>De∣sign,</HI> so that he do it with an Intention to retine and perfect the Work; but if any shall speak against it, with a Mind to hinder and destroy it, I must entreat him to pardon me, if I do scarce think him to be a GOOD ENGLISH-MAN.'</P>

to the Security of <HI>Carolina,</HI> there being no other Place from whence they could afterwards be disturb'd, except a small Settlement which the <HI>French</HI> call the <HI>Palissadoes,</HI> about 200 Miles farther into the Country, to the Westward: But some <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Galleons being arriv'd at St. <HI>Au∣gustine</HI>'s Port, before the return of Colonel <HI>Daniel,</HI> Colonel <HI>Moore</HI> was obliged to raise the Blockade, and to re∣turn to his Government by Land, after having Burnt the Ship in which he was come. The Same Letters brought advice, that Six or Eight Frigates of our small Privateers, attack'd a Place call'd <HI>Toulon,</HI> on the Continent, about 10 Leagues from <HI>Carthagena,</HI> which they Took, Plunder'd and Burnt. From thence they sail'd to <HI>Caledonia</HI>; went up the River <HI>Darien,</HI> and in Twelve Days March to the Gold Mines at <HI>Santa Cruz de Cana,</HI> near <HI>Santa Maria.</HI> The 9th Day of their March they fell with∣in an Out-Guard of Ten Men, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had at some Distance from the Place, of whom they took Nine, but the other Escaping gave Notice at the Mines of their approach, whereupon the richest of the Inhabitants retir'd from thence with their Money and Jewels; however, our Party, which

Consisted of about Four Hundred Men being come up, Took the Fort, and possess'd themselves of the Mine, where there remain'd 70 <HI>Negroes,</HI> whom they set to Work, and continued there 21 Days, in which time they got about 80 Pound weight of Gold Dust; they also found several Parcels of Plate, which the Inhabitants had buried at their leaving that Place.

<ITEM>1. The Trade of such Places as we shall Seize and Plant, will, by Degrees, encrease both within it self, and with others; and will open such a Vein of Riches, will return such Wealth, as, in few Years, will make us more than suf∣ficient Amends for the vast Expences we have been at since the Revolution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For it will occasion a great Con∣sumption of our Woollen, Iron, and other Manufactures, as will be hereun∣der specified.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Consequently it will find Work and Employment for Abundance of our Poor, and thereby ease the Parishes of that heavy Burden.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It will advance the Value of Land.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. It will increase our Shipping, and the Number of our Sea Men, in both which the chief and natural Strength of this Nation consists.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="20" REF="21"/>6. Our Settling in <HI>South-America</HI> may open a beneficial Trade for our Planta∣tions in <HI>North-America,</HI> who want a Market for the Over-plus of those Pro∣visions that grow in those Countries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The <HI>South-Sea</HI>-Trade may greatly contribute towards the buoying up and supporting the sinking, and near expi∣ring Royal-<HI>African</HI>-Company, by affor∣ding it an Opportunity of Vending great Numbers of <HI>Negroes</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who, by a Contract with the <HI>Jamaicans,</HI> did formerly buy them at the Rate of 200 Pieces of Eight a-head. As an il∣lustration of this, it may be observ'd, That the chief Motive that engag'd the <HI>French</HI> in the Attempt they made, some Years ago, upon the Islands of <HI>Nevis</HI> and St. <HI>Christopher's,</HI> was the Alluring Booty of the <HI>Negroes</HI> on those Plantations: The <HI>French</HI> King having borrow'd a great Sum from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> upon Condition of Furnishing them with a certain Number of <HI>Negroes,</HI> which he could not have perform'd, but for the successful Invasion of the said Island.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. In the Last Place, though it was not thought consistent with the Honour of the Nation to grant the Pirates of <HI>Madagascar</HI> a Pardon, yet since they have establish'd and form'd themselves into a kind of regular Government, it
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
will not be more dishonourable for the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company to trade with them, than it was for the People of <HI>Italy</HI> to hold a Commerce and friendly Corre∣spondence with the First Founders of Old <HI>Rome,</HI> who were but a Company of Publick Robbers. It may, indeed, be alledg'd, That the <HI>South-Sea</HI>-Corpora∣tion is not allow'd to trade in <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI> which would be an Incroachment on the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; but as the Act of Parliament only limits Places, and not Persons, so the <HI>South-Sea</HI>-Com∣pany may, within the Limitations of the Act, carry on a very beneficial Com∣merce with the <HI>Madagascarians,</HI> who drive themselves a considerable Trade in the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> either in a <HI>Friendly,</HI> or a <HI>Piratical</HI> Manner.</ITEM>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections rais'd against the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade.</NOTE>But tho' common Benefit was the on∣ly View of those that form'd this Pro∣ject: 
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Tho' the Undertaking be Noble, Great, and Advantageous, yet such is the Perversness of Humane Nature; so prone are the Generality of Men to Censure, and find Fault, that 'tis no Wonder this Publick-Spirited Design has met with Contradiction and Opposition; either from a Jealousie and Uneasiness of Tem∣per, almost inseparable from Money'd-Men, or from the Particular Disgusts of some Persons, who, like Waspish and Sullen Patients, reject the most Whole∣some Physick, because they are not pleas'd with the Hand that administers it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First Objecti∣on.</NOTE>In the first Place, it is objected, That, considering what strong Footing the <HI>French</HI> have got in the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> the Attempt to remove them from thence is like to be attended with insu∣parable Difficulties; the rather, because they are in Conjunction with the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> both at Land and Sea: And sup∣posing we could get some Settlement in the Continent of <HI>South-America,</HI> yet while the War lasts, we could Trade with no more of the Country than we possess, unless it be clandestinely; and after the Peace we must expect to have less Trade; whereas the <HI>French</HI> have an open unin∣terrupted Commerce with the whole Country.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer to the First Branch of it.</NOTE>As to the first Branch of this Objecti∣on, I answer, That the Necessity of dri∣ving the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI> being once laid down as a Funda∣mental Maxim, no Difficulties whatso∣over ought to deterr us from the Under∣taking; whereas, on the contrary, the infinite Advantage and Benefit that will attend the Success of the Attempt, ought to be a powerful Incentive to it. We have, in the Course of this War, with our Shipping, and a Handful of Land-Men, compass'd Things of far greater Difficulty; such as the Taking of <HI>Barce∣lona, Gibraltar,</HI> and <HI>Port-Mahon:</HI> And to bring in a fresher Instance, did not Colonel <HI>Nicholson,</HI> with inconsiderable Forces, make himself Master of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI>; which, we may well suppose, was in a better Posture of Defence than several Places in <HI>South-America,</HI> in which the <HI>French</HI> are but newly settled.</P>
<P>Besides, can any Man of common Sense entertain so mean an Opinion of those who made this Project, and have thereby justly merited publick Acknow∣ledgments and Rewards, as to think that they did not foresee, and provide against all Difficulties that might attend it? There's no Doubt to be made, but the Ministry have had all the Lights and
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Informations necessary to carry on so great an Undertaking with Probability of Success: But the <HI>Scheme</HI> they have framed, with the Assistance of several Persons, who are perfectly well acquain∣ted with those Countries, is, and ought to remain an absolute Secret, till all Things be ready for Execution; other∣wise the Enemy might take such Mea∣sures and Precautions as might render the Design abortive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer to the second Branch of the First Objection.</NOTE>To the Second Part of the First Ob∣jection I answer, That by a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> it is not to be understood, that we shall take Possession of some Ports or Places on the West-side of <HI>South-America,</HI> which being to be al∣low'd as our Acquisitions, pursuant to the Treaty of the Grand-Alliance be∣fore-mention'd, We shall possess the same after the Peace is made; and that, from these Places, we shall carry on a Free Trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Natives of <HI>America,</HI> throughout the rest of their Plantations, as the <HI>French</HI> do now. To be sure, to expect such a <HI>Free Trade</HI> would be a fond Conceit: For, as du∣ring the War, the <HI>French,</HI> in Conjun∣ction with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> will certainly endeavour to prevent it; so, after the Peace, <HI>Old-Spain</HI> will not easily consent to it. The same Reasons that induc'd
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
them, notwithstanding their inbred An∣tipathy to the <HI>French,</HI> rather to call the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> to the Throne, than to suffer a Partition of their Monarchy, will, undoubtedly, incline them not to acquiesce in a <HI>Partition of their Direct American</HI> Trade, which, as was hinted before, is the main spring of their Riches, and would, in Effect, be the same with a <HI>Partition of their Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>But the Trade intended to be carried on by the <HI>British</HI> Corporation to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> will be so far from being Prejudicial to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that as we may, with God's Blessing, during the War, deliver them from the intruding <HI>French,</HI> of whom (as I hinted before) they wish themselves to be rid: So, in Time of Peace, our Settlements in the <HI>South-Seas</HI> will rather be an Advantage than a Detriment to <HI>Old-Spain.</HI> This Position may, at first Blush, look like a Paradox: But as 'tis most certain, That there's room enough on the Western-Coast of <HI>South-America</HI> for us to plant and establish a flourishing Trade in, without invading the Property, or inju∣ring the Original Commerce of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>; so, on the other Hand, we may assist them in carrying on the said Trade, by supplying them with what they stand most in need of, for that Purpose,
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
<HI>viz. Negroes</HI>; which we may easily do, with no finall Advantage to our selves; as was before mentioned. By this it appears, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no Reason to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>'d, but rather to re∣joyce at, and favour our Undertaking: Since the Old Treaty of Commerce be∣tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> of which the exclusive Article was with Respect to <HI>New-Spain,</HI> may yet, with Exception only to such Places as we may possess our selves of, during the War, remain entire, after the Peace, notwithstanding our <HI>South Sea</HI>-Trade.</P>
<P>And here we may cursorily take No∣tice, That besides the Concessions made to us by the Treaty of the Grand Al∣liance, of such Places as we shall pos∣sess in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Title to <HI>California.</HI></NOTE>we have also a Right to the great Island of <HI>California,</HI> as having been first Discover'd by our Country-Man Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>: A Title of equal Va∣lidity with any Pretensions of other <HI>European</HI> Princes, or States, to any Part of the <HI>West</HI> or <HI>East-Indies.</HI> And that Island lying to the North-West of <HI>Mexico,</HI> may be of great Advantage to us, towards the carrying on, and im∣provement of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d Objection.</NOTE>In the Second Place, The vast Di∣stance
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
between <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> is alledg'd as a great Obstacle to the Success of this Undertaking: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer'd.</NOTE>But this Objection will appear to be of no Weight, if we consider, That, by the Be∣nefit of our Ports in <HI>Ireland,</HI> we are, as to that Particular, upon a Level with the <HI>French</HI>; and, in several other Re∣spects, we have great Advantages over them, as in the Strength of Shipping; Number of Sea-Men; Ports on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and in our <HI>American</HI> Plantations, particularly in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Objection:</NOTE>A Third Outery has, by some ill de∣signing People, been rais'd against this Project, as if the Parliament intended to pay all National Debts, with the <HI>floating Expectations</HI> of a <HI>precarious South-Sea</HI> Trade: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Confuted.</NOTE> Than which nothing can be more maliciously, or more falsly suggested. For the Parliament has provided an In∣terest of Six <HI>per Cent,</HI> which will be punctually paid, till the Nation be in a Condition to redeem the same, by pay∣ing off the Capital Sum; And the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Corporation, as was hinted before, was erected only as an <HI>Additional</HI> Ad∣vantage, both to the Proprietors of the said Debts; and, through their Means, to the whole Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Objection.</NOTE>But the loudest, most popular, and, indeed, most plausible Clamour against this Undertaking, is the <HI>Cumpulsion</HI> put upon the Proprietors of Publick Debts to subscribe thier Tallies, Debentures, Bills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into this New Company: As if the whole Debt was to be the Stock in Trade; and this Stock was to be em∣ploy'd towards the Dislodging the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First Part of it answer'd.</NOTE>As to the First Part of this Objection, I answer, That, between Man and Man, to force a free Debtor to take an Interest for his Debt, and not receive the Princi∣pal according to Contract, is certainly ve∣ry hard and unjust: But the Case is vast∣ly different between a Private Man and a Nation; for the first may fail, and prove insolvent; the latter never can. It is too visible that the Publick Debts, were too Great to be paid off in any Number of Years, while the Burden of an expensive War lies heavy upon the Nation; and therefore, all that an <HI>Ho∣nest Parliament</HI> and <HI>Wise Ministry</HI> could do, was to secure those Debts, by ascer∣taining them, and putting them into one <HI>Lump,</HI> and by allowing an Interest of Six <HI>per Cent</HI>; that is, as large an Interest as was ever allow'd by Parliament, (except upon extraordinary Emergencies) and
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
One <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than some of those Debts, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Army and Transport-De∣bentures,</HI> had before. So far the <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of the Nation are clear and unblemish'd.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Parliament and Ministry, upon a Contemplation of the absolute Necessity of Removing the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>South-America,</HI> in Order to attain a Safe, Honourable, and Lasting Peace; and of the other great Advan∣tages (before-mention'd) that will result from a <HI>South-Sea Trade,</HI> resolv'd to erect a Company for that Purpose; and thereupon <HI>incorporated</HI> the Proprietors of the Publick Debts, who, by reason of their large Stock, are, certainly, the most able to carry on this Undertaking with Probability of Success. Now, if ever <HI>Compulsion</HI> can be justify'd, (and no Government can subsist without it) it is certainly in a Case not only of Necessity, but Visible Benefit. The Forcing there∣fore the Proprietors of Publick Debts, that is, a Multitude of Persons of different Humours, Interests, and Views, to agree and meet in one Common Center, <HI>viz.</HI> the Publick Good, and their own Pri∣vate Advantage, is certainly a very happy and commendable Violence. Not but that such a Compulsion may occasion Incon∣veniences to several particular Persons:
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
But as <HI>Salus Populi Suprema Lex,</HI> so <HI>Private, ought to yield to Publick Consi∣derations.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Branch of the Fourth Objection an∣swer'd.</NOTE>The Second Branch of the Fourth Objection is grounded either upon a Mistake, or a false Suggestion: For the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company is not to make War, and endeavour to dislodge the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> at their own Sole Cost and Expence; but only with the Assistance of the National-Navy, and Land-Forces, as will be Specified in their Charter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5th Objection.</NOTE>From the Fourth there arises a Fifth Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Call for the Fishery being limited to Twenty Shil∣lings upon every Hundred Pound, and the Calls for the <HI>South-Sea Trade</HI> left Un∣stinted and Discretionary, the Proprietors of the Publick Debts are justly appre∣hensive, that great Sums of Money will be call'd in, for carrying on the said Undertaking, which has hitherto kept many of the said Proprietors from Subscribing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer'd.</NOTE>To this I answer, First, That the Company shall be at no further Charge, than shall be thought necessary for their own Benefit and Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"/>Secondly, That their Capital-Stock be∣ing near Ten Millions Sterling, a Call of Five Pound upon very Hundred Pound will raise near 500000<HI>l.</HI> a Sum much greater than the Capital Joint-Stock with which the <HI>French</HI> King, his Grand-Son, and the Subjects of the Two respective Crowns, undertook and have Settled the Trade to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and which was only of Six Millions of <HI>French</HI> Livers, that is about 400000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That, according to Her Ma∣jesty's Charter, all the several Calls towards the <HI>South-Sea Trade</HI> are not to exceed Ten Pound upon every Hundred Pound.</P>
<P>Fourthly, And in the last Place, That the Company being under the Conduct and Management of a Governor and Di∣rectors, who shall have the largest Share in the Adventure, and consequently be most concern'd in the Prosperity of the Whole; there's no Doubt to be made that, if after such Tryals as are Neces∣sary to be made in all great and difficult Undertakings, they find that the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade will turn to no Account, they will fairly throw it up; and sit down contented with an Interest of Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> for their Capital-Stock, till
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
the Parliament is in a Condition, and thinks fit to redeem it: For the Compa∣ny is only <HI>empower'd,</HI> and <HI>not compell'd</HI> to trade, exclusive of all others, to the South-Seas; which is so far from being a Hardship, that it really is, as it was meant, a distinguishing Favour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">False Report about the Subscription.</NOTE>And here we may take Notice of a false Report, broach'd either through Mistake, or a Sinister Design, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Fourth Part of the Subscription into this Company was to be made in ready Money; which, being inserted in one of the Publick Foreign Prints of the best Credit, has undoubtedly hindred ma∣ny Foreigners, who are Proprietors of Army-Debentures, or other Publick Debts, from Subscribing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notwithstan∣ding all Dif∣ficulties Four Millions were subscrib'd in Three Weeks</NOTE>But notwithstanding these false Re∣ports, and Surmizes; notwithstanding the malicious Endeavours, and discou∣raging Suggestions of some <HI>disgusted,</HI> on <HI>ill-designing Persons</HI>; notwithstanding all the great Trouble that has, unavoi∣dably, attended the Subscription; such as the Examining the Title, and casting up the broken Sums of every particular Bill, and Debenture, and other Diffi∣culties, yet 'tis very remarkable, That in the few Days the Books were open, which did not exceed Three Weeks, near Four Millions were Subscrib'd.
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Millions more ready to be subscrib'd.</NOTE>To this if we add above Two Milli∣ons, that are to be Subscrib'd for the Use of the Publick; but which can∣not be done till the Accounts of the several Offices are made up, it may be computed, that above Six Millions are as good as Subscrib'd; and the greatest Part of the Three Millions and a Half remaining would have also come in, had it not been for the Uncertainty of the Time, when the <HI>Transferr-Books</HI> will be open'd, which cannot be before the <HI>CHARTER</HI> of this Corporation has pass'd the <HI>Seals</HI>; and the Remote∣ness from <HI>Great Britain</HI> of several Pro∣prietors of the <HI>Publick Debts,</HI> who could not have Time to send Orders to their Correspondents, while the Subscription-Books were open'd: <NOTE PLACE="marg">This great Undertaking brought so near Perfecti∣on, one of the Wonders of this glorious Reign.</NOTE>So that, the Bringing so great an Un∣dertaking so near Perfection, in so short a Time, may well be reckon'd among the Wonders of Her Majesty's glorious Reign.</P>
<P>To conclude, Some Doubts that have arisen, about some Clauses in the Act of Parliament, for the erecting the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Corporation, have fill'd the Minds of some of the Proprietors of the Publick Debts with ill-grounded jealousies; which may also have put some stop to the <HI>Subscription.</HI> But, as
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
'tis next to impossible. That an Act of so vast <HI>Magnitude</HI>; so comprehensive of <HI>Publick Ends</HI> and <HI>Private Details,</HI> the Framing of which seem'd to re∣quire whole Years; and which, never∣theless, was necessarily to be perfected in few Days, should be altogether without <HI>Flaws:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Any Defects in the Act of Parliament will be recti∣fy'd.</NOTE>So any Defects that may appear to be in it, will be rectify'd, pursuant to the Intent of the said Act.</P>
