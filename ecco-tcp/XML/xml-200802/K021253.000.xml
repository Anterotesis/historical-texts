<HEAD>PROLOGUE. SPOKEN BY MR. REDDISH.</HEAD>
<L>CRITICS, hark forward! noble game and new;</L>
<L>A fine West Indian started full in view:</L>
<L>Hot as the soil, the clime, which gave him birth,</L>
<L>You'll run him on a burning scent to earth;</L>
<L>Yet don't devour him in his hiding place,</L>
<L>Bag him, he'll serve you for another chace;</L>
<L>For sure that country has no feeble claim,</L>
<L>Which swells your commerce, and supports your fame.</L>
<L>And in this humble sketch, we hope you'll find,</L>
<L>Some emanations of a noble mind;</L>
<L>Some little touches, which, tho' void of art,</L>
<L>May find perhaps their way into the heart.</L>
<L>Another hero your excuse implores,</L>
<L>Sent by your sister kingdom to your shores;</L>
<L>Doom'd by Religion's too severe command,</L>
<L>To fight for bread against his native land:</L>
<L>A brave, unthinking, animated rogue,</L>
<L>With here and there a touch upon the brogue;</L>
<L>Laugh, but despise him not, for on his lip</L>
<L>His errors lie; his heart can never trip.</L>
<L>Others there are——but may we not prevail</L>
<L>To let the gentry tell their own plain tale?</L>
<L>Shall they come in? They'll please you, if they can;</L>
<L>If not, condemn the bard——but spare the <HI>Man.</HI></L>
<L>For speak, think, act, or write in angry times,</L>
<L>A wish to please is made the worst of crimes;</L>
<L>Dire slander now with black envenom'd dart,</L>
<L>Stands ever arm'd to stab you to the heart.</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>Rouse, Britons, rouse, for honour of your isle,</L>
<L>Your old good humour; and be seen to smile.</L>
<L>You say we write not like our fathers—true,</L>
<L>Nor were our fathers half so strict as you,</L>
<L>Damn'd not each error of the poets pen,</L>
<L>But judging man, remember'd they were men.</L>
<L>Aw'd into silence by the times abuse,</L>
<L>Sleeps many a wise, and many a witty muse;</L>
<L>We that for mere experiment come out,</L>
<L>Are but the light arm'd rangers on the scout:</L>
<L>High on Parnassus' lofty summit stands</L>
<L>The immortal camp; there lie the chosen bands!</L>
<L>But give fair quarter to us puny elves,</L>
<L>The giants then will sally forth themselves;</L>
<L>With wit's sharp weapons vindicate the age,</L>
<L>And drive ev'n <HI>Arthur's</HI> magic from the <HI>Stage.</HI></L>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I. A MERCHANT's COMPTING HOUSE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>In an inner room, set off by glass doors, are discovered several clerks, employed at their desks. A writing table in the front room. <HI>STOCKWELL</HI> is discovered reading a letter; <HI>STUKELY</HI> comes gently out of the back room, and observes him some time before he speaks.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>HE seems disordered: some thing in that letter; and I'm afraid of an unpleasant sort. He has many ventures of great account at sea; a ship richly freighted for Barcelona; another for Lisbon; and others expected from Cadiz of still greater value. Besides these, I know he has many deep concerns in foreign bottoms, and under-writings to a vast amount. I'll accost him. Sir! Mr. Stockwell!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stukely!—Well, have you ship'd the cloths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir; here's the bill of lading, and copy of the invoice: the assortments are all compared: Mr. Traffick will give you the policy upon Change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very well; lay these papers by; and no more of business for a while. Shut the door Stukely; I have had long proof of your friendship and fidelity to me; a
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
matter of most intimate concern lies on my mind, and, 'twill be a sensible relief to unbosom myself to you; I have just now been informed of the arrival of the young West Indian, I have so long been expecting; you know who I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; Mr. Belcour, the young gentleman, who inherited old Belcour's great estates in Jamaica.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, not so loud; come a little nearer this way. This Belcour is now in London; part of his baggage is already arrived; and I expect him every minute. Is it to be wonder'd at, if his coming throws me into some agitation, when I tell you, Stukely, he is my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your son</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, my only son; early in life I accompanied his grandfather to Jamaica as his clerk; he had an only daughter, somewhat older than myself; the mother of this gentleman; it was my chance (call it good or ill) to engage her affections: and, as the inferiority of my condition made it hopeless to expect her father's con∣sent; her fondness provided an expedient, and we were privately married; the issue of that concealed engage∣ment is, as I have told you, this Belcour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That event, surely, discovered your connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear. Not many days after our marriage old Belcour set out for England; and, during his abode here, my wife was, with great secresy, delivered of this son. Fruitful in expedients to disguise her situation, without parting from her infant, she contrived to have it laid and received at her door as a foundling. After some time her father returned, having left me here; in one of those favourable moments, that decide the for∣tunes of prosperous men, this child was introduced; from that instant, he treated him as his own, gave him his name, and brought him up in his family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you never reveal this secret, either to old Belcour, or your son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUCKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therein you surprise me; a merchant of your emi∣nence, and a member of the British parliament, might surely aspire without offence to the daughter of a planter. In this case too, natural affection would prompt to a discovery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your remark is obvious; nor could I have persisted in this painful silence, but in obedience to the dying in∣junctions of a beloved wife. The letter, you found me reading, conveyed those injunctions to me; it was dic∣tated in her last illness, and almost in the article of death; (you'll spare me the recital of it) she there con∣jures me, in terms as solemn, as they are affecting, never to reveal the secret of our marriage, or withdraw my son, while her father surviv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But on what motives did your unhappy lady found these injunctions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Principally, I believe, from apprehension on my ac∣count, lest old Belcour, on whom at her decease I wholly depended, should withdraw his protection: in part from consideration of his repose, as well knowing the discovery would deeply affect his spirit, which was haughty, vehement, and unforgiving: and lastly, in re∣gard to the interest of her infant, whom he had warmly adopted; and for whom, in case of a discovery, every thing was to be dreaded from his resentment. And, indeed, though the alteration in my condition might. have justified me in discovering myself, yet I always thought my son safer in trusting to the caprice than to the justice of his grand-father. My judgment has not suffered by the event; old Belcour is dead, and has be∣queathed his whole estate to him we are speaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>STUCKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then you are no longer bound to secrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but before I publickly reveal myself, I could wish to make some experiment of my son's disposition; this can be only done by letting his spirit take its course without restraint; by these means, I think I shall dis∣cover much more of his real character under the title of his merchant, than I should under that of his father.</P>

<P>No, Lord love him; no, not he: let me see; there's two green monkies, a pair of grey parrots, a Jamaica sow and pigs, and a Mangrove dog; that's all.</P>

<P>I wish to my heart you had but seen the loads of trunks, boxes, and portmanteaus he has sent hither. An ambassador's baggage, with all the smuggled goods of his family, does not exceed it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HOUSEKEEPER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine pickle he'll put the house into: had he been master's own son, and a Christian Englishman, there cou'd not be more rout than there is about this Creolian, as they call 'em.</P>

<P>He writes at his ease; for he's unconscious to whom his letter is addressed; but what a palpitation does it throw my heart into; a father's heart! 'Tis an affecting inter∣view; when my eyes meet a son, whom yet they never saw, where shall I find constancy to support it? Should he resemble his mother, I am overthrown. All the let∣ters I have had from him, (for I industriously drew him into a correspondence with me) bespeak him of quick and ready understanding. All the reports I ever recieved, give me favourable impressions of his character; wild, perhaps, as the manner of his country is, but, I trust, not frantic or unprincipled.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you heartily, good Mr. Stockwell; you and I have long conversed at a distance; now we are met, and the pleasure this meeting gives me, amply compensates for the perils I have run through in accomplishing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What perils, Mr. Belcour? I could not have thought you would have met a bad passage at this time o'year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor did we: courier like, we came posting to your shores, upon the pinions of the swiftest gales that ever blew; 'tis upon English ground all my difficulties have arisen; 'tis the passage from the river-side I complain of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, indeed! What obstructions can you have met between this and the river-side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innumerable! Your town's as full of defiles as the Island of Corsica; and, I believe, they are as obstinately defended: so much hurry, bustle, and confusion, on your quays; so many sugar-casks, porter-butts, and com∣mon council-men, in your streets; that, unless a man marched with artillery in his front, 'tis more than the la∣bout of a Hercules can effect to make any tolerable way through your town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you have been so incommoded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith 'twas all my own fault; accustomed to a land of slaves, and, out of patience with the whole tribe of custom-house extortioners, boat-men, tide-waiters, and water-bailiffs, that beset me on all sides, worse than a
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
swarm of musquetoes, I proceeded a little too roughly to brush them away with my rattan; the sturdy rogues took this in dudgeon, and beginning to rebel, the mob chose different sides, and a furious scuffle ensued; in the course of which, my person and apparel suffered so much, that I was obliged to step into the first tavern to refit, before I could make my approaches in any decent trim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>All without is as I wish; dear Nature add the rest, and I am happy <STAGE>aside</STAGE> Well, Mr. Belcour, 'tis a rough sample you have had of my countrymen's spirit; but, I trust, you'll not think the worse of them for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, not at all; I like 'em the better; was I only a visitor, I might, perhaps, wish them a little more tractable; but, as a fellow subject, and a sharer in their freedom, I applaud their spirit, though I feel the effects of it in every bone in my skin.</P>

<P>Well, Mr. Stockwell, for the first time in my life, here am I in England; at the fountain head of pleasure, in the land of beauty, of arts, and elegancies. My happy stars have given me a good estate, and the conspiring winds have blown me hither to spend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>To use it, not to waste it, I should hope; to treat it, Mr. Belcour, not as a vassal, over whom you have a wan∣ton and despotic power, but as a subject, which you are bound to govern with a temperate and restrained au∣thority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir; most truly said; mine's a commission, not a right: I am the offspring of distress, and every child of sorrow is my brother; while I have hands to hold, therefore, I will hold them open to mankind: but, Sir, my passions are my masters; they take me where they will; and oftentimes they leave to reason and to virtue nothing but my wishes and my sighs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Rusport, I desire to hear no more of Captain Dudley and his destitute family: not a shilling of mine shall ever cross the hands of any of them: because my sister chose to marry a beggar, am I bound to support him and his posterity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think I am; and pray where do you find the law that tells you so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not proficient enough to quote chapter and verse; but I take charity to be a main clause in the great statute of christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say charity, indeed! And pray, Miss, are you sure that it is charity, pure charity, which moves you to plead for Captain Dudley? Amongst all your pity, do you find no spice of a certain anti-spiritual passion, called love? Don't mistake yourself, you are no saint, child, believe me; and, I am apt to think, the distresses of old Dudley, and of his daughter into the bargain, would never break your heart, if there was not a certain young fellow of two and twenty in the case; who, by the happy recom∣mendation of a good person, and the brilliant appoint∣ments of an ensigncy, will, if I am not mistaken, cozen you out of a fortune of twice twenty thousand pounds, as soon as ever you are of age to bestow it upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A nephew of your ladyship's can never want any other recommendation with me; and, if my partiality for Charles Dudley is acquitted by the rest of the world, I hope Lady Rusport will not condemn me for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I condemn you! I thank Heaven, Miss Rusport, I am no ways responsible for your conduct; nor is it any concern of mine how you dispose of yourself; you are not my daughter; and, when I married your father, poor Sir Stephen Rusport, I found you a forward spoiled Miss of fourteen far above being instructed by me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps your ladyship calls this instruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're strangely pert; but 'tis no wonder: your mo∣ther, I'm told, was a fine lady; and according to the modern stile of education you was brought up. It was not so in my young days; there was then some decorum in the world, some subordination, as the great Locke ex∣presses it. Oh! 'twas an edifying sight, to see the re∣gular deportment observed in our family: no gigling, no gossiping was going on there; my good father, Sir Oliver Roundhead, never was seen to laugh himself, nor ever allowed it in his children.</P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; those were happy times, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, in this forward age, we have coquets in the egg∣shell, and philosophers in the cradle; girls of fifteen that lead the fashion in new caps and new opinions, that have their sentiments and their sensations, and the idle fops encourage 'em in it O' my conscience, I wonder what it is the men can see in such babies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam; but all men do not overlook the ma∣turer beauties of your ladyship's age, witness your ad∣mirer Major Dennis O'Flaherty; there's an example of some discernment; I declare to you, when your ladyship is by, the Major takes no more notice of me than if I was part of the furniture of your chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The major, child, has travelled through various king∣doms and climates, and has more enlarged notions of fe∣male merit than falls to the lot of an English home-bred lover; in most other countries, no woman on your side forty would ever be named in a polite circle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Madam; I've been told that in Vienna they have coquets upon crutches and Venuses in their grand climateric; a lover there celebrates the wrinkles, not the dimples, in his mistress's face. The Major, I think, has served in the imperial army.</P>

<P>Are you piqu'd, my young Madam? Had my sister Louisa now yielded to the addresses of one of Major O'Flaherty's person and appearance, she would have had some excuse; but to run away, as she did, at the age of sixteen too, with a man of old Dudley's sort—</P>

<P>Was, in my opinion, the most venial trespass that ever girl of sixteen committed; of a noble family, an engaging person, strict honour, and sound understanding, what ac∣complishment was there wanting in Captain Dudley, but that which the prodigality of his ancestors had deprived him of?</P>

<P>Nephew! I renounce him as my nephew; Sir Oliver renounced him as his grandson: wasn't he son of the eldest daughter, and only male descendant of Sir Oliver; and didn't he cut him off with a shilling? Didn't the poor dear good man leave his whole f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtune to me, except a small annuity to my maiden sister, who spoiled her consti∣tution with nursing him?

<P>Why, how you sit, musing and mopeing, sighing and desponding! I'm ashamed of you, Mr. Fulmer: is this the country you described to me, a second Eldorado, rivers of gold and rocks of diamonds? You found me in a pretty snug retir'd way of life at Bologne, out of the noise and bustle of the world, and wholly at my ease; you, indeed, was upon the wing, with a fiery persecu∣tion at your back: but, like a true son of <HI>Loyola,</HI> you had then a thousand ingenious devices to repair your fortune; and this your native country was to be the scene of your performances: fool that I was, to be in∣veigled into it by you; but thank Heaven, our partner∣ship is revocable: I am not your wedded wife, praised be my stars! for what have we got, whom have we gull'd but ourselves; which of all your trains has taken fire; even this poor expedient of your bookseller's shop seems abandoned, for if a chance customer drops in, who is there, pray, to help him to what he wants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patty, you know it is not upon slight grounds that I despair; there had us'd to be a livelihood to be pickt up in this country, both for the honest and dishonest; I have tried each walk, and am likely to starve at last: there is not a point to which the wit and faculty of man can turn, that I have not set mine to; but in vain, I am beat through every quarter of the compass.</P>

<P>Ah! common efforts all: strike me a master stroke, Mr. Fulmer, if you wish to make any figure in this country.</P>

<P>But where, how, and what? I have blustered for pre∣rogative; I have bellowed for freedom; I have offered to serve my country; I have engaged to betray it;

<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captain Dudley, good morning to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Fulmer, I have borrow'd a book from your shop; 'tis the sixth volume of my deceased friend Tristram: he
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
is a flattering writer to us poor soldiers; and the divine story of Le Fevre, which makes part of this book, in my opinion of it, does honour not to its author only, but to human nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is an author I keep in the way of trade, but one I never relish'd; he is much too loose and profligate for my taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's being too severe: I hold him to be a moralist in the noblest sense; he plays indeed with the fancy, and some∣times perhaps too wantonly; but while he thus designedly masks his main attack, he comes at once upon the heart; refines, amends it, softens it; beats down each selfish barrier from about it, and opens every sluice of pity and benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>We of the catholic persuasion are not much bound to him.—Well, Sir, I shall not oppose your opinion; a fevourite author is like a favourite mistress; and there you know, Captain, no man likes to have his taste arraigned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I don't know what a man likes in that case; 'tis an experiment I never made.</P>

<P>Above thirty years I've been in the service, Mr. Fulmer.</P>

<P>I guess'd as much; I laid it at no less: why 'tis a wearisome time; 'tis an apprenticeship to a profession, fit only for a patriarch. But preferment must be closely follow'd: you never could have been so far behind-hand in the chace, unless you had palpably mistaken your way. You'll pardon me, but I begin to perceive you have lived in the world, not with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; and you perhaps can give me better council. I'm now soliciting a favour; an exchange to a company on full pay; nothing more; and yet I meet a thousand bars to that; tho', without boasting, I should think the certificate of services, which I sent in, might have purchased that indulgence to me.</P>

<P>Oh, was that all?

<P>Pray, Sir, what sorrows and distresses have befallen this old gentleman you speak of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poverty, disappointment, and all the distresses attendant thereupon: sorrow enough of all conscience: I soon found how it was with him by his way of living, low enough of all reason; but what I overheard this morning put it out of all doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you overhear this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it seems he wants to join his regiment, and has been beating the town over to raise a little money for that purpose upon his pay; but the climate, I find, where he is going is so unhealthy, that nobody can be found to lend him any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then your town is a damn'd good-for-nothing town; and I wish I had never come into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I say, Sir; the hard-heartedness of some folks is unaccountable. There's an old Lady Rusport, a near relation of this gentleman's; she lives hard by here, opposite to Stockwell's, the great merchant; he sent to her a begging, but to no purpose; though she is as rich as a Jew, she would not furnish him with a farthing.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith and troth, Master Dudley, you may say that; 'tis thirty years, come the time, that I have followed the trade, and in a pretty many countries—Let me see—In the war before last I serv'd in the Irish Brigade, d'ye see; there after bringing off the French monarch, I left his service, with a British bullet in my body, and this ribband in my button-hole. Last war I followed the fortunes of the German eagle, in the corps of grenadiers; there I had my belly-full of fighting, and a plentiful scarcity of every thing else. After six and twenty engagements, great and small, I went off with this gash on my scull, and a kiss of the empress queen's sweet hand, (Heaven bless it) for my pains: since the peace, my dear, I took a little turn with the Confederates there in Poland—but such another set of madcaps!—by the Lord Harry, I never knew what it was they were scuffling about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Major, I won't add another action to the list, you shall keep your promise with Lady Rusport; she re∣quires me to leave London; I shall go in a few days, and you may take what credit you please from my compliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand, my dear boy, this will make her my own; when that's the case, we shall be brothers you know, and we'll share her fortune between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so, Major; the man who marries Lady Rusport will have a fair title to her whole fortune without division.
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
But, I hope, your expectations of prevailing are founded upon good reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the best grounds in the world; first I think she will comply, because she is a woman; secondly, I am per∣suaded she won't hold out long, because she's a widow; and thirdly, I make sure of her, because I've married five wives and never failed yet; and, for what I know, they're all alive and merry at this very hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, go on and prosper; if you can inspire Lady Rusport with half your charity, I shall think you deserve all her fortune; at present, I must beg your excuse: good morning to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good sensible man, and very much of a soldier; I did not care if I was better acquainted with him: but 'tis an awkward kind of a country for that; the English, I ob∣serve, are close friends, but distant acquaintance. I suspect the old lady has not been over generous to poor Dudley: I shall give her a little touch about that; upon my soul I know but one excuse a person can have for giving nothing, and that is, like myself, having nothing to give.</P>

<P>Do, Lucy. Alas! Sir, ever since I lost my husband, my poor nerves have been shook to pieces: there hangs his beloved picture; that precious relick, and a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiful jointure, is all that remains to console me for the best of men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see; i'faith a comely personage: by his fur cloak I suppose he was in the Russian service, and by the gold chain round his neck I should guess he had been honoured with the order of St. Catharine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he meddled with no St Catharines: that's the habit he wore in his mayoralty; Sir Stephen was Lord Mayor of London; but he is gone, and has left me a poor, weak, solitary widow behind him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means, then, take a strong, able, hearty man to repair his loss: if such a plain fellow as one Dennis O'Flaherty can please you, I think I may venture to say, without any disparagement to the gentleman in the fur-gown there—</P>

<P>Well, 'tis no matter; so I am but rid of him, and his distresses: wou'd you believe it, Major O'Flaherty, it was but this morning he sent a begging to me for money to fit him out upon some wild-goose expedition to the coast of Africa, I know not where.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, if you'll fetch me the jewels, I believe I can undertake to carry them to her; but as for the money, I'll have nothing to do with that; Dudley would be your fittest ambassador on that occasion; and, if I mistake not, the most agreeable to the lady.</P>

<P>Ah, Sir! the letter which I've been reading disqualifies me for delivering the letter which you have been writing: I have other game on foot; the loveliest girl my eyes ever feasted upon is started in view, and the world cannot now divert me from pursuing her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>A woman: one that can turn, and overturn me and my tottering resolutions every way she will. Oh, Sir, if this is folly in me, you must rail at Nature: you must chide the sun, that was vertical at my birth, and would not wink upon my nakedness, but swaddled me in the broadest, hottest glare of his meridian beams.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous young man——let me embrace you—How shall I hide my tears? I have been to blame; because I bore you the affection of a father, I rashly took up the authority of one. I ask your pardon—pursue your course; I have no right to stop it—What would you have me do with these things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, if I might advise; carry the money to Miss Rus∣port immediately; never let generosity wait for it's mate∣rials; that part of the business presses. Give me the jewels; I'll find an opportunity of delivering them into her hands; and your visit may pave the way for my reception.</P>

I cannot bring myself to break a trust, and I am not at present in the humour to baulk my inclinations. Is there no middle way? Let me consider—There is, there is: my good genius has pre∣sented me with one; apt, obvious, honourable; the girl shall not go without her baubles, I'll not go without the girl, Miss Rusport shan't lose her diamonds, I'll save Dudley from destruction, and every party shall be a gainer by the project.</P>

<P>Madam, your most obedient servant: I am honoured with your commands, by Captain Dudley; and have brought the money with me as you directed: I understand the sum you have occasion for is two hundred pounds.</P>

<P>It is, Sir; I am quite confounded at your taking this trouble upon yourself, Mr. Stockwell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a Bank-note, Madam, to the amount: your jewels are in safe hands, and will be delivered to you di∣rectly.
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
If I had been happy in being better known to you, I should have hoped you would not have thought it necessary to place a deposit in my hands for so trifling a sum as you have now required me to supply you with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bawbles I sent you may very well be spared; and, as they are the only security, in my present situation, I can give you, I could wish you would retain them in your hands: when I am of age, (which, if I live a few months, I shall be) I will replace your favour, with thanks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is obvious, Miss Rusport, that your charms will suffer no impeachment by the absence of these superficial orna∣ments; but they should be seen in the suite of a woman of fashion, not as creditors to whom you are indebted for your appearance, but as subservient attendants, which help to make up your equipage.</P>

<P>Mr. Stockwell is determined not to wrong the con∣fidence I reposed in his politeness.</P>

<P>Most gladly; any friend of yours cannot fail of being welcome here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I flatter myself you will not find him totally undeserving your good opinion; an education, not of the strictest kind, and strong animal spirits, are apt sometimes to betray him into youthful irregularities; but an high principle of ho∣nour, and an uncommon benevolence, in the eye of candor, will, I hope, atone for any faults, by which these good qualities are not impaired.</P>

<P>Nor need you, Mr. Stockwell: I shall be studious to deserve his friendship; and, though I have long since un∣alterably placed my affections on another, I trust, I have not left myself insensible to the merits of Mr. Belcour; and hope that neither you nor he will, for that reason, think me less worthy your good opinion and regards.</P>

<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
to the charter of my colony, not by a jury of En∣glish spinsters: truth is, I've given away your jewels; caught with a pair of sparkling eyes, whose lustre blinded their's, I served your property, as I shou'd my own, and lavish'd it away; let me not totally despair of your for∣giveness: I frequently do wrong, but never with impu∣nity; if your displeasure is added to my own, my punish∣ment will be too severe. When I parted from the jewels, I had not the honour of knowing their owner.</P>

<P>Mr. Belcour, your sincerity charms me, I enter at once into your character, and I make all the allowances for it you can desire. I take your jewels for the present, be∣cause I know there is no other way of reconciling you to yourself; but If I give way to your spirit in one point, you must yield to mine in another; remember I will not keep more than the value of my own jewels: there is no need to be pillaged by more than one woman at a time, Sir.</P>

this was done, you will be charm'd; I can only now add, that it was by chance we found out that his name is Belcour, and that he is a friend of Mr. Stock∣well's.

<P>I insist upon referring our dispute to him: your sister and I, Charles, have a quarrel; Belcour, the hero of your letter, has just left us—some how or other, Louisa's bright eyes have caught him; and the poor fellow's fallen despe∣rately in love with her—(don't interrupt me, hussey)— Well, that's excusable enough, you'll say; but the jet of the story is, that this hair-brain'd spark, who does nothing like other people, has given her the very identical jewels, which you pledged for me to Mr. Stockwell; and will you believe that this little demure slut made up a face, and squeezed out three or four hypocritical tears, because I ral∣lied her about it?</P>

<P>Ay, ay, now the murder's out; he's in love with her, and she has no very great dislike to him; trust to my observation, Charles, for that: as to the diamonds, there's some mistake about them, and you must clear it up: three minutes conversation with him will put every thing in a right train; go, go, Charles, 'tis a brother's business; about it instantly; ten to one you'll find him over the way at Mr. Stockwell's.</P>

<P>Well, Louisa, I confess the force of what you say: I accept Miss Rusport's bounty, and when you see my generous Charlotte, tell her—but have a care, there is a selfishness even in gratitude, when it is too profuse; to be over thankful for any one favour, is in effect to lay out for another; the best return I cou'd make my benefactress wou'd be never to see her more.</P>

<P>We, that are poor, Louisa, shou'd be cautious; for this reason I wou'd guard you against Belcour; at least till I can unravel the mystery of Miss Rusport's diamonds; I was disappointed of finding him at Mr. Stockwell's, and am now going in search of him again: he may intend honourably, but I confess to you I am stagger'd; think no more of him, therefore, for the present: of this be sure, while I have life, and you have honour, I will pro∣tect you, or perish in your defence.</P>

<P>I think you wou'd, but mark the danger of licentious courses; you are betray'd, robb'd, abus'd, and but for this providential discovery in a fair way of being sent out of the world with all your follies on your head— Dear Stukely, go to my neighbour, tell him I have an owner for the jewels, and beg him to carry the people under custody to the London Tavern, and wait for me there. <STAGE>Exit <HI>Stukely.</HI></STAGE></P>
<P>I fear the law does not provide a punishment to reach the villiany of these people; but how in the name of wonder cou'd you take any thing on the word of such an informer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I had not liv'd long enough in your country to know how few informers words are to be taken: perswaded however as I was of Miss Dudley's guilt, I must own to you I was stagger'd with the appearance of such innocence, especially when I saw her admitted into Miss Rusport's company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Heaven! did you meet her at, Miss Rusport's, and cou'd you doubt her being a woman of reputa∣tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>By you perhaps such a mistake cou'd not have been made, but in a perfect stranger, I hope it is venial: I did not know what artifices young Dudley might have us'd to conceal her character; I did not know what disgrace attended the detection of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it was a trap laid for you, which you have narrowly escap'd; you address'd a woman of honour with all the loose incense of a profane admirer, and you have drawn upon you the resentment of a man of honour who thinks himself bound to protect her: Well, Sir, you must atone for this mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the lady the most penitent submission I can make is justly due, but in the execution of an act of justice it never shall be said my soul was swayed by the least particle of fear: I have received a challenge from her brother; now tho' I wou'd give my fortune, almost my life itself, to purchase her happiness, yet I cannot abate her one scruple of my honour; I have been branded with the name of villain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, you mistook her character and he mistook yours; error begets error.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Villain, Mr. Stockwell, is a harsh word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Murdering!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis thus religion writes and speaks the word; in the vocabulary of modern honour there is no such term—But come, I don't despair of satisfying the one without alarming the other; that done, I have a dis∣covery to unfold that you will then I hope be fitted to receive.</P>

<P>You will not find us backward in any worthy cause; but before we proceed any further, I would ask this young gentleman, whether he has any explanation to require of Mr. Belcour.</P>

<P>Of Mr. Belcour none; his actions speak for them∣selves: but to you, sir, I would fain propose one question.</P>

<P>How is it, Mr. Stockwell, that I meet a man of your character on this ground?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will answer you directly, and my answer shall not displease you. I come hither in defence of the reputa∣tion of Miss Dudley, to redress the injuries of an in∣nocent young lady.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my soul the man knows he's to fight, only he mistakes which side he's to be of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are about to draw your sword to refute a charge against your sister's honour; you would do well, if there were no better means within reach; but the proofs of her innocence are lodg'd in our bosoms, and
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
if we fall, you destroy the evidence that most effectu∣ally can clear her fame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>This gentleman could best explain it to you, but you have given him an undeserv'd name that seals his lips against you: I am not under the same inhibition, and if your anger can keep cool for a few minutes, I desire I may call in two witnesses, who will solve all difficulties at once. Here, waiter! bring those people in that are without.</P>

<P>Fulmer and his wife in custody?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, these are your honest landlord and land∣lady, now in custody for defrauding this gentleman of certain diamonds intended to have been presented to your sister. Be so good, Mrs. Fulmer, to inform the company why you so grossly scandalized the reputation of an innocent lady, by persuading Mr. Belcour that Miss Dudley was not the sister, but the mistress, of this gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I don't know what right you have to question me, and I shall not answer till I see occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you been as silent heretofore, Madam, it would have saved you some trouble; but we don't want your confession. This letter, which you wrote to Mr. Bel∣cour, will explain your design; and these diamonds, which of right belong to Miss Rusport, will confirm your guilt: the law, Mrs. Fulmer, will make you speak, tho' I can't. Constable, take charge of your prisoners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold a moment: Mr. Stockwell, you are a gentle∣man that knows the world, and a member of parlia∣ment; we shall not attempt to impose upon you; we know we are open to the law, and we know the ut∣most it can do against us. Mr. Belcour has been ill used to be sure, and so has Miss Dudley; and, for my own part, I always condemn'd the plot as a very foolish plot, but it was a child of Mrs. Fulmer's brain, and she would not be put out of conceit with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a very foolish man, Mr. Fulmer, so prythee hold your tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, as I was saying, if you send her to Bride-well, it won't be amiss; and if you give her a little wholesome discipline, she may be the better for that too: but for me, Mr. Stockwell, who am a man of letters, I must beseech you, Sir, not to bring any dis∣grace upon my profession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis you, Mr. Fulmer, not I, that disgrace your profession, therefore begone, nor expect that I will betray the interests of mankind so far as to shew fa∣vour to such incendiaries. Take 'em away; I blush to think such wretches should have the power to set two honest men at variance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Belcour, we have mistaken each other; let us exchange forgiveness. I am convinced you intended no affront to my sister, and I ask your pardon for the expression I was betrayed into.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis enough, Sir; the error began on my side, and was Miss Dudley here, I would be the first to atone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let us all adjourn to my house, and conclude the evening like friends: you will find a little entertain∣ment ready for you; and, if I am not mistaken, Miss

Dudley and her father will make part of our company. Come, Major, do you consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most readily, Mr. Stockwell; a quarrel well made up, is better than a victory hardly earned. Give me your hand, Belcour; o' my conscience you are too honest for the country you live in. And now, my dear lad, since peace is concluded on all sides, I have a discovery to make to you, which you must find out for yourself, for deuce take me if I rightly comprehend it, only that your aunt Rusport is in a conspiracy against you, and a vile rogue of a lawyer, whose name I forget, at the bottom of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What conspiracy? Dear Major, recollect yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'FLAHERTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my soul, I've no faculty at recollecting myself; but I've a paper somewhere about me, that will tell you more of the matter than I can. When I get to the merchant's, I will endeavour to find it.</P>

<P>He has; I have too good an opinion of Mr. Bel∣cour to believe he cou'd be guilty of a design'd affront to an innocent girl, and I am much too well acquainted with your character to suppose you cou'd abet him in such design; I have no doubt therefore all things will be set to rights in very few words when we have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Belcour.</P>

<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has only stept into the compting-house and will wait upon you directly: You will not be over strict, Madam, in weighing Mr. Belcour's conduct to the minutest scruple; his manners, passions and opinions are not as yet affimilated to this climate; he comes amongst you a new character, an inhabitant of a new world and both hospitality as well as pity recommend him to our indulgence.</P>

<P>To me there's nothing due, nor any thing demanded of you but your more favourable opinion for the future, if you should chance to think of me: Upon the part of virtue I'm not empower'd to speak, but if hereafter, as you range thro' life, you shou'd surprize her in the person of some wretched female, poor as myself and not so well protected, enforce not your advantage, compleat not your licentious triumph, but raise her, rescue her from shame and sorrow, and reconcile her to herself again.</P>

As I now cease to view you in that false light I lately did, can you, and in the fulness of your bounty will you, cease also to reflect upon the libertine addresses I have paid you, and look upon me as your reform'd, your rational admirer?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because tho' you conquer'd me by surprize, I have no inclination to rebel; because since the first moment that I saw you, every instant has improv'd you in my eyes, because by principle as well as passion I am un∣alterably yours, in short there are ten thousand causes for my love to you, would to Heaven I could plant one in your soft bosom that might move you to return it!</P>

<P>Heyday! mighty fine! wife truly! mighty well! kissing, embracing—did ever any thing equal this? Why you shameless hussey!—But I won't condescend to waste a word upon you.—You, Sir, you, Mr. Stockwell, you fine, sanctified, fair-dealing man of conscience, is this the principle you trade upon? Is this your neighbourly system, to keep a house of recep∣tion for run-away daughters, and young beggarly fortune-hunters?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Madam, I cannot consent to lose Miss Rus∣port's company this evening, and I am persuaded you won't insist upon it; 'tis an unmotherly action to in∣terrupt your daughter's happiness in this manner, be∣lieve me it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her happiness truly; upon my word! and I suppose it's an unmotherly action to interrupt her ruin; for what but ruin must it be to marry a beggar? I think my sister had a proof of that, Sir, when she made choice of you.</P>

<P>You may say that, faith, he is a cursed lawyer, and a cursed piece of work I had to get the paper from him; your ladyship now was to have paid him five thousand pounds for it, I forc'd him to give it me of his own accord for nothing at all, at all.</P>

watch'd you with a patient, but enquiring eye, and I have discover'd thro' the veil of some irregularities, a heart beaming with benevolence, an animated nature, fallible indeed, but not incorrigible; and your election of this excellent young lady makes me glory in acknow∣ledging you to be my son.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, and in my turn glory in the father I have gained: sensibly imprest with gratitude for such extraordinary dispensations, I beseech you, amiable Louisa, for the time to come, whenever you perceive me deviating into error or offence, bring only to my mind the Providence of this night, and I will turn to reason and obey.</P>
