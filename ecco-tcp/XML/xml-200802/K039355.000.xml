<L>ACCEPT, dear Parent! from a filial pen,</L>
<L>The humble off'ring of my pensive Muse:</L>
<L>She painted on my mind a <HI>Daughter</HI>'s woes,</L>
<L>Nor could my heart the tender theme refuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>rightful</HI> Patron of th'eventful tale,</L>
<L>To you I dedicate the scenes she drew;</L>
<L>My soul she search'd to find OSMIDA's thoughts,</L>
<L>And colour'd <HI>her</HI> from what I feel for <HI>you.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yours then the meed—if meed kind Fame will grant,</L>
<L>The tale to you—to you the bayes belong;</L>
<L>You gave my youthful fancy wings to soar;</L>
<L>From your indulgence flows my wild-note song.</L>
</LG>

<L>Its music in <HI>your</HI> ear will sweetly sound;</L>
<L>Its page, with fond delight, you'll traverse o'er:</L>
<L>With half your pleasure may the world peruse!</L>
<L>My muse, my vanity can ask no more.</L>

<L>Dear <HI>other</HI> Parent! guiltless hold my heart,</L>
<L>Though unadorn'd my numbers with your name;</L>
<L>Your worth, your goodness, in its centre lives,</L>
<L>And there shall perish only with my frame.</L>

<TAILNOTE>
<P>☞ It is near three years since the above lines were written, and the First Part of THE MAID OF ARRAGON finished; though other avocations have prevented the publication till now. This circumstance is mentioned, to shew that they were prompted by the heart, and not by the desire of imitating the Author of an admirable Novel, which was addressed to a Father since that period.</P>

<HEAD>DEPRECATION.</HEAD>
<P>I ENTREAT the Reviewers to have compassion on me. From the beginning of my literary warfare, these un∣merciful Wits have pursued me with the sharpest arrows of Criticism; and I have had nothing to console me, alas!—but the approbation of the Public. How shall I escape now, when to all my other faults are added, so many out∣rages in Geography? With what triumph of critical saga∣city will they say, (after the necessary strictures on the story, thoughts, and verses) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If our Author was determined to send her Pegasus into <HI>Spain,</HI> in quest of adventures, she ought to have consulted <HI>Salmon</HI> about the situation of its provinces. She would there have found that <HI>Ar∣ragon</HI> is fifty miles from the sea; and that the <HI>Moors</HI> could not possibly have debarked on its confines, unless, like fish to the <HI>London</HI> markets, their fleet had arrived by land-carriage. With equal facility, the troops of the King of <HI>Leon</HI> are brought across <HI>Old Castile</HI> to <HI>Saragossa</HI> in about thirty hours—another miracle; which was doubtless accomplished by the interposition of a friendly necromancer, who furnished the army with wings, in exchange for some chaste damsel, or beautifull princess. Had this Lady-Writer's reading extended to a <HI>translation</HI> of the Iliad, she would have found no examples of such liberties there. <HI>Homer</HI> gives an exact map of the coun∣tries he carries us through; and from <HI>Ithaca</HI> to <HI>Troy,</HI> not a village or river is misplaced."</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
True: but <HI>Homer</HI> (I name him as a modern Painter mentions a <HI>Correggio,</HI> and a <HI>Raphael</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> united the Historian with the Poet—I deal entirely in fiction. It was enough for me, that <HI>Spain,</HI> through a succession of ages, had been subject to the ravages of <HI>Africa;</HI> and that during this period, sovereigns had been robbed of their crowns, and been obliged to resign their sceptres to their swarthy conquerors. The relation of the particular events of these remote times, the Historic Muse has generally left to her creative Sister, who never fails to profit by their obscu∣rity, in relating them to the world in her own manner; the geography of the heart, and the history of the passions, are the only realities to which she attends. If, in describing <HI>these,</HI> I shall be found deviating from the laws of Truth, and Nature, I shall have failed in my intention; but I pro∣test, if the <HI>cacoethes scribendi</HI> should continue on me, or if I should ever wander again into the regions of Romance, I shall treat oceans and provinces with as little ceremony as rivulets and meadows: I will avail myself of the established privileges, and raise mountains, seas, or kingdoms, in any part of the habitable globe that hits my fancy; or, if it strikes me, build a temple to Dullness—in the chamber of a Reviewer.</P>

<HEAD>THE MAID OF ARRAGON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OH, ye! whose sympathetic hearts are form'd</L>
<L>To woe responsive, and whose trem'lous nerves</L>
<L>Vibrate to Sorrow's mournful airs—attend!</L>
<L>Not you, ye gay! not you, ye vacant crouds!</L>
<L>Who labour through the pleasures of the world,</L>
<L>Nor feel existence when they cease t'impel;</L>
<L>I call not you!—for, oh, your callous bosoms</L>
<L>Fell Dissipation steels, and robs your minds</L>
<L>Of the sweet energies bestow'd by Heaven:</L>
<L>But, come, ye few! who love the lonely hour;</L>
<L>Who know the sense refin'd, the charming agony,</L>
<L>Which Pity gives the hallow'd hearts she fills;</L>
<L>To you I call! oh, come, and trace with me</L>
<L>(Whilst glitt'ring Hesperus holds high his torch)</L>
<L>The mazy windings of yon solemn wood.</L>
<L>Behold the lawn, which opens on the left,</L>
<L>With crocus border'd, aromatic thyme,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
And ev'ry fragrant shrub that tempts the bee</L>
<L>Down from the liquid air, to bathe in sweets.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The op'ning wicket of that humble cot,</L>
<L>By slow degrees, moves gently on its hinge:</L>
<L>And now, with cautious tread, the soft OSMIDA,</L>
<L><HI>Looking</HI> a blessing on her slumb'ring Sire,</L>
<L>The threshold quits; when, from his short repose,</L>
<L>Aged ALMANZOR starts:—Where art thou, Child?</L>
<L>Where is my darling? Oh! return, OSMIDA!</L>
<L>Why wilt thou wander in Night's chilly air,</L>
<L>And trust thy bosom to its piercing dews?</L>
<L>Return, my Child! th' unpitying winds will shake</L>
<L>Thy tender frame.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The night is calm, my Father!</L>
<L>Scarcely a zephyr moves the restless aspin;</L>
<L>And the clear moon, with soft inviting beam,</L>
<L>Looks through the foliage of the lofty pines.</L>
<L>A moment let me breathe the balmy air!</L>
<L>Confin'd beneath the cottage roof by fear,</L>
<L>And more confin'd by duteous cares for thee,</L>
<L>All day I live immur'd. Then let me now</L>
<L>Taste Nature's blessings—exercise and air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Heaven guard my Child! But soon return, OSMIDA;</L>
<L>And downy sleep shake slumbers on thy pillow!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OSMIDA quits the cot, and bends her steps</L>
<L>Towards the margin of a neighb'ring lake:</L>
<L>But not its lucid bosom tempts her steps,</L>
<L>Nor moon inviting through the lofty pines,</L>
<L>Nor balmy air, nor healthful exercise;</L>
<L>Ah, no!—it is to breathe her bosom'd anguish,</L>
<L>Where Grief, though audible, wastes her sad voice</L>
<L>In ambient air—not torturing the ear</L>
<L>Of the rever'd ALMANZOR, Sire belov'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<L>Bending to earth, with eyes that penetrate</L>
<L>The glowing canopy of heaven; in sounds</L>
<L>More mournful than the widow'd stock-dove's plaints</L>
<L>—Tender as youthful mother's lulling song,</L>
<L>She thus address'd Omnipotence divine:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, Thou! in whose eternal, boundless sight,</L>
<L>The woes, or happiness, that overpower</L>
<L>The mind of finite man, seem but as drops,</L>
<L>That in the vast abyss unite their littleness,</L>
<L>To form one mighty whole—to Thee I pray!</L>
<L>Not for myself I pray, but for my Father;</L>
<L>For him whose care-worn heart, drooping, oppress'd,</L>
<L>And torn with barbed griefs, seems torn from thee.</L>
<L>His soul her wonted confidence forsakes;</L>
<L>He falls from thee; he leans not on the rock,</L>
<L>The sacred rock, by which alone he stands</L>
<L>—And quitting, sinks to measureless despair.</L>
<L>Oh, Thou, accept my humble heart for his!</L>
<L>Hear, hear ALMANZOR, in OSMIDA's voice!</L>
<L>'Tis he implores. Bless, comfort, heal his griefs;</L>
<L>And to thyself attach his sorrow-tempted heart!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next for my <HI>Country,</HI> Heav'n, oh, hear my pray'r!</L>
<L>Behold her struggles with a pitying eye!</L>
<L>Drive from thy temple-gates the mocking infidel!</L>
<L>Restore thy altars! Send—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pious Virgin's voice, with terror choak'd,</L>
<L>Unfinish'd left her pray'r. Forth, from the shade</L>
<L>Of the surrounding thicket, rush'd a Knight,</L>
<L>In shining armour clad, borne on a steed</L>
<L>Who seem'd to scorn the earth, his light heel pass'd,</L>
<L>As though <HI>his</HI> element had been the air:</L>
<L>Swift, as the breath of fierce Euroclydon</L>
<L>He bore his master to the spangled lake,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>
Whose borders, by OSMIDA's knee still press'd,</L>
<L>In thousand glowing colours bloom'd around her,</L>
<L>In thousand scents perfum'd the tranquil air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Light vaulting on the ground, the Knight approach'd,</L>
<L>And in such courteous phrase address'd the Maid,</L>
<L>That half her terrors ended with his words.</L>
<L>Leave me, Sir Knight! with firmness she reply'd;</L>
<L>And as she spoke, her voice, though sweet, express'd</L>
<L>A custom to command. Leave me, Sir Knight!</L>
<L>This solitude is to Misfortune sacred;</L>
<L>None ever tread these unfrequented wilds,</L>
<L>But those to whom the door of sweet Society,</L>
<L>And Friendship's holy gate, are shut forever.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And can the social door, and Friendship's gate,</L>
<L>To thee oppose their brazen locks? O Heaven!</L>
<L>The <HI>peopled</HI> world thy angels have sorsook,</L>
<L>And here in deserts dwell—in human form,</L>
<L>But in celestial beauty! Tell me, Virgin!</L>
<L>—For sure the awe, with which thy eye inspires,</L>
<L>Bespeaks thy vestal state—tell me, fair Maid!</L>
<L>What ills, what sore affliction, <HI>thee</HI> have driven</L>
<L>To seek, in these sequester'd shades, felicity</L>
<L>By man refus'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My sorrows, gentle Knight!</L>
<L>I dare not whisper to the speechless air</L>
<L>—Still less intrust them to a stranger's ear:</L>
<L>Yet, from your courtesy, I must demand</L>
<L>My <HI>solitude</HI> again; and, as you hope</L>
<L>For blessing from the Pow'r who hears my voice,</L>
<L>Swear never to divulge, that in these glades</L>
<L>A Maid you found—by outward beauty grac'd,</L>
<L>But whose sad heart, Sorrow hath call'd her own,</L>
<L>And stern Affliction long enroll'd a sister!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<L>The Stranger paus'd: and then, as if to win</L>
<L>Her confidence, and woo her from reserve</L>
<L>By frank example, thus the Nymph address'd:</L>
<L>To <HI>whom</HI> should I reveal this bless'd abode?</L>
<L><HI>Whose</HI> feet conduct to violate your haunts?</L>
<L><HI>I,</HI> who, like you, by keen misfortunes press'd,</L>
<L>Seek shelter from the world; and even now</L>
<L>Forsake my native skies; quit <HI>Gallia</HI>'s shores,</L>
<L>Her purple vineyards leave, her fertile meads,</L>
<L>Her ever blooming fields—all these I quit—</L>
<L>For these, to wretched hearts, bloom, swell, and fertilise, in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unhappy Youth! breath'd forth the sad OSMIDA;</L>
<L>And is Affliction's appetite so vast,</L>
<L>That daily victims can't allay her rage?</L>
<L>But, gentle Knight! where will your journey end?</L>
<L>What Porter waits to hear your bugle sound,</L>
<L>And ope the gates, with welcome in his face</L>
<L>To greet his honour'd Lord's expected guest?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! sweet Maid! no hospitable gate</L>
<L>DE COURCI seeks; <HI>no</HI> welcome waits his steps:</L>
<L>To Eastern climes I bend my weary course;</L>
<L>—<HI>Jerusalem</HI> the home which ends my progress.</L>
<L>There let me bear <HI>your</HI> woes. Instruct me, Lady!</L>
<L>That at the Holy Sepulchre your name</L>
<L>May animate my pray'rs; that there your griefs</L>
<L>May, sanctify'd, ascend the porch of heav'n,</L>
<L>And, in their stead, soft peace, and blooming joy,</L>
<L>Return into your breast. That duty pass'd,</L>
<L>My sword shall lend its vigour to the cause</L>
<L>—The sacred cause, which arms our Christian legions,</L>
<L>And drains our cities of their val'rous Knights.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OSMIDA's eye, beaming with new-born hope,</L>
<L>And gratitude awak'd, shot forth her thoughts,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Ere from her vermeil lips these accents stole</L>
<L>—In breath more fragrant than an Eastern morn:</L>
<L><HI>Wilt</HI> thou remember me at <HI>Zion</HI>'s gate?</L>
<L>And shall <HI>my</HI> sorrows from the holy cave,</L>
<L>In which the Saviour drew his <HI>second</HI> breath,</L>
<L>Ascend to the Almighty's throne?—Again</L>
<L>She stopp'd, and check'd her growing frankness.</L>
<L>The Stranger saw instinctive prudence rise,</L>
<L>And fear'd to give the virtue time to act.</L>
<L>Yes, he rejoin'd, with zeal more pure and ardent</L>
<L>Than converts feel, who, at the holy altar,</L>
<L>Bewail a life of curst idolatry,</L>
<L>Will I your sorrows pour, in that bless'd spot</L>
<L>Where Sorrow surely cannot plead in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Struck with the piety which deck'd his words,</L>
<L>Yet doubting still, the timid, trusting Virgin,</L>
<L>In silence, with herself thus cogitates:</L>
<L>A <HI>Christian</HI> Knight he is, and with his life</L>
<L>Now hast'ning to support the Christian cause.</L>
<L>Oceans and continents will soon divide us:</L>
<L>Why then the knowledge of my woes with-hold,</L>
<L>When bless'd Benevolence demands the tale?</L>
<L>Then, turning to the Stranger, meekly said</L>
<L>—Such kind persuasion confidence demands;</L>
<L>Yet patience will you need, whilst I relate</L>
<L>Events so <HI>strong,</HI> they fitter would become</L>
<L>A manly tongue. Of battles I must speak,</L>
<L>Of falling kingdoms, and victorious arms.</L>
<L>These strains accord not with a female voice;</L>
<L>Yet will I strive to nerve my thoughts and language,</L>
<L>And raise my fancy to the lofty theme.</L>
<L>But not alone of war shall I discourse,</L>
<L>Of meeting armies, or contending states.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
—Here on this sloping bank, Sir Knight, repose;</L>
<L>And I a tale—for Pity—will unfold,</L>
<L>Were Pity's tears innum'rous as the sands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Knight, with token of respect, obey'd.</L>
<L>OSMIDA, with the grace of sweet reserve,</L>
<L>At gentle distance, near the moss-grown roots</L>
<L>Of an expanding beech, a Wood-nymph seem'd</L>
<L>—A woodland goddess! and her grassy seat</L>
<L>Chaste <HI>Dian</HI>'s rural throne. Grave Recollection</L>
<L>On her sweet features spread an air compos'd;</L>
<L>Whilst in Night's zenith—'midst her radiant court,</L>
<L>The crystal Moon seem'd fix'd in still attention:</L>
<L>The silent waters of the lake more silent flow'd:</L>
<L>The Zephyrs, drawing close their silken wings,</L>
<L>In soft subjection held the rustling branches:</L>
<L>The wheeling bat far off her circles draws;</L>
<L>Whilst the Night's sweet musician still'd her song,</L>
<L>To learn a sadder note—from fair OSMIDA.</L>
<L>All thus in silence wrapt, the thoughtful Maid,</L>
<L>With tone sedate, begins the promis'd tale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This happy clime—this <HI>Arragonian</HI> realm,</L>
<L>Had late a Monarch, whom her Sons rever'd;</L>
<L>—As <HI>King</HI> rever'd him, as a <HI>Father</HI> lov'd:</L>
<L>He lov'd his People, knew no care but theirs;</L>
<L>And the fond blessings, which they gave his name,</L>
<L>Blunted the thorns a diadem conceals.</L>
<L>Peace, in this happy reign, her throne establish'd,</L>
<L>And brought her proper blessings in her train;</L>
<L>Fair Commerce wav'd her pennons in our ports;</L>
<L>The fertile plough subdu'd our sterile fields;</L>
<L>Our granaries, like those of <HI>Egypt,</HI> drew</L>
<L>From neighb'ring countries, riches and renown.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="13"/>
The cottage Peasant, round his well-fill'd board,</L>
<L>Saw thankful faces and contented hearts:</L>
<L>No iron taxes grip'd his pallid frame,</L>
<L>Nor tore the morsel from his children's mouths:</L>
<L>Blithe as the morn he rose to healthful labour,</L>
<L>And hail'd, with joy, th'approach of festive eve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such once the favour'd lot of envied <HI>Arragon.</HI></L>
<L>Her fame, her riches, spreading to the East,</L>
<L>Entic'd the Moors from their polluted home:</L>
<L>Sudden their prows invade our peaceful seas;</L>
<L>—Sudden the bold Barbarians croud our shores;</L>
<L>Defenceless hamlets turn unnatural beacons,</L>
<L>And blaze the woe-fraught tidings through the land.</L>
<L>Like a night-torrent, fierce, uncheck'd, they come</L>
<L>With devastation at their coursers heels;</L>
<L>Death, rapine, ruin, mark their dreadful progress,</L>
<L>And reach the bulwarks of the royal city.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Deep consternation spreads through ev'ry street;</L>
<L>Th'affrighted virgins to the temples run;</L>
<L>The mother grasps her child, and shrieking flies;</L>
<L>Whilst husbands, fathers, brothers, all in arms,</L>
<L>Chide the dear mourners who retard their speed,</L>
<L>Snatch last adieus, and rush upon the walls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But from the walls, what image strikes the view!</L>
<L>A turban'd phalanx on the hill appear'd,</L>
<L>Rapid descending to the plain below.</L>
<L>Upon the right advanc'd a mighty column,</L>
<L>Of armed chariots form'd—so thickly set</L>
<L>With scythes, and swords, and barbed spears, each seem'd</L>
<L>A steely porcupine; whose burnish'd quills,</L>
<L>Catching the rays of the meridian sun,</L>
<L>Gleam'd back upon the town refulgent horror.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
Upon the left hand mov'd the tawny marksmen,</L>
<L>Whose ebon bows, and quivers richly stor'd,</L>
<L>They sung, were given by Death—unerring archer!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dreadful pomp descended to the plain,</L>
<L>Fix'd their bold standards, and entrenchments form'd,</L>
<L>—Whilst our scar'd citizens observ'd their works,</L>
<L>Like trembling birds, who, looking from their nests</L>
<L>Upon the charming cockatrice, behold</L>
<L>Inevitable fate. But black despair,</L>
<L>That first enerv'd, next lent their courage fury:</L>
<L>Lead us! they cry'd—lead to the <HI>Moorish</HI> camp!</L>
<L>What are their numbers, <HI>single</HI> as they come?</L>
<L>With us, our parents, children, lovers, laws,</L>
<L>Religion, liberty—all join the battle,</L>
<L>—Brace our firm arms, and give ten thousand points,</L>
<L>Ten thousand deaths, to ev'ry Christian sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This holy rage, like sparks electric, flew</L>
<L>From man to man. Each urg'd his valiant friend,</L>
<L>To save their city, matrons, daughters, wives,</L>
<L>—As if on <HI>each</HI> their preservation hung.</L>
<L>Scarce could the pious King restrain their ardor,</L>
<L>So sure they seem'd of conquest and revenge.</L>
<L>But he, who knew that from th'almighty arm</L>
<L>Their foes' destruction only could proceed,</L>
<L>The gates of every temple open threw,</L>
<L>And, with humiliation deep, repair'd</L>
<L>Before the sacred altar of our God.</L>
<L>The soldiers, citizens, the nobles croud,</L>
<L>And ev'ry holy roof grew instant vocal.</L>
<L>Prostrate and weeping, they implor'd the High</L>
<L>For <HI>Gideon</HI>'s sword, and mighty <HI>Joshua</HI>'s arm.</L>
<L>"Shield us!" they cry'd—"Oh, save thy faithful people!</L>
<L>Nor give us to the mockers, for a scorn!</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="15"/>
Omnipotence! preserve us from the yoke</L>
<L>The foe prepares for our devoted necks!</L>
<L>Humble the <HI>boasters,</HI> who repose their strength,</L>
<L>Not on <HI>thy</HI> arm, but in their own frail numbers!</L>
<L>To Thee! O God of Battles! we appeal.</L>
<L>Hear, hear our voice!"—When lo! from Heaven's bright concave,</L>
<L>In gracious intimation, that their prayers,</L>
<L>Wafted by guardian spirits, reach'd the throne,</L>
<L>A mighty peal of thunder rapt their ears,</L>
<L>And purple lightnings quiver in the sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Arragons,</HI> with hopes thus sanctified,</L>
<L>Rush'd from the temples, like impetuous flames;</L>
<L>—Or like fierce tigers, who their destin'd prey</L>
<L>At distance see; and pant, and foam, and rage,</L>
<L>With pride of certain conquest. But their prince</L>
<L>Strove this incautious ardor to restrain.</L>
<L>—All-bounteous Heav'n, he cry'd, by <HI>means,</HI> not <HI>miracles,</HI></L>
<L>Decides the fate of armies, and of kings.</L>
<L>Let prudent foresight, then, direct your aims,</L>
<L>Lest rashness blights the harvest of your courage!</L>
<L>The haughty <HI>Moors,</HI> contemptuous of our strength,</L>
<L>Doubtless expect to see our opening gates</L>
<L>Receive them, masters, at the trumpet's signal:</L>
<L>To aid their blindness, we will offers make,</L>
<L>Of terms too humble for a state in freedom,</L>
<L>And yet too high for Conqu'rors to accept.</L>
<L>Then, in the night's meridian, when no star,</L>
<L>With tell-tale beams upon our polish'd mail,</L>
<L>Shall shew us to the watchful centinel,</L>
<L>—Then will we rouse the lion from his den,</L>
<L>And prove our courage worthy of our cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The humming notes of growing apprchation,</L>
<L>Like distant thunder, gaining on the ear,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
Broke forth at once into applausive shouts.</L>
<L>Live! live the King! re-echoed ev'ry mouth;</L>
<L>O guard my People! said the heart-touch'd King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The heralds sent, and their misleading terms,</L>
<L>To blind, with fears unfelt, the <HI>Moorish</HI> camp,</L>
<L>All now prepare, for the wish'd hour of onset.</L>
<L>The sounding anvils beat their clanging music;</L>
<L>Peace-rusted swords regain their edge and polish;</L>
<L>The nervous archer tries his idle bow,</L>
<L>And gives new plumage to his missile darts.</L>
<L>The matrons, virgins, catch the martial fire:</L>
<L><HI>These</HI> songs prepare, <HI>these</HI> rosy garlands twine,</L>
<L>To greet, on their return, the conqu'ring heroes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, 'mongst the virgins, <HI>one</HI> sad heart was found;</L>
<L>'Twas in the bosom of the royal Princess.</L>
<L>Her vows, her plighted troth, had long been given</L>
<L>To young MONTENOS, Duke <HI>Medina</HI>'s Heir.</L>
<L>He, only he, could melt her icy breast;</L>
<L>—None could so well deserve an untouch'd heart.</L>
<L>His mind, more noble than his princely birth,</L>
<L>Lent glory to his name: matchless his form!</L>
<L>As poets feign celestial Virtue wears,</L>
<L>When visible to man. Oh! wonder not,</L>
<L>The Princess lov'd with strength no common flame</L>
<L>Could have inspir'd! Her soul was full of love:</L>
<L>She liv'd, she breath'd, she thought, but for MONTENOS.</L>
<L>Ten thousand terrors now besieg'd her soul;</L>
<L>Ten thousand <HI>nothings,</HI> which her fancy drest</L>
<L>In colour, substance, circumstance, and form.</L>
<L>Yet, from her lover, 'twas her care to hide</L>
<L>The tender weakness which her heart confest.</L>
<L>Shall <HI>I,</HI> she cry'd, a mighty kingdom's heir,</L>
<L>Shew terrors that the humbler maids despise?</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="17"/>
My Country rocks upon a precipice.</L>
<L>—Go then, MONTENOS! prop her falling state!</L>
<L>Repel th'invader! tread on Slav'ry's neck!</L>
<L>And 'mongst her dear preservers be thou <HI>Chief!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The shades of eve advance, and from the camp</L>
<L>The subtle messengers return—return</L>
<L>With insult loaded, and contemptuous threats.</L>
<L>No less the <HI>Moors</HI> demand than general vassalage;</L>
<L>That <HI>conquer'd</HI> Arragon—so proud their style!</L>
<L>Should yield them homage, and perpetual tribute.</L>
<L>A <HI>day</HI> they grant us to resolve on slavery,</L>
<L>—To turn apostates, and revolt from Heaven,</L>
<L>Or see our towers extended in the dust.</L>
<L>No terms or messengers they will receive;</L>
<L>But open'd gates, and crescents on our spires,</L>
<L>The <HI>answer</HI> they expect. This lofty menace</L>
<L>Less with surprise than anger was receiv'd;</L>
<L>—It spoke the spirit of the fierce invaders.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some hours—tremendous pause! were yet to pass</L>
<L>Between this period, and that meant for action:</L>
<L>Gloomy suspence sat brooding o'er the army,</L>
<L>And <HI>hid,</HI> not <HI>damp'd,</HI> the ardor of their courage.</L>
<L>All, self-collected, seem'd retir'd within,</L>
<L>And the full mind had render'd language mute.</L>
<L>At this grand moment, when no thought of aid,</L>
<L>—Of human aid, had glanc'd across the soul,</L>
<L>In from the Western gate—like bees returning</L>
<L>From their diurnal circuit—rush'd amain</L>
<L>Ten thousand sons of war. At this bless'd sight,</L>
<L>Such transport seiz'd the citizens, and troops,</L>
<L>It seem'd triumphant holiday, and joy</L>
<L>Would even in frolic sport—so sudden the effect.</L>
<L>To <HI>Leon</HI>'s King we ow'd this grateful succour:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>
He heard the <HI>Moors</HI> were hov'ring on our coasts,</L>
<L>And, as a <HI>Christian</HI> king, the cause adopted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the streets, choak'd up with armed men,</L>
<L>Pour back their warriors through the Western portal:</L>
<L>There, in the marshy vale, that to the North</L>
<L>Extends its rich campaign, the army grew</L>
<L>In form. Pardon if I, a simple Maid,</L>
<L>Cannot relate, Sir Knight! in artful terms,</L>
<L><HI>How,</HI> in <HI>what order</HI> grew. I have not skill</L>
<L>To use the phrases chance hath giv'n mine ear▪</L>
<L>Were I to speak of <HI>flank,</HI> and <HI>rear,</HI> and <HI>van,</HI></L>
<L>You'd find my tongue to wild confusion lead.</L>
<L>—Learn then but this: the King the centre kept;</L>
<L>MONTENOS, stately pine! led on the front.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Stranger <HI>bow'd</HI> reply, in mute respect.</L>
<L>OSMIDA, gently pausing, thus resum'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tender Twilight, which till now had look'd</L>
<L>With timid eye upon the martial plain,</L>
<L>Withdrew her beam, to follow distant day:</L>
<L>Night, oft invok'd, advanc'd her ebon standard,</L>
<L>To which all Nature yields well-pleas'd obeisance:</L>
<L>But iron War, scornful of Nature's laws,</L>
<L>Makes Rest his captive, and the ear of Silence</L>
<L>Frequent invades, whilst from the throne of Night,</L>
<L>Coëval pow'r! she rules the drowsy world.</L>
<L>So <HI>now</HI> through <HI>Arragonia</HI>'s streets, his march</L>
<L>—Unmeasur'd by the drum's imperious notes,</L>
<L>In aweful pomp he takes. Balconies crouded</L>
<L>Show'r down their blessings as the soldiers pass,</L>
<L>Whilst thousand voices spend themselves in pray'r,</L>
<L>And thousand ardent eyes appeal to Heaven.</L>
</LG>

<L>The gates shut close their wide-extended jaws,</L>

<L>The Infidels, alarm'd, seem all in motion,</L>
<L>Whilst the faint quiv'ring lights, that lately serv'd</L>
<L>To guide the hunters in their dang'rous chace,</L>

<L>Silence, no longer useful, now gives way</L>

<L>The haughty trumpet, and the vig'rous drum,</L>
<L>With the shrill fife's acuter voice, accord</L>

No orders thought on, and no orders heard:</L>

<L>Onward they rush—whilst deathful fury bursts</L>
<L>In livid sparkles from their blood-red eyes;</L>
<L>They gore the gen'rous steeds, their riders crush,</L>
<L>Or send them clashing through the dusty air.</L>
<L>Throughout the concave, sound the eager plaudits,</L>

<L>Just so MONTENOS shone among the heroes</L>
<L>Whose bitter chastisement the <HI>Moors</HI> endured.</L>

<L>Made to his mistress this heroic gift.</L>
<L>Oh fatal present! gift replete with woes!</L>
<L>Why did not heaven in its mercy send</L>

<L>The terms accepted, gallies were dispatch'd</L>

<L>Give me your Daughter! I'll give <HI>her</HI> a throne:</L>

<L>With all its boasted fields, and blushing vineyards,</L>

<L>Whose sceptre I command! The King's firm answer</L>
<L>Shew'd the proud Infidel, his suit was vain;</L>

<L>ZORADOR's fury to such transports grew</L>
<L>At this destruction of his hopes, he seem'd</L>

<L>Oh, spare me then the horror of a sight</L>
<L>My fiery brain splits but to think on! Save,</L>

<L>Our speedy couriers brought, the word was given</L>
<L>To make all ready for the royal marriage.</L>
<L>Raptur'd MONTENOS, madd'ning with his bliss,</L>
<L>Could scarce support the intermediate hours</L>
<L>That led, with lagging steps, the nuptial morn.</L>
<L>The nuptial Morn arriv'd—rous'd from her slumbers</L>
<L>By the shrill voice of silver clarions, join'd</L>
<L>By the soft hautboy, the seducive lute,</L>
<L>And sweeter pipe of choral maids, symphonious.</L>
<L>Forth from the palace to the church, through streets</L>
<L>With carpets laid, and myrtle garlands hung,</L>
<L>The glad procession led its length'ning train.</L>
<L>The King, beneath his canopy of state,</L>
<L>Preceded by his guards, first object mov'd:</L>
<L>Next to his suite the Princess, blushing, follow'd;</L>
<L>Her train upheld by twenty noble maids,</L>
<L>Whose beauty, in their snowy robes, seem'd chastity</L>
<L>Incarnate. Next, at distance—as of rank</L>
<L>That yet allow'd not of a royal state,</L>
<L>MONTENOS walk'd, succeeded by the court.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
<L>The King had almost reach'd the holy portals,</L>
<L>When from the croud a youth advanc'd, who caught</L>
<L>Each wond'ring eye. His face, a mask—design'd</L>
<L>For youthful beauty, hid. His airy form</L>
<L>Seem'd worthy such a face. His habit tissue,</L>
<L>Emboss'd with purple studs. His flowing hair</L>
<L>With knots of pearl was ty'd, and on his head</L>
<L>A garland bloom'd. An iv'ry flute he held,</L>
<L>Through which he breath'd such melting, touching, strains,</L>
<L>That Harmony herself had staid to listen.</L>
<L>As he approach'd, the soldiers clear'd his way,</L>
<L>Till in the front before the guards he stood.</L>
<L>The Princess came, whilst he, with rev'rence low,</L>
<L>And softer breathings, seem'd to great her presence.</L>
<L>She pass'd; the Bridegroom came—in quicker notes</L>
<L>He bad his music flow; and, forward stepping,</L>
<L>Offer'd, with courteous air, the tuneful pipe.</L>
<L>MONTENOS, smiling, stretch'd his hand, when—horror!</L>
<L>His breast receiv'd the flute, which hid a poniard—</L>
<L>—A second blow, ere thought could be recall'd;</L>
<L>The third, the murd'rer on himself bestow'd,</L>
<L>And welt'ring dropt into the arms of Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Astonishment usurp'd each vital faculty,</L>
<L>And rooted all who saw the bloody deed.</L>
<L>The Bridegroom, sinking on th'assassin's corps,</L>
<L>Rous'd from their trance his horror-struck attendants;</L>
<L>Whilst the chill sounds of Death! Montenos! Murder!</L>
<L>Fled to the wretched Maid—almost a wife.</L>
<L>Not daring to demand the cause; her pulse,</L>
<L>Stopt by congealing fear, forbore its office,</L>
<L>And a kind stupor hid her from her woes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
<L>Back to the palace, now, the dying Bridegroom,</L>
<L>By Knights in hymeneal robes was borne,</L>
<L>Whilst others dragg'd his murd'rer's mangled corps,</L>
<L>To search for motives to the cruel deed.</L>
<L>His mask unclasp'd, disclos'd a well-known face</L>
<L>—A mute he was, and in ZORADOR's train.</L>
<L>A fiend-like scroll, conceal'd within his vest,</L>
<L>Develop'd all the murd'rous hell-born project.</L>
<L>These were its words: "'Tis not the slave, but <HI>I,</HI></L>
<L>Who give the blow. <HI>Vengeance,</HI> if not my <HI>love,</HI></L>
<L>Shall be appeas'd. Learn, King of <HI>Arragon!</HI></L>
<L>Learn both to know and dread the scorn'd ZORADOR!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such were the lines which bore the stamp of fate.</L>
<L>The lovely victim of the <HI>Moor</HI>'s revenge,</L>
<L>Breath'd not a word, but strain'd his beamless eye</L>
<L>To find the object that his heart's last pulse</L>
<L>Ador'd—not seeing her, they seem'd to shut</L>
<L>All others out—and Death, with hasty seal,</L>
<L>Clos'd their dim lids in everlasting sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here paus'd the Virgin, as immers'd in thought;</L>
<L>The story, fraught with woe, had cast a shade</L>
<L>Of deeper sorrow o'er her pensive brow:</L>
<L>Her lab'ring bosom sent forth heavy sighs,</L>
<L>And her sad mind seem'd lost in one idea.</L>
<L>The Knight, who eager grew to know the tale</L>
<L>She promis'd of <HI>herself,</HI> presum'd at length</L>
<L>To bring her recollection to the point;</L>
<L>At which her rosy lips their portal clos'd,</L>
<L>And ceas'd to charm him with their touching accents.</L>

<L>I will not, Stranger! said the fair narrator,</L>

The Court's distress, the sorrow of the King,</L>
<L>The Bride's, th'unwedded Bride's, forlorn distraction.</L>
<L>Long tedious months led round their joyless suns,</L>
<L>Ere comfort beam'd upon her widow'd heart;</L>
<L>Nor <HI>then,</HI> till, at the tomb of her lost Lord,</L>
<L>Her solemn vows she made, never to hear</L>
<L>A lover's soothing tale; but, in virginity</L>
<L>Perpetual, wait the hour that should unite</L>
<L>Her faithful spirit with her murder'd Lord's.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This duty paid, a dawn, like that of peace,</L>
<L>By soft degrees illum'd the mourner's mind.</L>
<L>The Court, prompt in expedients to divest</L>
<L>Misfortune of her stings, ransack'd all pleasures,</L>
<L>Invented fresh delights, new joys invok'd,</L>
<L>For their sweet antidotes to pois'nous grief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus had two years their slow-revolving hours</L>
<L>Brought to the great account; when from the east</L>
<L>A dark portentous cloud, lab'ring with ills,</L>
<L>Pregnant with thousand woes, obscur'd th'horizon.</L>
<L>ZORADOR—he whose soul from inmost hell</L>
<L>Was sent to scourge the earth—not glutted yet</L>
<L>With all the horrid joys that wait on vengeance,</L>
<L>Not yet forgiving our triumphant arms,</L>
<L>Which shear'd the laurels his whole life had reap'd,</L>
<L>—Again came pouring, like a mighty deluge,</L>
<L>To overwhelm the land in lasting ruin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He came.—Why should I lengthen out my tale?</L>
<L>Our nation's force, oppos'd to the <HI>Moor</HI>'s army,</L>
<L>Was kindling torches to obscure the sun.</L>
<L>Again we saw them hover on the hill:</L>
<L>Again we saw—like famine-bringing locusts,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="32"/>
Their hosts descend, and spread upon the plain.</L>
<L>No parly, as at first, they would allow:</L>
<L>Their batt'ring-rams the messengers they us'd;</L>
<L>—Arrows and catapults, their <HI>killing</HI> words.</L>
<L>A dreadful day our troops sustain'd the siege,</L>
<L>And fill'd the breaches with their slaughter'd foes.</L>
<L>At length, a billet on a javelin's point</L>
<L>The ramparts pass'd, denouncing rape and sackage,</L>
<L>If stubbornly our citizens delay'd</L>
<L>To own ZORADOR conqueror and king.</L>
<L>The threat effected all the <HI>Moor</HI> had hop'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Arragon</HI>'s grey Monarch was abandon'd</L>
<L>By those whose rights he'd guarded with his blood,</L>
<L>—By those his smiles had cherish'd, and his honours grac'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The throneless Sov'reign, when he saw his gates</L>
<L>Open their faithless jaws t'admit the foe,</L>
<L>Rush'd, in distraction, to his Daughter's chamber:</L>
<L>Fly! let us instant fly! he gasping said;</L>
<L>The <HI>Moors</HI> have vanquish'd, and my Child's a slave.</L>
<L>Their standards now insult our conquer'd streets,</L>
<L>And curst ZORADOR will not long delay,</L>

<L>Come then, my Daughter! lest dishonour find thee,</L>
<L>And kill they parent with a thousand deaths!</L>
<L>The Princess, whom affliction had subdu'd,</L>
<L>And taught a firmness stranger to her years,</L>

<L>Where Providence ordains! my duteous steps</L>
<L>Shall ever follow yours, soften your path,</L>
<L>And chear, to life's last sigh, your rugged journey.</L>

<L>A golden casket, as she spoke, she seiz'd,</L>
<L>That held, till now, a hoarded useless treasure;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="33"/>
And through the galleries, with breathless haste,</L>
<L>And step precipitate, follow'd the King,</L>
<L>—Unknowing to what corner of the earth</L>
<L>To point their feet, or whom they should intrust</L>
<L>With their advent'rous flight. A faithful Lord,</L>
<L>In this sad exigence, with cordial words,</L>
<L>The royal fugitives thus met and cheer'd.</L>
<L>"O Sire! from <HI>Arlos</HI> take the only duty</L>
<L>That stormy fate now suffers him to pay:</L>

<L>Dreading the worst, I had prepar'd this refuge,</L>

<L>For <HI>me,</HI> I'll stay and greet, with smiles deceitful,</L>
<L>ZORADOR, whom I hate, to ward, if possible,</L>

<L>The King embrac'd, with servent gratitude,</L>
<L>The noble youth—and follow'd where he led.</L>
<L>There a close chariot, harness'd and attended,</L>
<L>Waited to bear them from the dang'rous spot.</L>
<L>The flying steeds seem'd conscious of their office,</L>
<L>And instant cleft the air with eagle swiftness.</L>
<L>Mean while the <HI>Moorish</HI> troops rush'd through the gates,</L>
<L>And on our bulwarks fix'd their haughty standards.</L>
<L>No terms the citizens obtain'd, but those</L>
<L>Of vassalage and uncondition'd slavery;</L>
<L>Whilst their chief officers were instant sworn</L>
<L>To be allegiant to the swarthy Infidel.</L>
<L>Mean time, with speed, towards the royal palace,</L>
<L>As to his home, ZORADOR bent his course;</L>
<L>Vaunting, that now the <HI>Christian</HI> King should, kneeling,</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="34"/>
<HI>Ask</HI> him to wed the Daughter whom he woo'd</L>
<L>With offer'd thrones, and was, with scorn, rejected.</L>
<L>But, when he found no Sov'reign to insult,</L>
<L>No Princess to affront with odious passion,</L>
<L>His furious transports made a thousand victims.</L>
<L>The Nobles' houses were with strictness search'd:</L>
<L>The churches, monast'ries, were all defil'd</L>
<L>By the unhallow'd infidels, in vain.</L>
<L>Three days the search continu'd, when the <HI>Moor,</HI></L>
<L>Foaming with disappointed pride, made oath,</L>
<L>That, if the Princess in eight days appear'd not,</L>
<L>The convents-walls should to the ground be ras'd,</L>
<L>And their pure vestals sate his savage soldiers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These dreadful tidings to the King and Princess</L>
<L>The faithful ARLOS sent. "My castle walls,"</L>
<L>He said, "no longer will protect my Sov'reign.</L>
<L>The church itself will aid the keen pursuit,</L>
<L>—Deeming it better that one royal Maid</L>

<L>The darkest robe of night o'erspread the hemisphere,</L>
<L>When at the castle GONZALES arriv'd.</L>
<L>The royal pair, in humble weeds disguis'd,</L>
<L>Instant forsook the hospitable roof,</L>
<L>And sought untravell'd wilds, and gloomy deserts.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="35"/>
The spirits of the King, weigh'd down with sorrow,</L>
<L>Had sunk beneath accumulated ills,</L>
<L>Had not wise Heav'n endu'd his Daughter's mind</L>
<L>With strength to bear <HI>her</HI> griefs, and chear her Father's.</L>
<L>With tender talk the tedious way she shorten'd;</L>
<L>And, when exhausted Nature ask'd recruit,</L>
<L>Hymn'd him to sleep beneath umbrageous trees.</L>
<L>A whole day's sun beheld her duteous cares:</L>
<L>The moon arose, and still they journey'd on;</L>
<L>But the succeeding sun, with earliest beam,</L>
<L>Guided the travellers to a forest's verge.</L>
<L>Here GONZALES the steeds unrein'd, and drove,</L>
<L>In envied freedom, to a neighb'ring mountain,</L>
<L>Lest their betraying hoofs should guide pursuers</L>
<L>To the asylum of the hunted King.</L>
<L>In the wood's centre they a cottage found,</L>
<L>Form'd, by Misfortune's hand, of humble clay:</L>
<L>Two rooms it had, in each a rustic bed;</L>
<L>For stately chairs, a bench; a rough-hewn table,</L>
<L>That ne'er with other dainties had been fill'd,</L>
<L>Than labour cull'd from the surrounding herbs;</L>
<L>Or from the vines—that in the desert air,</L>

<L>Such the retreat the fugitives had found.</L>

<L>Adieu to greatness, and unhealthful pomp!</L>
<L>The winds now rustle through their straw-crown'd cot,</L>
<L>And birds, with wild-note sweet, compose their concert!</L>
<L>Full seven slow moons have turn'd their monthly orbs,</L>
<L>Since GONZALES the cottage left, and since</L>
<L>No human sound, but their own pensive tones,</L>

What can I more? If my eventful tale</L>
<L>Hath touch'd the chords of pity in your heart,</L>

<L>Enough! exclaim'd</L>
<L>The Knight, springing with ardor from the bank,</L>
<L>Enough! our prize is found! and wealth and rank,</L>
<L>And bright ZULEDA's smiles, are now DE COURCI's!</L>
<L>Thus speaking, to his lips he fix'd a bugle,</L>
<L>Whose piercing sounds ten thousand echoes bore</L>
<L>On airy wings, through the surrounding woods.</L>
<L>The signal heard, six <HI>Moors</HI> obey'd its voice,</L>
<L>And spurr'd their horses headlong through the glades.</L>
<L>For these OSMIDA stay'd not. The false Knight</L>
<L>No sooner spoke his joy, than, like a fawn</L>
<L>Who from the neighb'ring thicket hears the voice.</L>
<L>Of the fierce wolf—she bounding left her seat,</L>
<L>And fled to safer shades. A starting star</L>
<L>Less rapid cleaves the air, when <HI>Ethiop</HI> Night</L>

<L>Meanwhile, the royal cottager, whom Sleep,</L>

<L>Broke from her tempting arms. He call'd OSMIDA.</L>
<L>List'ning in vain, to hear her cheering voice,</L>
<L>He started from his couch, and, rob'd in haste,</L>
<L>Rush'd forth to seek her in her fav'rite haunts:</L>
<L>Darting his fearful eye across the lawn</L>
<L>On which their cottage stood, close on its edge,</L>

<L><PB N="32" REF="37"/>
He hasten'd to receive her. What his dread!</L>
<L>When at his feet he saw the Princess drop,</L>

<L>Father! ALMANZOR! King!—The fear-struck Monarch,</L>
<L>Unable from the mossy grass to raise</L>
<L>Its lovely burden, sinking by her side,</L>
<L>Strove by his tears, and fond paternal voice,</L>
<L>To rouse her torpid sense, and wake her soul.</L>
<L>Not guessing at th'extremity of woe,</L>

<L>But, oh! how short a while his fate allow'd</L>
<L>This soft delusion! Through the night's still air</L>

<L>Call'd her OSMIDA—yet my eager tongue</L>
<L>I dar'd not with that hope intrust, lest Fear</L>

<L>Conceals the trembler, and her aged Sire.</L>
<L>I mark'd the road she took, and now will guide you</L>
<L>To those who will not hail us<HI>—welcome</HI> guests.</L>
<L>Thus speaking, he push'd onwards through the wood,</L>
<L>And soon espy'd the little peaceful dwelling,</L>
<L>In which, for seven long months, the exil'd King</L>
<L>Had sigh'd his anguish to the passing winds.</L>

The only boon I can descend to ask,</L>

<L>Or thou shalt find, that in a desert, old,</L>

<L>His harsh command! tear us asunder! yes!</L>
<L>Drag from the old man's heart, the last sole joy</L>
<L>His woes had left to save him from despair.</L>
<L>Plunge me at once in horror's deep abyss.</L>
<L>Not long—not long, my friends, will you afflict me.</L>
<L>A show'r of tears, that down his furrow'd cheeks</L>
<L>Upon the bosom of OSMIDA fell,</L>
<L>Ended a speech—which men steel'd by long use</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="42"/>
Against the touching voice of heav'n-born pity,</L>
<L>Could not unsoften'd hear; but strove to palliate</L>
<L>To their own hearts, in coarse-spun sophistry,</L>
<L>The baseness of their voluntary task.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sprightly <HI>Aurora</HI> looking through the clouds,</L>
<L>Which blush'd with pleasure at her near approach,</L>
<L>Chas'd from the hemisphere the pale-ey'd moon,</L>
<L>—Who had so sweetly shone, she seem'd 'till now</L>
<L>The morning's counterfeit. But Oh! to mis'ry</L>
<L>Whether the pale-ey'd Moon, or sprightly Morn,</L>
<L>Or Sun refulgent leads the passing hours;</L>
<L>All, all alike, they undistinguish'd roll,</L>
<L>One cheerless chaos, one impervious gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to DE COURCI, and the wond'ring <HI>Moors,</HI></L>
<L>OSMIDA lovely seem'd—how lovely now!</L>
<L>When bright'ning day disclos'd her to their view,</L>
<L>One blaze of charms—charms of that tender cast,</L>
<L>Which sorrow did not sully, but become!</L>
<L>Her polish'd form was graceful as the antelope's;</L>
<L>Her air majestic, as the sailing eagle's—</L>
<L>When 'mongst the fleecy clouds he gently waves,</L>
<L>And views high <HI>Skiddaw,</HI> like a shrub below.</L>
<L>Her face a <HI>Raphael</HI> would have caught, to form</L>
<L>A young <HI>Madonna,</HI> bending o'er her Child</L>
<L>With brow serene, and love-distilling eyes.</L>
<L>Her locks—such locks as Nature only gives</L>
<L>Once in an age, to perfect some rare beauty,</L>
<L>Seem'd like a golden veil—part hung before,</L>
<L>Shading a polish'd neck; which look'd, between</L>
<L>The burnish'd threads, like purest ivory</L>
<L>Through gilded net-work: part the Zephyrs snatch'd,</L>
<L>Playing enamour'd in the beauteous toils:</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="43"/>
The rest in dropping ringlets fell behind,</L>
<L>And kiss'd the foldings of her flowing robe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was the Princess; whom a <HI>Moor</HI> now seiz'd,</L>
<L>And on DE COURCI's steed securely fix'd.</L>
<L>A silken sash, held by the treach'rous Knight,</L>
<L>Pass'd through OSMIDA's girdle, and enchain'd</L>
<L>The mourning Virgin, and her deadliest foe.</L>
<L>Upon another steed was plac'd ALMANZOR,</L>
<L>Behind a guiding <HI>Moor.</HI> This was the state</L>
<L>The kingdom's Monarch, and the kingdom's Heir,</L>
<L>Were now constrain'd to use. No pompous guards,</L>
<L>No blessing populace, no proud grandees,</L>
<L>Their steps attend;—but oh! how small <HI>that</HI> grief,</L>
<L>Weigh'd with the horrid fears, the tort'ring doubts,</L>
<L>Which fill their bosoms, and absorb their thoughts!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The leafy desert—which so long had seem'd</L>
<L>A cheerless prison to th' illustrious pair</L>
<L>—They quit, with aching hearts, and heavy sighs.</L>
<L>Its solitary shades—how welcome, now!</L>
<L>Its humble turf-form'd cot, its devious glades,</L>
<L>Its choral groves, they would with rapture greet,</L>
<L>And hail them, as the dear abodes of Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But these they have for ever—ever left;</L>
<L>And soon the forest's verdant roof grows dun</L>
<L>Upon the distant eye. The eager <HI>Moors,</HI></L>
<L>With spur and slacken'd reins, kept pouring on,</L>
<L>Leaving whole leagues obscur'd with floating dust.</L>
<L>The royal Prisoners, scarcely with a glance,</L>
<L>Can speak a thought, much less converse, and share,</L>
<L>With kind participance, each other's woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus they continued through untrodden wilds,</L>
<L>Whose savage echoes never yet had learnt</L>
<L>To imitate the cordial voice of man:</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="44"/>
—The churning boar, and howling midnight wolves,</L>
<L>Had taught them all the language that they knew.</L>
<L>At length the Sun, behind the western mountains,</L>
<L>Hid his pervading eye: the humid Eve</L>
<L>Led on her deep'ning shades, to quench the thirst,</L>
<L>The fev'rish orb had left, on plants and flow'rs.</L>
<L>The <HI>Moors</HI> now strain their wistful eyes,</L>
<L>To meet some woodland, or some shelt'ring cave,</L>
<L>In which to court their strength-restoring sleep.</L>
<L>The last they found—it seem'd t'have been the haunt</L>
<L>Of fierce banditti—or more peaceful home</L>
<L>Of some sequester'd hermit; for its floor</L>
<L>The chissel's edge had smooth'd, and its low roof</L>
<L>Was rudely fashion'd to a semi-dome.</L>
<L>Here the sad trav'lers were allow'd the rest</L>
<L>Which through the fervid day they'd ask'd in vain.</L>
<L>The Princess, whose soft limbs were not inur'd</L>
<L>To such extreme fatigue, sunk lifeless down,</L>
<L>Soon as her feet had touch'd the solid earth.</L>
<L>The aged King, with scarce <HI>more</HI> strength, approach'd</L>
<L>To catch his falling Child—The flinty floor</L>
<L>Receiv'd them both—OSMIDA and her Sire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With care officious, the attending slaves</L>
<L>The duties of humanity perform'd.</L>
<L>The Princess they recover'd; and a spot,</L>
<L>With their own garments, spread, to form a seat</L>
<L>Less rig'rous than the rock, for its high inmates.</L>
<L>Parch'd corn, sun-candied grapes, and racy wine,</L>
<L>They plac'd, respectfully, before the King:</L>
<L>Exhausted Nature crav'd the cordial draught;</L>
<L>Whilst to her Sire's request OSMIDA yielded,</L>
<L>And of the patriarchal feast partook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
<L>DE COURCI and the <HI>Moors</HI> dar'd not resign</L>
<L>Their heavy lids to sleep, but in rotation.</L>
<L>Two, the cave's entrance guarded; and the third,</L>
<L>Plac'd near ALMANZOR, interruption gave,</L>
<L>Whene'er the royal Parent and his Child</L>
<L>Strove to beguile the melancholy hours</L>
<L>With such sad converse as their griefs allow'd.</L>
<L>This had ZORADOR order'd, lest OSMIDA</L>
<L>Should from her Father catch more fortitude</L>
<L>T'oppose his furious passion, than he thought</L>
<L>A female could possess. Celestial chastity</L>
<L>He held a phantom bred from Custom's laws,</L>
<L>And that the magic of licentious love</L>
<L>Could melt its airy form—for now he meant</L>
<L>T'assert a conqu'ror's rights, and place the Princess</L>
<L>—Not on a Throne, but 'mongst his fav'rite slaves,</L>
<L>And make her Sov'reign of his loose seraglio.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Constrain'd to silence; Sorrow's blest physician</L>
<L>Stole by degrees upon their aching eyes.</L>
<L>O soft enchanter, Sleep! why did Idolaters</L>
<L>Ne'er build thee temples? Thee, whose sweet dominion</L>
<L>Boundless extends, wherever Nature breathes!</L>
<L>Thee, in whose arms Anguish forgets her throbs;</L>
<L>Chill Want, the nipping blast; and wild Despair</L>
<L>Finds gleams of comfort—I sing Paeans to thee, Sleep!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had the mettled coursers of the Morn</L>
<L>Brought her gay chariot to th'horizon's edge,</L>
<L>And coif'd the mountains with her ruddy gold,</L>
<L>—Ere prompt DE COURCI, and the watching <HI>Moors,</HI></L>
<L>Flew to caparison their grazing steeds.</L>
<L>Returning quick, they rous'd their torpid fellows,</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="46"/>
And last awak'd OSMIDA and the King.</L>
<L>What an awakening! Touch not, O my pen!</L>
<L>Upon the catching theme! Of woe enamour'd,</L>
<L>Thou'lt hang too long upon the tears, the sighs,</L>
<L>The grief-fraught words, with which they hail'd the day.</L>
<L>—Events more active ask thy little skill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some hours they had pursu'd their steady course,</L>
<L>When, from a coppice bord'ring on the road,</L>
<L>An armed troop rush'd forth. So quick their motion,</L>
<L>DE COURCI's band, ere they beheld their danger,</L>
<L>Were in a circle drawn—more dreadfully portentous,</L>
<L>Than wand of witch or wizard ever form'd.</L>
<L>The gallant Knight, who at his girdle wore</L>
<L>Unwilling beauty, seem'd at once the object.</L>
<L>Three vizor'd warriors at his stirrups stood;</L>
<L>Two held their lances to his throat; the third</L>
<L>Destroy'd the magic zone which held the Princess,</L>
<L>And snatch'd her instant from DE COURCI's side.</L>
<L>With such dispatch was this atchievement made,</L>
<L>The Knight had scarcely drawn to save his prize,</L>
<L>Ere he beheld her ravish'd from his arms</L>
<L>—And at a distance from th'astonish'd troop.</L>
<L>Turning, with fury, on his foes—who thus</L>
<L>Had all his splendid hopes reft from his heart,</L>
<L>He rais'd his arm, and aim'd a pond'rous sword,</L>
<L>Where guiltless it could not have fall'n; when instant</L>
<L>His unpois'd body, with Herculean force,</L>
<L>Was to the earth propell'd: breathless he lay,</L>
<L>And trampling steeds soon fix'd him to the spot,</L>
<L>From whence th'unhappy youth ne'er rose again.</L>
<L>The <HI>Moors,</HI> undaunted at their leader's fate,</L>
<L>Sustain'd th'assailant's shock, as if resolv'd</L>
<L>Their pris'ners and their lives should both be lost,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="47"/>
Or undivided kept. Two forc'd their way</L>
<L>Towards the spot where, guarded by her Knight,</L>
<L>The Princess stood; three of the foe pursu'd,</L>
<L>And made the path which led to her, the road</L>
<L>To death inglorious. The remaining <HI>Saracens</HI></L>
<L>Fought as those fight, who, knowing they must die,</L>
<L>Resolve the victors shall buy conquest dearly.</L>
<L>But he who at his crupper held the King,</L>
<L>More fiercely than the rest—more madly fought.</L>
<L>His fellows too hemm'd in the struggling Monarch;</L>
<L>And, turning to the Prince their horses haunches,</L>
<L>Form'd with their spears a threat'ning glory round him.</L>
<L>When he who held him—watching for the moment,</L>
<L>Broke from the rest, and on the distant winds</L>
<L>Seem'd borne away. The demon who presides</L>
<L>O'er evil acts, and aids the deeds that most</L>
<L>Partake of Hell—surely his steed impell'd,</L>
<L>And brac'd his sinews with unnatural vigor.</L>
<L>His fiery eye, darting o'er hills and plains,</L>
<L>Scarcely outstripp'd his hoofs; the vales, the woods,</L>
<L>His glance devour'd, were in an instant left</L>
<L>Behind his feath'ry heels, that onward prest—</L>
<L>Whilst the pursuing, stretching, mad'ning foe,</L>
<L>Beheld new hills, new plains, new woods, arise</L>
<L>Between their coursers and their ravish'd Prince.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Meanwhile OSMIDA, in amazement lost,</L>
<L>Beheld herself unchain'd, and yet not free.</L>
<L>Those who had held her pris'ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, she saw slain;</L>
<L>But who are these, who risk, thus gallantly,</L>
<L>Their lives for her and the dethroned King?</L>
<L>Perchance new masters; perhaps again they're slaves.</L>
<L>Scarce had this question, in her whirl of thought,</L>
<L>Had time to firm itself, ere at her side</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="48"/>
She saw the noble ARLOS.—Hence! vain fears.</L>
<L>The magic touch of hope her bosom swell'd,</L>
<L>And confidence chac'd ev'ry doubt away.</L>
<L>Raising the snowy veil which hid her face,</L>
<L>She beam'd a smile upon the loyal Knight,</L>
<L>That in his mind o'erpaid ten thousand dangers.</L>
<L>Fly, my best ARLOS! said the charming maid,</L>
<L>(As at her feet he knelt) and save the King!</L>
<L>See where he sits, unarm'd, amidst his foes!</L>
<L>Were <HI>he</HI> in safety, all my thoughts were peace.</L>
<L>The Knight up-springing, staid not to reply,</L>
<L>But instant hors'd, spurr'd onward to his troop:</L>
<L>His troop he join'd, but not till the rich prize</L>
<L>He flew to save, was ravish'd from his hopes.</L>
<L>Three of the band he instantly dispatch'd,</L>
<L>To stop the progress of the flying <HI>Saracen.</HI></L>
<L>The few remaining <HI>Moors,</HI> urg'd by despair,</L>
<L>Still madly fought, preferring present death</L>
<L>To the slow tortures, which they knew their Tyrant</L>
<L>Would fail not to inflict, on those who lost</L>
<L>The beauteous object of his brutal love.</L>
<L>Their wish they soon receiv'd, and their freed spirits</L>
<L>Sought the eternal shores. The Princess now</L>
<L>Remain'd sole object of the cares of ARLOS.</L>
<L>With eager speed he sought the trembling maid,</L>
<L>Who saw her Parent borne o'er distant wilds,</L>
<L>And in that sight lost ev'ry new-born comfort.</L>
<L>Her tears bedew'd the senseless earth; her cries</L>
<L>Rent Heaven, and her unconscious feet mov'd quick</L>
<L>Towards the course, in which she saw her Father.</L>
<L>ARLOS, in soothing terms, implor'd the fair-one</L>
<L>To moderate her grief. Doubtless, he cried,</L>
<L>The gallant youths, who now pursue the <HI>Moor,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="49"/>
Will not pursue the flying slave in vain.</L>
<L>They know the mazy roads—each devious path,</L>
<L>Each secret turning—and will meet the villain</L>
<L>When least he can suspect his danger. Now,</L>
<L>Sweet Princess! to my castle let me lead you.</L>
<L>There, if not happier, yet at least securely</L>
<L>Your tears you may indulge, and feed your sorrows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce sensible to what was urg'd, OSMIDA</L>
<L>Allow'd herself once more upon a steed</L>
<L>To be replac'd: her horseman, noble ARLOS;</L>
<L>Who through morasses, underwoods, and roads</L>
<L>Almost impervious, brought his royal ward</L>
<L>In safety to his mansion. Oh! how blest</L>
<L>This moment had appear'd, had the same roof</L>
<L>That shelter'd her, been shelter to her Father!</L>
<L>That solace wanting, others lost their taste.</L>
<L>Her sorrows to suspend, ARLOS related</L>
<L>Events that yet could not have reach'd her ear.</L>
<L>The faithful GONZALES, he told the Princess,</L>
<L>Suspected by ZORADOR, bore the rack</L>
<L>With undiminish'd courage, nor confest,</L>
<L>—Though life was promis'd, and immense rewards,</L>
<L>The place of her retreat: that he, Lord ARLOS,</L>
<L>By wiles and arts, the jealous Tyrant blinded,</L>
<L>Who held him truest servant of the <HI>Christians.</HI></L>
<L>Thus, unsuspected, he had watch'd the roads</L>
<L>Which led towards her forest; with his life</L>
<L>To rescue from the <HI>Moors</HI> the royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>gitives,</L>
<L>If fate malevolent should e'er betray them.</L>
<L>Another tale in pity he with-held:</L>
<L>That the curst <HI>Moor,</HI> insatiate in revenge,</L>
<L>Had caus'd MONTENOS' Father, Duke <HI>Medina,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="50"/>
To die upon the block—on stale pretence,</L>
<L>That he had form'd a plot to wrest the crown.</L>
<L>His family he banish'd, their rich lands</L>
<L>Confiscate made—and yet the Tyrant liv'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the sad Princess heard, with growing horror,</L>
<L>Repeated acts of cruelty scarce human;</L>
<L>The Knights return'd who had pursued her Father.</L>
<L>It was enough: she saw them pass the gates,</L>
<L>Without the King; no circumstance was needful;</L>
<L>None could her anguish lessen—none her woe increase.</L>
<L>Their tale scarce won attention. Much they talk'd</L>
<L>Of hot pursuit, and of the villain's speed;</L>
<L>—That once his flagging courser rais'd their hopes,</L>
<L>When sudden on a neighb'ring plain appear'd</L>
<L>A troop of <HI>Spahies</HI> in a mock engagement:</L>
<L>The <HI>Saracen</HI> gain'd vigor at the sight;</L>
<L>Whilst those who follow'd, measur'd back their road,</L>
<L>Knowing the ruin of their Lord inevitable,</L>
<L>Should they, his faithful vassals, be discover'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vain were th'attempts of ARLOS, to dispel</L>
<L>The deep distress which seiz'd OSMIDA's heart.</L>
<L>The sweetest words, e'er fram'd by consolation,</L>
<L>Were spent upon the air. The young ELVERA,</L>
<L>Sister to ARLOS, lent her infant aid</L>
<L>To chear the royal guest; and with soft prattle,</L>
<L>—Kissing the drowning roses on her cheek,</L>
<L>Strove to divide her sorrow-fixt attention.</L>
<L>But, oh! her Father was a wretched captive:</L>
<L>What could abate the anguish of that thought?</L>
<L>In vain surrounding slaves watch'd ev'ry motion;</L>
<L>In vain the cielings rose on stately columns,</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="51"/>
Forcing their grandeur on the awe-struck eye;</L>
<L>In vain the downy beds invited rest,</L>
<L>Beneath rich canopies imboss'd with gold.</L>
<L>Dearer the russet pillars of the forest,</L>
<L>Whose meeting branches canopied the earth</L>
<L>Where stood her lonely cot. Oh! dearer far</L>
<L>The humble couch on which her Father's head</L>
<L>Securely rested; where her ready hand</L>
<L>His pillow smooth'd, and filial cares excited</L>
<L>Sweeter slumbers! Who, now, will watch his sleep,</L>
<L>Or sooth his griefs to rest? Who waits his waking,</L>
<L>To cheer, with tender voice, the lengthen'd day?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So spoke the heart of the unhappy Princess.—</L>
<L>Now to the hospitable cares, her fate affords,</L>
<L>We leave the Mourner, and pursue the King.</L>

<L>Stay, hapless Youth! refrain—abhor the draught,</L>
<L>With pangs, with racks, with deep repentance fraught!</L>
<L>Oh, hold! the cup with woe ETERNAL flows,</L>
<L><HI>More—more</HI> than <HI>Death</HI> the pois'nous juice bestows!</L>
<L>In vain!—he drinks—and now the searching fires</L>
<L>Rush through his veins, and writhing he expires!</L>
<L>No sorrowing <HI>friend,</HI> no <HI>sister, parent,</HI> nigh,</L>
<L>To sooth his pangs, or catch his parting sigh;</L>
<L>Alone, <HI>unknown,</HI> the Muses' darling dies,</L>
<L>And with the vulgar dead unnoted lies!</L>
<L>Bright Star of Genius!—torn from life and fame,</L>
<L>My tears, my verse, shall consecrate thy name!</L>
