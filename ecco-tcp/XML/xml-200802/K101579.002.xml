<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ADDRESSES of this Nature, which are too often fulsom Offer∣ings to Vanity, or servile Applications to Power, when made to Persons of real Worth and Honour, are at the same Time Compliments artfully paid by Authors to themselves..... While the Writer is descanting upon the high Birth, inflexible Probity, patriot Spirit, humane Dispo∣sition, and the polite and literary Accom∣plishments of his Patron, he insinuates himself into the good Opinion of his Reader, as one favoured with the Ac∣quaintance, and honoured by the Coun∣tenance and Regard of a Person thus
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
amiable and illustrious..... I shall not pre∣tend, my Lord, wholly to disclaim all Views of this Kind in the present Address I have the Honour to make to you; and accordingly should take a particular Plea∣sure in enlarging upon the above, and other shining Qualities in your Lordship's Character, did I not recollect that I have no Right to gratify the Public, or myself, at the Expence of your Lordship's private and personal Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Indeed it is my present Interest rather to engage your Lordship's favourable Opinion of the following Performances; and I know nothing more likly to do this than an Assurance that I have aim'd by a suitable Variety to adapt myself to al∣most all Sorts of Readers but immoral ones; that in some Pieces I have at∣tempted to render the Graces of Numbers and the Embellishments of Poetry sub∣servient
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
to the Interests of Virtue, and Religion; that in others I have offered such critical Disquisitions as I hope will afford at least a rational Entertainment to Men of Taste in polite Literature; and that in them all I have endeavoured occa∣sionally to express myself with Dignity, Elegance, and Ease, which, by the way, are not more the Characteristics of good Writing, than of the Air, Manner, and Conversation of a certain Nobleman I have the Honour to be known to..... I look upon myself as apologizing to the Public when I am speaking to your Lordship, and therefore have said thus much from a perfect Sense of the Consequence it must be to me as an Author to se∣cure your Lordship's Approbation of my Writings.</P>
<P>The Dedication of these to your Lord∣ship will after all, I fear, be thought a
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
trifling Proof of my Respect, and there∣fore I desire it may however be consider'd as a sincere Testimony of my Gratitude for the many Favours you have been pleased to confer on me; the most mate∣rial of which have been attended with this Circumstance of Credit and Satis∣faction, that they are to be attributed to your Lordship's free and unsolicited Kindness, and Condescension.</P>
<P>The Obligations I am under to your Lordship are not of a Nature to be men∣tioned here; but this Opportunity of expressing a due Acknowledgment of them in the most ample and public Manner, is with the greatest Pleasure taken by</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My <HI>LORD,</HI></SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your <HI>LORDSHIP</HI>'s Much oblig'd, Most respectful, and Obedient Servant

<HEAD>TO Miss ANNA MARIA WOODFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the Subject of the following Poem naturally led me to in∣scribe it to one of your Sex, I could not but hope, that the Justness of the present Address, from one who has not the Happiness to be personally known to you, would be a sufficient Apology for the Presumption of it. But tho' I may have the Misfortune to incur your Displeasure, by offending your Hu∣mility, I shall, even under the Sense of your Disapprobation, have the Satisfaction to reflect, that I have been guilty of a very artful Piece of Impertinence; since, by placing your Name before my Per∣formance, I have taken the most effectual Method to recommend it to the Public.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="8"/>
Your Example, Madam, is a Reproach to the present indolent Generation; your Glory is not established upon the perso∣nal Advantages you possess in so eminent a Manner; which, great as they are, your good Sense assures you, are, at the best, but the Subjects of present Admiration, and can never be the Basis of a lasting Fame.</P>
<P>Your Handy-work, Madam, which has very justly a Place among the Curi∣osities of that famous University, of which I have the Honour and Happiness to be an inconsiderable Member, has rendered your Name immortal; and your nice Management of the Needle, that little, but important Implement of Oeconomy, has entitled you to the Reputation of the compleatest Housewife in <HI>Europe;</HI> a Cha∣racter, to which all Virgins and Wives should aspire.</P>
<P>You have taught us to acknowlege, that the most minute Utensil of Art may,
<PB N="v" REF="9"/>
by an ingenious Application of it, be made subservient, in the highest Degree, to the Honour of the Artist: A Pin, or a Needle, in your Hands, are Instru∣ments as effectual for that Purpose, as the Poet's Pen, or the Hero's Sword.</P>
<P>I am at present, Madam, in a very perplexed Situation of Mind; I have the Pleasure to consider, that I am now upon a Subject that must be agreeable to all my Readers, and at the same time have the Mortification to recollect, that 'tis distasteful to yourself.</P>
<P>Though therefore all I could say in Commendation of your Merit, the World would think too little, yet, as what I have said you will think too much, I find myself under a Necessity of desiring your Pardon for this Liberty I have taken, and for another in the fourth Canto of this Poem, wherein I have pre∣sumed to put a short Prediction, relating
<PB N="vi" REF="10"/>
to your amiable Character, into the Mouth of the Queen of Love. This I need not otherwise have intimated, since every one must at first Sight perceive, that this Prediction is properly applicable to none but yourself.</P>
<P>After what I have said, Madam, may I venture to hope you have some Patience in Reserve for the Poem? 'Twas design'd for your Amusement, and, if that Design be answered, my Ambition is satisfied: And indeed, to say Truth, I have so thorough a Confidence in your good Na∣ture, that I am persuaded you will look with a favourable Eye upon the following Performance, though not in Justice, yet in Pity to,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Have always considered a Preface as an Author's Apology for his Perform∣ance; in which he has an undoubted Li∣berty of saying as much as he pleases in Favour of himself: As I cannot there∣fore but be apprehensive of the Success of the following Piece, I must beg Leave to take this comfortable Privilege, as well as my Poetical Brethren. The principal Circumstances I have to urge in my own Behalf, are, that this Poem is the first Production of a young and unexperienced Author (excepting a few trifling Pieces in the <HI>Magazines);</HI> and that I am so far from bidding Defiance to the Critics, that I address myself to them in the modest and
<PB N="viii" REF="12"/>
submissive Terms of, <HI>By your Leave,</HI></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN.</P>
<P>As to the Poem itself, I have endea∣voured, in some particular Passages, to imitate the Manner of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> upon a Presumption, that such Imitation would be deemed meritori∣ous in so young a Writer as myself. I ought likewise to acknowlege, that I had in View the Episode of the <HI>Patten</HI> in Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Trivia.</HI> How far I have reached the Spirit required in this Kind of Poetry, must be left to the Reader, to whose Can∣dour and Judgment I submit the follow∣ing Poem.</P>

<HEAD>THE THIMBLE. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE THIMBLE, &amp;c.] The Author, by this simple Title of his Poem, has very judiciously escaped the Censure, which most modern Poets have incured, by their Af∣fectation of Antiquity in their Title-Pages. This excellent Poem might, with as much Propriety, have been called <HI>The Thimblead,</HI> or <HI>The Thimbleiad,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s was intituled <HI>The Dunciad▪</HI> But such Imitation appeared trifling and obvious to our Author, and, at best, had been <HI>mal-apropos,</HI> and nothing to the <HI>Point</HI>—of a <HI>Needle.</HI>—I wish, however, I could as well account for his calling it an <HI>Heroi-comical</HI> Poem, rather than an <HI>Heroic</HI> one; which I take it indisputably to be. It has its Action, its Fable, its Manners, its Sentiment, and its Diction, which are the constituent Parts of the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem. And though, in respect of all these, it may, in some Instances, differ from the Plan of the Antients, and the Doc∣trine of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> I cannot think it thereby degraded into a different and lower Species of Poetry. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> himself allows, <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Rules for <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry (which he has drawn from his Reflections upon <HI>Homer)</HI> cannot be supposed to quadrate exactly with the <HI>Heroic</HI> Poems, which have been, or may be, made since his Time. <HI>(See</HI> Spec. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 273.) For this Reason, it would be ridiculous to object to the Action of this Poem, its Deficiency in Point of Greatness or Importance—a supposed necessary Qualification in the Action of the <HI>Epopee;</HI> and indeed, admitting it so to be, the Objection is founded in false and improper Ideas of <HI>Greatness and Importance;</HI> and in the wrong Impressions made upon Minds of a romantic Turn by the Exploits of antient Heroes, and the Manners and Customs of barbarous and uncivilized Nations. Because what was a proper Subject for <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry, in the Days of <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> would be shocking and absurd in so <HI>refined and delicate an Age as this.</HI> The Action of this Poem is abundantly important for these Times of <HI>genteel Indolence, and superb Tranquility;</HI> and the Author, all the while, instead of dropping his Acquaintance with the Antients, art∣fully makes use of it upon many Occasions, without a Possibility of giving Offence to any <HI>fine Lady or Gentleman,</HI> by such <HI>robust and inde∣licate</HI> Imagery, as that with which the old <HI>Epic</HI> abounds.—We shall occasionally shew, in the Course of our Criticisms, that he rarely in any respect deviates from the antient Plan without improving it.—What has been already advanced will justify likewise his making a Lady the principal personage in the Poem.—If female Characters are respectable, even in the Writings of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> Decency, sure, Propriety, and Complaisance, required they should have the first Place in the Poem before us.—Thus much we thought ne∣cessary to premise in general; we shall proceed to farther Remarks, as they are suggested by the Poem itself.</NOTE></HEAD>

<L>WHAT Art divine <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>What Art divine,</HI> &amp;c.] The Moral of an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem may be either positively laid down, or virtually couched, in what the Critics call the <HI>Exordium.</HI> That of the Iliad of <HI>Homer</HI> is clearly expressed in the Proposition of the Action of the Poem; those of the Odys∣sey and of the Aeneid are implicitly contained in their respective <HI>Exordiums.</HI> The Plan of the <HI>Thimble,</HI> which, in its Moral, is inferiour to neither of them, is formed upon Industry, and its Re∣wards; as is sufficiently intimated in these first Lines of the Poem.</NOTE>the shining <HI>Thimble</HI> found,</L>

'Tis true, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> banishes the <HI>Heathen Deities</HI> from all modern Poetry, except the <HI>Mock-Heroic:</HI> (Spec. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 523) But then he passed this Sentence, at a Time when <HI>Christianity</HI> was generally, we may presume, <HI>practised,</HI> as well as <HI>formally established,</HI> among us; a Sentence therefore that by no Means affects our Author, as Things are now happily circum∣stanced. Our Bard will certainly pass for a good <HI>Protestant</HI> with the <HI>Beau-Monde,</HI> and need not fear offending the Religion of his Coun∣try, as that great Critic expresses it; (Spec. N<SUP>o</SUP>. 267) and indeed, I cannot see why his <HI>Pagan</HI> System should not be universally received, as it not only stands clear of all <HI>Popish Errors,</HI> but like∣wise has, in some respects, <HI>reformed</HI> the old <HI>Theology</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> him∣self; which we shall have an Opportunity to shew.</NOTE> And <HI>Jove</HI> inthron'd above his Vassal Gods;</L>

<HEAD>TO Sir JOHN PHILIPPS, Bar<SUP>t</SUP>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am happy in your Permission to shelter under your Name a Performance which stands in much Need of your Favour and Pro∣tection, especially as it comes into the World with some Disadvantage; yet I hope you will do me the Justice to believe me actuated by a nobler Principle than that of a Selfishness common to all Authors, in my Choice of a Patron upon the pre∣sent Occasion.</P>
<P>For, Sir, the following Sheets are with a par∣ticular Propriety yours, whether you are considered as a Person sincerely attached to the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> or affectionately interesting yourself in the Welfare of <HI>Pembroke-College;</HI> to the Regard and best Wishes of which Society you have a double Claim, both as an Ornament, and a Benefactor.</P>
<P>The common Topics of Panegyric are obvious; and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of those many amiable Qualities, which adorn you in public and private Life, and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed: But my Inclination is corrected by a seasonable Thought, that most Writers of the present Age
<PB REF="64"/>
have, in this Respect, a considerable Advantage over me, as it is much more easy to make a Cha∣racter, than to describe one.</P>
<P>Besides, it would be needless to enter into a Detail of those Praises, which are already in the Mouth of every Well-wisher to his Country: And therefore I will only indulge the Impulse of Gra∣titude, which points to that Part of your Cha∣racter, which more immediately affects me; your Good-nature and Condescension, to which I am indebted for the Honour of your Acquaintance and Friendship, and for your favourable Accept∣ance of the following Poem.</P>
<P>Give me Leave to assure you, Sir, that I am principally anxious for the Reputation of this Tragedy, from an earnest Desire of transmitting to Posterity a Monument of the Regard and Ve∣neration I have for the Person and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your much obliged, And most humble Servant,

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE most <HI>material</HI> Objection to this Tragedy, made by Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> was, that it is rather a <HI>Poem,</HI> than a <HI>Play.</HI>—A <HI>consolatory</HI> Octjection at least! as it is founded only in the Author's acknow∣leged Transgression of the <HI>mechanical</HI> Laws of the <HI>Drama.</HI> But however reasonable the Objection might be to the <HI>Representation</HI> of this Tragedy upon the <HI>Stage,</HI> it was by no Means thought a sufficient one to its <HI>original</HI> Publication; nor consequently, 'tis pre∣sumed, will be esteemed such against its having a Place in the <HI>present</HI> Collection.—Those who are offended at the Liberties taken in it, may, if they please, call it an <HI>Historical Play,</HI> and then all Ex∣ceptions of this Nature vanish of Course.—After all, the Objection will perhaps have <HI>less</HI> Weight with the candid and judicious Reader, when he has fa∣voured with his Perusal the <HI>Essay</HI> on the <HI>Antient and Modern Drama;</HI> though he is not to look upon that <HI>Essay</HI> as written with a View to the Defence of <HI>this particular</HI> Play, or to consider <HI>this Advertise∣ment</HI> as any Thing like a Declaration of the <HI>Au∣thor's Right</HI> of Exemption from the <HI>common Rules of the Drama,</HI> by Virtue of any superiour <HI>Qualifications</HI> in <HI>Himself.</HI></P>

<L>O he is seeking thee:</L>

<L>Ay, or how else</L>

<L>His Claim's distinct from yours. He does demand</L>

<L>Could rank me with the common savage Crew,</L>
<L>Turn Hireling, drudging Slave, and carry Burdens,</L>

<L>Hah, <HI>Leicester,</HI> dost thou know what Friend∣ship is?</L>
<L>'Tis not the fawning Cringe, the study'd Smile,</L>
<L>The oil-smooth Speech, big Word, or solemn Vow;</L>
<L>It is a sacred Ray of heav'nly Love:</L>
<L>Like that, rejoicing in the Good of others,</L>
<L>It scorns the narrow Bounds of Selfishness,</L>
<L>And knows no Bliss sincere, but social Joy:</L>

<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<Q><L>SOPHRONIUS welcome! are our Messengers return'd from yonder Camp?</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ev'n now, my Friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>I ask not the Success.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Those Shouts may tell you:</L>
<L>Our Overtures of Peace were all receiv'd</L>
<L>With Scorn, and Pride peculiar to these Spoilers;</L>
<L>They know no Stile but that of Conquerours,</L>
<L>And in the Fullness of their Hearts declare,</L>
<L>The Faithful never take, but give Conditions.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Perhaps not yet—I pr'ythee, good <HI>Sophronius,</HI></L>
<L>What Terms do these victorious Vagrants offer?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>First, they invite us to embrace their Faith,</L>
<L>And draw our Swords beneath the <HI>Prophets</HI> Banner,</L>
<L>No more their Foes, but Brethren of the War.</L>
<L>If wedded to our Errours, we reject</L>
<L>This friendly Proposition, (such they call it)</L>
<L>The next Alternative is briefly this,</L>
<L>That we confess the Prowess of their Arms,</L>
<L>By paying yearly Tribute to the <HI>Caliph.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>And it was this provok'd that glorious Uproar?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>The universal Voice is now for War:</L>
<L>Soon as th' impatient Rabble caught the News,</L>
<L>A Thousand Hearts were kindled in an Instant,</L>
<L>And in the Wildness of new Zeal, to Arms,</L>
<L>To Arms they cry'd, with such a clam'rous Shout</L>
<L>As tore th' Expanse of Heav'n, and sure must strike</L>
<L>Ev'n yon Barbarian Troops with sudden dread,</L>
<L>Though long inur'd to Terrours.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou hast warm'd me.</L>
<L>These martial Transports promise well, <HI>Sophronius;</HI></L>
<L>Perhaps the wrath divine that long has scourg'd</L>
<L>Our Follies, Vices, and corrupted Faith,</L>
<L>With iron Rod of War, at length relents,</L>
<L>Nor farther will permit this vile Imposture</L>
<L>To make its Way with Death, and Desolation;</L>
<L>And like a Deluge whelm the Eastern World.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas, my Friend, we seem unfit for Mercy:</L>
<L>The seeds of Jealousy are sown among us,</L>
<L>And should they spread, and ripen to a Crop,</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="148"/>
Yon greedy <HI>Mussulmen</HI> will reap the Harvest—</L>
<L>Our Passions, <HI>Leon,</HI> fight for <HI>Mahomet</HI>—</L>
<L>Union alone can save a sinking Land,</L>
<L>And Concord is the strongest Nerve of War.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Some distant Hints of this have reach'd mine Ear;</L>
<L>'Tis said, the baleful Breath of Whisperers</L>
<L>Has undermin'd the Worth of <HI>Theodore,</HI></L>
<L>And shook his Credit with your Father <HI>Manuel:</HI></L>
<L>Are these Suggestions true?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Too true—My Father,</L>
<L>Whose Piety, and ev'n paternal Care,</L>
<L>Still anxious for the Welfare of his People,</L>
<L>Raises him high in all Affections,</L>
<L>Has yet the Leav'n of Old-Age within him:</L>
<L>(With Rev'rence let me speak in his Dispraise)</L>
<L><HI>Leon,</HI> that Sigh declares too well thou seest</L>
<L>His eager Warmth, his Frowardness of Temper</L>
<L>Impatient of Controul, and fixt as Death</L>
<L>In all Resolves—to this, Credulity</L>
<L>Too oft unlocks his Ear, and gives Access</L>
<L>To a well-garnish'd Tale.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Proceed.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou know'st,</L>
<L>Some Moons have shed their Beams since <HI>Theodore</HI></L>
<L>Lodg'd in our Town his hardy Band of <HI>Syrians,</HI></L>
<L>A voluntary Aid:—The <HI>Saracens</HI></L>
<L>Were then upon their March; and <HI>Manuel</HI> gave</L>
<L>The Honours of our chief Command to him.</L>
<L>Train'd from his active Youth a Son of War,</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="149"/>
He is no nice Observer of the Forms,</L>
<L>The ceremonious Def'rence, and the Duties</L>
<L>Preeminence expects from all beneath her.</L>
<L>The desp'rate Fight that Yesterday he push'd,</L>
<L>Unauthoris'd by <HI>Manuel,</HI> some dark Foe</L>
<L>Has swell'd into a dang'rous Crime of State.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>It looks not well—the gallant <HI>Theodore,</HI></L>
<L>No Doubt, has noble Worth—sure, that Presumption</L>
<L>Was but th' Effect of Valour's Confidence—</L>
<L>Yet, I have lately noted, our <HI>Aleppians</HI></L>
<L>Like not the headstrong Fierceness of his Nature,</L>
<L>That wants more Tincture of Humanity:</L>
<L>Necessity, they say, unsheath'd the Sword,</L>
<L>But hot-brain'd <HI>Theodore</HI> enjoys their Dangers,</L>
<L>And revels savage in a Field of Blood.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>True—but a Breach might be pernicious now:—</L>
<L>And yet <HI>Sophronius</HI> has another Fear—</L>
<L><HI>Leon,</HI> how frail at best is mortal Man,</L>
<L>This Compound of Divinity and Passion?</L>
<L>For oh! believe me, midst this gen'ral Horrour,</L>
<L>While War with hideous Strides stalks round our Walls,</L>
<L>Legions of Evils gathering in his Train,</L>
<L>My Weakness robs my Country of my Thoughts,</L>
<L>And half my Breast admits a private Care.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! I know that Care—You woo <HI>Ormelia,</HI></L>
<L>The Daughter of the valiant <HI>Theodore</HI>—</L>
<L>His other Joy, and what he loves next War.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, Friend, for should this Cloud of Discontent</L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="150"/>
Once gather to a Storm, will it not blast</L>
<L>Our growing Spring of Love? Love did I say?</L>
<L>'Tis true my secret Suit seem'd not ungrateful;</L>
<L>But know that glorious Maid adores her Father;</L>
<L>Nor marvel, she's the Daughter of his Soul;</L>
<L>His Spirit, Fierceness, and his Pride of Virtue,</L>
<L>All glow within her Breast, refin'd and cast</L>
<L>Into a softer Mould—Hence spring my Fears.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>There is Resemblance in our Lots, <HI>Sophronius;</HI></L>
<L>Thou know'st thy gentle Sister, fair <HI>Eusebia,</HI></L>
<L>Smiles on my honest Passion—Yet thy Father</L>
<L>Vows he will never sanctify her Choice—</L>
<L>'Tis true, my ruin'd Fortunes—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pr'ythee Peace;</L>
<L>Thy Birth is noble, and thy Virtue godlike;</L>
<L>These give thee ample Title to <HI>Eusebia:</HI></L>

<L>Let me first pay more pleasing Duty here.</L>
<L>Why sighs my Fair? Our Hearts are sure our own:</L>

<L>I know it falls for <HI>Leon</HI>—cruel Fortune!</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="151"/>
Why was I born to spoil <HI>Eusebia</HI>'s Peace?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eus.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fear we have indulg'd our Loves too far—</L>
<L>As Children venture in a Calm to Sea,</L>
<L>Regardless of the Cloud slow-sweeping cross</L>
<L>The Vault of Heav'n, and big with future Ruin.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet let us not despair—Heav'n oft afflicts</L>
<L>For Trial, not Destruction—Time may come,</L>
<L>When my Heart's Truth, my Service in the War,</L>
<L>And all the virtuous Labours of a Life</L>
<L>Devoted to my Country, and to thee,</L>
<L>Will melt thy Father's Soul; then shall he bless</L>
<L>My Toils, and overpay me with thy Beauties.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Could he but view thee with <HI>Eusebia</HI>'s Eyes—</L>
<L>Yet something whispers me, we'ave done amiss;</L>
<L>Why was our Love first made a Mystery?</L>
<L>Why cover'd from the Day, and from my Father?</L>
<L>Who gave me right to fix my Heart on thee?</L>
<L>'Twas Folly, if not worse—and <HI>Manuel</HI>'s Anger</L>
<L>Perhaps is providential—for till now</L>
<L>His Fondness still prevented my Desires.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>That Fondness was but Humour—while he pleas'd</L>
<L>Thy tender Age, he but indulg'd himself;</L>

<L>Hah! <HI>Leon,</HI> have a Care; I love thy Virtue;—</L>
<L>That rais'd, and that must justify my Passion;</L>
<L>Urge not a Thought to shake my filial Duty—</L>
<L>I always held the Name of Father sacred.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>This Rigour, which I know not how to blame,</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="152"/>
May crush the Hope that yet supports my Being:</L>
<L>I tremble while I speak—perhaps, thy Father</L>
<L>Means to compel thy Virgin Heart—if so—</L>
<L>Where will thy Duty be, or where thy Love?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Those Fears are vain—I cannot love another;</L>
<L>Virtue itself forbids it, and my Heart</L>
<L>Flutters, and tells me 'tis impossible.</L>
<L>My Vows are thine, (oh! spare a Maiden's Blushes)</L>
<L>My ev'ry Joy, my ev'ry Care is thine—</L>

<L>Cease then these Strains of ordinary Lovers,</L>

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Countess of Litchfield.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the honour of your LADY∣SHIP'S permission to present to you a Tragedy, which, though it met with numerous and unprece∣dented difficulties and discourage∣ments in the theatre, will, I hope, be thought not altogether unworthy your protection in the world.—In∣deed, if the unpopularity of its late situation could in the least affect that degree of merit, which your LADY∣SHIP'S candor, or the indulgence of the town, may allow it to have, it would ill become me to recommend
<PB N="iv" REF="228"/>
it to my readers, under the sanction of so polite and illustrious a name.—But your LADYSHIP has too much good sense, as well as generosity, to judge of this performance by mere appearances, and accidental or un∣lucky circumstances; and therefore, tho' it will stand as a kind of memo∣rial of the bad fortune, and worse treatment of its author; it may at the same time be a proper testimony of the high respect with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Tragedy of <HI>Cymbeline</HI> is, in the whole oeconomy of it, one of the most ir∣regular productions of <HI>Shakespeare.</HI> Its defects however, or rather its superfluities, are more than equalled by beauties, and excellencies of various kinds. There is at the same time something so pleasingly romantic, and likewise truly <HI>British</HI> in the subject of it, that, I flatter myself, an attempt to reduce it, as near as possible, to the regular stan∣dard of the <HI>drama,</HI> will be favourably received by all, who are admirers of <HI>novelty,</HI> when <HI>pro∣priety</HI> is its foundation. I have accordingly en∣deavoured to new-construct this Tragedy, almost upon the plan of <HI>Aristotle</HI> himself, in respect of the <HI>unity</HI> of <HI>Time;</HI> with so thorough a venera∣tion however for the great <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> stage, that, even while I have presumed to regu∣late and modernize his design, I have thought it an honour to tread in his steps, and to imitate his Stile, with the humility and reverence of a <HI>Son.</HI> With this view, I have retained in <HI>many</HI> places the very language of the original author, and in
<PB N="vi" REF="230"/>
<HI>all</HI> others endeavoured to supply it with a diction similar thereunto; so that, as an unknown friend of mine has observed, the present attempt is in∣tirely <HI>new,</HI> whether it be considered as an <HI>alter∣ation from,</HI> or an <HI>imitation of Shakespeare.</HI></P>
<P>—The <HI>difficulty</HI> of such an attempt, as <HI>ra∣tional</HI> as it may be, has a kind of <HI>claim,</HI> I pre∣sume, to the <HI>indulgence</HI> of the public; espe∣cially as it has been attended likewise with <HI>dis∣advantages.</HI>—For I found myself necessitated by my plan to <HI>drop some</HI> characters, to <HI>contract others,</HI> and to omit <HI>some</HI> scenes and incidents of an interesting nature;—or rather to bring the substance and purport of them within the com∣pass of a few short narrations.—A loss irrepar∣able this, but that conveniencies are likewise to be thrown into the opposite scale; for as, I hope, I have not <HI>injured</HI> any characters by <HI>contracting</HI> them, but have left them to <HI>all intents,</HI> and in point of <HI>importance</HI> the <HI>same;</HI> so I have had an opportunity of <HI>enlarging</HI> and <HI>improving some</HI> of the original parts, (those particularly of <HI>Palador,</HI> and <HI>Philario,</HI> the <HI>Pisanio of Shakespeare)</HI> and, by varying certain incidents and circumstances, of giving a <HI>new cast</HI> to the whole <HI>drama.</HI>—After all, I am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of <HI>Shakespeare;</HI> or▪ from insinuating that the plays of so exalted a genius <HI>require</HI> such
<PB N="vii" REF="231"/>
new-modelling as the present, in order to the rendering them useful or entertaining.—I have ventured publicly to defend this great <HI>dramatic</HI> Poet in the liberties he has taken; but still <HI>Shakespeare</HI> himself needs not be <HI>ashamed</HI> to <HI>wear</HI> a <HI>modern dress,</HI> provided it can be made tolerably to <HI>fit</HI> him.</P>
<P>The only question then will be, whether the present <HI>alteration</HI> be a judicious one?—And this with all due deference is left to the candour and justice of the public.</P>
<P>It will be proper to acquaint the reader, that, this play, was recommended some time since by a person of the first distinction, to the manager of the other theatre; who declared, that he had the very same altered play in his possession, and that it was designed for representation on his stage. Our <HI>Cymbeline</HI> therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at <HI>Covent-Garden;</HI> where he has contended not only with the <HI>usual</HI> difficulties, but also with <HI>others</HI> of an <HI>extraor∣dinary</HI> nature—Mrs. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s declining the part of <HI>Imogen</HI> has done the play incredible prejudice; and convinces me of the vanity of striving against the stream of popularity in ge∣neral, or the weight of particular disadvantages.—However, I am under obligations to <HI>many</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="232"/>
of the performers, for their best endeavours to do justice to my piece, and for their zeal for its success. To <HI>some</HI> I am indebted for real service, whose names, as comparisons are invidious, I leave it to the judgment of the reader to supply.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I am at a loss to ballance the account between myself and my fortune, in this whimsical situation. The kind assistance, and, I hope, not extremely partial approbation of <HI>some,</HI> adds as much to my <HI>credit</HI> and <HI>satisfac∣tion,</HI> as the <HI>delicacy,</HI> or <HI>ill-nature,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>others,</HI> has deducted from my <HI>advantages.</HI>—To my <HI>friends,</HI> I return my sincere acknowledg∣ments, and best wishes; to my <HI>enemies,</HI> I shall say nothing, 'till they are <HI>candid,</HI> and <HI>sagacious</HI> enough to speak more <HI>plainly</HI> than they have hi∣therto done,—and more <HI>to the purpose.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>Spoken by Mr. ROSS.</P>
<LG>
<L>BRITONS, the daring Author of to-night,</L>
<L>Attempts in Shakespear's manly stile to write;</L>
<L>He strives to copy from that mighty mind</L>
<L>The glowing vein—the spirit unconfin'd—</L>
<L>The figur'd diction that disdain'd controul—</L>
<L>And the full vigour of the poet's soul!</L>
<L>—Happy the varied phrase, if none shall call,</L>
<L>This imitation, that original.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For other points, our new advent'rer tries</L>
<L>The bard's luxuriant plan to modernize;</L>
<L>And, by the rules of antient art, refine</L>
<L>The same eventful, pleasing, bold design.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our scenes awake not now the am'rous flame,</L>
<L>Nor teach soft swains to woo the tender dame;</L>
<L>Content, for bright example's sake, to shew</L>
<L>A wife distress'd, and innocence in woe.—</L>
<L>For what remains, the poet bids you see,</L>
<L>From an old tale, what Britons ought to be;</L>
<L>And in these restless days of war's alarms,</L>
<L>Not melts the soul to love, but fires the blood to arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="x" REF="234"/>
<L>Your great forefathers scorn'd the foreign chain,</L>
<L>Rome might invade, and Caesars rage in vain—</L>
<L>Those glorious patterns with bold hearts pursue,</L>
<L>To king, to country, and to honour true!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! then with candour and good will attend,</L>
<L>Applaud the author in the cordial friend:</L>
<L>Remember, when his failings most appear,</L>
<L>It ill becomes the brave to be severe.—</L>
<L>Look ages back, and think you hear to-night</L>
<L>An antient poet, still your chief delight!</L>
<L>Due to a great attempt compassion take,</L>
<L>And spare the modern bard for Shakespear's sake.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>Spoken by Mrs. VINCENT.</P>
<LG>
<L>WELL, Sirs—the bus'ness of the day is o'er,</L>
<L>And I'm a princess, and a wife no more—</L>
<L>This bard of our's, with Shakespear in his head,</L>
<L>May be well-taught, but surely is ill-bred.</L>
<L>Spouse gone, coast clear, wife handsome, and what not,</L>
<L>We might have had a much genteeler plot.</L>
<L>What madness equals true poetic rage?</L>
<L>Fine stuff! a lady in a hermitage!</L>
<L>A pretty mansion for the blooming fair—</L>
<L>No tea, no scandal,—no intriguing there.—</L>
<L><PB N="xi" REF="235"/>
—The gay beau-monde such hideous scenes must damn—</L>
<L>What! nothing modish, but one cordial dram!</L>
<L>—Yet after all, the poet bids me say,</L>
<L>For your own credit's sake approve the play;</L>
<L>You can't for shame condemn old British wit,</L>
<L>(I hope there are no Frenchmen in the pit)</L>
<L>Or slight a timely tale, that well discovers,</L>
<L>The bravest soldiers are the truest lovers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such Leonatus was, in our romance,</L>
<L>A gallant courtier, tho' he cou'd not dance;</L>
<L>Say, wou'd you gain, like him, the fair one's charms,</L>
<L>First try your might in hardy deeds of arms;</L>
<L>Your muffs, your coffee, and down-beds fore-go,</L>
<L>Follow the mighty Prussia thro' the snow;</L>
<L>At length bring home the honourable scar,</L>
<L>And love's sweet balm shall heal the wounds of war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For me, what various thoughts my mind perplex?</L>
<L>Is't better I resume my feeble sex,</L>
<L>Or wear this manly garb? it fits me well—</L>
<L>Gallants instruct me—ladies, can you tell?</L>
<L>The court's divided, and the gentle beaux,</L>
<L>Cry—no disguises—give the girl her cloaths.</L>
<L>The ladies say, to-night's example teaches,</L>
<L>(And I will take their words without more speeches)</L>
<L>That things go best when—women wear the breeches.</L>

<L>Well then, heed me.</L>
<L>Our late good queen (you knew her, sir) whose age</L>

<L>Yet brought the joyful Cymbeline a daughter,</L>
<L>And to his kingdoms a most hopeful heir,</L>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE ANTIENT and MODERN DRAMA.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often read with much Pleasure the in∣genious Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s <HI>Dramatic Poem,</HI> entitled <HI>Elfrida,</HI> together with the preparatory <HI>Letters</HI> with which that Gentleman introduces it to the Public. This Piece is professedly written on the Model of the antient <HI>Greek Tragedy;</HI> and though I flatter myself, the Objections I have to the Prin∣ciples laid down in those <HI>Letters</HI> are not removed by this much-labour'd Attempt, yet I will readily own the Design is executed with a skilful hand, and in some respects deserves the Attention of the present Writers of the <HI>English Drama.</HI> I did not therefore undertake this Argument with any Inclination to differ from a Person of his known
<PB N="262" REF="365"/>
Taste, and greatly admired Abilities, but purely in Vindication of the Theory I have had the Ho∣nour to deliver in a Course of <HI>Lectures</HI> to the UNIVERSITY of OXFORD, in which, with a par∣ticular View to the Justification of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> I have ventured to advance and defend a System in some material Points inconsistent with that un∣der present Consideration. Neither am I unaware of the great Disadvantage I have to contend against, when I oppose a celebrated Writer, whose Sentiments are countenanc'd by the Prac∣tise of the antient Poets, and whose Pen is drawn under the Banner of <HI>Aristotle</HI> himself: A Disad∣vantage, which the Usage of later Writers, and the almost concurrent Voice of modern Criticism <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By modern Criticism I mean that Plan upon which the <HI>English Drama</HI> had been form'd for a Course of many Gene∣rations, and which Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> and other Critics and Poets have in our Days attempted, both by Precept and Example, to supersede and explode in favour of the Antient System.</NOTE>perhaps will be thought little enough to coun∣terbalance. However, as in Matters of Taste we ought only, I apprehend, to appeal to the genuine Dictates of Good-sense, Reason and Nature (which an implicit Veneration for any Name Antient or Modern may possibly prevent our regarding) so, if Prejudices on both Sides were removed, it would probably appear that the Victory is rather to be divided, than determined, and that with∣out depreciating the real Merit and Excellency
<PB N="263" REF="366"/>
of the antient Poets, we may yet safely defend the Principles on which the Moderns reject their Writings as the absolute and everlasting Standard of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Composition: I mean principally with regard to the three great Unities of Action, Time, and Place.—What I have to say therefore upon these Subjects I submit without farther Apo∣logy to the Judgment of the intelligent and im∣partial Reader, advertising him only in this Place, that he is not to expect a Methodical Treatise of elaborate Criticism, but only a Train of occasional Thoughts and Reflections, as they occur'd to me upon the Perusal of the Poem of <HI>Elfrida,</HI> and the <HI>Letters</HI> prefix'd to it.</P>
<Q>Had I intended, says Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> in his first Letter, (for I chuse to repeat his own Words to prevent Misapprehension) to give an exact Copy of the antient <HI>Drama,</HI> your objections to the present Poem would be unanswerable. But my design was much less confin'd. I meant only to pursue the antient Method so far as is probable a Greek Poet, were he alive, would now do, in order to adapt himself to the Genius of our Times, and the Character of our Tragedy. According to this Notion, every Thing was to be allow'd to the present Taste, which Nature and <HI>Aristotle</HI> could possibly dispense with; and nothing of Intrigue or refinement was to be ad∣mitted, at which antient Judgment could rea∣sonably

take Offence. Good Sense, as well as Antiquity, prescribed an adherence to the three great Unities; these therefore were strictly ob∣served.</Q>
<P>'Tis evident from this Passage, the ingenious Author would have us consider the Laws of <HI>Ari∣stotle,</HI> and the Practice of Antiquity relating to the great Unities, as manifestly founded in the first Principles of Nature and Good Sense; and ac∣cordingly in order to adapt himself to the present Taste no farther than might be justly allowable, we find him deviating from the Rules and Prac∣tice of Antiquity but in two Instances; First in the Choice of a Story, in which Love is the pre∣dominant Passion, and Secondly, in which Cha∣racters are represented as nearly approaching to private ones as <HI>Tragic</HI> Dignity would permit. Upon our Author's <HI>Hypothesis</HI> indeed these are perhaps almost the only Deviations that could be allow'd him; and the Point must at once be given up, if the Theory be true which is here in so positive a manner advanc'd. For Satisfaction there∣fore in this Matter it may be useful in the first Place to observe, that the Action of the antient <HI>Drama,</HI> when brought to the Perfection in which <HI>Aristotle</HI> found it, was so strictly One, and the Fable so absolutely Simple, and almost totally ab∣horrent from Incident, at least from what Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> calls Contrivance, Refinement and Intrigue,
<PB N="265" REF="368"/>
that the Constitution of the <HI>Drama</HI> did not so properly require, as suppose and imply a corre∣spondent Unity of Time and Place. Nay, usually we find among the antient <HI>Greek</HI> Poets the en∣tire Action of the <HI>Drama</HI> was brought within the Compass of the Representation itself. And in∣deed if <HI>exact</HI> Nature and <HI>strict</HI> Propriety are in∣dispensably to be the Objects of the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poet's Attention upon all Occasions, this must be allow'd to be the most perfect Model of <HI>Tragedy;</HI> and consequently <HI>Aristotle</HI> himself seems to have indulg'd the <HI>Tragic</HI> Muse too far, when in con∣formity with the sometime Practice of the <HI>Greek Poets,</HI> He has prescrib'd a Day as the due and regular Boundary of all <HI>Dramatic</HI> Action. For certainly a Day cannot really be compriz'd within the Space of five Hours any more than a Year, or any precise Duration whatsoever. The Truth is, Poetry was the Mother of Criticism, not Cri∣ticism of Poetry, and accordingly this great Phi∣losopher form'd his simple Notions and Rules upon the best Plan of the <HI>Drama</HI> then extant; but I cannot think it will by any Means follow that those Rules are in all Points of perpetual and necessary Obligation: For why was it not in it∣self as agreeable to Nature and Reason for the Poets to admit Contrivance and Policy, Design and Intrigue into the Constitution of the Fable, as it could possibly be to confine themselves to the
<PB N="266" REF="369"/>
Representation of the most simple and uniform Action; especially as they hereby improv'd, and heighten'd that Perplexity, and Distress, which are the great Sources of Delight in Dramatic En∣tertainment? I say this Latitude of Design is not in itself unreasonable or unnatural, because 'tis not to be dissembled that the Liberty contended for would indeed be, as it has been, in the Hands of the unskilful and injudicious, an Inlet to Con∣fusion and Absurdity. However it will not surely be denied that there is in Fact a very material Difference between Incidents, and the Variety of Designs and Contrivances that occasion them, and mere Bustle and <HI>Business;</HI> in his contempt of which Word Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> seems willing to involve the whole System of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Intrigue. The general Theory I would therefore advance is this, (for I would not be understood to assert it admits of no Exception) that it is not barely the Privi∣lege, but often even the Duty of the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poet to adapt himself to the Vicissitudes of Public Taste, and to represent human Life, and human Actions as he finds them; and if in Pursuance of this Design, he may think it expedient to make Choice of a Subject of such a complicated Nature as cannot with Ease and Consistency be dispatch'd within the <HI>statutable</HI> Limits of Time, and Place, I cannot see why we may not indulge him with a proportionable Allowance of each, in order to
<PB N="267" REF="370"/>
prevent infinitely greater Absurdities and Incon∣sistencies than that Allowance can possibly pro∣duce, that is, those confus'd and precipitate Action. And all this while the Extensiveness of the Design, provided it be executed with Judg∣ment in other Respects, deserves rather to be look'd upon as an Excellence and an Improve∣ment upon the old Model, than to be placed to the Account either of the Ignorance or the Inat∣tention of the Writer; of which more hereafter.</P>
<Q>There is that Sovereign Quality in Poetry (to use the Words of the ingenious Author of the <HI>Notes on the Epistle to Augustus)</HI> which the Poet <HI>(Horace)</HI> in the following passage,
<Q><LG>
<L>Ille per extensum funem mihi posse videtur</L>
<L>Ire Poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,</L>
<L>Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet,</L>
<L>Ut Magnus; et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis:</L>
</LG></Q>
considers as a kind of <HI>magic virtue,</HI> which transports the Spectator into all Places, and makes him, occasionally, assume all Persons. The Resemblance holds also in this, that it's effects are instantaneous and irresistible. <HI>Rules, Art, Decorum,</HI> all fall before it. It goes di∣rectly to the Heart, and gains all purposes at once. Hence it is, that speaking of a real Genius, possessed of this commanding Power, <HI>Horace</HI> in the Lines above quoted, <HI>Ille per extensum,</HI> &amp;c. pronounces him emphatically
<PB N="268" REF="371"/>
<HI>The Poet;</HI> it being more especially this Pro∣perty, which, of itself, discovers the <HI>true Dramatist,</HI> and secures the success of his per∣formance, not only without the assistance of <HI>Art,</HI> but in direct Opposition to it's clearest Dictates.</Q>
<P>This Passage which I have quoted <HI>verbatim</HI> (abating a few Expressions in it) exactly coincides with my sentiment upon this Head; and the Ap∣plication which the Author makes of it in Favour of <HI>Corneille,</HI> may, I presume, be made with equal Propriety at least in Behalf of our <HI>Shakespeare.</HI>—I am sensible all this while that this great Prince and Father of the English <HI>Stage</HI> is supposed by Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> to have shewn a total Disregard of all the Rules of the <HI>Drama,</HI> in Compliance merely with the Taste of the Times. I must own, I could have been glad to have seen fewer Things <HI>supposed</HI> upon this Subject. I will take the Liberty like∣wise to <HI>suppose</HI> that this great Poet saw no legal or necessary Restraint upon the Force and Impetuo∣sity of his Genius with Regard to the Unities of Action, Time and Place; that he considered the Laws relating to them as merely local and tem∣porary, well adapted indeed to the simple Genius of antient <HI>Tragedy,</HI> but in themselves and the Reason of Things dispensable upon the Supposition of a <HI>Dramatic</HI> Plan of a more extensive and com∣plicated Nature. His Opinion might be (like the
<PB N="269" REF="372"/>
current one mentioned in Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s second <HI>Letter)</HI> that <Q>the strict Adherence to the Unities restrains the Genius of the Poet; by the Simpli∣city of it's Conduct diminishes the Pathos of the Fable; and by the Admission of a continued Chorus prevents that agreeable Embarrass, which awakens our Attention, and interests our Passions.</Q>—However, that the Nature of <HI>Dra∣matic</HI> Poetry will not only admit of a more ex∣tensive Model than the <HI>Tragedies</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets furnish us with, but is also improveable by the same, if it cannot be proved, may at least I think be inferr'd even from the Doctrine of <HI>Aristotle</HI> himself. This great Critic, it is very well known, calls the <HI>Fable</HI> the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Tragedy;</HI> with a manifest Eye to which Expression, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> observes that <HI>Aristotle</HI> places the <HI>Fable</HI> first, <Q>non quoad <HI>Dignitatem,</HI> sed quoad <HI>Funda∣mentum.</HI></Q> And indeed we need only refer the Reader to the simple Arguments of <HI>Aeschylus,</HI> and even of <HI>Euripides</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI> for the most part too, to convince him that the <HI>Fable</HI> upon the antient Plan of the <HI>Drama</HI> cannot properly be said to be the <HI>Soul</HI> of the Poem in any other Sense, than as it is the <HI>Subject</HI> of it. Nay, this is in a great Measure the Case even of those antient <HI>Tra∣gedies</HI> which are of the <HI>implex</HI> Kind, and, as such, esteemed most excellent by our Philosopher. One main Argument used by him for the Priority
<PB N="270" REF="373"/>
of the <HI>Fable</HI> in the constituent Parts of <HI>Tragedy</HI> is taken from the Consideration of the sud∣den <HI>Revolutions</HI> and <HI>Discoveries,</HI> (the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Arist. Poet. Chap. 6.</NOTE><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as he calls them) which distinguish the <HI>Tragedies</HI> we are speaking of from those of the simplest Kind. These are the means, says he, by which <HI>Tragedy</HI> more par∣ticularly captivates and engages (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the Mind and Affections.</P>
<P>Now if this Doctrine be applied to the modern <HI>Drama,</HI> it seems to me not only an Apology for, but in Effect a Recommendation of the Incidents and Revolutions, which are infinitely more nu∣merous upon the <HI>British</HI> Stage than they were upon that of <HI>Athens,</HI> and are so offensive to squeamish Judgments; unless it can be proved that these under the Direction of a good Judgment do not contribute to, or rather constitute that Va∣riety which <HI>Aristotle</HI> plainly refers to in the Pas∣sage quoted; or that such Variety in modern Plays has not a proportionable Influence on the Passions, upon which, as Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> rightly has observed, it is the Business of the <HI>Tragic</HI> Muse "directly to strike."—If therefore the <HI>Fable</HI> be the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> I will venture to assert, there is more <HI>Soul</HI> in a good modern <HI>Tragedy,</HI> than in the best antient one; and that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> might very properly, and therefore gravely call secret
<PB N="271" REF="374"/>
Intrigues the <HI>Beauties of our modern Stage.</HI> Indeed that great Man in some occasional Re∣marks he made on Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Reflections on the <HI>Tragedies</HI> of <HI>Fletcher,</HI> &amp;c. makes no scruple to give the Preference to our <HI>English</HI> Poets before the <HI>Antients</HI> under this very Article of Enquiry: <Q>Next shew, says he, in what An∣tient <HI>Tragedy</HI> was deficient; for Example, in the Narrowness of it's Plots, and Fewness of Persons, and try whether that be not a Fault in the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets; and whether their Excel∣lency was so great, when the Variety was vi∣sibly so little; or whether what they did was not very easy to be done.</Q></P>
<P>In Opposition to this the following Words of the ingenious Author of the <HI>Notes</HI> &amp;c. already referred to, may possibly be urged. <Q>An Unity, (says he, speaking of the two <HI>Dramas)</HI> and even <HI>Simplicity in the Conduct of the Fable is a Perfection in each.</HI> For the Course of the <HI>Affections</HI> is diverted and weakened by the In∣tervention of what we call a <HI>double Plot;</HI> and even by a Multiplicity of <HI>subordinate Events,</HI> though tending to a common <HI>End;</HI> and, of <HI>Persons,</HI> though all of them, some Way, con∣cerned in promoting it. The like Considera∣tion shews the Observance of this <HI>Rule</HI> to be essential in just Comedy. For when the <HI>Atten∣tion</HI> is split on so many interfering Objects, we are not at leisure to observe, nor do we fully
<PB N="272" REF="375"/>
enter into the <HI>Truth of Representation</HI> in any of them; the <HI>Sense</HI> of <HI>Humour,</HI> as of the <HI>Pathos,</HI> depending very much on the continued and undiverted Operation of it's <HI>Object</HI> upon us.</Q> But in answer to this, I will venture to assert in my Turn, that the Intervention of what we call a <HI>Double-Plot,</HI> a <HI>competent Number</HI> (not <HI>Multipli∣city)</HI> of <HI>subordinate Events</HI> tending to a common <HI>End,</HI> and of <HI>Persons</HI> all of them some way con∣cern'd in promoting it, do not weaken, but ease and relieve the Course of the <HI>Affections;</HI> and also, that in <HI>Comedy,</HI> the Attention is really quicken'd even by being split on so many interfering Ob∣jects;—that different and <HI>opposite Characters</HI> set off and illustrate <HI>each other;</HI>—and that we are enabled by a proper <HI>Variety</HI> of Personages more precisely to observe and fully to enter into The <HI>Truth of Representation</HI> in <HI>all</HI> of them: And con∣sequently that a <HI>Comedy</HI> with a Double-Plot art∣fully conducted, and fill'd judiciously, not cramm'd with Incidents and Intrigue, in which the several Persons of the <HI>Drama</HI> have room to exercise, and display themselves, attains it's End, which is the Rotation of <HI>Characters,</HI> and their <HI>specific Differ∣ences,</HI> (as this Author well observes) more effec∣tually, than the simple, and contracted <HI>Comedy</HI> of the Antients; but this Matter I have handled more at large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lectures.</NOTE>elsewhere, and in the mean time
<PB N="273" REF="376"/>
let these respective Opinions be left to the Decision of Fact and Experience.—To return to Mr. <HI>Mason.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I should be loth indeed to see Incidents, Bustle, and Business supply the Place of Simpli∣city, Nature and Pathos.</Q> which, 'tis not to be denied, is the Case in some modern Performances. But that the former are likewise very consistent with the latter, and that such Consistency and Union is one great Point of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Composi∣tion, as calculated for the rational Entertainment of an Audience, may be exemplified in many il∣lustrious Instances; particularly in the <HI>Tragedies</HI> of <HI>Shakespear.</HI> It is true this inimitable Poet, is not so greatly remarkable for Depth of Plot and Intricacy of Contrivance, as for the Historical Con∣tinuation of his Design, (which, by the way, is in∣deed carried to an unreasonable Length in some of his Plays) but however, as such Historical Con∣tinuation necessarily implies a great Variety of In∣cidents and Revolutions, it is fairly reducible to the same Head of Disquisition. <HI>Shakespear</HI> indeed, for the most part, form'd his Dramatic Plans from History, or Romance, and therefore has no ex∣traordinary Claim to the Glory of Invention, either as to the Subject of his <HI>Tragedies,</HI> or the Conduct of his Plots. His Excellencies, for the most part, are purely Poetical. But this is far from being the Case of all our <HI>Dramatic</HI> Writers. The
<PB N="274" REF="377"/>
Ground-work of the greatest part of our <HI>English Tragedies</HI> is indeed Historical; but the Superstruc∣ture is their own. The whole Business of Plot, Intrigue, and Contrivance, is generally the Work of the Poets; and a Work, when executed with Art and Judgment, that shews them to be supe∣riour at least to their Forefathers of <HI>Greece</HI> in the ample Field of Invention (the first Point in Poetry): and therefore I should think some of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s Expressions, relating to the kind Assistance of the Violin to the Distress of the Hero or the Poet on the <HI>British</HI> Stage, may in some measure be retorted upon himself, and those whose Cause he espouses. For though an inter∣mediate Space between the Acts may be requisite for the Purposes of the Modern <HI>Drama,</HI> and even to save Appearances of the Probability of the De∣sign, yet I can by no means admit these pruden∣tial Pauses to be Proofs in themselves of the Di∣stress or Barrenness of the Writer. Methinks to the Relief of these, the antient <HI>Chorus</HI> seems more peculiarly adapted, when the <HI>Drama,</HI> by reason of the Scantiness, or if you please <HI>Simplicity</HI> of it's Matter, and the Narrowness of it's Plots, stood in absolute Need of such seasonable and friendly Interposition: But to the <HI>Chorus</HI> I am to pay my Compliments again by and by.—</P>
<P>It should be observ'd here, I am supposing all this while that, notwithstanding the Extensiveness
<PB N="275" REF="378"/>
of Design in modern <HI>Tragedies,</HI> a due, and even scrupulous Regard is to be had to Consistency and Uniformity of Plot and Action; That there is to be but one grand central Point as it were, in which the several Underplots, Incidents, Turns, and Vicissitudes of the <HI>Drama</HI> are finally to ter∣minate; and that though the great Business of the Poet under this Article be to perplex and embar∣rass his Audience, and to play with their Passions at pleasure, yet he is to take Care that the Un∣ravelling of the whole, and the several Parts, be easy and natural, and the Labyrinths of his Plots such as, according to Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Expression upon another Occasion, may be justly deem'd a <HI>regular Confusion.</HI> If proper Care and Caution be taken as to these particulars, I confess I am apt to look upon the Transgression of the Letter of the old Laws of <HI>Tragedy</HI> as Offences rather against the Custom and Usage of Antiquity, than the Dictates of Reason and Nature; and, as great a Veneration as I have for the antient Poets, cannot possibly think I am maintaining an Argument to the prejudice of their real Merit, by endeavouring to assert the Liberty of modern Poets, and to rescue the <HI>Drama</HI> from <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Mason's Third Letter.</NOTE><HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>Restraint.</HI></P>
<P>To speak freely, I must own farther, I cannot subscribe to a Theory that condemns at one Dash
<PB N="276" REF="379"/>
almost every Compliance with Public Taste, and the Genius of a People, as mere Complaisance and Servility: I believe a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet now alive would adapt himself to the Taste of the Times in more Instances than Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> would allow; and that these have been occasionally more or less consulted and indulged by all Poets in all Ages. Not that I am of Mr. <HI>Southern</HI>'s Opinion (See his Preface to the <HI>Fatal Marriage)</HI> that every reason∣able Man will, and ought to govern in the Plea∣sures he pays for; for in such Case <HI>Hamlet</HI> must walk off the Stage to make room for <HI>Harlequin.</HI>—I would neither servilely indulge Public Taste, nor yet self-sufficiently despise it.—I am willing upon this Occasion once more to shelter myself under the Authority of <HI>Dryden.</HI></P>
<Q><P>One reason of that Success (says he in the above-cited Remarks) is in my Opinion this, that <HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> have written to the Genius of the Age and Nation in which they lived: For though Nature, as he (Mr. <HI>Rymer)</HI> objects, is the same in all Places, and Reason too the same; yet the Climate, the Age, the Dispositions of the People to whom a Poet writes, may be so different, that what pleas'd the <HI>Greeks,</HI> would not satisfy an <HI>English</HI> Au∣dience.</P>
<P>And if they proceeded upon a Foundation of truer Reason to please the <HI>Athenians,</HI> than
<PB N="277" REF="380"/>
<HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> to please the <HI>English,</HI> it only shows that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were a more judicious People: But the Poet's Business is certainly to please the Audience.</P>
<P>Whether our <HI>English</HI> Audience have been pleased hitherto with Acorns, as he calls it, or with Bread, is the next Question; that is, whether the Means which <HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> have used in their Plays to raise those Passions before-named, be better applied to the Ends by the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, than by them; and perhaps we shall not grant him this wholly. Let it be yielded, that a Writer is not to run down with the Stream, or to please the People by their own usual Methods, but rather to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦form form their Judgments; it still remains to be proved, that our Theatre needs this total Re∣formation.—The Faults which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s found in their Designs, are rather wittily aggravated in many Places, than reasonably urg'd; and as much may be returned on the <HI>Greeks,</HI> by one who were as witty as himelf:</P></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> is here compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the Ancients with the Moderns, in regard to the Conduct and Command of the two great <HI>Tragical</HI> Passions, Pity and Terrour, and the Comparison concludes to the Advantage of the latter.</P>
<P>A little farther he proceeds thus, <Q>To con∣clude thereore: if the Plays of the Ancients are
<PB N="278" REF="381"/>
more correctly plotted, ours are more beauti∣fully written; and if we can raise Passions as high on worse Foundations, it shews our Ge∣nius in Tragedy is greater, for in all other Parts of it, the <HI>English</HI> have manifestly excelled them.</Q></P>
<Q>For the Fable itself, 'tis in the <HI>English</HI> more adorned with <HI>Episodes,</HI> and larger than in the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, consequently more diverting; for if the Action be but one, and that plain, with∣out any Counterturn of Design or Episode, (i. e.) Under-plot, how can it be so pleasing as that of the <HI>English,</HI> which have both Under∣plot, and a turn'd Design, which keeps the Audience in Expectation of the Catastrophe? w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereas in the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, we see through the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Design at first.</Q>
<P>I do lot use this as an accurate Piece of Cri∣ticism, nor would be understood to oppose the Authority of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> to the <HI>Ipse dixit</HI> of <HI>Aristotle</HI> in general, who has certainly a right to be heard first, in critical as well as philosophical Matters, with a proportionable Consideration of the Age he lived in: The only Point in Debate is, whether he can be supposed in the Nature of Things, from the clear Idea he had form'd of the <HI>Greek Drama,</HI> to be qualified to give Poetical Laws to all Posterity.—Public Taste, it is pro∣bable, (as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> intimates) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ries in dif∣ferent
<PB N="279" REF="382"/>
Countries, according to the Nature of the Climate, and the Constitution of the People: However, there are some certain, fix'd, and ac∣knowledged Principles of Good Sense, Nature and Reason, that are, as Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> observes, equally and universally, in all Ages and Nations, at least all civilized ones, the same: I believe there has been hardly any Age so illiterate, whimsical, or corrupted in this Sense, as to explode these stand∣ing Principles; such for Instance, among many others, are the following: That the <HI>Drama</HI> is to be the true Image and Representation of Nature: That this Representation can only be exhibited under an infinite Variety of Actions, Designs, Characters, Manners, Sentiments and Expressions: That with regard to all, and each of these, Pro∣priety, Consistency, and Probability are most ex∣actly to be observed: That the Motives to all Actions, the Springs of all Passions, the Grounds of all Prejudices, the Peculiarities of all Tempers, have one common Foundation, and are produc∣tive of their correspondent Effects, in all Times and Places.—The Knowlege of these Things is the Knowlege of Nature, in which the great <HI>Arcana</HI> of all Poetry, and particularly <HI>Dramatic,</HI> are reposited. To these, therefore, it is the <HI>Dra∣matic</HI> Poets Care most heedfully to attend; and to these he may attend, in Fact, very consistently, with a Disregard of the Laws of the old <HI>Drama,</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="383"/>
as might be instanced in many of our best Mo∣dern Plays, and in almost all of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s.—It is, indeed, nothing but this Attention that has so eminently raised and preserved the Reputation of these latter, notwithstanding the Poet's absolute Neglect, or rather Defiance of the great Unities contended for as essential to the <HI>Drama.</HI> And 'tis as certain, that where this Attention is wanting, either through Ignorance or Carelessness, the most regular Observance of these Unities will be found utterly insufficient for the true Purposes of Stage-Poetry.</P>
<P>For these, and the like Reasons, I think one may venture to conclude, that the Practice of the Antients is by no means a necessary Standard of <HI>Dramatic</HI> writing, and that the Laws relating to the several Unities of Action, Time, and Place, though they do indeed constitute a particular Form, or Species of the <HI>Drama,</HI> (and we will grant the most <HI>exact</HI> too) yet are by no means essential to the Nature of it. Whatever is so, cannot be violated or infringed without Contra∣diction to the common Judgment of Mankind, and disgusting at least, the more rational Part of an Audience. And accordingly every Defect in the Particulars above-mentioned, is always re∣ceived with proportionable Marks of Disappro∣bation. But the Case is quite different, in respect of the Liberties <HI>Shakespear</HI> has taken, which
<PB N="281" REF="384"/>
therefore, I can never think absurd or unnatural in themselves. And I am the more confirmed in this Opinion, because <HI>Johnson, Fletcher,</HI> and many others, who were confessedly acquainted with the Genius of ancient <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and, generally speaking, not only affected Art and Regularity in their Writings, but even depended principally upon these for the Success of them, did never∣theless, on many Occasions, hold themselves free from the Obligation of the Laws at present in Question.</P>
<P>But herein, our modern Refiners will say they judged wrong; and as to <HI>Shakespear,</HI> if he has escaped the Severity of Censure upon this Head, it must be ascribed wholly to that Complaisance, which every Generation has thought due to his Excellencies in the <HI>higher Beauties</HI> of Poetry.—Now this Answer, (and something to this Effect must be the Answer) does itself suppose, that the most punctual Observance of the old Laws, has no Connection with the <HI>great</HI> Beauties of Poetry, but is only at best the <HI>mechanical</HI> Part of the <HI>Drama:</HI> However, 'tis presum'd that the great Name of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> scorns to be protected by the Complaisance of his Countrymen; and that the Liberties he has taken, are very far from being indefensible.—For is it more improper and irrational, or does it require less Force of of Genius, and Knowlege of Nature, to trace as
<PB N="282" REF="385"/>
it were a Passion from it's first Rise, through it's Progress, and to it's final Issue, as that of Jea∣lousy in <HI>Othello,</HI> or of Ambition in <HI>Macbeth,</HI> than to represent it only at a stated Period, and at a particular Crisis? Or, if the Poet thinks proper to shift the Scene from a <HI>Palace</HI> to a <HI>Heath,</HI> or from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> is it at all more inconvenient or impossible for his Audience to attend him, than it was to give him the Meeting, and suppose them∣selves in the Place where he laid his first Scene? It does not at all appear to me, that a greater Degree of implicit Faith is required in one In∣stance than in the other: For he may with equal Probability do both, UT MAGUS, as has been hinted above, and he can do neither but in Qua∣lity of the same. Times and Places are in a great Measure at the Command of a Genius; and the Argument drawn from the absolute Unna∣turalness of every Breach of exact and precise Unity with regard to them, if it proves any Thing, proves too much; it will prove the Unna∣turalness of the whole <HI>Dramatic Apparatus;</HI> it will demonstrate the Impossibility of exhibiting Woods, Fields, Castles, and Towns, in a single Room, and the Absurdity of giving an Ear to a Company of Fidlers, before or after the Solemnity of a Council, or the Tumult of a Battle. In short, it seems to me a most ridiculous <HI>Hypercriticism,</HI> to object to Improprieties which are more or less
<PB N="283" REF="386"/>
inseparable from the Constitution of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and to talk of Inconsistencies and Impossibilities, where all is confessedly a Delusion. If the Que∣stion indeed were, whether of the two be the more <HI>artificial</HI> Model of Tragedy, that of the Ancients, or the Moderns, I would make no Scruple to give up the Argument: But a <HI>regular</HI> and <HI>exact</HI> Model is one Thing, and an <HI>excellent Play</HI> is another; it is one Thing to allow a rea∣sonable Latitude to a great Genius, and another to prescribe a Plan to a common Poet.</P>
<P>Were the antient <HI>Greek Tragedians</HI> defective then in Point of Genius, it will be ask'd? Very far from it.—However, I will venture to assert, that the <HI>Simplicity,</HI> (I had almost said <HI>Poverty)</HI> of their Fables, is by no means their striking Beauty; that these would have appeared to greater Advantage, had they taken greater Liberties; that neither Nature nor Reason restrained them to the precise Observation of the three Unities, and that the Custom of Antiquity in this Case, under the Abilities of a great Master, would (to use the Words of <HI>Shakespear)</HI> be more frequently <HI>ho∣noured in the Breach, than the Observance.</HI></P>
<P>But what if, after all, some Precedents even from Antiquity itself, will in a certain Measure warrant the Non-observance of the great Rules in Dispute? <HI>Euripides</HI> and <HI>Sophocles,</HI> who confessedly improved the more simple Plan of their Prede∣cessor
<PB N="284" REF="387"/>
<HI>Aeschylus,</HI> and are supposed to have brought the <HI>Drama</HI> to it's State of Perfection, do not superstitiously, and without Exception, adhere to their own general System: Witness first, the <HI>Hecuba</HI> of <HI>Euripides;</HI> in which there are appa∣rently two distinct, and almost unconnected Ac∣tions; at least, out of the two great Incidents of that Tragedy, two distinct Actions might have been plan'd; for either the Death of <HI>Polixena,</HI> or the Destruction of <HI>Polymnestor,</HI> might, and <HI>strictly</HI> speaking ought, to have been the simple Subject of that <HI>Drama.</HI> If it be said that both these Ac∣tions (or Incidents) were no more than were suf∣ficient or necessary to exemplify the Distresses of <HI>Hecuba,</HI> and to illustrate the Character of that unhappy Princess, this is saying, in effect, what we have already said, in Defence of the compli∣cated Plan of modern <HI>Dramatists;</HI> and so,
<Q><L>Hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim.</L></Q></P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Ajax</HI> of <HI>Sophocles</HI> ought to have ended with it's natural Catastrophe, the Death of this Hero; instead of which another Action, pro∣perly speaking, commences, arising from the vio∣lent Contest between <HI>Teucer</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> con∣cerning the forementioned Hero's Right of Burial; a Contest, which, if the Poet in the present Case had studied, or even regarded absolute Simplicity and Uniformity, he should have reserved for the Groundwork of another Tragedy.—And further
<PB N="285" REF="388"/>
the <HI>Trachiniae</HI> of the same excellent Author is manifestly defective in Point of Unity of Time; of which much more must naturally be sup∣posed to have lapsed between the Departure of <HI>Hyllus</HI> to inquire after his Father, and his Return to <HI>Trachin</HI> than the Letter of the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Law allowed him.—These Defects and Irregularities I have never seen taken Notice of, and much less ob∣jected to these justly admired Writers. And though we could bring no other Examples to the same Purpose than the above cited, or however none so obvious as these, yet 'tis apprehended a single Instance of this Nature is of very considerable Weight and Consequence in the present Contro∣versy; and will warrant us in determining that the strict Laws of the <HI>Drama</HI> were not of indis∣pensable Obligation, even in the Judgment of the Antients themselves.—Indeed if they are, the Merit of a Poet should be tried chiefly at least by them; and therefore when Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> tells us that <HI>Shakespear</HI> ought, for his other Virtues, to be exempted from common Rules, he is unjustifi∣ably candid and indulgent to him; for sure he ought by no Means to be exempted, if such Rules are founded in the indispensable Laws and first Principles of Nature and good Sense. If he is fun∣damentally and essentially ridiculous, a thousand in∣feriour Beauties will not excuse him. Common Rules are therefore upon certain important Consi∣derations dispensable; and if so, <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Beau∣ties do not so properly excuse, as acquit him.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="389"/>
If the judicious Reader will apply here, by the Way, some of the foregoing Remarks to the Case of <HI>Tragi-Comedy,</HI> he will be able perhaps to ac∣count not only for the Toleration, but also gra∣cious Reception of so motley a Production upon the <HI>English</HI> Stage. For though <HI>Shakespear,</HI> with his Contemporaries and many Successors, did in such Pieces undeniably humour the public Taste to their own Discredit, yet 'tis to be observed, that the grand <HI>Arcana</HI> of Nature above intimated might be scrupulously attended to even in this heterogeneous Composition; and accordingly when the <HI>Tragic</HI> and <HI>Comic</HI> Representation was each excellent in it's Kind, it is no Wonder that the Bulk of an Audience should overlook the manifest Impropriety of the Coalition, or that the more judicious Part should forgive it for the Sake of the fundamental and essential Excellencies of the re∣spective Actions and Representations. It is plainly for this Reason that the best <HI>Tragi-Comedies</HI> of <HI>Shakespear</HI> and others are received with general Applause at this very Day; the Ground of Com∣plaint against such <HI>Tragic</HI> and <HI>Comic</HI> Union be∣ing really not so much that it offends the Judg∣ment, as that it improperly divides the Attention. Two separate Plots, and distinct Actions do this to a ridiculous Degree; but in one and the same Action absolute Uniformity is not essential either to the <HI>Tragic</HI> or <HI>Comic Drama.</HI> For tho' the
<PB N="287" REF="390"/>
<HI>Pathos</HI> be the Characteristic of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and <HI>Hu∣mour</HI> of <HI>Comedy,</HI> as well ancient as modern, yet the former will admit of Characters of Pleasantry under certain Regulations, and the latter is fre∣quently known to abound with Circumstances of very affecting, tho' domestic Distress; of which many Instances might, if need were, be on both sides produced, in the several <HI>Dramas</HI> both of Antients and Moderns. Nor does such occasional and moderate Reciprocation confound or destroy the different Genius, Nature, and End, of the two <HI>Species.</HI> And it was probably owing to some injudicious Writer's Misapplication of this Truth, and his drawing undue and false Consequences from it, and even in his own Imagination im∣proving it, that either the Name, or the Consti∣tution of <HI>Tragi-Comedy</HI> did ever subsist. For the Reasons why <HI>Plautus</HI> calls his <HI>Amphitrion</HI> a <HI>Tragi-Comedy,</HI> are of a Nature entirely different from this. However, the great Objection to this Form of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Composition is certainly, as has been said, that it unsuitably divides the Attention, not that it lessens it, or by exciting many different Pas∣sions in the same Space of Time checks the Force of any single one. That the Attention in a very uniform and regular Play, may be divided without being lessened, we have already observed; and indeed, if this were not the Case, absolute Uni∣formity and Simplicity must be really essential to
<PB N="288" REF="391"/>
the two <HI>Species</HI> of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and every reci∣procal Participation will be proportionably, to the Degree of it, absurd. But to assert this, would be talking against Reason, Experience, and the not uncommon Practice of the best Poets. Is any Man less mov'd by the Delicacy and Tenderness of Lord <HI>Townley,</HI> upon his Separation from his Wife, on Account of the Mirth that was before excited in him, by the ridiculous Ignorance, and Rusticity of Sir <HI>Francis Wronghead?</HI> Do we less interest ourselves in the Fate of the unhappy <HI>In∣diana,</HI> because we were diverted by the cox∣combical Pertness of Mr. <HI>Thomas?</HI> Should we be more affected by the pathetical Complaints of <HI>Romeo,</HI> if they were not contrasted in the Buf∣foonery of <HI>Mercutio?</HI> Or, to refer the Reader to a Play or two written directly upon the <HI>Tragi∣comic</HI> Plan, does the iniquitous Drollery of the <HI>Spanish Friar</HI> abate our Concern for the Distresses of <HI>Torrismond</HI> and <HI>Leonora?</HI> Or, do the comical <HI>Rhodomontades,</HI> and Humours of <HI>Falstaff</HI> and his Associates, take off our Attention from the Bravery of Prince <HI>Henry</HI> or <HI>Hotspur,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. at the Battle of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI>—I am very far from contending for this Mixture, not of opposite, but indeed con∣tradictory Characters, in the same <HI>Drama,</HI> and much less for the Form of <HI>Tragi-Comedy</HI> itself: Proper and due Uniformity admits of sufficient Variety, and though it be not essential to the
<PB N="289" REF="392"/>
<HI>Drama,</HI> is no doubt a great Beauty in it: The most popular of the Plays I have mentioned, are not the better for their Medley of Characters; but all this while, let the Fault or Impropriety be placed in a fair Light, and ascrib'd to it's true Cause, which is the real, though nice Connection, between the Genius of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and that of <HI>Co∣medy,</HI> and the extreme Difficulty of precisely de∣termining how far, or in what Degrees and Pro∣portions the one may assume the Qualities and Properties of the other.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject:—The simple Constitution of the ancient <HI>Drama,</HI> has indeed some Advantages over the more complicated one of succeeding Ages, but still such as are abun∣dantly more than ballanc'd by those of the latter. The frequent shifting of Scenes, for Instance, though it does not offend the Judgment, is yet disgusting to the Eye of the Spectator, and so far the Continuation of one and the same Scene, is a peculiar Beauty, and Propriety. But all this while, to this Beauty and local Propriety, many other more important Points of Probability are too often sacrific'd. This is, more or less, I be∣lieve, the Case of all strictly uniform <HI>Tragedies</HI> and <HI>Comedies,</HI> but evidently, at least of some of our best <HI>English Comedies</HI> that have been written on the old <HI>Dramatic</HI> Plan; in which, notwithstand∣ing the Unity of Action, so much Business is
<PB N="290" REF="393"/>
transacted, so much Intrigue carried on, by so many different Personages, in one single Spot of Ground, as is utterly incredible; in which Case the Poet <HI>really</HI> offends against Reason, Nature, and good Sense, purely to save the <HI>Appearance</HI> of doing so: Indeed if the Unities are essential to the <HI>Drama,</HI> the utmost Simplicity will of Course be a Perfection in it; and consequently many of the most regular Compositions of our <HI>Comic</HI> Poets (as <HI>the Way of the World,</HI> and the <HI>Double Dealer</HI> of <HI>Congreve)</HI> will be found to be infinitely their worst Productions: So ambitious have some been of improving the Model of the antient <HI>Drama,</HI> and yet so cautious at the same Time of taking such Liberties as were absolutely necessary for those Improvements.</P>
<P>After all, Discretion is to be a general Rule even in the Use of Liberty. I would neither fetter the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Muse, nor yet let her run wild; Deviations from the strict Laws of Anti∣quity should be made not affectedly and at ran∣dom, but with a View to Beauties of a higher Nature; not for the Ease of the Poet, but to the Advantage of the Poem. I would not vindicate <HI>Shakespear</HI> himself in every Instance of his Trans∣gression. To sum up all that need be said upon this Point in a few Words; the old Laws of <HI>Aristotle</HI> are in my Opinion very proper Regula∣tions and Restraints for an indifferent Poet, but ought not to be the Shackles of a good one.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="394"/>
The other great Point of Difference between the antient and modern <HI>Drama,</HI> is the Disuse of the <HI>Chorus</HI> in the latter; which yet Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> is "willing to think essential to the Tragic <HI>Drama."</HI> Now admitting the Theory of <HI>Aristotle</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> to be not only a regular, but also necessary Standard of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Writings, with Respect to the Unities of Action, Time and Place, the <HI>Chorus,</HI> though not essential to the <HI>Drama,</HI> will indeed as Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> observes <Q>lay a proper and necessary Restraint upon the Poet.</Q> But if these Unities themselves are far from being essen∣tial to the <HI>Drama,</HI> as we have endeavoured to make it appear, the Use of the <HI>Chorus</HI> is so far at least superseded.—The <HI>Chorus</HI> was indeed, as I have before observed, not only a constituent Part of, but even a Convenience to the antient <HI>Tragedy.</HI> If I might be excused the Indelicacy of the Expression for the Significancy of the Senti∣ment, I would say, let a <HI>Tragedy</HI> of <HI>Aeschylus</HI> be <HI>gutted</HI> of it's <HI>Chorus,</HI> and you leave it little better than a <HI>Skeleton.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed; upon the simple Plan of Anti∣quity the <HI>Chorus</HI> introduced, 'tis true, an agreeable Variety into the <HI>Drama,</HI> and was no doubt both useful and ornamental to it, as it's peculiar Pro∣vince had more immediate Reference to the great Ends of all Poetry, <HI>prodesse &amp; delectare.</HI> But after all, if these great Ends are better, or even as well
<PB N="292" REF="395"/>
answered without the <HI>Chorus;</HI> and if these Ends are not obstructed by the Admission of Design, Contrivance and Intrigue into the Fable, but even promoted by it under the Conduct of a masterly Hand, in this Case, I say, it is not to be denied but the <HI>Chorus</HI> of the Antients has given Place to it's Betters.—It is true Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> has very positively asserted (for I think he has by no Means suffici∣ently proved) in Behalf of the old <HI>Chorus,</HI> that (to lay no Stress upon subordinate Advantages) it aug∣mented the <HI>Pathetic,</HI> that it afforded <Q>a graceful, and natural Resource to the Embellishments of picturesque Description, sublime Allegory, and whatever else comes under the Denomination of pure Poetry;</Q> and lastly, which is most material, that it was the properest Vehicle <Q>to convey mo∣ral Reflections with Grace and Propriety.</Q> For these Reasons, which respect both the <HI>Poet</HI> and the <HI>Audience,</HI> he judges the Disuse of the <HI>Chorus</HI> to be an irreparable Loss to the modern Stage. Let us briefly then review what this Gentleman has said upon each of these Articles.</P>
<P>Now with Regard to the first he offers us the Authority of a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> <Q>If you ask me (says he) how it augmented the <HI>Pathetic,</HI> I cannot give you a better Answer than the <HI>Abbè Vatry</HI> has done in his Dissertation on the Subject pub∣lished in the <HI>Memoirs de l' Acad. des Inser.</HI> &amp;c. It affected this (says he) both in it's <HI>Odes</HI> and
<PB N="293" REF="396"/>
<HI>Dialogue.</HI> The wonderful Power of Music and the Dance is universally allowed. And, as these were always <HI>Accompaniments</HI> to the Odes, there is no Doubt but they contributed greatly to move the Passions. It was necessary that there should be Odes or Interludes; but it was also necessary, that these Interludes should not suffer the Minds of the Audience to cool, but, on the contrary, should support and fortify those Passions, which the previous Scenes had already excited. Nothing imaginable could produce this Effect better, than the choral Songs and Dances, which filled the Mind with Ideas corresponding to the Subject, and never failed to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Personages. In the Dialogue also, the Chorus served to move the Passions by shew∣ing to the Spectators other Spectators strongly affected by the Action. A Spectacle of such a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Passions of <HI>Terrour</HI> and <HI>Pity,</HI> will not of itself so strongly affect us, as when we see others also affected by it. The Painters have generally understood this Secret, and have had Recourse to an Ex∣pedient similar to that of the <HI>Chorus</HI> of the Poets. Not content with the simple Represen∣tation of an historical Event, they have also added Groupes of assistant Figures, and exprest in their Faces the different Passions, they would
<PB N="294" REF="397"/>
have their Picture excite. Nay they some∣times inlist into their Service even irrational Animals. In the <HI>Slaughter of the Innocents,</HI> LE BRUN was not satisfied with expressing all the Horrour, of which the Subject is naturally capable; he has also painted two Horses with their Hair standing on End, and starting back, as afraid to trample upon the bleeding Infants. This is an Artifice which has often been em∣ployed, and which has always succeeded. A good Poet should do the same; and <HI>Iphigenia</HI> should not be suffered to appear on the Theatre, without being accompanied with Persons ca∣pable of feeling her Misfortunes.</Q></P>
<P>I have transcribed the whole Passage, and can't help nothing in the first Place, a very extraordinary Inaccuracy in this refin'd Portion of Criticism. For sure the above-mentioned Horses, with their "Hair standing on End," and "starting back," &amp;c. did greatly add to the Horrour of this famous Piece, which yet before had, it seems, all the Horrour expressed in it, of which the Subject was naturally capable; or, if they did not aug∣ment this Horrour, it will be difficult methinks to to tell what Business they had there. But to be serious:</P>
<P>The wonderful Power of Music is universally allow'd; and Music is by no Means excluded from the modern Stage. Nay, I venture to say, the
<PB N="295" REF="398"/>
modern <HI>Drama</HI> has Recourse to it more effectually, though less frequently, than the old <HI>Drama</HI> had; as we are more affected by it's occasional and un∣expected Graces and Assistances, than we should be by it's stated and periodical Interposition.—For the <HI>Dance,</HI> I own I am at a Loss to compre∣hend how it could contribute greatly to move the Passions; I mean the Passions proper for Tragedy: I do not pretend to ascertain the Nature and Me∣thod of the antient <HI>Stage-Dancing;</HI> but such has been the Power of the <HI>Dance</HI> in later Times, that the <HI>Tragic Muse,</HI> who is a very <HI>grave Matron,</HI> has, I believe, no Reason to lament her <HI>dancing Days are over.</HI> Admitting therefore at present the Pro∣priety and Efficacy of the <HI>Choral</HI> Songs, I cannot conceive how any Kind of <HI>Dance</HI> <Q>should sup∣port and fortify those Passions, which the pre∣vious Scenes had excited,</Q> or <Q>fill the Mind with Ideas corresponding to the Subject, and never fail to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Personages.</Q> Nor farther can I see any Thing even in the <HI>Songs,</HI> or <HI>Odes,</HI> which had so peculiar a Tendency to produce these Ef∣fects, that nothing imaginable could do it <HI>as well;</HI> for tho' these might answer this Purpose very suf∣ficiently, yet if they were not necessary for it, they cannot be contended for as essential to the <HI>Drama,</HI> and must consequently be considered only, as we have before observed, in the Light of
<PB N="296" REF="399"/>
an ancient Conveniency.—Now I apprehend the Minds of the Audience are in no Danger of cool∣ing under the present System of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and that the Music between the Acts <HI>may</HI> be adapted to the Purposes fore-named, of supporting and fortifying the Passions as much as the old <HI>Chorus</HI> could be. Without depreciating therefore the real Use and Design of the <HI>Chorus,</HI> we only say we can do in many Respects better, and even in this as well without it.</P>
<P>But farther it seems, <Q>In the Dialogue also, the <HI>Chorus</HI> served to move the Passions, by shew∣ing to the Spectators, other Spectators strongly affected by the Action.</Q> For, <Q>a Spectacle of such a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Passions of Terrour, and Pity, will not of itself so strongly affect us, as when we see others also affected by it.</Q> Admitting the Truth of which Assertion, I do not see what is to be inferr'd from it to the Advantage of the antient <HI>Chorus.</HI> For does not the modern <HI>Drama</HI> move the Pas∣sions (as indeed does the antient exclusive of it's <HI>Chorus)</HI> by shewing to the Spectators other Per∣sons (not mere Spectators, but Persons more in∣terested in the Action) strongly affected by the Events of the <HI>Tragedy?</HI> The Intervention there∣fore of Spectators, as such, upon the Stage is with Respect to this Purpose superfluous and in∣significant, except it can be demonstrated that
<PB N="297" REF="400"/>
the Passions of Terrour and Pity, or any other are (if I may be allowed the Expression) more power∣fully excited at the <HI>second Rebound.</HI>—Let common Experience at once illustrate and determine this Matter.—Supposing half a dozen indifferent Per∣sons admitted to a Spectacle of Terrour or Distress in real Life, for Instance that of a dying Man taking Leave of his Wife, his Mistress, or his Friend; would not such a Spectacle immediately raise suitable Emotions in all of them, or would each first consult the Passions of his next Neighbour in order to learn what Effect this Spectacle ought to have upon himself? These Questions require no Answer; and therefore as the <HI>Drama</HI> is so lively a Representation of real Life, they may plainly be applied to any Case of Misery or Horrour exhibited upon the Stage.—For this Reason also it is, that the Illustration of the Matter before us by the Expedients of the Painters is, I apprehend, (with Deference to the ingenious <HI>Abbè</HI> as Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> calls him) entirely foreign to the present Purpose. The Painters have very wisely had Recourse to such Expedients as are mentioned in the above-quoted Criticism, because, after all, their Art is but Painting still, and pro∣perly speaking describes the Passions, more than it excites them; but the <HI>Drama,</HI> or rather the <HI>Actor</HI> in the <HI>Drama, realizes</HI> what he represents. He must be a very insensible Spectator, who thinks at
<PB N="298" REF="401"/>
all of the <HI>Poet</HI> or the <HI>Player,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> is personating a <HI>Richard,</HI> a <HI>Macbeth,</HI> or a <HI>Lear.</HI> The Poet in short has not the same Occasion for such Artifices and Expedients as the Painter has. Let <HI>Iphigenia</HI> appear on the Theatre, and behave as she ought to do, and I will be answerable for it, the <HI>Audience</HI> will be <HI>Persons capable of feeling her Misfortunes.</HI></P>
<P>But again, by rejecting the <HI>Chorus</HI> Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> tells us the true Poet has lost a <Q>graceful and na∣tural Resource to the Embellishments of Pictu∣resque Description, sublime Allegory, and whatever else comes under the Denomination of <HI>pure Poetry.</HI></Q> To which I take Leave to reply, That what the <HI>Poet</HI> has lost hereby, <HI>Tragedy</HI> has gained; for if Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s own Theory be just, the <HI>Tragic Muse</HI> (as we have before ob∣served from him) strikes directly upon the <HI>Passions</HI> of the Audience; which I should be glad to know how Picturesque Description (I mean such as this Gentleman has favoured us with) sub∣lime Allegory, and <HI>Poetry in the Abstract,</HI> or, if you please, <HI>pure Poetry</HI> can do. Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> says, the <HI>Lyric Muse</HI> addresses herself to the Imagination of a Reader or Hearer; and accordingly <Q>few Men have a Strength of Imagination capable of pursuing the Flights of <HI>Pindar;</HI></Q> and still fewer, I will venture to add, those of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> in this Dramatic Poem. I am very far from meaning to
<PB N="299" REF="402"/>
decry this ingenious Author's peculiar Talent <HI>in loco;</HI> but I fear in the present Case, while he affects to defend the Cause of the <HI>old Chorus,</HI> his real Design was to introduce a <HI>new</HI> one. For, the Name excepted, I can discern little or nothing in the <HI>Odes</HI> of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> similar to those of the an∣tient <HI>Chorus;</HI> that <Q>poetical Flow of tender Commiseration, of religious Supplication, or of virtuous Triumph,</Q> of which it principally consisted, had none of the <HI>long-spun</HI> Allegory, and <HI>aerial</HI> Imagery with which these <HI>Dramatic</HI> Sonnets of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> abound. In Truth it is to be wish'd that this profest Admirer, and Imitator of genu∣ine Nature, and antient Simplicity in the <HI>Struc∣ture</HI> of his <HI>Fable,</HI> had paid a little more Regard to them in his <HI>Diction</HI> throughout this whole Poem, and particularly in the Stile of the <HI>Choral</HI> Compositions under present Consideration. 'Tis Pity indeed an Author so sober and chaste in his whole Oeconomy, should be so remarkably extra∣vagant and loose in his Language.</P>

<P>—It is wonderful to observe how far a true <HI>Poetic</HI> Fancy lifts a Genius above all <HI>Prosaic</HI> Con∣ception. Most of us profess ourselves Admirers of the <HI>Naked Truth;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> has cloth'd her more splendidly than ever <HI>Solomon</HI> was; tho' I think he has given her rather too fine a <HI>Buckle</HI> for so clumsy a <HI>Girdle.</HI></P>
<P>It is indeed well observ'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> that He who would take Boldness from Poetry, must leave Dulness in the room of it; and I am very sensible that no Species of Poetry is allow'd greater Liberties than the <HI>Ode;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="406"/>
SED NON UT PLACIDIS COEUNT IMMITIA, &amp;C. Boldness is the Medium between <HI>Dulness</HI> and <HI>Temerity;</HI> the Muse has no more Business above the <HI>Clouds,</HI> than she has under the <HI>Ground;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> tho' he never <HI>creeps,</HI> is certainly a <HI>High-Flyer.</HI> The extravagant Thoughts, the far-fetch'd Allusions, and the unconnected Ideas in most of these <HI>Odes</HI> are a Proof of it.—In truth the Heat of Imagination is apt to transport an Author into false Conclusions, and make him believe He writes <HI>Poetry,</HI> because He does not write <HI>Prose.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, I can by no Means agree with Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> that <Q>if we had a <HI>Tragedy</HI> of <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>'s form'd on the <HI>Greek</HI> Model, we should find in it more frequent, if not nobler In∣stances of the high Poetical Capacity, than in any single Composition he has left us.</Q> This Author thinks, <Q>we have a Proof of this in those parts of his Historical Plays, which are call'd <HI>Chorus's,</HI> and written in the common Dialogue Metre.</Q> Our <Q>Imagination (continues he) will easily conceive, how fine an Ode the Description of the Night, preceding the Battle of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> would have made in his Hands; and what additional Grace it would receive from that Form of Composition.</Q> Let us turn to the Description as it now stands in <HI>Shakespear.</HI></P>

<P>—This noble Description is full of Imagery drawn from sensible Objects, as indeed are most of those we meet with in this incomparable Author; (witness for Instance the Description of <HI>Dover Cliff,</HI> of <HI>Hamlet's Madness,</HI> of <HI>Brutus's Disorder,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.) It is consequently of the most affecting Nature, and in a manner possesses the Hearer or the Reader with the same kind of Terrour which the Bravest probably feel upon the Crisis of a decisive Battle. And, by the by, of the same passionate and affecting (i. e. <HI>Dramatic Nature)</HI> are the Poetical Parts of our best <HI>Tragedies</HI> in general. Now I cannot conceive that the seve∣ral Circumstances of this Description could receive additional Force from the Form of an <HI>Ode,</HI> not∣withstanding the acknowledg'd Power of <HI>Music;</HI> and much less that such a Description would ap∣pear
<PB N="305" REF="408"/>
to advantage in an <HI>Ode</HI> of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s. In∣stead of what we <HI>see, hear</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> in the strik∣ing Particulars of the before-mention'd Descrip∣tion, Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> would entertain and amaze us with an allegorical Machine of
<Q><L><HI>Horror</HI> riding on the Brow of Night,</L></Q>
or,
<Q><L>From her black Pinions shedding deadly Dews.</L></Q>
—It is certain whatever might be the Mystic Beauties of such an <HI>Ode</HI> as this, it would at best be a <HI>dispassionate</HI> One, and so far infinitely less <HI>Theatrical,</HI> than the foregoing Description of <HI>Shakespear.</HI> In truth the <HI>pure Poetry</HI> which Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> tells us that great Poet had the Power of introducing naturally, and what is most strange, of joining with <HI>pure Passion,</HI> has an Air utterly different from, or rather contrary to the Flights of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> throughout this Performance. <HI>Shakespear</HI> indeed very rarely gets out of the Reach of our Apprehensions, even when his Sub∣ject leads him directly into the Province of Ima∣gination.—I refer the Reader to his <HI>Midsummer Night's Dream,</HI> his <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and his <HI>Tempest.</HI> Upon the whole of this Article, it may I think, be safely affirm'd that the modern <HI>Drama</HI> is by no means destitute of Opportunities of having recourse to Poetical Embellishments and <HI>Pictu∣resque</HI> Descriptions of all Kinds; and it has re∣course to them, if not so frequently and obviously
<PB N="306" REF="409"/>
as the antient <HI>Drama</HI> by means of the <HI>Chorus</HI> had, at least more consistently with the Essential <HI>Character</HI> of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> whose direct Business it is to excite the Passions, even according to <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>'s own Definition of it. For whether <HI>Images, Descriptions,</HI> &amp;c. occasionally and naturally in∣terspers'd with the Matter of the Dialogue it∣self be not more compatible with that <HI>Character,</HI> than separate and detach'd Peices of Poetry, is a Question that needs not, I conceive, be dis∣cuss'd.—Now if these Considerations will lead us to Conclusions in favour of the Poetical Parts of modern <HI>Tragedy</HI> against those of the old <HI>Chorus,</HI> they will, I am sure, do this <HI>a fortiori</HI> against the <HI>pure Poetry</HI> of Mr. <HI>Mason.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot help observing in this Place, that our Author's Affectation of a <HI>Poetical</HI> Diction, which contributes so much to the rendering the <HI>Odes</HI> of his <HI>Chorus undramatical,</HI> discovers itself likewise in many Parts of the Dialogue itself; and often to such a Degree, that <HI>Pomp, Figure,</HI> and <HI>Allegory</HI> <Q>supply the Place of <HI>Simplicity, Nature, and Pathos.</HI></Q> How allegorically does <HI>Athelwold</HI> express the Passion of Joy, mixt with an Apprehension of imminent Danger?</P>

<P>In short, to this <HI>Spirit</HI> we may perhaps ascribe the Impropriety and <HI>Unseasonableness</HI> of some of Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s most elegant and affecting Images and Descriptions.—But I forbear to multiply Quo∣tations.—Enough, I presume, has been said to shew that Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> throughout this whole Work discovers much more of the <HI>Poet,</HI> than the <HI>Trage∣dian:</HI> He discovers so much indeed of the former, that abating these, and a few other Blemishes and Defects, which I thought it but Justice to my Subject to endeavour to set in a true Light, <HI>Elfrida,</HI> as a <HI>Dramatic Poem,</HI> has many exquisite Beauties; which however (as they must be obvious to judi∣cious
<PB N="310" REF="413"/>
Eyes) I forbear not for Want of Inclination but of Time to recite. Indeed as this Perform∣ance is entitled a <HI>Dramatic Poem,</HI> and not a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> by the Author himself, I should have made no Exceptions to it, if the <HI>Stile</HI> of the <HI>Let∣ters</HI> prefixed to the <HI>Drama</HI> had been as <HI>modest</HI> as the <HI>Title Page.</HI>—But to return once more to the <HI>Chorus.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> <Q>laments that with the Means of introducing Poetry naturally, is lost also the Opportunity of conveying moral Re∣flections with Grace and Propriety.</Q>—He tells us afterwards, <Q>that in those Parts of the <HI>Drama</HI> where the Judgment of a mixt Audience is most liable to be misled by what passes before it's View, the chief Actors are generally too much agitated by the furious Passions, or too much attached by the tender ones, to think cooly, and impress on the Spectators a moral Senti∣ment properly.</Q>—This is indeed asserting roundly, but however, I apprehend, without suf∣ficient Foundation in Reason, or Experience.—I will make bold to assert too, that it is the Busi∣ness of the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poet (and indeed of every other) in a <HI>moral</HI> View to steal imperceptibly into the Heart of his Audience, or Reader; that Sen∣timents <HI>occasionally</HI> and <HI>naturally</HI> suggested by the Circumstances of the Parties personally concerned, will have a more forcible Effect than a thousand <HI>set Lessons</HI> of <HI>Music</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI> from the Mouth of a third Person; and that the chief Actors are
<PB N="311" REF="414"/>
<HI>not</HI> generally "too much agitated by the furious Passions, or attached by the tender ones, to think cooly (enough for the Purpose) and impress on the Spectators a moral Sentiment properly."</P>
<P>In the next Sentence we are told that <Q>A Confidant or Servant has seldom Sense enough to do it, never Dignity enough to be regarded.</Q>—Now, by the way, a Servant or a Confidant may always (if the Poet please) be as sensible a Person as any in the <HI>Drama;</HI> and sure the Dignity of either, at least of the latter is equal to that of the Personages of the antient <HI>Chorus,</HI> which for the most Part consisted of a Company of Virgins, the Attendants and Countrywomen of the Hero of the Poem.—Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s own <HI>Chorus,</HI> with all it's Pomp and Solemnity, is composed of Lord <HI>Athel∣wold</HI>'s <HI>Maids.</HI>—But after all, do the modern <HI>Tragedians</HI> usually convey moral Sentiments thro' the Mouths of <HI>Servants</HI> and <HI>Confidants,</HI> as these Expressions would lead us to imagine; or granting they do, and err in so doing, is the particular Er∣ror of a few to be objected to the general System? Instead therefore of these (and of the <HI>Chorus</HI> too) the Moderns are <Q>sufficiently provided with Per∣sons not merely capable of seeing and hearing, but of arguing, advising, and reflecting; from whom a moral Sentiment never comes un∣naturally, but suitably and gracefully.</Q> For such are (or may be) all the <HI>Persons</HI> in the <HI>Drama.</HI> "The Character of <HI>Pierre</HI> in <HI>Venice Preserv'd</HI>
<PB N="312" REF="415"/>
(Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> justly observes in another Place) <Q>when left entirely to the Judgment of the Au∣dience, is perhaps one of the most improper for public View, that ever was produced on any Stage. It is almost impossible, but some Part of the Spectators should go from the Represen∣tation with very false and immoral Impressions. But had that <HI>Tragedy</HI> been written on the antient Plan; had <HI>Pierre</HI>'s Character been drawn just as it is, and some few Alterations made in <HI>Jaffeir</HI>'s, I know no two Characters more capa∣ble of doing Service in a moral View, when justly animadverted upon by the <HI>Chorus.</HI> For bad Characters become on this Plan as harmless in the Hands of the Poet, as the Historian.</Q> This would indeed be, as I have elsewhere ob∣served, very just Reasoning against any Man that should undertake to vindicate Mr. <HI>Otway</HI>'s Conduct in the <HI>Tragedy</HI> referred to; and to oppose the <HI>same</HI> to the <HI>antient Plan;</HI> but as this never was, or will be done by any Man in his Senses, it is surely in∣conclusive to argue against the Inconveniencies of the whole modern <HI>Dramatic</HI> System from the <HI>particular</HI> Error of a <HI>particular</HI> Poet.—The Truth is, per∣haps this Gentleman has conceived strong Prepos∣sessions in Favour of that <HI>Species</HI> of Poetry, which his Talent evidently leads him to; for if he had not himself a particular <HI>Taste</HI> for an <HI>Ode,</HI> 'tis likely he would scarce contend for it as absolutely essen∣tial
<PB N="313" REF="416"/>
to the <HI>Drama.</HI>—But whatever may have been his real Sentiments upon the Occasion, I hope, I have given sufficient Reasons for differing from him.</P>
<P>Before I conclue I can't help taking Notice, that Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> has drawn Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> himself into his Interests in a very extraordinary Manner; and this I do the rather, as I have more than once re∣ferred to that excellent Person's Authority. Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> among the insuperable Difficulties in the Way to the desired Reformation of the <HI>English</HI> Stage, intimates the present improper Form of the <HI>Theatres;</HI> and the additional Expence requisite for the Purposes of the antient System renders the Matter, he thinks, impracticable. <Q>This, he says, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> foresaw long ago;</Q> and then quotes the following curious Passage from him. <Q>A new Theatre, much more ample and much deeper, must be made for that Purpose; be∣sides the Cost of sometimes forty or fifty Habits: which is an Expence too large to be supplied by a Company of Actors. 'Tis true I should not be sorry to see a <HI>Chorus</HI> on a Theatre, more than as large and as deep again as our's, built and adorned at a King's Charges; and on that Condition, and another, which is, that my Hands were not bound behind me, as now they are, I should not despair of making such a Tragedy, as might be both instructive and delightful, according to the Manner of the <HI>Grecians.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="417"/>
Now does any common Reader apprehend from this Passage, that because Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> tells us, he should not be sorry to see a <HI>Chorus</HI> on a com∣modious Theatre, &amp;c. therefore he ardently wish'd to see one, and judg'd it absolutely essential to the <HI>Drama;</HI> or because he declares that in such Case he should not <HI>despair</HI> of making such a Tragedy as <HI>might</HI> be instructive and delightful according to the Manner of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> therefore he <HI>long'd</HI> to try his Strength in this Field, and acknow∣ledged the grand Secret <HI>prodesse &amp; delectare</HI> was the Characteristic of the <HI>Greek Drama</HI> only? And yet such methinks is Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s Construc∣tion of this Passage."—<Q>This Suffrage of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> says he, is, however, very apposite to to the present Point. But it serves also to vin∣dicate my Design of imitating the Greek Drama. For if he, who was so prejudiced to the modern Stage, as to think Intrigue a capi∣tal Beauty in it; if he, I say, owns that the grand Secret <HI>prodesse &amp; delectare</HI> was the Cha∣racteristic of the Greek Drama only, nothing I think can better justify my present Attempt than the Approbation he gives to it in this Passage.</Q>—That is (to reduce this Suffrage to a smaller Compass) Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> informs us, that if Things were properly circumstanced he would at all Events have attempted a <HI>Tragedy</HI> upon the <HI>Greek</HI> Model, and with <HI>some Hopes</HI> of Success;
<PB N="315" REF="418"/>
therefore he <HI>plainly preferred</HI> the <HI>antient</HI> to the <HI>modern</HI> System.—Let the Merits of the Cause be tried by the Evidence of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> and
<Q><L>Fabio vel Judice vincam.</L></Q>
I have nothing farther to add than that, if the Reader should chance to wonder at the Freedom I have sometimes taken with this truly ingenious Writer, I desire it may be imputed to my natural Resentment of that Air of Sufficiency and Superi∣ority with which he introduces, I do not say his Performance, but his System.—<Q>Good Sense (i. e. <HI>common Sense)</HI> as well as Antiquity re∣quired an Adherence to the Unities.</Q> This peremptory Declaration involves in a very scurvy Term almost every Dramatic Writer but our Au∣thor, and a <HI>Frenchman</HI> or two, since the Days of <HI>Aristotle.</HI> But delicate Judgment it seems and a true Taste for <HI>genuine Nature</HI> and <HI>antient Simplicity</HI> are the Allotments, and Privileges only of a happy Few.—In what Contempt does this Gentleman hold the universal Practice of the <HI>modern</HI> Stage, when he acquaints us, "he believes he could quickly make the whole tolerably fit for an English Audience by putting the Dialogue of the <HI>Cho∣rus</HI> into the Mouth of an <HI>Emma</HI> or <HI>Matilda,</HI> who with some little Shew of sisterly Concernment, might be easily made to claim Kindred with <HI>Earl Athelwold;</HI> and by the Addition of an
<PB N="316" REF="419"/>
unnecessary Incident or two, which would cost him no more than they are worth in contriving, and an unmeaning Personage or two, who would be as little Expence in creating." I confess I see no Sort of Foundation for this Insult and Superio∣rity in the Arguments, or rather Assertions of Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> for which Reason I have written my Thoughts upon this Occasion; otherwise I have no more Pretension to write against him as an <HI>Adversary,</HI> than Desire to enter the Lists with him as a <HI>Poet.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sit down, in compliance with your Request, to give you my Sentiments upon the Subject started at our last Interview.—In consequence of my Researches upon this Occasion I have been almost led into a very whimsical Conclusion,—that the greatest Genius is the Author a Man happens to have in his Hand. It seems but rea∣sonable to pin our Opinion of an Author upon that of his Editor, or Translator; and yet we may do this, till we are in a manner at a loss for a Criterion to judge good Writing by. Genius assumes as many Shapes as ever <HI>Proteus</HI> did; and all literary Merit consists principally in Invention, in Judgment, in Fire, in Propriety, in Simplicity, in Elegance, in Accuracy, in Ease, in Wit, in Humour, in Fullness, in Brevity, &amp;c. &amp;c. ac∣cording to the Spirit, and Complexion of the Writer before me. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> declares, <HI>Homer</HI> was the greatest <HI>Epic</HI> Poet in the World, and I
<PB N="320" REF="422"/>
am quite of his Mind, till I take up Mr. <HI>Mey∣rick</HI>'s <HI>Tryphiodorus.</HI>—When I look into my <HI>Sta∣tius,</HI> I begin to think <HI>Virgil</HI> was a very cold, and insipid Writer; and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Acquaintance assure me that <HI>Statius</HI> was little better than a Mad∣man.—In short by Virtue of the Preface, prefix'd to him, <HI>Sophocles</HI> or <HI>Ovid, Terence</HI> or <HI>Martial, Milton</HI> or <HI>Butler,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. is the best Poet; <HI>Hero∣dotus</HI> or <HI>Eutropius, Livy</HI> or <HI>Sallust, Rapin</HI> or <HI>Cla∣rendon</HI> is the best Historian; <HI>Aristotle</HI> or <HI>Newton, Descartes</HI> or <HI>Burnet,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. is the best Philo∣sopher; and <HI>Hammond</HI> or <HI>Hobbes, South,</HI> or <HI>To∣land, Sherlock</HI> or <HI>Middleton</HI> is the best Divine.—</P>
<P>But to be serious.—You will wonder perhaps to be told, that what gave Rise to these ludicrous Remarks of mine was nothing less than Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Commentary upon his universally, and justly admir'd Original, <HI>Homer;</HI> an Author, whom you will scarce think capable of being compli∣mented, or aggrandiz'd to an undue, and ex∣travagant Degree, especially by so judicious an Editor.—Indeed these great Names are so truly venerable, that I must obviate the Alarm you may take, by assuring you that what I am going to say neither can, nor means to detract from the infinite Merit of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> or the <HI>British Homer;</HI> for the former, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at v. 955 of the 16th B. of the Iliad.</NOTE><Q>I believe upon the
<PB N="321" REF="423"/>
whole that scarce any Mortal ever came near him for Wisdom, Learning, and all good Qua∣lities,</Q> for the latter, He has certainly done more Justice to his Author as an Expositor only, than all the Commentators, antient and modern, put together. After this Declaration you will give me leave to tell you, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself appears to me, notwithstanding his very great Abilities, to have sometimes misapprehended the real Design of his Original, to have not unfre∣quently (to use his own Words again) <Q>attribu∣ted to him what does not belong to him,</Q> and now and then to have imagin'd Proprieties, or cover'd Defects with a seeming View rather to the Honour of his Author at all Events, than to the precise Ascertainment of Truth. All this, indeed, might be owing not to a blind Admira∣tion, or to a Want of Discernment, but to a De∣gree of laudable Partiality, or a too implicit Ad∣herence to the Notions, and Interpretations of the Commentators his Predecessors.</P>
<P>But whatever may be allow'd to an Editor, or Translator, a Stander-by will be more im∣partial, and is, as such, more likely to think justly of an Author. You who turn to your <HI>Homer</HI> merely with an Intent to be delighted with him, and consider Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> as a Person very able and willing to illustrate his great Beau∣ties, and Excellencies, will be apt to sce no
<PB N="322" REF="424"/>
Grounds for the above Allegations, but in an Affectation of Singularity, or in Caprice; espe∣cially as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> makes no Scruple occasionally to point out the Blemishes of his Author, and seems by many Remarks to shew himself thoroughly divested of all unreasonable Prepos∣sessions. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at V. 801.

However, whether I have been actuated by a Spirit of Vanity, or of Humour, rather than just Criticism, you will be able to judge when you have read the following Sheets, in which I pro∣pose to try <HI>Homer</HI> by himself, (as every Writer should by his own Key) and by the Suffrages and Evidence of his own Advocates, and Witnesses. For which Purpose, and for something of Method's sake, the first Subject of our Inquiry shall be the <HI>Machinery</HI> of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the next, the general <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of this great Poet, and his particular Conduct in Respect of <HI>Characters, Incidents,</HI> and other Circumstances. And, I persuade myself, the Result of this Inquiry will be your agreeing with me that <HI>Homer,</HI> with the most fruitful In∣vention, extensive Knowledge, and no small Judg∣ment, has really much less Art, and Design in this Work, than he is supposed to have had; at least for what appears to the contrary from the Observations of his Commentators.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Machinery,</HI> you know, is that Part which the <HI>Gods</HI> bear in an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem. That of <HI>Homer</HI> is conducted with extraordinary Circumstances of Solemnity, and Magnificence. But the great Question is, whether we are in ge∣neral to take the Simple and literal Sense of
<PB N="324" REF="426"/>
the Author with regard to the Appearance, and Actions of these superiour Beings; or whether we are to suppose a secret, and allegorical Mean∣ing to be veil'd under all this <HI>Apparatus;</HI> or, in other Words, whether we can with any Degree of Certainty extract a System of Morality, or Theology from it. This has been attempted to be done by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> and all others who have undertaken to explain, illustrate, or defend the Writings of this inimitable Poet; and it must be own'd too that this has been done in many Places in a very plausible Manner. However I must be of Opinion, upon reviewing the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and com∣paring it with itself, that these Gentlemen have push'd this Matter too far, and by strain'd Expli∣cations, and Refinements, found out Mysteries which were never intended; that, generally speak∣ing, we shall do more Justice, and even Ho∣nour to <HI>Homer</HI> by supposing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at L. 422. B. V.</NOTE><Q>he follow'd Fame, and common Opinion in his Account of the Gods, though no way agreeable to Truth.</Q> Upon this Supposition at least, He will, I think appear much more uniform, and reconcileable with himself. I do not deny indeed that the <HI>Iliad</HI> abounds with noble, and rational Sentiments, and such as are conformable to true Theology; particularly that the Necessity of Divine Assistance
<PB N="325" REF="427"/>
and Interposition for all Human Successes is a Moral strongly inculcated throughout the Poem. But whatever <HI>Homer</HI>'s religious Notions, as a <HI>Man,</HI> might be, or, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> expresses it, <Q>whatever he might <HI>think</HI> of his Gods, he took them as he found them; he brought them into Action according to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in some Stories as they were then believ'd.</Q> If you consider his <HI>Jupi∣ter</HI> as a <HI>Fabulous</HI> or <HI>Poetical</HI> Character, there is less in it to shock you; but if you believe, He meant to exhibit to his Reader under this Character, "the One, supreme, omnipotent God" You must soon have a very mean Opinion not only of his Philosophy, but even of his Sense. 'Tis true, <Q>He sometimes introduces <HI>Jupiter</HI> with a Majesty, and Superiority worthy the great Ruler of the Universe,</Q> particularly in the Beginning of the 8th Book; but he is in general represented as much subject to Weakness, In∣firmity, and Passion as the inferiour Deities. In∣deed, if any Divine Attribute be plainly, and consistently applied to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> it is <HI>Power;</HI> yet even this seems to be applied rather from the Au∣thority of <HI>Fabulous Tradition,</HI> than by the <HI>religious Theory</HI> of the Poet himself. For the Story of the Rebellion of the Gods, and their Defeat by <HI>Jupi∣ter,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> refers to, cannot be understood to be his own Invention. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> acknowleges

<PB N="327" REF="429"/>
<HI>he had us'd to take his Repose.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 609 and 610 of the Iliad.</NOTE>It is worth ob∣serving to you that some Criticks in <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Time objected to the Passage in the second Book, and <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 1. of the 2d B.</NOTE>pretended it was ridiculous to describe all the Gods sleeping besides <HI>Jupiter:</HI></Q> To which, it seems, <HI>Aristotle</HI> answers, <Q>that no∣thing is more usual or allowable than that Fi∣gure which puts <HI>all</HI> for the <HI>greater</HI> part.</Q> A plain Proof, that neither <HI>Aristotle,</HI> nor the above∣mention'd Critics of those Times, suppos'd any extraordinary Degree of Vigilancy could have been with any Propriety ascrib'd by the Poet to <HI>Jupiter.</HI>—Perhaps you will be of Opinion too, that there is a little too much Refinement in ano∣ther Place in the fifth Book, where Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Note of L. 517. of the 5th B.</NOTE><Q>we may observe the Decorum and Decency his Author constantly preserves</Q> in making <HI>Jupiter</HI> only <HI>Smile</HI> upon certain Occasions, while the other Gods <HI>laugh out.</HI></P>
<P>I leave it to you to judge what Sort of a Salvo this must be, allowing any Foundation for the Distinction itself; as indeed I do not recollect there is. There seems at least to be universal Jollity in Heaven in one very remarkable Passage, without any reserve for the Gravity of this Deity; I mean in the first Book, where <HI>Vulcan</HI> <Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See at L. 771. of the 1st B.</NOTE> designs

<Q><L>Vulcan with aukward grace his Office plies,</L>
<L>And unextinguish'd Laughter shakes the Skies.</L></Q>
<P>Thus you see the <HI>Jupiter</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> with all his Pomp and Preeminence, is hardly above a Level with the subordinate Deities in point of corporal Weakness and Infirmity; nor will you find him to rank much higher if you take a View of his Conduct, and Actions in general throughout the Poem. You will observe him upon numberless Occasions under the Influence of Passions utterly unsuitable to the Purity, as well as Dignity of the Supreme Being. The Fiction of his <Q>being deceiv'd and laid asleep,</Q> and of his amorous correspondence with <HI>Juno,</HI> has, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> con∣fesses, as great <Q>an Air of Impiety, and Ab∣surdity</Q> as any Fable in all Antiquity. <Q>I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 179. of the 14th B.</NOTE>must needs, upon the whole, (says that in∣genious Remarker) as far as I can judge, give up the Morality of this Fable; but what Colour of Excuse for it <HI>Homer</HI> might have from antient Tradition, or what mystical, or allegorical Sense might atone for the appearing Impiety, is hard to be ascertain'd at this distant Period of Time.</Q> Here is a Condemnation, and a
<PB N="329" REF="431"/>
Palliation of a Fault in one Breath. Indeed Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> thro' his unabated Zeal for the Honour of his Original, is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note last referred to.</NOTE>willing afterwards to suppose the "present Passage to be grounded on Religion," and to be nothing more than the <Q>Representation of a religious Solemnity; or else to be purely allegorical, and as such implying only</Q> the Congress of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Juno,</HI> the Mingling of the <HI>Aether</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> (which are generally said to be signified by these two Deities.) But I be∣lieve, if you consult the Place, you will think the first Expedient a forc'd one, and the second (allowing the <HI>Physical</HI> Signification of these two Deities) insufficient for the intended Vindication. For what Connection is there in the Mingling of the <HI>Aether</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> with the Matter in Hand? or how does it in the least effect the Circumstances of the Battle between the <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Trojans.</HI> To say nothing of <HI>Venus,</HI> who certainly is no <HI>Physical</HI> Deity, and yet bears a part in this Trans∣action.—The literal, and obvious Sense of <HI>Homer</HI> with all its Grossness seems to be the only con∣sistent one which this Passage can fairly be made to carry.</P>
<P>It is worth while to take Notice of the Shifts the Commentators have recourse to, when they are prest with Difficulties of this Nature. Agree∣ably to the Circumstances of the Extremity, the
<PB N="330" REF="432"/>
Allegories of <HI>Homer</HI> are <HI>Moral,</HI> and <HI>Physical;</HI> <Q>His <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 96. of the 4th B.</NOTE>Heaven is no more than an ideal World of abstracted Beings, and so every Motion which rises in the Mind of Man is attributed to the Quality to which it belongs, with the Name of the Deity who is supposed to pre∣side over that Quality superadded to it;</Q> <Q>the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 439. of the 8th B.</NOTE>Deities sometimes mean no more than Beings that presided over the Passions and Faculties of the Mind, and in consequence of all this <HI>Jupiter</HI> is either the <HI>Aether,</HI> or the <HI>Father of Gods and Men, Juno</HI> is the Goddess of <HI>Honour</HI> or the <HI>Air,</HI> and <Q><HI>Minerva</HI> the Goddess not only of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> but of <HI>Craft;</HI> that is, both of <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false</HI> Wisdom,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. as Occasions and Exigencies require.—Now 'tis certain by these Means any Difficulty may be solved, and any Passage in this Author pretty easily cleared; but all this while the Question is, whether any System can be ascertained. Nay in Places where the Meaning of the Author is irreconcileable with allegorical Construction, it is supposed to <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Note at 566. B. xxi.</NOTE>be "darkened by the Remoteness of our Time." A hidden and mysterious Sense there plainly <HI>is,</HI> or certainly <HI>must</HI> be; and we must at all Events, and tho' apparent Absurdities will be saved by it, reject a <HI>literal</HI> Interpertation of <HI>Homer</HI> where
<PB N="331" REF="433"/>
the Gods are concerned. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself owns that sometimes <HI>Homer</HI>'s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Essay on Homer, P. 56, 57.</NOTE>Machine's play a little too Grossly, and that the Fable vio∣lently oppresses the Moral, which it may be lost Labour to search for in every minute Cir∣cumstance, if indeed it was intended to be there.</Q> In Truth, I am apt to think we should read this Poet with more Pleasure, and equal Profit, if we perplexed ourselves less to find out Mysteries in him; and by the way, it is scarce worth our Pains to investigate hidden Meanings, when the plain and literal Moral of the Poem is as obvious upon a thousand Occasions as it is ad∣mirable and excellent. If you consider the <HI>Ma∣chinery</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> in a <HI>Poetical,</HI> rather than a <HI>Theo∣logical,</HI> or <HI>Philosophical</HI> Light, and suppose his Gods to be real Characters acting under the In∣fluence of Human Passions, as antient Fables re∣presented them, and taking their Measures from Motives of personal Affection, Resentment, &amp;c. &amp;c. I believe you will have a surer Inlet into the Meaning of this famous Author, and be able to examine him by Rules not liable to Difficulties, which are only to be removed by forced, and un∣natural Solutions.—But as there is a Novelty in this Opinion, You will expect I should strengthen and confirm it by more Reasons, and Observations.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 422. B. v.</NOTE>famous Censure of <HI>Tully,</HI> and <HI>Lon∣ginus</HI> (mentioned by Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> that <HI>Homer makes God's of his Heroes, and Mortals of his Gods,</HI></Q> will appear to be groundless, if you regulate your Ideas of this Author by the Notions I have conceived of him. For pure <HI>Poetical</HI> Fictions, whether invented or adopted by <HI>Homer,</HI> come not properly under the Cog∣nisance of a <HI>Philosophical</HI> Inquiry. Accordingly we shall not only have a ready Excuse for this great Poet when he introduces his Deities <Q>feast∣ing, fighting, wounded by Men, and shedding a Sort of Blood;</Q> but also when they are represen∣ted as committing Actions unworthy of themselves, and of the respective Characters they are supposed by the common Opinion of Commentators to sus∣tain. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> allows that <Q>if <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 96. B. iv.</NOTE>the <HI>Trojans</HI> had no Right to break the Treaty,</Q> made be∣tween them and the <HI>Grecians</HI> upon the Duel of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> <Q>the Machine where <HI>Juno</HI> is made to propose Perjury, <HI>Jupiter</HI> to allow it, and <HI>Minerva</HI> to be commissioned to hasten the Execution of it, would be <HI>one</HI> of the hardest to be reconciled to Reason in the whole Poem.</Q> Whether therefore the <HI>Trojans</HI> had a Right to
<PB N="333" REF="435"/>
break the Treaty is a Question, it will be very Material, and, I think, easy to determine. Now that "the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 18. B. iv.</NOTE>Conditions of the Treaty were valid" notwithstanding the snatching away of <HI>Paris</HI> by <HI>Venus</HI> in a Cloud, "that is to say, that" the Con∣troversy was to be decided <HI>(either)</HI> by the <HI>Victory,</HI> or by the <HI>Death</HI> of one of the Combatants, is, I apprehend, apparent from many Considerations. It is certain, <Q>in the first proposal of the Challenge <HI>Paris</HI> mentions only the Victory, <HI>And who his Rival shall in Arms Subdue;</HI></Q> nor does <HI>Hector,</HI> who carries it, say any more.</P>
<P>However (continues the Note) <HI>Menelaus</HI> un∣derstands it of the Death by what he replies:
<Q><L>Fall he that must beneath his Rivals Arms,</L>
<L>And live the rest—</L></Q>
And in the solemn Oath too <HI>Agamemnon</HI> specifies the latter, <HI>"If by Paris slain"</HI>—and <Q><HI>If by my Brother's Arms the</HI> TROJAN <HI>bleed.</HI></Q> <HI>Priam</HI> also understands it of both, saying, at his leaving the Field,
<Q><L>Whose Arms shall conquer, and whose Prince shall fall,</L>
<L>Heav'n only knows—</L></Q>
<HI>Paris</HI> himself confesses he has lost the Victory in his Speech to <HI>Helen,</HI> which he would hardly have done had the whole depended upon that alone; and lastly <HI>Menelaus</HI> (after the Conquest is clearly
<PB N="334" REF="436"/>
his by the Flight of <HI>Paris)</HI> is still searching round the Field to kill him, as if all were of no Effect without the Death of his Adversary.—It appears from hence (says Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> <Q>that the <HI>Trojans</HI> had no ill pretence to break the Treaty, so that <HI>Homer</HI> ought not to have been directly accused of making <HI>Jupiter</HI> the Author of Perjury in what follows, which is one of the chief of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Ob∣jections against him.</Q></P>
<P>But was it not extremely natural for <HI>Menelaus, Agamemnon,</HI> and <HI>Priam</HI> to <HI>mention</HI> the <HI>Death</HI> of one of the Combatants as the Decision of the Controversy, tho' the Terms at the Challenge <HI>specified Victory</HI> only, in as much as the <HI>Death</HI> of one seem'd to be the unavoidable Consequence of the Duel, and the Deliverance of <HI>Paris</HI> by <HI>Venus</HI> was a Circumstance that could not possibly be foreseen? For <HI>Paris,</HI> he could not be so ab∣surd as to deny the Loss of the Victory, whatever Shifts he might be drove to evade the Articles of the Combat—indeed he seems to hint at the Expedient of a second Engagement.—
<Q><L>This Day the Foe prevail'd by <HI>Pallas'</HI> pow'r;</L>
<L>We yet may vanquish in a happier Hour.—</L></Q>
And lastly, for <HI>Menelaus,</HI> he might very naturally "search round the Field to kill his Adversary" not for the effectual Determination of the Con∣troversy, but for the Gratification of his <HI>personal</HI> Resentment.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="437"/>
Be this as it will; whatever private Persons might think of this Affair, it is plain the <HI>Greeks</HI> looked upon the War as ended by this great Event, and accordingly <HI>Agamemnon</HI> calls upon the <HI>Trojans</HI> to fulfill the Conditions of the Treaty.</P>
<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>Trojans, Dardans,</HI> all our gen'rous Foes!</L>
<L>Hear and attest! from Heav'n with Conquest crown'd,</L>
<L>Our Brother's Arms the just Success have found:</L>
<L>Be therefore now the <HI>Spartan</HI> Wealth restor'd,</L>
<L>Let <HI>Argive Helen</HI> own her lawful Lord—&amp;c. &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>But, in a Word, to put the Matter out of all Doubt, the very Terms at the Commission given to <HI>Minerva,</HI> suppose the Conditions of the Treaty to be binding upon the <HI>Trojans.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>The Sire of Men, and Monarch of the Sky,</L>
<L>Th' Advice approv'd, and bade <HI>Minerva</HI> fly,</L>
<L>Dissolve the League, and all her Arts employ</L>
<L>To make the Breach the faithless Act of <HI>Troy.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>These two last Circumstances Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> for Reasons obvious enough, takes not the least Notice of: Indeed he found himself so prest by the Dif∣ficulties with which this whole Transaction is sur∣rounded, that he is forced to have Recourse to one of the Expedients above-mentioned, viz. that of supposing, <Q><HI>Homer</HI>'s Heaven to be <HI>sometimes</HI> no more than an ideal World of abstracted Be∣ings, &amp;c. &amp;c. agreeably to this Notion he re∣solves the Business into this <HI>easy Allegory,</HI> as
<PB N="336" REF="438"/>
he is pleased to call it.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 96. B. iv.</NOTE><HI>Pandarus</HI> (who broke the Truce by shooting an Arrow at <HI>Mene∣laus)</HI> thinks it <HI>Prudence</HI> to gain Honour and Wealth at the Hands of the <HI>Trojans</HI> by destroy∣ing <HI>Menelaus.</HI> This Sentiment is also incited by a Notion of <HI>Glory,</HI> of which <HI>Juno</HI> is represented as Goddess. <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who is supposed to know the Thoughts of Men, permits the Action which he is not Author of, &amp;c. &amp;c."</P>
<P>But how is all this to be reconciled with the general Rules of Interpretation, or with what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 120.</NOTE>tells us in the very next Note, <Q>The Goddess went not to the <HI>Trojans,</HI> because they hated <HI>Paris,</HI> and would rather have given him up, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See L. 565. at the last B.</NOTE>than have done an ill Action for him: She therefore looks among the Allies, and finds <HI>Pandarus,</HI> who was of a Nation noted for <HI>Perfidiousness,</HI> and had a Soul <HI>avaricious</HI> enough to be capable of engaging in this Treachery for the Hopes of a Reward from <HI>Paris.</HI></Q> From what Principles of <HI>Prudence</HI> then or of <HI>Honour</HI> did <HI>Pandarus</HI> act? or, lastly, how can <HI>Jupiter</HI> be said barely to <HI>permit,</HI> what he ex∣pressly <HI>commands?</HI> It is out of the Power of <HI>Al∣legory</HI> and <HI>Refinement</HI> to salve the Characters of these Deities upon the present Occasion.—But according to the Notion I have formed of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
<PB N="337" REF="439"/>
Deities, there will be nothing puzzling in all this Affair.—I can suppose <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> to be actuated by a Desire of <HI>personal</HI> Vengeance on the <HI>quondam Judgment of Paris;</HI> and indeed I am warranted in this Supposition almost by the pre∣sent Behaviour of these Goddesses, but clearly I presume, by a Passage in the 24th Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> where the Poet informs us that these very Deities (with <HI>Neptune)</HI> opposed the Proposal of all the rest, to dispatch <HI>Mercury</HI> to steal away the Body of <HI>Hector,</HI> purely from the implacable Hatred they bore to <HI>Troy</HI> ever since that fatal Determination.</P>
<LG>
<L>—<HI>Pallas</HI> this denies,</L>

<L>What Time young <HI>Paris,</HI> simple Shepherd Boy,</L>
<L>Won by destructive Lust, (Reward obscene)</L>
<L>Their Charms rejected for the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Queen.</L>
</LG>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> maintains the Authenticity of this Passage, which it seems some of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 36. B. xxiv.</NOTE>Antients had disputed, who <Q>judged it as an Indecency that the Goddess of <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> should be equally inexorable.</Q> They thought farther that, <Q>had <HI>Homer</HI> been acquainted with the Judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> he would undoubtedly have mentioned it before this time in his Poem, &amp;c." It may be answered, (replies Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> that the
<PB N="338" REF="440"/>
Silence of <HI>Homer</HI> in the foregoing Part of the Poem, as to the Judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> is no Argument that he was ignorant of that Story: Perhaps he might think it most proper to un∣fold the <HI>Cause</HI> of the Destruction of <HI>Troy</HI> in the Conclusion of the <HI>Ilias;</HI> that the Reader see∣ing the Wrong done, and the Punishment of that Wrong immediately following, might ac∣knowledge the Justice of it.</Q> According to this Observation, which confirms what I have been saying, we must look beyond the Rape of <HI>Helen,</HI> for the original Cause of the Destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and for the <HI>Wrong</HI> done which so much exasperated these Goddesses. <Q>The same Rea∣son (proceeds the Note) will be an Answer to the Objection relating to the Anger of <HI>Pallas: Wisdom</HI> cannot be satisfied without <HI>Justice,</HI> and consequently <HI>Pallas,</HI> ought not to cease from Resentment, till <HI>Troy,</HI> has suffered the Deserts of her Crimes.</Q>—Now whether <HI>that</HI> Crime of <HI>Paris</HI> could fairly be considered as the Crime of <HI>Troy,</HI> and whether therefore <HI>Wisdom</HI> could with <HI>Justice</HI> pursue it to the Destruction of a whole People, a Novice in Casuistry may determine.—If we suppose, by the by, that the <HI>Juno</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> was copied from this Original, as there is, I think, no Doubt but she was, we find that Poet in plain Terms ascribing the Ill∣will of this Goddess towards the <HI>Trojans</HI> to be the Affront put upon her by <HI>Paris.</HI>

who is concerned to revenge an Jnjury done to the Nuptial Bed, but likewise as the Goddess who represents Monarchical Government, which was better established in <HI>Greece</HI> than any where else; <HI>Pallas,</HI> because being the Goddess of <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> she ought to assist those who are wronged; besides the <HI>Greeks</HI> understood the Art of War better than the <HI>Barbarians; Nep∣tune,</HI> because he was an Enemy to the <HI>Trojans</HI> upon Account of <HI>Laomedon</HI>'s perfidiousness, and because most of the <HI>Greeks</HI> being come from Islands, or Peninsulas, they were in some Sort his Subjects; <HI>Mercury,</HI> because he is a God who presides over Stratagems of War, and be∣cause <HI>Troy</HI> was taken by that of the Wooden Horse; and lastly, <HI>Vulcan,</HI> as the declared Ene∣my of <HI>Mars</HI> and of all Adulterers, and as the Father of Arts.—The Reasons why <HI>Mars,</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> engage for the <HI>Trojans</HI> are very obvious; the Point in Hand was to favour Ravishers, and Debauchees. But the same Reason, you will say, does not serve for <HI>Apollo, Diana,</HI> and <HI>La∣tona.</HI> It is urg'd that <HI>Apollo</HI> is for the <HI>Trojans,</HI> because of the Darts, and Arrows which were the principal Strength of the <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and <HI>Diana</HI> because she presided over Dancing, and those <HI>Barbarians</HI> were great Dancers; and <HI>La∣tona,</HI> as influenc'd by her Children. <HI>Xanthus</HI> be∣ing a <HI>Trojan</HI> River is interested for his Country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="443"/>
Now whether these are not rather <HI>ingenious</HI> than <HI>solid</HI> Reasons is, in my Mind, scarce a Question.—For all that is here asserted is far from being true. <Q><HI>All</HI> the Gods who preside over Arts and Sciences are not on the Side of the <HI>Greeks:</HI></Q> <HI>Apollo,</HI> who is surely one of the most considerable of them being the perpetual Patron of <HI>Troy;</HI> so that <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> never meant by <HI>this</HI> Adjustment to <Q>signify how much in this respect the <HI>Greeks</HI> excelled all other Nations. <HI>Juno,</HI> and <HI>Pallas,</HI> as plau∣sible as the Reasons here alledged for their siding with the <HI>Grecians</HI> may seem to be, act in this Affair, by their own <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 30. &amp;c. B. iv.</NOTE>Confessions, as we have seen, from very different Motives; nor will it follow, by the Way, that because the latter of these Goddesses assisted the <HI>Greeks, therefore Homer</HI> would intimate that the <HI>Greeks</HI> understood the Art of War better than the <HI>Bar∣barians:</HI></Q> for as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> observes upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s introducing <HI>Apollo</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Trojans</HI> in the fourth Book, <Q><HI>Mars</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 585.

of <HI>this</HI> God in <HI>their</HI> Behalf, as is in the Passage before us to that of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> from the Consideration of the Aid of <HI>Minerva.</HI>—But far∣ther, <HI>Neptune</HI> it seems, is for the <HI>Greeks,</HI> <Q>be∣cause he was an Enemy to the <HI>Trojans,</HI> upon Account of <HI>Laomedon</HI>'s Perfidiousness, and be∣cause most of the <HI>Greeks</HI> being come from Islands or Peninsulas, they were in some Sort his Subjects.</Q> Now <HI>Laomedons</HI>'s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 525. B. xxi.</NOTE>Perfidious∣ness consisted in the Refusal of the Wages due to this God on Account of the Building of the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> and in other ill-usage, and so we are to look upon <HI>Neptune</HI>'s espousing the <HI>Grecian</HI> Cause, as the Effect of his Resentment of those <HI>personal</HI> Indignities; and in this Light he is only acting in conformity to the Idea I have framed of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>'s Gods in general: But why the <HI>Greeks</HI> can with more Propriety be called <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Subjects because they came from <HI>Islands</HI> or <HI>Peninsulas,</HI> than the <HI>Trojans</HI> themselves, who inhabited a <HI>Sea-port</HI> Town, (for which very reason Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> conjec∣tures, <HI>Homer</HI> ascribes the Building of the Wall to <HI>Neptune</HI> only) I confess I am at a loss to discover.—Again, <HI>Mercury,</HI> we are informed is a Partisan of the <HI>Grecians</HI> <Q>because he is a God who pre∣sides over Stratagems of War, and because <HI>Troy</HI> was taken by that of the Wooden Horse;</Q>—
<PB N="343" REF="445"/>
Now the ingenuity of the Stratagem of the wooden Horse, if we believe <HI>Virgil,</HI> we must ascribe not to <HI>Mercury,</HI> but to <HI>Pallas.</HI>
<Q><L>Instar Montis equum divinâ <HI>Palladis</HI> arte Aedificant:</L></Q>
However, to let this Deity have the Credit of it; I would only ask whether, supposing he had been introduced by <HI>Homer</HI> on the Part of <HI>Troy,</HI> the Sagacity of <HI>Eustathius</HI> would not have assigned as specious a Reason for it as the present. I can conceive it to be this. Mercury <HI>is for the</HI> Tro∣jans <HI>because he presides over Thieves and Robbers, and is the Favourer of all clandestine Enter∣prizes, such as was the Rape of</HI> Helen <HI>by</HI> Paris.—But lastly, <HI>Vulcan</HI> assists the <HI>Greeks</HI> <Q>as the declared Enemy of <HI>Mars</HI> and of all Adulterers, and as the Father of Arts.</Q> True—his <HI>per∣sonal</HI> Enmity to <HI>Mars,</HI> and <HI>consequentially</HI> to <HI>all</HI> Adulterers, it is granted naturally engaged him on the <HI>Grecian</HI> Side;—but as the Father of the <HI>Mechanical</HI> Arts methinks, he should have fought <HI>under Apollo</HI> the Father of the <HI>liberal</HI> ones.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <Q>the Reasons, says <HI>Eu∣stathius,</HI> why <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> engage for the <HI>Trojans</HI> are very obvious; the Point in Hand was to favour Ravishers and Debauchees, ra∣ther a <HI>Ravisher,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> If <HI>all</HI> the above-assigned Reasons had been as obvious as these, it had in∣deed
<PB N="344" REF="446"/>
been scarce worth while to have entered into a Discussion of this Matter; but it would be ex∣traordinary if there were <HI>no</HI> Circumstances to <HI>colour</HI> the Hypothesis of the Commentators.—Opi∣nions, all this while, are not to be grounded on a <HI>few</HI> Circumstances that are contrasted by <HI>many</HI> others.—The Reasons given for the Assistance of the other Deities to <HI>Troy,</HI> which indeed are de∣livered with an Air of Diffidence, are most of them far-fetched. <Q>It is urged that <HI>Apollo</HI> is for the <HI>Trojans,</HI> because of the Darts and Arrows which were the principal Strength of the <HI>Bar∣barians;</HI></Q> supposing, but by the way not ad∣mitting, the Truth of which Assertion itself, might not <HI>Apollo,</HI> who is <HI>Destiny</HI> according to the com∣mon Notion, have been represented with much more Significancy as opposing <HI>Troy,</HI> whose De∣struction was determined by <HI>Fate?</HI> One Reason <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 544. B. xxi.</NOTE>given by <HI>Dacier</HI> in the next Book, why <HI>Apollo</HI> declines fighting with <HI>Neptune</HI> is, because <HI>Apollo</HI> <Q>being the same with <HI>Destiny,</HI> and the Ruin of the <HI>Trojans</HI> being concluded upon and decided, that God can no longer defer it.</Q> According to this, <HI>Apollo</HI> by taking the Part of <HI>Troy</HI> seems to have been Fighting against himself.—But <HI>Diana</HI> attach'd herself to the <HI>Trojan</HI> Interests, we are let to know, <Q>because she presided over
<PB N="345" REF="447"/>
<HI>Dancing,</HI> and those <HI>Barbarians</HI> were great <HI>Dancers;</HI></Q> it may be so; and yet I am apt to think the Goddess of <HI>Chastity</HI> acts a little out of <HI>Character</HI> here, and by aiding and abetting these <HI>Dancers,</HI> Ravishers, and Debauchees, is in danger to be taken <HI>tripping.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Latona,</HI> if she was <Q>influenced by her <HI>Children</HI></Q> she was a very <HI>Dutiful Mother;</HI> and <HI>Xanthus</HI> being a <HI>Trojan</HI> River" is very Natu∣rally, and without <HI>any</HI> Design or Artifice of the Poet, "interested for his Country."</P>
<P>Do you not begin to believe upon this Review of the Matter, which I hope you will think a fair and impartial one, that <Q>this Division of the Gods in <HI>Homer,</HI> was made much more at <HI>ran∣dom</HI></Q> than <HI>Eustathius</HI> would have persuaded you it was; and that the Gods upon <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Permission to them to assist either Party in the Beginning of this Book, gratified their <HI>personal</HI> Inclinations, and Affections;—Nay <HI>Jupiter</HI> him∣self supposes they had done, and would do this.</P>

<P><HI>Minerva,</HI> whom we may observe, <HI>Homer</HI> repre∣sents in this Engagement as superiour to <HI>Mars</HI> in point of <HI>bodily Strength,</HI> not by Virtue of any <HI>Art</HI> or <HI>Stratagem,</HI> insults her vanquished Anta∣gonist in the Language of a <HI>Conquerour,</HI> instead of reproving his Rashness in a Style that would have better become the Goddess of <HI>Wisdom:</HI>

The same Goddess next attacks <HI>Venus,</HI> and easily overcomes her, which Circumstance may, I ap∣prehend, be best literally understood; for in an Allegorical Sense, <HI>Venus</HI> might have been at least a <HI>Match</HI> for <HI>Minerva,</HI> as <HI>Love</HI> often takes Posses∣sion of the <HI>bravest</HI> Heart, and is irresistible by the <HI>wisest</HI> Counsels.—And if <HI>Venus</HI> had been vic∣torious here, I make no Doubt but that Sense would have been put upon this Passage.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="449"/>
<HI>Neptune</HI> addresses himself to <HI>Apollo</HI> in a long Speech, in which he recapitulates the injurious Treatment they had both met with from <HI>Laome∣don,</HI> and wonders at that God's Forgetfulness, and Forgiveness of the same: But he drops not a single Syllable that intimates himself to be the <HI>Represen∣tative</HI> of <HI>Humidity,</HI> or <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Dryness</HI> upon this Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>Juno</HI> gives <HI>Diana</HI> most abusive Language, and "Boxes her soundly" into the Bargain, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> expresses it;—but I see no Clue to a Mystery in all this Business, nor any Thing suitable to the <HI>Emblematical</HI> Characters of either Goddess.</P>
<P>Lastly, upon <HI>Mercury</HI>'s declining to fight with <HI>Latona,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> borrows this Remark from <HI>Eu∣stathius;</HI> that, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 580.</NOTE> It is impossible that <HI>Mercury</HI> should encounter <HI>Latona;</HI> such a Fiction would be unnatural, he being a Planet and she re∣presenting the Night; for the Planets owe all their Lustre to the Shades of the Night, and then only become visible to the World.</Q>—This Commentator in another Place <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 91.

<PB N="348" REF="450"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 91.

But I will take Occasion once more to resume this Argument.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="letter">

<P>IT bears hard, I presume, upon the Notion of an allegorical Meaning's being couched under the Appearances and Actions of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Deities, that we are so often at a Loss for any Reason to be al∣ledg'd for them, or cannot give one with Con∣sistency, and Propriety. If this did not abun∣dantly appear to be the Case from what has been laid before you, we might proceed to ask, how it comes to pass that the Interposition of <HI>Juno</HI> in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See B. xvi. L. 540, &amp;c.</NOTE>16th Book prevents <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s seeming Design to save <HI>Sarpedon?</HI> Why does <HI>she</HI> interpose at all, or why is this the Effect of it? How comes <HI>this</HI> Goddess to interfere in the present Passage, and <HI>Minerva</HI> in the <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See B. xxii. L. 233.</NOTE>22d Book, when <HI>Jupiter</HI> dis∣covers the same Inclination to deliver <HI>Hector?</HI>—
<PB N="349" REF="451"/>
If <HI>Eustathius</HI> rightly observes that <Q>the Conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> is remarkably just and rational,</Q> in the fifth Book of the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See L. 540. B. v.</NOTE><HI>Iliad,</HI> where he tells us <HI>Diomed</HI> notwithstanding his intrepid Character retired from <HI>Apollo,</HI> because <Q>it was impossible for him to vanquish <HI>Apollo,</HI> in whatsoever Ca∣pacity he is considered, either as the <HI>Sun,</HI> or as <HI>Destiny;</HI> how is it that the same Com∣mentator commends in another Place a Con∣duct, which is the very Reverse of this? How <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 110. B. xvii.</NOTE>observable, says he, or rather Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Name, is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Art of illustrating the Valour, and Glory of his Heroes? <HI>Menelaus,</HI> who sees <HI>Hector</HI> and all the <HI>Trojans</HI> rushing upon him, would not retire if <HI>Apollo</HI> did not support them; and though <HI>Apollo</HI> does support them, he would oppose even <HI>Apollo,</HI> were <HI>Ajax</HI> but near him.</Q> According to this Remark (if it is reconcileable with the former) <HI>Menelaus</HI> behaves with more <HI>Intrepidity</HI> or rather <HI>Rashness</HI> than <HI>Diomed</HI> himself; and yet neither are the <HI>Characteristics</HI> of that Hero, of whom we shall have something more to say by and by. In the seventh Book, <HI>Apollo,</HI> we are informed, <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 328. B. vii.</NOTE>comes very opportunely to save his favourite <HI>Hector</HI></Q> who is overpowered by <HI>Ajax.</HI> <Q><HI>Eustathius</HI> says, that <HI>Apollo</HI> is the very same with <HI>Destiny;</HI> so that when <HI>Homer</HI> says
<PB N="350" REF="452"/>
<HI>Apollo</HI> saved him, he means no more than that it was not his Fate yet to die.</Q> Now methinks, if this Observation is justly made, this Deity should appear to the Relief of every Hero in the like Extremity: And yet it is <HI>Venus</HI> who saves <HI>Paris</HI> in the third Book, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> in the fifth; as <HI>Neptune</HI> does the latter this same good Office in the twentieth.</P>
<P>It belongs to the Advocates of the common No∣tion to solve all these Difficulties, and many more that might be added to them.—In the mean Time I would have you turn your Eyes to a Pas∣sage or two, where the <HI>Allegory</HI> is supposed to be self-evident, and tell me whether the Matter be so undeniably clear as the Illustrations of the Commentators pretend to make it. The Descent of <HI>Minerva</HI> in the first Book to prevent <HI>Achilles'</HI> attempting the Life of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is descanted upon at large as a Passage of this Nature. <Q>The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 261. B. i.</NOTE><HI>Allegory</HI> here (says Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> may be al∣lowed by every Reader to be unforced: The <HI>Prudence</HI> of <HI>Achilles</HI> checks him in the rashest Moment of his Anger, it works upon him un∣seen to others, but does not entirely prevail upon him to desist till he remembers his own Importance, and depends upon it, that there will be a Necessity of their courting him at any Expence into their Alliance again. Having
<PB N="351" REF="453"/>
persuaded himself by such Reflections, he for∣bears to attack his General, but thinking that he sacrifices enough to Prudence by this For∣bearance, lets the Thought of it vanish from him; and no sooner is Wisdom gone, but he falls into more violent Reproaches for the Gra∣tification of his Passion. All this is a most beautiful Passage, whose Moral is evident, and generally agreed on by the Commentators.</Q></P>
<P>Now had <HI>Minerva</HI> only been the Actress in this Affair, all this had been a very natural <HI>Explica∣tion;</HI> but <HI>Homer</HI> gives us to understand that <HI>Mi∣nerva</HI> was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 262.</NOTE>dispatched by <HI>Juno</HI> (the Goddess of <HI>Honour)</HI> on this Errand. If therefore <HI>Juno</HI> be not an utterly insignificant Personage in this Trans∣action, the <HI>Honour</HI> as well as the <HI>Prudence</HI> of <HI>Achilles</HI> must be supposed to suggest his present Conduct to him. But as a <HI>Soldier,</HI> and a <HI>passionate</HI> one too, no doubt he must think himself obliged in Point of <HI>Honour</HI> to take <HI>immediate</HI> Satisfaction for the Affront which had been put upon him; and so his <HI>Honour</HI> suggests, what his <HI>Prudence</HI> forbids. As <HI>allegorical</HI> Persons therefore I can't think but <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> appear together with <HI>some Force</HI> in this <HI>Machine.</HI> Nor, by the way, does it seem agreeable to the Cha∣racter of the Goddess of <HI>Wisdom</HI> to suffer <HI>Achilles</HI> to break out into such scurrilous and virulent Ex∣pressions
<PB N="352" REF="454"/>
as he makes Use of in his next Speech to <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> he does this when <HI>Wisdom</HI> is gone, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says, but still it was by her <HI>Permission,</HI> one might say <HI>Direction</HI> indeed.
<Q><L>The Force of keen Reproaches let him feel. <BIBL>l. 279.</BIBL></L></Q>
The Original is stronger, and contains a more unlimited Commission; and in consequence of it <HI>Achilles</HI> rates his General with a Vengeance;
<Q><L>O Monster! mix'd of Insolence, and Fear;</L>
<L>Thou Dog in Forehead, but in Heart a Deer!</L>
<BIBL>l. 297, &amp;c.</BIBL></Q>
Even this Passage then you see is not clear of Difficulties, and as much as may be said in De∣fence of the allegorical Interpretation, the literal Sense is at least easy, and liable to no Exception.</P>
<P>I will only desire you to turn once more to the fifth Book, of which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> observes, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at the End of B. v.</NOTE><Q>the Allegory lies so open, is carried on with such Closeness, and wound up with so much Full∣ness and Strength, that it is a Wonder how it could enter into the Imagination of any Critic, that <HI>these</HI> Actions of <HI>Diomed</HI> were only a daring and extravagant Fiction in <HI>Homer,</HI> as if he af∣fected the <HI>marvellous</HI> at any Rate. The great Moral of it is, that a brave Man should not contend against Heaven, but resist only <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> Incontinence and ungoverned Fury.</Q>
<PB N="353" REF="455"/>
—<Q>Nothing is more observable than the parti∣cular Care <HI>Homer</HI> has taken to shew he designed this Moral.</Q>—<Q><HI>Minerva,</HI> at the Beginning of the Battle, is made to give this Precept to <HI>Diomed: Fight not against the Gods, but give Way to them, and resist only</HI> VENUS. The Hero himself, as soon as he has performed her Dictates in driving away <HI>Venus,</HI> cries out not as to the <HI>Goddess,</HI> but as to the Passion, <HI>Thou hast no Business with Warriors, is it not enough that thou deceivest weak Women?</HI> Even the Mother of <HI>Venus,</HI> while she comforts her Daughter, bears Testimony to the Moral: <HI>That Man</HI> (says she) <HI>is not long liv'd who contends with the Gods.</HI> And when <HI>Diomed,</HI> transported by his Nature, proceeds but a Step too far, <HI>Apollo</HI> discovers himself in the most solemn Manner, and de∣clares this Truth in his own Voice, as it were by direct Revelation: <HI>Mortal, forbear, consider and know the vast Difference there is between the Gods and thee,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Now in the first Place I am afraid <HI>Homer</HI> will not appear to have been so <HI>particularly</HI> careful to shew he designed this Moral, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would make us believe. For though <HI>Diomed</HI> was com∣manded <Q>in the Beginning of the Battle to give Way to the Gods, and resist only <HI>Venus,</HI> he is afterwards empowered to attack <HI>Mars,</HI> and <HI>any</HI> Deity that should come in his Way;</Q>
<Q><PB N="354" REF="456"/>
Not <HI>Mars</HI> himself, nor <HI>Ought immortal</HI> fear.

Accordingly he is directed in the <HI>Original</HI> to fall upon <HI>Mars</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 829 of the 5th Book of the Iliad.</NOTE><HI>first;</HI> and therefore though he <HI>actu∣ally</HI> attacks no other God, he seems to have been sufficiently authorised to do it, which is a Circum∣stance that clashes with the Allegory.—But what bears still harder upon it in my Opinion is this, that though the Poet speaks in high Terms of the Bravery and Intrepidity of this Hero, and of the Honour he had to be under the immediate Pro∣tection of <HI>Minerva,</HI> yet he represents his wound∣ing of <HI>Venus,</HI> and contending with the heavenly Powers, as Acts of the highest Rashness and Impiety.

<P>I can't help transcribing to you Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note upon this Place, who begins now to be of the same Sentiment. <Q>A quick Change of Mind from the greatest <HI>Impiety</HI> to as great Superstition is frequently observable in Men, who having been guilty of the greatest Crimes without any Remorse, on the sudden are filled with Doubts and Scruples about the most lawful or indiffer∣ent Actions. This seems the present Case of
<PB N="356" REF="458"/>
<HI>Diomed,</HI> who having knowingly wounded and insulted the Deities, is now afraid to engage the first Man he meets, lest perhaps a God might be concealed in that Shape.</Q> I confess this <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Diomed,</HI> which violently shakes the Allegory in Question, appears to me inconsistent likewise with the Tenor of this Hero's Character; nor can I think Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> brings him off when he acquaints us in the following Note, that <Q>what <HI>Diomed</HI> here says is the Effect of Remorse, as if he had exceeded the Commission of <HI>Pallas</HI> in encountring with the Gods, and dreaded the Consequences of proceeding too far. At least he had no such Commission now, and besides, was no longer capable of distinguishing them from Men (a Faculty she had given him in the foregoing Book). He there mentions this Story of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> as an Example that sufficed to ter∣rify him from so rash an Undertaking.</Q></P>
<P>Now in the first Place it by no Means appears that this Commission was expired, or that Fa∣culty ceas'd; at least the contrary may be in∣ferred from Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation of this Speech. <HI>Diomed</HI> says but two Lines above
<Q><L>Unhappy they, and born of luckless Sires,</L>
<L>Who tempt our Fury when <HI>Minerva</HI> fires! <BIBL>l. 157.</BIBL></L></Q>
After all, why should he torment himself with Reflections on what he had done only by Virtue of that <HI>Commission</HI> before, which he was far from
<PB N="357" REF="459"/>
exceeding except in his Attempt upon <HI>Apollo,</HI> from whom however upon the first Reproof he retired? Or, why should the Example of <HI>Lycur∣gus,</HI> who acted not by divine Impulse, terrify one who confessedly did? In this Light what will become of the <HI>allegorical</HI> Characters of <HI>Minerva, Mars,</HI> and <HI>Venus;</HI> or how comes a Hero to be troubled in Conscience because he had been re∣sisting <HI>Incontinence,</HI> and <HI>ungoverned Fury?</HI> Thus you find this Allegory, which we were told lies so open, is clogged likewise with its Difficulties; from which indeed neither is the literal Construc∣tion of the Passage clear; for it seems unreason∣able that a Man should suffer from the Resent∣ment of one God for what he committed by the Direction, and Command of another; though this is no unusual Thing in <HI>Pagan</HI> Story.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, to have done with the <HI>Ma∣chinery</HI> of this great Poet, I leave it to you to judge, whether there is not abundant Ground to conclude, that the Interpreters have <HI>frequently</HI> taken Pains to ascertain a Meaning in him which never came into his Head; that if he had a latent and symbolical Meaning, at least they have not hit upon it, and that there is more Ingenuity than Solidity, as we have hinted, in many of their Interpretations. In a Word, I cannot see how any thing like a regular and consistent System either of Theology, or of Morality, can be ex∣tracted
<PB N="358" REF="460"/>
from <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Machinery</HI>—if he drops a Sentiment or an Expression occasionally, as he often does, with a View one would think to con∣vince his Reader of the Rectitude of his <HI>private</HI> Notions with Regard to the Deity, his <HI>Jupiter</HI> appears to have been a <HI>fabulous</HI> and <HI>traditional</HI> Character, and is drawn with Imperfections, and Infirmities incompatible with the natural Ideas of a supreme Being. As to the inferior Deities it seems impossible to form a precise Idea of their hidden Significancy, or <HI>allegorical</HI> Importance, from the Actions which we have seen ascribed to them: So that <HI>Homer</HI> had really much <HI>less Design</HI> in the Plan of his Poem than is supposed (on which Supposition he may however be plainly made more uniform, and of a Piece) or he had much <HI>more</HI> than has ever yet been, or we may suppose <HI>now</HI> ever will be, comprehended. In my next I will consider in another Point of View the noble Production of this excellent Poet.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to remind you in this Place that I neither have said, nor shall say any thing of <HI>Homer</HI> with an Intent to <HI>lessen</HI> your Opi∣nion of him, but to <HI>set it right;</HI> for it is one Thing to undervalue a Poet, and another to un∣deceive the Reader. If <HI>Homer</HI> be justly esteemed one of the <HI>greatest</HI> Geniuses the World has pro∣duced,
<PB N="359" REF="461"/>
(perhaps the greatest) it is to be remem∣bered that he is one of the <HI>first</HI> too; and it is absurd to look for that Perfection in the <HI>Original,</HI> which we have a Right to expect in the <HI>Copy.</HI> It is the Characteristic of <HI>Invention</HI> to be <HI>great,</HI> of <HI>Imitation,</HI> to be <HI>exact;</HI> and if <HI>Virgil</HI> could not have improved the Model of the <HI>Epopee</HI> left him by <HI>Homer,</HI> he should not have taken a Pen in his Hand. The <HI>Intervention</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> with all his De∣fects will always be the Object of our <HI>Admiration;</HI> the <HI>Judgment</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> with all his Proprieties will only deserve our <HI>Praise.</HI>—I own it has often amazed me to find the Commentators so confident to deny, or solicitous to extenuate <HI>Homer</HI>'s De∣fects, which really do no Discredit to him, and which ought to be imputed to that <HI>Simplicity</HI> with which every <HI>original</HI> Production of the human Mind is naturally imagined. It is, I apprehend, for want of considering this great Author in this Light, that the Expositors often run into the op∣posite Extreme, and are industrious to discover Beauties and Excellencies which were merely acci∣dental, and ought rather to be put to the Account of the Editor's Affection or Sagacity, than to that of the Art, or Design of the Author.—Un∣der this Notion I have already submitted to your Consideration my Sentiments on <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Machines;</HI> and agreeably to my Proposal I shall next give you my Thoughts upon the Plan or Oeconomy of
<PB N="360" REF="462"/>
the <HI>Iliad</HI> in general, and then proceed to a Re∣view of the Poet's Conduct in some particular In∣stances. Now, I think, it may be noted as a Defect in the general Oeconomy of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which is to be ascribed to the Cause just men∣tioned, that the Poet has not taken sufficient Care to interest his Readers on the Side of his Countrymen, notwithstanding the apparent Justice of their Cause. This is clear to me from several Considerations, as first from the Countenance and Protection given to the <HI>Trojans</HI> in general by <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI> in Preference to the <HI>Greeks.</HI>—I am very sensible the Commentators represent this Protec∣tion as the Consequence <HI>only</HI> of that God's Promise to <HI>Thetis,</HI> to humble the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and do Honour to <HI>Achilles.</HI>—But is it not as plain too, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> throughout the Poem is <HI>personally</HI> well∣affected to <HI>Troy</HI> in general, and that for very good Reasons? It appears from <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Answer to <HI>Thetis,</HI> that he had declared himself in the In∣terest of the <HI>Trojans</HI> long before she made this Application to him,</P>
<LG>
<L>What hast thou ask'd? Ah! why should <HI>Jove</HI> engage</L>
<L>In foreign Contests, and domestic Rage,</L>
<L>The Gods Complaints, and <HI>Juno</HI>'s fierce Alarms,</L>
<L>While I, too partial, aid the <HI>Trojan</HI> Arms?</L>
<L><BIBL>B. 1. l. 672.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>And he afterwards, in the Council wherein he in∣timates himself disposed to end the War, with the
<PB N="361" REF="463"/>
Approbation of the other Deities, by suffering the Treaty made upon the Duel of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> to take Effect, expresses a more than ordi∣nary Concern for <HI>Troy,</HI> as a Place that deserved well at his Hands.</P>
<LG>
<L>For know of all the num'rous Towns that rise</L>
<L>Beneath the rolling Sun, and starry Skies,</L>
<L>Which Gods have rais'd, or earth-born Men enjoy,</L>
<L>None stands so dear to <HI>Jove,</HI> as sacred <HI>Troy.</HI></L>
<L>No Mortals merit more distinguish'd Grace,</L>
<L>Than God-like <HI>Priam,</HI> or than <HI>Priam</HI>'s Race.</L>

<L><BIBL>B. 4. L. 65. &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has a Note from <HI>Dacier,</HI> which corro∣borates what I have remarked upon this Head. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 9. B. iv.</NOTE> <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Reproaching these two Goddesses <HI>(Juno</HI> and <HI>Pallas)</HI> with neglecting to assist <HI>Menelaus</HI> (in the Duel) proceeds from the Af∣fection he bore to <HI>Troy;</HI> since if <HI>Menelaus</HI> had gained by their Help a complete Victory, <HI>(which it has been observed, was a sufficient one)</HI> the Siege had been raised, and the City delivered. On the contrary, <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> might suffer <HI>Paris</HI> to escape, as the Method to con∣tinue the War, to the total Destruction of <HI>Troy;</HI> and accordingly a few Lines after we find them
<PB N="362" REF="464"/>
complotting together, and contriving a new Scene of Miseries to the <HI>Trojans.</HI></Q> The latter Part of this Note confirms what has been before observed, that these Goddesses seem to have been actuated by a Spirit of the most inveterate Malice, and Animosity against a whole Race <Q><HI>Unius ob∣noxam.</HI></Q> The Restitution of <HI>Helen,</HI> &amp;c. was not the grand Object of their Counsels.</P>
<P>Indeed, if you take them in the Gross, I be∣lieve you will find the Deities on the Side of <HI>Troy</HI> (tho' <HI>Mars</HI> is in the Number) to be more gentle, and mercifully inclined, than those that are the Assistants of the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I can't help being of Opinion that upon the whole, the Poet gives us a much more favour∣able Idea of the <HI>Trojans,</HI> than he does of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> if we regard the <HI>Manners,</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of the Heroes concerned on both Sides. Let us take a short Vew of the principal Personages that fight in the Cause of <HI>Troy. Hector,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 53. B. iii.</NOTE> if he is not the chief Hero in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> is at least the most amiable, and is for several Reasons a favourite Character with every Rea∣der.</Q>—<Q>He stands in contrast to <HI>Achilles,</HI> an accomplished Character of Valour, unruffled by Rage, and Anger, and uniting his People by his Prudence, and Example.</Q> <Q>It is the
<PB N="363" REF="465"/>
Love of his Country, which appears his principal Passion, and the Motive of all his Actions. He has no other Blemish than that he fights in an unjust Cause, which <HI>Homer</HI> has yet been careful to tell us he would not do, if his Opinion were followed.</Q> <Q>We may add, that <HI>Homer,</HI> having so many <HI>Greeks</HI> to celebrate, makes them shine it their Turns, &amp;c. whereas <HI>Hector</HI> appears in every Battle the Life and Soul of his Party, and the constant Bul∣wark against every Enemy; he stands against <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Magnanimity, <HI>Diomed</HI>'s Bravery, <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Strength, and <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Fury.</Q></P>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 212. B. v.</NOTE> The Piety, and Valour of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> tho' not drawn at so full a Length, are marked no less in <HI>(Homer)</HI> the Original, than in <HI>(Virgil)</HI> the Copy. It is the Manner of <HI>Homer</HI> to express very strongly the Character of each of his Per∣sons in the first Speech he is made to utter in the Poem. In this of <HI>Aeneas</HI> there is a great Air of <HI>Piety</HI> in those Strokes, <HI>Is he some God who punishes</HI> TROY <HI>for having neglected his Sacrifices?</HI> and then in that Sentence, <HI>the Anger of Heaven is Terrible.</HI></Q>
<P>In a Word, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us in another Place. <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 345. B. xx.</NOTE> Tho' <HI>Aeneas</HI> is represented a Man of great Courage, yet his Piety is his most shining
<PB N="364" REF="466"/>
Character: This is the Reason why he is al∣ways the Care of the Gods, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The Character of <HI>Sarpedon,</HI> says the same Com∣mentator, is the <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 512. B. xvi.</NOTE> most faultless, and amiable in the whole <HI>Iliad.</HI> This Hero is by Birth su∣periour to all the Chiefs of either Side, being the only Son of <HI>Jupiter</HI> engaged in this War. His Qualities are no way unworthy his Descent, since he every where appears equal in Valour, Prudence, and Eloquence to the most admired Heroes: Nor are these Excellencies blemished with any of those Defects with which the most distinguished Characters of the Poem are stain∣ed; so that the nicest Criticks cannot find any Thing to offend their Delicacy, but must be obliged to own the Manners of this Hero per∣fect. His Valour is neither rash, nor boisterous, his Prudence neither timorous, nor tricking; and his Eloquence, neither talkative, nor boast∣ing. He never reproaches the Living, nor insults the Dead; but appears uniform thro' his Con∣duct in the War, acting with the same generous Sentiments that engaged him in it; having no interest in the Quarrel, but to succour his Allies in distress. This noble Life is ended with a Death as glorious; for in his last Moments he has no other Concern, but for the Honour of his
<PB N="365" REF="467"/>
Friends, and the Event of the Day.</Q>—<Q>His is the only Death in the <HI>Iliad</HI> attended with Prodigies; even his Funeral is performed by divine Assistance, he being the only Hero whose Body is carried back to be interred in his native Country, &amp;c.</Q>—<Q>These peculiar and distinguishing Honours seem appropriated by our Author to him alone, as the Reward of a Merit superiour to all his other less perfect Heroes.</Q> These are the most illustrious Cha∣racters on the Side of <HI>Troy;</HI> tho' the inferiour ones, if not so striking, are at least generally ami∣able and inoffensive; as those of <HI>Deiphobus, He∣lenus, Polydamas,</HI> and <HI>Glaucus.</HI> Even that of <HI>Paris</HI> is upon the whole far from being odious, or disgusting. I believe, among other Things the Value every Reader has for these Characters, par∣ticularly his Love and Esteem of <HI>Hector,</HI> inclines his Wishes to the Side of <HI>Troy.</HI> Indeed Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has (perhaps undesignedly) given us in the above Accounts of <HI>Sarpedon,</HI> a kind of Contrast to the Manners, and Characters of many of the Leaders in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army. For the Valour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and of <HI>Diomed</HI> is undoubtedly <HI>rash,</HI> and <HI>boisterous;</HI> the Prudence of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is sometimes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 121. B. viii.</NOTE><HI>timorous;</HI> and the Eloquence of <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> and <HI>Nector</HI> is <HI>talkative</HI> and <HI>boasting.</HI> But what Pre∣judices
<PB N="366" REF="468"/>
us more than any Thing else against the <HI>Greeks,</HI> is that Cruelty, and Inhumanity which is so remarkable in their Chiefs of the first Note, and Figure. Granting <HI>Achilles</HI> in all he does to act in Character, and suitably to his <Q>ferocious and vindictive Spirit</Q> the very Nature of the Character itself is offensive, and the Propriety and Coherence with which it is preserved, distasteful. <Q>His Inhumanity in dragging the dead Body of <HI>Hector</HI> has been severely (and I think indeed not without some Justice, says Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> cen∣sured by several, both Antients, and Moderns.</Q> Indeed the Question is whether the whole Picture of <HI>Achilles</HI> as drawn by <HI>Homer,</HI> has not stronger, and more violent Features in it than Necessity re∣quired? The Subject of the Poem is the Anger of this Hero, and the ill Consequences of it to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but this brutal Treatment of the Body of a generous Enemy, is neither the natural Effect of <HI>that</HI> Anger, nor a Soldier-like Revenge for the Death of his Friend <HI>Patroclus.</HI>—'Tis true, the Commentators have observed that, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 137. B. xvii.</NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI> takes Care before Hand, to lessen in his Rea∣der's Mind the Horrour he may conceive from the Cruelty which <HI>Achilles</HI> will exercise upon the Body of <HI>Hector,</HI> by shewing this Cruelty as the Punishment only of that which <HI>Hector</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="469"/>
exercises upon the Body of <HI>Patroclus;</HI> he drags him; he <HI>designs</HI> to cut off his Head, and to leave his Body upon the Ramparts, exposed to Dogs, and Birds of Prey.</Q> The Observation is founded on Fact; but however as this Piece of <HI>intended</HI> Cruelty is inconsistent with <HI>Hector</HI>'s gene∣ral Character, he should not have been represen∣ted as capable of it, and as it was only <HI>intended,</HI> it makes not so horrible an Impression upon us as the <HI>actual</HI> Inhumanity of the Poet's favour∣rite Hero. I have often thought by the way, that the Barbarity of <HI>Achilles</HI> towards the Re∣mains of the unfortunate, and universally beloved <HI>Hector,</HI> occasioned the Misrepresentation of the very Fact of his Death by the well-known Story, (which <HI>Shakespeare</HI> adheres to in his <HI>Troilus and Cressida)</HI> of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s ungenerously attacking him unarmed, and cutting him to Pieces.—So de∣sirous was the exasperated Author to depreciate the Character of this Hero, and exalt that of his Adversary. But to return; be the Charac∣ter of <HI>Achilles</HI> as "poetically perfect" as possible, and the Morality to be drawn from it as obvious as you please, he seems to have the least Merit of any of the principal Personages in the Poem, and we can scarce help being sorry to see so many detestable Qualities on the right Side of the Ques∣tion: In a Word "the Virtues of Humanity" which he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 798. B. xxiv.</NOTE>discovers in the 24th Book, when
<PB N="368" REF="470"/>
he restores the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> to <HI>Priam,</HI> and "the amiable Qualities" which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us <Q>soften the terrible Ideas we have conceived of him</Q> are exercised too late to wipe off the Stain of his past unheroical, and unmanly Beha∣viour; especially when we consider that this Act of Humanity was the Effect of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s express Command, delivered by his Mother <HI>Thetis.</HI></P>
<P>In short, though we cannot but take Notice of a great deal of Insolence and Cruelty on both Sides, and are shocked, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> confesses he is, at the many Instances of Inhumanity that oc∣cur throughout the Poem, <Q>which however are not to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 57. B. vi.</NOTE>imputed to the Poet, who followed Nature as it was in his Days, but to be ascribed to the uncivilized Manners of those Times, when Mankind was not united by the Bonds of a rational Society,</Q> yet I believe we shall find much more Blame due to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> than to the <HI>Trojans</HI> upon this Score. Not to insist upon those other glaring Proofs of a bloody, and unmerciful Disposition, which <HI>Achilles</HI> gives in the killing <HI>Lycaon</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See B. xxi. L. 35. &amp;c.</NOTE>, taking twelve Captives whom he sa∣crifices afterwards to the <HI>Manes</HI> of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> we see <HI>Agamemnon</HI> too upon certain Occasions betray∣ing a fierce, and cruel Temper; as particularly when he prevails upon his Brother to take away a <HI>Trojan</HI>'s Life which he was inclined in Compassion
<PB N="369" REF="471"/>
to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See B. vi. L. 55. &amp;c.</NOTE>spare. I do not know where you will meet with more savage Sentiments than those of this General in the following Speech to <HI>Menelaus.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>—Oh impotent of Mind!</L>
<L>Shall these, shall these <HI>Atrides'</HI> Mercy find?</L>
<L>Well hast thou known proud <HI>Troy</HI>'s perfidious Land,</L>
<L>And well her Natives merit at thy Hand!</L>
<L>Not one of all the Race, nor Sex, nor Age,</L>
<L>Shall save a <HI>Trojan</HI> from our boundless Rage:</L>
<L><HI>Ilion</HI> shall perish whole, and bury all;</L>
<L>Her Babes, her Infants at the Breast shall fall.</L>
<L><BIBL>L. 67. &amp;c. B. vi.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>And if you will turn to the Original you will per∣haps think it much softened in this Translation; notwithstanding Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Observation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 74. B. vi.</NOTE>from Madam <HI>Dacier.</HI> It should be remembered too, that the venerable <HI>Nestor</HI> himself is a Spectator and Applauder of this Act of Cruelty.</P>
<P>But there is one Consideration behind that in∣terests the Reader in the Behalf of <HI>Troy,</HI> much more than all the rest; I mean that of the <HI>private</HI> Characters of <HI>Priam</HI> and his Royal Family. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is of Opinion that <Q>the Poet's chief <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 107. B. vi.</NOTE>Inten∣tion in making <HI>Hector</HI> retire from the Battle to carry a Message to <HI>Troy</HI> &amp;c. was to introduce the fine Episode of his parting with <HI>Andromache</HI></Q>
<PB N="370" REF="472"/>
in which the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 462.</NOTE>amiable Picture of conjugal Love <Q><HI>Homer</HI> has drawn gives us Cause to think his Genius was no less capable of touching the Heart with Tenderness, than of firing it with Glory.</Q> <Q>This Episode, (says that excellent Person,) tends very much to raise the Character of <HI>Hector,</HI> and endear him to every Reader,</Q> and indeed we cannot admire this Hero more in the Field, than we love him at Home. His Con∣duct, his Courage, and his Valour are common to him with many others, but his affectionate Tenderness to his Parents, his Wife, his Child, and his Friends is characteristical, and peculiar to himself.</P>
<P>In a Word, you cannot, I believe, but be a Well-wisher to the House of <HI>Priam,</HI> when you consider the general Character of this good old Man himself, whose only Fault was his Indulgence to his Children, and especially his Piety which "renders him a Favourite of <HI>Jupiter,"</HI> and pro∣cures him the Restitution of his Son's Body; or when you look into the Manners of his whole Fa∣mily, not even <HI>Helen</HI> excepted, but as she is the Mistress of <HI>Paris,</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> himself, but as he is the Admirer of that fatal Beauty. Upon the whole, I leave you to judge whether the <HI>Grecians</HI> do not deserve the Appellation of <HI>barbarous,</HI> ac∣cording to the worst Acceptation of the Term, much more than the People, or the Allies of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="473"/>
I cannot think then with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> that <Q><HI>Ho∣mer</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 49. B. v.</NOTE>always appears very zealous for the Ho∣nour of <HI>Greece,</HI></Q> or even that he seems to be so in the Instance produced to support the Asser∣tion; I mean, that of the <Q><HI>Trojans</HI> in the Begin∣ning of the third Book rushing on to the Battle in a barbarous and confused Manner with loud Shouts and Cries, while the <HI>Greeks</HI> advance in the most profound Silence and exact Order.</Q> This Circumstance, it seems, is a Proof of the Poet's <Q>Endeavour every where to represent the <HI>Greeks</HI> as superiour to the <HI>Trojans</HI> in Valour, and the Art of War,</Q> to which if you add the Cir∣cumstance of <Q>the <HI>Grecians</HI> being animated by <HI>Pallas</HI> and the <HI>Trojans</HI> instigated by <HI>Mars</HI></Q> i. e. the former, "by a well-conducted Valour," and the latter by "rash Strength and brutal Force," the Matter will bear no Dispute. What Weight there is in this latter Circumstance you will easily see upon recollecting what has been already re∣marked upon the <HI>Machines</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> and for the former, I think you will agree with me, that little is to be fairly inferred from it to the Advantage of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The <HI>Trojan</HI> <Q>Manner of encountering with Shouts and Outcries</Q> is no Argument against their military Discipline, or Proof that they were not drawn up in as "exact Order" as the
<PB N="372" REF="474"/>
<HI>Grecians</HI> themselves. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 3. B. iii.</NOTE> Perhaps these Clamours were only to encourage their Men, instead of martial Instruments,</Q> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has not scru∣pled to intimate; at least it is a Peculiarity (as what Nation is without one?) that does no Discredit to their Discipline, or Skill in the "Art of War." Indeed the supposed <HI>constant</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 49. B. iii.</NOTE>Superiority of the <HI>Grecians</HI> &amp;c. is by no means so apparent to me as it has been to the Commentators in general; and probably you may be of the same Mind if you will refer to Book iv. L. 508, &amp;c. to Book viii. L. 73, &amp;c. to Book xi. L. 93, &amp;c. to Book vii. L. 11, &amp;c. 23, &amp;c. &amp;c. and to other Places, wherein there seems to be no Sort of Inferiority on the Part of <HI>Troy</HI> in respect of Conduct, Bravery, or Resolution. More might be said upon this Article, but I have exceeded the ordinary Bounds of my Letters, and indeed should not have said so much, but that I thought it necessary to enter into such Particularities as these in order to give you the clearer Idea of an Author whose Work, I presume, you will think it a rational Amusement thoroughly to examine and discuss.</P>

<P>Old <HI>Nestor</HI> talks in the same Strain when he at∣tempts to pacify these Chiefs; (see Line 367, &amp;c.) as does <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the next Book. (see L. 243, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But besides the visible Propriety there had been in making <HI>Achilles</HI> Commander in Chief, with which Appointment the great Design of the Poem,
<PB N="374" REF="476"/>
and the due Execution of it were without Doubt consistent, it is plain that for Want of it you will meet with much Incongruity, not to say Absur∣dity, in many Places. One obvious Example shall suffice to maintain the Allegation; which is that of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s convening the Council in the first Book; an Act of Royalty that became <HI>him</HI> no more than it would <HI>Diomed, Ulysses,</HI> or any <HI>secondary</HI> Commander in the Army. Indeed this very Circumstance you find mentioned by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Note from <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Eustathius,</HI> as doing great Honour to the Judgment of <HI>Homer;</HI> for which Reason it will be proper to transcribe it.—<Q><HI>Plutarch</HI> observes, how justly <HI>Homer</HI> applies the Characters of his Persons to the Incidents; not making <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> but <HI>Achilles</HI> call this Council, who of all the Kings was most capable of making Observations upon the Plague, and of foreseeing its Duration, as having been bred by <HI>Chiron</HI> to the Study of Physick. One may mention also a Remark of <HI>Eustathius</HI> in Pur∣suance to this, that <HI>Juno</HI>'s advising him in this Case might allude to his Knowledge of an evil Temperament in the Air, of which she was Goddess.</Q> Now admitting the suppos'd Skill of this <HI>Hero,</HI> &amp;c. to have been a good Reason for his <HI>private</HI> Advice in regard to the Convention <HI>of</HI> this Council, and for his delivering his Opinion <HI>in</HI> it with more than ordinary Freedom and Con∣fidence,
<PB N="375" REF="477"/>
yet how it could give him a Right to call it, or to open it in Consequence of so doing with a formal Speech, I confess, I can't at all comprehend.—You will give me Leave just to illustrate what I have been observing upon this Head, by directing you to a Passage in the 24th Book, in which <HI>Achilles</HI> at the Height of his Glory, and Popularity among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and at the very Instant that <Q>he promises <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 819.</NOTE><HI>Priam</HI> a Cessation of Arms purely by his own Authority</Q> does nevertheless in Effect acknowledge his Sub∣ordination to the Imperial Character, and by his Apprehensions of the Consequences of the present Proceeding: as if the Poet, even while he is ag∣grandizing his Hero, was conscious of ascribing an Importance to him unsuitable to the Inferiority of his Station.</P>

<L>Then he: Now, Father, sleep, but sleep not here,</L>

<P>You observe there is an Inconsistency here which would have been saved had <HI>Achilles</HI> been the <HI>principal</HI> Person in respect of Precedence, as well as Valour, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it is Time to come to the other Objection, which, as I am not singular in it, I will give you in the Words of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note prefixed to the 23d Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and endeavour to confirm it by a Remark or two upon what that Expositor has offered by way of Vindication of his Author. <Q>This, and the following Book, which contain the Description of the Funeral of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and other Matters relating to <HI>Hector,</HI> are undoubt∣edly super-added to the grand Catastrophe of the Poem; for the Story is compleatly finished with the Death of that Hero in the 22d Book. Many judicious Criticks have been of Opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> is blameable for protracting it. <HI>Virgil</HI> closes the whole Scene of Action with the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI> and leaves the rest to be ima∣gined by the Mind of the Reader: He does not draw the Picture at full Length, but delineates it so far, that we cannot fail of imagining the whole Draught. There is however one Thing to be said in Favour of <HI>Homer,</HI> which may perhaps justify him in his Method that what he
<PB N="377" REF="479"/>
undertook to paint was the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles;</HI> and as that Anger does not die with <HI>Hector,</HI> but persecutes his very Remains, so the Poet still keeps up to his Subject; nay, it seems to require that he should carry down the Relation of that Resentment, which is the Foundation of his Poem, till it is fully satisfied: And as this survives <HI>Hector,</HI> and gives the Poet an Oppor∣tunity of still shewing many sad Effects of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Anger, the two following Books may be thought not to be Excrescencies, but essen∣tial to the Poem.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Virgil</HI> had been inexcusable had he trod in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Footsteps; for it is evident that the Fall of <HI>Turnus,</HI> by giving <HI>Aeneas</HI> a full Power over <HI>Italy,</HI> answers the whole Design and Intention of the Poem; had he gone farther he had over∣shot his Mark; and though <HI>Homer</HI> proceeds after <HI>Hector</HI>'s Death, yet the Subject is still the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles.</HI></Q> Now, I apprehend, the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which is the <Q>Foundation of the Poem,</Q> is entirely distinct from that <HI>Anger,</HI> or rather <HI>Revenge</HI> with which he <Q>persecutes the very Remains of <HI>Hector,</HI></Q> and that the whole declared "Design and Intention" of the Poet was "to paint the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles"</HI> as the Source of all the Misfortunes the <HI>Grecians</HI> underwent; which were ended by the Reconciliation of that Chief and <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> We <HI>then</HI> see as plainly the
<PB N="378" REF="480"/>
good Effects of Union to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> as we <HI>did</HI> the fatal Consequences of Discord through the most considerable Part of the Poem; and there∣fore the Death of <HI>Hector,</HI> and the Triumph of the <HI>Grecians</HI> thereupon was the proper, and natural Catastrophe of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> The <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> considered as the Passion he was <HI>addicted</HI> to, might have been protracted through many Books more.—In short, the Super-addition of these Books, espe∣cially the latter, instead of being justifiable by the Reasons above alledged, does even come within the Reach of a former Objection: For the Care taken of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Body by two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See B. xxiii.

<P><HI>HOMER</HI> is with much Justice to be admired in the main for the agreeable Variety of his Characters, and for the remarkable Spirit, and Uniformity with which each of them is sustained. If he is sometimes faulty upon this Article it is to be ascribed to mere human Infirmity perhaps, or in some Cases to that Simplicity which, as has been said, distinguishes the <HI>Inventors</HI> of Arts and Sci∣ences from the <HI>Improvers</HI> of them. To one of these it is probably owing that we see such a scan∣dalous Character as that of <HI>Thersites</HI> in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or so contemptible a one as that of <HI>Nireus:</HI> The latter, the most <HI>beautiful,</HI> the former, the most <HI>deformed Person</HI> of the Poem. 'Tis observable, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> informs us, <Q>that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 255. B. ii.</NOTE><HI>Thersites</HI> is never heard of after his first Appearance: Such a scan∣dalous Character is to be taken no more Notice of, than just to shew that 'tis despised.</Q> But whether ludicrous or scandalous Characters <Q>ought to have Place in the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem may be justly
<PB N="380" REF="482"/>
questioned,</Q> or whether it be a Beauty or Pro∣priety to introduce a Person but <HI>once,</HI> who seems to be utterly unworthy to appear at <HI>all.</HI> As for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 815. B. ii.</NOTE><HI>Nireus,</HI> the Insignificancy of his Cha∣racter, should, I think, have excluded him from the <HI>Iliad,</HI> who likewise makes his Appearance <HI>once</HI> too often. The Truth is, neither of these Per∣sonages are of any Service towards the Illustration of a <HI>principal</HI> Character. The Caution with which the Courage of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is tempered, sets off the Intrepidity of <HI>Diomed,</HI> and the Activity of <HI>Hector</HI> is finely opposed to the <HI>Immobility</HI> of <HI>Ajax;</HI> but the above-mentioned Gentlemen are at best unnecessary Contrasts to each other, and Foils to every Body else.—But that you may not imagine, I am industriously looking after Objections, and <HI>picking</HI> out Characters for the sake of finding Fault, (an Office I abhor) I must desire you to look a little farther into a Character or two of much higher Rank, which you will, I believe, find to be liable to the Objection of not being preserved with that Nicety of Consistence, and Uniformity, which is in general so Observable in this noble Writer. If you will judge of the Cha∣racter of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> by the Idea which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> justly gives us of him, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 278. B. iii.</NOTE>who has taken some Pains to place it in a true Point of View, you will be,
<PB N="381" REF="483"/>
I make no doubt, of Opinion, that <Q>upon the whole, his Character is by no Means con∣temptible, tho' not of the most shining Na∣ture: He is called indeed in the 17th <HI>Iliad.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a <HI>soft Warriour,</HI> or one whose Strength is of the second Rate; and so his Brother thought him when he preferred Nine before him to Fight with <HI>Hector,</HI> in the 7th Book.</Q> Thus far you may safely Subscribe to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notion of this Commander; but I am afraid what follows for the Display of the bright Side of this Character, will clash rather too much with these Concessions made to his Dis∣advantage. For how comes this <HI>soft Warriour</HI> (whom, you know, I have mentioned before in another Light,) to discover a <Q>Spirit of Revenge which distinguishes him from <HI>all</HI> the other <HI>Greeks</HI> in the second Book,</Q> <Q>No <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 711. B. ii.</NOTE>Leader in all the List is represented so eager and passio∣nate; he is louder than them all in his Exhor∣tations; more active in running among the Troops, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>If <HI>Homer</HI> meant to shew us hereby that <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 711. B. ii.</NOTE> his Concern in the War was personal, while the others acted only for Interest or Glory in gene∣ral,</Q> it is odd sure that he does not maintain this Priority of Zeal and Ardour, as a consequence
<PB N="382" REF="484"/>
of that Concern throughout the Poem. Again is it not hard to Account for <HI>his</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 109. B. vii. and at L. 131.</NOTE><HI>Forwardness,</HI> to accept <HI>Hector</HI>'s Challenge, who immediately afterwards was not thought worthy even to take his <HI>Chance</HI> of fighting with him? It may be said, that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> dissuades his brother from the Combat, from a Principle of Brotherly Love, not from any Distrust of his Courage, of which he appears to have so extraordinary an Opinion in the 4th Book, when <HI>Menelaus</HI> is wounded by <HI>Pandarus,</HI> that he expresses his Apprehensions, <Q>that the Death of that Hero, will force the <HI>Greeks</HI> to return with shame to their Country.</Q>
<Q><L>Depriv'd of thee, the heartless <HI>Greeks</HI> no more</L>
<L>Shall dream of Conquests on the hostile Shore, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL>B 4. L. 208. &amp;c.</BIBL></Q>
But if his Life was of such Consequence to <HI>Greece,</HI> he should never have been stiled a <HI>soft Warriour,</HI> or a Chief of the <HI>second</HI> Rate.</P>
<P>I will only point out to what I think rather an Oversight than not in <HI>Homer,</HI> with regard to ano∣ther Character, and then quit the present Article of Inquiry; I mean the Character of <HI>Ajax,</HI> whom, not absolutely, but comparatively speaking, I can't look upon as a proper Person to be dispatched upon the Embassy to <HI>Achilles</HI> in the 9th Book. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> however informs us <Q>that the Choice of
<PB N="383" REF="485"/>
three <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 222. B. ix.</NOTE>Persons <HI>(Phoenix, Ajax,</HI> and <HI>Ulysses)</HI> is made with a great deal of Judgment. <HI>Achilles</HI> could not but reverence the venerable <HI>Phoenix,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ajax,</HI> and <HI>Ulysses,</HI> had been disgraced in the first Book (L. 187) as well as he, and were therefore proper Persons to persuade him to forgive, as they had forgiven; besides it was the greatest Honour that could be done to <HI>Achilles,</HI> to send the <HI>most</HI> worthy Personages in the Army to him. <HI>Ulysses</HI> was inferiour to none in Eloquence, <HI>but</HI> to <HI>Nestor. Ajax</HI> was second to none in Valour but to <HI>Achilles. Ajax</HI> might have an influence over him as a Relation, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Yet as ingenious as all this may be, 'tis certain, that of all the Heroes, <HI>Ajax</HI> was the worst <HI>Ora∣tor,</HI> and so <HI>far</HI> at least he was was unqualified for the Charge in Question.—He is by no means a favourite Character with the Poet himself; if he had he would have <Q>given him a Prize pro∣bably in some of the Games in the 23d Book;</Q> one Reason why he did not, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> supposes might be, because he had a Mind to shew that <Q>Strength without Conduct, is usually unsuc∣cessful,</Q> which gives us no favourable Idea of this Hero, and much less authorizes us to pro∣nounce him one of the <Q>most worthy Person∣ages in the Army;</Q> that he was second to none
<PB N="384" REF="486"/>
in <HI>Strength</HI> but to <HI>Achilles,</HI> may be granted; but in <HI>Valour</HI> he has no doubt many Competitors.—In Truth I can't help looking upon this as a ran∣dom Delegation, notwithstanding a few plausible Circumstances, which surely never entered the Author's Head, viz. the Disgrace of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the first Book, &amp;c. (a Disgrace which, by the way, they neither of them resent, or allude to, in their Speeches to <HI>Achilles)</HI> or the Relation∣ship of <HI>Ajax</HI> to that Hero, which he takes not the least Advantage of in his Address to him.—Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in the Note last quoted, appears there∣fore rather to have acted the Part of a ready Friend, than an impartial Commentator.—I will only suppose, and have done, that <HI>Diomed</HI> had been employed in this Deputation instead of <HI>Ajax;</HI>—in that Case can't you conceive Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would have expressed himself to the following Pur∣pose? <Q>It is with wonderful Art and Propriety, that <HI>Homer</HI> appoints <HI>Diomed</HI> one of the Embas∣sadors upon this Occasion. It did Honour to <HI>Achilles</HI> to send upon this Business the most valiant, with the wisest of all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Commanders. Besides, <HI>Diomed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 1. B. v.</NOTE>has more of the Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> himself, than any be∣sides. He has naturally an Excess of Boldness, and too much Fury in his Temper, forward
<PB N="385" REF="487"/>
and intrepid like the other, and running after Gods or Men promiscuously as they offer themselves. Add to this, that as he is forward to act in the Field, so is he ready to speak in the Council; where his Advice always inclines to War; and is byassed rather on the Side of Bravery, than Caution. A Man of this Disposition was most likely to influence the Congenial Spirit of <HI>Achilles.</HI></Q>—An Ingenious Commentator may take a thousand Occasions of making the most of his Author, and convert Improprieties themselves into Beauties; of which I believe I shall be able to give you a few more Proofs in my remaining Criticisms upon the <HI>Iliad</HI> of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE most material Remarks I have farther to make upon the particular Conduct of <HI>Homer,</HI> &amp;c. I shall communicate to you in Order, as the Passages which seem exceptionable will occur in the Course of the Poem. The first that offers itself is the Interposition of <HI>Nestor</HI> in the first Book in the Speech wherein he endea∣vours to make up the Breach between the con∣tending Princes, <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> which, as the Design of the <HI>Iliad</HI> required it should be ineffectual, I could wish he had spared. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> observes, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 339. B. i.</NOTE> that the Character of Autho∣rity
<PB N="386" REF="488"/>
and Wisdom in <HI>Nestor,</HI> is every where ad∣mirably used by <HI>Homer,</HI> and made to exert it∣self through all the great Emergencies of the Poem. As he quiets the Princes here (which how he does we shall see presently) he pro∣poses that Expedient which reduces the Army into order, after the Sedition in the second Book. When the <HI>Greeks</HI> are in the utmost Distresses, 'tis he who advises the Building the Fortification before the Fleet, &amp;c. And 'tis by his Persuasion that <HI>Patroclus</HI> puts on the Armour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which occasions the return of that Hero, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> In these last mentioned Emergencies, indeed the Authority of this vene∣rable Hero has all the Weight you can desire; but sure in the present Instance, in which if it had prevailed, all future Emergencies had been precluded, it was exerted to no, or at best, very little Purpose. The old Man is represented as Master of the Art of Persuasion, and rises to speak with all the Advantages of the sweetest Eloquence, and the Experience of two Generations; and he seems accordingly to promise himself Success in the Proposal of an Accommodation.</P>
<LG>
<L>—Young as you are, this youthful Heat restrain</L>
<L>Nor think your <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Years and Wisdom vain—</L>
<L>—Do you, young Warriours, hear my Age advise;</L>
<L><HI>Atrides,</HI> seize not on the beauteous Slave,</L>
<L>That prize the <HI>Greeks</HI> by common Suffrage gave:</L>
<L><PB N="387" REF="489"/>
Nor thou, <HI>Achilles,</HI> treat our Prince with Pride,</L>
<L>Let Kings be just, and sov'reign Pow'r preside.</L>
<L>—Let both unite with well-consenting Mind,</L>
<L>So shall Authority with Strength be join'd.</L>
<L>Leave me, O King! to calm <HI>Achilles'</HI> Rage,</L>
<L>Rule thou thyself, as more advanc'd in Age:</L>
<L>Forbid it Gods! <HI>Achilles</HI> should be lost,</L>
<L>The Pride of <HI>Greece,</HI> and Bulwark of our Host.</L>
<L><BIBL>B. i. L. 343. &amp;c. 360. &amp;c. 369. &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>But what Effect, after all, has this Oratory? <Q><HI>Agamemnon</HI> confesses that all he spoke was right,</Q> but he will not relinquish his Preten∣sions to <HI>Briseïs.</HI> <Q><HI>Achilles</HI> promises not to fight for <HI>Briseïs,</HI></Q> but neither will he for his Country; opprobious Language is given on both Sides; <Q>the Council dissolves</Q> and the Calamities of <HI>Greece</HI> ensue. For which Reasons I think <Q>the Elo∣quence of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Nestor</HI> is thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable</Q> for the great End he designed it.—If he had not spoken at all, or upon offering to do it, had been inter∣rupted, and prevented by the Fury of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who seems to have less Veneration for him, than <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> that Hero had acted in Character, and the Eloquence of the reverened Orator had never been exercised in vain.</P>
<P>The next Objection I have to make, is against the imprudent, and unnecessary Measure taken by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> to sound the Disposition of the <HI>Gre∣cians</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="490"/>
in the second Book, by proposing the Re∣turn of the Forces to <HI>Greece;</HI> a Proposal which had taken Effect, but for the Management of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and <HI>Nestor.</HI> It is likely indeed, (to give you the Words of <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 93. B. ii.</NOTE>who, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Opinion, has given us an admirable Explication of this whole Conduct) <Q><HI>Agamemnon</HI> (after his Quarrel with <HI>Achilles)</HI> had nothing so much at Heart as to draw the <HI>Greeks</HI> to a Battle, yet knew not how to proceed without <HI>Achilles,</HI> who had just retired from the Army: He was apprehensive that the <HI>Greeks</HI> who were displeased at the Departure of <HI>Achilles,</HI> might refuse Obedience to his Orders, should he ab∣solutely command it. In this Circumstance he proposes an Expedient to the Princes in Coun∣cil, which was that he should sound the Dis∣positions of the People, by exhorting them to set sail for <HI>Greece,</HI> but, that then, the other Princes should be ready to dissuade, and detain them.—He had some Cause to fear the <HI>Greeks</HI> had a Pique against him, which they had concealed, and whatever it was, he judged it absolutely necessary to know it, before he pro∣ceeded to a Battle. He therefore furnishes them with an Occasion to manifest it, and at the same Time provides against any ill Effects it
<PB N="389" REF="491"/>
might have by his secret Orders to the Princes. It succeeds accordingly, and when the Troops are running to embark, they are stopped by <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Nestor.</HI></Q>—Now not to insist upon an inaccuracy in this Note; i. e. that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> <Q>judged it Necessary to know <HI>what</HI> the Pique the <HI>Grecians</HI> had against him was,</Q> which if they had <HI>any, could</HI> be no other than what arose from "their Displeasure at the departure of <HI>Achilles,"</HI> as is expressed in the former Part of the Note; I say, not to dwell upon this, the Question is, whe∣ther this Stratagem was not absolutely superseded by the Vision sent by <HI>Jupiter</HI> to <HI>Agamemnon?</HI> The Design of this Vision was to deceive him into the Hope, or rather Assurance of taking <HI>Troy</HI> without the Assistance of <HI>Achilles.</HI> And it had its Effect. The General, persuaded, as it were by immedi∣ate Revelation, of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Favour towards him, and Concern for his Glory, and exalted with the Thought of the promised Success to his Arms, communicates his Dream to the Princes in Coun∣cil, who appear to a Man to be satisfied of the Reality of it, and of the Good-will of <HI>Jupiter</HI> to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Cause. Old <HI>Nestor</HI> gives his Advice in consequence of this Conviction.</P>
<LG>
<L>Princes of <HI>Greece,</HI> your faithful Ears incline</L>
<L>Nor doubt the Vision of the Pow'rs divine,</L>

<L><BIBL>B. ii. L. 101. &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>Let me ask you now, whether, if this Dream had been communicated to the Troops, as well as the Council, <HI>they</HI> would not as readily have given Credit to it, and have been impatient to fol∣low to battle a Leader who was the declared Favourite of Heaven? Would not the Belief of taking <HI>Troy</HI> in the next Attack, under his Com∣mand, have entirely removed the <HI>Pique</HI> they had conceived against him on Account of the De∣parture of <HI>Achilles?</HI> if so, as ingenious as the Stratagem in Question may be in itself, and as artful as the Speech of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is, which he makes in pursuance of it, it seems to be an Expedient, to which, as Things were then cir∣cumstanced, he was not under the least Neces∣sity, nor in Prudence concerned, to have Re∣course.</P>
<P>If you will next turn to the 6th Book, I pre∣sume you will find an Inconsistency between <HI>Hec∣tor</HI>'s very <HI>particular</HI> Prophecy of the Destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and his Prayer for his Son immediately after; as also, the "strong Hopes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 604.

I don't apprehend that what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has urged from <HI>Dacier,</HI> or advanced himself, in order to salve this Inconsistency, will afford us sufficient Satisfaction. <Q>We ought to reflect, says he, that this is only a Prayer: <HI>Hector</HI> in the Excess of a tender Emotion for his Son, intreats the Gods to preserve <HI>Troy,</HI> and permit <HI>Astyanax</HI> to rule there. It is at all Times allowable to beseech Heaven to appease its Anger, and change its Decrees; and we are taught that Prayers can alter Des∣tiny.</Q>—We are taught, I conceive the very Reverse of this by the general Tenour of the Poem: This Assertion however, supposes <HI>Hector</HI> to have foreseen the Destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the Ruin of his Family; and yet we are told in the next Sentence, <Q>that it cannot be inferred from hence, that <HI>Hector</HI> had any divine Foreknow∣ledge of his Fate, &amp;c. since in many following Passages we find him possessed with strong Hopes, &amp;c. to raise the Siege, &amp;c.</Q> Is not this a sort of Confusion of Apologies, and a Defence of one Inconsistency by another? In short, the di∣rect, and express Prophecy above quoted, cannot without much Force, be resolved into the mere <Q>Apprehensions and Misgivings of a Soul dejec∣ted with Sorrow, &amp;c. by considering the great Dangers to which he saw all that was dear to him exposed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="495"/>
But to proceed—The Circumstance of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s weighing in his Scales the Fates of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI> in the 8th Book, and those of <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> in the 22d, has something very striking, and poetical in it, but at the same Time, is it∣self liable to the Objection made by <HI>Macrobius</HI> to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Imitation of it. <Q><HI>Macrobius,</HI> says <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 88. B. viii.</NOTE>Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> observes with some Colour, that the Ap∣plication of this Circumstance is not so just in <HI>Virgil,</HI> as in our Author; for <HI>Virgil</HI> had made <HI>Juno</HI> say before, that <HI>Turnus</HI> would cer∣tainly perish.</Q>
<Q><L>Nunc juvenem imparibus video concurrere fatis,</L>
<L>Parcarumque dies &amp; vis inimica propinquat.</L></Q>
<Q><L>So that there was less Reason for weighing his</L>
<L>Fate with that of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> after that Declaration.</L></Q></P>
<P>But is it not as clear that the Fates of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy,</HI> and of <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> in <HI>Homer,</HI> were respectively, to all Intents and Purposes, de∣clared before this Suspension of the Scales?—<HI>Ju∣piter,</HI> in the Beginning of the 8th Book <Q>threatens the Deities with the Pains of <HI>Tartarus,</HI> if they assist either Side,</Q> he had in the End of the the preceeding <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See L. 575. B. vii.</NOTE>Book given Tokens of his Wrath against the <HI>Grecians;</HI> and if we could doubt whe∣ther the Threatning just mentioned; was denoun∣ced in favour of the <HI>Trojans, Minerva</HI>'s Request
<PB N="394" REF="496"/>
"that she may direct the <HI>Greeks</HI> by her Counsels" must abundantly convince us that it was.</P>
<LG>
<L>From Fields forbidden we submiss refrain,</L>
<L>With Arms unaiding mourn our <HI>Argives</HI> slain;</L>
<L>Yet grant my Counsels still their Breasts may move,</L>

<L><BIBL>B. viii. L. 43. &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>In the Case of <HI>Hector, Jupiter</HI> is undeniably explicit; he declares the Fate of that Hero ap∣proaching, tho' he is inclined, with the Consent of the inferiour Deities, to rescue him from it.</P>
<LG>
<L>Consult, ye Pow'rs! ('tis worthy your Debate)</L>
<L>Whether to snatch him from impending Fate,</L>
<L>Or let him bear, by stern <HI>Pelides</HI> slain,</L>
<L>(Good as he is) the Lot impos'd on Man?</L>
</LG>
<P>So that <HI>Virgil</HI> appears at least not only to have copied this Circumstance from <HI>Homer,</HI> but to have applied it with more Justice; for what <HI>Juno</HI> said previously to the Suspension of the Scales, is not at least so glaring an Impropriety as what <HI>Ju∣piter</HI> says here himself. The best excuse perhaps for both these great Poets, we may borrow from a Note of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, in the 20th Book, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 41. B. xx.</NOTE> that it was not easy in the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion, to form the justest Ideas upon a Doctrine (viz. that of Destiny, the Divine Power, &amp;c.) so difficult to
<PB N="395" REF="497"/>
be cleared; and upon which it is no great Wonder if a Poet should not always be per∣fectly consistent with himself, when it has puzzled such a Number of Divines, and Phi∣losophers.</Q></P>
<P>Before I quit this Remark, I must just take Notice of an Oversight in Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> who tells us in his Note <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 88. B. viii.</NOTE>upon the Circumstance of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s weighing the Fates, &amp;c. that <Q>This <HI>Figure</HI> re∣presenting God as weighing the destinies of Men in his Balances, was first made use of in Holy Writ.</Q> Are these only <HI>figurative</HI> Scales in <HI>Homer</HI> then? Sure <HI>Aeschylus</HI> did not look upon them to be such, when (as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> informs us from <HI>Plutarch)</HI> <Q>he wrote a whole Tragedy upon this Foundation, which he called <HI>Psycho∣statia,</HI> or the <HI>weighing of Souls.</HI> In this he in∣troduced <HI>Thetis</HI> and <HI>Aurora</HI> standing on either Side of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Scales, and praying each for her Son, while the Heroes fought.</Q> I don't see therefore how any Parallel can reasonably be drawn between this Passage, which must be <HI>lite∣rally</HI> understood in <HI>Homer,</HI> and those <HI>figurative</HI> Expressions in <HI>Scripture,</HI> <Q>of <HI>being weighed in the Balance,</HI> and <HI>found light,</HI> &amp;c. by which the Impartiality of divine Justice is significantly illustrated to the human Understanding. How
<PB N="396" REF="498"/>
far <HI>Milton</HI> may be warranted in borrowing</Q> this fine Fiction from <HI>Homer,</HI> which it is acknow∣ledged "he has admirably improved" or in repre∣senting the Deity with a Pair of golden <HI>Compasses</HI> in his Hand upon another Occasion, it is not my present Business to inquire.—Thus much at least may be said in his Behalf, that <HI>Boldnesses</HI> give no Offence when there is no Allay of <HI>Impiety</HI> in them.

<P>IN the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note at L. 233. B. xii.</NOTE>12th Book of the <HI>Iliad</HI> we have an Account of a signal Prodigy which much awakens the Reader's Attention, but I think never satisfies it. I mean that of the Eagle with the Serpent in his Talons, &amp;c. which appears over the <HI>Trojan</HI> Army. <HI>Polydamas</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 245.</NOTE>, upon duly considering it, pronounces it to be a Warning to them from <HI>Jupiter</HI> not to attempt the <HI>Grecian</HI> Entrenchments that Day, but to re∣treat, &amp;c. <Q>He tells <HI>Hector</HI> too that what he delivers is not Conjecture, but Science, and appeals for the Truth of it to the Augurs of the Army.</Q> But notwithstanding all this, <HI>Hector</HI> holds the Interpretation of the Omen in the ut∣most Contempt, and insinuates that <Q>the Advice proceeded not from the Skill, but Cowardice</Q>
<PB N="397" REF="499"/>
of the Interpreter. He appears indeed to have been in the right not only from the Success of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Arms at the End of the Book, when <HI>Sar∣pedon</HI> <Q>makes the first Breach in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wall</Q> and himself forces open one of the "Gates," but even from the Countenance, and Assistance of <HI>Jupiter</HI> to the <HI>Trojans</HI> immediately after the Prodigy itself. For the Poet tells us at the Conclusion of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Speech to <HI>Polydamas,</HI> and upon his "rushing to the Wall" (L. 295) that</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Jove</HI> breathes a Whirlwind from the Hills of <HI>Ide,</HI></L>

<P>Either therefore this Appearance had no Signifi∣cancy in it, and then it will be difficult to account for the Solemnity with which <HI>Homer</HI> introduces it, or for his introducing it at all, or else it boded Misfortune to the <HI>Grecians;</HI> in which Case <HI>Poly∣damas,</HI> who is every where shewn in a favourable Light enough, makes if not a cowardly yet an ig∣norant Application of it.</P>

<PB N="398" REF="500"/>
the latter on Account of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s having neg∣lected to specify the <HI>Omen.</HI></Q> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> takes No∣tice in another Place of this Author's Partiality to <HI>Homer;</HI> and his Observation on this Circum∣stance is a strong Instance of it. <Q>He should have considered (as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> remarks) that <HI>Virgil</HI> had no Design, or Occasion to make an <HI>Omen</HI> of it; but took it only as a natural Image, to paint the Posture of two Warriours struggling with each other.</Q> What Design or Occasion <HI>Homer</HI> himself had for an <HI>Omen</HI> in this Place, you see 'tis not so easy to say; you have however a Proof of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet's <HI>Judgment,</HI> and may ob∣serve that a needless, or unintelligible <HI>Prodigy</HI> in <HI>Homer</HI> will make an excellent <HI>Simile</HI> in <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>The Recess <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 180. B. xx.</NOTE>of the Gods in the 20th Book is an Incident, which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> <Q>wonders all the Commentators should be silent upon; it seems strange at the first View, says he, that so many Deities, after having entered the Scene of Ac∣tion, should perform so short a Part and im∣mediately become themselves Spectators.</Q> I must indeed look upon this as an Objection to the Conduct of the Poet. Let us hear however what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has urged in his Vindication. He <Q>con∣ceives then the Reason of this Conduct in the Poet to be, that <HI>Achilles</HI> has been inactive dur∣ing the greatest Part of the Poem; and as he
<PB N="399" REF="501"/>
is the Hero of it, ought to be the chief Cha∣racter in it: The Poet therefore withdraws the Gods from the Field, that <HI>Achilles</HI> may have the whole Honour of the Day, and not act in Subordination to the Deities; besides the Poem now draws to a Conclusion, and it is necessary for <HI>Homer</HI> to enlarge upon the Exploits of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that he may leave a noble Idea of his Valour upon the Mind of the Reader.</Q></P>
<P>Now I would take the Liberty to ask, whether it be derogatory to the important Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> to act in Subordination to the Deities? Whether their Superintendency and Assistance has not been an Honour to every Hero in the Course of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> particularly to <HI>Diomed</HI> in the fifth Book? Whether <HI>Achilles</HI> himself makes so great a Figure in this Book as he does in the next when <Q><HI>Scamander</HI> attacks him with all his Waves; when <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 330. B. xxi.</NOTE>appear to assist him: <HI>Simois</HI> joins <HI>Scamander,</HI> and at length <HI>Vulcan,</HI> by the Instigation of <HI>Juno,</HI> almost dries up the River.</Q> Does the Interposition of these Deities do a Discredit to the Valour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> or <Q>leave a less noble Idea of it upon the Mind of the Reader</Q> than he would have had without it?—I dare say you will agree with me that what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> observes in the next Note is a kind of An∣swer to what he has advanced in this, and be
<PB N="400" REF="502"/>
convinced that the <Q>magnificent Introduction of <HI>Achilles</HI> into the Field in the Beginning of this Book, when the Gods descend to Battle, and all Nature is in an Uproar, is not answered by any suitable Exploits of that Hero, or by any Atchievement worthy so pompous, and terrible an <HI>Apparatus!</HI> After the Gods are withdrawn, <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> meet; but in the very Mo∣ment, you expect to see a bloody Combat, you are entertained with a tedious Conversation.</Q> Take Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s own Words.—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 214. B. 20.</NOTE> <Q>Our Expec∣tation is raised to see Gods and Heroes engaged, when suddenly it all sinks into such a Combat in which neither Party receives a Wound; and (what is more extraordinary) the Gods are made the Spectators of so small an Action. What Occasion was there for Thunder, Earthquakes, and descending Deities to introduce a Matter of so little Importance. Neither is it any Excuse to say the Poet has given us a Piece of <HI>ancient History,</HI> we expected to read a Poet not an Historian. In short after the greatest Preparation for Action imaginable, he suspends the whole Narration, and from the Heat of a Poet, cools at once into the Simplicity of an Historian.</Q></P>
<P>I can't help asking here, whether this be the first Time <HI>Homer</HI> is faulty in this Respect? To ac∣quiesce in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s ingenious Justification of the
<PB N="401" REF="503"/>
Interview between <HI>Glaucus</HI> and <HI>Diomed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 147. B. vi.</NOTE>in the 6th Book, which has occasioned so much Cen∣sure, I fear the Speech of <HI>Nestor</HI> to <HI>Patroclus</HI> in the 11th Book is equally blameable with the Conversation in Question. <HI>Machaon</HI> is wounded: <HI>Achilles</HI> (who overlooked the Action from his Ship) sends <HI>Patroclus</HI> to inquire whether it was he, &amp;c. That Hero has no sooner entered <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Tent, but he sees <HI>Machaon</HI> bleeding, and is impatient to return to his Friend with the News; upon this <HI>Nestor</HI> <Q>detains him in his Tent standing with a Speech greatly blame∣able for being too long: he <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 801. B. xi.</NOTE>crouds Incident upon Incident, and when he speaks of himself he expatiates upon his own great Actions, very na∣turally indeed to old Age, but unseasonably in the present Juncture, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The Circumstances he mentions as they have no visible Allusion to the Design of the Speech, seem to be unfortunately introduced. In short, I think they are not so va∣luable upon any other Account, as because they preserve a Piece of <HI>ancient History,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Perhaps the Piece of <HI>ancient History</HI> preserv'd here is no more valuable than that which <HI>Aeneas</HI> leaves us in the above Conversation:—but be that as it will, it is methinks surprizing to find Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> after hav∣ing so impartially given up the Passage, looking after Excuses and Pretences to palliate this Con∣duct
<PB N="402" REF="504"/>
of his Author. I will only mention one on which most Stress seems to be laid. <Q>It may not be from the Purpose to observe (says our <HI>Eng∣lish Homer)</HI> that <HI>Nestor</HI> might designedly pro∣tract the Speech that <HI>Partoclus</HI> might himself behold the Distress of the Army, &amp;c. whether this was the Intention or not, it must be al∣lowed that the Stay of <HI>Patroclus</HI> was very happy for the <HI>Greeks;</HI> for by this Means he met <HI>Eury∣pylus</HI> wounded, who confirmed him into a Cer∣tainty, that their Affairs were desperate with∣out <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Aid.</Q> Did <HI>Patroclus</HI> want to be told this then after the Embassy to <HI>Achilles</HI> in the 9th Book? or, after <HI>Achilles</HI> had told him, (what he could not indeed be ignorant of) when he dis∣patched him upon this very Message, that</P>
<LG>
<L>The Time is come, when yon' despairing Host</L>
<L>Shall learn the Value of the Man they lost;</L>

<L>And proud <HI>Atrides</HI> tremble on his Throne.</L>
<L><BIBL>B. xi. L. 745. &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>In short, any Absurdity may be refined away, if the present can, and if it may be made to appear that the Length of <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Speech, the Interview of <HI>Patroclus</HI> and <HI>Eurypylus,</HI> and the farther Delay occasioned by the former's Stay, to cure the Wounds of the latter, which might have been effected by another Hand, were proper, and well timed in this Place.</P>

</LG>
<P>But to return to the Deities. The magnificent Introduction of the Gods above referred to, so much extolled by <HI>Longinus,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 75. B. xx.</NOTE>seems to be the utmost Effort of <HI>Homer</HI>'s prodigious Genius; and after all, perhaps we must ascribe their Recess so soon to the Poet's consciousness of the Inequality of human Nature, to so exalted a Subject. 'Tis certain the Sublimity of the Passage before us con∣sists not so much in the Horrours of an actual Combat, as in the dreadful Pomp of Preparation. But you will desire to know what became of this supposed Consciousness in the next Book, when the Deities are really described <Q>engaging each other.</Q> To which I can only say, that, what∣ever induced <HI>Homer</HI> to attempt here, what he seems to have declined before; I am apt to think the Battle of the Gods the worst, upon the whole, that occurs in the Poem. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself is much of the same Opinion, you will naturally imagine, in the following Remark upon it. <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 566. B. xxi.</NOTE>I must confess I am at a loss how to justify <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> in every point of these Combats with the
<PB N="404" REF="506"/>
Gods: When <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> are to fight, <HI>Juno</HI> calls her an <HI>impudent Bitch,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; when they fight, she boxes her soundly, and sends her crying and trembling to Heav'n: As soon as she comes thither, <HI>Jupiter</HI> falls a laughing at her: Indeed the rest of the Deities seem to be in a merry Vein during all the Action; (tho' Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should have excepted <HI>Neptune,</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> from the first of which Gods we have another Piece of <HI>antient History;) Pallas</HI> beats <HI>Mars,</HI> and laughs at him; <HI>Jupiter</HI> sees them in the same merry Mood; <HI>Juno</HI> when she had cuffed <HI>Diana,</HI> is not more serious: In short un∣less there be Depths that I am not able to Fathom, <HI>Homer</HI> never better deserved, than in this Place, the Censure past upon him by the Antients, that as he raised the Characters of his Men up to Gods, so he sunk those of Gods down to Men,</Q> or even below them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is willing to believe, however, that an <HI>Allegory</HI> may be couched under all this, and I wish any Body could discover it: In the mean Time I can't but observe, that 'tis great Pity the Gods and Goddesses that often appear so nobly in separate <HI>Machines</HI> throughout the <HI>Iliad,</HI> should make so mean a Figure in the present Battle.</P>
<P>I must request your Attention to one Incident more, which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would fain reconcile us to, viz. the Flight of <HI>Hector</HI> in the 22d Book. I ap∣prehend
<PB N="405" REF="507"/>
that what that Commentator alledges from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 180. B. xxii.</NOTE>Conduct of <HI>Virgil,</HI> <Q>who transferred this Passage to the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI></Q> and likewise from the Doctrine of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> is extremely insuffi∣cient for his Purpose. <HI>Turnus</HI> is a Character much inferiour to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and therefore we are little shocked at his running away from him. But this is confessedly not the Case, the Point of mere Strength excepted, with <HI>Hector</HI> when compared to <HI>Achilles.</HI> It was, you'll say, that very Strength which he feared—was it not, that very Strength too, which he had frequently encountered? And if it was not <HI>necessary</HI> he <HI>should</HI> fly; I will venture to say it is a Circumstance infinitely <HI>disagreeable</HI> to the Reader, that he <HI>does.</HI></P>
<P>Nor farther is "the Suffrage of <HI>Aristotle"</HI> himself, if I understand it at all, satisfactory upon this Point. <Q>The <HI>wonderful,</HI> says he, ought to have Place in Tragedy, but still more in Epic Poetry, which proceeds in this Point even to the <HI>unreasonable:</HI> For as in Epic Poems one sees not the Persons acting, so whatever <HI>passes the Bounds of Reason,</HI> is proper to Produce the <HI>ad∣mirable</HI> and the <HI>marvellous.</HI> For Example, what <HI>Homer</HI> says of <HI>Hector</HI> pursued by <HI>Achilles,</HI> would appear ridiculous on the Stage; for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to see on
<PB N="406" REF="508"/>
one Side the <HI>Greeks</HI> standing without any Mo∣tion, and on the other, <HI>Achilles</HI> pursuing <HI>Hector</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. But all this does not appear when we read the Poem; for what is <HI>wonderful,</HI> is always <HI>agreeable,</HI> and as a Proof of it, we find that they who relate any Thing, usually add something to the Truth, that it may the better please those who hear it.</Q></P>
<P>What can we infer from all this, but that the Flight of <HI>Hector</HI> round the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> is an <HI>Action,</HI> which, as <HI>such,</HI> will much better bear being <HI>told,</HI> than represented? No doubt of it—but is an Action, all this while, which is <HI>unrea∣sonable</HI> in itself, <HI>therefore agreeable, because</HI> it may be <HI>told</HI> with Propriety? Do we never <HI>wonder</HI> with∣out <HI>admiring,</HI> or <HI>marvel</HI> with <HI>Disgust,</HI> as well as <HI>Delight?</HI> I <HI>will grant</HI> this Incident renders this Part of the Poem more <HI>astonishing,</HI> as <HI>Aristotle</HI> says in a subsequent Paragraph of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note; but why it is more <HI>admirable,</HI> I am quite at a loss to conceive.</P>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> urges himself in Vindication of this Circumstance, has much more Weight in it; as <Q>that <HI>Hector</HI> never thought himself a Match for <HI>Achilles;</HI> that this Incident is pre∣pared by Degrees, as <HI>Dacier</HI> has observed too; that, the mere Sight and Voice of <HI>Achilles</HI> un∣armed, has terrified and put the whole <HI>Trojan</HI> Army into Disorder: That <HI>Hector</HI> stays, not that
<PB N="407" REF="509"/>
he Hopes to overcome <HI>Achilles,</HI> but because, Shame, &amp;c. forbid him to re-enter the City; that he stayed by the immediate <HI>Will of Hea∣ven,</HI> irresistibly bound down by Fate: That he had been reflecting on the Injustice of the War he maintained; that his Spirits are depressed by Heaven: That he flies not from <HI>Achilles</HI> as a mortal Hero, but from one whom he sees clad in impenetrable Armour, seconded by <HI>Mi∣nerva,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> which Considerations do in∣deed amount to a Proof of the <HI>Probability</HI> of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Flight, but, I think, are no Argument for the <HI>Necessity</HI> of it. In short, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself says, <Q>he don't absolutely pretend to justify this Passage in every Point,</Q> I presume I may ven∣ture to say, if <HI>Hector</HI> had stood his Ground, we should have liked the Poem better for it.</P>
<P>I can't think, by the way, that it is <Q>a high Exaltation of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that so brave a Man as <HI>Hector</HI> durst not <HI>stand him.</HI></Q> It would methinks have redounded more to <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Glory, had <HI>Hec∣tor</HI> been represented as a <HI>Match</HI> for him. Indeed <Q>this great Event, wherein the whole Fate of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI> was decided by the Sword of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and <HI>Hector,</HI></Q> does less Honour to that Hero than any one Action he had been engaged in, for the last of the above Reasons alledged for <HI>Hector</HI>'s Flight, and besause <Q>he <HI>knew</HI> that <HI>Hector</HI> was to fall by his Hand.</Q> He was assured of this by <HI>Neptune,</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> in the 21st. Book.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>IF you consider the <HI>Iliad</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> with any thing of exactness of Attention, you will per∣ceive numberless Marks of a Genius, thoughtless of, or, it may be, superiour to the Niceties, and Proprieties in which the Excellencies of second-rate Authors wholly consist. To what has been offered already for the Illustration of this Truth you may add, if you please, the <HI>Repetitions</HI> with which <HI>Homer</HI> so much abounds. I am far from asserting that these are never proper, tho' they are often, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> confesses, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 570. B. viii.</NOTE>visibly absurd. I will only point out one Place, where it is owing to a <HI>Repetition,</HI> that the very Design of the Author cannot easily be understood: I mean the Speech of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in the 9th Book, wherein he proposes to the Generals to quit the Siege, &amp;c. <Q>The Cri∣ticks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 23. B. ix.</NOTE>are divided in their Opinion, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> acquaints us, whether this Speech, which is Word for Word the same with that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> makes in the 2d Book, be only a Feint to try the Army, as it is there, or the real Sentiments of the General.</Q> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> says, <Q>He does not pretend to decide upon this Point</Q> nor is it in∣deed of any great Consequence, any farther than as it makes good what has been remarked; however that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> upon this Occasion spoke his real Sentiments is, I think most probable, because upon a Parallel one in the 14th Book, he proposes the very
<PB N="410" REF="512"/>
same Thing to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Princes, tho' in dif∣ferent Words.</P>
<P>Again, it is in my Opinion more reasonable to put the frequent <HI>Incongruities</HI> we meet with in <HI>Homer</HI> to the Account of Inadvertency, &amp;c. than to reconcile them by forced and unnatural Con∣structions. Thus <HI>Minerva,</HI> who is always repre∣sented as prudently suppressing her Anger upon <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s declaring himself for <HI>Troy,</HI> does yet in one Place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 435, &amp;c. B. viii.</NOTE>break out into as much Virulency of Language as <HI>Juno</HI> herself.—Thus <HI>Neptune</HI> in the same Book, when <HI>Juno</HI> sollicits him to assist the <HI>Greeks,</HI> rejects so desperate a Proposal with In∣dignation;</P>
<LG>
<L>What Rage, what Madness, furious Queen is thine?</L>
<L>I war not with the Highest. All above</L>
<L>Submit and tremble at the Hand of <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L><BIBL>B. viii. L. 255, &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>But in the 15th Book he talks in a quite differ∣ent Strain, and seems determined to dispute the Superiority with <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself.</P>
<LG>
<L>What means the haughty Sov'reign of the Skies?</L>
<L>Rule as he will his portion'd Realms on high,</L>
<L>No Vassal God, nor of his Train am I.—</L>
<L><HI>Olympus,</HI> and this Earth, in common lie;</L>
<L>What Claim has here the Tyrant of the Sky? &amp;c.</L>
<L><BIBL>B. xv. L. 206. &amp;c.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>—Thus <HI>Diomed,</HI> to give you one Instance more, <Q>is seized with Fear at the very Sight <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 448. B. xi.</NOTE>of <HI>Hector</HI>
<PB N="411" REF="513"/>
in the 11th Book for which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> gives us no other Reason than that</Q> <HI>Diomed</HI> had just told <Q>us, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> fought against the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and yet in the 8th Book, when that Deity <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 164. B. viii.</NOTE>personally interposes, and throws a burning Thunderbolt at the Feet of this Hero's Horses,</Q> he can scarce prevail with himself to retreat.
<Q><L>Thrice turn'd the Chief, and thrice imperial <HI>Jove</HI></L>
<L>On <HI>Ida</HI>'s Summits thunder'd from above.</L>
<BIBL>B. viii. L. 206.</BIBL></Q>
It should be remembered too, that at the very Time when <HI>Diomed</HI> is struck with this Panick the Poet tells us (notwithstanding the Favour of <HI>Ju∣piter</HI> to <HI>Troy)</HI> the Battle was doubtful.
<Q><L>—And level hangs the doubtful Scale of Fight.</L>
<BIBL>L. 437.</BIBL></Q>
Nay at that Instant the <HI>Greeks</HI> were Victors. <HI>Ulysses</HI> kills <HI>Hypirochus</HI> and <HI>Hippodamus: Diomed</HI> slays <HI>Agastrophus,</HI> and even gives <HI>Hector</HI> a Blow that stuns him, and insults him afterwards, &amp;c. (see from Line 416 to 474.) It is needless to mul∣tiply such Examples.</P>
<P>I should lastly be inclined to ascribe to the same Cause the frequent <HI>Unsuitableness</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Epi∣thets,</HI> &amp;c. which as they are sometimes distinctive and <HI>specific,</HI> if I may so say, so are they often ge∣neral and applied at random. <HI>Priam</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
<PB N="412" REF="514"/>
himself has <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 442. B. vii.</NOTE>observ'd) is stiled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> when <Q>he rejects the wholsome Advice of <HI>Antenor,</HI> and complies with his Son.</Q>—It is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the <HI>godlike Polydore,</HI> whom <HI>Achilles</HI> kills in the 20th Book; and yet <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See L. 471. B. xx.</NOTE>this Hero is only the youngest Son of <HI>Priam,</HI> was for∣bidden to fight, and famous only for the Swiftness of his Speed, &amp;c.
<Q><L>To the forbidden Field he takes his Flight,</L>
<L>In the first Folly of a youthful Knight. <BIBL>L. 475.</BIBL></L></Q>
The Mention of these glaring Improprieties, is abundantly sufficient for the Purpose; else you might be directed to many more of the like <HI>Sort</HI> in almost any Book of the Poem: Though they may not be improper in an equal <HI>Degree.</HI></P>
<P>I have now finished my Remarks upon the <HI>Iliad</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> with as much Accuracy, I hope, as was requisite; and must leave it to your Consideration, whether the common Opinion in respect of this Poet, founded on the Interpretations, and the Prejudices, &amp;c. of the Commentators, be not on many Accounts an erroneous one. If you will suppose this Author to have been not only the most <HI>sublime,</HI> but the most <HI>simple</HI> too of all Writers, you will, I believe, have a much more natural and ready Excuse for many of his Ble∣mishes than the Shifts and Glosses of Interpreters
<PB N="413" REF="515"/>
can supply you with. Indeed these Defects in an original Author, who was inspired with the Spirit of Poetry even to a Degree of Enthusiasm (to which Inadvertency and Extravagance are essential) will in a great Measure carry their Apology with them.—I have given you my Sentiments impar∣tially, and should take a much greater Pleasure in reviewing the Beauties of this admirable Poet than I have done in arraigning his Faults; but Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> to whom I refer you, has illustrated these to more Advantage than I could.—The Practice of suc∣ceeding Writers of many Denominations is a De∣monstration that we may find a great deal more in <HI>Homer</HI> to <HI>imitate</HI> than to <HI>avoid.</HI> To convince you of my high Esteem of him, and that I mean to part in Friendship with him, I will finish with Part of that Translation from <HI>Longinus,</HI> varying only, and abating an Expression or two, which concludes Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notes on the sixth Book. <Q>In our Decisions on the Characters of great Men, &amp;c. we must impartially confess, that, with all their Errors, they have more Perfections than the Nature of Man can almost be conceived capable of attaining.—He who commits no Faults is barely read without <HI>Censure;</HI> but a Genius truly great excites <HI>Admiration.</HI> In short the Magnificence of a single Period in one of these admirable Authors is, <HI>almost,</HI> sufficient to atone for all their Defects: Nay farther, if any
<PB N="414" REF="516"/>
one should collect from <HI>Homer</HI> all the Errors that have escaped him, they would bear but little Proportion to the many Beauties to be met with in, <HI>almost,</HI> every Page of his Writings. 'Tis on this Account that Envy, through so many Ages hath never been able to wrest from him the Prize of Eloquence, &amp;c. &amp;c. which his Merits have so justly acquired: An Acqui∣sition which he still is, and will in all Probabi∣lity continue possessed of,</Q>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>IN my former Letters I endeavoured to enter∣tain you with some free, but, I hope, just Remarks upon Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Commentaries upon <HI>Homer.</HI> If you please we will now take a short Review of that excellent Person's <HI>Translation</HI> of the same incomparable Author. I must once more prevent your Surprize, and perhaps your In∣dignation, by declaring that I agree with all the World in allowing this to be, in the main, the best <HI>Translation,</HI> that our, or it may be, any Language has produced. If I think we might have had a better <HI>Translation</HI> in some few Respects, I only mean that we might have had it from Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
<PB N="415" REF="517"/>
himself. Nay, I will go a Step further, and grant you with much Satisfaction that this celebrated <HI>Translator</HI> always errs on the right Side, and even when he does not do his Reader <HI>Justice,</HI> never fails to do <HI>Honour</HI> to his <HI>Original:</HI> I should rather say, to <HI>himself;</HI> for if Boldness of Figure, Force of Expression, Smoothness and Ease of Numbers, and the Correspondence of Sound with Sense, be the great Beauties of poetical Diction, I should make no Scruple, upon the whole, to prefer the <HI>English Iliad,</HI> to the <HI>Greek.</HI> But these very Excel∣lencies are in some Sort his Errors, and what I admire in this <HI>Poem,</HI> I can't help often consider∣ing as blameable in the <HI>Translation.</HI> In short, it is the <HI>Over-poeticalness</HI> of this <HI>Translation,</HI> if I may so call it, which I take to be exceptionable in many Place. And yet, as there was no Dan∣ger of so naturally a warm <HI>Translator</HI>'s sinking into Flatness, and Insipidity, so one would have thought he had laid himself under Restraints suffi∣cient to have prevented his ever soaring into the other Extreme of Rapture, and Extravagance.—There is not more <HI>Fire</HI> in any one Part of the <HI>Translation,</HI> than there is good Sense and cool Reasoning in the following Extract from the <HI>Preface.</HI> <Q>It should be considered what Me∣thods may afford some Equivalent in our Lan∣guage for the Graces of these (viz. the <HI>Diction</HI> and <HI>Versification)</HI> in the <HI>Greek.</HI> It is certain
<PB N="416" REF="518"/>
no literal Translation can be just to an excel∣lent Original in a superior Language; but it is a great Mistake to imagine that a rash Para∣phrase can make Amends for this general De∣fect; which is no less in Danger to lose the Spirit of an Ancient, by deviating into the modern Manners of Expression. If there be sometimes a Darkness, there is often a Light in Antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a Version almost literal. I know no Li∣berties one ought to take, but those which are necessary for translating the Spirit of the Ori∣ginal, and supporting the poetical Style of the Translation: And I will venture to say, there have not been more Men misled in former Times by a servile dull Adherence to the Letter, than have been deluded in ours, by a chime∣rical insolent Hope of raising and improving their Author. It is not to be doubted that the <HI>Fire</HI> of the Poem is what a Translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his managing: However it is his safest Way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is, in any particular Place. 'Tis a great Secret in writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figu∣rative; and it is what <HI>Homer</HI> will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in his Footsteps.
<PB N="417" REF="519"/>
Where his Diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be de∣terred from imitating him by the fear of incur∣ring the Censure of a mere <HI>English</HI> Critick. Nothing that belongs to <HI>Homer</HI> seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just Pitch of his Style; some of his Translators ha∣ving swelled into Fustian in a proud Confidence of the <HI>Sublime:</HI> Others sunk into Flatness in a cold and timorous Notion of <HI>Simplicity.</HI>—There is a graceful, and dignified Simplicity, as well as a bald and sordid one, &amp;c.—'Tis one Thing to be nicked up, and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mien between Ostentation and Rusticity.</Q></P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had always conducted his Transla∣tion conformably to these just Sentiments, it would have been the most <HI>exact,</HI> as it is now the most <HI>Spirited</HI> one extant: But, I believe, you will by and by be convinced that he has often <HI>modernized</HI> his Original too much, and sacrificed the true Simplicity of the Antients in general, and the par∣ticular Air, and Cast of his Author, either to an Excess of Affection for him, and Desire to set his Work in the most advantageous Light to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Reader, or to an undue Fear of lessening and injuring him thro' the Inferiority of our Lan∣guage to the <HI>Grecian</HI> in many Respects. To one or
<PB N="418" REF="520"/>
both of those we are indebted, I presume, for many bold Strokes of Poetry, and fine Pieces of Paint∣ing, and Imagery, which are not so much Copies of, as Refinements on, the Original.</P>
<P>And, by the Way, it may be remarked that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should have been more than ordinarily cautious upon this Article, as he was under an absolute Necessity of <HI>sinking</HI> some Peculiarities in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Diction, which would not bear Trans∣planting into our <HI>Tongue.</HI> Such are his <HI>compound Epithets,</HI> and <HI>Repetitions.</HI> How our <HI>Translator</HI> has acquitted himself with regard to these, you will be best informed by consulting himself. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>It is however to be observed in general, that every Thing <HI>characteristical</HI> in an Author, is, as far as may be, to be most religiously retained; and that, notwithstanding the allowed occasional Use of the <HI>Periphrasis,</HI> or <HI>Circumlocution,</HI> the <HI>Trans∣position</HI> of Words, and the <HI>Substitution</HI> of one Ex∣pression in the Room of another, &amp;c. &amp;c. by Means of which the Spirit of an Original is pre∣served without Prejudice to the literal Sense, all imaginable Care is to be taken that these Liber∣ties under the Pretence of maintaining and sup∣porting this Spirit, do not really over-power, and extinguish it. <HI>Redundancies</HI> are as <HI>unoriginal</HI> as <HI>Insipidities,</HI> and the Spirit of an Author may be
<PB N="419" REF="521"/>
as much overwhelmed in Exuberance on the one Hand, as it evaporates in Frigidity on the other.—<HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> are scarce more opposite than Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Translation</HI> of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and that of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> by Dr. <HI>Trapp;</HI> I am apt to think we shall often form very wrong Ideas of these Poems if we regulate them by these respective Transla∣tions; for Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> seems to have exalted the true Simplicity of <HI>Homer,</HI> as "graceful and dignified" as it is, in the same Degree that the <HI>Doctor</HI> has debased the Majesty of <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>You will begin to think it high Time I should make good this Charge, which I shall accordingly endeavour to do by pointing to a few select Pas∣sages out of Numbers that might be produced, in which you will plainly discover certain <HI>Bold∣nesses,</HI> and <HI>Prettynesses,</HI> (for you must gratify me in the Use of that Term for them) and very fre∣quently a Mixture of both, that were taken from the Store-house of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s own Imagination, and are utterly foreign to, and destructive of, the plain Scope, and unaffected Spirit of his Author.</P>
<P>There is not perhaps in all the <HI>Iliad</HI> a more pompous Description than that of <HI>Achilles</HI> arming himself in the 19th Book. The Comparisons, and Images, (as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> well observes) <Q>rise in a noble Scale one above another; the Hero is set in a still stronger Point of Light than before, till he is at last in a Manner covered over with
<PB N="420" REF="522"/>
Glories; he is at first likened to the Moonlight, then to the Flames of a Beacon, then to a Comet, and lastly to the Sun itself.</Q> But with all this Sublimity, and almost <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> there is a Simplicity which is, I conceive, lost in that Exaggeration of Imagery with which the Trans∣lator has embelished the Passage. The whole Description, which is too long to be transcribed, is rather loosely paraphrased perhaps than other∣wise, but the Parts I have marked are so many beautiful Excrescencies, which have no Sort of Warrant from the Letter, or most of them even from the Import of the Text.</P>

<P>The Affectation of Poetry in all these Places has diffused an Air over Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Translation</HI> quite different from the neat, but generally un∣ornamented Style of his Author, to which the in∣expressible <HI>simplex munditiis</HI> of <HI>Horace</HI> may perti∣nently enough be applied.

<P>I have often thought it was with the same View to <HI>Ornament,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> wrote his <HI>Translation</HI> in Rhime. However what Advantages were hereby gained we shall see presently; but it is certain in the mean time that by the Use of it, the Translation becomes absolutely <HI>modern,</HI> and in its very <HI>Form unlike</HI> the Original. Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> says in his Dedication prefixed to his <HI>Translation</HI> of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> <Q>that he who can write well in Rhime, may write better in blank Verse;</Q> and that <Q>Rhime is a Constraint even to the best Po∣ets, and those who make it with most Ease; that what it adds to Sweetness, it takes away from Sense; and that it often makes us swerve from an Author's Meaning.</Q>—I wish, by the by, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> had not asserted one Way and <HI>translated</HI> another.—It is plain the <HI>Superfluities</HI> complained of in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> are in a great Measure to be im∣puted to this Method of <HI>Translation.</HI></P>

<P>I have purposely selected these Verses because, excepting the mark'd <HI>Redundancies</HI> which the <HI>Rhime required,</HI> they are as <HI>close a Translation,</HI> as any in the whole Performance. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> no doubt was sensible of this Inconvenience naturally inseparable from <HI>Rhime;</HI> but he supposed probably, the Ad∣vantage gained thereby in point of Smoothness, and Harmony would make sufficient Amends for it. Of all Things he would not have his Author thought <HI>unpoetical,</HI> though there are certainly many Passages in him, which, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself occasionally acknowledges, are <Q>not made to
<PB N="429" REF="531"/>
shine in Poetry.</Q> It would be tedious to pick out all these, and therefore I will only, for Illustra∣tion's Sake, transcribe a very remarkable one, in which a most simple, unadorned Narration of <HI>Homer</HI> consisting of a List of <HI>proper Names,</HI> and those even without <HI>Epithets</HI> for the far greater Part, is, by Virtue of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Adjuncts, Circumlocu∣tions,</HI> and <HI>Rhimes,</HI> transformed into as <HI>poetical</HI> and entertaining a Description as most in the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>

This whole Passage, which makes so <HI>pretty</HI> a <HI>Figure</HI> in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Hands, if literally (I mean fairly) translated, and that too in <HI>blank</HI> Verse, would undoubtedly be very flat and spiritless.

are more just <HI>Translations</HI> than any two Lines of the whole Number though they have neither <HI>Fire,</HI> nor <HI>Fancy</HI> in them. In such Places as these <HI>Rhime</HI> may among other Expedients help to save the <HI>poetical</HI> Character of an Author by giving a <HI>seeming</HI> Equivalent for <HI>Spirit</HI> in <HI>Sound.</HI>—But why must a <HI>Translation</HI> be beautiful and poetical when the <HI>Original</HI> is not so?—It is the Business of a <HI>Tran∣slator</HI> to give us the <HI>whole</HI> of an Author, not at <HI>all</HI> Events to make the <HI>best</HI> of him.—I will venture to say that had Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> obliged the World with a <HI>blank</HI> Verse Translation of <HI>Homer,</HI> at the same Time that he would have <HI>more</HI> effectually preserved the <HI>Air,</HI> he would have deviated <HI>less</HI> from the <HI>Sense</HI> of his Author; and that his Version upon the <HI>whole</HI> would have been as poetical, as animated, and even as harmonious as the present. Dr. <HI>Trapp</HI> observes, I think, very justly in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the Aeneid, that <Q>blank Verse is not only more majestic &amp;c. but more musical and harmonious than Rhime: It has, says he, more <HI>Rhime</HI> in it according to the ancient and true Sense of the Word, than
<PB N="431" REF="533"/>
<HI>Rhime</HI> itself as it is now used. For, in its ori∣ginal Signification, it consists not in the tinkling of Vowels and Consonants, but in the metrical Disposition of Words and Syllables, and the proper Cadence of Numbers; which is more agreeable to the Ear, without the jingling of like Endings than with it.</Q>—After all, the <HI>Measure</HI> in <HI>blank</HI> Verse does <HI>really</HI> and specifi∣cally distinguish it from <HI>mere</HI> Prose; and if so, <HI>Rhime</HI> is not wanted for this Purpose. Nor can it be pretended that the strong <HI>Colours</HI> of Poetry, the Beauties of Description, Figures, Images, &amp;c. &amp;c. are capable of being displayed to more Advantage in <HI>Rhime,</HI> than in <HI>blank</HI> Verse.—Indeed <HI>these</HI> are not peculiar even to Poetry; they are independent on <HI>Metre,</HI> and de∣rive not Energy or Strength, but Gracefulness only and Dignity from <HI>Numbers.</HI>—They are <HI>fitter</HI> for <HI>Verse</HI> than <HI>Prose,</HI> but not more <HI>essential</HI> to it.—Thus the bold <HI>Figures, Similies,</HI> and <HI>Thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>Homer</HI> would be of the same intrinsic Va∣lue out of <HI>Measure,</HI> as in it;—as the Holy Scrip∣tures, by the way, though literally translated in plain <HI>Prose,</HI> are in numberless Instances <HI>poetical,</HI> though they are by no means a <HI>Poem.</HI>—It is not for the sake of <HI>Lustre,</HI> but <HI>Order,</HI> that Diamonds and Pearls are ranged upon a String.—But to re∣turn to Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI>—Whatever Credit his <HI>Transla∣tion</HI> may have done the Original by heightening
<PB N="432" REF="534"/>
and improving it in some Respects, by Means of <HI>Rhime</HI> (and thereby skreening sometimes a Sim∣plicity or perhaps a Flatness, and Frigidity of Diction which <HI>Homer</HI> only was answerable for) 'tis as true too that it sometimes by Reason <HI>only</HI> of the <HI>Rhime</HI> falls short of it, and is less beautiful and significant in itself. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is very happy in his Imitations of those Passages where <HI>Homer</HI> "applies the Sound to the Sense" (see particularly B. i. Ver. 451. &amp;c. B. x. Ver. 444. &amp;c. B. xiii. Ver. 191. &amp;c. B. xiii. Ver. 1005.) but he would have succeeded still more in these Places, I presume, had he been uncumbered with the Shackles of <HI>Rhime.</HI> How much better and stronger would the following Lines have appeared without <HI>Rhimes</HI> than with them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER reading my last, you will not won∣der to hear me wishing <HI>Rhimes</HI> were ut∣terly banished from <HI>Great Poetry;</HI> by which the Critics understand the <HI>Epopee,</HI> and the <HI>Drama.</HI> How far they may be requisite, or even beautiful in <HI>Lyric, Elegiac, Pastoral,</HI> &amp;c. or especially <HI>Di∣dactic Poetry</HI> I shall not enquire; but 'tis certain they are in general rather Obstructions than Helps towards the great Purposes of firing the Heart, and moving the Passions.—You need only read over your <HI>Milton,</HI> and the best <HI>Tragedies</HI> of <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> to be convinced of this.—And if I would have ev'ry <HI>First-Rate, Original</HI> Poem written in <HI>blank</HI> Verse for the Sake of the <HI>Ear,</HI> as well as the <HI>Heart,</HI> I must still more strongly recommend the Use of the same to <HI>Translations.—Rhime</HI> is so abhorrent from the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Genius</HI> of the antient Poetry, that nothing but the absolute Necessity of
<PB N="434" REF="536"/>
it can, I think, render it dispensable in an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Version.—Now <HI>convenient</HI> it may sometimes be, but it is never <HI>necessary</HI>—Whatever are the Imperfections, and Defects of our Language, they are, it is my Opinion, such, as <HI>Rhime,</HI> tho' it may <HI>disguise,</HI> can never <HI>supply.</HI> But I would ex∣clude <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> from <HI>Poetry,</HI> as well as <HI>Religion,</HI> and confess for my own Part, that I had much rather see a <HI>Translation</HI> in <HI>some</HI> Places <HI>inferior</HI> to its Original, than unlike it in <HI>all.</HI> If upon the <HI>whole</HI> not only the very <HI>Cast,</HI> but the Sense and Spirit of an Author may be better preserved in <HI>blank</HI> Verse than <HI>Rhime,</HI> every reasonable Critic will make Allowances for the Poverty, and natu∣ral Inferiority of our Mother Tongue. Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI>'s Translation of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is a very noble one; tho' I cannot conceive what induced him to give it us in <HI>Rhime,</HI> unless it was the Appre∣hension of the Inequality of our Language to the Diction of his Author where it is most plain, and unpoetical. Indeed <HI>Purity,</HI> and <HI>Man∣liness</HI> are the chief <HI>Characteristics</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> as <HI>Fire,</HI> and <HI>Vivacity</HI> are those of <HI>Homer;</HI> for which Reason I should imagine the latter a more <HI>attemptable</HI> Author, than the former, if Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had not precluded every Under∣taking of this Nature, even tho' he wrote in <HI>Rhime.</HI> For bold <HI>Figures,</HI> strong <HI>Paintings,</HI> and beauti∣ful <HI>Colourings</HI> may be ransfused from one Lan∣guage
<PB N="435" REF="537"/>
to another: but <HI>Purity, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Elegance,</HI> tho' they are the same things in all Tongues, are not equally striking in them all.—However, no <HI>Translation</HI> can go farther than the <HI>Genius</HI> of our Language will admit; and even with regard to <HI>Virgil,</HI> it will go, I am inclined to believe, far enough to convey a <HI>strong</HI> Idea of this noble Original in <HI>all</HI> its Parts. It will go farther at least without <HI>Rhime,</HI> than with it. Dr. <HI>Trapp</HI> indeed, than whom no Body better <HI>under∣stood</HI> his Author, by too superstitious an Adherence to the <HI>Letter,</HI> and particularly a fruitless and per∣petual Endeavour to retain the <HI>Brevity</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> is cold and languid upon numberless Occasions; and has thereby perhaps contributed more to the Disreputation of <HI>blank</HI> Verse, than any other Wri∣ter. He was offended, and not without Reason, with the <HI>Licentiousness</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Transla∣tion; but his <HI>squeamishness</HI> has carried him into the other Extreme; for if Mr. <HI>Dryden runs away</HI> from <HI>Virgil,</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI> is <HI>tied to him.</HI>—There is, by the by, this observable Difference, between Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Deviations from <HI>Virgil,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s from <HI>Homer,</HI> that those of the latter are always uniform, graceful, and beautiful, and if they are not <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Thoughts</HI> are at least <HI>worthy</HI> of him; whereas Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> is apt to dwindle into a kind of <HI>Puerility,</HI> which was but too na∣tural to him, that is altogether unsuitable to the
<PB N="136" REF="538"/>
<HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI> of <HI>Virgil.</HI>—Between this <HI>Translator</HI> then and Dr. <HI>Trapp,</HI> there lay a <HI>middle</HI> Way, which Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> has judiciously taken, and religiously pursued, to the immortal Glory of <HI>Vir∣gil,</HI> to his own infinite Honour, and the Credit of our Language. Notwithstanding all this, I think, he has left Room for a <HI>Translation</HI> of <HI>another Kind</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Trapp</HI> says of <HI>his,</HI> when compared with Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s) by writing in <HI>Rhime.</HI>—I attempted some time ago, for my own Amusement, to trans∣late some of the <HI>Speeches</HI> in the first Book of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> into <HI>blank</HI> Verse, from a Notion that <HI>Virgil</HI> <Q>if he had been born in <HI>England,</HI> and in this present Age</Q> (as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> expresses himself) would have spoken <HI>something</HI> like such <HI>English</HI> as I flattered myself I could speak for him.—I have ventured to send you a few <HI>Specimens,</HI> which for your Satisfaction I could wish you diligently, and impartially to compare with the several <HI>Transla∣ions,</HI> and with the <HI>Original</HI> itself.

<L>O Thou eternal King of Gods, and Men,</L>
<L>Whose bolted Thunders shake the trembling World;</L>
<L>Say, what Offence of my unhappy Son,</L>
<L>Or what new Crime of <HI>Troy</HI> provokes thy Wrath;</L>
<L>That thus thro' endless Ruin, in vain search</L>
<L>Of <HI>Latium</HI>'s wish'd for Coasts, distrest we roam,</L>
<L>The Outcasts still of each forbidden Shore?</L>
<L>Thy Promise bade us hope, an After-Age</L>
<L>Should reinstate in <HI>Italy</HI> the Race</L>
<L>Of antient <HI>Teucer,</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI> bear</L>
<L>Dominion o'er the habitable Globe.</L>
<L>What has my Father's gracious Purpose chang'd?</L>
<L>With this amusing Hope I sooth'd my Woes,</L>
<L>And 'gainst the wretched Fall of ruin'd <HI>Troy</HI></L>
<L>Ballanc'd the Glories of a happier Fate.</L>
<L>But the same adverse Fortune still pursues</L>
<L>Our harrass'd Tribes—when will our Toils have End?</L>
<L><HI>Antenor</HI> scap'd thro' all the Hosts of <HI>Greece,</HI></L>
<L>Safely he past th' <HI>Illyrian</HI> Bay, and pierc'd</L>
<L><HI>Liburnia</HI>'s inmost Regions, to the Source</L>
<L>Of rich <HI>Timavus;</HI> from whose plenteous Spring</L>
<L>Nine Torrents, rushing like the Ocean's Tide,</L>
<L>Rebellow thro' the Mountain's hollow Womb,</L>
<L>And pour the roaring Deluge o'er the Plain.</L>
<L>Yet here he rais'd aspiring <HI>Padua</HI>'s Walls,</L>

New-nam'd the Nation, fix'd the Arms of <HI>Troy,</HI></L>
<L>And now enjoys the placid Sweets of Peace.</L>
<L>While We, descended from thy mighty Loins,</L>

<L>Our Ships far-scatter'd o'er the Main, ourselves</L>
<L>Deliver'd up to <HI>Juno</HI>'s cruel Rage,</L>
<L>Long seek in vain <HI>Hesperia</HI>'s fruitful Shores.</L>
<L>Is Piety rewarded, honour'd thus?</L>
<L>Is this the Kingdom for my Son reserv'd?</L>

<L>Daughter dismiss thy Fears—fix'd are the Fates</L>
<L>Of thy beloved Race; thou shalt behold</L>
<L>The fair <HI>Lavinium</HI>'s promis'd Turrets rise,</L>
<L>Another <HI>Troy!</HI>—sublime thou shalt exalt</L>
<L>Thy gallant-hearted Son above the Stars.—</L>
<L>So stedfast is the Will of Sov'reign <HI>Jove!</HI>—</L>
<L>But since this anxious Care still pangs thy Breast,</L>
<L>List, while the secret Volume of dark Fate</L>
<L>I open to thy View.—Thy great <HI>Aeneas</HI></L>
<L>Thro' <HI>Italy</HI> shall bear the mighty War,</L>
<L>And bruise the savage Nations;—his high Pow'r</L>
<L>Shall found new Cities, and prescribe new Laws;</L>
<L>For three auspicious Years the rolling Suns</L>
<L>Shall hail him Monarch of the vanquish'd Tribes:</L>
<L>The Boy <HI>Ascanius,</HI> now <HI>Julus</HI> call'd,</L>
<L><HI>(Ilus</HI> his Name while flourish'd <HI>Ilium</HI>'s state)</L>
<L><PB N="441" REF="543"/>
Shall measure round thrice ten revolving Years</L>
<L>In his imperial Sway; then from <HI>Lavinium</HI></L>
<L>The Seat of growing Empire shall transfer,</L>
<L>And with long Ramparts fence proud <HI>Alba</HI>'s Tow'rs.</L>
<L>Here till three glorious Centuries expire,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Hector</HI>'s Race shall full Dominion hold:</L>
<L>When <HI>Ilia,</HI> Priestess Queen, two Sons shall bear,</L>
<L>Illustrious Progeny, the Seed of <HI>Mars;</HI></L>
<L>Then <HI>Romulus,</HI> the first of mortal Names,</L>
<L>The royal Suckling of a tawny Wolf,</L>
<L>Shall rear his scepter'd Hand; high shall he raise</L>
<L>His City sacred to the God of War,</L>
<L>And from his mighty Self shall be deriv'd</L>
<L>The Names august of <HI>Romans,</HI> and of <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>To these my fav'rite People I appoint</L>
<L>Nor Bound of Glory, nor Extent of Sway—</L>
<L>E'en she, the vengeful <HI>Juno,</HI> that fatigues</L>
<L>Earth, Sea, and Heav'n itself with horrid Broils,</L>
<L>At length shall feel her stubborn Heart relent</L>
<L>To milder Counsels; and with me protect</L>
<L>The Sons of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Nation of the Gown,</L>
<L>The future Masters of the subject World.</L>
<L>So will the Fates.—I see the distant Age,</L>
<L>When the brave Race of old <HI>Assaracus</HI></L>
<L>Shall bend the fam'd <HI>Mycene</HI> to the Yoke,</L>
<L>To vanquish'd <HI>Argos</HI> give the sov'reign Law,</L>
<L>And stretch their Conquests o'er the Realms of <HI>Greece.</HI></L>
<L>From this fair Line shall <HI>Trojan Caesar</HI> spring,</L>
<L>Whose Rule the Seas, whose Fame the Stars shall bound,</L>
<L><PB N="442" REF="544"/>
The Lord of all the Nations; <HI>Julius</HI> call'd</L>
<L>From great <HI>Julus</HI> his high Ancestor;</L>
<L>Him, fraught with Spoils, the Conq'ror of the <HI>East,</HI></L>
<L>Thou shalt advance among his Kindred Gods,</L>
<L>And Mortals shall invoke his Pow'r divine.</L>
<L>Then golden Days of Peace shall bless the Land,</L>
<L>Quirinus, Remus, Vesta <HI>shall return,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Old Faith</HI> shall flourish, and the World be rul'd</L>
<L>By righteous Laws; vast adamantine Bolts</L>
<L>Shall close the Gates of War; within dire <HI>Fury</HI></L>
<L>Shall sit on heaps of Arms distilling Blood,</L>
<L>Bound with an hundred Links of knotted Brass,</L>
<L>And bellowing grind his Jaws besmear'd with Gore.</L>

<P>You have in these few Passages in the Original, a Sample sufficient to regulate your Idea of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Style in general by; which, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> justly remarks, is eminent for its <Q>Clearness, it Purity, its Easiness, and its Magnificence; to which we must add no doubt, that which can rarely be transferred with any tolerable Grace into our Language, viz. its Brevity.</Q>—How far these Translations do justice to the Original, as far as may be, in regard to all these Particulars, or whe∣ther equal Justice can possibly be done to it by Rhime from the very Nature of it, I now leave it with you to judge, and am,</P>
