<P>HURLY-BURLY; or, The FAIRY of the WELL, being a novel species of En∣tertainment, partaking as well of the Ita∣lian Comedy as the English Pantomime, and much of the plot depending on dia∣logue, some of which might, from a va∣riety of circumstances at the representation, be lost to many of the audience, it has been deemed adviseable to print such parts of it as have an immediate relation to the plot.</P>

Another Harlequin from foreign shores,</L>
<L>Aloft in air now o'er our channel soars.</L>
<L>My spells shall make the solid rock give way,</L>

<L>Flitting Daemon's of the air,</L>

<STAGE>The <HI>Fairy</HI> rises from the Well to soft Music, and presents a large Crystal Goblet of Water.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY <HI>speaks.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Be not dismay'd!—The Fairy of the Well salutes thee!—The water which I bring will not only be a present gratifica∣tion; for it contains a fortifying quality, and will be no small assistance in counter∣acting or resisting the plans and intrigues of your motley Rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rival!—What do you mean?—I thought I had been the only <HI>aerial merry Andrew.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you are mistaken.—But the Rival I mean is no Balloonist; but has been bred chiefly under ground by a rival of <HI>mine,</HI> a great Magician.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, ho! I understand you.—I find, then, we are to be, as the Scotchman says in the play, Twa to twa.—I doubt I shall make but a sorry second; for, in my last flight, I lost a weapon, with which I could have done wonders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, your magical weapon of wood!—The Magician Nordin has stolen it from your side, and presented it to his son, your rival, Mr. Orator Mum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Mum?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.—The tongue of this his fav'rite offspring is spell bound.—No one can free it but Hymen.—In plain English, he'll never be able to speak till he's marry'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he's wise he'll remain dumb all his life.—But, plague on him—tongue or no tongue—he has my sword.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not!—We shall be too hard for Master Nimble-heels and his grim-visag'd Papa.—To <HI>his activity</HI> you must oppose <HI>your wit;</HI> and tho' he, by a flourish of his sword, may be able to change places, persons, times, and seasons, I have a wand here by no means its inferior, and, in the moment of need, will be always at hand to relieve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Always at hand!—Why can't you as well give it me, and let me relieve myself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has no virtue in any hand but mine.—But, in lieu of it, take this ring.—When∣ever you touch it, you may appear to any
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
beholder whatever, or whomsoever you shall wish to be thought: nay, to different spectators at once, as many different beings.—By removing it from one finger to ano∣ther, it shall render your opponents deaf, dumb, or blind, as occasion shall require.—It will also enable you to imitate any voice, as well as assume whatever character you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assume whatever character I please!—I am told London swarms with people who can do that without a magic ring.—One part of its virtue I can easily conceive to be inestimable; for I am not to learn that great things may be done there by having what they call the command of a few voices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes;—You won't find liberty of speech the least of my favours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I know the first men in the king∣dom are speech-makers, and practise their trade not only all day, but sometimes all night too. But, however fond I may be of the speaking Harlequins, my strong at∣tachment is to my brethren of the <HI>sword!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you have been in London be∣fore.—Then you admire the English?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARLEQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admire them!—Who does not?—An Englishman takes to fighting as a New∣foundland
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
dog takes to the water.—Your true British Harlequin leaps at a breach made by a cannon ball as eagerly as a hun∣ter leaps at a hedge.—Liberty is his Co∣lombine! the goddess of his idolatry!—For her he dares the most imminent dan∣ger; and Courage is the magic sword with which he is endow'd to conquer every diffi∣culty.—So, my dear, dear little Fairy, take t'other dip in the well, and follow me—for, I say—Hey, for London.</P>

In the mean time, <HI>Mr. Dumb▪</HI> and his <HI>Intended</HI> will find work for their and your pursuers, who shall, for a time, be as dumb as themselves.—They approach—begone.</P>

<STAGE>As <HI>Harlequin Lack</HI> descends, <HI>Nordin</HI> ap∣pears, and speaks</STAGE>
<P>My curses follow thee! perverted boy! who, spite of admonition and entreaty, canst prefer love to duty, and pleasure to revenge. May thy joys be transient as my spells have been feeble! May the speech thou'rt about to acquire, be ever employed in re∣proaches and revilings; and trebly unpro∣pitious be those revels, which I must nei∣ther partake of nor behold.</P>
