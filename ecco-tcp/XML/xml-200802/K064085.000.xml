<HEAD>THE LIFE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Was born of reputable parents in the city of Canterbury, where my father, living at the sign of the Blue anchor, dealt in slops. He had but two children, a daughter and myself, and having given me a good school education, at the age of sixteen he bound me apprentice to Mr. George Roberts, an Attorney in our town, with whom I stayed four years and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee quarters to his great content and my own satisfaction. So that had we been together till my time was up, I have great reason to believe he would have taken me into partnership; but, God's will be done, my unfortunate stars decreed otherwise.</P>
<P>My sister being come to woman's estate, had now been married something more than a twelve-month to one Sawyer, a seafaring man, who having got considerable prizes, my father also giving him 200l. with my sister, quitted his profession and set up a public house within three miles of the place of his nativity, which was Deal, in the county of Kent.</P>
<P>I had frequent invitations to go and pass a short time with them; and in the autumn of the year 1709, having obtained my master's consent for that purpose, I left the city of Canterbury on foot, the 17th day of September.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3"/>Through some unavoidable delays on the road, the evening was considerable advanced before I reached Deal; and so tired was I, being unus'd to that way of travelling, that, had my life depended on it, I could not get as far as my sister's that night, she living, as I have already said three mile beyond the place. At this time there were many of her Majesty Queen Anne's ships lying in the har∣bour, for the English were then at war with the French and Spaniards: besides which, I found this was the day for holding the yearly fair, so that the town was filled to that degree, that a bed was not to be got for love or money. I went seeking a lodg∣ing from house to house, to no purpose, till, being quite spent, I returned to the public house where I had first made enquiry, desiring leave to sit by their kitchen fire, and rest myself till morning.</P>
<P>The publican and his wife happened to be ac∣quainted with my brother and sister, and finding by my discourse, that I was a relation of theirs and going to visit them, the Landlady presently said she would endeavour to get a bed; and going out of the kitchen she quickly after called me into a par∣lour, that led from it. Here I saw sitting by the fire-side a middle aged man in a night gown and cap, who was rekoning money at a table. "Un∣cle," said the woman, as soon as I entered, "this is a brother of our friend Mrs Sawyer; he cannot get a bed any where, and is tired after a long journey. You are the only, one that lies in this house alone, will you give him part of yours? To this the man, answered, that she knew he had been out of order that he was blooded that day, and consequently a bedfellow could not be very agreeable; "however, said he, rather then the young man shall set up, he
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
is welcome to sleep with me. After this we set a while together, when having put his money in a canvas bag, into the pocket of his night gown, he took the candle and I followed him up to bed.</P>
<P>How long I slept, I cannot exactly determine, but I conjecture it was about three o'clock i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the morning when I awakened with a violent cholic. I found my Chum awake as well as myself; he asked me what was the matter; I informed him, and at the same time begged he would direct me to the necessary. He told me, when I was down stairs, I must turn on my right hand, and go strait into the garden, at the end of which it was, just over the sea, but, adds he, you may possibly find some dif∣ficulty in opening the door, the string being broke which pulls up the latch. I will give you a penknife which you may open it with thro' a chink in the boards. So saying, he put his hand into his waist∣coat pocket, which lay on him on the bed, and gave me a middling sized penknife.</P>
<P>I hurried on a few of my cloaths, and went down stairs; but I must observe to you, that unclasping the penknife to open the door of the necessary, ac∣cording to his direction, a piece of money which stuck between the blade and the groove in the han∣dle fell into my hand: I did not examine what it was, nor Indeed could I well see, there being but a very faint moon light, so I put them together care∣lessly in my pocket.</P>
<P>I apprehend I staid in the garden pretty near a quarter of an hour. When I returned to the cham∣ber, I was surprized to find my bedfellow gone: I called several times but receiving no answer, I went to bed, and again fell asleep.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>About six o'clock I arose, nobody yet being up in the house. The gentleman was not yet returned to bed, or, if he was, had again left it. I drest myself with what haste I could, being impatient to see my sister, and the reckoning being paid over night, I let myself out at the street door.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with a relation of the kind∣ness with which my sister and her husband received me. We breakfasted together, and I believe it might be about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, when standing at the door my brother in law be∣ing by my side, we saw three horsemen galloping towards us. As soon as they came up to the house, they stopt and one of them lighting, suddenly sei∣zed me by the collar, crying, You are King's pri∣soner. I desired to know my crime. He said I should know that as soon as I came to Deal, where I must immediately go with them. One of them then told my brother that the night before I had committed a murder and robbery.</P>
<P>Resistance would have proved as vain as my tears and protestations of my innocence. In a word, a warrant was produced, and I was carried back to Deal attended by the three men; my brother with another friend accompanying us, who knew not what to say for, nor how to comfort me.</P>
<P>Being arrived in town I was immediately hurried to the house where I had slept the proceeding night the master of which was one of the three men that came to apprehend me, though in my first hurry I did not recollect him. We were met at the door by a crowd of people, every one crying, Which is he? which is he? As soon as I entered, I was accested by the publican's wife in tears, O! cursed wretch, what hast thou done? thou hast murdered and rob∣bed
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
my poor dear uncle, and all through me who put thee to lie with him. But where hast thou hid his money and what hast thou done with his body? Thou shall be hanged on a gallows as high as a may pole. My brother begged her to be pacified, and I was taken into a private room. They then began to question me as the woman had done, about where I had put the money, and how I had dispo∣sed of the body. I asked them what money, and whose body they meant. They then said I had killed the person I had lain with the proceeding night, for the sake of a large sum I had seen with him. I fell down of upon my knees, calling God to witness, I knew nothing of what they accused me, Then somebody cried, Carry him up stairs, and I was brought into the chamber where I had slept. Here the man of the house went to the bed, and turning down the cloaths, shewed the sheets, pillow and bolster dyed in blood. He asked me did I know any thing of that? I declared to God I did not. Says a person in the room, Young man some∣thing very odd must have past here last night, for lying in the next chamber, I heard groanings, and going up and down stairs more than once or twice, I then told them the circumstance of my illness, and that I had been up and down myself, with all that passed between my bedfellow and me. Some∣body proposed to search me; several began to turn my pockets inside out, and from my waistcoat tumbled the penknife and the piece of money I have already mentioned, and I had entirely forgot. Upon seeing these the woman immediately scream∣ed out, O God! there's my uncle's penknife! then taking up the money, and calling the people about her, Here, said she, is what puts the villain's guilt
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
beyond a doubt, I can swear to this William and Mary's guinea, my uncle has long had it by way of pocket piece, and engraved the first letters of his name upon it. She then began to cry afresh, while I could do nothing but continue to call hea∣ven to witness that I was as innocent as the child unborn. The constable who had heard me mention the having gone down into the garden, told the people I must have thrown the body down the ne∣cessary, and going thither, Here, said he, after having cut the throat, he has let the body down into the sea. This every body immediately assen∣ted to. Then, (said the master of the house) it is in vain to look for the body any further, for there was a spring tide last night which has carried it off.</P>
<P>The consequence of these proceedings was an immediate examination before a justice of peace; after which I suffered a long and rigorous imprison∣ment in the county town of Maidstone. For some time, my father, my master and my relations were inclined to think me innocent, because I declared I was so, as well I might, and in compliance with my earnest request, an advertisement was published in the London Gazette, representing my deplorable circumstances, and offering a reward to any person who could give tidings of Mr. Richard Collings, (the man I was supposed to have murdered) either alive or dead. No information, however, of any kind came to hand, at the assizes therefore, I was brought up to my trial, and circumstances appearing strong against me, I received sentence to be carried in a cart the Wednesday fortnight following to the town of Deal, and there to be hanged before the Inn-keeper's door where I had committed the mur∣der; after which I was to be hung in chains within a stone's throw of my brother's house.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8"/>Nothing could have supported me under this dreadful condemnation, but a consciousness of my not being guilty of the crime for which I was to suffer. My friends now began to consider my de∣clarations of my innocence, as persisting in falshood to the per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition of my soul; many of them discon∣tinued their enquiries after me, and those few who still came to visit me, only came to urge me to con∣fession, but I was resolved I would never die with a lie of that kind in my mouth.</P>
<P>The Monday was now arrived before the fatal day, when an end was to be put to my miseries▪ I was called down into the court of the prison, but I own I was not a little shocked, when I found it was to be taken measure of for my irons in which I was to be hung after execution. A fellow prisoner ap∣peared before me in the same woful plight, (he had robbed the mail) and the Smith was measuring him when I came down; while tha Goaler, with as much calmness as if he had been ordering a pair of stays for his daughter, was giving directions in what manner the irons should be made, so as to support the man who was remarkably heavy and corpulent.</P>
<P>Between this and the day of execution, I spent my time alone in prayer and meditation.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>At length Wednesday morning came, and about three o'clock I was put in a cart, but sure such a day of wind, rain and thunder, never blew out of the heavens, and when we arrived at Deal, it became so violent, that the Sheriff and his Officers, could scarce sit their horses: for my own part, I was insen∣sible to every object about me: I therefore heard the Sheriff whisper the Executioner to make what dispatch he could, without the least emotion, and suffered him to tuck me up like a log of wood, un∣conscious of what he was doing.</P>
<P>I can give no account of what I felt when hang∣ing, only remember, after being turned off, some∣thing appeared about me like a blaze of fire, nor do I know how long I hung, no doubt the violence of the weather favoured me greatly in that circum∣stance. What I am now going to tell you, I learned from my brother, which was, that having hung half an hour, the Sheriff's officers all went off, and I was cut down by the Executioner; but when he came to put the irons upon me, it was found that the irons of the other man which were too large for me, had been sent instead of mine: this they reme∣died by stuffing rags between my body and the hoops, after which I was taken to the place appointed and hung on a gibbet which was ready prepared.</P>
<P>The cloth over my face being slightly tied, was soon detached by the wind, and probably its blow∣ing on my face expedited my recovery, certain it is, that in this situation I came to myself.</P>
<P>The gibbet was placed at one corner of a field, where my sister's cows ran, and about this time a lad came to drive them home for evening milking, The creatures which were feeding almost under me, brought him near the gibbet; and in the very mo∣ment
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
he looked up, saw me open my eyes and move my under jaw. He immediately ran home to in∣form the people at his master's. At first they made some difficulty to believe his story, at length, my brother come out, and by the time he got to the field, I was so much alive, that my groans were very audible.</P>
<P>In their confusion, the first thing they thought of was a ladder One of my brother's men mounted and putting his hand to my stomach felt my heart beating strongly. But it was found impossible to de∣tach me from the gibbet, without cutting it down. A saw was got for that purpose, and in less than half an hour, having freed me from my irons, they got me blooded and put in a warm bed.</P>
<P>It is amazing, that tho' above eight persons was entrusted with this transaction, and I remained three days in the place after it happened, not one betrayed the secret. Early next morning it was known the gibbet was cut down, and it occurred to every body that it was done by my relations, to put a veil over their shame, by burying the body, but when my brother was summoned to the Mayor's house, in order to be questioned, and he denied knowing any thing of the matter, little more stir was made about it, beeause he was respected by all the neighbouring gentlemen, and in some measure, because I persisted in being innocent of the fact for which I suffered.</P>
<P>Thus was I delivered from an ignominious death but how was I to dispose of my life now I had re∣gained it. To stay in England was impossible, with∣out exposing myself to the terrors of the law. In this dilemna a fortunate circumstance occurred. There had lain at my brother's house, some of the principal Officers of a privateer that was preparing
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
for a cruize, and just then ready to sail. The cap∣tain offered to take me aboard with him, and proper necessaries being provided for me, my sister giving me ten guineas in my pocket, recommended me to the protection of God and the worthy Commander, who received me in the light of his Clerk, and a sort of Under-assistant to his Purser.</P>
<P>We had been six months out upon our cruize, having had but indifferent success, when being on the coast of Florida, then in the hands of the Spa∣niards, we fell in with a squadron of their men of war; and being consequently taken without striking a stroke, were all brought prisoners into the harbour of St. Helen's. I was really tired of my life, and should have been glad to have ended it in the dun∣geon, where, with forty others of my countrymen, the enemy had put me; but after three years con∣finement, we were let out, in order to be put on board transports, to be conveyed to Pennsylvania, and from thence to England. This was a disagree∣able sentence to me, taking it for granted, that a return home would be a return to the gallows. Be∣ing therefore, a tolerable master of the Spanish language, I solicited to be left behind; which favour I obtained, by means of the master of the prison and he not only took me into his house, as soon as my countrymen were gone, but, in a short time, procured me a small salary from the Governor, for being his Deputy.</P>
<P>Indeed, at this particular time the office was by no means agreeable. The coast had been long in∣fested with pirates, the most desperate gang of villains that can be imagined; and scarce a month passed, but one or other of their vessels fell into the Governor's hands, and the crew as constantly was
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
put under my care. Once I very narrowly escaped being knocked on the head by one of the ruffians, and having the keys took from me: Another time I was shot at. It is true, in both cases the persons suffered for their attempt, and in the last, I thought a little too cruelly; for the person that let off the carabine, was not only put to the torture to confess his accomplices, but af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rwards broke on the wheel where he was left to expire, the most shocking spec∣tacle I ever beheld.</P>
<P>I had been in my office about three months, when a ship arrived from Port Royal, another Spanish settlement on the coast, and nine English prisoners on board. I was standing in the street as they were coming up from the port, to the Governor's house. I thought something struck me, in the face of one of the prisoners, that I had before been acquainted with. I could not then stop them for us to speak together; but in about an hour after, they were all brought to the prison, there to be lodged till the Governor signified his further pleasure.</P>
<P>As soon as the poor creatures found I was an Eng∣lishman, they were extremely happy, even in their distressed situation, though indeed they were treated with lenity enough, and only sent to the prison till a lodging could be provided for them, they having been in the course of the War, made prisoners as well as myself, and then on their return home. I now had an opportunity of taking notice of the man whose face I thought I knew, and I was more and more confirmed that I was not mistaken. And I verily thought, that this was the man, for whose supposed murder I suffered so much in England, and the thought being strong in my head, I could not sleep all night.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13"/>The morning after their arrival, I told them, that if any of them had a mind to go about the town I would procure them permission, and go with them. This man said he would go, and it was as I wished. Three other prisoners that went along with us, walked a little in advance. I then took the opportunity, and looking in his face, Sir, said I, was you ever at Deal? I believe, he, at that instant had some recollection of me; for, putting his hand on my shoulder, tears burst into his eyes. Sir, said I, if you are the man I take you for, you here see before you one of the most unfortunate of human kind; Sir, is your name Richard Collins? He re∣plied, Yes. Then cried I, I was hanged and gib∣beted upon your account in England.</P>
<P>After our first salutation and mutual surprize in meeting being over, he made me give him a cir∣cumstantial detail of every thing that happened to me in England, from the moment we parted. I never see any man express such concern as he did, while I was pursuing my melancholy adventures; but, when I came to the circumstance of my being hanged, and afterwards hung in chains, I could hardly prevail upon him to believe my relation, till backed by the most solemn asseverations, pronoun∣ced in the most serious manner. When I had done, Well, said he, young man, (for I was then but in my 25th year, Mr. Collins might be about three and forty) if you have sustained misfortunes on my account, do not imagine (though I cannot lay them at your door) that I have been without my sufferings. God knows my heart, I am most ex∣ceedingly sorry for the injustice that has been done you; but the ways of providence are unsearchable. He then informed me by what accident all my troubles had been brought about.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>When you left me in bed, said he, having at first waked with an oppression I could not account for, I found myself exceedingly sick and weak, I groan∣ed and sighed, and thought myself going to die, when, accidentally putting my hand to my left arm, in which I had been blooded the morning before, I found my shirt wet, and in short, that the band∣age having slipped, the orifice was again opened, and a great flux of blood ensued. This immediately accounted for the condition I found myself in. I thought however, I would not disturb the family, which had gone to bed very late, I therefore mus∣tered all my strength and got up, with my night-gown loose about me, in order to go to a neigh∣bouring barber, who had bled me, and have him to tie up my arm. He lived directly opposite to our house: but when I got in the street, and crossed the way, in order to knock at his door, a band of men armed with cutlasses and hangers, came and siezed me, and hurried me to the beach. I begged and prayed, but they soon silenced my cries, by clapping a gag in my mouth. At first, I took them for a press gang, though I soon found they were a gang of ruffians belonging to a privateer, aboard which they immediately brought me. But before I got thither, loss of blood occasioned me to faint away. The surgeon of the ship, I suppose, tied up my arm; for when my senses returned. I found myself in a hammock, and somebody feeling my pulse. The vessel being then under way, I asked where I was? They said I was safe enough. I im∣mediately called for my night gown, it was brought me, but of a considerable sum of money that was in the pocket of it, I could get no account. I com∣plained to the captain of the violence that had been
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
done me, and of the robbery his men had commit∣ted, but he laughed at me, and said I should soon have prize money enough to make me amends, so I was obliged to submit; and for three months they forced me to work before the mast. At last we met the same fate that you did, and by adventures pa∣rallel to your own, you see me here on my return to our native country, and if you will accompany me, I shall think myself happy.</P>
<P>There was nothing to prevent my going to Eng∣land, and the ship being to sail in ten days, in it Mr. Collins and I determined to embark. I told my master my resolution, he did not disuade me from it, because it gave him the opportunity of getting the office I held to a kinsman of his, to whom that very day I delivered up my trust. And here provi∣dence was no less remarkable to me than in other particulars of my life, for that night the pirates siezed on the young man, while locking up the wards, took the keys from him, and left him for dead, and before the alarm could be given, five of them made their escape, by means of piratical boats that kept hovering about the coast.</P>
<P>On the 18th of November, 1712, having made all my little preparations, I sent my trunk aboard the Nostra Senora, Michael Deronza, master. The vessel was to sail that evening, and about seven o'clock being sitting with Signor Gaspar, my master a lad came up and said the boat had been waiting for me and that Mr. Collins was on board. I ran into the house for a small bundle and taking leave of the family, made what haste I could to the quay but found the boat had put off, and left word I should overtake them at a little bay. I ran along the shore, and imagined I had a sight of the boat, and
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
hallooed as loud as I could; they answered and put about to take me in: but we had scarce got fifty yards from land, when, on looking for Mr. Collins, I missed him; and then I found that instead of get∣ting aboard my own boat, which I could see a con∣siderable way a-head, I had got into a boat belong∣ing to the pirates. I attempted to leap overboard, but was prevented by one of the crew, who gave me a stroke on the head, which laid me senseless; and I found afterwards they mistook me for one of their men, who had been sent to purchase something in the town.</P>
<P>With these Pirates I continued some years, till they, upon a dispute, threw me overboard. I was saved by a boat belonging to a Spanish ship. After various misfortunes, our ship was taken by an Al∣gerine Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, the greatest part of the crew was kil∣led, and the rest taken prisoners, among which I was one, having lost one of my legs in the action.</P>
<P>After this, I passed a long and painful slavery in Algiers, till with other English captives, I was re∣leased by agreement between the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of Algiers, and his Brittanick Majesty. In the year 1730. I re∣turned to England. The first thing I did was to enquire after my relations, but all those nearest to me were dead; and I found Mr. Collins had never returned home, so I suppose he died in his passage. Though not an old man, I was so enfeebled by hardships, that I was unable to work; and being without any manner of support, I could think of no way of getting my living but by begging.</P>
