<HEAD>A VINDICATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>NDER Pretence of some A∣buses committed by Mathe∣maticians, in Virtue of the Au∣thority they derive from their Profession, the Author of the <HI>Minute Philosopher,</HI> in a <HI>Libel</HI> called the <HI>Ana∣lyst,</HI> has declared 'em Infidels, Makers of Infidels, and Seducers of Mankind in Matters of the highest Concernment: This he professes to have done, not from any real Knowlege of his own, but from the credible Information of others; but he has neither produc'd his Informers, nor proved the Accusation in any one Instance; and therefore it is Defamatory.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
But they assume an Authority, it seems, in Things foreign to their Profession, and un∣dertake to decide in Matters whereof their Knowledge can by no Means qualify them to be competent Judges: And as this Prac∣tice, if not prevented, may be of dan∣gerous Consequence; he has undertaken to enquire into the Object, Principles and Method of Demonstration, admitted by the Mathematicians of the present Age, with the same Freedom, he says, they pre∣sume to treat the Principles and Myste∣ries of Religion, to the end, that all Men may see what Right they have to lead or what Encouragement others have to fol∣low them.</P>
<P>And whereas Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has pre∣sum'd to interpose in <HI>Prophecies</HI> and <HI>Re∣velations,</HI> and to decide in religious Af∣fairs, it has been thought proper to begin with his Method of <HI>Fluxions,</HI> and to try what cou'd be done with that Me∣thod, with the Inventor himself, and with his Followers: And what has been done with 'em every intelligent Reader is able to judge.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
If this Writer may be credited, the Ob∣jects about which the Method of <HI>Fluxi∣ons</HI> is conversant, are difficult to conceive or imagine distinctly; the Notions are most abstracted incomprehensible Meta∣physics, not to be admitted for the Foun∣dations of clear and accurate Science; the Principles are obscure, repugnant, pre∣carious; the Arguments admitted in Proofs, are fallacious, indirect, illogical; and the Inferences and Conclusions not more just, than the Conceptions of the Principles are clear.</P>
<P>How far the Credulous and Injudicious may become infected by this uncommon Way of treating Mathematics and Mathe∣maticians, is not easy to foresee, and there∣fore it will be necessary to give a short Ac∣count of the Nature of <HI>Fluxions,</HI> and of the Objects about which the Method is conversant; and when it shall be made apparent, that this Author has not under∣stood the Metaphysics he wou'd refute; it will not be difficult to defend the Prin∣ciples and their Demonstrations, from any Imputations of Fallacy or Repugnancy,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
which have yet been pointed at by him or any other Writer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">In the Method of <HI>Fluxions,</HI> Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> considers mathematical Quantities, not as composed of the smallest Parts, but as described or ge∣nerated by continual Motion. Lines are described, and by being described are generated, not by an Apposition of Parts, but by the Motion of Points; Surfaces by the Motion of Lines, So∣lids by the Motion of Surfaces, Angles by the Rotation of their Sides, Times by a continual Flux, and so of the rest. And by considering that Quantities, in∣creasing in equal Times, and generated by increasing, become greater or less, according as the Velocity with which they increase, and are generated, is greater or less, he found a Method of deter∣mining the Quantities themselves from the Velocities of the Motions, or of the Increments, with which they are generated; calling the Velocities of the Motions or of the Increments <HI>Fluxions,</HI> and the Quantities generated <HI>Fluents.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
The momentaneous Increments or De∣crements of flowing Quantities, he else∣where calls by the Name of <HI>Moments,</HI> and considers the Increments as added or affirmative Moments, and the Decrements as subducted or negative ones: By Mo∣ments we may understand the nascent or evanescent Elements or Principles of finite Magnitudes, but not Particles of any de∣terminate Size, or Increments actually generated; for all such are Quantities themselves, generated of Moments.</P>
<P>The Magnitudes of the momentaneous Increments or Decrements of Quantities are not regarded in the Method of Fluxions, but their first or last Proportions only; that is, the Proportions with which they begin or cease to exist: These are not their Proportions immediately before or after they begin or cease to exist, but the Proportions with which they begin to exist, or with which they vanish. If the Lines AC and BE are supposed to be ge∣nerated in the same Time, by the Mo∣tions of the Points A and B, to C and E; and if by continuing the Motions of
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
those Points to D and F, they generate DC and EF, synchronal Increments of AC and BE; <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>it is evident that the Points D and F may flow back in the same Time to C and E, and by flowing back perpetual∣ly lessen the Magnitudes of those Increments till at last they vanish together, when the Points D and F come to coincide with C and E: Now the ultimate Ratio of those Increments is that Ratio with which they vanish and become nothing; or the Ratio with which they cease to be: And the first Ratio of them is the Ratio with which they begin to exist, at the very first setting out of the Points from C and E towards D and F.</P>
<P>Hence, if the describing Points move back to C and E, in the same Time wherein by moving forward they gene∣rated the Increments DC and EF; and in returning have every where the same Velocities, at certain Distances from C and E, which they had at those Distances
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
in going forward; the last and first Ratios of the Increments will be equal, or they will vanish, and become nothing, with the very same Ratio with which they began to exist.</P>
<P>Hence likewise it appears, that to ob∣tain the last Ratio of synchronal Incre∣ments, the Magnitudes of those Incre∣crements must be infinitely diminish'd. For their last Ratio is the Ratio with which they vanish or become nothing: But they cannot vanish or become nothing, by a constant Diminution, till they are infinite∣ly diminish'd; for without an infinite Diminution they must have finite or as∣signable Magnitudes, and while they have finite or assignable Magnitudes they cannot vanish.</P>
<P>The ultimate Ratios with which syn∣chronal Increments of Quantities vanish, are not the Ratios of finite Increments, but Limits which the Ratios of those In∣crements attain, by having their Magni∣tudes infinitely diminish'd: The Proporti∣ons of Quantities which grow less and
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
less by Motion, and at last cease to be, will continually change, and become dif∣ferent in every successive Diminution of the Quantities themselves: And there are certain determinate Limits to which all such Proportions perpetually tend, and approach nearer than by any assignable Difference, but never attain before the Quantities themselves are infinitely di∣minish'd; or till the instant they evanesce and become nothing. These Limits are the last Ratios with which such Quan∣tities or their Increments vanish or cease to exist; and they are the first Ratios with which Quantities or the Increments of Quantities, begin to arise or come into being.</P>
<P>Quantities, and the Ratios of Quanti∣ties, which constantly tend to an Equali∣ty, by a Diminution of their Difference, and before the End of some finite Time approach nearer to an Equality than by any assignable Difference, at last become equal. For they become equal when the Difference between them vanishes or becomes nothing; and it will
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
vanish or become nothing by being in∣finitely diminished: If the Quantities AC and AD perpetually tend to an Equality, either by the Motion of the Point D to C, or by that of C to D; they will be∣come equal, and their Ratio a Ratio of Equality, when their Difference CD, by a constant Diminution, vanishes and be∣comes nothing, which it will do under a Coincidence of the two Points in C or D; and then either AD becomes AC, and so AD / AC or AC / AC is a Ratio of Equa∣lity, or else AC becomes AD and AD / AC becomes AD / AD; which is also a Ratio of Equality.</P>
<P><HI>The Fluxions of Quantities are very nearly as the Increments of their Fluents generated in the least equal Particles of Time:</HI> If CD and EF be Increments of the Fluents AC and BE, described in the least equal Particles of Time; the Fluxions in the Points C and E will be nearly as the Increments DC and EF. For from the exceeding Smallness of the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Times it is evident that the Points D and F, must be extreamly near to C and E; and by Consequence however the Velo∣cities are accelerated or retarded thro' the Spaces CD and EF, they will be very nearly the same in D and F as they were in C and E: But Velocities which are ve∣ry nearly uniform, will be very nearly proportional to the Spaces described by them in equal Times; and therefore the Velocities in the Points C and E, which are the Fluxions of AC and BE in those Points, will be very nearly as the Incre∣ments DC and EF, described in the least equal Particles of Time.</P>
<P><HI>The Fluxions of Quantities are accu∣rately in the first or last Proportions of their nascent or evanescent Increments:</HI> Thus the Fluxions of AC and BE, in the Points C and E, are in the first or last Ratio of the Increments CD and EF. For the first or last Ratio of the Incre∣ments CD and EF, is the Ratio with which they begin or cease to exist: But the Ratio with which they begin or cease to exist, is the same with the Ratio of the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Velocities in C and E, which are the Fluxions in those Points; and consequent∣ly the Fluxions in C and E are in the first or last Ratio of the Increments CD and EF.</P>
<P>The Fluxions of Quantities are only the Velocities with which those Quanti∣ties begin to be generated or increased; or the Velocities with which the gene∣rating Quantities begin to set out; not the Velocities they have after moving thro' Spaces of any finite or assignable Mag∣nitudes: And therefore if two mathema∣tical Quantities set out together, and be∣gin to move with Velocities which are as <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> they must begin to describe Spaces in the same Proportion with <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>; or the Proportion with which the Spaces begin to exist or to be described, must be the same with that which the Velocities have at the very Beginning of the Motion. For in the very Beginning of the Motion there is neither any Change of Velocity from Acceleration or Retar∣dation, nor Difference of Time.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Hence it appears that to obtain the Ratios of Fluxions, the corresponding synchronal or isochronal Increments must be lessened <HI>in infinitum.</HI> For the Mag∣nitudes of synchronal or isochronal In∣crements must be infinitely diminished and become evanescent, in order to obtain their first or last Ratios, to which Ratios the Ratios of their corresponding Fluxions are equal.</P>
<P>Hence likewise it appears that the Mo∣ments of like Quantities, compared with each other, are in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities, taken when first they begin to move, and of the Velocities with which they set out: Or in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities when first they begin to move, and of the first Ratios of their synchronal nascent Incre∣ments. The Moments of Lines there∣fore are as the generating Points and as the Velocities with which they begin to move taken together: The Moments of Surfaces, which become greater or less by carrying of moveable Lines along im∣moveable
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
ones, are in Ratios compound∣ed of the Ratios of the moving Lines, and of their first Velocities, or first Ra∣tios of the Increments which begin to rise with those Velocities: And the whole Motion by which Squares or Rectangles begin to alter, either from an Augmenta∣tion or Diminution of their Sides, is the Sum of the nascent Motions of those Sides, or the Sum of the nascent Incre∣ments arising with the first Motions of the Sides: For the Proportion of nascent Increments is the same with that of the Motions with which they begin to be generated.</P>
<P>From this short Account of the Na∣ture of Fluxions, compared with the <HI>Ana∣lyst,</HI> it appears that the Author of that Paper is greatly mistaken in the Object of 'em; and he is also mistaken in the Principles: For he thinks the Moment or Fluxion of a Rectangle, contain'd un∣der two indeterminate Quantities A and B, from whence are deduc'd Rules for obtaining the Moments or Fluxions of all other Products or Powers whatever, is
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
no where truly determin'd by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton:</HI> But he ought to have read Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> with more Care and Attention than he seems to have done, before he set up to decide and dictate in Matters of this Nature; and he wou'd do well yet to read him with Attention.</P>
<P>If any Rectangle CK be increased from an Augmentation of its Sides by Motion, so as that DK becomes LG in the same Time that DC becomes EG; the Moment of that Rectangle is the Sum of the Rectangles of DK into the Mo∣ment of DC, and of DC into the Mo∣ment of DK: That is, putting A and B for the Sides DK and DC, and <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for their respective Moments, the Mo∣ment of the Rectangle AB will be A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>For the Gnomon CGK in the Instant it begins or ceases to exist is the Mo∣ment of the Rectangle CK: But the first or last Ratio of that Gnomon to the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC is a Ratio of Equality: For the Difference
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
between the Gnomon and the Sum of those Rectangles perpetually lessens, by a constant Diminution of the Increments FD and DH, or by an Ap∣proach of the Points F and H towards D; <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>as will be manifest on taking the Ratio between the said Gnomon and the Sum of the Rectangles, at several Distances of the Points F and H from D: For what∣ever be the Magnitudes of <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> when F and H first begin to move back to∣wards D, the Gnomon CGK and Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC, will be as A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <HI>ba</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI>; when those Points, by moving towards D, have lessen'd the Increments of DK and DC to ½<HI>a</HI> and ½<HI>b,</HI> the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles will be as A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + ½<HI>ba</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI>; when they have lessen'd the Increments to ¼<HI>a</HI> and ¼<HI>b,</HI> the Gno∣mon and Sum of the Rectangles will be
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
as A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + ¼<HI>ab</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI>; and as A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>ab</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a,</HI> when they have lessen'd those Increments to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>a</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>b</HI>: Hence it appears, that un∣der a constant Diminution of the Incre∣ments <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> by the Motion of the Points F and H towards D, the Gnomon CGK and the Sum of the Rectangles CF and DL, constantly tend to an Equali∣ty by a continual Diminution of their Difference FH, and that they become equal, and their Ratio becomes a Ratio of Equality, in the Instant that Difference vanishes and the Points F and H coincide with D; or in other Words the Gnomon and Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC be∣gin or cease to <HI>be</HI> under a Ratio of Equali∣ty: And therefore the Sum of those Rect∣angles, or A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a,</HI> is the Moment of AB.</P>
<P>Hence, the Gnomon CGK, or A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <HI>ab,</HI> found by taking the Difference between the Rectangles EL and CK, or by deducting the Rectangle AB from a Rectangle contain'd under the Sides A and B increased by their whole Incre∣ments, is not the Moment or Fluxion
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of the Rectangle AB, except in the ve∣ry Instant when it begins or ceases to exist: And this will also appear by con∣sidering it in another Light. For the Moment of the Rectangle CK, or the Motion with which it first begins to al∣ter, either by increasing or decreasing, is the Sum of the nascent Motions of its Sides; and the nascent Motions of its Sides, are measur'd by their respec∣tive Magnitudes in the very Instant they first begin to change, and by the Velo∣cities with which they begin to move taken together; and the Velocities with which the Sides begin to move being in the first Ratio of the momentaneous Spaces which arise with 'em; it follows that the Sum of the nascent Motions of the Sides, is the Sum of DK multiply'd into DH in its nascent State, and of CD multiply'd into DF in its nascent State: But DH and DF in their nascent States, are the Moments of DC and DK: And therefore the whole Moment of the Rectangle AB, is A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
In determining the Moments of Quan∣tities, Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> expresly tells us, that we are only to consider: the Ratios with which they begin or cease to exist; and to obtain those Ratios, it is not necessary that the insochronal In∣crements shou'd have finite Magnitudes. <Q REND="inline">Cave tamen intellexeris particulas finitas, <HI>says he,</HI> Particulae finitae non sunt Momenta, sed Quantitates ipsae ex Momentis genitae. Intelligenda sunt Principia jamjam nascentia finitarum Magnitudinum. Neque enim spectatur in hoc Lemmate mag∣nitudo Momentorum, sed prima na∣scentium proportio.</Q> And in another Place, <Q REND="inline">Fluxiones sunt quam proximè ut Fluentium Augmenta aequalibus Temporis particulis quam minimis genita, et, ut accurate loquar, sunt in primâ ratione Augmentorum na∣scentium; exponi autem possunt per lineas quascunque, quae sunt ipsis proportionales.</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline">Siquan∣do facili rerum conceptui consulens dixero Quantitates quam minimas, vel evanescentes, vel ultimas; cave
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
intelligas quantitates magnitudine determinatas. sed cogita semper di∣minuendas sine limite.</Q></P>
<P>From these Passages it appears, that the Gnomon CGK in its nascent or evanescent State only, or in the Instant it begins or ceases to exist, is the Moment or Fluxion of the Rectangle CK; and in a nascent or evanescent State, when on∣ly the Increments of Quantities become their Moments, its Ratio to A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a,</HI> which is the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC, is a Ratio of Equality. By di∣minishing the Magnitudes of <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> which are Increments of DK and DC, it is obvious that the Gnomon CGK di∣minishes faster in Proportion, than the Sum of the Rectangles FC and DL does; and by diminishing faster, it continually approaches to an Equality with that Sum, and attains the Equality only, when their Difference FH becomes evanescent, that is, when the Points F and H come to coincide with D; so that here is no Ar∣tifice or false Reasoning used, to get rid of HF, or <HI>ab,</HI> that Term having no
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Existence at the very Beginning of the Motion, or in the nascent State of the Augments.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> had so expresly told us what he meant by Moments and Fluxions, and by nascent or evanescent Quantities, one wou'd imagine it impos∣sible to have mistaken and misrepresented him in the Manner this Author has done. He seems indeed to have been lead, or rather to have been deceived, by an Opi∣nion that there can be no first or last Ratios of mathematical Quantities or of their isochronal Increments generated or destroy'd by Motion; imagining that no such Quantities, by any Division or Di∣minution whatever, can be exhausted or reduc'd to nothing: But if Lines, Sur∣faces and Solids can be generated or aug∣mented by the Motion of Points, Lines, and Surfaces, they may likewise be de∣stroy'd or diminish'd by the Motion of the same Points, Lines and Surfaces, in returning to the Places from whence they first set out. While a generating Quantity moves back thro' the same
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Space it before described in moving for∣ward, the Quantity generated, or its Augment, continually lessens; and by persevering in a State of decreasing, it must in some finite Time vanish and be∣come nothing; and therefore mathema∣tical Quantities, by a constant Diminu∣tion, may be reduc'd to nothing: And such as are thus generated or destroy'd in equal Times by Motion, or which a∣rise and vanish together, will arise or va∣nish under certain Ratios, which are their first or last Ratios; or the Ratios with which they begin or cease to be: But it may be necessary to persue this Case a little farther, and see whether Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Demonstration of it cannot be defended, and proved to be geometrical.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Suppose any Rectangle AB aug∣mented by continual Motion; and the momentaneous Increments of its Sides A and B to be denoted by <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>; the Moment of the generated Rect∣angle will be measured by A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
For when the Sides A and B want∣ed half of their Moments, the Rect∣angle was <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> or AB − ½A<HI>b</HI> − ½B<HI>a</HI> + ¼<HI>ab</HI>: And as soon as the Sides A and B are augmented by the other halves of their Moments, it be∣comes <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, or AB + ½A<HI>b</HI> + ½B<HI>a</HI> + ¼<HI>ab</HI>: From this Rectangle deduct the former, and there will re∣main A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI>: Therefore the Incre∣ment of the Rectangle AB, generated with <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> the whole Increments of the Sides, is A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, in determining the Moment of a Rectangle, there is nothing to be con∣sidered, when it first begins to be aug∣mented by the Motions of its Sides, but the Sides themselves and the Velocities with which they begin to move; or the Sides and the first Ratio of the Spaces described by them. And therefore the true Moment of the Rectangle AB, or the Law according to which it begins to be augmented, on the Principles of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> will only be the Sum of
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
the Rectangles A<HI>b</HI> and B<HI>a</HI>; for the Sides A and B begin to move with Ve∣locities which are as <HI>b</HI> and <HI>a</HI>: But this Moment A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a,</HI> is manifestly equal to the Difference between the Rectangles <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>; and therefore Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s determination of it is geometrical.</P>
<P>From the foregoing Principle so de∣monstrated, the general Rule for finding the Moment or Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity, is easily deduc'd: It is easy, from hence, to infer that the Moment or Fluxion of A<HI><SUP>n</SUP></HI> is as <HI>n</HI>A<HI><SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>, or that the Fluxion of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> is as <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>: But because this is also determined in a manner seemingly different, by Sir <HI>Isaac,</HI> in his Introduction to the <HI>Quadrature of Curves,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> ob∣serves, <Q REND="inline">That there seems to have been some inward Scruple or Consciousness of Defect in the foregoing Demon∣stration.</Q> And he repeats the same Reflection in another Place, adding with∣al, <Q REND="inline">That Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> was not enough pleased with any one Notion steadily
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
to adhere to it:</Q> But Reflections of this Nature deserve no Regard unless it be allowable, by way of Return, to ob∣serve that the Person who makes 'em has very often been guilty of like Prac∣tices himself.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his new <HI>Theory of Vision</HI>; his <HI>Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowlege</HI>; and some later Undertakings of equal Importance.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Proof given in the Introduction to the <HI>Quadratures,</HI> is said to be a most inconsistent way of arguing; as pro∣ceeding to a certain Point of the Demon∣stration upon Supposition of an Incre∣ment, and then in a fallacious Manner, shifting the Supposition to that of no In∣crement; and to shew the Inconsisteny with greater Force, a Lemma is pre∣mised by Way of Axiom; as if some ve∣ry obvious and natural Application of an apparent Truth, wou'd at once over∣turn the Whole of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Demon∣stration: But that Lemma, however true in it self, is no Way pertinent to the Case for which it was intended; and
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
therefore such Inferences as are made in Virtue of it, with relation to the Point in dispute, are illegitimate, and inconsistent with the Rules of true reasoning.</P>
<P>Nothing is more plain and obvious, than that Quantities which begin to exist together under certain Proportions, and with certain Velocities; may become evanescent and cease to exist, under the same Proportions and with the same Velo∣cities; and this is all Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> supposes in that Determination of the Fluxion of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI>; and it is not very obvious, that the Lemma which this Author has hit upon, is ap∣plicable to Cases of such a Nature.</P>
<P>That the Reader may see how strict∣ly Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> has kept to the same Principle in this Determination, how steadily he adheres to the same Method, and how ill the Author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> has proved his Imputations; it will be ne∣cessary to persue this Point, and consi∣der the Proof it self.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
<HI>Let it be required to find the Fluxi∣on of x<SUP>n</SUP>, supposing x to increase uni∣formly.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose <HI>x</HI> in any finite Particle of Time, to become greater than before, by a finite Increment, whose Magnitude is express'd by <HI>o.</HI> Then, in the same Time that <HI>x,</HI> by flowing becomes <HI>x</HI> + <HI>o,</HI> the <HI>n</HI> Power of <HI>x</HI> will become <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> + <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> Consequently the Magnitudes of the synchronal Increments of <HI>x</HI> and of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> are to each other as 1 and <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>ox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> Now, let the Increments decrease by flowing back, in like Manner as they increas'd before by flowing forward, and continually grow less and less till they vanish; and their ultimate Ratio, that is, the Ratio with which they become evanescent, will be express'd by 1 and <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>: But the Fluxi∣ons of Quantities are in the last Ratio of their evanescent Arguments; and by Consequence the Fluxion of <HI>x</HI> is to that of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> as 1 to <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>.</P>

In this Computation, Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> endea∣vours to collect the Proportion with which the isochronal Increments of <HI>x</HI> and of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> begin or cease to exist: Their Proportion obtain'd on Supposition that <HI>o</HI> is something, is allowed to be the same with that of 1 and <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>ox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> And it must be acknowleg'd that this Ratio has a Limite dependent on the Magnitude of <HI>o,</HI> which Limite it cannot attain before the Increments are in∣finitely diminish'd and become evane∣scent; and when, by an infinite Diminu∣tion, they become evanescent, no other Terms of their Ratio will be af∣fected, so as to vanish with 'em, but such as are govern'd or regulated by them: In the Instant therefore that <HI>o</HI> va∣nishes, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>ox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all ensuing Terms of the Series absolutely vanish together; but the Terms 1 and <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> remain in∣variable under all possible Changes of the Increments, from any finite Degrees of Magnitude whatever, even till they be∣come
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
evanescent: They therefore express the last Ratio, under which the isochro∣nal Increments of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> vanish, or the Proportion of the Velocities with which those Increments cease to exist: Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> then rightly retain'd 'em for the Measures of the Ratio of the Fluxi∣ons of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> tho' got in Virtue of his first Supposition; and the Fallacy, the Inconsistency, lies on the Side of this Author; who wou'd have them re∣jected on the Authority of a Lemma not to the purpose.</P>
<P>To make this Point still more plain and obvious, I shall propose the reasoning in a stronger Light: It amounts there∣fore to this, or may in other Words, be thus expressed: If <HI>x</HI> be suppos'd to flow uniformly, the Fluxions of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> will be as 1 and <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>. For in the same Time that <HI>x</HI> by flowing, becomes <HI>x</HI> + <HI>o, x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> will become <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, which by the Method of infinite Series, is equal to <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> + <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−•</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> Conse∣quently
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
the Increments of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> ge∣nerated in the same Time, are <HI>o</HI> and <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> But the na∣scent or evanescent Increment of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> is as its Fluxion; and in either of these States the Ratio of <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> is a Ratio of Equality: For as the Magnitude of <HI>o</HI> becomes less and less, the Quantities <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> and <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> constantly tend to an Equali∣ty, by a continual Diminution of their Difference; and they become equal, and their Ratio becomes a Ratio of Equality, when their Difference vanishes; that is, in the Instant <HI>o</HI> becomes evanescent, or in the Instant that the Increment of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> first begins to exist: For as they vanish toge∣ther under a Ratio of Equality, so they begin to exist together under the same Ratio; and therefore in the nascent or evanescent State of <HI>o,</HI> the Fluxions of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> are as <HI>o</HI> and <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>, which are manifestly to each other as 1 and <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Hence it appears, that this Method of finding the Fluxion of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> upon a Sup∣position that <HI>x</HI> flows uniformly, is the very same with that of finding the Fluxi∣on of a Rectangle, as it is described in the second Book of the mathematical Prin∣ciples: For, as <HI>ab</HI> the Difference be∣tween A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <HI>ab</HI> and A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> grows less and less perpetually, by diminishing the synchronal Increments of the Sides of the Rectangle, and at last evanesces, and in the Instant of its Evanescence, the Gnomon A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <HI>ab</HI> becomes equal to the Sum of the Rectangles A<HI>b</HI> and B<HI>a</HI>; so <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Dif∣ference between <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> grows less and less per∣petually, by diminishing the Increment <HI>o,</HI> and at last evanesces, and in the In∣stant of its Evanescence <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becomes equal to <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>: And as the Gnomon A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a</HI> + <HI>ab</HI> is not the Moment or Fluxion of the Rectangle AB, but in the Instant of its
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
becoming equal to A<HI>b</HI> + B<HI>a,</HI> so <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP> + <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/><HI>o</HI><SUP>2</SUP><HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−2</SUP> + <HI>&amp;c..</HI> is not the Moment or Fluxion of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> but in the Instant of its becoming equal to <HI>nox<SUP>n</SUP></HI><SUP>−1</SUP>.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> therefore, is greatly mistaken, in thinking Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> found the Fluxion of <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP>,</HI> by a Method different from that he used in finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle, con∣tain'd under two flowing Quantities: He steadily adheres to one and the same Method; namely, that of taking the first or last Ratios of Quantities, or of their isochronal Increments, for the Mea∣sures of the Ratios of their Fluxions; and uses no illegitimate Artifice to ob∣tain these first or last Ratios; unless it be accounted illegitimate to suppose that mathematical Quantities can be gene∣rated and destroyed by Motion.</P>
<P>It is pretended, <Q REND="inline">That the Method for finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle of two flowing Quantities, as it is set forth in the <HI>Treatise of Quadra∣tures,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
differs from that found in the <HI>second Book of the Principles,</HI> and is in Effect the same with that used in the <HI>Calculus differentialis:</HI> For the supposing a Quantity infinitely di∣minish'd and therefore rejecting it, is in Effect the rejecting an Infinitesi∣mal.</Q> But if this Author deduces the Rule from the first Proposition in the <HI>Treatise of Quadratures,</HI> and considers it ever so little, he will find it the very same with that set down in the <HI>second Book of the Principles:</HI> And it is doubt∣less in Effect too the same with that used in the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> so far as dif∣ferent Methods <HI>can</HI> effect the same Thing, but no farther: For Quantities are not rejected in the Method of Fluxions, as in the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> on Ac∣count of their exceeding Smallness.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">But according to the received Prin∣ciples it is evident, says he, that no geometrical Quantity, by being infi∣nitely diminish'd can ever be exhaust∣ed or become nothing.</Q> Now, on the received Principles of Fluxions, this is
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
a direct Absurdity. For these Principles suppose that mathematical Quantities can be generated by Motion, which he has not yet thought proper to contradict; and consequently they may also by Mo∣tion be destroy'd: For Quantities, and the Augments of Quantities, which in some finite Time are produc'd by Mo∣tion, may perpetually grow less and less by reverting that Motion; and by con∣stantly growing less and less, they may come to be infinitely diminished, or to be less than any assignable Quantities; and from being less than any assignable Quantities, the Motion still persevering, they must at last vanish and become no∣thing; otherwise it might be contended that a Body setting out from any Place, and, in any finite Time, describing a cer∣tain length, cou'd never by moving back and returning in the same Line, arrive at the Place from whence it first set out.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then it appears, that the Method of Fluxions, as describ'd by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> in his Introduction to the <HI>Quadrature of Curves,</HI> and in the
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
<HI>second Book of his mathematical Prin∣ciples,</HI> is not that wretched un-scientifi∣cal Knack set forth in the <HI>Analyst</HI>; but a Method founded upon obvious, rational, accurate and demonstrative Principles: It likewise appears, that the Conclusions do not arise from illegitimate tentative Ways or Inductions, but follow from such Premises, and by such Arguments, as are most conformable to the Rules of Logic and right Reason: All the Skill and Dexterity therefore by this Author shewn, in the Investigation of contrary Errors correcting each other, are vain and impertinent. He has mistaken the Doctrine of Fluxions, and by not right∣ly distinguishing its Principles from those of the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> has imposed a false Measure of Moments upon his Readers, and arguing from that false Mea∣sure, has unjustly charg'd Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> with Errors arising from it; and, to mend the Matter, has instituted Computations to shew how those Errors redress one ano∣ther, and how Mathematicians by Means of Errors bring forth Truth and Science.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
The Dispute between the Followers of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>Analyst,</HI> is not about the Principles of the <HI>differential Calculus,</HI> but about those of Fluxions; and it is whether these Principles in themselves are clear or ob∣scure, and whether the Inferences from them are just or unjust, true or false∣scientific or otherwise: We are not con∣cerned about Infinitesimals or minute Dif∣ferences, but about the Ratios with which mathematical Quantities begin or cease to exist by Motion; and to consider the first or last Proportions of Quantities does not imply that such Quantities have any fi∣nite Magnitudes: They are not the Pro∣portions of first or last Quantities, but Li∣mits of Ratios; which Limits, the Ratios of Quantities attain <HI>only</HI> by an infinite Diminution of their Magnitudes, by which infinite Diminution of their Mag∣nitudes they become evanescent and cease to exist. If therefore Quantities may cease to exist by Motion, and if the Ratios with which they become evane∣scent be truly determin'd, it will follow that there are no Errors, how∣ever 
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
small, admitted in the Principles of Fluxions; and if no Errors be admitted in the Principles; there can be none in the Conclusions, nor any to be account∣ed for in the Arguments by which those Conclusions are deduc'd from their Pre∣mises: The Hints therefore, which this Author has condescended to give the Mathematicians for ascertaining the Truth of their Conclusions, by means of con∣trary Errors destroying each other, will probably be left to be further extended and apply'd by himself, to all the <HI>good Purposes</HI> he pleases to extend and apply them; as having more Leisure, and a Science more transcendental<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Philosophia prima,</HI> a certain transcendental Science superior to and more extensive than Mathematics, which, he says, it might behove our modern <HI>Analysts</HI> rather to learn than despise.</NOTE>, and per∣haps a much greater Curiosity for such Matters, than they have.</P>
<P>It has been observ'd before, that Fluxi∣ons may be expounded by any Lines which are proportional to them; and so the Analysis may be instituted, by con∣sidering
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
the mutual Relations or Propor∣tions of finite Quantities, as the Pro∣portions of Fluxions themselves. To this it is objected, <Q REND="inline">That if, in order to arrive at these finite Lines propor∣tional to Fluxions, there be certain Steps made use of which are obscure and in∣conceivable, it must be acknowleged, that the Proceeding is not clear, nor the Method scientific.</Q> But there may be many Steps obscure and incon∣ceivable to Persons, who are unacquaint∣ed with Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Method of first and last Ratios, with his Doctrine of Fluxions, and with his Principles of Moti∣on; and yet those Steps may appear very different to others who have duly consi∣der'd 'em: And therefore, till it be made apparent from geometrical Principles that the fluxional Triangle, which evanesces upon the returning of the Ordinate of any Curve to the Place from whence it first set out, cannot in its last Form, that is, in the Form it has at the Instant it becomes evanescent, be similar to a Triangle contain'd between the Tangent, the Absciss extended and the Ordinate of the
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
same Curve; or till it be proved that no Triangle, which is capable of becoming evanescent by a Diminution of its Sides from Motion, can be similar in its last Form to any plain Triangle whatsoever; we shall continue to expound Fluxions by such Right Lines as are proportional to them; and do assert, that the Proceeding is clear, and the Method scientific.</P>
