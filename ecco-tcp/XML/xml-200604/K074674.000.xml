<HEAD>PREFATORY ADDRESS
FROM THE
PUBLISHER.</HEAD>
<P>SOLICITOUS as the public are to have
a perfect copy of the most eloquent
speech that was ever delivered in Parlia∣ment,
their wishes must be in a great mea∣sure
disappointed from the very liberal de∣termination
of <HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> to give no
kind of assistance in reporting it publickly;
a determination that does as much honour
to his humanity, as his Oration does to his
abilities.—Having called forth his won∣derful
talents whilst in the double office of
a senator, and an accuser of the great de∣linquent,
he now sinks the apparent, tho' just
severity of the <HI>public character,</HI> in the hu∣mane
sensibility of the <HI>private individual;</HI>
and generously withholds that torrent of
eloquence which must excite in every breast
sentiments of indignation against the atrocity
which demanded it to flow.—The intention
of this publication is not to excite those sen∣sations
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
the noble-minded speaker wishes to
suppress; it is not to hold forth the charac∣ter
of an Eastern spoiler, for "scorn to point
the finger at;" —it is meant to commemo∣rate
the virtues of a patriot mind, vindicating
the honor of his country, and pleading the
cause of humanity; and, as near as is in the
power of recollection, to preserve to the
public eye, partially at least, one of the most
complete pieces of Oratory that ever graced
an English, or any other Senate.</P>
<P>In doing this, the Reporter frankly con∣fesses
the fallibility of the means—all that
he can boast is, to have come as near the ori∣ginal
as the reminiscent faculties of a person
habituated to parliamentary business, would
permit. How far they have succeeded, those
who had the felicity of being present, are
the most competent to judge.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH,
<DATE>FEBRUARY 7, 1787,</DATE>
ON THE
Fourth Charge against Mr. Hastings:</HEAD>
<OPENER>IN a Committee <HI>of the whole House, Mr. St.
John</HI> in the chair.</OPENER>
<P><HI>Mr. Dempster</HI> having communicated to the
house, that a paper, which he held in his
hand, had been received by him from Sir Eli∣jah
Impey, with a request that he would read
it; as it was explanatory of some passages
which he had given in evidence at the bar of
the House, but which explanation the House
did not think proper to receive, but from the
mouth of Sir Elijah Impey himself, and he not
being present, Mr. SHERIDAN was called
upon.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> during a speech which lasted
near five hours and three quarters, command∣ed
the most profound attention and admira∣tion
of the House. His matchless oration
united the most solid argument with the
most persuasive eloquence. His sound rea∣soning
giving additional energy to truth, and
his logical perspicuity, and unerring judgment,
throwing a light upon, and pervading the ob∣scurity,
of the most involved and compli∣cated
subject.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan's pre-eminence and unrivalled
abilities, will, from this period, stand record∣ed,
as having had power to assimilate the
most discordant sentiments, upon a great and
trying occasion, and (with a few exceptions,)
to unite the various opinions of the multitude in
one point.—He commenced his elegant speech
by saying, that had it been possible to have
received, without the violation of the establish∣ed
rules of Parliament, the paper which the
Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Dempster) had
just now read, he should willingly have re∣ceded
from any forms of the House, for the
purpose of obtaining farther illustration of the
subject then before them: yet he had not
come so ill prepared, as, by a trifling circum∣stance,
to be prevented from proceeding to the
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
discharge of his duty, or that the want of it
could make any impression on the body of
proof he was to bring forward that day a∣gainst
Warren Hastings.</P>
<P>In his opinion, the explanation of the evi∣dence,
so far from throwing any new light upon
it and clearing it up, rendered it even more
obscure and contradictory than before. Every
art was made use of to impress the House
with an idea that this business was not of the
most serious nature. But this was far beneath
his notice. The justice and strength of his
cause were not to be overcome by such pitiful
and flimsey expedients; nor should he waste
his time in opposing measures which were as
paltry and inefficacious, as they were insi∣dious.</P>
<P>He would not, he said, encroach upon the
time of the committee with any general argn∣ments
to prove, what was in itself so obvious,
that the subject of the charge, which it fell to
his lot to bring forward, was of great magni∣tude.
The attention Parliament had bestowed
upon Indian concerns for many sessions past;
the voluminous productions of their commit∣tees
on that subject, the various proceedings
in that House respecting it, their own strong
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
and pointed resolutions, the repeated recom∣mendations
of his Majesty, and their repeated
assurances of paying due regard to those re∣commendations,
as well as various acts of
the legislature, were, all of them, undeniable
proofs of the moment and magnitude of the
consideration, and tended to establish this
broad fact, that they acknowledged the Bri∣tish
name and character to have been disho∣noured
and detested throughout India, by
the malversation and crimes of the ser∣vants
of the East India Company. That fact
having been established beyond all question,
by themselves and their own acts, there need∣ed
no argument, on his part, to induce the
committee to see the importance of the subject
about to be discussed that day, in a more strik∣ing
point of view than they had themselves
placed it in.</P>
<P>There were, he knew, persons, without
doors, who affected to ridicule the idea of
prosecuting Mr. Hastings, and, in proportion
as the prosecution became more serious, to in∣crease
their sarcasms upon the subject, by as∣serting
that Parliament might be more usefully
employed; that there were matters of more
immediate moment to engage their attention;
that a Commercial Treaty with France had
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
just been concluded, and that it was an object
of a vast comprehensive nature, and was of it∣self
sufficient to engross their consideration.</P>
<P>To all this he would oppose these questions:
Was Parliament mispending its time, by en∣quiring
into the oppressions practised on mil∣lions
of unfortunate persons in India, and en∣deavouring
to bring the daring delinquents,
who had been guilty of the most flagrant acts
of enormous tyranny and rapacious pecula∣tion,
to exemplary and condign punishment?
Was it improperly employed in giving an e∣minent
but severe example to their future ser∣vants,
of the madness and folly of relying on
corruption and sycophancy for support, in the
day of trial for their crimes? Was it a misuse
of their functions, to be dilligent in attempting,
by the most effectual means, to wipe off the
disgrace that stood affixed to the British name
in India, and to rescue the national character
from lasting infamy? Were the good faith
and credit of Britain of no consequence in
the eyes of the representatives of the nation?
Surely no man who felt for either the one or
the other, would think that a business of greater
moment or magnitude could occupy his at∣tention,
or that the House could with too much
steadiness, too ardent a zeal, or too industrious
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
a perseverance, pursue its object. Indeed they
must all know and feel the necessity of bring∣ing
this important case to the issue now in∣tended.
Their conduct in this respect last
year had done them immortal honour, and
proved to all the world, that, however dege∣nerate
an example of the conduct of English∣men,
some of the British subjects had exhibited
in India, the people of England collectively,
speaking and acting by their representatives,
felt as men should feel on such an oecasion;
that they were anxious to do justice, by redres∣sing
injuries and punishing offenders, however
high their rank, however elevated their station.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan said he would exhibit to their
view a body of information, which would prove
the commission of the most horrid crimes ever
conceived by the foulest heart that ever inha∣bited
a human frame; facts which persons
of every party, of every political bias in this
kingdom, had been assisting in bringing to
view. In these had the indefatigable attention
and labour of several committees been employ∣ed;
it was the work of many years: these were
fully demonstrated in the various clear and
elaborate reports which had been long upon
their table; their long and interesting de∣bates,
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
their solemn address to the throne, and
their rigorous legislative acts.</P>
<P>The vote of the House last session, wherein the
conduct of this pillar of India, this corner stone
of our strength in the east, this tallisman of
the British dominions in Asia, was censured,
did the greatest honour to that house, as it
must be the fore-runner of speedy justice on
<HI>that character</HI> which was said to be above cen∣sure,
and whose conduct, we were given to
understand, was above suspicion, His deeds
were such, they could not be justified by any
possible necessity; for no situation, however
elevated, however embarrassed, could justify a
man for committing acts of rapacity upon in∣dividuals.
To the honour of that House, they
had resisted the monstrous argument attempted
to be set up, they had shewn their detestation
of that novel and base scepticism on the prin∣ciples
of judicial enquiry, constantly the lan∣guage
of the Governor General's <HI>servile de∣pendents;</HI>
that such horrid crimes should be
compounded; that, though <HI>M. Hastings</HI> might
be guilty of all the charges exhibited against
him, he ought not to be punished; he should
still be considered as the <HI>saviour of India,</HI> and
that fortunate events were a full and complete
fet-off against a system of oppression, corrup∣tion,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
breach of faith, peculation and treachery.
What though King, Lords, and Commons,
were against him, he was not a person to be
assailed; for he had a vote of thanks from the
Court of Proprietors in his pocket. The
committee had, however, nobly combated
such doctrine, and declared that <HI>Mr. Has∣tings</HI>'s
treatment of <HI>Cheyt Sing</HI> was unjustifi∣able
upon any ground of political necessity.
Their solemn and awful judgment, that in the
case of Benares, Mr. Hastings's conduct was
a proper object of parliamentary impeachment,
had covered them with applause, and brought
them forward in the face of all the world as
the objects of perpetual admiration. To use
the words of a Right Honourable Gentleman
(Mr. Pitt) on this subject, the committee had
found in the administration of Mr. Hastings,
"<HI>Acts of strong injustice, of grinding oppression, and
nnprovoked severity.</HI>" That committee had also
rescued his Right Honourable Friend (Mr.
Burke) from the imputation of being a false ac∣cuser,
they had shewn that he was not moved by
envy, by malice, nor any unworthy motives to
blacken a spotless name; they had approved him
to be, what in reality he was, an indefatigable,
and, he was happy to add, a successful, cham∣pion
in the cause of truth, humanity, and jus∣tice.
With sound judgment, with manly firm∣ness,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
with unshaken integrity, had his Right
Honourable Friend resisted the timid policy
of mere <HI>remedial</HI> acts. Even the high opinion
of Mr. Hastings's successor, even the admitted
worth of Lord Cornwallis's character, had
been deemed by him an inadequate atonement
to India for the injuries so heavily inflicted on
her. The committee had by their vote so∣lemnly
pledged themselves to India. They
had audibly said to the inhabitants of that
country; There shall be no more <HI>remedial</HI> acts:
You shall no longer be seduced into temporary
acquiescence, by sending out a titled governor,
or a vapouring set of resolutions; It is not with
stars and ribbands, and all the badges of regal
favour, that weatone to you for past delinquen∣cies,
these should bend to the sacred shrine of
justice, and the people of India shall be con∣vinced
of our honest intentions. You shall
have the solid consolation of seeing an end to
your grievances, by an example of punishment
for past offences. The House has set up a bea∣con,
which, while it served as a guide to
themselves, would also make their motions
more conspicuous to the world that surrounded
and beheld them. He had no doubt of their
manly determination to go through the whole
of the business, with the same steadiness which
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
gave such sterling brilliancy of character to
their outset, and that they might safely chal∣lenge
the world, to observe and judge of them
by the result.</P>
<P>After an exordium of this tendency, Mr.
Sheridan took notice of a paper, signed "War∣ren
Hastings," which had been put into his
hand, as he entered the house that day, and
which he considered as a second defence, and a
second answer to the charge he was about to
bring forward; a charge, replete with proof of
criminality of the blackest die, of tyranny the
most base and unprecedented, of treachery the
most vile and premeditated, of corruption the
most open and shameless, of oppression the most
grinding and severe, and cruelty the most un∣manly
and unparalleled.</P>
<P>There never was a question since the creation
of the world, wherein so much cruelty, wicked∣ness,
inhumanity and depravity, were put to
the test, as in the present case. He was no
party accuser: <Q>I call, said Mr. Sheridan,
upon his advocates to watch my words, and
to take them down. I will exhibit no charge
that has not solid truth for its foundation, for
I trust nothing to declamation.</Q> Mr. She∣ridan
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
added; he was far from meaning to rest
the charge on assertion, or on any warm ex∣pressions
that the impulse of wounded feelings
might produce: He would establish every part
of the charge, by the most unanswerable proof,
and the most unquestionable evidence; the
witness, whom he would bring forth to support
every fact he intended to state, should be, for the
most part, a witness that no man would venture
to contradict; no other than <HI>Warren Hastings</HI>
himfelf!</P>
<P>And yet such a character had friends—he
blamed them not—they might possibly conclude
him innocent;—because he himself asserted it
was so.</P>
<P>The defence of Mr. Hastings would establish
every charge he had to make against him.
There was not one fact which was not founded
on, or mixed with falsehood; no one question
that was truly given; nor one single conclusion
which followed fairly from the premises laid
down: but of this assertion, the multiplied proofs
would shortly arise.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan said he would go farther back
into a detail of facts than his Right Honourable
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
friend had done in his charge, in order the
more clearly to shew the committee the situation
in which the British government of India stood
with respect to the Nabob of Oude and the Be∣gums,
till the design of obliging the Nabob to
plunder those unfortunate Princesses (his mother
and grandmother) of their treasures, to confis∣cate
their Jaghires and seize upon the ministers,
throw them into a dungeon, there load them
with chains, and keep them for many months
close prisoners, suffering incredible hardships,
was first entertained by the Governor General.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan here read a variety of extracts
from Mr. Hastings's defence; wherein were
stated the various steps taken by Mr. <HI>Bristow,</HI>
(the Company's Resident at Fyzyabad,) in the
years 1775 and 1776, to procure aid for the Na∣bob,
from the Begum, (the dowager princesses of
that district,) and that he thought proper to
exact, by his sole authority, thirty lacks of ru∣pees,
for the use of the Nabob Vizier of Oude,
out of the treasures bequeathed to the Begum
by her late husband Sujah Dowla; obtaining
however the guarantee of the Governor and
Council that, that exaction, for which no sha∣dow
of right was shewn, should be the last. Mr.
Hastings, however, had not stated one of the
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
facts truly. Groundless, nugatory and insult∣ing
were his affirmations, that the seizure of
treasures from the Begums, and the exposition
of their pilfered goods to public auction, (un∣parallelled
acts of open injustice, oppression and
inhumanity) were in any degree to be defended
by those incroachments on their property, which
had taken place previous to his administration,
or by those sales which they themselves had so∣licited,
as a favourable mode of their supplying
a part of their aid to the Nabob. The re∣lation
of a series of plain indisputable facts, would
irrecoverably overthrow a subterfuge so pitiful, a
distinction so ridiculous. It must be remem∣bered
that, at that period, the Begums did not
<HI>merely desire,</HI> but they most <HI>expresly stipulated,</HI>
that of the thirty lacks promised, eleven should
be paid in sundry articles of manufacture. Was
it not obvious therefore, that the sale of goods
in the first case, far from partaking of the na∣ture
of an act of plunder, became an extension
of relief, of indulgence, and of accommodation.
By the passages which he should beg leave to
read, <HI>Mr. Hastings</HI> wished to insinuate that a
claim was set up to the Begum's treasure, as
belonging of right to the Nabob. In this
transaction Mr. Hastings endeavoured to shift
the responsibility from himself to the majority
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
of the Council, and under that authority to keep
alive the Nabob's right.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, in order to prove the op∣pression
of the Princesses in 1775, which
was much aggravated in 1781, read an extract
of a letter from the Bhow Begum, mother
of the Nabob, to Mr. Hastings, received at
Calcutta December 22, 1775, wherein she says,
<Q>If it is <HI>your pleasure</HI> that the mother of the
late Nabob, myself, and his other women,
and infant children, should be reduced to a
state of dishonour and distress, we <HI>must submit;</HI>
but if, on the contrary, you call to mind the
friendship of the late blessed Nabob, you will
exert yourself effectually in favour of us, who
are helpless.</Q> And again, <Q>If you do not
approve of my remaining at Fyzyabad, send
a person here, in your name, to remove the
mother of the late Nabob, myself, and about
2000 women and children, that we may re∣side
with honour and reputation in some other
place.</Q> This letter and several others were
read, to prove the controuling power of Mr.
Hastings in Oude, at so late a period as before
mentioned; and to prove that every circum∣stance
of oppression and exaction, practised on
these Princesses, was done by the orders, con∣sent,
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
and approbation, of the Governor, who
was supposed to be paramount in Oude.</P>
<P><HI>Treasure,</HI> which was the true source of all
the cruelties, was the original pretence which
Mr. Hastings made to the Company for the
measure; and through the whole of his conduct
he makes Mahomedanism an excuse; as if he
meant to insinuate, that there was something in
Mahomedanism which made it impious in a
son, not to plunder his mother. But, to shew
how the question precisely stood when Mr.
Hastings begun the attack, Mr. Sheridan read
the Minutes of General Clavering, Colonel
Monson, and Mr. Francis, who severally spoke
of a claim which had been made by the Nabob
on the Bhow Begum, in the year 1775, amount∣ing
to two and a half lacks. The opinion con∣tained
in those minutes was, that women were,
on the death of their husbands, entitled by the
Mahomedan law, only to the property within
the Zenana where they lived. This opinion
was decisive. Mr. Bristow used no threats; no
military execution or rigor was even menaced
the Begums complied with the requisition then
made, and the disputed property then claimed
was given up.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19"/>
After this, the farther treasure that was
within the Zenana, was confessedly her own.
No farther right was set up, no pretence of any
kind was advanced, to claim the residue. Nay,
a treaty was signed by the Nabob, and ratified,
by the Resident, Mr. Bristow that, on her
paying thirty lacks, she should be freed from
all farther applications; and the Company were
bound, by Mr. Bristow, to guarantee this treaty.
Here then was the issue. After this treaty thus
ratified, could there be an argument as to the
right of the treasures of the Begums? If the
Mahomedan law had given a right, was not that
right concluded?</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan averred, that the Mahomedan
law did not authorize the seizure of the Princesses
property; that several jaghires were left them
by the late Nabob Sujah Doulah for their own
maintenance, and the education of their chil∣dren;
that the plunder was never authorised by
the Board; and that military execution being
used for the recovery of the exactions, was
contrary to every principle of justice; and that
the Nabob complied reluctantly in many in∣stances:
that Mr. Bristow acted under the or∣ders
of his immediate superior: that, when the
whole transaction was censured, Mr. Hastings
then threw off all responsibility, and appealed
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
pealed to the orders of the Board, at a
time, when he knew the authority of the
Board was vested in himself alone, there
being only one other member; and the
Governor having the casting voice, every
act must become his own. This, said
Mr. Sheridan, is somewhat similar to the
following case.—If, some five years
hence, I was to become a warm ad∣mirer
of Mr. Hastings's late adminis∣tration,
and from friendship, become
his panegyrist; would not some person
who hears me now, remind me of my
accusations against him, and say to me,
Why this sudden change of opinion?
I could only answer, that I thought so
then; but since that time I had changed
my opinion, and that I was not answer∣able
now for what I then did in my
official capacity. What must the world
think of such tergiversation, of such
meanness? Is there any man in this
House that would countenance such a
nefarious procedure? After a solemn gua∣rantee
and assignment is entered into, thus
to break the public faith, which was
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
pledged to preserve their property, is a
transaction that honor shrinks from. The
Begums were said to be in the habits of
disturbing the public peace; but there is
no instance on record of any such attempt,
until the revolution of Benares; and then
all India seemed to be hostile to England.</P>
<P>I would here sit down, and rest my
question of censure, on the issue of what
has been produced; as it must be clear to
every member, that the princesses were en∣titled
to our protection; and that every
hostile attempt, to wrest their property
from them, was unjust and disgraceful. I
require no other proof for this than Mr.
Hastings's own words, wherein he says,
<Q>That our officious interference made
us many foes.</Q></P>
<P>In 1778, we entered into another treaty
with the Nabob, which was negotiated
by Mr. Middleton, wherein it was stipu∣lated,
that the Bhow Begum was not to
be molested; and, not long after, Mr.
Hastings transmits to the Court of Di∣rectors
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
a distressful picture of the situa∣tion
of the Nabob, of the horrors and
famine which triumphed over his coun∣try.</P>
<P>If it were possible for a country to be
still more distressed, the Nabob's territo∣ries
were so in the year 1780; but, at that
period, there was a majority in council,
whose sentiments were by no means fa∣vourable
to the persecuting schemes of the
Governor; and, for this reason, there was
then no offer to molest the property of
the Begums.</P>
<P>In the subsequent year, however, the
Governor took especial care to furnish
himself with power. The treaty of <HI>Chu∣nar</HI>
was executed; and surely a treaty, so
marked with dissimulation, was never be∣fore
entered into: the Governor made
himself responsible for every political tran∣saction
in that ravaged and oppressed
country.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23"/>
Mr. Sheridan said he had now reached
the period, when Mr. Hastings's first in∣tentions
appeared, to enforce the execu∣tion
of his projects at all events; when,
by <HI>Mr. Middleton,</HI> his private agent, he
urged the Nabob <HI>Asoph ul Dowla,</HI> to
break this solemn engagement, sanctioned
by the guarantee of the Company, to de∣prive
his mother, and the elder Begum, his
grandmother, of the jaghires which were
assigned for their support; and proceed∣ing
still farther to plunder them of their
treasures, which he had avowed to be their
sole property, and which he had solemnly
pledged himself should remain inviolate.
It was a little difficult, however, here to
say, what was the question at issue. It
had sometimes been said, that the Nabob
had an inherent right to this wealth, as
the wealth of the state; but when it was
recollected that it was not made up of the
produce of taxes, but collected by the
conquests of his father, Sujah Dowla, by
him bequeathed as a personal acquisition,
(prudently for his son,) whom it would
only make the object of rapacious attack,
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
and to whom he, with more wisdom, be∣queathed
necessity as his sword, and po∣verty
as his shield; and when it was con∣sidered
in what manner, and on what
condition, it was relinquished by the Na∣bob,
and that dereliction guaranteed by the
Company, he thought that ground of
defence would scarcely be occupied on the
present day. Mr. Hastings in his defence
had taken a more extended field, where
there was more scope for his delusion,
more amplitude for his equivocation. He
had admitted the right to have rested in
the Begums, but contended that it had
been forfeited by their frequent acts of
contumacy and rebellion. This allegation
against them had been divided into four
parts:—The charges were the following.</P>
<P>1. That they had given disturbances at
all times to the Nabob, and that they had
long manifested a spirit, hostile to his and
to the English government:</P>
<P>2. That they excited the Zemindars to
revolt, at the time of the insurrection at
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
Benares, and of the resumption of the
Jaghires:</P>
<P>3. That they resisted by armed force
the resumption of their own Jaghires: and</P>
<P>4. That they excited and were acces∣sary
to the insurrection at Benares.</P>
<P>To each of these charges Mr. Sheridan
made distinct and separate answers, by a va∣riety
of extracts which he read; some of them
written by Mr. Hastings himself, to prove
that they had particularly distinguished
themselves by their <HI>friendship</HI> for the En∣glish,
and the various good offices they
had rendered Government. Against the
<HI>first</HI> charge <HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> adduced proofs,
in the most pointed terms, from the seve∣ral
letters which passed between Mr. Has∣tings
and Mr. Middleton, Colonel Han∣nay
and the Nabob. By this correspon∣dence
it was very evident, that their con∣duct
during the period from 1775 to 1781,
so far from being what it was represented,
had been mild and inoffensive. Not a
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
single symptom of inveteracy, not one
solid proof of disaffection, was mentioned
in these letters, but in all, their conduct
appeared as much the reverse, as it was in
the nature of things to expect. The
<HI>second</HI> charge fell to the ground the in∣stant
it was examined; for, so far from
any undue influence being used on the
part of the <HI>Begums,</HI> to stimulate the Jag∣hirdars
to resistance, it did not even appear
that the smallest resistance was made by
the jaghirdars, against the violences which
they sustained. The third charge was
equally false. Did they resist the resump∣tion
of their own jaghires? Though, if they
had actually resisted, it could not be deemed
criminal; for those jaghires were their own
property, vested in them and confirmed
to them by a solemn treaty. But is there,
in fact, one syllable of charge alledged
against them? With all the load of
obloquy which the Nabob incurred,
had he ever accused them of the crime of
resisting his authority? No; he had not.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27"/>
To prove the falsehood of the whole of
this charge, and to shew that Mr. Hastings
originally projected the plunder; that he
threw the Odium in the first instance on
the Nabob; that he imputed the crimes
to them, before he had received one of the
rumours which he afterwards manufac∣tured
into affidavits; he recommended a
particular attention to dates; and he de∣duced
from the papers these clear facts—
that the first idea sprung from Mr. Hast∣ings,
on the 25th of November, 1781;
that Mr. Middleton communicated it to
the Nabob, and procured from him a for∣mal
proposition on the 2d of December;
That on the 1st of December Mr. Hastings
wrote a letter to Mr. Middleton, confirm∣ing
the first suggestion made through Sir
Elijah, which letter came into the hands
of Mr. Middleton on the 6th of Decem∣ber.
He stated all the circumstances of
the pains taken by Mr. Middleton, who
was empowered by Mr. Hastings to force
the Nabob, on whom all the blame is
laid, and whose act it was, to seize on his
mother's jaghires; and coupled this with
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
the extraordinary minute written by Mr.
Hastings on his return to Calcutta, where
he stated the resistance of the Begums to
the execution of the resumption on the
7th of January, 1782, as the cause of the
measure in November, 1781. Mr. Mid∣dleton
had proved that the Nabob had no
such intention, for, in writing to Mr.
Hastings, he says, <Q>finding the Na∣bob
wavering in his determination of
the resumption of the Jaghires, I this
day, (6th Dec. 1781,) in the presence of
his Minister informed him, that unless
he would issue <HI>his</HI> perwannahs for that
purpose, I would issue <HI>my</HI> perwannahs.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then took pains to shew,
that the Begums were, by their condition,
their age, their infirmities, &amp;c. almost the
only two souls in India, who could not in
some measure have hurt the Government.
He did not, he said, take pains to do this
from any idea, that, because there was no
motive for plundering the women, it might
be asserted that it was an improbable false∣hood:
he was not to learn that there
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
was such a thing as wantonness of wick∣edness.
Those, who had doubts on this
point, had only to read the history of the
administration of Mr. Hastings. He pro∣ved
by the documents, on the table, that
there was, and had always been, insurrec∣tion
and disorder in Oude. To ascribe it
to the Begums was the most improbable
fiction: they might as well say, that
famine would not have pinched, that
thirst would not have parched, that exter∣mination
would not have depopulated,
but for the interference of these old women.
To use a strong expression of Mr. Hast∣ings,
on another occasion, <Q>The good
that those women did was certain; the
ill was precarious.</Q> He, on the con∣trary,
took the converse of the proposition;
wanting a motive for his rapacity, he could
find it only in fiction. The simple fact
was, their treasure was their treason.
They complained of injustice: God
of heaven! had they not a right to com∣plain?
After a solemn treaty violated,
plundered of all their property, and on the
eve of the last extremity of wretchedness,
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
were they to be deprived of the last resource
of impotent wretchedness, complaint and
lamentation? Was it a crime that they
should croud together in fluttering trepida∣tion,
like a flock of resistless birds in the air,
on seeing the felon kite, who, having darted
at one devoted bird and missed his aim, sin∣gled
out a new object, and was springing on
his prey with more vigour in his wing, and
keener lightning in his eye. The fact with
Mr. Hastings was precisely this: having
failed in the cause of Cheyt Sing, he saw his
fate; he felt the necessity of procuring a
sum of money somewhere, for he knew
that to be the never-failing receipt to
make his peace with the Directors at
home.</P>
<P>Such, Mr. Sheridan added, were the
true, substantial motives of the horrid ex∣cesses
perpetrated against the Begums!
Excesses, in every part of the description
of which, he felt himself supported by the
most indisputable evidence. Here he
would rest his cause. Let gentlemen lay
their hands upon their hearts, and with
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
truth issuing in all its purity from their
lips, solemnly declare, whether they were,
or were not convinced, that the <HI>real</HI> spring
of the conduct of Mr. H. far from be∣ing
a desire to crush rebellion, <HI>an ideal fa∣bulous
rebellion!</HI> was a malignantly rapa∣cious
determination to seize, with lawless
hands, upon the treasures of devoted, mi∣serable,
yet unoffending victims.</P>
<P>Amongst other proofs which Mr. She∣ridan
brought against the second and
fourth charges, was a minute of what
<HI>Mr. Stables</HI> proposed at the Board, <Q>Whe∣ther
any disaffection to the English
Government appeared before the troubles
of Benares?</Q> Mr. Hastings remained
silent.</P>
<P>In the farther discussion of the charges,
<HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> said, it would be necessary
for him to follow the Governor General in
his tour from <HI>Calcutta</HI> to <HI>Chunar,</HI> which
commenced the 8th of July, 1781, a
journey he thought necessary to take,
finding the Nabob unwilling to seize on
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
his mother's jaghires. Mr. Hastings had
himself said, That he left Calcutta with
the strongest idea of the reduced state of
the Company's possessions, which the
event proved he went to recruit in the
most expeditious manner possible. Sir
Elijah Impey had said, when under exa∣mination,
that Mr. Hastings went out
with only two resources to retrieve the
circumstances of the Company; namely,
Benares and Oude; Countries already
oppressed by the hand of Providence, but
more so by the wicked and arbitrary ma∣chinations
of man. What a horrid idea!
No other resource but the plunder of a
famished country! Can any simile equal
it? unless I suppose, a person determined
on a robbery, and having failed at Bag∣shot,
resolves to try his fortune at
Hounslow.</P>
<P>In <HI>Benares</HI> it was sufficiently known
that Mr. Hastings had failed. There
his prodigal revenge had disappointed his
rapacity; whence the unfortunate victim of
malicious insolence had been compelled to
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
wander from his kingdom, a melancholy
example of the vicissitude of human affairs.
The hopes of plunder at <HI>Oude,</HI> promised
to compensate for his miscarriage at <HI>Be∣nares.</HI>
Then, and not till then, not thro'
any former enmities shewn by the Begums,
not thro' any old disturbances, but because
he had failed in one place, and that he
had but two in his prospect, did he con∣trive
the expedient of plundering these aged
women: he had no pretence, he had no
excuse for his conduct, but the arrogant
and obstinate determination to govern India
by his corrupt will. His disappointment
at <HI>Benares</HI> urged him with rapid steps
to <HI>Oude,</HI> where indeed he was but too
successful.</P>
<P>Inflamed by disappointment in his first
project, he hastened to the fortress of
<HI>Chunar,</HI> to meditate the more atrocious
design of instigating a son against his
mother; of sacrificing female dignity and
distress to parricide and plunder.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34"/>
The treaty of <HI>Chunar,</HI> that nefarious
foundation of his future views, being
planned, Mr. Hastings thought it neces∣sary,
whilst he was invading the substance
of justice, to avail himself of her judi∣cial
forms, and accordingly sent for Sir
Elijah Impey, the Chief Justice of India,
to assisth im.</P>
<P>Sir Elijah being arrived, Mr. Hastings,
with much art, proposed a question of
opinion, involving an unsubstantiated fact,
in order to obtain even a surreptitious ap∣probation
of the measures he had prede∣termined
to adopt.</P>
<P>With regard to the mode of submit∣ting
questions to Sir Elijah Impey, it
was, he observed, singular and curious.
In respect to the affairs of Cheit Sing,
Mr. Hastings had stated the question,
not in the abstract merely, but accom∣panied
with the fact. To that question
Sir Elijah demurred, not caring to
commit himself. With regard to the
Begums, Mr. Hastings profits by his ex∣perience,
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
and states the question in the
abstract, saying, "The Begums being in
rebellion, is it not warrantable to seize
their treasures?" To this, (which like
one of the Duke of Richmond's <HI>data,</HI>
carries with it its own answer, because
<HI>being in rebellion,</HI> the seizure might have
been made,) Sir Elijah answers directly
and explicitly in the affirmative, there∣by
not risking any thing.</P>
<P>Not a syllable of enquiry intervened as
to the existence of the imputed rebellion;
nor a moment's pause, as to the ill pur∣poses
to which the decision of a Chief
Justice might be perverted. It was not
the office of a friend to mix the grave
caution and cold circumspection of a
judge with an opinion taken in such cir∣cumstances;
and Sir Elijah had pre∣viously
declared, that he gave his advice
not as a judge, but as a friend; a charac∣ter
he equally preferred in the strange of∣fice
which he undertook of collecting de∣fensive
affidavits on the subject of Benares.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
It was curious, Mr. Sheridan said, to
reflect on the whole of Sir Elijah's cir∣cuit
at that perilous time. Sir Elijah had
stated his desire of relaxing from the fa∣tigues
of office, and unbending his mind
in a party of health and pleasure; yet,
wisely apprehending that very sudden re∣laxation
might defeat its purpose, he
contrived to mix some objects of business
with his amusements. He had therefore
in his little airing of 900 miles, great part
of which he went post, escorted by an ar∣my,
selected those very situations where
insurrections subsisted, and rebellion was
threatened, and had not only delivered his
deep and curious researches into the laws
and rights of nations, and of treaties, in
the capacity of the oriental Grotius, whom
Warren Hastings was to study, but like∣wise
in the humbler and more practical
situation of a collector of <HI>ex parte</HI> evidence.
In the former quality his opinion was the
premature sanction for plundering the
Begums. In the latter character he be∣came
the posthumous supporter of the ex∣pulsion
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
and pillage of the Rajah Cheyt
Sing.</P>
<P>With a generous oblivion of duty and
honour, with a proud sense of having au∣thorized
all future rapacity, and sanction∣ed
all past oppression, this friendly judge
proceeded on his circuit of health and ease;
and while the Governor General, sanc∣tioned
by his solemn opinion, issued his
orders to plunder the Begums of their
treasure, Sir Elijah pursued his progress,
passing through a wide region of dis∣ress
and misery, in quest of objects best
suited to his feelings, in anxious search of
calamities most kindred to his invalid
imagination. Friendship, then, made Sir
Elijah forget what was due to himself,
what was due to the high office in
which he was placed, and to the power
which had placed him in it. He was
the last man who ought to have un∣dertaken
such an office. He was bound
to have maintained a line of conduct more
consonant with the elevation of his rank,
the dignity of his office, and the gravity of
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
a judge; who ought to have felt himself
incapable of soiling his pure ermine, by
condescending to run about the country,
like an itinerant informer, with a pedlar's
pack of garbled evidence and surreptitious
affidavits.</P>
<P>He could not be ignorant of the robbery
his errand was intended to cover; for his
first question mooted the point. The judge
most gravely informs us, that he was cau∣tioned
not to proceed from <HI>Chunar</HI> by way
of Fyzyabad, as <HI>the Begums were in rebel∣lion.</HI>
Most friendly advice indeed! Fy∣zyabad
was many score of miles out of
the route of <HI>Lucknow</HI> to <HI>Chunar;</HI> and,
at that moment, peace absolutely prevailed
in every part of the country; his <HI>datum,</HI>
therefore would have been discovered to
be false. Nor would it have been very
pleasant for him to be found at Fyzyabad,
with the actual order in his pocket, by
which they were to be plundered, which
happened to be the fact. Here Mr.
Sheridan proved what he asserted, by read∣ing
extracts from authenticated papers.

<P><PB N="36" REF="41"/>
When Mr. Hastings arrived at <HI>Chu∣nar,</HI>
he was met by the Nabob with an
open and unsuspecting heart. Here the
most insidious Treaty on the one part,
that ever was entered into, was con∣certed
and concluded; no one article
of it being intended for execution on
the part of the Governor. In the first
article it was stipulated with one he calls
an <HI>independent Prince</HI> <Q>That, as
great distress has arisen to the Nabob's
government, from the military power
and dominion assumed by the Jag∣hierdars,
he be <HI>permitted</HI> to resume
such as he may find necessary; with
a reserve, that all such, for the amount
of whose Jaghires the Company are
guarantees, shall, in case of the re∣sumption
of their lands, be paid the
amount of their net collections, thro'
the Resident, in ready money. And
that no English Resident be appoint∣ed
to Furruckabad.</Q></P>
<P>This was solemnly covenanted, in
direct infraction of a subsisting guaran∣tee
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
for the protection of the Begum's
Jaghires. And how was this cloaked?
Why, by affidavits, taken extra-judicially
by his Majesty's Chief Justice in Ben∣gal,
who says very guardedly in his
evidence, that several persons deposed
that a design was entered into to extir∣pate
the English from India. But
when? Not till <HI>after</HI> the transactions
at Benares, when the weight of the arm
of power compelled that unfortunate
Prince, Cheyt Sing, to become an un∣happy
wanderer, and when the name
of <HI>Briton</HI> became detested throughout
Hindostan. This artifice was thin,
and the veil was easily seen through, for
the plan was preconcerted, long before
the revolution at Benares took place.</P>
<P>This first article, containing a general
permission to the Nabob to confiscate,
and take into his hands such Jaghiers as
he might find necessary, Mr. Hastings
<HI>inverted</HI> singularly, by making him con∣fiscate
whatever Jaghiers he pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43"/>
The second article stipulated for the
withdrawing of the British army from
the Province of Oude, which Mr.
Hastings did, but inverted the article
singularly, by reserving to himself a right
to send another army into the Province
when he thought proper. The two
other articles, the one for withdrawing
the British President at Furruckabad, and
the other stipulating for putting Fizula
Cawn into the hands of the Nabob, both,
by a singular inversion, Mr. Hastings
rendered of no effect or avail.</P>
<P>The unsuspecting Nabob, in the
warmth of friendship, at meeting the
Governor, and concluding a Treaty
which he thought salutary to his interest,
made him a present of ONE HUNDRED
THOUSAND POUNDS. This, exclaimed
<HI>Mr. Sheridan,</HI> was rank corruption in
<HI>Mr. Hastings.</HI> The circumstances of
this present were as extraordinary as
the thing itself. Four months after∣wards,
and not till then, Mr. Hastings
communicated the matter to the Compa∣ny;
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
unfortunately for himself however,
this tardy disclosure was conveyed in
words which betray his original mean∣ing;
for, with no common incaution, he
admits the present "<HI>was of a magnitude
not to be concealed.</HI>"</P>
<P>Then it was published and made
known, that Bills on <HI>Gopaul Doss,</HI> the
Banker, (then a prisoner,) were given to
the amount mentioned, payable in four
months. And this was to be extorted
from a country, at the time its Prince
declared his inability to pay his debts,
and when his minister <HI>Hyder Beg Cawn</HI>
declared it to be "<HI>a speaking picture of
Famine and Woe.</HI>" <HI>Mr. Sheridan,</HI> in
stating all the circumstances of this bribe,
averred that the whole had its rise in a
principle of rank corruption; for what was
the price that hepaid? By the treaty he
agreed to withdraw all the English gen∣tlemen,
and all the English army. He
agreed to this at the moment of rebel∣lion
and revolt. The other articles
of the treaty, as strange, nothing but
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
the bribe could have occasioned, toge∣ther
with the reserve which he had in
his own mind, of treachery to the Na∣bob;
for the only part of the treaty
which he ever attempted to carry into
execution, was to withdraw the English
gentlemen from <HI>Oude.</HI> The Nabob
considered this as essential to his deli∣verance,
and his observation on the cir∣cumstance
was curious; for, <Q>though
Major Palmer, <HI>said he,</HI> has not
asked any thing, I observe it is the
custom of the English gentlemen con∣stantly
to ask for something of me be∣fore
they go.</Q> This imputation on
the English Mr. Hastings countenanced,
most readily, and rejoiced at it, as it was
a screen and shelter for his own aban∣doned
profligacy; and therefore, at the
very moment that he was himself plun∣dering
the Nabob, with his usual gravity
and cant, making a feint of executing
this part of the Treaty; <Q>Go, said he,
to the English gentlemen; Go, you set
of oppressive rascals; Go from this
worthy unhappy man, whom <HI>you</HI> have
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
plundered, and leave him to <HI>my</HI> pro∣tection.
You have robbed him, you
have taken advantage of his accumu∣lated
distresses; but, please God, he
shall in future be at rest; for I have
promised he shall never see the face
of an Englishman again.</Q> This how∣ever
was the only part of the treaty
which he even attempted to fulfil; and
we learn from himself, that, at the very
moment he made it, he intended to de∣ceive
the Nabob. That he advised <HI>ge∣neral,</HI>
instead of <HI>partial</HI> resumption, in
order to defeat the end and view of the
Nabob; and, instead of having given
instant and unqualified assent to all the
articles of the treaty, he had perpetually
qualified, explained, and varied them
with new diminutions and reservations.</P>
<P>He had suffered the Nabob to take
their Jaghiers from several Jaghierdars;
but he had compelled him to deprive
others of their's according to his will:
he withdrew the army according to the
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
wish of the vizier, but it was only to
send back almost instantly an equivalent
force: he resigned the fortresses, but to
garrison them again immediately. This
might by the friends of Mr. Hastings,
be deemed policy; but surely it was too
clumsy a fraud, too gross a fallacy, to
deserve that name. It was however like
the man, though unlike the greatness
ascribed to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan put the whole of this
into a very glaring point of view, and
called upon gentlemen to say, if there
was any thing in Machiavel, any treach∣ery
upon record, if they had ever heard
of any cold Italian fraud, that could in
any degree be put in comparison with
the disgusting hypocrisy, and unequalled
baseness, that Mr. Hastings had shewn
on that occasion.</P>
<P>In his defence, Mr. Hastings had made
it his boast, that the conduct of his life
had been uniformly governed by the
rules of <HI>honour and plain dealing.</HI> He
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
asked, how was this bold and daring
assertion to be reconciled to his whole
conduct throughout the affair of the
Begums? In every part of which, ob∣liquity,
fraud, falsehood, treachery, op∣pression,
the most glaring violation of
justice, and the most open breach of
solemn engagements, were the great and
leading features. He had heard it said by
some of his admirers, but who were not so
implicit as to give unqualified applause to
his crimes, that they found an apology for
the atrocity of his actions in the greatness
of his mind. He could not, upon the
closest examination of his conduct, dis∣cover
the smallest symptoms of either
a great mind, or great ability. To es∣timate
the solidity of such a defence, it
would be sufficient, merely to consider
in what consisted this prepossessing dis∣tion,
this captivating characteristic of
greatness of mind. It was the cha∣racteristic
of magnanimity to aim at
attaining a great end by great means;
to support truth, to protect the weak,
to relieve the oppressed, to right the
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
injured, to punish those that had done
wrong; and, on no consideration, to
countenance injustice. In these traits,
and these alone, we are to discover true
estimable magnanimity; to them alone
we can justly affix the splendid titles and
honours of real greatness. Were these
the characteristicks of Mr. Hastings?
Directly the reverse. Mr. Hastings, in
his conduct and in his writings, exhibit∣ed
a system made up of things unnatu∣rally
conjoined. His letters and his
minutes were full of strutting meanness,
bombastical prevarication, and ridicu∣lously
violent contradictions in terms;
just as the mass and magnitude of his
crimes were contrasted with the little∣ness
of his motives, and the low means
he could condescend to for the attain∣ment
of his objects. The most grovel∣ing
ideas, he conveyed in the most in∣flated
language, giving mock conse∣quence
to low cavils, and uttering quib∣bles
in heroics; so that his compositions
disgusted the mind's taste, as much as
his actions excited the soul's abhor∣rence.
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
In short, he appeared to be a
mixture of the trickster and the ty∣rant,
at once a Scapin and a Diony∣sius.
It seemed that all his actions
were directed by a low, underhand,
crooked, policy; as well might the
writhing obliquity of the serpent be
compared to the direct and unvaried
swiftness of the arrow, as the duplicity
of Mr. Hastings's ambition, to the sim∣ple
steadiness of genuine magnanimity.
Mr. Hastings, if he ever acted with
wisdom, it was with perverted wisdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan said, that this mixture
of character seemed, by some unac∣countable,
but inherent, quality, to be
appropriated in inferior degrees to eve∣ry
thing that concerned his employers.
He remembered to have heard a learned
gentleman (Mr. Dundas) remark, that
there was something in the original
frame and constitution of the Company,
which carried the sordid ideas of the
mercantile principle on which it was
founded, always about them; so that,
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
even in all their measures and ac∣tions,
we saw the paltry character.
Their civil policy and their military
atchievements were connected with and
contaminated by the meanness of
pedlars, and the profligacy of pirates.
Thus we saw <HI>auctioneering ambassadors,</HI>
and <HI>trading generals.</HI>—And thus we saw
a revolution brought about by <HI>affidavits,</HI>
an army employed in <HI>executing an ar∣rest,</HI>
a town besieged on <HI>a note of hand;</HI>
a prince dethroned for <HI>the balance of
an account.</HI> They exhibited a go∣vernment,
in which they had all the
mock majesty of a <HI>bloody sceptre;</HI> and the
little <HI>traffick of a merchant's counting
house,</HI> wielding a truncheon with one
hand, and he might truly say, <HI>picking
a pocket with the other.</HI></P>
<P>He then proceeded to state the conduct
of Mr. Hastings, in enforcing the resump∣tion
of the Jaghire, and the plunder of the
envied treasure, of the Begums. On the
27th of Nov. 1781, his pleasure concern∣ing
that business was first sent, through
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
Sir Elijah Impey, to Mr. Middleton. On
the 1st of December this was backed by
a written order; and it was not, until
the 8th of January following, that the
Nabob could be prevailed on to dismiss
his scruples; nor, until threatened with
the severest displeasure of the Governor
General, that he could be compelled to
repair to Fyzyabad, to obey the unnatural
mandate, by plundering his parents. A
resistance was then made by the friends
of the Begums, on finding the violence
intended to them. But, strange to tell!
this resistance was absolutely alledged by
Mr. Hastings in his defence, as the sole
cause of the violence! That is to say, the
resistance of an unjust attack not made
until after the 8th of January, 1782, was
alledged as the foundation of the pleasure
signified on the 27th of November, 1781,
of the written order by which that was
enforced, and all the determinations which
had so long preceded! Or, in other
words, the order was said to be founded
on a resistance made to its being executed,
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
near six weeks after that order was first
issued.</P>
<P>Having gone through the facts of the
transactions which made up the charge,
<HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> next adverted to the affida∣vits
exhibited, and sworn before Sir Eli∣jah
Impey; and though he said he might
fairly throw them aside, and put them out
of the question, on account of the indirect
manner in which they were obtained, and
the strange and irrelevant testimony
they afforded, yet he would wave all
objection to them on those grounds, and
examine them with as much seriousness,
as if they were correctly formal, and
every way unexceptionable; they were
all, he said, conceived in one spirit, and
formed upon one plan. He then read
the Affidavit of Mr. Middleton, and
clearly pointed out how futile and pre∣sumptuous
were the grounds upon
which he had, <HI>to the satisfaction of his
conscience,</HI> proceeded to the utmost ex∣tremity
of violence against the Begums.
<Q>The God of Justice, exclaimed he,
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>
forbid that any man in this House
should make up his mind to accuse
Mr. Hastings on the ground that
Mr. Middleton condemned the Be∣gums.</Q>
He next animadverted on
the depositions of Colonel Hannay, Co∣lonel
Gordon, Major M`Donald, Major
Williams, and others, from which he
struck out a variety of such brilliant
detections as baffle memory to follow.</P>
<P>Amongst a variety of glaring circum∣stances
he pointed out the following:</P>
<P>Major Williams, amidst other ru∣mours,
stated one that "<HI>he had heard:</HI>"
That 50 British troops, watching 200
prisoners, had been surrounded by
6000 of the enemy, and must inevitably
have fallen a sacrifice, if they had not
been relieved by the approach of a de∣tachment
of <HI>nine</HI> men. With this
assistance they had entirely driven away
the enemy, and slain several hundreds
of them. Considering the character
given by Mr. H. to the British army in
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
Oude, that they manifested a rage for
rapacity and peculation; it was extra∣ordinary
that there were no instances of
stouter swearing. Of Mr. M. he said,
that he liked not the memory which
remembered things better at the end of
five years, than at the time, unless there
might be something so relaxing in the
climate of India, affecting the memory
as well as the nerves, by which the
traces of actions were lost; and that
men must return to their native air of
England and be braced up, and have
their memories like their sinews, re∣strung.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan pointed out many other
improbabilities, and having in very
strong colours painted the loose quality
of the affidavits, and clearly and incon∣trovertibly
shewn the partiality and in∣justice,
which was contained in them
against the Begums, he solemnly ap∣pealed
to that side of the House which
was more peculiarly interested in law-proceedings.
They saw that, that House
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>
was the path to fortune in their pro∣fession;
that they might soon, and some
of them were, to be called to a dignified
situation, where the great and impor∣tant
trust would be reposed in them, of
protecting the lives and properties of
their fellow-subjects.</P>
<P>One learned gentleman in particu∣lar,
was, if rumour spoke right, soon
to be called to succeed that bright lu∣minary
of the law, whose sun he feared
was setting, but whose departure from
the seat of active justice was splendid
and magnificent, in its being done while
he possessed a mind on which time had
not power to lay his hand: Of the
learned Gentleman, the successor, he
must say, that there was not one cir∣cumstance
of his life, except perhaps his
activity on an election contest, that did
not distinguish him as a most proper
person to fill the important seat. He
desired to ask that learned Gentleman,
and every other of the profession, would
he lay his hand upon his breast, and
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
solemnly declare, if upon such evidence
as the mass of depositions taken at
Lucknow, any one of them could ven∣ture
to say that, sitting as a Judge, he
would be legally warranted to convict
any, the meanest individual of an of∣fence,
however trivial. If any one would
say he could, he declared to God he
would sit down, and not add a syllable
more to the too long trespass he had
made on the patience of the committee.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Sheridan craved the indul∣gence
of the House (<HI>a general and loud
cry of hear! hear!</HI>) whilst he for a mo∣ment
enquired into the <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI>
of the affidavits, on which the ruin of the
unfortunate Begums was founded. <HI>Colo∣nel
Gordon</HI> had exhibited a flagrantly con∣spicuous
proof of the <HI>grateful spirit and
temper</HI> of affidavits, designed to plunge
these wretched women in irretrievable
ruin. Colonel Gordon was but just before
<HI>not merely released from danger,</HI> but <HI>pre∣served
from imminent death.</HI> That gentle∣man
was in the hands of the insurgents,
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
and his release was entirely effected by
the negociation of the Bhow Begum. Yet
even at the expiration of two little days
from his deliverance, he deposes against
the distressed and unfortunate woman, who
had become his <HI>saviour;</HI> and <HI>only</HI> upon
<HI>hearsay evidence,</HI> accuses her of crimes
and rebellion. Upon this occasion she
manifested the strongest attachment to
the English interest; for, in her pri∣vate
letters and dispatches to Colonel
Hannay, she particularly desired that the
Zemindars might not be informed of her
interposition in favor of the Colonel:
this was at once a bold and convincing
proof of her unalterable attachment.
Was this a proof of rebellion? <Q><HI>Great
God of justice,</HI> (exclaimed the orator)
<HI>canst thou from thy eternal throne look
down upon such premeditated turpitude of
heart, and not fix some dreadful mark
of obloquy upon the perpetrators?</HI></Q></P>
<P>If, continues Mr. Sheridan, these af∣fidavits,
because they are a mere collec∣tion
of hearsays, without a tittle of any
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
thing like legal evidence in their composi∣tion,
could not (as I am certain is the
case) be received in a court of law, nor
be brought forward in a court of equity,
was it a species of evidence sufficient to
justify a wanton act of oppression, of vio∣lence
and gross injustice, committed a∣gainst
two princesses; the one the wife,
the other the mother of the deceased
Nabob <HI>Sujah ul Dowlah.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hastings asserts, that the resump∣tion
of the Jaghires was no injury to the
Begums, for they had their revenue of
them delivered regularly.—But that was
not truth.—They never had an equiva∣lent
—they were referred for payment to a
bankrupt, on the faith of a broken gua∣rantee.
There never was any informa∣tion
that could warrant the seizure of
the Jaghires. It was not done with the
consent of the Nabob, though he was
forced by Mr. Middleton to give his no∣minal
assent thereto; for Mr. Middleton
had written to Mr. Hastings, that <HI>a fixed
melancholy had seized the Nabob, on his
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
being forced to plunder his mother.</HI> Mr.
Middleton had written to Mr. Hastings
for his orders, on the 1st of December,
1781, which arrived on the 6th, and on
the 29th of the same month the whole
was put in execution; but as they per∣fectly
knew it was a matter that of course
must make much noise, it was deemed
necessary by Mr. Hastings and his party,
to throw the whole of the odium on the
Nabob, by insisting that the proposition
came from him.—But the very letter in
which it was asserted that, the Nabob
had not only given his consent, but even
proposed this detestable measure, could
not be produced; nor any one paper, arti∣cle
or authentic evidence to that effect,
notwithstanding the industry with which
it had been reported.</P>
<P>The Nabob in his letter to Mr. Hast∣ings,
never gave the least hint, that either
his mother or grandmother were in re∣bellion,
or that they had shewn an incli∣nation
to assist or join with <HI>Cheyt Sing,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
or that they meant to extirpate the En∣glish,
or dethrone him.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan proceeded to demonstrate,
that the princesses were in every sense of
the word, entitled to their Jaghires and
possessions, as much as any lady in Eng∣land
to her dower, on the death of her
Lord. That this opinion had not so much
as been called in question, till the time
that Mr. Hastings began to set his heart
upon their treasures;—and that asserting
the contrary, under the Mahomedan law,
was neither founded in justice, reason, nor
even that law, and this, Mr. Sheridan
proved beyond the power of contradiction.</P>
<P>He then shewed, from a variety of
statements from Mr. Hastings's own pa∣pers,
that the Nabob never entertained an
idea that the possessions of his mother
were his, during her life—on the con∣trary,
that his father <HI>Sujah ul Dowlah,</HI> had
left her in the tranquil possession of those
estates and treasures, for the mere purpose
of supporting her dignity in the stile be∣coming
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
her rank and birth.—Mr. She∣ridan
observed, that when <HI>Asoph ul Dowla</HI>
blamed his father for leaving so little
wealth, he thought like an unwise prince—
His father Sujah ul Dowla acted prudent∣ly,
in leaving him with no temptation
about him, to invite acts of violence from
the rapacious. <Q>He cloathed him with
poverty as a shield, and armed him
with necessity as a sword.</Q></P>
<P>In consequence of his poverty and dis∣tresses,
the <HI>Bhow Begum</HI> his mother it
was true, made her son many presents,
and even lent him money, for which he
had given an equivalent; and once, on
his representing his distressed situation,
she had returned all his pledges and a
very large sum of money, such as she
thought would finally put an end to his
distresses. The Nabob her son had
given a receipt to that effect, which re∣ceipt
was read by Mr. Sheridan, who
strongly pointed out the obligation he was
under to her. He then enlarged upon the
character and estimation in which the
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
Princesses were held, and in the most pa∣thetic
language, dwelt on the purity of
their conduct, the reciprocal return of
filial and parental affection.</P>
<P>When Mr. Middleton went to seize Fy∣zyabad,
the eunuchs were taken prisoners,
as was the Fouzder of Tanda; him how∣ever,
it was not thought necessary to de∣tain;
he had not the key of the treasure;
the eunuchs had that, and they of couse
were the principal objects.—It was assert∣ed
that the Nabob gave puerile excuses for
not plundering his mother.—Reasons for
not performing the worst of actions, the
most unnatural crime, that of a child ruin∣ing
his parent, was by a Christian Gover∣nor
thought puerile.—Was it to be sup∣posed
that, two old, infirm women, whose
whole dependence was on the British pos∣session,
one of whom had been a witness
of the success of the British arms, for the
British arms had deposed her husband,
Sujah ul Dowlah, and British generosity
had again placed him in his dominions,
should wish to extirpate the English?—
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
Saib Ally's behaviour was passed over,
as having done more good, by preserving
a few prisoners, than he had done harm;
Why was not the same favour shewn to
the Begums? When the foot of the op∣pressor
was taken off, the trodden on rose
against the persecutor, as against another
Sujah. What a miserable situation must
the poor unfortunate wretches be in,
to have those for their judges, who would
benefit by their destruction!</P>
<P>When the Court of Directors sent to
Mr. Hastings, to revise the charge against
the Begums, and Mr. Stables moved that
revision in council, he was over-ruled by
Mr. Hastings, who said, that <Q><HI>the ma∣jesty
of justice ought to be approached
with solicitation, and that it would debase
itself by the suggestion of wrongs, and the
promise of redress.</HI></Q>—Conscious however
of the enormity of his conduct, he apolo∣gizes
to the Court of Directors, by stating,
that it would be "<HI>a very severe task for a
mother to impeach her son;</HI>"—so that ac∣cording
to his idea, it was no crime for a
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
son to rob and plunder his parents, but it
was a crime of a very deep dye, for an in∣jured
parent to complain of the outrage
of her child.</P>
<P>He next proceeded to shew, that Mr.
Hastings, and <HI>he alone,</HI> was the actor
and perpetrator of those crimes. That
he was regularly acquainted with all the
enormities committed, there was the clear∣est
proof. It was true that Middleton
was rebuked for not being more exact.
He did not, perhaps, descend to the de∣tail;
he did not give him an account of
the number of groans, which were heaved,
of the quantity of tears which were shed,
of the weight of the fetters, or of the
depth of the dungeons; but he communi∣cated
every step that he took to accom∣plish
the base and unwarrantable end. He
proved by his letters, dated in Jan. 1782,
that he alone was responsible for the whole
proceedings. Mr. Hastings well knew that,
the ja ghire and the treasure were the only
means which the Begums were in pos∣session
of, to support the numerous family
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
of the late Nabob, amounting to more
than two thousand persons.</P>
<P>After having in the most pathetic and
forcible manner given an affecting des∣cription
of the distresses of these unfor∣tunate
princesses, he went farther into the
exposure of the evidence; into a compa∣rison
of dates and the subsequent cir∣cumstances,
in order to prove that, all the
enormous consequences that followed from
the resumption, in the captivity of the
women and the imprisonment and cruel∣ties
practised upon their people, were solely
to be ascribed and imputed to <HI>Mr. Hast∣ings.</HI>
He said that Mr. Hastings had
once remarked, <Q>that a mind touched
with superstition might have contem∣plated
the fate of the Rohillas with
peculiar impressions.</Q> But if indeed the
mind of Mr. Hastings had been touched
with superstition; if <HI>his</HI> fancy could suffer
any disturbance, and even in vision, he could
imagine that he beheld the great spirit
of <HI>Sujah Dowlah</HI> looking down on the
ruin he had wrought on his house—in
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
that palace which Mr. Hastings had first
wrested from his hand, and afterwards
restored to him;—plundered by that
very army, by which Sujah Dowlah had
been able to vanquish the Mahrattas—
seizing on the very plunder which he had
ravaged from the Rohillas;—<HI>that</HI> MID∣DLETON
who had been engaged in ma∣naging
the previous violations, most busy
to perpetrate the last; <HI>that very</HI> HAST∣INGS,
whom on his death-bed he
had left the guardian of his wife and
mother, and family; turning all those
dear relatives, the objects of his solemn
trust, forth to the merciless season, and
to a more merciless soldiery!—A mind
touched with superstition, must indeed
have cherished such a contemplation with
very peculiar impressions.</P>
<P>Mr. Hastings had endeavoured to throw
a portion of the guilt upon the Council,
although Mr. Wheeler had never taken
any share, and Mr. M`Pherson was not
arrived in India when the scene began.
<HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> remarked, that he had
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
shrunk from the inquiry ordered by the
Court of Directors under the new, and
pompous doctrine, that the majesty of
justice was to be approached with suppli∣cation,
and was not to degrade itself, by
hunting for crimes. If his picture of
justice was right, then the Committees
of this House, in the examination of
Smith, were wrong—Mr. Dundas was
wrong.—He hoped however, that Mr.
Hastings would be found wrong.</P>
<P><Q>I trust, said the eloquent Speaker,
that this House will vindicate the in∣sulted
character of justice,—that they
will demonstrate its true quality, essence,
and purposes,—that they will evidence
it to be, in the case of Mr. Hastings,
<HI>active, inquisitive,</HI> and <HI>avenging.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> having in the course of
his wonderful Speech taken a most com∣prehensive
view of the business, and ex∣amined
with the most elaborate re∣search
and scrutinizing attention, every
circumstance with which it was con∣nected;
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
having urged every thing which
he thought necessary to develope the
iniquitous conduct of Mr. Hastings, to
substantiate the charge, and to establish
it by the incontrovertible evidence of
an infinity of facts; he drew towards a
conclusion, by stating a summary of the
great points contained in it. He con∣tended
and maintained that it was evi∣dent
the Begums had done nothing to
merit such violence, that the pretence
of their having been the fomenters of
rebellion, with a view to exterminate
the English from the province of Oude,
was a mere pretence, wholly unfound∣ed,
and not supported by any evi∣dence,
and that such an idea had never
been conceived, until Mr. Hastings con∣cluded
that to be the probable means, and
a favourite resource for the obtainment of
money,—a resource that he was deter∣mined,
in defiance of reason, justice,
and humanity, and at all events, to
make certain of. Mr. Hastings had violat∣ed
the the solemn guarantee of the Company,
and had broken their faith, pledged by
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
treaty; he had throughout his conduct
been guided by baseness, falsehood, and
oppression; entering into treaties, and
framing stipulations, which at the mo∣ment
he was concluding and agreeing
upon, he had no purpose of fulfilling.
—Mr. Hastings had degraded and sunk
the dignity and character of the highest
and most honourable office, that of a
<HI>Chief Justice,</HI> by making <HI>Sir Elijah
Impey</HI> run about the country collecting
affidavits.—He had, by paltry quib∣bles,
and pitiful evasions, neglected to
proceed upon the enquiry directed by
the Board at the India-House; taking a
mean advantage of the Directors orders,
and had cloathed that evasion with a
pompous parade of words, and a ridi∣culous
display of nonsensical phrases on
the majesty of Justice.—That through
the whole of the transaction the con∣duct
of the Governor-General had been
marked with the most scandalous du∣plicity,
the basest perfidy, the most
unparalleled and grinding oppression,
and the most insolent, wanton, and un∣manly
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
cruelty.—He had made a son
plunder his mother and grand-mother,
and reduced to distress two princesses
of high rank;—he had sullied and dis∣graced
the British name and character.</P>
<P>Mr. Hastings, he observed, was a
man of wonderful prescience, for it was
evident that he knew nothing of what
would lend his conduct a colour of jus∣tification,
till after it was over; but he
<HI>foresaw</HI> that there would be proof of a
rebellion, and,—strange to tell!—it turn∣ed
out exactly as he predicted.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> then made a solemn
appeal to the House, conveyed in such
a sublime and astonishing stile of ele∣gance,
and worked up with such pathos
and dignity, in such fascinating lan∣guage,
that the House was wrapped in
mute attention: To keep way with him
through such a rapid stream of elo∣quence,
desies all power of retention:
it was wholly impracticable to do more
than watch the current as it flowed,
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
and now and then casually to grasp
some passing flowers, within our reach.</P>
<P>He stated to the House, that the mat∣ter
of charge was no question of party.
Factions and parties, he knew, existed
in that house. The prerogative of the
Crown found its advocates among the
people's representatives. The privileges of
the people met with their opponents.
Habits, connections, parties, all led to a
diversity of opinions. The measures of
every minister were supported by one body
of men, and thwarted by another; but on
great questions, they had, he was happy to
remark, often distinguished themselves, by
laying aside all petty party considerations,
and acting with a firmness and decision
that reflected honour upon their cha∣racter.
—When Inhumanity presented
itself, when the majesty of Justice was
to be supported, he trusted no division
could be found among them. When
the former became the object of their
attention, they would sit upon it as their
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
common enemy, as if the character of
the land were involved in their zeal for
its ruin, and they would leave it not,
till it was completely overthrown.—He
hoped they would now step forward, re∣gardless
of the minister,—regardless of
the influence of the Crown,—and vote
against the most enormous crimes that
ever disgraced human nature.—On the
present occasion, they were called upon
to retrieve millions of their fellow crea∣tures
from a state of misery and oppres∣sion.
It was true, they could not see the
innumerable beings, whose wretchedness
they would relieve; the multitudes of
famished females had not reached the
House, and terrified it into a contempla∣tion
of their miseries; but for that reason,
the more magnanimous would their con∣duct
be, the more glorious their determi∣nation
to punish such delinquency. Was
a British Parliament to wait for their bar
to be surrounded with the screams of
expiring children, and the shrieks of starv∣ing
women, before they stooped to redress
their grievances?—No—Let the world
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
behold an example, that the Commons
of Great-Britain will stretch the strong
arm of justice across the habitable globe,
to shew in glowing colours the greatness
and power of a British Parliament, in
reprobating injustice, in stigmatizing in∣humanity,
and in delivering over to con∣dign
punishment, those who used unlimit∣ed
power, merely for the purposes of ty∣ranny,
oppression, rapacity, and perfidy.
It was not given to that House, as it was to
the officers who had the felicity to relieve,
and the still greater transport of a sus∣ceptible
mind, to perceive the extatic
emotions of gratitude in the instant of
deliverance. They could not behold the
workings of the heart, the quivering lips,
the trickling tears, the loud, though tre∣mulous
joys of the millions, whom their
vote that night would snatch from the
tyranny of <HI>corrupt power.</HI> But, though
these circumstances were not perceptible
to them, was not the true enjoyment of
benevolence encreased, by the blessing
being conferred unseen: Would not the
<HI>omnipotence of British justice, and a British
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
Parliament</HI> be demonstrated, to the wonder
of nations, by stretching its mighty arm
across the Globe, and saving by its <HI>fiat</HI>
millions from destruction! And would
the blessings of the people, thus saved,
diffuse in empty air! No!—<Q>Heaven,
says he, if I may dare to use the figure,
—Heaven itself shall become the Agent
to receive the blessings of their pious
gratitude, and to waft them to your
bosoms.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan returned his warmest
thanks to the House for the indulgence
he had experienced in a speech that car∣ried
him beyond the limits of his strength;
but he trusted, that strength would soon
be repaired, from the consideration of
having endeavoured to discharge his duty
in the support of untainted innocence.</P>
<P>He then concluded,</P>
<P><Q>It is with confidence I now move
Sir, that Warren Hastings be impeach∣ed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="76"/>
The question was then read by the
clerk to the following purpose:</P>
<P><Q>That the Committee, upon hearing
evidence, and considering the said charge,
are of opinion, that there is sufficient
ground to impeach Warren Hastings,
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of High Crimes and Misdemean∣ours,
upon the matter of the said
charge,</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Burgess</HI> spoke for nearly an hour
in defence of Mr. Hastings, which de∣fence
he grounded on the 10th report,
when</P>
<P><HI>Sir William Dolben</HI> rose, and observed,
that Mr. Sheridan having in his speech
stated in so able a manner, such a variety
of facts and arguments, as must have ex∣hausted
the spirits, as well as the atten∣tion
of the Committee, he therefore re∣commended
an adjournment.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Stanhope</HI> was of the same opinion,
and was determined not to give his vote,
till he had again collected his reason, and
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
had given the subject a new and serious
consideration.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Fox</HI> argued against the adjourn∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>Major Scott</HI> rose, and accused Mr. She∣ridan
of having been guilty of <HI>most gross
misrepresentations;</HI> that in referring to se∣veral
parts of the correspondence relative
to the Begums, <HI>he had omitted several parts
of the letters,</HI> and offered to proceed to the
proof, when</P>
<P><HI>The Chancellor of the Exchequer,</HI> in a
very candid and liberal manner, passed
many deserving and high encomiums on
Mr. Sheridan's speech, and was strenuous
for the adjournment.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Fox</HI> replied to Mr. Pitt, and in a
speech of some length, still opposed any
adjournment:—this brought up</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Wilberforce,</HI> who, for similar rea∣sons
with Mr. Pitt, Sir William Dolben,
and Mr. Stanhope, was anxious to ad∣journ.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="78"/>
<HI>Mr. Fox</HI> rose to explain, and amongst
other things said, that an adjournment
would certainly impress the public mind
with a very unfavourable opinion of Mr.
Hastings's cause.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> said, that he should not
again have troubled the Committee, had
it not been to clear up a foul, and he must
say, an unjust aspersion cast against him,
of <HI>misrepresenting,</HI> or of not reading the
evidence faithfully; he protested that he
had not, to the best of his knowledge,
omitted a single sentence that was mate∣rial;
and that his wish was, to state the
whole faithfully; as to the adjournment,
the Committee would see his reason for
not saying any thing on the subject.
<HI>Mr. Martin, Mr. Montague,</HI> and <HI>Mr. St.
John,</HI> severally spoke, when</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> rose a third time, and
said, that if Gentlemen really meant to
press it to a decision, he did not wish to
take the sense of the House on the ques∣tion
of adjournment.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="79"/>
<HI>Sir William Dolben</HI>'s motion was then
read, and passed without a division; and
the Speaker having resumed the chair, the
House adjourned at half past <HI>One.</HI></P>
<Q>THURSDAY the 8th.</Q>
<P>The House having met, and resolved
itself into a Committee, the subject was
resumed. <HI>Mr. Pitt</HI> bore a conspicuous
part in the debate. At the conclusion
of his speech,</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Sheridan</HI> rose, and said, that after
the extraordinary indulgence which he
had the honour to experience last night,
he would now trespass but a few minutes
on their time. He felt himself, however,
called upon to congratulate the Right Hon.
Gentleman, <HI>(Mr. Pitt,)</HI> on the very able,
candid, and manly, manner in which he
had delivered his sentiments on that occa∣sion.
He congratulated the House, he
congratulated his country, that in the
cause of humanity, they saw a Minister
who was not to be biassed by any motives
<PB N="75" REF="80"/>
of political interest, who by his conduct
on that day, had placed his character
above the reach of suspicion. He was
not so vain as to imagine, that any argu∣ments
he had advanced on the subject
had made any impression on the Right
Honourable Gentleman's mind; if they
had, it was more a tribute to the cause of
truth and justice than a compliment to
him.</P>
<P>With respect to what the Hon. Gen∣tleman
(Major Scott) had mentioned, of
his being alluded to as one of the <HI>depend∣ents</HI>
of Mr. Hastings, Mr. Sheridan de∣clared
upon his honour, that, if he made
use of such an expression, he had not the
smallest intention of conveying any insi∣nuation
that tended to reflect on the Hon.
Gentleman. He had every allowance to
make for opinions that were formed on
the prejudices of human nature. He was
not surprised that the Hon. Gentleman
viewed the conduct of Mr. Hastings in a
light different from other men, for when
the <HI>heart</HI> acknowledged an obligation, it
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
would never suffer the <HI>judgment</HI> to be in∣fluenced
by it. If he had uttered harsh
expressions, he declared they were not the
result of malignity, or the offspring of
vindictive malice;—he thanked God, he
had a heart incapable of cherishing either,
and, if he had spoken warmly, it was on
a question which, he confessed had deep∣ly
agitated his mind and excited his feel∣ings.
That question would soon come
before another tribunal, and which would
decide between the House of Commons
and Mr. Hastings.</P>
<P>Several other Gentlemen having spoken,
the question was at last put, and the
house divided, when the numbers were,
