<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Here present the Reader with a Volume of Letters writ up∣on very different Occasions, at very different Times. They are far from being all of them equal, but I hope their Variety will make amends for their Inequality. I make no doubt but that upon perusal of the Cri∣tical part of them, the old Accusation will be brought against me, and there will be a fresh Outcry among Thought∣less People, that I am an Ill-natur'd Man. 'Tis very odd that I should have that Character only from Persons who never knew me, and who never were once in my Company. But there are People in the World who imagine that Criticism must be the Effect of Ill na∣ture. These Persons know not what is meant by either of the Terms, either
<PB REF="5"/>
Criticism or Ill-nature; otherwise they would be convinced that a good Criti∣cism is the best-natur'd thing in the World. For by Goodness of Nature must be meant something that comes up to the true Nature of Man; else it would be a Term of Reproach, instead of Commendation. But the true Na∣ture of Man is a Reasonable and a Social Nature. And a good Criticism, is both Reasonable and Social. It detects Er∣ror, illustrates Truth, advances Art, and consequently has a direct Tendency to the Advancement of the national Ho∣nour. If this last is true of good Criti∣cism in general, it must be most true of a just Criticism upon the Tragedy of <HI>Cato.</HI> That Tragedy met with Success which never any other did. It was act∣ed for a Month together. It has been translated into <HI>French,</HI> and into <HI>Italian,</HI> which never happen'd to any of our Dramatick Poems before. And 'tis plain to all the Judges of Poetry, that it has a Thousand shameful Faults, and very
<PB REF="6"/>
few natural Beauties. What must the Knowers in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> say, upon reading these Translations? Must they not Discourse after this Manner? The <HI>English</HI> Nation boast much of their Poe∣try; they extol to the Skies, their <HI>Shakespear,</HI> their <HI>Ben Johnson,</HI> their <HI>Mil∣ton</HI>: But yet they applaud nothing so loudly as this Tragedy of <HI>Cato.</HI> They have got it translated both into <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> and have sent it to us as a Master-Piece to Insult us. Else why has this Tragedy only been translated? And yet this Tragedy, at the same time that it has a Thousand Faults, and most of them very gross ones; has very few Beauties, and those which it has are perhaps not of <HI>British</HI> Growth, but are deriv'd from <HI>Lu∣can</HI> and <HI>Seneca.</HI> What then must we think of those other Poets, their <HI>Shake∣spear,</HI> their <HI>Ben Johnson,</HI> their <HI>Milton,</HI> whom they formerly so much extol'd, but not half so much as <HI>Cato?</HI> Must we not conclude, that these Islanders are
<PB REF="7"/>
very indifferent Poets, and more indiffe∣rent Judges?</P>
<P>I appeal to the reasonable and im∣partial Reader, if this must not be the Sense of all the knowing <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> who have seen these Translati∣ons. Let the reasonable and impartial Reader judge then, if a just Criticism upon <HI>Cato</HI> was not absolutely necessary, both for the Advantage of Dramatick Poetry, to which the undeserv'd Success of this Tragedy has done infinite Harm, and for the Vindication of the National Honour; let the Reader judge, if it was not necessary, that a Man who owns that he admires the noble Genius of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> admires the unparallell'd Sublimity of the <HI>Paradise Lost</HI> of <HI>Mil∣ton,</HI> that he is infinitely pleas'd with the Master-Pieces of <HI>Ben Johnson,</HI> and exceed∣ingly delighted with several of our other Comick Poets, should give his Reasons to all the World why he has no Esteem for <HI>Cato?</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
If what I have said is not sufficient to appease the Fury of a Headlong Cabal; but they will still cry out that the Criti∣cal Letters in this Volume upon the Tra∣gedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> are the Effects of Ill-na∣ture, I must beg leave to exclaim in my turn, that those Persons, let them be who they will, shew a deplorable want of publick Spirit, who can prefer the Reputation of one Man, and a Reputati∣on which he does not deserve to possess, before the Advantage of a noble Art, and the Honour of their Country.</P>
<P>But perhaps 'tis not the Author of <HI>Cato</HI> that these Persons are so much concern'd for, 'tis themselves. 'Tis themselves and their own Satisfaction, which they prefer to the Prosperity of the Commonwealth of Learning, and to the Good and Ho∣nour of their Country. There are in the World very vain Persons, who are resolv'd to maintain the good Opinion which they have of themselves, at the Expence of every thing, and utterly de∣test
<PB REF="9"/>
the Man who shall dare to disturb them in the Possession of it, by shewing them that they have pass'd a very foolish Judgment.</P>
<P>If any are disgusted that these Obser∣vations are publish'd after the Death of the Author of that Tragedy, I can assure them, that they were writ in two long Letters to a Friend immediately after the REMARKS which were printed. By what Artifice those two Letters were got out of my Hands, by what Fortune I re∣covered the Substance of them, and how it came to take the form which it now has, I shall not here declare; not the first, thro' regard to the Memory of the Dead; nor the two latter, thro' Respect to the precious Time of the Living.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave of this Subject I think my self oblig'd to do Justice to the Memory of Mr. ADDISON, who was certainly a Learned and very Ingeni∣ous Man: And several of the <HI>Tatlers</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>
and <HI>Spectators</HI> which were writ by him de∣serv'd the Applause which they met with.</P>
<P>I hope that what I have said will suf∣fice to satisfy every reasonable Impartial Reader, who is a true Lover of His Country. For the rest, I have long since learnt to esteem their Censures according to their just Value.</P>

<HEAD>TO Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Moral and Conclusion of an <HI>Epick Poem.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I sent you my Observations, upon the Two first Acts of the Play, I sent you so many Reasons which oblig'd me to differ from you, with respect to the Encomium, which you give to that Tragedy, in your <HI>Essay</HI> upon <HI>Epick Poetry.</HI> And whenever you think fit to lay your Com∣mands upon me, I shall lay before you the Rea∣sons, for which I dissent from you, with regard to the Commendation which you give to a <HI>late Translation.</HI> At present I shall pass to Things more general, and consequently of far great Importance.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="16"/>
IN the Chapter which treats of the Moral, you are pleased to affirm two Things; The first is, That one who writes an Epick Poem, need not in his first Intention, pitch upon some con∣siderable Moral, and then contrive his Fable suit∣able to that Design; The Second Thing is, That there is no occasion that an Epick Poem should end Fortunately with regard to the Principal Cha∣racter.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, before I give my Reasons for dis∣senting from you, with regard to these Two Points; the first of which is of Consequence, and the Second of the utmost Importance: I desire that you would give me leave to enumerate some Things, in which we perfectly Agree; that by this Method, we may facilitate an Agreement in Things in which we Differ.</P>
<P>We agree then, Sir, in the following Points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there must be a Fable. <HI>Essay.</HI> p. 37.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there must be an Action. <HI>Ess.</HI> p. 47.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Action must be one. p. <HI>ibid.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That there must be a Moral. p. 76.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the Fable and the Action must be only for the Moral. <HI>Ibid.</HI> &amp; p. 34.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That the Moral must be the genuine Re∣sult of the Fable and the Action. p. 77.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That Admiration ought to be the predo∣minant Passion in the narration of the Action. p. 33.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Nothing that is common or ordinary, can excite Admiration. p. 34 &amp; 35.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That there ought to be an Allegory. p. 41.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="3" REF="17"/>
THESE, Sir, are Things in which we agree ex∣presly: There are other Things in which we agree implicitly, because if these last are false, they de∣stroy the Truth even of those in which we agree expresly; as that</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Moral must contain an undeniable Truth, or else it cannot be a Moral: For Falshood may delude, but only Truth can instruct.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Instruction which the Poem gives, must be general; Moral Philosophy being the Law of Nature, and consequently, instructive to Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Poetick Action must remain ge∣neral, even after the Imposition of Names; for if the Action is particular, there can be no ge∣neral Instruction deduced from it; the Conclu∣sion being false to generals from particulars.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That for the same Reason, the Characters at the bottom must be general likewise, even after the Imposition of Names.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the Action and Characters being both general, even after the Imposition of Names, they must be, consequently, both Allegorical.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>LET us come now, Sir, to the two foremen∣tion'd Particulars.</P>
<P>YOU say, That an Epick Poet is not oblig'd to have the Moral first in his Mind: For, say you, no Author can form the Narration of any great and memorable Action, but some Moral
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
will arise from it, whether the Writer intends it or not. Suppose this were true, a Poet is to In∣struct by his Art and not by Chance. But the very contrary of this is true, a Poet may form the Narration, of a Hundred great and memorable Actions, if these Actions are Particular and Hi∣storical, and not one Moral shall arise from them all; as the Battle of <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> the Death of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius,</HI> the Death of <HI>Cato,</HI> the Death of King <HI>Lear,</HI> the Death of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> the Death of <HI>Harry</HI> the Fourth: And I defie any Poet to form a general Action, and general Cha∣racters, but he must form them upon a Moral, and consequently that Moral must be first in his Head. Can any one believe, that <HI>Aesop</HI> first told a Story of a Cock and a Bull, and afterwards made a Moral to it? Or is it reasonable to be∣lieve, that he made his Moral first, and after∣wards to prove it, contriv'd his Fable? Now I know no difference that there is, between one of <HI>Aesop</HI>'s Fables, and the Fable of an Epick Poem, as to their Natures, tho' there be many and great ones, as to their Circumstances. 'Tis impossible for a Poet to form any Fable, unless the Moral be first in his Head.</P>
<P>YOU say that since <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> does not expresly draw any Doctrine from their Fables, it is not certain whether they design'd any; and it is still more uncertain, you say, whether they intended those particular Morals, which are ge∣nerally ascrib'd to them; which is as much as to say, that, tho' we can see a Design, a good, a just, and a great Design in those admirable Poems,
<PB N="5" REF="19"/>
yet the Authors of them saw none, and that, per∣haps that is not their Design, which appears to us and others, but something, which after so many Ages, has appeared to no Man. Could <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> if they had studied a Thousand Years, have contrived Morals, which would have been more the genuine result of all the Parts of their Fables and of their Actions, than those which are generally ascribed to them? Or can those Morals be made to appear the genuine result of any other Poetick Actions, unless they are Copies of those?</P>
<P>YOU continue to say, That as from Pulpit Discourses on Divine Subjects, many useful In∣ferences may be deduc'd by the Preacher; so in these superior Poems, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But here, Sir, you ap∣pear not to consider, that the grand Moral of every Sermon is the Text, which certainly is, or ought to be, first in the Mind of every Preacher.</P>
<P>TO conclude my Remarks on this first Point; it appears to me evident, that every Man who undertakes any great Action, has the chief De∣sign which he proposes by it, first of all in his Head; but you yourself are pleased to own, p. 34. <HI>That the principal End of an Epick Poet, is to give Pleasure and Instruction</HI>; and p. 76. <HI>That the Pleasure is only in order to the Instru∣ction</HI>; and p. 77. <HI>That the most important part of the Instruction ought to arise from the whole Fable, because the Instruction that arises from the whole, must be more important than that which arises from the Parts.</HI> By owning all
<PB N="6" REF="20"/>
which, it is clear to me that you implicitly own, That the Moral of an Epick Poem must be first in the Head of the Poet.</P>
<P>I now, Sir, come to the Second Point, con∣cerning which we differ. You are pleas'd to affirm, That it is not necessary, that an Epick Poem should end happily, with relation to the Principal Character, but that the Poets and mere Criticks have laid down this Rule, without con∣sulting Reason in the Case, being led into it by the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odysses</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the <HI>Aeneis</HI> of <HI>Virgil:</HI> And here you deplore that servile Sub∣mission which the Poets and Commentators have made to naked Anthority, by which they have advanc'd Maxims out of Reverence to great Names, without any Discussion of the Subject, or entering upon any Enquiry which supports their Assertion; because, say you, the End of the Epick Poet may be equally attain'd, tho' the Event should be Unfortunate; into which we are now to Enquire.</P>
<P>THE principal Character of an Epick Poem, must be either morally good or morally vicious; if he is morally good, the making him end un∣fortunately, will destroy all Poetical Justice, and consequently, all Instruction: Such a Poem can have no Moral, and consequently no Fable, no just and regular Poetical Action, but must be a vain Fiction and an empty Amusement. Oh, but there is a Retribution in Futurity! But I thought that the Reader of an Epick Poem was to owe his Instruction to the Poet, and not to
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
himself: Well then, the Poet may tell him so at the latter end of his Poem: Ay, would to God I could see such a latter End of an Epick Poem, where the Poet should tell the Reader, that he has cut an honest Man's Throat, only that he may have an Opportunity to send him to Heaven; and that tho' this would be but an indifferent Plea upon an Indictment for Murder at the Old-Baily, yet that he hopes the good-natur'd Reader will have Compassion on him, as the Gods have on his Hero. But Raillery apart, Sir, What occa∣sion is there for having recourse to an Epick Poet to tell our selves by the bye, and by occasional Re∣flection, that there will be a Retribution in Futu∣rity, when the Christian has this in his Heart constantly and directly, and the Atheist and Free∣thinker will make no such Reflection? Tell me truly, Sir, would not such a Poet appear to you or me, not to have sufficiently consider'd what a Poetical Moral is? And should not you, or I Sir, be oblig'd, in order to make him comprehend the Nature of it, to lay before him that universal Moral, which is the Foundation of all Morals, both Epick and Dramatick, and is inclusive of them all, and that is, That He who does good, and perseveres in it, shall always be Rewarded, and he who does ill and perseveres in it, shall always be punish'd? Should we not desire him to observe, That the foresaid Reward must always attend and crown good Actions, not sometimes only, for then it would follow, that sometimes a perseverance in good Actions has no Reward, which would take away all Poetical Instruction,
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
and indeed every sort of Moral Instruction, re∣solving Providence into Chance or Fate. Should we not, Sir, farther put him in Mind, that since whoever perseveres in good Actions, is sure to be Rewarded at the last, it follows, that a Poet does not assert by his Moral, that he is always sure to be Rewarded in this World, because that would be false, as you have very justly observ'd, <HI>p.</HI> 60. and therefore never can be the Moral of an Epick Poem, because what is false may De∣lude, but only Truth can Instruct. Should we not let him know, Sir, that this universal Moral only teaches us, That whoever perseveres in good Actions, shall be always sure to be Rewarded ei∣ther here or hereafter; and that the Truth of this Moral is prov'd by the Poet, by making the principal Character of his Poem, like all the rest of his Characters, and like the Poetical Action, at the bottom, Universal and Allegorical, even after distinguishing it by a particular Name, by making this principal Character at the bottom, a meer Poetical Phantom, of a very short du∣ration, thro' the whole extent of which duration we can see at once, which continues no longer than the reading of the Poem, and that being over, the Phantom is to us nothing, so that unless our Sense is satisfy'd of the Re∣ward that is given to this Poetical Phantome, whose whole duration we see thro' from the very beginning to the end; instead of a wholsome Moral, there would be a pernicious Instruction, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Man may persevere in good Actions and not be Rewarded for it thro' the whole ex∣tent

of his duration, that is neither in this World nor in the World to come.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the principal Character of an Epick Poem is morally vicious, yet the Poem ought not to end unfortunately with relation to that principal Character. But here, Sir, I think my self oblig'd to explain my self: By a Character morally vicious, I by no means mean a Villain∣ous Character: Because a Villain can never have greatness of Mind nor greatness of Capacity suf∣ficient to perform Things deserving to be admir'd. But Admiration is, as it were, the Instrument by which the Poet works his End, which is Instru∣ction, as has been acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>BY a Character morally vicious then, I mean such a Character as is compounded of good and bad Qualities, the good at the same time over∣coming the bad, and Hiding them as the Sun does Mercury, by the greatness of their Neigh∣bouring Lustre: Now a Poet is not to make an Heroick Poem end Unfortunately, with relation to such a Character, because such an end would weaken and destroy that Admiration which is re∣quisite for the Poet's attaining his End, and de∣stroy or weaken it in the very place where its In∣fluence is most requisite. For as the greatest Im∣pression that a Poem is to make, ought to be made at the end of it, the reigning Passion of that Poem ought to predominate most there. As therefore Terrour and Compassion ought to be most violently mov'd, at the Catastrophe of a Tragedy, and Laughter at that of a Comedy, Admiration ought to be rais'd to its utmost height,
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>
at the end of an Epick Poem. But if that Poem should end unfortunately, with relation to such a compounded Character, as we have just mention'd above, it would cause great Indignation in some, and great Compassion in others: Now as great Indignation and great Compassion are always at∣tended with Grief, Admiration is constantly ac∣companied with Joy. An Epick Poet therefore, by exciting Compassion or Indignation at the latter end of his Poem, instead of Admiration, would make that Poem throw off its Nature and assume that of Tragedy, which is as directly con∣trary to its own, as Grief is to Joy, or as Light is to Darkness.</P>
<P>NOR would such a prosperous End, in rela∣tion to such a Character, be in the least a viola∣tion of Poetick Justice, tho' for the most part in Tragedy, it would be a very great one; be∣cause the Hero of an Epick Poem always carries on some good and great Design, for the Advan∣tage of that Society, of which he is the chief, or an illustrious Member, at least, it has been so, in all the Epick Poems I have yet seen; tho' this is far from being always the Case in Tragedy; now that publick Virtue makes Compensation for all Faults but Crimes, and he who has this publick Virtue is not capable of Crimes. The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Athenians,</HI> while Liberty flourish'd among them, would have look'd very coldly upon a Poet, who should have shewn a great Patriot unfortunate, only for being a great Patriot. In order to encourage publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and the Love of their Coun∣trey,
<PB N="11" REF="25"/>
they oblig'd their Epick Poets, to shew those Virtues crown'd with Glory and Felicity. Nay, the Ancients made the very future Happi∣ness of their Heroes depend upon the Success of their good and great Designs for the Welfare of their Country: Witness that famous passage in the Fragment of <HI>Cicero, De somnio Ciceronis Sed, quo sis, Africane, alacrior. ad Tutandam Rem∣publicam, sic Habeto: Oomnibus, qui patriam conservaverint, adjuverint, auxerint, certum esse in caelo, ac Definitum locum, ubi Beati aevo sempiterno fruantur.</HI></P>
<P>FOR my part, I have no Notion, that a suf∣fering Hero can be proper for Epick Poetry. <HI>Milton</HI> could make but very little, even of a Suffering God, who makes quite another Im∣pression with his Lightning and his Thunder in <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> than with his Meckness and his Stoicism in <HI>Paradise Regain'd</HI>: That great Spirit which Heroick Poetry requires, flows from great Passions and from great Actions: If the suffering Hero remains insensible the generality of Readers will not be much concern'd for one, who is so little concern'd for himself. The Greatness of his Mind may, perhaps, be admir'd by a few, who are themselves magnanimous, but the Au∣thor of an Epick Poem ought to write to Man∣kind, and not only to the Age wherein he lives, but to remotest Posterity. If the Hero of an Epick Poem should not appear insensible in his Sufferings, his Sensibility will be attended with Passions, which are not only incompatible with that Admiration, which ought to be mov'd thro
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
the Poem, but which will sink its Spirit, and debase its Majesty.</P>
<P>LET us then, Sir, leave the Virtues of Pati∣ence and long Suffering to be taught by Priests: They will not fail to inculcate such Doctrines fre∣quently, as being at once consistent with their Duty and their Craft: But never fear that they will intrench upon your Province, and recom∣mend publick Virtue and publick Spirit, and the Love of their Country, to a People, whom they have shewn too clearly, that 'tis their Design to enslave. But for your part, Sir, that you may deserve more and more of your Country and of Mankind, make Choice of a Hero, whose every Action may flow from those noble Principles, and Reform a degenerate Age, which seems so fond of Slavery. Let his great Actions be crown'd with Glory and Victory, with the Joy∣ful Acclamations of the People, whom he has made happy by his Heroick Conduct and Virtue, and with such transcendent Felicity, as may raise the highest Admiration in the Breast of every Reader, inflame every one of them with the love of his Country, and with a burning Zeal to imi∣tate what he admires.</P>

<HEAD>TO Henry Cromwell, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the <HI>Vis Comica.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the favour of a Visit from you the other Day, I was in a great deal of Pain, and had been so for a Day and a Night before you saw me, and con∣tinued so for the same space of Time after you left me, and then I voided a Stone about the big∣ness of a Pea, and so thanks be to God, have been ever since at Ease.</P>
<P>BUT what perhaps may surprize you, is this, That in the midst of all this Misery, I read over four Comedies of <HI>Terence, viz.</HI> The <HI>Eunuch,</HI> the <HI>Heautontimorumenos,</HI> the <HI>Adelphi,</HI> and the <HI>Phormio.</HI> These I read over in the two Evenings ofmy Ill∣ness, in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Quarto Edition, a very convenient one for a Person of my gravity, in a Winter's Evening, tho' he who had the Care of the Edition, understood nothing of the Stage. In
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
the two Mornings of my Illness, I read over Mrs <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Comment upon the Four Comedies, and upon the Life of <HI>Terence</HI> writ by <HI>Suetonius.</HI> I have told you more than once, that when the Commentators had sometimes led me into a Bog, my own Common Sense had help'd to guide me out again. You may guess what a de∣ference I pay to the Herd of Commentators, when you will see by what follows, that I have the Assurance to contradict Monsieur <HI>Le Fevre</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> his Daughter, for whose Learn∣ing, Judgment, and fine Discernment I have al∣ways had a singular Regard and Esteem.</P>
<P>YOU know very well, Sir, that <HI>Suetonius</HI> in the latter end of his Life of <HI>Terence,</HI> has men∣tion'd some Verses of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> in which that Emperor calls <HI>Terence</HI> a Demy <HI>Menander,</HI> and complains that the <HI>Vis Comica</HI> was wanting to that Comick Poet.</P>
<Q><L>Tu quoque, Tu in summis, O dimidiate Menander</L>
<L>Poneris, &amp; merito, puri Sermonis Amatôr;</L>
<L>Lenibus at{que} utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis</L>
<L>Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret Honore</L>
<L>Cum Graecis, ne{que} in hac despectus parte jaceres</L>
<L>Unum hoc maceror, &amp; Doleo tibi deesse Terenti.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> in her Remarks upon that part of the Life, says, That it was the Opinion of her Father Monsieur <HI>Le Fevre,</HI> that by the <HI>Vis Co∣mica, Caesar</HI> meant the Passions, from which Opinion the Daughter dissents for the two fol∣lowing
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>
Reasons. First, Because the Passions are natural and essential to Tragedy, and but inci∣dental to Comedy. Secondly, Because it is impossible to preserve the Characters, as <HI>Terence</HI> has admirably done, without making them Speak upon occasion with as much Passion as that oc∣casion requires; which is not only justly, but very finely observ'd. And, Indeed we find that the Passions in <HI>Terence,</HI> upon great surprizes are ex∣tream lively and strong. And when <HI>Horace</HI> tells us in his Art of Poetry, that Comedy sometimes usurps upon Tragedy, and has Passions which are next to Tragical, He brings his Example from the <HI>Heautontimorumenos</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Interdum tamen, &amp; vocem Comoedia tellit,</L>
<L>Iratusque Chremes tumido Delitigat ore.</L></Q>
<P>But the Explication which Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> her Self, gives of the Words of <HI>Caesar,</HI> is not a jot better than her Father's. For by <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> says she, <HI>Caesar</HI> meant the Vivacity of the Acti∣on, and the tying and solving the Knot of the In∣trigue; which is wrong, for two Reasons. First, Because these both belong to Tragedy as nearly as they do to Comedy. And, Secondly, Because, if <HI>Caesar</HI> had understood by his <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> what Mrs. <HI>Dacier</HI> thinks he did, he could never have call'd <HI>Terence</HI> a Demy <HI>Menander.</HI> For <HI>Te∣rence,</HI> having the Business of two of <HI>Menander's</HI> Comedies in one of his, and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Comedy being of as great a length as the <HI>Roman</HI>; <HI>Terence</HI> must consequently have more Intrigue, and a
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>
greater Vivacity of Action than <HI>Menander,</HI> and consequently, if <HI>Caesar,</HI> by his <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> had meant the Intrigue, and the vivacity of Action, He would have nominated <HI>Terence,</HI> a Double, in∣stead of a Demy <HI>Menander.</HI></P>
<P>But since I have Declared my self not at all satis∣fied with either the Father's or the Daughter's Expli∣cation, you may perhaps expect that I should give my own. I shall do it with Submission, but upon this Condition, that if I am in the wrong, you and your Commentators shall set me right.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe both from the Terms, and the Reason of the Thing, that by the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> must be meant something Comical and peculiar to Comedy. For the chief Force of any kind of Poem, must consist in that which makes the Characteristick of it, and which distinguishes it from all other Poems. As the chief Force of Tragedy must proceed from the moving Compassion and Terror strongly, and the Chief Force of Epick Poetry from the exciting Admi∣ration, Powerfully, so the chief Force of Comedy must consist in exciting Laughter. By the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> then can never be meant the bare Vivacity of the Action, and the tying and solving the Knot of the Intrigue, which is com∣mon to both kinds of Dramatick Poetry, as has been observ'd above, but the lively Ridicule re∣sulting from the Intrigue; the Ridicule of the In∣cidents, and especially of the Catastrophe, which yet is but a part of the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> for there is likewise the Ridicule of the Characters proceed∣ing from their several Humours, and the Plea∣santry
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
of the Sentiments and of the Dialogue. When <HI>Caesar</HI> therefore says, that <HI>Terence</HI> is but a Demy <HI>Menander,</HI> what does he say, but that <HI>Terence</HI> had turn'd four or five of <HI>Menander</HI>'s Comedies into Latin, and lost half the Ridi∣cule and the Pleasantry of that <HI>Athenian</HI> Poet, in Translating him. That this was <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Meaning is plain to me, not only from the Reason and the Nature of the Thing, which has been shewn above, but from the great De∣light which <HI>Caesar</HI> took in the <HI>Ridiculum,</HI> and the great Encouragement which he gave to the <HI>Mimes</HI> of <HI>Laberius</HI> and <HI>Publius Syrus,</HI> which were low Farces, compos'd on purpose only to make People Laugh; as likewise from the Me∣thod which <HI>Terence</HI> took in his Versions: For taking two of <HI>Menander</HI>'s Plays into one of his, he must of Necessity leave a great part of his Dialogue behind him, and by consequence, a great part of his Pleasantry: So that the same thing happen'd to <HI>Menander</HI> formerly, which has befallen <HI>Moliere</HI> in our Days. Several <HI>En∣glish</HI> Authors have translated Parts of him, but not one of them has enter'd into that <HI>naiueté</HI> which is the purest Source of his Pleasantry, (as indeed it is of Pleasantry in general) for what the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>naiueté,</HI> which is a charming Simplicity, dictated by pure Nature, is almost always Original: For there is something in it so easie, so free, so flowing and so natural, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies the restraint of a Copy. I do not pretend to say, that there was none of the <HI>naiueté</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
<HI>Menander</HI> in <HI>Terence</HI>; but I may venture to say after <HI>Caesar,</HI> that there is not above half of it, and consequently, not above half his Plea∣santry; tho' at the same time, I believe that there is more of this Quality in <HI>Terence,</HI> than ever there was in a Copy; and if the God of Laughter does not always attend upon <HI>Terence, Venus</HI> and the <HI>Graces</HI> never leave him. 'Tis my humble Opinion, that there is no Dialogue extant in any Language, which has half the Charms of the <HI>Terentian</HI> Dialogue; what comes nearest to it, is that of <HI>Etherege</HI> in Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter.</HI> I, who have been acquainted with <HI>Te∣rence</HI> above forty Years, am now more delight∣ed with him than ever: And sure that Beauty must be no common Charmer, in whom Time shall discover new Graces, and whom long possession, renders more desireable.</P>
<P>THUS have I given you my Sentiments: If what I take to be the Sense of <HI>Caesar,</HI> be not your own, I desire you would set me right.</P>

<P>I Sent a Letter on the 28th to your House, Directed to Captain <HI>Steele,</HI> and desiring to see himthat Night, that I might have his Advice upon a Business of Importance, softly intimating at the same Time, that it was not in my Power to wait upon him. But having neither seen him nor heard from him, I fancy that my old Friend is departed, and some Gentleman has succeeded him in the old House, with the same Name, and the same Martial Title; a Chance that happens oftener in the World than some People ima∣gine. How should I have been surpriz'd, in Case I had gone my self, expecting from the Similitude of Name and Title, to have seen my old Acquaintance? How should I have been surpriz'd to have found a Man with quite another Mind, and quite another Countenance? My old Friend, as I thought at least, had Ci∣vility, had Humanity, had a good and enga∣ging
<PB N="29" REF="43"/>
Officiousness, and as I did not take him to want good Nature, so he had what the <HI>French</HI> call a good Countenance, that is, the Countenance of one who is pleas'd with him who talks to him. But I suppose I should have found nothing of all this in the noble Captain who succeeds him. You will say, perhaps, that you had no Reason to make a Visit to one whom you know not, and are resolved not to know. But then, Noble Captain, you ought to have sent back my Letter, and to have given me to understand, that you are not the Person that I took you for; that you should have enough to do, if you were obliged to own all the Acquaintance of the Captain, your Predecessor; That I am not the first Man who have made this Mistake, and shall not probably be the last. Had you done this, I had had no Replication to make to so equitable an Answer. I should only perhaps have advis'd you, in order to the prevent∣ing some troublesome Visits, and some imper∣tinent Letters, to cause an Advertisement to be inserted in Squire <HI>Bickerstaff</HI>'s next <HI>Lucu∣brations,</HI> by which the World might be in∣form'd, That the Captain <HI>Steele,</HI> who lives now in <HI>Bury-Street,</HI> is not the Captain of the same Name, who liv'd there two Years ago, and that the Acquaintance of the Military Person who inhabited there formerly, may go look for their old Friend, e'en where they can find him.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Upon the Prospect from LEITH-HILL in <HI>Surrey.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have ever since I saw you last, been either in Motion, or in Places where Ink is a Liquor more precious than <HI>Tockay.</HI> But tho' I have ever since the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> been in the Country, I have enjoy'd small Satisfa∣ction, if you except what the sight of the Country itself affords me, which is indeed an Entertainment, of which I can never be weary.</P>
<P>I never in all my Life time left it without Regret, and always return'd to it with Joy. The Sight of a Mountain is to me more agree∣able than that of the most pompous Edifice; and Meadows and natural winding Streams, please me before the most beautiful Gardens, and the most costly Canals: So much does Art appear to me to be surpass'd by Nature, and the Works of Men by the Works of God. But
<PB N="31" REF="45"/>
here I desire you to believe, that I speak of the Mechanick Works of Men. For as to the Productions of Human Mind, the more Art some of them have, as particularly some sorts of Poetry, the more lovely they are, and more estimable; because, the more they have in them of true Art, the more they have of Nature; whereas, in the Mechanick Works of Men, the contrary of this is seen; for the more con∣summate an Art appears in them, the more they recede from plain and simple Nature.</P>
<P>BUT thither to return from whence I di∣gress'd; as the Sight of the Country has been always more pleasing to me than that of the Town, so, in a late Journey which I took in∣to the Wild of <HI>Sussex,</HI> I pass'd over a Hill which shew'd me a more transporting Sight than ever the Country had shewn me before, either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI> The Prospects, which in <HI>Italy</HI> pleas'd me most, were that of the <HI>Valdarno</HI> from the <HI>Apennins,</HI> that of <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> from the Mountain of <HI>Viterbo</HI>; of <HI>Rome</HI> at Forty, and of the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI> at Fifty Miles distance from it, and that of the <HI>Campagne</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Tiuoli</HI> and <HI>Frescati</HI>; from which two Places, you see every Foot of that famous Campaigne, even from the Bottom of <HI>Tiuoli</HI> and <HI>Frescati,</HI> to the very Foot of the Mountain of <HI>Viterbo</HI> with∣out any thing to intercept your Sight. But from a Hill which I pass'd in my late Journey into <HI>Sussex,</HI> I had a Prospect more extensive

than any of these, and which surpass'd them at once in Rural Charms, in Pomp and in Magnificence. The Hill which I speak of is call'd <HI>Leith Hill,</HI> and is about five Miles <HI>Southward</HI> from <HI>Darking</HI>; about six from <HI>Box-Hill,</HI> and near twelve from <HI>Epsom.</HI> It juts its self out about two Miles beyond that Range of Hills which terminates the <HI>North Downs</HI> to the <HI>South.</HI> When I saw from one of those Hills, at about two Miles distance, that side of <HI>Leith Hill</HI> which faces the <HI>Nor∣thern Downs</HI>; it appeared the beautifullest Prospect to me I had ever seen. But after we had conquered the Hill it self, I saw a Sight that would transport a Stoick, a Sight that look'd like Enchantment and Vision, but Vi∣sion Beatifick. Beneath us, lay open to our View, all the Wilds of <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> and a great Part of that of <HI>Kent,</HI> admirably Diver∣sifyed in every Part of them, with Woods, and Fields of Corn, and Pastures; those Fields of Corn and Pastures, being every where adorn'd with stately Rows of Trees.</P>
<P>This beautiful Vale, is about thirty Miles in Breadth, and about sixty in Length, and is terminated to the <HI>South,</HI> by the Majestick Range of the <HI>Southern</HI> Hills and the Sea. And 'tis no easie matter to decide, whether these Hills which appear at thirty, Forty, Fifty, Miles distance, with their Tops in the Sky, appear more Awful and Venerable, or the Delicious Vale between you and them
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>
more inviting. About Noon in a serene Day, you may at thirty Miles Distance see the very Water of the Sea thro' a Chasm of the Mountains. And that which above all makes it a noble and a wonderful Pro∣spect, is, that at the same time that at chirty Miles Distance you behold the very Water of the Sea; at the same time that you be∣hold to the <HI>South</HI> the most delicious Rural Prospect in the World; at that very time, by a little turn of your Head towards the <HI>North,</HI> you look full over <HI>Box Hill,</HI> and see the Country beyond it between that and <HI>London</HI>; and over the very Stomacher of it, see St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s at five and twenty Miles Distance, and <HI>London</HI> beneath it, and <HI>High∣gate</HI> and <HI>Hampstead</HI> beyond it. It may perhaps appear incredible to some, that a Place which affords so great and so surpri∣sing a Prospect, should have remain'd so long in Obscurity; in so great Obscurity, that 'tis unknown to the very Frequenters of <HI>Ep∣som</HI> and <HI>Box Hill.</HI> But, alas! we live in a Country more fertile of Great Things, than of Men to admire them. Who ever talked of <HI>Cooper</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI> till Sir <HI>John Den∣ham</HI> made it Illustrious? How long did <HI>Mil∣ton</HI> remain in Obscurity, while twenty pal∣try Authors, little and vile if compared to him, were talk'd of and admir'd? But here in <HI>England</HI> nineteen in twenty like by o∣ther Peoples Opinions, and not by their
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
own. That Fools by their Approbation should draw in Fools, as Sheep leap after Sheep, is no great matter of Wonder: But that Fools by their Numbers should prove so powerful as to influence Men of Sense, and engage them to approve of what they would otherwise utterly have contemned, is what I have often wonder'd at, but ne∣ver could yet account for; but such unna∣tural monstrous Things as these, make the Town more odious and the Country more agreeable.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Deceitfulness of RUMOUR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was always my Opinion, that Judg∣ment is a cool and a slow Faculty, and no more constantly attends a Man in the warmth of Wine and of Conversation, than in the Fury and Rapture of a Poetical Composition. If I had in the least doubted of this, what past at your House, on the first of this Month, would have perfectly convinced me of it; where, for want of Coolness to consider Things, I betray'd my own Cause and that of my departed Friend Mr. <HI>Wycherly.</HI> I shall say but a Word or two of my own, but I desire to be a little longer about his.</P>
<P>I then declared it to be my Opinion, that <HI>Free-thinking</HI> would at one time or other
<PB N="36" REF="50"/>
endanger our Constitution; That it invali∣dates the very Things which are the great∣est Security both of Princes and People, and those are the Oaths which the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI> take either as Subjects or Witnesses. To which a Gentleman in the Company answer'd, that the Oaths derived their binding Force from the very Law of Nature, as well as from the Christian Reli∣gion; with which Answer, for want of Coolness and Time to consider, I remain'd at that instant satisfied.</P>
<P>But as soon as I bad Coolness and Time to consider, I found that a double Reply might justly be made to that Answer of your Friend. For in the first Place, the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> are divided into <HI>Atheists</HI> and <HI>Deists.</HI> Now the former of these cannot be at all influenced by the Law of Nature. For to them to whom there is no God, there can be no Law of Nature. And as for the latter, tho' <HI>Theists</HI> are influenced by the Law of Nature, yet we ought to con∣sider, that the Oath which an <HI>Englishman</HI> is oblig'd to take as a Subject or a Witness, derives its most binding Force, and its most sacred Solemnity, from that which distin∣guishes it from all other Oaths, and that is the laying Hands upon the Bible and kis∣sing it; which Ceremonies are certainly not deduceable from the Law of Nature, but are wholly derived from that Revelation
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
which the <HI>Theists</HI> do not believe. <HI>Free∣thinking</HI> then is the Cause, why both <HI>A∣theists</HI> and <HI>Theists,</HI> by contemning those Ceremonies, and disbelieving the Revela∣tion from whence they are derived, are come slightly to regard the very Oath it self: Yes, <HI>Free-thinking</HI> is the Cause that at this time of day we have so many brave Knights-Errant of the Post, both Spiritual and Secular,</P>
<Q><L>That eat perfidiously their Words,</L>
<L>And swear their Ears thro' two-inch Boards;</L>
<L>Can own the same thing and disown,</L>
<L>And perjure booty <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI>;</L>
<L>Can make the Gospel serve their turn,</L>
<L>And help them out to be forsworn,</L>
<L>When 'tis laid Hands upon and kiss'd,</L>
<L>To be betray'd and sold like Christ.</L></Q>
<P>Thus have I spoke to my own Cause in as few Words as I could. I desire to dwell a little longer upon my late Friend Mr. <HI>Wycherly</HI>'s. A Gentleman in the Compa∣ny was pleased to say, that the Comedy of the <HI>Country Wife</HI> had not a just Foundation, be∣cause, said he, it was not practicable for <HI>Horner</HI> to make himself pass for an Eu∣nuch. How! not practicable, when he himself was at the bottom of the Design, and had taken so many Precautions to make
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>
it succeed? I am so far from being of your Friend's Opinion, that I would lay fifty to one, if I were but capable of suborning half a dozen Rascals, who should warmly and industriously spread the Report, that I would make either you or your Friend pass for <HI>Free-thinkers,</HI> with a considerable part of the Town, in spight of your utmost At∣tempts to undeceive them. How can that be, you'll say, when there would be neither Truth nor Probability in such a Report? But have Truth or Probability any thing to do with the Entertainments of publick Ru∣mour? When my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> said,
<Q><L>There's not a Thing on Earth that I can name</L>
<L>So Foolish and so False as Common Fame;</L></Q>
did he banter, do you think? or speak it from a thorough Knowledge of the World and of Mankind? There is another of our Poets, who knew Mankind perfectly well, who will tell you the same thing in Terms that are something stronger.</P>
<Q><L>The World is naturally averse</L>
<L>To all the Truth it sees or hears;</L>
<L>But swallows Nonsense and a Lie,</L>
<L>With Greediness and Gluttony.</L>
<BIBL>Butler. Part 3. Cant. 1.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="39" REF="53"/>
'Tis true indeed, if the Rabble and Scum of Mankind, of whose Voices pub∣lick Rumour is compos'd, had but so much true Sense as a sober Beast, why then the Rule that <HI>Horace</HI> has laid down for the Tragick Stage, might do pretty well for the Stage of the World.</P>
<Q><L>Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures,</L>
<L>Quam quae sint oculis subjecta Fidelibus &amp; quae</L>
<L>Ipse sibi tradit Spectator.</L></Q>
<P>But since the case is far otherwise, and so many Ideots will believe that they See what they only Hear; (where as no Dog, no Horse, nay no Ass is Fool enough to let his external Sense be impos'd upon by his beastly Imagination;) <HI>Butler</HI> has been so far from thinking that <HI>Horace</HI>'s Rule for the Tragick Stage is proper for the Stage of the World, that he has laid down for the Latter, one which is the very Reverse of the other.</P>
<Q><L>For, like the World, Mens Jobber-noles</L>
<L>Turn round upon their Ears, the Poles;</L>
<L>And what they're confidently told</L>
<L>By no Sense else can be controul'd.</L></Q>
<P>What my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> and the Author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> have declar'd in their Verses,
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
our Dramatick Poets have endeavour'd to shew upon the Stage, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Eyes of the Rabble of Mankind are downright Cullies to their Ears, and that they easily believe that they actually See what they are only impudently Told of: Witness what passes between <HI>Vindicius</HI> and old <HI>Brutus,</HI> in the <HI>Junius Brutus</HI> of <HI>Lee</HI>; and between <HI>Hamlet</HI> and <HI>Polonius,</HI> in the <HI>Hamlet</HI> of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> which seems to be the original of the other. And has not <HI>Ben,</HI> Learned <HI>Ben,</HI> who is so great a Master of his Art, and consequently of Human life and nature, shewn us the very reverse of this in the Ca∣tastrophe of his admirable Alchimist, <HI>viz.</HI> shewn us Persons who what before they had actually seen, are made to believe that they only vainly imagin'd, and for no other Rea∣son but because they are impudently told that they only vainly imagin'd it.</P>
<P>I tell you then again and again, that I would undertake, if I could but be brought to use the Means, to make both you and your Friend pass for Eunuchs, in spight of the Testimony of Twenty Females, who might cry out in Mrs. <HI>Pinchwife</HI>'s Language, they won't see poor Mr. <HI>Horner</HI> abus'd, for to their certain knowledge—For tho' that perhaps might undeceive a few, the general Opinion would still remain. For why may it not be as practicable to geld you and your Friend, as it has been to burst one of your old
<PB N="41" REF="55"/>
Acquaintance, in spight not only of Truth, but of all manner of Probability; in spight of his own solemn Asseverations to the con∣trary, of the continual vigorous Exercises both of Riding and Walking, which he has us'd of late; and lastly, in spight of ocu∣lar and manual Proof to the contrary given to eminent Chirurgeons and others? when neither Truth, nor reasonable and strong Presumption, nor Evidence of Sense that has been given to several, have been able to undeceive the many, but the Rupture has still remained in the empty Heads of a thousand Fools, who have still endeavour'd to propagate the senseless Error.</P>
<Q><L>For Fools are stubborn in their way,</L>
<L>As Coins are hardned by th' Allay;</L>
<L>And Obstinacy's ne'er so stiff,</L>
<L>As when 'tis in a wrong Belief.</L> <BIBL>Hudib.</BIBL></Q>
<P>If any thing that I have said about this last Affair may happen to surprise you, the Surprise I suppose will still be greater, when you are told that the two Apostles of this new Doctrine, like those of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> are downright Ass and Widgeon.</P>
<P>The gross of Mankind have infinitely more Propensity to censure than to praise. They generally praise thro' Interest, and they censure by Inclination. And yet the Poison of false Praise has more than once
<PB N="42" REF="56"/>
grown epidemically contagious, by the Er∣ror and Imbecility of a few, and the Con∣spiracy of a false Report. You cannot have forgot what happened to that ugly Beau <HI>Bovey</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Bovey</HI>'s a Beauty, if some few agree</L>
<L>To call him so; the rest to that degree</L>
<L>Affected are, that with their Ears they see.</L></Q>
<P>You may remember that something like this has happen'd upon the Representation of several of our Dramatick Performances, when blundering sustain Tragedies, or tri∣fling insipid Comedies, have, by the Con∣spiracy of a Cabal, and their concerted Applauses, been cogg'd upon the Town for Master-pieces, to the Dishonour of our Country and Disgrace of the <HI>British</HI> Poetry. Some Persons, who have been in these Conspiracies, knew, or ought to have known, better Things. But one unaccountable Effect of Vanity, among many others, is, that some Persons, tho' they do not want Understanding, yet, at the Expence of the Reputation of their Common-Sense, are fond of shewing their Power; are fond of shewing their Power to Fools, at the Ex∣pence of the Reputation of their Common∣Sense with the thinking part of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="57"/>
How often has something like this hap∣pened among our Statesmen? How often have they topp'd White for Black, and Black for White, upon the thoughtless Rab∣ble? How often have they who Yesterday were thought Heroes, and Patriots, and Demy-gods, to Day been look'd upon as Villains, and Thieves, and Robbers; and they who Yesterday were held Villains and Traitors, have to Day been regarded as Heroes, and Saints, and Patriots? Have not our Politicians more than once turn'd the Rehearsal out of Ridicule, by turning the whole State topsy turvy in a Morning, only by the Artillery of false Reports, without so much as striking a real Blow? and by that means proving to all the World, that one might take Mr. <HI>Bays</HI> for a Poli∣tician; that Mr. <HI>Bays</HI>'s Politicks were good and sound, and that his <HI>quondum</HI> Grace of <HI>Bucks</HI> was out, when he pretended to make a Jest of them.</P>
<P>But in short, and Raillery apart, the Prevalency of false Reports, concerted by five or six dark Sophisters, has more than once made some of the best and greatest Men in the Kingdom, who but just before were approv'd, applauded, admir'd and cherish'd by all the Lovers of their Country, become all at once the very Hatred and Scorn of the Rabble, which I believe nei∣ther ever did, or could have happen'd any
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>
where but in <HI>England</HI>; either as to the Excess of Malice in the Inventors, or the Excess of Credulity in the Believers and Propagators of those false Reports. For that which makes <HI>England</HI> the most splene∣tick Country in the Universe, makes it the chief and residentiary Seat of Slander. For there never was a very splenetick Man, unless he was a Man of an extraordinary Understanding, but he was at the same time a Slanderer. And the same virulent Humour, that causes so many noble <HI>Bri∣tons</HI> to hang, and poison, and drown them∣selves, causes them likewise to do their ut∣most to murder the Reputation of their Neighbours; and the same Humour that in some degree caus'd the Invention of the Slander at first, causes likewise the Propa∣gation of it, and the Credulity of its Be∣lievers. Judge then, if in such a Country as this, even an improbable false Report be not a just Foundation for a Comedy. But the Report of <HI>Horner</HI>'s Impotency, since he himself invented it, and prepared the Way for it, is so highly probable, that a Man must be very Hypercritical, who, up∣on that account, censures my late most in∣genious Friend. I have a great deal more to say upon this Subject, but I want Time at present.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of the 22d of the last Month came to my Hands in due time. I had sooner returned you Thanks for the favour of it, and had sooner congratulated you upon the return of your Health, upon which so many Healths depend, and which under God has been so often the cause of the Recovery of mine; if I had not been engag'd in an Important Business which took up all my Hours. I likewise return you my hearty thanks for setting the Affair between me and my Brother-in-Law in a true light, tho' I perceive by what you write that there are Persons who continue to believe him. But I would fain ask those Persons what Motive they have to restrain them from do∣ing an unjust or a base thing, which I have not in a much greater Degree. They will
<PB N="46" REF="60"/>
say, perhaps, that they have got a great deal more Money than I have. But, Sir, is not their getting a great deal a sign of their great Love for it? And if I have all my life time had but a little, do they believe it has proceeded from my Incapacity of getting it, or from my Contempt of it? And which is most like to secure any one from doing Injustice; the Love of Money, or the Con∣tempt of it? Have their Purses been more constantly open to the Occasions of their Friends and Acquaintance? Have they dis∣cover'd more magnanimous Thoughts, and more exalted above Selfishness? Have they more Understanding to discern their true Interest, and to know that no Man can live happily without living reputably? Have they had a more liberal Education, or a more generous Conversation? I was till five and forty plung'd in the Conversation of the great World, and was every Day in com∣pany with Gentlemen, who are universally known to be Men of no ordinary Merit, who wanted no Discernment to know me, and who have several of them given publick proofs of their Esteem for me. Now if I mistake not, before the Age of forty five the Manners of Men are unalterably form'd. For these last fifteen Years I have retir'd from the World, and confin'd my Conver∣sation to three or four of my old Acquain∣tance who are publickly known to be Men
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>
of Men of Honour and Understanding. Can any reasonable Man then believe, that I, who while I was conversant in the World kept my Reputation clear, should retire to be a Villain in Solitude? If I refus'd to an∣swer a Demand which my Brother-in-Law pretended he had upon me, 'tis because he had no title to any thing from me but his want of it. If he had ask'd me to give him the Money which he said I ow'd him, I had certainly given it him. But I could not think without Indignation, that an ungrate∣ful Wretch, to whom I had endeavour'd at the expence of my Time and Interest to do the most Important Services, should pretend to extort it from me by Insults and Brutality. What those Services are, I shall let you know in my next; but I am weary at present, and so without doubt are you.</P>

<HEAD>TO Mr. * * *</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which are some Passages of the LIFE of Mr. JOHN CROWN, Author of Sir <HI>Courtly Nice.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall now, in compliance with the repeated Requests you have made to me, say something concerning the E∣ducation of Mr. JOHN CROWN, and the most remarkable Passages of his Life. Mr. CROWN was bred under his Father, an Independant Minister, in that part of <HI>Nor∣thern America,</HI> which is called <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> But the Vivacity of his Genius made him soon grow impatient of that sullen and gloomy Education, and soon oblig'd him to get loose from it, and seek his Fortune in <HI>England.</HI> But it was his Fate, at his first Arrival here, to happen on an Employment more formal, if possible, than his <HI>American</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
Education. His Necessity, upon his first Ar∣rival here, oblig'd him to become a Gen∣tleman-Usher to an old Independant Lady. But he soon grew as weary of that pre∣cise Office, as he had been before of the Discipline of <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI> One would think that these were but indifferent Pre∣paratives to the commencing polite Author. But neither these nor his Poverty, which was great, could oppress his aspiring Spi∣rit, aspiring to Reputation and Distinction, rather than to Fortune and Power. His Writings soon made him known to the Court and Town: Yet it was neither to the Favour of the Court, nor of <HI>Wilmot</HI> Lord <HI>Rochester,</HI> one of the shining Orna∣ments of it, that he was indebted for the Nomination which the King made of him for the writing the Mask of <HI>Calypso,</HI> but to the Malice of that noble Lord, who de∣sign'd by that Preference to mortify Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> Upon the breaking out of the two Parties, after the Discovery of the Po∣pish Plot, the Favour that he was in at Court, the Gayety of his Youth, and his being unacquainted with true political Prin∣ciples, engaged him to embrace the Party of the Tories. About that time he writ <HI>The City Politicks,</HI> on purpose to Satyrize and expose the Whigs; a Comedy so agree∣able, that it deserv'd to be writ in a much better Cause: But after he had writ
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
it, he met with very great Difficulties in the getting it acted. <HI>Bennet</HI> Lord <HI>Arling∣ton,</HI> who was then Lord Chamberlain of the King's Houshold, and who had secret∣ly espous'd the Whigs, who were at that time powerful in Parliament, in order to support himself against the Favour and Power of the Lord Treasurer <HI>Danby,</HI> who was his declared Enemy, us'd all his Au∣thority to suppress it. One while it was prohibited on the account of its being Dangerous, another while it was laid aside on the pretence of its being Flat and Insi∣pid; till Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> at last was forc'd to have Recourse to the King himself, and to engage him to give his absolute Command to the Lord Chamberlain for the acting of it; which Command the King was pleas'd to give in his own Person. For that Mo∣narch lov'd a Comedy above all Things, (excepting one Thing) and had no mean Opinion of Mr. <HI>Crown</HI>'s Qualifications to succeed in it. While he was thus in Fa∣vour with the King and the Court, I have more than once heard him say, that tho' he had a sincere Affection for the King, he had yet a mortal Aversion to the Court. The Promise of a Sum of Money made him sometimes appear there to solicit the Pay∣ment of it: But as soon as he had got it, he vanish'd, and continued a long time ab∣sent from it, of which, he told me, the
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
Dutchess of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> took once Occa∣sion to complain to the King; whose way of answering that Complaint, puts me in mind of a Passage in <HI>Boileau</HI>'s Epistle to <HI>La∣moignon.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Hier de vous on parla chez le Roy,</L>
<L>Et d' attentat Horrible on traita la Satire,</L>
<L>Et le Roy que dit il. Le Roy se prit a rire.</L></Q>
<P>It was at the very latter End of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign, that Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> being tyr'd with the Fatigue of Writing, and shock'd by the Uncertainty of Theatrical Success, and desirous to shelter himself from the Resentments of those numerous Enemies which he had made by his <HI>City Politicks,</HI> made his Application immediately to the King himself; and desir'd his Majesty to establish him in some Office, that might be a Security to him for Life. The King had the Goodness to assure him, he should have an Office, but added that he would first see another Comedy. Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> endeavour∣ing to excuse himself, by telling the King, that he plotted slowly and awkwardly; the King replyed, that he would help him to a Plot, and so put into his Hands the <HI>Spanish</HI> Comedy called <HI>Non pued Esser.</HI> Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> was oblig'd immediately to go to work upon it; but, after he had writ three Acts of it, found to his Surprise, that the <HI>Spanish</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
Play had some time before been translated, and acted, and damn'd, under the Title of <HI>Tarugo</HI>'s <HI>Wiles, or the Coffee-house.</HI> Yet, supported by the King's Command, he went boldly on and finish'd it; and here see the Influence of a Royal Encourage∣ment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Crown,</HI> who had once before ob∣lig'd the Commonwealth of Learning with a very agreeable Comedy in his <HI>City Poli∣ticks,</HI> yet in Sir <HI>Courtly Nice</HI> went far be∣yond it, and infinitely surpassed himself. For tho' there is something in the part of <HI>Crack</HI> which borders upon Farce, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Au∣thor alone must answer for that. For Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> could not omit the Part of <HI>Crack,</HI> that is of <HI>Tarugo,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Farce depending upon it, without a downright Affront to the King, who had given him that Play for his Ground-work. But all that is of <HI>English</HI> Growth in Sir <HI>Courtly Nice</HI> is admirable; for tho' we find in it neither the fine Designing of <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI>; nor the general and masculine Satyr of <HI>Wy∣cherly</HI>; nor that Grace, that Delicacy, nor that Courtly Air which make the Charms of <HI>Etherege</HI>; yet is the Dialogue so lively and so spirited, and so attractively diversi∣fied and adapted to the several Characters; four of those Characters are so entirely new, yet so general and so important, are drawn so truly and so graphically, and oppos'd to
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
each other, <HI>Surly</HI> to Sir <HI>Courtly</HI> and <HI>Hot∣head</HI> to <HI>Testimony,</HI> with such a strong and entire Opposition; those Extremes of Be∣haviour, the one of which is the Grievance, and the other the Plague of Society and Conversation; excessive Ceremony on one side, and on the other side Rudeness and Brutality, are so finely expos'd in <HI>Surly</HI> and Sir <HI>Courtly</HI>; and those Divisions and Animosities in the two great Parties of <HI>England,</HI> which have so long disturb'd the publick Quiet, and undermined the pub∣lick Interest, are so happily represented and ridicul'd in <HI>Testimony</HI> and <HI>Hothead,</HI> that tho' I have more than twenty times read over this charming Comedy, yet I have al∣ways read it, not only with Delight but Rapture. And 'tis my Opinion, that the greatest Comick Poet that ever liv'd in any Age, might have been proud to have been the Author of it.</P>
<P>The Play was now just ready to appear to the World; and as every one that had seen it rehears'd was highly pleas'd with it; every one who had heard of it was big with the Expectation of it; and Mr. <HI>Crown</HI> was delighted with the flattering Hope of being made happy for the rest of his Life, by the Performance of the King's Promise; when, upon the very last Day of the Re∣hearsal, he met <HI>Cave Underhill</HI> coming from the Play-House as he himself was go∣ing
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
towards it: Upon which the Poet re∣primanding the Player for neglecting so considerable a Part as he had in the Co∣medy, and neglecting it on a Day of so much Consequence, as the very last Day of Rehearsal: Oh Lord, Sir, says <HI>Under∣hill,</HI> we are all undone. Wherefore, says Mr. <HI>Crown,</HI> is the Play-House on Fire? The whole Nation, replys the Player, will quickly be so, for the King is dead. At the hearing which dismal Words, the Au∣thor was little better; for he who but the Moment before was ravish'd with the Thought of the Pleasure, which he was about to give to his King, and of the Favours which he was afterwards to re∣ceive from him, this Moment found, to his unspeakable Sorrow, that his Roy∣al Patron was gone for ever, and with him all his Hopes.

<HEAD>To his Grace the Duke of BUCKINGHAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT being able to wait on your Grace by reason of an intolerable Head-ach, I humbly desire that you would order the Letter which you have done me the Honour to write for me, to be delivered to the Bearer.</P>
<P>I humbly desire your Grace to believe, that if you had given me no Caution, I had by no means done any thing, which might cause me to forfeit your good Opinion of me. So far were my Thoughts from that, that I never yet resolv'd to publish those Remarks. 'Tis very likely, that af∣ter your Grace, and my Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> and Two or Three more have perus'd them, I may send them to the Author, and content my self, with letting him know my Power.</P>
<P>BUT, my Lord, as I would not be thought to do a Barbarous thing, I desire your Grace to believe, that I had powerful
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
Motives to engage me to write these Re∣marks. I was attack'd in the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, in the very second or third, and in several others. Since your Grace is of opinion that the Au∣thor of the Tragedy did not write those particular Papers, I am very willing to be∣lieve it. But he was in Partnership with those who did. He went share in the Pro∣fits, and more than share in the Reputa∣tion. And Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> durst not have pro∣vok'd me, without his Approbation, or at least his Consent. My Lord, with sub∣mission to your Grace's Judgment, I am apt to believe, that what Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> did in this Case was the Action of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>▪ If a Man who is in Partnership wrongs me in Trade, all the Partners are involv'd in the Guilt, unless they disclaim it, and sig∣nify their Abhorrence of it to the Person injur'd. The Law of <HI>England</HI> allows of no Accessaries in Murder; all who are con∣cern'd in it are Principals. And Reason, upon which the Law of <HI>England</HI> is found∣ed, says, that the Case is the same in the as∣sassinating a Man's Reputation. My Lord, I appeal to your Grace, if the attacking me in the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, was not only an Assas∣sination, but one of the blackest sort. It was done in the dark, no Provocation in the least given, no Name to the Paper, and no Author known; when at the very same Time they openly profest Friendship to me.
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
I may add to this, that it was done at a time when they basely took advantage of the great Misfortunes I lay under. My Lord, I appeal to your Grace, if mine is not a more generous Proceeding. I do not attack, but retort; I proceed frankly and openly, and I who am in Adversity, engage one who is in high Prosperity.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, my Lord, the Satyr of this Criticism (for Reason is the severest Satyr in the World, when it is terribly a∣gainst a Man) does not fall most heavily upon the Author of the Tragedy, it falls most severely upon this partial and tastless Town. The writing a foolish Play, is a Piece of Ridicule that we have long been us'd to: But the gaining a general violent Applause to a foolish Play, is something new to us: 'tis the reviving a Farce that had been act∣ed but once before since King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Time.</P>
<P>My Lord, I am afraid of tiring your Grace's Patience by too long a Letter, or I would proceed to the other Motives, which prevailed upon me to write these Remarks. But I hope to have the Honour of acquainting you with them another time.</P>

<P>I Have lately read over the famous Pro∣cess between the Marquis <HI>De Gueores</HI> and Madamoiselle <HI>de Mascranny,</HI> with which I have been agreeably entertain'd, and which I here send you by the Bearer, because a Lady of your Apprehension may easily discern, that you may produce an Argument from it sufficient to convert your Friend Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> that termagant Stick∣ler for divine, unalienable, indefeasible Right; for can there be any Right to any Government so divine, so unalienable, so indefeasible as that of a Husband to the Government of his Wife? Yet if this Mo∣narch,
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
by Right Divine, appears unqualify'd to govern her well; if he cannot answer the Ends of Government; if he keeps not the original Contract, which is on his part the giving due Benevolence, she endeavours to depose her Sovereign immediately; that is, she sues out a Bill of Divorce, and chuses another King. The original Contract be∣tween a limited Monarch and a free Peo∣ple, is, that he shall govern them by Laws of their own making, and that they shall obey him as long as they are so govern'd. Now will your Friend Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> murmur, at our Sexes enjoying that Privilege, which you have always claim'd your selves? We have already depos'd one Popish King for breaking this originnl Contract, and can she expect that we will set up another, who we know is not able to keep it? Would she accept of one for a Husband, whom she knew beforehand to be in a State of Impotence? How then can she pretend that we should accept of such a Gover∣nour? Is not a Popish Pretender as much unqualify'd to govern a free-born Prote∣stant People, as one in a natural State of Impotence is to give due Benevolence? Are not both Pretenders equally impotent as to what they pretend to? Then pray, Madam, acquaint your Friend Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> that since our Sex is assistant to yours in throwing off your evil Governours, when

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the present State of the Stage.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been about to write to you every Post for these ten Days, but one Acci∣dent or other has still diverted me; but I shall now make more than amends, for <HI>In∣gentem tibi Epistolam Impingam.</HI></P>
<P>If I had had the greatest Inclination imagi∣nable to accept of the Invitation which you sent me by your Familiar; yet something has happen'd which would have been a Just, tho' a Ridiculous Impediment. For I had given my word to go another way, in or∣der to pull a certain Beast out of a Ditch, who had fal'n into it, thro' a more than Bestial Stupidity, which engag'd him to look upon things above him, instead of grazing and following the Instinct of Nature. But
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
to speak plain <HI>English,</HI> and return to your Invitation; who could have expected any such thing, from one who had so barba∣rously abandon'd his old Acquaintance, who had never so much as once in Twenty Years miss'd an opportunity of serving him, and abandon'd him contrary both to Friend∣ship and Politicks. For a Man who de∣serts his Friend in an Affair in which 'tis rea∣sonable that he should espouse him, does two Things at once to his own Disadvan∣tage. For first, he shews the World that he has no Body's Interest at heart but his own, which Indifference the World, as soon as it perceives it, will be sure to return in Kind: Secondly, he gives a pretty convin∣cing Proof, that he has not Capacity e∣nough to understand his own Interest; for he who in any Point that is reasonable is deaf to his Friend's Interest, is cer∣tainly blind to his own. Now what Depen∣dance can I have on a Person who makes it evident to me, that he neither cares for my Interest, nor understands his own? If you had laid aside the Alteration of <HI>Cori∣olanus</HI> for better Plays, there had been a plausible Apology for your Breach of Pro∣mise. But to sacrifice me to Fools, was Impudent as 'twas Barbarous. I have read the noble Stuff which you have acted this Winter, all but <HI>Busiris,</HI> which was not publish'd when I left the Town. But some
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
Persons, whom I have seen in this place, tell me there is a Rape in it. If that is true, it has a Fault in it for which nothing can make Atonement. A Rape is the peculiar Barbarity of our <HI>English</HI> Stage. Neither <HI>Greecians</HI> nor <HI>Romans</HI> would suffer it, nor can the <HI>French</HI> at present bear it. The very Apprehension of a Rape, tho' the thing did not follow it, damn'd the <HI>Theodore</HI> of <HI>Corneille</HI>; which, if you will believe Monsieur <HI>Hedelin,</HI> is one of his best Tra∣gedies. I would fain know from you, who have had a twenty Years Experience of the Stage, for what Reason the Women, who will sit as quietly and passively at the Re∣lation of a Rape in a Tragedy, as if they thought that Ravishing gave them a Plea∣sure, for which they have a just Apology, will start and flinch like unback'd Fillies, at the least Approach of <HI>Rem</HI> to <HI>Re</HI> in Co∣medy, unless that Approach happens to be made in the House of Bondage. I have been sometimes apt to entertain a Suspicion, that 'tis not the luscious Matter which di∣sturbs them in Comedy, but the secret im∣plicite Satire upon the Sex. For a Woman in Comedy never grants the last Favour to one to whom she is not marry'd, but it proclains the Man's Triumph and her Shame. It always shews her Weakness and often her Inconstancy, and sometimes her Fraud and Perfidiousness. But a Rape in
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
Tragedy is a Panegyrick upon the Sex: For there the Woman has all the Advantage of the Man. For she is suppos'd to remain innocent, and to be pleas'd without her Consent; while the Man, who is accounted a damn'd Villain, proclaims the Power of Female Charms, which have the Force to drive him to so horrid a Violence. But to return to the other Plays, which you acted this last Winter. I have read two Come∣dies without one Jest in them. But you will say, perhaps, that the Play-House was throng'd for eight or ten Days together at the Representation of these Comedies; per∣haps so. But then, if it was so throng'd at the Representation of damn'd Plays, I hope my Ears will no more be stunn'd with the Noise of the Improvement of a general Taste, and that for the future no Conse∣quence will be drawn from the Numbers of an Audience to their Capacity. For the very same Reason that the Builder's Trade, the Carpenters and the Joyners are so very much improv'd; for the very same Rea∣son that so many fine Houses, so many beautiful Streets, so many stately Squares, and, as it were, whole Towns are building in your North-West Suburbs; for that very same Reason is your Theatre crowded. A Penetration that comes far short of Conju∣ration, may suffice to shew, that the Num∣bers of the Nobility and Gentry of the
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
Town, and consequently of their Depend∣ants, are exceedingly augmented by some great Events which have happen'd of late Years, <HI>viz.</HI> the Revolution, the Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Return of our Armies from the Continent, and the King's Accession to the Crown. But as for the Improvement of a general Taste, 'tis so great a Blunder, that it could never be thought of among considerate People. 'Tis improv'd in∣deed with a vengeance, 'tis refin'd in a glorious manner! improv'd as the Taste of a Green-sickness Girl, who leaves pa∣latable Meat for Charcoal; refin'd as the Taste of an Hysterick Woman, who is cherish'd by a Stink, and sickens at a Per∣fume; or as the Taste of a modern Letcher, who, like a Swine, prefers a Sirreverence to the finest thing in the World. The in∣genious Diversions, which they follow'd this Winter, their Masquerades, their <HI>Italian</HI> Farces, and their <HI>French</HI> Tumblings, can∣not chuse but shew the great Refinement of their Taste. If the general Taste were improv'd, two things would certainly fol∣low, good Plays would be writ, and damn'd ones would not be endured. But <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Plays you will say were crowded, and <HI>Tom. D'Urfey</HI>'s neglect∣ed this Winter. Be it so. I shall shew you in my next, that the Generality of

<HEAD>LETTER written in behalf of one who was lately ruin'd by <HI>Stock-Jobbing,</HI> to his Fa∣ther-in-Law who would not see him.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the third Letter which I have writ to you, without the Satisfaction of receiving an Answer, which has been a great Accession to the Calamity which I labour'd under before; and I have felt the Frowns of Fortune the more severely, be∣cause they have been attended with yours. 'Tis hard, that it shou'd be in her Power to alienate not only our Possessions, but even the Hearts and Souls of our dearest and most valued Friends. As we learn from her hourly Inconstancy, that there is no Man secure from her Power, methinks it should be the common Interest of Man∣kind to alleviate her Strokes by using their Fellow-Creatures gently, while they are un∣der her Disgrace; especially since long Ex∣perience has taught us, that she is often the
<PB N="68" REF="82"/>
most barbarous to those who deserve her Cruelty the least; so that her Persecution be∣ing for the most part directly contrary to Reason, should least of all be abetted by reasonable Men like you. My Intentions have been very good, tho' the Event has not been answerable to them; and methinks when we pass a Judgment upon our Neigh∣bours, not by their Intentions, but by E∣vents, we pass a severe Law against our¦selves, because our Intentions are in our Power, but Events are not; and no Man can foresee the future. My very Enemies must confess, that my Calamity has pro∣ceeded not from any Extravagance of Tem∣per, or a luxurious Life, but only from the too eager Desire of Getting; which, if it be a Fault, who at present is guiltless? Sure no Man ever was justly blam'd for catching a Distemper, whose Infection was epidemi∣cal. And yet that very eager Desire of Getting has not proceeded from any sor∣did Avarice, but only from my Excess of Love to your Daughter, and an earnest Zeal to secure her Happiness before I should be prevented by Sickness or Death, or that usual Change which attends on Hu∣man Affairs. So that my Eagerness to make your Daughter happy, has been the very thing that has made her miserable by bring∣ing under her Father's Displeasure one for whom she believes it her Duty to be concern'd
<PB N="89" REF="83"/>
So that what she suffers by your Displeasure causes it to be more grievous to me, and makes me more passionately and impatiently desire that you would be reconcil'd to me. My Fault has been my Error and not my Crime, and I have Youth, and Health, and Vigour of Mind enough to retrieve my Fortune. And when I have retriev'd her, I have Reason to believe, that she will then be constant to me, because I have seen and experienc'd the only Error which could have oblig'd her to leave me; and therefore as soon as I am re-establish'd, I shall be more happy because more secure than if I had never falln. In the mean while, Sir, to give you a convincing Proof, that I prefer your Daughter's Happiness to my own, I am willing to do any thing to secure her a Competency while my own Condi∣tion is doubtful. I am willing to put it as much out of my Power, as it is contrary to my Inclinations, to touch the other two thousand Pounds.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Degeneracy of the Publick Taste.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABout the middle of the last Month I sent you a long Letter, in which I endeavour'd to shew the Extravagance of that Opinion, that there is at this time a∣mong us an Improvement of the general Taste, with relation to Poetry and the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> And I promis'd in my next to shew the Error or the Falacy of those, who pretend to maintain that Opinion from the crowded Audiences at the Represen∣tation of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Plays, and the thin ones at those which were writ by Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y.</HI> I promis'd to shew that notwith∣standing this Practice of the present Fre∣quenters of the Play-House, they have it both in their Heads and their Hearts to value Mr. <HI>D'Urfey</HI> and to despise <HI>Shake∣spear,</HI> that neither their Approbation nor their Contempt is their own, but assumed and borrowed, and that they approve by
<PB N="71" REF="85"/>
Vogue and by Fashion, as a late noble Poet has told us.</P>
<Q><L>Their private Wish obey the publick Voice,</L>
<L>'Twixt Good and Bad Whimsey decides, not Choice;</L>
<L>Fashions grow up for Taste, at Forms they strike,</L>
<L>They know what they would have, not what they like.</L></Q>
<P>I promis'd to shew, that the one of these Authors has been esteem'd, and the other contemn'd by Men of Sense so long, that the Approbation of the one, and the Contempt of the other, is come at last to make an Impression on the Rabble; when I mention that Word, I do not mean such a Rabble as you have sometimes on the Stage at <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> or at <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> but such a Rabble as is but too often be∣held in your Pit and Side-Boxes.</P>
<P>A very great Part of those who pretend to be in Love with <HI>Shakespear,</HI> if he were now living, and his most celebrated Plays were to be acted <HI>De novo,</HI> without a Cabal, without Character or Prepossession, wou'd Hiss and Damn the very Things of which they are now the fashionable Admirers, which seems plain to me from this very Reason, because the modern Plays which they most approve of, are the very Reverse
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, with respect either to his Excellencies or his Faults.</P>
<P><HI>Shakespear</HI> is very justly celebrated for the Truth and Justness of his Cha∣racters, for the Beauty of his Sentiments, for the Simplicity and Dignity of his Dia∣logue, and for his moving the Passions pow∣erfully by the meer force of Nature. But the present Spectators of Tragedies ap∣prove of those most, in which the Passions are mov'd least. They will endure no Mo∣dern Tragedy, in whose principal Chara∣cter Love is not the predominant Quality. Now Love predominating in the principal Character, too often falsifies and confounds those Characters, and by Consequence but too often destroys the Beauty of the Sen∣timents, because no Sentiment can be beau∣tiful, which is improper in him who speaks it. Besides, there are not three of our mo∣dern Tragedies, which have any thing like those Sentiments which abound in <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>; Sentiments, which, at the same time that they shew Sagacity and Penetration, are easie, just, and natural.</P>
<P>The modern Readers and Spectators of Tragedies will endure no Tragedy which has the Simplicity and <HI>naiveté</HI> of <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>'s Dialogue; a Simplicity, wherever the occasion requires it, attended with Force, and Dignity, and Pomp, and Solem∣nity: Instead of that noble and natural Di∣alogue,
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
they are for a flatulant Style, in which the Poet puts the Change upon him∣self, and speaks almost always himself, in∣stead of making his Characters speak.</P>
<P>But as the Readers and Spectators of Modern Tragedies approve of those most, which are the very reverse of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s with respect to his Beauties and Excellen∣cies, so they declare very loudly against his Faults. The Faults of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> which are rather those of the Age in which he liv'd, are his perpetual Rambles, and his apparent Duplicity in some of his Plays, or Triplicity of Action, and the frequent breaking the Continuity of the Scenes. The present Spectators declare against this, in appearance, but at the same time ap∣prove of this Multiplicity of Action in some Modern Plays, concealed by a Jumble and a Confusion which is incomprehensible and altogether unintelligible. Another of <HI>Shake∣spear</HI>'s Faults is the Length of Time em∣ploy'd in the carrying on his Dramatick Action. The present Spectators are ex∣treamly shock'd at this in a modern Trage∣dy, but at the same time approve of those in which the Unity of Time is preserved by offending all Common Sense.</P>
<P>If a Modern Poet in one of his Trage∣dies should shew any Thing like <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Rambles, should introduce a Tragedy up∣on the Stage, which should begin in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
and end in <HI>Asia,</HI> like the Moor of <HI>Venice,</HI> that Play would be exploded and damn'd with very great Damnation. But the Modern Spectators of Tragedies great∣ly esteem and are fond of those, in which the Unity of Place is preserv'd, sometimes by whimsical comick Absurdities, and sometimes by dreadful and prodigious Ex∣travagancies.</P>
<P>From all this I conclude, as I said be∣fore, that the Spectators of modern Tra∣gedies, having the greatest Esteem for those, which have least of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Excellen∣cies, and declaring loudly against his Faults, would damn <HI>Shakespear,</HI> if living.</P>
<P>Nor can I believe that several who pre∣tend to be passionate Admirers of <HI>Milton,</HI> would treat him if living in any other man∣ner for the following Reasons.</P>
<P>Because they are so fond of nothing as of that soft and effeminate Rhyme, which makes the very Reverse of the Harmony, and of the manly, and powerful, and noble Enthusiasm of <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>Because the Generality of Poets and Wits his Contemporaries did not esteem him, tho' they were by no means inferior in Understanding to his pretended living Admirers. <HI>Willmot</HI> Earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> ne∣ver so much as mention'd him, in his Imi∣tation of the Tenth Satyr of the first Book of <HI>Horace.</HI> When he came to imitate that
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
Passage, <HI>Forte epos Acer, ut nemo Varius du∣cit,</HI> instead of <HI>Milton</HI> he names <HI>Waller.</HI> And when that noble Peer was some Years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards ask'd by Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> since Bi∣shop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> for which of the Mo∣dern Poets he had most Esteem, he an∣swer'd without the least Hesitation, for <HI>Boileau</HI> among the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Cowley</HI> a∣mong the <HI>English</HI> Poets. Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> in his first Book of Criticism treated the <HI>Pa∣radise Lost</HI> with Contempt, and the gene∣rality of the Readers of Poetry, for twen∣ty Years after it was published, knew no more of that exalted Poem, than if it had been writ in <HI>Arabick:</HI> Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in his Preface before <HI>the State of Innocence,</HI> ap∣pears to have been the first, those Gentle∣men excepted whose Verses are before <HI>Mil∣ton</HI>'s Poem, who discover'd in so publick a Manner an extraordinary Opinion of <HI>Milton</HI>'s extraordinary Merit. And yet Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> at that time knew not half the Extent of his Excellence, as more than twenty Years afterwards he confess'd to me, and as is pretty plain from his writing <HI>the State of Innocence.</HI> For Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> in that Poem, which is founded on the <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> falls so infinitely short of those wonderful Qualities, by which <HI>Milton</HI> has distinguish'd that noble Poem from all other Poems, that one of these two Things must be granted; either that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> knew
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
not the Extent of <HI>Milton</HI>'s great Qualities, or that he design'd to be a Foil to him. But they who knew Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> know very well, that he was not of a Temper to de∣sign to be a Foil to any one.</P>
<P>I hope I have said enough to convince you that the Approbations and Censures of the Generality of an Audience are deriv'd from Sentiments which are not their own, and which are the Effects of Authority, and not of Reason. When Men who are, and are esteem'd, Persons of more than or∣dinary Judgment, have declar'd themselves from time to time, during a Century, or half a Century, concerning Poems Dra∣matick or others, those Declarations are the Cause, that other Persons at length, being guided by the Light which is held out to them, fondly imagine that it was kindled by that Particle of Heav'nly Fire which they fancy to be within them. But the numerous and violent Cabals, which are form'd to support or decry Dramatick Wri∣tings, may serve instead of a thousand Ar∣guments to convince the most obstinate, that there is no such thing as a general Taste among us. It being absolutely impossible that great Numbers of Persons of a fine Discernment and a true Taste should con∣spire to extol a Blockhead at the Expence of a noble Art, at the Expence of their own Reputation and the Reputation of their

Perhaps, if you take the Word in the most diffusive Sense, there never was a general good Taste for Poetry, among any People in the World, if you except the <HI>Atheni∣ans.</HI> But there never was so general a one in <HI>England</HI> as there was in modern <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> before the Opera and some o∣ther Things debauch'd it in both those Countries.</P>
<P>There has not one great Poet appear'd in <HI>France</HI> since the beginning of Cardi∣nal <HI>Richlieu</HI>'s Ministry, but he has been protected and encourag'd, and his Merit,
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
as fast as it could spread, has been gene∣rally acknowledg'd. I wish I could as tru∣ly affirm the same thing of <HI>England.</HI> The great Qualities of <HI>Milton</HI> were not gene∣rally known among his Countrymen till the <HI>Paradise Lost</HI> had been publish'd more than thirty Years. But when that admirable Poet was among the <HI>Italians,</HI> the Great∣ness of his Genius was known to them in the very Bloom of his Youth, even thirty Years before that incomparable Poem was writ, witness the Epigram of <HI>Selvaggi,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Poet, of which <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Epigram which is under <HI>Milton</HI>'s Picture is nothing but a Paraphrase.</P>
<Q><L>Graecia Maeonidem, jactet sibi Roma Maro∣nem,</L>
<L>Anglia Miltonum, jactat utrique parem.</L></Q>
<P>Nay, <HI>Salsiki,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Poet, sacrifices the very Honour of his Country, that is, of modern <HI>Italy</HI> to him, by preferring the <HI>Italian</HI> Poetry of <HI>Milton</HI> even to that of <HI>Tasso:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Cede Meles, cedat depressâ Moxéius urnâ</L>
<L>Sebetus Tassum desinatusque loqui.</L>
<L>At Thamesis victor cunctis ferat altior undas,</L>
<L>Nam per Te, Milto, partribus unus erat.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="79" REF="93"/>
And <HI>Giovanni Baptista Manso,</HI> a Noble <HI>Neapolitan,</HI> who had been the intimate Friend of <HI>Tasso,</HI> and the great Patron of <HI>Marino,</HI> while they were living, gives ex∣traordinary Commendations to <HI>Milton,</HI> tho' he was then but a Youth among them, as appears by his <HI>Latin</HI> Verses addrest to that noble <HI>Italian,</HI></P>
<Q><L>Ergo ego Te Clius, &amp; magni nomine Phoebi</L>
<L>Manse pater, jubeo longum salvere per aevum,</L>
<L>Missus Hyperboreo Juvenis peregrinus ab axe.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Milton</HI> had then been so far from writing the <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> that he had never so much as thought of that Subject, but had at that time determin'd, after his Return to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to write an Epick Poem upon the Exploits of <HI>Arthur</HI> and the Knights of the Round Table, as appears by the same Verses to <HI>Manso.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Arthurumque etiam sub Terris bella moven∣tem</L>

<L>Magnanimos Heroas, &amp; (o modo spiritus adsit)</L>
<L>Frangam Saxonicas Britonum sub marte phalanges.</L></Q>
<P>Thus, you see, the <HI>Italians,</HI> by his ju∣venile Essays, discover'd the great and
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
growing Genius of <HI>Milton,</HI> whereas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Countrymen knew very little of him, even thirty Years after he had publish'd among them the noblest Poem in the World.</P>
<P>But as the general Taste of <HI>England</HI> could be never said to be good, it was ne∣ver so bad as it is at present; a certain Proof of which, is, that Writings both Dra∣matick and others, were never so infamous as they now are. And Taste and Writing always keep Pace with each other. When <HI>Shakespear</HI> first appear'd among us, the Ge∣nerality of his Readers and his Spectators were much better able to judge of him than they are at present. Because, as he was a very natural Writer, and they were with∣out Prejudice, without Prepossession, and without Affectation, and without the In∣fluence of a Coxcomical, Senseless Cabal, they were at Liberty to receive the Impres∣sions which Things naturally made on their Minds.</P>

<HEAD>TO Sir RICHARD STEELE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Declaring the Reasons for which I pub∣lish'd the two Volumes of SELECT WORKS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here send you by the Bearer, several Pieces in Verse and Prose, writ for∣merly by me, and lately printed in two Volumes; but I send them not without a double Design on you. For first, I desire that you wou'd have the Goodness to oblige your Managers to make me some Recom∣pence this Winter for the Wrong which they did me the last. Secondly, I desire that you will give me leave to say something concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Pieces contain'd in these two Volumes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd more particularly concerning the Mo∣tive which oblig'd me to write the chief of them at the first, and to publish them lately together; which I shall do with Plea∣sure
<PB N="82" REF="96"/>
to one who has done so much Good in the same Cause in which most of them were writ.</P>
<P>Several of the Pieces in Verse and Prose, and three of the Plays, were writ in the Cause of Liberty. The narrative Poems of greater Length were all of them written upon Great and Publick Occasions, and were design'd as so many Panegyricks upon those Illustrious Persons whoseGreat and Heroick Actions had made them Benefactors to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and Liberty.</P>
<P>It has always been my Opinion, that a free Nation can never be too zealous in maintaining their Liberties, because we have been taught by too many fatal Events, that they have at last been often lost by the Security and Corruptions of those who had for several Centuries enjoy'd them. Wit∣ness the ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> and the ancient and modern <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> But whenever the Liberties of a great Nation are in manifest Danger, there all the several Members of it, who are not abjectly base, will use their utmost Efforts in defending them. The Liberties of <HI>Great Britain</HI> have in our own Memory been in so much Danger, that they have been twice in thirty Years retrieved from immediate Ruin, first by the Revolution, and second∣ly by the Accession of King <HI>George</HI> to the Imperial Crown of this Island, but even
<PB N="83" REF="97"/>
now they by no Means appear to me to be entirely secur'd.</P>
<P>Since the Revolution, things appear to have been strangely reverst in <HI>Great Britain</HI> with regard to Liberty. In four or five Reigns immediately preceding the Arrival of King <HI>William</HI> of Immortal Memory, the Court was for Arbitrary Power, and the People appear'd strenuous for Liberty. But since that time, the Court has for the most part contended for Liberty, and the People, I mean too great a Part of them, have declar'd for Slavery. Now, if ever we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould come to be under a King, who wou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrifice his Protestant Dissenting Subjects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the High-Church Clergy, we should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uickly see whether the Liberties of a Na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on are most secure, when a considerable Part of the People (who are their natural Guardians) are resov'd to defend, or deter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd to resign them. In the mean time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it must be acknowledg'd, to the im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortal Honour of the present King, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> endeavouring to secure the Dissenters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om such a Treatment in time to come, he taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most effectual Method to im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortalize Liberty.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I acquainted you with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only Motive of writing the chief of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ese Poems, which was the Apprehension <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>had of the Danger, which the Liberties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Country were in, and consequently
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
the Liberties of the Christian World, of which ours are the strongest Bulwark. I wrote them not then as one who espous'd a Party, but as a Lover of my Country, and one zealous to promote the Happiness of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I have been so far from having any ambitious Aims or any sordid Views of Interest, that I have been con∣tented to see several of the publick Rewards engross'd by some who are luke-warm, and by others who are <HI>Jacobites</HI> in Whig Cloathing, while I have remain'd very poor in a very advanc'd Age. But one Thing indeed I have sometimes been apt to think exceeding hard, and that is, that these lukewarm Persons, and these <HI>Jacobites</HI> in Whig Cloathing, should be suffer'd to make use of the Power which they have acquir'd by their Falshood, to the utter Ruin of one who has behav'd himself all along with the utmost Sincerity in the noblest Cause of Li∣berty.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I laid before you the Motive which engag'd me to write the greater part of the Pieces which are con∣tain'd in the two Volumes. I shall now shew you, how the same Motive oblig'd me to use my Endeavours to preserve them▪ if they should appear worthy of it, and con∣sequently to publish them in the two fore¦mention'd Volumes. It was in <HI>October</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="99"/>
1716, that I desir'd a Bookseller to collect them for me. I thought that after so much Time had pass'd since the writing them, I should be capable of forming as true a Judg∣ment my self of them, as any other Person whatsoever, who has no better Judgment in Poetical Matters than I have, or that the Precept of <HI>Horace, nonum prematur in annum,</HI> must be false and vain.</P>
<P>Upon a very slow and deliberate Perusal of them, I could not but conclude, that with all their Faults they were not altoge∣ther depriv'd of that noble Fire, which a∣lone can make them pleasing; nor of that Justness and Solidity which alone can make them lasting. I believ'd that if they were publish'd together, they might be able one Day to do some Good to the publick, and no Discredit to me.</P>
<P>And I was the more encourag'd to ven∣ture on this Publication, because, Sir, you may be pleas'd to remember, that they had been favourably receiv'd by the most illu∣strious Persons of both Parties for their Judgment in Poetry, and their Knowledge of the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> by the late Earls of <HI>Godolphin</HI> and <HI>Halifax,</HI> Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> and others among the Whigs, and by the present Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and my Lord <HI>Lansdown</HI> among the Tories. And if any Temptation could make me vain, it would
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
be the favourable Opinions of the last two Noble Persons, because as their Judgments in matters of Poetry are unquestion'd, they can never be suppos'd to be partial to one, who has all his Life-time appear'd very zealous in contrary Principles to those of a Party, which they by some have been sup∣pos'd to favour. My Lord <HI>Lansdown,</HI> by making me a Present so noble, as never has been made by a Subject to any Author now living, sufficiently declar'd that what I had writ had not been altogether displeasing to him. And 'tis to the warm Approbation which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave to the Poem on the Battel of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> that I owe the Honour of being first known to the late illustrious Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> whose good and great Qualities, and the Benefits which <HI>Great Britain</HI> receiv'd from his good and his wise Administration, make me proud to own for the first and greatest of my Benefactors.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I found Encouragement to preserve these Pieces, and especially the Poems writ in the Cause of Liberty. But I was convinc'd at the same time, that the only way to preserve them would be to publish them together. They were in a great many different Hands, and some of them in the Hands of such who were mor∣tal Enemies to the Cause in which they
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
were written. Some of them had been very incorrectly printed. The very Subject which ought to recommend them to all <HI>Englishmen,</HI> as well as the Harmony with∣out Rhyme in several of the Poems, made some of them for the present less pleasing to above half the Readers of Poetry. Some of them that had once appear'd with Applause seem'd to have been forgot. For all things of late Days have been manag'd by Cabal and Party; and there seems to have been a Conspiracy in the Commonwealth of Learning, among Fools of all Sorts, to ex∣alt Folly at the Expence of Common-sense, and make Stupidity triumph over Me∣rit in the very Dominions of Wit, which has been one of the Causes why Things are reduced to that deplorable State upon our <HI>British Parnassus. Apollo</HI> and the Muses seem to have abandon'd it; disdaining that their Divinities should honour a Place with their Songs, where Fools and Pedants, Buffoons, Eunuchs and Tumblers have so often met with Applause.</P>
<P>Who could have thought, if he had been told twenty Years ago, that he should out∣live Tragedy and Comedy, that he had been promis'd a Life of not quite twenty Years? Yet 'tis very plain that the Pro∣mise had extended no further: such is the Power of Cabal and Party.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="102"/>
I have all along had a great Aversion to the making a Party, or the entring into a Cabal, and have sometimes look'd upon it with Horrour and sometimes with Con∣tempt. Who that has Common-sense can forbear laughing, when he sees a Parcel of Fellows, who call themselves Wits, sit in Combination round a Coffee Table, as Sharpers do round a Hazard Table, to trick honest Gentlemen into an Approba∣tion of their Works, and bubble them of their Understandings?</P>
<P>And yet I have all along known, that no∣thing in the greater Poetry can grow im∣mediately popular without a Cabal or Party. I have a long time been convinced, that the more sublimely any thing is writ in Poetry, and the nearer it comes to Perfe∣ction, the longer it will be before it grows popular, without such a Cabal; because the more sublimely it is writ, and the nearer it comes to Perfection, the more it is rais'd above the Apprehensions of the Vulgar. And yet notwithstanding this Knowledge, I have all along resolv'd to have no Repu∣tation, or to owe it to my Writings.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you see the Reasons, why the Writings that make up these two Vo∣lumes, or at least the greater Part of them, had been in danger of being lost, if I had not taken Pains during my Life-time to correct and publish them together. There
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
is one more Reason remaining, and that is, the Malice of those People whom the World calls Poets, whose Hatred I have been proud to incur, by speaking bold and necessary Truths in the behalf of a noble Art, which they have miserably abus'd by their vile Poems, and their more vile Cri∣ticisms. And yet 'tis from these People that the foolish Readers of Poetry, which are nine Parts in ten, take their Opinions of Poets and their Works, little believing, or once imagining, that these Persons are of all Mankind the very worst qualify'd to judge of their own Art; as having nei∣ther the Capacity, nor the Impartiality which are requisite for the judging truly. For it will be found, generally speaking, that Poets, Painters, and Musicians, are capacitated less than other Men to judge of Poetry, Painting and Musick. This, I must confess, may appear to some to be so bold a Paradox, that I shall endeavour to make it out both by Reason and Authority, tho' I know very well at the same time, that You can make no Doubt of it. The Generality of Poets, Painters and Musici∣ans, are such by the meer Power of a warm Imagination. And 'tis very rarely that a strong Imagination and a penetrating Judg∣ment are found in the same Subject. We need go no further than <HI>Boileau</HI> to hear
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
that a celebrated Poet is often a contemp∣tible Judge.</P>
<Q><L>Tel excelle a Rimer qui Juge sottement,</L>
<L>Et tel s'est fait par ses Vers distinguer par la ville,</L>
<L>Qui jamais du Lucain n'a distingue Virgile.</L></Q>
<P>As for what relates to Painters, I shall content my self with the Citation of a Re∣mark from the ingenious and judicious Author of the Observations upon <HI>Fresnoy</HI>'s Art of Painting, translated by Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> 'Tis the Fiftieth Remark, upon these Words of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Translation, 'As being the 'Sovereign Judge of his own Art.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">This Word, Sovereign Judge or Arbiter of his own Art, pre-supposes a Painter to be fully instructed in all the Parts of Paint∣ing, so that being set as it were above his Art, he may be the Master and Sovereign of it, which is no easie Matter. Those of that Profession are so seldom endow'd with that supream Capacity, that few of them arrive to be good Judges of Painting: And I should many times make more account of their Judgment who are Men of Sense, and yet have never touch'd a Pencil, than of the Opinion which is given by the greatest part of Painters. All Painters therefore may be call'd Arbiters of their own Art, but to
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>
be Sovereign Arbiters belongs only to know∣ing Painters.</Q></P>
<P>What is said by this ingenious Gentle∣man of Painters, is exactly true of Musici∣ans. For which I have the Opinion of more than one Master among them; and as to the Truth of this Observation with relati∣on to Poets, I have said enough above.</P>
<P>But as Poets are not capable, so neither are they impartial Judges. I speak of those who are only Rhimesters. For a great Master is for the most part as impartial as he is knowing; but for the rest, the Readers of Poetry would do well to consider, that if a Mistress who is courted by a great ma∣ny passionate Rivals, should ask any one of them his Opinion of the rest, 'tis ten to one that he would prefer him most, whom he esteem'd least, and whom he believ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east capable of getting that Mistress from him.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I acquainted you with the Motive which oblig'd me to write the greater Part of these Treatises, and which afterwards engag'd me to publish them in the two Volumes, which you will receive with this. I hope I shall not be thought troublesome, if in a second Letter I say something in particular of the Pieces both in Verse and Prose. However these two Letters will at least convince you of the
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
good Opinion which I have a long time en∣tertain'd both of your Discernment and your Impartiality.</P>

<HEAD>TO THO. SERGEANT, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That all Stock-Jobbers are Slaves.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had sooner returned you my Thanks for the favour of your last, and the good Advice in it, if I had not entertain'd some Thoughts of waiting on you; which I had certainly done before now, if it had not been for the Reflection, that here of late you are scarce any where to be found but in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>; and what good Christi∣an would go to a Place where he is sure to meet the Devil at every Turn that he takes there? not indeed with his Infernal Equi∣page, his Brow-antlers, his Saucer Eyes, his long Tail, and his cloven Feet: He wears nothing of all this in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> except sometimes his Horns. But then I should meet him at every Turn in more frightful and more provoking Appearances, as now in the Shape of a Roguish leering
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
Broker, and anon like a ghastly ruin'd Stock-Jobber; sometimes in the Shape of a young Lady who has lost both the Mo∣desty and the natural Desire of her Sex; and sometimes I should see him in the same Shape in which he fell from Heav'n, that is like a Star of the first magnitude shining in an azure Sky. For that old Gentleman, who understands his Interest better than a∣ny Mortal living, frequents no one Spot on the <HI>Globe</HI> so much as <HI>Exchange∣Alley:</HI> For there he constantly finds new Occasion to exercise his old Talents, his Tempting, Lying, Deluding and Betraying.</P>
<P>I shew'd the Acclamation at the latter end of your Letter to a Friend, who was with me when it came. <HI>Vive la Mer pacifique!</HI> What, says he, does this come from a Sharper? I desir'd to know what made him ask that Question. You know, said he, that there are two constant Ha∣zard Tables or Wheels of Fortune that are establish'd by Authority in this wicked Town, not to mention a third, which is sometimes at <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> but transitory and occasional; that one of these two is in the neighbourhood of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> establish'd by the Authority of the Court, and the other near the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> establish'd by a∣nother Authority. Now the Table in the Neighbourhood of <HI>White-Hall</HI> is a fair and impartial one, at which only Men of Ho∣nour
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
play; at least they are Men of Ho∣nour while they are there, whatever they may be when they are in other Places. But the Hazard Table near the <HI>Exchange</HI> is frequented by the greatest Sharpers about this tricking Town. There are Bullies to be seen every Day in Crowds with their Boxes and their false Dice: sometimes they make use of High Runners, sometimes of Low Runners, and sometimes of Doctors. And this their Sharping and their Cheat∣ing is Christen'd forsooth their Being in the Secret. So that Being in the Secret will shortly come to signifie something more scandalous even than open Infamy.</P>
<P>Well but, said I, even at that tricking Table, my Friend plays upon the Square, and is in no Secret. But then, said he, let me ask you another Question, Is your Friend a Lover of his Country? That is a stranger Question than the other, said I. Every one is a Lover of his Country, or at least every one pretends to be so. But, replyed he, can any one who would be so much as thought to love his Country ap∣prove so heartily of a Method, which if 'tis practised much longer will infallibly ruin it? For besides that Strangers run away with vast Sums of our Money, who came in at Seventy perhaps, and go out at Seven Hundred; is not our Trade by this Stock-Jobbing brought to a narrower Com∣pass?
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
They who are ruin'd by it are un∣able to carry on their Commerce; and they who have gain'd vast Sums by it, have been apt to think themselves above their Pro∣fessions, and laugh at the getting ten or twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> by a long Voyage, when in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> they can propose to gain fifty <HI>per Cent.</HI> in a Morning. Now as our Trade decreases, continued he, our Seamen must decrease proportionably, so that at last perhaps it will be impossible upon an exigence to Man our Royal Navy: And then we may happen to become a Prey to the first Invader. So that this Lover of his Country is heartily approving of a Method, which may one Day bring this Island to be a conquered Province, and his own Posterity to be wretched Slaves. As soon as I perceived that he paus'd, I told him that this would have been more <HI>a pro∣pos,</HI> if he had spoke it before the late Act of Parliament for the putting down of the Bub∣bles. But he answer'd they being put down by the Wisdom of the Legislature, for this very Reason, least any Prejudice should acrue to Trade from them, and <HI>Ram</HI>'s and <HI>Onslow</HI>'s Bubbles being establish'd by the same Wisdom, have not the Legislature plainly declared, that Trade could receive no Damage from them; and that we may deliver to the Winds our fears of Conquest and of Slavery? Ought not every one to
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
acquiesce in what they have done, and can any one be extravagant enough to believe, that they would establish two Bubbles against the Publick Good, only for the sake of a little transitory Pelf, which is to come in∣to particular Hands? Very good, said my Friend but are not those Gentle∣men who constantly frequent <HI>Exchange-Ally</HI> actually Slaves already, as errant, as vile, as miserable Slaves as those who rowe in the Galleys? Say'st thou so, my dear Friend? said I: do but make that out, and thou shalt to me be <HI>Apollo</HI> and all the Muses. But this is a new Paradox. Not so new neither, said he. The whole Sect of the Stoicks embraced it. The Stoicks, I told him, were fantastical People. In some things he allow'd they were so; but that, for the most part, their Morality was more sound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han that of any other Sect among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Heathens. <HI>Horace,</HI> who was of no Sect, but who took from each of them what he thought was just and solid, (and by the way he wanted no Judgment, no Discernment that could enable him to make a right Choice,) made this Opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is own, as you may see by the Sixteenth Epistle of his First Book.</P>
<Q><L>Qui melior Servo, qui Liberior sit A∣varus,</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="112"/>
Non video. Nam qui cupiet, metuet quo∣que: porrò</L>
<L>Qui metuens vivet, Liber mibi non erit unquam.</L></Q>
<P>But my dear Friend, said I, the Autho∣rity of a <HI>Roman</HI> Poet will hardly bring the Gentlemen in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> off from their Stock-Jobbing. This is an Authori∣ty, he reply'd, which carries Reason along with it. For thus he argues. The Cove∣tous Man desires; he who desires, of con∣sequence fears; but he who lives in conti∣nual Fear, must, in my Opinion, be always an errant Slave. But, continued he, I will add my own Reasons to those of <HI>Horace.</HI> There are two sorts of Liberties, said he, a Civil and a Philosophical Liberty. What we call Civil Liberty gives us the com∣mand of our own Actions: What we call Philosophical Liberty gives us the com∣mand of our own Thoughts. Now nei∣ther the Galley-slave nor the Stock-Job∣be can be said to enjoy Civil Liberty, that is, neither the one nor the other has the free∣dom of his own Actions: For a Galley∣Slave must Row, and a Stock-Jobber must Stock-Jobb.

equally under Compulsion; and the Stock-Jobber, though never so wealthy, is as much afraid of missing the Hours of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s or of <HI>Garroway</HI>'s, as the poor Galley-slave is of being wanting to his turn at the Oar. But now to come to Philosophical Liber∣ty, in that the Galley-slave has infinitely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Advantage of the Stock-Jobber. For while the former is chain'd to his Oar, his Thoughts may be as free as the Air, his Thoughts may wander o'er the Uni∣verse, may wander through Eternity, and while his Body is in the utmost Agitation, his Mind may be calm and compos'd. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Stock-Jobber's Thoughts are more con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd than the other's Body, confin'd to Dirt, and the sordid means of accumula∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it, and his Mind is often plagu'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most tormentiug Passions.

his Post, the noble Post of Virtue where his General placed him, and which it was his Duty to maintain at the Expence of Life it self. He has lost it, he has been beaten out of it, by his base Passions and by his abject Vices, by his Fraud, his De∣sire, his Hope, his Fear and his Rage. The Galley-slave may have it firmly in his Mind and in his Will to do all the Duties of the best of Men; to be a faithful Lover of his Country and to serve it to the utmost of his power; to be a good Father, a good Son, a good Husband, a good Bro∣ther, he may be dear to all his Friends and Relations, and have the heartiest kindest Wishes of all. But as the miserable Stock-Jobber cares only for himself, he is dear to himself alone, and contemptible and hateful to all besides; and one may say to him, in the Words of <HI>Horace,</HI></P>

<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
the latter will sacrifice the rest. And have we not a thousand Instances every Day that a Stock-Jobber will sacrifice his Country?</P>
<P>But there is still another thing in which the Galley-slave has by much the Advan∣tage of the Stock-Jobber. The former is a redeemable Slave, but the latter is in Chains for his Life. Fortune or Time may release the Slaves who are at <HI>Algiers</HI> or <HI>Tripoli,</HI> but Fortune and Time are both the Stock-Jobbers Foes. Length of Days will certainly augment his Avarice and make his Captivity ruder. And the more Wealth there shall chance to flow in upon him, the more will he desire, the less will he enjoy, and still the more abject a Slave will he be to the base Lust of Gold. But, my dear Friend, said I, who had heard him hitherto with Patience, Thou certain∣ly believ'st that thou art in a Pulpit, for it is there that, right or wrong, a Man has the Pri∣viledge of talking for an Hour without be∣ing interrupted. Sir, said he, I stand cor∣rected, but I did not deserve this Remon∣strance only for complying with your own Desire. You know very well that 'tis not my custom to talk all, and that I have more than once suffered you to Preach in your turn. No Man, he continued, has a worse Opinion than I have of an eternal Talker. That which makes him so insuf∣ferable,
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
is, that tho' he is for the most part a very empty Coxcomb, yet he implicitely declares that, into what Company soever he lights, he alone has more Understand∣ing than all the rest of the Company to∣gether; that Nature has qualified him to prescribe to others, and that God who made him created him perpetual Dictator. But as I know you, continued he, to be sometimes an errant Wag, with a very grave Countenance, I am perhaps very much in the wrong to take what you say seriously. I leave you to ruminate on what I have told you, and shall expect to know your Opinion of it the next time I see you. So we parted. But before I give him my O∣pinion I desire to know yours.</P>

<HEAD>TO Sir RICHARD STEELE,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Patentee of the Theatre in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' at the time of writing this, I am almost overwhelm'd both with Sickness and Grief, yet I cannot forbear making a just Complaint to you for your being the Occasion of both these, either by actually breaking your Word with me, or being perfectly passive while your Ma∣nagers broke it; which, if it has not reduc'd me to immediate Necessity, yet has brought me within the Danger of it, and conse∣quently within the Apprehension of it, which is as grievous almost as the Thing. And that this Complaint is but too justly ground∣ed, you your self will acknowledge, when I have laid my Case before you, which I shall do in as few Words as I can.</P>
<P>It was upon the 27th of <HI>February,</HI> 1717/8, that I receiv'd a Letter from Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> by your Direction, and the Direction of the Managers under you, desiring me to dine
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
at your House on the 28th, and after Din∣ner to read the Tragedy of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> to you, which I had alter'd from <HI>Shakespear.</HI> You cannot but remember, Sir, that upon reading it, the Play with the Alterations was approv'd of, nay and warmly approv'd of, by your self, Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> (the other Manager was not there) and that Resolutions were taken for the acting it in the beginning of this Winter. Now I ap∣peal to your self, if any Dramatick Per∣formance could be more seasonable in the beginning of a Winter, when we were threatned with an Invasion from <HI>Sweden</HI> on the North, and from <HI>Spain</HI> on the West, than a Tragedy whose Moral is thus ex∣prest in the last Lines of the Play.</P>
<Q><L>—They who thro' Ambition or Revenge,</L>
<L>Or impious Interest join with Foreign Foes,</L>
<L>T' oppress or to destroy their native Country,</L>
<L>Shall find, like <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> soon or late</L>
<L>From their perfidious Foreign Friends their Fate.</L></Q>
<P>I am sure, Sir, I need not tell one of your Understanding, that this Moral is so apparently the Foundation of the Drama∣tick Action, and must appear to every Spe∣ctator and Reader to be so truly the genu∣ine Result of it, that if I had not said one Word of it, every Reader and Spectator
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
would have been able to have suggested so much to himself.</P>
<P>Well, Sir! when the Winter came on, what was done by your Deputies? Why, in∣stead of keeping their Word with me, they spent above two Months of the Season in getting up <HI>All for Love, or the World well lost,</HI> a Play which has indeed a noble first Act, an Act which ends with a Scene be∣coming of the Dignity of the Tragick Stage. But if <HI>Horace</HI> had been now alive, and been either a Reader or Spectator of that En∣tertainment, he would have passed his old Sentence upon the Author.</P>
<Q><L>Infelix operis summâ quia ponere totum </L><L>Nesciet.</L></Q>
<P>For was ever any thing so pernicious, so immoral, so criminal, as the Design of that Play? I have mention'd the Title of it, give me leave to set before you the two last Lines:</P>
<Q><L>And Fame to late Posterity shall tell,</L>
<L>No Lovers liv'd so great, or dy'd so well.</L></Q>
<P>And this Encomium of the Conduct and the Death of <HI>Anthony</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> a Con∣duct so immoral, and a Self-murder so cri∣minal, is, to give it more Force, put into the Mouth of the High-Priest of <HI>Isis</HI>; tho'
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
that Priest could not but know, that what he thus commended, would cause immedi∣ately the utter Destruction of his Country, and make it become a Conquer'd and a <HI>Roman</HI> Province. Certainly never could the Design of an Author square more ex∣actly with the Design of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> at the time when it was written, which was by debauching the People absolutely to en∣slave them.</P>
<P>For, pray Sir, what do the Title and the two last Lines of this Play amount to in plain <HI>English?</HI> Why to this, that if any Person of Quality or other shall turn away his Wife, his young, affectionate, virtuous, charming Wife (for all these <HI>Octavia</HI> was) to take to his Bed a loose abandon'd Pro∣stitute, and shall in her Arms exhaust his Patrimony, destroy his Health, emasculate his Mind, and lose his Reputation and all his Friends, why all this is well and greatly done, his Ruine is his Commendation. And if afterwards in Despair, he either hangs or drowns himself, or goes out of the World like a Rat, with a Dose of Arsenick or Sub∣limate, why 'tis a great and an envied Fate, he dies nobly and heroically. It is, Sir, with extream Reluctance that I have said all this. For I would not be thought to affront the Memory of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> for whose extraordinary Qualities no Man has a greater Veneration than my self. But
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
that all Considerations ought to give Place to the Publick Good, is a Truth of which you, of all Men, I am sure, can never doubt.</P>
<P>And can you believe then, after having recommended Virtue and Publick Spirit for so many Years to the World, that you can give your Subalterns Authority to preach up Adultery to a Town, which stands so little in need of their Doctrine? Is not the Chastity of the Marriage Bed one of the chief Incendiaries of Publick Spirit, and the Frequency of Adulteries one of the chief Extinguishers of it; according to that of <HI>Horace</HI></P>
<Q><L>Foecunda culpae secula, nuptias</L>
<L>Primum inquinavere, &amp; Genus, &amp; Domos,</L>
<L>Hoc Fonte derivata clades</L>
<L>In patriam populumque fluxit.</L></Q>
<P>For when Adultery's become so frequent, especially among Persons of Condition, up∣on whose Sentiments all Publick Spirit chiefly depends, that a great many Hus∣bands begin to believe, or perhaps but to sus∣pect, that they who are called their Chil∣dren are not their own; I appeal to you, Sir, if that Belief or that Suspicion must not exceedingly cool their Zeal for the Wel∣fare of those Children, and consequently for the Welfare of Posterity.</P>
<P>As I had infinitely the Advantage of <HI>All</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>
<HI>for Love</HI> in the Moral of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> I had it by Consequence in the whole Tragedy; for the <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> as I have alter'd it, ha∣ving a just Moral, and by Consequence at the Bottom a general and allegorical Acti∣on, and universal and allegorical Characters, and for that very reason a Fable, is there∣fore a true Tragedy, if it be not a just and a regular one; but 'tis as just and as regular as I could make it, upon so irregular a Plan as <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s: Whereas <HI>All for Love</HI> having no Moral, and consequently no ge∣neral and allegorical Action, nor general and allegorical Characters, can for that Rea∣son have no Fable, and therefore can be no Tragedy. 'Tis indeed only a particular Account of what happen'd formerly to <HI>An∣thony</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and a most pernicious Amusement.</P>
<P>And as I had the Advantage in the Merit of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> I had it likewise in the World's Opinion of the Merit and Reputation of <HI>Shakespear</HI> in Tragedy above that of Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> For let Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Genius for Tragedy be what it will, he has more than once publickly own'd, that it was much in∣ferior to <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, and particularly in those two remarkable Lines in his Prologue to <HI>Aurenge-Zebe.</HI></P>
<Q><L>And when he hears his Godlike <HI>Romans</HI> rage, </L><L>He in a just Despair would quit the Stage.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="109" REF="123"/>And in the Verses to Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Shakespear,</HI> thyGift, I place before my Sight;</L>
<L>With Awe, I ask his Blessing ere I write;</L>
<L>With Reverence look on his majestick Face,</L>
<L>Proud to be less, but of his Godlike Race.</L></Q>
<P>And the same Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has more than once declar'd to me, that there was some∣thing in this very Tragedy of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> as it was writ by <HI>Shakespear,</HI> that is truly great and truly <HI>Roman</HI>; and I more than once answer'd him, that it had always been my own Opinion. Now I appeal to you and your Managers, if it has lost any thing under my Hands.</P>
<P>But what is more considerable than all this, your Deputy Lieutenants for the Stage have ten times the Opinion of the Advan∣tage which <HI>Shakespear</HI> has over Mr. <HI>Dry∣den</HI> in Tragedy, than either I or the rest of the World have. Ever since I was capa∣ble of reading <HI>Shakespear,</HI> I have always had and have always exprest that Veneration for him, which is justly his due; of which I believe no one can doubt, who has read the Essay which I publish'd some Years ago upon his Genius and Writings. But what they ex∣press upon all Occasions, is not Esteem, is not Admiration, but flat Idolatry.</P>
<P>And lastly, I had the Advantage of the very Opinion which those People had of
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
their own Interest in the Case. They knew very well that it was but twelve Years since <HI>All for Love</HI> had been acted. And they were likewise satisfied, that from its first Run, as they call, to the beginning of this last Winter, it had never brought four Au∣diences together. At the same time there was no Occasion to tell them, that the <HI>Co∣riolanus</HI> of <HI>Shakespear</HI> had not been acted in twenty Years, and that when it was brought upon the Stage twenty Years a∣go, it was acted twenty Nights together.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I shall be oblig'd to you, if you will acquaint me, for what mighty and unknown Reason, the <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> not∣withstanding yours and their warm Approba∣tion of it, notwithstanding your Words so∣lemnly given to act it, as soon as it could conve¦niently be brought upon the Stage this Win∣ter, notwithstanding the Merit of the Play it self, I speak of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s part of it, not∣withstanding the World's and their own O∣pinion of the superior Merit of <HI>Shakespear</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in Tragedy; and their very Opinion of their own Interest in the Case, nay notwithstanding the exact Seasonable∣ness of the Moral for the Service of King <HI>George</HI> and of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which above all things ought to have been consider'd by those who call themselves the King's Ser∣vants, and who act under his Authority: I say, Sir, I should be extremely oblig'd to
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
you, if you would tell me what powerful Reason could so far prevail over all those I have mention'd, as to engage them to postpone the <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> not only for <HI>All for Love,</HI> but likewise for that lamentable Tragick Farce <HI>Caezar Borgia,</HI> from which no Body expected any thing but themselves; and a Comedy after it call'd <HI>the Masque∣rade,</HI> from which they themselves declar'd they expected nothing.</P>

<P>I Had certainly call'd upon thee at <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> before now, if it had not been for the Easterly Winds, which made the coming by Water impracticable to one who is indispos'd, by reason of the cold attending them. But thou hast no reason to be con∣cern'd at my Delay. For this is no time to write waggish Letters to his Grace. In the mean while I have thought of a Project for thee, which will certainly do thy Busi∣ness. Thou shalt e'en turn Author, and write a Play. Thou wilt tell me perhaps that thou art not qualified. For that very Reason thou shalt write one, because for that very Reason thou wilt certainly suc∣ceed. But perhaps thou wilt tell me that thou shalt write a very damn'd Play indeed. A stronger Reason still for thy Writing. For the more damnable thy Play happens to be,
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
the greater and more flaming will thy Suc∣cess be. And so, like a modern Author, or a modern Female Beggar, thou shalt supply thy own infinite Wants, by the in∣finite Wants of thy Offspring. But why art thou not qualified, Friend <HI>Pinky</HI>? There are now-a-days but three Qualifications re∣quisite for the succeeding upon the Stage. The first is the want of that same. For thou know'st the Belly is <HI>Ingenii largitor.</HI> The second Qualification is, that as modern Criticks when they come to a new Play are never without a Cat-call, a modern Poet who writes such a Play should never be without a Fool-call. He must have the knack of jugging Fools into a Pit, as a Country Squire does Partridges into a Trammel. The third Qualification, and which is ne∣cessary for the inforcing the other two, is what they call a Stock, a very great Stock; not a Stock of Silver, nor yet of Gold, but of a Metal more powerful than either, and which commands them both. Now upon the Foot of these three Qualifications, who the Devil is half so well qualified for the writing a Comedy as thou art? Is it Pro∣ctor <HI>John Little-wit,</HI> or <HI>Scribble Dash</HI> the Inns of <HI>Chancery</HI> Bard? Or the Czar's old Soldier? Friend <HI>Pinky,</HI> thou art never mo∣dest but in the wrong Place.

For where as thou art a living breathing Come∣dy, they are a leash of dull Devils who are Tragedy all over. Their very Jests are deep Tragedy. They never endeavour to make us laugh but they move Terror and Compassion. Their very Offer at a Jest moves Terror, and 'tis no sooner out, but it moves Compassion. But as for thee, thou hast nothing to do but to write a long Part for thy self, and then, if thou hast no Jest in thy <HI>Chit Chat,</HI> thou wilt have a per∣petual one in thy Person, and that will do thy Business.</P>

And those Fools and Knaves, that are always in our way to perplex us, and disturb us here, ap∣pear at <HI>Southwick</HI> only to give you Joy: While the Calamities of Courts, and the Follies and Villainies of great Towns set before you, recommend the Security, the Charms and the Innocence of so sweet a Retreat the more to you.

Good God! How must they blush who spend great E∣states, or at least the Incomes of them, in turning Men into Beasts; while you with all the Oeconomy of Conduct have the Sa∣tisfaction of improving Beasts into Men! As all Men who are capable of thinking right, approve the Judgment of your Choice, so we who are passionate Friends to the Stage think it our Duty to return you Thanks for the timing it. For at the very time that several Persons, of the greatest Qua∣lity and the greatest Interest, have been en∣deavouring to banish the Drama from this Town and Island, and to introduce instead of it an effeminate Musick to emasculate the Minds of Men, to metamorphose the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Nation, and with Songs like those of the Syrens to change our very Kinds; you have generously made Choice of that very Time, to appear the great Encourager of the Dramatick Muses, and to afford them a Refuge, and a Retreat so charming, that while they are at <HI>Southwick</HI> they may not regret <HI>Parnassus.</HI> So generous a Pro∣ceeding

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Concerning the Proposal for the Security of Commerce.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have here the Honour to send Your Lordship the Abstract of that Proposal, which I laid before you about the middle of the last Sessions of Parliament. I did not think fit to remind Your Lordship of it before, because tho' you might have ap∣prov'd of it, it was then too late for the Parliament to go through it, and besides I had some Apprehension that that Parlia∣ment would not enter into it.</P>
<P>My Lord, at present I humbly conceive, with all imaginable Submission to your Lordship's Judgment, that the bringing this Proposal to Practice would be highly con∣venient, and perhaps necessary; absolute∣ly
<PB N="120" REF="134"/>
necessary, if the War is like to be of any long continuance, and highly conveni∣ent though it should be like to have a spee∣dy end: Because in this last Case, I hum∣bly conceive that we should have a better and more solid Peace than we should have without it. For nothing, with Submission to your Lordship's Judgment, would more alarm the <HI>French</HI> than the reducing this Proposal to Practice. For since they have but two ways of succeeding in their Designs against these Nations, which are the Dividing us at Home, and the ruining our Commerce Abroad; they would lose the very Hope of Success, if they should see themselves pre∣vented in both, to which the bringing this Proposal to Practice would contribute not a little. I have been told by so many understan∣ding People, that the general Insurance, which is a part of this Proposal, would bring in such considerable Sums into the <HI>Exchequer</HI> as would make it equivalent to almost any other Tax, that I can hardly doubt of it. My Lord, I humbly conceive that it would have some Advantages above all other Taxes. For as far as I am able to make a Judgment upon a four Years scrutiny, 'tis a Tax that is very much desir'd even after so long a War, and which is remarkable, it is most earnestly desir'd by those who are to pay the Money, because by this Tax something would be done for them preferably to the
<PB N="121" REF="135"/>
the rest of the People, which cannot be said of any other Tax; and whereas per∣haps by all other Taxes both Trade and the ordinary constant Revenue are consi∣derably diminish'd, they would not only be both improv'd and augmented by this, but the national Stock encreas'd, and the whole Confederacy strengthned and bound indissolubly. I shall have the Honour of waiting on your Lordship suddenly to know your Pleasure in this Affair. If your Lordship encourages me to lay this Pro∣posal before the House of Commons, I shall prepare an Appendix, by which I be∣lieve I can satisfie that Honourable House, that the Advantages mention'd both in the Proposal at large, and in the Abstract, will really accrue to us from putting that De∣sign in Practice.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have lately read over the Preface to a certain comical Rhapsody, with an odd mixture of Laughter and Indignation, upon which I shall here send you some Remarks that were made in a cursory manner. He pretends to turn your own Canon upon you, but he has done it to so fine a purpose that it has recoil'd with violence upon himself, and quite demolish'd the paltry Works he has rais'd.

Mr. <HI>Dry∣den</HI> tells us in his Preface to the <HI>Medal,</HI> that upon his writing <HI>Absalom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> he met with just such Adversaries. What Reflections he makes upon that notable way of proceeding, you will find in the

<P>He has very little Inclination, he says, to write Prefaces; because, I suppose, 'tis not so easie to steal Prefaces as Plays. However, as difficult as 'tis, he has brought it about. He has boldly seiz'd upon yours, and boasts of it as Plunder instead of Theft.</P>
<P>He neither commends nor defends the Play; which would be to waste his Breath, in commending <HI>Shirly</HI> and <HI>Taverner</HI>: But he spends his borrow'd Preface in com∣mending the Actors, who vouchsaf'd to be the Receivers and Venders of his stolen Goods. His <HI>Masquerade,</HI> he says, owes all his Success to them. And here the Pa∣negyrick which others bestow upon some one substantial Patron, he is for retailing among a Company of Actors, which he di∣stributes among them at so surprising a rate, that not a Mortal of them can pretend to any Share of it. For first, the Success of this Play is owing to the just Performance of the Players in general; then 'tis parti∣cularly owing to the Grace, which, with her usual Excellence, Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> gave to her Part. Indeed no one who has had the Happiness to know Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> can in the least doubt of her being qualified when∣ever she pleases to give extraordinary Plea∣sure by her Parts. But now to shew that Fools as well as Children are for Boys Play,
<PB N="124" REF="138"/>
this Person the very next Moment resumes the Commendation which he so very ge∣nerously granted to the Company in gene∣ral, and so very justly to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> in particular; and to shew his old Inclination to Arbitrary Power, pretends to make a fresh Grant of it for the sole use of Master <HI>Robert Wilks. The Success of this Come∣dy,</HI> says he, <HI>is owing entirely to Master</HI> Robert. Well! I have read many a gross, fulsome, flattering Fool, but I never read any one before, who was Fool enough to own, that he flatter'd grossly and fulsomly. For when he tells Mr. <HI>Robert Wilks,</HI> that the Success of the Play is entirely due to him, and in the same Breath tells the whole Company 'tis due to them, and in the same Breath tells Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> that 'tis very particularly due to her; what does he do but laugh in Master <HI>Robert</HI>'s Face, and tell him, that he takes him for the errantest Ba∣by that ever was bit at Bob-cherry. But now to shew that this Fellow is more Fool than Knave, and that he does not flatter on this Occasion so much as he thinks he does, and owns that he does, I will venture to bring him off a little; nay I will venture to shew, that when he says the Success of the Play is entirely due to Mr. <HI>Robert Wilks,</HI> he does not flatter at all. For I have heard a grave Bird sing, that if it had not been for him alone, the <HI>Masquerade</HI> had never

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember very well, that before I went out of Town in <HI>June</HI> last, I promis'd in a short time to give you some Ac∣count of the late <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. I make no doubt but that you have long before this time accus'd me of Breach of Promise. But if you did but know what charming Places I have been in, since I saw you last; and what damnable Company, for the most part, I have kept in them; how my Life has been chequer'd between Rapture and Chagrin, and consequently unable to turn it self to Business; did you but know this, I am con∣fident you would not blame me. Besides, I consider'd that Authors as well as Petti∣foggers ought to have long Vacation, and that it was but reasonable that the World should once a Year enjoy an Interval from being plagu'd with either; that it was highly expedient, that Minds sometimes should lye
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>
Fallow as well as Fields, as well as those Human Bodies which they inform; that they who are too often in the Act of Ge∣neration, produce but weak and puny Off∣springs, and peradventure none; and that the Scriblers and common Whores of that vile Town seldom beget any thing, unless something by Chance, that, like a <HI>Dutch Sooterkin,</HI> is at once frightful and con∣temptible, as all Monsters are. Besides, I thought it a Duty to my self, to recruit those Spirits, by a pleasing Indolence, which a long Misfortune had almost exhausted. And if at any time, in spight of these rea∣sonable Reflections, I resolv'd to set hear∣tily about the Performance of my Promise, I immediately started at the Thought of what I was about to undertake. For to make Remarks upon this <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (Death and Hell!) a Man must read it. And who that has Quails and <HI>Burgundy</HI> before him, would leave them for <HI>Porter</HI> and Ram Mutton? Besides, the Faults in it are so frequent and so gross, that every Fool may find them; and a Man cannot value him∣self, or expect that the reasonable Part of the World should value him for his Saga∣city or Penetration, on the account of ex∣posing them. I flatter my self, that you who have had a fourteen Years Experience of my Sincerity, will believe that I speak my Sentiments; at least I can assure you,
<PB N="128" REF="142"/>
that I have taken all imaginable Care, and have kept the most watchful Guard upon my self, that I might neither endeavour to deceive you thro' Malice, nor be my self deceiv'd thro' Prejudice. But since perhaps you, or somebody to whom you may shew this Letter, may be of another Opinion, I shall send you in a Day or two some Observations upon the first; which little may be enough to shew all the Beast.

<P>In this House, you must know, Sir, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> old Fanatical Pettifogger, who has lately

married a young Wife. There being not Room enough to receive her here, she lives at present with her Father, in a Village a∣bout seven Miles off. And the old Petti∣fogger ambles to her in his Gambadoes once a Week to pay his natural Tax: And then litterally returns to see his Uncle who is the Master of the House where we lodge. It happen'd about a Month ago that some Business obstructed his Journey; but ha∣ving procured a Barrel of Oysters, he or∣dered them with a Letter to be sent in his stead. The Letter was delivered to a Mar∣ket-Man, who came from the Village; and he was ordered to go to the Stable, and to take a Sack which he should find there, (in which the Oysters it seems were wrapt) which he was order'd to deliver to Spouse, with the Letter. In the mean while, as the Devil would have it, another Country∣man had laid another Sack there, which the former Country-man, who knew no∣thing of the Freight, took instead of that with the Oysters, carried it to the Village, and delivered it to Spouse with the Letter, which was to this Effect.</P>

<Q><L>I Who in Town was great as <HI>Caesar,</HI> </L><L>Am here reduc'd to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar.</HI></L></Q>
<P>That is, I have been for these three Weeks at Grass with meer white Cattle, and have not so much as seen three reasonable Crea∣tures, since I left the neighbourhood of <HI>Whitehall.</HI> When I arriv'd at this Place, I had the Mortification to find that of my two Landlords in whose Houses I had here formerly pass'd so many delicious Hours, the one was gone to live at <HI>Epsom,</HI> and the other was run quite away. Upon enqui∣ry, I found that there were but two Houses to lodge at, a common boarding House, or my Barber's. I consider'd that by going to the common boarding House, I should give up a good part of my Liber∣ty, which is the principal Thing that makes the Country so charming. For there might be Women at that House, or they might come the very Day after me, who, tho' old and ugly, might expect as much Cere∣mony
<PB N="133" REF="147"/>
as if they were young and beautiful. Now that Ceremony which passes hourly among some People, is founded, like Law, on a mutual Agreement between them, to give up part of their natural Liberty for the Benefit of Society. But tho' there is a sort of Necessity for an Observance of Forms and Ceremonies in great and Ca∣pital Towns; yet when a Man retires into the Country, he is desirous to be, for a while at least, like the Woods and Hills which he ranges, in the State of Na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure. I must consess that even in great Towns I have always had a very indif∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erent Opinion of a great deal of Cere∣mony, and have been always apt to be∣ieve, that as <HI>ubi plurimae leges pessima <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espublica,</HI> so where there is the most Ce∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emony, there is always the worst Soci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Return you Thanks for your agreea∣ble Relation of the Progress of the Iti∣nerant Doctor, who travels, it seems, like one of those foolish Fires, which lead People into Bogs and Ditches, whose Mis∣fortune it is to come in the way of their false and delusive Light. Upon the Re∣ceipt of your entertaining Letter, I made the following Queries to some of his gross Admirers.</P>
<P>Whether some People who practice Di∣vinity, tho' they are called Doctors, are not really Quacks; and whether Mountebanks Ecclesiastical as well as Secular, are not di∣stinguish'd from true Professors by the fol∣lowing Marks.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Whether the true Physician both of Soul and Body is distinguish'd from the Mountebank, not by wearing an Acade∣mical
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>
Bonnet, but by Wisdom, Learning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd a long Experience in the Art of Heal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng; and whether he who thro' want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese continually mistakes the Distemper of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Patient, and by Consequence admini∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters Poison to him, prescribes Opiates in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lethargy or Brandy in a Calenture, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ridiculous contemptible Empirick, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has been dubb'd both Batchelor and Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor at <HI>Oxford</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether the true Physician <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth of Soul and Body does not consult the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aie, and design the Health of the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody politick and the whole Body natural, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which 'tis his Fortune or Duty to admi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ster? Whereas the Quack of both kinds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever fails like the Tinker to make two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>oles, while he is emploied in mending of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e. For Example, the true Physician, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Body natural, purges and cleanses the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole Mass of Blood in order to the heal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g an Ulcer in the <HI>Pudenda</HI>; whereas the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpirick, by giving a sudden Check to it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rows it up into the nobler Parts: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Spiritual Physician of the Body Poli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck, is for saving every Soul of that Body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which he happens to be a Member; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereas the Ecclesiastical Empirick, as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were the first Plenipo of Heav'n, is for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>ing some and damning others with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>solute Power.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="150"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whether the true Physician does not keep his Station, and confine his Practice to his Neighbourhood; whereas Folly and Imposture, by remaining con∣stantly with the same People, would suf∣fer too much thro' too long an Inspection. And therefore the Mountebank finds his Account better in being Itinerant. And when he has cheated the Fools of one Ma∣joralty both of their Health and their Mo∣ney, seeks for fresh Cullies and fresh Idiots in a new Corporation.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Whether the true and the sound Physician is not satisfied with the Ap∣probation of his own Conscience, and of those who have common Sense? whereas the Mountebank makes it his Business to be the Idol of the Rabble, and therefore has much more numerous Aplauders than the true Physician. For Rabble is a most comprehensive Word, Doctor, and includes not only pitiful poor Mechanicks, and wretched Rogues in Rags, but many, nay very many Persons, who are distinguish'd by Fortune and dignified by Princes. This comprehensive Word, Doctor, includes all who want Understanding and Virtue. And so for Example the Rabble round the <HI>Wre∣kin</HI> includes not only the Butchers, the Tinkers, the Weavers and the Tailors of the adjacent Towns and Counties, but of∣ten likewise, too often, the Mayor, the
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
Sheriff, the Alderman and the Doctor, I mean the Mountebank both Spiritual and Secular; for every one who seeks the Ap∣plause of Rabble is himself most certainly Rabble; but how Emphatically, Doctor, are they Rabble, who are the Admirers and the Applauders of Rabble!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote to you this Morning for your more deliberate Opinion concerning the Passage of <HI>Phaedrus.</HI> I now send this to you to consult you about an Expression in the <HI>Othello</HI> of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long ago occasioned a great Dispute at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Coffee-House, between the Wits there and the Manager of the Play-House who acts the Part of <HI>Othello.</HI> The Wits asked the Player how he lik'd this Expression in his own Part, <HI>Excellent Wretch!</HI> to which the latter answer'd, that he lik'd it so ill, that he always left it out. Upon which they immediately extoll'd it to the Skies, and look'd upon the Player with great Con∣tempt. Tho' that Tragedian has no more Judgment in Tragedy than an Ass has in Musick, I am apt to believe that he was
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
this once in the right. I know indeed very well, that <HI>miser</HI> and <HI>misellus</HI> were some∣times among the <HI>Romans</HI> Terms of Ten∣derness. I find that <HI>miser</HI> is in that Sense in the Eunuch of <HI>Terence,</HI> Act the third Scene the last, where <HI>Chaerea</HI> gives <HI>Anti∣pho</HI> an Account of his enjoying <HI>Pamphila.</HI></P>

<P>Which Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has translated <HI>pau∣vre Garçon!</HI> But are there not two sorts of Tenderness, a Comick and a Tragick Ten∣derness? Now tho' <HI>miser</HI> was sometimes us'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> to express both the one and the other Tenderness, yet, in my Opinion, it can never be translated into <HI>English</HI> by the Word <HI>Wretch</HI> in any but the Comick way; <HI>Wretch</HI> in a serious Sense being al∣ways, if I am not mistaken, a Term of Re∣proach or Contempt: And consequently the Terms <HI>Excellent Wretch,</HI> being incon∣sistent and contradictory, make the mean∣ing absurd, and the Expression Nonsense. This is my Opinion at present, but I know not how long it will be so, because I have not as yet heard yours.</P>
<P>But that is not the only Point in which I desire it. I am told lately by one of my
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
Acquaintance, that I have been too severe upon the Understanding of another of the Managers, and that is of <HI>Cibber.</HI> And the Reason that was given me was, that <HI>Cibber</HI> writ <HI>the Fool in Fashion,</HI> which, says my Friend, you have often said is a good Co∣medy. To which I answer, that 'tis true, I have often said 'tis a good Comedy, but I had always much ado to believe that <HI>Cib∣ber</HI> writ it, and that since I have seen the <HI>Nonjuror</HI> and the <HI>Heroick Daughter</HI> I do not believe it at all. For which I shall give my Reasons, and afterwards desire to know from you how convincing they appear to you.</P>
<P>When <HI>the Fool in Fashion</HI> was first act∣ed, <HI>Cibber</HI> was hardly twenty Years of Age. Now could he at the Age of twenty write a Comedy with a just Design, distin∣guished Characters, and a proper Dia∣logue, who now at forty treats us with <HI>Hibernian</HI> Sense and <HI>Hibernian English?</HI> Could he, when he was an arrant Boy, draw a good Comedy, from his own raw uncultivated Head, who is now at forty able to do nothing but what is poor and mean, when he is supported by two such Masters as <HI>Moliere</HI> and <HI>Corneille?</HI></P>
<P>I have often observ'd to you, that there is not in his <HI>Heroick Daughter</HI> one Spark of the Force and noble Spirit of <HI>Corneille.</HI> As for <HI>Moliere,</HI> I am satisfied that he knows
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
nothing of him, but that he built his <HI>Non∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uror</HI> upon some spiritless dull Translation of him. When I heard that a Play with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Title was to be acted, I wish'd it as much Success as <HI>Cibber</HI> did, upon account of the Cause in which it was writ. But I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efus'd to see it acted, because knowing <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Play to be a Master-piece, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fraid I should be ask'd some Questions by my Friends which I should not care to an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer.

When I saw that the Curiosity of the World was pretty well over, I sent for the Play and read it. Upon the reading it, I was soon confirm'd in some of my former Thoughts, that Per∣sons of a very good Understanding might be impos'd upon at a Representation by the Liveliness and Grace of Action, and that the Excellence of the Actor often makes amends for the Imperfections of the Author. I soon found that there was little in the <HI>English</HI> Comedy of the Beauties of <HI>Moliere.</HI> For <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Characters in his <HI>Tartuffe</HI> are Master-pieces, mark'd, distin∣guish'd, glowing, bold, touch'd with a fine

His Dialogue too is lively, natural, graceful, easie, strong, adapted to the Occasion, adapted to the Characters. In short, 'tis by this Comedy and by the <HI>Misantrope</HI> that <HI>Moliere</HI> perhaps has born away the Prize of Comedy from all Persons in all Ages, ex∣cept <HI>Ben. Johnson</HI> alone. But the Chara∣cters of the <HI>English</HI> Comedy are most of them daub'd and bungled, and the Dia∣logue nothing but meer Fribble.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE last of <HI>July</HI> I had the Honour to return an Answer to your most obli∣ging and ingenious Letter. I have since had the Curiosity to enquire after the Priests whom you mention, but have been able to get no Intelligence; from which I conclude, that the Priests whom you men∣tion must be two or three scandalous <HI>Jaco∣bite</HI> Curates in your Neighbourhood. But whatever Ill they may say of me, I will pre∣sume that they do not call me Fool, which implies all other Infamies. For as <HI>Roche∣foucault</HI> says, a Fool has not Stuff enough to be good. I will presume they do not say of me, that every Word, that every Action of my Life is a Contradiction to common Honesty, and to common Sense; that tho' I am most sordidly interested and most ridiculously proud, I am endeavour∣ing with Might and Main to make my self most miserable and most despicable; that I am labouring with all my Might and with all my Strength to bring in a Tyrant in

<P>These, Sir, are things which I presume they do not say of me, because these are Encomiums which are only worthy of them, and which they have made upon themselves by their Actions.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On Two Verses in VIRGIL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Desir'd in my last that you wou'd be Arbitrator in a Dispute, which I lately had with Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> concerning some Verses of <HI>Virgil.</HI> The Passage is in the 3d Eclogue.</P>
<Q><L>Malo me Galatea petit lasciva puella,</L>
<L>Et fugit ad salices, &amp; se cupit antè videri.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> affirm'd that the Nymph in acting and the Shepherd in rela∣ting, meant nothing but Boys and Girls Play. My Opinion is, that such an Interpre∣tation renders the Passage wholly flat and insipid, and fit to please none but Children; that the Nymph by throwing the Apple, and then running away to the Willows, but at the same time taking care that the
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>
Shepherd should see her before she got to them, design'd Mans and Womans Play. Now, Sir, you are left to judge which of the Explications is most worthy of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and which comes nearest up to that <HI>Molle</HI> and that <HI>Facetum</HI> which at that time of Day compos'd the Character of <HI>Virgil,</HI> if we will take the Opinion of a very judi∣cious Critick, and that was his Friend <HI>Ho∣race</HI>;</P>
<Q><L>Molle atque Facetum</L>
<L>Virgilio annuerint gaudentes Rure Camaenae.</L></Q>
<P>For where is the <HI>Molle</HI> and the <HI>Facetum</HI> in these Verses, if the Nymph and the Shep∣herd, like Boys and Girls, were only at hide and seek? I could as soon believe that when <HI>Silenus</HI> in the Sixth Eclogue says, speaking of <HI>Aegle, Huic aliud mercedis erit,</HI> he only in∣tended to present her with a Pair of Gloves. I know indeed very well, that <HI>Ruaeus</HI> in∣terprets <HI>Lasciva</HI> by <HI>Jocosa Puella.</HI> But it ought to be consider'd, that <HI>Ruaeus</HI> was a Priest and that the Dauphin was young, and that it was the Business and Duty of the Jesuit to conceal from his young Pu∣pil the Lubricity of the Poet's meaning. Nor is <HI>Lasciva</HI> us'd upon this occasion, tho' 'tis taken in the common Sense so very different from <HI>Jocosa Puella,</HI> if we consider that <HI>Homer,</HI> whenever he has occasion to mention <HI>Venus,</HI> calls her the Laughter∣loving
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>
Goddess. Besides, my Antagonist does not seem enough to consider either the Nature of Women in general, or of the <HI>Italian</HI> Women in particular, or of the Season when this was suppos'd to hap∣pen, which was High Spring, (which is the Season of High Desire) as <HI>Palaemon</HI> gives us to understand a little before this Passage in three Verses, the two last of which are beautiful as their Subject.</P>
<Q><L>Dicite; quandoquidem in molli consedimus herbâ.</L>
<L>Et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos:</L>
<L>Nunc frondent Sylvae, nunc formosissimus annus.</L></Q>
<P>Now when we consider all these Things, can we believe that <HI>Virgil,</HI> who was so ju∣dicious, so wise, and who follow'd Na∣ture so closely, meant nothing but <HI>Hide and Seek</HI> by his <HI>se cupit antè videri.</HI> That which makes this one of the beautifullest Passages of all the Eclogues, is, that there is a very wanton Meaning express'd in very modest Words, and consequently occa∣sion given to the Reader to shew his Dis∣cernment by piercing the Veil which the Poet has thrown over the Nudity; which puts me in mind of a fine Passage of <HI>Mon∣taigne. Essay Lih.</HI> 3. <HI>Ch.</HI> 5.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="171"/><Q REND="inline"><P>The Verses of these two Poets (<HI>meaning</HI> Lucretius <HI>and</HI> Virgil) treating with so much Discretion and so much Reservedness of Lasciviousness, as they treat of it, do, as it were, discover more of it, and shew it in a better and nearer Light. Our Ladies cover their Breasts with a Veil, as our Priests do their sacred Things, and Pain∣ters shadow their finest Draughts in order to give them Lustre. They say, likewise, that the Rays of the Sun and the Strokes of the Mind are more forcible by Reflection than when they come directly. It was a wise Answer of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> to him who ask'd him, <HI>What doest thou carry con∣cealed there under thy Cloak? I carry it conceal'd thus under my Cloak, because thou shouldst not know what it is.</HI> But there are certain other things that are con∣cealed only on purpose to be shewn. <HI>Ovid</HI> is a great deal more bold, but therefore a great deal weaker than the other two. And when he says plainly</P>
<Q><L>Et nudam pressi corpus adusque meum.</L></Q>
<P>Methinks he makes an errant Capon of me, by his barefaced Lewdness. He who says all satiates and disgusts us; whereas he who expresses himself with Reserve and Caution, draws us in to imagine more, ev'n than he could have express'd. There is, as it
<PB N="158" REF="172"/>
were, Treachery in this kind of Modesty, since it slyly opens so inviting a Path to a wanton Imagination.</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far <HI>Montaigne.</HI> When he speaks of the Modesty of <HI>Lucretius,</HI> he means, I suppose, that Modesty which he shews in his Invo∣cation, where indeed in very modest Terms he treats of a very wanton Subject.</P>

First, the Author whom I have at present under Consideration has serv'd me as he deserves to be us'd himself, and has nail'd my Ears to his Book so fast, that I could not without Pain unclinch my self. The second Alleviation is the Con∣sideration of my Health. For though the Goddess smiles upon me here, she has as great an Aversion to old <HI>Sodom</HI> as <HI>Hugh Clodpate</HI> of merry Memory, and might for ought I know shake Hands with me at my Entrance into that damn'd Town.

Fables that are come from Father to Son, and are most in Vogue among the common People of the Countries thro' which I passed; for it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved by a Mul∣titude, tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation, which hath not in it some peculiar Aptness to please and gratify the Mind of Man.</Q></P>
<P>Now is there any thing that has the least Air of a Jest? On the other side, do you think that the Author could be capable of meaning and thinking what he pretends to affirm here? Is it not plain by the last Words which I have quoted, <HI>viz. the Mind of Man,</HI> that he intended a Fallacy? For to affirm this of the Mind of Man, as 'tis cultivated and instructed, is not only absurd and ri∣diculous, but contradictory of himself. Has not he himself observed in the 134th <HI>Tat∣ter,</HI> that there are Exercises and Diversi∣ons which universally please the Rabble, which yet Men of Quality or Education either despise or abhor? Such are the <HI>Shrove-Tuesday</HI> and <HI>Bear-Garden</HI> Diversi∣ons, which he there particularizes. I have known a Country Fidler who has been the Delight of three Counties, tho' he could never play the Truth of one Tune; and a Sign-Post Painter, who has been the Ad∣miration not only of the Rabble, but even of most of the Squires of the North of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="182"/>
I appeal to the Booksellers, who in this Case ought to be Judges without Appeal, whether more of the common People do not approve of <HI>Quarles</HI> and <HI>Bunyan</HI> than esteem <HI>Chevy Chase.</HI> Therefore 'tis plain that Au∣thor could not design that the Period a∣bove-mentioned should run thus,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">For 'tis impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved of by a Multitude, tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation, which has not in it some peculiar Aptness to please and gratify the Minds of Men of Quality and Education.</Q></P>
<P>And less can he design to make it run as follows: <Q REND="inline">For it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approv'd of by a Multitude, tho' they are only the Rab∣ble of a Nation, which has not in it some peculiar aptness to please and gratify the Minds of the Rabble.</Q> For to mean this would make, not only what he says, but what he is, a Jest. So that the Author, by <HI>the Mind of Man,</HI> meaning neither the Mind of Man as it is rude and untaught, nor the Mind of Man as 'tis cultivated and instructed, can mean nothing in the World but to try how far he can impose upon his Reader. But he goes on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Human Nature is the same in all rea∣sonable Creatures, and whatever falls in with it, will meet with Admirers among Readers of all Qualities and Conditions. <HI>Moliere,</HI> as we are told by <HI>Boileau,</HI> us'd
<PB N="169" REF="183"/>
to read all his Comedies to a little old Wo∣man, who was his House-Keeper, as she sate at her Work by the Chimney Corner, and could foretel the Success of his Play in his Theatre, from the Reception it met at the Fire Side. For he tells us the Au∣dience always follow'd the old Woman, and never failed to laugh in the same Place.</Q></P>
<P>Now can you, Sir, or any Man of good Sense believe that the Author does not know better what belongs to a Jest, than to take false Reasoning for one; and that he does not know better what belongs to false Reasoning than to mean what he says here? Can he be so dull and so absurd as not to know how to distinguish between what Human Nature is, and what Human Nature should be? Human Nature was Human Nature before the Fall, and 'tis Human Na∣ture now 'tis degenerated from that per∣fect Virtue and that unclouded Knowledge, which it enjoy'd before. 'Tis the Business and Design of Education to endeavour to retrieve in some measure the Loss that Hu∣man Nature has sustain'd by the Fall; and to recover some Measure of Knowledge and Virtue. Now Heroick Poetry is an Imi∣tation of Human Nature exalted, and Come∣dy is an Imitation of Human Nature depra∣ved. What can be more absurd than to con∣clude, that because the Rabble, that is, such as never had any Education, are tolerable Judges of Human Nature depraved, that therefore
<PB N="170" REF="184"/>
they are Judges of Human Nature exalted, of which none can be Judges but they who have had the best Education? And there∣fore not only the Rabble, but an universal Nation has been mistaken in their Judg∣ments of Poets and Poetry, when the Judg∣ments have been made, before that Nati∣on came to be sufficiently cultivated.</P>

<P>And to shew you that 'tis impossible the <HI>Spectator</HI> can mean what he says here, <HI>Ho∣race</HI> declares in the very Verse which the <HI>Spectator</HI> has chosen for the Motto of his Paper, that the Multitude is as often mi∣staken as it is in the Right.</P>

<P>Now is not here a Motto very judiciously chosen? For from these Verses of <HI>Horace,</HI> we may justly make this Observation, that a Man by his real Approbation and Imper∣tinent Commendation of superannuated Rhimes, not only puts himself upon an e∣qual Foot with the Rabble, but ev'n of the
<PB N="172" REF="186"/>
most injudicious and foolish part of the Rab∣ble?</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>Horace</HI> was so far from being of Opinion, that the universal Approbation of the Multitude was the Taste and Touch∣stone of good Poetry, that in the last Satyr of his first Book, he advises the Poet of his Formation to take no manner of Care about pleasing them.</P>
<Q><L>—Neque Te, ut miretur turba labores</L>
<L>Contentus paucis lectoribus.</L></Q>
<P>Now this Advice of <HI>Horace</HI> must either be impertinent and wrong, or the Approbati∣on of the Multitude is a Sign of an ill Poem. But 'tis time to see how this judicious Au∣thor goes on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">I know nothing that more shews the es∣sential and inherent Perfection of Simpli∣city of Thought, above that which I call the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner in writing, than this, that the first pleases all kinds of Palates, and the latter only such as have formed to themselves a wrong artificial Taste upon little fanciful Authors and Writers of Epi∣grams. <HI>Homer, Virgil,</HI> or <HI>Milton,</HI> so far as the Language of their Poems is under∣stood, will please a Reader of plain com∣mon Sense, that would neither relish nor comprehend an Epigram of <HI>Martial,</HI> or a Poem of <HI>Cowley</HI>; so on the contrary, an or∣dinary
<PB N="173" REF="187"/>
Song or Ballad that is the Delight of the common People, cannot fail to please all such Readers as are not unqualified for the Entertainment by their Affectation or their Ignorance, and the Reason is plain, because the same Paintings of Nature which re∣commend it to the most ordinary Reader, will appear beautiful to the most refin'd.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, can any thing be more plain, than that the <HI>Spectator</HI> here cannot mean what he says? Because 'tis impossible for a Man of common Sense, much less for one of his notable Parts, to be guilty of so many Absurdities as there are in this little Para∣graph. I will make no Objection at pre∣sent about the <HI>Gothick</HI> Taste. I think I have call'd it somewhere so my self, tho' tis certain that the pointed conceited way of Wit was in Fashion long before the <HI>Goths</HI> were either a Name or a Nation. For you find it not only in <HI>Florus,</HI> in <HI>Martial,</HI> in <HI>Seneca,</HI> in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> but even in some of the Writers of <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI>'s Age, as <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Paterculus.</HI> But here are more Im∣portant Errors to be taken Notice of. For first, the <HI>Spectator</HI> would make us believe that all People are Judges of Simplicity of Thought, and that the Rabble are better Judges of it, than they who have had a gene∣rous Education. That more People compre∣hend the Excellency of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> than the Beauties of <HI>Martial</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="188"/>
and <HI>Cowley,</HI> tho' perhaps there are not ten Persons living who know all the Merit of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradise Lost</HI> had been printed forty Years before it was known to the greatest Part of <HI>England,</HI> that there barely was such a Book. He would further insinuate, that all those Songs or Ballads, which are the delight of the Rab∣ble, cannot fail to please all such Readers as are not unqualified for the Entertain∣ment by their Affectation or their Igno∣rance; as if Men of Education in <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> were more ignorant than the Rabble, or it requir'd an extraordinary Stock of Knowledge to comprehend the Excellence of old Dogrel. The Reason which he gives for this, and which he says is plain, is, because the same Paintings of Nature which recommend it to the most ordinary Reader, will appear beautiful to the most refin'd; as if some faint and imperfect Touches of Nature might not recommend a thing to those by reason of their Igno∣rance or their Stupidity, know not how far an Author ought to go in such a Case to express the Truth of Nature, which faint and imperfect Strokes would by no means satisfy those who are able to judge of that Truth.</P>
<P>Sir, the <HI>Spectator</HI> imagines here, that there is nothing contrary to Simplicity of Thought, but that pointed conceited way
<PB N="175" REF="189"/>
of writing which we mention'd above, whereas Simplicity of Thought, is Thought which naturally arises from the Subject, Ideas which bear a just Proportion to the Things they represent, and which the Sub∣ject seems of it self as it were to offer to us, instead of our obtruding them upon that. If we truly consider what Simplicity of Thought in Poetry is, we shall find that there are three things which are equally distant from it, and those are, Imbecility, Affectation and Extravagance; Imbecility, when a Man wants Force to come up to the Truth of Nature; Affectation, when a Man goes beside it, thro' Error, Luxury and Wantonness of Soul; and Extravagance, when a Man goes beyond it, thro' a false and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll-tim'd Effort to shew his Strength and Excellence. We shall find too that Sim∣plicity of Thought is not sufficient to make what we call Metre Poetry; that there must be likewise a Simplicity of Expression; that a Simplicity of Expression is an Expressi∣on which is according to Nature, that is an Expression proportion'd to the Ideas, as they are to the Things, and that consequently then the Expression in great Subjects, and in great Thoughts is simple, when it is passionate, figurative, sounding and har∣monious; and that an Author, who in great Subjects and in great Thoughts shews an Expression, which comes short of this,
<PB N="176" REF="190"/>
shews not a Simplicity but an Imbecility of Expression. In short, as all the Heroick Virtues are compatible with Simplicity of Heart, so all the Magnificence of the most pompous Eloquence is on some Occasions consistent with Simplicity of Style. But now let us see a little how the <HI>Specta∣tor</HI> goes on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">The old Song of <HI>Chevy Chase, says he,</HI> is the favourite Ballad of the common Peo∣ple of <HI>England</HI>; and <HI>Ben Johnson</HI> us'd to say, he had rather have been the Author of it, than of all his Works. Sir <HI>Philip Sid∣ney,</HI> in his Discourse of Poetry, speaks of it in the following Words. I never heard the old Song of <HI>Piercy</HI> and <HI>Douglas,</HI> that I found not my Heart more mov'd than with a Trumpet, and yet it was sung by some blind Crowder with a Voice as rough as his Style, which being so evil apparrel∣led in the Dust aad Cobweb of that un∣civil Age, what would it work trimm'd in the gorgeous Eloquence of <HI>Pindar</HI>? For my own part, <HI>says the <HI>Spectator</HI>,</HI> I am so pro∣fessed an Admirer of this antiquated Song, that I shall give my Reader a Critick upon it, without any further Apology for so do∣ing.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, as I shew'd you before by his Sophistry, that the <HI>Spectator</HI> is not in ear∣nest; so here it may appear by the Autho∣rities he brings that he is not in Jest. I am
<PB N="177" REF="191"/>
so very well convinced of the solid Judg∣ment of <HI>Ben. Johnson,</HI> that if <HI>Ben.</HI> ever talk'd at that rate, (which I will not abso∣utely pretend to deny, tho' I very much doubt it) he only did it to laugh, and to ridicule some of the sottish Admirers of that obsolete Song. As for Sir <HI>Philip Sid∣ney,</HI> do but observe the Expression which that noble Gentleman uses; he tells us not that his Heart was moved by the Song of <HI>Piercy</HI> and <HI>Douglas</HI> as often as he read it, or heard it read, but as often as he heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sung, nay, tho' it was sung by an old Crowder. I shrewdly suspect that there were some martial Notes in this old <HI>Go∣thick</HI> Tune, which very much contributed to the working that Effect upon Sir <HI>Philip Sidney.</HI> But instead of affirming that Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI> has gone too far, he pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds to insinuate that he falls too short; for the <HI>Spectator</HI> vindicates the very Expres∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of <HI>Chevy Chase,</HI> in which one thing, I ,ust confess, he does seem to me to come something near to a Jest, and to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ne ironical Ridicule upon Sir <HI>Philip Sid∣ney.</HI> But be these things as they will, be∣sides that thro' the whole Course of this Criticism I have and shall oppose greater Authorities to these, I shall confound them by invincible Reason, before which no Au∣thority could ever stand; and by shewing he Nature of Poetry, and what it is that
<PB N="178" REF="192"/>
constitutes the Difference between that and Prose, shall make it appear that the Writer of this old Song, in spight of the Applause of so many Ages, never knew what Poetry was. In order to which, let us give very near the same Account of it that we for∣merly did in the <HI>Grounds of Criticism in Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>Poetry then is an Art, by which a Poet excites Passion, (and to that very end en∣tertains Sense) by a bold and figurative Language, and by measur'd harmonious Pe∣riods, in order to satisfy and improve, to delight and reform the Mind, and so to make Mankind happier and better.</P>
<P>Poetry therefore is Poetry, because 'tis more passionate and sensual than Prose. A Poet has two ways of exciting Passion. The one by the Figurativeness, and the other by the Harmony of his Expression; but the Figures contribute more to the exciting of Passion than Harmony. A Discourse that is writ in smooth and tolerable Num∣bers, if 'tis not figurative can be but mea∣sur'd Prose; but a Discourse that is every where bold and figurative, and consequent∣ly every where extremely pathetick, is cer∣tainly Poetry without Numbers. Beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this alone is a convincing Proof that a Fi¦gurative Expression is more essential <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Poetry than Harmony, <HI>viz.</HI> that Harmony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> self, if 'tis any thing perfect, depends up¦on
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>
a figurative Expression; there being no Example among the Antients themselves of a Ravishing Poetical Musick, without figu∣rative Language. But as the Language of Poetry in general is to be bold and figu∣rative, the Language of great and exalted Poetry is to be very bold and figurative. The Doctrine of <HI>Horace</HI> is exactly answerable to this.</P>
<Q><L>Primum ego me illorum, dederim quibus esse poetas,</L>
<L>Excerpam numero: neque enim concludere versum</L>
<L>Dixeris esse satis; neque siquis scribat, utinos,</L>
<L>Sermoni propiora, putes hunc esse poetam.</L>
<L>Ingenium cuisit, cuimens divinior, atque os</L>

<L>Idcirco quidam, Comaedia necne poema</L>

<L>Nec verbis, nec rebus inest: nisi quod pede certo</L>
<L>Differt sermoni, sermo merus.</L></Q>
<P>For he tells us here three things in a very conspicuous manner. First, that poetical Measures are not sufficient to constitute a Man a Poet.</P>
<Q><L>—Neque enim concludere versum</L>
<L>Dixeris esse satis.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="180" REF="194"/>
Secondly, that there must be great Passi∣on, and a bold and a figurative Language, nay very bold and very figurative.</P>
<Q><L>Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior, atque os</L>
<L>Magna sonaturum: des nominis bujus ho∣norem.</L></Q>
<P>And Thirdly, That it was to be que∣stioned whether any thing but the great and exalted Poetry was properly Poetry.</P>
<Q><L>Idcirco quidam, Comaedia necne poema</L>
<L>Esset quaesivere: quod acer Spiritus, ac vis,</L>
<L>Nec verbis, nec rebus inest.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Boileau</HI> is exactly of the same Opinion, and has in his Ninth Satyr as it were interpret∣ed part of this Passage of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Mais Repondez un peu, qu'elle verve indi∣screte</L>
<L>Sans l'aveu des neuf soeurs vous a rendu Poete?</L>
<L>Senties vous dites moy ces violens trans∣ports,</L>
<L>Qui d un Esprit Divin, font mouvoir les res∣sorts.</L></Q>
<P>And in his Eighth Reflection upon <HI>Lon∣ginus,</HI> he tells us plainly that Monsieur <HI>Perrault</HI> having translated the beginning
<PB N="181" REF="195"/>
of the first Ode of <HI>Pindar</HI> without Figures, has translated it without Poetry.</P>
<P><HI>Rapin</HI> is exactly of the same Mind in his Twenty Ninth Reflection upon Poetry in general. For having told us that <HI>Virgil</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Fourth of his Georgicks, speaks of the Bees every where in the metaphorical Terms of Court, Legions, Armies, Com∣bats, Fields of Battel, Kings, Captains, Sol∣diers, that by this figurative and lofty man∣ner he may exalt the Lowness of his Mat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er; he adds,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">C'est ainsi qu'un grand Ouvrier comme Virgile, ne dit presque rien dans le propre, &amp; c'est en quoy consiste le grand art de la Poesie, de dire Figurement presque tout ce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u'elle dit. Car d' ordinaire les Figures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnissent des plus grands images que les <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoses mêmes. Enfin le Poete doit scavoir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> toutes choses, ce que l' Eloquence a d' art &amp; de methode pour les Figures. Ce n'est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue par les Figures qu'il donne de la Force <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ux Passions, de l' eclat aux Discours, du <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ids aux Raisons, &amp; de l' agreement a tout <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> qu'il dit.

<P>Thus a great Master like <HI>Virgil</HI> scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys any thing in plain Language; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat Art of Poetry consists in saying al∣most every thing that is said figuratively.
<PB N="182" REF="196"/>
For the Figures generally supply us with Images greater than the Things themselves. In short, a Poet ought to be possessed of all that Art and that Method in which E∣loquence is design'd to instruct us with re∣gard to the Figures. They are the Figures that enable him to give Force to the Pas∣sions, Brightness to the Diction and to the Periods, Weight to his Arguments, and Charms to all that he says. And 'tis only by the liveliest Figures of Eloquence that all the Motions of the Soul become ardent and pathetick.</P>
<P>As for Simplicity, of which the <HI>Specta∣tor</HI> boasts so much, the foresaid <HI>Rapin</HI> has remarkably told us, in his Twenty Seventh Reflection, that the Simplicity of Thought and even Simplicity of Expression in great Subjects is not incompatible with the greatest Pomp and Magnificence. For Simplicity of Thought and Simplicity of Expression is nothing but such Thought and such Ex∣pression, as Nature in such and such Cases voluntarily suggests and dictates to us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">La Troisieme qualité de la Diction, <HI>says</HI> Rapin, est qu'elle soit naturelle, sans affe∣ctations, selon les Regles de la Biensance &amp; du bon sens.

<P>The Third Quality of the Diction is that it ought to be natural, without any man∣ner of Affectation, according to the Rules of Decorum and of good Sense. Phrases that appear too much studied, a Style that is too florid, a Manner that is too nicely wrought, Things that are finely said, Terms that are too far fetch'd, and all Expres∣sions that are windy and swell Use, are insupportable to the true Poetry. Only Simplicity can agree with it, provided that Simplicity be sustain'd by Nobility and by Greatness. But that is a Simplicity with which only great Souls are acquainted. 'Tis the Master-work of Poetry, and the Character of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> The Ig∣norant look for what they call Wit and fine Thoughts, because they are ignorant. The fourth Quality of the Diction is, that it be exalted and sonorous. For every thing that is vulgar in the Expression is below it. It requires Words which have nothing that is base and common in them, a Diction that is noble and magnificent, Expressions that are strong, and Colours that are lively, and daring and audacious Strokes. It requires, to say all, a Discourse that is able to come up to the Greatness of that Workman's Ideas, who ought to be the Maker and Creator of his own Works. The fifth
<PB N="185" REF="199"/>
Quality of the Diction is that it be harmo∣nious, that it may maintain that great and majestick Air, with which Poetry is wont to adorn it self, and may express all the Force and the utmost Dignity of the great Things which it utters. It ought to reject all Terms but those that are proper to fill the Mouth and content the Ear, that it may attain to that Sublime and that Won∣derful, which it always and every where aims at. But 'tis not sufficient that there be Greatness and Magnificence in the Ex∣pression, there ought to be likewise Ardor and Vehemence, and there ought especially to reign throughout the Discourse, a fine, a graceful, and a delicate Air, which ought to appear its principal Ornament, and its most universal Beauty.</P>
<P>Now what one of these great Qualities has the old Ballad of <HI>Chevy Chase?</HI> Of all the Lines which the Captain has quoted, 'tis remarkable, that there is but one which has any thing like a Figure in it. Now tho' the Subject of that Song is noble, yet there being nothing figurative in it, 'tis plain by consequence that there is nothing great, nothing noble in it; no Magnificence, no Vehemence, no Painting, no Poetry. To compare any of the Passages in it to <HI>Virgil</HI> is ridiculous, and a Man may as well com∣pare a dead Man to a living. For Exam∣ple,
<PB N="186" REF="200"/>
what manner of Comparison is there between these two Passages.</P>
<Q><L>The Hounds ran swiftly thro' the Wood</L>
<L>The nimble Deer to take,</L>
<L>And with their Cries the Hills and Dales</L>
<L>An Eccho shrill did make.</L></Q>
<P>And that of <HI>Virgil,</HI></P>
<Q><L>—vocat ingenti clamore Cithaeron</L>
<L>Taygetique canes, Domitrixque Epidaurus equorum</L>
<L>Et vox assensu nemorum ingeminata remugit.</L></Q>
<P>What is there in the first but what is vile and trivial? What Ploughman, what Tink∣er, what Trull is not capable of saying the like? But that of <HI>Virgil,</HI> where he gives Voice to the Mountains, and Voice, Con∣sent and Soul to the Words, is so bold, so figurative, so pompous, so harmonious, that a Man must be <HI>Virgil</HI> himself to say it. What can be more ridiculous, nay more monstrous, than to find any thing resem∣bling in the following abominable Dogrel,</P>
<Q><L>Sir <HI>Charles Martell</HI> of <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> too,</L>

<L>Sir <HI>David Lamb</HI> so well esteem'd,</L>

<Q><L>—Cadit &amp; Ripheus, justissimus unus</L>
<L>Qui fuit in Teucris &amp; servantissimus Aequi</L>
<L>Diis aliter visum.</L></Q>
<P>Where the divine Harmony is the Result of uncommon Passion, and productive of no vulgar Passion. Thus we see, that in spight of the pretended Resemblance, the old Dogrel is contemptible, and <HI>Virgil</HI> is incomparable and inimitable. One might with a great deal more Justice pretend, that there is a Resemblance between the 148th Psalm of <HI>Sternhold,</HI> and that admirable Hymn of <HI>Milton</HI> in the Fifth Book of <HI>Pa∣radise Lost.</HI> And yet we need only tran∣scribe them both, and place them together here, to convince the Reader, that the one is bald, and vile, and wretched, and the o∣ther great and exalted Poetry. Let us be∣gin with the Psalm of <HI>Sternhold.</HI></P>

Thus have we laid before the Reader the contemptible Dogrel of <HI>Hopkins</HI>; a Ver∣sion which is despicable Dogrel in spight of its being figurative. For every Line here is a different Apostrophe. But these are Figures which are another Person's, which the Transverser repeats like a Parrot, with∣out understanding them, and without being mov'd by them, and which consequently have neither Passion nor Sublimity to su∣stain them. For 'tis a just Observation which is made by <HI>Longinus,</HI> that as the Fi∣gures support the pathetick and the sub∣lime, they are wonderfully supported by each of them. Let us now see how the Force of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Genius hides and con∣ceals the Assistance of Art, while these lof∣ty Figures, at the very time that they raise and transport his exalted Soul, are lost in his Enthusiasm and his Sublimity, as the glittering of numberless Stars is swallow'd and lost in the blaze of Day, and that gold∣en Deluge of Light which on every side overwhelms them. The following Hymn is spoken by our first Parents, in the Mor∣ning, at what time they first come out of the Bower in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and survey the Works of God which the springing Day has restor'd to them.</P>

<P>Now I think nothing can be more plain than that notwithstanding the same Psalm of <HI>David</HI> is the groundwork both of <HI>Mil∣ton</HI> and <HI>Sternhold,</HI> and notwithstanding a vain Appearance which may delude those who are not able to distinguish, there is no more Resemblance between the Hymn of <HI>Milton,</HI> and the Version of <HI>Sternhold,</HI> than there is between Light and Darkness, Heat and Cold, Life and Death, Heaven and Earth, the Graces and Deformity, no not∣withstanding they both make use of the very same Figures; but those Figures in <HI>Sternhold</HI> are dead, and he himself seems dead: and while he pretends to give Life and Soul, and Thought, and Spirit, and Motion, even to the insensible and inani∣mated Parts of the Universe; he is him∣self without Spirit, or Life, or Soul, or
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
Thought, or Motion; while <HI>Milton</HI>'s matchless Genius, animating the several Fi∣gures, appears to give Life, and Soul, and Motion to their several Objects; and seems to equal these several mighty Objects in their distinguishing Qualities, to be lofty as the Heav'n and solid as the Earth, firey as the Sun, and changing as the Moon, swift as the Winds, and strong, and terrible, and so∣norous as the Arms and Mouths of the great Deep. Since then there is no man∣ner of Resemblance between the Hymn and the Version, which seem to have several things in common, what Shadow of Like∣ness can there be between <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Dogrel, where there is nothing com∣mon between them, nor Ground-work, nor Figure, nor Harmony; the Dogrel be∣ing utterly destitute both of Figure and Harmony, and consequently void of the great Qualities which distinguish Poetry from Prose.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE among the rest of the Obligati∣ons which I have to you, you have been so generous as to defend me from that Accusation of Ill-nature, which has been brought against me by some who are so far from knowing me, that perhaps they never saw me; I am animated by so friendly a Proceeding to send you my Thoughts upon this subject, as they have from time to time come into my Mind, as well as I am able to recollect them, in that ill State of Health under which I la∣bour at present.</P>
<P>As this Accusation is brought against me by those who are utter Strangers to me, it must proceed from the Books which I have publish'd, and particularly from the Books of Criticism. But if in my Criticism I am in the right, my very being so must be a sufficient Apology a∣gainst
<PB N="202" REF="218"/>
that Accusation. For he who ac∣cuses a Man of Ill-nature for writing a just Criticism, knows not what is meant by either of the Terms, either by Ill-nature or Criticism. By Ill-nature must be meant something that is contrary to the true Na∣ture of Man, as by Good-nature must be understood something that is agreeable to it, or the one can be no Term of Re∣proach, nor the other of Commendation. But the true Nature of Man must consist in Reason, which distinguishes him from all other Creatures, and therefore no Dis∣course or Action that is reasonable can possibly denominate him ill-natur'd.</P>
<P>But as the true Nature of Man is rea∣sonable, it is likewise social; and Man is therefore the most social of Creatures, be∣cause he is the most reasonable. Now a just Criticism is perfectly agreeable to the Nature of Man consider'd as 'tis social. For what does the good Critic design? he designs to detect and disgrace Errour, to disclose and honour Truth; he designs the Advancement of a noble Art, and by it the Interest and Glory of his Native Country, which depend in no small measure upon the flourishing of Arts.</P>
<P>If he has the greatest Goodness of Na∣ture, who has the largest share of social Virtue; if he has the largest share of social Virtue, who labours most for the Happi∣ness
<PB N="203" REF="219"/>
of the Society in which he lives, and of all his Fellow-Creatures in general; if the Happiness of ones Native Country, and of Humankind in general, depend more, under God, upon the Maintenance of Liberty, than upon any other thing whatsoever; who can justly pretend (not only of the Writers of the present Age, but of the <HI>English</HI> Writers in general) to a greater Goodness of Nature than my self, who have made it the constant Busi∣ness of my Life to defend and maintain Liberty? Who has taken more delight in praising her Benefactor, or in branding and defaming her avowed and mortal E∣nemies? In short, Sir, Liberty has been the continual Theme of my Pen, and the constant Employment of my Life. And have I taken all this Pains for my self? No. I wanted not common Sense to discern that the <HI>British</HI> Liberties would be of longer continuance than my Life. But the growing Corruptions of my Countrymen gave me too just grounds to apprehend that Liberty in <HI>Great Britain</HI> would not last many Centuries. I therefore resolv'd to cast in my Mite towards the rendring it perpetual in this Island. And yet I knew very well and foresaw, that by this very Endeavour to serve them, I should draw upon me the Hatred of a great part of my Countrymen, and by consequence a

thousand different Slanders. They have given me distempers of Body, and defects of Mind, of which I have not the least Knowledge; and the Opinion of my Ill∣nature has proceeded as much from my Endeavours to maintain and prolong Li∣berty, and by consequence to perpetu∣ate Happiness to them and to their Posteri∣ty, as from my detecting and exposing suc∣cessful Poetasters. For which if I am sor∣ry for my self, I am more sorry for my Country, for a People so dispos'd can be free no longer than their Rulers are will∣ing they should be so. I am in so faint and languishing a Condition, that I can pro∣ceed no further, tho' I have many things to say. But I will certainly resume this Subject, if I ever retrieve my Vigour.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was so very much tyr'd the last Post with sending away several Letters, that I was incapable of writing any thing that could have been agreeable to you, tho' it had been never so short. I am sorry to hear of the Complaints you make of the Effects of the Spleen. I desire you to pardon my plain-dealing, which proceeds purely from that Esteem and Affection which I have always had for you ever since I had the Honour to know you; be∣fore I venture to tell you, that a Person of your Fortune and Understanding need not have the Spleen any longer than he pleases. The Spleen is nothing but the Effect of Stagnation, and the Motion of vigorous Exercise must and will cure it. Take a gentle trotting Horse, and an honest care∣ful Servant, and come up and see your old Friends and this wicked Town but for one
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
Fortnight, and if the Journey to this Town and back again into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and the strange Sights which you will see here, do not remove the Spleen for one six Months, I will be contented to have it for twelve. For you who have now been absent twen∣ty Years, will find here a Town entirely new; new Buildings, new Men, new Manners; Avarice, and Luxury, and Profusion joyn∣ed in a Triple League, and Liberty, Pro∣perty and Religion engag'd in a Battel Roy∣al. You will find here entirely new Setts of all Sorts of Men; new Players at Chess, who never could yet see two Removes be∣fore them; new Whigs without one Dram of Publick Spirit; and new Wits and Poets without one Grain of Common Sense. You will find a new Idol worship'd in the midst of a Christian Country, a base, dirty, contemptible Idol, worship'd by all that once was thought great and noble and esti∣mable. You will find his Temple in the midst of that Country's Metropolis, a Tem∣ple as dirty and despicable as its Deity; a Temple without either Roof, or Door, or Desk, or Pew, or Altar, yet its pragmati∣cal Priests as proud as they are base and sordid; his Priests compos'd of insolent Cits, and Pe<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rs and Pr<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>es his humble Worshippers, who humbly worship, nay abjectly adore both the Idol and his Priests;
<PB N="213" REF="229"/>
you will see his Worshippers arrive in Crowds from Morning to the Evening, and mingled in his Temple in as monstrous a manner as the Elements were in Chaos, where Fire with Water, Earth with Air were blended and confounded. As all these Sights will be new, I believe they will be very diverting; and what will be as new and as diverting as all the rest, you will see in this Town old Friends with new Shapes and Faces. For Example, you will find your old Friend Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> dwindled to those narrow Dimensions in which you formerly beheld me, and your humble Servant en∣larg'd to his <HI>quondam</HI> noble Bulk and Pro∣portions.</P>

<HEAD>To the Honourable Major PACK.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing some remarkable Passages of Mr. WYCHERLEY's Life.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have lately had the Satisfaction to read over your Memoirs of Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> which I had last Week from Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> and found the Relation very entertaining and the Reflections just and pathetick. If I give you Hints of some particular Passages which seem either to have slipt from your Memory, or to have esca∣ped your Knowledge, I flatter my self that you will receive them kindly, since they are only sent with Intention to give you an Opportunity, whenever you have a mind to retouch your Memoirs, to make them more compleat, tho' they cannot be more agreeable.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, to enter upon the Sub∣ject, without any more Ceremony. I ne∣ver
<PB N="215" REF="231"/>
could learn, either from Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> himself, or from Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> or Sir <HI>Har∣ry Sheer,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Walkeden,</HI> or from any of those who had been longest acquainted with Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> that he had ever re∣sided at either of our Universities. About the Age of Fifteen he was sent for Education to the Western Parts of <HI>France,</HI> either to <HI>Saintonge</HI> or the <HI>Angoumois.</HI> His Abode there was either upon the Banks of the <HI>Charante,</HI> or very little remov'd from it. And he had there the Happiness to be in the Neighbourhood of one of the most ac∣complish'd Ladies of the Court of <HI>France, Madame de Montausier,</HI> whom <HI>Voiture</HI> has made famous by several very ingenious Let∣ters, the most of which were writ to her when she was a Maid, and call'd <HI>Mada∣moiselle de Rambouillet.</HI> I have heard Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> say, that he was often admitted to the Conversation of that Lady, who us'd to call him the Little <HI>Hugenot</HI>; and that young as he was, he was equally pleas'd with the Beauty of her Mind, and with the Graces of her Person.</P>
<P>Upon the writing his first Play, which was <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> he became acquainted with several of the most celebrated Wits both of the Court and Town. The writing of that Play was likewise the Occasion of his becom∣ing acquainted with one of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Mistesses after a very particular manner.
<PB N="216" REF="232"/>
As Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was going thro' <HI>Pall-mall</HI> towards St. <HI>James</HI>'s in his Chariot, he met the foresaid Lady in hers, who, thrusting half her Body out of the Chariot, cry'd out aloud to him, <HI>You,</HI> Wycherley, <HI>you are a Son of a Whore,</HI> at the same time laugh∣ing aloud and heartily. Perhaps, Sir, if you never heard of this Passage before, you may be surpris'd at so strange a Greet∣ing from one of the most beautiful and best bred Ladies in the World. Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was certainly very much surpris'd at it, yet not so much but he soon apprehended it was spoke with Allusion to the latter End of a Song in the foremention'd Play.</P>
<Q><L>When Parents are Slaves</L>
<L>Their Brats cannot be any other,</L>
<L>Great Wits and great Braves</L>
<L>Have always a Punk to their Mother.</L></Q>
<P>As, during Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Surprise, the Chariots drove different ways, they were soon at a considerable Distance from each other, when Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> recovering from his Surprise, ordered his Coachman to drive back, and to overtake the Lady. As soon as he got over-against her, he said to her, <HI>Ma∣dam, you have been pleased to bestow a Title on me which generally belongs to the For∣tunate. Will your Ladyship be at the Play to Night? Well,</HI> she reply'd, <HI>what if I am</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="233"/>
<HI>there? Why then I will be there to wait on your Ladyship, tho' I disappoint a very fine Woman who has made me an Assignati∣on. So,</HI> said she, <HI>you are sure to disappoint a Woman who has favour'd you for one who has not. Yes,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>if she who has not favour'd me is the finer Woman of the two. But he who will be constant to your Ladyship, till he can find a finer Woman, is sure to die your Captive.</HI> The Lady blush'd, and bade her Coachman drive away. As she was then in all her Bloom, and the most celebrated Beauty that was then in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or perhaps that has been in <HI>England</HI> since, she was touch'd with the Gallantry of that Compliment. In short, she was that Night in the first Row of the King's Box in <HI>Drury Lane,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the Pit under her, where he entertained her during the whole Play. And this, Sir, was the beginning of a Correspondence between these two Persons, which afterwards made a great Noise in the Town.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, I shall proceed to remind you of something more extraordinary, and that is, that the Correspondence between Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and the foresaid Lady was the Occasion of bringing Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in∣to favour with <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham,</HI> who was passionately in Love with that Lady, who was ill treated by her, and who believed Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> his happy Ri∣val.
<PB N="218" REF="234"/>
After the Duke had long sollicited her without obtaining any thing, whether the Relation between them shock'd her, for she was his Cousin-Germain, or whe∣ther she apprehended that an Intrigue with a Person of his Rank and Character, a Per∣son upon whom the Eyes of all Men were fix'd, must of Necessity in a little time come to the King's Ears, whatever was the Cause, she refus'd to admit of his Visits so long, that at last Indignation, Rage and Disdain took Place of his Love, and he re∣solv'd to ruin her. When he had taken this Resolution, he had her so narrowly watch'd by his Spies, that he soon came to the Know∣ledge of those whom he had reason to be∣lieve his Rivals. And after he knew them, he never fail'd to name them aloud, in or∣der to expose the Lady, to all those who frequented him, and among others he us'd to name Mr. <HI>Wycherley.</HI> As soon as it came to the Knowledge of the latter, who had all his Expectations from the Court, he apprehended the Consequence of such a Report, if it should reach the King. He applied himself therefore to <HI>Wilmot</HI> Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> and to Sir <HI>Charles Sedley,</HI> and entreated them to remonstrate to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> the Mischief which he was about to do to one who had not the Ho∣nour to be known to him, and who had never offended him. Upon their opening
<PB N="219" REF="235"/>
the Matter to the Duke, he cry'd out im∣mediately, <HI>that he did not blame</HI> Wycherley, <HI>he only accus'd his Cousin. Ay, but,</HI> they reply'd, <HI>by rendring him suspected of such an Intrigue, you are about to ruine him, that is, your Grace is about to ruine a Man with whose Conversation you would be pleas'd above all things.</HI> Upon this Occasi∣on they said so much of the shining Quali∣ties of Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> and of the Charms of his Conversation, that the Duke, who was as much in love with Wit, as he was with his Kinswoman, was impatient till he was brought to sup with him, which was in two or three Nights. After Supper Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> who was then in the Height of his Vigor both of Body and Mind, thought himself oblig'd to exert himself, and the Duke was charm'd to that degree, that he cry'd out in a Transport, <HI>By G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> my Cousin is in the right of it</HI>; and from that very Moment made a Friend of a Man whom he believ'd his happy Rival.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave him so∣lid sensible Proofs of his Esteem and Affe∣ction. For as he was at the same time Ma∣ster of the Horse to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and Co∣lonel of a Regiment; as Master of the Horse he made him one of his Equeries, and as Colonel of a Regiment he made him Cap∣tain Lieutenant of his own Company, re∣signing to him at the same time his own
<PB N="220" REF="236"/>
Pay as Captain, and all other Advantages that could be justly made of the Company I remember that about that time I, who was come up from the University to see my Friends in Town, happen'd to be one Night at the Fountain Tavern in the <HI>Strand,</HI> with the late Dr. <HI>Duke, David Loggen</HI> the Painter, and Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> of whom <HI>Otway</HI> has made honourable Mention in <HI>Tonson</HI>'s first Miscellany, and that after Supper we drank Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Health by the Name of Captain <HI>Wycherley.</HI></P>
<P>He was not long after this in such high Favour with the King, that that Monarch gave him a Proof of his Esteem and Affe∣ction, which never any Sovereign Prince before had given to an Author who was only a private Gentleman. Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> happen'd to fall sick of a Feaver at his Lodgings in <HI>Bow-street, Covent Garden,</HI> during which Sickness the King did him the Honour to visit him, when finding his Feaver indeed abated, but his Body ex∣tremely weaken'd, and his Spirits miser∣ably shatter'd, he commanded him, as soon as he was able to take a Journey, to go to the South of <HI>France,</HI> believing that nothing would contribute more to the restoring his former Vigour, than the gentle salutiferous Air of <HI>Montpelier</HI> during the Winter Sea∣son. At the same time the King was pleas'd to assure him, <HI>that as soon as he was ca∣pable</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
<HI>of taking that Journey, he would or∣der five hundred Pounds to be paid him to defray the Expence of it.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> accordingly went into <HI>France</HI> in the beginning of the Winter of 1678, if I am not mistaken, and returned into <HI>England</HI> in the latter end of the Spring of 1679, entirely restor'd to his former Vigor both of Body and Mind. The King re∣ceiv'd him with the utmost Marks of Fa∣vour, and shortly after his Arrival told him that he had a Son, who he was resolv'd should be educated like the Son of a King, and that he could make Choice of no Man so proper to be his Governor as Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley</HI>; that for that Service he should have fifteen hundred Pounds a Year paid him, for the Payment of which he should have an Assignment upon three several Offices, whose Names I have forgot, to which the King added, <HI>that when the Time came that his Office was to cease, he would take care to make such a Provision for him as should set him above the Malice of the World and Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Sir, is it not matter of Won∣der, that one of Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s extraordi∣nary Merit, who was esteem'd by all the most deserving Persons of the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and in high Fa∣vour with the King himself, should in a little time, after he had received these gra∣cious
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
Offers which seem to have made and to have fix'd his Fortune, be thrown into Prison for bare seven hundred Pounds, and be suffer'd to languish there during the last four Years of that Monarch's Reign; forsaken by all his Friends at Court and quite aban∣don'd by the King? 'Tis no easie matter, Sir, to find a more extraordinary Instance of the Vicissitude of Human Affairs, and if the Cause of so strange an Alteration is unknown to you, I dare promise my self that you are very desirous to hear it.</P>
<P>It was immediately after Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> had received these gracious Offers from the King, that the Water-drinking Season coming on, he went down to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> to take either the Benefit of the Waters or the Diversions of the Place, when walking one Day upon the Wells Walk with his Friend Mr. <HI>Fairbeard</HI> of <HI>Grey's-Inn,</HI> just as he came up to the Bookseller's, my Lady <HI>Drog∣heda,</HI> a young Widow, rich, noble, and beautiful, came to the Bookseller and en∣quir'd for <HI>the Plain Dealer. Madam,</HI> says Mr. <HI>Fairbeard, since you are for the</HI> Plain Dealer, <HI>there he is for you,</HI> pushing Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> towards her. <HI>Yes,</HI> says Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley, this Lady can bear plain Dealing, for she appears to be so accomplish'd, that what would be Compliment said to others, spoke to her would be plain Dealing. No, truly, Sir,</HI> said the Lady, <HI>I am not with∣out</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="239"/>
<HI>my Faults any more than the rest of my Sex, and yet notwithstanding all my Faults, I love plain Dealing, and never am more fond of it than when it tells me of my Faults. Then, Madam,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Fairbeard, you and the</HI> Plain Dealer <HI>seem design'd by Heaven for each other.</HI> In short, Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> walk'd with her upon the Walks, waited upon her home, visited her daily at her Lodgings, while she staid at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and after she went to <HI>London,</HI> at her Lodgings in <HI>Hatton Garden,</HI> where in a little time he got her Consent to marry her, which he did, by his Father's Command, without acquaint∣ing the King; for it was reasonably sup∣pos'd, that the Lady having a great Inde∣pendant Estate, and noble and powerful Re∣lations, the acquainting the King with the intended Marriage might be the likeliest way to prevent it. As soon as the News of it came to Court it was look'd upon as an Affront to the King, and a Contempt of his Majesty's Offers. And Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Conduct after his Marriage made this be resented more heinously. For seldom or never coming near the Court, he was thought downright ungrateful. But the true Cause of his Absence was not known, and the Court was at that time too much a∣larm'd, and in too much Disquiet to enquire into it. In short, Sir, the Lady was jea∣lous of him to Distraction, jealous to that
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
degree, that she could not endure that he should be one Moment out of her Sight. Their Lodgings were in <HI>Bow-street, Co∣vent-Garden,</HI> over-against the <HI>Cock,</HI> whi∣ther if he at any time went with his Friends, he was oblig'd to leave the Windows o∣pen, that the Lady might see there was no Woman in Company, or she would be im∣mediately in a downright raving Condition. Whether this outragious Jealousy proceeded from the excess of her Passion, for she lov'd her Husband with the same Violence with which she had done her Lover, or from the great Things which she had heard reported of his manly Prowess, which were not an∣swer'd by her Experience, or from them both together, Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> thought that he was oblig'd to humour it, and that he could not be too indulgent to a Lady who had bestow'd both her Person and her For∣tune on him. This, Sir, was the Cause that brought Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> all at once in∣to the utmost Disgrace with the Court, whose Favour and Affection but just before he possessed in the highest Degree. And these, Sir, are the Particulars of Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley</HI>'s Life, which seem either to have slipt from your Memory, or to have esca∣ped your Knowledge.</P>
