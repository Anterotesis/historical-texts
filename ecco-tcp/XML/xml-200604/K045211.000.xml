<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st SOLDIER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Say you are wrong, we should all speak together,
each for himself, and all at once, that we may be
heard the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right Jack, we'll argue in Platoons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, let him have our grievances in a vol∣ly,
and if we be to have a spokesman, there's the Corpo∣ral
is the Lieutenant's countryman; and knows his hu∣mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone for that, I serv'd three years wi∣thin
a bit, under his honour, in the Royal Inniskillions,
and I never will see a sweeter tempered gentleman, nor
one more free with his purse. I put a great shamrogue
in his hat this morning, and I'll be bound for him, he'll
wear it, was it as big as Steven's green.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4th Sol</SPEAKER>
<P>I say again then you talk like youngsters,
like Militia striplings, there is a discipline, look'ee, in
all things, whereof the serjeant must be our guide, he's
a gentleman of words, he understands your foreign lingo,
your figures, and such like auxiliaries in scoring.—Con∣fess
now for a reckoning, whether in chalk or writing,
ben't he your only man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the serjeant is a scholar to be sure, and
has the gift of reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good soldiers, and fellow gentlemen, if you
make me your spokesman, you will shew the more
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
judgment, and let me alone for the argument. I'll be
as loud as a drum, and point blank from the purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed, agreed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cor.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Fait here comes the Lieutenant, now Ser∣jeant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, to order.—Put on your mutiny looks,
every man grumble a little to himself, and some of you
hum the deserter's march.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Lieutenant.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well honest lads, what is it you have to com∣plain
of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ahem! hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>So please your honour, the very grievance of
the matter is this;—ever since your honour differed with
Justice Credilous, our Inkeepers use us most scurvily.—
By my halbert, their treatment is such, that if your
<HI>spirit</HI> was willing to put up with it, flesh and blood
could by no means agree, so we humbly petition, that
your honour would make an end of the matter at once,
by running away with the Justice's daughter, or else
get us fresh quarters, hem! hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—Pray which of the houses use you ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's the Red Lion ha'n't half the civility
of the old Red Lion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's the White Horse, if he was'n't case
hardened, ought to be ashamed to shew his face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, the Horse and the Lion shall an∣swer
for it, at the quarter sessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser</SPEAKER>
<P>The two Magpies are civil enough, but the An∣gel
uses us like devils, and the rising sun refuses us light
to go to bed by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then upon my word, I'll have the rising sun
put down, and the Angel shall give security for his good
behaviour, but are you sure you do nothing to quit
scores with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all your honour, unless now and
then we happen to fling a cartridge into the kitchen
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
fire, or put a spatterdash or so into the soup—and some∣times
Ned drums up and down stairs a little of a night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh all that's fair, but hark'ee lads I must have
no grumbling on St Patrick's day, so here take this
and divide it amongst you. But observe me now, show
yourselves men of spirit, and don't spend six pence of it
in drink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay hang it your honour, soldiers should never
bear malice, we must drink St Patrick's and your ho∣nour's
health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh damn malice. St Patrick's and his honour
by all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come away then lads, and first we'll parade
round the Market Cross, for the honour of King George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank your honour. Come along, St Pa∣trick's,
his honour, and strong beer for ever.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit <HI>Soldiers.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get along you thoughtless vagabonds, yet upon
my conscience, 'tis very hard these poor fellows should
scarcely have bread from the soil they would die to de∣fend.</P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Doctor Rosy.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Ah, my little Doctor Rosy, my galen a-bridge, what's
the news?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>All things are as they were, my Alexander, the
Justice is as violent as ever, I felt his pulse on the mat∣ter
again, and thinking his rage began to intermit, I
wanted to throw in the bark of good advice, but it would
not do. He says you and your cutthroats have a plot
upon his life, and swears he had rather see his daughter
in a scarlet fever, than in the arms of a soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word the army is very much obliged
to him, well then, I must marry the girl first, and ask
his consent afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, the case of her fortune is desperate, hey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>O hang fortune, let that take its chance, there
is a beauty in Lauretta's simplicity, so pure a bloom
upon her charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>So there is, so there is.—You are for beauty as
nature made her, hey! No artificial graces, no cos∣metic
varnish, no beauty in grain, hey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word Doctor, you are right, the Lon∣don
ladies were always too handsome for me;—then they
are so defended, such a circumvaluation of hoop, with
a breast work of whale bone, that would turn a pistol
bullet, much less Cupid's arrows, then turret on turret
on top, with stores of concealed weapons, under pre∣tence
of black pins, and above all, a standard of fea∣thers,
that would do honour to a knight of the Bath.
Upon my conscience I could as soon embrace an Amo∣sen
arm'd at all points.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, right my Alexander—my taste to a tit∣tle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Doctor, though I admire modesty in
women, I like to see their faces. I am for the change∣able
rose, but with one of these quality amazons, if
their midnight dissipations had left them blood enough
to raise a blush, they have not room enough in their
cheeks to show it.—To be sure, bashfulness is a very
pretty thing, but in my mind, there is nothing on
earth, so impudent as an everlasting blush.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>My taste, my taste—Well Lauretta is none of
these—Ah! I never see her, but she puts me in mind of
my poor dear wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay faith, in my opinion she can't do a worse
thing.—Now is he going to bother me about an old
hag that has been dead these six years. <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh poor Dolly! I never shall see her like again,
such an arm for a bandage—Veins that seem'd to invite
the lancet. Then her skin, smooth and white as a gal∣lipot
—her mouth as round and not larger than the
month of a penny phial. Her lips conserve of roses—
and then her teeth—none of your sturdy fixtures—ask
as they wou'd—it was but a small pull and out they
came. I believe I have drawn half a score of her poor
dear pearls, <STAGE>(weeps)</STAGE> but what avails her beauty. Death
has no consideration—one must die as well as another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! if he begins to moralize <STAGE>(takes out his snuss
box.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fair or ugly, crooked or straight, rich or poor,
flesh as grafs flowers fade!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here Doctor, take a pinch, and keep up your
spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true my friend, grief can't mend the matter
—all's for the best, but such a woman was a great loss,
Lieutenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, for doubtless she had mental ac∣complishments
equal to her beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mental accomplishments! she would have stuf∣fed
an aligator, or pickled a lizard with any Apotheca∣ry's
wife in the kingdom. Why she could decypher a
prescription, and invent the ingredients, almost as well
as myself; then she was such a hand at making foreign
waters for Setzer, Pyrmont, Islington or Chaly beate
she never had her equal—and her Bath and Bristol
springs exceeded the originals—Ah! Poor Dolly, she
fell a martyr to her own discoveries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor soul, her illness was occasioned by her zeal
in trying an improvement on the Spa water, by an in∣fusion
of rum and acid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, spirits never agree with water drink∣ers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you mistake.—Rum agreed with her
well enough, it was not the rum that killed the poor
dear creature, for she died of a dropsy. Well, she is
gone never to return, and has left no pledge of our loves
behind—No little babe, to hang like a label round pa∣pa's
neck: well, well, we are all mortal,—sooner or la∣ter
flesh is grass—flowers fade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>O the devil again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Life's a shadow, the world a stage,—we strut
an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here Doctor. <STAGE>(Offers snuff.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true my friend—well, high grief can't
cure it. All's for the best, hey! my little Alexander.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, right, an Apothecary should never be
out of spirits. But come, faith 'tis time honest Hum∣phrey
should wait on the Justice, that must be our first
scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true, you should be ready, the cloaths
are at my house, and I have given you such a character,
that he is impatient to have you; he swears you shall
be his body guard. Well I honour the army, or
I should never do so much to serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lieu.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I am bound to you for ever Doctor,
and when once I'm possessed of my dear Lauretta, I
will endeavour to make work for you as fast as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you put me in mind of my poor wife a∣gain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>I repeat it again mama, officers are the pretti∣est
men in the world, and Lieutenant O'Conner is the
prettiest officer I ever saw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bri.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame Laura, how can you talk so—or if
you must have a military man, there's Lieutenant Plow
or Captain Haycock, or Major Dray the Brewer; are
all your admirers, and though they are peaceable good
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
kind, of men they have as large cockades, and become
scarlet as well as the fighting folks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! you know mama I hate militia officers,
a set of dunghill cocks, with spurs on heroes scratch'd
off a church door. Clowns in military masquerade, wea∣ring
the dress without supporting the character. No,
give me the bold upright youth, who makes love to-day
and his head shot off to-morrow. Dear to think how
the sweet fellows sleep on the ground, and fight in silk
stockings and lace ruffles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh barbarous! to want a husband that may wed
you to-day, and be sent the Lord knows where before
night; then in a twelve month perhaps to have him
come like a Colossus with one leg at New York, and
the other at Chelsea Hospital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll be his crutch mama.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bri.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, give me a husband that knows where his
limbs are, though he want the use of them—and if he
should take you with him—to sleep in a baggage cart,
and stroll about the camp like a gipsey, with a knapsack
and two children at your back—then by way of enter∣tainment
in the evening, to make a party with the Ser∣jeants
wife, to drink bohea tea, and play at all fours on
a drumhead, 'tis a precious life to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay mama, you shou'd'nt be against my Lieu∣tenant,

the dog seem'd as ignorant as my clerk, and talk'd of
honesty as if he had been a church Warden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Po! Nonsense, honesty indeed!—What had
you to do pray with honesty:—A fine business you have
made of it with your Humphrey Hum, and Miss too,
she must have been privy to it.—Lauretta, ay, you
would have her called so, but for my part I never knew
any good come of giving girls these heathen christian
names; if you had called her Deborah, or Tabitha, or
Ruth, or Rebecca, or Joan, nothing of this had ever
happened; but I always knew Lauretta was a runaway
name.</P>
