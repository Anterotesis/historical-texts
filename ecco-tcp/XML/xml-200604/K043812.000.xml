<HEAD>A
LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are many undeni∣able
and irrefragable argu∣ments
to support my nega∣tive;
but, as <HI>Vellum</HI> says, Out of se∣veral,
I shall only mention a few.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="5"/>
I need not, in this case, beg a
question, which will readily be granted,
and therefore I shall take it for granted,
that all persons, who go to the thea∣tre,
go there for Entertainment, in
order to hear and see every thing and
every body. If I read Mr. <HI>Palmer's</HI>
name in the bill of the <HI>way of the
world</HI> for <HI>Mirabel,</HI> I go with a con∣viction
that I shall see and hear him
with entire satisfaction, and so of Mr.
<HI>King,</HI> in the part of <HI>Atall,</HI> in the <HI>Dou∣ble
Gallant</HI>; now in neither of these
plays, nor in many others does Mr.
<HI>Garrick</HI> intrude upon my entertain∣ment,
nor obstruct my satisfaction,
because he does not play in them:
But when I go to see the <HI>Suspicious
Husband,</HI> there I see Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> in
the part of <HI>Ranger</HI>; and sure no man
will deny, but that he plays that part,
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
better than any other man in the world;
But will any person be so hardy as
to tell me, I shall part with my money,
to see <HI>honest Ranger</HI> only; I want to
see <HI>Frankly</HI> and <HI>Bellamy</HI> and ratling
<HI>Jack Meggot</HI>; I would willingly see
Mr. <HI>Strictland</HI>; the character, who gives
title to the Comedy, yet am I herein
debarred, by Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s instrusion,
for when he appears on the stage, I
am so blinded, either by prejudice or
admiration, that I can see no body
else; I can hear no body else; I can
bear no body else; for instance, the
other day, I wanted to hear <HI>Jacky
Meggot</HI> invite <HI>Ranger</HI> and his friend
in the <HI>Italian</HI> taste, to his house, but
I never heard a syllable of it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Ranger</HI> is with his two friends,
<HI>Bellamy</HI> and <HI>Frankly,</HI> I hear him indeed
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>
speak of them, and I am as much sur∣pized
to find him speaking <HI>to</HI> them,
but I can never set my eyes on them,
while he is by: Before he came in,
I could see and hear them, as dis∣tinctly,
and as clearly, as visibly and
audibly as ever I saw or heard any thing
in all my life, but when he comes in,
whether it is, that he clouds my eyes,
or fills my sight, I cannot for my soul de∣termine,
but I see no more of <HI>Bellamy</HI>
and <HI>Frankly.</HI> If they <HI>are</HI> there, I
do not hear them, and though I use
my glass I cannot see them, till he goes
out again.</P>
<P>I hear him say (plain enough)
<HI>Now it is, dear boy, and honest Ranger,</HI>
and <HI>just now you would have cut my
throat</HI>; but I never heard that they said
any such words, but from his report,
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
I suspected my own hearing, nor I
would not believe my own eyes, till
I asked a gentleman who sat by me,
whether <HI>Frankly</HI> or <HI>Bellamy</HI> were on
the Stage, and he said that he could
not see any such persons.—Then,
said I, who the devil is he speaking to?—By my soul, replied the gen∣tleman,
I can't tell, for I see neither
of them, nor do I believe either of
them to be on the stage: if they are, it
is more than I can say, and I am as
uneasy as you can be to see one man
play the whole comedy by himself;
it is really too hard upon him, and I
can't find the reason why he keeps so
many people in sallary to so little pur∣pose,
and almost for doing nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="9"/>
I came here the other night, when
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> did not play, and I saw
every body, and heard every thing to
my entire satisfaction; but when this
confounded <HI>Garrick</HI> comes on the
stage, he confounds my eyes and ears
in such a manner, that I am de∣prived
of both organs, which are en∣tirely
engrossed by his appearance and
voice.</P>
<P>When my side's-man had done speak∣ing,
I asked a lady, who sat by me,
Who Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> was speaking to? She
said, She could not tell.—When he
says, <HI>any letters,</HI> or <HI>message?</HI> does he
speak to the scene? for by the lord, I
see no servant! She said, She thought
her eyes pretty good, and that she was
as blind as myself in that respect—and indeed she had the highest pair of
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
eyes that ever my eyes beheld; yet clear
as her vision was, she could see no ser∣vant,
nor any thing else, but this in∣dividual,
<HI>Garrick</HI>—He is not of so
gigantic a stature, nor do I think he
ever will exceed six feet in height; he
is not so fat as Sir <HI>John Falstaff,</HI> and
how the devil, does this manager ma∣nage
to cover every body and every
thing from our sight.—He must
deal in magic, thus to interpose between
the spectators and every body else, in such
a <HI>black art</HI> manner, as render them invi∣sible.</P>
<P>He is the reverse of a dark-lanthorn
which hides the bearer, and throws light
upon every body else; he is like the
focus of a glass, which attracts all the
rays of light; he is like a sun-dial, which
interprets time by light and shade—him∣self
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
all <HI>light,</HI> every body else all
<HI>shade.</HI></P>
<P>Now a representation may be called a
picture, but no good picture was ever
all light, and all shade, but both should
be happily compounded and mixed to
make a picture agreeable and striking.</P>
<P>I, like a fool, the other night, went
to see the <HI>Alchymist:</HI> I saw <HI>Burton</HI> and
<HI>Palmer</HI> plain enough, till <HI>Abel Drugger</HI>
came on, fiddling with his shop-keeper's
apron. He no sooner came on than
away went <HI>Subtle,</HI> and captain <HI>Face</HI>:
says I, to one near me, is not this mon∣strous,
that <HI>Subtle</HI> and <HI>Face</HI> should go off
the stage, at the time when <HI>Nab</HI> wants
them He answered, that he thought
it unaccountable, and that he was served
so once before the last season; and that
if he had recollected himself in that par∣ticular,
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>
he would not have come to see
<HI>Abel Drugger</HI> alone.</P>
<P>You know the plot, says he, is mixt,
and has a variety of persons in the drama,
but the devil a one person here, but
<HI>Abel Drugger.</HI>—You shall see him fight
a parcel of <HI>Shadows,</HI> and beat them off
presently: He is excellent at <HI>Skiomachy.</HI>
He did so, in a very short time, beating
the air, with as much dexterity, as if
there had been a dozen people on the
stage: Well, said I, to the gentleman
near me, I don't like this egotism, for as
<HI>Young</HI> the satyrist expresses it,<Q><HI>and I's</HI> the little hero of each tale.</Q></P>
<P>Another cogent reason, I shall offer to
the public, and you, sir, why Mr. <HI>Gar∣tick</HI>
should <HI>not</HI> appear on the stage is
<PB N="18" REF="13"/>
that besides blind-folding people, by his
fascination, he imposes upon our hearing,
rendering us deaf to every other person,
but himself.—This is an intolerable <HI>mono∣pily,</HI>
thus to seize upon, and captivate our
two senses.</P>
<P>I have spoken to that of sight already,
and now I shall enter upon that of
hearing.</P>
<P>We have had occular proofs sufficient
to convince all reasonable people, that is,
all people that will believe their eyes,
that Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> should not appear upon
the stage. Had he happened to be an
actor in <HI>Paris,</HI> he would long since, have
been put into the Bastile, but as he lives
under so mild a government as that of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI>; the best we can do, is to
put him under the punishment of pro∣scription,
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
or in other words to banish
him the stage, the scene of his delinquency,
nor is it indeed reasonable in the nature
of things to permit him to reign any
longer in so unlimited a tyranny, a ty∣ranny
for which some men, would long
since have been brought to the scaf∣fold.</P>
<P>I most wonder, why his own com∣pany
have not entered into a formal pro∣secution
against him, and brought their
<HI>habeas corpus,</HI> for rendering them invi∣sible
and inaudible: they permit their
names to be printed, which is a kind
of bond, or promissary note, payable to
the public, that they will enact such,
and such characters; now if Mr. <HI>Austin</HI>
or Mr. <HI>Burton,</HI> or any of the players,
engages thus in print to perform this or
that part, and does not appear, when
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
<HI>Garrick</HI> comes on, have not I my writ
of insolvency against him; what can they
plead why I should not oblige them to
appear, when Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> comes on.—Why do they go off that instant.—There's no body in the galleries, find
any fault with them; they, and every
other actor or actress in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> have
their peculiar merits in their own particu∣lar
cast. Each has his proper walk, and
shines in his own department; and the
next time I see them disappear on <HI>Gar∣rick's</HI>
entering, I shall say with the witches
in <HI>Macbeth, appear, appear.</HI> So I give
them this fair warning.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> says in <HI>Hamlet</HI>—<HI>I am too much in the Sun</HI>; he speaks an
evident truth, and if I may be allowed
the Expression, a <HI>palpable</HI> one. It is
downright demonstration.—He is
<PB N="21" REF="16"/>
<HI>too much in the sun</HI>; what he says needs
no illustration, for he is <HI>so much in the
sun,</HI> that he takes all the light to him∣self,
and like a ray of glory, or an <HI>infula</HI>
of beams, eclipses all others.</P>
<P>The moon herself, and most of the
stars, who borrow their light from the
sun, have not so much reason to com∣plain:
If they have not light of their
own, they shine in borrowed robes, but
they would take it very ill of <HI>Dan Phoe∣bus,</HI>
<HI>that wandering knight so fair,</HI> if he
should, like <HI>Garrick,</HI> get up of a frosty
night, put on his damask night-gown,
and then put them all out.—It would
be as cruel in the <HI>sun</HI> to do so, as it is
in <HI>Othello,</HI> when he <HI>puts out the light,
and then puts out the light.</HI> And I
think, with deference to the judgment
of the public, that it is as insuffera∣ble
in Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> to extinguish all
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
other lights but his own: and I hope
they will take proper cognizance, and
jointly agree to put him out by the con∣curring
votes of ostracism.</P>
<P>I will only ask the company of <HI>Drury∣lane</HI>-house,
has the manager, (as <HI>Pytha∣goras</HI>
did of old to his disciples) enjoin
them silence for any term of years. If
he has done this in his wisdom, 'tis but
reasonable, he should set them an exam∣ple.—He should, like a good father,
enforce by his <HI>precedent,</HI> what he preaches
in doctrine, and not like an incendiary, <HI>set
us all by the ears</HI>; and like the sentence
of perjury, impose the <HI>pillory</HI> upon his
audience. I must own, that I am so
great a lover of music, that I could sit
a whole hour to hear a good <HI>solo</HI>
performed by a good hand, but by the
blood of the <HI>Mirables,</HI> I do not see
why Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> should every night for
<PB N="23" REF="18"/>
these many seasons, play nothing but <HI>solos.</HI>
This is rehearsal upon rehearsal, and repeti∣tion
upon the back of repetition. Are we
never to have a concert, because truly
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> loves nothing but <HI>solos.</HI> I
think Mr. <HI>Holland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Bransby,</HI> and indeed every Mr. and
Mrs. in the house have a just title to per∣form
their particular parts in the theatri∣cal
concert.</P>
<P>They are paid for doing so; we
the public pay them, and we insist
on their playing for the future, or we
will pay them, and repay them.—Had
we found fault with their perform∣ance
at any one time, had we con∣demned
their theatrical merit, whether
natural or acquired, if we had refused
to give them, what is their undoubted
right, our just applause, they might offer
<PB N="24" REF="19"/>
some plea, for not discharging their duty,
but as matters stand, we think this time
as seasonable as well as unseasonable;
silence is insensible, and we hope to
see a reformation in due time, which yet
we think cannot well be made, except
Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> begins it by a solemn de∣parture
from the stage, since we may ap∣ply
<HI>Horace</HI>'s saying to him,<Q><L>Lusisti Satis—</L>
<L>Tempus abire tibi.</L></Q></P>
<P>We shall now state some matters
of fact, in order to support our argu∣ments.</P>
<P>One matter of fact is, that when he
played <HI>Hamlet,</HI> no body else appeared,
when he was on. Our attention was
so much engrossed by <HI>Hamlet,</HI> that
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
we took no notice of any other per∣son;
I neither saw <HI>Bernardo</HI> nor <HI>Mar∣cellus,</HI>
nor heard one syllable of either
<HI>Rosenerans</HI> or <HI>Guilderstern,</HI> while <HI>Ham∣let</HI>
was on.—When <HI>Hamlet</HI> says,
<Q>—The play's the thing.</Q>
With which I'll catch the conscience of
the thing we expected; there would
have been a play, but if there was any
such thing, I did not see it or hear
it; it might have been play'd for any
thing I know, but certain it is, it es∣caped
me. Possibly, I was gazing too
attentively on <HI>Hamlet</HI> sitting at the feet
of <HI>Ophelia,</HI> and looking at something
through her fan.—I knew that the
object of his intuition was to have been
the <HI>King,</HI> but the devil a king was there,
or if there was it, was a king of Ham∣let's
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
own making; like that, when
he says,
<Q><HI>A</HI> King of shreds and patches.</Q>As in like manner, in the <HI>Alchymist,</HI> is
it fitting, that <HI>Abel Dugger,</HI> should play
the whole play himself, and let no one
else be seen or heard, while he's on?
If monopoly in trade be an injury to
the public, then it must be confessed,
with respect to our entertainments, a
theatrical monopoly, is an unfair mono∣poly,
an embargo on our taste, a kind
of an inquisition, a very star-chamber on
our understanding; and if trade in ge∣neral
suffers by such monopolies, so is
taste in general utterly depraved by such
unjust engrossment.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="22"/>
Why should not the witches be seen
or heard, when <HI>Macbeth</HI> comes in, when
he says,
<Q><L>Ye black confederate midnight hags,</L>
<L>What are ye doing?</L></Q>
Instead of answering him, <HI>a deed, &amp;c.</HI> as
they should do, they instantly disappear,
they vanish, and are no more seen; he
bewitches the very witches, rendering
them, and all their diabolical proceed∣ings
invisible.—The cauldron is no
more, he extinguishes their infernal flames,
and plays hell with hell itself, sending
the very devil, as the sentence does the
condemned criminal, to the place from
whence he came.—And is this sufferable?
Will any man be so hardy as to say, this
is to be borne,—it is not to be borne,—
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>
I think the witches have as great a right
to answer, as <HI>Macbeth</HI> to ask a question;
at least, I think it is so in your house,
sir; and what is sauce for the goose,
should be sause for the gander, as the
saying is; now at your house, there are
no such proceedings, no such indecorum.
He does not swallow up the witches,
and devour them at a mouthful. He
does not like the famous <HI>fire-eater,</HI> feed
upon brimstone and other combustibles,
which reminds me of a story I have
somewhere read, applicable to Mr. <HI>Gar∣rick</HI>'s
thus eating up the <HI>devil</HI> without
a grain of salt: I say, applicable to him
for one very good reason, and that is, if
I do not insert it here, I shall forget to
insert it any where else.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="24"/>
A certain nobleman to divert himself,
carried a young Blackamoor just imported
to one of the Papish chapels in the
city, and when the priest was eating the
wafer, the blackamoor asked his master,
What that man was eating? Who an∣swered,
that he was eating his God.—I wish we had him in our country,
says the blackamoor, for he would eat
the devil purely.</P>
<P>This story needs no comment, and
therefore we shall make none; we hope
therefore from what we have advanced
that these irrefragable arguments will
have some weight with Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI>
and you are at liberty to shew this let∣ter
to him: if he is able to answer all,
or any one of them, to our satisfaction,
we shall subscribe a submissive acknow∣ledgment
<PB N="30" REF="25"/>
of our fault in the daily ad∣vertiser,
with the hopes of forgiveness
and promise that we shall never be
again guilty in this particular, if not, we
shall say as the King in the Mourning
bride expresses it,
<Q>Take away his face</Q>For we must acknowledge that it daz∣zles
our sight, in such a manner, that
we can see nothing else. Nor indeed is
any thing herein written, sir, in the least
to insinuate any thing to the prejudice of
your house, which we honour and re∣spect
as we should do, and we should
want taste did we say any other. Your
performers have merit enough to extort
praise from the best judges or the nicest
criticks, and perhaps one of the best
<PB N="31" REF="26"/>
low comedians in the world is in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is any thing herein written
intended to depreciate or run down the
Actors of <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> but the reverse is
the intention of this letter; for if we
were hardy enough to say, that all and
every of them has not theatrical merit in
an eminent degree, it were to give our
own judgments the lie, and the false∣hood,
like dust thrown in the wind,
would fly in our faces—it were a shal∣low
artifice, because we run down this
most <HI>unreasonable man,</HI> thereby to traduce
or lessen that good esteem, which they
have learned by their good quallities,
or because they are not seen, or heard
when Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> appears, that therefore
they are not <HI>fit to be seen, or that they
should not be.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="27"/>
The reverse of all this is meant and
intended by the whole tenour, of
which however tortured to confess, will
never be made to confess what it never
intended; I say, it is fitting they should be
seen or heard, and that in order thereto, we
have given this our safe advice to <HI>David
Garrick</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>
play-house, that he will appear no
more on the stage, which advice we
should not have given in so peremptory
a manner if he did not eclipse those
who play with him. Our advice is
candid, free, and disinterested, since
it will be allowed, that as there cannot
be two suns, neither can there be two
<HI>Garricks,</HI> since he like his own <HI>Richard,</HI>
<HI>has no brother,</HI> is <HI>like no brother.</HI><Q><PB N="33" REF="28"/>He is himself alone.</Q></P>
<P>If then no similarity appears, no cor∣responding
features are seen, upon a
comparison, that superiority of light
which, we allow him, (and which if
we did not allow him, the world would
do it for us) has raised him to an emi∣nence
above all in the theatrical walk;
and, as a witty orange-woman said to
a gentleman, who asked, Where was
his Fellow (meaning his servant) By
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, sir, not in Christendom; so we
may say of <HI>Garrick</HI>—not in the uni∣verse;
and for this one material, migh∣ty,
and substantial reason, we exclude
him from the stage, that other people
may have their turn to shine; for if we
did with him, as <HI>Juliet</HI> says of <HI>Romeo,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="29"/>
Take him, and cut him out in little
stars, and he will make the face of
heaven so fine, that all the world would
be in love with night, and pay no wor∣ship
to the garnish sun.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> would possibly glitter
every atom and particle of him; and
like a looking - glass, broke into ten
thousand shatters, each brittle shatter
would glitter, and sparkle still.</P>
<P>So that if the other actors, eminent
as they are, each in his own walk,
will condescend to allow this superi∣ority
in Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> we think they
will join with us in expelling him the
house, as an unruly member, who takes
up so much box, that he elbows off
every body else; one whose voice is
<PB N="35" REF="30"/>
so loud, that like that of <HI>Sentor</HI> the
herald, it draws ten thousand voices,
whose tongues so voluble, that he will
not even allow the very women to in∣dulge
their favourite faculty of talk∣ing.
And sure, when one man can im∣pose
silence upon so many women, a
task above the power of all the husbands
in England, or in the world, to perform,
what must we think of such a sway?
such a dispotic sovereign, arbitrary rule,
should not be vested in any subject;
and it is more than the Grand Mo∣narque,
Lewis himself would dare to
do in France, where his motto is,
Sic <HI>volo, sic Jubeo,</HI> nay, his favourites
Pompadour would not obey so unrea∣sonable
a command; and if he had
the confidence to proclaim silence in a
printed edict, or declaration of his will,
<PB N="36" REF="31"/>
he would in all human, all moral pro∣bability,
raise an army of female insur∣gents,
to rebel against his throne, and
like Sampson, pull an old house over
his ears; we are delighted with the
sweetness of the female voice, as they
are the most harmonious; and shall
Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Pritchard,</HI> Mrs.
<HI>Clive,</HI> Miss <HI>Macklin,</HI> and the other ac∣tresses,
give up a privilege they have a
right to enjoy, a perogative they have
maintained since the days of old mother
Eve, who, no doubt, enjoyed it in its
full extent; nor shall we join with
Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> or any other man, or set
of man in the kingdom, to impose
this unreasonable injunction on women,
who have given us such uncommon plea∣sure,
either in the tender or the ele∣vated
tones of their voices.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="32"/>
It would be an act more cruel than
castration to men, by which the Ita∣lians
equip their children for the opera,
and I will speak for any of the above
actresses, and promise this in their name,
that they would think such <HI>dilapidation</HI>
for procuring men, a voice would be
less cruel, than to take the voice of
women by any means; nay, I will
vouch for them all, that they would
rather be martyrs, and suffer themselves
to be <HI>stoned to death,</HI> as the Italians are
<HI>stoned for life,</HI> than to suffer the for∣feiture
of so rich a treasure, or to cede,
by what treaty soever, upon any terms
or conditions, clause or clauses, that
high and mighty female right, the use
of their tongues; and therefore we still
continue to affirm, as we have suffici∣ently
proved our assertion, by many so∣lid
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
reasons, that this unreasonable man,
<HI>David Garrick,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> should Not ap∣pear
on the stage; and we hope you
will shew him this letter; nay, we re∣quest
it of you, and his abdicating
the throne of his ancestors, and resign∣ing
his theatrical authority (we don't
mean management) will for ever oblige,</P>

<P>SOMETHING I intended to
say when I first sat down to write
this epistle, but it slipt my memory, occa∣sioned
by the zeal I entertain for exter∣pating
Garrick, and has again this mo∣ment
occured to me.</P>
<P>In the name of common-sense are
we to have nothing new at your house,
is variety never to please our ima∣gination,
<PB N="40" REF="35"/>
shall we neither have a new
play, nor a new performer, but will
you persist, and again lead us through
that beaten path we have all these ten
years walked in?</P>
<P>If we have not something new form
you within this mouth, I shall be ne∣cessitated
to give my vote, for keep∣ing
Garrick at Drury-lane.</P>
<P>Now Sir after having requested of
you something new, I would recom∣mend
to your memory some account of
Mademoiselle de Clairon, a celebrated
actress at Paris, of whom you doubtless
have heard; I mean by giving you this
account of her, that you may instruct
the novices that may offer.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="36"/>
Her first appearance is excessively en∣gaging;
she never comes in staring round
upon the company, as if she intended to
count of benefits of the house, or at
least to see, as well as be seen. Her
eyes are always, at first, intently fixed
upon the persons of the drama, and
she lifts them by degrees, with enchant∣ing
diffidence, upon the spectators. Her
first speech, or at least the first part of
it, is delivered with scarce any motion
of the arm; her hands and her tongue
never set out together; but the one pre∣pares
us for the other. She some∣times
begins with a mute, eloquent
attitude; but never goes forward all at
once with hands, eyes, head, and voice.
This observation, though it may appear
<PB N="42" REF="37"/>
of no importance should certainly be
adverted to.</P>
<P>By this simple beginning she gives
herself a power of rising in the scene.
As she proceeds, every gesture, every
look acquires new violence, till at last
transported, she fills the whole vehe∣mence
of the part, and all the idea of
the poet.</P>
<P>Her hands are not alternately stretched
out, and then drawn in again, as with
the singing women at Sadler's-wells; they
are employed with graceful variety, and
every moment please with new and un∣expected
eloquence.</P>
