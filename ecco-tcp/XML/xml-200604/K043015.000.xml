<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Preface to a Play seems generally to be
considered as a kind of Closet-prologue,
in which—if his Piece has been success∣ful—the
Author solicits that indulgence from
the Reader which he had before experienced
from the Audience: But as the scope and im∣mediate
object of a Play is to please a mixed
assembly in <HI>Representation</HI> (whose judgment
in the Theatre at least is decisive) its degree
of reputation is usually as determined as pub∣lic,
before it can be prepared for the cooler
tribunal of the Study. Thus any farther so∣licitude
on the part of the Writer becomes
unnecessary at least, if not an intrusion: and
if the Piece has been condemned in the Per∣formance,
I fear an Address to the Closet,
like an Appeal to Posterity, is constantly re∣garded
as the procrastination of a suit, from
a consciousness of the weakness of the cause.
From these considerations, the following Co∣medy
would certainly have been submitted to
the Reader, without any further introduction
than what it had in the Representation, but
that its success has probably been founded on
a circumstance which the Author is informed
has not before attended a theatrical trial, and
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
which consequently ought not to pass unno∣ticed.</P>
<P>I need scarcely add, that the circumstance
alluded to, was the withdrawing of the Piece,
to remove those imperfections in the first Re∣presentation
which were too obvious to escape
reprehension, and too numerous to admit of
a hasty correction. There are few writers, I
believe, who, even in the fullest consciousness
of error, do not wish to palliate the faults
which they acknowledge; and, however tri∣fling
the performance, to second their confession
of its deficiencies, by whatever plea seems least
disgraceful to their ability. In the present
instance, it cannot be said to amount either
to candour or modesty in me, to acknowledge
an extreme inexperience and want of judg∣ment
on matters, in which, without guidance
from practice, or spur from success, a young
man should scarcely boast of being an adept.
If it be said, that under such disadvantages no
one should attempt to write a play—I must
beg leave to dissent from the position, while
the first point of experience that I have gained
on the subject is, a knowledge of the can∣dour
and judgment with which an impar∣tial
Public distinguishes between the errors
of inexperience and incapacity, and the indul∣gence
which it shews even to a disposition to
remedy the defects of either.</P>
<P>It were unnecessary to enter into any far∣ther
extenuation of what was thought excep∣tionable
in this Play, but that it has been
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
said, that the Managers should have pre∣vented
some of the defects before its appear∣ance
to the Public—and in particular the un∣common
length of the piece as represented
the first night.—It were an ill return for the
most liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their
side, to suffer any censure to rest where none
was deserved. Hurry in writing has long
been exploded as an excuse for an Author;—
however, in the dramatic line, it may happen,
that both an Author and a Manager may wish
to fill a chasm in the entertainment of the
Public with a hastiness not altogether cul∣pable.
The season was advanced when I first
put the play into Mr. Harris's hands:—it was
at that time at least double the length of any
acting comedy.—I profited by his judgment
and experience in the curtailing of it—'till, I be∣lieve,
his feeling for the vanity of a young Au∣thor
got the better of his desire for correctness,
and he left many excrescences remaining, be∣cause
he had assisted in pruning so many more.
Hence, though I was not uninformed that the
Acts were still too long, I flatter'd myself that,
after the first trial, I might with safer judgment
proceed to remove what should appear to have
been most dissatisfactory.—Many other errors
there were, which might in part have arisen
from my being by no means conversant with
plays in general, either in reading or at the
theatre.—Yet I own that, in one respect, I did
not regret my ignorance: for as my first wish
in attempting a Play, was to avoid every ap∣pearance
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
of plagiary, I thought I should stand
a better chance of effecting this from being in
a walk which I had not frequented, and where
consequently the progress of invention was
less likely to be interrupted by starts of recol∣lection:
for on subjects on which the mind
has been much informed, invention is slow of
exerting itself.—Faded ideas float in the fancy
like half-forgotten dreams; and the imagina∣tion
in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspi∣cious
of its offspring, and doubts whether it
has created or adopted.</P>
<P>With regard to some particular passages
which on the First Night's Representation
seemed generally disliked, I confess, that if
I felt any emotion of surprise at the dis∣approbation,
it was not that they were dis∣approved
of, but that I had not before per∣ceived
that they deserved it. As some part
of the attack on the Piece was begun too early
to pass for the sentence of <HI>Judgment,</HI> which
is ever tardy in condemning, it has been sug∣gested
to me, that much of the disapproba∣tion
must have arisen from virulence of Ma∣lice,
rather than severity of Criticism: But
as I was more apprehensive of there being
just grounds to excite the latter, than conscious
of having deserved the former, I continue
not to believe that probable, which I am sure
must have been unprovoked. However, if it
was so, and I could even mark the quarter
from whence it came, it would be ungenerous
to retort; for no passion suffers more than
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
malice from disappointment. For my own
part, I see no reason why the Author of a
Play should not regard a First Night's Audi∣ence,
as a candid and judicious friend attend∣ing,
in behalf of the Public, at his last Re∣hearsal.
If he can dispense with flattery, he
is sure at least of sincerity, and even though
the annotation be rude, he may rely upon the
justness of the comment. Considered in this
light, that Audience, whose <HI>fiat</HI> is essential
to the Poet's claim, whether his object be
Fame or Profit, has surely a right to expect
some deference to its opinion, from principles
of Politeness at least, if not from Gratitude.</P>
<P>As for the little puny Critics, who scatter
their peevish strictures in private circles, and
scribble at every Author who has the emi∣nence
of being unconnected with them, as
they are usually spleen-swoln from a vain idea
of increasing their consequence, there will
always be found a petulance and illiberality in
their remarks, which should place them as far
beneath the notice of a Gentleman, as their
original dulness had sunk them from the
level of the most unsuccessful Author.</P>
<P>It is not without pleasure that I catch at
an opportunity of justifying myself from the
charge of intending any national reflection in
the character of Sir <HI>Lucius O'Trigger.</HI> If any
Gentlemen opposed the Piece from that idea,
I thank them sincerely for their opposition;
and if the condemnation of this Comedy
(however misconceived the provocation,) could
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
have added one spark to the decaying flame
of national attachment to the country sup∣posed
to be reflected on, I should have been
happy in its fate; and might with truth have
boasted, that it had done more real service in
its failure, than the successful morality of a
thousand stage-novels will ever effect.</P>
<P>It is usual, I believe, to thank the Per∣formers
in a new Play, for the exertion of
their several abilities. But where (as in this
instance) their merit has been so striking and
uncontroverted, as to call for the warmest and
truest applause from a number of judicious
Audiences, the Poet's after-praise comes like
the feeble acclamation of a child to close the
shouts of a multitude. The conduct, how∣ever,
of the Principals in a Theatre cannot be
so apparent to the Public.—I think it there∣fore
but justice to declare, that from this
Theatre (the only one I can speak of from ex∣perience,)
those Writers who wish to try the
Dramatic Line, will meet with that candour
and liberal attention, which are generally al∣lowed
to be better calculated to lead genius
into excellence, than either the precepts of
judgment, or the guidance of experience.</P>

<L>LADIES for <HI>You</HI>—I heard our Poet say—</L>

<L>' One moral's plain—cried I—without more fuss;</L>
<L>' Man's social happiness all rests on Us—</L>
<L>' Thro' all the Drama—whether d—n'd or not—</L>

<L>The <HI>surly 'Squire</HI>—at noon resolves to rule,</L>

<L>And kisses Chloe on the sparkling Brim!</L>
<L>Nay, I have heard that Statesmen—great and wise—</L>
<L>Will <HI>sometimes</HI> counsel with a Lady's eyes;</L>
<L>The servile suitors—watch her various face,</L>
<L>She smiles perferment—or she frowns disgrace,</L>
<L>Curtsies a pension here—there nods a place.</L>
<L>Nor with less awe, in scenes of humbler life,</L>

The poorest Peasant of the poorest soil,</L>
<L>The child of Poverty, and heir to Toil—</L>
<L>Early from radiant Love's impartial light,</L>
<L>Steals one small spark, to cheer his world of night:</L>
<L>Dear spark!—that oft thro' winter's chilling woes,</L>
<L>Is all the warmth his little cottage knows!</L>
<L>The wand'ring <HI>Tar</HI>—who, not for <HI>years,</HI> has press'd</L>
<L>The widow'd Partner of his <HI>day</HI> of rest—</L>
<L>On the cold deck—far from her arms remov'd—</L>
<L>Still hums the ditty which his Susan lov'd:</L>
<L>And while around the cadence rude is blown,</L>
<L>The Boatswain whistles in a softer tone.</L>
<L>The <HI>Soldier,</HI> fairly proud of wounds and toil,</L>
<L>Pants for the <HI>triumph</HI> of his Nancy's smile;</L>
<L>But ere the battle should he list' her cries,</L>
<L>The Lover trembles—and the Hero dies!</L>
<L>That heart, by war and honour steel'd to fear,</L>
<L>Droops on a sigh, and sickens at a tear!</L>
<L>But Ye more cautious—ye nice judging few,</L>
<L>Who give to Beauty only Beauty's due,</L>
<L>Tho' friends to Love—<HI>Ye</HI> view with deep regret</L>
<L>Our conquests marr'd—our triumphs incomplete,</L>

<P>Pretty well, Thomas, pretty well—'tis a

how 'twould go next:—Odd rabbit it! when the
fashion had got foot on the Bar, I guess'd 'twould
mount to the Box!—but 'tis all out of character,

mine—the lawyers and doctors may do as they

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Julia.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest Julia, how delighted am I!—
(<HI>Embrace</HI>) How unexpected was this happiness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Lydia—and our pleasure is the
greater;—but what has been the matter?—you
were denied to me at first!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Julia, I have a thousand things to
tell you!—but first inform me, what has conjur'd
you to Bath?—Is Sir Anthony here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is—we are arrived within this hour—
and I suppose he will be here to wait on Mrs. Ma∣laprop
as soon as he is dress'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then before we are interrupted, let me
impart to you some of my distress!—I know your
gentle nature will sympathize with me, tho' your
prudence may condemn me!—My letters have
inform'd you of my whole connexion with Beverley;
—but I have lost him, Julia!—my aunt has dis∣cover'd
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
our intercourse by a note she intercepted,
and has confin'd me ever since!—Yet, would
you believe it? she has fallen absolutely in love
with a tall Irish baronet she met one night since
we have been here, at Lady Macshuffle's rout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>You jest, Lydia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, upon my word.—She absolutely car∣ries
on a kind of correspondence with him, under
a feigned name though, till she chuses to be
known to him;—but it is a <HI>Delia</HI> or a <HI>Celia,</HI> I
assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, surely, she is now more indulgent to
her niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary. Since she has dis∣covered
her own frailty, she is become more sus∣picious
of mine. Then I must inform you of
another plague!—That odious Acres is to be in
Bath to-day; so that I protest I shall be teased out
of all spirits!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Lydia, hope the best.—Sir
Anthony shall use his interest with Mrs. Malaprop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have not heard the worst. Un∣fortunately
I had quarrell'd with my poor Beverley,
just before my aunt made the discovery, and I have
not seen him since, to make it up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was his offence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all!—But, I don't know how it
was, as often as we had been together, we had never
had a quarrel!—And, somehow I was afraid he would
never give me an opportunity.—So, last Thursday,
I wrote a letter to myself, to inform myself that
Beverley was at that time paying his addresses to
another woman.—I sign'd it <HI>your Friend unknown,</HI>
shew'd it to Beverley, charg'd him with his false∣hood,
put myself in a violent passion, and vow'd
I'd never see him more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you let him depart so, and have not
seen him since?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas the next day my aunt found the
matter out. I intended only to have teased him
three days and a half, and now I've lost him for
ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he is as deserving and sincere as you have
represent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him to me, he will never give you up
so. Yet consider, Lydia, you tell me he is but an
ensign, and you have thirty thousand pounds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know I lose most of my fortune,
if I marry without my aunt's consent, till of age;
and that is what I have determin'd to do, ever
since I knew the penalty.—Nor could I love the
man, who would wish to wait a day for the alter∣native.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, this is caprice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, does Julia tax me with caprice?—
I thought her lover Faulkland had enured her to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not love even <HI>his</HI> faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a-propos—you have sent to him, I
suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet, upon my word—nor has he the
least idea of my being in Bath.—Sir Anthony's re∣solution
was so sudden, I could not inform him
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Julia, you are your own mistress,
(though under the protection of Sir Anthony) yet
have you, for this long year, been the slave to the
caprice, the whim, the jealousy of this ungrateful
Faulkland, who will ever delay assuming the right
of a husband, while you suffer him to be equally
imperious as a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you are wrong entirely.—We were
contracted before my father's death.—<HI>That,</HI> and
some consequent embarrassments, have delay'd what
I know to be my Faulkland's most ardent wish.—
He is too generous to trifle on such a point.—
And for his character, you wrong him there too.—
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
No, Lydia, he is too proud, too noble to be jea∣lous;
if he is captious, 'tis without dissembling;
if fretful, without rudeness.—Unus'd to the sop∣pery
of love, he is negligent of the little duties
expected from a lover—but being unhackney'd in
the passion, his love is ardent and sincere; and as
it engrosses his whole soul, he expects every thought
and emotion of his mistress to move in unison with
his.—Yet, though his pride calls for this full return
—his humility makes him undervalue those qualities
in him, which should entitle him to it; and not
feeling why he should be lov'd to the degree he
wishes, he still suspects that he is not lov'd enough:
—This temper, I must own, has cost me many un∣happy
hours; but I have learn'd to think myself
his debtor, for those imperfections which arise from
the ardour of his love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I cannot blame you for defending
him.—But tell me candidly, Julia, had he never
sav'd your life, do you think you should have been
attach'd to him as you are?—Believe me, the rude
blast that overset your boat was a prosperous gale
of love to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gratitude may have strengthened my at∣tachment
to Mr. Faulkland, but I lov'd him be∣fore
he had preserv'd me; yet surely that alone
were an obligation sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obligation!—Why a water-spaniel would
have done as much.—Well, I should never think
of giving my heart to a man because he could
swim!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Lydia, you are too inconsiderate.</P>

<P>You thought, Miss!—I don't know

this fellow—to illiterate him, I say, quite from

I thought it my duty so to do; and let
me tell you, Lydia, these violent memories don't
become a young woman.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now don't attempt to extirpate your∣self

<P>What business have you, Miss, with

<P>It is not to be wonder'd at, Ma'am—
all this is the natural consequence of teaching girls

I'd as soon have them taught the black-art

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, Sir Anthony, you are an
absolute misanthropy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my way hither, Mrs. Malaprop, I
observed your niece's maid coming forth from a
circulating library!—She had a book in each hand
—they were half-bound volumes, with marbled
covers!—From that moment I guess'd how full of
duty I should see her mistress!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those are vile places, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, a circulating library in a
town is, as an ever-green tree, of diabolical know∣ledge!—It
blossoms through the year!—And de∣pend
on it, Mrs. Malaprop, that they who are so
fond of handling the leaves, will long for the fruit
at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Sir Anthony, your wife,
Lady Absolute, was fond of books.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye—and injury sufficient they were
to her, Madam.—But were I to chuse another help∣mate,
the extent of her erudition should consist
in her knowing her simple letters, without their
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
mischievous combinations;—and the summit of
her science be—her ability to count as far as
twenty.—The first, Mrs. Malaprop, would enable
her to work <HI>A. A.</HI> upon my linen;—and the latter
would be quite sufficient to prevent her giving me
a shirt, No. 1. and a stock, No. 2.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, fie, Sir Anthony, you surely speak
laconically!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mrs. Malaprop, in moderation,
now, what would you have a woman know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe me, Sir Anthony.—I would
by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a pro∣geny
of learning; I don't think so much learning
becomes a young woman; for instance—I would
never let her meddle with Greek, or Hebrew, or Al∣gebra,
or Simony, or Fluxions, or Paradoxes, or such
inflammatory branches of learning—neither would
it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathe∣matical,
astronomical, diabolical instruments;—
But, Sir Anthony, I would send her, at nine years
old, to a boarding-school, in order to learn a little
ingenuity and artifice.—Then, Sir, she should
have a supercilious knowledge in accounts;—and
as she grew up, I would have her instructed in
geometry, that she might know something of the
contagious countries;—but above all, Sir Antho∣ny,
she should be mistress of orthodoxy, that she
might not mis-spell, and mis-pronounce words so
shamefully as girls usually do; and likewise that
she might reprehend the true meaning of what she
is saying.—This, Sir Anthony, is what I would
have a woman know;—and I don't think there is
a superstitious article in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Mrs. Malaprop, I will
dispute the point no further with you; though I
must confess, that you are a truly moderate and po∣lite
arguer, for almost every third word you say is
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
on my side of the question.—But, Mrs. Malaprop,
to the more important point in debate,—you say,
you have no objection to my proposal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, I assure you.—I am under no
positive engagement with Mr. Acres, and as Lydia
is so obstinate against him, perhaps your son may
have better success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, I will write for the
boy directly.—He knows not a syllable of this yet,
though I have for some time had the proposal in
my head. He is at present with his regiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have never seen your son, Sir
Anthony; but I hope no objection on his side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Objection!—let him object if he dare!
—No, no, Mrs. Malaprop, Jack knows that the
least demur puts me in a frenzy directly.—My
process was always very simple—in their younger
days, 'twas 'Jack, do this;'—if he demur'd—I
knock'd him down—and if he grumbled at that—
I always sent him out of the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and the properest way, o' my
conscience!—nothing is so conciliating to young
people as severity.—Well, Sir Anthony, I shall
give Mr. Acres his discharge, and prepare Lydia
to receive your son's invocations;—and I hope
you will represent <HI>her</HI> to the Captain as an object
not altogether illegible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I will handle the subject pru∣dently.—Well,
I must leave you—and let me beg
you, Mrs. Malaprop, to enforce this matter roundly
to the girl;—take my advice—keep a tight hand
—if she rejects this proposal—clap her under lock
and key:—and if you were just to let the servants
forget to bring her dinner for three or four days,
you can't conceive how she'd come about!</P>

Lucy can't have betray'd me!—No, the

lately—</P>

<P>For <HI>abetting Miss Lydia Languish in a design of run∣ning

&amp;c. &amp;c.—<HI>numberless!—From the said Ensign, within
this last month, six guineas and a half.</HI>—About a quar∣ter's
pay!—Item, <HI>from Mrs. Malaprop, for betraying
the young people to her</HI>—when I found matters were
likely to be discovered—<HI>two guineas, and a black pa∣duasoy.</HI>—Item,
<HI>from Mr. Acres, for carrying divers

three crowns—two gold pocket-pieces—and a silver snuff∣box!</HI>—Well
done, <HI>simplicity!</HI>—yet I was forced
to make my Hibernian believe, that he was corre∣sponding,
not with the <HI>Aunt,</HI> but with the <HI>Niece:</HI>

much pride and delicacy to sacrifice the feelings
of a gentleman to the necessities of his fortune.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, while I was there, Sir Anthony came
in: I told him, you had sent me to in∣quire
after his health, and to know if he was at
leisure to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what did he say, on hearing I was at
Bath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, in my life I never saw an elderly gen∣tleman
more astonished! He started back two or
three paces, rapt out a dozen interjectoral oaths,
and asked, what the devil had brought you here!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and what did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I lied, Sir—I forgot the precise lie, but
you may depend on't; he got no truth from me.
Yet, with submission, for fear of blunders in fu∣ture,
I should be glad to fix what <HI>has</HI> brought us to
Bath: in order that we may lie a little consistently.
—Sir Anthony's servants were curious, Sir, very
curious indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have said nothing to them—?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, not a word, Sir—not a word.—Mr.
Thomas, indeed, the coachman (whom I take to
be the discreetest of whips)—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>S'death!—you rascal! you have not trusted
him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, <HI>no,</HI> Sir—no—no—not a syllable, upon
my veracity!—He was, indeed, a little inquisitive;
but I was fly, Sir—devilish fly!—My Master (said
I) honest Thomas (you know, Sir, one says <HI>honest</HI>
to one's inferiors) is come to Bath to <HI>recruit</HI>—Yes,
Sir—I said, <HI>to recruit</HI>—and whether for men, mo∣ney,
or constitution, you know, Sir, is nothing to
him, nor any one else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—<HI>recruit</HI> will do—let it be so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, recruit will do surprisingly—indeed,
to give the thing an air, I told Thomas, that your
Honour had already inlisted, five disbanded chair∣men,
seven minority waiters, and thirteen billiard
markers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>You blockhead, never say more than is
necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, Sir—I beg pardon—But
with submission, a lie is nothing unless one sup∣ports
it.—Sir, whenever I draw on my invention
for a good current lie, I always forge <HI>indorsements,</HI>
as well as the bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, take care you don't hurt your cre∣dit,
by offering too much security.—Is Mr. Faulk∣land
returned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is above, Sir, changing his dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you tell whether he has been informed
of Sir Anthony's and Miss Melville's arrival?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy not, Sir; he has seen no one since
he came in, but his gentleman, who was with him
at Bristol.—I think, Sir, I hear Mr. Faulkland
coming down—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, tell him, I am here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir—(<HI>going</HI>) I beg pardon, Sir, but
should Sir Anthony call, you will do me the fa∣vour
to remember, that we are <HI>recruiting,</HI> if you
please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>Fag.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in tenderness to my character, if your
Honour could bring in the chairman and waiters,
I shall esteem it as an obligation;—for though I
never scruple a lie to serve my Master, yet it <HI>hurts</HI>
one's conscience, to be found out.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now for my whimsical friend—if he does
not know that his mistress is here, I'll tease him a
little before I tell him—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Faulkland.</STAGE>
<P>Faulkland, you're welcome to Bath again; you
are punctual in your return.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I had nothing to detain me, when
I had finished the business I went on. Well, what
news since I left you? How stand matters between
you and Lydia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, much as they were; I have not seen
her since our quarrel, however I expect to be re∣called
every hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't you persuade her to go off
with you at once?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and lose two thirds of her fortune?
You forget that my friend.—No, no, I could have
brought her to that long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, you trifle too long—if you
are sure of <HI>her,</HI> propose to the aunt <HI>in your own
character,</HI> and write to Sir Anthony for his con∣sent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, softly, for though I am convinced
my little Lydia would elope with me as Ensign
Beverley, yet am I by no means certain that she
would take me with the impediment of our friend's
consent, a regular humdrum wedding, and the re∣version
of a good fortune on my side; no, no, I
must prepare her gradually for the discovery, and
make myself necessary to her, before I risk it.—
Well, but Faulkland, you'll dine with us to-day at
the Hotel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I cannot: I am not in spirits to
be of such a party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heavens! I shall forswear your com∣pany.
You are the most teasing, captious, incor∣rigible
lover!—Do love like a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I am unfit for company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am not <HI>I</HI> a lover; aye, and a romantic
one too? Yet do I carry every where with me such
a confounded farago of doubts, fears, hopes, wishes,
and all the flimsy furniture of a country Miss's brain!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Jack, your heart and soul are not,
like mine, fixed immutably on one only object.—
You throw for a large stake, but losing—you
could stake, and throw again:—but I have set my
sum of happiness on this cast, and not to succeed,
were to be stript of all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for Heaven's sake! what grounds for
apprehension can your whimsical brain conjure up
at present? Has Julia miss'd writing this last post?
or was her last too tender, or too cool; or too
grave, or too gay; or—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, her love—her honour—her pru∣dence,
you cannot doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! upon my soul, I never have;—but
what grounds for apprehension did you say?
Heavens! are there not a thousand! I fear for
her spirits—her health—her life.—My absence may
fret her; her anxiety for my return, her fears for
me, may oppress her gentle temper. And for her
health—does not every hour bring me cause to be
alarmed? If it rains, some shower may even then
have chilled her delicate frame!—If the wind be
keen, some rude blast may have affected her!
The heat of noon, the dews of the evening, may
endanger the life of her, for whom only I value
mine. O! Jack, when delicate and feeling souls
are separated, there is not a feature in the sky, not
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
a movement of the elements; not an aspiration of
the breeze, but hints some cause for a lover's ap∣prehension!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but we may choose whether we will
take the hint or no.—Well then, Faulkland, if you
were convinced that Julia was well and in spirits,
you would be entirely content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be happy beyond measure—
I'm anxious only for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to cure your anxiety at once—Miss
Melville is in perfect health, and is at this moment
in Bath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay Jack—don't trifle with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is arrived here with my father within
this hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you be serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you knew Sir Anthony better
than to be surprised at a sudden whim of this kind.
—Seriously then, it is as I tell you—upon my
honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Falk.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend!—Hollo, Du-Peigne!
my hat—my dear Jack—<HI>now nothing on earth can
give me a moment's uneasiness.</HI></P>

<P>What, is he much acquainted in the fa∣mily?</P>

<P>O, very intimate: I insist on your not
going: besides, his character will divert you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I should like to ask him a few
questions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Hah! my dear friend, noble captain, and
honest Jack, how do'st thou? just arrived faith, as

travelled like a Comet, with a tail of dust all the
way as long as the Mall.</P>

<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Bob, you are indeed an excentric
Planet, but we know your attraction hither—give

Faulkland, Mr. Acres.</P>

<P>Aye, Bob, Miss Melville's Mr. Faulkland.</P>

<SP>

<P>Od'so! she and your father can be but
just arrived before me—I suppose you have seen
them.—Ah! Mr. Faulkland, you are indeed a
happy man.</P>

<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen Miss Melville yet, Sir—
I hope she enjoyed full health and spirits in Devon∣shire.</P>

<P>Never knew her better in my life, Sir,—
never better.—Odd's Blushes and Blooms! she
has been as healthy as the German Spa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—I did hear that she had been a
little indisposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>False, false, Sir—only said to vex you:
quite the reverse I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Jack, you see she has the advan∣tage
of me; I had almost fretted myself ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now are you angry with your mistress for
not having been sick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you misunderstand me:—yet
surely a little trifling indisposition is not an unna∣tural
consequence of absence from those we love.
—Now confess—isn't there something unkind in
this violent, robust, unfeeling health?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, it was very unkind of her to be well in
your absence to be sure!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good apartments, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, but you were saying that Miss
Melville has been so <HI>exceedingly</HI> well—what then
she has been merry and gay I suppose?—Always
in spirits—hey?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merry, Odds Crickets! she has been
the bell and spirit of the company wherever she
has been—so lively and entertaining! so full of
wit and humour!</P>

<P>There, Jack, there.—O, by my soul!
there is an innate levity in woman, that nothing
can overcome.—What! happy and I away!</P>

<P>Have done: how foolish this is! just now
you were only apprehensive for your mistress's

<P>Fool! fool that I am! to fix all my hap∣piness

<P>Nay, nay, nay—I am not sorry that she

not!</P>

<P>Hell and the devil! There! there!—I

She has been all Health! Spirit! Laugh! Song!
Dance!—Oh! d—n'd, d—n'd levity!</P>

then?—does not the ceremony of society often
oblige—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I'll contain myself—perhaps,

you were praising Miss Melville's manner of danc∣ing
a <HI>minuet</HI>—hey?</P>

<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now disappointment on her!—defend
this, Absolute, why don't you defend this?—
Country-dances! jiggs, and reels! am I to blame
now? A Minuet I could have forgiven—I should
not have minded that—I say I should not have re∣garded
a Minuet—but <HI>Country-dances!</HI> Z—ds!
had she made one in a <HI>Cotillon</HI>—I believe I could
have forgiven even that—but to be monkey-led
for a night!—to run the gauntlet thro' a string
of amorous palming puppies!—to shew paces
like a managed filly!—O Jack, there never can be
but <HI>one</HI> man in the world, whom a truly modest

<P>Ha! ha! you've taken notice of it—'tis
genteel, isn't?—I didn't invent it myself though;
but a commander in our militia—a great scholar, I

common oaths, and that nothing but their antiquity
makes them respectable;—because, he says, the
ancients would never stick to an oath or two, but
would say By Jove! or by Bacchus! or by Mars! or
by Venus! or by Pallas! according to the sentiment
—so that to swear with propriety, says my little
Major, the 'oath should be an echo to the sense;'
and this we call the <HI>oath referential,</HI> or <HI>sentimental
swearing</HI>—ha! ha! ha! 'tis genteel, isn't it?</P>

<SP>
<P>'TIS just as Fag told me, indeed.—Whim∣sical
enough, faith! My Father wants to
<HI>force</HI> me to marry the very girl I am plotting to
run away with!—He must not know of my
connection with her yet a-while.—He has too
summary a method of proceeding in these matters
—and Lydia shall not yet lose her hopes of an
elopement.—However, I'll read my recantation
instantly.—My conversion is something sudden,
indeed—but I can assure him it is very <HI>sincere.</HI>—
So, so—here he comes.—He looks plaguy gruff.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Steps aside.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter Sir <HI>Anthony.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<P>No—I'll die sooner than forgive him.—<HI>Die,</HI> did
I say? I'll live these fifty years to plague him.—
At our last meeting, his impudence had almost put
me out of temper.—An obstinate, passionate, self∣willed
boy!—Who can he take after? This is
my return for getting him before all his brothers and
sisters!—for putting him, at twelve years old, into a
marching regiment, and allowing him fifty pounds
a-year, beside his pay ever since!—But I have
done with him;—he's any body's son for me.—
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
I never will see him more,—never—never—never
—never.</P>

<P>Fellow, get out of my way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you see a penitent before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see an impudent scoundrel before
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sincere penitent.—I am come, Sir, to
acknowledge my error, and to submit entirely to
your will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been revolving, and reflecting, and
considering on your past goodness, and kindness,
and condescension to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been likewise weighing and balanc∣ing
what you were pleased to mention concerning
duty, and obedience, and authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Puppy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, the result of my reflections
is—a resolution to sacrifice every inclination of my
own to your satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now, you talk sense—absolute
sense—I never heard any thing more sensible in my
life.—Confound you; you shall be <HI>Jack</HI> again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy in the appellation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, Jack, my dear Jack, I
will now inform you—who the lady really is.—
Nothing but your passion and violence, you silly
fellow, prevented my telling you at first. Prepare,
Jack, for wonder and rapture—prepare.—What
think you of Miss Lydia Languish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Languish! What, the Languishes of Wor∣cestershire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worcestershire! No. Did you never
meet Mrs. Malaprop and her Niece, Miss Languish,
who came into our country just before you were
last ordered to your regiment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="55"/>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Malaprop! Languish! I don't remember
ever to have heard the names before. Yet, stay—
I think I do recollect something.—<HI>Languish!
Languish!</HI> She squints, don't she?—A little,
red-haired girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Squints?—A red-haired girl!—
Z—ds, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must have forgot; it can't be the
same person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jack! Jack! what think you of bloom∣ing,
love-breathing seventeen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, Sir, I am quite indifferent.—
If I can please you in the matter, 'tis all I desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Jack, such eyes! such eyes!
so innocently wild! so bashfully irresolute! Not a
glance but speaks and kindles some thought of
love! Then, Jack, her cheeks! her cheeks, Jack!
so deeply blushing at the insinuations of her tell∣tale
eyes! Then, Jack, her lips!—O Jack, lips
smiling at their own discretion; and if not smiling,
more sweetly pouting; more lovely in sullenness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's she indeed.—Well done, old gentle∣man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Jack, her neck.—O Jack!
Jack!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And which is to be mine, Sir, the Niece
or the Aunt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you unfeeling, insensible Puppy,
I despise you. When I was of your age, such a
description would have made me fly like a rocket!
The <HI>Aunt,</HI> indeed!—Odds life! when I ran away
with your mother, I would not have touched any
thing old or ugly to gain an empire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to please your father, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>To please my father!—Z—ds!
not to please—O my father!—Oddso!—
yes—yes! if my father indeed had desired—
<PB N="40" REF="56"/>
that's quite another matter.—Tho' he wa'n't the
indulgent father that I am, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say not, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Jack, you are not sorry to find
your mistress is so beautiful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I repeat it; if I please you in this
affair, 'tis all I desire. Not that I think a woman
the worse for being handsome; but, Sir, if you
please to recollect, you before hinted something
about a hump or two, one eye, and a few more
graces of that kind—now, without being very nice,
I own I should rather chuse a wife of mine to have
the usual number of limbs, and a limited quantity
of back: and tho' <HI>one</HI> eye may be very agreeable,
yet as the prejudice has always run in favour of
<HI>two,</HI> I would not wish to affect a singularity in
that article.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a phlegmatic sot it is! Why,
sirrah, you're an anchorite!—a vile insensible
stock.—You a soldier!—you're a walking block,
fit only to dust the company's regiment on!—
Odds life! I've a great mind to marry the girl
myself!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am entirely at your disposal, Sir; if you
should think of addressing Miss Anguish yourself,
I suppose you would have me marry the <HI>Aunt;</HI> or
if you should change you're mind, and take the
old lady—'tis the same to me—I'll marry the
<HI>Niece.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Jack, thou'rt either
a very great hypocritie, or—but, come, I
know your indifference on such a subject must be
all a lie—I'm sure it must—come, now—d—n
your demure face!—come, confess, Jack—you
have been lying—ha'n't you? You have been ly∣ing,
hey? I'll never forgive you, if you ha'n't:—
so now, own, my dear Jack, you have been playing
<PB N="41" REF="57"/>
the hypocrite, hey!—I'll never forgive you, if you
ha'n't been lying and playing the hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry, Sir, that the respect and duty
which I bear to you should be so mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang your respect and duty! But,
come along with me, I'll write a note to Mrs.
Malaprop, and you shall visit the lady directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where does she lodge, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a dull question!—only on the
Grove here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! then I can call on her in my way to
the coffee-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your way to the coffee-house!
You'll set your heart down in your way to the
coffee-house, hey? Ah! you leaden-nerv'd, wood∣en-hearted
dolt! But come along, you shall see
her directly; her eyes shall be the Promethian
torch to you—come along, I'll never forgive you,
if you don't come back, stark made with rapture
and impatience—if you don't, egad, I'll marry the
girl myself!</P>

<STAGE>Faulkland, <HI>solus.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>They told me Julia would return directly;
wonder she is not yet come!—How mean does
this captious, unsatisfied temper of mine appear to
my cooler judgment! Yet I know not that I in∣dulge
it in any other point:—but on this one sub∣ject,
and to this one object, whom I think I love
beyond my life, I am ever ungenerously fretful, and
madly capricious!—I am conscious of it—yet I
cannot correct myself! What tender, honest joy
sparkled in her eyes when we met!—How delicate
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
was the warmth of her expressions!—I was
ashamed to appear less happy—though I had come
resolved to wear a face of coolness and upbraiding.
Sir Anthony's presence prevented my proposed
expostulations:—yet I must be satisfied that she
has not been so <HI>very</HI> happy in my absence.—She is
coming!—Yes!—I know the nimbleness of her
tread, when she thinks her impatient Faulkland
counts the moments of her stay.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Julia.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had not hop'd to see you again so soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I, Julia, be contented with my
first welcome—restrained as we were by the pre∣sence
of a third person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Faulkland, when your kindness can
make me thus happy, let me not think that I dis∣covered
more coolness in your first salutation than
my long-hoarded joy could have presaged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas but your fancy, Julia.—I <HI>was</HI> re∣joiced
to see you—to see you in such health—Sure
I had no cause for coldness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, I see you have taken something
ill.—You must not conceal from me what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then—shall I own to you—but
you will despise me, Julia—nay, I despise myself
for it.—Yet I <HI>will</HI> own, that my joy at hearing
of your health and arrival here, by your neigh∣bour
Acres, was something damped, by his dwell∣ing
much on the high spirits you had enjoyed in
Devonshire—on your mirth—your singing—dan∣cing,
and I know not what!—For such is my
temper, Julia, that I should regard every mirthful
moment in your absence as a treason to constancy:
—The mutual tear that steals down the cheek of
parting lovers is a compact, that no smile shall live
there till they meet again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must I never cease to tax my Faulkland
with this teasing minute caprice?—Can the idle
reports of a silly boor weigh in your breast against
my tried affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have no weight with me, Julia:
no, no—I am happy if you have been so—yet
only say, that you did not sing with <HI>mirth</HI>—say
that you <HI>thought</HI> of Faulkland in the dance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never can be happy, in your absence.—
If I wear a countenance of content, it is to shew
that my mind holds no doubt of my Faulkland's
truth.—If I seem'd sad—it were to make malice
triumph; and say, that I had fixed my heart on
one, who left me to lament his roving, and my
own credulity.—Believe me, Faulkland, I mean
not to upbraid you, when I say, that I have often
dressed sorrow in smiles, lest my friends should
guess whose unkindness had caused my tears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were ever all goodness to me.—O,
I am a brute, when I but admit a doubt of your
true constancy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>If ever, without such cause from you, as I
will not suppose possible, you find my affections
veering but a point, may I become a proverbial
scoff for levity, and base ingratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Julia, that <HI>last</HI> word is grating to
me. I would I had no title to your <HI>gratitude!</HI>
Search your heart, Julia; perhaps what you have
mistaken for Love, is but the warm effusion of a
too thankful heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what quality must I love you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>For no quality! To regard me for any
quality of mind or understanding, were only to
<HI>esteem</HI> me. And for person—I have often wish'd
myself deformed, to be convinced that I owed no
obligation <HI>there</HI> for any part of your affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where Nature has bestowed a shew of nice
attention in the features of a man, he should laugh
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
at it, as misplaced. I have seen men, who in <HI>this</HI>
vain article perhaps might rank above you; but
my heart has never asked my eyes if it were so or
not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now this is not well from <HI>you,</HI> Julia—I
despise person in a man—Yet if you lov'd me as
I wish, though I were an Aethiop, you'd think
none so fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are determined to be unkind.—
The <HI>contract</HI> which my poor father bound us in
gives you more than a lover's privilege.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, Julia, you raise ideas that feed
and justify my doubts.—I would not have been
more free—no—I am proud of my restraint.—
Yet—yet—perhaps your high respect alone for
this solemn compact has fettered your inclinations,
which else had made worthier choice.—How shall
I be sure, had you remained unbound in thought
and promise, that I should still have been the ob∣ject
of your persevering love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then try me now.—Let us be free as
strangers as to what is past:—<HI>my</HI> heart will not
feel more liberty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now! so hasty, Julia! so anxious
to be free!—If your love for me were fixed and
ardent, you would not loose your hold, even tho'
I wish'd it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you torture me to the heart!—I cannot
bear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to distress you.—If I lov'd
you less, I should never give you an uneasy mo∣ment.—But
hear me.—All my fretful doubts arise
from this—Women are not used to weigh, and
separate the motives of their affections:—the cold
dictates of prudence, gratitude, or filial duty, may
sometimes be mistaken for the pleadings of the
heart.—I would not boast—yet let me say, that
I have neither age, person, or character, to found
<PB N="45" REF="61"/>
dislike on;—my fortune such as few ladies could
be charged with <HI>indiscretion</HI> in the match.—O Ju∣lia!
when <HI>Love</HI> receives such countenance from
<HI>Prudence,</HI> nice minds will be suspicious of its
<HI>birth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not whither your insinuations would
tend:—as they seem pressing to insult me—I will
spare you the regret of having done so.—I have
given you no cause for this!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit in Tears.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Tears! stay, Julia: stay but for a
moment.—The door is fastened!—Julia!—
my soul—but for one moment:—I hear her sob∣bing!—'Sdeath!
what a brute am I to use her thus!
Yet stay.—Aye—she is coming now:—how little
resolution there is in woman!—how a few soft
words can turn them!—No, faith!—she is
<HI>not</HI> coming either.—Why, Julia—my love—
say but that you forgive me—come but to tell me
that—now, this is being <HI>too</HI> resentful:—stay! she
<HI>is</HI> coming too—I thought she would—no <HI>steadiness</HI>
in any thing! her going away must have been a
mere trick then—she sha'n't see that I was hurt by
it.—I'll affect indifference—(<HI>hums a tune: then
listens</HI>)—No—Z—ds! she's <HI>not</HI> coming!—
nor don't intend it, I suppose.—This is not <HI>steadi∣ness,</HI>
but <HI>obstinacy!</HI> Yet I deserve it.—What, after
so long an absence, to quarrel with her tenderness!
—'twas barbarous and unmanly!—I should be
ashamed to see her now.—I'll wait till her just re∣sentment
is abated—and when I distress her so
again, may I lose her for ever! and be linked in∣stead
to some antique virago, whose knawing pas∣sions,
and long-hoarded spleen, shall make me curse
my folly half the day, and all the night!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Permit me to say, Madam, that as I never
yet have had the pleasure of seeing Miss Lan∣guish,
my principal inducement in this affair at
present, is the honour of being allied to Mrs. Ma∣laprop;
of whose intellectual accomplishments,
elegant manners, and unaffected learning, no
tongue is silent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you do me infinite honour!—
I beg, Captain, you'll be seated.—(<HI>Sit</HI>)—Ah! few
gentlemen, now a days, know how to value the
ineffectual qualities in a woman! few think how a
little knowledge become a gentlewoman! Men
have no sense now but for the worthless flower,
beauty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but too true indeed, Ma'am;—yet I
fear our ladies should share the blame—they think
our admiration of <HI>beauty</HI> so great, that <HI>knowledge</HI>
in <HI>them</HI> would be superfluous. Thus, like garden∣trees,
they seldom shew fruits, till time has robb'd
them of the more specious blossom.—Few, like
Mrs. Malaprop and the Orange-tree, are rich in
both at once!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—you overpower me with good∣breeding.—He
is the very Pine-apple of politeness!
You are not ignorant, Captain, that this giddy
girl has somehow contrived to fix her affections
on a beggarly, strolling, eve's-dropping Ensign,
<PB N="47" REF="63"/>
whom none of us have seen, and nobody knows
any thing of.</P>

<P>You are very good, and very consi∣derate,

long ago I laid my positive conjunction on her

nothing can be more dreadful than to be obliged
to listen to the loathsome addresses of a stranger to

am, who have appealed in behalf of their favoured
lover to the generosity of his rival: suppose I
were to try it—there stands the hated rival—an

action there.—Proud of calamity, we will enjoy the
wreck of wealth; while the surrounding gloom of
adversity shall make the flame of our pure love
show doubly bright.—By Heav'ns! I would fling
all goods of fortune from me with a prodigal
hand to enjoy the scene where I might clasp my

<P>Pray, my friend, what has brought you

<P>Faith! I have followed Cupid's Jack-a-Lantern,

<P>THEN, by the Mass, Sir! I would do
no such thing—ne'er a Sir Lucius
O'Trigger in the kingdom should make me fight,
when I wa'n't so minded. Oons! what will the
old lady say, when she hears o't!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! David, if you had heard Sir Lu∣cius!—Odds
sparks and flames! he would have
rous'd your valour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not he, indeed. I hates such blood∣thirsty
cormorants. Look'ee, Master, if you'd
wanted a bout at boxing, quarter-staff, or short∣staff,
I should never be the man to bid you cry off:
But for your curst sharps and snaps, I never knew
any good come of 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my <HI>honour,</HI> David, my <HI>honour!</HI> I
must be very careful of my honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, by the Mass! and I would be very
careful of it; and I think in return my <HI>honour</HI>
couldn't do less than to be very careful of <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odds blades! David, no gentleman will
ever risk the loss of his honour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say then, it would be but civil in <HI>ho∣nour</HI>
never to risk the loss of the <HI>gentleman.</HI>—
Lookee, Master, this <HI>honour</HI> seems to me to be a mar∣vellous
<PB N="60" REF="76"/>
false friend; aye, truly, a very courtier-like
servant.—Put the case, I was a gentleman (which,
thank God, no one can say of me); well—my ho∣nour
makes me quarrel with another gentleman of
my acquaintance.—So—we fight. (Pleasant enough
that) Boh!—I kill him—(the more's my luck.)
Now, pray who gets the profit of it?—Why, my
<HI>honour.</HI>—But put the case that he kills me!—
by the Mass! I go to the worms, and my honour
whips over to my enemy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, David—in that case!—Odds crowns
and laurels! your honour follows you to the
grave.</P>

make a shift to do without it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Z—ds, David! you're a coward!—
It doesn't become my valour to listen to you.—
What, shall I disgrace my ancestors?—Think of
that, David—think what it would be to disgrace
my ancestors!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under favour, the surest way of not dis∣gracing
them, is to keep as long as you can out
of their company. Look'ee now, Master, to go to
them in such haste—with an ounce of lead in your
brains—I should think might as well be let alone.
Our ancestors are very good kind of folks; but
they are the last people I should choose to have a
visiting acquaintance with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>But David, now, you don't think there
is such very, very, <HI>very</HI> great danger, hey?—
Odds life! people often fight without any mischief
done!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the Mass, I think 'tis ten to one
against you!—Oons! here to meet some lion∣headed
fellow, I warrant, with his d—n'd double∣barrell'd
swords, and cut and thrust pistols! Lord
bless us! it makes me tremble to think o't!—
Those be such desperate bloody-minded weapons!
<PB N="61" REF="77"/>
Well, I never could abide 'em!—from a child I
never could fancy 'em!—I suppose there a'n't so
merciless a beast in the world as your loaded pistol!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Z—ds! I <HI>won't</HI> be afraid—Odds fire
and fury! you shan't make me afraid.—Here is
the challenge, and I have sent for my dear friend
Jack Absolute to carry it for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I'the name of mischief, let <HI>him</HI> be
the messenger.—For my part, I wouldn't lend a
hand to it for the best horse in your stable. By
the Mass! it don't look like another letter!—It is,
as I may say, a designing and malicious-looking
letter!—and I warrant smells of gunpowder like
a soldier's pouch!—Oons! I wouldn't swear it
mayn't go off!</P>

of a grass-hopper.</P>

<P>Well, I say no more—'twill be sad news,
to be sure, at Clod-Hall!—but I ha' done.—How
Phyllis will howl when she hears of it!—Aye, poor
bitch, she little thinks what shooting her Master's
going after!—And I warrant old Crop, who has
carried your honour, field and road, these ten
years, will curse the hour he was born.</P>

the heav'nly assenting smile, that first gave soul

have check'd the ardour of my thanks—Well, all
that's past!—all over indeed!—There, Madam—
in <HI>beauty,</HI> that copy is not equal to you, but in my

I might have married Lady Dorothy Car∣mine,
if it had not been for a little rogue of a Ma∣jor,
who ran away with her before she could get a

it be a touch of the old serpent in 'em, that makes
the little creatures be caught, like vipers with a bit

<P>Pray, Sir, be easy—the quarrel is a very

an affront you pass'd on me within this week.—So
no more, but name your time and place.</P>

<P>Faith! that same interruption in affairs
of this nature, shews very great ill-breeding.—
I don't know what's the reason, but in England, if
a thing of this kind gets wind, people make such
a pother, that a gentleman can never fight in peace
and quietness.—However, if it's the same to you,
Captain, I should take it as a particular kindness,
if you'd let us meet in King's-Mead-Fields, as
a little business will call me there about six o'clock,

known no other guardian—I now entrust my per∣son
to your honour—we will fly together.—When
safe from pursuit, my Father's will may be ful∣filled
—and I receive a legal claim to be the partner
of your sorrows, and tenderest comforter. Then
on the bosom of your wedded Julia, you may lull
your keen regret to slumbering; while virtuous
love, with a Cherub's hand, shall smooth the brow
of upbraiding thought, and pluck the thorn from
compunction.</P>

<P>I ask not a moment.—No, Faulkland, I
have lov'd you for yourself: and if I now, more
than ever, prize the solemn engagement which so

leaves no room for hard aspersions on my fame,

<P>Aye, but in such an abject state of life,
my wounded pride perhaps may increase the na∣tural
fretfulness of my temper, till I become a

endure. Perhaps the recollection of a deed, my
conscience cannot justify, may haunt me in such
gloomy and unsocial fits, that I shall hate the ten∣derness
that would relieve me, break from your

sealing, this once, my pardon, let me to-morrow,
in the face of Heaven, receive my future guide
and monitress, and expiate my past folly, by years
of tender adoration.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Faulkland!—that you are free from
a crime, which I before fear'd to name, Heaven
knows how sincerely I rejoice!—These are tears of
thankfulness for that! But that your cruel doubts
should have urged you to an imposition that has
wrung my heart, gives me now a pang, more keen
than I can express!</P>

<P>By Heav'ns! Julia—</P>

<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="98"/>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet hear me.—My Father lov'd you,
Faulkland! and you preserv'd the life that tender
parent gave me; in his presence I pledged my
hand—<HI>joyfully</HI> pledged it—where before I had
given my heart. When, soon after, I lost that pa∣rent,
it seem'd to me that Providence had, in Faulk∣land,
shewn me whither to transfer, without a
pause, my grateful duty, as well as my affection:
Hence I have been content to bear from you what
pride and delicacy would have forbid me from
another.—I will not upbraid you, by repeating how
you have trifled with my sincerity.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it all! yet hear—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>After such a year of trial—I might have
flattered myself that I should not have been insulted
with a new probation of my sincerity, as cruel as
unnecessary! A trick of such a nature, as to shew
me plainly, that when I thought you lov'd me
best, you even then regarded me as a mean dis∣sembler;
an artful, prudent hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never! never!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now see it is not in your nature to be con∣tent,
or confident in love. With this conviction—
I never will be yours. While I had hopes that
my persevering attention, and unreproaching kind∣ness
might in time reform your temper, I should
have been happy to have gain'd a dearer influence
over you; but I will not furnish you with a li∣censed
power to keep alive an incorrigible fault,
at the expence of one who never would contend
with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Julia, by my soul and honour,
if after this—</P>
</SP>

<P>But one word more.—As my faith has once
been given to you, I never will barter it with ano∣ther.
—I shall pray for your happiness with the
truest sincerity; and the dearest blessing I can ask of
<PB N="83" REF="99"/>
Heaven to send you, will be to charm you from
that unhappy temper, which alone has prevented
the performance of our solemn engagement.—All I
request of <HI>you</HI> is, that you will yourself reflect upon
this infirmity, and when you number up the many
true delights it has deprived you of—let it not be
your <HI>least</HI> regret, that it lost you the love of one—
who would have follow'd you in beggary through
the world!</P>

Curst as I am, with more imperfections than my
fellow-wretches, kind Fortune sent a heaven-gifted
cherub to my aid, and, like a ruffian, I have
driven her from my side!—I must now haste to my
appointment.—Well my mind is tuned for such a
scene.—I shall wish only to become a principal in
it, and reverse the tale my cursed folly put me
upon forging here.—O Love!—Tormentor!—
Fiend!—whose influence, like the Moon's, acting

<P>I will now own to you, Lydia, that Mr.
Faulkland had before inform'd me of the whole

took him for, I should not have accepted your
confidence on the subject, without a serious endea∣vour
to counteract your caprice.</P>

<P>Why, is it not provoking; when I thought
we were coming to the prettiest distress imagin∣able,
to find myself made a mere Smithfield bar∣gain
of at last—There had I projected one of
the most sentimental elopements!—so becoming a
disguise!—so amiable a ladder of Ropes!—Con∣scious
Moon—four horses—Scotch parson—with
such surprise to Mrs. Malaprop—and such para∣graphs
in the News-papers!—O, I shall die with
disappointment.</P>

<P>Now—sad reverse!—what have I to ex∣pect,
but, after a deal of flimsy preparation with
a bishop's licence, and my Aunt's blessing, to go
simpering up to the Altar; or perhaps be cried
three times in a country-church, and have an un∣mannerly
fat clerk ask the consent of every butcher
in the parish to join John Absolute and Lydia Lan∣guish,

</SP>
<SP>

<P>How mortifying, to remember the dear
delicious shifts I used to be put to, to gain half a
minute's conversation with this fellow!—How
often have I stole forth, in the coldest night in Ja∣nuary,
and found him in the garden, stuck like a
dripping statue!—There would he kneel to me
in the snow, and sneeze and cough so pathetically!
he shivering with cold, and I with apprehension!
and while the freezing blast numb'd our joints,
how warmly would he press me to pity his flame,
and glow with mutual ardour!—Ah, Julia! that
was something like being in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were in spirits, Lydia, I should chide
you only by laughing heartily at you: but it suits
more the situation of my mind, at present, earnestly
to entreat you, not to let a man, who loves you
with sincerity, suffer that unhappiness from your

<P>Odds files!—I've practised that—there,

small enough:—I'll stand edge-ways.</P>

<P>But—but—you don't know—it may go
off of its own head!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! be easy—Well, now if I hit you
in the body, my bullet has a double chance—for
if it misses a vital part on your right side—'twill
be very hard if it don't succeed on the left!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>A vital part! O, my poor vitals!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, there—fix yourself so—
<STAGE>[Placing him.</STAGE>
let him see the broad side of your full front—there

body, and never do any harm at all.</P>
</SP>

<P>Clean thro' me!—a ball or two clean
thro' me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye—may they—and it is much the
genteelest attitude into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look'ee! Sir Lucius—I'd just as leive
be shot in an aukward posture as a genteel one—
so, by my valour! I will stand edge-ways</P>

<P>Then, pray keep it fast, while you have it.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, your most obedient—hah!

you are come here, just like myself—to do a kind
office, first for your friend—then to proceed to

<P>Heark'ee, Bob, Beverley's at hand.</P>

<P>Well, Mr. Acres—I don't blame your
saluting the gentleman civilly.—So, Mr. Beverley,
(<HI>to</HI> Faulkland) if you'll chuse your weapons, the
Captain and I will measure the ground.</P>

<P><HI>My</HI> weapons, Sir.</P>

<P>What, Sir, did not you come here to
fight Mr. Acres?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Not I, upon my word, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="95" REF="111"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now, that's mighty provoking!
But I hope, Mr. Faulkland, as there are three of
us come on purpose for the game—you won't be
so cantanckerous as to spoil the party by sitting
out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>O pray, Faulkland, fight to oblige Sir
Lucius.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, if Mr. Acres is so bent on the
matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Mr. Faulkland—I'll bear my
disappointment like a Christian—Look'ee, Sir Lu∣cius,
there's no occasion at all for me to fight; and
if it is the same to you, I'd as lieve let it alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe me, Mr. Acres—I must not
be trifled with. You have certainly challenged
somebody—and you came here to fight him—
Now, if that gentleman is willing to represent him
—I can't see, for my soul, why it isn't just the
same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Z—ds, Sir Lucius—I tell you, 'tis one
Beverley I've challenged—a fellow, you see, that
dare not shew his face! If <HI>he</HI> were here, I'd make
him give up his pretensions directly!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Bob—let me set you right—there
is no such man as Beverley in the case.—The per∣son
who assumed that name is before you; and as
his pretensions are the same in both characters, he
is ready to support them in whatever way you
please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this is lucky—Now you have an
opportunity—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What, quarrel with my dear friend Jack
Absolute—not if he were fifty Beverleys! Z—ds!
Sir Lucius, you would not have me be so unnatural.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my conscience, Mr. Acres, your
valour has <HI>oozed</HI> away with a vengeance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acres.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least! Odds Backs and Abet∣tors!
I'll be your second with all my heart—and
<PB N="96" REF="112"/>
if you should get a <HI>Quietus,</HI> you may command
me entirely. I'll get you a <HI>snug lying</HI> in the <HI>Ab∣bey

Blunderbuss-hall, or any of the kind with the

<P>Nay, Sir Lucius, you can't have a better

<P>Well then, Captain, 'tis we must be∣gin

<SPEAKER>Sir Anth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a pretty fellow; I catch him
going to cut a man's throat, and he tells me, he
serves his Majesty!—Zounds! sirrah, then how
durst you draw the King's sword against one of his

<P>O! my little angel, say you so?—Sir Lu∣cius

have been intentional.—And as you must be con∣vinced,

that I should not fear to support a real in∣jury

atone for an inadvertency—I ask your pardon.—
But for this lady, while honour'd with her appro∣bation,

<P>Oh! Faulkland, you have not been more
faulty in your unkind treatment of me, than I am

<P>What's going on here?—So you have

I never interfered before; but let me have a hand in
the matter at last.—All the faults I have ever seen
in my friend Faulkland, seemed to proceed from
what he calls the <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>warmth</HI> of his affec∣tion

you'll find he'll mend surprisingly!</P>

<P>Come now, I hope there is no dissatis∣fied

better—</P>

<P>You are right, Sir Lucius.—So, Jack, I

you all meeting me there.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Faulk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our partners are stolen from us, Jack—
I hope to be congratulated by each other—yours
for having checked in time, the errors of an ill∣directed
Imagination, which might have betray'd
an innocent heart; and mine, for having, by her
gentleness and candour, reformed the unhappy
temper of one, who by it made wretched whom
he loved most, and tortured the heart he ought to
have ador'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jack, we have both tasted the Bit∣ters,
as well as the Sweets, of Love—with this dif∣ference
only, that <HI>you</HI> always prepared the bitter
cup for yourself, while <HI>I</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lyd.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was always obliged to <HI>me</HI> for it, hey!
Mr. Modesty?—But come, no more of that—
our happiness is now as unallay'd as general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let us study to preserve it so: and
while Hope pictures to us a flattering scene of fu∣ture
Bliss, let us deny its pencil those colours which
are too bright to be lasting.—When Hearts deserv∣ing
Happiness would unite their fortune, Virtue
would crown them with an unfading garland of mo∣dest,
hurtless flowers; but ill-judging Passion will
force the gaudier Rose into the wreath, whose
thorn offends them, when its Leaves are dropt!</P>
