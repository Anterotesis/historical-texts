<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I con∣fess
I was strongly prepossessed in favour of the poets
of the last age, and strove to imitate them. The
term, genteel comedy, was then unknown amongst
us, and little more was desired by an audience, than
nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they
were most conspicuous. The author of the follow∣ing
scenes never imagined that more would be ex∣pected
of him, and therefore to delineate character
has been his principal aim. Those who know any
thing of composition, are sensible, that in pursuing
humour, it will sometimes lead us into the recesses
of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in
the master of a spunging-house: but in deference to
the public taste, grown of late, perhaps, too deli∣cate,
the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the
representation. In deference also to the judgment
of a few friends, who think in a particular way, the
scene is here restored. The author submits it to the
<PB REF="6"/>
reader in his closet; and hopes that too much refine∣ment
will not banish humour and character from
ours, as it has already done from the French theatre.
Indeed the French comedy is now become so very
elevated and sentimental, that it has not only ba∣nished
humour and Moliere from the stage, but it
has banished all spectators too.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to
the public for the favourable reception which the
Good-Natur'd Man has met with: and to Mr. Col∣man
in particular, for his kindness to it. It may
not also be improper to assure any, who shall here∣after
write for the theatre, that merit, or supposed.
merit, will ever be a sufficient passport to his
protection.</P>

<L>PREST by the load of life, the weary mind</L>
<L>Surveys the general toil of human' kind;</L>
<L>With cool submission joins the lab'ring train,</L>
<L>And social sorrow, loses half its pain:</L>
<L>Our anxious bard, without complaint, may share</L>
<L>This bustling season's epidemic care.</L>
<L>Like Caesar's pilot, dignify'd by fate,</L>
<L>Tost in one common storm with all the great;</L>
<L>Distrest alike, the statesman and the wit,</L>
<L>When one a borough courts,and one the pit.</L>
<L>The busy candidates for power and fame,</L>
<L>Have hopes, and fears, and wishes, just the same;</L>
<L>Disabled both to combat, or to fly,</L>

<L>Uncheck'd on both, loud rabbles vent their rage,</L>
<L>As mongrels bay the lion in a cage.</L>
<L>Th' offended burgess hoards his angry tale,</L>

<STAGE>SCENE, an apartment in Young HONEYWOOD'S
house.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter Sir WILLIAM HONEYWOOD, JARVIS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Jarvis, make no apologies for this ho∣nest
bluntness. Fidelity, like yours, is the best ex∣cuse
for every freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help being blunt, and being very angry
too, when I hear you talk of disinheriting so good,
so worthy a young gentleman as your nephew, my
master. All the world loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather, that he loves all the world; that is
his fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure there is no part of it more dear to him
than you are, though he has not seen you since he
was a child,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies his affection to me; or how can I
be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper
and coxcomb find an easy entrance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you that he is rather too good-natur'd;
that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs
this minute with one, and cries the next with ano∣ther:
but whose instructions may he thank for all
this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not mine, sure? My letters to him during my
employment in Italy, taught him only that philoso∣phy
which might prevent, not defend his errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm sorry
they taught him any philosophy at all; it has only
serv'd to spoil him. This same philosophy is a good
horse in the stable, but an arrant jade on a journey.
For my own part, whenever I hear him mention the
name on't, I'm always sure he's going to play the
fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy,
I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature arises
rather from his fears of offending the importunate,
than his desire of making the deserving happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What it rises from, I don't know. But, to be
sure, every body has it, that asks it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or that does not ask it. I have been now for
some time a concealed spectator of his follies, and
find them as boundless as his dissipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, faith, he has some fine name or other
For them all. He calls his extravagance, generosity;
and his trusting every body, universal benevolence.
It was but last week he went security for a fellow
whose face he scarce knew, and that he called an
act of exalted mu—mu—munificence; ay, that was
the name he gave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon that I proceed, as my last effort, though
with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very
fellow has just absconded, and I have, taken up the
security. Now, my intention is to involve him in
fictitious distress, before he has plunged himself into
real calamity. To arrest him for that very debt,
to clap an officer upon him, and then let him see
which of his friends will come to his relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I could but any way see him thoroughly
vexed, every groan of his would be music to me;
yet faith, I believe it impossible. I have tried to
fret him myself every morning these three years;
but, instead of being angry, he sits as calmly to
hear me scold, as he does to his hair-dresser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must try him once more, however, and I'll
go this instant to put my scheme into execution; and
I don't despair of succeeding, as, by your means, I
can have frequent opportunities of being about him,
without being known. What a pity it is, Jarvis,
that any man's good-will to others should produce
so much neglect of himself, as to require correction?
Yet, we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate
hand. There are some faults so nearly allied to ex∣cellence,
that we can scarce weed out the vice with∣out
eradicating the virtue.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go thy ways, Sir William Honeywood. It
is not without reason that the world allows thee to
be the best of men. But here comes his hopeful
nephew; the strange, good-natur'd, foolsh, open∣hearted—And
yet, all his faults are such that one
loves him still the better for them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HONEYWOOD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jarvis, what messages from my friends this
morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have no friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; from my acquaintance then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Pulling out bills)</STAGE> A few of our usual cards of
compliment, that's all. This bill from your taylor;
this from your mercer; and this from the little bro∣ker
in Crooked-lane. He says he has been at a
great deal of trouble to get back the money you
borrowed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't know; but I'm sure we were at a
great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has lost all patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he has lost a very good thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's that ten guineas you were fending to the
poor gentleman and his children in the Fleet. I
believe that would stop his mouth, for a while at
least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Jarvis, but what will fill their mouths in the
mean time? Must I be cruel because he happens to
be importunate; and, to relieve his avarice, leave
them to insupportable distress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! Sir, the question now is how to relieve
yourself. Yourself—Hav'nt I reason to be out of
my senses, when I see things going at sixes and
sevens?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever reason you may have for being out of
your senses, I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite
unreasonable for continuing in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're the only man alive in your present situa∣tion
that could do so—Every thing upon the waste.
There's Miss Richland and her fine fortune gone
already, and upon the point of being given to your
rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm no man's rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your uncle in Italy preparing to disinherit you;
your own fortune almost spent; and nothing but
pressing creditors, false friends, and a pack of drun∣ken
servants that your kindness has made unfit for
any other family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they have the more occasion for being in
mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soh! What will you have done with him that I
caught stealing your plate in the pantry? In the
fact; I caught him in the fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fact? If so, I really think that we should
pay him his Wages, and turn him off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shall be turn'd off at Tyburn, the dog; we'll
hang him, if it be only to frighten the rest of the
family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Jarvis: it's enough that we have lost what
he has stolen, let us not add to it the loss of a fel∣low
creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine; well, here was the footman just now,
to complain of the butler; he says he does most
work, and ought to have most wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but just; though perhaps here comes the
butler to complain of the footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, its the way with them all, from the scullion
to the privy-counsellor. If they have a bad master,
they keep quarrelling with him: if they have a good
master, they keep quarrelling with one another.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter BUTLER, drunk.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUTLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll not stay in the family with Jonathan
you must part with him, or part with me, that's the
ex-ex-exposition of the matter, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Full and explicit enough. But what's his fault,
good Philip?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>BUTLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, he's given to drinking, Sir, and I shall have
my morals corrupted, by keeping such company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha' ha! He has such a diverting way—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O quite amusing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I find my wines a-going, Sir; and liquors don't

<P>Well, well, Philip, I'll hear yon upon that ano∣ther
time, so go to bed now.</P>

<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>To bed! Let him go the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUTLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begging your honour's pardon, and begging your
pardon, master Jarvis, I'll not go to bed, nor to the
devil neither. I hare enough to do to mind my cel∣lar.
I forgot, your honour, Mr. Croaker is below.
I came on purpose to tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why didn't you shew him up, blockhead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUTLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew him up, Sir! With all my heart, Sir. Up
or down, all's one to me.</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, we have one or other of that family in this
house from morning till night. He comes on the
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
old affair, I suppose. The match between his son,
that's just returned from Paris, and Miss Richland,
the young lady he's guardian to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so. Mr. Croaker, knowing my friend∣ship
for the young lady, has got it into his head
that I can perswade her to what I please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if you loved yourself but half as well as she
loves you, we should soon fee a marriage that would
set all things to rights again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love me! Sure, Jarvis, you dream. No, no;
her intimacy with me never amounted to more than
friendship—mere friendship. That she is the most
lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart
with desire, I own. But never let me harbour a
thought of making her unhappy, by a connection
with one so unworthy her merits as I am. No, Jar∣vis,
it shall be my study to serve her, even in spite
of my wishes; and to secure her happiness, though
it destroys my own.</P>
<P>JARVIS.</P>
<P>Was ever the like! I want patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Jarvis, though I could obtain Miss Rich∣land's
consent, do you think I could succeed with
her guardian, or Mrs. Croaker his wife; who, tho'
both very fine in their way, are yet a little opposite
in, their dispositions you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Opposite enough, heaven knows; the very reverse
of each other; she all laugh and no joke; he al∣ways
complaining and never sorrowful; a fretful
poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in
the four and twenty—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong.
There is something in my friend Croaker's conver∣sation
that quite depresses me. His very mirth is
an antidote to all gaiety, and his appearance has a
stronger effect on my spirits than an undertaker's
shop.—Mr. Croaker, this is such a satisfaction—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter CROAKER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pleasant morning to Mr. Honeywood, and
many of them. How is this! you look most shock∣ingly
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
to day, my dear friend. I hope this weather
does not affect your spirits. To be sure, if this
weather continues—I say nothing—But God send we
be all better this day three months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heartily concur in the wish, though I own not
in your apprehensions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not! indeed what signifies what weather
we have in a country going to ruin like ours? taxes
rising and trade falling. Money flying out of the
kingdom, and Jesuits swarming into it. I know at
this time no less than an hundred and twenty-seven
Jesuits between Charing-cross and Temple-bar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Jesuits will scarce pervert you or me, I should
hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not. Indeed what signifies whom they
pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to
lose? I'm only afraid for our wives and daughters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no apprehensions for the ladies, I assure
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not. Indeed what signifies whether they
be perverted or no? the women in my time were
good for something. I have seen a lady drest from
top to toe in her own manufactures formerly. But
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
now a-days the devil a thing of their own manufac∣tures
about them, except their faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, however these faults may be practised abroad,
you don't find them at home, either with Mrs.
Croaker, Olivia, or Miss Richland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best of them will never be canoniz'd for a
saint when she's dead. By the bye, my dear friend,
I don't find this match between Miss Richland and
my son much relished, either b y one side or t'other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Mr. Honeywood, a little of your fine serious
advice to the young lady might go far: I know she
has a very exalted opinion of your understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>But would not that be usurping an authority that
more properly belongs to yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, you know but little of my autho∣rity
at home. People think, indeed, because they
see me come out in a morning thus, with a pleasant
face, and to make my friends merry, that all's well
within. But I have cares that would break an heart
of stone. My wife has so encroached upon every
one of my privileges, that I'm now no more than a
mere lodger in my own house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a little spirit exerted on your side might per∣haps
restore your, authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, though I had the spirit of a lion! I do rouze
sometimes. But what then! always haggling and
haggling. A man is tired of getting the better be∣fore
his wife is tired of losing the victory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a melancholy consideration indeed, that our
chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties,
and that an encrease of our possessions is but an, in∣let
to new disquietudes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear friend, these were the very words of
poor Dick Doleful to me not a week before he made,
away with himself. Indeed, Mr. Honeywood, I
never fee you but you put me in mind of poor—Dick.
Ah there was merit neglected for you! and
so true a friend; we lov'd each other for thirty
years, and yet he never asked me to lend him a sin∣gle
farthing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what could induce him to commit so rash an
action at last?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, some people were malicious enough
to say it was keeping company with me; because
we used to meet, now and then and open our hearts
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
to each other. To be sure I loved to hear him talk,
and he loved to hear me talk; poor dear Dick. He
us'd to say that Croaker rhim'd to joker,; and so we
us'd to laugh—Poor Dick. <STAGE>(Going to cry.)</STAGE></P>

<P>His fate affects me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, he grew sick of this miserable, life, where we
do nothing but eat and grow hungry, dress and un∣dress,
get up and lie down; while reason, that
should watch like a nurse by our side, falls as fast
asleep as we do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>To say truth, if we compare that part of life
which is to come, by that which we have past, the
prospect is hideous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Life at the greatest and best is but a froward child,
that must be humour'd and coax'd a little till it falls
asleep, and then all the care is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Sir, nothing can exceed the vanity of
our existence, but the folly of our pursuits. We
wept when we came into the world, and every day
tells us why.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear friend, it is a perfect satisfaction to
be miserable with you. My son Leontine shan't lose
the benefit of such fine conversation. I'll just step
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
home for him. I am willing to shew him so much
seriousness in one scarce older than himself—And
what if I bring my last letter to the Gazetteer on
the encrease and progress of earthquakes? It will
amuse us, I promise you. I there prove how the late
earthquake is coming round to pay us another visit
from London to Lisbon, from Lisbon to the Canary
Islands, from the Canary Islands to Palmyra, from
Palmyra to Constantinople, and so from Constanti∣nople
back to London again.</P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Croaker! his situation deserves the utmost
pity. I shall scarce recover my spirits these three
days. Sure to live upon such terms is worse than
death itself. And yet, when I consider my own si∣tuation,
a broken fortune, an hopeless passion, friends
in distress; the wish but not the power to serve
them— <STAGE>(pausing and sighing.)</STAGE></P>

<P>You're always in such spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have just come, my dear Honeywood, from
the auction. There was the old deaf dowager, as
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
usual, bidding like a fury against herself. And
then so curious in antiques! herself the most genu∣ine
piece of antiquity in the whole collection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, ladies, if some uneasiness from friend∣ship
makes me unfit to share in this good humour:
I know you'll pardon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken
a dose of my husband this morning. Well, if Rich∣land
here can pardon you, I must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would seem to insinuate, madam, that I have
particular reasons for being disposed to refuse it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever I insinuate, my dear, don't be so ready
to wish an explanation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I should be sorry, Mr. Honeywood's long
friendship and mine should be misunderstood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no answering for others, madam. But I
hope you'll never find me presuming to offer more
than the most delicate friendship may readily allow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I shall be prouder of such a tribute from you
than the most passionate professions from others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own sentiments, madam: friendship is a dis∣interested
commerce between equals; love, an ab∣ject
intercourse between tyrants and slaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, without a compliment, I know none more
disinterested, or more capable of friendship than Mr. Honeywood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, indeed, I know nobody that has more
friends, at least among the ladies. Miss Fruzz,
Miss Odbody, and Miss Winterbottom praise him
in all companies. As for Miss Biddy Bundle, she's
his professed admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! an admirer! I did not know, Sir, you
were such a favourite there. But is she seriously so
handsome? Is she the mighty thing talked of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The town, madam, seldom begins to praise a
lady's beauty, till she's beginning to lose it. <STAGE>(Smiling.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she's resolv'd never to lose it, it seems. For,
as her natural face decays, her skill improves in
making the artificial one. Well, nothing diverts me
more than one of those fine, old, dressy things, who
thinks to conceal her age, by every where exposing
her person; sticking herself up in the front of a side∣box;
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
trailing through a minuet at Almack's; and
then, in the public gardens, looking for all the world
like one of the painted ruins of the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every age has its admirers, ladies. While you,
perhaps, are trading among the warmer climates of
youth; there ought to be some to carry on an useful
commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, then, the mortifications they must suffer, be∣fore
they can be fitted out for traffic. I have seen
one of them fret an whole morning at her hair∣dresser,
when all the fault was her face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I'll engage, has carried that face at last
to a very good market. This good-natur'd town,
madam, has husbands, like spectacles, to fit every
age, from fifteen to fourscore.</P>
<P>Mrs. CROAKER.</P>
<P>Well, you're a dear good-natur'd creature. But
you know you're engaged with us this morning up∣on
a strolling party. I want to shew Olivia the
town, and the things; I believe I shall have busi∣ness
for you for the whole day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, madam, I have an appointment with
Mr. Croaker, which it is impossible to put off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! with my husband! then I'm resolved to
take no refusal. Nay, I protest you must. You
know I never laugh so much, as with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if I must, I must. I'll swear you have put
me into such spirits. Well, do you find jest, and
I'll find laugh, I promise you. We'll wait for the
chariot in the next room.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There they go, thoughtless and happy. My dear∣est
Olivia, what would I give to see you capable of
sharing in their amusements, and as cheerful as they
are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, my Leontine, how can I be cheerful, when
I have so many terrors to oppress me? the fear of
being detected by this family, and the apprehensions
of a censuring world, when I must be detected—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world! my love, what can it say? At worst
it can only say that, being compelled by a merce∣nary
guardian to embrace a life you disliked, you
formed a resolution of flying with the man of your
choice; that you confided in his honour, and took
refuge in my father's house; the only one where
your's could remain without censure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, Leontine, your disobedience and
my indiscretion: your being sent to France to bring
home a sister; and, instead of a sister, bringing
home—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>One dearer than a thousand sisters. One that I
am convinc'd will be equally dear, to the rest of the
family, when she comes to be known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that, I fear, will shortly be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible, 'till we ourselves think proper to make
the discovery. My sister, you know, has been with
her aunt, at Lyons, since she was a child, and you
find every creature in the family takes you for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mayn't she write, mayn't her aunt write?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her aunt scarce ever writes, and all my sister's
letters are directed to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But won't your refusing Miss Richland, for whom
you know the old gentleman intends you, create a
suspicion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there's my master-stroke. I have resolved
not to refuse her; nay, an hour hence I have con∣sented
to go with my father, to make her an offer
of my heart and fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your heart and fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd, my dearest. Can Olivia think
so meanly of my honour, or my love, as to suppose
I could ever hope for happiness from any but her?
No, my Olivia, neither the force, nor, permit me
to add, the delicacy of my passion, leave any
room to suspect me. I only offer Miss Richland an
heart, I am convinc'd she will refuse; as I am con∣fident,
that, without knowing it, her affections are
fixed upon Mr. Honeywood</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood! You'll excuse my apprehen∣sions;
but when your merits come to be put in the
balance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You view them with too much partiality. How∣ever,
by making this offer, I shew a seeming com∣pliance
with my father's command; and perhaps,
upon her refusal, I may have his consent to chuse
for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I submit. And yet, my Leontine, I own,
I shall envy her, even your pretended addresses. I
consider every look, every expression of your esteem,
as due only to me. This is folly perhaps: I allow
it: but it is natural to suppose, that merit which
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
has made an impression on one's own heart, may be
powerful over that of another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't, my life's treasure, don't let us make ima∣ginary
evils, when yon know we have so many real
ones to encounter. At worst, yon know, if Miss
Richland should consent, or my father refuse his
pardon, it can but end in a trip to Scotland; and—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter CROAKER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where have you been, boy? I have been seeking
you. My friend Honeywood here, has been saying
such comfortable things. Ah! he's an example in∣deed.
Where is he? I left him here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I believe you may see him, and hear him too
in the next room: he's preparing to go out with the
ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good gracioas, can I believe my eyes or my ears!
I'm struck dumb with his vivacity, and stunn'd with
the loudness of his laugh. Was there ever such a
transformation! <STAGE>(A laugh behind the scenes, Croaker
mimics it.)</STAGE> Ha! ha! ha! there it goes: a plague
take their balderdash; yet I could expect nothing
lest, when my precious wife was of the party. On
my conscience, I believe, she could spread an horse∣laugh
through the pews of a tabernacle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you find so many objections to a wife, sir,
how can you be so earnest in recommending one to
me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you, and tell you again, boy, that
Miss Richland's fortune must not go out of the fa∣mily;
one may find comfort in the money, whatever
one does in the wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, though, in obedience to your desire, I
am ready to marry her; it may be possible, she has
no inclination to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you once for all how it stands. A good
part of Miss Richland's large fortune consists in a
claim upon government, which my good friend,
Mr. Lofty, assures me the treasury will allow. One
half of this she is to forfeit, by her father's will, in
case she refuses to marry you. So, if she rejects
you, we seize half her fortune; if she accepts
you, we seize the whole, and a fine girl into the
bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, if you will but listen to reason—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, then, produce your reasons. I tell you.
I'm fix'd, determined, so now produce your reasons.
When I'm determined, I always listen to reason, be∣cause
it can then do no harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have alledged that a mutual choice was the
first requisite in matrimonial happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and you have both of you a mutual choice.
She has her choice—to marry you, or lose half her
fortune; and you have your choice—to marry her,
or pack out of doors without any fortune at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An only son, Sir, might expect more indulgence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>An only father, Sir, might expect more obedi∣ence;
besides, has not your sister here, that never
disobliged me in her life, as good a right as you?
He's a sad dog, Livy, my dear, and would take all
from you. But he shan't, I tell you he shan't, for
you shall have your share.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, I wish you'd be convinced that I can
never be happy in any addition to my fortune,
which is taken from his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, it's a good child, so say no more;
but come with me, and we shall see something that
will give us a great deal of pleasure, I promise you;
old Ruggins, the curry-comb-maker, lying in state;
I'm told he makes a very handsome corpse, and be∣comes
his coffin prodigiously. He was an intimate
friend of mine, and these are friendly things we
ought to do for each other.</P>

<P>OLIVIA not his sister? Olivia not Leontine's

<P>No more his sister than I am; I had it all from

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how? Tell me again, Garnet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, as I told you before, instead of
going to Lyons, to bring home his sister, who has
been there with her aunt these ten years; he never
went further than Paris; there he saw and fell in
love with this young lady, by the bye, of a prodi∣gious
family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And brought her home to my guardian, as his
daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and his daughter she will be. If he don't
consent to their marriage, they talk of trying what
a Scotch parson can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own they have deceived me—And so de∣murely
as Olivia carried it to!—Would you believe
it, Garnet, I told her all my secrets; and yet the
sly cheat concealed all this from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, upon my word, madam, I don't much
blame her; she was loth to trust one with her se∣crets,
that was so very bad at keeping her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, to add to their deceit, the young gentleman,
it seems, pretends to make me serious proposals.
My guardian and he are to be here presently, to
open the affair in form. You know I am to lose
half my fortune if I refuse him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, what can you do? For being, as you are, in
love with Mr. Honeywood, madam—</P>

<P>How! idiot; what do you mean? In love with
Mr. Honeywood! Is this to provoke me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, madam, in friendship with him; I meant
nothing more than friendship, as I hope to be mar∣ried;
nothing more.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, no more of this! As to my guardian, and
his son, they shall find me prepared to receive them;
I'm resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure,
to mortify them by compliance, and so
throw the refusal at last upon them.</P>

<P>Why, girl, I Only oppose my prudence to their
cunning, and practise a lesson they have taught me

my son here comes to open, that nearly concerns

<P>Himself! madam, he would die before he could
make such a confession; and if he had not a channel

drowned his understanding.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must grant, Sir, there are attractions in modest
diffidence above the force of words. A silent ad∣dress
is the genuine eloquence of sincerity.</P>

<P>Madam, he has forgot to speak any other lan∣guage;
silence is become his mother tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it must be confessed, Sir, it speaks very
powerfully in his favour. And yet I shall be

thought too forward in making such a confession;
shan't I, Mr. Leontine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confusion! my reserve will undo me. But, if
modesty attracts her, impudence may disgust her.
I'll try. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Don't imagine from my silence,
madam, that I want a due sense of the honour and
happiness intended me. My father, madam, tells
me, your humble servant is not totally indifferent to
you. He admires you; I adore you; and when we
come together, upon my soul I believe we shall be
the happiest couple in all St. James's.</P>

<P>If I could flatter myself, you thought as you
speak, Sir—</P>

come over the boy? What signifies asking, when

would ask to the purpose, ask this lady's consent to
make you happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why indeed, Sir, his uncommon ardour almost
compels me—forces me to comply. And yet I'm
afraid he'll despise a conquest gained with too much
ease: won't you, Mr. Leontine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confusion! <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Oh, by no means, madam,
by no means. And yet, madam, you talked of
force. There is nothing I would avoid so much as
compulsion in a thing of this kind. No, madam,
I will still be generous, and leave you at liberty to
refuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you, Sir, the lady is not at liberty. It's
a match. You see she says nothing. Silence gives
consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, she talked of force. Consider, Sir, the
cruelty of constraining her inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I say there's no cruelty. Don't you know,
blockhead, that girls have always a roundabout way
of saying yes before company? So get you both

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR NICK,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN English gentleman, of large fortune, has
for some time made private, though honourable
proposals to your daughter Olivia. They love
each other tenderly, and I find she has consented,
without letting any of the family know, to crown
his addresses. As such good offers don't come
every day, your own good sense, his large fortune,
and family considerations, will induce you to for∣give
her.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours ever,
RACHAEL CROAKER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>My daughter, Olivia, privately contracted to a
man of large fortune ! This is good news, indeed.
My heart never foretold me of this. And yet, how
silly the little baggage has carried it since she came
home. Not a word on't to the old ones for the
world. Yet, I thought, I saw something she want∣ed
to conceal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if they have concealed their amour, they
shan't conceal their wedding; that shall be public,
I'm resolved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee, woman, the wedding is the most foolish
part of the ceremony. I can never get this woman
to think of the more serious part of the nuptial en∣gagement.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, would you have me think of their funeral?
But come, tell me, my dear, don't you owe more
to me than you care to confess? Would you have
ever been known to Mr. Lofty, who has undertaken
Miss Richland's claim at the treasury, but for me?
Who was it first made him an acquaintance at lady
Shabbaroon's rout? Who got him to promise us his
interest? Is not he a back-stairs favourite, one that
can do what he pleases with those that do what they
please? Is not he an acquaintance that all your
groaning and lamentations could never have got
us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a man of importance, I grant you. And
yet, what amazes me is, that while he is giving
away places to all the world, he can't get one for
himself.</P>

<P>I vow to gad, madam, you make me blush. I'm
nothing, nothing, nothing in the world; a mere
obscure gentleman. To be sure, indeed, one or
two of the present ministers are pleased to represent
me as a formidable man. I know they are pleased
to be-spatter me at all their little dirty levees.
Yet, upon my soul, I wander what they see in me
to treat me so! Measures, not men, have always
been my mark; and I vow, by all that's honoura∣ble,
my resentment has never done the men, as mere
men, any manner of harm—that is as mere men.</P>

<P>Oh, if you talk of modesty, madam! there I own,
I'm accessible to praise: modesty is my foible: it
was so, the duke of Brentford used to say of me.
"I love Jack Lofty, he used to say:" no man has a
finer knowledge of things; quite a man of inform∣ation;
and when he speaks upon his legs, by the
Lord he's prodigious, he scouts them; and yet all
men have their faults; too much modesty is his, says
his grace.</P>

<P>O, there indeed I'm in bronze. Apropos! I have
just been mentioning Miss Richland's case to a cer∣tain
personage; we must name no names. When I
ask, I'm not to be put off, madam. No, no, I take
my friend by the button. A fine girl, Sir; great
justice in her case. A friend of mine. Borough

<P>A prisoner in his own house! How! At this very

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why so am I. The man, to be sure, was im∣mensely
good-natur'd. But then I could never find
that he had any thing in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>His manner, to be sure, was excessive harmless;
some, indeed, thought it a little dull. For my part,
I always concealed my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can't be concealed, madam; the man was dull,
dull as the last new comedy! A poor impracticable
creature? I tried once or twice to know if he was
fit for business; but he had scarce talents to be
groom-porter to an orange barrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How differently does Miss Richland think of
him! For, I believe, with all his faults, she loves
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loves him! Does she? You should cure her of
that by all means. Let me see; what if she were

sent to him this instant, in his present doleful situ∣ation?
My life for it, that works her cure. Dis∣tress
is a perfect antidote to love. Suppose we join
her in the next room? Miss Richland is a fine girl,
has a fine fortune, and must not be thrown away.
Upon my honour, madam, I have a regard for Miss
Richland; and rather than she should be thrown
away, I should think it no indignity to marry her
myself.</P>

me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Leontine, there's nothing so indelicate in
being sensible of your merit. If so, I fear, I shall
be the most guilty thing alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you mistake, my dear. The same attention
I used to advance my merit with you, I practised to
lessen it with her. What more could I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us now rather consider what's to be done.
We have both dissembled too long—I have always
been ashamed—I am now quite weary of it. Sure
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
I could never have undergone so much for any other
but you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you shall find my gratitude equal to your
kindest compliance. Though our friends should to∣tally
forsake us, Olivia, we can draw upon content
for the deficiencies of fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why should we defer our scheme of humble
happiness, when it is now in our power? I may be
the favourite of your father, it is true; but can it
ever be thought, that his present kindness to a sup∣posed
child, will continue to a known deceiver?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many reasons to believe it will. As his
attachments are but few, they are lasting. His own
marriage was a private one, as ours may be. Be∣sides,
I have sounded him already at a distance, and
find all his answers exactly to our wish. Nay, by
an expression or two that dropped from him, I am
induced to think he knows of this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But that would be an happiness too great
to be expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>However it be, I'm certain you have power over
him; and am persuaded, if you informed him of
our situation, that he would be disposed to pardon
it.</P>
</SP>

<P>You had equal expectations, Leontine, from your

has succeeded most wretchedly.</P>

<P>The law does nothing without reason. I'm

<P>Ay, favours are more easily asked than granted,

till the debt is discharged; for which I shall be pro∣perly
grateful.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh? that's another maxum, and altogether with∣in

<P>Oh! your honour; I hope your honour takes no∣thing
amiss as I does, as I does nothing but my duty
in so doing. I'm sure no man can say I ever give
a gentleman, that was a gentleman, ill usage. If
I saw that a gentleman was a gentleman, I have
taken money not to see him for ten weeks toge∣ther.</P>

<P>Tenderness is a virtue, Mr. Twitch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, it's a perfect treasure. I love to see a
gentleman with a tender heart. I don't know, but
I think I have a tender heart myself. If all that I
have lost by my heart was put together, it would
make a—but no matter for that.</P>

<P>Don't account it lost, Mr. Twitch. The Ingra∣titude

happiness of having acted with humanity our∣selves.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humanity, Sir, is a jewel. It's better than gold.
I love humanity. People may say, that we, in our
way, have no humanity; but I'll shew yon my hu∣manity
this moment. There's my follower here,
little Flanigan, with a wife and four children, a
guinea or two would be more to him, than twice
as much to another. Now, as I can't shew him
any humanity myself, I must beg leave you'll do it

to be sure, has a good face; a very good face: but

<P>I'm told so. And I own, it has often surprized

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, Mr. Honeywood, this does not convince me
but that severity in criticism is necessary. It was
our first adopting the severity of French taste, that
has brought them in turn to taste us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Taste us! By the Lord, madam, they devour us.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! the vulgar rogues; all will be out. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
Right, gentlemen, very right, upon my word, and
quite to the purpose. They draw a parallel, ma∣dam,
between the mental taste and that of our senses.
We are injured as much by French severity in the
one, as by French rapacity in the other. That's
their meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I don't see the force of the parallel, yet,
I'll own, that we should sometimes pardon books,
as we do our friends, that have now and then agree∣able
absurdities to recommend them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all my eye. The king only can pardon,
as the laws says: for, set in case—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm quite of your opinion, Sir. I see the whole
drift of your argument. Yes, certainly, our pre∣suming
to pardon any work, is arrogating a power
that belongs to a another. If all have power to
condemn, what writer can be free?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BRILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>By his habus corpus. His habus corpus can set
him free at any time: for, set in case—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm obliged to you, Sir, for the hint. If, ma∣dam
as my friend observes, our laws are so careful
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
of a gentleman's person, sure we ought to be equal∣ly
careful of his dearer part, his fame.</P>

<P>Ay, but if so be a man's nabb'd, you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Flanigan, if you spoke for ever, you could
not improve the last observation. For my own part,
I think it conclusive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for. the matter of that, mayhap—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, give me leave in this instance to be po∣sitive.
For, where is the necessity of censuring
works without genius, which must shortly sink of
themselves? what is it, but aiming our unnecessary
blow against a victim already under the hands of
justice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAILIFF.</SPEAKER>

I think I am at home there: for, in a course
of law—</P>

<P>My dear Mr. Twitch, I discern what you'd be at

the art with which it is introduced. I suppose you
perceive the meaning, madam of his course of law.</P>

<P>Ay, it is certainly so. Well, though his per∣plexities
are far from giving me pleasure, yet I own
there's something very ridiculous in them, and a just
punishment for his dissimulation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GARNET.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so they are. But I wonder, madam, that the
lawyer you just employed to pay his debts, and set
him free, has not done it by this time. He ought
at least to have been here before now. But lawyers
are always more ready to get a man into troubles,
than out of them.</P>

<STAGE>Enter Sir WILLIAM.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Miss Richland to undertake setting him free,
I own, was quite unexpected. It has totally un∣hinged
my schemes to reclaim him. Yet, it gives
me pleasure to find, that, among a number of worth∣less
friendships, he has made one acquisition of real
value; for there must be some softer passion on her
side that prompts this generosity. Ha! here before
me: I'll endeavour to sound her affections. Ma∣dam,
as I am the person that have had some de∣mands
upon the gentleman of this house, I hope
you'll excuse me, if, before I enlarged him, I want∣ed
to see yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>The precaution was very unnecessary, Sir. I sup∣pose
your wants were only such as my agent had
power to satisfy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Partly, madam. But, I was also willing you
should be fully apprized of the character of the gen∣tleman
you intended to serve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must come, sir, with a very ill grace from you.
To censure it, after what you have done, would
look like malice; and, to speak favourably of a
character you have oppressed, would be impeaching
your own. And sure, his tenderness, his humanity,
his universal friendship, may atone for many faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That friendship, madam, which is exerted in too
wide a sphere, becomes totally useless. Our boun∣ty,
like a drop of water, disappears when diffused
too widely. They, who pretend most to this uni∣versal
benevolence, are either deceivers, or dupes.
Men who desire to cover their private ill-nature, by
a pretended regard for all; or, men who, reasoning
themselves into false feelings, are more earnest in
pursuit of splendid, than of useful virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surprised, Sir, to hear one, who has probably
been a gainer by the folly of others, so severe in his censure of it.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever I may have gained by folly, madam, you
see I am willing to prevent your losing by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cares for me, Sir, are unnecessary. I always
suspect those services which are denied where they
are wanted, and offered, perhaps, in hopes of a re∣fusal.
No, Sir, my directions have been given, and
I insist upon their being complied with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou amiable woman! I can no longer contain
the expressions of my gratitude: my pleasure. You
see before you one, who has been equally careful of
his interest; one, who has for some time been a con∣cealed
spectator of his follies, and only punished, in
hopes to reclaim them—his uncle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Honeywood! You amaze me. How
shall I conceal my confusion? I fear, Sir, you'll
think I have been too forward in my services. I
confess I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't make any apologies, madam. I only find
myself unable to repay the obligation. And yet, I
have been trying my interest of late to serve you.

should happen, especially to a man I have shewn
every where, and carried amongst us as a particular
acquaintance.</P>

<P>My dear madam, what can a private man like me
do? One man can't do every thing; and then, I
do so much in this way every day: let me see;
something considerable might be done for him by
subscription; it could not fail if I carried the
list. I'll undertake to set down a brace of dukes,
two dozen lords, and half the lower house, at my
own peril.</P>

might reject the offer of such powerful patronage.</P>

<P>Then, madam, what can we do? You know I
never make promises. In truth, I once or twice
tried to do something with him in the way of busi∣ness;
but, as I often told his uncle, Sir William
Honeywood, the man was utterly impracticable.</P>

<P>His uncle! Then that gentleman, I suppose, is a

<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meaning me, Sir?—Yes, madam, as I often said,
my dear Sir William, you are sensible I would do
any thing, as far as my poor interest goes, to serve
your family: but what can be done? there's no
procuring first-rate places for ninth-rate abilities.</P>

some reason to confide in my Judgment; one little
reason, perhaps.</P>

<P>Pray, Sir, What was it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>A better head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, at a bottle. To be sure, he was as dull as a

grateful; and gratitude hides a multitude of faults.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>He might have reason, perhaps. His place is
pretty considerable, I'm told.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A trifle, a mere trifle, among us men of business.
The truth is, he wanted dignity to fill up a greater.</P>

<P>Dignity of person, do you mean, Sir? I'm told
he's much about my size and figure, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<P>That would be quite unnecessary.</P>

<P>Well, we must introduce you then. Call upon

<P>Well, if it must be now, now let it be. But damn
it, that's unfortunate; my lord Grig's cursed Pen∣sacola

business comes on this very hour, and I'm
engaged to attend—another time—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>A short letter to Sir William will do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have it; yet, in my opinion, a letter is
a very bad way of going to work; face to face,
that's my way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>The letter, Sir, will do quite as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! Sir, do you pretend to direct me; di∣rect
me in the business of office? Do you know me,
Sir? who am I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mr. Lofty, this request is not so much his
as mine; if my commands—but you despise my
power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delicate creature! your commands could even
controul a debate at midnight: to a power so con∣stitutional,
I am all obedience and tranquility. He
shall have a letter; where is my secretary! Dubar∣dieu!
And yet, I protest I don't like this way of
doing business. I think if I spoke first to Sir Wil∣liam—But
you will have it so.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM, alone.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! This too is one of my nephew's
hopefull associates. O vanity, thou constant deceiver,
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
how do all thy efforts to exalt, serve but to sink
us! Thy false colourings, like those employed, to
heighten beauty, only seem to mend that bloom
which they contribute to destroy. I'm not displeas∣ed
at this interview: exposing this fellow's impu∣dence
to the contempt it deserves, may be of use to
my design; at least, if he can reflect, it will be of
use to himself.</P>

<P>How now, Jarvis, where's your master, my ne∣phew?</P>

<P>At his wit's end, I believe: he's scarce gotten
out of one scrape, but he's running his head into
another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>The house has but just been cleared of the bailiffs,
and now he's again engaging tooth and nail in as∣sisting
old Croaker's son to patch up a clandestine
match with the young lady that passes in the house
for his sister.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ever busy to serve others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, any body but himself. The young couple,
it seems, are just setting out for Scotland; and he
supplies them with money for the Journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money! how is he able to supply others, who
has scarce any for himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there it is: he has no money, that's true;
but then, as he never said no to any request in his
life, he has given them a bill, drawn by a friend of
his upon a merchant in the city, which I am to get
changed; for you must know that I am to go with
them to Scotland myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems the young gentleman is obliged to take a
different road from his mistress, as he is to call upon
an uncle of his that lives out of the way, in order
to prepare a place fore their reception, when they
return; so they have borrowed me from my master,
as the properest person to attend the young lady
down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the land of matrimony! A pleasant journey,
Jarvis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, but I'm only to have all the fatigues on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it may be shorter, and less fatiguing, than
you imagine. I know but too much of the young
lady's family and connections, whom I have seen
abroad. I have also discovered that Miss Richland
is not indifferent to my thoughtless nephew; and
will endeavour, thought I fear, in vain, to establish
that connection. But, come, the litter I wait for
muft be almost finished; I'll let you further into my
intentions, in the next room.</P>

<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, sure the devil's in me of late, for run∣ning
my head into such defiles, as nothing but a
genius like my own could draw me from. I was
formerly contented to husband out my places and
pensions with some degree of frugality; but, curse
it, of late I have given away the whole Court Re∣gister
in less time than they could print the title
page: yet, hang it, why scruple a lie or two to
come at a fine girl, when I every day tell a thousand
for nothing. Ha! Honeywood here before me.
Could Miss Richland have set him at liberty?</P>
<STAGE>Enter HONEYWOOD.</STAGE>
<P>Mr. Honeywood, I'm glad to see you abroad
again. I find my concurrence was not necessary
in your unfortunate affairs. I had put things in a train
to do your business; but it is not for me to say what
I intended doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was unfortunate indeed, Sir. But what adds
to my uneasiness is, that while you seem to be ac∣quainted
with my misfortune, I, myself, continue
still a stranger to my benefactor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! not know the friend that served you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can't guess at the person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inquire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have; but all I can learn is, that he chuses to
remain concealed, and that all inquiry must be fruit∣less.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must be fruitless?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absolutely fruitless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very sure.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll be damn'd if you shall ever know it
from me.</P>

<P>How, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose now, Mr. Honeywood, you think my
rent-roll very considerable, and that I have vast sums
of money to throw away; I know you do. The
world to be sure says such things of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world, by what I learn, is no stranger to your
generosity. But where does this tend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To nothing; nothing in the world. The town,
to be sure, when it makes such a thing as me the
subject of conversation, has asserted, that I never
yet patronized a man of merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard instances to the contrary, even from
yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Honeywood, and there are instances to the
contrary, that you shall never hear from myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! dear Sir, permit me to ask you but one
question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, ask me no questions: I say, Sir, ask me no
questions; I'll be damn'd, if I answer them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will ask no further. My friend! my benefactor,
it is, it must be here, that I am indebted for free∣dom,
for honour. Yes, thou worthiest of men,
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
from the beginning I suspected it, but was afraid to
return thanks; which, if undeserved, might seem
reproaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest I don't understand all this, Mr. Honey∣wood.
You treat me very cavalierly. I do assure
you, Sir.—Blood, Sir, can't a man be permitted to
enjoy the luxury of his own feelings, without all
this parade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, do not attempt to conceal an action that
adds to your honour. Your looks, your air, your
manner, all confess it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confess it, Sir! Torture itself, Sir, shall never
bring me to confess it. Mr. Honeywood, I have
admitted you upon terms of friendship. Don't let
us fall out; make me happy, and let this be buried
in oblivion. You know I hate ostentation; you
know I do. Come, come, Honeywood, you know
I always loved to be a friend, and not a patron. I
beg this may make no kind of distance between us.
Come, come, you and I must be more familiar—Indeed
we must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! Can I ever repay such friendship! Is
there any way! Thou best of men, can I ever re∣turn
the obligation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A bagatelle, a mere bagatelle! But I see your
heart is labouring to be grateful. You shall be
grateful. It would be cruel to disappoint you.</P>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! teach me the manner. Is there any way?</P>
</SP>

<P>Miss Richland!</P>

<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Miss Richland. She has struck the blow un

</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! was ever any thing more unfortunate!
It is too much to be endured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunate indeed! And yet I can endure it,
till you have opened the affair to her for me. Be∣tween
ourselves, I think she likes me. I'm not apt
to boast, but I think she does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But, do you know the person you ap∣ply
to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOFTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know you are her friend and mine: that's
enough. To you, therefore, I commit the success
of my paffion. I'll say no more, let friendship do
the rest. I have only to add, that if at any time
my little interest can be of service—but, hang it,
I'll make no promises—you know my interest is
yours at any time. No apologies, my friend, I'll
not be answered, it shall be so.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<P>Open, generous, unsuspecting man! He little

one; my torment, my persecution! What shall
I do! Love, friendship, an hopeless passion, a de∣serving
friend! Love, that has been my tormentor;
a friend, that has, perhaps, distressed himself, to
serve me. It shall be so. Yes, I will discard the
fondling hope from my bosom, and exert all my
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
influence in his favour. And yet to see her in the
possession of another!—Insupportable! But then
to betray a generous, trusting friend!—Worse,
worse! Yes, I'm resolved. Let me but be the in∣strument
of their happiness, and then quit a coun∣try,
where I must for ever despair of finding my
own.</P>

<P>Not a stick, madam—all's here. Yet I wish you

It's the worst luck in the world, in any thing but
white. I knew one Bett Stubbs, of our town, that
was married in red; and, as sure as eggs is eggs,
the bridegroom and she had a miff before morning.</P>

dropped at my door. "To muster Croaker, these,
with speed." Aye, aye, plain enough the direc∣tion:
all in the genuine incendiary spelling, and
as cramp as the devil. "With speed." O, con∣found
your speed. But let me read it once more.
<STAGE>(Reads.)</STAGE> "Muster Croaker as sone as yoew see this
leve twenty guineas at the bar of the Talboot tell
called for or yowe and yower experetion will be

gunpowder in every line of it. Blown up! murderous
dog! All blown up! Heavens! what have
I and my poor family done, to be all blown up!
<STAGE>(Reads.)</STAGE> "Our pockets are low, and money we must
have." Aye, there's the reason; they'll blow us
up, because they have got low pockets. <STAGE>(Reads.)</STAGE>
"It is but a short time you have to confider; for if
this takes wind, the house will quickly be all of
a flame." Inhuman monsters! blow us up, and
then burn us. The earthquake at Lisbon was but a
bonfire to it. <STAGE>(Reads.)</STAGE> "Make quick dispatch,

little Cupid together; I'm so frightened, I scarce
knew whether I fit, stand, or go. Perhaps this

search the house. Look into the cellars, to
see if there be any combustibles below; and above,
in the apartments, that no matches be thrown in at
the windows. Let all the fires be put out, and let
the engine be drawn out in the yard, to play upon
the house in case of necessity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND, alone.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can he mean by all this? Yet, why should
I inquire, when he alarms us in this manner almost
every day! But Honeywood has desired an inter∣view
with me in private. What can he mean? or,
rather, what means this palpitation at his approach?
It is the first time he ever shewed any thing in his
conduct that seemed particular. Sure he cannot
mean to—but he's here.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HONEYWOOD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I presumed to solicit this interview, madam, be∣fore
I left town, to be permitted—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Leaving town, Sir?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam; perhaps the kingdom. I have pre∣sumed,
I say, to desire the favour of this interview,—in
order to disclose something which our long
friendship prompts. And yet my fears—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>His fears! What are his fears to mine? <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
We have indeed been long acquainted, Sir; very
long. If I remember, our first meeting was at the
French ambassador's.—Do you recollect how you
were pleased to rally me upon my complexion
there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, madam: I presumed to reprove you
for painting: but your warmer blushes soon con∣vinced
the company, that the colouring was all from
nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you only meant it, in your good-natured
way, to make me pay a compliment to myself. In
the same manner you danced that night with the
most aukward woman in company, because you saw
nobody else would take her out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and was rewarded the next night, by danc∣ing
with the finest woman in company, whom every
body wished to take out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, if you thought so then, I fear your
judgment has since corrected the errors of a first im∣pression.
We generally shew to most advantage at
first. Our sex are like poor tradesmen, that put all
their best goods to be seen at the windows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first impression, madam, did indeed deceive
me. I expected to find a woman with all the faults
of conscious flattered beauty. I expected to find, her
vain and insolent. But every day has since taught
me that it is possible to possess sense without pride,
and beauty without affectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is a style very unusual with Mr. Ho∣neywood;
and I should be glad to know why he thus
attempts to encrease that vanity, which his own les∣sons
have taught me to despise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask pardon, madam. Yet, from our long friend∣ship,
I presumed I might have some right to offer,
without offence, what you may refuse without of∣fending.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir! I beg you'd reflect; though, I fear, I shall
scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours;
yet you may be precipitate: consider, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own my rashness; but, as I plead the cause of
friendship, of one who loves—Don't be alarmed,
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
madam—who loves you with the most ardent passion,
whose whole happiness is placed in you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, Sir, I shall never find whom you mean, by
this description of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, madam, it but too plainly points him out;
though he should be too humble himself to urge his
pretensions, or you too modest to understand them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; it would be affectation any longer to pre∣tend
ignorance; and I will own, Sir, I have long
been prejudiced in his favour. It was but natural
to wish to make his heart mine, as he seemed him∣self
ignorant of its value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see she always loved him. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> I find, ma∣dam,
you're already sensible of his worth, his pas∣sion.
How happy is my friend, to be the favourite
of one with such sense to distinguish merit, and such
beauty to reward it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friend, Sir! What friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My best friend—my friend Mr. Lofty, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he, madam. He is, indeed, what your
warmest wishes might have formed him. And to
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
his other qualities, he adds that of the most passio∣nate
regard for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazement!—No more of this, I beg you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see your confusion, madam, and know how to
interpret it. And, since I so plainly read the lan∣guage
of your heart, shall I make my friend happy,
by communicating your sentiments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me; I must; I know you desire it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss RICHLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood, let me tell you, that you wrong
my sentiments and yourself. When I first applied
to your friendship, I expected advice and assistance;
but, now, Sir, I see that it is vain to expect hap∣piness
from him, who has been so bad an oeconomist
of his own; and that I must disclaim his friendship,
who ceases to be a friend to himself.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is this! she has confessed she loved him, and
yet she seemed to part in displeasure. Can I have
done any thing to reproach myself with? No: I
believe not: yet, after all, these things should not
be done by a third person; I should have spared her
confusion. My friendship carried me a little too
far.</P>

<P>And so your good humour advises me to part with

a piece of my mind, I'd sooner part with my wife.
Here's Mr. Honeywood, see what he'll say to it.
My dear Honeywood, look at this incendiary letter
dropped at my door. It will freeze you with terror;
and yet lovey here can read it—can read it, and
laugh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and so will Mr. Honeywood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he does, I'll suffer to be hanged the next mi∣nute
in the rogue's place, that's all.</P>
</SP>

<P>Speak, Mr. Honeywood; is there any thing more
foolish than my husband's fright upon this occa∣sion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not become me to decide, madam; but
doubtless, the greatness of his terrors, now, will but
invite them to renew their villainy another time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, he'd be of my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir! do you maintain that I should lie down
under such an injury, and shew, neither by my tears,
or complaints, that I have something of the spirit of
a man in me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir. You ought to make the loudest
complaints, if you desire redress. The surest way
to have redress, is to be earnest in the pursuit of
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, whose opinion is he of now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't you think that laughing off our fears is
the best way!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the best, madam, few can say? but I'll
maintain it to be a very wise way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we're talking of the best. Surely the best
way is to face the enemy in the field, and not wait
till he plunders us in our very bed-chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, as to the best, that—that's a very wise
way too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can any thing be more absurd, than to dou∣ble
our distresses by our apprehensions, and put it
in the power of every low fellow, that can scrawl
ten words of wretched spelling, to torment us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, nothing more absurd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How! would it not be more absurd to despise the
rattle till we are bit by the snake?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, perfectly absurd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are of my opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you reject mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens forbid, madam! No, sure, no reasoning
can be more just than yours. We ought' certainly
to despise malice if we cannot oppose it, and not
make the incendiary's pen as fatal to our repose as
the highwayman's pistol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! then you think I'm quite right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plague of plagues, we can't be both right. I
ought to be sorry, or I ought to be glad. My hat
must be on my head, or my hat must be off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, in two opposite opinions, if one be
perfectly reasonable, the other can't be perfectly
right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why may not both be right, madam? Mr.
Croaker in earnestly seeking redress, and you in
waiting the event with good humour? Pray let me
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
see the letter again. I have it. This letter re∣quires
twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the
Talbot inn. If it be indeed an incendiary letter,
what if you and I, Sir, go there; and, when the
writer comes to be paid his expected booty, seize
him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROAKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, it's the very thing; the very
thing. While I walk by the door, you shall plant
yourself in ambush near the bar; burst out upon the
miscreant like a masqued battery; extort a confes∣sion
at once, and so hang him up by surprise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HONEYWOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I would not chuse to exercise too much
severity. It is my maxim, Sir, that crimes gene∣rally
punish themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, but we may upbraid him a little, I sup∣pose?

set off from this two days ago for the same place.
The gentleman, for a taylor, was, to be sure, as
fine a spoken taylor, as ever blew froth from a full

<P>Why, let him, when we are out of his power. But
believe me, Olivia, yon have no great reason to
dread his resentment. His repining temper, as it
does no manner of injury to himself, so will it never
do harm to others. He only frets to keep himself
employed, and scolds for his private amusement.</P>

fix her for life in a convent, contrary to her incli∣nations.
Of this I was informed, upon my arrival
at Paris; and, as I had been once her father's friend,
I did all in my power to frustrate her guardian's
base intentions. I had even meditated to rescue her
from his authority, when your son stept in with more

calmness of my former follies, my vanity, my dissi∣pation,
my weakness. I will even confess, that,
among the number of my other presumptions, I had
the insolence to think of loving you. Yes, ma∣dam,
while I was pleading the passion of another,
my heart was tortur'd with its own. But it is over,
it was unworthy our friendship, and let it be for∣gotten.</P>

Yes, Sir, you are surprised to see me;
and I own that a desire of correcting your follies led
me hither. I saw, with indignation, the errors of a
mind that only sought applause from others; that
easiness of disposition, which, though inclined to
the right, had not courage to condemn the wrong.
I saw, with regret, those splendid errors, that still
took name from some neighbouring duty. Your
charity, that was but injustice; your benevolence,
that was but weakness; and your friendship, but
credulity. I saw, with regret, great talents, and
extensive learning, only employed to add sprightli∣ness
to error, and encrease your perplexities. I saw
your mind with a thousand natural charms: but,
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten
my pity for it's prostitution.</P>

<P>Cease to upbraid me, Sir: I have for some time
but too strongly felt the justice of your reproaches.
But there is one way still left me. Yes, Sir, I have
determined this very hour, to quit for ever a place
where I have made myself the voluntary slave of all;
and to seek among strangers that fortitude which
may give strength to the mind, and marshal all its
dissipated virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit me to
solicit favour for this gentleman; who, notwith∣standing
what has happened, has laid me under the
most signal obligations. Mr. Lofty—</P>

<P>Mr. Honeywood, I'm resolved upon a reforma∣tion,

was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him.
And, to prove that I design to speak truth for the
future, I must now assure you, that you owe your
late enlargement to another; as, upon my soul, I
had no hand in the matter. So now if any of the

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author, in expectation of an Epilogue from a friend at Oxford, deferred writing one himself till the very last hour. What is here offered, owes all it's success to the graceful manner of the actress who spoke it.</NOTE></HEAD>
<STAGE>SPOKEN BY
MRS. BULKLEY.</STAGE>
<L>AS puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure</L>
<L>To swear the pill, or drop, has wrought a cure;</L>
<L>Thus, on the stage, our play-wrights still depend</L>
<L>For Epilogues and Prologues on some friend,</L>
<L>Who knows each art of coaxing up the town,</L>
<L>And make full many a bitter pill go down.</L>
<L>Conscious of this, our bard has gone about,</L>
<L>And teaz'd each rhyming friend to help him out.</L>
<L>An Epilogue, things can't go on without it;</L>
<L>It could not fail, would you but set about it.</L>
<L>Young man, cries one, (a bard laid up in clover)</L>
<L>Alas, young man, my writing days are over;</L>
<L>Let boys play tricks, and kick the straw, not I;</L>
<L>Your brother doctor there, perhaps, may try.</L>

No, no, I've other contests to maintain;</L>
<L>To-night I head our troops at Warwick-lane.</L>
<L>Go, ask your manager—Who, me! Your pardon;</L>
<L>Those things are not our forte at Covent-garden.</L>
<L>Our author's friends, thus plac'd at happy distance,</L>
<L>Give him good words indeed, but no assistance.</L>
<L>As some unhappy wight, at some new play,</L>
<L>At the pit door stands elbowing away,</L>
<L>While oft, with many a smile, and many a shrug,</L>
<L>He eyes the centre, where his friends sit snug;</L>
<L>His simpering friends, with pleasure in their eyes,</L>
<L>Sinks as he sinks, and as he rises rise:</L>
<L>He nods, they nod; he cringes, they grimace;</L>
<L>But not a soul will budge to give him place.</L>
<L>Since then, unhelp'd, our bard must now conform</L>
<L>" To 'bide the pelting of this pitt'less storm,"</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY inscribing this slight performance to you, I
do not mean so much to compliment you as myself.
It may do me some honour to inform the public,
that I have lived many years in intimacy with you.
It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform
them that the greatest wit may be found in a charac∣ter,
without impairing the most unaffected piety.</P>
<P>I have, particularly, reason to thank you for your
partiality to this performance. The undertaking a
comedy, not merely sentimental, was very danger∣ous;
and Mr. Colman, who saw this piece in its
various stages, always thought it so. However, I
ventured to trust it to the public; and, though it
was necessarily delayed till late in the season, I have
every reason to be grateful. I am,</P>

<BYLINE>BY
DAVID GARRICK, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Enter Mr. Woodward, dressed in Black, and
holding a handkerchief to his Eyes.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>EXCUSE me, Sirs, I pray—I can't yet speak—</L>
<L>I'm crying now—and have been all the week.</L>
<L>" 'Tis not alone this mourning suit," good masters;</L>
<L>" I've that within"—for which there are no plasters!</L>
<L>Pray, would you know the reason why I'm crying?</L>
<L>The comic muse, long sick, is now a dying!</L>
<L>And if she goes, my tears will never stop;</L>
<L>For as a play'r, I can't squeeze out one drop:</L>
<L>I am undone, that's all—shall lose my bread—</L>
<L>I'd rather, but that's nothing—lose my head.</L>
<L>When the sweet maid is laid upon the bier,</L>
<L>Shuter and I shall be chief mourners here.</L>
<L>To her a mawkish drab of spurious breed,</L>
<L>Who deals in Sentimentals, will succeed!</L>
<L>Poor Ned and I are dead to all intents;</L>
<L>We can as soon speak Greek as Sentiments!</L>
<L>Both nervous grown, to keep our spirits up,</L>
<L>We now and then take down a hearty cup.</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="137"/>
What shall we do?—If Comedy forsake us!</L>
<L>They'll turn us out, and no one else will take us.</L>
<L>But, why can't I be moral?—Let me try—</L>
<L>My heart thus pressing—fix'd my face and eye—</L>
<L>With a sententious look, that nothing means,</L>
<L>(Faces are blocks, in sentimental scenes)</L>
<L>Thus I begin—" All is not gold that glitters,</L>
<L>" Pleasures seem sweet, but prove a glass of bitters,</L>
<L>" When ign'rance enters, folly is at hand:</L>
<L>" Learning is better far than house and land.</L>
<L>" Let not your virtue trip, who trips may stumble,</L>
<L>" And virtue is not virtue, if she tumble."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I give it up—morals won't do for me;</L>
<L>To make you laugh, I must play tragedy.</L>
<L>One hope remains—hearing the maid was ill,</L>
<L>A Doctor comes this night to shew his skill.</L>
<L>To cheer her heart, and give your muscles motion,</L>
<L>He, in Five Draughts prepar'd, presents a potion:</L>
<L>A kind of magic charm—for be assur'd,</L>
<L>Is you will swallow it, the maid is cur'd:</L>
<L>But desp'rate the Doctor, and her case is,</L>
<L>If you reject the dose, and make wry faces!</L>
<L>This truth he boasts, will boast it while he lives,</L>
<L>No pois'nous drugs are mix'd in what he gives.</L>
<L>Should he succeed, you'll give him his degree:</L>
<L>If not, within he will receive no fee!</L>
<L>The college you, must his pretensions back,</L>
<L>Pronounce him Regular, or dub him Quack.</L>

<STAGE>SCENE, a Chamber in an old-fashioned House.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. HARDCASTLE and Mr. HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I VOW, Mr. Hardcastle, you're very particular.
Is there a creature in the whole country, but our∣selves,
that does not take a trip to town now and
then, to rub off the rust a little? There's the two
Miss Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigsby, go
to take a month's polishing every winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and bring back vanity and affectation to last
them the whole year. I wonder why London can∣not
keep its own fools at home! In my time, the
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>
follies of the town crept slowly among us, but now
they travel faster than a stage-coach. Its fopperies
come down, not only as inside passengers, but in the
very basket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, your times were fine times, indeed; you
have been telling us of them for many a long year.
Here we live in an old rumbling mansion, that looks
for all the world like an inn, but that we never see
company. Our bell visitors are old Mrs. Oddfish,
the curate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame
dancing-master: and all our entertainment your old
stories of prince Eugene and the duke of Marylbo∣rough.
I hate such old-fashioned trumpery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I love it. I love every thing that's old: old
friends, old times, old manners, old books, old
wine; and, I believe, Dorothy, <STAGE>(taking her hand)</STAGE>
you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Hardcastle, you're for ever at your
Dorothy's and your old wife's. You may be a Dar∣by,
but I'll be no Joan, I promise you. I'm not
so old as you'd make me, by more than one good
year. Add twenty to twenty, and make money of
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see; twenty added to twenty, makes just
fifty and seven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="137" REF="141"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's false, Mr. Hardcastle: I was but twenty when
I was brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr.
Lumpkin, my first husband; and he's not come to
years of discretion yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever will, I dare answer for him. Aye, you
have taught him finely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune.
My son is not to live by his learning. I don't think
a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred
a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learning, quotha! A mere composition of tricks
and mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come,
Mr. Hardcastle, you must allow the boy a little hu∣mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd sooner allow him an horse-pond. If burning
the footmens shoes, frighting the maids, and worry∣ing
the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but
yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my
chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my
bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always
too sickly to do any good. A school would be his
<PB N="138" REF="142"/>
death. When he comes to be a little stronger, who
knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Latin for him! A cat and fiddle. No, no, the
alehouse and the stable are the only schools he'll
ever go to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we must not snub the poor boy now, for
I believe we shan't have him long among us. Any
body that looks in his face may see he's consump∣tive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, if growing too fat be one of the symptoms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He coughs sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm actually afraid of his lungs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And truly so am I; for he sometimes whoops like
a speaking trumpet— <STAGE>(Tony hallooing behind the
scenes)</STAGE>—O there he goes—A very consumptive fi∣gure,
truly.</P>

<P>You shan't venture out this raw evening, my

<P>Not so low neither. There's Dick Muggins the
exciseman, Jack Slang the horse doctor, little Ami∣nadab
that grinds the music box, and Tom Twist
that spins the pewter platter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my dear, disappoint them for one night at
least.</P>
</SP>

mind; but I can't abide to disappoint myself.</P>

<STAGE>[Exit, hauling her out.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE, solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there goes a pair that only spoil each other.
But is not the whole age in a combination to drive
sense and discretion out of doors? There's my pret∣ty
darling Kate; the fashions of the times have al∣most
infected her too. By living a year or two in
town, she is as fond of gauze, and French frippery,
as the best of them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Miss HARDCASTLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blessings on my pretty innocence! drest out as
usual, my Kate. Goodness! What a quantity of
superfluous silk hast thou got about thee, girl! I
could never teach the fools of this age, that the
indigent world could be cloathed out of the trim∣mings
of the vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know our agreement, Sir. You allow me
the morning to receive and pay visits, and to dress
in my own manner; and in the evening, I put on
my housewife's dress to please you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, remember I insist on the terms of our agre∣ment;
and, by the bye, I believe I shall have oc∣casion
to try your obedience this very evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest, Sir, I don't comprehend your mean∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, to be plain with you, Kate, I expect the
young gentleman I have chosen to be your busband
from town this very day. I have his father's letter,
in which he informs me his son is set out, and that
he intends to follow himself shortly after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! I wish I had known something of this
before. Bless me, how shall I behave? It's a thou∣sand
to one I shan't like him; our meeting will be
so formal, and so like a thing of business, that I shall
find no room for friendship or esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, child, I'll never controul your
choice; but Mr. Marlow, whom I have pitched
upon, is the son of my old friend, Sir Charles Mar∣low,
of whom you have heard me talk so often.
The young gentleman has been bred a scholar, and
is designed for an employment in the service of his
country. I am told he's a man of an excellent un∣derstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I shall like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young and brave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure I shall like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And very handsome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, say no more, <STAGE>(kissing his hand)</STAGE> he's
mine, I'll have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, to crown all, Kate, he's one of the most
bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh! you have frozen me to death again. That
word reserved, has undone all the rest of his accom∣plishments.
A reserved lover, it is said, always
makes a suspicious husband,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, modesty seldom resides in a
breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues. It
was the very feature in his character that first struck
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must: have more striking features to catch me,
I promise you. However, if he be so young, so
handsome, and so every thing, as you mention, I
believe he'll do still I think I'll have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Kate, but there is still an obstacle. It's
more than an even wager, he may not have you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, why will you mortisy one so?—Well,
if he refuses, instead of breaking my heart
at his indifference, I'll only break my glass for its
flattery. Set my cap to some newer fashion, and
look out for some less difficult admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravely resolved! In the mean time I'll go pre∣pare
the servants for his reception; as we seldom
see company, they want as much training as a com∣pany
of recruits, the first day's muster.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE, sola.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lud, this news of papa's puts me all in a flutter.
Young, handsome; these he put last? but I put
them foremost. Sensible, good-natured; I like all
that. But then reserved, and sheepish, that's much
against him. Yet can't he be cured of his timidity,
by being taught to be proud of his wife? Yes, and
can't I—But I vow I'm disposing of the husband,
before I have secur'd the lover.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad you're come, Neville, my dear. Tell
me, Constance, how do I look this evening? Is
there any thing whimsical about me? Is it one of
my well looking days, child? am I in face to∣day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, my dear. Yet now I look again—bless
me!—sure no accident has happened among the ca∣nary
birds or the gold fishes. Has your brother or
the cat been medling? or has the last novel been too
moving?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; nothing of all this. I have been threatened—I
can scarce get it out—I have been threatened with
a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his name—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Is Marlow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The son of Sir Charles Marlow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I live, the most intimate friend of Mr. Hast∣ings,
my admirer. They are never asunder. I
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>

town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a very singular character, I assure you.
Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the
modestest man alive; but his acquaintance give him
a very different character among creatures of another
stamp: you understand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An odd character, indeed. I shall never be able
to manage him. What shall I do? Pshaw, think
no more of him, but trust to occurrences for success.
But how goes on your own affair, my dear? has
my mother been courting you for my brother Tony,
as usual?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just come from one of our agreeable tête∣a-têtes.
She has been saying a hundred tender
things, and setting off her pretty monster as the very
pink of perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her partiality is such, that she actually thinks
him so. A fortune like yours is no small tempta∣tion.
Besides, as she has the sole management of
it, I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it
go out of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fortune like mine, which chiefly consists in
jewels, is no such mighty temptation. But at any
rate if my dear Hastings be but constant, I make no
doubt to be too hard for her at last. However, I let
her suppose that I am in love with her son, and me
never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon
another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good brother holds out stoutly. I could al∣most
love him for hating you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a good-natured creature at bottom, and I'm
sure would wish to see me married to any body but
himself. But my aunt's bell rings for our after∣noon's
walk round the improvements. Allons!
Courage is necessary as our affairs are critical.</P>

rich, and going to leave off business; so he wants
to be thought a gentleman, saving your presence,

<P>You must not be so talkative, Diggory. You

<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The usual fate of a large mansion. Having first
ruined the master by good housekeeping, it at last
comes to levy contributions as an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you say, we passengers are to be taxed to pay
all these fineries. I have often seen a good side∣board,

put in the bill, inflame a reckoning con∣foundedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Travellers, George, must pay in all places. The
only difference is, that in good inns, you pay
dearly for luxuries; in bad inns, you are fleeced and starved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have lived pretty much among them. In
truth, I have been often surprised, that you who
have seen so much of the world, with your natural
good sense, and your many opportunities, could ne∣ver
yet acquire a requite share of assurance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Englishman's malady. But tell me, George,
where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould I have learned that assurance you talk
<PB N="162" REF="166"/>
of? My life has been chiefly spent in a college, or
an inn, in seclusion from that lovely part of the
creation that chiefly teach men confidence. I don't
know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a
single modest woman—except my mother—But a∣mong
females of another class you know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, among them you are impudent enough of

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are of <HI>us,</HI> you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the company of women of reputation I ne∣ver
saw such an idiot, such a trembler; you look
for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of
stealing out of the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, man, that's because I do want to steal out of
the room. Faith, I have often formed a resolution
to break the ice, and rattle away at any rate. But
I don't know how, a single glance from a pair of
fine eyes has totally overset my resolution. An im∣pudent
fellow may counterfeit modesty, but I'll be
hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impu∣dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you could but say half the fine things to them
that I have heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="167"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, George, I can't say fine things to them;
they freeze, they petrify me. They may talk of a
comet, or a burning mountain, or some such baga∣telle.
But to me, a Modest woman, drest out in all
her finery, is the most tremendous object of the
whole creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! At this rate, man, how can you
ever expect to marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, unless, as among kings and princes, my
bride were to be courted by proxy. If, indeed,
like an eastern bridegroom, one were to be intro∣duced
to a wife he never saw before, it might be
endured. But to go through all the terrors of a
formal courtship, together with the episode of aunts,
grandmothers, and cousins, and at last to blurt out
the broad staring question of, madam, will you mar∣ry
me? No, no, that's a strain much above me, I
assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity you. But how do you intend behaving to
the lady you are come down to visit at the request of
your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I behave to all other ladies. Bow very low.
Answer yes, or no, to all her demands—But for the
rest, I don't think I shall venture to look in her face,

you are sure of a reception, and let honour do the
rest.</P>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Marlow! But I'll suppress the emotion.
Were I a wretch, meanly seeking to carry off a for∣tune,
you should be the last man in the world I

person is all I ask, and that is mine, both from her
deceased father's consent, and her own inclination.</P>

<P>Mr. Marlow—Mr. Hastings—gentlemen—pray
be under no constraint in this house. This is Li∣berty-hall,
gentlemen. You may do just as you
please here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, George, if we open the campaign too
fiercely at first, we may want ammunition before it
<PB N="166" REF="170"/>
is over. I think to reserve the embroidery to secure
a retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your talking of a retreat, Mr. Marlow, puts me
in wind of the duke of Marlborough, when we
went to besiege Denain. He first summoned the
garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think the <HI>ventre dór</HI> waistcoat will do
with the plain brown?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He first summoned the garrison, which might con∣sist
of about five thousand men—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not: brown and yellow mix but very
poorly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, gentlemen, as I was telling you, he sum∣moned
The garrison, which might consist of about
five thousand men—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The girls like finery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which might consist of about five thousand men,
well appointed with stores ammunition, and other
implements of war. Now, says the duke of Marl∣borough
to George Brooks, that stood next to him—you
must have heard of George Brooks—I'll
<PB N="167" REF="171"/>
pawn my dukedom, says he, but I take that garri∣son
without spilling a drop of blood. So—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my good friend, if you gave us a glass of
punch in the mean time, it would help us to carry
on the siege with vigour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Punch, Sir! <STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> This is the most unaccount∣able
kind of modesty I ever met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, punch. A glass of warm punch, after
our journey, will be comfortable. This is Liber∣ty-hall,
you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's cup, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> So this fellow, in his Liberty-hall, will
only let us have just what he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Taking the cup)</STAGE> I hope you'll find it to your
mind. I have prepared it with my own hands, and
I believe you'll own the ingredients are tolerable.
Will you be so good as to pledge me, Sir? Here,
Mr. Marlow, here is to our better acquaintance. <STAGE>(Drinks.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> A very impudent fellow this! but he's a
character and I'll humour him a little. Sir, my ser∣vice
to you. <STAGE>(Drinks.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="168" REF="172"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> I see this fellow wants to give us his com∣pany,
and forgets that he's an innkeeper, before he
has learned to be a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the excellence of your cup, my old friend,
I suppose you have a good deal of business in this
part of the country. Warm work, now and then,
at elections, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I have long given that work over. Since
our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing
each other, there is no business 'for us that sell ale.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, then you have no turn for politics I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least. There was a time, indeed, I
fretted myself about the mistakes of government,
like other people; but finding myself every day
grow more angry, and the government growing no
better, I left it to mend itself. Since that, I no
more trouble my head about Heyder Ally or Ally
Cawn, than about Ally Croaker. Sir, my service
to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that with eating above stairs, and drinking be∣low,
with receiving your friends within, and amus∣ing
them without, you lead a good pleasant bustling
life of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="169" REF="173"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do stir about a great deal, that's certain. Half
the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very
parlour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(After drinking)</STAGE> And you have an argument in
your cup, old gentleman, better than any in West∣minster-hall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, young gentleman, that, and a little philo∣sophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Well, this is the first time I ever heard of
an innkeeper's philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, like an experienced general, you attack
them on every quarter. If you find their reason ma∣nageable,
you attack it with your philosophy; if
you find they have no reason, you attack them with
this. Here's your health, my philosopher. <STAGE>(Drinks.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good, very good, thank you; ha! ha! Your
generalship puts me in mind of prince Eugene,
when he fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade.
You shall hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Instead of the battle of Belgrade, I believe it's
almost time to talk about supper. What has your
philosophy got in the house for supper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="170" REF="174"/>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>For supper, Sir! <STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Was ever such a request
to a man in his own house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, supper, Sir; I begin to feel an appe∣tite.
I shall make dev'lish work to-night in the
larder, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes be∣held.
<STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> Why really, Sir, as for supper I
can't well tell. My Dorothy, and the cook-maid,
settle these things between them. I leave these kind
of things entirely to then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yon do, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely. By-the-bye, I believe they are in ac∣tual
consultation upon what's for supper this mo∣ment
in the kitchen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I beg they'll admit me as one of their pri∣vy
council. It's a way I have got. When I travel,
I always chuse to regulate my own supper. Let the
cook be called. No offence I hope, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no, Sir, none in the least; yet I don't know
how: our Bridget, the cook-maid, is not very com∣municative
upon these occasions. Should we send
for her, she might scold us all out of the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="171" REF="175"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let's see your list of the larder then. I ask it as
a favour. I always match my appetite to my bill
of fare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To Hardcastle, who looks at them with surprise)</STAGE>
Sir, he's very right, and it's my way too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have a right to command here. Here,
Roger, bring us the bill of fare for to-night's sup∣per.
I believe it's drawn out. Your manner, Mr.
Hastings, puts me in mind of my uncle, colonel
Wallop. It was a saying of his, that no man was
sure of his supper till he had eaten it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> All upon the high ropes! His uncle a
colonel! We shall soon hear of his mother being a
justice of peace. But let's hear the bill of fare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Perusing)</STAGE> What's here? For the first course; for
the second course; for the desert. The devil, Sir,
do you think we have brought down the whole
joiners company, or the corporation of Bedford, to
eat up such a supper? Two or three little things,
clean and comfortable, will do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, let's hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="172" REF="176"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Reading)</STAGE> For the first course at the top, a pig,
and pruin sauce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn your pig, I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And damn your pruin sauce, say I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, gentlemen, to men that are hungry, pig,
with pruin sauce, is very good eating.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the bottom, a calve's tongue and brains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let your brains be knock'd out, my good Sir; I
don't like them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or you may clap them on a plate by themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Their impudence confounds me. <STAGE>(To
them)</STAGE> Gentlemen, you are my guests, make what
alterations you please. Is there any thing else you
wish to retrench or alter, gentlemen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Item. A pork pye, a boiled rabbit and sausages,
a Florentine, a shaking pudding, and a dish of tiff—taff—taffety
cream!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confound your made dishes, I shall be as much
at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow din∣ner
<PB N="173" REF="177"/>
at the French ambassador's table. I'm for plain
eating.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry, gentlemen, that I have nothing you
like, but if there be any thing you have a particular
fancy to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, Sir, your bill of fare is so exquisite,
that any one part of it is full as good as another.
Send us what you please. So much for supper.
And now to see that our beds are air'd, and proper∣ly
taken care of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I entreat you'll leave all that to me. You shall
not stir a step.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave that to you! I protest, Sir, you must ex∣cuse
me, I always look to these things myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must insist, Sir, you'll make yourself easy on
that head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see I'm resolved on it. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> A very trou∣blesome
fellow this, as ever I met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I'm resolved at least to attend you.
<STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> This may be modern modesty, but I never
saw any thing look so like old-fashioned impudence.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exeunt <HI>Marlow</HI> and <HI>Hardcastle.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<PB N="174" REF="178"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS, solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow trou∣blesome.
But who can be angry at those assiduities
Which are meant to please him? Ha! what do I
see? Miss Neville, by all that's happy!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Miss NEVILLE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Hastings! To what unexpected good
fortune? to what accident, am I to ascribe this hap∣py
meeting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather let me ask the same question, as I could
never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at
an inn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An inn! sure you mistake! my aunt, my guardi∣an,
lives here. What could induce you to think
this hóuse an inn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend, Mr. Marlow, with whom I came
down, and I, have been sent here as to an inn, I
assure you. A young fellow whom we accidentally
met at a house hard by directed us hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's
tricks, of whom you have heard me talk so often,
ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="175" REF="179"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He whom your aunt intends for you? he of whom
I have such just apprehensions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nothing to fear from him, I assure you.
You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he de∣spises
me. My aunt knows it too, and has under∣taken
to court me for him, and actually begins to
think she has made a conquest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou dear dissembler! You must know, my
Constance, I have just seized this happy oppor∣tunity
of my friend's visit here to get admittance
into the family. The horses that carried us down
are now fatigued with their journey, but they'll
soon be refreshed; and then, if my dearest girl
will trust in her faithful Hastings, we shall soon be
landed, in France, where even among slaves the laws
of marriage are respected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have Often told you, that, though ready to obey
you, I yet should leave my little fortune behind
with reluctance. The greatest part of it was left
me by my uncle, the India director, and chiefly
consists in jewels. I have been for some time per∣suading
my aunt to let me wear them. I fancy I'm
very near succeeding. The instant they are put
into my possession you shall find me ready to make
them and myself yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="176" REF="180"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perish the baubles! Your person is all I desire.
In the mean time, my friend Marlow must not be
let into his mistake. I know the strange reserve of
his temper is such, that if abruptly informed of it,
he would instanly quit die house before our plan
was ripe for execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall we keep him in the deception?
Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking;
what if we still continue to deceive him?—This,
this way—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[They confer.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter MARLOW.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The assiduities of these good people teize me be∣yond
bearing. My host seems to think it ill man∣ners
to leave me alone, and so he claps not only
himself but his old-fashioned wife on my back.
They talk of coming to sup with us too; and then,
I suppose, we are to run the gauntlet through all
the rest of the family.—What have we got here!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Charles! Let me congratulate you!—The
most fortunate accident!—Who do you think
is just alighted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot guess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="177" REF="181"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our mistresses, boy, Miss Hardcastle and Miss Ne∣ville.
Give me leave to introduce Miss Constance
Neville to your acquaintance. Happening to dine
in the neighbourhood, they called, on their return,
to take fresh horses here. Miss Hardcastle has just
stept into the next room, and will be back in an
instant. Wasn't it lucky? eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> I have been mortified enough of all con∣science,
and here comes something to complete my
embarrassment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but was'nt it the most fortunate thing in
the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes. Very fortunate—a most joyful en∣counter—But
our dresses, George, you know are in
disorder—What if we should postpone the happiness
'till to-morrow?—To-morrow at her own house—It
will be every bit as convenient—and rather more
respectful—To-morrow let it be. <STAGE>[Offering to go.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Sir. Your ceremony will displease
her. The disorder of your dress will shew the ar∣dour
of your impatience. Besides, she knows you
are in the house, and will permit you to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="178" REF="182"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! the devil! how shall I support it? hem!
hem! Hastings, you must not go. You are to as∣sist
me, you know. I shall be confoundedly ridicu∣lous.
Yet, hang it! I'll take courage. Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, man! it's but the first plunge, and all's
over. She's but a woman, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And of all women, she that I dread most to en∣counter!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Miss HARDCASTLE, as returned from
walking, a bonnet, &amp;c.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS, introducing them.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Hardcastle, Mr. Marlow. I'm proud of
bringing two persons of such merit together, that
only want to know, to esteem each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Now, for meeting my modest gentleman
with a demure face, and quite in his own manner.
<STAGE>(After a pause, in which be appears very uneasy and
disconcerted.)</STAGE> I'm glad of your safe arrival, Sir—I'm
told you had some accidents by the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a few, madam. Yes, we had some. Yes,
madam, a good many accidents, but should be sorry—madam—or
rather glad of any accidents—that
are so agreeably concluded. Hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="179" REF="183"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> You never spoke better in your whole
life. Keep it up, and I'll insure you the victory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid you flatter, Sir. You that have seen
so much of the finest company can find little enter∣tainment
in an obscure corner of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Gathering courage)</STAGE> I have lived, indeed, in the
world, madam; but I have kept very little com∣pany.
I have been but an observer upon life, ma∣dam,
while others were enjoying it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that, I am told, is the way to enjoy it at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> Cicero never spoke better. Once more,
and you are confirmed in assurance for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> Hem! stand by me then, and when
I'm down, throw in a word or two to set me up
again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An observer, like you, upon life, were, I fear,
disagreeably employed, since you must have had
much more to censure than to approve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, madam. I was always willing to be
amused. The folly of most people is rather an ob∣ject
of mirth than uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="180" REF="184"/>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> Bravo, bravo. Never spoke so well in
your whole life. Well! Miss Hardcastle, I see that
you and Mr. Marlow are going to be very good
company. I believe our being here will but em∣barrass
the interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Mr. Hastings. We like your
company of all things. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> Zounds! George,
sure you won't go? how can you leave us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our presence will but spoil conversation. so we'll
retire to the next room. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> Yon don't consi∣der,
man, that we are to manage a little tête-à-tête
of our own.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(After a pause</STAGE> I But you have not been wholly
an observer, I presume, Sir: the ladies I should
hope have employed some part of your addresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Relapsing into timidity)</STAGE> Pardon me, madam,
I—I—I—as yet have studied—only—to—deserve
them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that, some say, is the very worst way to ob∣tain
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so madam. But I love to converse only
with the more grave and sensible part Of the sex.—But
I'm afraid I grow tiresome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="181" REF="185"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Sir; there is nothing I like so much
as grave conversation myself; I could hear it for
ever. Indeed I have often been surprised how a
man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy
pleasures, where nothing reaches the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's—a disease—of the mind, madam. In
the variety of tastes there must be some who want∣ing
a relish—for—um—a—um.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Sir. There must be some, who
wanting a relish for refined pleasures, pretend to de∣spise
what they are incapable of tasting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>My meaning, madam, but infinitely better ex∣pressed.
And I can't help observing—a—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Who could ever suppose this fellow im∣pudent
upon such occasions. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> You were
going to observe, Sir—</P>

<P>I was observing, madam—I protest, madam, I
forget what I was going to observe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> I vow and so do I. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> You were
observing, Sir, that in this age of hypocrisy some∣thing
about hypocrisy, Sir.</P>

<P>Yes, madam. In this age of hypocrisy there are

<P>I understand you perfectly, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Egad! and that's more than I do myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean that in this hypocritical age there are
few that do not condemn in public what they prac∣tise
in private, and think they pay every debt to
virtue when they praise it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, madam; those who have most virtue in
their mouths, have least of it in their bosoms. But
I'm sure I tire you, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Sir; there's something so agree∣able
and spirited in your manner, such life and
force—pray, Sir, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam. I was saying—that there are
some occasions—when a total want of courage,
madam, destroys all the—and puts us—upon
a—a—a—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you entirely, a want of courage upon
some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance
<PB N="183" REF="187"/>
and betrays us when we most want to excel. I beg

<P>Ha! ha! ha! Was there ever such a sober senti∣mental
interview? I'm certain he scarce look'd in
my face the whole time. Yet the fellow, but for
his unaccountable bashfulness, is pretty well too.
He has good sense, but then so buried in his fears,
that it fatigues one more than ignorance. If I
could teach him a little confidence, it would be do∣ing
somebody that I know of a piece of service.
But who is that somebody?—That, faith, is a ques∣tion
I can scarce answer.</P>

<P>Aye, but I know what sort of a relation you want

<P>Well! I vow, Mr. Hastings, you are very enter∣taining.
There's nothing in the world I love to
talk of so much as London, and the fashions, though
I was never there myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never there! You amaze me! From your air

your life either at Ranelagh, St. James's, or Tower
Wharf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir, you're only pleased to say so. We
country persons can have no manner at all. I'm in
love with the town, and that serves to raise me
<PB N="185" REF="189"/>
above some of our neighbouring rustics; but who
can have a manner, that has never seen the Panthe∣on,
the Grotto Gardens, the Borough, and such
places where the nobility chiefly resort? All I can
do, is to enjoy London at second-hand. I take care
to know every tête-à-tête from the scandalous ma∣gazine,
and have all the fashions, as they come out,
in a letter from the two Miss Rickets of Crooked∣lane.
Pray how do you like this head, Mr. Hast∣ings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extremely elegant and degagée, upon my word,
madam. your friseur is a Frenchman, I suppose?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow, since inoculation began, there is no such

dress a little particular, or one may escape in the

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, what signifies my dressing when I have such
a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr. Hardcastle:
all I can say will never argue down a single button
from his cloaths. I have often wanted him to
throw off his great flaxen wig, and where he was
bald, to plaister it over, like my Lord Pately, with powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, madam; for, as among the ladies
there are none ugly, so among the men there are
none old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you think his answer was? Why,
with his usual Gothic vivacity, he said I only want∣ed
him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tête
for my own wearing.</P>

<P>Intolerable! At your age you may wear what
you please, and it must become you.</P>

told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensu∣ing

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT could my old friend Sir Charles mean
by recommending his son as the modestest young
man in town? To me he appears the most impu∣dent
piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue.
He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fire∣side
already. He took off his boots in the parlour,
and desired me to see them taken care of. I'm de∣sirous
to know how his impudence affects my daugh∣ter.—She
will certainly be shocked at it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Kate, I see you have changed your dress
as I bid you; and yet, I believe, there was no great
occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find such a pleasure, Sir, in obeying your com∣mands,
that I take care to observe them without
ever debating their propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And yet, Kate, I sometimes give you some cause,
particularly when I recommended my modest gen∣tleman
to you as a lover to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You taught me to expect something extraordinary,
and I find the original exceeds the description.</P>

confounded all my faculties!</P>

world too!</P>
</SP>

<P>Then your first sight deceived you; for I think

Dawson was but a fool to him.</P>

<P>Surprising! He met me with a respectful bow, a
stammering voice, and a look fixed on the ground.</P>

<P>He met me with a loud voice, a lordly air, and a
familiarity that made my blood freeze again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He treated me with diffidence and respect; cen∣sured
the manners of the age; admired the pru∣dence
of girls that never laughed; tired me with
apologies for being tiresome; then left the room
with a bow, and, "madam, I would not for the
world detain you."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life be∣fore.
Asked twenty questions, and never, waited
<PB N="197" REF="201"/>
for an answer, interrupted my best remarks with
some, silly pun, and when I was in my best story of
the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, he
asked if I had not a good hand at making punch.
Yes, Kate, he asked your father if he was a maker
of punch.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In one thing then we are agreed—to reject him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. But upon conditions. For if you should
find him less impudent, and I more presuming; if
you find him more respectful, and I more importu∣nate—I
don't know—the fellow is well enough
for a man—Certainly we don't meet many such at a
horse race in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we should find him so—But that's impossible.
The first appearance has done my business. I'm
seldom deceived in that.</P>

<P>And yet there may be many good qualities under
that first appearance.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her

sense, and a genteel figure for every virtue.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I no longer know my own house. It's turned all
topsey-turvey. His servants have got drunk alrea∣dy.
I'll bear it no longer, and yet, from my respect

your servant. I'm your very humble servant.</P>

son, Sir. I hope you think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="222" REF="226"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do from my soul, Sir. I don't want much in∣treaty.
I generally make my father's son welcome
wherever he goes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you do, from my soul, Sir. But though
I say nothing to your own conduct, that of your ser∣vants
is unsufferable. Their manner of drinking
is setting a very bad example in this house, I assure
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest, my very good Sir, that is no fault of
mine. If they don't drink as they ought they are
to blame. I ordered them not to spare the cellar.
I did, I assure you. <STAGE>(To the side scene)</STAGE> Here, let
one of my servants come up. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> My positive
directions were, that as I did not drink myself, they
should make up for my deficiencies below.</P>

<P>Then they had your orders for what they do! I'm
satisfied!</P>

of themselves.</P>

<P>You, Jeremy! Come forward, sirrah! What

and call for what you thought fit, for the good of
the house?</P>

<P>Please your honour, liberty and Fleet-street for
ever! Though I'm but a servant, I'm as good as
another man. I'll drink for no man before supper,
Sir, dammy! Good liquor will sit upon a good
supper, but a good supper will not sit upon—hiccup—upon
my conscience, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, my old friend, the fellow is as drunk as
he can possibly be. I don't know what you'd have
more; unless you'd have the poor devil soused in a

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! he'll drive me distracted if I contain
myself any longer. Mr. Marlow. Sir; I have
submitted to your insolence for more than four hours,
and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end.
I'm now resolved to be master here, Sir, and I de∣sire
that you and your drunken pack may leave my
house directly.</P>
</SP>

<P>Leave your house!—Sure you jest, my good

you.</P>

<P>Sure you cannot be serious? at this time o'night,

<P>I tell you, Sir, I'm serious? and, now that my
passions are rouzed, I say this house is mine, Sir;
this house is mine, and I command you to leave it
directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! A puddle in a storm. I shan't
stir a step, I assure you. <STAGE>(In a serious tone)</STAGE> This,
your house, fellow! It's my house. This is my
house. Mine, while I chuse to stay. What right
have you to bid me to leave this house, Sir? I never
met with such impudence, curse me, never in my
whole life before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I, confound me if ever I did. To come to
my house, to call for what he likes, to turn me out
of my own chair, to insult the family, to order his
servants to get drunk, and then to tell me "This
house is mine, Sir." By all that's impudent it
makes me laugh. Ha! ha! ha! Pray, Sir, <STAGE>(ban∣tering)</STAGE>
as you take the house, what think you of
taking the rest of the furniture? There's a pair of
silver candlesticks, and there's a fire-screen, and
<PB N="225" REF="229"/>
here's a pair of brazen nosed bellows, perhaps you
may take a fancy to them?</P>

<P>Young man, young man, from your father's let∣ter

<P>How's this! Sure I have not mistaken the house!
Every thing looks like an inn. The servants cry,
coming. The attendance is aukward; the bar-maid
too to attend us. But she's here, and will further
inform me. Whither so fast, child? A word with
you.</P>

<P>Pray, child, answer me one question. What are
you, and what may your business in this house
be?</P>

<P>A relation of the family, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<P>What, a poor relation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir. A poor relation appointed to keep the
keys, and to see that the guests want nothing in my
power to give them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, you act as the bar-maid of this inn.</P>
</SP>

<P>Inn. O law—What brought that in your head?
One of the best families in the county keep an
inn! Ha! ha! ha! old Mr. Hardcastle's house
an inn!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Hardcastle's house! Is this house Mr. Hard∣castle's
house, child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, sure. Whose else should it be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then all's out, and I have been damnably im∣posed
on. O, confound my stupid head, I shall be
laugh'd at over the whole town. I shall be stuck up
in caricatura in all the print-shops. The <HI>Dullissimo
Maccaroni.</HI> To mistake this house of all others for
an inn, and my father's old friend for an inn-keeper!
What a swaggering puppy must he take me for?
What a silly puppy do I find myself? There again,
may I be hanged, my dear, but I mistook you for
the bar-maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear me! dear me! I'm sure there's nothing in
my behaviour to put me upon a level with one of
that stamp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, my dear, nothing. But I was in for a
list of blunders, and could not help making you a
subscriber. My stupidity saw every thing the wrong
way. I mistook your affiduity for assurance, and
<PB N="228" REF="232"/>
your simplicity for allurement. But its over—This
house I no more shew my face in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, I have done nothing to disoblige you.
I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman
who has been so polite, and said so many civil things
to me. I'm sure I should be sorry <STAGE>(pretending to cry)</STAGE>
if he left the family upon my account. I'm sure I
should be sorry, people said any thing amiss, since
I have no fortune but my character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> By Heaven, she weeps. This is the first
mark of tenderness I ever had from a modest woman,
and it touches me. <STAGE>(To her)</STAGE> Excuse me, my lovely
girl, you are the only part of the family I leave
with reluctance. But to be plain with you, the dif∣ference
of our birth, fortune and education, make
an honourable connection impossible: and I can
never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that
trusted in my honour, of bringing ruin upon one,
whose only fault was being too lovely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> Generous man! I now begin to admire
him. <STAGE>(To him)</STAGE> But I'm sure my family is as good
as Miss Hardcastle's, and though I'm poor, that's
no great misfortune to a contented mind, and, until
this moment, I never thought that it was bad to want
fortune.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why now, my pretty simplicity?</P>

<P>Because it puts me at a distance from one, that if
I had a thousand pound I would give it all to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> This simplicity bewitches me, so that if
I stay I'm undone. I must make one bold effort,
and leave her. <STAGE>(To her)</STAGE> Your partiality in my fa∣vour,
my dear, touches me most sensibly, and were
I to live for myself alone, I could easily fix my
choice. But I owe too much to the opinion of the
world, too much to the authority of a father, so
that—I can scarcely speak it—it affects me. Fare∣wel.</P>

<P>Mr. Hardcastle, as I'm alive! My fears blinded

<P>Sure, Dorothy, you have not lost your wits? So

<P>My dear Constance, why will you deliberate thus?
If we delay a moment, all is lost for ever. Pluck
up a little resolution, and we shall soon be out
of the reach of her malignity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find it impossible. My spirits are so sunk with
the agitations I have suffered, that I am unable to
face any new danger. Two or three years patience
will at last crown us with happiness.</P>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy.
Let us fly, my charmer. Let us date our happiness
from this very moment. Perish fortune! Love and
content will encrease what we possess beyond a mo∣narch's
revenue. Let me prevail?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mr. Hastings; no. Prudence once more
comes to my relief, and I will obey its dictates. In
the moment of passion, fortune may be despised, but
it ever produces a lasting repentance. I'm resolved
to apply to Mr. Hardcastle's compasion and justice
for redress.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But though he had the will, he has not the power
to relieve you.</P>

<P>What a situation am I in! If what you say ap∣pears,
I shall then find a guilty son. If what he

says be true, I shall then lose one, that, of all others,
I most wish'd for a daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am proud of your approbation, and to shew I
merit it, if you place yourselves as I directed, you
shall hear his explicit declaration. But he comes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though prepar'd for setting out, I come once
more to take leave, nor did I, till this moment,
know the pain I feel in the separation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(In her own natural manner)</STAGE> I believe these suffer∣ings
cannot be very great, Sir, which you can so ea∣sily
remove. A day or two longer, perhaps, might
lessen your uneasiness, by shewing the little value of
what you now think proper to regret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE> This girl every moment improves upon
me. <STAGE>(To her)</STAGE> It must not be, madam. I have al∣ready
trifled too long with my heart. My very
pride begins to submit to my passion. The disparity
of education and fortune, the anger of a parent, and
the contempt of my equals, begin to lose their
<PB N="259" REF="263"/>
weight; and nothing can restore me to myself, but
this painsul effort of resolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then go, Sir. I'll urge nothing more to detain
you. Though my family be as good as hers you
came down to visit, and my education, I hope, not
inferior, what are these advantages without equal
affluence? I must remain contented with the slight
approbation of imputed merit; I must have only the
mockery of your addresses, while all your serious
aims are fixed on fortune.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HARDCASTLE and Sir CHARLES from

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, behind this screen.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, make no noise. I'll engage my Kate
covers him with confusion at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heavens, madam, fortune was ever my smallest
consideration. Your beauty at first caught my eye;
for who could see that without emotion. But every
moment that I converse with you, steals in some
new grace, heightens the picture, and gives it
stronger expression. What at first seem'd rustic
plainness, now appears resin'd simplicity. What
<PB N="260" REF="264"/>
seem'd forward assurance, now strikes me as the re∣sult
of courageous innocence, and conscious virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can it mean? He amazes me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you how it would be. Hush!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now determined to stay, madam, and I have
too good an opinion of my father's discernment,
when he sees you, to doubt his approbation.</P>
<P>Miss HARDCASTLE.</P>
<P>No, Mr. Marlow, I will not, cannot detain you.
Do you think I could suffer a connexion, in which
there is the smallest room for repentance? Do you
think I would take the mean advantage of a tran∣sient
passion, to load you with confusion? Do you
think I could ever relish that happiness, which was
acquired by lessening yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all that's good, I can have no happiness but
what's in your power to grant me. Nor shall I ever
feel repentance, but in not having seen your merits
before. I will stay, even contrary to your wishes;
and though you should persist to shun me, I will
make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of
my past condust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I must entreat you'll desist. As our ac∣quaintance
began, so let it end, in indifference. I
<PB N="261" REF="265"/>
might have given an hour or two to levity; but se∣riously,
Mr. Marlow, do you think I could ever sub∣mit
to a connexion, where I must appear merce∣nary,
and you imprudent? do you think I could
ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure ad∣mirer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Kneeling)</STAGE> Does this look like security? Does
this look like confidence? No, madam, every mo∣ment
that shews me your merit, only serves to en∣crease
my diffidence and confusion. Here let me
continue—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can hold it no longer. Charles, Charles, how
hast thou deceived me! Is this your indifference,
your uninteresting conversation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your cold contempt; your formal interview.
What have you to say now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I'm all amazement! What can it mean!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It means that you can say and unsay things at
pleasure. That you can address a lady in private,
and deny it in public; that you have one story for
us, and another for my daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="262" REF="266"/>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daughter!—this lady your daughter!</P>

<P>Yes, Sir, my only daughter. My Kate, whose
else should she be?</P>

<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the devil!</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, that very identical tall squinting lady
you were pleased to take me for, <STAGE>(curtesying)</STAGE> she
that you addressed as the mild, modest, sentimental
man of gravity, and the bold forward agreeable
Rattle of the ladies club; ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, there's no bearing this; it's worse than
death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>In which of your characters, Sir, will you give
us leave to address you. As the faultering gentle∣man,
with looks on the ground, that speaks just to
be heard, and hates hypocrisy; or the loud confi∣dent
creature, that keeps it up with Mrs. Mantrap,
and old Miss Biddy Buckskin, till three in the
morning: ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, curse on my noisy head. I never attempted
to be impudent yet, that I was not taken down.
I must be gone.</P>

<P>By the hand of my body, but you shall not. I
see it was all a mistake, and I am rejoiced to find
it. You shall not, Sir, I tell you. I know she'll
forgive you. Won't you forgive him, Kate. We'll
all forgive you. Take courage, man.</P>

if your son, when of age, refuses to marry his cou∣sin,
her whole fortune is then at her own disposal.</P>

<L>WELL, having stoop'd to conquer with success,</L>

<L>Still as a bar-maid, I could wish it too,</L>
<L>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</L>
<L>And let me say, for all your resolution,</L>
<L>That pretty bar-maids have done execution.</L>
<L>Our life is all a play, compos'd to please,</L>
<L>" We have our exits and our entrances."</L>
<L>The first act shews the simple country maid,</L>
<L>Harmless and young, of every thing afraid;</L>
<L>Blushes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</L>
<L>" I hopes as how to give you satisfaction."</L>
<L>Her second act displays a livelier scene.—</L>
<L>Th' unblushing bar-maid of a country inn,</L>
<L>Who whisks about the house, at market caters,</L>
<L>Talks loud, coquets the guests, and scolds the waiters.</L>
<L>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</L>
<L>The chop-house toast of ogling <HI>connoisieurs.</HI></L>
<L>On 'squires and cits she there displays her arts,</L>
<L>And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts—</L>
<L><PB N="269" REF="273"/>
And as she smiles, her triumphs to compleat,</L>
<L>Even common councilmen forget to eat.</L>
<L>The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'squire,</L>
<L>And madam now begins to hold it higher;</L>
<L>Pretends to taste, at operas cries caro,</L>
<L>And quits her Nancy Dawson, for Che Faro.</L>
<L>Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,</L>
<L>Swims round the room, the Heinell of Cheapside:</L>
<L>Ogles and leers with artificial skill,</L>
<L>Till having lost in age the power to kill,</L>
<L>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</L>
<L>Such, through our lives, the eventful history—</L>
<L>The fifth and last act still remains for me.</L>
<L>The bar-maid now for your protection prays,</L>
<L>Turns female Barrister, and pleads for Bays.</L>
