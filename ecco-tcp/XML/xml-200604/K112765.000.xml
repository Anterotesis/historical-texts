<L>Throng'd around her magic Cell,</L>
<L>Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,</L>
<L>Possest beyond the Muse's Painting;</L>
<L>By turns they felt the glowing Mind,</L>
<L>Disturb'd, delighted, rais'd, refin'd.</L>
<L>Till once, 'tis said, when all were fir'd,</L>
<L>Fill'd with Fury, rapt, inspir'd,</L>
<L>From the supporting Myrtles round,</L>
<L>They snatch'd her Instruments of Sound,</L>
<L>And as they oft had heard a-part</L>
<L>Sweet Lessons of her forceful Art,</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="50"/>
Each, for Madness rul'd the Hour,</L>
<L>Would prove his own expressive Pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First <HI>Fear</HI> his Hand, its Skill to try,</L>
<L>Amid the Chords bewilder'd laid,</L>
<L>And back recoil'd he knew not why,</L>
<L>Ev'n at the Sound himself had made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next <HI>Anger</HI> rush'd, his Eyes on fire,</L>
<L>In Lightnings own'd his secret Stings,</L>
<L>In one rude Clash he struck the Lyre,</L>
<L>And swept with hurried Hand the Strings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With woful Measures wan <HI>Despair</HI></L>
<L>Low sullen Sounds his Grief beguil'd,</L>
<L>A solemn, strange, and mingled Air,</L>
<L>'Twas sad by Fits, by Starts 'twas wild.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Thou, O <HI>Hope,</HI> with Eyes so fair,</L>
<L>What was thy delightful Measure?</L>
<L>Still it whisper'd promis'd Pleasure,</L>
<L>And bad the lovely Scenes at distance hail!</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="51"/>
Still would Her Touch the Strain prolong,</L>
<L>And from the Rocks, the Woods, the Vale,</L>
<L>She call'd on Echo still thro' all the Song;</L>
<L>And where Her sweetest Theme She chose,</L>
<L>A soft responslve Voice was heard at ev'ry Close,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hope</HI> enchanted smil'd, and wav'd Her golden Hair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And longer had She sung,—but with a Frown,</L>
<L><HI>Revenge</HI> impatient rose,</L>
<L>He threw his blood-stain'd Sword in Thunder down,</L>
<L>And with a with'ring Look,</L>
<L>The War-denouncing Trumpet took,</L>
<L>And blew a Blast so loud and dread,</L>
<L>Were ne'er Prophetic Sounds so full of Woe.</L>
<L>And ever and anon he beat</L>
<L>The doubling Drum with furious Heat;</L>
<L>And tho' fometimes each dreary Pause between,</L>
<L>Dejected <HI>Pity</HI> at his Side,</L>
<L>Her Soul-subduing Voice applied,</L>
<L>Yet still He kept his wild unalter'd Mien,</L>
<L>While each strain'd Ball of Sight seem'd bursting from
his Head.</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="52"/>
Thy Numbers, <HI>Jealousy,</HI> to nought were fix'd,</L>
<L>Sad Proof of thy distressful State,</L>
<L>Of diff'ring Themes the veering Song was mix'd,</L>
<L>And now it courted <HI>Love,</HI> now raving call'd
on <HI>Hate.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Eyes up-rais'd, as one inspir'd,</L>
<L>Pale <HI>Melancholy</HI> sate retir'd,</L>
<L>And from her wild sequester'd Seat,</L>
<L>In Notes by Distance made more sweet,</L>
<L>Pour'd thro' the mellow <HI>Horn</HI> her pensive Soul:</L>
<L>And dashing soft from Rocks around,</L>
<L>Bubbling Runnels join'd the Sound;</L>
<L>Thro' Glades and Glooms the mingled Measure stole,</L>
<L>Or o'er some haunted Stream with fond Delay,</L>
<L>Round an holy Calm diffusing,</L>
<L>Love of Peace, and lonely Musing,</L>
<L>In hollow Murmurs died away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
<L>But O how alter'd was its sprightlier Tone!</L>
<L>When <HI>Chearfulness,</HI> a Nymph of healthiest Hue,</L>
<L>Her Bow a-cross her Shoulder flung,</L>
<L>Her Buskins gem'd with Morning Dew,</L>
<L>Blew an inspiring Air, that Dale and Thicket rung,</L>
<L>The Hunter's Call to <HI>Faun</HI> and <HI>Dryad</HI> known!</L>
<L>The Oak-crown'd <HI>Sisters,</HI> and their chast-eye'd
<HI>Queen,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Satyrs</HI> and sylvan Boys were seen,</L>
<L>Peeping from forth their Alleys green;</L>
<L>Brown <HI>Exercise</HI> rejoic'd to hear,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sport</HI> leapt up, and seiz'd his Beechen Spear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Last came <HI>Joy's</HI> Ecstatic Trial,</L>
<L>lie With viny Crown advancing,</L>
<L>First to the lively Pipe his Hand addrest,</L>
<L>But soon he saw the brisk awak'ning Viol,</L>
<L>Whose sweet entrancing Voice he lov'd the best.</L>
<L>They would have thought who heard the Strain,</L>
<L>They saw in <HI>Tempe</HI>'s Vale her native Maids,</L>
<L>Amidst the festal sounding Shades,</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="54"/>
To some unwearied Minstrel dancing,</L>
<L>While as his flying Fingers kiss'd the Strings,</L>
<L>LOVE fram'd with <HI>Mirth,</HI> a gay fantastic Round,</L>
<L>Loose were Her Tresses seen, her Zone unbound,</L>
<L>And HE amidst his frolic Play,</L>
<L>As if he would the charming Air repay,</L>
<L>Shook thousand Odours from his dewy Wings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O <HI>Music,</HI> Sphere-descended Maid,</L>
<L>Friend of Pleasure, <HI>Wisdom's</HI> Aid,</L>
<L>Why, Goddess, why to us deny'd?</L>
<L>Lay'st Thou thy antient Lyre aside?</L>
<L>As in that lov'd <HI>Athenian</HI> Bow'r,</L>
<L>You learn'd an all-commanding Pow'r,</L>
<L>Thy mimic Soul, O Nymph endear'd,</L>
<L>Can well recall what then it heard.</L>
<L>Where is thy native simple Heart,</L>
<L>Devote to Virtue, Fancy, Art?</L>

<L>Arise as in that elder Time,</L>
<L>Warm, Energic, Chaste, Sublime!</L>
<L>Thy Wonders in that God-like Age,</L>
<L>Fill thy recording <HI>Sister's</HI> Page—</L>
<L>'Tis said, and I believe the Tale,</L>
<L>Thy humblest <HI>Reed</HI> could more prevail,</L>
<L>Had more of Strength, diviner Rage,</L>
<L>Than all which charms this laggard Age,</L>
<L>Ev'n all at once together found,</L>
<L><HI>Caecilia</HI>'s mingled World of Sound—</L>
