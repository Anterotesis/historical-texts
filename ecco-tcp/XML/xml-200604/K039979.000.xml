<L>Behold a personage well known to fame;</L>
<L>Once lov'd and honour'd—<HI>Christmas</HI> is my name!</L>
<L>My officers of state my taste display;</L>
<L>Cooks, scullions, pastry-cooks, prepare my way!</L>

<L>Tho' old, and white my locks, my cheeks are cherry,</L>
<L>Warm'd by good fires, good cheer, I'm always merry:</L>

<L>Hear my <HI>Tale</HI> out—see <HI>all</HI> that's to be seen!</L>
<L>Take care, my children, that you well behave,</L>
<L>You, Sir, in blue, red cape—not quite so grave:</L>

That critick there in black—so stern and thin,</L>

<L>Excuse me pray—I did not see your husband near you.</L>
<L>Don't think, fair Ladies, I expect that you,</L>

<P>TYCHO, Tycho! where are you, Tycho? sure
the fellow has taken me at my word, and gone to
hang or drown himself—he threatened both—Lovers
are great bullies, and swear a thousand things, they never
intend to perform; if the poor woman shews any fear, the
bullies rave the more, and she gives up at once that no∣blest
privilege of the sex, making the wisest fools, and
the stoutest miserable—I have a tongue to be sure that
moves quick, and by out-running my wit sometimes, may
encourage young coxcombs to hope too much; but then
my heart all the while, poor thing! knows nothing of the
matter, and feels no more, than my shoe-knots.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>My eyes may speak pleasure,</L>
<L>Tongue flow without measure,</L>
<L>Yet my heart in my bosom lies still;</L>
<L>Thus the river is flowing,</L>
<L>The mill-clapper going,</L>
<L>But the miller's asleep in his mill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though lovers surround me,</L>
<L>With speeches confound me,</L>
<L>Yet my heart in my bosom lies still;</L>
<L>Thus the river is flowing,</L>
<L>The mill-clapper going,</L>
<L>But the miller's asleep in his mill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The little God eyes me,</L>
<L>And thinks to surprise me,</L>
<L>But my heart is awake in my breast;</L>
<L>Thus boys slily creeping,</L>
<L>Would catch a bird sleeping,</L>
<L>But the linnet's awake in his nest.</L>
</LG>
</LG>
<P>Where can this Tycho have hid himself? I'm sure he
went this way—stay, is not that my gentleman creeping
along the side of the canal? It is either he, my other
lover, Faladal, or the monkey in his new livery; I must
give him a little more hope, or we shall have no more
sport with him.</P>

<STAGE> (peeping out of a tree.)</STAGE>
<P>There's a hard-hearted she-devil for you!—do I look
like a monkey in a new livery? I don't know how love
may have alter'd me, but I know a few weeks ago, that
I had the best face in this island, or my glass is a deceiver
of youth. If I had not so much tenderness in my com∣position,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
I would play the devil among these petticoats—
But here she comes again, and I can't say boo! to her for
the life of me.</P>

<SPEAKER>ROBINETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too melancholly! your face seems preparing for a
funeral, instead of looking out for a wedding: I hate me∣lancholy,
and all melancholy people: A cloudy face betokens
a cloudy heart, and I will have neither: Never will
I sail to the port of matrimony but with a smiling sea, and a
clear sky—that's the way to make a good voyage of it.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>TYCHO.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is, faith; he! he! he!—My face will be∣come
smiles, as well as a great deal of thinking: I have
study'd myself fnto melancholy, but I'll burn my books,
and be as merry as you please to make me. He! he! he!</P>

<SPEAKER>ROBINETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you dance about my heart, and will certainly run

<P>Melancholy and jealous too!—I declare off—Fye for
shame! a man, a young man, of person, parts, address,
and coversation, to be jealous of an old simpering, swag∣gering,
rhiming gentleman usher, who is as dry as a mum∣my,
and talks of love; has no strength, and talks of
fighting giants; has no wit, and thinks to gain me! O,
Fye, for shame!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TYCHO.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, indeed, both a sin and a shame—I'll know my∣self
better, and be afraid of nobody but you, Robinette:
I would say more, but it is time for me to laugh, he! he!
he! is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBINETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you shew yourself to advantage—But, look at
the lovers there! they have had a fresh quarrel, I suppose;
go and end it; and take the hot fool home to his father to
cool him.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>TYCHO.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll be melancholy no more—to please you, Robinette,
I will dance when I am sad; be pert and merry, tho' I have
nothing to say, like other young gentlemen—I'll be
quite in the mode, more of the monkey, and less of the
man.—Tol, lol, lol.—Will that do? bye Robinette.
Tol, lol, lol.—Heigho!</P>
<STAGE>(Dances off, and sighs.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>ROBINETTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do like this fellow a little, though I plague him so—
and perhaps I plague him because I like him;—he's a
strange creature, and yet I like him—I'm a strange crea∣ture
too, and he likes me—he has a hundred faults—
hold, hold, Signora Robinetta,—have not you a little
fault or two in the corner of your heart, if your
neighbours could come at them?—O woman,
woman! what an agreeable, whimsical, fanciful coy,
coquettish, quick-sighted, no-sighted, angelical, devillish,
