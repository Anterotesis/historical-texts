<HEAD>To the Right Honourable CHARLES, Lord <HI>HALIFAX.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Poem which was writ with a Design to shew the Prevalence and Power of Union, could to no Person be more pro∣perly Addrest than Your Lordship, who have ever since You have appear'd in the World been so great a pro∣moter of Union.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
In those great Offices of the highest Trust; in which Your Lordship has been employ'd at the same Time, both by the Prince and the People, You have always made pro∣fession of those Publick and Noble Principles which alone are capable of Uniting the Prince and the People.</P>
<P>And while in the late Reign the Commons of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> hearken'd to Your Lord∣ship's Advice in Parliament, they were united in their In∣clinations and their Designs to the great People whom they represented. The Nerves of War were duely supply'd, and that War was carried on
<PB REF="4"/>
Vigorously. The Greatness of <HI>France</HI> was sapp'd by de∣grees and insensibly Under∣min'd, and prepar'd to re∣ceive a terrible Shock from the first Blow it should meet with. But as soon as Your Lordship's Enemies began to prevail in those Illustrious Assemblies, a Spirit of Parci∣mony ill Understood and worse Tim'd crept in amongst them, and forc'd the best and most discerning of Kings to make a fatal Peace, which has endanger'd the Liberties of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Power and Traffick of this <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and has cost this Nation so many Thousands of Lives and so
<PB REF="5"/>
many Millions of Money, and which makes us ev'n at pre∣sent contented, in order to the ending this just and ne∣cessary War, to furnish those Supplies in the very midst of Scarcity, which we then grumbling with-held in the Height of the greatest Af∣fluence.</P>
<P>My Lord, The late King who was so True and so Just a Judge of Men, was so very well convinc'd of Your Lord∣ship's Services both to the Crown and the People, that He took care by two just and two grateful Acts, that is, by calling You up to the House of Peers, and making You
<PB REF="6"/>
Auditor of the Exchequer, that Your Country should never want Your Service in Parliament, nor the Crown Your Abilities in the great Employments of the State.</P>
<P>The extraordinary Regard which so great a King always express'd for Your Lordship's extraordinary Merit, pro∣vok'd Your Enemies to en∣deavour to fix on You the odious Name of Favourite, as they have since attempted to fasten it on some of Your Il∣lustrious Friends. But with how much Malice, or how much Ignorance have both Attempts been made! For a Favourite is the Prince's meer
<PB REF="7"/>
Creature, whose only Merit is His Sovereign's Favour, and such an Object of the Prince's Favour is always that of the Peoples Scorn and Hatred, and often exposes the very Sovereign to the same Contempt and Hatred. Sovereign Princes are ob∣lig'd by their Duty to God, themselves and their People, to shew most Regard for those who do most for the good of the People whom They govern. And when they perform that Duty, ev'n Kings are Justly Honour'd the more for the Merits of their Subjects. How Happy is the Nation where the Ministers
<PB REF="8"/>
of Kings become the Darlings of the People. How Happy was <HI>England</HI> during the Time of Your Admini∣stration! When Your Lord∣ship was united both to the King and the People; when the People declar'd aloud by their Representatives in Par∣liament, that You had de∣serv'd the Honours by which the King distinguish'd You! How Happy are we now, when the Queen Employs the most extraordinary Per∣sons in the Highest Employ∣ments, whose Praises are ce∣lebrated by the August As∣semblies of Parliament, and ecchoed by every part of the
<PB REF="9"/>
Kingdom. Since never Prin∣ces were more universally e∣steem'd by the People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> than the late King and the present Queen, 'tis an In∣fallible sign that the same People approve of their cho∣sen Ministers.</P>
<P>Your Lordship, who in the late Reign was constantly employ'd in uniting the King and the People, or the Peo∣ple and their Representa∣tives, has been justly thought in this to be the fittest Person to maintain Union between the two Sovereign Princes in whom <HI>England</HI> is most con∣cern'd. With how sensible a pleasure do all who have the
<PB REF="10"/>
Honour to know Your Lord∣ship, consider the People of <HI>Hanover</HI> surveying You with a venerable Awe, as a Person employ'd in Affairs of the Highest Trust and the Highest Consequence by the Two greatest Princes that e∣ver ruled the bravest People of <HI>Europe.</HI> The late King made choice of Your Lord∣ship to stand in the Breach which Faction had made in the Ramparts of Liberty. The Queen has chosen You not only to resist but to at∣tack Faction, and to drive it from its last Retrenchment, by settling and securing an intire Correspondence between
<PB REF="11"/>
Her Majesty and Her presumptive Heir. And the Queen could not possibly re∣pose a greater Trust in Your Lordship than by employing You in an Affair, the Success of which, was of so dear con∣cern to Her Majesty as the securing both the Court of <HI>Hanover</HI> and Her own Sub∣jects, of Her hearty Intenti∣ons in Relation to the Act of Settlement. When that Court beheld in Your Lordship so glorious an Example of the <HI>British</HI> Greatness, how were they exalted to think what a People they were one Day to Govern, tho' may that be late. They began to think
<PB REF="12"/>
some of their future Subjects equal to Foreign Princes, and Your Lordship was en∣tertain'd with the same Ho∣nours which are paid to them.</P>
<P>The great Things which Your Lordship has done for uniting the Prince and the Successour, the Prince and the People, and the People among one another, and for resisting the Force and Arti∣fices of the Common Enemy, ought in gratitude to unite the Inclinations of all <HI>English</HI> Men to Your Lordship. To whom we have all so great Obligations, that we cannot so much as pay or receive the very least Summ without reflecting
<PB REF="13"/>
on our Engagements to the late King, and to You; to the late King, whose I∣mage we see upon every single Piece, and to Your Lordship who plac'd it there; when in the midst of the publick Indigence (an Indi∣gence like that of <HI>Tantalus</HI> that plagued us in the midst of Plenty, when the Miser rol∣ling in full Bags might then first be truly said to be lite∣rally poor) Your Lordship by a political and noble Alchy∣my transmuted Pewter and sordid Brass to Silver and fine Gold, and by an Action so great and so beneficent, se¦cur'd real Property to those
<PB REF="14"/>
at Home, who had but the Shadow of it before, and re∣viv'd and restor'd the expi∣ring Credit of the Nation a∣broad. Since My Lord Trea∣surer by his admirable Ma∣nagement of the Nerves of War, is so justly said to have had so great a share in the glorious Successes of the late Campaigns, Your Lordship sure must have no small one, since without what you have done, there could be no Ma∣nagement.</P>
<P>These, My Lord, are the publick Reasons for Addres∣sing the following Poem to Your Lordship. There is a private one, and that is, that
<PB REF="15"/>
when a Man contracts so great a Debt as to make him Insolvent, the least thing that he can do is to acknowledge what he can never pay; thus Bankrupts, when they can make no other return, send their Creditors an Epistle. I have lately had very great Obligations to Your Lord∣ship: You have been pleas'd to take some care of my For∣tune at a Time when I most wanted it, and had least rea∣son to expect it from You, since several things hinder'd my giving that constant at∣tendance on You, which Per∣sons of Quality so scrupu∣lously exact from those of
<PB REF="16"/>
Inferiour Rank, and with which, when Your Lordship is generously pleas'd to Dis∣pense, You plainly Declare, that Your Noble Notions of Liberty are not embrac'd by You as they are by many, either out of Pride, or on the account of Interest, but by a Principle of Exalted Reason, and Goodness, and Humanity. This is the first Opportunity which I have had since I receiv'd Your Favours of paying my Ac∣knowledgments to You in so publick a manner, which I desire Your Lordship to accept with Your usual Goodness. But how false or
<PB REF="17"/>
how bounded is Human Virtue! And how few are Grateful without a Design of engaging their Benefa∣ctors or others to Heap more Benefits on them, by shew∣ing that they can be sensible of them. This very Address to Your Lordship is not without an Intention of en∣gaging You whose Judgment in these Matters is acknow∣ledg'd by all the World, to defend, as far as Your Con∣science will give You leave, one of the Boldest Poems that has been writ for seve∣ral Years. But I who konw the vast Business in which You are engag'd, am presuming
<PB REF="18"/>
enough to appre∣hend rather Your not Read∣ing than Your not Liking,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble, most Faithful and most oblig'd Servant, John Dennis.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THough the attempt which I have made in the following Poem is very bold, yet I would not have the Reader believe it Rash. I think my self obliged, then to satisfie him without any Delay, that it is by no means de∣signed to be a just Epick Poem. I know too little of the Nature of that Poem, and too much of my own infirmity ever to at∣tempt to write one. But tho' this can by no means pass for a just Epick Poem, yet is it something of the Epick Kind, and bears the same proportion to a just Poem that a short and a faint Essay do's to a full and a perfect Treatise.</P>
<P><PB REF="20"/>
That which threw me into this way of writing was the very Subject of the Poem. The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> has laid such High Obligations upon his Country, that nothing can be said too much of him, nor done too much for him. And this obli∣ged me to endeavour to do something more Bold and more Great, than any thing that I had endeavoured to do former∣ly.</P>
<P>But no Poem that is not Religious can be great without extravagance or bold without rashness, which has been for∣merly prov'd. But there were but two ways of writing a Religious Poem upon this Occasion. The one was to do it by way of Hymn, and the other was to in∣troduce Machines. The former being anticipated in the Poem which I wrote on the Battle of <HI>Bleinem</HI>; there remai∣ned only the latter.</P>
<P><PB REF="21"/>
But here I easily foresee that the fol∣lowing Objection will be made, and that is, that since what the Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough</HI> has done is in its self so great and so wonderful, what occasion was there to endeavour to adorn it by Fiction. To which I answer, that because what the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> has done is in its self so wonderful that it appears in∣credible, and Truth it self has the Re∣semblance of Fable and of Fiction, for that very Reason I was encouraged to embellish it with the Ornaments of Poe∣try. This is the Defence that <HI>Boileau</HI> has made for himself in his fourth Epi∣stle, for introducing Machines into his Description of the Passage of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> And if the Apology stands good for him, as it has always past hitherto, it is still better for me. For my Machines are Christian whereas his are Pagan, and consequently can raise no great Emotion in the Minds of the Readers, because
<PB REF="22"/>
they are incredible, according to one of his own Verses.</P>
<Q><L>L' esprit n'est point emu de ce qu'il ne croit pas.</L></Q>
<P>If any one objects that what I make my Machines say and act will no more be believed than what <HI>Boileau</HI> Attributes to the God of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to that I an∣swer, that though things did not actu∣ally pass before and in the Battle of <HI>Ra∣millies,</HI> as they are related here, yet he who believes the Christian Religion and a particular Providence, and Reflects upon a hundred Passages in the Old and new Testament, must allow, that there past something not altogether unlike it. We see it is the Opinion of the Duke himself, that the Hand of God was in it, that Heaven, which leaves most Events to common Causes, was immediately con∣cerned in this. Now can any thing be more reasonable for one who believes that
<PB REF="23"/>
Heaven was immediately concerned on one side, than to believe that Hell, which our Religion tells us is always for oppo∣sing the great Designs of Heaven, was immediately concerned on the other. Thus the Design of this Poem is built and the Machines are introduced upon what happened to the Duke in the Bat∣tle, and what he himself wrote to one of our Ministers of State after it.</P>
<P>Thus I have given an Account of the Design of this Poem; How well that de∣sign is executed, I must leave to the Rea∣der. As I have consulted my Friends who are fam'd for their Judgment in things of this Nature, as to what relates to the first four Books, and have had them by me long enough to form some Judgment of them my self, I know the Fort and the Foible of them. For the fifth I have neither had it by me long enough to make any Judgment of it my self, nor have I had time enough to consult my
<PB REF="24"/>
Friends about it. And therefore if there is any thing amiss in it, I must leave it to the indulgence of the Candid Reader. I only desire him to take notice, that having formerly describ'd with all the Application of which I was capable, a Battle gain'd by the same General, I was obliged to take a very different method in this Poem. I have only this to add, that I have not said so much as I thought to have done, of the Important Consequnces of the Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> because I have some thoughts of writing a Pindarick Poem upon that great Action of <HI>Quintus Flaminius,</HI> which restored Liberty to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Citties. Between which Illu∣strious <HI>Roman</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough,</HI> a very just Parallel may be drawn.</P>

Celestial Guardian of this Sacred Isle,</L>
<L>Genius of Warlike <HI>Britain,</HI> who awhile</L>

<L><PB N="3" REF="27"/>
And their Heroick Deeds in such a strain</L>
<L>As no fictitious Muse can ere inspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now was the Sun in <HI>Taurus</HI> mounted high,</L>
<L>And darting down his Genial Rays from Heav'n</L>
<L>Directly to the Bosom of the Earth,</L>
<L>Call'd forth each Plant and ev'ry tender Flow'r</L>
<L>From out their Wintry, secret warm Re∣treats,</L>
<L>And restor'd Nature and renew'd the World;</L>
<L>When the Confederate Troops call'd out by Fate,</L>
<L>And by their great Commanders awful Voice</L>
<L>Were from their wintry warlike Stations drawn</L>
<L>T'appear near <HI>Tongeren</HI> in fierce Array.</L>
<L>Full of that conqu'ring Spirit they appear'd,</L>
<L>Which drove the vanquish'd <HI>French</HI> or'e <HI>Blen∣heim</HI>'s Field.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="28"/>
And in their Eyes a penetrating View</L>
<L>Might easily discern their Triumphs past,</L>
<L>And their amazing Victory to come.</L>
<L>All Nature seem transported at that Sight,</L>
<L>For Tyranny, Oppression, Discord, Fraud,</L>
<L>Injustice, Violence, and Barbarous Rage</L>
<L>Are all about to be expell'd the Earth,</L>
<L>And in their room Simplicity and Truth,</L>
<L>Justice, Security and gentle Ease,</L>
<L>And Peace and spotless Innocence, shall reign;</L>
<L>Therefore all Nature smil'd upon that Sight</L>
<L>And Gods, and Men, and Earth, and Heav'n rejoyc'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Hell's black Tyrant soon took fierce Alarms</L>
<L>Which to infernal Torments added Stings,</L>
<L>And to infernal Fury fiercer Flames,</L>
<L>And doubled the Damnation in his Breast.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="29"/>
Upon the Steerage of his dusky Wings,</L>
<L>Up thro' the Ocean of the Air he sails;</L>
<L>In the midway he stopt between the Moon's</L>
<L>Resplendent Globe, and Earth's refulgent Ball,</L>
<L>At his great Palace there by Magick hung.</L>
<L>And thither a tremendous Council calls</L>
<L>Of Friends who now were roaming round the Earth,</L>
<L>In order to subject it to his Sway.</L>
<L>Up strait upon the Wing the Spirits sprung</L>
<L>At the <HI>Tartarean</HI> Trumpets thundring call,</L>
<L>And high above the Atmosphere they flew,</L>
<L>The World was in Convulsions at the Flight,</L>
<L>Earth trembled, sigh'd the Air, the Ocean groan'd,</L>
<L>Frequent, and full th'accurst Assembly grew,</L>
<L>Direful Appearances, amazing Forms,</L>
<L>Which barely seen had Pow'r to look Despair</L>

And wither in one moment all their strength.</L>

<L>As soon as the Infernal Crew were sate,</L>
<L>Up from his Throne th'outragious Tyrant rose,</L>
<L>His wrathful Forehead to a Frown he roul'd</L>

<L>Inexprimable Terrors thro' the Souls</L>

<L>And Foreign Squadrons to the Charge they lead.</L>
<L>But <HI>Germans, Danes</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> turn <HI>Britons</HI> all</L>
<L>When <HI>Britons</HI> Genius in its God-like Chiefs</L>
<L>Shines out, and fires them to Immortal Deeds,</L>
<L>And leads them to the Charge, unknowing to retire.</L>

<L>O would some Angel give me force to paint</L>
<L>The dreadful stalk of Discords sounding March,</L>
<L>Between conflicting Hosts, before her march'd</L>
<L>Ten thousand Terrours, Natives all of Hell,</L>
<L>Commanded by their grizly Monarch Death.</L>
<L>Each stride entrench'd the Earth on which she strode,</L>
<L>The Air was tempested, the Aether frown'd,</L>
<L>Mean while the Snaky Horrours of her Head</L>
<L>Were wrapt in pitchy Clouds, from which her Eyes</L>
<L>Red Lightning Dart, and Thunder was her Voice.</L>
<L>As sternly she the Field of Death surveys,</L>
<L>And finds that Fate in ev'ry other part</L>
<L>Was doubtful, but where mighty <HI>Malb'rough</HI> shin'd,</L>
<L>There Victory, there Destiny declar'd;</L>
<L><PB N="122" REF="145"/>
She gives a monstrous Yell that frighting shakes</L>
<L>The utmost Fortresses of <HI>Belgian</HI> Land;</L>
<L>The Mountains tremble at the horrid Din,</L>
<L>The Vales re-bellow to the monstrous Roar.</L>
<L>When thus the Terrours and their grizly King</L>
<L>The Fury in a frightful Tone accosts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Have ye then found an over-match at last?</L>
<L>Are ye contented basely to submit</L>
<L>To the Efforts of yon Confederate Pow'rs?</L>
<L>O're which till <HI>Malb'rough</HI> at their Head ap∣pear'd</L>
<L>Ye always have prevail'd, nay now prevail</L>
<L>O're Squadrons which remote from Him en∣gage,</L>
<L>But see He comes, this Thunderbolt of War!</L>
<L>Look how against the Storm He Headlong drives!</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="146"/>
By all that's Impious upon us He drives!</L>
<L>Nay now, He's in the midst of us! He's here!</L>
<L>He unconcern'd and only we amaz'd!</L>
<L>Is it then possible that one frail Man</L>
<L>Can thus resist the Force of all your Pow'rs,</L>
<L>And drive you frighted back upon your Friends?</L>
<L>And can ye poorly bear th'extream Affront?</L>
<L>Ye Host of Terrours and thou grizly Death,</L>
<L>If ye are Terrours arm'd with deadly Stings,</L>
<L>If thou art Death, my cruel Off-spring Death,</L>
<L>And not an empty Bugbear to scare Boys;</L>
<L>Oh fly, oh seize, dispatch th'audacious wretch</L>
<L>Oh pierce Him, stab Him in the vitall st Part!</L>
<L>Ha! how agast with stupid Eyes thou star'st,</L>
<L>To see this <HI>Briton</HI> amidst all thy Pow'rs</L>
<L>Serene, and with a Dauntless Brow appear!</L>
<L>Thou Fool! with all this Calm and Dreadless Brow,</L>
<L><PB N="124" REF="147"/>
This is no God, but a meer Mortal Man,</L>
<L>As subject to Thy Arm as the vile Slave.</L>
<L>Muster Thy Terrours then in dire Array!</L>
<L>And scare this hitherto undaunted Brave,</L>
<L>Then, then be ready with thy Fatal Dart,</L>
<L>Let me alone to give Thee certain aim</L>
<L>And so dispatching one we conquer all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who, tho' Master of an Angel's Force,</L>
<L>An Angel's Genius, and an Angel's Voice,</L>
<L>Of Song Celestial, Eloquence Divine,</L>
<L>Can worthily describe in dreadful Style</L>
<L>The fearful March of the Infernal Pow'rs</L>
<L>Who now prepare t'attack great <HI>Malb'rough</HI>'s Life!</L>
<L>Grim Death his meager Skeleton expands</L>
<L>Into a Form Immense, then musters all</L>
<L>His Terrours in astonishing Array,</L>
<L><PB N="125" REF="148"/>
And charges them t'appear to Mortal Eyes.</L>
<L>His Terrours put on their most hideous Forms,</L>
<L>Forms which with Horrour Nature sees and shakes,</L>
<L>And from its Out-works Trembling Life re∣treats,</L>
<L>And to the Heart its Cittadel retires.</L>
<L>In <HI>Phalanx</HI> then the Hero they assail,</L>
<L>The God-like Hero views them and reviews,</L>
<L>Considers them, disdains them and repells:</L>
<L>But into Madness starts the generous Steed</L>
<L>At the dire sight, he flies, he bounds, he foams,</L>
<L>Flashes of Lightning from his Eye-Balls flie,</L>
<L>And from his Nostrils curling Clouds of Smoak;</L>
<L>Then shrieking on his hindmost Feet he springs,</L>
<L><PB N="126" REF="149"/>
Then groans, and floundring with his Rider falls.</L>
<L>The <HI>Gaul</HI> and the <HI>Bavarian</HI> rend the Sky,</L>
<L>Discord returns the Roar of vast Applause,</L>
<L>And Death and all th'Infernal Pow'rs re∣joyce;</L>
<L>But thro' th'Allies a mortal Murmur runs,</L>
<L>And all their Spirit's with their Hero fall'n,</L>
<L>And Victory has Charms for them no more;</L>
<L>The Heavn'ly Spirits are themselves concern'd,</L>
<L>And for a Moment wonder what this means,</L>
<L>And doubt least they mistook the Voice of Fate.</L>
<L>The Ruffians now whom Discord had suborn'd</L>
<L>Present a Hundred Fusees at His Life,</L>
<L>At once an Hundred Fiery Globes discharge,</L>
<L>But a strong unseen Hand diverts them all.</L>
<L>Grim Death bestrides Him with a Gyant stride,</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="150"/>
And scowls upon Him with a Wall-ey'd glare;</L>
<L>Then lifting brandishes His fatal Dart,</L>
<L>Yet wants the pow'r to strike but looks askew,</L>
<L>And cannot bear the Heroes dauntless Eye,</L>
<L>When Discord cries aloud, O strike my Son!</L>
<L>Is not our dreadful Adversary fall'n,</L>
<L>Yes from the Pinnacle of Glory fall'n,</L>
<L>Fall'n in a Moment to the abjectest State?</L>
<L>O foolish Sentence! Judgment falsly past!</L>
<L>For hear the Angel in th'Aethereal Space.</L>
<L>O greatest Thou, he cries, of Mortal Men,</L>
<L>Who art as Dauntless in the Arms of Death</L>
<L>As we whom Heav'n has plac'd above His reach!</L>
<L>Serene as when Thou o'recam'st at <HI>Bleinem</HI>'s Field!</L>
<L>Then Conquest saw Thee Humble and Serene,</L>
<L>Death finds Thee firm and undejected now.</L>
<L><PB N="128" REF="151"/>
O greatest Thou, he cries, of Mortal Men,</L>
<L>Courage surpassing Human, God-like State,</L>
<L>Which nothing can depress and nothing raise!</L>
<L>Never was Mortal more severly tryed,</L>
<L>But now 'tis past, and perfect art Thou found,</L>
<L>And worthy found to free the Lab'ring World.</L>
<L>For since within the very Arms of Death</L>
<L>Thou hast the high Security enjoy'd</L>
<L>Of Blissful Beings who can die no more,</L>
<L>Thou shalt their high Felicity enjoy,</L>
<L>For thy unshaken Mind can bear it all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Angels dictate, and what Angels do</L>
<L>(Whose Words and Acts are swifter than our Thoughts)</L>
<L>In Moments, Mortals cannot speak in Hours.</L>
<L>Down He comes shooting on His Golden Wings,</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="152"/>
And on the Spot in all His Glory lights</L>
<L>Where in the Arms of Death His <HI>Malb'rough</HI> lay.</L>
<L>The Hero quicken'd by th'approach of Heav'n</L>
<L>Springs from th'embrace of Death, and on His Feet</L>
<L>As swift as are the Wings of Lightning Bounds.</L>
<L>The Heavenly Spirits in th'Aetherial Space,</L>
<L>And all the Empyrean Shouts for Joy,</L>
<L>When He who while He sojourn'd here on Earth</L>
<L>First His Command to God-like <HI>Malbro</HI>' gave,</L>
<L>Sent down from Heaven now gives it Him once more.</L>
<L>The Troops are wild with extasie of Joy</L>
<L>To see their General from the Bonds of Death</L>
<L>To Conpuest and Eternal Glory rise;</L>
<L>Death from Immortal Splendour roaring flies</L>
<L>And yelling Discord flies from Love Divine.</L>
<L><PB N="130" REF="153"/>
Now the Brave Squadrons to His Aid arrive,</L>
<L>And now another fiery Steed present,</L>
<L>And with their cries the eager Hero urge</L>
<L>To lead them on to everlasting Fame,</L>
<L>The Hero mounts, the Squadrons rend the Skies,</L>
<L>Mounting with Him to Heav'n their Spirits soar.</L>
<L>The Hero mounts, but Discord while He mounts</L>
<L>And Death outragious to be thus repuls'd</L>
<L>Level a Canon at His Sacred Head,</L>
<L>But from His Sacred Head the pondrous Ball</L>
<L>Diverted, <HI>Bringfield</HI> who remounts Him kills,</L>
<L>And consecrates Him to Eternal Fame</L>
<L>Who dies for such a Chief in such a Cause.</L>
<L>Thro' the Confederate Troops the Angel now</L>
<L>The Spirit of Celestial Union spreads,</L>
<L>And He who while he sojourn'd here on Earth</L>
<L>First bound the Nations in the Bonds of Love</L>
<L><PB N="131" REF="154"/>
Is sent from Heav'n that Union to confirm</L>
<L>And to augment in great <HI>Ramillia</HI>'s Field.</L>
<L><HI>Malb'rough</HI> remounted feels the Joys of Heav'n,</L>
<L>The Wisdom and the Force of Gods He feels.</L>
<L>And now He leads the shouting Squadrons on</L>
<L>Daring as if they were Immortal all;</L>
<L>With Hearts and Souls unanimous they ad∣vance,</L>
<L>United as they were one Nation all,</L>
<L>One Family, Relations all, and Friends.</L>
<L>One Interest have They all, one Noble Cause,</L>
<L>With Fury inexpressible They advance,</L>
<L>And greatly each resolves to Die for all.</L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> who brave Resistance made till now,</L>
<L>Now can Their fierce Attacks no longer bear.</L>
<L>They can no longer bear their very Eyes</L>
<L>And fatal Meens, but fainting all recoil,</L>
<L>And Death and Discord with their Hell-born Host</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="155"/>
Headlong upon their <HI>Gallick</HI> Friends are diven,</L>
<L>The routed <HI>Gauls</HI> Divide, Disband, Disperse,</L>
<L>They flie, the Angel waves His Flaming Sword,</L>
<L>At which expected Signal on the Wing</L>
<L>Th'Amazing Terrours of th'Almighty stoop,</L>
<L>And persecute and plague their broken Rear;</L>
<L>Make some precipitate their shameful Flight,</L>
<L>While others basely beg for wretched Life,</L>
<L>And others Trembling Faint, and Sink, and Die</L>
<L>Thus Discord and the <HI>Gaul</HI> were forc'd to yield</L>
<L>To <HI>Malb'rough</HI> and to Union's Sacred Pow'r.</L>
