<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM lxxvi. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>Surely, the wrath of man shall praise thee: the
remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Psalm some remarkable Victory
and Deliverance is celebrated, which the
<HI>Jewish</HI> Nation had obtained: A Delive∣rance
in which the Hand of God visi∣bly
appeared, rescuing his People from immi∣nent
Danger. Very probably it was written
in <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Reign, on Occasion of their
being delivered from the formidable Invasion
of <HI>Sennacherib</HI> and the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Army;
when the Angel of the Lord, in one Night,
discomfited all their Host, and smote them
with sudden Destruction<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 King xix. 35.</NOTE>
. To this signal
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Interposition of the Divine Arm, these Ex∣pressions
in the Context may be naturally ap∣plied;
<HI>There brake, he the arrows of the bow,
the shield, the sword, and the battle—the
stout-hearted are spoiled: they have slept their
sleep; and none of the men of might have
found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Ja∣cob,
both the chariot and the horse are cast in∣to
a dead sleep.</HI> In the Words of our Text,
we have the Psalmist's religious and wise Re∣flection
upon all these Events; upon the vio∣lent
Designs of their Enemies, and the Issue
to which Providence brought these Designs;
<HI>Surely, the wrath of man shall praise thee:
the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The wrath of man;</HI> that is, all the Rage,
and the impetuous Passion of wicked Men;
with the violent Effects of War, Persecution,
Oppression, and other Disorders it produces
in the World. All these the Psalmist tells us,
<HI>shall praise God:</HI> Not indeed, by the Intenti∣on
and Design, nor by the native Tendency,
of the <HI>wrath of man:</HI> But by these wise and
good Purposes, which the Providence of God
causes it to <HI>accomplish;</HI> from this Poison <HI>ex∣tracting</HI>
Health; and of Things, most unwil∣ling
and unapt in themselves to yield him Glo∣ry,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
<HI>forming</HI> Instruments of Good. So that,
tho' the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> as the Apostle <HI>James</HI>
speaks, <HI>worketh not,</HI> of itself, <HI>the righteousness of
God (a),</HI> it is nevertheless, <HI>forced</HI> and <HI>compelled</HI>
to minister to his <HI>Praise.</HI> The Psalmist adds,
<HI>the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain:</HI>
That is, GOD will give Way to the Wrath of
Man, and allow it Scope, <HI>so far</HI> as it answers
his good Purposes, and works his Praise; the
rest of it shall be curb'd and bound up: When
it would attempt to go beyond its prescrib'd
Limit, he says to it, as to the Waters of the
Sea, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, but no fur∣ther;
and here shall thy proud waves be stay∣ed</HI>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 20.</NOTE>. All this, the last Issue of Things shall
fully verify and declare: When we shall be
able more clearly to trace the divine Admini∣stration
through its several Steps, by seeing the
Consummation of the whole. In some Cases,
it may be reserved for this Period only, to
disclose and unfold the mysterious Wisdom of
Heaven. But in general, as much of the di∣vine
Conduct and Wisdom, is at present ma∣nifest,
as gives just Ground for this Observati∣on,
that the <HI>wrath of man praises God,</HI> now,
before the whole World.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Job xxxviii. 11.</NOTE> This was the Me∣ditation
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
of the Psalmist after Victory and Con∣quest.
As we, my Brethren, like him, have
lately seen the <HI>wrath of man</HI> raging around us,
in all its Violence; and in the midst of its
Fury have seen it restrain'd and check'd by
the powerful Hand of GOD; such a Medita∣tion,
must be acknowledged very suitable and
becoming now: That by serious Contempla∣tion
of the Ways of Providence, we may
learn to view these Revolutions which befal
Mankind, with the devout Sentiments of our
Psalmist.</P>
<P><HI>IN prosecuting this Subject,</HI> I shall endea∣vour
to illustrate and confirm the Observation
in my Text; by showing in what Manner the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to <HI>praise God.</HI> And
then I shall lead your Thoughts to the Im∣provement
we ought to make of such a Me∣ditation.</P>
<P>THE different Ways, in which the <HI>wrath
of man</HI> turns out to the <HI>praise of God,</HI> are re∣ducible
chiefly to these three. I. As it <HI>mani∣fests</HI> most brightly the glorious <HI>Perfections</HI>
of GOD in the Government of the Universe.
II. As it <HI>illustrates</HI> and <HI>improves</HI> the <HI>Virtues</HI> of good Men; and thus <HI>beautifies</HI> his Church
and People. And, III. As it is made the
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Means of <HI>working</HI> out their greater <HI>Prosperity</HI>
and <HI>Happiness,</HI> upon the whole.</P>
<P>I. I say, the <HI>wrath of man praises God,</HI> as it gives Occasion for the brighter and more
illustrious <HI>Discovery of his Perfections,</HI> in the
<HI>Government</HI> of the World.—The <HI>Beauty</HI> and
<HI>Order</HI> of the Universe is much heighten'd, by
its being so complicated a System: In which,
there are such a Variety of Springs to be ad∣justed;
and so many different Movements
to be regulated and kept in Order: Inter∣fering
Interests and jarring Passions <HI>ballanc'd,</HI>
in such Manner, against one another; violent
and unruly Men kept under such a wise and
regular <HI>Controul;</HI> and the <HI>wrath of man</HI> made
so to know its <HI>Place;</HI> that, how opposite so∣ever
the several Motions seem to be, yet they
<HI>concur</HI> and meet at last in one End. This
renders a Divine Hand <HI>sensible</HI> and <HI>illustrious:</HI> This opens a more wonderful Prospect of the
Divine Government, than if all its Subjects
were loyal, and willingly obedient; and makes
that Power and Wisdom, which can render
such <HI>intractable</HI> Things subservient to the Ends
of Justice and Goodness, appear so much the
more worthy of everlasting Admiration and
Praise. More particularly,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
1. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> redounds to the
Praise of GOD's <HI>almighty Power;</HI> as this is
display'd in his restraining and baffling at Pleasure
all its Fury and Wickedness.—To reign
with sovereign Command, amidst the most
disorder'd and turbulent State of Things, is
the peculiar Glory of Omnipotence. Hence
we find GOD describ'd in Scripture <HI>sitting
on the flood, riding on the wings of the wind,
dwelling in the darkness and the tempest.</HI> As
<HI>he stills the raging of the seas, and the noise of
their waves,</HI> so, <HI>he stills the tumults of the
people.</HI> When the Passions of Men are most
<HI>agitated</HI> and <HI>inflamed,</HI> and their violent De∣signs
just ripe for bursting into Execution;
how oft by some unforeseen. Turn of Provi∣dence,
hath he call'd upon Mankind to ob∣serve,
that there is one <HI>higher than the highest
on Earth,</HI> who can baffle all their Devices
with the Breath of his Mouth; and com∣mand
the Earth <HI>to be still before him?</HI> When
proud Fleets cover the Ocean, he blows with
his Wind, and they are scattered. When
mighty Armies go forth to Battle, in all the
Glory of human Strength, with what <HI>Majesty</HI>
does an omnipotent Arm sometimes appear?
—As in the Case of haughty <HI>Sennacherib,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
and that boasted Tempest of Wrath he threat∣ned
to pour upon all the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation:
<HI>I will put my hook,</HI> says GOD, <HI>in thy nose, and
my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou camest</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xix. 23.</NOTE>. In that
Night the destroying Angel smote the Host:
And he departed, we are told, with <HI>shame of
face to his own land. When the heathen rage,
and the people imagine a vain thing; when the
kings of the earth set themselves, and its rulers
take counsel together; he that sitteth in the
heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall hold them
in derision: then shall he speak to them in
wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. ii. 1, 2, 4, 5.</NOTE>.
Again,</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to praise the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> as well as the Power of GOD; when
he makes the unruly Passions of bad Men,
<HI>work</HI> in a secret Way, towards Ends, by them
altogether unforeseen. This most eminently
displays the unsearchable Depths of the Di∣vine
Counsel, when we see them render'd the
<HI>Ministers</HI> of Providence, to forward Designs
which they intended to destroy.—Thus, how
surprising is it, in the History of <HI>Joseph,</HI> that
the Cruelty of his Brethren, the Lewdness
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
and Resentment of his Mistress, and the Wrath
of <HI>Potiphar,</HI> should all <HI>conspire</HI> to his Ad∣vancement,
and prove the <HI>Steps,</HI> by which
this persecuted and friendless Man rose, till he
became the Saviour of all his Kindred? How
remarkably did the <HI>wrath of man</HI> praise GOD
in the case of <HI>Daniel?</HI> The Malice of his E∣nemies
had thrown him into the Den of Li∣ons
for worshipping GOD; they presumed
his Destruction accomplish'd; and them∣selves
completely delivered from so formi∣dable
a Rival; yet this very Event prov'd not
only the Occasion of <HI>Daniel's</HI> greater Honour,
and their utter Ruin, but of a Decree through
all the Kingdom of the <HI>Medes,</HI> that all Men
should worship and fear before the GOD of
<HI>Daniel</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dan vi. 25.</NOTE>. Thus GOD <HI>snareth the wicked
in the works of their hands</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pasl. ix. 16.</NOTE>: And <HI>erects</HI>
his own Counsel upon the Ruin of theirs.
These Things which, view'd apart, appear to
us <HI>Spots</HI> in the divine Administration, when
considered in their <HI>Connection</HI> with all the Train
of succeeding Events, often add a great <HI>Lustre</HI>
and <HI>Beauty</HI> to it. Were our Views extensive
enough, we should discern it always to be thus.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
3. I might observe further, that the <HI>wrath
of man</HI> praises the <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD; in all
these Purposes of general <HI>Benefit,</HI> both <HI>tem∣poral</HI>
and <HI>spiritual,</HI> to which his Providence
renders it subservient. But these will fall
to be afterwards considered; I therefore pro∣ceed
to observe,</P>
<P>4. THAT the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to
praise the Divine <HI>Justice.</HI>—In many Cases it
is sufficient for this End, that GOD let loose
upon bad Men, for their own <HI>Punishment,</HI>
these angry Passions, which make them the
Disturbers of others. By giving them up to
the Workings of these, he opens a Source of
restless Pain within their Breasts; and delivers
them over to themselves, to be their own
<HI>Tormentors.</HI> In thus <HI>connecting</HI> the Punish∣ment
with the Crime, causing their <HI>own
wickedness to reprove them, and their back∣slidings
to correct them,</HI> the Hand of Justice
is plainly seen. And tho' the Sinner that
<HI>feels</HI> it, may affect to disguise his Suffering,
yet every one knows that no Punishment is
more <HI>real,</HI> or more <HI>intense,</HI> than the <HI>inward
Misery</HI> of a Mind, wrought and torn with
Despite, Revenge, or wrathful Passion. In
such a Case, we may understand that Say∣ing
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
of the Psalmist to receive its Accomplish∣ment;
<HI>The wicked have drawn out their
sword, and bent their bow, to cast down the
poor and needy;—but the sword which they
have drawn shall enter into their own heart</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pasl. xxxvii. 14, 15.</NOTE>.
—The <HI>wrath of man</HI> praises also the Divine
Justice, by being the <HI>Instrutment</HI> of punish∣ing
<HI>other</HI> ambitious and violent Men. They
are let loose upon one another to fulfil the
Vengeance of Heaven. One corrupt Nation
is raised up against another; that <HI>both</HI> may
suffer for their Sins. And as there can be no
soild nor lasting Bond of Union amongst wicked
Men, (tho' they may be occasionally cement∣ed
by Conspiracy against the Good) their con∣tinually
interfering Views and Interests, ren∣der
them, in the just <HI>Judgment</HI> of Provi∣dence,
a Prey to mutual Jealousy, Strife and
Fraud.—Finally, the Justice of GOD is
praised in the <HI>Vengeance,</HI> which, sooner or
later, he executes against the Wrath and Vio∣lence
of Sinners. They may go on for a
Time, and appear to prosper: The Justice of
Heaven may seem to slumber: but it is <HI>awake:</HI>
and only waits till the <HI>measure of their iniquity
be full.</HI> How oft has the World been a∣wakened
to the Observation of the awful Go∣vernment
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
of GOD, by the sudden Fall and
Destruction of Tyrants? GOD represents him∣self
in Scripture, as permitting Wickedness
sometimes to arise to an over-grown Height,
on Purpose that its Ruin may be the <HI>greater,</HI> and the more <HI>astonishing. For this cause</HI> he
tells that wicked Prince <HI>Pharaoh, he had raised
him up,</HI> that is, allowed him to prosper and
be exalted, <HI>that he might shew in him his
power; and that his name might be declared
throughout all the earth</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Exod, ix. 16.</NOTE>. The Divine Ad∣ministration
is glorified as well in the <HI>strange
Punishment</HI> he hath decreed for the Workers
of Iniquity, as in the <HI>Reward</HI> he hath pre∣pared
for the Righteous. This is <HI>the purpose
which the Lord hath purposed upon all the
earth: and this is the hand that stretched
forth over all the nations</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Isa. xiv, 26.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is made to <HI>praise
God,</HI> by giving Mankind <HI>deep Impressions</HI> of that
infinite <HI>Power, Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> that governs
the World. Such Impressions it is necessary
for Mankind to have; and, in their present
imperfect State, they can only receive them
from something that is <HI>sensible</HI> and <HI>striking.</HI> The Commotions and Disorders of the World,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
open a Field for <HI>signalizing</HI> the Divine Ad∣ministration
more, than if all Things went on
in a <HI>quiet undisturbed</HI> Tenor. The Waters
must be sometimes <HI>troubled,</HI> that we may <HI>at∣tend</HI>
to that Hand which stills their Raging:
and <HI>Clouds</HI> must arise, that the heavenly
Light which dispels them, may <HI>strike</HI> our
Eye with the more sensible <HI>Brightness.</HI> We
further observed,</P>
<P>II. THAT the <HI>wrath of man</HI> may be justly
said to praise GOD, by that Tendency which
he gives it to <HI>improve</HI> and <HI>illustrate</HI> the <HI>Virtues</HI>
of good Men; and thereby to <HI>beautify</HI> his
Church and People. Now it hath this Effect,</P>
<P>1. As it is employed by GOD to be the
Means of <HI>correcting</HI> good Men for their Faults.
These <HI>Storms,</HI> which Ambition and Pride raise
among Mankind, he permits, with the same
Intention, that he sends forth <HI>Tempests</HI> and
<HI>Hurricanes</HI> amongst the Elements; to clear
the Atmosphere of noxious Vapours, and pu∣rify
it from that <HI>Corruption</HI> which all Things
contract by too much Rest. Bad Men appear
sometimes to have obtained entire Power o∣ver
the Just: they exercise their Tyranny,
perhaps, with a very heavy and oppressive
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Hand: the Just complain and groan; and in the
Bitterness of their Soul, can hardly for∣bear
to exclaim; "<HI>Where</HI> is the Lord? And
where the <HI>Sceptre</HI> of <HI>Righteousness</HI> and
<HI>Truth? Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</HI>
Or doth he indeed <HI>see,</HI> and <HI>is there know∣ledge
in the Most High?</HI>"—Their Oppres∣sors
are really no more than the Instruments
of GOD to them for <HI>Good:</HI> He sees they stand
in <HI>Need</HI> of such Correction; and therefore
raises them up Enemies, to cure the Intempe∣rance
of Prosperity; And by that Seriousness
which Affliction is fitted to introduce into the
Mind, to lead them to think of themselves,
of their Duty, and their past Errors. In this
Way the Disturbers of the Earth are often re∣presented
to us in Scripture; as <HI>Scourges</HI> in the
Hand of GOD, sent forth to do his Work up∣on
a degenerating People: They are employed
in the Execution of righteous and wise Purpo∣ses,
<HI>concealed</HI> from themselves; and, when
their Commission is fulfilled, recalled and de∣stroyed.
Of this we have a remarkable Ex∣ample
in the King of <HI>Assyria. I will send him,
says</HI> GOD, <HI>against an hypocritical nation, and
against the people of my wrath, will I give him
a charge, to take the spoil and to take the prey:
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
—howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his
heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy
and cut off nations not a few.—Wherefore it
shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
performed his whole work upon mount Zion
and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the
stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory
of his high looks</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Isa. x. 6, 7, 12.</NOTE>. Vainly then doth the
<HI>warth of man</HI> lift itself up against GOD.—
<HI>Shall the ax boast itself against him that hew∣eth
therewith? Or shall the saw magnify it∣self
against him that shaketh it?</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Isa. x. 15.</NOTE>—<HI>All
things,</HI> whether they will or not, must <HI>work
together for good to them that love God.</HI>—This
amongst the rest, fills up the Place assign'd it,
by the <HI>Ordination</HI> of Heaven;—and the
proudest Conqueror, and the most oppressive
Tyrant, possess only the same <HI>Station,</HI> with
the Famine, the Pestilence, and the Flood:
their <HI>Triumphs</HI> are no more than the Ac∣complishment
of GOD's Correction: And <HI>the
remainder of their wrath shall he restrain.</HI></P>
<P>2. GOD makes the <HI>wrath of man</HI> to praise
him, not only by employing it in Chastise∣ment,
but as the Instrument of <HI>improving</HI> and
<HI>signalizing</HI> the Graces of good Men; and
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
thereby raising them to higher <HI>Honour</HI> and
<HI>Glory.</HI>—Had there been no Persecutors and
Tyrants, no Oppressors of Liberty, no wrath∣ful
and furious Men in the World, what a
Number of <HI>great</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> Actions had ne∣ver
been heard of? What shining Examples
of Fortitude, Constancy and Patience, had
been lost to the World? What a Field of Vir∣tues,
<HI>peculiar</HI> to a State of Improvement and
Discipline, had lain uncultivated?—Spirits
of a higher Order possess a State of <HI>established</HI>
Virtue, that stands in Need of no such <HI>Improve∣ments</HI>
and <HI>Trials.</HI> But to <HI>us,</HI> who are only
under Education for such a State, it <HI>belongs</HI> to
pass through the Furnace, that our Souls may
be <HI>tried, refined,</HI> and <HI>brightened.</HI> We must
stand the <HI>Conflict,</HI> that we may be graced and
crowned as <HI>Conquerors.</HI> The <HI>wrath of man</HI> gives
the Occasion, and the Field;—calls us forth
to the most conspicuous and distinguished Ex∣ercise
of <HI>active</HI> Virtue,—and forms us to all
those <HI>suffering</HI> Graces which are amongst the
brightest Ornaments of the human Soul. When
unjust Attempts are carried on against our pub∣lick
Interests, these give us the Means of disco∣vering
true publick Spirit, and Love to our Coun∣try.
When we suffer in our private Concerns,
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
there our Enemies put it into our Power
to gain the noblest Conquest, by overcoming
the World; and to make ourselves greater than
the greatest Man who injures us by forgiving
him. When we suffer for the Sake of Truth
and a good Conscience, there we have the de∣sirable
Opportunity afforded us, of gaining Ho∣nour
truly immortal, by being Witnesses for
GOD, and maintaining an exemplary and he∣roic
Fidelity. In all this <HI>the wrath of man
praises God.</HI>—Every single Instance, in which
our Souls are improv'd, or some Action of
distinguished Goodness is produced, by Means
of <HI>the wrath of man,</HI> redounds most highly,
both to our <HI>own Good,</HI> and to <HI>his Praise,</HI> who
hath <HI>order'd</HI> Things in this Manner for our
<HI>Improvement.</HI>—'Tis thus, the illustrious Band
of Patriots and Heroes, of Confessors and Mar∣tyrs,
have been set forth to the Admiration of
all Ages, as <HI>the lights of the world:</HI> Whilst the
Violence and Fury of Enemies, instead of
bearing them down, has only serv'd to exalt
and dignify them the more.—We proceed
now to the</P>
<P>III. VIEW we proposed to give of the <HI>wrath
of man praising God;</HI> when Providence makes
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
it the Mean of <HI>working</HI> out greater <HI>Prosperity</HI>
and <HI>Happiness,</HI> upon the whole, to his People
and Church.—I say, the Violence of <HI>Enemies,</HI>
the Rage of <HI>Persecutors,</HI> and the Oppression
of <HI>Tyrants,</HI> not only tend, in the Way of mo∣ral
and religious Improvement to the <HI>better∣ing</HI>
of our Souls; but also are often made,
in their Consequences, to produce other un∣look'd
for Blessings to good Men <HI>in this State.</HI>
As this is no rare nor unfrequent Thing, we
shall point out some Instances in which it ap∣pears.
Thus,</P>
<P>THE Hardships which good Men suffer
from others in their <HI>private</HI> Concerns, are of∣ten
seen to <HI>give Birth</HI> to their succeeding Pros∣perity.
Many Exemplifications of this we
find in History. The unfortunate Circum∣stances
of <HI>Moses's</HI> Birth, thro' the Cruelty of
an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tyrant, were the Means of this
exposed Infant's being bred up as a King's Son,
and of his being <HI>accomplish'd</HI> for his future
great Atchievements, with all the Wisdom
and Learning of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Court. The
Insolence and proud Resentment of <HI>Haman</HI>
pav'd the Way for the Advancement of <HI>Mor∣decai</HI>
his Enemy, at the very critical Time
When he thought his Designs ripe for sinking
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
him into Ruin: And his cruel Scheme for
the Destruction of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s whole Nation,
prov'd the Occasion of their being raised above
<HI>all</HI> their Enemies. <HI>There are many devices in
the heart of a man, but the counsel of the Lord
shall stand</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix. 21.</NOTE>. He, <HI>connecting</HI> together each
Link in the Chain of Events that fill up our
Life, by an unexpected <HI>Contexture</HI> of Causes,
makes those Things which we most deplore
<HI>bring on</HI> our better Days: And, in the dark
Bosom of Misfortune, gradually <HI>ripens</HI> the la∣tent
Seeds of future Prosperity.—How fre∣quently
have the Attempts of Enemies to run
down and <HI>blacken</HI> good Men by all the Arts
of Malice, made their Character shine the
<HI>fairer</HI> in the Eye of the impartial World?
How frequently have the <HI>Extremities</HI> to which
they have been driven by Injustice and Vio∣lence,
prov'd the Occasion of calling forth
their <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Activity,</HI> and of putting
them upon such <HI>Efforts</HI> to do themselves Ju∣stice,
as have raised them higher than ever
they fell? How many, in the Course of their
Life, have had Reason to be <HI>thankful</HI> for be∣ing
disappointed by the Wrath of their Ene∣mies,
in Designs, which, perhaps, they very
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<HI>earnestly</HI> pursued; but which, if they had
<HI>succcessfully</HI> accomplish'd, they have afterwards
seen would have prov'd their <HI>Ruin? Whoso is
wise and will observe these things, even he shall
understand the loving-kindness of the Lord</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. cvii. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if thus, in <HI>private</HI> Life, the <HI>wrath of
man</HI> is often made to praise GOD, by becom∣ing
the Occasion of greater Good; still more
is the Hand of GOD apparent, in the Ends of
<HI>publick Benefit</HI> it is made to serve, to <HI>Nations</HI>
and <HI>Societies.</HI>—The Rage of Civil Wars, the
Oppression of Tyrants, and all the other dis∣mal
Effects of the Ambition and Wrath of
Man, have often sung the Praise of GOD to
many succeeding Generations. Thence have
been made to spring, publick <HI>Liberty</HI> to a
People, wise <HI>Government,</HI> good <HI>Order,</HI> and
lasting <HI>Peace.</HI> Nations have been thereby a∣waken'd
to see their <HI>true Interests;</HI> and taught
more effectually to <HI>secure</HI> them. Publick Af∣fairs
being once thrown into a <HI>Ferment,</HI> the
Corruptions of Government, like bad Hu∣mours
in the Body, have been purg'd and
wrought off. The Feeling of grievous Op∣pression
has frequently been the first Thing
that made Nations <HI>shake off</HI> the <HI>Yoke;</HI> and
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
led them to assert their own <HI>just Rights</HI> against
tyrannical Governors; <HI>which,</HI> had their Ty∣ranny
been less insolent, these Nations would
have remain'd longer, perhaps for ever, <HI>de∣priv'd
of.</HI> Of this we have a memorable Ex∣ample
in the late glorious and happy <HI>Revolu∣tion</HI>
in our own Country. Our Constitution,
and its Liberties, might have been <HI>insensibly
undermined,</HI> and <HI>ruined,</HI> had it not been for
the glaring and open Violation of Laws with
a high Hand; which proclaiming all to be <HI>then</HI>
at Stake, rouz'd up the Spirits of Men to
rnake a determin'd Stand against incroaching
<HI>Tyranny:</HI> and thus gave Birth to that <HI>free</HI>
and <HI>legal Establishment,</HI> with which we at
this Day are blessed; and for which, we hope,
late Posterity after us, shall continue to bless
the Providence of GOD. Had it not been for
the <HI>avow'd</HI> Attempts then made against our
Religion. and our fundamental Rights <HI>Britain</HI>
might have been now under a <HI>Popish</HI> Sove∣reign:
and, instead of that mild and tempe∣rate
Administration we have enjoyed, under a
Series of Princes who have always made the
Law their Rule, we would have been the
Subjects, or rather <HI>Slaves,</HI> of those who arro∣gantly
claim us as their <HI>Property</HI> by <HI>Divine
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Right.</HI> In like Manner, the Tyranny and
Violence of <HI>Tarquin,</HI> produced the illustrious
and victorious Commonwealth of <HI>Rome.</HI> The
Oppression of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> laid the
Foundation of the Liberty of the <HI>United Pro∣vinces;</HI>
and Liberty, from a few inconside∣rable
Fisher-towns, has raised them to the
most flourishing Height of Trade and Opu∣lence.
—As to the first <HI>Establishment</HI> of Free∣dom,
so to the further <HI>Security</HI> of a publick
Interest, unjust and violent Designs have been
often subservient. Attempts to <HI>overthrow</HI> a
good Government, have generally <HI>strength∣ned</HI>
it more. By these its false Friends are
<HI>unmasked</HI> and brought to Light; its secret
Foes suffer for their Treachery: the <HI>Zeal</HI> of
its Well-wishers is awakened and increased;
and, from what is felt of the <HI>Violence</HI> and
<HI>Outrage</HI> of its Enemies, People are more con∣firm'd
in <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of their Designs, and
made more justly to prize the Blessings of
<HI>Tranquillity</HI> and <HI>legal Protection.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER, the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> in the <HI>Per∣secution</HI>
of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> signally praises
GOD, when it is made to turn to the greater
<HI>Advancement</HI> of Religion, and further Propa∣gation
of Truth.—The Church of GOD, since
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
the Days of its Infancy, hath never been free
from the World's Wrath; and yet, in these
Ages in which it was most <HI>persecuted,</HI> it hath
most <HI>flourished.</HI> In vain, the Policy and the
Rage of the World united their Strength, to
extinguish this Divine Light. Tho' all the
four Winds blew against it, it only shone the
brighter; and flam'd the higher: <HI>Many wa∣ters
could not quench it, nor all the floods drown
it:</HI> and the Blood of the Martyrs, as has
been often and justly said, was the Seed of
the Church. The <HI>Zeal</HI> of the primitive Chri∣stians,
their <HI>Constancy</HI> and <HI>Fortitude</HI> in gi∣ving
Testimony to Truth, and their chearful
<HI>Patience</HI> in suffering for it, did much more
to <HI>increase</HI> the Number of Converts to true
Religion, than all the <HI>Terror</HI> and <HI>Cruelty</HI> of
Persecutors could ever do to <HI>lessen</HI> it. The At∣tempts
that were used to bear down Religion,
only enlarg'd its Triumphs, by displaying the
victorious Force of Truth. By this Means
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> was made to turn <HI>against it∣self,</HI>
to the Destruction of its own Purpose;—
like Waves, that, assaulting a Rock with im∣potent
Fury, discover its immoveable Stabi∣lity,
whilst they dash themselves in Pieces at
its Feet. Prosperity, Greatness, and worldly
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Favour may have corrupted Religion, and
sullied the Purity of the Church: But, never
did the <HI>wrath of man</HI> try to overthrow it, but
in the Issue it made its own Weakness appear;
and rais'd the <HI>praise of God,</HI> by purifying the
Church, and advancing Religion more.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add one Instance more of
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> praising GOD, by accom∣plishing
Ends of most extensive Benefit: and
that is, <HI>the Death of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.—Ne∣ver
did Malice, Rage and Envy please them∣selves
with the Thoughts of having obtain'd
a more complete Triumph, than in this Case.
JESUS was now put to Death; the Revenge
of his Enemies gratified; his Name, and his
Honour, they believ'd, rooted out from a∣mongst
Men;—yet, behold how vain the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> is! all that they intended to
<HI>overthrow,</HI> they most effectually <HI>confirm'd.</HI>
The <HI>Ignominy</HI> of the Cross became the
Standard of <HI>eternal Honour</HI> to CHRIST, and
his Religion: and his <HI>Death,</HI> perpetrated by
them as a wicked Murder, was, in the Coun∣sel
of GOD, the Spring of <HI>everlasting Life</HI> to
all his Followers. He, who <HI>restrains the
Remainder of Wrath</HI> at his Pleasure, suffer'd
their Rage to suggest no <HI>other</HI> Things to them,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
than what himself had long before determin'd,
and his Prophets foretold, should be so done.
So that they all <HI>conspir'd</HI> to render the whole
most exactly conformable to his <HI>original Plan</HI>
of Mercy and Goodness; and each contri∣buted
his <HI>Share,</HI> to finish that great Work,
which none of them <HI>knew</HI> any thing of, nor
in the least <HI>intended.</HI>—So <HI>glorious</HI> an Instance
as this, fully <HI>ascertain'd</HI> and laid out to us in
Scripture, of the <HI>wrath of man</HI> ministring to
the gracious Designs of Heaven, ought to
have the greatest Weight; as an <HI>Exemplifica∣tion</HI>
of the Conduct of Providence in ma∣ny
<HI>other Cases,</HI> where we have not so much
Light afforded us for the Discovery of its
Ways.</P>
<P>AND now, by this Induction of Particulars,
you see, upon the whole, how much Ground
there is for asserting, that the <HI>wrath of man
shall praise God;</HI> that all the Disorders
which the Passion and Pride of Men occasion
in the World, tho' they take their first <HI>Rise</HI>
from the Corruption of human Nature, are so
<HI>order'd,</HI> as to become Parts of a wise and
good Constitution, redounding to his Honour
and Glory, who hath order'd all.—Either illustrating
before the World, his <HI>Divine Per∣fections,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
in the Government of Things;—or
serving the Purposes of <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>religious
Improvement</HI> to the Souls of Men;—or by
some secret Tendency, <HI>working out Prosperity
and Happiness</HI> to those whom they seem most
to threaten with Suffering and Evil.—<HI>Surely,
O GOD, the wrath of man. shall praise thee!
the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain!</HI>
"In thy Hand it is; and thou never lets it
forth but in <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure.</HI> It is
<HI>wild</HI> and <HI>intractable</HI> in its Nature; but thou
<HI>tamest</HI> it: <HI>blind</HI> and <HI>headlong</HI> in its Im∣pulse;
but thou <HI>directest</HI> it: ever <HI>struggling</HI>
to break its Chain, knowing no Bounds; but
thou <HI>confinest</HI> it: Thou <HI>retrenchest</HI> all the
<HI>Superfluity of its Fury!"</HI>—Let us now
consider, what is the Improvement to be made
of this Meditation on the Ways of Providence.</P>
<P>1. Let it lead us to a religious Contempla∣tion
of the <HI>Hand of God,</HI> in all the Occurren∣ces
and Transactions of the World. We be∣hold
a very mixed and busy Scene of Things
passing before us: the Passions of Men vari∣ously
agitated and new Changes daily brought
forth upon this Stage of Time. We behold
Peace and War taking their Turns: the
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Fortunes of private Men rising and falling:
and Nations and Kingdoms partaking in the
same Fluctuation and Vicissitude. In all this,
if we look no farther than to the Operation
of external Causes, and the mere Rotation of,
Events, we behold only the dead Side of Na∣ture;
—stop at the Surface of Things;—
contemplate them not like rational and religi∣ous
Beings. The <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> of the U∣niverse
arises from the View of that Wisdom
and Goodness, which <HI>animates</HI> and <HI>conducts</HI>
the whole; and <HI>unites</HI> all the Parts in one
great Design. There is an eternal Mind that
puts all these Wheels in Motion; himself re∣maining
for ever at Rest. Of him we are to
conceive not as removed from this World;
sitting, a mere Spectator of his Creatures, in
his high Abode: but as an omnipresent Spi∣rit,
<HI>pervading, directing,</HI> and <HI>regulating</HI> all;
ever busy without <HI>Toil,</HI> and working without
<HI>Weariness!</HI> Nothing is void of him: even in
the Passions and Ragings of Men, GOD is to
be found: and when they think they guide
themselves, his Hand controuls and guides
them still.—To what serious and solemn
Thoughts are we led by such a View as this;
when we attend not merely to the Actings of
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
Men, but to the Ways of GOD; deeply im∣press'd
with the Belief, that we and all our
Concerns are Parts of his great Admini∣stration!</P>
<P>2. FROM what has been said we see, that
we ought not to be shaken in our Minds,
by any present <HI>seeming Disorders</HI> of the
World, so as on Account of them to think ill
of Providence. Many Things, doubtless, there
are, which appear as <HI>Blemishes</HI> in the general
Order, to a superficial View; and which, if
we were to regulate the World, we think
should have <HI>no Place</HI> in it. And yet, these
various Instances, which we <HI>see,</HI> and can clear∣ly
<HI>trace,</HI> of the Workings of Passion and Wic∣kedness,
render'd subservient to worthy and
good Ends, give us the highest Reason to con∣clude,
that, in all other Cases of seeming Evil,
the like Ends are promoted. This ought to sa∣tisfy
our Minds, even where the Prospect is most
<HI>discouraging,</HI> and the State of human Affairs
most <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>embroil'd.</HI> The Schemes of Di∣vine
Wisdom are too <HI>large</HI> and <HI>comprehensive,</HI>
to be discerned by us, in all their Extent, at
one View; and, where we see only by <HI>Parts,</HI>
we must be often at a Loss to judge of the
<HI>Whole. The way of God is in the sea, and
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
his path in the great waters: his footsteps are
not known<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxvii. 19.</NOTE>. Although thou sayest thou
canst not see him, yet judgment is still before
him, therefore trust thou in him</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE>. His it
is, to educe Good from Ill, Order from Con∣fuision,
his own just Praise from Man's Wrath.
As in the natural World, there is no <HI>real</HI> De∣formity;
nothing but what has either its own
Ornament or Use: so, the most irregular and
deformed <HI>Appearances</HI> in the moral World,
shall be made to <HI>heighten</HI> the Beauty of the
whole: And, in the End, <HI>all</HI> the Works of
GOD shall appear to be perfect. GOD <HI>binds</HI>
together the most opposite and disagreeing
Principles in the Laws of universal <HI>Concord:</HI>
and <HI>adapts,</HI> even the most harsh and discor∣dant
Notes, to the <HI>Harmony</HI> of his Goodness.
As he hath rear'd the goodly Frame of Na∣ture,
from <HI>various</HI> and <HI>jarring</HI> Elements, and
hath settled it in Peace; so he hath formed
such an <HI>Union,</HI> by his Providence, of the <HI>more
various</HI> Interests, and <HI>more jarring</HI> Passions of
Men, that they all <HI>conspire</HI> to his Glory, and
<HI>co-operate</HI> for the general Good.—How a∣mazing
is that Wisdom, which comprehends
such infinite <HI>Diversities,</HI> and <HI>Contrarieties,</HI> with∣in
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
its Scheme! How powerful that Hand,
which <HI>bends</HI> to its own Purpose, the Good and
the Bad, the Busy and the Idle, the Friends
and the Foes of GOD; which makes them <HI>all</HI>
hold on their Course to his Glory, tho' <HI>divid∣ed
from one another</HI> by a Multiplicity of Pur∣suits,
and <HI>differing</HI> often <HI>from themselves;</HI> and
whilst they all move themselves at their <HI>own
Freedom,</HI> yet, by a secret Influence, winds
and turns them at <HI>his Will! O the depth of
the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God! how unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past finding out</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 33.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>3. From what has been said, we see the
greatest Reason for <HI>entire Submission</HI> to the
Will of Heaven, amidst all Sufferings from
the <HI>Wrath</HI> and Violence of Men. These be∣fal
us not <HI>in vain:</HI> they are not to be con∣sidered
as mere Effects of the arbitrary <HI>Plea∣sure</HI>
and <HI>Will of Men:</HI> nor are we to believe
ourselves the <HI>Sport</HI> of <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Passion.</HI>
But, good Designs are <HI>going on:</HI> GOD is al∣ways
carrying forward his <HI>own Ends:</HI> And if
we are certainly assured that all is tending to
<HI>his Glory,</HI> which is ever the same with the
<HI>general Good,</HI> is not this a sufficient Reason for
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
the most peaceable <HI>Acquiescence</HI> on our Part?
Ought not we, as <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Whole,</HI> chear∣fully
to resign our <HI>private</HI> Interest, to the
Advancement of a <HI>higher</HI> and more <HI>general
Good?</HI>—But moreover, by this Resignation,
our <HI>own Interest</HI> shall suffer nothing in the Is∣sue.
For the greatest Happiness of <HI>every</HI> good
Man, of <HI>each Individual,</HI> as well as of <HI>the
whole,</HI> is comprehended in that <HI>Praise</HI> which
the <HI>wrath of man</HI> is decreed to yield to GOD.
—Hence ought to arise, not unreluctant <HI>Sub∣mission</HI>
only, but the most exalted <HI>Joy</HI> in the
Divine Administration, to all who are pious
and virtuous. In <HI>all Events,</HI> their Interest is
secur'd; and the severest Trials of Life are to
them Matter even of <HI>Thankfulness</HI> and <HI>Grati∣tude,</HI>
when view'd in their just Light. For,
in these very Trials, their Advantage is <HI>consult∣ed;</HI>
by them is their Good <HI>promoted;</HI> and the
most hurtful Designs of the Wrath of Man are
<HI>converted</HI> into <HI>Benefits</HI> and <HI>Blessings.</HI>—Let this
be enough to reconcile our Minds to every
Part of our Lot; and to establish them in the
most comforting <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Confidence,</HI> in
GOD, in the Way of our Duty.—<HI>If God be
for us who,</HI> or what, <HI>can be against us?</HI> He
who can defeat all the Purposes of our <HI>Enemies,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
and transform their <HI>intended Evil</HI> unto <HI>real
Good,</HI> is certainly the most powerful <HI>Friend:</HI>
And if <HI>his Wrath</HI> be once, appeas'd, there is
no <HI>other Wrath</HI> from which we have ought
to fear.</P>
<P>4. FROM all that has been said of the Con∣duct
of Providence, let us observe, how much
Reason there is for acknowledging with Thank∣fulness
the Hand of GOD, in all these <HI>Delive∣rances,</HI>
which we obtain from the <HI>wrath of
man.</HI> As we ought never to forget, when we
suffer by human Violence, that it is his Hand
which <HI>corrects</HI> us; so, when that Violence re∣ceives
a Check, we ought to remember, it is
his Hand which <HI>restrains</HI> it. In <HI>both</HI> these,
the <HI>wrath of man,</HI> either <HI>permitted,</HI> or <HI>re∣strain'd,</HI>
praises GOD: and we have seen him
remarkably prais'd <HI>in both.</HI>—Through all the
Steps of our late <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and our present
happy <HI>Deliverance,</HI> such a <HI>Series</HI> of Divine
Wisdom hath appear'd, as must present, to the
Observation of every <HI>considering</HI> Spectator, a ve∣ry
<HI>beautiful Scene</HI> in the History of Providence.
—GOD beheld a Nation, whom he had fa∣voured
with long Tranquillity and Peace, sunk,
by that Peace and Tranquillity, into <HI>Luxury</HI>
and <HI>Corruption of Manners.</HI> He had bless'd
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
them with a happy Constitution, a mild Go∣vernment,
and equal Laws; but long Enjoy∣ment
had <HI>deaden'd</HI> their <HI>Sense</HI> of so invaluable
a Blessing, and fed a <HI>giddy</HI> and <HI>factious Spi∣rit.</HI>
He had distinguish'd them with the
purest Enjoyment of pure Religion above most
Nations of the Earth; but their religious Pri∣vileges,
<HI>once</HI> struggled for with Zeal, began
to be <HI>contemn'd</HI> and their <HI>first Love to cool.</HI>—
Behold, how <HI>opportunely</HI> GOD sent forth the
<HI>wrath of man,</HI> to work a Cure for all these
Evils;—to shake <HI>that Peace</HI> which had foster∣ed
<HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Impiety</HI> under its Wings; to
threaten <HI>that Religion,</HI> and <HI>that Government,</HI>
to the Blessings of which we had beeninsen∣sible;
and to display before us these Terrors
of <HI>oppressive Power,</HI> and <HI>persecuting Religion,</HI>
to the Danger of which we had been laid
asleep:—He made us <HI>feel</HI> the Value of all we
should have lost;—he made the Evil to grow
<HI>sudden</HI> and <HI>unexpected,</HI> from amongst ourselves,
and allowing it to proceed so far, as might be
sufficient to <HI>awaken</HI> the Nation, and to ren∣der
us <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>wise,</HI> he then gave a signal
Check to the <HI>wrath of man;</HI> and <HI>restrain'd the
remainder of it,</HI> after it had gone the Length
which he saw meet. Our Enemies boasted
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
of the <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Countenance</HI> of Heaven:
<HI>Countenanced</HI> they were by Heaven, but not
for their <HI>own Sakes;</HI> and the Success permit∣ted
them for a Time, was meant for the <HI>Im∣provement</HI>
and <HI>Benefit</HI> of <HI>those,</HI> whom they in∣tended
to <HI>destroy.</HI> When the proper <HI>Season</HI>
was come, for GOD to assert his own Cause,
then he rais'd up an illustrious <HI>Deliverer,</HI>
whom, for a Blessing to his Country, he had
prepared against this <HI>Time of Need.</HI> HIM, he
crowned with the Graces of his <HI>Right-hand:</HI>
to the conspicuous <HI>Bravery</HI> of early <HI>Youth,</HI> he
added that <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which, in
others, is the Fruit only of <HI>long Experience;</HI>
and distinguish'd Him with all those <HI>Qualities</HI>
which render the <HI>Man,</HI> amiable; as well, as the
HERO, Great: He sent him forth to be the
<HI>Terror</HI> of his Foes, the <HI>Confidence</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of
his Friends; and, in the Day of Danger and
Death, commanded the <HI>Shields of Angels</HI> to be
spread around him!—What Heart, in which
the Love of BRITISH Liberty remains, <HI>warms</HI>
not at the Mention of his Name?—Whose
Bosom overflows not with <HI>Gratitude,</HI> when
he looks back upon the late dark and melan∣choly
Scenes of <HI>Oppression</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> and
surveys the fair Prospect now open'd, by this
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
chosen <HI>Instrument</HI> of our Deliverance, of <HI>Peace</HI>
restored, <HI>Liberty</HI> flourishing, and <HI>Religion</HI>
safe?—Let us lift up our Eyes to Heaven,
and say, <HI>This is the doing of the Lord, and it
is marvellous in our eyes</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxviii. 23.</NOTE>!—HIM, the
<HI>wrath of man</HI> hath indeed signally <HI>prais'd,</HI> in
our Land: <HI>Prais'd</HI> him, when it rag'd; and
<HI>prais'd</HI> him, when it fell!—<HI>When he arose, his
enemies were scattered; as smoke is driven a∣way,
and as chaff before the wind.—Give unto
the Lord, ye mighty, give unto the Lord glo∣ry
and strength</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxix. 1.</NOTE>! <HI>He breaketh the bow, and
cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
chariot in fire</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlvi. 9.</NOTE>. <HI>His excellency is over
Israel: his strength is in the clouds: He giv∣eth
strength and victory to his people</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxviii. 34, 35.</NOTE>.
—PRAISE <HI>ye the</HI> LORD.</P>
