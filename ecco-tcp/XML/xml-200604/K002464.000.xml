<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Person more Odi∣ous than the Man who makes himself greatly Eminent. It is a sort of tacit Reproach on the rest of the Species: and every one feels his own meanness the more sensibly, when he looks toward those exalted Genius's, who have gain'd a Superi∣ority over the rest of mankind. This may make it obvious to imagine, that the following Dialogues are partly design'd as Invectives; and produc'd chiefly from that Blind-side in Self∣love, which makes Men willing to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rogate from every one, who has <HI>merit</HI> enough, to provoke; and <HI>fame</HI> enough, to make others think them∣selves lessen'd by the overgrowth of his Character.</P>
<P>Tho' this reasoning be exceedingly true in general, it ought to be consider'd
<PB REF="3"/>
at the same time, that any dislike to the Eminence of others na∣turally arises, only among such per∣sons, as are got into the same paths of Fame. The Gentlemen of the Sword cannot bear to have others rise over their head; the Men of Genius look maliciously on a prevailing Poet: But <HI>Pope,</HI> I presume, never envied <HI>Marlborough</HI> the Battle of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> any more than that Hero envied him his Translation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis for this Reason I might almost sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that I <HI>cannot</HI> envy Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar at least I am unbiass'd; I can hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Applauses, which are given that Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Man; I can admire the Passa∣ges, which contribute to the deserv∣ing them; but I cannot be uneasy at those, or detract from these, out of any prejudices arising from this Pas∣sion. Give me leave to say farther, that in reading that Work of his, which occasion'd this Essay, no one cou'd be more delighted, than I was, in several parts of it. Many Beauties I saw in it; and I imagin'd I saw some
<PB REF="4"/>
Faults: In some particular Conversa∣tions on this Head, I have found my self indifferent in the Case: and now I have here flung the Thoughts on both together, I hope, with some de∣gree of Impartiality. But if some things shou'd be blamed without suf∣ficient Reason, or others commended too highly, and in a manner dispro∣portion'd to what they deserve, I sub∣mit each to the many better judges, who may happen to meet with these sheets. I ask pardon for any Errors in them: I beg to be set right.</P>
<P>Prefaces, I think, are the only pla∣ces in which a Man may be allow'd to talk freely of that worst of sub∣jects, <HI>Himself:</HI> I hope no body will deny one the use of so <HI>aukward a Pri∣vilege;</HI> and shall therefore go on with∣out any farther Apologies.</P>
<P>To many it may perhaps seem ar∣rogant to find fault at all with so di∣stinguish'd and so noble a Poet as Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> Indeed here are some things proposed as faulty from his Translati∣on; but they are only proposed: the
<PB REF="5"/>
World is to judge of them. Where I have been mistaken in any of these Points, it is not for want of a due de∣ference to the merits of this Writer; but from the shortness of my own sight. On the contrary, if any such Criti∣cisms happen sometimes to be right, the Eminence of the Poet will be so far from being a reason against them, that it makes any true Cautions the more proper, and in some sense per∣fectly necessary.</P>
<P>Besides: The learned World, as I take it, have ever allow'd a Liberty of thinking and of speaking one's sen∣timents. That <HI>serene Republick</HI> knows none of the distance and distinctions which custom has introduced into all others. There is a decent familiari∣ty to be admitted between the Great∣est and the Meanest Person in it. This has often raised a Thought in me, which has something wild and agree∣able in it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when indulged to any de∣gree: 'Tis in Relation to the peculi∣ar happiness of Men of Letters; in that they can sit down in their closets
<PB REF="6"/>
and converse with the greatest Wri∣ters of every Age, or of any Nation; and that in as much freedom and in∣timacy, as their nearest Friends cou'd ever use toward any of them, when living. What an illustrious Assembly is there on those Shelves? The Courts of <HI>Augustus, Lewis</HI> the Four∣teenth, or <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, never beheld such a frequency of great Ge∣nius's, as stand round a Man in his own private Study. How large an Happiness is it for a Person to have it in his Power to say at any time, That he is going to spend the After∣noon with the most agreeable and most improving Company, he will chuse out of all Ages? If he is in a gay Humour, perhaps with <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Anacreon,</HI> and L<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Dorset;</HI> or if more solid, either with <HI>Plato,</HI> Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> or Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis this ease of access, 'tis the li∣berty arising from it, which consti∣tutes and preserves the felicity of the <HI>Republick</HI> of Letters. The meaner sort, which compose it, are all Freevoters;
<PB REF="7"/>
and may speak their real Opinion without reserve: at the same time the Characters too, even of the greatest and first Men in it, must be form'd and establish'd on this open∣ness of Judging, and that freedom of Observation.</P>
<P>But waving whatever has been said of this Liberty in the Learned World, most people will be apt to help one to an Excuse of another kind: for most, I think, are very ready to agree, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is only the Master-hand in this Translation; and that he has been obliged with the assistance of some other Gentle∣men in several parts of it. Tho', I believe, I am acquainted with this affair more than many who speak of it with a great deal of Confidence and Assurance, any mention of it in the Piece is purposely avoided. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has recommended the whole with his Name; He gives the finish∣ing stroke to every thing: and the Dialogues speak of him, as if he were really the Author of the whole. It
<PB REF="8"/>
wou'd have been a confused thing, and often not practicable, to have spoken at every turn to the right Per∣son. This has occasion'd several ap∣plauses of the Poet, which may seem too high for a stranger: But as I have since had the greatest reason to be perswaded, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is not the sole Translator; I have at the same time equal reason to think, that the other Gentlemen engaged are persons of establish'd Characters in the Po∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick World.—After this, perhaps, those Compliments may still be al∣low'd to stand, as they are: I hope they are never wrought too high for Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> himself; and I believe they may generally be spoken very justly of his <HI>Seconds</HI> in the Work.</P>
<P>One word more, and I have done. As to the manner of these Dialogues; 'Tis the old <HI>Platonick</HI> way, which <HI>Cicero</HI> brought from <HI>Greece,</HI> and used so happily in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue. It has had its Successes too among the Moderns: <HI>Fontenelle</HI> will always be read with the greatest Pleasure, where
<PB REF="9"/>
he has follow'd it; That Writer is peculiarly happy in all his Dialogues, of whatever sort; and, in general, may be said <HI>to talk as well with Pen and Ink,</HI> as any Man in the World. Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> have recom∣mended it among us by their Exam∣ple. Indeed the method it self is more capable of variety, and (which makes it particularly proper for the present Case) it hath something of Action and Reality in it. Besides that the common way among us of merely keeping up a Discourse be∣tween two blind Names, is perhaps not very Commendable: the Persons of the Dialogue in such Cases are ge∣nerally like those Actors, who have no Character in the Play; and who only come in <HI>to talk</HI> upon the Stage. They have no more distinction, no other marks by which you may know one from another, than the two <HI>Capital Letters,</HI> which usually stand for them. It is much otherwise, and and much better, among the Persons introduced by the Writers in the other
<PB REF="10"/>
method: their Great Names I use only to authorize this <HI>manner</HI> of Dia∣logue, as that is all which I can pre∣tend to imitate in them.</P>
<P>As I ought to beg pardon of the Reader, for troubling him with so long a Preface; I shall at the same time take the opportunity of begging Pardon of <HI>Antiphaus</HI> and <HI>Philypsus,</HI> (the two Gentlemen who are dis∣guised under the Persons of these Dia∣logues) for giving to the World, what was chiefly their Thoughts, in a manner so much inferiour to what either of them might have done them∣selves. I wish I might have leave to mention their real Names in this place: That would add a weight to every thing they say. Tho' indeed the Sentiments of those Gentlemen, were they fully represented, would not want the lustre of any Authorities to set them off; except that of the the Reasonableness with which they both <HI>think</HI> and <HI>speak;</HI> and for both which they have made themselves so remarkable in the World.</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">EVENING the FIRST.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>NTIPHAUS</HI> manag'd his Affairs so as to get this Winter sooner than usual to the Country-seat of his Friend <HI>Philypsus.</HI> It is there that he passes his time, when ever he can clear himself from the hurry of Business, in a retirement every way agreeable; and in a full en∣joyment of those Pleasures, which at∣tend on a particular Friendship, in an open and improving Conversation. The Conversation there does not run in the present polite way of <HI>saying and saying nothing;</HI> when alone, they usually fall in∣to some Points of Learning; and as bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of them are particularly fond of Poetry,
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
their Disputes turn more frequently on that Subject, than any other. Indeed their differing in Sentiment can scarce be call'd <HI>Disputes;</HI> for whenever their Thoughts do not meet, each of them shews a diffidence in his own Opinion, and a willingness to submit to the Judg∣ment of his Friend.</P>
<P>It is by this means that they fall in∣to each others Sentiments, more than cou'd well be expected from Men of so different a Turn. The enlarged Geni∣us of <HI>Philypsus</HI> always led him to dwell upon the most beautified Parts of a Poem with the greatest Pleasure; while <HI>Anti∣phaüs,</HI> who has a very clear Head, and has given much into a strict way of think∣ing, is taken most with just Descriptions, and plain natural Ideas: The one was so possest with the Pleasure which he felt from fine Thoughts and warm Expres∣sions, that He did not take a full Satis∣faction in low Beauty, and simple Re∣presentations of Nature; the other, on the contrary, had such an aversion to <HI>glitterings</HI> and <HI>elevation,</HI> that he was distasted at any the least appearance of either. If the latter was prejudiced for the Ancients, from the Purity and Just∣ness, which we find in most of their Works; <HI>Philypsus</HI> had his <HI>foible</HI> too, and
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
was sometimes caught by the Flourish and Colouring of the Moderns. In a word, if <HI>Philypsus</HI> wou'd sometimes con∣temn a Point as low and mean, tho' in reality proper enough, and naturally ex∣press'd; <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> in his turn, might happen now and then to blame a Passage which requir'd a good degree of Orna∣ment, as being too glaring and artificial.</P>
<P>Among several other Topicks, one Evening, they happen'd to fall into a discourse on Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s new Translation of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> As they both found Beau∣ties in that Piece agreeable to their par∣ticular Tastes, they had read it over with a great deal of Pleasure: however <HI>Philypsus</HI> was the Person who admired it the most. "There are some Lines, says he to <HI>Antiphaus</HI> (pointing to the <HI>Odyssey</HI> which lay before them) there are some Favourites of mine in that Poem, which you must not look upon with your usual severity: Prithee <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> be more sensible to the Flame and Spirit of a Writer, who is evidently Our present <HI>Laureate in Genius,</HI> and the most enliven'd Translator of the Age. "I will very readily allow what you say of that Great Man, return'd <HI>Antiphaus;</HI> and shall al∣ways pay a deference to your more live∣ly taste of the Fine and Sublime in Poetry;
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
but you must give me leave to dis∣sent from you in some Particulars: if I do not agree with your Sentiments, in relation to several Lines and Passages of that Translation, 'tis perhaps because I fall so much short of you, in your <HI>inward sense</HI> of the high and elevated Beauties of Language. As I cannot imagine that to be the reason, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> I beg to hear those Particulars you talk'd of; I am perswaded, several of the Passages, which I have observ'd you to be less taken with in reading the Translation, will upon a closer view appear to be really Beauties; to tell you the truth, I long to make a Convert of you; and beg you wou'd be full and large in com∣municating whatever Remarks you have made on this Performance. The Eve∣nings are long; we have sufficient time upon our Hands; and I know not how we can pass it away more agreeably.</P>
<P><HI>Antiphaus</HI> paus'd for some time, and seem'd to be taken up in recollecting his Thoughts on this Point: at last taking a Tablet out of his Pocket, <Q>Since you desire it (says he) I will shew you what Observations I made as I went over the Work; they are the Thoughts which struck me <HI>en passant,</HI> and many of them will perhaps appear little and trifling.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="15"/>
You will allow me, I believe, in the first place, That Lines very good in themselves, may be bad when consider'd as a Translation. The aim of a Tran∣slator is to give us the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Ori∣ginal; and where the Original is just, the very <HI>manner</HI> is to be observ'd. By the Manner, I would not intend the ex∣press words, or the meer turn of a Peri∣od; but that the Imitation ought to be easy, simple, and unadorn'd, wherever the first Writer uses either of those Styles with Judgment. You are well ac∣quainted with that plain humble manner of <HI>Homer,</HI> which is more particularly kept up by him in the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> And as much as I admire several parts in this Tran∣slation, I cannot but think there are places in it, which differ from the Man∣ner of <HI>Homer,</HI> without sufficient reason for a Change. The Poet, in several parts of that Work, seems to me to have let fall some Lines that are forc'd; some of too much flourish, and ornament; and a few, even swelling, and unnatural; where the Original is with good reason plain, and natural, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd unadorn'd.</P>
<P>Where we admire the Simplicity of <HI>Homer</HI> with Justice, we cannot avoid blaming the want of it in his Translator. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> intimates in one of his <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 14. 1.</NOTE> Notes,
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
<HI>That</HI> no Reproach has ever fall'n up∣on <HI>Homer,</HI> in relation to his sinking too Low, or being too Familiar; That as to these Particulars he preserves an Uni∣versal Justness: and that there is not any one place in his Poem, which can be just∣ly censur'd upon this account. If so, a Translator of <HI>Homer</HI> has no occasion for raising any thing, beyond what it is in the Original; If he follows his Master it is sufficient: All additional Flourish and Glitterings, where we should meet with the plain and the familiar, are at best so many beautiful Excrescencies.</P>
<P>There is one Case, which seems more particularly to lead Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> into a gla∣ring Stile: 'tis almost ever to be found in his Descriptions of <HI>Day,</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> and of the <HI>Morning.</HI> 'Tis true, these are subjects which in themselves may require some brightness in the language; but there is a great difference between giv∣ing one Light, and dazling ones Eyes. Beside the conformity to the Original, there is another certain and easy way of judging, whether the Brightning in these or any other Points, be proper or not: that Light, we may be sure, falls in a wrong manner, or an undue proportion, which does not make the thing more visible.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="17"/>
There are of these Descriptions, <HI>Phi∣lypsus,</HI> which seem both to refine too much upon the Original, and to err ac∣cording to this Rule. Did you ever ob∣serve those lines on one of the most a∣greeable Images in the World, The break of Day? they are in the beginning of the third Book: If you will give me leave, I will read them to you.</P>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>sacred</HI> Sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above the Waters rais'd,</L>
<L><HI>Thro' Heaven's</HI> eternal, brazen Portals blaz'd;</L>
<L>And wide o'er Earth diffus'd his <HI>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring</HI> Ray,</L>
<L>To Gods and Men, to <HI>give the golden Day.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>Several of these Expressions seemed to me at first sight to take from the Nature and Simplicity of the Description; and when I turn'd to the Greek, I found those very Expressions to have no Foun∣dation there. 'Tis the same Case in the following Lines:</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Translat. Book 4, V. 411. Orig. δ' 306.</NOTE> Soon as the Morn, in <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Purple drest,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unbarr'd the Portal</HI> of the roseate East &amp;c.</L>
<L><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 13, 112. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 93.</NOTE>—When the Morning-Star with early Ray</L>
<L>Flam'd in the front of Heaven, &amp;c.—</L>
</LG>
<P>You will find these short Sketches in <HI>Homer</HI> to be much more simple and natural:
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
I leave it to your Judgment, whe∣ther they appear better with these Co∣lourings, or not. To add one Instance more of the same thing. Is it more pro∣per for <HI>Circe</HI> to tell <HI>Ulysses,</HI> That he should stay that Night with her, and <HI>set sail the next Morning?</HI> or to hear her giving him leave, to</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 12, 35. μ' 24.—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</NOTE>Spread his broad Sails, and <HI>plough the liquid way,</HI></L>
<L>Soon as the Morn <HI>unveils her Saffron Ray.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I must own, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> this would have been more fit for the Description of a Voyage, than for a Speech: in a Place too, where we only find Orders given for setting Sail at such a time.</P>
<P>To me, proceeded <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> seems to Beautify too much in several o∣ther Points, beside those Topicks we have been talking of: as where he calls the Nobles of <HI>Phoeacia,</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 6, 306. ζ' 257.</NOTE> <HI>A radiant Band</HI> of Noblemen; and where he introduces <HI>Helen</HI> with <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. 4, 158. δ' 121.</NOTE> <HI>a Gale of rich Perfume breathing before her.</HI> If <HI>Homer</HI> mentions <HI>Cups of solid Gold;</HI> in Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI></P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">B. 1, 188. α' 142.</NOTE>The Gold gives <HI>lustre</HI> to the <HI>purple</HI> Draught:</L>
<L><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">B. 3, 601. γ' 472.</NOTE>And in the <HI>dazling</HI> Goblet <HI>laughs</HI> the Wine.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="19"/>
You cannot but observe, by the way, that the Original here is designed to sig∣nify the <HI>real</HI> intrinsick Value; while only the <HI>outside</HI> and more glittering Cir∣cumstances are what the <HI>English</HI> dwells upon entirely: but to go on.—The Horns of a Bullock are in this new Lan∣guage, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 3, 493. γ' 384.</NOTE> <HI>Budding Honours;</HI> and those of a Ram (if I am not much mistaken) <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 4, 107. δ 85.</NOTE> <HI>translucent Crescents. Pallas</HI> is well known to have had <HI>Blue Eyes</HI> given her by the Ancients; now it is</P>
<P><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. 1, 408. δ' 314.</NOTE> Celestial Azure brightning in her Eyes.</P>
<P>This heightning of things, by a severe Critick might be thought blameable; and indeed whenever it interferes, where the Passions ought to be touch'd, it cer∣tainly is so in an higher degree. The Reader is delighted when, after a me∣lancholly Scene, he sees <HI>Penelope</HI> reviv'd by a Message from the Gods; and <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">B. 4, 1096. α' 840.</NOTE> secretly enjoying the Satisfaction of her Soul: but what Passion, what Idea has he, when instead of this he is told of her <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">B. 4, 1096. α' 840.</NOTE> <HI>Hearts dilating and glowing with florid Joy?</HI>—Paint to him that unhappy
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
Princess in her Distress, retiring <HI>silently,</HI> and crying herself toS leep; only shew the Circumstances, and the Reader must be moved: Does her Behaviour and her Sufferings strike him so forcibly, when he finds it embellish'd into</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 1, 462. α' 363.</NOTE>—Echoing Grief, <HI>and</HI> Silver-streaming Eyes?</L></Q>
<P>But however these Passages may seem to be weaken'd by the finery and luxu∣riance of the Language, this certainly is not so much the fault of <HI>Pope,</HI> as of the Age: We give much into an airy way: If a Verse runs off smooth, 'tis no mat∣ter for depth or clearness; and as the Ancients valued Thoughts more than Sound, we seem to be taken with Sounds more than Thought. To speak out, we are got into an idle manner of Versify∣ing; and if Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> sometimes falls in∣to it, we are not so much to blame him for those Particulars, as to wonder, that he does not do it more frequently, in so general a debauch of Taste among us.</P>
<P>Hold (interrupted <HI>Philypsus)</HI> if You go on at this rate, You will seem only to be got into the old Cant of running down our own Times: I do not believe, but that I cou'd name some Poet among us,
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>
to answer any of those who flourish'd in the <HI>Augustan</HI> Age. As to the present Point, we rarely hear of any such thing as <HI>Translation</HI> among them: In <HI>Satyr,</HI> we have the great Names of <HI>Rochester, Dry∣den,</HI> and <HI>Oldham:</HI> (not to mention the new kind of Satyr, introduc'd among us by <HI>Butler.)</HI> In <HI>Critical Poems,</HI> there are (You know) two or three very good, be∣side that incomparable Piece by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> all to weigh against poor <HI>Horace.</HI> As for <HI>miscellaneous</HI> Subjects; think of <HI>Cowley, Pope, Waller</HI> and <HI>Pryor,</HI> to mention no more of them. In the <HI>Epick, Milton</HI> may dispute the Laurel with either <HI>Virgil,</HI> or <HI>Homer;</HI> and in <HI>Dramatick</HI> Pieces, of either kind, we have Writers that indisputably exceed any of the Ancients.</P>
<P><HI>Antiphaus</HI> was not inclin'd to enter in∣to a dispute of this nature. "I was on∣ly speaking, says he, of our present Taste in Poe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, and the prevailing manner of those writers who are now upon the Stage. As to this, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> give me leave to say, that the language of our Writers, and the practice of the World, is much infected with the <HI>Finesse.</HI> I think 'tis Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> observes, <HI>that the humours of a Peo∣ple, may be learnt from their usage of words.</HI> This symptom of the disease is very strong in the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Case: thus to say that a verse
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
is <HI>bien tourné</HI> is the highest commenda∣tion among the French Criticks: in ge∣neral, the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> is the only name now, for what was call'd by a very diffe∣rent one formerly; as a <HI>fine</HI> Scholar, <HI>po∣lite</HI> Literature, and the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> are the leading expressions, when we would speak of Learning in the best sense.

<P>Is there any Figure so much abus'd by the Moderns, as what they call the <HI>An∣tithesis?</HI> they run it into a down right playing upon Words. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s Poetry cou'd not <HI>live</HI> without it: <HI>Dryden</HI> uses it almost perpetually, in his Translation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Virgil;</HI> and was ridicul'd, You know, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that head by the late Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham.</HI> I have observ'd with pleasure, that Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his Translation, very much avoids this little beauty, which the other affected so excessively; yet I have a place before me, where one of this kind ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slipt from his Pen: It runs thus.

<P>Pardon me, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> there you do not seem to do the Translator Justice; the Figure is countenanc'd by <HI>Homer</HI> him∣self: You see here is an <HI>Antithesis</HI> in the Original. "That (answer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> seems rather to be a Contrast, to set the riot of the Suitors in a stronger light: But call it what you please, it is only single there, whereas you see it multiplied, and worn to Rags in the Translation.

<P>I find it so, (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> and own the Lines to be somewhat forc'd and un∣natural; indeed those you have repeated seem generally to draw too near to that Character. But I cannot conceive by what means they sound so harsh to me at present: when I read the Piece, there was scarce a Line of them which gave me any offence.—Yes; it must be by your tearing them from the Body of the work, that they now seem not so agreeable. Really, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> this is not sair usage of an Author; You rob them of their Order and Connection; and 'tis thenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they perfectly lose the Beauty, which they had in the Whole. Very true, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ply'd <HI>Antiphaus;</HI> the warmth of Read∣ing, the thread of the Story, and a gene∣ral tunableness in the Verse, will carry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Man on strangely; and may sometimes cheat him into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse Pleasure. But then it is for this very reason, that I shou'd think, the justest method of form∣ing a judgment on Particulars is, to con∣sider them apart. However, let us try it for once in a more entire Passage, than any of the former. Let me see; The place I have dipt upon, is where <HI>Miner∣va</HI> tells <HI>Ulysses</HI> that she will transform
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>
him into the figure of an Old Man; that he may view the posture of his Affairs unsuspected and unknown: The Lines in <HI>Homer</HI> may be thus read into English:</P>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 397, to 403.</BIBL>
<Q>I will make you (says that Goddess to the Hero) entirely unknown to all Men; the beauty and smoothness of your Skin shall be taken away, your Limbs bent, and the Hair of your Head turn'd grey. I will then fling a Garb over you that shall make you frightful and odious to those that see you. All that flame and life in your Eyes shall be lost; I will so far deform them that you shall look contemptible to all the Suitors, to your own <HI>Penelope,</HI> and to your Son, whom You left yet an In∣fant in your Palace.</Q>
<P>You know that Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in com∣paring some Passages in the Prophesies of <HI>Isaiah</HI> with the famous Eclogue of <HI>Virgil,</HI> turns the latter into Prose; If we follow that Example in the present case, his Translation of these Lines runs thus:</P>
<BIBL><HI>Od.</HI> 13. V. 453, to 464.</BIBL>
<Q>It fits thee at present, to wear a dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disguise, and walk secret, unknown to the Eyes of Mortals: For this my Hand sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wither every Beauty, and <HI>every eleganc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

<P>Give me leave to go out of my way a little, to try the same Experiment on a single Passage from the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which is flourish'd, and set off in an extraordina∣ry manner. It is in the Nineteenth Book, where we have a poetical account of a fine Breed of Horses; The Origi∣nal runs thus:</P>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 221. 225.</BIBL>
<Q>Three Thousand Mares graz'd these Meads, with their young Foals run∣ning by them; <HI>Boreas</HI> was enam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur'd of them as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed there, and turn∣ing himself into the shape of a fine black Horse, accomplish'd his desires: Of this breed, were twelve of the Colts.</Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation, (only allow∣ing equivalent Expressions to blind the Rhimes) runs thus:</P>
<BIBL><HI>Iliad,</HI> B. 20. V. 262. 270.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>His spacious Pastures bred three Thou∣sand Mare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and</HI> three Thousand <HI>Foals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>
<HI>beside</HI> their Mothers: <HI>Boreas enamour'd of the</HI> sprightly train, <HI>conceal'd his</HI> Godhead in the Locks of Hair <HI>that flow'd over his Shoulders; he</HI> neigh'd <HI>to his</HI> Loves with dissembled Voice, <HI>and</HI> cours'd the dapple Beauties <HI>o'er the Meadow: Twelve others of</HI> unrival'd sort <HI>sprung hence,</HI> swift as their Mother <HI>Mares</HI> and Father <HI>Wind.</HI></Q>
<P>This, if over-wrought, is the more blameable, because the matter is carri∣ed very far even in the Original, and so is the less capable of being stretch'd any farther. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his note upon the Place observes, <HI>That Homer has the hap∣piness of making the least Circumstance con∣siderable; and that the plainest matter</HI> shines <HI>in his dress of Poetry.</HI> It is true, it shines sufficiently in that. Some bright∣ning is necessary in Poetry: but an ex∣cess of it, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> may dazle, or may blind our Eyes; it can never assist, or delight them.</P>
<P>By comparing these Passages, You will see that which I intend; the difference of Manner in the Ancient and Modern Poetry: In the latter we find Expressions added, which seem to be added for beau∣ties, and which in reality perhaps only turn the Plainness and Strength of the Original, into the <HI>Fine</HI> and the <HI>Arti∣ficial.</HI></P>

</LG>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> without question is happy in a great share of Judgment, as well as Vi∣vacity and Spirit in Writing: but it is next to impossible, in so long a Transla∣tion, especially as it is in <HI>Rhime,</HI> not to give sometimes into Sound and Orna∣ment; when to crown all, the Vogue of the World goes so strong for both. Do not ask, whether I should desire to see
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
both of them banisht out of Poetry; far from it: Expressive Sounds are of use in the most natural, and Variety in the ma∣nagement of them, is necessary to keep up Attention in the Reader: That, and Ornament, is what sets Poetry above Prose. All I wou'd say is this, that Sound is not sufficient where we might expect Sense; and that in <HI>humble</HI> Passages, in <HI>natural</HI> Descriptions, or in moving most of the <HI>Passions,</HI> additional ornaments are so many blemishes. Dressing up the ex∣pressiveness of <HI>Homer,</HI> in such fineries, is much the same as if one shou'd throw a very gay modern dress over the <HI>Hercules</HI> of <HI>Farnese,</HI> or any of the most Nervous Statues of the Ancients.</P>
<P>But You will allow Ornament, where the subject will bear it, and where the Original leads the Way?—In a translation (answer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> it is proper perhaps, only in the latter Case; but allowing it in both, it shou'd never be over-wrought in either. Too much Finery is always Affectation: and I wish our Writers at present were not so generally given <HI>to elevate and surprize, and all that,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Bayes</HI> calls it.</P>
<P>The running into this excess so much, is what has unsinew'd our Poetry. 'Tis with Poetry, as it is in Buildings; the
<PB N="21" REF="31"/>
being vastly Studious of Ornament does not only take away from the Strength of the Work, but is a sure token of a viti∣ated taste in the Designer.</P>
<P>You are always blaming the Modern Refinements, says <HI>Philypsus;</HI> but will you not allow that this taste of the Age is a sufficient justification at least of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in those cases where he complies with it?—We must <HI>write</HI> so as to please the World, and <HI>speak</HI> so as to be most easily under∣stood: Custom will often wear away the propriety of things of this Nature; and as for the propriety of language, that de∣pends upon it entirely. I allow, to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e your own thought, that a profusion of Lace and Embroidery wou'd be a disguise upon an Old Hero; but they are so far from being improper, that they are be∣coming on the Heroes of our Age.—</P>
<P>They may become the Heroes of our Age (replied <HI>Antiphaus</HI> smiling) perhaps on a far different account: there is ano∣ther Character now wove into and blended with that of a Soldier, to which these things are very agreeable: How many are there of these Heroes, as you call them, whose Courage reaches no farther than their Sword-knot, and whose Con∣duct is taken up wholly in their Dress? But consider a Man barely as a Soldier;
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>
think of him in the midst of some warm Action, and these little Ideas of him will disappear: Then it is <HI>that</HI> posture, <HI>that</HI> pressing on the foe, <HI>that</HI> grasping of his Sword, <HI>that</HI> fierceness in his Eyes, <HI>that</HI> serenity and <HI>that</HI> eagerness on his counte∣nance, which strike us wholly, and take up all our attention. Yes, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> if you view a real modern Hero in a true light, those fineries do not set well upon him: and I think, I never saw any thing more truly ridiculous, than the Piece we were laughing at the other Day, in your Picture-Gallery.—Good Heaven! The Duke of <HI>Marlbrough</HI> in the heat of an Engagement, with a full-bottom'd Wigg, very carefully spread over his Shoulders!</P>
<P>But to return to the present taste in Poetry.—If this Corruption of the Age cou'd excuse a Writer for what he com∣poses now, must it be carried down as far as <HI>Homer's</HI> Days? must his Heroes love, and talk, and fight <HI>a-la-mode?</HI> must his strong, sententious lines, be set to the new polite airs of <HI>Handel</HI> and <HI>Bononcini?</HI> Yet, were what you wou'd alledge of any force, it wou'd carry the matter thus far; and the whole <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> ought to be enervated down to the present taste. No, whatever may be allow'd to any of the proper genuine productions of this
<PB N="23" REF="33"/>
Age, it ought not to make an inrode upon all others: let <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>energy</HI> and <HI>pathos</HI> be violated as little as is possible; Nature ought to rule in his Works, and those of the Antients: as ornament, and sur∣prize, and elevation, have in their turn the Empire of the Modern World.</P>
<P>You see I beg into shew the old heat, that this subject (I think) always betrays me into.—I beg pardon, <HI>Philypsus;</HI> and will attend more to what I am about for the future.—I shou'd have given you some instances of this <HI>Elevation</HI> from the tran∣slation before us. <HI>A-propos,</HI> What a gla∣ring description of a Sword have we in the Eighth <HI>Odyssey?</HI></P>

<P>The lines You have just repeated, in∣terrupted <HI>Philypsus,</HI> are such as I cannot admire: but I think you carry the point too far against Art in general.

But what I have said was intended not so much a∣gainst the <HI>Use</HI> of Art, as the <HI>Appearances</HI> of it. 'Tis the greatest of Arts, to con∣ceal the Art you use; and to have it very evident, is the greatest of Blemishes. The Criticks, and <HI>Cicero</HI> in particular, speak with the greatest plainness against any thing of that kind.

The first lines, when You repeated them, I took tobe the very worst, You could pick out of the <HI>Od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssey:</HI> But I know not how i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> comes about, You rise gradually in your demands upon me; and are got insensi∣bly from lines in that piece, which were forc'd and too much beautified, to things unnatural, and shocking. When I thought of making a Convert of You to an entire admiration of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> I fancy, I was much mistaken; at this rate, you will turn the Tables upon me: and to tell You the truth, I cannot but confess, that
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
the Poet has, in some Cases, fallen into each of the faults You mention.</P>
<P>In some Cases doubtless (reply'd <HI>Anti∣phaus)</HI> that Gentleman is not to be com∣mended: I take his Translation to be as good, as any Translation of <HI>Homer,</HI> into <HI>English,</HI> and in <HI>Rhime,</HI> cou'd be expected to be; In all probability, we might safely add, that no other Writers of the Age cou'd, in the whole, have perform'd such a task so well. But a perfect Piece of this kind cannot be expected: If <HI>Homer</HI> himself is allow'd to Sleep a little, his Translator certainly may Nod some∣times.—</P>
<P>One thing I observ'd (interrupted <HI>Phi∣lypsus)</HI> in the lines you have repeated that the faultiness of several of them was owing to an Excess in one of the great∣est Beauties of Poetry, I mean, the <HI>Meta∣phors</HI> too frequent in them. I observ'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same (says <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> as I was collec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing these little Remarks: it occasion'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my using a particular Paper for that sin¦gle point: If it did not grow so late, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wou'd shew it to You; but—No, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us have it now, cry'd <HI>Philypsus:</HI> I neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knew any thing of yours too long, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it be that Paper in your Hand, I shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> think it much too short; were it not fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my concern for the Poet, and the desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="29" REF="39"/>
I have of finding as few Faults in his Writings as possible.</P>
<P><HI>Metaphor,</HI> says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> is certainly the most universal enlivener of Poetry. At the same time that it adds to the dig∣nity of Verse, it gives it an agreeable variety; together with a power of Paint∣ing out all its Images, in the boldest and strongest manner in the World. 'Tis this which animates those objects, which must otherwise be still and unaffecting: it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lings every thing into Motion, Life, and Action: By this the Arrow is <HI>eager</HI> and on the Wing, by this the Sword <HI>thirsts</HI> for Blood, and the Spear <HI>rages</HI> in the Hands of the Warriour. <HI>Metaphor</HI> raises each subject out of the heavy nar∣rative way: it creates new Beings; it represents the passions of Men, and even meer <HI>Names,</HI> as animated and imbodied; and shews them in the posture and atti∣tudes of Agents. Thus when the Battles are going to join, You see <HI>Rage stalk</HI> a∣midst the Combatants; pointing with one <HI>Hand</HI> to the Enemy, and in the o∣ther, shaking the <HI>Torch of War.</HI> By this, the Valleys and Mountains <HI>rejoice,</HI> when <HI>Peace</HI> once more <HI>spreads</HI> her downy Wings, and <HI>Plenty</HI> descends from Heaven upon the <HI>happy</HI> climate. 'Tis <HI>Metaphor</HI> which makes the Woods and Caves <HI>answer</HI> to the
<PB N="30" REF="40"/>
voice of the Poet, and the murmuring Stream <HI>compassionate</HI> his complaints: 'Tis this which makes the <HI>Nile know Caesar;</HI> and <HI>the Sea,</HI> its present <HI>Monarch.</HI></P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> manages this powerful Fi∣gure frequently to the best advantage, sometimes he happens not to be so happy in the use of it. The force of <HI>Metap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or</HI> is to make things strong, clear, and sen∣sible: any confusion destroys the very end of it; and yet a little inaccuracy may occasion gross errors this way. Some∣times what is just with the <HI>Figurative<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> may disagree with the <HI>Proper:</HI> sometimes again, an idea which might stand with the <HI>proper</HI> expression, will be inconsistent with the <HI>figurative.</HI> A misapplication either way is very obvious, and yet it gives a jar to the Ideas, and makes the sense of a line to be perplexed and in confusion.</P>
<P>It sounds but oddly to talk of a Person, and of his Picture, without any manner of distinction: To say, that <HI>the piece, drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller for Mr. Pope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is an excellent Poet and Writes with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greatest Command imaginable;</HI> Or, that <HI>Mr. Pope is a very good piece, and his fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very well colour'd, tho' he is but just recover'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from a fit of Sickness;</HI> either of them w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u'd carry a mixt incoherent sense with

<P>Such confusions of the <HI>Metaphor</HI> and the <HI>Proper</HI> have a great resemblance to that absurdity (of mixing <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Reality</HI> to∣gether) which appears so grosly in Mr. <HI>Dryden's Hind and Panther;</HI> and which was the very thing, that provoked Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> to ridicule that Piece, with such infinite humour and good sense. The Noble Author's Words on that subject, may give a Side-light to what I mean in the present Case. Speaking of the An∣cient Fabulists, <Q>They wrote (says he <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Preface to the</HI> Hind and Panther Transvers'd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> in Signs, and spoke in Parables: all their Fables carry a double meaning: The Story is one and entire; The Cha∣racters the same throughout; not bro∣ken, or chang'd, and always conforma∣ble to the nature of the Creatures they introduce.

<P>I had almost forgot to tell You, that upon consulting the Original there was no <HI>Metaphor</HI> at all to be found, for either of the Lines, I last repeated from the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> We have now <HI>Metaphors</HI> perpe∣tually; the Translator is vastly fond of them. I need not say that an Excess this way is very blameable; You know the Criticks speak against it in a high strain, and one of them goes so far as to say, that this <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equens <HI>(M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taphorae usus)</HI> &amp; obscurat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aedio complet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> continuus vero in allegoriam &amp; aenigma exit. <HI>Quintil.</HI> Instit L. 8. c 6.</NOTE> <HI>Figure, when frequent, obscure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Piece, and fatigues the Reader; when continual, 'tis no longer a Poem, 'tis all Allegory and Enigma.</HI></P>

There is an Observation arising from this, which ought to be consider'd, in transferring <HI>Metaphors:</HI> it may be said, that the word <HI>Cheeks</HI> in this Verse, is justified by the Original. Custom, <HI>Phi∣lypsus,</HI> is the great Rule of Words: and what is easy in one Language, will not bear in another; because usage may have soften'd in one, what in the other is yet harsh and unwarrantable. This is evi∣dent from the very Word in debate. Thus we use <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Cheeks</HI> in English of some Creatures beside Men; the Term is so far familiarized, and sounds very well: Yet to talk of the Cheeks of a <HI>Pheasant,</HI> or the Cheeks of a <HI>Vulture,</HI> will by no means sound the softer for it's prevailing in those other particulars.</P>
<P>However, this is agreed on all hands; that a <HI>Metaphor</HI> is not to be used, unless it gives a greater light, and makes the thing more sensible to us. Are the Bor∣row'd terms, in this Case, <HI>more</HI> expressive than the Native? Nay, do they give you <HI>as clear</HI> Ideas, as the Native would?

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>ETWEEN company and business, it was some time before <HI>Philypsus</HI> and <HI>Anti∣phaus</HI> cou'd get an Even∣ing to themselves; the latter had waited for it with some impatience; and did not fail, pretty early in it, to remind <HI>Philypsus</HI> of his promise. I long, says he, to see your Remarks: such a method of viewing a Poem, is something like the way of our favourite <HI>Vertot</HI> in writing History: we have the material Parts of it, without passing thro' the dead Lines, which go toward the Narrative; or the less sig∣nificant Passages, which are to fill up the Chain of Events. You must not expect

any great Matters, answer'd <HI>Philypsus:</HI> Tho' I have had longer time than we talk'd of at first, it has been sufficient only for collecting some of the scatter'd Beauties of this excellent Translation.</P>
<P>Some of the Lines which you repeated the former Evening, shew'd that the Great∣ness of his Genius, had led Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> sometimes into an Excess: if things can be too much beautified, that fault does certainly belong to him. In a few lines, I confess, he discovers a greater love of Ornament, than is becoming. This is the fountain of all the several Peccadillo's which you observ'd from his writings; whatever there is to be found in them either too <HI>glaring,</HI> or <HI>forc'd,</HI> or <HI>figurative,</HI> or too much <HI>elevated,</HI> may fairly be accounted for this way. You, Sir, produc'd some Passages, as I remember, under each of these Characters: But how pardonable is it, for so exalted a Genius, to run some∣times into an excess of Ornament? And how admirable for such, to excell often in the just, handsome, natural <HI>Manner?</HI> As Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in the former, may possibly want some favourable Allowances; He must certainly command the highest Esteem in the latter.</P>

<P>Tho' these Passages are generally of too great a length to bear repeating in a single Evening, you will indulge me with the reading some of the most finish'd Parts of them.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Episode</HI> is particularly well wrote; but the things chiefly to be ad∣mir'd in it are, the <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> of <HI>Pro∣teus;</HI>—His Speech on the unhappy Cu∣riosity of Men;—the account immedi∣ately after, of the Deaths of <HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> and, above all that enliven'd Conclusion, in Relation to <HI>Elysium,</HI> and, the future Happiness of <HI>Menelaus.</HI> You remember the various Transformations of <HI>Proteus;</HI> and, I believe, will allow them to be exceedingly well express'd:</P>
<LG>

<L>Then arm'd with tusks, and lightning in his eyes,</L>

And last, sublime his stately growth he rears</L>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 4, 615. to 622.</NOTE> A Tree, and well-dissembled foliage wears.</L>
</LG>
<P>The Lines are extremely good, says <HI>Antyphaus;</HI> but I had a Thought came into my Head, that possess'd me, all the time, you were reading them: I cou'd not forbear thinking, what an happy Contrivance it wou'd be in the Mana∣gers of the <HI>Old House,</HI> to bring this Deity upon the Stage, in the same manner, that he appears in these Verses. Such a Per∣formance wou'd set their Character in the most eminent Light: They wou'd infallibly get the start of their ingenious Rivals; and poor <HI>Doctor Faustus,</HI> and his <HI>Dragon,</HI> wou'd no longer be the highest Entertainment of the <HI>Beaux Esprits</HI> of this Age.</P>
<P>I am got into another Part of the Poem (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> which might serve, in some measure, to arm their Rivals of <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> against so formidable an Undertaking. There are Passages in the <HI>Descent into Hell,</HI> capable of fur∣nishing out a great deal of the <HI>Wonderful,</HI> and <HI>Surprizing,</HI> in this way. But to re∣turn: can any thing be more Pathetick, than this whole Book? especially, the latter
<PB N="45" REF="55"/>
part, when <HI>the Heroes</HI> come to make their Appearance. Tho' I am always lost in the Variety of Beauties, which we find in it; I must single out the Speech of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> and read (at least) the Conclusion of it to you:</P>
<LG>
<L>When War has thunder'd with its loud est Storms,</L>
<L>Death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms;</L>
<L>In duel met her, on the listed Ground,</L>
<L>When hand to hand they wound return for wound:</L>
<L>But never have thy Eyes astonish'd view'd</L>
<L>So vile a deed, so dire a Scene of Blood.</L>
<L>Ev'n in the flow of joy, when now the bowl</L>
<L>Glows in our Veins, and opens ev'ry Soul,</L>
<L>We groan, we faint; with Blood the dome is dy'd,</L>
<L>And o'er the pavement floats the dreadful tyde—</L>
<L>Her breast all gore, with lamentable cries,</L>
<L>The bleeding innocent <HI>Cassandra</HI> dies!</L>
<L>Then, tho' pale death froze cold in ev'ry vein,</L>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 11, 528. λ', 423.</NOTE> My Sword I strive to wield,—but strive invain.</L>
</LG>
<P>Surely nothing in Nature can be con∣ceived of greater Strength and Emotion, than this Circumstance. We see the Hero weltring on the Floor, all cover'd with Blood, and in the last agonies of Death. It was then, that he heard the Cries and Shrieks of the Daughter of <HI>Priam,</HI> pursued by the Traytors, and stab'd to the Heart by the barbarous
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>
<HI>Clytemnestra:</HI> expiring as he was, he en∣deavours to raise up his Arm, and at last gets his Hand upon the hilt of his Sword; which he had strength only to grasp, with a look full of Rage, Compassion, and Revenge. Methinks, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> I see him now expired, and dropt upon the Floor: but tho' expired, there is still that Rage and Passion in his Coun∣tenance; he still grasps his Sword, and seems to threaten the Traytors and the Adulteress with his looks.</P>
<P>I know nothing finer (says <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> than these last Efforts of dying Heroes. They affect the Soul wonderfully: And the weakness of their Body, which will not permit their acting at such times, in my Opinion sets off their Courage, and their Desire of Action, in the strongest Light imaginable. There is nothing un∣natural in this; tho' indeed it follows Nature to its last Pitch: The best Historians, as well as the first Poets, make use of such Circumstances very finely; and I remember Instances of it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Etiam quos vires sanguisque desereret, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> intra vallum hostium <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derent,</HI> nitebantur. <HI>Liv.</HI> vol. 3. p. 145. per <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arne.</HI></NOTE> in <HI>Livy</HI> and <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Catilina vero longe a suis inter hostium cadavera repertus est, paullulum etiam spirans, ferociamque animi quam habuerat vivus, in vul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u retinens. <HI>Sall.

The turn of Expression in this, is much more lively and passionate, than the language of <HI>Homer</HI> himself. As you cannot value any delays, where we meet with such Improvements; I am sure you will give me leave to read you the Speech of <HI>Ulysses</HI> just after: That I mean, in which he gives <HI>Achilles</HI> an account of his Son <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>'s behaviour in the War.</P>
<LG>
<L>—Hear with pleas'd Attention the renown,</L>
<L>The wars and wisdom of thy gallant Son:</L>
<L>With me from <HI>Scyros</HI> to the Field of Fame,</L>
<L>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diant in Arms the blooming Heroe came.</L>
<L>When <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce</HI> assembled all her Hundred States,</L>

</LG>
<P>Give me leave (says <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> inter∣rupting him)—that very Verse I have formerly taken notice of; the Transla∣tor seems to me to have used an unne∣cessary Caution in it: He is tender of making <HI>Ulysses</HI> commend himself <HI>by Name,</HI> where <HI>Homer</HI> does it with the greatest bluntness.—</P>
<P>I know it, says <HI>Philypsus;</HI> but that I should have put to the account of his
<PB N="50" REF="60"/>
Improvements on this Speech. Cou'd any thing have been more gross, than to have imitated that line in its own <HI>coarse, rustick</HI> Dialect? Is it not better on all Hands for such a Sentiment to be <HI>imply'd</HI> than to be <HI>express'd?</HI></P>
<P>Custom and Prejudice (answered <HI>Anti∣phaus)</HI> have now render'd it unpolite, and even shocking, for a Man almost in any Case to commend himself: But it was not thus anciently. It is certain, that it was not thus in the times of those He∣roes, whom <HI>Homer</HI> describes; and <HI>Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> therefore acts with Propriety, in making <HI>Ulysses</HI> say, that <HI>Nestor and Himself wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wisest of all the Grecians.</HI> Now, is the Translator in this Case to follow his Au∣thor, or not? Is he to preserve <HI>the Man∣ners</HI> of the Ancients in the characters or his Heroes? or is he to modernize them and to make <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> appear the most accomplish'd, finest Gentleme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the World?</P>
<P>That will be carrying the Matter to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> far, replied <HI>Philypsus;</HI> I speak it only as to this particular; and I own I am yet to be convinc'd, that this Humour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commending themselves, was really s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prevalent among the Ancients. Perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is one of the Places where <HI>Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nods:</HI> it might be a slip of haste or inat¦tention.—</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="61"/>
No, interrupted <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> nothing can be more certain, than the freedom and honesty of Speech us'd among the Ancients, in this particular; not only before <HI>Homer,</HI> but very long after his time.—If <HI>Homer's Ulysses</HI> here calls him∣self the wisest of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> his <HI>Achilles</HI> does not stick at calling himself <HI>the Best and most Valiant of them;</HI> and that too, in a Council of all the <HI>Princes: Virgil</HI> has given us his Approbation of both the one and the other, in making <HI>Aeneas</HI> talk frequently of his own piety and va∣lour. I cou'd tire you with Quotations of this kind: <HI>Socrates,</HI> in <HI>Plato,</HI> is al∣ways brought in to his advantage; and yet there he does just the same thing with <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the present case: he him∣self quotes the Oracle, which pronounc'd him to be <HI>the Wisest of Men. Xenophon</HI> represents <HI>Cyrus,</HI> upon his Death-bed, as taking notice of the greatest Beauty of his own Character, his Humanity; in a Piece which, every one knows, was designed for the Character of a <HI>perfect Prince.</HI> In a word, whole Treatises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been wrote of this very thing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this very strain. <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sar,</HI> and the great <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewish</HI> writer of his own Life, frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommend themselves: the greatest Cri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick, as well as the greatest Orator, among

the <HI>Romans,</HI> who so often recko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Modesty</HI> among the things which are most necessary toward rendering a Man great in his Profession; how open and frequent is he in praising himself, and in setting his own Merit in a true Light? But what puts this beyond dispute (and shews at the same time, that a just Commen∣dation of one self, may by very consist∣ent with the <HI>greatest Modesty)</HI> is to be found in the <HI>sacred Writings,</HI> in which <HI>Moses</HI> says of himself, <HI>that he was the Meek∣est Man upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Thus free were the Ancients in commend∣ing themselves; and not to consider here, whether we, or they were in the right; (whether their <HI>Behaviour</HI> may not be thought to have had more of <HI>Veracity</HI> in it; and our Method to have been groun∣ded, in a great degree, on a <HI>false Esti∣mate</HI> of things: however that be) I think enough has been said, to shew that <HI>Homer</HI> was not <HI>drowsy,</HI> when he wrote this line; and that <HI>Ulysses</HI> might use it, without any thing of a vitious Arrogance.</P>
<P>To confess the Truth (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> I was really ignorant in this point of the Usage of the Ancients, and had modelled their <HI>Manners</HI> too much by our own. I now see my error; and think the Translator

might have spared the excuse, which he <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Note on Ver. 626, B. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> makes for this Indecency in <HI>Ulysses</HI> behaviour: 'tis plain, it wou'd not have been so improper, before a People, less noted for Vain-glory, than the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI> I thank you, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> for this new Light; and shall go on with the Heroe's Character of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> without thinking him so assuming, as he formerly appear'd to have been.

<P>What starts? what terror, and a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azement? What passionate breaks are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here in these lines? How solemn is the

beginning? how emphatical the account of the action? and how lively the sur∣prize and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion of the Inchantress, upon finding the inefficacy of her Charms? Nature here appears in every Word that she says; if the Disappointment is great and shocking, the lines too are all im∣petuous and abrupt: if the passions strong and various, the Expressions in the Translation are instant and pressing, and the stile often chang'd: How great and swift is the Alteration, from an im∣perious cruel Tyrant, to a poor weak helpless Woman? And how is it equal'd by that judicious shifting of the scene in this piece? There the change is as sud∣den and immediate; and nothing can be greater than the fall from the haugh∣tiness of
<Q><L>Go, be a Beast!—</L></Q>
to the meanness of the line, just after,
<Q><L>She faints, she falls; she lifts her weeping Eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>You cannot but observe farther, my <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> that the lines in this descrip∣tion, are every where improv'd with those Figures, which the Ancient <HI>Cri∣ticks</HI> have always look'd upon as the most proper to express an hurry of Passion. The <HI>Transposition,</HI> the <HI>Omission</HI> of Words, the pressing use of <HI>Exclaiming</HI> and <HI>Interrogation,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="67"/>
and the general <HI>Inconnection</HI> which runs through it, are all apply'd in the most natural and poetical Man∣ner. There is a Note of the Translator on a Passage not long before this, which gives us in one view several excellent Ob∣servations of this kind, and which no doubt he had in his Eye here; for the rules of it are exactly follow'd in the pre∣sent case. This Poet is the best Com∣mentator on himself; give me leave there∣fore just to look back for his <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on B. 10, Ver. 295.</NOTE> Note on the Speech of <HI>Eurylocus;</HI> that you may see how exactly those Observations tally with his performance here, in every par∣ticular Article.</P>
<P><Q>We have here (says he) a very lively picture of a Person in a great fright:—the very manner of speaking, repre∣sents the disorder of the speaker; he is in too great an Emotion to introduce his Speech by any Preface, he breaks at once into it, without preparation, as if he could not soon enough deliver his thoughts.</Q>—<HI>Again:</HI></P>
<P><Q>There is nothing, which gives more life to a Discourse, than the taking away <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">from <HI>Longinus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Subl. c, 17.</NOTE> the Connections and Con∣junctions; when the discourse is not
<PB N="58" REF="68"/>
bound together and embarass'd, it walks and slides along of it self. <HI>Pe∣riods</HI> thus cut off, and yet pronounc'd with Precipitation, are signs of a lively Sorrow; which at the same time hin∣ders, yet forces him to speak.</Q>—<HI>Again</HI> (in a like case)</P>
<P><Q>He speaks short, and in broken and interrupted Periods, which excellently represent the agony of his thoughts.—Afterwards we see he breaks out into Interrogations, which, as <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De <HI>Subl.</HI> c, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Longinus</HI> observes, give great motion, strength, and action to Discourse. If the Poet had proceeded simply, the Expression had not been equal to the occasion; but by these short Questions, he gives strength to it, and shews the disorder of the speaker, by the sudden starts and vehemence of the Periods.</Q></P>
<P>All these animated Figures, all those Arts of expressing the Passions, are beau∣tifully wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into this single piece of Poe∣try: But there is one peculiar Excellence in it yet behind, which I admire be∣yond all the rest. It is a power almost unknown even to Poetry before, and the Criticks have not as yet found out any Name for it. The extraordinary Beauty
<PB N="59" REF="69"/>
I mean, is that <HI>Insight</HI> which the Poet gives his Readers into <HI>Circe's Mind:</HI> We look into her Soul, and see the Ideas pass there in Train. At first she is ig∣norant, then dubious, and at last dis∣covers gradually in her Thoughts the Character, and very Name of the He∣roe. <HI>Circe,</HI> skill'd as she was in all the arts of Magick, is limited in her Know∣ledge and Discovery of things: and in the present Discovery of the Person of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> her Mind acts with Tumult and Rapidity, but at the same time with a series and gradual Collection of Truths, at first unknown. Every one may per∣ceive the Tumult, and the <HI>successive En∣lightnings</HI> of her Mind. We are led in∣to a full View of the shifting of her thoughts; and behold the various open∣ings of them in her Soul.</P>

<P>I never read any thing which sets the actings of another's Mind so distinctly to the view. <HI>Circe's</HI> very Thoughts are made visible to us; they are set full in our Eyes; and we see the different degrees

as it were of Light, breaking in upon her Soul.—'Tis a most charming piece of Poetry! and upon turning it every way, and considering all its several perfections, I believe one might venture to pronounce it, the most finisht Piece, the most <HI>compleat Beauty</HI> in the whole Translation.</P>
<P>These are the productions of a Sub∣lime Genius, and speak an uncommon Spirit, together with a firm extensive Judgment, and an exact Sense of things. But you <HI>Antiphaus</HI> chiefly complain of this Writer for his Refinements and Ele∣vation: there is too much of the <HI>Enflure</HI> (as the <HI>French</HI> call it) in his Works; and you cannot bear with such a pro∣fusion of Glitter and Embroidery in the Language. I do not deny, that the Passages you repeated, are generally blameable on these accounts; but beg leave to produce some instances, which may shew the Translator, to be a master in the just and proper stile; as the for∣mer convince us of his Excellence in the polish'd, and enliven'd, and pathetick.</P>
<P>How humble are the lines in parti∣cular, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 13.</NOTE> where <HI>Ulysses</HI> meets with <HI>Mi∣nerva</HI> in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> and how rural the (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)

<P>As for the just and chaste <HI>Manner</HI> of expressing things, it is very frequent in these Passages: There is a place just come into my Head, in which this very way of speaking is describ'd; the lines are close and expressive; and, according to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Method in his <HI>incompara∣ble Essay,</HI> are themselves the best example of the thing they treat of; they are <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Verse, 185. θ' 170.</NOTE> in the Eighth Book:</P>

<P>By this we see, how Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> can en∣liven any thing of this kind with the greatest Justice and Beauty: Such (to mention but one more) is that single Pas∣sage, as I take it, in all <HI>Homer</HI>'s Works, which describes the Regions of the Blest. The Lines are very beautiful in the Original; and the Translation has ex∣press'd all the beauties of it, in a lively proper fluency of Verse:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Elysium</HI> shall be thine; the blissful plains</L>
<L>Of utmost Earth, where <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> reigns:</L>

<L>Mould the round Hail, or flake the fleecy Snow:</L>
<L>But from the breezy deep, the blest inhale</L>
<L>The fragrant murmurs of the Western gale.</L>
<L>This grace peculiar will the Gods afford</L>

</LG>
<P>What can be more Just and Beautiful? The Thought proper and <HI>adequate;</HI> the
<PB N="63" REF="73"/>
Words <HI>glowing;</HI> and the Language <HI>alive:</HI> To me, the Verses themselves seem to run on with joy, and pleasure. The delightful Softness of those lines in <HI>Homer</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is diffus'd thro' the whole Description by Mr. <HI>Pope;</HI> and the latter has the ad∣vantage of the Original, in concluding with a full elastick line, that carries a Spring with it, instead of the heaviness of—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>I entirely agree with you (says <HI>Anti∣phaus)</HI> as to the turn of the Lines; 'Tis very fine and vigorous: but methinks even in these, what answers the two particular Greek Verses you have repeated, are too much flourish'd, and more remarkable for their Sound, than for any other Idea they may give the Mind. The Sense seems to be almost overlaid by the <HI>Finesse</HI> of them.</P>
<P>I shall not stand with you for that Couplet, answer'd <HI>Philypsus:</HI> what I chief∣ly admire is the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low of the lines in the whole Passage.</P>
<P>This manner of writing, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> is very assistant in expressing the nature of the Subject: and indeed, tho' Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> does sometimes go too far in the Florid and Artificial, we may say in general,
<PB N="64" REF="74"/>
that he is a very <HI>natural</HI> Writer. His Imagination is lively, his Colours strong, and his Hand masterly in most of his strokes. We shou'd lose our selves in endeavouring to observe all that variety of Beauties of this kind, which are to be found in his Translation: one Point I have particularly admir'd in it; The Poet's peculiar Air, and Happiness in drawing Landscapes; especially hang∣ing Woods, Slopes, and Precipices: Thus,
<Q><L>—High <HI>Ithaca</HI> o'er-looks the Floods,</L>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 3, 96. γ' 81.</NOTE> Brown with o'er-arching Shades, and pendent Woods.</L></Q></P>
<P>What Reader will be so unconcern'd, and so little taken with this Prospect, as <HI>Ulysses</HI> is represented to be in another Part of the Poem? For 'tis the same place, that we have a description of af∣terwards, when we are told, <HI>That he</HI></P>

</LG>
<P>In <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s first adventures on <HI>Phaeacia,</HI> we are led on <HI>successively,</HI> thro' several very beautiful Descriptions. First we

have a <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 5, 520, 521. ε', 402.</NOTE> rocky Coast, excellently pictur'd in two lines only: thence we are carried into a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 5, 613, to 622. ε', 480.</NOTE> thick dark Wood, for that Night. The next Morning, we have a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. 6, 310, to 320. ζ', 262, 269.</NOTE> View of the City; The first things which offer to the Eye are the Castle, and the Senate-house, rising above the other Buildings; at a distance, across the great Road, appears the Port with the Ships at Anchor, and their Sails flut∣tering in the Air: on the Shore, just by the Temple of <HI>Neptune,</HI> you see the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> busied in the Dock, all in their several Employments. After this View, you pass thro' a <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">B. 6, 350. ζ', 291.</NOTE> delicious Range of Groves, and Meadow-ground, up to the Walls; while on this side, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">B. 6, 355. ζ', 293.</NOTE> appear the Gardens all in bloom; and the Vine∣yards of <HI>Alcinous</HI> close the Scene on the other.</P>
<P>There can be nothing better imag'd, and more natural, than these Descrip∣tions are in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation: they exceed even the Original it self.</P>
<P>I beg leave to repeat another Descrip∣tion to you, which lies not so diffus'd as the former; 'tis one single View of <HI>Calypso</HI>'s

<L>The Birds of broadest wing their mansion form,</L>
<L>(The Chough, the Sea-mew, the loquacious Crow)</L>
<L>And scream aloft, and skim the deeps below.</L>

</LG>
<P>Nothing can be more beautiful to the Eye, than these Landscapes are in the Poem: they make every thing present to us; and agreeably deceive us into an Ima∣gination, that we <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Longin. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>actually See, what we only Hear:</HI> As the Poet may improve all his Circumstances at pleasure, what the Criticks have observ'd in this Case, is not so extravagant, as one wou'd imagine; we really see things more fully and with greater delight in the Poem, than we shou'd in the reality; The Picture im∣proves upon Nature: and we might look

<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> shews an excellent Hand in several other Places; as in the first View of <HI>Circe</HI>'s Palace at a distance, and con∣stantly in the appearance of Land off at Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Ulysses</HI> gives us an account of the for∣mer at his landing upon the Island of that Goddess.</P>

<P>Nothing hath furnish'd <HI>Homer</HI> (as well as <HI>Virgil)</HI> with such a variety of natural Images, as this Element; and in nothing has Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> more finely copied his Ori∣ginal.

<P>Sometimes we have all the <HI>Imagery</HI> in Motion: If a Ship is to set sail, the Canvas swells to the Eye, the Streamers float in the Air, and the Sailors are all full of Noise and Business: <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 2, 459. β', 419.</NOTE> We see the Vessel move on, and here the rush∣ing sound of the Water.</P>

<P>At another time, you behold the Row∣ers, drawing <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 12, 183. μ', 147.</NOTE> <HI>the Oar to their broad Breasts;</HI> and the different attitudes of them, as they <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 12. 216.</NOTE> <HI>bend,</HI> or <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. 12. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>65.</NOTE> <HI>stretch</HI> to the stroke.</P>

<L>With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew:</L>
<L>He lash'd the coursers, and the coursers flew.</L>

<P>Give me leave (interpos'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> to observe one thing, by the way. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> (possibly, to make this the more sensible to us at present) deviates a little from the Truth; and chuses rather to shew the <HI>Poet,</HI> than the <HI>Antiquary.</HI> As I take it, the Horses in the Chariots of the Ancients were not <HI>beneath the Yoke.</HI> Do not their Medals, and all the Pictures of them represent it otherwise? And does not the Verse, here in the Origi∣nal, shew its Position in respect of the Horses, very particularly and distinctly?</P>
<P>However, this is a slip of a small Na∣ture: and had the thing been express'd in exact Conformity to the <HI>Grecian</HI> fashion in this particular, it might not have struck the Reader so strongly, as it does now, by its Agreement with the present Idea of the same thing.</P>
<P>I am not concern'd, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> ei∣ther in defending, or giving up that par∣ticular: I only instance this Passage, in general, for its expressiveness of such an Action; and of the Ideas, arising in
<PB N="71" REF="81"/>
the Mind upon it: As to that <HI>End,</HI> I believe it will hold very well. The De∣scription and Sentiment is very Natural, (reply'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> I beg you to go on without observing any little breaks for the future, which may be occasion'd by such Circumstances, as do not affect the chief Aim and Design of a Quota∣tion.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Poet,</HI> proceeded <HI>Philypsus,</HI> can paint out the <HI>Ideas</HI> in the Mind with so much Justice, as he appears to do by this instance; and more particularly by another mention'd before (of the succes∣sive <HI>openings</HI> and <HI>unfolding</HI> of an unknown Truth, in the Mind of <HI>Circe)</HI> we shall find him to have been equally Happy in expressing the <HI>Passions</HI> of the Soul. Some∣thing of this has been mention'd already, and almost an infinite variety of Beauties of the same kind might be added. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bound every where in the Translation, and are generally well touched. But there is the Description of one Passion in par∣ticular, which is perserv'd throughout the whole Piece: It is <HI>Ulysses</HI> his Love for his Country. Give me leave to re∣peat some of the first, and last Passages, in which it is exprest. How strongly does <HI>Minerva</HI> represent this, even in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery entrance of the Poem? She says the
<PB N="72" REF="82"/>
Hero is detain'd from <HI>Ithaca,</HI> by a God∣dess (nothing human cou'd have forced him into so tedious an absence: by a Goddess)</P>
<LG>
<L>Who sooths to dear delight his anxious mind—</L>
<L>Successless all her soft caresses prove,</L>
<L>To banish from his breast his Country's love;</L>
<L>To see the <HI>Smoke</HI> from his lov'd palace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise,</L>
<L>While the dear Isle in <HI>distant</HI> prospect lies,</L>

</LG>
<P>The first Appearance of the Hero is most excellently imagined. <HI>Calypso</HI> has just receiv'd orders to detain <HI>Ulysses</HI> no longer from his Country; she finds him sitting alone upon the Rocks, the Tears trickling down his Cheeks, and his Eyes fixt upon the Sea. It was thus that he pass'd his Hours, in the Island of that Goddess: He constantly,</P>
<LG>
<L>In slumber wore the heavy Night away;</L>
<L>On Rocks and Shores consum'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edious Day:</L>

<P>It wou'd be endless to repeat every thing of this Nature; There are a Thousand sketches of it in the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> 'Tis sufficient at present to observe, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> generally gives them to us in very lively Colours; and excells almost every where in the <HI>Pathetick.</HI> 'Tis cer∣tain (says <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> that he has an ex∣cellent Hand; his Images, which you have set before me, are as strong as any of the Works of the Pencil. They are so, answered <HI>Philypsus;</HI> and, on that account, you will Pardon me for bor∣rowing so many Metaphors from Paint∣ing in this Case; 'Tis unavoidable. The designs of Painting and Poetry are so united, that to me the Poet and the Painter seem scarcely to differ in any thing, except the <HI>Mean</HI> they make use of, to arrive at one and the same end. Both are to express Nature: but the Materials of the one are Words, and Sound; of the other, Figure and Colours. <HI>Poetry</HI> can paint more particularly, more largely, and with greater coherence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Painting</HI> is
<PB N="76" REF="86"/>
the more concise, and emphatical. If <HI>This</HI> may excell in shewing one View distinctly, <HI>That</HI> can shew several in suc∣cession, without any manner of Con∣fusion. Any figure in <HI>Painting</HI> is con∣fin'd to one Attitude; but <HI>Poetry</HI> can give as great a variety of Motion and Postures, as the reality it self. What seems a Paradox of Art in either, is their Power of expressing two <HI>opposite Passions</HI> in the same face. Of this sort (among a Multitude of like instances) is the Mother of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, in the Gallery of <HI>Luxembourg;</HI> and every Piece in that fine Episode, which con∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udes the sixth <HI>Iliad.</HI> In that <HI>Picture,</HI> the Queens Face strongly expresses the Pain and Anguish of her Condition, mix'd with a regard toward her Son, full of the greatest Pleasure and Complacence. In the <HI>Poem</HI> we have the greater variety, and each piece is perfectly just and finish'd. <HI>Hector</HI> shews a sierceness for the War, and a tenderness that inclines him to stay for a last interview; little <HI>Astyanax</HI> has a Fondness and a Terror in his Eyes, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sight of his Father; while <HI>Andro∣mache</HI>'s Face is all soften'd into a tende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Smile; and at the same time, wet with the Tears, that fall for her <HI>Hector.</HI></P>

<P>This Distraction of <HI>Achaemenides</HI> be∣tween several Passions at once, puts me in mind of the dubiousness and shifting of thoughts, which is illustrated by <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> by a very apt and expressive Simile; than which (says Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> <Q>There <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Note on I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 14, 21.</NOTE> is scarce any thing, in the whole com∣pass of Nature, that can more exactly represent the State of an irresolute mind, wavering between two different Designs; sometimes inclining to the

<P>There are many things in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s fourth <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which might be produc'd on this Occasion: but 'tis more to our present Subject to consider that part of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> from which some of its finest strokes are borrow'd. <HI>Calypso,</HI> when she acquaints our Hero with the design of his departure from her Island; upon his doubting her sincerity, swears very so∣lemnly, that her Resolutions are real: the next moment, she falls into a Speech full of Insinuations and Arguments to detain him: both these speeches may rather be said to be <HI>enliven'd</HI> and <HI>im∣prov'd,</HI> than to be <HI>well translated</HI> by Mr. <HI>Pope;</HI> this only wou'd be too narrow a Commendation of them:—The first runs thus:</P>
<LG>
<L>How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise?</L>
<L>But hear, Oh Earth, and hear, Ye sacred Skies!</L>
<L>And thou, Oh <HI>Styx!</HI> whose formidable floods</L>

One wou'd think now that the God∣dess was to do nothing but to advise a∣bout his Voyage, and the Conveniencies for it: but her Passions immediately veer about; and the very next Page, the very next time she speaks, is all in a strain entirely opposite to what she has been saying in this:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Ulyss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s!</HI> (with a sigh she thus began)</L>

<L>Thus wilt thou leave me? are we thus to part?</L>
<L>Farewel! and ever joyful may'st thou be;</L>
<L>Nor break the transport with one thought of me.</L>
<L>But ah <HI>Ulysses!</HI> wert thou giv'n to know</L>
<L>What fate yet dooms thee, yet, to undergo,</L>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 5, 265. ε', 208.</NOTE> Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>I must not forget here, that the fines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the modern <HI>Italian</HI> Poets has express'd this <HI>Melange,</HI> on an occasion which is attended with such a Circumstance, as exceeds any of the other: The particu∣lar in which he shews it, shews at the same time the <HI>swiftness</HI> of the intervening passion; and expresses the strongest of any how immediately one flow of Spirits suc∣ceeds upon a former and quite contrar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> emotion. <HI>Armida,</HI> deserted by her <HI>Ri∣naldo,</HI> breaths nothing but fury and revenge;
<PB N="83" REF="93"/>
she pursues him in the heat of the battle; forgetful of her former pas∣sion, she aims an arrow at his heart: but see, while it is yet in its flight, how the passions vary on her face! her rage and fury soften into tenderness and appre∣hensions of his danger! in an instant her Love is too strong for her Resent∣ment: in an instant, she dreads least her Design shou'd be effectual, and longs to be disappointed in her aim:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>(a)</HI> Swift flies the shaft: as swiftly flies her pray'r,</L>
<L>That all its vehemence be spent in air.</L>
</LG>
<P>How finely are the Passions blended in this piece? the Transition from the ex∣tremity of fury to an excess of love, is manag'd in such a manner, as to be wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsensible: as when two Colours are lost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Shades of each other, the Eye is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>greeably deceived; and we are delight∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the delicacy of their Union, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o' unable to discover where one com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ences, or the other ends.</P>

instance, I have mention'd here: And certainly what makes so beautiful a Fi∣gure in the finest Poets, might deserve the imitation of the best Painters. Was not the <HI>Dolon</HI> and <HI>Calypso</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> worthy the hand of a <HI>Zeuxis</HI> or <HI>Parrhasius,</HI> a <HI>Protogenes</HI> or <HI>Apelles?</HI> Wou'd not the <HI>Aruns</HI> or <HI>Achaemenides</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> have been a fine design even for <HI>Raphael</HI> and <HI>An∣gelo</HI> to have work'd upon? If our <HI>Shake∣spear</HI> can give us the struggle of Passions in the Breast of <HI>Coriolanus, Thornhill</HI> might trace the same, and speak them as well with his Pencil: And if <HI>Corneille</HI> ex∣presses the contrary desires of the sister of the <HI>Curiatij,</HI> his Country-man <HI>Le Brun</HI> might have had a much finer Subject in the various Passions of the <HI>Sabines,</HI> rush∣ing in amidst the two contending Ar∣mies; to prevent those fatal Consequen∣ces, in which the Victory of either par∣ty must necessarily involve them.</P>
<P>But what I have often thought of as the finest Subject of this kind, either for Poetry or Painting, is the first <HI>Bru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> on the Judicial seat; just before the act of giving Sentence on his <HI>own Sons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for their treachery to the <HI>Common-wealth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> What a noble strife was there betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> natural Affection, and the Love of one'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country? between Duty, and Desire
<PB N="85" REF="95"/>
between common Humanity, and the Spirit (perhaps the Pride) of a <HI>Roman?</HI> What a fine Groupe of Figures wou'd the Suppliants for the Criminals compose in such a Piece? On one side of the Tri∣bunal, the <HI>Wife</HI> of the Judge and <HI>Mo∣ther</HI> of the Offenders; and all the Re∣lations divided in the same manner, be∣tween a desire of moving Pity, and an abhorrence of the very Crime, for the Pardon of which they wou'd intercede: The People of <HI>Rome,</HI> on the other side, with looks full of mixt Passions; some struck with Pity amidst all their severity, some almost condemning and yet ap∣proving at the same time, the rigid justice of the Father; while others commiserate the Youth of the Sons, and seem incens'd at the <HI>unnatural impartiality</HI> of the Judge.</P>
<P>'Tis a Misfortune, that <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Hand was withheld from launching farther, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Aen 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 821.</NOTE> where he has touch'd upon this Subject: but it wou'd be well made up to us, if any eminent Person, in the other Art, wou'd undertake it: It might certainly make a finisht Piece: and Painting in this particular wou'd have the advantage of Poetry; as it could express this <HI>Mélange</HI> of passions directly, and wou'd strike the mind with them in their proper Union, all at once: whereas, when taken from
<PB N="86" REF="96"/>
the <HI>Poetical Picture,</HI> the combination is not so easy; and we scarce ever conceive it, so closely as we ought.</P>
<P>Were you to give me full scope, I shou'd carry the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>semblance between these Arts much farther than it has ever yet been carried: There is scarce a <HI>Figure</HI> or <HI>Man∣ner</HI> in Poetry which I shou'd not imagine to have its tally in the Schools of the Painters: I cou'd find it even in the very next point, which comes in my way, in the <HI>Empha∣tical.</HI> Natural Descriptions, as they are Pictures which take in the various Cir∣cumstances of a place or action, give us generally several Groupes of finisht Fi∣gures: This, on the contrary, is a way of expressing Nature in Poetry, not un∣like Out-lines and Sketches in Painting: and as the lines in Sketches are <HI>fewer,</HI> but the more <HI>distinct;</HI> this must be al∣ways <HI>concise,</HI> and very <HI>expressive.</HI></P>
<P>There are several masterly strokes of the <HI>Emphatical</HI> kind in the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> Such is that Speech of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> where he says

<P><HI>Antiphaus</HI> cou'd scarce imagine, that these were all clear improvements upon <HI>Homer:</HI> He immediately consulted the passages in the Original; and was sur∣priz'd to find, how far they fell short of the Translation; especially, in the line<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>The mentioning <HI>Circe</HI> just now, puts me in mind of another passage: 'Tis where <HI>Homer</HI> describes the Metamorpho∣sis of the companions of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> They had (says he) the Shape and the Voice of

<P>I remember that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> appear'd to me, upon my first reading his Transla∣tion, to have improv'd much upon the Original in his <HI>Poetical Repetitions</HI> of the same word, the Figure in which he is most frequent. Thus is it us'd in the following lines:</P>
<Q><L>A Scene, where if a God shou'd cast his sight.</L>
<L><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">B. 5, 96. ε', 73.</NOTE> A God might gaze, and wander with delight.</L></Q>

<P>And in these other very Pathetical,
<Q><L><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. 2, 415. β', 370.</NOTE> Then stay, my Child!—Storms beat, and rolls the Main,</L>
<L>Oh beat those Storms, and roll the Seas in vain!</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis yet more beautiful, when the Re∣petition holds farther; as in this Passage:</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">B. 8, 90. θ', 92.</NOTE> Transported with the song, the listning train</L>
<L><HI>Again</HI> with loud applause demand the strain:</L>
<L><HI>Again Ulysses</HI> veil'd his pensive head,</L>

<P>This sometimes gives an additional so∣lemnity, and rises stronger and stronger each Line:</P>
<Q><L>Celestial as thou art, yet stand deny'd:</L>
<L>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> swear that oath, by which the Gods are ty'd,</L>

<P>This is sometimes carried yet farther; and in <HI>Virgil</HI> particularly there is a fine Instance of this sort of Repetition <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>Saevus amor docuit natorum sanguine <HI>matrem</HI></L>

<P><PB N="92" REF="102"/>
But in nothing is this figure more beau∣tiful, than in the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 12. 220. μ', 184.</NOTE> <HI>Siren's Song:</HI> That Piece of antient Musick, is greatly en∣liven'd in the Translation; the whole flows on in a peculiar Harmony, and the Chorus is very happily added in the Conclusion of it:
<Q><LG>
<L>Celestial musick warbles from their tongue,</L>
<L>And <HI>thus</HI> the sweet deluders tune the song.</L>
</LG><LG>
<L>O stay, oh Pride of <HI>Greece! Ulysses,</HI> stay!</L>
<L>O cease thy course, and listen to our lay!</L>

<P>The peculiar justice and propriety of this, is the manner in which these God∣desses apply to <HI>Ulysses;</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 12. 220. μ', 184.</NOTE> by offering him knowledge; a thing the most oppo∣site to their own Complexion; and a mo∣tive, the most likely to obtain upon that Hero. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has shewn his taste, and his judgment, very much in improving so finely upon this Circumstance: but what runs through the whole, is that musical enliven'd turn of the Verses. This is
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>(b)</HI> See <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note on the Place.</NOTE>
<PB N="93" REF="103"/>
the happiness, which of all things I ad∣mire in this writer: either in prose, or verse, he has the finest flow that can be imagin'd. I have often heard a very good Critick say, That <HI>whenever he is reading any Prose of Mr.</HI> Pope<HI>'s, he cannot help think∣ing that he should never have wrote any thing else: and whenever he reads his Verses, he is angry with him, for losing any time from them, for Prose.</HI> How often has the same Gentleman apply'd to this writer those Lines in <HI>Milton,</HI> in which he speaks of the first Poet, as well as the first of Men?</P>

</LG>
<P>Among so many excellencies, the repeat∣ing those Lines, which make the Chorus of this <HI>Song of the Sirens</HI> is not the least beauti∣ful Circumstance: there are a Multitude of other passages, which deserve to be men∣tion'd on account of the fine <HI>Repetitions</HI> in them: these are what fell into my thoughts at present; and you have them in the same scatter'd manner, that they appear there: But one method of Im∣provement in this Translation, I took
<PB N="94" REF="104"/>
particular notice of, and in that, I can be a little more full and di∣stinct.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has a very great happiness in <HI>Transferring Beauties.</HI> He often guides his Translation of <HI>Homer</HI> by some fine thought, or good expression in any other eminent writer; and this has been the occasion of several improvements in that work.</P>
<P>Have you never observ'd how he in∣troduces the Elegance of <HI>Virgil,</HI> into the Majesty of <HI>Homer?</HI> There are two <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">B. 10, 385.</NOTE> speeches of <HI>Circe,</HI> which have much of the air of that of <HI>Proteus,</HI> in the fourth <HI>Georgick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and that of the <HI>Sybill</HI>'s in the sixth <HI>Aeneid.</HI> The speech of <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 11, 130.

<P>There are several Imitations (in a shorter compass) of natural Images, and the like, introduc'd into <HI>Homer</HI> from the same treasury: Thus the following Lines</P>

Although the Translator adds these fine strokes from other Hands, they are brought in so naturally, that they seem to spring out of <HI>Homer</HI>'s sentiment: And if an Instance or two shou'd be found a∣mong them which may vary a little from the Original, it is only to add some ap∣posite Thought, that is not only finer, but at the same time perfectly agreeable to the Subject. In such cases a Transla∣tor may demand the greater liberty of enlarging: as a <HI>Flattering Resemblance</HI> is always allow'd to Painters. I like that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery ingenious Friend of yours, who calls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>French</HI> Translation of <HI>Tacitus, La <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lle Infidelle:</HI> That piece, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' not very precise and constant to its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthor, is the more beautiful, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore engaging.</P>

thro' whole scenes together: In particu∣lar, I cou'd almost be positive that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> read over the <HI>Eclogues</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> be∣fore he set about that Part of the Story, which lies between <HI>Ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus;</HI> and indeed I should be apt to conjecture that he usually read those Pastorals, be∣fore he sat down to any rural Scene in this Piece: If I am mistaken in this, 'tis the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">From <HI>Virgil</HI> B. 14, 76.

beauty: It delighted him to see, what Foundation the Original gave for such a turn, and yet how new that turn was in the Translation; he found almost in every one of them some addition for the better, and scarce in any a deviation from the sense of <HI>Homer:</HI> It was <HI>Homer</HI>'s sense, but the Expression of it was im∣prov'd.

(says <HI>Philypsus.)</HI> A Few, answer'd <HI>Anti∣phaus;</HI> but I beg one Evening more on this Topick. At present I shall only add my wishes, that we may constantly use thisfair method, in reading all the ce∣lebrated Pieces, which come out among us: Let us keep up the true ballance; and not suffer ourselves to be prejudic'd either by too great fondness, or too vio∣lent dislike. This is the great Rule of An∣tient Criticism: <HI>Always to keep our Hearts open to the beauties of a Poem; and never to shut our Eyes against the defects of it.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LMOST all the next day <HI>Philypsus</HI> was taken up in reflecting on what had been said at the close of their last meeting: he be∣gan to be not so uneasy, as usual, in thinking that the faults of a favourite Poet were to be lookt into that Evening; he did not value Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> less than formerly, but he was throughly convinc'd that there was not so much of severity in this Method, as he had once imagin'd. "No: (says h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to himself) Let us view impartially, that we may rationally admire: Where be∣fore I was immediately in love with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eauties and fond of the Work, I now
<PB N="103" REF="113"/>
feel an equal Pleasure and an equal Esteem; but it is in a different manner: I now seem to see the causes that move me to be pleas'd with those fine Passages, and feel a more just and manly Satisfaction in them: 'Tis true, the Soul is not hur∣ried away with that vehemence of de∣light, as formerly; but the agreeable Sense I now have from them, is both more refin'd, and more lasting. How much is this <HI>rational</HI> way of admiring to be prefer'd to the common, vulgar <HI>passionate</HI> one? This is as a flash of Lightning; but the other is like the Light of the Day: 'Tis a serene, dif∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us'd, steady light, which at the same time that it discovers all Objects to us, is it self the most beautiful of any.</P>
<P>But then (continued he) how blind was I to the defects of this Poet. Has not <HI>Antiphaus</HI> shown me several, which before I had no sense of, and which now appear evidently to be such? Indeed that over-sight was more excusable in reading the Works of this celebrated Writer, than it wou'd have been in any other: Reason may well lose something of her Liberty, when she is taken up with an Object every way so agreeable and engaging: However, for the future, I resolve to keep my self obstinately from

being over-pleas'd with any thing; and to read his, as all other the best Pieces, in spight of all their Beauty, by that Rule which <HI>Antiphaus</HI> has laid down.</P>
<P>With these Thoughts he open'd the Translation which lay on his desk; and was very busy in considering it, when Company came in, and interrupted him for that Night: The next Day he em∣ploy'd himself in the same manner; This sort of view was new to him, and of course the more agreeable: Sometimes he met with a line or two, that disgusted him a little; but much more frequently was he struck with the Beauties of the Poem; and those he enjoy'd with a full Delight, as he found that Delight to be rational and just. This search drew him on strangely; he did not know how to leave off: And tho' <HI>Antiphaus</HI> stay'd for the Evening before he wou'd disturb him, he found him still closely employ'd at it: "My <HI>Philypsus,</HI> (says he) I'm glad to see you engag'd thus in the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> What new light shall we have into the excellencies of this writer? Have not you been collecting other Beauties out of the Translation?—I have met with several other, reply'd <HI>Philypsus:</HI> So many indeed, that it wou'd be almost endless to col∣lect them. But to tell you the Truth,
<PB N="105" REF="115"/>
my business was quite contrary to what you imagine: I was upon a more difficult task; I was endeavouring to try what Faults I cou'd discover in it. That is by much the more difficult, says <HI>Anti∣phaus:</HI> The few Faults of that Piece are scarce discernible among such a superi∣our number of Beauties: How seldom do we perceive the disagreeableness of a single feature, in a Face that is very taking in the whole? Well; but have you been able to overcome this Difficul∣ty? can you discover any thing farther of this kind in the <HI>Odyssey?</HI> Very little, answer'd <HI>Philypsus:</HI> There is but one point yet, that has afforded me any num∣ber of Instances; And that is a Fault, directly opposite to what you particular∣ly insisted upon, in our first Conversa∣tion on this Subject.</P>
<P>It was then, you know, that we con∣sider'd several Points in which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> appears to Elevate and Flourish too much: Have you never observed, on the contrary, that there are a few <HI>Low∣nesses</HI> in his Writings; and that he some∣times sinks into a Diction, which bor∣ders on the <HI>Mean</HI> and <HI>Vulgar?</HI> I have, re∣ply'd <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> in some few lines: but if you have made any remarks of that kind, I beg rather to see those of your obser∣vation.</P>

<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
with them; but possibly what looks like a fault, may really be a beauty in some of them.</P>
<P>Some subjects require a simplicity of stile: Beside Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is to follow <HI>Homer;</HI> and shou'd <HI>Homer</HI> use an humble stile in these places, even to appearance impro∣perly, yet one should be apt to look upon it, as a sufficient justification of his tran∣slator.</P>
<P>For my part (reply'd <HI>Philypsus)</HI> I have always thought, that there is a wide dif∣ference between an <HI>humble</HI> and a <HI>mean</HI> stile; but (not to urge any thing of that kind) in the greater part of the instances just repeated, I am certain, there is not a sufficient likeness between the manner of the Original and the Translation.</P>
<P>I shall only except the two last, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re indeed plain and proverbial in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reek.</HI> There is a simplicity, as Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe</HI> tells us in his notes, a noble simpli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity in the diction; and which, in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pinion, is not Equally kept up in the <HI>English:</HI> but those I shall not insist upon.</P>
<P>As for the rest, that mean close of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rst of these Lines, is in <HI>Homer</HI> an <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Handsome sentiment, deliver'd in a sounding

verse: and the meanest Expression in the second, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, 405.</NOTE> is poetical in the Ori∣ginal. The same will hold, in some degree, of the other Lines. As it hap∣pens Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 14.

has given us this prose translation of the same words;
<Q><L>The Gods guided me to the habitation of a person of wisdom:</L></Q></P>
<P>Now it might be thought a rude que∣stion, to ask whether is the more <HI>poetical,</HI> his <HI>prose</HI> or <HI>verse</HI> Translation of this Line?</P>
<P>Indeed where <HI>Homer</HI> leads the way, the case is very different: I cannot say how far it might be justifiable, to blame a Translator for following his Author: and it was for that very reason, that I shou'd not have taken any notice of the <HI>delight∣ful History of the Coat and Cloak,</HI> which is given us in one of the longest speeches in the Fourteenth <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>
<P>But we have several instances of <HI>addi∣tional Lownesses:</HI> I observ'd particularly that they were pretty frequent, when the Scene is in <HI>Ithaca:</HI> Thus;

<P>The meanness here (interpos'd <HI>Anti∣phaus)</HI> is occasion'd by a just design; that of writing in a stile, agreeable to the simplicity of the subject: In several other places, it has a less excusable rise; I mean, the labour and difficulty of Rhime. The Poet's being in haste to get this drudgery off his Hands, sometimes draws him in∣to the use of Expressions, which are flat and contemptible.

either of the original <HI>Greek,</HI> or of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s imitation of it (which the <HI>English</HI> Translator, I doubt not, had in his eye) appears to be in a great measure owing to a poverty of Rhime. It has given a low turn to the whole passage; and that <HI>lowness</HI> is still most evident in the <HI>termi∣nating</HI> of the Lines.</P>
<P>There are a Thousand other things (resum'd <HI>Philypsus)</HI> which contribute to the meanness of stile; even a desire to a∣void it, will occasion it: 'Tis not un∣commonly seen that the straining to ele∣vate a point, will make it really the more mean and ridiculous: as nothing shews the littleness of a dwarf, more than strut∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng.</P>

Your Instances, reply'd <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> sufficiently shew, that (beside the incon∣venience of Rhime) Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> does some∣times, without that wrong Biass, deviate into a meanness of Expression: They are directly contrary to his usual Spirit.

<P>Tho' <HI>Dryden</HI> understood Rhime in the first sense, as well as most Writers, and yet generally stoop'd to the use of it in the other: Nevertheless I am inclined to believe, that he always saw thorough the Defects and Inconveniencies, not to say the Barbarity and Childishness, of it. Indeed one might be justified in saying even this; for <HI>Dryden</HI> himself follows <HI>Vossius</HI> in calling it expresly, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Preface to <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgil</HI>'s Pastorals, p. 95.</NOTE> <HI>A Chil∣dish sort of verse;</HI> and says that some <HI>Rhiming Hexameters,</HI> which may be disco∣ver'd in <HI>Homer,</HI> were probably the re∣mains of a <HI>Barbarous Age:</HI> <Q><HI>Virgil</HI> (add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that writer) had them in such abhor∣rence, that he would rather make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> false <HI>Syntax,</HI> that what we call a Rhime—The nicer Ears in <HI>Augustus</HI> his Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cou'd not pardon him for a Line, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which he had only dropt something like it: so that the principal Orna∣ment of Modern Poetry, was account∣ed <HI>deformity,</HI> by the <HI>Latins,</HI> and <HI>Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></Q></P>

<P>What you have now read to me (in∣terpos'd <HI>Philypsus)</HI> shews sufficiently, that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> cou'd give up an old Friend, and abuse him heartily behind his back; That writer cou'd speak the severest things of Rhime, when he was got into a vein of Prose-writing: But the present ill treatment he gives to it, may perhaps be on some particular Occasion; and in some Cases, I cannot deny that Rhime may be a very improper Ornament.</P>
<P>No (return'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> he is here speaking of Rhime in general, and on a general occasion: If you wou'd know his sentiments of Rhime, more particu∣larly in relation to the present purpose, and its use in translating an <HI>Heroick Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m;</HI> as it happens, there is a remarkable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assage, wrote by him on this very oc∣casion: it was in his more advanc'd Judgment; and particularly, as he him∣self informs us, when he was in his great Climaterick.

mean, tho' that Poet took the <HI>advantage</HI> of writing in Blank-verse, and freed himself from the shackles of Modern Rhime. I will not make a digression here (proceeds that Writer) tho' I am strangely tempted to it; but will only say, that he who can write <HI>well</HI> in Rhime, may write <HI>better</HI> in Blank-verse. Rhime is certainly a constraint even to the <HI>best</HI> Poets, and those who make it with <HI>most ease:</HI>—What it adds to <HI>Sweetness,</HI> it takes away from <HI>sense;</HI> and he who loses the <HI>least</HI> by it, may be call'd a <HI>Gainer.</HI> It often makes us <HI>swerve</HI> from an Author's meaning: as if a mark be set up for an Archer at a great distance, let him aim as exactly as he can, the least Wind will take his Arrow, and divert it from the White.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> And his opinion weighs the more with me in this case; because, if any thing, we might expect that he shou'd be prejudiced in favour of Rhime, but the reason of the thing, You see, prevailed over all other consi∣derations: He goes sofar as to condemn his own manner of Writing, rather than suffer such a corruption to pass without a severe Censure; and to that end, very generously gives up his Practice, to his Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="133"/>
Indeed I know of but one argument (and that the meerest <HI>Circle</HI> in the World) to support the present practise of writing in rhime; we must <HI>use</HI> it, because 'tis all the <HI>fashion.</HI> We who were never so far infected, can laugh heartily at some of the <HI>French,</HI> for rhiming thoroughout their Comedies; yet Rhime in Tragedy was very becoming among us, in an Age, not the least knowing and polite.

<P>Well, (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> I own, there is the greater majesty in Blank verse; but you will own too, that the other is the more beautiful. Yes, (reply'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> but for that very reason is Blank-verse undoubtedly the more proper for the <HI>Epick;</HI> as that is the most majestick kind of Poetry imaginable. And even as to the Sound, Those musical returns (if allow'd to be true Beauties) are more than ballanc'd by the <HI>Dead Manner,</HI> in∣troduc'd with them into Poetry; What I mean, is that <HI>perpetual likeness</HI> in the cadence, and turn of the Periods: How frequently do they fall in several repeated Couplets, without any variety, or relief to the Ear? You will sometimes meet with a Rhime-Poem, all the Lines of which run off entirely with the same pauses; the stream always equal, and so level that you can scarce perceive it to move: What do you think of each Cou∣plet, chiming on in the same stops and measure, with the most tedious unifor∣mity of sound imaginable?—That is the fault of the Poet, not of the use of Rhime, says <HI>Philypsus:</HI> I could name you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Poem of this kind, which has almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s great a variety in the Periods, as any Piece in Blank-verse. Possibly you mean
<PB N="128" REF="138"/>
a piece with Mr. <HI>Oldisworth</HI>'s Name to it, (says <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> which I have heard you commend particularly on that score. 'Tis true our Poets of late have endea∣vour'd to diversify the sound, as much as possible: We see great improvements of this kind, in the excellent Translator of <HI>Vida</HI>'s <HI>Poeticks;</HI> and several in the most nervous and vigorous of all our Translators, both in his <HI>Manilius</HI> and <HI>Lucretius:</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> seems to have thought of this much more frequently in his <HI>Odyssey,</HI> than in the former Trans∣lation of the <HI>Iliad;</HI> and gives us an ad∣mirable <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Od. B. 14; Observ. 2.</NOTE> Observation upon it, toward the conclusion of his last work. But af∣ter all, let our Poets manage the cadence and structure in Rhime-verse never so artfully, it will fall vastly short of Blank in these particulars; Indeed Rhime is a natural Enemy to them: it breaks and disturbs both the structure, and the ca∣dence. The very sound of any periods the best contriv'd will convince one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this: when a person of a good Ear is reading them, you may observe, that he endeavours to drop the Rhime, and lose the gingle of it, as much as possible: and
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
when the sound of it is not sufficiently kept under; you will find, that it spoils the continuance, and occasions too great a break in the period.</P>
<P>You may see by what I have been say∣ing, that this charge is not design'd a∣gainst <HI>single Couplets;</HI> The corruption in this respect evidently ceases, where there are no periods to be varied. To deter∣mine precisely where it will grow preju∣dicial, wou'd be difficult, and is not very material: Tho' I know not but what it might be uneasy to a very nice Ear, to have only four Lines together with re∣gular Rhime: and possibly on this very account, the Stanza but of two Couplets has generally unequal Rhimes, (the Se∣cond Line answering the Fourth) and that of Three, varies in the last Couplet. However forc'd or delicate this observa∣tion may be thought, one thing I cou'd assert with some degree of Confidence: I dare say, any one of a good Ear, who reads only ten Lines of the best Rhime-Versification, and an equal number of <HI>Milton</HI>'s true harmonious Verses, upon this view; will find a nobler sound, and that variety (which is necessary to the beauty of periods, and to the pleasure of a Reader) much stronger and much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uller in the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="140"/>
What has been said of <HI>Couplets,</HI> may in a great Measure be said of <HI>Odes,</HI> which consist of proper <HI>Stanzas:</HI> As these come next to Couplets for shortness, they have scarce room, singly, for the tedious Uniformity, we have been complaining of: and unless the <HI>Ode</HI> be long, they do not produce it by their <HI>Number.</HI> There may be a variety too of singular use in this sort of Poetry, where a person can run these <HI>Stanzas</HI> artfully into one ano∣ther; if the interweaving of them be not so frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and equal, as to bring in that very Satiety we wou'd avoid. Thus qualified Rhime is, at least, very tolera∣ble in <HI>Odes:</HI> And even in <HI>Pindaricks,</HI> the most extensive and lofty of any, the pre∣judice of it is not so pressing; There is so great a Liberty (I mean, in our modern <HI>Pindaricks)</HI> of varying the Numbers, and of fixing or deferring the Rhime at plea∣sure. But above all, in single Couplets, Rhime is most allowable; and in them indeed, I should think, it deserves the preference to Blank-verse: it may please the Ear more, and cannot do that mis∣chief, for which it is chiefly to be avoid∣ed in all large Pieces, and all compositi∣ons of a nobler sort.

all equal and uniform; and disposed a∣like, without any thing either great or beautiful in the whole; will yield to one of a good design, form'd of materials va∣rious and unequal, and perhaps ruder, or less exactly polish'd: At the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, the particulars of which it is made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken singly, will evidently exceed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers.

<P>It is a known Rule in versification, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Second Rhime ought not to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble the sound of those in a preceding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uplet.

the turn of the Period and the Numbers may be varied. Now why shou'd it not be as disagreeable to have a perpetual uniformity of Periods, as a continued likeness of Rhime? The latter no Man in the World will allow to be proper: nay, it cou'd not be born with, only for three Couplets together.</P>
<P>But supposing Rhime a real beauty in Poems of an higher kind, which I am perswaded it is not; (to speak nothing of its uniform returns, and the havock which it makes in the Periods; nor even of the <HI>diversion</HI> it gives the thoughts of the <HI>Reader,</HI> and its general disservice to pieces that shou'd be solid and pathetick: to omit all this) the single reason which introduc'd this question is, as I take it, sufficient to determine it. If Rhime is exceedingly apt to mislead a <HI>Writer,</HI> often to cramp, and sometimes to spoil his sentiments; its benefits, as being on∣ly benefits of Sound, will be far from ballancing those inconveniences of so much superiour a nature. This at least is the Case with Rhime: it gives either an impertinent pleasure, or an unneces∣sary trouble to a writer; and at the same time, that it distracts his attention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it encreases his difficulties: in a word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 'tis a false bent put upon the thoughts

of the Poet; and, in the best, proves fre∣quently a counter-biass too strong for their good Sense.</P>
<P>I own, it is with a strange readiness, that people fall generally into this taste; it has almost <HI>universal consent</HI> on its side: and the few Asserters of the Liberty of Verse meet with little Praise, or even Countenance, from the World. How many Persons would fly into unreasona∣ble Heats upon hearing half that I have said to you? I should beg the favour of any such Person, who wou'd please to be disobliged in it, to ask himself what argument there is for this practise, which has so generally obtain'd in the modern World: If he can find none, 'tis easy to bring the matter more home, and to ask farther, whether he thinks Rhime wou'd be proper in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> or <HI>Aeneid;</HI> and then, what single reason can be assigned, why it should be improper in a <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> and not so in an <HI>English Epick.</HI>—Yes, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> I am perswaded it is nothing but use, which makes it supporta∣ble at present; and whenever the world recovers it self from this <HI>agreeable Stupor,</HI> it will then appear as ridiculous to the Reader, as it has been inconvenient to the Poet. This I really imagine, that in fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, and perhaps far distant Ages, the

Criticks, when they look back on any the best Poem of this sort, (which may be deliver'd down to them from their Ancestors) will be at a loss to give any account of their Manner of Writing. When they read Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Odys∣sey,</HI> they will often applaud the great∣ness of his thoughts; and often admire the happiness of his diction, as far as the present Language shall be preserv'd to them.

<HI>Philypsus</HI> began to be moved by what his friend had urg'd on this head: I con∣fess (says he) You are a powerful adver∣sary to Rhime; but you must allow one some time to get a thorough dislike of a thing, which has once been so agreeable.

<P>These Lines are somewhat faulty in the sound, or posture of the words: but I only mention them; it wou'd be fri∣volous to make particular remarks on them: You may see, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> that my stock is quite out when I sink so low: my task this Evening was difficult e∣nough to me; and indeed 'tis not easy for any one to find many faults in a Piece, which comes from such excellent hands.

<P>Since you mention the thing, I believe I can recollect a passage or two, in which the sense is press'd so far, or so much altered from what it was, that they seem directly opposite to the Ori∣ginal. When the <HI>Grecian</HI> Commanders were drawn into <HI>Troy,</HI> in the famous Wooden Horse; the Enemy upon suspi∣cion of the design, us'd an artifice to make them <HI>cry out</HI> by surprize, if there were really any persons conceal'd in it. <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, that all of them <HI>sat very silent:</HI> only <HI>Anticlus,</HI> one of the Officers, was just <HI>ready</HI> to answer; when <HI>Ulysse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who sat by him, <HI>stopt his mouth by force<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> prevented his making any noise, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preserv'd all their Lives.

There is a part of <HI>Mercury</HI>'s speech in the <HI>Fifth Odyssey,</HI> and another point in the description of <HI>Lachaea,</HI> an uninhabit∣ed Island, which (I remember) I mention'd to you formerly, as Examples of this In∣consistency. Such indeed they appear'd to me, even after a second and third Read∣ing: but upon consulting the Original, I at last found them to be capable of a consistent Meaning. However it is to be wish'd, that the Translator had set them in a clearer light: for in one, the rea∣der will be apt to imagine, that the Poet speaks of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 9.

<P>Agreeable to this was the behaviour of these great Men in laying down rules, or making observations: their intention was to distinguish the beauties of Lan∣guage or Sentiments, from the defects and vices of either.

They will go re∣gularly thorough a Poem, with a con∣stant frown upon them; and think them∣selves obliged to find mistakes or nonsens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in every Line of it: they condemn b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tale, and censure by the Sheet. Nothing is more probable, than that from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Poem,</HI> they come to quarrel with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Person</HI> of the Author. Blemishes in his moral Character, and even natural Im∣perfections, have a share in their obser∣vations: and in a word, they labou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hard to convince you, that they are bad Christians as well as bad Criticks. The best of it is, their attacks are as weak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as they are violent; they have but little of Courage, tho' they make so great a Noise with it: and are like a sort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Currs that bark most, and run the soon∣est. The Character that was given o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>French,</HI> as <HI>Warriors,</HI> is true of these People, as <HI>Writers:</HI> They behave them∣selves fiercer than Men, in the onset<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in the shock, are feebler than Women.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="157"/>
I think you cannot be too severe upon them, resum'd <HI>Antiphaus:</HI> they are a Contradiction to true Criticism; as they always shew the greatest malice against every thing, that deserves the most to be commended. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has had the fate to be attack'd by these Animals: and indeed I do not see how he could avoid it. He has too many excellencies to let them sleep in quiet.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that the faults of a Wri∣ter (and never was any Writer without faults) ought to be observed; and the more excellent an Author is, the more necessary is such a Work. But this is the Drudgery of Criticism: the Pleasure and the Profit are on the other side.</P>
<P>We ought to shew faults, but we ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever to shew malice. And beside the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eneral good Nature which is owing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se Great Men, who have eminently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blig'd the World by their Labours; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here are particular allowances to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade in this last work of the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oet of our Age.

<P>'Tis true, all this may be said of his Translation of the <HI>Iliad;</HI> but if that Piece exceed this of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> it is ve∣ry natural upon other Accounts that it shou'd do so. <HI>Homer</HI> exceeds himself in that Poem.—Great Actions strike the Soul with rapidity; while all the things that relate to lower Life, are less vigo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous and affecting:—The description of Warriors and moral Precepts have a very different effect, on the writers them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves; those assist the Poetical flame, while these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling the Mind into a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edentary Posture.

and a <HI>Diction,</HI> almost perpetual in moral Sentences and Reflections, give a pattern very different from <HI>Homer,</HI> in all his vi∣gour, describing the Passion of <HI>Achilles;</HI> and sounding out the Wars of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> with an air the most martial and anima∣ted, that can be imagined.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Antiphaus</HI> rose up from his seat, and as <HI>Philypsus</HI> perceiv'd that he had finish'd; "I was unwilling to interrupt you (says he) otherwise I shou'd have observ'd on a verse or two, which you repeated, as rough, and of a bad turn.

to meer harmony, and the stated returns and gingle of syllables; I shou'd be one of the first among the admirers of <HI>Sound,</HI> whenever it is made serviceable to nature and true sense. That is the Art (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> and the Mastery, for which I particularly admire Mr. <HI>Pope:</HI> It is he who took up that great Rule of <HI>the Sounds being a comment on the Sense,</HI> and enfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d it beyond any of the Criticks who went before him. To this Writer we chiefly owe the revival of the nobler art of Num∣bers; and the method of signifying mo∣tions, and actions, and all that vast va∣riety of our own passions by <HI>Sounds.</HI> In his incomparable <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> this Writer has given us the best Advises, and interwove the most beautiful Examples into them, in a manner that will always be admired. The first <HI>Stanza,</HI> in his <HI>Ode</HI> on St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day, is the fullest Piece of this kind perhaps extant in any Lan∣guage: 'tis it self a perfect Consort. In the Translations of <HI>Homer</HI> we find him very frequent, and very just, in the same manner of Expressing things: I call it so; and cou'd almost be perswaded to think it a better way of Expressing, than in the common way of <HI>Words.</HI> These have a Sense affixt to them by Custom; while the other speaks by the Ideas of things;

<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> affords us infinite Examples of this Beauty in his Translation of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> it wou'd be endless to repeat them all, or to admire them as they de∣serve. But amidst all this variety, there is a single Point, which I have observ'd more than any of the rest: Whenever the Poet is speaking of the watry Ele∣ment, or any thing belonging to it, his management of Sounds is particularly frequent and beautiful.</P>
<P>Tho' it might not be much observ'd at the first view, I know no place where a greater variety of things are express'd this way, than in the Twelfth <HI>Odyssey;</HI> 'Tis where <HI>Ulysses</HI> is giving an account of his setting sail from the Island of <HI>Circe:</HI></P>

The objects shift perpetually in these Lines; and yet there is not a single peri∣od or pause in them, the sound and turn of which does not agree perfectly with the sentiment: I do not intend to en∣large much upon them; but had it been wrote in the Days of <HI>Dionysius Halicar∣nassaeus,</HI> I doubt not but he wou'd have given us a Dissertation, on a passage which so variously expresses that Art, of which he was particularly fond. That is the Critick, I think, says <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> who first <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> p. 29. Ed. <HI>R.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EVENING the FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER having engag'd themselves so far, we may imagine that <HI>Antiphaus</HI> and <HI>Philypsus</HI> waited with a good deal of Impatience for the remaining Part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <HI>Odyssey.</HI> As it happen'd, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth in Town, before it appear'd in Pub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck; and <HI>Philypsus,</HI> who was the warmer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the two, us'd to enquire almost every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y at <HI>Lintot</HI>'s how the Press went on. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e grew still the more eager, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me drew nearer: and the first moment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cou'd procure it <HI>in Sheets,</HI> he set down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them with all the Pleasure, and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verity, that <HI>Antiphaus</HI> had preach'd up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m in their former Enquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="179"/>
In the time that was taken up by this agreeable Search, he call'd often upon that Friend, with whom he shar'd his Studies, as well as his Affections. This was rather a Dividing, than Leaving his Pursuits: for he scarce ever saw <HI>Anti∣phaus,</HI> without mentioning something of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and hearing his Sentiments in return. When he had gone entirely thorough the Poem, he went immediate∣ly to desire a Meeting, in some place where they might talk more at large up∣on that Head. By good luck <HI>Antiphaus</HI> was perfectly disengag'd: <Q>'Tis a fine Evening, says he; and if you please we will take a turn together in the Gar∣dens of <HI>Horatio:</HI> since we cannot enjoy his Company, at least let us make use of that Liberty he has left with us. There we shall be retir'd from the Noise, and Bustle of the Town; and safe from every sort of Interruption.</Q> <HI>Philypsus</HI> was extremely pleas'd to find him so ready: they stept together into his Coach, which drove immediately to <HI>Horatio</HI>'s, and set them down at the Gates which lead into the Great-Walk of the Garden.</P>
<P>After a turn or two there, they sat down by the side of a Fountain, full in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of the <HI>Thames,</HI> which passes at
<PB N="3" REF="180"/>
the bottom of the Walk. The Walk itself makes a fine Visto in its De∣scent to the River: at a distance, you see the Fields and Hills; at first in an easy Ascent varied into Pasture and A∣rable, and then rising unequally, and cover'd here and there with Woods, till they are insensibly lost in a bluish Cast of the Clouds. The agreeable∣ness of the Place made <HI>Philypsus</HI> forget himself for a few Moments: he was taken up wholly in wandering with his Eye, sometimes over those beautiful Gar∣dens, and sometimes over the irregular Prospect that lay before them. At last recollecting himself and turning to <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aus,</HI> <Q>There is a difference (says he) in the agreeable Sense I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel at present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the delightful Views on all sides of us, which may partly confirm what we were talking of just before we sat down.</Q> Does not this Master-piece of Art, with all its Symmetry and Justness of Proportions, strike the Mind in a fee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler manner, than that Landskape of Na∣ture in its infinite Irregularity? These measured Rises and Falls, in Slopes an∣swering each other, Those Groves ter∣minating every way in an exactness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igure, These Walks intercrossing with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut confusion, and uniting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o happily,
<PB N="4" REF="181"/>
cannot fail of pleasing the Eye very much: Yet that Wildness and Variety abroad, the River, Lawn, Fields and Woods so beautifully interspers'd, compose a Scene much finer and more engaging. For my part, I shou'd be apt to prefer that single Grot yonder, and the hanging Precipice over it, to a whole Scenary of natural Objects laid out in the most regular or∣der imaginable. There is something of this in the Pleasure which is given us by the greatest Writers. A Noble natural Genius, however irregular and uncon∣fin'd, delights us in a much higher de∣gree, than the most uniform and correct: And the Writer who enjoys this freedom of Soul, amidst all his Starts and Errors, is greatly to be prefer'd to the Justness of one, who is too severe to commit a Fault, and too cool and phlegmatick to be a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et.</P>
<P>Such a temper (reply'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> can never produce any thing truly Great. The noblest Poet in the World has not the fewest Faults: and the same Spirit which qualified <HI>Homer</HI> to be so, is what at the same time might hurry him away from a nicer Observation of some little Particulars. The very Negligencies of <HI>Homer</HI> shew the Greatness of his Spirit: and where there may be any like Negligencies
<PB N="5" REF="182"/>
in the Version of <HI>Homer,</HI> me∣thinks, it wou'd be but Justice to at∣tribute them to the same Cause: at least where the Spirit of that Poet is so discernible, as it is in this late Tran∣slation.</P>
<P>I cannot but smile sometimes, when I hear a severer Reader very gravely condemning a Poem for a few Faults, which may be evident in it here and there. Nothing can be plainer than that our Judgments ought to be form'd upon the Whole, and not upon Particu∣lars: the Superiority of Beauties or D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fects is the only thing that can deter∣mine the Character of the Piece. 'Tis possible that Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> may have ex∣press'd a word or two correctly, where the New Translation has deviated into a Metaphorical or licentious Expression: but what a strange method of Compari∣son would it be, to settle our opinion of the Writers from hence? By such a way of proceeding we might prefer one, who loses the Life and Vigour of Poetry throughout, to others who preserve it so strongly in the general Turn of their Compositions.</P>
<P>As we go on, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> with our u∣sual freedom of speaking our Sentiments on each particular Passage; I dare say,
<PB N="6" REF="183"/>
that even all those, which may seem faulty to us, will make but a small fi∣gure, when compar'd to the several Ex∣cellencies of this Piece. As for my part, after a Research of some care thro' the whole Translation, I find no reason at all to alter my Opinion, <Q>That the Beau∣ties of it are far more numerous, and far more considerable, than its Ble∣mishes: even taking all those things for <HI>real</HI> Blemishes, which we may only <HI>imagine</HI> to be such.</Q></P>
<P>If the fashionable Choice of <HI>Verse</HI> be justly blameable; it may as justly be said that no one moves with more freedom in his Fetters. In particular Lines, there may be some farther disagreeable <HI>Like∣nesses</HI> of Sound; but the <HI>Variety</HI> of Num∣bers in general is great and handsome: What Smoothness and Harmony do we find thro' the course of the Poem; and how seldom are they interrupted either by the <HI>Littleness,</HI> or the <HI>Vastness</HI> of the Words? by the <HI>Openness</HI> of the Vowels, the <HI>Clashing</HI> of Consonants, or any other Roughnesses whatever: Not to mention against these, that <HI>Significance</HI> of Sound, which is more frequent, and more hap∣pily practis'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in parti∣cular, than by any other of the Modern Poets.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="184"/>
As to the <HI>Diction;</HI> not only the Poem but our Language itself is enrich'd by it. Where it is once Mean, it is in many instances Great, Noble, and Solemn. Where a Simplicity beyond our Taste is to be preserv'd, we may expect some Flatnesses: And it may be to these per∣haps we owe that Justness and Purity, which in so many places makes us ima∣gine, that we are conversing with Per∣sons of those First Ages of the World, in all their Plainness and Honesty of Beha∣viour. At other times the Narration is rais'd, and the Images strengthen'd by a figurative way of speaking, tho' no doubt, in some cases, to excess: but these Excesses may well be pass'd over, when we consider, that they proceed from Liberties, which are highly useful in rendering the Stile the more various and poetical; so far, as frequently to im∣prove upon <HI>Homer</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Above all, is that <HI>flame</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> dif∣fus'd thro' the whole Poem; and often∣times so well kept up, as to make us forget, that we are reading a Transla∣tion. When we are engag'd in the Piece, do not the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> Sen∣timents we meet with perpetually, make a few Thoughts, which have something <HI>cold</HI> or <HI>little</HI> in them, appear inconsiderable
<PB N="8" REF="185"/>
upon the first Comparison? What <HI>Eclaircisements</HI> have we, and how little <HI>Obscurity?</HI> What a number of natural Thoughts, Images, and Descriptions might be produc'd, to over-ballance such Lines in it, as may seem to be Af∣fected, or too Artificial?</P>
<P>Thus which ever way we turn our∣selves, whether we consider the <HI>Poetical Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Language,</HI> or the <HI>Versification;</HI> in each of them the Beauties far exceed the Defects. It is with this Notion we ought to proceed in our Enquiries: we must carry this Thought all along with us. Let us remember <HI>Philypsus,</HI> <Q>That all human Excellence stands merely on Comparison: that no one is without Faults, and that very few arrive in any tolerable degree towards Perfecti∣on: That Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> does not only ap∣pear among the Few, but that his Su∣periority is every way visible: If we compare his Compositions in general with those of our other Poets, the Disproportion is as great, as when we compare the Blemishes of his own Poetry, with the Beauties which every where abound in it.</Q></P>
<P>Some of these we are now to consider; and we may enter on this View with the greater Pleasure, as we have the advantage
<PB N="9" REF="186"/>
of Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> own Observations in se∣veral Points, both as to those things, in which he met with the greatest difficul∣ty; and the Methods he has taken of raising his Language, and improving the Versification.</P>
<P>One of the greatest Sources of raising, as well as enlarging the Poetical Lan∣guage, is by inventing New Words, or importing old Ones from a foreign Soil. Words, when they are us'd vulgarly, grow mean: Like other Fashions, when their use is once got among the Populace, they soon begin to be rejected by the politer Part of the World. This it is (as <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art de bien Parler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Part 1. Chap. 4. Sect. 5.</NOTE> the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of <HI>Port Royal</HI> very justly observe) which necessitates the introducing of New Words into every Language; it occasions a continual Decay, and demands continual Supplies. Thus whoever has a Felicity this way, is a Benefactor to the Publick: he adds so much to the Bank; and gives his Assist∣ance in supporting the present Credit of Language among us.</P>
<P>It wou'd be equally trifling and la∣borious, to give all the particular In∣stances of this Version's enriching our Language. It is every where visible; there
<PB N="10" REF="187"/>
is no reading a Book in the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> with∣out observing it frequently. You will almost constantly find his new Words to be apt, easy, and poetical. Sometimes he introduces the Expressions, and even the <HI>Peculiarities</HI> of other Languages into our own: These, when unforc'd, please us very particularly, by the Variety, and Novelty, they bring along with them. We admire the Stranger in our Habit; and are extremely taken to see him look as free and easy as if he were a Native, and had been always truly English.</P>
<P>The Poet has the same Art and De∣licacy in <HI>Connecting</HI> two Words into one, a thing much more difficult than <HI>Invent∣ing:</HI> The Union is proper and insensi∣ble; there is no Knot, where they are ingrafted: in short, they <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thus: <HI>Mellif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous, attemper'd; ever-shady, ill-perswading, serpent-mazes,</HI> and several others in this Translation.</NOTE> may be said rather to grow into one another, than to be brought together by Art. I do not say, that this hits so na∣turally in all the Instances; there may be <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Thus perhaps: <HI>Sea-girt, end-long, love∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttied, woman-state,</HI> &amp;c. in the same.</NOTE> some Words less tractable, or less harmonious than others: But in

general we may affirm, that as his Translation is wrought off from a Lan∣guage, which in this Respect greatly ex∣ceeds all that ever were; So the Imita∣tions of it, this way, are unusually Beauti∣ful and Harmonious.</P>
<P>To deviate from the strict Rules which Grammarians wou'd impose on Words, ei∣ther single, or as they stand in their relati∣ons to one another, gives an agreeable un∣common Air to Language; but in the very Notion of it carries something of diffi∣culty, and niceness along with it. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> seems to have thought it the safest way in such Cases to follow or resemble those Deviations, which have been al∣ready Authoriz'd by some Masterly hand: and where he strikes more boldly into any new Freedom, he is generally careful of giving things such an Openness, that they may neither perplex the Sense, nor em∣barrass the Period.</P>
<P>A thing more useful and agreeable than either of these, is to turn the stream of Words out of their common Chan∣nel.—There is a good deal of Stiffness, which yet attends our Language, from the stated order of Words in such a re∣peated Succession: and tho' we are much freer than our Neighbours the <HI>French</HI> in this particular, I shou'd be glad to
<PB N="12" REF="189"/>
see our Poets, at least, go yet farther to∣wards the Liberties of the old <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has some strokes toward this: he is sometimes bold in va∣rying the expected range of Words, to give his Sentences a new and agreeable air: he transposes their order, often by his own Judgment, and often in imi∣tation of some of our best Poets, who have succeeded in it before.</P>
<P>I wou'd not have a certain Gramma∣rian, or two, over-hear me commending these Liberties so freely: it wou'd cer∣tainly cost one a Dispute. You know the Men: they are as strict in the Puncti∣lio's of Words, as some formal People are in the little Points of Behaviour. I warrant you, your Neighbour, The Doctor, wou'd stand as strictly upon the <HI>Nominative Case's going before the Verb,</HI> as <HI>Wicquefort</HI> wou'd for the Precedence of an Embassador: 'Tis certain he can settle all the Rules of Place from unde∣niable Authorities; disposes of the Up∣per-hand with perfect Oeconomy; and, upon the whole, would make an Excellent <HI>Master of the Ceremonies</HI> among Words and Syllables.</P>
<P>However, with this Gentleman's leave, there are several just <HI>Liberties</HI> which may be allow'd for varying the Poetical
<PB N="13" REF="190"/>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plurimae sint locutiones <HI>apud Poetas usita∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssimae,</HI> &amp; in primis <HI>elegantes,</HI> quae scriptis Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cis usurpatae etiam Grammaticae leges violant. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Trapp</HI>'s Prael. Poet. Page 49, &amp;c. to Page 53.</NOTE> Stile: and many Aids, proper to enliven and elevate it in the more no∣ble Parts of a Poem.</P>
<P>Among the latter, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has made very good use of Antiquated Words; and no less of Expressions borrow'd from our Translation of the Sacred Writings. The Language of Scripture, as it is receiv'd from the first with a certain religious Awe, will still retain something venera∣ble, and august: it may therefore be of signal Service in giving to the He∣roick Muse that Majesty, which so well becomes the Sublime Air she ought to assume. 'Tis much the same in the re∣vival of old Words: Antiquity always carries a sort of Solemnity with it, in its very Roughnesses and Decays: The <HI>Ru∣stick</HI> strikes the Mind, as strongly, as any thing in Architecture; and Ruins themselves have often something awful and majestick in them.</P>
<P>I wou'd not willingly interrupt you (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> but the humour of heap∣ing superannuated Words in some late Po∣ems, is too provoking to be pass'd by. How have our <HI>Miltonick</HI> Writers, in par∣ticular,
<PB N="14" REF="191"/>
prostituted them on all occasions: in what an undistinguishing manner do they labour to draw into their Works, any word which their great Master has adopted into his <HI>Paradise Lost?—Erst, Nathless, Behests, Welkin,</HI> and a Thou∣sand other Expressions of equal beauty and agreeableness of Sound, are repeated ten times in every Sheet of theirs: in short, these Gentlemen have made me quite sick of People's going two Hun∣dred Years backward for their Language; and furnishing out half their Poems from the Vocabularies annex'd to <HI>Spencer</HI> and <HI>Chaucer.</HI></P>
<P>As for some of those Writers (reply'd <HI>Antiphaus</HI> calmly) You have reason to be angry with them; but if we may reject any thing meerly for the <HI>abuse</HI> of it, there is nothing of the greatest <HI>use,</HI> that we may not fairly reject. <HI>Virgil</HI> made par∣ticular use of this method in his Poems, and was <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cum sint verba Propria, sicta, translata; Pro∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iis dignitatem dat <HI>Antiquitas: eo ornamento</HI> Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st usus.

well to imagine any thing of that nature. And even of those, that have follow'd his Example, there is one or two who make good use of them. This we see in <HI>Philips</HI>'s pieces; not to mention the new <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>WINTER:</HI> by Mr. <HI>Thompson.</HI></NOTE> Poem we were reading the other Day: the Author of which, beside several other Beauties, is by no means unhappy in his Management of this sort of Words. I agree with you, the <HI>Abuse</HI> of them is frequent, and much to be condemn'd: If perpetual, they run into a meer Bar∣barism; and indeed where-ever they are thrust in, without any other reason ex∣cept their being Ancient, they give a Roughness and Disorder, instead of the proper Solemnity: But when they are plac'd here and there with Judgment, they support the greatness of our Ideas, and reflect a venerableness on the subject. Were the Old Oaks, that are left stand∣ing in the Gardens of <HI>Blenheim,</HI> more numerous, that Design might have too much of the Forest in it: but as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, they serve to communicate the nobler <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir of Antiquity to the things about them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd appear in a Majesty of Years, equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Grandeur of the Place.</P>
<P>I wou'd desire you to commend the in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion of Solemn Words, only as they
<PB N="16" REF="193"/>
are proper to the Places in which they are us'd. We see by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Obser∣vations on this Head, that he understands the Benefit of them perfectly well; as his Works shew that he practises up to his own Rules; and scarce ever inserts either the Words of former Centuries, or the Language of Scripture, but where the Subject demands a solemn and vene∣rable Turn.</P>
<P>As these are the chief Methods of <HI>en∣nobling</HI> the Poetick Stile; so the chief to <HI>enliven</HI> it, is the free and various use of <HI>Epithets.</HI> No one thing is of greater service to the Poets for distinguishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Language from Prose. This has oc∣casion'd that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eo <HI>(Epitheto)</HI> poetae &amp; frequentius &amp; libe∣rius u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untur: Namque illis satis est conveni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> verbo, cui apponitur; &amp; ita <HI>Dentes albi, &amp; Humi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Vina</HI> in his non reprehenduntur. <HI>Quintil.

'Tis partly from his uncommon liberties this way, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> looks upon his Epithets, as one of the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pref. to <HI>Il.</HI> p. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Distinguishing</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="194"/>
<HI>Marks</HI> of that Poet. In <HI>Homer</HI> they have on several accounts a peculiar air: and this Translation not only pre∣serves their proper beauties, but shews many Methods of improving upon them. Sometimes the Old are set in a stronger light, and sometimes New ones added with a peculiar grace: Sometimes several are applied to the same thing, without <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Huge, horrid, vast! <HI>Od.</HI> 5, 227<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>175.</NOTE> that strictness of connexion, which wou'd <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Dem. Phal. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> flatten the energy of them; and where the poverty of our Language will not con∣vey their full Sense in the Conciseness of the Original, they are enlarged upon in the Translation, and laid more open to our view.</P>
<P>Epithets, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> like Pictures in Miniature, are often entire descriptions in one Word. This may be either from their own significance, or by their im∣mediate connexion with some known ob∣ject. We see the thing, when the Poet only mentions the <HI>Nodding Crest</HI> of an Hero; and form a larger Idea of <HI>Jove</HI> from the single Epithet of <HI>Cloud-compel∣ling,</HI> than we might find in a description more diffuse. It was chiefly from <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note on <HI>Il.</HI> 1, 683.</NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="195"/>
<HI>two Poetical Epithets,</HI> that <HI>Phidias</HI> de∣sign'd the countenance of his <HI>Olympian Jupiter;</HI> as, in Reverse, we often see the Person in his Epithet, from our being acquainted with some Statue, or Pi∣cture, to which it refers: Thus when <HI>Apollo</HI> is call'd the <HI>Archer-God,</HI> it recalls to our memory the representations we have so often seen of that Deity: the compleat Figure is rais'd up in the Mind, by touching upon that single circum∣stance.</P>
<P>'Tis by the same means, that one single Epithet gives us the Idea of any Object, which has been common and fa∣miliar to us. Meadows, Fields, Woods, Rivers, and the Sea itself, are often imag'd by one well-chosen word. Thus in that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 85.</NOTE> beautiful Description of <HI>Calypso</HI>'s Bower, you see the Groves <HI>of living green;</HI> the Alders <HI>ever quivering;</HI> the <HI>nodding</HI> Cypress, and its high Branches, <HI>waving</HI> with the Storm: 'Tis by Epithets that the ancient Poets paint their <HI>Elysian Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves;</HI> and the Modern, their <HI>Windsor-Forests.</HI></P>
<P>Where our Language will not admit of this conciseness, we find the Image preserv'd by a Description more full and diffusive; thus,

<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 9, 67—56.</NOTE> O'er Heavens pure Azure spreads the grow∣ing light.</L></Q></P>
<P>I shou'd think that the Opening of the Sense in a larger Compass may often be approv'd, even where we are not driven to it by the poverty of our Lan∣guage. <HI>Homer</HI> himself, who has the advantage of single Words so much stronger and more significant, often chuses to draw out his Sentiments, into several Lines: and sometimes <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">N<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which is beautifully express'd by <HI>Horace</HI> in three words <HI>(ni∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m lubricus aspici)</HI> is enlarged by <HI>Homer</HI> himself, on a fit occasion, into three lines: Compare Ιλ. λ, 16, with ν', 340.</NOTE> the very same Sentiment, which upon other Oc∣casions he has express'd in one word on∣ly. May not the same Liberty be al∣low'd to his Translators? Is it not a fine Enlargement for Instance, where <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> is speaking of <HI>Penelope's Veil</HI> with the Epithet of <HI>Pellucid</HI> only, to say that <Q>the Transparent Veil
<L><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 18, 250—209. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Her beauty seems and only seems to shade.</L></Q></P>
<P>Tho' these imaging and descriptive Epithets are the more Beautiful, those which add Strength and Emphasis are
<PB N="20" REF="197"/>
by no means to be contemn'd. This way they are of great Service in all <HI>Sa∣tire;</HI> and particularly in that Abusive∣ness, which <HI>Homer</HI> is not over nice in be∣stowing upon his Gods: they appear well in the Ridicule of the Suitors; and are strong and vehement in any <HI>Arro∣gant Character,</HI> particularly in all Con∣temners of the Gods. I shall give you only one instance of the latter; from <HI>Polypheme</HI>'s Answer to <HI>Ulysses:</HI></P>

<P>You must have observ'd <HI>(Philypsus)</HI> se∣veral other Methods of using Epithets po∣etically.

<PB N="21" REF="198"/>
and at others, two <HI>Thwarting Ideas</HI> are mixt together in a very agreeable man∣ner. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> is the first I know of, that observ'd upon these, and gave them their Name, and of this kind is the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od</HI> 4, 320—230.</NOTE> <HI>Vege∣table Venom</HI> in the fourth <HI>Odyssey,</HI> which an∣swers <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Addison</HI>'s <HI>Misc.</HI> Vol. 1. p. 245. 120.</NOTE> his Instance of <HI>Aurum Frondens</HI> from <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether I perfectly appre∣hend you, or not (interpos'd <HI>Philypsus):</HI> Do You not mean that particular sort of Metaphor, when some strange <HI>quality</HI> in a thing, is turn'd into an <HI>Epithet,</HI> and di∣rectly applied to it?—Either that; or else some strange Circumstance applied in the same manner: in both 'tis the No∣velty and the Surprize, that please us.—I take you, says <HI>Philypsus;</HI> and believe I now see a farther Reason, why a very natural Passage (in another Poem by Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> has always been so agreeable to me. 'Tis where he speaks of the odd Appear∣ance of things from their inversion in a River: I think I can repeat it:</P>

<P><PB N="22" REF="199"/>
These are of the kind I mean, says <HI>An∣tiphaus;</HI> they are bold, but they are na∣tural: Indeed with due caution, greater Contrarieties than these may be join'd, under some particular Circumstance, to justify so unexpected an Union. Thus all Epithets, which contradict the gene∣ral Sense of the Thing, but agree with the particular Occasion; Thus is <HI>Grief</HI> call'd <HI>pleasing;</HI> there are <HI>Kindnesses</HI> which are <HI>terrible</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">As when the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> in the height of his good nature, promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that he shall be the last he will devour. <HI>Od.</HI> 9.</NOTE>: And in many cases <HI>Death</HI> and even <HI>Disgrace</HI> may be <HI>desirable.</HI> In∣stances of this kind, are very frequent, especially among our modern Poets.

<P>Tho' the <HI>Latins</HI> us'd this agreeable Clash of Ideas, <HI>the Greek Poets</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sc.</HI> Vol. 1. p. 245. 120.</NOTE> observes on the former Head) <HI>wanted Art for it;</HI> They, at least the more Ancient of them, never join things that seem to disagree, in so close an Union.

<P>The Misfortune is, that in all Human Excellencies there will be an Alloy: Faults spring out of our Improvements themselves; and the very methods of Beautifying lead often into Blemishes. The way to any Perfection is full of Difficulties and Windings on each side; and every step out of the right Path (tho' they cross each other every Mo∣ment) is a wandering from our Design. In a word, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> 'tis much the same with Errors and Improvements, as it is with Pleasure and Pain in the Philo∣sopher's Fable: they are blended together in such a manner, that it is impossible to come at the one, without touching upon the other.</P>
<P>All the Methods which are us'd in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Translation, and which are so often of great Efficacy towards beau∣tifying and improving the Diction, may sometimes fall under a different Cha∣racter.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="201"/>
Among the Words which are intro∣duc'd from other Languages into our own, there may be <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dexter, circumfusile, variegated <HI>Od.</HI> 15, 145.</NOTE> some, which still retain too much of the air of Foreigners: As antiquated Words may <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Seneschal, viands, bev'rage, irefull 3, 179.</NOTE> look too Grotesque, or have a rough disagreea∣ble sound.

<P>Next to the importing of Words New to the Poetical Stile, is the varying the use of the Old. To deviate from the strictness of Grammar, is what gave a rise to Rhetorick; and surely there are few who wou'd not prefer all the beau∣tiful Forms and Figures of the latter (at least for Poetry and Oratory) to that bare correctness, which alone is the Pro∣vince of the former: Yet there may be Innovations on this too harsh or daring; and Figures, that may look more like Patchwork, than true Ornaments in the Dress of Poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="202"/>

<P>There is another disagreement in Epi∣thets, when two Expressions, proper in themselves, are yet join'd together im∣properly.

<P>An Error yet more frequent is, when we give a word that Epithet, which is proper to it on some Occasions, indiffe∣rently at all times, and without any Oc∣casion.</P>
<P>This, in some Measure, has been al∣ways allowable in Verse: however such a Liberty is not without its bounds, nor should it be used intemperately. <HI>Purple</HI> (for instance) is an Epithet very frequent in the Ancient Poets for the Habit of Princes: yet it is not to be given to that of all Great Men; nor of Princes equally,

<P>Again: What is proper in one Lan∣guage, may not be so in another. Was any one to Translate the <HI>purpureis Oloribus</HI> of <HI>Horace, Purple Swans,</HI> would not he be so <HI>Literal,</HI> as to miss the <HI>Sense</HI> of his Author entirely?</P>
<P>There may be another Impropriety from the difference of time and circum∣stances: It may do very well to give the Epithet of <HI>browzing,</HI> to a Goat; or <HI>gra∣zing,</HI> to the Ox: it helps to describe them in the Fields, or to distinguish them from some other Creatures; and if neither of these, at least it gives the Language a Poetical Air: Yet these Epithets have some restraints, they belong to Life and Action; they do not suit with those very Creatures, when Dead; and less so, when they are cut out in the Shambles, or serv'd up at a Feast: this is the Case in a Passage relating to <HI>Penelope's</HI> Suitors; they,</P>

Any mixture of this Nature is more evident in Epithets, for that obvious Reason I mention'd before.

<P>A perfect Indifference (answer'd <HI>Anti∣phaus)</HI> is no more attainable, than a per∣fect Excellence, by a Creature made up of so many Passions, as is Man. We must poise ourselves with all the Steadiness we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Masters of; and when those Di∣sturbers will be interfering, the best way is to turn their own Artillery upon them: and to play one Passion against another. If the superiour Merit of a Writer, or his engaging Way, is apt to captivate us so far as to raise any partial regards in us; we must stop, and Consider what we owe to Truth, the most beautifull and commanding thing in the World: On the contrary, where-ever we begin to feel a malicious Pleasure in finding out the Faults of great Men, we must break off that humour as soon as perceiv'd, by turning immediately to some of the finest Passages in their Works, and indulging that Delight and Admiration they raise in us.</P>

These passionate <HI>Breaks</HI> are one of the finest things in Poetry.

the Narration is dropt in the most en∣gaging parts of it, or just before some very material Incident: This adds a double desire of hearing: the Audience generally make it their Request, that the Speaker would go on, and inform them of the Sequel.

<P>I have often taken notice of this Arti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice, says <HI>Philypsus.</HI> 'Tis very usual in the Close of the particular Books, not only of this Poem, but equally of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid.</HI>—Were it not a thing pretty obvious in itself, I should be apt to imagine, that it was from this practice of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> that those prudent

Authors, who write for Sale, had learnt what is so common among them: Thus in our Books of Adventures and Romance, we seldom meet with a First Part, which does not break off in such a point of the Story, as may be most apt to engage the Expectation of the Reader; and to draw him in for that most tedious thing in the World, vulgarly call'd, <HI>A Second Part.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet another sort of Breaks, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> which proceed not from the Artifice of the Writer, but the Passion he feels upon some great or unexpected Calamity. There might be Instances of this given from the Poem before us: but we must go to another Piece of Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> for the finest that ever I met with in my Life.

<P>To be more plain: Our Passions are often too strong to be express'd immedi∣ately by words; they often choak up the passage for them: and yet at the same time they are most apparent.

The Recovery of <HI>Ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses</HI> is the Incident of the greatest concern to all his Friends, and must be attended with the strongest flow of Passion in them: accordingly they are each too much mov'd with the discovery, to utter their Sentiments on that Occasion. <HI>Telemachus</HI> is the first to whom <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes himself known: He falls on his Father's Neck, and they con∣tinue embracing each other, without speaking <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 16, 243—220.</NOTE> for a considerable time.—We have a like Scene, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 21, 240—226<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> when he discovers himself to two or three select Friends: Good old <HI>Laertes,</HI> on the same Occasion is not only silent, but scarce <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 24, 404—346.</NOTE> able to support himself, under such an excess of Passion, And the fond, tender <HI>Penelope,</HI> is quite overcome with it:

When we are agitated by the Expectation of some Bliss, we long to indulge that Flow of Spirits which it Occasions; only some particular Caution forces us to restrain them in the midst of their Career: The moment our Doubt is clear'd, and the Obstacle remov'd, they rush on with the greater Violence and Impetuosity.

Such an Hurry of Spirits, the more violent it is, makes us speak in the more broken and interrupted manner.

You observe, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> that this Event which is so often anticipated by the Poet, is the great Point on which the Comple∣tion of his Fable turns: and I believe you may have observ'd, that <HI>Virgil</HI> puts on the Prophetick air, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Aen.</HI> 10, 501.</NOTE> exactly in the same Case. <HI>Virgil</HI> oftentimes improves upon his Master: the Circumstance that introduces that Passage in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and the greater distance of time, give it a much finer and a nobler Air, than we find in <HI>Homer</HI> himself.</P>

<P>I am pleased to see that this Figure stands on such good reason; for it is the very Life and Soul of Description. And might it not be of a larger Use, <HI>Anti∣phaus,</HI> than has commonly been observ'd? It is chiefly mention'd indeed of enliven∣ing things inanimate; Whereas possibly it may hold thro' the whole Chain of Be∣ings in the World, as they rise gradually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bove one another. Thus when we at∣tribute any thing of absolute Perfection to the highest Orders of created Beings,

any thing which we think Angelical to Man, or any thing like Humanity or Virtue to Beasts; it might as well be in∣cluded in this Branch of Metaphor, as when we give the Powers of Motion to things, Still; or Passions, to things Ina∣nimate.</P>
<P>Nay, it may even return from the Lower to the Higher; when the Species of a lower Rank, upon the whole, has any <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">As when we amplify the Swiftness of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hero, by comparing it to the Flight of an Eagle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or</NOTE> particular Excellence which the higher wants: Or partakes of any <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">the Swiftness of an Eagle, by comparing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Swiftness of the Winds.</NOTE> Excellence, which is common to them both, in a greater and more excellent Degree.</P>
<P>But it must be observ'd, that where this Figure, in its higher Notion, is applied to Intelligents, it must not be done with the same Indifference; or rather it requires the strictest Caution.</P>
<P>The Poet is at liberty to attribute Action and Passions to any part whatever of the mute Creation: he may make the Woods, or any such Insensible, Sympa∣thize with his Grief, with the same free∣dom as any inferiour Animals; we find it thus used particularly in all the <HI>Pastorol</HI>

<P>Surely they who are the most rigid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Close-translating, will allow such beautiful Variations as these; which, without losing the Sentiments of the Ori∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inal, only set a finer Turn upon them.
<PB N="74" REF="251"/>
Let them call them, if they please, glo∣rious Offences, or beautiful Wandrings from the Letter: these are such Offences as one would wish to see more frequent than they are; and of which the best Translators are the most guilty.</P>
<P>For my part I am particularly pleased, when I see a Translator reflect new Light upon his Original: where-ever this is done justly, it does not alter the Objects; it only makes them more bright and visible.</P>

<P>A Metaphor may be continu'd too far, as well as carried too high: a long Chain of them leads us away from the proper Sense; and flings that into <HI>Alle∣gory,</HI> which we intend for <HI>Reality strongly express'd.</HI> This is very common, especi∣ally in our <HI>Pindarick</HI> Writers: indeed few of our Poets, but what have <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Od.</HI> 19, 286—251. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 20.

<P>In these <HI>strings</HI> of Metaphor, nothing in my Opinion is so faulty, as that Point which has been so often touch'd upon: the shifting of Circumstances in the same Description; and representing a Thing confusedly, sometimes in its <HI>figurative,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd sometimes in its <HI>proper</HI> Appearance.

By degrees the Allegory is form'd regularly, and enlarg'd with more Particulars: he has so many Horses assign'd to his Chariot: His own Appearance is well known: Beardless and Young, A Glory round his Head, and a Quiver full of Arrows o'er his Shoulder: <HI>Thetis</HI> is ready to re∣ceive him at the End of his Journey; and when he is to set out again, <HI>Aurora</HI> rises from the Ocean to open the <HI>Gates of Heaven,</HI> that are kept for him by the <HI>Hours.</HI></P>
<P>How very regular can Fiction be upon Occasion? The establishment of this Allegory under these Particulars, has pre∣vented a world of Confusion: this we may see by any Allegory, which is not yet settled on some Uniform Plan. To shew how far, I shall beg leave to en∣large a little on one of the same Nature, That of <HI>Aurora,</HI> the Goddess of the Morning.</P>

of; As for <HI>Aurora,</HI> I know not whe∣ther she rides, sits, or walks: Sometimes she is in Heaven, and sometimes upon Earth: In short, the Poets seem to leave it undetermin'd how, when, or for what time she makes her Appearance. I have laid together several Passages relating to this, but they leave the Point as confus'd as it was before:
<Q><L>Now did the rosy-finger'd Morn arise,</L>

<P>Here I cannot absolutely determine, whether she be in Heaven, or upon Earth; but 'tis plain, she is got into her Chariot now, as she was pleas'd to Walk the time before.</P>
<P>But when it is evident, that she is not upon Earth; 'tis still difficult to know
<PB N="81" REF="258"/>
whether she is near it, or in the higher Heavens: whether she
<Q><L>—Ascends the Court of <HI>Jove,</HI></L>

<P>There is the same difference in the degrees of that Brightness, which is at∣tributed to her appearance: sometimes she only <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Il.</HI> 11, 1.</NOTE> <HI>blushes with new-born Day,</HI> and sometimes she is encompass'd with <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Il.</HI> 8, 83—66.</NOTE> <HI>the full splendor of it:</HI> When I read one Description, I take it for granted, that the Glory round her Head should be of <HI>a</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 9, 515—437.</NOTE> <HI>glimmering Light;</HI> but when we come to another, 'tis of <HI>a strong</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 16, 381—368.</NOTE> <HI>Flame:</HI> You are at the same loss to know, whether her <HI>Robes</HI> are <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 4. 587—431.</NOTE> <HI>Rose-colour'd,</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 4. 587—431.</NOTE> <HI>Saffron,</HI> or <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 19. 500—428.</NOTE> <HI>Purple:</HI> In fine, It would puzzle the Criticks to answer directly, whether she has a <HI>Quiver</HI> on her Shoulders; and whether she is to appear in a <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Compare <HI>Od.</HI> 19, 500, with 6, 58.</NOTE> martial, or in a gentle, peaceable Posture.</P>

<P>The Translator is sometimes as Art∣sul in adding, of himself, some short Strokes to what <HI>Homer</HI> has said.

Alteration so modestly propos'd by Mr. <HI>Addison.</HI> The Reader, indeed, would willingly go off with some Hopes and Satisfaction, after the Melancholly Scene in <HI>Milton</HI>'s last Book: but it may be said that, considering the Moral and chief Design of that Poem, Terror is the last Passion to be left upon the Mind of the Reader.

<P><HI>Euryclea,</HI> You know, discovers <HI>Ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> by a Scar upon his Leg, while she is Bathing him.

Tho' these, in the Na∣ture of the Case, must follow immedi∣ately upon one another, <HI>Homer</HI> has in∣serted a long Story (how the Scar wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occasion'd) <HI>just after</HI> the Discovery, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>before</HI> those Passions, which are the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mediate Effect of it.

to Heaven, seeing the Lord knows what there, and returning again before the Water is run out.</P>
<P>If I mistake not, this Impropriety is avoided very Artfully. <HI>Euryclea</HI> is not made to discover this Scar before that long Digression. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 19, 461. And 547—392, and 467.</NOTE> It is rather said (in the Prophetick manner of the Poets) that she would soon Discover it, than that she has actually Discover'd it.

<P>If this be really the Case, says <HI>Anti∣phaus,</HI> I think the Alteration is much to be commended. But why may not <HI>Homer</HI> himself be understood to speak in the Pro∣phetick manner too? for I suppose that single Point would salve all: You do not blame the Digression itself?</P>
<P>No, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> 'tis not the Di∣gression which I blame, but the Point in which it is introduc'd; just between a Fact, and what in Nature must be im∣mediately consequent upon that Fact.
<PB N="92" REF="269"/>
If, as you ask, <HI>Homer</HI> speaks at first, only in the Prophetick manner, then it is all clear'd up: But I fear his Expressions confine it directly to a thing <HI>then done,</HI> and cannot be taken in the Prophetical way.</P>
<P><HI>Philypsus</HI> was so engag'd to this Mo∣ment, that he had not once observ'd how the Day wore away: He was sur∣priz'd to find the Night was just coming on. <Q>Why did you suffer me (says he to <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> to keep you here so long: I did not imagine the Night had been so near us: You know I am an Eter∣nal Talker—However I see the Coach is at the Door; and we may reach our Lodgings, I believe, before it is quite dark.</Q></P>

Surely, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> Men were more Virtuous in the days of <HI>Homer,</HI> than they were in the time of <HI>Plato</HI> or <HI>Cicero;</HI> at least, they were more charitable, and tender to Strangers.

<P><HI>Homer</HI> (in relation to <HI>Strangers)</HI> does not stint the Charity of his Countrymen to the common <HI>Use of Fire and Water:</HI> he seems rather to proportion the <HI>bounty</HI> to the <HI>want;</HI>

<P>I doubt not, but this Notion of the Gods wandering on Earth in a disguis'd manner, was a very common motive to Charity in those times: it is mention'd very strongly in the Original, in this place; and <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 7, 265—199.</NOTE> afterwards, when <HI>Ulysses</HI> appears as a Suppliant among the <HI>Phoea∣cians.</HI></P>

<P>I ought not to dissemble one thing; That the Translation is not to be trusted entirely in this Argument: we find these Passages improv'd in the Handling; and those Lines, in which they resemble our sacred Writings, may be drawn more strongly. However, the Original it self may give us a great deal of reason to suppose, either that <HI>Homer</HI> had borrow'd some lights from thence; or that he cou'd discern the Light of Nature more

<P>Before I compar'd Passages, I must own to you, that I was in particular ex∣pectation of Improvements from Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> under this Article. A virtuous gene∣rous Soul is certainly as necessary to con∣stitute a Great Poet, as a Great Orator: and in Sentiments like these, we may discover that temper of Mind, which I dare say has contributed much towards making that Gentleman so good a Poet, as well as so good a Friend.</P>
<P>There is one particular more extreme∣ly frequent in <HI>Homer:</HI> it runs thorough all his Works; and is scarce once omit∣ted, where there is any occasion for it. I believe your Thoughts outrun me, and might prevent my saying, that I mean His Reflections on the Miseries of this Life.

<P>I shall beg leave to close this Head with two Sentiments, as much celebrated as any in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and spoke by the two Heroes we have been talking of. The one, in the mere Spirit of an Hero;

<P>I am sorry, says <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> you have quitted this Point so soon, methinks you might afford a little more room for a thing of such considerable Use. <HI>Sen∣tences</HI> are fitted by their Nature to car∣ry on that Chief design of Poetry, to mix the <HI>Useful</HI> with the <HI>Agreeable.</HI>—To∣gether with a certain air of Authority, they serve to establish the Poets Moral Character; which, according to a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Origin</HI> of our Ideas of <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Virtue.</HI></NOTE> late Hypothesis, may render him at the same time more <HI>delightful,</HI> as well as more <HI>in∣structive.</HI>—Besides this, they often flatter the Vanity of the Reader; And (as the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Arist Rhet.</HI> Lib. 2.

<P>But grant that Sentences are not pro∣per from Persons that are Young, or Vi∣cious; Grant, that they are not proper in a <HI>Mezentius,</HI> or a <HI>Portius:</HI> What then? may they not be proper in <HI>Cato</HI> himself, or in <HI>Aeneas?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis the same Case in every particular you have produc'd from the Criticks: they speak rather against the Abuse of this Ornament, than against the Orna∣ment itself. There can be no doubt of it; <HI>Sentences</HI> are certainly faulty, when they appear too grossly, and stand off from the rest of the Work: But what is this to Sentences, which are fitly applied, and wove in Artfully with the other Parts? <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> are very happy in this particular: they give them a suf∣ficient Fulness; but they never glare so, as to attract the Eye singly to themselves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> You admire them as much from their Relation to the things about them, as for their own particular Beauty: in short, they might be Beautiful by them∣selves, but they are much more so in the <HI>Tout-ensemble</HI> of the Piece.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="288"/>
We may add to this, that their Sen∣tences are so far from hindering the Nar∣ration, that they are almost constantly a part of it, and help to carry it forward: But tho' they are usually wrought into the Speeches of the Poem, we do not receive them from Persons improper; or hurried by any violent Passion: and where the Subject is still and gentle, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alm Wisdom,</HI> that has been objected to them, cannot be very prejudicial. In∣deed in any place, or on any Occasion, a long thread of them is insupportable; these are worse than the <HI>Sanchoisms</HI> of <HI>Cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antes,</HI> because they are not so ridi∣culous: We can laugh at <HI>Sancho</HI> all the time he is multiplying his Proverbs upon us; but in Poetry, such dry Preachments are, of all other, the greatest Opiates, and have the quickest effect on the Audience. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>can</HI>'s Poem and <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Tragedies, not∣withstanding all their Beauties, are In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ances of this to a great degree.</P>
<P>There is another way of murthering Sentences, for which we are wholly o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lig'd to those ingenious Gentlemen, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ditors.</HI> It is that Art of cutting off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entences from the Body of a Work, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcing them <HI>to jut out</HI> from it, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey will or no, by Printing all such, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here-ever they can catch them, in <HI>Italick</HI>

<HI>Characters.</HI> Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> if I remem∣ber, is condemning this Practice in that very place where he says, that <HI>Sentences are some of the heaviest Pieces</HI> in a Poem: and I imagine nothing could make him speak so severely of them in general, but this Practice that is so destructive of their Beauty.</P>
<P>In short, Sentences that are cold, affected, or ill-placed, such as are either too distinct, or too much throng'd, may be blam'd with a great deal of Justice: but such as are handsomely wove into the Narration, at proper Intervals, and from none but proper Speakers, will not only be safe from the Censure of the Criticks; but are allowed by them in general, to be highly serviceable towards g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving its proper Weight and Emphas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to an <HI>Epick</HI> Poem.</P>

<P>Those Lines, says <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> serve the purpose for which you repeat them very well; but is there not something too much like a <HI>Turn</HI> upon the words in them? I was sensible of that (answer'd <HI>Philypsus)</HI> but I follow your Example, <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> in viewing a thing only in one Light at a time, to prevent the infinite Confusion that would happen in turning each Line every way. This is brought as Emphatical: You allow it to be so; if it answer the end for which it is pro∣duced, that is all that I intend: and I beg once for all to be understood under this view in every Instance that I have, or may use, on particular Occasions.</P>
<P>This masculine nervous Conciseness, I am speaking of, is very usual from Generals to their Soldiers: but among a multitude of Instances, I am particu∣larly pleas'd with that Speech of <HI>Henr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

the <HI>Great,</HI> before the Battle in the Plains of <HI>Ivry, <Q>I am your King, You are French∣men, and there are the Enemy.</Q></HI></P>
<P>Sometimes we find an Emphasis and Vigour impress'd on every particular word of a Sentence:
<Q><L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 18, 299—255.</NOTE> Now, Grief, thou all art mine!</L></Q></P>
<P>And in these Lines, which we have often admired for their peculiar Strength and Efficacy; They speak of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s ex∣tream Love of his native Country:</P>
<LG>

</LG>
<P>This is not only of use in the Grand or Pathetick: there are excellent Instan∣ces of it from <HI>Terence</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Haec verba mehercule</HI> un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> falsa lachrumula, <HI>Quam,</HI> ocul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rendo misere, vix vi expresserit, Restinguet.—Eun. <HI>Act. 1.

Ecl. 3, 27. As others from this Line: Qui Bavium <HI>non odit, amet tua carmina,</HI> Maevi. ib 90.</NOTE> some have been apt to
<PB N="116" REF="293"/>
imagine from them, that <HI>Virgil</HI> might, if he pleas'd, have made the greatest <HI>Satirist</HI> that ever wrote.</P>
<P>Sometimes this very Emphasis is en∣creas'd by a certain <HI>Opposition</HI> of the words us'd in it: there is a Passage in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which I have particularly ad∣mir'd on this Account: Give me leave to repeat it from the Original; because the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue is particularly Empha∣tical, and has more Nerves than perhaps our Language is capable of:
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ιλ. χ, 48. The <HI>Opposition</HI> is carried on far∣ther in the next Lines, between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—</P>
<P>The Emphatical manner in writing flies all Dress and Ornament, all super∣fluous and descriptive Epithets, all turns and elegancies of Thought. Hence that Conciseness, which generally attends it. The most obvious fault in Conciseness is Obscurity; what is obscure, can never be sufficiently emphatical: This makes the concise way the most difficult of any. 'Tis easy to follow the Stream of one's Imagination, and write on with an un∣thinking Rapidity; but to express every
<PB N="117" REF="294"/>
thing fully, and to say nothing that is needless, requires a great Judgment, and much force in our Expressions. The great <HI>Monsieur Pascal</HI> had a particular hap∣piness of comprizing <HI>much</HI> in a <HI>few</HI> Words: he had a very Mathematical Turn of Thought; and of all things hated an idle Prolixity. You will be pleas'd with an Excuse of his in a certain Case, where he had been guilty of it: 'Tis in the close of one of his Letters, where he begs his Friend to pardon the unusual length of it, by saying, <HI>that he really had not time to make it shorter.</HI></P>
<P>Some emphatical Passages are not only so concise, as to contain just as <HI>many Ideas</HI> as <HI>Words;</HI> they have often force enough even to <HI>intimate</HI> several Ideas more than they <HI>express.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is in all Intimations of Power. One of <HI>Homer</HI>'s greatest Excellencies lies in this. In setting off the Hero of his <HI>Iliad,</HI> he does not say in Words, that he was vastly Terrible to the Enemy; he mentions the effects, and leaves the Rea∣der to collect what Terror must attend him. After the Death of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> the whole Army of the <HI>Trojans</HI> is put into Confusion, only <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">σ', 224.</NOTE> <HI>at hearing his Voice:</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="295"/>
They are all trembling, and dispirited: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ιλ. σ', 248.</NOTE> <HI>they had seen Achilles.</HI> 'Tis not a sudden Panick; it continues upon them: When they pour'd down in such Num∣bers from the City, it was because <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>ib.</HI> π', 70.</NOTE> <HI>they did not behold the Crest of that Hero;</HI> and now they are all consulting, whe∣ther they should not quit the Field, be∣cause <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">—σ', 262.</NOTE> <HI>he had shewn himself at a distance, and might possibly enter into the next Engage∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> has the same address in intima∣ting the Power of his Deities; when he introduces them as effecting their designs with a <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ιλ. ν', 60, 75.</NOTE> <HI>Touch,</HI> with a <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>ib.</HI> ξ, 150.</NOTE> <HI>Voice,</HI> with a <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>ib.</HI> ο', 242.</NOTE> <HI>single Thought.</HI></P>
<P>It is the same Sentiment that gives their Air of Grandeur to these Lines:</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 24, 547—475.</NOTE> Declare thy purpose; for thy Will is Fate.</L>
<L><HI>Let a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be Peace.</HI>—He said; and gave the nod</L>
<L><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 24, 561—485.</NOTE> That binds the Fates, the Sanction of the God.</L>
</LG>
<P>And this, of the same import, from our <HI>Shakespear;</HI>
<Q><L>—What he bids be done,</L>
<L>Is <HI>finish'd</HI> with his bidding.—</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="296"/>
On this turns the Greatness of that Thought in the Sacred History of the Creation: <HI>God said, Let there be Light, and there was Light:</HI> Tho' I should ima∣gine this to exceed every Instance above; because it <HI>intimates,</HI> all that they <HI>express,</HI> and intimates it as <HI>fully</HI> and <HI>strongly,</HI> as they <HI>express</HI> it.</P>
<P>Let the Greatness of this Sentence stand or fall by the Rules of Sublimity. We need not mention, that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cap 9. Ed. <HI>Ox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> 1718.</NOTE> <HI>Longinus</HI> chose it for an Instance of the <HI>Sublime:</HI> whether that great Critick ever saw it or not, is not material: but I wonder, that some later Writers, of very great Name, cannot be perswaded to see any Force or Energy in it. I own, I have never read what <HI>Monsieur Le Clerc</HI> offers against the Sublimity of this Passage: Surely it would not be very difficult to answer it, if it be of a Strain with what <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Preface to <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ileau</HI>'s Works.</NOTE> <HI>Monsieur Huetius</HI> offer'd before him; Where he seems to argue, that <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Huetij Dem.

<P>It is this Art of leaving more for the Reader to collect, than you express in Words, which runs through several of

<HI>Ulysses</HI>'s Speeches; both at the Court of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> and before the <HI>Suitors.</HI> Whe∣ther the Hero tells his own Story, or feigns some other, he is equally carefull in laying before them something of the High Station he once enjoy'd: and hence his Speeches have generally a great Air of that celebrated Answer of <HI>Marius</HI> to a Message sent from the Roman General: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Life of <HI>Marius.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Go, and tell,</HI> Sextilius, <HI>that you saw</HI> Marius, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting among the Ruins of</HI> Car∣thage.</P>

<HI>Falsity,</HI> if a strong Idea of each particu∣lar be not imprinted on the Mind; and an <HI>Historical,</HI> if some things are passed over only with a general mark of Infamy or Dislike.

Cap. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Quintilian</HI> I first met with this Observation; and I wish our Historians, of all Parties, did not give us so many Examples of it, as we find every where in their Works.</P>
<P>'Tis the same in Poetry: when all the <HI>Circumstances</HI> are laid out in their proper Colours, and make a compleat Piece; its Images strike us with greater Energy, than when the <HI>Whole</HI> of the thing is on∣ly mention'd in general. Thus the <HI>dif∣fused Style</HI> has its Propriety under this Head; and makes a larger and more continu'd Impression: as the force of its contrary Excellence, a just and empha∣tical <HI>Conciseness,</HI> may be more collected, and pierce the deeper.

</LG>
<P>If this be not Total, at least it will engross Two of your Senses, whilst you keep in the same Posture; but those, as you say, seem the most compleat, which take up the Eye what ever way you turn.—As this (resum'd <HI>Philypsus)</HI> to keep to the same Element:
<Q><L><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 12, 474.</NOTE> And all above was sky, and ocean all around.</L></Q></P>
<P>These Total Views are much more vigorous and affecting, when the Objects are not inanimate: or at least, when, some more moving Considerations are annext to them. Thus in the Picture of a rough Sea, terminating in craggy Shores, and Rocks, and a tempestuous Sky, every Object has an additional Terror from our seeing <HI>Ulysses</HI> painted in the midst of these Dangers, and strug∣gling to make so difficult a Shore.—I
<PB N="128" REF="305"/>
remember a Passage of this kind in a Writer of a very strong Imagination, which is heighten'd by the same Method. We have it in a Description of Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> tho' I believe the Author took his Ideas from the <HI>Alps:</HI> 'tis deliver'd in this bold Poetical kind of Prose: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Characteristicks.</HI> Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Pag. 389.</NOTE> <Q>See, with what trembling steps poor Man∣kind tread the narrow Brink of the deep Precipices! from whence with giddy Hor∣ror they look down, mistrusting even th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ground which bears them; whilst they hear the hollow sound of Torrents underneath, and see the Ruin of the impending Rock, with falling Trees, which hang with their Roots upwards, and seem to draw more Ruin after them.—</Q></P>
<P>In these Cases, our Passions, as well as our Senses, are engag'd: and I take such Views to be then entirely compleat, when all our Passions, as well as all our Senses, may be engross'd by them. Were I to give an Instance of such a View, I should prefer that Passage in <HI>Virgil,</HI> where he places you in the midst of a City, cover'd with the dismal shades of Night, taken and fir'd in a Thousand places by the Enemy, and every where fill'd with Ruin, Terror, and Confusion:

<P>I have dwelt the longer on these <HI>Com∣prehensive Views,</HI> as they fill and delight the Mind very strongly.

<Q><L><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 23, 369.</NOTE> By Heaven above, by Hell beneath.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is a Thought of this Nature, very justly reckon'd among the Sublime, which appears with a perfect Uniformi∣ty in <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ingreditur{que} solo &amp; caput inter nubilacondit Ae <HI>4, 177.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>One of the most common Topicks for this among the Poets, is in speaking of the distance of <HI>Tartarus.

<P>This Imagination seems to be imitated in <HI>Milton,</HI> where <HI>Satan</HI> meets with that violent shock, in Travelling thro' <HI>Chaos;</HI> but the Fall here strikes us more, because it has no Bounds: It is still continuing lower and lower; and the Mind, in endeavouring to conceive it, is lost in its <HI>desired Infinitude.</HI></P>
<P>When our Bodies are all so straiten'd and confin'd, what must the Soul be made of, <HI>Antiphaus?</HI> and what might be its Powers, if unrestrain'd?

<P>Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> in one of his finest Works, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Essay on the Pleasures of the Imagination,

reckons <HI>Greatness</HI> as first among those things, which give that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spectator, Numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 412.</NOTE> Pleasure: <Q>Nothing (says he) <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Numb. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> gratifies <HI>the Mind</HI> so much, as those large growing Ideas, which lead her on almost to an Infini∣tude. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Numb. 412.</NOTE> Our Imagination loves to be fill'd with an Object, or to grasp at any thing that is too big for its Capa∣city: We are flung into a pleasing Astonishment at such unbounded Views, and feel a delightful Stillness and A∣mazement in the Soul, at the Appre∣hensions of them.</Q></P>
<P>Every one may know this Pleasure by Experience: 'Tis not a dry Maxim laid down by the Philosophers: Whoever will consult his own Mind, when he looks only on a Prospect, may say as much as Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> have on this Occasion. When I had the Pleasure of Conversing with the Gentleman, who de∣sign'd these Gardens, (as indeed the Fi∣nest in the Nation owe their Beauty to his Directions) I was very much pleas'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a Maxim which he then mention'd <Q>That as the greatest <HI>fault</HI> in a Prospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was Confinement; So the <HI>meanest</HI> thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too in a Design, was to have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Bounds and Restraint of it immediate∣ly visible.</Q></P>
<P>There may be several other Points to be consider'd under the Character of Emphatical, whether from the <HI>Strength</HI> of the Language, the <HI>Nobleness</HI> of the Sentiment, or the <HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the Object itself: but I am only giv∣ing a few Sketches of the Kind: You will give me leave, in the same manner, to take a short View of its Contrary, the <HI>Low</HI> or <HI>Mean Stile.</HI></P>
<P>It has been said, That <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadem fere est ratio minuendi: Nam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oti∣dem sunt descendentibus, quot ascendentibus gradus. <HI>Quintil. Instit.</HI> Lib. 8.

Things over-wrought, as well as things under-wrought, will be Mean.</P>
<P>When the least Object is express'd in just and proper Terms, it will not of itself come under the Character of Mean∣ness: Nay, small things may be manag'd so, as to change their Nature, and to
<PB N="134" REF="311"/>
compose the <HI>Grand Air.</HI> We meet with Dissertations on the late Discoveries in the lesser World of Animals, which have something Great and Sublime in them. Littleness itself may be assistant too in Amplifying a Subject: <HI>Homer</HI> uses it thus in his Character of <HI>Tydeus;</HI> and 'tis visible to any one, That bold Martial Atcheivments look greater in a <HI>Nassa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> than they wou'd in a <HI>Maximin.</HI></P>
<P>Such Considerations as these have in∣duc'd me to imagine, That all Meanness arises from some <HI>Disproportion,</HI> or other. When a Person is represented in a View beneath himself, or any Action of Force is express'd weakly, the Expressions fall short of the Nature of the Thing: Again, that Meanness, which arises from the Language, may have the same Measure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The Close of a Sentence may fall beneat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Expectance rais'd in the Beginnin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it, and then will necessarily have a mean Air. Some sorts of Poetry are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a nobler kind; and Descriptions of things that would not be Mean in a <HI>Sonnet</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Satire,</HI> may become so in <HI>Epick.</HI> In ge∣neral, all vulgar Terms, and all ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disagreeable Descriptions, are beneat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Heroick Stile: as all Triflings, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Affectation of Ornament, argu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> something beneath the Care of a Poet

who has taken upon him to rule the no∣bler Passions, and to sing of Heroes and of Gods.</P>
<P>When any thing has an Epithet higher, than its own Nature and the Occasion requires; or lower, than the proper Idea of the thing might very well demand; 'tis much the same; in both there w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be a Disproportion, and a Meanness. Thus,

<P>Beside this Littleness from the Nature of words, there is oftentimes a Mean∣ness annex'd in our Thoughts to such particular Words and Phrases.

But the best Expressi∣ons degenerate, when us'd by the Po∣pulace, and applied to low things: the use, they make of them, infects them with a low abject Air.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Proverbial</HI> Speeches, and all other Expressions very common among us, become unworthy of our Poetry. Foreign Proverbs are often great and emphatical to us; as many of ours may sound great to Foreigners: yet at home, both, if vulgar, will be apt to appear mean; or at least, unfit for Poetry.

I shall not presume to say, how far the <HI>Odyssey</HI> or <HI>Iliad</HI> might be blameable for any of these Meannesses in the Days of <HI>Homer</HI> himself: it is the Priviledge of every dead Language, to be entirely free from them at present. We hear not the Proverbs, nor know the current Ridicule of those Times. His Language is safe enough from the Vulgar now; And as to any Words, that might be vulgar enough then, to seem low, we are in an entire ignorance. This is a considerable Advantage which the Anci∣ents have over every Living Writer; and for which, by the way, there should be a large allowance made in any Com∣parison between an Ancient and a Mo∣dern.</P>
<P>Thus any Meanness that is <HI>acquir'd,</HI> may be <HI>lost again,</HI> or <HI>worn off</HI> by Time and Accidents. It is not so with Mean∣ness in the Things themselves.

true; and I imagine this that he asserts, may be defended as easily in the <HI>Fiction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of Poetry, as in any of the plainest Passages. But such an Enquiry wou'd take up more time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticism de∣serves; and I mention it at present only as a Measure of such Thoughts as are <HI>mean</HI> from their being <HI>false,</HI> i. e. <HI>really be∣neath what they pretend to be.</HI>—This Rule, if just, wou'd be of particular ser∣vice in this kind of Pursuits: I shall give you but one I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance; When <HI>Circe</HI> mentions <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s descent to the Infernal Shades, she adjoins this Reflection.</P>

<P>Do you not think this last Thought has something <HI>Weak</HI> and <HI>Little</HI> in it? accord∣ing to your general Rule, it fails in its <HI>Proportion;</HI> That Proportion, I mean, which every Thought should bear to <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P>If it fails in that, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> I must allow it to be Mean by my own Rule; but I do not perceive in what respect that Sentiment is false.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="333"/>
No! says <HI>Antiphaus;</HI> I beg you would consider the very Word on which the whole of the Reflection turns: It has plainly too Significations widely different. If their being <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber'd with the Dead,</HI> be taken in its strongest Sense, 'tis certain this did not happen twice to <HI>Ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses,</HI> and his Companions; if in its weaker on this Occasion, Their Calamity is put on a Level with something much more terri∣ble and calamitous than it self.</P>
<P>Or thus: If this being <HI>twice</HI> number'd with the Dead be intended both in the same Sense, the Sentence is directly false<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if in very different unequal Senses, 'tis fallacious and false in its Consequence.</P>
<P>I beg pardon for putting on this grave face, and affecting such an air of Demon∣stration: but you must know this Though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is exactly the same in the Original, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (if any thing) rather more fallacious ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than in the Translation: in such a Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all ones Gravity is scarce sufficient; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Superstitious perhaps wou'd rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disbelieve a real Demonstration, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> allow of any Fault in <HI>Homer.</HI> I beg Par∣don of them, for thus assuming th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Chair of Criticism</HI> (as the noblest of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Bacon.</HI> De <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gm.

I fear that some Points, which gene∣rally pass for Elegancies, are of this kind.—A Case, which touches all Rea∣ders of a little Taste very much, is, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Addison</HI>'s <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sc.</HI> Vol. 1. p. 239. 120.</NOTE> <HI>when two very different Ideas are join'd to the same Verb:</HI> This is very frequent in <HI>Cowley,</HI> and he has been often blamed for it; as in that Instance,

<P>I know not how it is, there is some∣thing agreeable in this management of Words, but it is very apt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njure the <HI>Sense.</HI> A thinking <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Malbranche.</HI> Search after Truth V. 2 p. 74.</NOTE> <HI>French</HI> Author lays down a Rule, which is very useful to∣wards discovering Fallacies in Reasoning; It is this: <HI>To put the Definition instead of the Thing defin'd.</HI> I have often try'd something of this nature in Poetry; If we make the Experiment in the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Case, and insert the <HI>enlarg'd Meaning</HI> in∣stead of the <HI>particular Words</HI> used by the Poet, we shall generally find a Fallacy in this sort of Verse; or, at least, a Lameness in the Sense of it.</P>
<P>It will not be any great trouble to try this in one single Point. The Poet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="159" REF="336"/>
speaking of <HI>Telemachus</HI>'s Voyage, uses this Turn of Expression:
<Q><L>To distant <HI>Pylos</HI> hapless is he gone,</L>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 14, 209—180.</NOTE> To seek his Father's fate, and find his own.</L></Q></P>
<P>This sounds very well: but what is the meaning of the word <HI>Fate,</HI> which is of such double Service upon this Occa∣sion? Try it in your own Mind:
<Q><L>To distant Pylos hapless is he gone,</L>
<L><HI>To seek</HI> (whether his Father be dead or not) <HI>and find</HI>—What?</L></Q></P>
<P>There's no need of trying it, says <HI>Philypsus;</HI> I allow it to be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficient up∣on the first hearing: But by the way, I wonder you let the <HI>Antithesis</HI> in it escape so peaceably!</P>
<P>Indeed I am no great Friend to them (reply'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> especially when they are multiplied upon us, as in this Line:
<Q><L><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 11, 740—599.</NOTE> Dust mounts <HI>in</HI> clouds, <HI>and</HI> sweat d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nds <HI>in</HI> dews.</L></Q></P>
<P>I do not fear my <HI>Philyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> should mis∣take me: it would be too s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rupulous to discard every Antithesis out of Poetry, as it seems affected to run into them very often. Some are of Force and Emphasis,
<PB N="160" REF="337"/>
and some agreeable and engaging: Possi∣bly, even <HI>the Double Use of the same Word</HI> is not absolutely to be rejected. But however these Ornaments may ob∣tain on some Occasions, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eem gene∣rally too little and artificial for the more noble Parts of Poetry. They are of the <HI>Ovidian</HI> kind, rather than of <HI>Homer:</HI> and are more apt to hit the Taste of School∣boys, than of Men.</P>
<P>And now I have mention'd <HI>Ovid</HI>'s man∣ner, give me leave to say that (in spite of his several Beauties, and that peculiar Ease and Address with which he tells a Story) I fear his Writings are one great Reason of the trifling Manner keeping its gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und so much in the present Age. <HI>Ovid</HI> is generally made use of to initiate our Youths in <HI>Parnassus:</HI> We look upon him as soon as ever we open our Eyes to Poetry: He is then, 'tis true, fit for our Taste; but the misfortune is, he is too Agreeable: 'tis odds but this fond∣ness grows up with us; and a false taste of Wit, drawn from him, may in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uence our Writings many Years after we have flung him from our Bosom. The <HI>Boyisms</HI> of <HI>Ovid,</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Garth</HI> calls 'em) are agreeable enough to infect us to old Age. Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> for Instance, was thus infected by 'em. <HI>Ovid,</HI> and
<PB N="161" REF="338"/>
<HI>Cowley</HI> our <HI>English Ovid,</HI> were his favour∣ites at <HI>Ten</HI> Years old, and his Corrupters at <HI>Seventy.</HI></P>
<P>As great Genius's, and more correct Writers, than Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> may be touch'd with the same Infection; I will give you an Instance or two of this, with which a Person may be pleas'd, even while he condemns 'em.</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 19, 245—209.</NOTE> She to her present Lord laments him lost,</L>

<P>Any one, the least acquainted with the Manner of the Poets, will readily per∣ceive this to be of the <HI>Ovidian</HI> kind. It is pretty, and agreeable as <HI>Ovid:</HI> but to be so, it loses something from the Air of <HI>Homer;</HI> it sinks beneath that Simplicity and Nature, which is the distinguishing Character of his Writings.</P>
<P>Now you mention Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> and this sort of pretty Writing together, give me leave (says <HI>Philypsus)</HI> to commend one sort of <HI>Turns,</HI> which that Critick <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dryden</HI>'s Pref. to <HI>Juvenal,</HI> p. 84. 80.</NOTE>

<P>As for the first (says <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> I be∣lieve one might venture to say, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be rejected universally: I am s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little vers'd in these Particulars, that cannot readily say any thing as to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> second: the other (whether justly or no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> takes one very much.

very particularly on the Mind; and it is this which helps to touch us in those Lines of Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> which strike every one who reads them:</P>
<LG>
<L>The listning Soldier <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt in sorrow stands,</L>

</LG>
<P>If you ask my opinion in this Point, rude and unsettled as it is; I should think, that no <HI>Turns</HI> should obtain in an <HI>Epick,</HI> or any solemn Poem, except such as have more Strength, than Beauty: That in lesser Pieces, those may be al∣low'd which have more Beauty, than Strength: but that they can be justified in no Piece whatever; unless they have some share of Strength, as well as Beauty.</P>
<P>The great Art of them is to appear Unartful; as in these pretty Lines from Mr. <HI>Philips</HI>'s Pastorals;</P>
<LG>
<L>Fair is my Flock, nor yet uncomely I</L>
<L>If liquid Fountains flatter not; and why</L>
<L>Should liquid Fountains flatter us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet shew</L>
<L>The bordering flowers less beauteous than they grow?</L>
</LG>
<P>As I take it; The Beauty of this Passage is in a greater degree, than its
<PB N="164" REF="341"/>
Strength; and the natural Air of the Sentiments, is more exquisite than ei∣ther: The Turn of the Lines makes them observ'd by every Reader more than they would otherwise be; and yet that very Turn does not seem to be de∣sign'd, but rather to be the natural re∣sult of the Shepherd's Thoughts as he speaks them.</P>
<P>If I have said too much, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> you must blame your self for it, who led me from my chief Design. I was just en∣tering on the several Natural P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eces in the Poem before us.</P>
<P>Some fanciful Writers afford us no∣thing but Pictures and Descriptions: they continue Image after Image; and put one in Mind of those <HI>Americans,</HI> who, when first they were discover'd, are said to have us'd Painting instead of Writing.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI>'s Judgment will not allow him, in any of his Works, to be thus Perpe∣tual in his Descriptions; and the design of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> will not allow near the variety, which he has very justly employ'd in the <HI>Iliad.</HI> The <HI>Odyssey</HI> is a Poetical Treatise of Morality: it does not ad∣mit of a profusion of Colours: this is not to be look'd upon as a Defect: we might with the same Reason blame a
<PB N="165" REF="342"/>
Book of Maxims, or <HI>Plato</HI>'s Moral Dia∣logues, for not having all the Flourishes and Charms of Rhetorick.</P>
<P>And as the Plan of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> in ge∣neral excludes that great variety of De∣scription, which abounds in some Poems; the chief Scene, in the remaining Part of it, is so wholly Domestick, that it scarce allows room for any thing of that Nature. The Action now is confin'd; it lies all between either the Country-House of <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> and the Palace; or this latter, and the Gardens of <HI>Laertes.</HI> What a narrow Scene is this for Description? and yet these are the only <HI>places</HI> capable of any, if you except a two days Journey, and a short Voyage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the 15<HI>th,</HI> neither of which could be enlarg'd upon without injuring the main Design. <HI>Homer</HI> was unacquainted with the modern Affluence of Painting, where∣ever there may be any fine Object in the way: As these Opportunities offer only in an Episode, he passes them with the utmost dispatch: we see his haste in the very Lines, and indeed in every one of them distinctly:</P>

<P>Borrow'd Images appear with a par∣ticular Propriety and Grace, when they have some near Relation to the Scene, on which the Poem turns at the very Instant of applying 'em. Thus in the <HI>Battle of Rivers,</HI> in the <HI>(b) Iliad,</HI> every Similie is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quatick, and adapted to the Place.

<P>There may also be some propriety <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om any previous Relation between the

<HI>Person,</HI> and the <HI>Thing</HI> to which he is com∣par'd.

<P>I remember, I us'd formerly to be mightily taken with a Similie in the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">—Cui saepe suis in montibus hirc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prolixam invidit barbam—De <HI>Cambro-Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Thus <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Abietibus juvenes patriis &amp; montibus aequos.</NOTE> <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scipula;</HI> and I believe now, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this very Account. Ideas, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been alreaded join'd on any other Occasion, will agree the more easily on a new one.</P>
<P>The Picture is less broken also, when the borrow'd Image is adapted to the present Circumstances: Where <HI>Penelop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is represented as chast and beautiful, 'tis said she look'd <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 17, 47—37.</NOTE> like <HI>Diana</HI> with all the Charms of <HI>Venus;</HI> when her Beauty is the chief Circumstance to be

insisted on, she is compar'd to <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 18, 229—192.</NOTE> <HI>Venus,</HI> without any mention of <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>We may observe, by the way, that the Heathen Poets, in comparing a Per∣son to any of their Deities, had a sure Method of giving their Readers a Picture of that Person. The Statues of their Deities were known by every one; and the Faces of each as well ascertain'd, as the Faces of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors (for instance) can be, by frequently conversing with their Medals; This I take to be one Reason, why this sort of Compari∣son is so very frequent in the Ancients: The Case is very different in any mo∣dern Composition; tho' we seem to be equally fond of the same Comparisons.</P>
<P>If it does not add to the Strength, at least it makes the Piece more agreeable, when these Images are unusual. Thus <HI>Ulysses</HI> in his Bed of Leaves, to a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 5, 630—488.</NOTE> Coal of Fire preserv'd in the Embers; and be∣fore in his raft at Sea, to an <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid</HI> 417.</NOTE> heap of Thorns, driven by the Wind.</P>
<P>There may be a <HI>Prettiness,</HI> as well as a <HI>Likeness</HI> in these Images; I always us'd to be pleas'd with that Passage, where <HI>Penelope</HI> is compar'd to a <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 19, 605—518.</NOTE> Nightingale;
<PB N="174" REF="351"/>
tho' I am more pleas'd with the same Image in <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Georg.</HI> 4, 511.</NOTE> <HI>Virgil;</HI> which, beside its agreeableness, is perhaps the most com∣pleat Instance, that can be given, of such Similitudes as hit exactly in every Point. <HI>Virgil</HI> certainly excells <HI>Homer</HI> in these, as we may say that <HI>Homer</HI> excells him in the <HI>Vague Similitude;</HI> for both have their distinct Beauties.</P>
<P>'Tis the proper air of Poetry to be unconfin'd and free: The Muse loves a flowing Dress: Her motions are ever Easy, and her very ornaments must be Natural. Such is the Muse of <HI>Homer.</HI> And hence the Poet, in this sort of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pictures, does not in the least Scruple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to take in several Circumstances, that do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not affect the main Resemblance. When<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Painter is copying a Piece, he must preserve the Likeness; but he may var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Drapery, the Posture, the Under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> figures, and the Scene around 'em.</P>
<P>Thus in <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Philomel,</HI> the main Likeness is very well taken: When the Poet has secur'd this, he touches upon the History of <HI>Itylus;</HI> and launches out into Particulars, which are <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> τ', 523. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> so far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from squaring with the Case of <HI>Penelope,</HI> that they have no manner of Relation to it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="352"/>
<HI>Homer</HI> is almost singular in another sort of Similie, the Reverse of the for∣mer: when the Principal Figures have in themselves no Likeness, but agree in some one Circumstance of Action. These are very frequent in the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey:</HI> and I cannot say, whether it be from a true Judgment, or a scrupulous Nice∣ness, that later Writers endeavour to imitate them but very rarely.</P>
<P>Perhaps this is blameable; and so may be that stringing of several Similies together, which we sometimes meet with in <HI>Homer.</HI> I do not mean when several things are chosen to illustrate the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Ιλ. ξ, 394.</NOTE> <HI>same Point</HI> more fully: but when Similies on <HI>different</HI> things follow too close on the Neck of one another. In the 2<HI>d Iliad,</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, 453 to 483.</NOTE> we have one of these strings which takes up thirty Lines; And tho' they are all excellently well chosen, and have one common Point of Union between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they may seem something faulty, as they are too numerous for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lace in which they stand, and too much crouded on one another.</P>
<P>Now I have digress'd so far on two or three Vices in ancient Similies; I shall just mention one or two of a later
<PB N="176" REF="353"/>
Date. Such is the <HI>continued</HI> Similie, which is very liable to the great Fault of mixt Metaphors, when a Writer, to lengthen a <HI>comparison,</HI> carries it beyond the <HI>Likeness.</HI> I remember one of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s in a <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Before his Translation of the <HI>Georgicks.</HI></NOTE> Dedication, that begins very well. <Q>The Greatness of Birth shews a Nobleman with advantage; but if he degenerates, <HI>the least Spot is visible on Ermine.</HI></Q>—This does not seem to be continued so happily, as it is begun. <Q>To preserve this Whiteness in its Original Purity, You (my Lord) have, <HI>like that Ermine, forsaken that common tract of Business, which is not always clean.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Art of extracting Similies out of a thing directly contrary to your purpose, is I think wholly Modern. Every one knows an Instance of this in that famous Doctor, who to illustrate the <HI>Danger</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> compares it to one of the <HI>Prophets, who was encompass'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e∣men and Chariots of Fire</HI>—for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣fence.</P>
<P>Nothing is so opposite to the Design of this Beauty in Poetry, as to labour after a vast Number of Likenesses in any the minutest Points; and to multiply
<PB N="177" REF="354"/>
them, rather to shew how far the Poets Wit can carry the Resemblance, than to strengthen the Image of the things de∣scrib'd. This descends even to playing upon Words; nay sometime to particularize several Points in which they are <HI>unlike,</HI> as well as those in which they <HI>agree.</HI> This is the <HI>Cowlean</HI> Similitude: and I could produce <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See a <HI>Pindarick Ode</HI> on <HI>Cowley,</HI> in <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Misc.</HI> (Vol. 4) particularly the whole third <HI>Stanza.</HI></NOTE> monstrous Instances of it from a very fine Writer, where he endeavours only to imitate <HI>Cowley</HI> at a Distance. 'Tis the same Person who has introduced Similies into his <HI>Prose,</HI> in a manner unknown to the Ancients: but he who would blame any of his Wri∣tings of <HI>this kind,</HI> must blame them, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> does Eloquence, with the Ten∣derness of a Lover.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to judge of any Si∣milie, Ancient or Modern. Their <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ad inferendam rebus lucem <HI>repertae sunt</HI> Simi∣litudines.—Praecipuè custodiendum, ne id quod Similitudinis gratiâ adscivimus, aut obscurum sit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut igno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um. <HI>Quintil.

either more distinct, larger Notions of the thing, or at least of some Circum∣stance of the thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be describ'd.</P>
<P>I long to add several things on this Head; but I have wander'd too far al∣ready from our chief Design: it is time now to consider a higher Class of De∣scriptions and Images (which we touch'd upon when we were talking over the former Books of the <HI>Odyssey)</HI> that Poeti∣cal power of expressing the <HI>Passions,</HI> and even <HI>Ideas</HI> yet in the Minds of Men.</P>
<P>I am not angry with You, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> for preventing much of what might have been offer'd here, when you were consi∣dering the Starts and Turns, which our Passions occasion in the various manners of Speaking. I know not how such a Notion would appear to the World; but you have thoroughly perswaded me, that all the Figures of Speech, of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Figures either belong to the <HI>Diction,</HI> or the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntiment:</HI> the latter is what is here intended.</NOTE> Nobler Order, are view'd in a truer Light, when we look upon them, as na∣turally Expressive of what we feel within us; than when we consider them, only as the Arts and Machineries of Writing.</P>
<P>It was on this Occasion you went thorough the most passionate Scenes in
<PB N="179" REF="356"/>
the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> for such are the several Enterviews in which <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes him∣self known to his <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book, 21.</NOTE> Friends, his <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">B. 16.</NOTE> Son, his <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">B. 24.</NOTE> Father, and his <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">B. 23.</NOTE> Consort. <HI>Pe∣nelope</HI>'s <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 23, 215.</NOTE> Speech at that juncture is ex∣cellent; and indeed all her Speeches in general are of the <HI>Pathetick</HI> kind, and (under this view) afford us the most beau∣tiful Passages in the whole Poem.</P>
<P>To the many things that have been said on the <HI>Double Passions</HI> (as you were pleas'd to let me call them) give me leave to add one particular Case more: what I mean, is <HI>Dissimulation.</HI> We have fre∣quent Descriptions of this in the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> Every Instance of it (if passionate at all) will fall under this Consideration; and that in the highest Degree, as the Passion <HI>assum'd,</HI> and the <HI>real,</HI> are direct Oppo∣sites. Every one, who only pretends to <HI>Courage,</HI> is certainly affected with <HI>Fear;</HI> and when we put on a false Gayety, the <HI>Heart</HI> is as dull and oppress'd, as the <HI>Countenance</HI> is enliven'd.</P>
<P>Could we look into the Breast of one who affects a Liveliness, when his Thoughts are really Gloomy; we should see his Spirits in such contrary Emotions,
<PB N="180" REF="357"/>
as are describ'd in the Suitors, under those unaccountable mixt fits of Mirth and Heaviness.—</P>

<L>Then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow.</L>
</LG>
<P>Such is that <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Od.</HI> 18, 194—162.</NOTE> <HI>Smile of Penelope,</HI> which has something very uneasy in it: She seems all the while to struggle with her Tears. 'Tis like a transient Gleam of Light, when the Heavens are over∣cast: all around is Gloomy; and the Light itself is Dim and Waterish.</P>
<P>This perhaps is an Instance not of the affected, but the natural Kind. 'Tis true, one Passion sometimes usurps the Effect of another: Without tumbling over <HI>Des-Cartes</HI> for a Solution of the matter, we know, that an Excess of <HI>Joy</HI> often breaks out into <HI>Tears;</HI> and that <HI>Rage</HI> may vent itself in a <HI>Smile:</HI> These indeed are contrary Appearances; but 'tis very different in all Points of Dissi∣mulation. The Mixture then has some∣thing peculiar in it. Contrary to the natural Blending of such Emotions, this
<PB N="181" REF="358"/>
has always an Air forc'd and artificial. The Soul was not made to be a Coun∣terfeit: every time we wou'd teach her these new Arts, we fling her off her Biass, and give her an unnatural Motion. There will ever be something aukward in the Passions of the most profound Dis∣semblers.</P>
<P>Only view <HI>Ulysses,</HI> when he is struck to the Soul with the Affection and Tears of his <HI>Penelope,</HI> and at the same time re∣solv'd to conceal those his Emotions from her, as much as possible:</P>
<LG>

<P>Even <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> who is so <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Note, <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> Celebrated among the Ancients for his Command over his Passions, does not ap∣pear without something forc'd and un∣natural in his Looks, amidst all his Dissi∣mulation. He can command his Tears; he can command his Tongue; but still his very Features would betray him.</P>
<P>I know not what to say to one thing: That <HI>Homer</HI> makes Dissimulation one of
<PB N="182" REF="359"/>
the greatest Excellencies of his Hero. The Heathen system of Morality was incompleat enough to bear with this pro∣ceeding: and even Christians of the greatest Name have border'd much on the same Notions. One of our Ancient Writers, who was as capable as any of them to do it, has <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Chrysostom.</HI> Tom. 6. pag. 5. Ed. <HI>Savil.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp;c.</NOTE> launch'd out into a long defence of <HI>useful Frauds;</HI> and <HI>Fa∣ther Paul,</HI> to mention one not inferior among the Moderns, reckons Dissimu∣lation <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Where the Historian says that <HI>Pope</HI> died <Q>Con allegrezza non mediocre della cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a quale ben ammirava le <HI>vertu</HI> di quello, che erano una gravita naturale, et essemplare parsi∣monia, &amp; <HI>dissimulation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> odiava pero maggio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mente l' avaria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia, durezza, &amp; crudelta.</Q> <HI>Hist.</HI> del <HI>Concilio Trid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> p. 68.</NOTE> expressly among the <HI>Vertues</HI> of <HI>Pope Clement</HI> the <HI>Seventh.</HI> I do not men∣tion this as any Argument for the thing; but to extenuate the Proceeding of <HI>Ho∣mer:</HI> 'Tis no wonder that he should mistake a counterfeit Virtue in the Dark, which such great Men could not distin∣guish in the Light.</P>
<P>But whatever Colour Dissimulation may bear in the Schemes of Morality, it is certainly a great Excellence to paint
<PB N="183" REF="360"/>
Dissimulation well in Poetry. The pre∣tended Passion must appear most strongly, and yet the real Passion must appear under it. It must be like the Drapery in Pictures, which shews the turn of the Limbs, at the same time that it hides them; and in particular, puts one in Mind of that Veil in <HI>Homer, which seems and only seems</HI> to shade the Face of <HI>Penelope.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing more difficult in Poetry, than to express justly Ideas in the Minds of Persons whom we describe. But tho' this be the least obvious, 'tis perhaps the most agreeable of all Studies. The Poet must search carefully into the Nature of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the Working of his Thoughts in general; He must know what Emotions are natural on each Accident of Life; and on every single Occasion is to consider, not only the Cir∣cumstances of Actions, but also the Tem∣per, the Education, and the very <HI>make</HI> of the Person concern'd in them.

Account; while <HI>Polypheme,</HI> on the con∣trary, must speak of nothing but the Advantage of a vast Size and superior Strength.</P>
<P>A Man's Notions of Excellence are form'd generally from some advanc'd Powers of his own. Each Man is apt to make himself the Measure of all the Species; and his Species the Standard of all Perfection. All Beings above him must be exactly like the superior Moyety of his own Being, and all below him must be purely of the Inferior. The Vulgar of Mankind form their Heaven hereafter out of those things which have pleas'd them most in Life; and the very Notions of the Deity in most Men take a Turn from their own Complexions. The God of proud <HI>tyrannical</HI> Minds is a Being, that delights only in the <HI>Glory of being Terrible;</HI> as with the soft and piti∣ful, The Deity is <HI>all Mercy:</HI> the Gods of <HI>Epicurus</HI> were mere pleasurable In∣telligences; and the Deities of the <HI>Irro∣quois</HI> are <HI>Mighty Hunters.</HI> Commend me to that Philosopher who said, that <HI>were his Horse to give us his Notion in this Case; A Broad Chest and a Flowing Mane would certainly be the Principal things in it.</HI></P>
<P>One cannot easily apprehend how ge∣neral an effect this has in the Actings of

our Minds. I know not that it is yet designedly manag'd in any System of Philosophy, (for Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s <HI>Association</HI> of <HI>Ideas</HI> seems to be something very distinct from it) and as it wants a Name, give me leave to call it for the present, The <HI>Assimilation of Ideas.</HI></P>
<P>If you would save me from a Fit of Philosophizing, be so good as to reach that Volume of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> just by you, That I may read you a Passage which took with me particularly, on this Ac∣count. 'Tis where <HI>Ulysses</HI> has acquainted the <HI>Cyclops</HI> with his real Name and Cha∣racter: this is part of the Monster's Answer;</P>

<P>There's a Passage which, I remember, I was mightily pleas'd with formerly, in reading <HI>Cervantes,</HI> without seeing any Reason for it at that Time; tho' I now imagine, that which took me in it comes under this View. Speaking of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> the first time that Adventurer came in sight of the Ocean, he expresses his Sentiments on this Occasion in the following manner, <HI>He saw the Sea, which he had never seen before; and thought it much bigger than the River at</HI> Salamanca.</P>
<P>This Turn of Thought is not so com∣monly observ'd perhaps as it might easily be in Life. There are other occasional <HI>Traces</HI> in the Mind, which are known and obvious: Things that are common in some Degree to all Men; and such are all those Apprehensions which follow from any <HI>Master-Passion.</HI> One might expa∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate here very Agreeably on each of them; but I am ever apt to be too Tedious; and will therefore confine my self to one single Passion, that of <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="364"/>
We may see in the Descriptions of the Poets, how this Passion acts on the Soul through all its different Degrees, from a <HI>Wavering</HI> and <HI>Irresolution</HI> of Mind, to the Excess of <HI>Confusion</HI> and <HI>Despair.</HI></P>
<P>When a Coward (as most Cowards are Vain-glorious) undertakes any En∣terprize of Difficulty, the Moment he is engag'd in it, his Mind turns all upon the Danger of the Undertaking. He immediately wishes himself fairly out of it; His Body begins to tremble, and his Thoughts are all confus'd and irresolute. Thus it is with <HI>Dolon.</HI> That Wretch engages under the Covert of the Night, to steal to the Camp of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and discover their Motions. Before he is got half way, The first tread of Men that he hears, <HI>He hoped in his Mind</HI> (says <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ιλ. χ', 355.</NOTE> <HI>Homer) that 'twas a Messenger from</HI> Hector <HI>to recall him.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Book, where we have this Image, is nothing but one Picture of Fear in different Postures; The appre∣hensions of distant Danger are very na∣turally express'd in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Guard;</P>

<P>Fear has another strange Property of <HI>Magnifying</HI> our Ideas of the Danger. When we are possess'd with it, we are apt, like <HI>Sosia</HI> in the Play, to take every Shadow for a Man, and every Man for a Giant. If the Danger be present, we think it greater than it is; and to its real Terrors, add a Thousand that are only imaginary. Thus the Suitors view

<P>If I mistake not, there's a certain great Writer who calls Fear, <HI>A natural Ine∣briation of the Mind:</HI> it shews every thing Double: I know not what the <HI>Mytholo∣gists</HI> may teach; But this, in my Opi∣nion, might account for the Multiplicity of <HI>Cerberus</HI>'s Heads, and all the Hands of <HI>Briareus.</HI></P>

<P>All these are Points which lie in com∣mon between Painting and Poetry; I wou'd willingly touch upon one thing more under the same View: I mean, those pieces in Poetry which answer Copying in Painting; and each of which is really <HI>the Picture of a Picture.</HI></P>
<P>You will give me leave by <HI>Picture</HI> here to understand any Artificial Images
<PB N="191" REF="368"/>
of things; from Embroidery, Embossing, or any other Method of expressing Na∣ture by Likenesses of Art: And indeed 'tis of this kind, that all the Pictures spoken of in <HI>Homer</HI> are; and, I believe, all in <HI>Virgil.</HI> At least, what we call Painting now, was not the Painting of the <HI>Homerick</HI> Ages.</P>
<P>It is to the Honour of the Art (in this general Sense) that the Poets, when they are copying from Painting, gene∣rally exceed themselves. I believe there is not a more masterly Piece in all <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>'s Works, than his Copy of <HI>Troilus;</HI> Thus the same Hand in the Images of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s <HI>Shield:</HI> As in that of <HI>Achilles, Homer</HI> has all the Life and Expression that Poetry is capable of.</P>
<P>In both of these, the Poets use a way of speaking in relation to Picture, which is very Strong and Emphatical; and which may shew the high Notions they entertain'd of this Art: They do not say, that the Images <HI>seem</HI> to perform such Actions; but talk of 'em as <HI>real Life:</HI> They say directly, that they Move, and Act, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Speak. The Criticks, who have blam'd some Boldnesses of this kind, shew only their own <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>pope</HI> and <HI>Dacier</HI> on the Shield of <HI>Achilles. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> Book 18.</NOTE> Coldness, and

want of Taste. 'Tis a Figure as just as it is daring: it animates the Description; and where the Poet is <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thus where <HI>Europa</HI> is said<LG>

<P>I should think (tho' the Notes do not mention any thing of it) that the Translator

<P>It is scarce to be imagin'd, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> how great the Powers of Sounds are, when adapted to the Subject and the Passion. For my part, I should think that our very <HI>Bodies</HI> are dispos'd to re∣ceive them; that this Frame of ours is like an Instrument ready tun'd; and when the proper Key is touch'd, our Nerves tremble and answer it with a
<PB N="204" REF="381"/>
Kind of Musical Sympathy. How far this may reach in others, I know not; but as for my particular Make, 'tis strangely susceptible of such Impressions. After a Period set to Melancholy, I have been surpriz'd to find my Eyes full of Tears: There are some exquisite Lines which I can never read without a cer∣tain <HI>Shivering</HI> thorough my Blood, that I cannot express to you: I have felt my Spirits Burn within me, upon hearing a Point of War, well wrote; and have been almost ready to start from my Seat at the Poetical Sound of a Trumpet.</P>
<P>This Energy of Sounds, and the great and various Emotions they are capable of raising in our Breasts, may serve part∣ly to excuse those Criticks, who are very particular in laying down Rules, as to this part of Versification; The An∣cients, as well as Moderns, have left us whole Treatises upon it: and those who have wrote in a more general way, are very diffusive, when they come to this Part of their Subject. They speak to every the least Circumstance; and Rea∣ders, who have never thought over this Point, would be surpriz'd to find the great <HI>Cicero</HI> very industriously <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettling Quantities,</HI> and <HI>measuring Words</HI> fit for such and such a Period. They would
<PB N="205" REF="382"/>
wonder, whence he is so peremptory for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ambicks</HI> on this Occasion; and on ano∣ther, so great a Partizan for <HI>Tribrachs,</HI> and <HI>Dactils.</HI></P>
<P>Why, seriously, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> I have often thought him quite tedious on these particulars: The Orator, even the Cri∣tick, seem'd to be lost sometimes, and nothing but a mere Pedant appear in their room. I admire the force of Num∣bers (continu'd he) as much as any one; but when I have been reading the Rules at large in the Criticks, I could not help thinking them too minute and trifling. If a Man must be taken up thus in weighing Syllables and ranging of Vowels, what Elegance of Language can we ex∣pect, or what Life in his Composi∣tions?</P>
<P>What you say (answer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> is what, I believe, most Men think on this Occasion: and were a Poet always to be studying his Rules, such an Objecti∣on would be very powerful: But it is with this, which is only the Mechanism of Verse, as it is in the Mechanism of Writing. We must learn to draw the Figure of the Letters, and study how to form the particular Turn of each<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be∣fore a Man can write down a wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Sentence; By use this knowledge gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws

Sect. 9, and 10.</NOTE> sort of Instinct; and our Pen runs over each Letter, without our considering, di∣stinctly at each which way we shall di∣rect it. 'Tis much the same in these Arts of Versification. When we have learn't the force of Letters, and the Powers of Sound; when we know what Syllables are proper to express such a Motion, and what run of Verse hits such particular Images, Use makes the Mind ready in applying what is proper; and the Thought is as nimble in suggest∣ing Words of a suitable Sound, as the Hand is in Motions proper to set down those words on our Paper.</P>
<P>But it will be hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a life, perhaps, be∣fore the Poet can come to this Readine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s—I do not say it is to be acquir'd immediately, answer'd <HI>Antiphaus,</HI> but acquir'd in some Measure it must be, by any one who desires to be a true Poet: In the mean time, a Man may indulge his Vigour, he may compose his Lines with full Spirit, and set them to Musick afterwards; Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Man write with Flame, if he will but correct at Leisure.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="384"/>
Besides: this is not so difficult to be attain'd, as one wou'd imagine. The fitness of Sounds to things is natural: <HI>Invention</HI> itself will go some way in the Work; and where there is naturally (What we call) a <HI>Good Ear,</HI> Nature will do the Business almost without the help of Art. I do not speak this in a decla∣matory way, Good <HI>Philyps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;</HI> I imagine Fact and Experience will go a great way in proving what I say. A Man, who thinks vehemently, will speak swiftly; and when we are on a grave Point, our Words will of themselves be in a great Measure slow and weighty. This is yet plainer from the <HI>Invention</HI> of Lan∣guages; How many single Words are there in every Tongue, that have been originally cast in a proper Mould, and on the first Heat carried off the Images of things impress'd upon them? I was say∣ing too, that the posture of the Mind at the time of Composing, will assist the turn of the Composition; And is this more absurd in particular Cases, than that the Temper of a People in general should affect their Language in the same manner? Yet has it been often observ'd that the Dispositions of a People are per∣ceivable in that Turn of Words they chiefly delight in. Thus the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="385"/>
Tongue is brisk and voluble: The <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> talk in vast Syllables and perpetual Consonants: <HI>English</HI> is neither too soft, nor too rough: tho' our <HI>Northerly</HI> Situa∣tion inclines us rather to the latter: And, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> is the most haughty of all Nations, their Language is the most Grand; it prides itself in firm Syl∣lables, in a frequency of the fullest Vowel, and the most sonorous Termina∣tions of its Words.</P>
<P>Nature certainly forms us within for fit Sounds: We see every Day that even Brutes can express their Passions by the <HI>Tone</HI> of their Voice; and is not an In∣telligent Being as well qualified by Na∣ture to adapt Sounds to his Senti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?</P>
<P>Indeed they are thus adapted already in a Multitude of Instances; Our Lan∣guage abounds with such words; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n many Cases we need only utter our Sentiments in the most common Expressi∣ons, to speak with this Significance. What was it that led the first Inventors into this frequency of such words? Was in Art, or the Natural Resemblance, and their Obviousness upon that Ac∣count? 'Tis in this Light we must un∣derstand our Master Critick, where he
<PB N="209" REF="386"/>
calls Nature <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hal. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <Q>The great Original and Mistress of propriety in the pre∣sent Point: It is she that leads us to imitate things by Sound; and to ex∣press what we conceive, by Words that are turn'd according to those strong Likenesses, which we form in our Minds.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis plain the Use of Words is arbi∣trary: we might if we had a fancy for it, call any thing by any Name: Yet there is something from within, that has influenc'd all Nations so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, as to lead them to descriptive Sounds, in their giving Names to things; and that more fre∣quently than one would readily imagine. What Nature has done in single Words the Poet carries on in Composition; Al∣most all the particular Names of Sounds themselves, for instance, are naturally sig∣nificant in most Languages; as with us, the <HI>Roaring</HI> of Waves, the <HI>Whistling</HI> of Winds &amp;c. Of such Words, assisted by a proper structure of Quantities, and a sig∣nificant Cadence of Verse, the Poet makes an Hurricane by Land, or a Storm at Sea. Nature first presided in establish∣ing those proper sounds, and still directs in the Assemblage of them.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="387"/>
Hence it is that this Point takes such a Compass in the Doctrine of the Criticks. Some of them, no doubt, carry the Mat∣ter too far, when they would require this Natural Significance of Sounds, to be kept up in every thing we write. Such was <HI>Vossius.</HI> It would make you smile to hear some of his Fancies: He talks as if every Language, like that of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Favourites the <HI>Chinese,</HI> should be no∣thing but Musick: He would have our very Actions all Tuned: A Soldier can't run the Gauntlet, but he must be <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Ancients (says he) us'd Musick in eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y thing; <HI>Adeo quod ipsae quoque plagae ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> harm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s sontibus i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gerebantur.</HI> De Viribus Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hmi. p. 47.</NOTE> slash'd <HI>in Time;</HI> and his very <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Non semel recordor me in ejusmodi incidisse manus, qui quorumvis etiam <HI>can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icorum mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> suis imitarentu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>pectinibus;</HI> it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ut nonnunquam Iambos v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Trochaeos, alias Dactylos vel Anapaestos, nonn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nquam Amphi∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aches aut Paeonas quàm sci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issimè exprimerent und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>haud m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tur del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctatio.</HI> ib. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Barber must Shave him in a just proportion of <HI>Dactils</HI> and <HI>Spondees.</HI></P>

<P>I have heard it frequently objected to those Gentlemen, the Criticks, that they find out several Beauties of this Kind in the Works of <HI>Homer,</HI> which he, never so much as dream't of in compo∣sing 'em. In many Cases this may be true; and in many the Lines may be justly commended, and really significant, tho' that particular Beauty might not be design'd in composing them: But those, who can perswade themselves, that <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> never design'd any such thing in his Writings, I should think, might soon bring themselves to believe (what has been so frequently produc'd as an instance of Absurdity) that his Poems might be made by chance.</P>
<P>The Notes of Musick in a good Com∣position are fitted to the Subject: And a good Copy of Verses wrote for Musick will be fitted for Notes. I cannot once doubt, that the first Stanza in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Ode for St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day has a <HI>design'd</HI> Harmony all thorough it. 'Tis just the same Case with <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems:
<PB N="212" REF="389"/>
They were all made for Musick; and have been all sang to the Lyre.</P>
<P>As for my part, says <HI>Philypsus,</HI> I find Musick enough in them, even now, with∣out the Lyrist. Neither have I any quar∣rel with the Criticks for giving meplea∣sure, and pointing out Beauties of this kind, whether design'd by <HI>Homer</HI> or not. But I wonder at one thing: while they speak of the Defect in this point perpe∣tually, I never yet heard them speak of any Excess in it: 'Tis certain, that the greater Number of Poets err in neglect∣ing the significant Turn of their Verses: but is there no erring too by an Affecta∣tion of it?</P>
<P>I thank you, (answer'd <HI>Antiphaus)</HI> for putting me in mind of this particular. Undoubtedly there may be faults on both sides: Even in the Poem before us I ima∣gine, this is sometimes carried too far, and sometimes us'd improperly: The In∣firmness of a Couplet, mention'd on ano∣ther Occasion, agrees with the thing describ'd, and may perhaps be blameable on that very Account.</P>

<P>This last Verse in particular may be an Instance of employing descriptive Sounds too thick upon one another; but this, if it be a fault, is such an one as in the present state of Poetry, requires an unusual Eminence in the Writer, to be capable of committing it.</P>
<P>'Tis much more frequent among our Poets to neglect the Sentiments in their Versification; to give up the significant
<PB N="215" REF="392"/>
Structure of Words, for mere harmony and softness of Verse; and even to make u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Numbers contrary to the Image or Passion they are describing; tho' to describe Actions of Rapidity, for instance, in slow solemn Measures, is as absurd, as for an Actor to scold, or rant, with the tone and steadiness of a Philosopher.</P>
<P>We have not time, <HI>Philypsus,</HI> other∣wise I should have ventur'd on some far∣ther Faults of our Versification: but I must not now run out into Complaints on the frequent <HI>Consonants</HI> and frequent <HI>Elisions,</HI> multiplied so much in our Verses, tho' both ought to be particularly guard∣ed against, in a Language naturally overladen with them:—On the neglect of <HI>Measure,</HI> and taking all Sylla∣bles whether long or short to be of Equal Time: and the Lameness and Inequality from hence in Verses of the same kind:—The discord of the <HI>Emphasis</HI> or Ac∣cent, and of the <HI>Pauses:</HI>—the repeated <HI>Cadence,</HI> and continued <HI>Likeness</HI> of Sound. I need only mention some other Identi∣ties of Sound, as all middle and double Rhimes, and all that are alike for two Couplets together. And methinks, <HI>Phi∣lypsus,</HI> as all these likenesses of Sound would be given up at the first word, unless there be some particular Reason

for retaining that fashionable jingle at the close of our Verses, we may even reckon that as bad as the rest. I should have said something on this: but 'tis no great matter; since it stands condemn'd over and over by the greatest Criticks among the Modern. For my part, I'le talk no more of it, that we may go in Humour to our Claret.—I begin to wish my self in your Parlour. The Evening shuts in apace. Come, good <HI>Philypsus,</HI> let us be going, I beseech You.</P>
