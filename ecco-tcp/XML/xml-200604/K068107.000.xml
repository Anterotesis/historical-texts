<P>WHereas Her Majesty has been Graci∣ously Pleas'd, on all Occasions, to ex∣press Her truly Royal and Religious Concern, for promoting the Welfare of Her Subjects; and particularly for uniting them in their Com∣mon Interest against the Common Enemy. On the contrary, Our Domestick and most Dange∣rous Enemies have been Indefatigable in their Industry to obstruct these glorious Designs of Her Majesty and Her Ministers, by foment∣ing our Animosities, and perpetuating our un∣happy Divisions.</P>
<P>And whether those Weekly Papers from whence this Collection is taken, may not be reckon'd amongst these mischievous Engines that have been set at Work for some Years past, is humbly submitted to the Consideration of the Persons in Authority, as a necessary Duty and Service to he Publick.</P>

<P>YEsterday my Lord-Keeper sent out Writs for a New Parliament, and the first Election will be on <HI>Monday</HI> next at <HI>Malden</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> where two honest Loyal Gentlemen, called by the Whigs <HI>Tackers,</HI> will be chosen: The rest of the Elections will come on very quick, and be soon over.</P>

Reception there of <HI>John Snell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the <HI>Representatives</HI> in the late <HI>Parliament,</HI> an honest, loyal, and brave <HI>Tacker,</HI> who arrived from <HI>London</HI> on the 1st instant, having been met some Miles out of Town by above 500 Horse, and some 1000 Foot, com∣pos'd of the Neighbouring <HI>Gentry,</HI> with the <HI>Clergy, Aldermen,</HI> and principal <HI>Citizens</HI>; who conducted him to his own House, with the City Musick playing be∣fore him, the Streets ecchoing with these Acclamati∣ons; <HI>God bless the Loyal Tackers, and send the Snea∣kers more Honesty and Courage.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Dartmouth</HI> they have that Veneration for the Ser∣vice of their worthy <HI>Representatives, Fred. and Nat. Hern,</HI> Esquires, that they have <HI>Christen'd</HI> a <HI>Ship</HI> by the Name of <HI>Tacker.</HI></P>
<P>We hear that 17 <HI>Strangers</HI> are like to be chosen in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> not one of them having a Foot of Land in that County, to the Reproach of the <HI>Electors,</HI> for not ha∣ving a greater Value for the honest, loyal, neighbou∣ring <HI>Gentry.</HI></P>

<P>SInce my Last we have an Account of a great many Elections, some of which have gone <HI>well,</HI> but more <HI>ill.</HI> Five <HI>honest Tackers</HI> have lost it in <HI>Kent,</HI> and two at <HI>Haslemere</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> and one in <HI>Westminster.</HI> On the other Hand, the Honourable <HI>Charles North,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> has carried it at <HI>Banbury</HI>; the <HI>Greviles</HI> at <HI>Warwick</HI>; and for the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> the <HI>Earl of Dysert</HI> and Sir <HI>Rob. Davers</HI>; where there has been such a Trial of the Strength of Parties, that the like has hardly been known. The Poll ended on <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night, when 'twas found that Sir <HI>Rob. Davers</HI> had 2883, the <HI>Earl of Dysert</HI> 2877, Sir <HI>Dudley Cullum</HI> 2318, Sir <HI>Sam. Ber∣nardiston</HI> 2286 Voices; so that the Election was car∣ried by a great Majority, if you consider the terrible Opposition that was made by the <HI>Low-Church men,</HI> and their Friends, the <HI>Phanaticks</HI> of all sorts, supported by the <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> of <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n,</HI> the Lords <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>llis</HI> and <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y.</HI> But this Victory is owing in a great Measure to the Dili∣gence of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> of which 80 went and polled in one Body, and as many singly, being not advertiz'd of the Design; and to pin the Basket, Sir <HI>Tho. Hanmer</HI> brought in a Body of 300 Horse, at the Sight of which the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> withdrew from the Window, and all was gi∣ven up; and though the great Cry of the <HI>Whigs</HI> was,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and is, no <HI>Tackers,</HI> yet that is known to be only the Word that is given out to the Party; the true Meaning is, <HI>No Church of England Man:</HI> For we find that they have oppos'd Sir <HI>Simon Harcourt</HI> and others (that had not the <HI>Honour</HI> to be of that Number) with the same Violence; and Sir <HI>Will. Ash<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t,</HI> in a Letter to his Friend at <HI>Warrington,</HI> tells him plainly, that it's past 12 a Clock with the Church, so that she must come down. At these Proceedings the inferiour Clergy are so alarm'd in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> that they design to appear in a Body for Sir <HI>R. Motyn</HI> and Sir <HI>G.

</DIV2>

<HEAD>May 15th.</HEAD>
<P>SInce my last a great many more Elections are made, which are too long for my Purpose to enumerate. Brigadier <HI>Cadoggan</HI> has carried it at <HI>Woodstock</HI> against Sir <HI>John Waters,</HI> a very worthy Gentleman; but Dr. <HI>Oats</HI> did not go to give his Vote as was said he would, nor did the <HI>Solicitor General,</HI> tho' he had also a Right so to do. The Lord <HI>Woodstock,</HI> Son of the <HI>Earl of Portland,</HI> has carried it at <HI>Southampton</HI> against <HI>Frid. Tilney,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a loyal and worthy Gentleman, which was done by this Trick; That Gentleman happening to pay his Reckoning in that Town with about 70 <HI>Loudores</HI> which he had received there, the <HI>Whig</HI> Party immediately gave out, he was a <HI>French Pensio∣ner,</HI> which Calumny answered their Purpose.</P>
<P>A great Sum of Money has been spent at <HI>Newcastle under Line,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Offley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lawton,</HI> (the latter
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Brother-in-Law to my Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI>) to get in Bur∣gesses there; but Sir <HI>Tho. Bellot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> have carried it, and the chief Reason for their succeeding was, the Assurances they gave their Electors of their firm Adhesion to the <HI>Church,</HI> in this Day of <HI>Danger.</HI></P>
<P>The Report we had of a Rencounter which hap∣pen'd in <HI>Cheshire</HI> between Sir <HI>G. Warburton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Offley,</HI> proves not true. Yesterday commenc'd the Election for the City of <HI>London,</HI> and the four Whig Candi∣dates were declared to have the Majority upon View, and are like to carry it upon the Poll.</P>

<P>WE have an Account of a great many more Ele∣ctions made since my last; and upon the whole, a sort of an Equilibrium seems to be between the Par∣ties: near 70 of the <HI>Tackers</HI> are already chosen. In <HI>Essex</HI> Sir <HI>Ch. Barrington</HI> and Sir <HI>R. Child</HI> have lost it by a great Majority, tho' they poll'd more Freeholders than in former Elections; but the <HI>Whigs</HI> have found a way of granting quit Rents of 40 Shillings <HI>per Annum,</HI> resignable upon the Tender of Six Pence: Besides, the <HI>Quakers</HI> in general throughout the Kingdom in this Election, Vote against the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>The Poll in <HI>London</HI> runs still in Favour of the four <HI>Whigs,</HI> and their Election will be declared this Even∣ing.</P>

<P>YEsterday our Letters from the several Parts of the Kingdom brought an Account of a great many more Elections that are made, and particularly for the
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
County of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> Col. <HI>Colchester</HI> and Sir <HI>John Guise</HI> have carried it against the Honourable <HI>John How</HI> and Sir <HI>Ralph Dutton</HI> Bar'. For <HI>Warwickshire</HI> the old Re∣presentatives Sir <HI>Ch. Shuckburgh</HI> and Sir <HI>John Mordaunt</HI> (the last a <HI>Tacker</HI>) have carried it, being set up by the general Consent of the Gentry of that County. One Captain <HI>Lucy,</HI> supported by the Assistance of three or four Gentlemen, and the Assistance of all the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI> attempted to have come in, but was very much distanced, as you will see by their Numbers on the Poll. Sir <HI>Ch. Shuckburgh</HI> 1984. Sir <HI>John Mordaunt</HI> 1884. Cap. <HI>Lucy</HI> 1116. The Bishop of <HI>Worcester</HI> refused the lat∣ter his Interest upon Application to his Lordship, by Reason a <HI>Fanatick Preacher</HI> is kept in his Family.</P>
<P>The <HI>Welch</HI> Elections are not yet made, but we may guess how they will be by the Loyal Health that is amongst them. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><L>He that owns with his Heart, and helps with his Hand,</L>
<L>The Church that's establish'd by the Law of the Land,</L>
<L>Conforming for Conscience, and not on Occasion,</L>
<L>Not eluding the Law by a knavish Evasion,</L>
<L>Not melted thro' Favour, nor frozen thro' Fear</L>
<L>By the Smiles of the Court, or the Frowns of a Peer,</L>
<L>But boldly maintains his Religion and Right,</L>
<L>Dares die for the one, for the other dares fight;</L>
<L>This is the Man, and this alone,</L>
<L>Whose Health now I drink, whose Friendship I own.</L></Q>
<P>Nor are the <HI>Cornish</HI> Elections yet made by Reason by a <HI>Trick</HI> or <HI>Manage</HI> the Writ has been delayed. Sir <HI>R. Vivian</HI> has had the Misfortune to break his Leg, however the Gentlemen of the County labour to support his Interest against Mr. <HI>Boscawen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
On <HI>Thursday</HI> last came on the much contested Election for the <HI>University of Cambridge.</HI> The Candidates were the Honourable <HI>Arthur Annesly,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late Fellow of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge, who had 185 Voices, and the Honourable <HI>Dixey Windsor,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Fellow of <HI>Trinity</HI> Colledge, who had 170; opposed by <HI>Fr. Godolphin,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> my <HI>Lord Treasurer</HI>'s Son, who had 162 Voices, and Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> (a late made Knight) who had 117. Notwithstanding there was all the Management and Delay possible, and the Heads of the Houses against the two first, yet 'twas carried for them, to the unspeak∣able Joy of the hopeful and promising Part of the University; by which we may see, that the Sense of <HI>both Universities</HI> was for the <HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> and that they approved of the <HI>tacking it,</HI> by choosing the same Members that joyned in it.</P>
<P>I hear the Poll at <HI>Woodstock</HI> will be printed, that it may be seen who they were that Poll'd for the <HI>Briga∣dier,</HI> whose Grand-Father was Governour of <HI>Trim</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> for the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and his Grand-Mother was Daughter to the famous Sir <HI>Hardress Waller.</HI> On his Father's Side his Pedigree was proved by an Epitaph that was made last Summer by one at the Herald Of∣fice, and was never yet upon a Tomb.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> met with terrible Opposition from the <HI>Whig</HI> Party at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> which were supported by the <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> of <HI>N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> the Lords <HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ton</HI> and <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>w</HI>; how∣ever he carried it by a considerable Majority, and they got him into the Chair before eleven, at which the <HI>Whigs</HI> look'd so simply as tho' 'twas past Twelve with them. The Management of this Victory was due in a great measure to the Neighbouring Gentry, and in a more particular manner to that honourable Gentleman Sir <HI>Tho. Willoughby,</HI> who has carried divers other Elections which he has been at with equal Success, as <HI>Newark, Retford,</HI> and <HI>Leicester</HI>; and on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 23d. is to be the Election for the County of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> where Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thornihagh</HI> are like to carry it with∣out Opposition.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Justinian Isham</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> are rechosen for the County of <HI>Northampton</HI> by a Majority of 400 Freeholders, tho' they were strenuously opposed by my Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI> (who 'tis said spent 2000 <HI>l.</HI>) and Sir <HI>Andrew St. John.</HI> Sir <HI>Will. Drake,</HI> a brave <HI>Tacker,</HI> is chosen at <HI>Honiton,</HI> with Sir <HI>Walter Young (whom the Electors made promise to be one upon Occasion)</HI> Sir <HI>John Elwill</HI> was vastly distanced: The two first were met and ushered into Town by above 1000 Gentlemen on Horse∣back, all wearing a <HI>Golden Tacker</HI> in their Hats: The same Day Mr. <HI>Reynell</HI> and Mr. <HI>Yard,</HI> two loyal Gen∣tlemen carried it at <HI>Ashburton,</HI> against Sir <HI>John Elvil</HI> and <HI>his Son.</HI></P>
<P>The two loyal <HI>Sons of the Church and Tackers, Nath.</HI> and <HI>Fred. Hern,</HI> Esquires, were unanimously rechosen at <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hump. Mackworth</HI> with Mr. <HI>Coulson</HI> at <HI>Totnes</HI>; so that the Word <HI>Tacker,</HI> which the <HI>Phana∣ticks</HI>

thought to have made a <HI>Bugbear</HI> amongst the Freeholders and other Electors, proves in most Places a <HI>Badge of Honour,</HI> that recommends those Gentlemen to them, and we see some great Men that <HI>trimmed</HI> or <HI>sneaked</HI> in the last <HI>Parliament,</HI> upon that Account, are not like to have the Honour to sit in the next.</P>

For the County of <HI>Chester,</HI> the Honourable Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> and <HI>Crew Offley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> set up by the <HI>Whig</HI> Interest, have carried it by a vast Majority against Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn</HI> and Sir <HI>George Warburton,</HI> the two late Representatives for that County, although the two latter poll'd 300 more than at the former Election, and had all the <HI>Cler∣gy</HI> and the Body of the <HI>Gentry</HI> on their Side, but this Conquest was wholly owing to above a thousand de∣feasable Freeholders that Party had made against the Election, which is a new and scandalous Practice; and if the next Parliament do not enquire into it, and put a Stop to it, the whole Constitution will be subverted. The Cry of the <HI>Whig Rabble,</HI> during this Election, was <HI>Down with the Church and the Bishops,</HI> and when about 60 of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> headed by the <HI>Dean,</HI> came to Poll, they said, <HI>Hell was broke loose, and these were the De∣vil's black Guard:</HI> They abused the Bishop, tho' ac∣cording to his peaceable Temper he did not intermed∣dle in the Election; and to compleat their Outrage, broke the Windows of the Cathedral, and another Church.</P>

<P>The Election for Knights of the Shire for <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> was commenced on <HI>Thursday</HI> the last of <HI>May.</HI> The Candidates were Sir <HI>John Delavall,</HI> Bar'. Sir <HI>Fran.

<P>No doubt but this House of Commons (the Major Part of them being <HI>Church-men</HI>) will remember and

gratify the <HI>Quakers</HI> for the Service they have done them in this Election, by supporting their Marriages by a Law, and easing them from the Payment of small Tithes, which is that they aim at; as appears by the circular Letters sent by the Heads of them to their Friends in the Country, directing them how to Vote.</P>
