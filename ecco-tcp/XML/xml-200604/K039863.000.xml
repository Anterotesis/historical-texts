<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Reverend Mr. White,</HI> so agreeably
known to the public by his <HI>Natural History
of Selborne,</HI> left behind him a series of yearly
books, containing his diurnal observations
on the occurrences in the various walks of
rural nature, from the year 1768 to the time
of his death in 1793. From these annals he
had already extracted all the matter com∣prized
in the work above mentioned, down
to the middle of 1787; but several curious
facts in the preceding numbers had not been
thus employed; and all the subsequent ones
remained untouched. It was thought a mark
of respect due to his memory, and to the re∣putation
he had acquired as a faithful and
elegant observer, not to consign these relicks
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
to neglect. The manuscripts were accord∣ingly
put into my hands for the purpose of
selecting from them what might seem worthy
of laying before the public. The present
small publication is the fruit of my research.
With no small pains I collected the mate∣rials
of it, dispersed through the records of
so many years, and gave them such an ar∣rangement
as I thought would present them
in the most agreeable and useful manner to
the lovers of natural knowledge.</P>

<P>THE mode in which the following rural
calendar of the year has been composed, was
to copy out from the journals all the cir∣cumstances
thought worthy of noting, with
the several dates of their recurrence, and to
preserve the earliest and latest of these dates;
so that the calendar exhibits the extreme
range of variation in the first occurrence of
all the phenomena mentioned. To many
of them only one date is annexed, only one
observation having been entered. This is
particularly the case with respect to the
flowering of plants, with which the book of
1768 alone was copiously filled; and it is to
be noted that this was rather a backward year.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>BIRDS IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>IN severe weather, fieldfares, red wings,
sky larks, and tit larks resort to watered
meadows for food; the latter wades up to
its belly in pursuit of the pupae of insects,
and runs along upon the floating grass and
weeds. Many gnats are on the snow near
the water, these support the birds in part.</P>
<P>Birds are much influenced in their choice
of food by colour, for though white currants
are a much sweeter fruit than red, yet they
seldom touch the former till they have de∣voured
every bunch of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="54"/>
Red-starts, Fly-catchers and Black-caps
arrive early in April. If these little delicate
beings are birds of passage, (as we have rea∣son
to suppose they are, because they are
never seen in winter) how could they, feeble
as they seem, bear up against such storms
of snow and rain, and make their way
through such meteorous turbulencies, as
one should suppose would embarrass and
retard the most hardy and resolute of the
winged nation? Yet they keep their ap∣pointed
times and seasons; and in spite of
frosts and winds return to their stations pe∣riodically
as if they had met with nothing
to obstruct them. The withdrawing and
appearance of the <HI>short winged</HI> summer birds
is a very puzzling circumstance in natural
history!</P>
<P>When the boys bring me wasps nests, my
bantam fowls fare deliciously, and when the
<PB N="59" REF="55"/>
combs are pulled to pieces, devour the
young wasps in their maggot state with the
highest glee and delight. Any insect-eating
bird would do the same; and therefore I
have often wondered that the accurate Mr.
Ray should call one species of buzzard <HI>buteo
apivorus</HI> sive <HI>vespivorus,</HI> or the <HI>honey buzzard,</HI>
because some combs of wasps happened to
be found in one of their nests. The combs
were conveyed thither doubtless for the sake
of the maggots or nymphs, and not for their
honey: since none is to be found in the
combs of wasps. Birds of prey occasionally
feed on insects: thus have I seen a tame
kite picking up the female ants full of eggs,
with much satisfaction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ROOKS.</HEAD>
<P>ROOKS are continually fighting and pulling
each others nests to pieces: these proceed∣ings
<PB N="60" REF="56"/>
are inconsistent with living in such
close community. And yet if a pair offers
to build on a single tree, the nest is plun∣dered
and demolished at once. Some rooks
roost on their nest trees. The twigs which
the rooks drop in building supply the poor
with brush-wood to light their fires. Some
unhappy pairs are not permitted to finish
any nest till the rest have completed their
building. As soon as they get a few sticks
together, a party comes and demolishes the
whole. As soon as rooks, have finished
their nests, and before they lay, the cocks
begin to feed the hens, who receive their
bounty with a fondling, tremulous voice,
and fluttering wings, and all the little blan∣dishments
that are expressed by the young
while in a helpless state. This gallant de∣portment
of the males is continued through
the whole season of incubation. These birds
<PB N="61" REF="57"/>
do not copulate on trees, nor in their nests,
but on the ground in open fields.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THRUSHES.</HEAD>
<P>THRUSHES during long droughts are of
great service in hunting out shell snails, which
they pull in pieces for their young, and are
thereby very serviceable in gardens.</P>
<P><HI>Missel</HI> thrushes do not destroy the fruit in
gardens like the other species of turdi, but
feed on the berries of misseltoe, and in the
spring on ivy berries which then begin to
ripen. In the summer, when their young
become fledge, they leave neighbourhoods,
and retire to sheep walks and wild com∣mons.</P>
<P>The magpies, when they have young, de∣stroy
the broods of missel thrushes, though
the dams are fierce birds, and fight boldly
in defence of their nests. It is probably to
<PB N="62" REF="58"/>
avoid such insults, that this species of thrush,
though wild at other times, delights to build
near houses, and in frequented walks, and
gardens.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>POULTRY.</HEAD>
<P>MANY creatures are endowed with a ready
discernment to see what will turn to their
own advantage and emolument; and often
discover more fagacity than could be ex∣pected.
Thus my neighbour's poultry watch
for waggons loaded with wheat, and running
after them, pick up a number of grains
which are shaken from the sheaves by the
agitation of the carriages. Thus, when my
brother used to take down his gun to shoot
sparrows, his cats would run out before
him, to be ready to catch up the birds as
they fell.</P>
<P>The earnest and early propensity of the
<PB N="63" REF="59"/>
gallinae to roost on high is very observable;
and discovers a strong dread impressed on
their spirits respecting vermin that may
annoy them on the ground during the hours
of darkness. Hence, poultry, if left to them∣selves
and not housed, will perch the winter
through on yew-trees and fir-trees; and
turkies, and guinea fowls, heavy as they are,
get up into apple-trees: pheasants also in
woods sleep on trees to avoid foxes; while
pea fowls climb to the tops of the highest
trees round their owner's house for security,
let the weather be ever so cold or blowing.
Partridges, it is true, roost on the ground, not
having the faculty of perching; but then the
same fear prevails in their minds; for
through apprehensions from pole-cats and
stoats, they never trust themselves to co∣verts;
but nestle together in the midst of
large fields, far removed from hedges and
<PB N="64" REF="60"/>
coppices, which they love to haunt in the
day, and where at that season they can sculk
more secure from the ravages of rapacious
birds.</P>
<P>As to ducks and geese, their awkward,
splay, web feet forbid them to settle on trees;
they therefore, in the hours of darkness and
danger, betake themselves to their own ele∣ment,
the water, where, amidst large lakes
and pools, like ships riding at anchor, they
float the whole night long in peace and se∣curity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>HEN PARTRIDGE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>A HYBRID PHEASANT.</HEAD>
<P>LORD Stawell sent me from the great
lodge in the holt a curious bird for my in∣spection.
It was found by the spaniels of
one of his keepers in a coppice, and shot on
the wing. The shape, and air, and habit
of the bird, and the scarlet ring round the
eyes, agreed well with the appearance of a
cock pheasant; but then the head and neck
and breast and belly were of a glossy black:
and though it weighed 3 lb. 3½ oz.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hen pheasants usually weigh only 2 lb. 1 oz.</NOTE> the
weight of a large full grown cock pheasant,
yet there were no signs of any spurs on the
legs, as is usual with all grown cock phea∣sants,
who have long ones. The legs and
feet were naked of feathers; and therefore it
could be nothing of the grous kind. In
<PB N="66" REF="63"/>
the tail were no long bending feathers, such
as cock pheasants usually have; and are cha∣racteristic
of the sex. The tail was much
shorter than the tail of a hen pheasant, and
blunt and square at the end. The back,
wing-feathers, and tail, were all of a pale
russet curiously streaked, somewhat like the
upper parts of a hen partridge. I returned
it, with my verdict, that it was probably a
spurious or hybrid hen bird, bred between
a cock pheasant and some domestic fowl.
When I came to talk with the keeper who
brought it, he told me that some peahens had
been known last summer to haunt the coppices
and coverts where this mule was found.</P>
<P>Mr. Elmer, of Farnham, the famous game
painter, was employed to take an exact copy
of this curious bird.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It ought to be mentioned, that
some good judges have imagined this bird to
have been a stray grous or black-cock; it is
<PB N="67" REF="64"/>
however to be observed, that Mr. W. re∣marks
that its legs and feet were naked, where∣as
those of the grous are feathered to the toes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LAND RAIL.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN brought me a <HI>land-rail</HI> or <HI>daker-hen,</HI>
a bird so rare in this district, that we
seldom see more than one or two in a sea∣son,
and those only in autumn. This is
deemed a bird of passage by all the writers:
yet from its formation seems to be poorly
qualified for migration; for its wings are
short, and placed so forward, and out of
the centre of gravity, that it flies in a very
heavy and embarrassed manner, with its legs
hanging down; and can hardly be sprung a
second time, as it runs very fast, and seems
to depend more on the swiftness of its feet
than on its flying.</P>
<P>When we came to draw it, we found the
<PB N="68" REF="65"/>
entrails so soft and tender that in appearance
they might have been dressed like the ropes
of a woodcock. The craw or crop was
small and lank, containing a mucus; the
gizzard thick and strong, and filled with
small shell snails, some whole, and many
ground to pieces through the attrition which
is occasioned by the muscular force and mo∣tion
of that intestine. We saw no gravels
among the food: perhaps the shell snails
might perform the functions of gravels or
pebbles, and might grind one another. <HI>Land-rails</HI>
used to abound formerly, I remember,
in the low wet bean fields of Christian-Malford
in North Wilts, and in the mea∣dows
near Paradise gardens at Oxford, where
I have often heard them cry crex, crex.
The bird mentioned above weighed 7½ oz.
was fat and tender, and in flavour like the
flesh of a woodcock. The liver was very
large and delicate.</P>

<HEAD>FOOD OF THE RING DOVE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of my neighbours shot a ring-dove
on an evening as it was returning from feed
and going to roost. When his wife had
picked and drawn it, she found its craw
stuffed with the most nice and tender tops
of turnips. These she washed and boiled,
and so sate down to a choice and delicate
plate of greens, culled and provided in this
extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>Hence we may see that graminivorous
birds, when grain fails, can subsist on the
leaves of vegetables. There is reason to
suppose that they would not long be healthy
without, for turkies, though corn fed, de∣light
in a variety of plants, such as cabbage,
lettuce, endive, &amp;c. And poultry pick
much grass; while geese live for months to∣gether
on commons by grazing alone.</P>

<HEAD>HEN HARRIER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. WHITE of Newton sprung a phea∣sant
in a wheat stubble, and shot at it;
when, notwithstanding the report of the gun,
it was immediately pursued by the blue
hawk, known by the name of the <HI>hen∣harrier,</HI>
but escaped into some covert. He
then sprung a second, and a third, in the same
field, that got away in the same manner;
the hawk hovering round him all the while
that he was beating the field, conscious no
doubt of the game that lurked in the
stubble. Hence we may conclude that this
bird of prey was rendered very daring and
<PB N="71" REF="68"/>
bold by hunger, and that hawks cannot al∣ways
seize their game when they please.
We may farther observe, that they cannot
pounce their quarry on the ground where it
might be able to make a stout resistance,
since so large a fowl as a pheasant could
not but be visible to the piercing eye of a
hawk when hovering over a field. Hence
that propensity of cowring and squatting till
they are almost trod on, which no doubt
was intended as a mode of security: though
long rendered destructive to the whole race
of gallinae by the invention of nets and
guns.</P>

<HEAD>GREAT SPECKLED DIVER, OR LOON.</HEAD>
<P>As one of my neighbours was traversing
Wolmer forest from Bramshot across the
moors, he found a large uncommon bird
fluttering in the heath, but not wounded,
<PB N="72" REF="69"/>
which he brought home alive. On exami∣nation
it proved to be <HI>Colymbus glacialis
Linn:</HI> the great speckled diver or loon,
which is most excellently described in Wil∣lughby's
ornithology.</P>
<P>Every part and proportion of this bird
is so incomparably adapted to its mode of
life, that in no instance do we see the wis∣dom
of God in the creation to more ad∣vantage.
The head is sharp, and smaller
than the part of the neck adjoining, in order
that it may pierce the water; the wings are
placed forward and out of the center of
gravity, for a purpose which shall be noticed
hereafter; the thighs quite at the podex, in
order to facilitate diving; and the legs are
flat, and as sharp backwards almost as the
edge of a knife, that in striking they may
easily cut the water; while the feet are
palmated, and broad for swimming, yet so
<PB N="73" REF="70"/>
folded up when advanced forward to take
a fresh stroke, as to be full as narrow as the
shank. The two exterior toes of the feet
are longest; the nails flat and broad re∣sembling
the human, which give strength
and increase the power of swimming. The
foot, when expanded, is not at right angles
to the leg or body of the bird: but the ex∣terior
part inclining towards the head forms
an acute angle with the body; the intention
being not to give motion in the line of the
legs themselves, but by the combined im∣pulse
of both in an intermediate line, the line
of the body.</P>
<P>Most people know, that have observed at
all, that the swimming of birds is nothing
more than a walking in the water, where
one foot succeeds the other as on the land;
yet no one, as far as I am aware, has re∣marked
<PB N="74" REF="71"/>
that diving fowls, while under water,
impel and row themselves forward by a mo∣tion
of their wings, as well as by the impulse
of their feet: but such is really the case, as
any person may easily be convinced who will
observe ducks when hunted by dogs in a
clear pond. Nor do I know that any one
has given a reason why the wings of diving
fowls are placed so forward: doubtless, not
for the purpose of promoting their speed in
flying, since that position certainly impedes
it; but probably for the increase of their
motion under water, by the use of four oars
instead of two; yet were the wings and feet
nearer together, as in land birds, they would,
when in action, rather hinder than assist one
another.</P>
<P>This <HI>Colymbus</HI> was of considerable bulk,
weighing only three drachms short of three
<PB N="75" REF="72"/>
pounds avoirdupois. It measured in length
from the bill to the tail (which was very
short) two feet; and to the extremities of
the toes four inches more; and the breadth
of the wings expanded was 42 inches. A
person attempted to eat the body, but found
it very strong and rancid, as is the flesh of
all birds living on fish. <HI>Divers</HI> or <HI>Loons,</HI>
though bred in the most northerly parts of
Europe, yet are seen with us in very severe
winters; and on the Thames are called <HI>sprat
loons,</HI> because they prey much on that sort
of fish.</P>
<P>The legs of the <HI>Colymbi</HI> and <HI>Mergi</HI> are
placed so very backward, and so out of all
center of gravity, that these birds cannot
walk at all. They are called by Linnaeus
<HI>compedes,</HI> because they move on the ground
as if shackled, or fettered.</P>

<HEAD>STONE CURLEW.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 27th of February 1788, <HI>Stone Cur∣lews</HI>
were heard to pipe; and on March 1st,
after it was dark, some were passing over the
village, as might be perceived by their
quick short note, which they use in their
nocturnal excursions by way of watch-word,
that they may not stray and lose their com∣panions.</P>
<P>Thus, we see, that retire whithersoever they
may in the winter, they return again early
in the spring, and are, as it now appears,
the first summer birds that come back.
Perhaps the mildness of the season may
have quickened the emigration of the cur∣lews
this year.</P>
<P>They spend the day in high elevated fields
and sheep-walks; but seem to descend in the

<HEAD>FERN OWL, OR GOAT SUCKER.</HEAD>
<P>THE country people have a notion that
the <HI>fern owl,</HI> or <HI>churn owl,</HI> or <HI>eve-jarr,</HI> which
they also call a <HI>puckeridge,</HI> is very injurious
to weanling calves, by inflicting, as it strikes
at them, the fatal distemper known to cow∣leeches
by the name of <HI>puckeridge.</HI> Thus
does this harmless, ill-fated bird fall under
a double imputation which it by no means
<PB N="78" REF="75"/>
deserves; in Italy, of sucking the teats of
goats, whence it is called <HI>caprimulgus</HI>; and
with us, of communicating a deadly disorder
to cattle. But the truth of the matter is, the
malady above mentioned is occasioned by
the <HI>Oestrus bovis,</HI> a dipterous insect which
lays its eggs along the chines of kine, where
the maggots, when hatched, eat their way
through the hide of the beast into the flesh,
and grow to a very large size. I have just
talked with a man, who says, he has more
than once stripped calves who have died of
the <HI>puckeridge</HI>; that the ail or complaint lay
along the chine, where the flesh was much
swelled, and filled with purulent matter.
Once I myself saw a large rough maggot of
this sort squeezed out of the back of a cow.</P>
<P>These maggots in Essex are called wornils.</P>
<P>The least observation and attention would
convince men, that these birds neither injure
<PB N="79" REF="76"/>
the goatherd nor the grazier, but are per∣fectly
harmless, and subsist alone, being night
birds, on night insects, such as <HI>scarabaei</HI> and
<HI>phalaenae</HI>; and through the month of July
mostly on the <HI>scarabaeus solstitialis,</HI> which in
many districts abounds at that season. Those
that we have opened, have always had their
craws stuffed with large night-moths and
their eggs, and pieces of chaffers: nor does
it anywise appear how they can, weak and
unarmed as they seem, inflict any harm
upon kine, unless they possess the powers of
animal magnetism, and can affect them by
fluttering over them.</P>
<P>A <HI>fern owl,</HI> this evening (August 27),
showed off in a very unusual and entertaining
manner, by hawking round and round the
circumference of my great spreading oak,
for twenty times following, keeping mostly
close to the grass, but occasionally glanc∣ing
<PB N="80" REF="77"/>
up amidst the boughs of the tree. This
amusing bird was then in pursuit of a brood
of some particular phalaena belonging to the
oak, of which there are several sorts; and
exhibited on the occasion a command of
wing superior, I think, to that of the swallow
itself.</P>
<P>When a person approaches the haunt of
fern-owls in an evening, they continue fly∣ing
round the head of the obtruder, and by
striking their wings together above their
backs, in the manner that the pigeons called
smiters are known to do, make a smart
snap: perhaps at that time they are jealous
for their young; and this noise and gesture
are intended by way of menace.</P>
<P>Fern-owls have attachment to oaks, no
doubt on account of food; for the next
evening we saw one again several times
among the boughs of the same tree; but it
<PB N="81" REF="78"/>
did not skim round its stem over the grass;
as on the evening before. In May these
birds find the <HI>Scarabaeus melolontha</HI> on the
oak; and the <HI>Scarabaeus solstitialis</HI> at Mid∣summer.
These peculiar birds can only be
watched and observed for two hours in the
twenty-four; and then in a dubious twilight,
an hour after sun-set and an hour before
sun-rise.</P>
<P>On this day (July 14, 1789) a woman
brought me two eggs of a <HI>fern-owl,</HI> or <HI>eve-jarr,</HI>
which she found on the verge of the
hanger, to the left of the hermitage under
a beechen shrub. This person, who lives
just at the foot of the hanger, seems well
acquainted with these nocturnal swallows,
and says she has often found their eggs near
that place, and that they lay only two at a
time on the bare ground. The eggs were
oblong, dusky, and streaked somewhat in the
<PB N="82" REF="79"/>
manner of the plumage of the parent bird,
and were equal in size at each end. The
dam was sitting on the eggs when found,
which contained the rudiments of young,
and would have been hatched perhaps in a
week. From hence we may see the time
of their breeding, which corresponds pretty
well with that of the swift, as does also the
period of their arrival. Each species is
usually seen about the beginning of May.
Each breeds but once in a summer; each
lays only two eggs.</P>
<P>July 4, 1790. The woman who brought
me two <HI>Fern-owls</HI> eggs last year on July 14,
on this day produced me two more, one of
which had been laid this morning, as ap∣pears
plainly, because there was only one in
the nest the evening before. They were
found, as last July, on the verge of the down
above the hermitage under a beechen shrub,
<PB N="83" REF="80"/>
on the naked ground.—Last year those eggs
were full of young, and just ready to be
hatched.</P>
<P>These circumstances point out the exact
time when these curious nocturnal migra∣tory
birds lay their eggs, and hatch their
young.</P>
<P><HI>Fern-owls,</HI> like snipes, stone curlews, and
some other birds, make no nest. Birds that
build on the ground do not make much of
nests.</P>

<HEAD>SAND MARTINS.</HEAD>
<P>MARCH 23, 1788. A gentleman who was
this week on a visit at Waverley, took the
opportunity of examining some of the holes
in the sand banks with which that district
abounds. As these are undoubtedly bored
by bank-martins, and are the places where
they avowedly breed, he was in hopes they
<PB N="84" REF="81"/>
might have slept there also, and that he
might have surprised them just as they
were awaking from their winter slumbers.
When he had dug for some time, he found
the holes were horizontal, and serpentine, as
I had observed before; and that the nests
were deposited at the inner end, and had
been occupied by broods in former summers:
but no torpid birds were to be found. He
opened and examined about a dozen holes.
Another gentleman made the same search
many years ago, with as little success.</P>
<P>These holes were in depth about two
feet.</P>
<P>March 21, 1790. A single <HI>bank</HI> or <HI>sand
martin</HI> was seen hovering and playing round
the sand pit at Short heath, where in the
summer they abound.</P>
<P>April 9, 1793. A sober hind assures us,
that this day, on Wish-hanger common be∣tween
<PB N="85" REF="82"/>
Hedleigh and Frinsham, he saw seve∣ral
<HI>bank-martins</HI> playing in and out, and
hanging before some nest holes in a sand
hill, where these birds usually nestle.</P>
<P>This incident confirms my suspicions, that
this species of hirundo is to be seen first of
any; and gives great reason to suppose that
they do not leave their wild haunts at all,
but are secreted amidst the clefts and caverns
of those abrupt cliffs where they usually spend
their summers.</P>
<P>The late severe weather considered, it is
not very probable that these birds should
have migrated so early from a tropical re∣gion,
through all these cutting winds, and
pinching frosts: but it is easy to suppose that
they may, like bats and flies, have been
awakened by the influence of the sun, amidst
their secret latebrae where they have spent the
<PB N="86" REF="83"/>
uncomfortable, foodless months in a torpid
state, and the profoundest of slumbers.</P>
<P>There is a large pond at Wish-hanger
which induces these <HI>sand-martins</HI> to frequent
that district. For I have ever remarked that
they haunt near great waters, either rivers,
or lakes.</P>

<HEAD>SWALLOWS, CONGREGATING, AND
DISAPPEARANCE OF.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the severe winds that often pre∣vail
late in the spring, it is not easy to say
how the hirundines subsist: for they with∣draw
themselves, and are hardly ever seen,
nor do any insects appear for their support.
That they can retire to rest, and sleep away
these uncomfortable periods, as the bats do,
is a matter rather to be suspected than
proved: or do they not rather spend their
<PB N="87" REF="84"/>
time in deep and sheltered vales near waters,
where insects are more likely to be found?
Certain it is, that hardly any individuals of
this genus have at such times been seen for
several days together.</P>
<P>September 13, 1791. The congregating
flocks of hirundines on the church and tower
are very beautiful and amusing! When they
fly off all together from the roof, on any
alarm, they quite swarm in the air. But
they soon settle in heaps, and preening their
feathers, and lifting up their wings to admit
the sun, seem highly to enjoy the warm
situation. Thus they spend the heat of the
day, preparing for their emigration, and as it
were consulting when and where they are to
go. The flight about the church seems to
consist chiefly of house-martins, about 400
in number: but there are other places of
<PB N="88" REF="85"/>
rendezvouz about the village frequented at
the same time.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that though most of them
sit on the battlements and roof, yet many
hang or cling for some time by their claws
against the surface of the walls, in a manner
not practised by them at any other time of
their remaining with us.</P>
<P>The swallows seem to delight more in
holding their assemblies on trees.</P>
<P>Nov. 3, 1789. Two swallows were seen
this morning at Newton vicarage house,
hovering and settling on the roofs and out-buildings.
None have been observed at
Selborne since October 11. It is very re∣markable,
that after the hirundines have dis∣appeared
for some weeks, a few are occa∣sionally
seen again. Sometimes, in the first
week in November, and that only for one
<PB N="89" REF="86"/>
day. Do they not withdraw and slumber in
some hiding place during the interval? for
we cannot suppose they had migrated to
warmer climes, and so returned again for
one day. Is it not more probable that they
are awakened from sleep, and like the bats
are come forth to collect a little food? Bats
appear at all seasons, through the autumn
and spring months, when the thermometer is
at 50, because then phalaenae, moths, are
stirring.</P>
<P>These swallows looked like young ones.</P>

<HEAD>WAGTAILS.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the cows are feeding in moist low

under their very bellies, availing themselves
of the flies that settle on their legs, and
probably finding worms and larvae that are

<P>THESE birds appear on the grass-plots and

they hold their bills in the grass, they draw
out their prey with their tongues, which are
so long as to be coiled round their heads.</P>

<HEAD>GROSBEAK.</HEAD>
<P>MR. B. shot a cock grosbeak which he

than a fortnight. I began to accuse this
bird of making sad havock among the buds
<PB N="91" REF="88"/>
of the cherries, gooseberries, and wall fruit,
of all the neighbouring orchards. Upon
opening its crop or craw, no buds were to
be seen; but a mass of kernels of the stones
of fruits. Mr. B. observed that this bird
frequented the spot where plum trees grow;
and that he had seen it with somewhat hard
in its mouth, which it broke with difficulty;
these were the stones of damsons. The latin
ornithologists call this bird <HI>coccothraustes,</HI> i. e.
<HI>berry-breaker,</HI> because with its large, horny
beak, it cracks and breaks the shells of stone
fruits for the sake of the seed or kernel.
Birds of this sort are rarely seen in England,

<HEAD>SHEEP.</HEAD>
<P>THE sheep on the downs this winter
(1769) are very ragged, and their coats
much torn; the shepherds say they tear their
fleeces with their own mouths and horns,
and that they are always in that way in mild,
wet winters, being teased and tickled with a
kind of lice.</P>
<P>After ewes and lambs are shorn, there is
great confusion and bleating, neither the
dams nor the young being able to distinguish
one another as before. This embarrassment
seems not so much to arise from the loss of
<PB N="93" REF="90"/>
the fleece, which may occasion an alteration
in their appearance, as from the defect of
that <HI>notus odor,</HI> discriminating each individual
personally; which also is confounded by the
strong scent of the pitch and tar wherewith
they are newly marked. For the brute
creation recognize each other more from the
<HI>smell</HI> than the <HI>sight</HI>; and in matters of iden∣tity

<HEAD>CAT AND SQUIRRELS.</HEAD>
<P>A BOY has taken three little young squir∣rels
in their nest or <HI>drey</HI> as it is called in these
parts. These small creatures he put under
the care of a cat who had lately lost her
kittens, and finds that she nurses and suckles
them with the same assiduity and affection
as if they were her own offspring. This
circumstance corroborates my suspicion, that
the mention of exposed and deserted children
being nurtured by female beasts of prey who
had lost their young, may not be so impro∣bable
an incident as many have supposed;
and therefore may be a justification of those
authors, who have gravely mentioned, what
some have deemed to be a wild and impro∣bable
story.</P>
<P>So many people went to see the little
squirrels suckled by a cat, that the foster
<PB N="95" REF="92"/>
mother became jealous of her charge, and in
pain for their safety; and therefore hid them
over the ceiling, where one died. This cir∣cumstance
shews her affection for these
foundlings, and that she supposes the squirrels
to be her own young. Thus hens, when
they have hatched ducklings, are equally
attached to them as if they were their own

one. For as a person was lately pursuing a
pheasant that was wing-broken, in Hartley

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON INSECTS
AND VERMES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>INSECTS IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE day and night insects occupy the
annuals alternately: the papilios, muscae, and
apes, are succeeded at the close of the day
by phalaenae, earwigs, woodlice, &amp;c. In the
dusk of the evening, when beetles begin to
buz, partridges begin to call; these two cir∣cumstances
are exactly coincident.</P>
<P>Ivy is the last flower that supports the
hymenopterous and dipterous insects. On
sunny days quite on to November they
swarm on trees covered with this plant; and
when they disappear, probably retire under
<PB N="98" REF="95"/>
the shelter of its leaves, concealing them∣selves
between its fibres and the trees which
it entwines.</P>
<P>Spiders, woodlice, lepismae in cupboards
and among sugar, some empedes, gnats, flies
of several species, some phalaenae in hedges,
earth-worms, &amp;c. are stirring at all times
when winters are mild; and are of great
service to those soft-billed birds that never
leave us.</P>
<P>On every sunny day the winter through,
clouds of insects usually called gnats (I sup∣pose
tipulae and empedes) appear sporting
and dancing over the tops of the ever-green
trees in the shrubbery, and frisking about as
if the business of generation was still going
on. Hence it appears that these diptera
(which by their sizes appear to be of diffe∣rent
species) are not subject to a torpid state
in the winter, as most winged insects are.
<PB N="99" REF="96"/>
At night, and in frosty weather, and when it
rains and blows, they seem to retire into
those trees. They often are out in a fog.</P>

<HEAD>HUMMING IN THE AIR.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a natural occurrence to be met
with upon the highest part of our down in
hot summer days, which always amuses me
much, without giving me any satisfaction
with respect to the cause of it; and that is
a loud audible humming of bees in the air,
though not one insect is to be seen. This
sound is to be heard distinctly the whole
common through, from the Money-dells, to
Mr. White's avenue gate. Any person
would suppose that a large swarm of bees
was in motion, and playing about over his
head. This noise was heard last week; on
June 28th.</P>

<HEAD>PTINUS PECTINICORNIS.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE maggots that make worm-holes in
tables, chairs, bed-posts, &amp;c. and destroy
wooden furniture, especially where there is any
sap, are the larvae of the Ptinus pectinicornis.
This insect, it is probable, deposits its eggs
on the surface, and the worms eat their way
in.</P>
<P>In their holes they turn into their pupae
state, and so come forth winged in July;
eating their way through the valances or
curtains of a bed, or any other furniture that
happens to obstruct their passage.</P>
<P>They seem to be most inclined to breed
in beech; hence beech will not make lasting
utensils, or furniture. If their eggs are de∣posited
on the surface, frequent rubbings
will preserve wooden furniture.</P>

<HEAD>BLATTA ORIENTALIS. COCKROACH.</HEAD>
<P>A NEIGHBOUR complained to me that her
house was over-run with a kind of <HI>black
beetle,</HI> or, as she expressed herself, with a kind
of <HI>black-bob,</HI> which swarmed in her kitchen
when they get up in a morning before day
break.</P>
<P>Soon after this account, I observed an un∣usual
insect in one of my dark chimney
closets, and find since, that in the night they
swarm also in my kitchen. On examination,
I soon ascertained the species to be the
<HI>blatta orientalis</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> and the <HI>blatta
molendinaria</HI> of <HI>Mouffet.</HI> The male is winged;
the female is not, but shows somewhat like
the rudiments of wings, as if in the pupa
state.</P>
<P>These insects belonged originally to the
warmer parts of America, and were con∣veyed
<PB N="103" REF="100"/>
from thence by shipping to the East
Indies; and by means of commerce begin
to prevail in the more northern parts of
Europe, as Russia, Sweden, &amp;c. How long
they have abounded in England I cannot
say; but have never observed them in my
house till lately.</P>
<P>They love warmth, and haunt chimney-closets,
and the backs of ovens. <HI>Poda</HI> says
that these and house crickets will not associ∣ate
together; but he is mistaken in that as∣sertion,
as <HI>Linnaeus</HI> suspected he was. They
are altogether night insects, <HI>lucifugae,</HI> never
coming forth till the rooms are dark and
still, and escaping away nimbly at the ap∣proach
of a candle. Their antennae are re∣markably
long, slender, and flexile.</P>
<P>October, 1790. After the servants are
gone to bed, the kitchen hearth swarms with
young crickets, and young <HI>blattae molendinariae</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="101"/>
of all sizes, from the most minute growth to
their full proportions. They seem to live
in a friendly manner together, and not to
prey the one on the other.</P>
<P>August, 1792. After the destruction of
many thousands of <HI>blattae molendinariae,</HI> we
find that at intervals a fresh detachment
of old ones arrives; and particularly during
this hot season: for the windows being left
open in the evenings, the males come flying
in at the casements from the neighbouring
houses, which swarm with them. How the
females, that seem to have no perfect wings
that they can use, can contrive to get from
house to house, does not so readily appear.
These, like many insects, when they find
their present abodes over-stocked, have
powers of migrating to fresh quarters. Since
the <HI>blattae</HI> have been so much kept under,
the crickets have greatly increased in number.</P>

<HEAD>GRYLLUS DOMEST. HOUSE CRICKET.</HEAD>
<P>NOVEMBER. After the servants are gone
to bed, the kitchen hearth swarms with mi∣nute
crickets not so large as fleas, which
must have been lately hatched. So that
these domestic insects, cherished by the in∣fluence
of a constant large fire, regard not
the season of the year, but produce their
young at a time when their congeners are
either dead, or laid up for the winter, to
pass away the uncomfortable months in the
profoundest slumbers, and a state of tor∣pidity.</P>
<P>When house-crickets are out, and running
about in a room in the night, if surprised by
a candle, they give two or three shrill notes,
as it were for a signal to their fellows, that
they may escape to their crannies and lurking
holes, to avoid danger.</P>

<HEAD>CIMEX LINEARIS.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUST 12, 1775. <HI>Cimices lineares</HI> are now
in high copulation on ponds and pools. The
females, who vastly exceed the males in bulk,
dart and shoot along on the surface of the
water with the males on their backs. When
a female chooses to be disengaged, she rears,
and jumps, and plunges, like an unruly colt;
the lover thus dismounted, soon finds a new
mate. The females, as fast as their curiosi∣ties
are satisfied, retire to another part of the
lake, perhaps to deposit their foetus in quiet;
hence the sexes are found separate, except
where generation is going on. From the
multitude of minute young of all gradations
of sizes, these insects seem without doubt to
be viviparous.</P>

<HEAD>PHALAENA QUERCUS.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of our oaks are naked of leaves, and
even the <HI>Holt</HI> in general, having been ravaged
by the caterpillars of a small <HI>phalaena</HI> which
is of a pale yellow colour. These insects,
though a feeble race, yet from their infinite
numbers are of wonderful effect, being able
to destroy the foliage of whole forests and
districts. At this season they leave their <HI>au∣relia,</HI>
and issue forth in their <HI>fly</HI>-state, swarm∣ing
and covering the trees and hedges.</P>
<P>In a field at Greatham, I saw a flight of
<HI>swifts</HI> busied in catching their prey near the
ground; and found they were hawking after
these <HI>phalaenae.</HI> The <HI>aurelia</HI> of this moth is
shining and as black as jet; and lies wrapped
up in a leaf of the tree, which is rolled round
it, and secured at the ends by a web, to pre∣vent
the maggot from falling out.</P>

<HEAD>EPHEMERA CAUDA BISETA. MAY
FLY.</HEAD>
<P>JUNE 10, 1771. Myriads of May flies
appear for the first time on the Alresford
stream. The air was crowded with them,
and the surface of the water covered. Large
trouts sucked them in as they lay struggling
on the surface of the stream, unable to rise
till their wings were dried.</P>
<P>This appearance reconciled me in some
measure to the wonderful account that
Scopoli gives of the quantities emerging
from the rivers of Carniola. Their motions
are very peculiar, up and down for many
yards almost in a perpendicular line.</P>

<P>A VAST insect appears after it is dusk,
flying with a humming noise, and inserting its

tongue into the bloom of the honey-suckle;
it scarcely settles upon the plants, but feeds
on the wing in the manner of humming
birds.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>WILD BEE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a sort of wild bee frequenting
the garden-campion for the sake of its to∣mentum,
which probably it turns to some
purpose in the business of nidification. It is
very pleasant to see with what address it
strips off the pubes, running from the top to
the bottom of a branch, and shaving it bare
with all the dexterity of a hoop-shaver.
When it has got a vast bundle, almost as
large as itself, it flies away, holding it secure
between its chin and its fore legs.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable hill on the downs
near <HI>Lewes</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> known by the name of
<HI>Mount Carburn,</HI> which overlooks that town,
<PB N="110" REF="107"/>
and affords a most engaging prospect of all
the country round, besides several views of
the sea. On the very summit of this exalted
promontory, and amidst the trenches of its
Danish camp, there haunts a species of wild
bee, making its nest in the chalky soil.
When people approach the place, these in∣sects
begin to be alarmed, and with a sharp
and hostile sound, dash and strike round
the heads and faces of intruders. I have
often been interrupted myself while contem∣plating
the grandeur of the scenery around
me, and have thought myself in danger of
being stung.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>WASPS.</HEAD>
<P>WASPS abound in woody wild districts
far from neighbourhoods; they feed on
flowers, and catch flies and caterpillars, to
carry to their young. Wasps make their nests
<PB N="111" REF="108"/>
with the raspings of sound timber; hornets,
with what they gnaw from decayed: these par∣ticles
of wood are kneaded up with a mix∣ture
of saliva from their bodies, and moulded
into combs.</P>
<P>When there is no fruit in the gardens,
wasps eat flies, and suck the honey from
flowers, from ivy blossoms, and umbellated
plants: they carry off also flesh from butchers
shambles.</P>

<HEAD>OESTRUS CURVICAUDA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS insect lays its nits or eggs on
horses' legs, flanks, &amp;c. each on a single

It seems to abound most in moist, moorish
places, though sometimes seen in the up∣lands.</P>

<HEAD>NOSE FLY.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of July, a species of
fly (musca) obtains, which proves very tor∣menting
to horses, trying still to enter their
nostrils and ears, and actually laying their
eggs in the latter of those organs, or perhaps
in both. When these abound, horses in
woodland districts become very impatient at
their work, continually tossing their heads,
and rubbing their noses on each other, re∣gardless
of the driver, so that accidents often
ensue. In the heat of the day, men are often
obliged to desist from plowing. Saddle-horses
are also very troublesome at such seasons.
Country people call this insect the <HI>nose fly.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ICHNEUMON FLY.</HEAD>
<P>I SAW lately a small Ichneumon fly at∣tack
a spider much larger than itself on a
<PB N="113" REF="110"/>
grass walk. When the spider made any re∣sistance,
the Ichneumon applied her tail to
him, and stung him with great vehemence,
so that he soon became dead and motionless.
The Ichneumon then running backward drew
her prey very nimbly over the walk into the
standing grass. This spider would be de∣posited
in some hole where the Ichneumon
would lay some eggs; and as soon as the
eggs were hatched, the carcase would afford
ready food for the maggots.</P>
<P>Perhaps some eggs might be injected into
the body of the spider, in the act of stinging.
Some Ichneumons deposit their eggs in the
aurelia of moths and butterflies.</P>

<HEAD>BOMBYLIUS MEDIUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>bombylius medius</HI> is much about in
March and the beginning of April, and soon
seems to retire. It is an hairy insect, like
<PB N="114" REF="111"/>
an humble-bee, but with only two wings,
and a long straight beak, with which it
sucks the early flowers. The female seems
to lay its eggs as it poises on its wings, by
striking its tail on the ground, and against
the grass that stands in its way, in a quick
manner, for several times together.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>MUSCAE.—FLIES.</HEAD>
<P>IN the decline of the year, when the
mornings and evenings become chilly, many
species of flies (muscae) retire into houses,
and swarm in the windows.</P>
<P>At first they are very brisk and alert; but
as they grow more torpid, one cannot help
observing that they move with difficulty, and
are scarce able to lift their legs, which seem
as if glued to the glass; and by degrees
many do actually stick on till they die in the
place.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="112"/>
It has been observed that divers flies, be∣sides
their sharp, hooked nails, have also
skinny palms, or flaps to their feet, whereby
they are enabled to stick on glass and other
smooth bodies, and to walk on ceilings with
their backs downward by means of the pressure
of the atmosphere on those flaps: the weight
of which they easily overcome in warm wea∣ther
when they are brisk and alert. But in the
decline of the year, this resistance becomes
too mighty for their diminished strength; and
we see flies labouring along, and lugging
their feet in windows as if they stuck fast to
the glass, and it is with the utmost difficulty
they can draw one foot after another, and
disengage their hollow caps from the slippery
surface.</P>
<P>Upon the same principle that flies stick
and support themselves, do boys, by way of
play, carry heavy weights by only a piece of
<PB N="116" REF="113"/>
wet leather at the end of a string clapped
close on the surface of a stone.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>TIPULAE, OR EMPEDES.</HEAD>
<P>MILLIONS of <HI>empedes,</HI> or <HI>tipulae,</HI> come forth
at the close of day, and swarm to such a
degree as to fill the air. At this juncture
they sport and copulate; as it grows more
dark they retire. All day they hide in the
hedges. As they rise in a cloud they appear
like smoke.</P>
<P>I do not ever remember to have seen such
swarms, except in the fens of the Isle of Ely.
They appear most over grass grounds.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ANTS.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUST 23. Every ant-hill about this
time is in a strange hurry and confusion; and
all the winged ants, agitated by some violent
impulse, are leaving their homes, and, bent
<PB N="117" REF="114"/>
on emigration, swarm by myriads in the air,
to the great emolument of the hirundines,
which fare luxuriously. Those that escape
the swallows return no more to their nests,
but looking out for fresh settlements, lay a
foundation for future colonies. All the fe∣males
at this time are pregnant: the males
that escape being eaten, wander away and
die.</P>
<P>October 2. Flying-ants, male and female,
usually swarm and migrate on hot sunny
days in August and September; but this
day a vast emigration took place in my gar∣den,
and myriads came forth, in appearance
from the drain which goes under the fruit
wall; filling the air and the adjoining trees
and shrubs with their numbers. The fe∣males
were full of eggs. This late swarm∣ing
is probably owing to the backward, wet
<PB N="118" REF="115"/>
season. The day following, not one flying
ant was to be seen.</P>
<P>Horse-ants travel home to their nests
laden with flies, which they have caught,
and the aureliae of smaller ants, which they
seize by violence.</P>

<HEAD>GLOW WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>BY observing two glow-worms which
were brought from the field to the bank in
the garden, it appeared to us, that these little
creatures put out their lamps between eleven

the night.</P>
<P>Male glow-worms, attracted by the light

<HEAD>EARTH WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>EARTH worms make their casts most in
mild weather about March and April; they
<PB N="119" REF="116"/>
do not lie torpid in winter, but come forth
when there is no frost; they travel about in
rainy nights, as appears from their sinuous
tracks on the soft muddy soil, perhaps in
search of food.</P>
<P>When earth-worms lie out a-nights on the
turf, though they extend their bodies a great
way, they do not quite leave their holes, but
keep the ends of their tails fixed therein, so
that on the least alarm they can retire with
precipitation under the earth. Whatever
food falls within their reach when thus ex∣tended,
they seem to be content with, such
as blades of grass, straws, fallen leaves, the
ends of which they often draw into their
holes; even in copulation their hinder parts
never quit their holes; so that no two, ex∣cept
they lie within reach of each other's
bodies, can have any commerce of that kind;
but as every individual is an hermaphrodite,
<PB N="120" REF="117"/>
there is no difficulty in meeting with a mate,
as would be the case were they of different
sexes.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SNAILS AND SLUGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE shell-less snails called slugs are in
motion all the winter in mild weather, and
commit great depredations on garden plants,
and much injure the green wheat, the loss
of which is imputed to earth worms; while
the shelled snail, the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, does not
come forth at all till about April 10th,
and not only lays itself up pretty early in
autumn, in places secure from frost, but
also throws out round the mouth of its shell
a thick operculum formed from its own
saliva; so that it is perfectly secured, and
corked up as it were, from all inclemencies.
The cause why the slugs are able to endure
the cold so much better than shell snails is,
<PB N="121" REF="118"/>
that their bodies are covered with slime as
whales are with blubber.</P>
<P>Snails copulate about Midsummer; and
soon after, deposit their eggs in the mould
by running their heads and bodies under
ground. Hence the way to be rid of them
is to kill as many as possible before they be∣gin
to breed.</P>
<P>Large, grey, shell-less, cellar snails lay
themselves up about the same time with
those that live abroad; hence it is plain that
a defect of warmth is not the only cause that
influences their retreat.</P>

<P>ABOUT the middle of this month (Sep∣tember)
we found in a field near a hedge
the slough of a large snake, which seemed
<PB N="122" REF="119"/>
to have been newly cast. From circum∣stances
it appeared as if turned wrong side
outward, and as drawn off backward, like a
stocking or woman's glove. Not only the
whole skin, but scales from the very eyes,
are peeled off, and appear in the head of the
slough like a pair of spectacles. The rep∣tile,
at the time of changing his coat, had
entangled himself intricately in the grass and
weeds, so that the friction of the stalks and
blades might promote this curious shifting
of his exuviae.</P>
<Q><L>—Lubrica serpens</L>
<L>Exuit in spinis vestem.</L><BIBL>Lucret.</BIBL></Q>
<P>It would be a most entertaining sight
could a person be an eye-witness to such a
feat, and see the snake in the act of chang∣ing
his garment. As the convexity of the
scales of the eyes in the slough is now in∣ward,
that circumstance alone is a proof that
<PB N="123" REF="120"/>
the skin has been turned: not to mention
that now the present inside is much darker
than the outer. If you look through the
scales of the snake's eyes from the concave
side, viz. as the reptile used them, they lessen
objects much. Thus it appears from what
has been said, that snakes crawl out of the
mouth of their own sloughs, and quit the
tail part last, just as eels are skinned by a
cook maid. While the scales of the eyes
are growing loose, and a new skin is form∣ing,
the creature, in appearance, must be
blind, and feel itself in an awkward uneasy
situation.</P>

length) is 8 feet 2 inches. So if the bark
was to be measured as timber, the tree gives
116½ feet, buyers measure. Perhaps you
never heard of a larger oak while the plant∣er
was living. I flatter myself that I in∣creased
the growth by washing the stem,
and digging a circle as far as I supposed the
roots to extend, and by spreading saw-dust,
&amp;c. as related in the Phil. Trans. I wish
I had begun with beeches (my favourite

seen very large trees of my own raising.
But I did not begin with beech till 1741,

in old times lost several of its boughs, and
is tending to decay. Mr. Marsham com∣putes,
that at 14 feet length this oak con∣tains
1000 feet of timber.</P>
<P>It has been the received opinion that trees
grow in height only by their annual upper
shoot. But my neighbour over the way,
whose occupation confines him to one spot,
assures me, that trees are expanded and
raised in the lower parts also. The reason
that he gives is this; the point of one of
my firs began for the first time to peep over
an opposite roof at the beginning of sum∣mer;
but before the growing season was
over, the whole shoot of the year, and three
or four joints of the body beside, became
visible to him as he sits on his form in his
shop. According to this supposition, a tree
<PB N="128" REF="125"/>
may advance in height considerably, though
the summer shoot should be destroyed every
year.</P>

<HEAD>FLOWING OF SAP.</HEAD>
<P>IF the bough of a vine is cut late in the
spring, just before the shoots push out, it
will bleed considerably; but after the leaf
is out, any part may be taken off without
the least inconvenience. So oaks may be
barked while the leaf is budding; but as
soon as they are expanded, the bark will no
longer part from the wood, because the sap
that lubricates the bark and makes it part,
is evaporated off through the leaves.</P>

<HEAD>SYCAMORE.</HEAD>
<P>MAY 12. The sycamore or great maple
is in bloom, and at this season makes a beau∣tiful
appearance, and affords much pabu∣lum
for bees, smelling strongly like honey.
The foliage of this tree is very fine, and

<HEAD>GALLS OF LOMBARDY POPLAR.</HEAD>
<P>THE stalks and ribs of the leaves of the
Lombardy poplar are embossed with large
tumours of an oblong shape, which by in∣curious
observers have been taken for the
fruit of the tree. These galls are full of
small insects, some of which are winged, and

<HEAD>CHESTNUT TIMBER.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN CARPENTER brings home some old
chestnut trees which are very long; in se∣veral
places the wood-peckers had begun to
bore them. The timber and bark of these
<PB N="131" REF="128"/>
trees are so very like oak, as might easily
deceive an indifferent observer, but the
wood is very shakey, and towards the heart
<HI>cup-shakey,</HI> (that is to say, apt to separate
in round pieces like cups) so that the inward
parts are of no use. They were bought for
the purpose of cooperage, but must make
but ordinary barrels, buckets, &amp;c. Chestnut
sells for half the price of oak; but has some∣times
been sent into the king's docks, and
passed off instead of oak.</P>

<HEAD>LIME BLOSSOMS.</HEAD>
<P>DR. CHANDLER tells that in the south of
France, an infusion of the blossoms of the

and that at Nismes he saw an avenue of
limes that was quite ravaged and torn in
pieces by people greedily gathering the

purposes.</P>
<P>Upon the strength of this information we
made some tea of lime blossoms, and found

<HEAD>HOPS.</HEAD>
<P>THE culture of Virgil's vines corresponded
very exactly with the modern management
of hops. I might instance in the perpetual
diggings and hoeings, in the tying to the
stakes, and poles, in pruning the superflu∣ous
shoots, &amp;c. but lately I have observed a
new circumstance, which was a neighbour∣ing
farmer's harrowing between the rows of
hops with a small triangular harrow, drawn
by one horse, and guided by two handles.
This occurrence brought to my mind the
following passage.</P>
<Q><L>—ipsa</L>
<L>Flectere luctantes inter vineta juvencos.</L><BIBL>Georgic. II.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Hops are diécious plants: hence perhaps
it might be proper, though not practised, to
leave purposely some male plants in every
<PB N="134" REF="131"/>
garden, that their farina might impregnate
the blossoms. The female plants without
their male attendants are not in their natural
state: hence we may suppose the frequent
failure of crop so incident to hop-grounds; no
other growth, cultivated by man, has such
frequent and general failures as hops.</P>
<P>Two hop gardens much injured by a hail
storm, June 5, shew now (September 2) a
prodigious crop, and larger and fairer hops
than any in the parish. The owners seem
now to be convinced that the hail, by beat∣ing
off the tops of the binds, has increased
the side-shoots, and improved the crop.
Query. Therefore should not the tops of
hops be pinched off when the binds are very
gross, and strong?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SEED LYING DORMANT.</HEAD>
<P>THE naked part of the Hanger is now co∣vered
with thistles of various kinds. The
<PB N="135" REF="132"/>
seeds of these thistles may have lain pro∣bably
under the thick shade of the beeches
for many years, but could not vegetate till
the sun and air were admitted. When old
beech trees are cleared away, the naked
ground in a year or two becomes covered
with strawberry plants, the seeds of which
must have lain in the ground for an age at
least. One of the <HI>slidders</HI> or trenches down
the middle of the Hanger, close covered over
with lofty beeches near a century old, is still
called <HI>strawberry slidder,</HI> though no straw∣berries
have grown there in the memory of
man. That sort of fruit did once, no doubt,
abound there, and will again when the ob∣struction
is removed.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>BEANS SOWN BY BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY horse-beans sprang up in my field-walks
in the autumn, and are now grown to
<PB N="136" REF="133"/>
a considerable height. As the Ewel was in
beans last summer, it is most likely that
these seeds came from thence; but then the
distance is too considerable for them to have
been conveyed by mice. It is most proba∣ble
therefore that they were brought by
birds, and in particular by jays and pies, who
seem to have hid them among the grass
and moss, and then to have forgotten where
they had stowed them. Some pease are
growing also in the same situation, and pro∣bly
under the same circumstances.</P>

<HEAD>CUCUMBERS SET BY BEES.</HEAD>
<P>IF bees, who are much the best setters of
cucumbers, do not happen to take kindly to
the frames, the best way is to tempt them
by a little honey put on the male and fe∣male
bloom. When they are once induced
to haunt the frames, they set all the fruit, and

<HEAD>WHEAT.</HEAD>
<P>A NOTION has always obtained, that in
England hot summers are productive of fine
crops of wheat; yet in the years 1780 and
1781, though the heat was intense, the
wheat was much mildewed, and the crop
light. Does not severe heat, while the
straw is milky, occasion its juices to exsude,
which being extravasated, occasion spots,
discolour the stems and blades, and injure
the health of the plants?</P>

<HEAD>TRUFFLES.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUST. A truffle-hunter called on us,
having in his pocket several large truffles
found in this neighbourhood. He says these
<PB N="138" REF="135"/>
roots are not to be found in deep woods, but
in narrow hedge-rows and the skirts of cop∣pices.
Some truffles, he informed us, lie
two feet within the earth, and some quite on
the surface; the latter, he added, have little
or no smell, and are not so easily discovered
by the dogs as those that lie deeper. Half a
crown a pound was the price which he asked
for this commodity.</P>

<HEAD>METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>BAROMETER.</HEAD>
<P>NOVEMBER 22, 1768. A remarkable
fall of the barometer all over the kingdom.
At Selborne we had no wind, and not much
rain; only vast, swagging, rock-like clouds,
appeared at a distance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>PARTIAL FROST.</HEAD>
<P>THE country people, who are abroad in
winter mornings long before sun-rise, talk
much of hard frost in some spots, and none
in others. The reason of these partial frosts
is obvious, for there are at such times par∣tial
<PB N="141" REF="138"/>
fogs about; where the fog obtains, little
or no frost appears: but where the air is
clear, there it freezes hard. So the frost
takes place either on hill or in dale, where∣ever
the air happens to be clearest, and freest
from vapour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THAW.</HEAD>
<P>THAWS are sometimes surprisingly quick,
considering the small quantity of rain. Does
not the warmth at such times come from be∣low?
The cold in still, severe seasons seems
to come down from above: for the coming
over of a cloud in severe nights raises the
thermometer abroad at once full ten de∣grees.
The first notices of thaws often seem
to appear in vaults, cellars, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If a frost happens, even when the ground
is considerably dry, as soon as a thaw takes
<PB N="142" REF="139"/>
place, the paths and fields are all in a batter.
Country people say that the frost draws
moisture. But the true philosophy is, that
the steam and vapours continually ascending
from the earth, are bound in by the frost,
and not suffered to escape till released by the
thaw. No wonder then that the surface is
all in a float; since the quantity of moisture
by evaporation that arises daily from every
acre of ground is astonishing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FROZEN SLEET.</HEAD>
<P>JANUARY 20. Mr. H.'s man says that
he caught this day in a lane near Hackwood
park, many rooks, which, attempting to fly,
fell from the trees with their wings frozen
together by the sleet, that froze as it fell.
There were, he affirms, many dozen so dis∣abled.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="143" REF="140"/>
<HEAD>MIST, CALLED LONDON SMOKE</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a blue mist which has some∣what
the smell of coal smoke, and as it
always comes to us with a N. E. wind, is
supposed to come from London. It has a
strong smell, and is supposed to occasion
blights. When such mists appear they are
usually followed by dry weather.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>REFLECTION OF FOG.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN people walk in a deep white fog by
night with a lanthorn, if they will turn their
backs to the light, they will see their shades
impressed on the fog in rude gigantic pro∣portions.
This phenomenon seems not to
have been attended to, but implies the great
density of the meteor at that juncture.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="144" REF="141"/>
<HEAD>HONEY DEW.</HEAD>
<P>JUNE 4, 1783. Vast honey dews this
week. The reason of these seem to be, that
in hot days the effluvia of flowers are drawn
up by a brisk evaporation, and then in the
night fall down with the dews with which
they are entangled.</P>
<P>This clammy substance is very grateful to
bees, who gather it with great assiduity, but
it is injurious to the trees on which it hap∣pens
to fall, by stopping the pores of the
leaves. The greatest quantity falls in still
close weather; because winds disperse it, and
copious dews dilute it, and prevent its ill
effects. It falls mostly in hazy warm wea∣ther.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="145" REF="142"/>
<HEAD>MORNING CLOUDS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a bright night and vast dew, the sky
usually becomes cloudy by eleven or twelve
o'clock in the forenoon, and clear again to∣wards
the decline of the day. The reason
seems to be, that the dew, drawn up by eva∣poration,
occasions the clouds; which, to∣wards
evening, being no longer rendered
buoyant by the warmth of the sun, melt
away, and fall down again in dews. If clouds
are watched in a still warm evening, they
will be seen to melt away, and disappear.</P>

<HEAD>DRIPPING WEATHER AFTER

<P>No one that has not attended to such
matters, and taken down remarks, can be
aware how much ten days dripping weather

after a severe dry season. This present sum∣mer,
1776, yielded a remarkable instance;
for till the 30th of May the fields were
burnt up and naked, and the barley not half
out of the ground; but now, June 10, there

<P>DR. JOHNSON says, that "in 1771 the
season was so severe in the island of Sky,
that it is remembered by the name of the
<HI>black spring.</HI> The snow, which seldom lies
at all, covered the ground for eight weeks,
many cattle died, and those that survived
were so emaciated that they did not require
the male at the usual season." The case
was just the same with us here in the south;
never were so many barren cows known as
in the spring following that dreadful period.
Whole dairies missed being in calf together.</P>
<P>At the end of March the face of the
earth was naked to a surprising degree.
Wheat hardly to be seen, and no signs of
