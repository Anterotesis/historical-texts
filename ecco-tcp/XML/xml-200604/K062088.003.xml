<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>AT the end of a week, Celestina, with
Mrs. Elphinstone and her children, were
arrived at the small village of Kirby Thorn,
where, as the youngest of the little boys had
appeared the preceding day to droop, his
mother determined to pass the night. Ce∣lestina,
who saw her friend greatly alarmed
by the indisposition of the child, endea∣voured
to appease her fears by imputing it
to the fatigue and heat of their journey.
But the terrified mother saw every moment
new grounds for her apprehensions, and the
next day the child was evidently much
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
worse. Four and twenty hours more passed
in painful solicitude, and then Mrs. El∣phinstone
knew that it was the measles;
and became much easier, though the eldest
boy had every symptom of having taken
the same disorder.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone never left her children
a moment; and Celestina, with the ten∣derest
solicitude, assisted her. The elder
boy was of a sanguine and irritable consti∣tution,
and the eruptive fever ran high;
while the situation they were in, at a little
inn, where the servants and children of the
house had not had the distemper, was ren∣dered
extremely uncomfortable by the fears
of it's other inhabitants—the murmurs of
the landlady and the reluctance of the ser∣vants.</P>
<P>Celestina, with that cheerful benignity
which was on all occasions ready for the
service of the distressed, now acted for her
friend almost the part of a servant; and in
her frequent visits to the kitchen for what
was wanted in the sick room, she saw three
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
servents, a postillion and two footmen, and
observed that they seemed fixed there, and
were not at present travelling. The men
were remarkably well behaved, and ob∣serving
the discontent of the people of the
inn, had more than once offered to go out
for her on any messages she might have oc∣casion
to send.</P>
<P>The mind of Celestina was, however, too
much occupied by the little invalids to suf∣fer
her curiosity to be awakened by this
circumstance; and she never enquired to
whom these servants, nor a very plain but
fashionable post chaise, about which she saw
them sometimes busied, belonged. The
children were in the height of the distem∣per,
and the anxious mother and Celestina
entirely occupied about them, when a very
decent person, about fifty, who had the
look of a housekeeper to some person of
fashion, came to the door of their room,
which was left open for the sake of air, and
asking permission to come in, told them,
that her lady, Lady Horatia Howard, had
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
ordered her to wait on them to enquire if
her servants or any thing in her power
could contribute to the ease of the children,
or the ladies to whom they belonged.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone returned a proper an∣swer
to this very polite and humane mes∣sage;
and after the person who had deli∣vered
it was withdrawn, Celestina pausing
a moment, said that she recollected the
name of Lady Horatia Howard, and that
she was one of the friends most esteemed
among the numerous acquaintance culti∣vated
by Mrs. Willoughby.</P>
<P>It was now debated between them whe∣ther,
after so obliging a message, Celestina
should not make herself known to Lady
Horatia: Mrs. Elphinstone was inclined to
think she ought; but Celestina seemed ra∣ther
disposed to avoid it.—"It is true,"
said she, "that I recollect my dear Mrs.
Willoughby to have been very partial to
her, but it is probable that she has long
since forgotten me, and that I shall be ex∣posed
to the disagreeable necessity of an∣nouncing
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
myself, and recalling to her mind
circumstances▪ which I cannot remember
but with pain. Perhaps, too, she may
know the strange occurrences which have
since happened; and though I remember
her conversation to have been very refined
and elegant, perhaps she may expect, if she
honours me with her notice, that I should
prove myself worthy of it, by relating all
that has happened; for who knows in
what light the Castlenorth's may have re∣presented
my conduct. I am unequal to all
this, I fear; and unless to avail myself of
our former acquaintance will be of any use
to you, my dear Mrs. Elphinstone, I shall
not, for my own fake only, endeavour to
renew it."</P>
<P>In a few hours afterwards, however, La∣dy
Horatia, who had heard from her ser∣vant
of the fine form and amiable manners
of the young person who was so attentive to
the sick children, contrived to have a door
left open by which she must pass; and see∣ing
her, immediately knew her. On her
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
return into the room therefore, Lady Ho∣ratia
sent her woman again, with her com∣pliments,
begging to know if the name of
one of the ladies was not De Mornay, and
if it was, requesting the favour of speaking
to her.</P>
<P>Celestina could not now decline going;
and following the messenger, was shewn
into a room where Lady Horatia sat alone.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, dear Miss de Mornay,"
cried she, the moment she entered, "if
instead of waiting on you, I request to see
you here. The truth is, I am foolishly af∣fected
by the sight of illness. That which
has attacked your little friends is not howe∣ver,
I hope, dangerous?"</P>
<P>Celestina, who by the freedom and kind∣ness
of this address was immediately re∣lieved
from some little uneasiness which she
had felt from this unexpected interview,
answered with all her usual ease and grace,
and Lady Horatia, who seemed extremely
pleased with having met her, enquired after
Lady Molyneux, and such other of their
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
former friends, as she thought would renew
no unpleasing recollections: for though she
did not know all that had happened, she
was well aware how cruel a blow the death
of Mrs. Willoughby had been to Celestina,
and had heard some confused reports that
the marriage of Willoughby and Miss Fitz-Hayman
was interrupted by his prior at∣tachment
to his mother's ward; but she
knew not how far Celestina had been pre∣ferred
to the haughty heiress; and though
she had always a partial kindness to her
when she used to meet her at Mrs. Wil∣loughby's,
she had lost fight of her en∣tirely
afterwards, and, after some enqui∣ries,
concluded she was gone back to
France.</P>
<P>The sight of her now, at a remote inn
in the North, was as agreeable as it was
unexpected; and though the difference of
their ages seemed to preclude any great de∣gree
of intimacy before, for Lady Horatia
was passed the middle of life, yet now she
felt herself strongly disposed to cultivate a
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
pleasure thus thrown in her way. Celestina
could not be insensible of the honour she
derived from the notice of a person more
eminent for her goodness and her talents
than her birth or her fortune, and always
pleasing, she grew infinitely more so where
she desired to please. In a few hours, there∣fore,
they became so happy with each
other, that Lady Horatia could not part
with her but with regret; and Celestina
would have left her with reluctance on any
other occasion than to attend the children
of her friend, (which, during her absence,
Mrs. Hemmings, Lady Horatia's woman,
had done, with an attention that prevented
Mrs. Elphinstone's suffering from the en∣gagement
of Celestina with her lady.)</P>
<P>The children became better and their
mother easier. Lady Horatia saw and liked
her, and invited both her and Celestina to
give her as much of their time as they
could spare from their little convalescents.
In consequence of this invitation they were
now a good deal with her, and Mrs. El∣phinstone
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
on some occasion expressing how
fortunate she thought herself that in so re∣mote
a place she had the honour of be∣coming
known to her, Lady Horatia said,
smiling,—"And I dare say you think it
very extraordinary too, my dear Madam;
for unless you had known me before it
would be difficult to account for my being
here. Did you never remark that unhap∣piness
makes people restless?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes! very often," replied Mrs.
Elphinstone with a sigh.</P>
<P>"It has had that effect on me," said
Lady Horatia; and satiated with every
thing in what is called the world, where I
have passed the greater part of my life, I
often leave it and ramble about, careless
of every thing but change of place; my
old faithful servants and a few books being
the sole companions of my travels. I have
for these last four or five years given up
my house in the country, and passed all
the summer in wandering about Switzer∣land,
France, and England. This year
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
I am going into Scotland, for no other
reason than because I have not been there
before: at this village one of my horses
fell lame; and as it was indifferent to me
where I was, I agreed to my servant's re∣quest
of staying here a day or two. While
I waited, you arrived here, and I own very
sincerely that I became interested for the
children and for the ladies, such as Hem∣mings
described them to me. I hope we
shall none, of us be sorry for the accidents
that detained us here, when the little boys
are quite well, as I am persuaded they will
be now in a few days. They will have
passed happily through a very troublesome
distemper, and I think you will each of
you have added a friend to your stock:
the advantage, however, will be still more
evidently mine, for I hope to have added
two."</P>
<P>A few days confirmed the good opinion
which Lady Horatia entertained of her
new acquaintance and her acquaintance of
her. If she was particularly attached to
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Celestina, it was because she was young
enough to be her daughter, and because
she told her that she could not look at her,
especially when she was reading or em∣ployed
in any thing that gave a serious cast
to her features, without remarking her
likeness to a person she had once fondly
loved.</P>
<P>Celestina, whose thoughts were perpetu∣ally
fixed on the strange mystery which
hung over her birth, and who caught at
every thing likely to clear it up, blushed
deeply the first time she made this remark,
and asked whether this person was a fo∣reigner?</P>
<P>Lady Horatia sighed in her turn, and
said, no! it was a brother of hers, who
had not been long dead. "He was a
soldier," said she, "and lost his life in
America, in that war which tore it from the
British empire. Judge yourself of the like∣ness,
though I well know it must be acci∣dental."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
She then took out of a travelling trunk a
little filligreed casket, in which were se∣veral
valuable trinkets and several pictures.
Three were the portraits of gentlemen.—"Come,"
said Lady Horatia, "to prove
whether this resemblance is merely a chi∣mera
of mine, let us ask Mrs. Elphinstone
if among these pictures she sees one which
is like any body she knows; for my dear
Miss de Mornay, do you know this simi∣litude
of countenance struck me when you
were a child with Mrs. Willoughby; and
now that your features are more formed, it
is, in my mind, wonderfully strong. But,
my sweet friend, why do you appear so
uneasy?"</P>
<P>"I cannot very well tell," replied Ce∣lestina,
trying to force a smile: "I am sure
to bear a resemblance to any body dear to
your Ladyship must be ever pleasing to
me, though I well know that it must be,
as you observe, quite accidental."</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone then coming in, Lady
Horatia shewed her the three portraits:—
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
"Come tell us, Mrs. Elphinstone, if you
know any living friend whom either of these
portraits resembles?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone took them, and looked
steadily a moment on each; then fixing on
one, she looked more intently, first on
that and then on Celestina. "Indeed I
think I do," cried she: "I surely see a
resemblance—a very strong resemblance,
between this picture and Miss de Mornay.
Bless me, how very like! the shape of the
face, the mouth, the dark-brown eyebrow,
the colour of the eyes, the setting on of the
hair round the forehead and temples; ex∣cept
that it is less fair, that the features are
proportionably larger, and that you wear
a cap, in truth, my dear friend, it might
have been drawn for you."</P>
<P>"And yet," said Lady Horatia, smil∣ing
mournfully, "this was drawn for a
brother of mine, who could, I fear, be no
relation to our lovely friend here: so
strangely it happens that features coincide."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
"It is fortunate, very fortunate for me,
Madam," said Celestina gravely, "if this
resemblance has had the effect of prejudic∣ing
your Ladyship in my favour."</P>
<P>"You have merit enough to justify it,
though I had conceived an affection for
you without any introduction. But we will
talk no more of resemblances, if such dis∣course
makes us melancholy."</P>
<P>Lady Horatia then turned the conversa∣tion;
and the next day, as the two little
boys were by this time well enough to con∣tinue
their journey, they moved on about
twenty miles together; Lady Horatia beg∣ging
for that day to have Celestina with
her, while her woman went with Mrs. El∣phinstone,
to assist in the care of her chil∣dren.</P>
<P>Celestina, who knew only in general
that Lady Horatia was a widow of very
affluent fortune, who gave up much of
her time to literary pursuits and literary con∣nections,
and much of her fortune to the
assistance of the unhappy, now learned
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
that domestic misfortunes had contributed,
with her natural turn of mind, to estrange
her entirely from those scenes where Celes∣tina
had sometimes formerly seen her; and
that having lost an only daughter, (the last
of her children,) of a deep decline, she now
tried to call off her mind from the subjects
of her mournful contemplations by change
of place, and had never, since that period,
resided long at any of her own houses, but
had passed almost the whole year in tra∣velling;
stopping wherever she found a
pleasant spot, and often remaining several
days, or even weeks, at some remote house.
She had once or twice, she said, engaged
friends to go with her on these expeditions,
but had always found the difficulties they
made so much counterbalance the pleasure
they were capable of affording her, that
she now travelled alone. "Some," said
she, "were tired, and some were tasteless;
some were talkative and some were insipid.
You will certainly think me fastidious;
and perhaps I am so; but indeed it is
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
more difficult to find such a companion as
suits me in every respect, than appears at
first view. Women of my own age, who
are established in the world, cannot of
course leave their families and connections;
those who are not, are for the most part
unhappy from pecuniary or family distresses,
and the mind, depressed at that period of
life, has lost it's power of resistance, and
sinks in that hopeless languor from which
I often want to be myself relieved by cheer∣ful
conversation. The young do not tra∣vel
for prospects, or enjoy cataracts and
mountains: they are looking out for lo∣vers;
and are wearied when there are nei∣ther
men to talk to or adventures to be
hoped for. I have tried two or three young
ladies; and found, that as we had no ideas
in common, our conversation was soon ex∣hausted;
and when I was near any place
of summer resort, or passed through a town
at the time of a race or a music meeting,
their hearts were beating to enter into scenes
which I was only solicitous to fly from.
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Do you know, however, that if I had not
met you absolutely engaged on this Scottish
journey, I should have been strongly
tempted to enquire whether you would al∣low
me to make the experiment once more,
where I am strongly impressed with an idea
that I should meet with better success."</P>
<P>Celestina answered, that her good opi∣nion
did her the utmost honour: and by
degrees the tender and maternal solicitude
Lady Horatia expressed for her, drew from
her the little narrative of her life. Lady
Horatia expressed the greatest aversion to
Lady Castlenorth. "It is true," said she,
"I do hot know her much from my own
observation; for she is a woman whose,
conversation I have always disliked and
avoided; but from some anecdotes of her
that have been related to me by those who
know her well, I believe it may with truth
be said of her, as was said of a celebrated
political character, that she has "a heart
to imagine, a head to contrive, and a hand
to execute any mischief." Willoughby
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
is young, open-hearted, and artless: by no
means likely to suspect, or likely to detect
artifice so deep as what she is capable of;
and I am well convinced that there are no
contrivances at which she would hesitate,
either to carry a favourite point or avenge
it's failure."</P>
<P>Celestina was extremely comforted by
this opinion given by so good a judge.
Every other sorrow was comparatively light
to that which she felt from the idea, when∣ever
it forced itself upon her mind, that
Willoughby had, through ambition, or ca∣price,
or avarice, voluntarily deserted her;
and every opinion that strengthened her
own hopes of his unaltered affection, and
imputed his leaving her to the evil machi∣nations
of the Castlenorths, was soothing
and consolatory.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia Howard was now travel∣ling
towards Edinburgh, and made the
time of Mrs. Elphinstone her own, for
the pleasure she derived from her company,
and still more from that of Celestina, to
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
whom, during this journey, she became so
much attached, that she made her promise
to come to her whenever the abode she was
now going to should be inconvenient, or
whenever she was under the necessity of
changing it. An invitation so flattering
was gratefully accepted; and Lady Ho∣ratia
having shewn both her travelling
friends every polite and generous attention,
took leave of them with regret on their
leaving Edinburgh with Elphinstone, who
was there waiting for them. She gave Ce∣lestina
directions whither to write to her for
the remainder of the summer, and again
made her promise to come to her in the
winter, if she left her Scottish friends; and
at all events to contrive to pass with her
two or three months of the next summer.
After taking leave of her, a very tedious
and very dreary journey of many days
brought the Elphinstone's and Celestina to
the sea side, where they were to embark for
the Isle of Skie. Mrs. Elphinstone, ac∣customed
to see so many different countries,
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
was yet struck with dismay at the sight of
the black and dreary heaths over which
they travelled; and in spite of all her at∣tempts
to sustain her courage, she looked
at her children with eyes where maternal
anguish was too visibly expressed. Elphin∣stone,
however, to whom novelty had al∣ways
charms, was not yet weary of his si∣tuation,
and he was as gay and unconcerned
as if he had been leading his wife to the
most beautiful estate in England. Celestina,
though very little delighted with the coun∣try
they had passed through, was deter∣mined
to testify no dislike to it that might
add to the painful dejection of her friend,
and by making light of the inconveniencies
of the journey, and putting their hopes and
prospects in the fairest light, she supported
her drooping spirits, which the thoughtless
and somewhat unfeeling vivacity of El∣phinstone
himself, served rather to depress
than to support.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>ARRIVED at their insular abode after
great fatigue, Mrs. Elphinstone, recalling
all her fortitude, busied herself in making
it as comfortable as she could; and assumed,
at least, the appearance of cheerfulness,
though Celestina saw with concern that it
was often <HI>but</HI> appearance. Celestina her∣self,
however, whose mind had too long
been unpleasingly called off from that ob∣ject
on which she best loved to fix it, was
far from being displeased by the perfect
seclusion of the place. She could now
wander whole days alone, amid the wild
solitude in which she found herself, listen∣ing
only to the rush of the cataract, which,
dashing through broken stones, sparkled
amid the dark heath on either side of it;
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
or the sullen waves of the ocean itself,
which on all sides, surrounded her. The
ptarmigan,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A bird of the grous kind, common in the high∣lands of Scotland.</NOTE> bursting from it's heathy co∣vert,
or the sea fowl screeming from the
rocks, were the only sounds that broke
these murmurs; but she found her spirits
soothed by the wildness of the places she
visited; and far from regretting the more
cultivated scenes she had left, she rejoiced
that since she no longer could hope to see
Willoughby, she was released from the
necessity of attending to any other person.</P>
<P>The immense distance that was now be∣tween
them, she sometimes considered with
dismay; but at others she remembered—
<Q>That distance only, cannot change the heart.</Q></P>
<P>She trusted on the long tried, the long
assured tenderness of her lover, and was
willing to indulge the soothing hope that
they should meet again to be separated no
more, and that he was labouring to remove
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
the fatal obstacle, whatever it was, that
now divided them.</P>
<P>After having been above five weeks on
the island, a large pacquet arrived from
Cathcart. It enclosed, among many to
his sister, one to Celestina from Willough∣by;
and this, more than any she had yet
received from him since his absence, seemed
to assure her of his unfailing attachment.
It was less confused than those he had for∣merly
written, and seemed the production
of a mind more master of itself: and,
though it did not speak in positive terms
of his immediate return, Celestina fancied
that many of the expressions alluded to
that hour; and her heart found this idea
so deliciously soothing, that she would not
suffer her reason to deprive her of any part
of the pleasure she found in indulging it.</P>
<P>A few of the residents of this and the
neighbouring islands were by this time ac∣quainted
at the house of Mr. Elphinstone.
The young, (and of young people their
visitors principally consisted,) were all
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
charmed with Celestina, who, whatever
was her inclination for solitude, never re∣fused
to make one in the ramble of the
morning, or to join the cheerful dance of
an evening. Elphinstone, naturally good
humoured, and particularly desirous of
pleasing her, soon became anxious to pro∣mote
these parties, which Celestina, whose
heart was opened to new sensations of plea∣sure
since the receipt of Willoughby's last
letter, did not decline; not only because
she found much in these remote regions to
gratify her curiosity, but because she foresaw
that, from the shortness.of the summer so
far North, the days when these amusements
were practicable were drawing to their con∣clusion,
and that she soon should be left
unmolested, to listen to the roaring of the
waters, and the sighings of the wind round
the naked rocks, against which it inces∣santly
beat.</P>
<P>It was now the end of July, and Celes∣tina
had already visited Jona and several
other islands. Sometimes these excursions
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
had been made with Mrs. Elphinstone,
but oftener without her. Elphinstone kept
a boat, which was always ready for the
service of Celestina, and when his wife
could not go with her, a Miss Macqueen,
a very agreeable young highland lady, al∣ways
made the third.</P>
<P>Several little isles, which afford no habi∣tations
for winter, are scattered among the
larger islands, which are called the Hebri∣des.
One of these lay within sight of El∣phinstone's
house, (which was close to the
shore,) at the distance of about a mile and
a half. It was remarkable for the grotesque
form of the cliffs which arose round it, and
for a stream of the purest water, that bub∣bled
up at the highest ground, and fell
into the sea through a chasm of the rock.
Celestina, to whom Elphinstone had shewn
it, laughingly called it her island; and he,
in return, had said that were she established
on it, it would become more dangerous
than the island of Calypso. Among other
little plans of amusement, which the decline
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
of summer insensibly rendered more fre∣quent,
it was agreed that on the first fine
day some cold provisions should be taken,
and that they would all dine together on
one of the natural stone tables in Celestina's
island.</P>
<P>A fine day was found; the party, which
were Mr. and Mrs. Elphinstone, Miss
Macqueen, and two gentlemen, were
ready, when one of the boatmen who usu∣ally
accompanied them was no where to
be found. Elphinstone, equally impatient
and eager, whatever was the importance or
insignificance of the matter he was engaged
in, was going himself in search of the miss∣ing
man, when one of those who remained
in the boat followed and told him that
there was a young man a few yards farther
on the shore, who would take the place of
him that was absent, and that it was better
not to wait: Elphinstone, satisfied so long
as his party was not interrupted, accepted
the offer, and the boatman beckoning to a
highlander who stood at some distance, he
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
ran towards them and was admitted into
the boat.</P>
<P>The party now put off from shore. The
water was beautifully smooth, the sky
clear, and the wind in their favour; very
little exertion therefore on the part of the
men who were entrusted with the naviga∣tion,
landed them safely on the ilk. It
did not contain more than three acres of
land, and the sole inhabitant of it was a
solitary herdsman, whose temporary dwel∣ling,
composed of loose stones, turf, and
heath, he had raised under the protection
of a large cliff of grey slate, that seemed
to have started away, in some strange con∣cussion
of nature, from some other island,
and to have fixed itself as a sea mark
amidst the perpendicular and abrupt rocks
that fenced this on every side. The spring
burst out near it's base, and here the party
sat down to make their gay repast.</P>
<P>When it was over, the gentlemen went
away; and while the boatmen were at
dinner, pushed out the boat themselves
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
and began to fish near the shore, while
Celestina, leaving the ladies together,
walked away alone to the western coast of
the island.</P>
<P>The sun was already declining in an
almost cloudless sky, and gave the warm∣est
splendour to the broad expanse of
ocean, broken by several islands, whose
rocky points and angular cliffs caught the
strong lights, in brilliant contrast to the
lucid hue of the heath with which their
summits were cloathed, and which on the
northern and eastern sides threw a dark
shadow on the clear and tranquil bosom
of the sea. The sea birds, in swarming
myriads, were returning to their nests
among the ragged precipices beneath her;
and Celestina, recalling to her mind the
"green delights" of Alvestone,
<Q>It's deepening woods, gay lawns, and airy summits,</Q>
compared it, in pensive contemplation,
with the scene before her; yet different as
they were, she thought that with Wil∣loughby
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
any place would be to her a para∣dise;
and that even in such a remote spot
as this she should be happy if it gave only
a subsistence with him.</P>
<P>This train of thought a little indulged,
made her have recourse to her pencil, and
produced an address to him in the follow∣ing</P>

<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
The broad orb of the sun was now only
half seen above the horizon; and Celestina,
who had little marked the progress of
time, rose, and hastened to join her com∣panions;
as she turned for this purpose
towards that part of the island where she
had left them, she saw the highlander,
who had been taken by chance into the
boat in consequence of the absence of ano∣ther,
start up from the ground at about
two hundred paces from her, where he
seemed to have been concealed behind a
cairn or pile of rude stones, and hurry
away towards the part of the shore where
the boat had been left. The incident
however made no great impression on her
mind, but from the singular appearance
of the man, who was in a complete high∣land
dress, which is now not often seen,
and which made him, as he walked very
quickly on before her, seem exactly the
figure a painter would have chosen to have
placed in a landscape, representing the
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
heathy summits and romantic rocks of the
Hebrides.</P>
<P>She soon rejoined Mrs. Elphinstone and
Miss Macqueen. The three gentlemen
almost as soon approached to tell them it
was time to return; and they arrived again
at their home after a little excursion with
which all seemed pleased, though Celes∣tina
had suffered some raillery for having
so long deserted them.</P>
<P>Every day now passed nearly alike, di∣versified
only now and then by the com∣pany
of a stranger from some of the other
islands, and sometimes a party in the boat.
Elphinstone was not yet tired by the pro∣ject
which brought him hither, for to use
an expression of his wife's, which she ut∣tered
with a melancholy smile to Celestina,
"the new was not yet off." He was there∣fore
gay and alert; persuaded himself, by
calculations, which he made after his own
sanguine manner, that he was not only a
benefactor to the public, but should in a
few years realize a great fortune by facili∣tating
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
the capture of herrings among the
western islands of Scotland.</P>
<P>The season for the proof of his exploits
in this way was now rapidly approaching,
and he became every day more busy: but
his wife looked forward to it with less
pleasure: she languished for her little
girls, who were at the other extremity of
England, and thought with dismay of the
tempests of winter, which would shut her
out from the little communication she yet
had with that country. But whatever was
her regret, she suffered it not to disturb
the transient happiness her husband seemed
to enjoy, nor to communicate any gloom
to the milder cheerfulness of Celestina,
whose company was her greatest resource
against that cold despondence, which, in
despite of all her fortitude, sometimes
seized on her heart.</P>
<P>Celestina had now been almost three
months an inhabitant of the Isle of Skie,
and felt nothing unpleasant in her insu∣lar
situation but the length of time that
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
must always elapse before she could hear
from Willoughby or even from Cathcart.
A second packet was however brought to
Mrs. Elphinstone from the latter before the
expiration of the eleventh week of their
abode. With eager impatience it was
opened. Celestina received her part of it
with a beating heart; but on unsealing it
found no letter from Willoughby. A
letter, in a hand which she did not at the
moment recollect ever to have seen be∣fore,
attracted her attention and mingled
it with something of terror. She looked
eagerly at the name, and saw it signed
with that of the elder Mr. Thorold. Her
spirits sunk! was it some ill news of Wil∣loughby,
which he communicated that he
might soften the blow? She hurried it
over in such breathless agitation as hardly
gave her leave to understand what she read,
which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Your old friend, amiable Celestina,
though he has only had one letter from
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
you since you left him, reminds you
of himself once more, and is sorry that,
like every thing in this world, his letter
will convey to you a mixture of pleasure
and pain.</P>
<P>My daughter Arabella is married, to
her own wishes and those of her mo∣ther.
In point of fortune she has done
well. We cannot here obtain every
thing. I hope she will be happy, and
am sure she will be rich, which, in the
opinion of most fathers, you know, puts
the former point out of doubt. You
will guess that Mr. Bettenson is the
gentleman who is now numbered with
my family. My wife has been gone
with the new married couple some
weeks to the seat of Mr. Bettenson's fa∣ther
in Norfolk.</P>
<P>You know I love home; and I love
that those who are less delighted with
it should not be needlessly disturbed
when they are out; for which reason I
have never communicated to his mo∣ther,
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
that Montague, after attending
his sister's wedding here, did not return
to Oxford as he talked of doing; that
I know not whither he is gone, and
have only had one letter from him since,
in which he assures me he is well, and
desires I would not be uneasy about him.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to be otherwise.
This eccentric young man makes me
tremble for him perpetually. Having
no clue to direct my guesses, I have no
conjecture where or with whom he is;
and think it better to say as little as I
can about an absence on which a thou∣sand
unfavourable constructions may be
put. Ah! my lovely ward, how fortu∣nate
it would have been, if, when his
judgment directed his heart, it could
have been accepted where—but this is
wrong, or at best useless. Farewel!
May heaven protect you! and I pray
you not to forget</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your most faithful friend, E. THOROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Relieved from her first apprehensions,
Celestina felt extremely concerned at the
absence of Montague Thorold; so painful
to his father, perhaps so discreditable to
himself. She read over the letter again,
and fancied it very evident that Mr. Tho∣rold
imputed it to some new attachment;
and giving a sigh to the recollection of all
it must cost such a father to see such an
unfortunate turn of mind blast all the ac∣quirements
of learning, and all the advan∣tages
of genius, she turned her thoughts
to Willoughby, and felt with renewed
poignancy the disappointment of not hav∣ing
heard from him.</P>
<P>Another and another week passed with∣out
any intelligence, and all the soothing
hopes Celestina had so fondly encouraged
gradually gave way to fear and apprehen∣sion.
At length a second packet arrived:
it contained a letter indeed from Wil∣loughby;
but so far was it from confirm∣ing
the favourable presages of the former,
that she saw in it only a prelude to the
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
event which other information made her
believe would soon happen—the marriage
of Willoughby and Miss Fitz-Hayman.
Lady Horatia Howard, whose-attachment
to Celestina had taken very deep root,
had written to her from London, whither
she was now gone, and had told her, with
as much tenderness as she could, that such
was the general report among the relations
of the family, and what was generally be
lieved in the world. From the same
channel she also learned that Sir Philip
and Lady Molyneux were expected in
England early in the ensuing winter, and
that a large house in Portman-square was
fitting up in the most splendid stile for their
reception.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia concluded a most friendly
letter to Celestina thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>But my dear Miss De Mornay, how∣ever
all these things may be, let me
hope that you will not hide yourself in
the Hebrides all the winter: why should
you? Talents and virtues like your's
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
were never intended for obscurity.
Come then to me, and assure yourself
of the truest welcome. You need not
apprehend meeting Mr. Willoughby
and his bride, for it is understood that
they are to remain some time abroad;
and before they return to England,
you will have learned to conquer those
painful emotions which the sight of
them now perhaps might give you.
<HI>Your</HI> understanding sets you above the
puerile indulgence which inferior minds
claim by prescription towards a first
love. The man whom any common
consideration could induce, after hav∣ing
won your affections, to desert you,
never could deserve you; and if some
insurmountable barrier is between you,
you will learn to consider him as a
friend, and consult his peace in regain∣ing
that cheerfulness which he meant
not to destroy; but which to see de∣stroyed,
must overcloud his days, how∣ever
prosperous they may otherwise be.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
There was in this letter more meant
than was expressed; and on considering
it, the wonder and uneasiness of Celestina
were redoubled. But however obliged she
thought herself by the friendly interest
Lady Horatia took in her happiness, and
however just her arguments might be, she
felt no inclination to quit her present soli∣tude;
and since she had now less hope
than ever of meeting Willoughby, she
had less than ever a desire to return into
the world, but gave herself up to that
melancholy despondence, against which
hope, and her own sanguine and cheerful
temper, had till now supported her.</P>
<P>To indulge this encreasing sadness, it
was now her custom to walk out alone af∣ter
dinner, and to make for herself a spe∣cies
of gloomy enjoyment from the dreary
and wild scenes around her. A little time
before, she had been imagining how plea∣sant
the most desolate of these barren islands
might be rendered to her by the presence
of her beloved Willoughby. She now ra∣ther
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
sought images of horror. The sun,
far distant from this northern region, was
as faint and languid as the sick thoughts
of Celestina: his feeble rays no longer
gave any warm colouring to the rugged
cliffs that rose above her head, or lent the
undulating sea that sparkling brilliance
which a few weeks before had given gaiety
and cheerfulness even to these scattered
masses of almost naked stone, against which
the water incessantly broke. Grey, sullen,
and cold, the waves now slowly rolled to∣wards
the shore, where Celestina fre∣quently
sat whole hours, as if to count
them, when she had in reality no idea pre∣sent
to her but Willoughby lost to her for
ever—Willoughby forgetting her, and mar∣ried
to Miss Fitz-Hayman!</P>
<P>She had more than once remarked, in
returning from her walks, that a man,
who kept always at such a distance that
she could merely discover to be a high∣lander,
seemed to be observing her; yet
as he never came near her, and always
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
disappeared before she got near the house,
she could not imagine him to be one of
the people belonging to Elphinstone: but
puzzled rather than alarmed by his ap∣pearance,
for which she could not account,
she insensibly ceased to notice him. Mrs.
Elphinstone, occupied as she was by her
own domestic uneasiness, was still most
tenderly attentive to Celestina, and endea∣voured
to communicate to her some of that
still and mournful acquiescence which
served her in place of philosophy. Ce∣lestina
had not yet suffered enough to learn
it; but she forbore to add to the melan∣choly
of her friend by indulging her own
while they were together; and this re∣straint
threw her more than ever into entire
solitude, though the autumn was so far ad∣vanced
that the weather frequently drove
her from the open hill, or the vale under
it, to the casual shelter of some natural
cave, by the side of which, the torrent, en∣creased
by the storm, hoarsely rushed, and
was answered by the roar of other streams,
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
whose hollow murmurs swelled in the gusts
of wind that whistled through the moun∣tainous
tracks, and compelled even the
fowls of the desart to seek shelter, where
only it was afforded, within the caverns
of the cliffs, or among the matted heath
that cloathed their summits.</P>
<P>The delicate, the elegant, the lovely
Celestina, she whose talents would have
adorned the most informed society, and
whose beauty might have given new lustre
to the fairest assembly, was thus a self∣banished
recluse in the remotest and most
uncultivated part of the British dominions.
Her wish now was, to pass her whole life
here, in that sullen calm which she at length
hoped to obtain; and the rudest scene of
these islands now appeared to her infinitely
preferable to any of the pleasures Lady
Horatia Howard offered her, since <HI>they</HI>
could only serve to remind her of Wil∣loughby;
perhaps to shew her how happy
he could learn to be, united with another.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45"/>
The frequency of storms now prevented
many of those visits which had, during
summer, a little broken, for Elphinstone,
the uniformity of solitude; but it was the
height of the season for catching herrings,
and he was busy, and for the present hap∣py;
while his unfortunate wife, who, de∣solate
as her present situation was, yet
dreaded the hour when this bustle should
sink into discontent and give place to other
projects, received him on his return from
those expeditions to other islands, in which
he was now frequently engaged, always
with cheerfulness, which he did not, or
would not see, was forced; and sometimes
with smiles, which to every body but him
very evidently were the smiles of stifled an∣guish.</P>
<P>Celestina answered Lady Horatia's letter
as it deserved, but to Willoughby she de∣termined
not to write. That trembling
solicitude with which she had been accus∣tomed
to expect letters from him, it was
now, she thought, time to subdue, for she
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
persuaded herself that never again they
would bring to her any thing but anguish
and regret: and yet by those contradict∣ing
sensations to which violent attachments
subject the human heart, she incessantly
indulged herself in thinking of all those
happy hours which she had passed with
him, whom she fancied deserved little or
no regret, of whom she ought not to think
at all, and yet was so fond of recollecting,
that every conversation was irksome to
her, and every employment a task, which
took off her attention a moment from him.</P>
<Q>Ti perdo! ti lascio, non ti vedro piu—</Q>
<P>she repeated incessantly to herself, some∣times
with tears of tenderness, and some∣times
with those painful emotions of min∣gled
anger and regret which press on the
heart when pride and resentment are strug∣gling
with affection. In other moods she
reproached herself for thus cherishing this
unhappy passion, tried to recal those days
of resignation when, without hope of ever
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
being his, she yet preferred Willoughby to
all mankind; and to dismiss from her mind
for ever the recollection of the few weeks
when he had awakened that hope, and
called forth all her sensibility only as it
should seem to render her wretched; then
she exclaimed in her native language—
<Q><L>Felicité passée</L>
<L>Qui ne peut revenir</L>
<L>Tourment de ma pensée</L>
<L>Que n'ai je en te perdant, perdu le souvenir.</L></Q></P>
<P>In these gloomy moods, she was quite
unable to remain a moment in company,
especially in the company of Elphinstone,
who, with the true projecter's infatuation,
fancied every body else as much interested
about the fishery as he was; and persecuted
her with details of how many <HI>busses</HI> he had
out and how many <HI>lasts</HI> they had taken;
what was the best method of curing them,
and of the superiority which a few years
would give the fishery in which he was en∣gaged,
over the Dutch.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
Celestina began to dread the conversa∣tion;
and had it not been for Mrs. El∣phinstone,
of whose suffering merit she
was every hour more sensible, she would
not have forborne to express her weariness
and disgust. A hearer was necessary to
Elphinstone; and when he had' nobody
else to talk to, this unenviable place was
filled by the inwardly-impatient Celestina.</P>
<P>It happened, however, that she was re∣leased
from this for some days. Towards
the end of November, Elphinstone went
to the Isle of Harries, on his business, as
he fancied, and the wind being against his
return, she no longer listened. to the me∣thod
of curing herrings, but returned to
her shortened but less interrupted walks.
In one of these, towards the close of a very
lowering and cheerless day, when her way
was along the rugged cliffs that, on the
western side of the island, hung over the
sea, she composed the following sonnet:</P>
<Q><LG>
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
<HEAD>THE PILGRIM.</HEAD>
<L>Faultering and sad, the unhappy pilgrim roves,</L>
<L>Who, on the eve of bleak December's night,</L>
<L>Divided far from all he fondly loves,</L>
<L>Journeys alone, along the giddy height</L>
<L>Of these steep cliffs, and as the sun's last ray</L>
<L>Fades in the West, sees, from the rocky verge,</L>
<L>Dark tempest scowling o'er the shorten'd day,</L>
<L>And hears, with ear appall'd, the impetuous surge</L>
<L>Beneath him thunder!—So, with heart opprest,</L>
<L>Alone, reluctant, desolate, and slow,</L>
<L>By friendship's cheering radiance <HI>now</HI> unblest,</L>
<L>Along life's rudest path I seem to go;</L>
<L>Nor see where yet the anxious heart may rest,</L>
<L>That trembling at the past—recoils from future woe!</L>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>ELPHINSTONE had now been
absent some days, and the wind, which
was contrary and violent, prevented his
return to the place of his abode. Mrs.
Elphinstone became uneasy at the storms
which detained him, and Celestina parti∣cipated
in her anxiety. At length the
wind sunk, and, towards the evening of
the fifth day of his absence, was fair to
bring him from Herries. Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
who had been a good deal alarmed
by the hurricanes of several preceding
days, and had wearied her spirits by watch∣ing
the weather and. keeping an anxious
eye towards the impracticable sea, found
herself indisposed and shivering; and
telling Celestina that she believed she had
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
caught cold, she went early to bed, re∣marking,
as she bade her good night, that
Elphinstone would probably be at home
in the morning.</P>
<P>Celestina, left alone, went out as was
her custom, even although the evening
was already closed in; and standing on
the edge of the rocks, near the house, re∣marked
the singular appearance of the
moon, which was now rising. It was
large, and of a dull red, surrounded by
clouds of a deep purple, whose skirts
seemed touched with flame. Large vo∣lumes
of heavy vapour were gathering in
the sky, and the heaving surges swelled
towards the shore, and broke upon it with
that sullen regularity that foretels a storm.
From the North, arose distinctly the pointed
rays of the Aurora Borealis: fiery and
portentous, they seemed to flash like faint
lightning a little while, till the moon be∣coming
clearer, rendered them less visible.</P>
<P>Not a sound was heard but the dull
murmurs of the sea on one side and the
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
rapid waterfalls on the other, whose en∣creased
noise foretold with equal certainty
an approaching tempest. Celestina, who
was in that disposition of mind to which
horrors are congenial, walked slowly on
notwithstanding; but quitting the cliffs,
on account of the gales of wind which now
blew from the sea, she went along a narrow
pass, where there was a cairn or heap of
stones loosely piled together, the work of
the first wild natives of the country; and
as that was as far as she thought it proper
to venture from the house, though it was
not more than eight o'clock, she leaned
pensively against it, and watched with some
surprise the fluctuations of the clouds that
were wildly driven by the wind across the
disk of the moon, and listened with a kind
of chill awe, to the loud yet hollow echo
of the wind among the hills; which some∣times
sobbed with stormy violence for a
moment, and then suddenly sinking, was
succeeded by a pause more terrible.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
It was in one of these moments of alarm∣ing
silence, that Celestina thought she saw
the shadow of a human form for a moment
on the ground, as if the person was behind
her who occasioned it. She was very little
subject to fear; but the loneliness of the
place, and her own desponding spirits to∣gether,
made her start with terror and turn
round. Something immediately glided
away; and convinced that the first im∣pression
had not been the work of fancy,
she hastened with quick steps from the
place, and hardly at the distance of above
a hundred yards, ventured to look behind
her. She fancied that she saw a man
standing in the place she had left; and the
strange superstitions of the islands, of
which she had heard much since her resid∣ing
on them, crowding at that moment on
her mind, she became extremely terrified,
and hurried on with such unguarded speed,
that a little before she reached the house
she trod on a loose stone, that turned under
her foot, and she fell with some violence
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
and with considerable pain; which, toge∣ther
with the fear she had before felt, pro∣duced
a momentary stupor, from which
she was awakened by finding herself eagerly
raised from the ground by some person,
who wildly expressed his fears for her
safety, and in whose voice she recognized,
with astonishment that deprived her of ut∣terance,
Montague Thorold. Surprize at
that moment conquered the pain she felt:
"Oh! Mr. Montague!" cried she, "is
it possible? For heaven's sake what
brought you hither?"</P>
<P>"No matter what," replied he eagerly:
"think not—ask not about me!—when
you are yourself hurt—in pain—bruised, I
fear, by your fall!"</P>
<P>"I have no hurt so great," said Celes∣tina,
rising and attempting to walk: "I feel
no bodily pain so acute, as that which your
extraordinary conduct gives me."</P>
<P>"Let me assist you into the house," in∣terrupted
he. "Do you not see that the
tempest, which has been gathering the
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
whole evening in the south-west, is now
driving hither with uncommon fury?"</P>
<P>"And let it come," answered she lan∣guidly:
"I am just now so very unhappy
myself—I feel so much for the unhappiness
of my friends, particularly of your father,
that it is indifferent to me what comes."</P>
<P>"It is not for <HI>me,</HI> at least, that you
feel," answered he: "that I know but
too well: but undoubtedly you will be
greatly concerned for poor Elphinstone,
whose boat has been beating about ever
since night-fall, within a mile of the shore,
at the imminent hazard of being dashed to
pieces."</P>
<P>At this information Celestina forgot her∣self,
forgot the uneasy astonishment into
which the unexpected presence of Monta∣gue
Thorold had thrown her, and the
danger of Elphinstone occupied all her
thoughts. "Oh! where!" cried she,
"where is he? Shew me the bark which
is in so much hazard, and for heaven's
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
sake call the people, who are not, perhaps,
aware of it's danger."</P>
<P>"Alas!" answered he, "several men
have been upon the shore above half an
hour, alarmed, as I was, at the danger the
vessel was in of striking on the rocks, which
she has got among from the unexpected
shifting of the wind; but in their present
state no human assistance can do them any
service."</P>
<P>He had, during this dialogue, taken her
arm, and led her towards a point of the
rock, where she saw, by the pale and uncer∣tain
light of a moon, wrapped continually
in volumes of clouds, the boat struggling
among the dark heavy waves which often
totally concealed it, and continually driven
by the sudden gusts of violent wind from
the point it was attempting to reach.</P>
<P>She now saw and shuddered at the peril
of those who were in it: but still fancying
it was possible to afford them assistance,
she felt impatient and almost angry that
Montague Thorold, holding her arm
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
within his, stood gazing when she fancied
he might be helping. "Why stand here,"
cried she, "when we might be of use in
summoning people to the assistance of those
poor creatures?" While she yet spoke,
and while Montague, though not less alive
to their distress, was less sanguine in the
hope to assist them, and therefore still hesitated,
she disengaged herself hastily from
his arm, and flew towards the house, no
longer conscious of any thing but their
danger: before she could reach it, though
the distance was not a quarter of a mile, the
wind suddenly blew with treble fury, and
a hail storm accompanied it, against which
she found it difficult to stand. She found the
door open, and Mrs. Elphinstone, whom
the wind and the talking of the servants
had awakened, already below. Trembling
with apprehension, which the sudden ap∣pearance
of Celestina encreased—"Good
God, my dear friend, what is the matter?"
cried she, "and why are you out in so
dreadful a night?"</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58"/>
"Ah! dear Madam!" replied Celestina:
"Mr. Elphinstone—his boat—"</P>
<P>"What of him?" interrupted her terri∣fied
friend: "is he drowned? is he lost?"</P>
<P>"No, no! I hope, I believe not," cried
Celestina; "but a boat, which they say
is his, is beating off the island, and the
people are afraid it will go to pieces."</P>
<P>This was enough for the unhappy Mrs.
Elphinstone, who seeing, in it's most dread∣ful
light, the evil which threatened her,
now ran herself wildly towards the beach;
while Celestina, overtaking her with diffi∣culty,
persuaded her to accept her assist∣ance—assistance
which she was very little
able to give.</P>
<P>The sad event had happened before the
trembling friends had reached the head∣land.
The boat striking on the sunken
rocks, to save it from which the united
efforts of the little crew had been exerted
in vain, was staved to pieces, and the
unhappy men, already exhausted with fa∣tigue,
were unable to resist by swimming,
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
the violence of the sea. Mrs. Elphinstone
and Celestina looked out in vain for the
place where a few moments before the boat
had been seen: no vestige of it remained,
and they saw only, by the waining moon,
which but served to lend new horrors to the
view, the wild waves dashing over these
rocks in sheets of white foam; while the
fury of the winds and the beating of the
rain hardly allowed them to stand on the
precipice that overlooked the scene of
stormy desolation.</P>
<P>Celestina doubted but little of the cala∣mity,
and therefore endeavoured to per∣suade
her unfortunate friend to return to
the house; but this was impossible: she
continued to wander backwards and for∣wards
for some moments, till terror quite
overcame her; and she threw herself on
the ground, saying, in a low and solemn
voice to Celestina—"Elphinstone is
drowned; I know he is; and here I will
wait to see his corps, which will be driven
on shore in the morning." Then starting
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
up, she would have gone down to the
shore, from an idea which suddenly oc∣curred
to her that he might yet be saved
by swimming. Celestina, not knowing
whether it was best to prevent or to in∣dulge
her, unable to dissimulate and affect
hope she did not feel, was in a situation
hardly better than that of her distracted
friend whom she supported, when Mon∣tague
Thorold joined them. Mrs. El∣phinstone,
occupied only by the terror of
the moment, took no notice of the extra∣ordinary
circumstance of a stranger, whom
she had never seen before, thus suddenly
appearing; but unconscious of every
thing, and heedless of who he was, re∣quested
in accents of piercing anguish his
assistance to help her down the winding
path which led to the beach. He lent it,
though very certain that the catastrophe
had already taken place which by her ea∣ger
and wild enquiries he saw she yet
thought doubtful; and giving her one
arm, while with the other he clasped the
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
trembling hand of Celestina, they reached
the place, where seven or eight men were
already assembled. The moon was by
this time down, and the darkness was only
broken by livid flashes of faint lightning,
which, with the thunder muttering at a
distance, encreased the horrors of the
storm. Amid the black and swelling
waves, however, objects were seen floating,
and many of these heavy seas had not
broken on the shore, before these objects
were discerned to be the bodies of those
who had perished, and that of the ill fated
Elphinstone was one of the first which was
thrown on the beach, and too well known
by his unhappy wife. She now no longer
remembered all the causes of uneasiness
that her husband had given her; but saw
only Elphinstone, once so fondly beloved,
the possessor of her first affections, the fa∣ther
of her children, a disfigured corpse
before her. Her native strength of under∣standing,
and the calmness acquired by
habitual suffering, forsook her at once, and

grief produced a momentary phrenzy, dur∣ing
which fearful paroxysm, Celestina, whose
presence of mind was now summoned to
the assistance of her poor unhappy friend,
had her conveyed with great difficulty to
the house; where Montague Thorold at∣tending
them both with the most assiduous
tenderness, she watched for many days
over the disordered intellects of the ill fated
Mrs. Elphinstone before she saw them re∣stored.
At length the violence of her af∣fliction,
which Celestina found means to
soften by presenting her children continu∣ally
to her, and talking to her of those
that were absent, sunk into the calm torpor
of despair. She heard nothing, she saw
nothing but the children, whom she would
not suffer to be a moment absent from her;
and the agitation of her mind preying on
her slender frame, she was reduced to a
state of languor which made Celestina
tremble for her life.</P>
<P>Celestina had, immediately after the fa∣tal
event, written to Cathcart, desiring his <PB N="61" REF="67"/>
directions, and even entreating him to
come, himself to fetch them all from a place
where there was now no reason for their
stay. But she knew that it must be five
or six weeks before she could have an an∣swer;
and hardly dared trust herself to
meditate on the scenes of distress she must
in that time encounter.</P>
<P>Amid all the horrors however which had
surrounded her, she had not forgotten the
fears and alarms to which she knew the ab∣sence
of Montague Thorold exposed his
father, her benefactor; she seized the first
interval, after the death of Elphinstone, to
urge to him the cruelty of his conduct,
and to entreat him to return home; but
he replied, that nothing on earth should
induce him to leave the place where she
was, while there was a probability of his
being of use to her; and that whether she
admitted him to see her, or drove her from
him, the island should be his residence
while she remained in it. All that then
remained for her was, to write to Mr. Tho∣rold,

<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
which she did under cover to Cath∣cart,
acquainting him as briefly as she
could of the unexpected appearance of his
son, and all that had happened since.</P>
<P>Having thus far acquitted herself, she
found herself in a situation in which it was
almost impossible for her to help receiving
the assistance of one to whom she trembled
to be obliged, while she knew it encou∣raged
and augmented a passion that em∣poisoned
his life. On him, however, she
was compelled to entrust the regulation of
the last melancholy offices that were to
be performed for poor Elphinstone, who
was interred in a little ruined chapel about
two miles from his late residence; his
wife consenting reluctantly to this disposi∣tion,
and taking opiates incessantly to pro∣cure
that torpor which alone prevented the
more violent ebullitions of grief from seiz∣ing
her again, when the remains of her
husband were removed.</P>
<P>Recourse to opiates became gradually a
habit with Mrs. Elphinstone; and though
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
Celestina trembled for the consequences,
she thought it almost inhuman to oppose
the application of any remedy, which, un∣der
such circumstances, won her friend
from sorrow even for an hour. Yet the
frequent absences it occasioned, compelled
her to be very long and very often alone
with Montague Thorold, to whose manly
tenderness on the late sad occasion she could
not be insensible, and to whose unceasing
attention she was every hour more obliged.
In the first conference they had held when
the melancholy event to which they had
been witnesses allowed them to talk of
themselves, Celestina, after urging him to
return to his father by every motive with
which reason and truth supplied her, repeated
to him with great firmness her resolution
never to marry if Willoughby was not her
husband, and represented very forcibly the
cruelty as well as absurdity of his pursuing
her; to which he replied, that he knew all
she represented before he came thither,
that his only wish was to be allowed to see
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
her, though at a distance, and his only
gratification, that of being suffered to
breathe the same air; that it was the na∣tural
privilege of every human being to
pursue their happiness when it injured no∣body;
and that finding <HI>his</HI> consisted in
being near her, though without even the
hope of her admitting him into her pre∣sence,
he had followed that axiom, and
had for some weeks, been the distant and
unseen companion of all her walks. "I
was the highlander," said he, "who sup∣plied
the vacancy I had before taken care
to make when you went your excursion on
the water. I am the person of whom you
have sometimes caught a glimpse at a dis∣tance,
and who would never have ap∣proached
you nearer, had not my fears for
you the evening of the storm thrown me
off my guard, and induced me to conceal
myself within a few yards of you, behind
those piled up stones against which you
leaned. Ah! I heard you sigh—I heard
the name of Willoughby repeated with
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
tenderness! but I bore it all! and nothing,
believe me, nothing but your fall, your ap∣parent
danger, could have compelled me
to break the vow I had made never to in∣trude
upon you—never to offend you with
my unhappy passion!"</P>
<P>Celestina could not help being affected
with the melancholy solemnity with which
he uttered these words; but making an
effort to prevent his perceiving it, she
said—"It is absolutely necessary now that
you again take up as much of so proper a
resolution as relates to not speaking to me
on a topic which to you must be useless,
and to me painful; and while you persist in
remaining here, let me at least owe it to
your complaisance not to be distressed by
declarations to which I cannot, ought not,
will not listen."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, then laying his
hand on his heart, assured her that if she
would allow him only to see her, indulge
him only with being useful to her in her
present remote and comfortless residence,
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
he never would again name to her the pas∣sion
which he knew, he said, he must carry
to the grave; and from that moment he
kept his word; though Celestina saw, with
more emotion perhaps than the warmest
declarations could have given her, his
painful struggles and continual contention
with himself: but while her pity for him
encreased, she studied more carefully to
conceal from him that she felt any, and
behaved with as much calm politeness as
she could have done towards the most in∣different
man in the world.</P>
<P>To beguile the tedious moments during
which they were compelled to wait the
hoped for arrival of Cathcart, and while
the sea that surrounded them was agitated
continually by the wintry tempest, Celes∣tina
had recourse to the books with which
poor Elphinstone, who, among all his
faults and errors, was not without taste,
had furnished a closet in the house. Mrs.
Elphinstone, moved by the representations
of Celestina to attend to her health for the
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
sake of her children, whose sole dependance
was now on her, consented by degrees to
listen while Celestina read. Montague
Thorold, whose residence was at the cot∣tage
of a highlander that boasted of hav∣ing
two rooms and a chimney, about a mile
farther on the island, was sometimes ad∣mitted
to these parties; and as Celestina
was soon fatigued, and as he read remark∣ably
well, Mrs. Elphinstone appeared
pleased with his taking occasionally the
office of their reader, and gradually he
became accustomed to attend them every
afternoon, and to read aloud to them till
the hour of their simple supper.</P>
<P>Among the books in this little collection,
there were several that Celestina recollected
as the peculiar favourites of Willoughby;
and the remembrance of those days when
heread them to her, though never a mo∣ment
absent from her thoughts, were now
most forcibly recalled by hearing them
again repeated. Some pieces of poetry
particularly affected her, from their simple
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
pathos, and the manner in which Monta∣gue
Thorold read them; while they often
drew tears from the unhappy Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
an effect at which Celestina rejoiced,
as her grief was now settled into that still
and sullen melancholy unsolicitous of con∣solation
and incapable of receiving it;
which, while it produces a degree of appa∣rent
calmness, preys with fatal power on
the heart.</P>
<P>Thus passed the heavy hours; till at
length, after a fortnight longer delay than
they had reckoned upon, letters were re∣ceived
from Cathcart: they contained in∣telligence
that old Winnington was dead,
and Jessy in such a state of health as made
it almost impossible for Cathcart to leave
her. He therefore besouglit Celestina to
accept the protection of Montague Tho∣rold
for herself, for Mrs. Elphinstone, and
her children, and to hasten to his house,
where he was now as able as happy to re∣ceive
them, as soon as was possible and
safe. Mr. Thorold wrote also to Celestina,
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
and expressed his hope that the wild eccen∣tricity
of his son, which had occasioned to
him so much pain, might at least be of
service to her, and entreated her to allow
him to attend her and her unfortunate
friend into Devonshire, where he assured
her he would prevent her receiving any
trouble from the importunities of Monta∣gue,
should he be weak enough to pre∣sume
too much on her favour. He wrote
also to his son; but after the contents of
that letter Celestina did not enquire, and
Montague carefully concealed them.</P>
<P>It was now determined that the plan
laid down by Cathcart and Mr. Thorold
should be pursued. Montague undertook
the arrangement of every thing, and with∣in
ten days they were ready to depart.</P>
<P>The weather alone seemed now likely to
prevent their crossing the water. Mrs.
Elphinstone, who had till now feared no∣thing,
being so apprehensive for her chil∣dren,
that every gust of wind, every swell
of the sea, made her shrink back with dis∣may,
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
and postpone from day to day a little
voyage which she yet earnestly wished
over. It was the end of November, and
very good weather could hardly be ex∣pected.
Dark and gloomy days, with
storms of wind and rain, succeeded each
other; and Celestina, whose thoughts had
been of late called frequently from her own
mournful contemplations to the acute dis∣tresses
of others, now relapsed again into
that desponding state of mind which her
long absence from Willoughby and his
apparent neglect of her unavoidably threw
her into. She had confined herself a good
deal to the house since Montague Thorold
had been so much with them, because
there either Mrs. Elphinstone or the chil∣dren
were usually in the room, and she by
that means avoided being alone with him;
but now, as he was more engaged by the
preparations for their departure, which he
had undertaken to superintend, and in set∣tling
poor Elphinstone's accounts with his
employers, Celestina again ventured out
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
of an evening whenever she could escape
unseen.</P>
<P>In one of these walks, along the edge of
very steep rocks, where the scene presented
only desolation: the dark and turbulent
sea on one side, and on the other a suc∣cession
of mountains, which seemed to
have been thrown upon each other in some
tremendous convulsion of nature, she
turned towards the yet more dreary North,
and reflected on the condition of those
whom the poet describes as
<Q>The last of men,</Q>
the inhabitants of Siberia, of Lapland, and
those extreme regions where
<Q>Life at last goes out.</Q></P>
<P>"Alas!" cried she, "if they have not our
enjoyments, they suffer not from those sen∣sibilities
which embitter our days. Their
short summer passes in laying up necessa∣ries
for their long winter; and with what
their desolate region affords them they
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
are content, because they know not that
there are comforts and conveniencies be∣yond
what it affords them. Void of the
wish and the power to observe other
modes of life, they are content with their
own, and though little superior in point
of intellect to the animal from which they
derive their support, yet they are happy,
if not from the possession of good, at
least from the absence of evil; from that
sickness of the soul which we taste from
deprivation and disappointment."</P>
<P>A deep sigh closed this short soliloquy;
and after indulging a little longer this
train of thought, it produced the follow∣ing
sonnet:</P>
<Q><LG>
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
<HEAD>THE LAPLANDER.</HEAD>
<L>The shivering native, who by Tenglio's side</L>
<L>Beholds with fond regret the parting light</L>
<L>Sink far away, beneath the darkening tide,</L>
<L>And leave him to long months of dreary night,</L>
<L>Yet knows, that springing from the eastern wave,</L>
<L>The sun's glad beams shall re-illume his way,</L>
<L>And, from the snows, secur'd within his cave,</L>
<L>He waits in patient hope—returning day.</L>
<L>Not so the sufferer feels, who, o'er the waste</L>
<L>Of joyless life, is destin'd to deplore</L>
<L>Fond love forgotten, tender friendship past,</L>
<L>Which, once extinquish'd, can revive no more:</L>
<L>O'er the blank void he looks with hopeless pain;</L>
<L>For him those beams of heaven shall never shine again.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>A few days after this, an interval of
calm weather gave to Mrs. Elphinstone
courage to determine on embarking: but
the evening before that on which it was
finally fixed that they should go, she told
Celestina, with a solemnity of voice and
manner that convinced her she was not to
be diverted from her purpose, that she
could not be satisfied to leave the island
without visiting the spot where lay the re∣mains
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
of her husband. Celestina, without
much hope of success, represented to her
how wrong it was to yield, or rather to en∣courage
sorrow, unavailing to it's object,
and injurious to those who were his living
representatives, by depriving her of her calm∣ness
of mind when exertion was most neces∣sary,
and injuring her own health, now so par∣ticularly
precious to them. To these argu∣ments
her poor friend replied, with melan∣choly
composure, that she should suffer more
in reflecting on her omission than she could
do in fulfilling what she had persuaded her∣self
was a duty. Celestina therefore agreed
to accompany her that evening. Monta∣gue
Thorold had already shewn her the
place, and Mrs. Elphinstone desired to
have no other witness to her sorrows, than
the soft hearted and pitying friend, without
whose generous sympathy she would pro∣bably
long before have sunk under them.</P>
<P>It was near two months since the death
of Elphinstone, when this melancholy fare∣wel
visit was to be paid by his widow. A
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
calm but sullen day, with an overclouded
sky, threatening snow, was succeeded by a
dark but mild evening. The distant sun
had left a few lines of red light in the
western horizon; and the moon, within a
day or two of being at the full, edged with
fainter rays the opposite clouds, through
which it appeared not but at intervals.
The unhappy widow, leaning on the arm
of her tender friend, walked slowly and
with languid steps, as she was guided to∣wards
the ruined chapel, and a universal
pause of nature seemed to respect her sor∣rows!
Not a breath of air wandered
among the channels of the hills, and the
waterfalls murmured low and hollow at a
distance; the sea was calm, and being low
on the sands, was hardly heard; while the
birds, and few animals who inhabited the
land, were retired to their repose.</P>
<P>Around this little chapel, now more than
half in ruins, a few rude stones were raised
to the memory of the dead of former times.
The grass and weeds concealed many, and
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
on the rest no figures but those of crosses
rudely cut were now visible. Elphinstone
had been interred within the walls of the
edifice itself; his widow desired her friend
to enter it with her, to shew her the place,
and to leave her.</P>
<P>As they approached the spot, the ground
sounded hollow beneath their feet, and a
mournful echo ran round the damp walls.
The moon, darting for a moment through
the ruined stone work of the dismantled
window, shewed them a broken table that
had once been the altar, on which some
pieces of the gothic ornaments of the cha∣pel,
and several human bones, were scat∣tered,
and near it, the newly turned up
earth, on which a few stones were loosely
piled, discovered the grave of poor El∣phinstone.
Celestina could not trust her
voice to point it out; but leading her
friend to it, she immediately comprehended
that there lay the remains of her husband,
and fetching a deep sigh, she stopped at it.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83"/>
"I had better not leave you surely,"
cried Celestina mournfully. "I cannot
bear to leave you in this dreadful place."</P>
<P>"Pray oblige me," replied her friend;
"it is the last indulgence I will ask, and I
promise not to stay long."</P>
<P>"I will wait for you without then," re∣plied
Celestina; "and pray, dear Sophy,
consider your children, and let it not be
long that you indulge this sad propensity."</P>
<P>She then went out of the chapel; and
seating herself on one of the ruined, monu∣ments
near it's entrance, yielded to all the
gloomy thoughts which the place, the hour,
and the occasion inspired. "Ah! who
knows," cried she, "whether I too may
not have reason to lament even as this poor
mourner, whose groans tear my heart to
pieces while I listen to them! I hear her!
she implores forgiveness of the shade of
her departed husband for all the involun∣tary
offences she committed against him:
she, whose whole life has been one course
of suffering, solicits forgiveness of him to
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
whom those sufferings were owing: she
forgets his faults towards her, and recol∣lects
only that he once loved her, that he
was the husband of her youth, and that he
is gone for ever; while she trembles for
the future fate of him, whose errors she only
remembers to recommend them to mercy!
Dreadful then is the final separation even
from those, of whom, though we have rea∣son
to complain, we have once loved: ah!
what must it be when an eternal barrier is
put between us and those whom we unre∣servedly
and passionately love. Willough∣by!
if I have regretted so deeply our se∣paration,
what would become of me should
I ever hang over the grave where thy
adored form moulders in the dust. Oh!
God! grant that I never sustain a trial like
that!"</P>
<P>Overwhelmed by these sad thoughts,
and terrified at the encreasing darkness and
fearful silence, which was broken only by
the deep sighs of her unhappy friend pros∣trate
on the grave of her husband, she
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
started up to recall her from her mournful
employment, when Montague Thorold,
breathless with haste and anxiety, ap∣proached
her; she was glad to recognize
him, and took the hand he offered her;
while he cried impatiently—"Wherefore
is all this, my dear Madam, and where is
your friend?"</P>
<P>Celestina led him to the place, shudder∣ing
as she approached, while Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
recovering herself by an effort of
resolution, and having perhaps disburthened
her oppressed heart and satisfied her
mournful propensity, agreed immediately
to go with them, and having turned once
more her streaming eyes on the spot as she
quitted the chapel, she suffered each of her
friends to take an arm, and lead her home
in silence; where Montague Thorold ad∣vised
her and Celestina to take immediately
a few hours rest, as the tide would serve
very early in the morning for their em∣barkation
in the vessel which now lay ready
to receive them.</P>

They followed his advice; and before
day break on the twentieth of December,
near seven months after their arrival in the
Isle of Skie, they quitted it; and landing
safely on the coast of Scotland, they pro∣ceeded
with very great fatigue, though
fortunately without being intercepted by
such heavy snows as they had at such a sea∣son
reason to apprehend, to Edinburgh,
where it was necessary for them to rest
some days before they proceeded on their
long journey to the other extremity of Great
Britain.</P>

<PB N="81" REF="91"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mrs. Elphinstone was too much de∣jected
to allow her to go out, Celestina, who
had great pleasure in visiting antiquities, and
whose active mind was perpetually in search
of new ideas, was compelled either to relin∣quish
these gratifications, or to permit
Montague Thorold only to accompany
her. He was generally so guarded in his
conversation, that, though it was easy to
see how much he suffered in suppressing
his passion, Celestina had no reasonable
ground of complaint. He found, how∣ever,
at Edinburgh, that it was particularly
uneasy to her to visit the places she wished
to see without some other companion, and
recollecting that one of the professors was
well known to his father, he made use of
<PB N="82" REF="92"/>
the claim that acquaintance gave him, and
by that means Celestina received all the at∣tention
and hospitality for which the Scot∣tish
nation are so justly praised. The gen∣tleman
to whom she thus became known,
had several daughters, amiable and ele∣gant
young women: with them she saw all
that the capital of Scotland afforded wor∣thy
of observation; with them she visited
the ruinous chapel and magnificently
mournful apartments of Holyrood House,
and gave a sigh to the fate of the lovely,
luckless Mary, who was almost its last resi∣dent
sovereign. Then parting with her
newly acquired friends with mutual regret,
she proceeded on her road to England,
nothing particular occurring on the way
for some time except the slow but evident
amendment of Mrs. Elphinstone's spirits,
and the symptoms of encreased attachment
in Montague Thorold; who, if he loved
her before with an attachment fatal to his
peace and subversive of his prospects, now
seemed to idolize her with an ardour bor∣dering
<PB N="83" REF="93"/>
on phrenzy. In despite of the resolu∣tions
she had avowed to him, in despite
of those he had himself formed, this ar∣dent
and invincible passion was visible in
every thing he said and did. He seemed
to have forgotten that he had any other
business in the world than to serve her, to
listen to the enchantment of her voice, to
watch every change of her countenance.
His whole being was absorbed in that one
sentiment; and though he had promised
not to consider the advantages, which his
own wild Quixotism, aided by accident,
had thus obtained for him, as making the
least alteration in the decided preference
of Celestina for another, he insensibly for∣got,
at least at times, her unalterable affec∣tion
for Willoughby; and seeing, notwith∣standing
all her attempts to conceal it, that
she pitied him, that she was not insensible
of his attempts to please her nor blind to
his powers of pleasing, he cherished, in
defiance of reason and conviction (from
which he fled as much as possible) the ex∣travagant
<PB N="84" REF="94"/>
hope that the barrier, whatever
it was, between her and Willoughby would
be found invincible, and that the time,
though it might yet be remote, would at
length arrive when he should himself be
allowed to aspire to her favour.</P>
<P>The human mind, however strong,
yields too easily to these illusions, whence
at least it enjoys the soft consolations of
hope, and sees rays of light, which, though
imaginary, perhaps are all we often have to
carry us on with courage over the rugged
way, too thickly sown with real, or, missing
them, with imaginary and self-created evils.</P>
<P>It is therefore little to be wondered at, if
Montague Thorold, so sanguine in tem∣perament,
of so little experience in life,
(for he was yet hardly twenty two) and so
much in love, should thus eagerly feed
himself with hopes of its ultimate success,
and be wilfully deaf to every argument
which reason would have brought against
the reality of the gay visions he cherished.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="95"/>
Celestina, pitying and esteeming him,
was very anxious to reduce this unhappy
and fruitless prepossession to the bounds of
friendship and esteem, and though she at this
time thought of Willoughby with so much
internal anguish that she never on other
occasions willingly named him, yet she
now took occasion sometimes to speak of
him, and purposely laid her train of con∣versation
in such a way with Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
as gave Montague Thorold to un∣derstand
that her sentiments in regard to
him who had first possessed and still was
master of her heart, could never suffer any
material change, or be transferred to ano∣ther,
even though she was sure that she
was personally divided from him for ever.</P>
<P>After some days travelling, which the lan∣guor
of Mrs. Elphinstone, and her extreme
anxiety about her children, rendered tedious,
the party arrived at York, and there it was
determined to remain two days. Celestina,
who had nobody to receive her at the end
of her pilgrimage with peculiar delight,
<PB N="86" REF="96"/>
was not very eager to finish it; Mrs. El∣phinstone,
seeing nothing but poverty and
dependence before her, of which her mind,
being enfeebled by grief, was little able to bear
a nearer prospect, was yet less anxious; and
Montague Thorold cared not how long a
journey lasted which gave him what he
must at its termination lose, the happiness
of being with, and of being useful to the
mistress of his heart.</P>
<P>When they arrived at York, there was
an appearance of snow; it fell with violence
during the night, and by ten o'clock the
next morning the north road was rendered
impassable.</P>
<P>The travellers were well assured that
in a day or two it would be sufficiently
beat for them to proceed with safety, and
as their original intention was to remain at
least two days, the farther immaterial delay
with which this circumstance threatened
them, gave to none of them any concern.</P>
<P>The snow, however, continued to fall
very heavily, and the cold became almost
<PB N="87" REF="97"/>
insupportably severe. The party were
drawn round a good fire at the inn, and
Mrs. Elphinstone had just put her children
to bed, when an unusual clamour and bustle
below attracted their attention. Horses
were called for, and a loud voice was heard
to say—"If four are not sufficient, my
master will have fourteen rather than be
stopped a moment."</P>
<P>"This is some matrimonial expedition,"
cried Montague Thorold, "or why all
this haste?" The idea, which the ladies
allowed to be probable, excited some de∣gree
of curiosity, and when the waiter soon
after came in to lay the cloth for supper,
Montague could not forbear enquiring if
the horses which were a short time before
so eagerly called for were not for the ac∣commodation
of a young couple hastening
into Scotland. The man replied that the
gentleman was going into Scotland, and
had been stopped by the snow about seven
miles off, the horses he had to his chaise
being unable, to draw him; but that he
<PB N="88" REF="98"/>
understood he was quite alone, that horses
and men had been sent to his assistance, and
that he was expected there presently.</P>
<P>The man, who probably loved to hear
himself talk, went on to inform them,
though they now no longer felt any great
degree of curiosity, that the gentleman's
valet de chambre and one of the postillions,
who had come forward, (who were warming
themselves at the fire below before they re∣turned
back as they were ordered,) had de∣clared
that they were almost dead with
cold; "but as for that, Sir," continued
the waiter, "he says, that is, Sir, the <HI>wa∣let
de sham</HI> says, says he, my master if
once he've got a scheme in his head, 'tis
not cold, no nor water, nor fire neither,
<HI>as</HI> will find it an easy matter to stop him,
and then, says he, as. for fatigue to his
own self, says he, or danger, or any thing
of the like nature, or expence, though it
cost him a hundred, aye or a thousand
pounds, why my master, says he, minds
it no more than nothing; 'tis all one to
<PB N="89" REF="99"/>
him; yet to be sure, says he, he is a good
master in the main, and no sneaker, nei∣ther
in money, nor liquor, nor no other
accommodation to servants."</P>
<P>"And pray," said Montague Thorold,
"who is this courageous, bountiful, and
accommodating gentleman?"</P>
<P>"I did not think to ask his name, Sir,"
replied the waiter, "but I can know in a
minute." He then, without waiting for
an answer, ran down stairs, and returning
almost instantly, said that the gentleman
was 'Squire Vavasour of Staffordshire.</P>
<P>"Vavasour!" cried Celestina in a faint
voice, and turning as pale as death.
"Good Heaven! to what purpose can
Vavasour be travelling in such haste to∣wards
Scotland."</P>
<P>"Vavasour!" echoed Montague Tho∣rold,
his countenance betraying all that
passed in his heart: "Vavasour! Ah!
Miss De Mornay, it was to you he was
undoubtedly going. Willoughby is re∣turned,
<PB N="90" REF="100"/>
and sends his friend to reclaim his
betrothed wife."</P>
<P>"Sends his friend! oh! no, no," an∣swered
Celestina with quickness, "that
cannot be: were Willoughby returned, he
would not <HI>send;</HI> rather it is some sad news
he has to impart, and I must prepare my∣self
for it—I must bear it be it what it
may."</P>
<P>The cruellest anxiety now took possession
of both Celestina and Montague Thorold;
they both dreaded an explanation, though
unable to bear the suspense. Thorold
went down to see what he could gather
from the men; but Mr. Vavasour's servant
was gone back to meet his master, and the
postillion had only come with him from the
last post town. Celestina in the mean
time now traversed the room, now went
to the window, and now appeared to at∣tend
to the conjectures Mrs. Elphinstone
offered, that perhaps this journey might in
no respect relate to her, but might be ow∣ing
to one of those sudden starts of caprice
<PB N="91" REF="101"/>
in which Vavasour was known to indulge
himself.</P>
<P>This state of suspense and conjecture,
which is of all others least easy to be borne,
did not last long, for in about a quarter of
an hour the carriage, in which Vavasour
himself was, arrived.</P>
<P>Celestina now debated within herself
whether she ought to send to him, to in∣form
him of her being on her way to Eng∣land,
or suffer him to proceed, whither
she doubted not he was going, even to the
Hebrides in search of her. This internal
debate was however short: her extreme
solicitude to have news of Willoughby su∣perceded
every other thought; and whe∣ther
Vavasour was going to Scotland to an∣nounce
her fate to her by the direction of
Willoughby, or merely in consequence of
some whim of his own, she knew that he
in all probability could give her some in∣telligence
of him of whom she most wished
to hear. Montague Thorold, who trem∣bled
least in consequence of this interview
<PB N="92" REF="102"/>
all the day dreams in which he had been
indulging himself should be at once de∣stroyed,
would have represented to her
some imaginary improprieties which his
wish to find them raised in his mind.</P>
<P>Celestina, however, had, with all her can∣dour
and humility, a decisive spirit, the ef∣fect
of her great good sense, which, when
she had once examined and determined on
any subject, did not leave her open to the
trifling perplexities of feeble and unim∣portant
debate. She considered, that even
if Vavasour <HI>was</HI> going on some eccentric
idea of his own to follow her into Scot∣land,
it would be cruel and unjust to suf∣fer
him to pursue such a journey at such a
season, and therefore steadily resisting all
the representations of Montague Thorold
against it, she addressed to him the follow∣ing
note:</P>
<P>"Miss de Mornay presents her compli∣ments
to Mr. Vavasour, and having
learned by accident that he is at this
<PB N="93" REF="103"/>
place, requests the favour of seeing him
to-morrow morning to breakfast with
Mrs. Elphinstone and with her at half
past nine."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, being unable wholly
to prevent, thought he could at least im∣pede
the delivery of this note till the next
day; but Celestina was too impatient to
hear of Willoughby to be blind to the ar∣tifice
which Montague was too much in
love to manage very dexterously, and
therefore quitting the room herself, she
found one of the waiters, who she enjoined
to give the note to the gentleman who was
just arrived, as soon as he had done supper.</P>
<P>This was not perhaps very discreet: but
Celestina thought much at the moment of
Willoughby, and very little of Vavasour,
and in her anxiety to hear news of the
one, she reflected not on the way in which
it might be conveyed by the other, who,
after a long and cold journey, having fi∣nished
his supper, was not likely at least to
<PB N="94" REF="104"/>
be a clear and calm messenger, and a mo∣ment's
reflection would have convinced her
that he was not a man who from motives of
delicate forbearance and polite deference
would put off the interview to the time she
had named.</P>
<P>No sooner was the note from Celestina
delivered to Vavasour, than he ran up
stairs with an impatience amounting al∣most
to phrenzy, his eyes flashing fire, and
his countenance expressive of the violent
emotions with which he was agitated; he
hardly noticed Mrs. Elphinstone, but cast∣ing
a look of angry surprise at Montague
Thorold, whom he immediately knew, he
approached Celestina, took her hand, and
eagerly kissing it, told her in a hurried
manner that he was hastening to Scotland
to give her intelligence of very great con∣sequence,
and to deliver her a packet from
Willoughby.</P>
<P>"From Willoughby!" replied Celestina,
so extremely affected by his abrupt entrance
<PB N="95" REF="105"/>
that she was ready to faint. "Is he well?
is he returned to England?"</P>
<P>"No," replied he, without seeming
sensible of the nature of her sufferings,
"not returned to England, or likely to re∣turn,
but—"</P>
<P>"Is he married then?" said Celestina,
interrupting him in a still more trembling
voice.</P>
<P>"Not yet, but I have a letter for you
which—"</P>
<P>"Give it me," cried she, hardly able
to breathe. He had it not about him, but
ringing for his servant, gave him the key
of his portmanteau, and bidding him bring
a large sealed packet, which he said he
would find there, the man immediately re∣turned
with it; and Celestina, without
speaking to Vavasour, hurried away with
it in breathless agitation, Mrs. Elphinstone,
alarmed at her looks, following her in si∣lence.</P>
<P>All this time Montague Thorold had re∣mained
leaning against one of the piers:
<PB N="96" REF="106"/>
with contracted brows and clasped hands
watching the countenance of Celestina,
while his own changed from pale to red,
from red again to pale. He had always
returned the dislike which Vavasour had
shewn towards him as much as his nature
could return dislike; and this was en∣creased
by the abrupt and unfeeling man∣ner
in which Vavasour had executed a com∣mission,
that, whether it brought to her
welcome or unwelcome tidings, demanded,
he thought, more delicacy and more pre∣paration.
When Celestina and Mrs. El∣phinstone
were gone, he felt no inclination
therefore to stay with Vavasour, who
walked up and down the room as if ex∣pecting
their return; but was preparing to
leave it, when, as he crossed to the door,
Vavasour, turning short towards him, asked
how he came to be at York with Miss De
Mornay.</P>
<P>"How I came, Sir!" replied Monta∣tague
Thorold with equal abruptness.
"Have <HI>you</HI> any right, Sir, to enquire?"</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="107"/>
"Yes," replied Vavasour contemptu∣ously,
"I have a right."</P>
<P>"To enquire into my actions, Sir?" in∣terrupted
Thorold; "surely not!"</P>
<P>"To enquire into those of Miss De Mor∣nay,
Sir, <HI>I have</HI> a right."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir, if she allows of that right,
to her you may then apply; but you will
be so good as to leave me at liberty to be
at York, or wherever else it is convenient
to me to be."</P>
<P>"Not with her, Sir, you must not; not
with Miss De Mornay, be assured. As for
the rest, pray understand, that were it not
for the circumstance of your being seen in
company with her, <HI>I</HI> should never recollect
that such a person was in the world as Mr.
Montague Thorold."</P>
<P>Thorold, though naturally of a gentle
disposition, was little disposed to bear the
contemptuous arrogance of any man: he
therefore answered with more quickness,
that it was an honour he could well dis∣pense
with, to be thought of at all by <HI>such</HI> a
<PB N="98" REF="108"/>
man as Mr. Vavasour. The tone in which
he spoke this, and the emphasis he laid on
the words <HI>such</HI> a man, provoked the
haughty and impetuous spirit of Vavasour;
and words rose so high between them, that
Mrs. Elphinstone, who was only in the
next room, came in, and extremely terri∣fied
at their violence, besought them to
separate. Vavasour, whose passions were
at all times too strong to suffer him to lis∣ten
either to reason from others or to his
own, gave very little attention to her re∣monstrances;
but Montague Thorold, on
seeing her extreme uneasiness, and on
hearing the name of Celestina, became in
a moment apparently calm; and assuring
Mrs. Elphinstone that she had no reason to
be alarmed, he addressed himself coolly
to Vavasour, and said, that if he had any
business with him he would be at his ser∣vice
in the morning: he then besought
Mrs. Elphinstone to return to Celestina;
and taking her hand, led her out of the
room, assuring her in a whisper that he
<PB N="99" REF="109"/>
would not return that evening to Vavasour,
nor have any farther contention with him.
"Make yourself easy, therefore, my dear
Madam," said he, "and tell me—how is
our lovely friend? what are the contents
of a letter which required so extraordinary
a messenger?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone answered, that Celestina
had appeared in great emotion while she
read the beginning of the letter, and then
telling her that she should finish it in her
own room, had left her, in encreased agi∣tation
she thought, but without tears.</P>
<P>"And shall you see her no more to∣night?"
enquired Montague Thorold.</P>
<P>"I rather believe not," replied Mrs.
Elphinstone.</P>
<P>"And do you think," said Thorold,
"do you think, my dear Madam, that the
agitation, the emotion you remarked, was
the effect of joy, of grief—"</P>
<P>"Of grief, of disappointment, of regret,
I think," answered she. "I believe Ce∣lestina
is now convinced that every proba∣bility
<PB N="100" REF="110"/>
of her becoming the wife of Mr.
Willoughby is at an end for ever."</P>
<P>"Then," cried Montague Thorold,
unable to repress the violence of his feel∣ings;
"oh! then there will be hope for me!"</P>
<P>There was something like the transports
of phrenzy in the manner in which he ut∣tered
this, and Mrs. Elphinstone was
shocked at it. "Be not too sanguine, Mr.
Montague," said she. "I do not believe
that the affections of Miss De Mornay are
to be easily or lightly transferred, but if
they were, think of the powerful claims
upon them that are using against your's."</P>
<P>"Claims! what claims?" cried he:
"who shall dare to dispute with me an heart
to which—"</P>
<P>"Nay, nay," answered Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
"this is all phrenzy and wildness.
Do you not know that you have no claim,
though I am willing to allow all your me∣rit;
and do you not see that Willoughby,
in being compelled to resign her, recom∣mends
<PB N="101" REF="111"/>
his friend Vavasour to her favour,
and therefore sends him hither."</P>
<P>"Vavasour!" cried he: "recommend
Vavasour to her! And would Celestina,
who, with all that dignified gentleness, has
a great deal of spirit, with a proper con∣sciousness
of her own value; would she
bear to be consigned, like a bale of mer∣chandise,
to a friend, and to such a man as
Vavasour? Impossible! he dare not think
of it: but I wish he may, for her insulted
pride will mitigate the pain of her disap∣pointed
love, and she will be mine—the
charmer will be mine."</P>
<P>The look, the manner, in which this
was uttered, encreased the concern of Mrs. Elphinstone,
who, from her own recent
and severe sufferings, had learned to dread
any thing like romantic eccentricity. She
laid her soft cold hand on the burning
hands of Montague Thorold, as they were
wildly clasped together—"My dear Sir,"
said she, in the gentlest accents, "I owe
you a thousand obligations for all the atten∣tion
<PB N="102" REF="112"/>
you shewed me in my late calamitous
situation, and ill, very ill, should I repay
those obligations, if I did not try as a
friend to mitigate these violent transports.
Believe me, the heart of Celestina, fixed
in her early life to one object, is attached
to that object with more than common
firmness: Vavasour's frantic fondness, and
your real merit, will, in my opinion, be
equally indifferent to her; and I verily be∣lieve,
that if Willoughby marries another,
as I conclude he will, Miss De Mornay
will never marry at all."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold could not bear this.
The idea of rivalry had been painful; but
the pain was mitigated by his knowledge
of her character and of the character of
Vavasour, which, with all its avowed li∣bertinism,
he knew Celestina could not
even tolerate, and certainly not approve:
but the idea of her living only for Wil∣loughby,
even when Willoughby lived for
another, was insupportable, and since he
was unwilling to own it was possible, he
<PB N="103" REF="113"/>
would therefore have been ready to quarrel
with any body but Mrs. Elphinstone for
supposing it probable: but to every being
who was unfortunate, and especially if that
unfortunate being was a woman, the kind
heart of Montague Thorold overflowed
with good will and sympathy: he there∣fore
checked himself; and saying he
should be impatient to hear of Miss De
Mornay in the morning, he wished Mrs.
Elphinstone a good night, and left her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not till after two or three read∣ings,
with a palpitating heart—a heart so
much agitated as hardly to leave her the
use of her reason, that Celestina perfectly
understood the meaning of Willoughby's
letter, which ran thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>The only apology, dear Celestina, that
the unhappy Willoughby has to offer for
his conduct is, to relate to you all that
has befallen him since that fatal night
when he parted from you at Alvestone.
The emotions which I must feel while I
write, I will endeavour to suppress,
both for your sake and my own; it shall
be, if I can command myself, a history
<PB N="105" REF="115"/>
of events rather than of the sufferings to
which those events have condemned me.
You know, that after the abrupt and
unaccountable note that I received, I
hastened to the inn at Exeter, where
I was informed some persons, who had
business of the utmost importance which
admitted not of a moment's delay,
waited to see me. The terms in which
the note was written were such as gave
me a strange alarm, though I knew not
what to dread. This uneasy astonish∣ment
was not lessened, when, after much
appearance of mystery, I was introduced
to—Lady Castlenorth.</P>
<P>You know the woman, and can ima∣gine
how ill her harshness, when irritated
by the malignity of disappointed pride,
was calculated to soften the blow which
it was her pleasure to give me herself.
She told me, that having heard I was
on the following morning to become
your husband, she felt it to be her duty
to save me from the horrors of such a
<PB N="106" REF="116"/>
union, by informing me that she knew
you to be the daughter of my mother,
the daughter of that Mr. Everard who
was my tutor, and that the woman she
had with her, who had been a servant
in the house at the time, could give the
most indisputable account of your birth.</P>
<P>Stunned as by a stroke of thunder, I
turned towards the woman, of whose
face as a servant of my mother's I had
not the least recollection. I know not
what I said to her; I only remember
that she gave, in a confused and vulgar
way, an account of what she pretended
to have been witness to. I suffered her
to talk on, for my very soul was sink∣ing
with anguish. My mother's ho∣nour
destroyed! my Celestina torn from
me! My soul recoiled from the idea as
from an execrable falshood. Yet when
I remembered the solemn injunction
that beloved mother gave me in her
last moments to marry Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
the promise she drew from me ne∣ver
<PB N="107" REF="117"/>
otherwise to unite myself—when
my agonized mind ran back to the dis∣pleasure
she sometimes expressed at my
fondness and admiration for you—I
dared not, with all the pain and all the
horror I felt, I dared not throw from me
with indignation this odious intelligence;
I dared not load the hateful communi∣cators
of it with the odium which would
have been dictated by my swelling heart,
had it not been checked by these sad
recollections, which pressed upon me
in despite of myself, and gave me some∣thing
like internal evidence of the facts
I would very fain have denied.</P>
<P>There was, in the countenance of
Lady Castlenorth, something of inso∣lent
triumph which I could not bear.
She made a merit of her disinterested
conduct, and talked of virtue, and ho∣nour,
and integrity, till I was blind and
deaf: she then threw out some reflec∣tions
on my mother's memory, which
roused me from the torpor of amaze∣ment
<PB N="108" REF="118"/>
and sorrow to resentment; she ut∣tered
some malignant sarcasms against
you, and I flew from her.</P>
<P>She had, however, completely exe∣cuted
her purpose, if it was that of ren∣dering
me the most wretched of human
beings; and in quitting the house,
which she did soon afterwards, had the
barbarous pleasure of knowing that she
had destroyed my peace for some time—if
not for ever.</P>
<P>To return to you, Celestina, under
the doubts which distracted me was
impossible. To become your husband—so
lately the fondest, the first wish of a
heart that doated upon you, was not
to be thought of, while ideas of so much
horror obtruded themselves on my mind:
yet to leave you without accounting for
my absence, to leave you to all the tor∣turing
suspense of vague conjectures, to
leave you to suppose I had deceived
and forsaken you, was cruel, was un∣pardonable:
it was, however, what,
<PB N="109" REF="119"/>
after a long and dreadful struggle, I de∣termined
to do. I might, indeed, have
put an end to your conjectures by deli∣vering
you over to others more tor∣menting—by
communicating the doubts
Lady Castlenorth had raised; but this
I found I could less bear to do than
even to leave you wholly in suspense.
Believing her capable of any thing which
revenge or malice could dictate, there
was reason, notwithstanding all my
trembling apprehensions, to suppose it
more than possible that she might have
invented the story, and have bribed the
woman with her to give evidence of it's
truth. To this possibility my mind
clung with the eagerness of a drowning
wretch; and I could not resolve to sully
before you the memory of my angel
mother, which I know you hold in such
tender veneration; I could not deter∣mine
to raise in your delicate and sensi∣ble
mind doubts and terrors which
might make such fatal impressions as
<PB N="110" REF="120"/>
might impede our union, even if the
fallacy of this invention to divide us
was detected. In a state of mind then
which I will not attempt to describe, I
at length determined to send for Cath∣cart,
and without explaining even to
him the motives of my sudden journey,
to secure, if I could, your continuance
at Alvestone, and to set out myself to
discover the real circumstances of your
birth; and never to return till I had
the most thorough convinction that you
were not the daughter of my mother, or
till I could learn to consider you, if it
were so—only as a beloved sister.</P>
<P>Ah! Celestina! I little knew the task
I undertook; yet with anguish and de∣pression,
to which no words can do jus∣tice,
I set about it. My first step was,
to find out Watson, my mother's old
servant, who had never, I knew, left
her for many years. I knew that after
her death, and on receiving the legacy
of fifty pounds that her mistress left her,
<PB N="111" REF="121"/>
she had retired to the house of her son,
who was married and settled at White∣haven.
I might have written to have
enquired after her; but then I must
have waited some days in suspense I
could not bear; and while I was in mo∣tion
I felt my misery less, from an idea
that I was doing something to end it.
I sat out therefore on horseback for
Whitehaven, and on my arrival there
learned that she had been dead about
six weeks. This first hope of certainty
thus frustrated, it occurred to me that
perhaps among her papers there might
be some memorandums that would be
useful; and as she always hired and dis∣charged
the inferior servants, and kept
an account of the time and terms of their
service in a book, I flattered myself that
I might find some date of the time
when Hannah Biscoe, who pretended
to have been in her confidence and to
have been entrusted with a secret of such
importance, really lived in the family.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="122"/>
I told her son, that to see all the pa∣pers
his mother had left, was of impor∣tance
to me. He readily brought all
he had. There were some books of ac∣counts,
and some memorandums about
servants, but none that gave me any
light, or were of any importance to my
enquiry, for none went back above ten
years. The man told me there were
more; but that not knowing they were
of any consequence, or even supposing
them likely to be called for, he had
given them to his children, who had cut
them to pieces. "I believe, however,
Sir, said he, that there are some letters
in a drawer of a bureau, which I re∣member
to have seen during my mo∣ther's
illness: I will fetch them if you
think they will be of any service."</P>
<P>I desired him to do so, and he brought
me about twenty letters: some of them
were from my mother, while she was in
London in the years 1779 and 1780,
and Watson was at Alvestone with you
<PB N="113" REF="123"/>
and my sister, of whom she had, as you
well remember, the care on all occasions
where it was necessary for my mother to
be absent. You were then about nine,
and Matilda about eleven years old.
The only sentences of any kind of con∣sequence
were these:</P>
<P>I have no notion of any real danger
from the landing of troops from the fleets
of France and Spain. No landing can
take place; and 'tis all nonsense and bra∣vado.
I thought you had more sense,
Watson, than to catch the panic of the
vulgar and the ignorant, which <HI>they</HI> ra∣ther
like to communicate. However,
since you write so pressingly to know
what should be done if any thing should
happen, I give you an answer, first, that
nothing will happen; and secondly, if
you have any alarm, which a reasonable
being would consider such, take <HI>my</HI> two
girls and bring them up hither instantly.
But I shall be down at Alvestone in about
<PB N="114" REF="124"/>
ten days, and nothing can happen within
that time believe me</P>
<P><HI>My two girls,</HI> was the only sentence in
this letter on which I could lay any
stress. <HI>My</HI> two girls! Well, and what
then? have I not heard my mother a
thousand times say, <HI>my</HI> two girls? <HI>My
Matilda, my Celestina,</HI> were names in∣discriminately
used: my <HI>children;</HI> even
my <HI>daughters,</HI> were terms not unfre∣quent
with her. Ah! little, little did
her generous and benevolent heart sup∣pose
that <HI>such</HI> advantage might be taken
of that generosity—of that benevolence;
for now—even now—no—I do not, I
cannot, I will not believe that Celestina
has any other claim to her friendship, to
her protection, than what arose from
that generosity and benevolence. Now,
do I say?—can I say it? Oh heaven!
how dreadfully contradictory are the sen∣timents
that agitate and tear my heart!</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125"/>
Let me, however, recall my scattered
thoughts: and remember, that it is a
simple history of facts only, and not of
feelings, that I promised to relate.</P>
<P>Another letter was written to Watson,
when Mr. Everard, after a very tedious
illness, which had long confined him in
town, went down to Alvestone in the
year eighty, for change of air, rather
than to his own parsonage, where some
repairs were then going on. This letter
was expressive of great solicitude and
anxiety: but from thence what could be
inferred? nothing but that the dear and
benevolent writer was solicitous for the
health of a friend to whom she had long
been attached. There was not in this a
word on which the most invidious ob∣server
could dwell; nor was there in
any other letter a syllable to give me
any confirmation of what I dreaded to
find. Still I procured from the person
who had succeeded to Watson's effects,
every paper and every book that re∣mained;
<PB N="116" REF="126"/>
but I found nothing; and re∣turned
to London as miserable, as dissa∣tisfied
as I left it.</P>
<P>Nothing made me more wretched
than the questions with which I was now
persecuted. I fled from society; stopped
at a small village in the neighbourhood
of London, where I avoided every body
who was likely to know me, and thought
only how I might satisfy my own tor∣turing
doubts, and escape those of others.</P>
<P>The most obvious method seemed to
be, to find out the woman who had ac∣companied
Lady Castlenorth, and ques∣tion
her when she was no longer under
the influence of her employer: but this
I could not do without getting, at my
uncle's house, information which I
knew not how to set about. To go
there, was hateful to me. I could not
now bear the sight of people whom I
had never loved, and to whom I imputed
all the misery I laboured under.</P>

My servant Farnham had been little
used to those sort of negociations, and
knew not much better than I did, how
to ingratiate himself into the favour of
the persons, through whose means only
he could procure the intelligence so ne∣cessary
to us. He went, however, about
it as well as he could; but all I learned
was, that Lady Castlenorth had, soon
after her journey into Devonshire, sent
the woman who accompanied her away
into her native country, which was ei∣ther
Norfolk or Suffolk, and with so
much secrecy that nobody knew whi∣ther
she was gone, or how she was pro∣vided
for: but Farnham with some diffi∣culty
drew from the rest of the servants,
with whom he found means of convers∣ing,
that she had boasted, in some mo∣ments
of vulgar exultation, that her
fortune was made for ever.</P>
<P>No clue, however, could I obtain by
which I could find out this woman; and
after much fruitless enquiry, where the
<PB N="118" REF="128"/>
art of the adversary with whom I had
to engage baffled all my assiduity, I de∣termined
to go to Lord Castlenorth, to
state to him the stigma that his wife had
thrown on the honour of my mother,
his sister, and to demand that I might
have proofs of the facts she alledged,
such as she could now give, or that she
might acknowledge the wickedness and
injustice of her aspersions.</P>
<P>I was not aware, till I conversed with
Lord Castlenorth, to how debilitated a
state indolence, ignorance, pride, and
prejudice, can reduce the human mind.
His, however, was of so singular a cast,
that instead of being shocked at the in∣jury
done to his sister's honour, he af∣fected
to resent, in spite of his family
pride, my doubts of his wife's veracity,
flew from the point to which I attempted
to bring him, and we parted in mutual
disgust: at least I was disgusted, and
more wretched and more hopeless than
before I had made this attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="129"/>
Every effort to discover the retreat of
the woman failing, my next measure
was to go to the convent at Hieres. It
was owing to these cruel circumstances,
Celestina, that I left you in doubt while
I remained in England; it was owing
to these, that I left England in the
hope—though it became every day more
mingled with apprehension—that I left
England without accounting to you for
my conduct. Were these surmises
groundless, why should I empoison your
delicate mind? why should I sully for
a moment the sacred fame of my mo∣ther
by divulging them? were they
found to be at length too well substan∣tiated,
it would be then time enough to
inform you of them.</P>
<P>On my arrival at Hieres, I went di∣rectly
to the present Confessor of the
community out of whose care my mo∣ther
took you. I found him to be intel∣ligent,
obliging, and officious. From
him I learned, that the present Superior
<PB N="120" REF="130"/>
was a young woman of good family,
who had been compelled to take the veil,
and who would probably have very few
real scruples as to giving me all the in∣formation
she could.</P>
<P>I succeeded easily in my research, as
far as it depended on these two persons.
I found that the memorandum of my
mother's having taken you out of the
convent, by the name of Celestina de
Mornay, remained; and I found, with
emotions on which I must not dwell,
that there was another memorandum of
expences, for the little <HI>English</HI> child,
received at the request of Madame de
P—. Such is the literal sense of the
French words. Who then was this
Madame de P—? An old nun, who
had lived in the house above five and
twenty years, and who was the only
person who recollected any circumstan∣ces
of your reception, told me that she
well remembered that this Madame de
P—came from Bayonne, or some
<PB N="121" REF="131"/>
part of the country in the neighbour∣hood
of that town; and that she was an
intimate friend of the then Abbess, and
her name, of which only the initials
were expressed in the memorandum,
was le Marquise de Pellatier.</P>
<P>I enquired of the old nun, if she
knew on what ground it was you were
represented as an English child? she
replied, that she knew no more than
that when first you were received under
the care of the Superior, you were said
to be the child of English parents, or at
least that one of your parents was of that
nation: but that soon afterwards this
was, by the Abbess's authority, contra∣dicted;
it was forbidden to be men∣tioned
in the community; and it was
ordered that you should from that time
be spoken of as Mademoiselle de Mor∣nay;
while intimations were given that
you were a relation of her own; born of
a concealed marriage; and that your
father being dead, and your mother
<PB N="122" REF="132"/>
married to another person, you were to
be considered as belonging only to the
community in which you were destined
to pass your life.</P>
<P>Ah! Celestina! what food was here
for those corrosive conjectures which
preyed on my heart. Having exhausted
however, every kind of information
which it was here possible to procure, I
set out for Bayonne; where some of the
family at least of Madame de Pellatier
were, I understood, to be found.</P>
<P>She had herself been dead some years.
I met, however, with her son, a gay
young man of four or five and twenty,
from whom I could obtain nothing but
a general confession that his mother
probably had, from the general tenor of
her life, occasion in more than one in∣stance
to exercise the secrecy and kind
offices of her friends, and very probably
obliged them in her turn: and when I
explained to him my reasons for the
anxious enquiries I made, which I
<PB N="123" REF="133"/>
thought the only means likely to interest
him for me, he said that he was "<HI>vrai∣ment
au desespoir</HI>" at the little <HI>embarras</HI>
into which I had fallen: that la belle
demoiselle might be my sister or might
be his; that he had not the least hope
of being of service to me in unravelling
the mystery, for he had destroyed all
his mother's papers in pursuance of her
dying directions some years before, and
did not believe the slightest trace re∣mained
of any connection with an En∣glish
lady, or an English family. I en∣quired
where his mother lived in the
years 1770 and 1771, which was about
the time of your birth, and where in the
year 1772, the time of your reception in
the convent; he replied that she was
then sometimes at Paris, where she was
believed to have an arrangement with
Count W—, a German nobleman,
sometimes at Pezenas and sometimes
at Hieres. From all this I could gather
nothing to my purpose; and Monsieur
<PB N="124" REF="134"/>
de Pellatier soon quitting his house in
the neighbourhood of Bayonne to go to
Paris, I returned thither also, infinitely
more unhappy than before my research.</P>
<P>All I have related, Celestina, is so lit∣tle
convincing when it is put together,
that perhaps I ought not to lay any stress
upon it, when to such slight and unsatis∣factory
ground of conjecture, is opposed
the character and the principles of my
mother: yet shall I tell you truly, that
the energy with which she pressed me
with her last words to marry Miss Fitz-Hayman;
the displeasure she always
shewed at my expressing any partiality
towards you; her grief at the death of
Mr. Everard, which it was easy to see
she never recovered; some words which,
though I could not clearly understand
them, escaped her lips almost with her
last sigh, and in which the name of Ce∣lestina
seemed united with some ardent
prayer, or some earnest injunction,
while, in her cold convulsed hand, she
<PB N="125" REF="135"/>
pressed mine to her trembling lips; oh!
Celestina! those sounds I have since in∣terpreted
into a confession of this fatal
secret. Still, still inarticulate as they
were, they vibrate on my heart: and
now, united with the story of Lady Cas∣tlenorth,
and the circumstances I have
gathered of your being born of English
parents—all, all unite to render me
wretched.</P>
<P>Yet there is not the least likeness be∣tween
you and my mother; there is not
the remotest resemblance between you
and Mr. Everard, who had remarkably
strong features and very red hair: oh!
Celestina! what am I to conjecture?
what am I to do? can I, ought I, on
such grounds, to resign you? Can I ever
learn to consider you only as my sister?
Where shall I go next? how satisfy my
doubts? how ever possess again a mo∣ment's
happiness? Every other evil is light to this. Even
the disorder of my affairs, the necessity
<PB N="126" REF="136"/>
I shall soon be in to sell Alvestone, is
hardly felt. On my leaving England,
I raised money at an enormous premium
in order to pay Vavasour what I could
not bear to owe him, uncertain as I was
what would become of me. This, to∣gether
with my absence; has alarmed
some of my mortgagees, who talk of
foreclosing their mortgages; while my
own neglect of my affairs has, in despite
of Cathcart's assiduity, contributed to
my embarrassments. But what are these
inferior distresses, compared to the
wretchedness of a heart, adoring Celes∣tina
yet afraid of indulging his passion
lest it lead him into guilt? Ah! every
evil fortune could inflict but this, I could
bear.</P>
<P>But again it is necessary to recall my
pen from the description of feelings to the
narrative of facts.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady Castlenorth and their
daughetr arrived in the early part of the
summer in France. I was then absent
<PB N="127" REF="137"/>
on the research I have related to you,
but heard they had been very earnest in
their enquiries after me at Paris; and on
my return thither, some months after∣wards,
I received a letter from Lord
Castlenorth, earnestly desiring me to
join them at Florence or Naples. The
letter imported that the alliance he once
wished was no longer in question; but
that finding his health every day de∣clining,
he wished to see the only male
relation he had, on the settlement of
some family concerns.</P>
<P>This invitation I ought not perhaps
on other accounts to have refused; but
the hope of being able to gain some far∣ther
intelligence of the circumstances
which occupied my mind incessantly,
determined me at once to accept it.
I went then, and met them at Florence,
where my uncle received me with as
much overacted civility, as when we
parted last he had treated me with super∣cilious
scorn.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="138"/>
I found him, however, not more rea∣sonable
than before : the prejudices that
had taken possession of his mind were so
strong that he was angry and amazed
that what made the whole business of
his life could be to any other person
matters of mere indifference. He talked
to me incessantly of remedies for the
gout, of the medicines he was taking,
and of their effects; told me how he
slept and how he eat; and read disser∣tations
without end on chronic disorders
in general; and from this discourse he
glided by some link which escaped
me, into his other favourite science, he∣raldry.
Oh! the quarterings and bear∣ings
which I was compelled to affect
hearing; the genealogies I was dis∣tracted
with; and the marriages and in∣termarriages
to which I appeared to listen,
while in fact I knew nothing of what he
said, and only endured this sort of mar∣tyrdom
in the hope of seeing Lady Cas∣tlenorth,
<PB N="129" REF="139"/>
who on my first visits did not
deign to appear.</P>
<P>All these latter harangues were, I
found, intended to impress on my mind
the pride and prudence which would at∣tend
a union with my cousin, his daugh∣ter,
and the advantage it would give me
above any other alliance I could form.
My patient acquiescence was imputed to
returning inclination for this boasted
connection; and when I was thought to
be sufficiently impressed with the ideas
thus meant to be conveyed to me, and
to be weaned from the weakness I had
betrayed, I was admitted, without any
solicitation however on my part, to the
honour of seeing Lady Castlenorth and
her daughter.</P>
<P>The elder lady was the only one of
them with whom I wished to have any
conversation, and her love of hearing
herself talk obtained me this favour, in
spite of all the displeasure she had con∣ceived
against me: but it was very dif∣ficult
<PB N="130" REF="140"/>
to bring her to converse on that
subject which alone interested me: she
would talk politics, or give me a disser∣tation
on the nature of the soul, or on
the eruptions of Vesuvius, descant on
the age of the world, or on her <HI>own</HI>
age,(if her auditors would allow her to
be not quite five and forty:) but of Ce∣lestina
she would <HI>not</HI> talk; and if ever I,
in spite of her evasions, introduced the
conversation, she affected to hear me
with horror, and to consider every men∣tion
I made of a person whom she called
so connected with me, as the most inde∣licate
and improper conversation with
which I could entertain her. She was
for the most part surrounded, when I
was admitted to her, with abbati, and
the oracle of a circle she had herself
formed, in which it was generally im∣practicable
to entertain her with any
other conversation than that she chose to
lead to.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="141"/>
Her daughter, who had formerly re∣ceived
me with so much haughtiness,
and who had since been offended in the
tenderest point, a point too in which
her extreme vanity had rendered her
particularly susceptible, affected no
longer the overweening pride which in
our first interviews had been so repul∣sive,
but a soft melancholy, which sits
well enough on some people, but was
in her more likely to move mirth than
pity: she seldom spoke to me; but when
she did, it was with the air of one whose
just indignation was conquered by
softer sentiments. I knew I never could
deserve those sentiments from her, and
therefore was very sorry to see them, even
though certain they were feigned.</P>
<P>But it was here only I could hope to
gain any information of the woman,
Hannah Biscoe, who pretended to have
lived with my mother near twenty years
since. Lady Castlenorth evaded, with
wonderful art, ever giving me any trace
<PB N="132" REF="142"/>
of this circumstance, and of her daugh∣ter
I knew it was in vain to enquire;
but there was a little smart Italian girl,
called Justina, who had attended on
Miss Fitz-Hayman for some time, and
who had been in England with her, and
I took occasion, as often as I could see
her, to say some obliging thing to her,
and sometimes to make her a trifling
present. Justina, in consequence of my
taking so much notice of her, began
officiously to put herself in my way;
and I believe her vanity prompted her
for some time to suppose I had very differ∣ent
motives for my attention than those
with which I was really actuated.</P>
<P>But in a foreign woman of that rank
even vanity usually yields to avarice.
When I had obtained an opportunity of
clearly explaining myself, Justina un∣dertook
to procure me a direction to the
woman whom I was so solicitous to
find. She produced it in about a week,
but artfully evaded my question as to
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
how she came by it. I sent off my own
servant instantly with it, determined to
follow him myself if the information as
to her place of abode proved to be true.
I received an account from him that a
few days before his arrival at the house
in Suffolk, where she was said to live,
she had removed from thence, and the
people either did not know or would
not tell whither she was gone.</P>
<P>This seemed so like an artifice of
Lady Castlenorth's to prevent my mak∣ing
the enquiry which she knew I had
so long and so earnestly desired, that I
could now no longer doubt but that
Justina had betrayed me: but during
this disquieting suspense time wore away,
and you, Celestina—what did you, what
could you think of me?</P>
<P>I entertained the strongest hopes, that
since Lady Castlenorth so industriously
kept me from the person she had herself
produced as likely to give me authentic
and indisputable testimony, that she knew
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
her evidence would not bear investiga∣tion,
and to this hope I eagerly adhered.
My mind, however, was too much irri∣tated
by the idea of such complicated
treachery to allow me to keep terms
with her as I had hitherto done: I was
wandering about Italy all the time of
Farnham's absence: on his rejoining me,
I went back to the residence of Lord
Castlenorth, and very peremptorily
taxed his wife with fraud. I denied
that Hannah Biscoe lived with my mo∣ther
at the period she pretended to have
done so; and that least I should disco∣ver
the deception, that she had been
sent away from the place where I had
with difficulty discovered her.</P>
<P>Lady Castlenorth affected the calm
indifference of injured innocence, the
proud consciousness of ill treated inte∣grity;
she affected to declare that she
was desirous of my seeing this Hannah
Biscoe, that she knew not of her depar∣ture
from the place whither she went,
<PB N="135" REF="145"/>
which was the house of a brother in law,
nor was in any way concerned about her;
"but," added she, rising and going to a
cabinet where she kept papers; "you
shall presently be convinced that she did
live with your mother in the year 1770."</P>
<P>She took out a letter, which I saw
immediately to be my mother's hand.
It was directed to Hannah Biscoe at
Mrs. Willoughby's, South Audley-street,
where my mother's town house then
was. These were the words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>I desire you will immediately on re∣ceipt

gave in a former letter were executed,
and how everything goes on there.</P>

<DATE>April 26, 1770.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>M. WILLOUGHBY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<PB N="136" REF="146"/>
<P>I returned the letter to Lady Castle∣north,
and expressed myself very warmly;
insisting upon it that from such evidence
nothing could be derived or even
guessed at: but she bade me, with a
contemptuous smile, remember, that
when I questioned this woman at Exe∣ter
she had told me, that you were for
the first months of your life nursed at
Kensington, whither she went almost
every day to see you, and that at five
or six months old you were sent abroad;
and when my mother went to the South
of France, on pretence of recovering
her health, eighteen or twenty months
after the death of my father, you were
conveyed thither, and there put under
the care of a friend, who placed you
soon after with the Superior of the con∣vent
of St. Celestine, at Hieres, as a rela∣tion
of her own.</P>
<P>The coincidence of this story, with
what I had heard before relative to Ma∣dame
Pellatier, struck me with more force
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
than any thing I had yet learned. I
left the house of Lord Castlenorth more
miserable than I had ever been before,
and again set out for Provence, hardly
knowing why, and not caring at all
what became of me.</P>
<P>Ever since that period, Celestina, I
have been wandering from place to place
in search of information which I cannot
obtain, and, which obtained, would cer∣tainly
render me wretched, if indeed
any wretchedness can be greater than
that which in my present state of mi∣serable
uncertainty it is my lot to suffer.</P>
<P>Are we then, Celestina, are we related
by blood? and is there an invincible
bar between us? Was my mother, that
admirable, that excellent, and almost
faultless woman, capable of living in a
state of continual dissimulation as to
you, and of hiding one fault by another,
which might have been followed by con∣sequences
so hideous to my imagina∣tion?
Oh! Celestina, it seems sacrilege
<PB N="138" REF="148"/>
to her memory to think it: yet her
aversion to my expressions of tenderness
towards you, her conduct in a hundred
instances I can recollect, her strong in∣junctions,
the promise she extorted from
me to marry Miss Fitz-Hayman—a pro∣mise
urged with such vehemence, even
in her last moments! Could the poor
consideration of pecuniary advantage in∣fluence
her then? did it ever influence
her? And the repetition of your name
with her last breath, mingled with words
that might be a prayer for you, but
which I have since thought was possibly
the fatal secret which she determined to
divulge only in death. The sad recol∣lection
of that scene, her countenance,
which I continually behold, her voice,
which murmurs still in my ears, all, all
contribute to empoison every moment
of my life, and to make that tender af∣fection,
that ardent love, which was
once the joy of my existence and the
<PB N="139" REF="149"/>
pride of my heart, the severest curse
with which heaven can pursue me.</P>
<P>Yes, Celestina, unless I dared in∣dulge
that fondness with which my
heart overflows, I would I could forget
you for ever, and determine never to see
you more, for I despair of ever seeing
you as I—Pardon me, I am lost in
the confusion of sensations I cannot de∣scribe;
and at this moment I hope so
miserable a being does not exist on this
earth. Write to me, Celestina: you
have more strength of mind than I have;
you are not, like me, the sport of ago∣nizing
passions. Write to me; tell me
what you would have me do farther to
unveil this sad mystery, or to throw it
from us for ever, if that may be. I
have told Vavasour what it appeared
impossible longer to conceal from him:
he is warmly my friend, and you may
employ him in any way in which you
think he can be useful. Celestina, I com∣mit
you to his protection! till—till
<PB N="140" REF="150"/>
when, heaven only knows; and I dare
not trust my pen with another word;
only I entreat you to write to me; and
may every happiness that virtue and in∣nocence,
and excellence like your's de∣serves,
ever be the portion of my Celes∣tina,

</LETTER>
<P>Thus ended this long letter, and thus
was explained the strange circumstances
that had cost Celestina so many tears. But
she wept not now: she read the letter over
twice: her first tremulous emotion sub∣sided;
but her stunned senses had not re∣covered
their tone. It was late; it was
cold; her candle had burnt nearly out.
She put the letter on her pillow; and un∣able
to undress herself, threw herself on the
bed in her cloaths, and lay pondering on
what she had read, on Willoughby's situa∣tion
and her own, till the tedious night was at an end.</P>

<PB N="141" REF="151"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>VAVASOUR, who had passed great
part of <HI>his</HI> night over a bottle, was not,
however, at all more disposed to sleep to∣wards
morning than if he had been in bed,
but at half after seven o'clock he sent the
housemaid to know if Miss De Mornay
was up, and, if she was, directed the ser∣vant
to give his compliments to her, and
let her know that he should take it as a fa∣vour
if she would allow him to speak to her
for a few moments before her other friends
were assembled.</P>
<P>Celestina had but just fallen into an un∣quiet
slumber, when she was awakened by
the maid who tapped at the door, from an
uneasy dream indeed, but from a change
of uneasiness. With her returning me∣mory,
<PB N="142" REF="152"/>
all the purport of Willoughby's let∣ter
returned; and Vavasour's message added
most painfully, the recollection that she
must discuss it all with him.</P>
<P>She ordered him to be told, that she was
not very well, and could not immediately
attend him: then shaking off the heavy
lassitude which uneasiness and want of rest
had occasioned, she called to her aid all
that strength of mind and rectitude of heart
with which she was eminently endowed by
nature; and having again read over Wil∣loughby's
letter, began to consider what she
ought to do.</P>
<P>With a doubt of such a nature on his
mind, she resolved, whatever it cost her,
never to meet him but as his sister; unless,
which was very improbable, the strong and
bewildering circumstances which had given
rise to such an idea could all be removed.
With so much purity did she love him,
that she felt, that were he happy with ano∣ther,
and his esteem and tenderness for her
undiminished, she could be content through
<PB N="143" REF="153"/>
life to find her felicity in witnessing his.
She resolved, therefore, after much debate
with herself and some pangs of unavoidable
regret, that since this dark and unpassable
barrier was raised, either by nature or by
artifice, between her and the only man she
had ever thought of with fond partiality,
she would never marry, but would leave
him at full liberty to compleat that union
with Miss Fitz-Hayman, which might at
once fulfil his engagement to his mother,
wean him from that lingering fondness
for her which it was folly if not guilt to
indulge, and retrieve his pecuniary con∣cerns
from those embarrassments which were
now hastening to overwhelm him.</P>
<P>Having formed this heroic and proper
determination, she endeavoured to com∣pose
her countenance, to quiet the agita∣tion
of her mind, and to meet Vavasour
with that degree of calm spirit which she
imagined, from past experience of his be∣haviour,
such a meeting would require.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="154"/>
This, however, was easier to imagine
than to execute. She wished indeed to
meet him without witnesses, because she
knew he possessed too little of that delicacy
which would teach him, to repress any
part of his knowledge before strangers, as
Mrs. Elphinstone and Montague Thorold
were to him: but when she opened the
door of the room where she knew he waited
for her, the blood forsook her cheeks, her
trembling hands refused the little exertion
necessary to turn the lock, her feet refused
to carry her forward, and she would have
returned without speaking to him for that
time, if he, who was eagerly waiting her
approach, had not heard her light foot steps
in the passage, and opened the door while
she yet stood hesitating at it.</P>
<P>He was struck by the fight of her swollen
and heavy eyes, the languor of her air, and
the paleness of her countenance; and his
usual address, which had more of warmth
and vivacity than elegance, was softened
by the real concern of which he was at that
<PB N="145" REF="155"/>
moment sensible. He took her hand,
which trembled within his as he led her to
a feat—"I am sorry," said he, "to see that
you are not well."</P>
<P>Celestina tried to speak, but could not.
Vavasour had but an indifferent notion of
administering consolation, nor could he
contrive to condole with her for what he
secretly rejoiced at himself; so that be∣tween
his dissembled concern and his un∣dissembled
satisfaction, he sat a moment or
two silent; and then remarked, that the
letter he had brought gave a very good ac∣count
of George's health.</P>
<P>Celestina, without having any very pre∣cise
idea of what she said, answered faintly,
yes; and by this time Vavasour added,
that it contained also, he supposed, like what
he had at the sametime received, the history
of a devilish awkward, mysterious business.</P>
<P>Celestina, who found herself unequal to
the conversation, thought it better to put
an end to it at once and for ever. She
therefore, by an effort of resolution, com∣manded
<PB N="146" REF="156"/>
voice enough to say—"Mr. Vava∣sour,
you understand undoubtedly that
every idea of the alliance between your
friend and me, is at an end for ever. As
for the reasons that exist against it, a thou∣sand
motives make me wish they may re∣main
secret; from this moment, therefore,
you will very much oblige me, by forbear∣ing
to speak of Mr. Willoughby otherwise
than as my best friend, and by concealing
from the world a secret, in which it can
have no interest, but which will give pain
to many to have divulged."</P>
<P>"Divulged!" cried he, laughing:
"what then do you suppose it is any se∣cret?"</P>
<P>"To be sure I do," she replied.</P>
<P>"Oh! yes," answered he, "that is
mighty likely, when Lady Castlenorth has
taken such pains to talk of it every where
already."</P>
<P>"Lady Castlenorth!" cried Celestina;
a faint blush rising in her pale cheek.</P>
<P>"Aye, to be sure," said Vavasour care∣lessly,
"that she did months ago. Why
<PB N="147" REF="157"/>
don't you know, that besides the interest she
had in dividing you and Willoughby, be∣cause
her daughter is in love with him it
seems, she always hated his mother; and
that death itself is no barrier against ma∣lice
like her's."</P>
<P>"Do you think it probable or possible
that this story may be entirely the effect of
that malice."</P>
<P>"Why faith no. I own I do not. You
know—at least people tell me so who
do know, that it was whispered about a
great many years ago, and even said, that
Everard was privately married to Mrs.
Willoughby. But what signifies talking
about it," added he, "seeing her again
change colour—"You have just been de∣siring
me to say nothing about it. George
seems to me to have made up his mind
about it: he will marry his cousin, and re∣trieve
his estates, as was his first plan; and
my fair Celestina" (and he took her hand)
"will look out for somebody else to trans∣fer
those affections to that he resigns."</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="158"/>
"No, Sir," said Celestina, withdrawing
her hand hastily from him, "they are not,
I assure you, so easily transferred."</P>
<P>"I am glad to hear it," replied Vava∣sour,
without being at all discomposed by
her manner; "for then I hope this pe∣dantic
young fellow, whom I find here
travelling with you, will not have the pre∣sumption
to suppose <HI>he</HI> has any chance of
obtaining them? Pray tell me—how
comes he here with you? is he any rela∣tion
of the people you are with?"</P>
<P>This was a question it was impossible for
Celestina to answer ingenuously. The
piercing and enquiring eyes of Vavasour,
inflamed and fierce from the late hours and
free use of wine the preceding night, were
fixed on her face. She changed counte∣nance;
felt that she did, and again her
complexion altered. The various emo∣tions
with which she was agitated, con∣sciousness
that she must no longer think of
Willoughby as a lover, yet could never
admit another to that distinction, conscious∣ness
<PB N="149" REF="159"/>
too that Montague Thorold must ap∣pear
in the eyes of the world to have suc∣ceeded
to that place, and anger that Vava∣sour
should thus presume on the confidence
of Willoughby to question her with a free∣dom
he had otherwise no pretensions to, all
combined to affect, to distress, and to de∣prive
her for a few moments of that pre∣sence
of mind, which, from the strength
and clearness of her understanding, was
usually at her command.</P>
<P>Vavasour, who, from the time he found
Willoughby must in all probability resign
her, made no doubt of succeeding to her
affections; who had no idea of the sensa∣tions
which pressed on her heart, from his
total inability to feel them himself; be∣came
irritated and impatient at the silence
his own impetuosity had occasioned. He
sat eagerly reading on her countenance the
emotions of her heart, and interpreting
them his own way: again he repeated his
question—"How came young Thorold
<PB N="150" REF="160"/>
with you? Is he related to these Elphin∣stone's?"</P>
<P>"You must enquire of him," Celestina
was on the point of saying; but the fear
least a quarrel between them should be the
consequence of her so answering, checked
her. She tried, therefore, to evade the
question. "Of what concern is it," said
she, "<HI>how</HI> he came hither. We were
talking of Mr. Willoughby. Pray tell
me—is he aware that our supposed relation∣ship
is talked of? Does he know the pains
Lady Castlenorth has been at to circulate
the story?"</P>
<P>"'Tis impossible for me to know that,"
said Vavasour, (as it really was;) "it is
much more in your way to tell me, how
this college boy came hither with you."</P>
<P>"I know no right you have to enquire
about it," answered Celestina faintly, "be∣cause
I cannot see that it is a concern in
which you are at all interested."</P>
<P>"You will give me leave then to make
my own conclusions; or rather," added he,
<PB N="151" REF="161"/>
in a louder voice, on seeing Montague
Thorold enter the room, "rather to inter∣rogate
the gentleman himself."</P>
<P>This was exactly what Celestina had been
most solicitous to avoid; the impetuosity
of Vavasour, the surprize and anger she
saw flashing from the eyes of Thorold, her
sleepless night and long agitated spirits,
the fear of she knew not what consequences
from these two inflammable spirits, and her
inability to check or repress those over
whom she had no pretence to assume any
authority, were together a combination of
cruel circumstances which might have
overcome a stronger mind than her's.
Mrs. Elphinstone was dejected from situa∣tion,
and languid from recent sorrow of her
own: to her, therefore, Celestina would in
any case reluctantly have applied; and now
she could not leave the room to seek her
without leaving together two men who
seemed so highly irritated against each
other that the first moment of her absence
would probably bring them to extremities.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="162"/>
To speak to Vavasour, was to address
the winds or the sea: she saw that he was
hardly sober, that he was incapable of feel∣ing
for her distress, or of listening to any
thing but his passionate impetuosity: it was
on Thorold alone she had any hopes of
prevailing; but in the moment of her de∣liberation
this hope seemed escaping her.</P>
<P>Before she could determine on what to
do, Vavasour had, in a manner at once
contemptuous and hasty, addressed himself
to Montague Thorold, and enquired how
it happened that he was at York attending
on Mrs. Elphinstone and Miss De Mornay?</P>
<P>"How it happens, Sir?" said Thorold.
"Is there then any thing so very extraor∣dinary
in it? May I not be at York or at
Canterbury?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Vavasour, "when you
are Archbishop of either; and then you will
be, for aught I know, in your right place;
but at present I think you in the wrong
one."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="163"/>
"What <HI>you</HI> think, Sir," replied Tho∣rold,
"is the last thing that ever can be
of any consequence to me; and if my ac∣tions
are, as I apprehend, of as little to
you, I imagine we can, find some pleasanter
topic than either the one or the other on
which to entertain this lady."</P>
<P>He then approached Celestina, who was,
he saw, ready to sink from her chair; and
softening his voice, said—"You are ill I
am afraid."</P>
<P>"No," replied she; "but I am alarmed
and uneasy; and I beg of you," continued
she, lowering her voice, "I beg of you
to keep your temper, let Mr. Vavasour say
what he will."</P>
<P>"I cannot promise that," said he in the
same tone; "but I can promise never vo∣luntarily
to do or say any thing that shall
give you a moment's pain. Do not be so
distressed, I beseech you; let me find Mrs.
Elphinstone. You tremble: you seem
ready to faint."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="164"/>
"I am indeed," replied she, "affected
from numberless causes. If you will be so
good as to call Mrs. Elphinstone, I will be
much obliged to you."</P>
<P>Thorold went immediately to obey her;
and Vavasour approaching her, cried—"I
see how it is; that young fellow is to con∣sole
you for the loss of Willoughby. Your
partiality to him I always suspected, and
am now too well convinced of it."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried Celestina, assuming
in some degree her usual spirit; "and ad∣mitting
it to be so, I do not really under∣stand
by what pretence you call me to an
account for it."</P>
<P>"By my own long and ardent affection
for you," cried he; "of which, however
you may now chuse to affect ignorance,
you cannot have been ignorant. I sacri∣ficed
it to Willoughby's prior claim, and
to your visible attachment to him; but I
am not humble enough to withdraw my
pretensions in favour of such a raw boy as
Montague Thorold."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="165"/>
"I am obliged to you, Sir," answered
Celestina, "for the predilection you avow
in my favour: though it cannot <HI>command</HI>
my affection, it demands my sincerity; and
I therefore assure you, that though I am
now perhaps at liberty, I have no intention
of engaging myself again. I shall hope to
be allowed to consider both you and Mr.
Thorold as my friends, while I absolutely
decline any preference to either."</P>
<P>The pride of Vavasour was hurt ex∣tremely
by this speech. Though he was
not personally vain, yet he had from his in∣fancy
been so accustomed to have his own
way, that opposition from any quarter was
new and insupportable to him. Mrs. El∣phinstone
and Thorold at this moment en∣tering
the room, he for once checked him∣self;
and breakfast being ready, he was in∣vited
to partake of it, which however he
declined, but told Celestina, on retiring,
that he must desire to see her again alone in
an hour.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="166"/>
Celestina now attempted to repress the
various emotions with which she was agi∣tated,
and to quiet the throbbings of her
heart. She sat down to the table, and tried
to eat, but could not; while Montague
Thorold, watching with eager fondness
every turn of her countenance, officiously
tried to engage her to partake of the break∣fast
that was before her.</P>
<P>As soon as she could, however, she with∣drew;
and after a moment's pause alone,
her scattered and oppressed senses were col∣lected
enough to bring before her all that
had happened, and tears, which she had
not hitherto been able to shed, came to her
relief.</P>
<P>Her reason too, came to her assistance,
and strengthened the resolution she had
formed after her first perusal of Willough∣by's
letter. But though she was able to
decide on what she ought to do herself,
she saw many painful circumstances likely
to be created by the violence of Vavasour,
and the impossibility of prevailing either
<PB N="157" REF="167"/>
on him or on Montague Thorold to leave
her and Mrs. Elphinstone to pursue their
journey with the others; or, what she
would still have preferred, of continuing it
without the attendance of either.</P>
<P>When the mind is oppressed with any
heavy affliction, the less serious evils which
at other times it can repel or submit to, are
felt with painful impatience. Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
drooping and depressed from her
past sufferings and future apprehensions,
could no longer interpose to check the
impetuosity of two young men, each of
whom thought himself at liberty to attend
on Celestina: while Celestina herself, who
never meant to encourage either, and whose
heart was so recently wounded by the dread
of having lost that protection on which she
was wont with fondness to rely, was yet
more unequal to the exertion which was
necessary to part these men, who were de∣termined
to look upon each other as rivals,
or to keep them within the bounds of ci∣vility
<PB N="158" REF="168"/>
if they persisted in remaining toge∣ther.</P>
<P>Anxious to proceed towards the house
of Cathcart, and to put her children under
the care of her brother, while she herself
tried to enter on some mode of life by which
to procure them a subsistence, Mrs. El∣phinstone
became impatient of any farther
delay; while Celestina, though equally
anxious to get forward, trembled at the
thought of a journey, which she foresaw
would produce a quarrel, and perhaps a
duel, before they had proceeded three
stages.</P>
<P>Sometimes she thought of leaving the
whole party abruptly, and going on as
speedily as possible alone: but besides her
unwillingness to leave Mrs. Elphinstone,
she foresaw that if she did, this Vavasour
would follow and overtake her; and Tho∣rold
would hardly content himself with at∣tending
her friend, while certain that Va∣vasour
was with her. After much consider∣ation,
therefore, nothing seemed to remain,
<PB N="159" REF="169"/>
but to endeavour to prevail on Thorold to
go forward without them; than which, no∣thing
seemed much more unlikely to suc∣ceed,
unless it was the same attempt on
Vavasour. She felt, too, a reluctance in
asking a favour of Thorold, which he
might interpret as encouragement she never
meant to give him; and was afraid that the
assurances she must make him in regard to
her total indifference towards Vavasour,
might afford him reason to hope, that to∣wards
him she would be less inexorable.</P>
<P>It was necessary, however, immediately
to make the essay; and therefore sending
for Mr. Thorold, she with trembling hesi∣tation
told him, that the letters brought by
Mr. Vavasour had been decisive in regard
to ending the intended alliance between her
and Mr. Willoughby. But she had hardly
uttered the word Willoughby, before the
countenance of Montague Thorold was
animated with all the warm hopes to which
this intelligence gave birth. She saw it
with concern; and with as much resolu∣tion
<PB N="160" REF="170"/>
as she could, besought him to attend
to her, while with a faultering voice, and
her tears with difficulty repressed, she went
on—"That I shall now never be the wife
of Willoughby is certain: but do not mis∣understand
me; I have determined never
to be the wife of any other person. I shall
go, for the rest of the winter, to Lady
Horatia Howard, and afterwards retire to
some village as remote as possible from
that part of England where I once ex∣pected
to pass my life. This resolution is
unalterable. But though I never can re∣turn
as you wish the favourable sentiments
with which you have honoured me, my
friendship, my gratitude, my esteem, it is
in your power to secure and—"</P>
<P>"Friendship! gratitude! esteem!"
cried Montague Thorold. "Can I be
content with such cold words: I, who can
never for an instant disengage my thoughts
from you; I, who worship your very sha∣dow,
and who cannot bear the thoughts of
quitting you even for a moment! Oh!
<PB N="161" REF="171"/>
Celestina! if ever the most pure and vio∣lent
love deserved a return—"</P>
<P>"Forgive me," cried Celestina, "if in
my turn I interrupt you. Do you not mis∣take
your sentiments, or, by an abuse of
terms, call a transient liking by that name
which ought to belong only to that refined
affection of the heart which leads us to pre∣fer
the happiness of another to our own,
and to sacrifice every inferior consideration
to the sublime pleasure of promoting that
happiness."</P>
<P>"Heaven and earth!" cried Thorold
impetuously, "and do I not feel that sen∣timent
in all its purity for you? Would I
not lay down my life to procure you any
real—almost any imaginary good."</P>
<P>"Prove it," interrupted Celestina,
"prove it by obliging me in the request I
am going to make: a request in which I
must not be refused, and which, before I
make it, you must absolutely promise to
grant."</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="172"/>
"I promise," returned Thorold, who
had at that moment no idea whither her
request tended, "I promise to obey you,
even though you desired my death. If the
sacrifice I make has any merit in your eyes,
how cheaply would your approbation be
purchased even by the loss of existence."</P>
<P>"All that is very absurd and very wild,"
replied Celestina. "What I ask you can
easily do, and ought to do without reluc∣tance."</P>
<P>"Name it," cried he, "and see how
well I can obey you."</P>
<P>Celestina then told him, that Vavasour,
fancying his friendship with Mr. Willough∣by
gave him a right to attend her, meant,
she feared, to go on with her and Mrs. El∣phinstone
to London; "And from the
dialogues which have twice passed between
you and him," added she, "there is rea∣son
to apprehend that your continuing to∣gether
may be attended with very unplea∣sant
consequences: neither Mrs. Elphin∣stone
or I have courage to encounter the
<PB N="163" REF="173"/>
sort of contention which may arise between
you: and to avoid the hazard of it, allow
us to thank you for all the trouble you have
taken for us, and now to bid you adieu till
we meet again in Devonshire."</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who from the mo∣ment
he understood her had listened with
impatience, now protested that the promise
he had just given could not be binding in
an instance that must be as injurious to his
honour as cruel, to his feelings. "Why
should you suffer this Mr. Vavasour," said
he, "to force himself upon you, while
you drive me from you? What is this chi∣merical
claim that he derives from Wil∣loughby,
who has resigned his own; and
how poor and spiritless must I appear, who
having been permitted that of seeing
you thus far on your journey, consent to
resign to another the honour of attending
you to the end of it: to another, who as∣sumes
a right no better founded than my
own; and to whom I am to give place
for no other reason but because he rudely
<PB N="164" REF="174"/>
demands it. You would despise me, Ma∣dam,
and I should deserve to be despised,
were I capable of so mean a desertion."</P>
<P>This was exactly what Celestina feared;
but persisting in her resolution to escape the
alarm to which she must be subject from
Vavasour and Montague Thorold's being
together during the journey, she told the
latter very calmly, that unless he consented
to oblige her, and to go forward under pre∣tence
of being obliged to return home,
that their acquaintance must here end for
ever.</P>
<P>Even against this, fear, his reluctante to
yield, or to appear, to yield the right of at∣tending
her to Vavasour, awhile supported
him. The dread, too, leaft Vavasour
should now succeed for himself, and that he
should see those hopes destroyed for ever
which he so fondly cherished since Willoughby
was out of the question, made him
resist still more forcibly the injunctions
Celestina desired to lay upon him. At
length, his fear of offending her, his real
<PB N="165" REF="175"/>
love for her, and the sight of her uneasiness;
her assurances that Vavasour never would
have any particular interest in her favour,
(though at the same time she bade him un∣derstand
that he had himself no better
claim,) and his wish to shew her how much
he preferred her satisfaction to his own,
prevailed upon him to sacrifice his pride
and his fears to her entreaties; and making
himself acquainted with the place where
she was to be with Mrs. Elphinstone in
London, where he obtained permission to
attend her as soon as she arrived, Monta∣gue
Thorold, though still reluctantly and
with great compulsion on himself, departed
alone, and on post horses pursued his way
to London.</P>
<P>Having thus prevailed on Thorold to
depart, Celestina again sat down to recol∣lect
her fatigued spirits. She had some
hours before determined to write to Lady
Horatia Howard, and accept of the invi∣tation
so repeatedly offered her, as soon as
she saw Mrs. Elphinstone safe in the pro∣tection
<PB N="166" REF="176"/>
and assistance of Cathcart, who was
to meet them in London.</P>
<P>This letter, therefore, she wrote, and
forwarded; and as neither the weather or
any other circumstance was now likely to
render their progress hazardous, Mrs. El∣phinstone
agreed that they would set out at
a very early hour the next morning.</P>
<P>The day, however, was of necessity to
be ended where they were; and it was
very certain that Vavasour would pass it
with them. He had ordered for them
every thing they were likely to have occa∣sion
for, in a stile infinitely superior to
what they would themselves have thought
of; and when they met at dinner, he re∣ceived
them as his guests, and when his
natural vivacity was heightened by that
sort of triumph that he felt on finding that
Thorold was gone, his exulting spirits
were such as to be cruelly oppressive both
to Mrs. Elphinstone and Celestina.</P>
<P>Incapable of entering into <HI>their</HI> feelings,
he had no idea of repressing his own. He
<PB N="167" REF="177"/>
fancied there no longer existed any obstacle
to his project in regard to Celestina; and
as that project had long been the first of
his heart, and had become doubly impor∣tant
from the opposition it had met with,
he concealed no part of the pleasure he felt
at what he fancied the absolute certainty of
its immediate accomplishment.</P>
<P>This was conduct that was insupportably
distressing to Celestina. He spoke without
scruple of the resignation Willoughby had
made of her hand, and seemed to have as
little delicacy as to the occasion of it. Of
an attachment to him, abstracted from
every idea of becoming his wife, Vavasour
had no idea; and Celestina had no courage
to urge it; so entirely did his want of feel∣ing,
and the proud certainty he shewed of
his own success, overwhelm her. All she
could do was, to entreat Mrs. Elphinstone
not to leave her with him, and to assist her
as much as possible in attempting at least
to check that assuming manner, for which
neither her former friendship for Vavasour,
<PB N="168" REF="178"/>
nor the regard Willoughby had for him,
could, in her opinion, offer any apology.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, for both her and
her friend, two young men of fortune,
much acquainted with Vavasour, arrived
at the inn early in the evening, and seeing
his servants, enquired for him, and were
shewn into the room almost as soon as din∣ner
was over. Celestina and her friend
took the earliest opportunity to withdraw;
and Vavasour's attention to his guests over
their wine, delivered them for the rest of
the evening from his company.</P>
<P>He had taken care, however, to inform
himself of all that related to their journey
the next day. But eager as he was to have
Celestina in the chaise with him, he was
compelled to desist from the request he at
first ventured to make, on her representing
the impossibility of her leaving Mrs. El∣phinstone;
to whom, though Vavasour
heartily wished her once more in the He∣brides,
he had at length the complaisance
to offer his place in his own chaise, as being
<PB N="169" REF="179"/>
more commodious than the hired ones to
be found on the road; and agreed, on her
acquiescence in that arrangement, to fol∣low
himself in a hack chaise with his ser∣vant.</P>
<P>The gentlemen who had passed the even∣ing
with him at the inn, were not less fond
of the pleasures of the table than he was
himself; and their orgies had been pro∣longed
till it was no longer worth while for
him to go to bed. With a very little al∣teration
of his dress therefore, and with a
great deal of wine still in his head, he was
ready in the morning to set out: but such
was his appearance, and such his manners
in consequence of his debauch the pre∣ceding
evening, that Celestina was more
than ever solicitous to avoid him; and had
it been possible for her to have thought of
him before with the slightest degree of par∣tiality,
his looks and his conversation of
this morning would have filled her with ter∣ror
and disgust.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="180"/>
As she travelled on, however, by the
side of her dejected friend, who had no
spirits for conversation, she could not, amid
all the reflection on her own circumstances,
which filled her mind, avoid considering,
with, melancholy regret, the situation of
this young man, who, with some talents
and many virtues, was thus yielding to the
wild current of passion and vice, and de∣stroying
his constitution and his fortune
before he knew the value of either. She
then with mournful recollection contrasted
his character with that of Willoughby,
who had once all his vivacity, tempered
with so much sweetness, so much attention
to the feelings of others; who had all his
generosity of spirit and openness of heart,
without any of his careless dissipation; and
whose brighter talents were not obscured by
vice, nor degraded by folly; and as all his
virtues, all his amiable qualities were enu∣merated,
her heart felt all the acuteness of
sorrow, in remembering too that under
their influence she had lost the hope of
<PB N="171" REF="181"/>
passing her life: yet the cruel pain of the
reflection that these hopes were now at an
end, was immediately mitigated, when she
considered, that this she might perhaps
still do, as his sister and his friend; but her
reason, however it began to recover its
tone, could never say any thing to her that
for a moment taught her to reflect with
pleasure, or even with tranquillity, on the
thoughts of his being united to Miss Fitz∣Hayman.</P>
<P>On reperusing Willoughby's letter, which
she had now acquired courage to study
more minutely, she saw with new uneasi∣ness,
what in the first tumult of her spirits
had escaped her, or at least made but a
slight impression—that he recommended
her particularly to the care and protection
of Vavasour; and that, as he had probably
intimated the same trust to Vavasour him∣self,
she should find it very difficult to dis∣engage
herself from his attendance.</P>
<P>The longer she dwelt on Willoughby's
expressions, the more she apprehended he
<PB N="172" REF="182"/>
was but too well convinced that the whole
story of their relationship did not originate
with Lady Castlenorth. She foresaw, that
while even the shadow of a doubt remained,
their union never ought to be thought of:
but having nobody with whom she could
properly discuss the various and contradic∣tory
ideas on this bewildering subject that
passed through her mind, she looked forward
with earnest impatience to the hour when
she should receive the maternal counsel and
soothing consolation which Lady Horatia
Howard alone was likely to afford her.</P>
<P>The journey, however, was to be per∣formed;
and though she carefully avoided,
during the two days that it lasted, being
alone with Vavasour, yet she suffered ex∣treme
pain from the encreasing conviction
that he presumed on Willoughby's total
resignation of her, and openly declared
that he thought himself a candidate for her
favour, whose fortune and pretensions of
every kind rendered him secure of success.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="183"/>
At length the party reached London,
and Cathcart received his sister and her
friend at the lodgings he had prepared, for
them on being informed of the time of their
arrival.</P>
<P>The meeting between him and Mrs. El∣phinstone
was too affecting to the already
depressed spirits of Celestina. She retired
early to her own room, having with diffi∣culty
prevailed on Vavasour to quit her,
and there endeavoured to acquire steadiness
to talk over with Cathcart, the next morn∣ing,
the purport of Willoughby's letter;
and then to take leave of him and her poor
dejected friend, as Lady Horatia Howard
had received with avidity the information
of her intended visit to her, and was to send
her coach for her at one o'clock on the
following day.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="174" REF="184"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning at length arrived, and
the friends who had so long found all the
consolation their circumstances admitted of
in being together, were now to part; un∣certain
when, or if ever, they were to meet
again. Mrs. Elphinstone, sinking as she
was under oppression of many present for∣rows
and future apprehensions, yet found
them all deepened by the loss of Celestina,
who had so generously assisted her in sup∣porting
them: and Celestina felt, that
when to soothe the spirits and strengthen
the resolution of her friend was no longer
her immediate task, she should dwell with
more painful and more steady solicitude on
her own singular and unfortunate situation.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="185"/>
Cathcart, warmly attached as he was to
both, from gratitude and from affection,
had no power to speak comfort to either.
Early in the morning he had met Celestina,
and gone through Willoughby's letter:
but though his mind sometimes strongly
resisted the idea of that relationship of
which it spoke, he had nothing to offer
against it; and could only sigh over the
incurable unhappiness with which he saw
the future days of friends he so much loved
would be clouded.</P>
<P>Silently they all assembled round the
breakfast table; but nobody could eat.
Cathcart tried to talk of Jessy, of his house,
of his farm, of his fortunate prospects, and
of his sister's two little girls, whom he had
taken home; but there was not one topic
on which he could speak that did not re∣mind
him of the obligations he owed to
Celestina and Willoughby, nor one idea
which arose unembittered with the reflec∣tion,
that they, to whom he was indebted
<PB N="176" REF="186"/>
for all <HI>his</HI> happiness, were themselves mi∣serable.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock Vavasour came into
the room in his usual way; enquired eagerly
of Celestina when she went to Lady Hora∣tia
Howard's, and when he could see her
there; and without waiting for an answer
to his enquiry, told her that he had that
morning met Sir Philip Molyneux, and
that Lady Molyneux had been in town
about a week. Every body who were re∣lated
to Willoughby was interesting to Ce∣lestina;
and from Lady Molyneux she had
always supposed more might be collected
than from any other person: but now her
mind was too much oppressed and too
much confused to allow her to distinguish
her sensations, or to arrange any settled
plan for her future conduct towards Lady
Molyneux. She received Vavasour's in∣formation,
therefore, with coldness; and
indeed her manners towards him were very
constrained and distant, which he either
did not or would not notice; rattling on in
<PB N="177" REF="187"/>
his usual wild way, though he saw the de∣jection
and concern of the party; a circum∣stance
that more than ever disgusted Ce∣lestina,
who began some time before to
doubt whether the credit which Vavasour
had for good nature was not given him on
very slender foundations: for to be so en∣tirely
occupied by his own pleasures and
pursuits as to be incapable of the least sym∣pathy
towards others, to be unable or un∣willing
to check for one moment his viva∣city
in compliment to their despondence,
seemed to Celestina such a want of sensi∣bility,
as gave her a very indifferent opinion
of his heart.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone quitted the room to
make the last preparations for her departure:
but Cathcart, who had fettled every thing
before, remained with Celestina and Vava∣sour.
He would have given the world to
have passed these moments in conversation
with her; but the presence of a third per∣son,
and especially of Vavasour, put an end
to all hope he had of an opportunity of
<PB N="178" REF="188"/>
explaining to her, with that tenderness and
caution which the subject required, some
circumstances relative to Willoughby's for∣tune,
which had lately come to his know∣ledge.
New embarrassments seemed threat∣ening
him; and a law suit, involving part
of the property which belonged to Alves∣tone
estate, seemed likely to encrease these
embarrassments; while the mortgagees
were gradually undermining the estate it∣self;
and the absence of the master en∣creased
the impatience and mistrust of those
who had claims upon it.</P>
<P>All this, Cathcart thought Celestina
ought to know; yet in their first interview
that morning he had not courage to tell
her of it, and now Vavasour left him no
chance of doing it; for while he yet deli∣berated,
the coach sent by Lady Horatia
Howard stopped at the door, and the mo∣ment
was come in which he was to take his
leave of her.</P>
<P>He took her hand, and kissed it with an
air of grateful respect; but he could only
<PB N="179" REF="189"/>
say—"I shall write to you in a few days,
and, I hope, give you a good account of
my sister and of Jessy."</P>
<P>"I hope you will," returned Celestina
faintly.</P>
<P>"And," added he, "you will of course
like to hear of all that passes material in our
neighbourhood?"</P>
<P>"Certainly I shall," replied she. "Adieu,
dear Sir. I cannot <HI>say</HI> much, but you
know what I feel for you all."</P>
<P>Vavasour had taken her hand to lead her
down stairs; but she disengaged it from
him, and said to Cathcart, as she gave it
to him—"Let us go to your sister." He
led her to the door of the room; where at
that moment Mrs. Elphinstone entered,
pale and breathless: her eyes were heavy,
and fixed on Celestina, but she did not
weep. Celestina's tears, however, were
more ready, and, as she embraced her
friend, they choaked the trembling adieu
she would have uttered, and fell in showers
on her bosom. The emotion was too pain∣ful;
<PB N="180" REF="190"/>
and Cathcart, desiring to end it for
both their sakes, disengaged his sister
gently from the arms of the trembling Ce∣lestina,
while Vavasour, again seizing her
hand, hurried her down stairs, and as he
put her into the coach, told her he should
call upon her the next day. She would
have besought him not to do it, as a liberty
he ought not to take in the house whither
she was going; but before she could suffi∣ciently
recover herself to find words, the
coach was driven away, and in a few mo∣ments
she found herself at the door of Lady
Horatia Howard, in Park-street, Grosvenor∣square,
and it became necessary for her to
collect her spirits, to acquit herself as so
much kind attention deserved.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia received her with un∣feigned
pleasure, and with a degree of ma∣ternal
kindness that set her almost imme∣diately
at ease with herself. She was put
into possession of her apartment, and bade
to remember that it was her's as long as she
would occupy it, and that her time was al∣ways
<PB N="181" REF="191"/>
ways to be her own. "I am going out,"
said Lady Horatia, "to dinner to-day. I
have a great notion you had rather dine at
home?" Celestina owned she had. "Be
it so then," replied she: "and whenever
you prefer being at home to going with
me, I shall be pleased at your using that
freedom, without which such a situation as
I am able to offer you would be not only of
no value but a species of slavery." While
she said this in the kindest manner, Celes∣tina
observed that she looked very earnestly
at her eyes, which were red with weeping;
and examined, with a kind of mournful
enquiry, her features, which bore traces of
the concern she had felt in parting from
her friends; and having thus examined her
countenance some time, her own, which
was remarkably expressive, assumed a look
of surprise tempered with concern; and
then, as if she checked herself, she rang
for her woman to receive orders about Ce∣lestina's
dinner, and while they remained
<PB N="182" REF="192"/>
together, she gave the conversation a more
general turn.</P>
<P>When Celestina was alone, she ran over
in her thoughts the transactions of the last
month, and wondered what Fate would
do with her next. But not of herself alone
she thought: Willoughby, unhappy and
unsettled; his mind thrown from its ba∣lance
by disappointment; his talents lost
in the bewildering uneasiness of uncer∣tainty,
and his temper injured by the cor∣rosive
anxieties of pecuniary inconvenience;
he, who had such a mind, such a heart,
such talents, such a temper; who deserved
every happiness, and yet had hitherto
known none; Willoughby, wandering
about the world to obtain confirmation of
a fact, which, when known, would only
complete his misery; was an object from
which the thoughts of Celestina could ne∣ver
a moment escape: and a thousand
times she wished she had never been born,
since to her, to whomsoever she owed her
<PB N="183" REF="193"/>
birth, Willoughby certainly owed his un∣happiness.</P>
<P>It was time to consider of obeying the
injunction he gave her, towards the close
of his letter, to write to him; but on this
subject she determined to consult Lady
Horatia Howard, as well as to ask her ad∣vice
in what way she should act in regard
to Vavasour, whose importunities she
dreaded, yet from whose visits she knew
not how to disengage herself.</P>
<P>Under such protection, however, she
knew that much of the inconvenience she
must in other circumstances feel from Va∣vasour's
behaviour would be obviated; and
that the sense as well as the situation of
Lady Horatia would prevent that improper
familiarity which, when she was only with
Cathcart or Mrs. Elphinstone, whom he
looked upon as inferior and as dependent,
it was too much his nature to assume.</P>
<P>With more complacency, she thought
of Montague Thorold, and always of his
father with a degree of affectionate reve∣rence.
<PB N="184" REF="194"/>
As to the young man, though her
heart never admitted, in regard to him, the
slightest tendency towards that sort of par∣tiality
which could ever grow into love, yet
she had received so many marks of real and
ardent attachment from him, she thought
so well of his talents, and so much better
of his heart, that she could never divest
herself of solicitude for his welfare. Per∣haps—for
in what heart, however pure,
does not some such weakness lurk—perhaps,
the stories she had heard of his former uni∣versal
propensity to form attachments, and
which were intended to prejudice her
against him, had an influence on her mind
of which she was herself unconscious, and
that her self-love, though no human being
ever appeared to have less, was gratified by
having thus fixed a man so volatile and un∣steady,
though she never could, nor ever
had given him reason to suppose she could,
return the passion she had thus inspired.</P>
<P>While there remained any hope of ever
seeing Willoughby such as he had once
<PB N="185" REF="195"/>
been, she had felt an utter repugnance to
suffer the assiduities of Montague Thorold;
but Willoughby's apparent neglect of her
for some time before she left the Isle of
Skie, and the little probability there now
was that they could ever meet in peace,
since the receipt of his letter, had gra∣dually
and almost insensibly accustomed
her to the attentions of Montague Tho∣rold:
and though she felt for him no∣thing
like love, she could not help being
sensible of a great difference in her senti∣ments
towards him and towards Vavasour.
One seemed to live only to obey and oblige
her; the other, presuming on the advan∣tages
of fortune, or on those which Wil∣loughby's
friendship gave him, appeared
rather to demand than to solicit her re∣gard—rather
to resent her neglect of his
suit, than court as a favour her acceptance
of it: and if Celestina had any fault, it
was a sort of latent pride, the child of con∣scious
worth and elevated understanding;
which, though she was certainly obscurely,
and possibly dishonourably born, she never
<PB N="186" REF="196"/>
could subdue, and, perhaps, never se∣riously
tried to subdue it. She felt, that in
point of intellect she was superior to almost
every body she conversed with; she could
not look in the glass without seeing the re∣flection
of a form, worthy of so fair an in∣habitant
as an enlightened human soul;
and could she have been blind to these
advantages, the preference Willoughby had
given her so early in life would have taught
her all their value.</P>
<P>It is not the consciousness of worth that
is offensive and disgusting, but the tribute
of respect that is demanded of others who
have perhaps no such conviction, and of
whom it is therefore unreasonable and ar∣rogant
to expect that they will acknowledge
what they cannot perceive. Nobody was
ever yet eminently handsome in person, or
eminently brilliant in intellect, who did
not feel from self evidence that they pos∣sessed
those advantages; though many, from
the infirmity and weakness of their tem∣pers,
<PB N="187" REF="197"/>
fancy they exist where none but them∣selves
can find any shadow of them.</P>
<P>Good sense, one prominent feature of
which is a due attention to the opinion and
to the self love of the rest of the world,
will rarely suffer those who possess it to ob∣trude
even real advantages on the notice
of others; and without good sense, little
distinction appears between the real bloom
of youth and beauty and the factitious
charms purchased at a persumer's: both
are, if not equally disgusting, equally de∣void
of all that can make them estimable
or valuable. Of this good sense, Celestina
possessed such a share, that conscious as
she was of that superiority of which she was
continually told, no village girl had ever
more unaffected simplicity of manners;
and while her mind was irradiated by more
than common genius, and her knowledge
very extensive for her time of life, she was
in company as silent, and as attentive to
the opinion of others, as if she had possessed
only a plain and common understanding,
<PB N="188" REF="198"/>
with no other cultivation than what a com∣mon
boarding school education afforded.</P>
<P>Her pride, therefore, so moderated, was
rather a virtue than a blemish, and taught
her to value herself, but never to despise
the rest of the world.</P>
<P>There was about her, too, much of that
disposition which the French call <HI>ameneté:</HI>
a disposition to please by seeming inte∣rested
for others; by entering into their
joys and sorrows, and by a thousand little
nameless kindnesses, which though they
consisted perhaps only in attending pa∣tiently
to a tale of sorrow, told by a
mourner of whom the world was tired or
who was tired of the world, or listening
with concern to the history of pain and con∣finement
related by the valetudinarian,
smiling at the fond enthusiasm of a mother
when she described the wit or beauty of a
darling child, or admiring the plans which
an improver had laid down for the altera∣tion
of his grounds, were all so many testi∣monies
of a good disposition, in the opi∣nion
<PB N="189" REF="199"/>
of those towards whom these little ci∣vilities
were exerted, that Celestina had
formerly had almost as many friends as ac∣quaintance
wherever she appeared. In
the circle where she was now to move,
more splendid even than that where Mrs.
Willoughby's kindness had placed her, it
was probable that under such introduction
as that of Lady Horatia Howard, all the
charms of her person, talents, and temper,
would be seen to the utmost advantage.</P>
<P>Unaccustomed as Vavasour was to look
far into consequences, he had discerned
this as soon as he heard of the invitation
Celestina had received; and he foresaw so
many impediments to the pursuit of his
wishes, as well from the severity and pru∣dery
which he had heard imputed to Lady
Horatia, as from the interference of rivals,
that he would very gladly have persuaded
her against accepting it, had he had any
pretence to offer for his objections: but
having none, and not daring to invent any,
he had confined himself to mutterings
<PB N="190" REF="200"/>
against prudish old cats, and representing
to Celestina that, she was going to confine
herself as an humble companion to bear all
the caprices of a superannuated woman of
quality. Celestina heard him at first with
concern, from an idea that he had heard
Lady Horatia misrepresented; but when,
on his afterwards repeating this conversa∣tion,
she found that he knew nothing of
her character even from report, and only
described her in so unpleasant a light from
his wish to deter Celestina from finding an
asylum in her house, anger conquered her
concern, and even her complaisance, and
she besought him in very strong terms ne∣ver
again to name Lady Horatia Howard
to her, unless he could prevail upon him∣self
to remember that she deserved, from
her character rather than her rank, the re∣spect
of every man, and particularly of
every <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Vavafour had desisted then from talking
of her in this style; but he was not at all
more reconciled to the abode Celestina
<PB N="191" REF="201"/>
had chosen; where, if he was admitted to
see her at all, it would probably be only
in the presence of those who would be little
affected with his professions of that love
which every day became a greater torment
to him, and little dazzled by that fortune
which he had to offer as the price of its re∣turn.</P>
<P>Celestina, however, to whom he had
repeatedly said that he would visit her,
thought she could not too soon apprize
Lady Horatia of her situation; and the first
hour they were alone together, Lady Hora∣tia
expressed such a desire to know all that
had passed in regard to Willoughby, since
she saw her on her journey into Scotland,
that Celestina, without hesitation, but not
without great emotion, related it all, and
put into her hands the letters received from
Willoughby.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia read them, and attended
with great interest to what Celestina related
of the sudden appearance of Montague
Thorold and the avowed pretensions of
<PB N="192" REF="202"/>
Vavasour; and after deliberating some
time, she smiled, yet not with a smile of
pleasure, and said—"It appears, my love,
as if you were only come to tantalize me
for a moment with your company; for be∣set
as you are by these young men, I see I
shall never be able to keep you long."</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam!" replied Celestina,
"neither Mr. Vavasour nor Mr. Thorold
can excite a wish in me to quit your protec∣tion
while it is convenient to you to afford
it to me; and for my first, my most beloved
friend! my—what shall I call him?—he
talks not of returning to England: and if
he does—"</P>
<P>"And if he does return," interrupted
Lady Horatia, "you must, and rightly
formed as your heart is, you do, I am sure
understand, that while the faintest mist of
doubt hangs over you, you ought never to
meet him, unless indeed one of you were
married."</P>
<P>"Allow me to ask, Madam," said Ce∣lestina,
in a tremulous voice, "allow me to
<PB N="193" REF="203"/>
ask your Ladyship, who were so well ac∣quainted
with Mrs. Willoughby, whether
from any recollection of remarks made in
her life time, you have any persuasion as to
the foundation of those doubts."</P>
<P>"You might have seen," replied Lady
Horatia, "from the purport of a letter I
wrote to you while you were in Scotland,
that I had even then heard rumours of the
cause of your separation from Willoughby,
which Lady Castlenorth had very indus∣triously
set forth. I judged, from what I
then heard, that if it was not true, her art
would be so effectually exerted that you
would never discover the deception; and
that you must be rendered unhappy. It
was therefore I advised you to detach your∣self
as much as you could from what is
childishly called a first love. I thought,
that what Mr. Willoughby was then said
to be on the point of completing—his
marriage with Miss Fitz-Hayman—was the
very best thing he could do, both for his
own sake and your's: for if it should be
<PB N="194" REF="204"/>
found you are related, the very idea is at∣tended
with too much horror to be dwelt
upon; and even if it is a fabrication of Lady
Castlenorth's, unless it can be clearly proved
to be so, your whole life might be embit∣tered
by it; besides, my dear Celestina,
how could Mr. Willoughby, circumstanced
as I understand he is in regard to money
matters, how could he afford to marry
you?"</P>
<P>Celestina sighed deeply from the recol∣lection
of the arrangements as to all those
affairs which Willoughby had so fondly
made, and to which she had so fondly
listened; then recovering herself, she re∣peated
her question, which she thought
Lady Horatia had evaded—"But has your
Ladyship any recollection of circumstances
in Mrs. Willoughby's conduct or life, that
give you reason to believe this unhappy
story may <HI>not</HI> be the fabrication of Lady
Castlenorth?"</P>
<P>"Not from my own knowledge," re∣plied
she, "for I was in Italy with General
<PB N="195" REF="205"/>
Howard, who was then in an ill state of
health, at the time Mr. Willoughby's fa∣ther
died and for two years afterwards.
When I returned to England, I was ab∣sorbed
in domestic uneasiness, and heard,
without attending much to them, those
gossipping stories which fly about for a
week or a month till some newer scandal
causes them to be forgotten. Yet I do re∣collect,
I own, hearing some hints of Mrs.
Willoughby's partiality for Mr. Everard,
and that they were supposed to be privately
married: but I accounted for it, when I
attended to it at all, by recollecting that
Mrs. Willoughby was, at the time of her
husband's death, a young and beautiful
woman, with a good fortune, and an ad∣mirable
understanding; advantages, which,
while they created envy and malignity in
the minds of an hundred people who pos∣sessed
nothing of all that, among her own
sex; produced as many pretenders to her
favour among the other; every one of
whom, though some were men of rank and
<PB N="196" REF="206"/>
all of course eminent enough in their own
eyes, were dismissed by her on their first
application with a polite but positive re∣fusal.
These men were piqued, and these
women were spiteful; and they together
found out a reason for the unheard of re∣fusal
of a young and admired widow, by
supposing her attached to her son's tutor;
not one of them, from the information of
their own hearts, being able to conceive it
possible that she made this sacrifice to ma∣ternal
tenderness, and refused her hand to
a second husband, because she would suffer
nothing to interrupt the attention she owed
to the children of the first."</P>
<P>"You do not then believe," said Ce∣lestina
eagerly—"you do not then believe,
my dear Madam, that there is any truth in
this odious story?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me," answered Lady Horatia;
"I did not say so."</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed Celes∣tina,
"is it possible you can believe it."</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="207"/>
"My dear young friend," said she
calmly, "I have lived so long in the
world, that though I do not hastily and on
slight grounds believe such a report, yet I
should not <HI>wonder</HI> were it in the event to be
verified."</P>
<P>Celestina, who had always in her own
heart opposed the idea of her being the
daughter of Mrs. Willoughby, though she
felt and submitted to the necessity of seeing
Willoughby no more while one doubt re∣mained
unsatisfied, now changed colour,
affected as well by the manner of Lady
Horatia as by what she said. She had not,
however, courage to press her farther, but
spoke of the visit intended her by Mr. Va∣vasour—"I
wish it were possible," said she,
"to convince him at once that I shall ne∣ver
listen to the proposal with which he is
pleased to honour me. As Willoughby's
friend," added she, and sighed, "I shall
be always glad to see him; but, in any
other light, never—".</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="208"/>
"I think you wrong however," replied
Lady Horatia, "in wishing so hastily to
dismiss him. He is a man of family, of
fortune, and, as you allow, not disagreeable
in his person; and for his morals, they are not
worse, I suppose, than those of other young
men; he is allowed, I think, to be generous,
good tempered, and not to want sense. If
every idea of Willoughby is at an end,
why not relieve yourself and him from a
state of uneasy retrospection by receiving
the addresses of one whom he cannot dis∣approve."</P>
<P>"Are you in earnest, Lady Horatia?"
cried Celestina.</P>
<P>"Certainly I am," replied she: "at
least, I venture very seriously to advise you
not to dismiss Vavasour so hastily, but re∣ceive
him as an acquaintance till you are
sure you disapprove of him as a lover."</P>
<P>"Dear Madam!" resumed Celestina,
"were I capable of giving away my hand
so lightly, is Mr. Vavasour a man who you
think could make me happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="209"/>
"Nay," replied Lady Horatia, "if
there is any body whom you prefer that is
another point: I only say, that if you feel
yourself perfectly disengaged, I cannot
think Vavasour ought to be dismissed
hastily. Perhaps half the young women in
London would think a more desirable match
could not offer."</P>
<P>This conversation was interrupted by
the entrance of a servant, who announced
the arrival of the person who was the sub∣ject
of it; and Vavasour immediately en∣tered
the room.</P>
<P>He condescended to pay to Lady Hora∣tia
more respect than he generally shewed
to those who were indifferent to him. Hers
was, however, that sort of company in
which he by no means found himself at
case; and his eagerness to entertain Celes∣tina
alone, once or twice broke through
the restraint which he imposed upon him∣self.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia, who was candid and li∣beral,
saw in him only an unformed and un∣steady
<PB N="200" REF="210"/>
young man, whose morals and man∣ners
required nothing but time and good
company to render estimable. She saw the
prejudice Celestina seemed to entertain to∣wards
him, as a mere prejudice; and on
his rising to depart, gave him a general in∣vitation
to her house.</P>
<P>Celestina, who knew the refinement of
her mind, and the delicacy of her taste, was
amazed at her seeming to approve him;
and when he was gone, ventured to say—"What
does your Ladyship think of Mr.
Vavasour?"</P>
<P>"Why really very well," replied she.
"He is very young, and quite unformed;
but with those giddy manners, and amid
that unpolished conversation, there is no
want of understanding."</P>
<P>Celestina again sighed. "No," an∣swered
she, "no want of understanding
certainly; for Willoughby was not likely
to select him for his friend had that been
wanting: but yet they were so unlike—so
very unlike—that I have often wondered at
<PB N="201" REF="211"/>
their long and intimate friendship. Vava∣sour
is so head long, so impetuous, so self∣willed,
and sometimes so boisterous, while
Willoughby, with more imagination, more
genius, more strength of understanding, is
so calm, so reasonable, so attentive to every
body—"</P>
<P>She was too much affected to proceed in
the catalogue of his virtues, a subject on
which she had hardly ever touched before;
but stopped, from the emotion she felt;
and Lady Horatia, who saw and pitied the
source of that emotion, changed the con∣versation.</P>
<P>Vavasour, flattered by the reception he
had met with from the present protectress
of Celestina, and more in love than ever
in proportion as she was in his opinion in∣finitely
handsomer now than ever, was
now very frequent in his visits; while Ce∣lestina's
whole mind was occupied by the
necessity she was under of writing to Wil∣loughby,
and the difficulty she was under
how to answer with propriety such a letter
<PB N="202" REF="212"/>
as that she had received from him. At
length, with many efforts, and more tears,
the letter was written and approved of by
Lady Horatia; and Celestina endeavoured,
in compliance with the wishes of her friend,
and with more earnestness than success, to
dismiss from her mind some of its corrosive
sensations, and to enter, if not with avidity,
at least with cheerfulness, into that style of
fashionable life, which, though she could
not always enjoy, she never failed to adorn.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="203" REF="213"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>VAVASOUR had been with her every
day since her arrival in town, which was
almost a week, and Montague Thorold had
never appeared. While Celestina at once
wondered at his absence and rejoiced at it,
(though perhaps her sensations were min∣gled
with a slight degree of mortification,)
for while she disdained every species of co∣quetry,
she yet felt humiliated by the sud∣den
cessation of that attachment which he
had taken such pains to convince her, could
not be destroyed even by despair.</P>
<P>Impatience, however, to hear of Wil∣loughby,
was still predominant in her
mind : and for this purpose she wished to
see Lady Molyneux. No acquaintance
subsisted between her and Lady Horatia;
<PB N="204" REF="214"/>
and therefore she determined to write and
beg leave to wait on her old friend. This
she executed in a note to the following
purport:</P>
<P>"Miss de Mornay being in town for a
short time, solicits permission to wait
on Lady Molyneux at any time when
her Ladyship may be disengaged."</P>
<P>This note was delivered to Lady Moly∣neux
in company. She read it, and as if
she had forgotten totally the claim Celestina
had upon her from their having been
brought up together, and from her mother's
fondness for her, she asked carelessly whe∣ther
the messenger waited for an answer;
the servant replied, that he did. Lady Mo∣lyneux
had formed an idea that Celestina,
of whom she had not thought for many
months, was now wandering about the
world in a dependent and inferior situation,
and might perhaps expect an invitation to
stay with her, which she had no inclination
<PB N="205" REF="215"/>
to give; she therefore in a cold and care∣less
way bade the footman tell the person
who brought the message, that being then
engaged with company she could not write
an answer, but would take an opportunity
of letting Miss de Mornay know when she
should be at home. She then entered again
into conversation with her guests; and it
was not till the next day that she remem∣bered
having heard from Celestina at all;
when seeing the note on her table as she
was going to dress for the opera, she gave
it to her maid, and bade her put her in
mind to send an answer to it and fix the
first morning she should be disengaged.</P>
<P>Celestina in the mean time received the
verbal answer to her note with more con∣cern
than surprise. She had not expected
much kindness from Matilda, who during
so many months had never once written to,
or enquired after her; but she could not
without internal anguish reflect that it was
the daughter of her more than mother, the
friend of her orphan youth, and the sister
<PB N="206" REF="216"/>
of Willoughby, who was thus insensible of
all those feelings which swelled her heart
when the scenes of that orphan youth, and
the pleasures of that infantine friendship,
were remembered.</P>
<P>Amid these painful reflections, however,
there was one that gave her some degree of
consolation. She thought that Lady Mo∣lyneux
could not, either from any know∣ledge
of her own, or from the reports
spread by Lady Castlenorth, believe that
any relationship by blood subsisted between
them; for she supposed it to be impossible
for her in that case to treat with so much
cold neglect a person whom she knew to be
her sister. On this, therefore, she dwelt,
as a circumstance favourable to the notion
she most wished to entertain ; and as two
or three days passed on without her hearing
from Lady Molyneux, her eagerness to
enquire of her subsided into a strong belief
that she knew nothing.</P>
<P>Vavasour assiduously attended every day
at the house of Lady Horatia during this
<PB N="207" REF="217"/>
interval, and contrived to obtain for him∣self
some degree of interest in her favour.
The openness and candour of his temper,
was with her an apology for half his faults;
while his youth and natural vivacity ob∣tained
his pardon for the rest. His fortune
was splendid, and his family ancient and
respectable; while his person was such as
could hardly fail to please; and his man∣ners,
careless and wild as they were, ap∣peared
to advantage in the eyes of Lady
Horatia; who had been disgusted by the
coldness and apathy, either real or affected,
of many of those young men of fashion
who frequented her house.</P>
<P>On Celestina, however, the frequent op∣portunities
she had of observing Vavasour,
had a very opposite effect. In <HI>her</HI> mind
a standard of perfection had been early
formed, and every man she now saw was
pleasing or otherwise as they resembled or
differed from Willoughby. She continued
therefore to treat Vavasour with encreasing
coldness and saw with concern that Lady
<PB N="208" REF="218"/>
Horatia was every day more solicitous for
his success.</P>
<P>Willoughby, in the mean time, conti∣nued
to wander about Europe without any
fixed plan, and merely flying from himself.
Still anxious to gather information on the
subject which had destroyed all the happi∣ness
of his life, and having little hopes of
obtaining any but by means of Lady Cas∣tlenorth,
he often conquered his reluctance,
and visited his uncle at a villa he now inha∣bited
near Naples; where he was always
received with pleasure, and where, save
only on the point which alone interested
him, Lady Castlenorth seemed to descend
from her natural character, to endeavour
by every means in her power to gratify
and oblige him: and her lord, who really
loved his nephew as much as his imbecility
of mind allowed him to love any body,
and who saw in him and in his alliance
with his daughter, the only chance of per∣petuating
a family which was the great ob∣ject
of his pride, became hourly more ea∣ger
<PB N="209" REF="219"/>
to see him, and more gratified by his
company.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that there are two
reasons which equally operate in determin∣ing
some people to marry—love and ha∣tred;
and something resembling both these
sentiments agitated the heart of Miss Fitz∣Hayman.
Of an involuntary preference to
her cousin, she had been sensible from the
first moment she saw him; and his indif∣ference,
his preference of Celestina, and
even his positively declining the honour of
her hand, had mortified without curing her
of her partiality; though resentment and
disdain were mingled with the inclination
she could not conquer, and which neither
his absence nor his coldness. had prevented
from gaining on her heart. When she saw
him again, new force was given to this
passion: he was less handsome, less ani∣mated;
but more interesting and more
pleasing; while his melancholy and dejec∣tion,
though created by another object,
gave him so many charms in the opinion
<PB N="210" REF="220"/>
of Miss Fitz-Hayman, that her pride
yielded to them; and as it was now very
certain that he had no attachment but to
Celestina, whom, since she fully believed
their relationship, she knew he never could
marry, she doubted not of being able to
inspire him with an affection for her, and,
in returning to England his wife, of ful∣filling
at once her parents wishes and her
own.</P>
<P>Lady Castlenorth, whose love of intrigue
time had by no means diminished, and
whose arrogance had been deeply wounded
by the failure of her original plan, which
she fancied Willoughby would with so
much eagerness have embraced, was now
doubly anxious to avail herself of the ad∣vantage
she had gained by having pre∣vented
the intended union of Willoughby
and Celestina. Pique and resentment ope∣rated
upon her mind with even more force
than attachment and regard would have on
another. Besides, in the marriage of her
daughter with any man of superior rank
<PB N="211" REF="221"/>
and independent fortune, she found great
probability that her influence would be les∣sened
and her government disclaimed; but
in uniting her daughter with Willoughby,
whose fortune was in disorder and whose
temper was remarkably easy, she foresaw
the continuation of her power, and that she
should neither see her daughter take place
of her, or escape from her influence.</P>
<P>Whatever was the wish of her friends,
the assiduous Mrs. Calder officiously
adopted; and when she found how much
Lord Castlenorth had set his heart on con∣cluding
the marriage between his daugh∣ter
and her nephew, she applied all her
rhetoric to prove its advantages, and all her
art to secure it's success.</P>
<P>Willoughby was unconscious of the plans
that were thus forming in the family of his
uncle, and did not think it possible that
their pride would allow them to solicit again
an alliance which he had once declined:
he therefore went to them without any ap∣prehension
that he was encouraging ex∣pectations
<PB N="212" REF="222"/>
he never meant to fulfil, and
had indeed no other design than to lay in
wait for traces of that involved mystery,
which he still thought had been created by
the intrigues and machinations of Lady
Castlenorth.</P>
<P>In art, however, she was so much his
superior, that the very means he adopted
to obtain satisfaction, was, in her hands, a
means of bewildering more deeply. She
now affected the most perfect candour; and
whenever she saw him touching with a ten∣der
hand on the subject, she appeared to
feel for his uneasiness, and ready to give
him every satisfaction in her power.</P>
<P>Willing to avail himself of this apparent
disposition in his favour, he one day, when
he was sitting alone with Lady Castlenorth,
asked her, whether she had now no traces
of Hannah Biscoe, the servant who alone
seemed possessed of the circumstances into
which he most wished to enquire. Lady
Castlenorth answered with great apparent
ingenuousness, that she did not exactly
<PB N="213" REF="223"/>
know, as she had no connection at all with
her, but that if he wished to make any en∣quiry,
her woman should write out the di∣rections
to her relations, which she did not
herself recollect.</P>
<P>Willoughby eagerly seized on this offer,
and begged that these directions might be
immediately written out for him. Lady
Castlenorth instantly called her woman,
and questioned her as to her recollection of
the abode of the relations of this Hannah
Biscoe; the woman named what she knew;
her lady directed her to put it down, and
Willoughby left the house, flattering him∣self
that he had at length obtained a clue
which might lead him to escape from the
labyrinth of error and mistake where he
had so severely suffered.</P>
<P>It was, however, by no means Lady
Castlenorth's plan to suffer Willoughby to
return to England in search of this woman,
whose direction she seemed so willing to
give him; and as from the eagerness and
agitation he expressed on receiving this pa∣per,
<PB N="214" REF="224"/>
it appeared but too likely that he me∣ditated
going himself, in order to preclude
the possibility of his views being again
frustrated, she found that all her art would
be necessary to prevent his escaping her.</P>
<P>Fortunately for her views, Lord Castle∣north
was seized a few hours afterwards
with one of those illnesses which had so of∣ten
reduced him to the brink of the grave;
and the presence of his nephew, which he
so earnestly desired, the generous and feel∣ing
heart of Willoughby could not deny;
while he endured the cruellest restraint in
staying, and thought every hour an age
till he could go himself to England, and
renew his hitherto hopeless research after
the real situation of Celestina.</P>
<P>Thus passed, however, a month after the
arrival of Celestina in London; and then
the arrival of an English gentleman at Na∣ples
brought him her letter, written in an∣swer
to that she received at York. Nothing
could equal the impatience with which he
had expected this letter, but the pain he
<PB N="215" REF="225"/>
felt at reading it. He learned by it that
she was returning to London, where he fan∣cied
so many objects would combine to
soften her concern for their separation;
and he fancied the letter expressed too
much calmness, and that she submitted to
the separation which he had himself indi∣cated
as too likely to be inevitable without
feeling half that regret and anguish which
he expected she would have described.
The reluctance she expressed to be left to
the protection of Vavasour, made him be∣lieve
his presence interfered with her pre∣ference
to some other person—a preference,
of which the very suspicion threw him into
agonies at the very moment his reason
told him that he ought not to think of her
for himself. Jealousy now added to the
pangs of disappointed love, and the letter
which Celestina had endeavoured to word
so as to calm and sooth him, and to teach
him to submit to that necessity of which he
allowed the force, seemed to him to
breathe only indifference, and to prove that
<PB N="216" REF="226"/>
she saw him, without regret, relinquish his
claim to those affections, which were al∣ready
in possession of another.</P>
<P>All his sufferings were confirmed and
encreased, when a day or two afterwards
he had an opportunity of conversing with
Mr. Jarvis, the gentleman who brought
the letter, and who was hastening to Rome.
He had been often in company with Celes∣tina
at parties where she attended Lady
Horatia Howard; and believing, as all the
world now did, that Willoughby was cer∣tainly
to be married to Miss Fitz-Hayman;
and that the marriage of Celestina would be
a subject of satisfaction to him, he related
without hesitation the reports he had heard
of her being soon to give her hand to Mr.
Vavasour.</P>
<P>To the amazement Willoughby expressed
at the first intimation of such a match, Jar∣vis,
who entirely mistook it's cause, said—"Yes,
it is wonderful to be sure, consider∣ing
all we know of Vavasour, that he should
seriously intend to marry."</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="227"/>
So acute was the pain which the intelli∣gence
Willoughby had just received gave
him, that he could make no answer to this;
and Jarvis fancying him out of spirits for
some reason or other which he never
thought of enquiring after, soon after left
him to meditate on what he had heard.</P>
<P>There was "room for meditation even
"to madness," when he recollected a thou∣sand
circumstances that had till now ap∣peared
of no moment; he was convinced
that Vavasour had long admired Celestina;
he had himself resigned her, or at least in∣timated
that he dared not think of her;
and the person, the fortune, the impetuous
ardour of Vavasour, which his agitated
mind represented as irresistible, now all
crouded on his recollection, and he doubted
not but that before he could reach England,
Celestina would have given herself away.</P>
<P>Yet with the horrid mystery unremoved,
on what pretence could he wish or even
think of impeding a marriage with a man
of whom his regard was evinced by his long
<PB N="218" REF="228"/>
friendship, and who had so affluent a for∣tune.
As a lover, he could himself no
longer interfere; as her relation, he could
not bear to consider himself; and were he
only such, an alliance with Vavasour could
not be objected to on any reasonable
grounds.</P>
<P>The longer he reflected, therefore, on
what he had heard, the more unable he
became to support his reflections; and they
concluded in a resolution to set out imme∣diately
for England; a determination which
he communicated to his uncle the same
day, who was affected by it even to tears.</P>
<P>Lady Castlenorth had, in conversation
with Mr. Jarvis, heard the report of Celes∣tina's
intended marriage, and knew imme∣diately
how to account for the extreme un∣easiness
Willoughby betrayed, and his
sudden resolution to depart for England.
When Jarvis, who proceeded immediately
on his journey, was gone, she found an
opportunity a few hours afterwards to speak
to Willoughby on English news, and the
<PB N="219" REF="229"/>
change of his countenance confirmed her
conjectures. This was an occasion not to
be lost; she ventured, what she usually
avoided, to name Celestina, and to express
her satisfaction that she was likely to be so
well married. "After all the conversation
there has been about this young person,"
said she, affecting to have a great deal of
feeling for her, "I am very glad that the
poor girl will be so well established. A man
of Vavasour's independent fortune can well
afford to please himself; and I doubt not
but that you and Lady Molyneux must on
every account rejoice at her change of
name, and that nothing more will be said
of her origin." Though Lady Castlenorth
affected to speak with sentiment, and to
sosten her voice, her piercing and en∣quiring
eyes were demanding from the
countenance of Willoughby that explana∣tion
which she knew it would give of his
real sentiments; and she saw the blood for∣sake
his cheeks, his lips turn white and
tremble, and a mingled expression of doubt,
<PB N="220" REF="230"/>
fear, anger, and disdain, marked on his fea∣tures.
"If I were certain, Madam," said
he, "that all the odious reports, on which
<HI>you,</HI> who first promulgated them, have in∣variably
refused to satisfy me as you might
do—if I were sure they were all true—"</P>
<P>"If!" interrupted Lady Castlenorth:
"can you then doubt their truth? Will
you compel me to make, by adducing
those proofs, a matter public which you
ought on every account to wish might be
buried in eternal oblivion?"</P>
<P>"Will I compel you, Madam! Yes
surely I will if the means are in my power.
'Tis for this only I have been so much with
you; not to compel you indeed, but in
the hope of prevailing upon you, if you
really possess the evidence you have often
meditated, to give it me all without re∣serve."</P>
<P>"Well," cried Lady Castlenorth, "I
have now given you a direction to the only
person who is in possession of this evidence.
You might have procured it as long since as
when I interfered to save you from the hor∣rors
<PB N="221" REF="231"/>
of a marriage which must have ren∣dered
you and the object of your unhappily
placed affection miserable for ever: but
then you flew from me, and resented my
friendship as if it had been an injury.
Since that time it is not my fault if you
have been unable to find this person, whom
I have never secreted, and of whom I know
little or nothing. Satisfied in having saved
you from an abyss of guilt and misery, I
trusted to time and your own principles to
convince you of the injustice your suspicions
did me. You have searched for prooss in
those places where your mother is said to
have been with her young charge: tell me,
have you ever found any reason to believe
the facts I told you of to be of my inven∣tion—to
have been totally unfounded?"</P>
<P>Willoughby was conscious he had not;
yet at the same moment he discovered that
Lady Castlenorth had watched him, and
knew of the journies he had made to Hieres
and to other places. Vexed and angry,
not knowing what to think, or whether he
<PB N="222" REF="232"/>
was imposed on by her superior cunning,
or was needlessly tormenting himself in
pushing the enquiry farther, he could not
command the various uneasy sensations
with which he was agitated; and therefore
abruptly leaving the room, he hastened to
his lodgings, and gave directions for his
immediate departure for England.</P>
<P>He was concerned, however, for his un∣cle,
and returned in the evening to take
leave of him: he found him sitting with
Mrs. Calder, who was reading to him a
sort of <HI>catalogue raisonnée</HI> of the various ills
to which the human body is subject; and as
they passed in melancholy review before
him, he stopped her to. consult her on his
own symptoms, and to enquire of her whe∣ther
she did not think such and such com∣plaints
were about to add to his bodily in∣firmities.
Mrs. Calder, who was always
obliged to every body who fancied her
skill enabled her to answer such questions,
was delighted with the opportunity this af∣forded
her of exhibiting her knowledge to
<PB N="223" REF="233"/>
Willoughby, from whom she could never
procure the smallest voluntary attention;
and the conversation became so irksome,
that having waited near an hour, and see∣ing
it not likely to end, Willoughby at
length started up and approached to take
his uncle's hand, when Miss Fitz-Hayman,
in all the languor of unhappy love, swam
into the room.</P>
<P>On her entrance, Willoughby sat down
again, as being unwilling to have her
suppose he rudely fled from her approach.
She put on an air of affected humility, and
looked as if she thanked him for even this
slight mark of attention. She gave a loud
and deep sigh, prolonged as much as pos∣sible;
her eyes, robbed of their fire, were
turned mournfully upon him—"You are
going from us, Mr. Willoughby?" said
she, in a subdued and faint voice.</P>
<P>He replied, that business, which could
not longer be delayed, made his return to
England necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="234"/>
Another deep sigh was all the lady's an∣swer
to this information: but Lord Castle∣north
cried—"I am sorry to hear you say
so, George—very sorry. I did hope that
we might have all returned together as soon
as my complaints subside a little. As to
business, you ought to remember that all
your money matters might be easily settled
if you pleased."</P>
<P>"I thank you, Sir," replied Willough∣by,
who saw whither the discourse would
tend; "but those matters are the least of
my concern."</P>
<P>"Stay, however, one day," said Lord
Castlenorth, "that you may execute some
business for me. Surely, nephew, you will
oblige me so far."</P>
<P>Though every hour's delay was death to
him, he at length agreed, on his uncle's
repeated entreaties, to stay four and twenty
hours longer at Naples; and then leaving
the room, he was followed by the officious
Mrs. Calder, who desiring leave to say half
<PB N="225" REF="235"/>
a dozen words to him alone, he suffered
her to shew him into another room.</P>
<P>She put on a most rueful countenance,
stroked her handkerchief, plaited her ruf∣fles,
and uttering an "oh dear!" between
a sigh and a groan, she continued thus—"My
dear good Sir! I wish to have a lit∣tle
conversation relative to your situation in
this dear worthy family, for every member
of which my poor heart bleeds."</P>
<P>"And yet, Madam," interrupted Wil∣loughby
impatiently, "there is, perhaps,
hardly a family among your acquaintance
who are, in the opinion of the world, so little
objects of compassion."</P>
<P>"The world!" exclaimed the lady.
"Lord bless me, what signifies the opinion
of the world. The world cannot see as I
do into all their feelings. There's your
most excellent uncle, as worthy a man as
ever existed, sinking, poor good dear
man! under five complaints, all incurable,
and denied, alas! the only satisfaction this
world has to give him—seeing his darling
<PB N="226" REF="236"/>
daughter settled to his wishes, which would
smooth his path to heaven, and leave him
nothing but bodily pain—which is severe
enough—nothing but bodily pain, as I ob∣served,
to contend with. Oh! Sir, what
heart felt satisfaction it must be to you!
what comfortable reflection for a good heart,
such as inhabits your breast no doubt—I
say, what delight it would be to you, to
hold forth the amiable hand that should—
<Q>Rock the cradle of reposing age,</Q>
and sooth the latter days of so excellent
and worthy an uncle."</P>
<P>The whine, and the hypocritical gri∣mace
with which this speech was delivered,
would have conquered the gravity of Wil∣loughby
at any other time: but he now
felt his disgust irritated by impatience,
amounting almost to rage; but he repressed
his feelings with difficulty, unwilling by
opposition to lengthen the conversation,
which Mrs. Calder suffered not to languish,
but thus went on—"Ah dear! what a me∣lancholy
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
reflection, as I observed, it is, to
consider, that, poor good man, this is not
likely to happen; and instead of it, this
darling daughter, this fine young woman,
heiress to such a noble fortune, so beauti∣ful,
so accomplished, so elegant—undenia∣bly
the first match in England in point of
rank and beauty and fortune—so lovely in
person, so amiable in mind, so elevated in
understanding—far, alas! from being happy,
sees her youth pass away in a hopeless pas∣sion,
which from her infancy she has been
taught to cherish, and which now her rea∣son,
aided by her affronted pride, tries in
vain to repress. Oh! Mr. Willoughby!
Mr. Willoughby! the happiness that you
refuse, by how many would be courted!
The heart that you disdain to accept, by
how many would be adored! Dear crea∣ture!
when I see how thin she is grown,
and know the cause of it so well!—when I
hear her sigh, and know how injurious it is
to her dear delicate constitution, I really
Sir—you will forgive my zeal—have looked
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
upon you with amazement, and have asked
myself whether you have eyes—whether
you have a heart—"</P>
<P>"To what, Madam," interrupted Wil∣loughby,
who could no longer endure her
harangue patiently—"to what does all this
tend?"</P>
<P>"Tend, dear Sir!" replied Mrs. Calder;
"why certainly to open your eyes if possi∣ble
to a sense of the happiness you are throw∣ing
away; to prevail on you to answer the
expectations of all your friends, to consult
your own interest, and to become all you
ought to be."</P>
<P>"You mean well, I conclude, Madam,"
answered Willoughby, "by all this; but
you mistake greatly, when you suppose
that the alliance to which you allude would
contribute to the happiness of any of the
parties for whom you are interested. I
have no heart to offer Miss Fitz-Hayman;
and if the partiality which you represent
exists any where but in your own imagina∣tion,
it would be ungenerous to encou∣rage
<PB N="229" REF="239"/>
and unworthy to avail myself of it,
feeling as I do that I never can answer it
as I am very willing to allow the young
lady's merits deserve: excuse me, there∣fore,
if I entreat of you never to consider
me as being likely to be more closely united
with the family of Lord Castlenorth than I
at present am, and to declare to you, that
by persisting in pressing it, my uncle will
put it out of my power to testify for him
that regard and affection which I really
feel."</P>
<P>Willoughby then left the room; and
Mrs. Calder, piqued and mortified at the
little success of her rhetoric, went reluc∣tantly
to give an account to Lady Castle∣north,
by whom she had been employed,
of the ill success of her embassy.</P>

<PB N="230" REF="240"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>WILLOUGHBY, notwithstanding
every effort and every art made use of to
detain him, pursued his way to England:
but at Paris, the fatigue he had undergone,
and the anxiety which had so long weighed
on his spirits, combined to throw him into
one of those fevers, to which, from his in∣fancy,
he had been subject; and for three
weeks he was in the most imminent dan∣ger.
Amid the wild ravings of the delirium
that perpetually occurred during the seve∣rest
paroxysms of the complaint, he called
incessantly on Celestina; and complaining
that Lady Castlenorth had taken her from
him, entreated of his servant, a man who
had lived with him for some years, to send
for her that he might see her before he died.
<PB N="231" REF="241"/>
This, in the simplicity of his heart, his faith∣ful
attendant would have done, having no
idea that any thing could be of more conse∣quence
than the wishes of his dear master,
for whose life he was so cruelly alarmed;
but when he asked him whither he was to
send, Willoughby put his hand on his
heart, sighed deeply, and replied, either
that he did not know or that it would be of
no effect; for that, indifferent what be∣came
of him, she had already refused to
come to him, and was gone to Scotland
with Vavasour.</P>
<P>When the violence of the disease subsided,
he ceased to name her; and his servant,
afraid of renewing his recollection, care∣fully
avoided any hint of what he had
dwelt upon during his delirious ravings.
Slowly, and with two relapses, he recovered
strength enough to proceed to Calais; but
nine weeks had elapsed since the informa∣tion
he had received from Vavasour; and it
was near three months after that time before
he arrived in London.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="242"/>
His first enquiry was after Vavasour,
who was, he found, in Staffordshire; and
his heart was relieved by the intelligence,
for he dreaded least he should have met
him in London, perhaps married to Celes∣tina.
His next was after his sister, whom
he still loved, and in favour of whom he
was willing to forget all the neglect he had
experienced from her, as well as the causes
of displeasure given him by her husband.</P>
<P>After Celestina he feared to ask by a di∣rect
message to herself, and he therefore
sought somebody who could tell where she
now was, of which he concluded he should
have intelligence from Lady Molyneux.</P>
<P>Lady Molyneux attended his summons;
and while he embraced her, with tears of
fraternal fondness, from a thousand tender
recollections that crouded on his heart, he
saw her equally unmoved by their meet∣ing
and unconcerned at his illness, of which
he still retained melancholy proofs in his
altered countenance and reduced figure.
He took an early opportunity of turning
<PB N="233" REF="243"/>
the discourse on Celestina; and saw, with
encreased amazement, that far from be∣ing
interested in the enquiry which had
occupied his whole thoughts so long,
Matilda was perfectly indifferent about it,
or if he moved her a moment from the still∣ness
of fashionable apathy, she shrunk from
the subject with something like disgust;
seemed afraid of the trouble of investiga∣tion,
and careless how it might terminate;
wishing rather to hear nothing about it,
than to hazard—not the tarnishing her mo∣ther's
honour, for to that she seemed in∣sensible,
but the probability of being obliged
to own for a sister, one whom she had
hitherto considered as a dependent; and
of seeing her brother, from a point of ho∣nour,
undertake to provide for her as a re∣lation.
Avarice, the heterogeneous child
of selfish vanity, was become a leading
feature in the character of Matilda: she
found so many uses for money in adorning
and in indulging herself, that she loved no∣thing
so well, except the adulation it pro∣cured
<PB N="234" REF="244"/>
for her; and so much power has this
odious passion to pervert the heart, that
instead of feeling concern in contemplating
the sunken features and palid cheek of her
brother, she could not, nor indeed did she
attempt to check, a half formed idea of the
pecuniary advantage she should receive
from his death.</P>
<P>While such were her thoughts, Wil∣loughby
asked her when she had last seen
Celestina?</P>
<P>"Oh!" replied she, "I have seen her
only once in a room, and that was by acci∣dent.
I was never at home when she called;
and I hate that old Lady Horatia Howard
that she lives with, and so took no great
pains to meet them when I returned her
visit. I have seen her though in public five
or six times lately, but the girl seemed to
me so very much altered, and to give her∣self
such intolerable airs, that I rather
shunned than sought her.</P>
<P>"Airs!" cried Willoughby. "She must
indeed be greatly changed if she deserves
<PB N="235" REF="245"/>
such censure: but tell me, Matilda—what
kind of airs?"</P>
<P>"Oh! the airs of a beauty," answered
she, "which you first taught her to assume,
and which she has made a tolerable pro∣gress
in, since this old cat of fashion has
taken it into her head to make such a fuss
about her, and since she has been surrounded
with such a set of senseless boys. There's
your friend Vavasour constantly one of her
suit, and there was a notion of his being
fool enough to marry her, but I fancy that
was given out merely by her exorbitant
vanity, for I dare say Vavasour knows
better."</P>
<P>The heart of Willoughby sunk within
him; but he was unable to express what he
felt; and Lady Molyneux went on—"However,
I have heard since, I think,
that the girl has been addressed by another
young fellow—one of the Thorolds I
think—whom I have lately seen with her,
which would be more suitable and more
likely to be a match."</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="246"/>
"You have seen her then often?" said
Willoughby, in a faint and faultering
voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, in public," replied his sister;
"but I have had no conversation with her."
Lady Molyneux then changed the con∣versation,
and soon afterwards left her bro∣ther
more unhappy than she had found him.</P>
<P>He was by no means able to see Celes∣tina
in his present state of wretched uncer∣tainty:
yet to know that by traversing two
or three streets he could once more behold
her, once more gaze on that lovely coun∣tenance,
and hear that voice so soothing,
so enchanting to his ears; was to him a state
of tantalizing misery, from which he knew
nothing could relieve him but detecting
the falshood of Lady Castlenorth's report;
and this he could only hope to do by ano∣ther
journey into Yorkshire, in order to
find that Hannah Biscoe to whom he now
thought he had certainly obtained a direc∣tion,
and this he proposed doing immedi∣ately.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="247"/>
Celestina, however, surrounded by crouds
of admirers; Celestina, forgetting all the
tenderness she once felt for him and render∣ing
all his researches fruitless even if they
proved to him that he might again plead
for the renewal of that affection, was an
idea that unceasingly tormented him; and
so painfully did the intelligence affect him
which Lady Molyneux had given, that the
ferment of his spirits produced a return of
his fever; in a slighter degree, but still so
as to confine him to his room; where, in a
few days, he received a visit from Vavasour.</P>
<P>Vavasour was totally unconscious of the
species of distress which Willoughby suf∣fered;
and since he himself had resigned
her, and agreed to complete his engage∣ments
with the family of Castlenorth, for so
his conduct had been generally understood
in England, had no notion that the ad∣dresses
of another, and particularly of his
friend, could be otherwise than pleasing to
him. He began, therefore, without re∣marking
the concern and coldness of Wil∣loughby,
<PB N="238" REF="248"/>
imputing it only to his visibly
deranged health, to relate to him his own
views in regard to Celestina, and to com∣plain
of her preference of Montague Tho∣rold.
"The devil take me," said he, "if
there is in England or in Europe another
woman for whom I would take a fifth part
of the trouble which this bewitching girl
has already given me. Curse me if I am
not ashamed of myself when I think what
a whining puppy she has made of me; ten
times I have left her, and ten times have
returned, to prove to her that she might
use me like a dog."</P>
<P>"Miss de Mornay," said Willoughby,
in a voice affected by the various sensations
he felt—"Miss de Mornay must be greatly
changed, Sir, if she is become capable of
any improper levity towards any gentle∣man
who professes regard for her▪ at the
same time you will recollect, Mr. Vava∣sour,
that she is mistress of herself, and at
liberty to reject those whose offers may not
be acceptable to her. From the experi∣ments
<PB N="239" REF="249"/>
which you have been pleased to
make, (though from our long friendship I
should rather have expected you to have
applied to me before you made them)—from
the experiments you have been pleased
to make, it seems clear that Miss De Mor∣nay
has no favourable intentions towards
you, and I would advise you by all means
to decline the pursuit."</P>
<P>"May I perish if I do!" replied Vava∣sour,
with all his usual impetuosity. "No,
George, unless it can be made to appear
that young Thorold—that little curatizing
fellow—without a shilling, and with no∣thing
but his impudence and scraps of plays
to recommend him, has better pretensions
than I have, curse me if I will give it up!"</P>
<P>This second intimation of Celestina's en∣couraging
the addresses of Montague Tho∣rold,
was a second dagger in the sick heart
of Willoughby. He dreaded an explana∣tion,
which, while it might serve perhaps
to subdue all his fears as to Vavasour,
might create others equally insupportable.
<PB N="240" REF="250"/>
He could not, however, remain many mi∣nutes
in the breathless agitation of such sus∣pence,
and therefore said—"I really don't
know any thing about Thorold. I hardly
recollect that there was such a man."</P>
<P>"What!" exclaimed Vavasour; "not
know him? Not know that she went im∣mediately
from Alvestone to the house of
that old priest his father."</P>
<P>"Yes," answered Willoughby, "that
I certainly knew; for it was by my request
that the elder Mr. Thorold became her
guardian."</P>
<P>"Well, nothing was so natural, I sup∣pose,
as for his reverence to delegate the
trust to his son; and as his deputy; I sup∣pose
it was, that he went with his ward to
Scotland, and was her guardian all the
time she was among the highlands and the
islands."</P>
<P>"Impossible!" cried Willoughby. "He
did not—could not have been there."</P>
<P>"He was by heaven!" exclaimed Va∣vasour;
"and when I met Celestina, with
<PB N="241" REF="251"/>
your letter, at York, I found that young
fellow attending on her and Mrs. Elphin∣stone:
but <HI>I</HI> was authorised by yourself to
wait on her; and I obliged <HI>him</HI> there to re∣sign
a post, which, when I think of his
having so long filled, and apparently with
her approbation, by all that's diabolical I
could tear his puritanical soul out!"</P>
<P>Nothing that Willoughby had ever felt
was equal to the anguish which pressed on
his heart at this moment. The coldness
he fancied he had found in Celestina's last
letter was now accounted for; and all the
warmth of grateful praise, with which in
her former letters she had spoken of Mr.
Thorold, was imputed to her growing af∣fection
for his son. Lost as she might be,
and probably was to him for ever before
this intelligence, unless he could content
himself with that share of sisterly affection
which was all she ought to bestow, there
was something so terrible to his imagina∣tion
in her feeling a warm attachment to
another, that he could not think of it with∣out
<PB N="242" REF="252"/>
horror, nor conceal from Vavasour the
effect it had upon him. His mildness of
manners forsook him; and speaking less
like himself than like Vavasour, whose ve∣hemence
he seemed to adopt, he cried, in
a voice that trembled with passion—"How
dared he pretend to Celestina!"</P>
<P>"He not only dared then," interrupted
Vavasour, "but dares still; and has con∣trived
to get Lady Horatia Howard to be
of his party. He has fascinated the old
woman with his piety and his poetry, and
I see very plainly that the young one will
throw herself away upon him unless you
prevent it."</P>
<P>"May I perish," cried he, "if I do
<HI>not!</HI>" Yet at that moment the recollection
too forcibly occurred to him that he had no
right to prevent it, unless by urging a claim
as her relation, from which his soul recoiled.
So painfully acute were his present sensa∣tions,
that he was unable to breathe, and
without attending longer to the exhorta∣tions
of Vavasours who eagerly pressed him
<PB N="243" REF="253"/>
to interfere immediately, he abruptly left
the room, and sent by his servant a mes∣sage
to Vavasour, saying he found himself
so ill that he was gone to bed; but should
be glad he would call again for an hour in
the evening.</P>
<P>Instead, however, of attempting to pro∣cure
that repose which his encreased fever
required, he went to the trunk where Ce∣lestina's
letters were deposited, and with
trembling hands taking them out, he ran
them over, even from the first she wrote to
him after their separation, to the last which
Mr. Jarvis had delivered to him at Naples.</P>
<P>His apprehensive jealousy so powerfully
awakened, now taught him to fancy, that
from the moment of Celestina's acquaint∣ance
with Montague Thorold, her letters
had become gradually cooller, and that
the last too plainly evinced her cheerful ac∣quiescence
to that reluctant and only con∣ditional
resignation, which <HI>be</HI> had with so
much anguish of heart been compelled to
send her, while he explained the cruel cir∣cumstances
<PB N="244" REF="254"/>
that had torn him from her and
from happiness.</P>
<P>The longer he dwelt on her letters, the
more this idea was strengthened, and the
more insupportable it became. His illness,
originally occasioned by anxiety, returned
upon him; and though without delirium,
his fever was nearly as high as when he was
in so much danger at Paris.</P>
<P>He now determined to send to Lady
Horatia Howard; and he attempted to
write to her. But he could hardly com∣mand
his pen, and found himself wholly
unequal to the more difficult task of com∣posing
such a letter as could alone be pro∣per.
He threw away the paper in despair;
and calling his servant, ordered him to
find out immediately some means of be∣coming
acquainted with the servants of
Lady Horatia Howard, and procure intelli∣gence
of what visitors were most at the
house, particularly if a Mr. Thorold of De∣vonshire
was there often.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="255"/>
The man hastened to enter on a task by
no means difficult to him. He contrived
the same afternoon to introduce himself to
one of the footmen of Lady Horatia at the
porter house he frequented, and learned
that his mistress and her young friend, of
whom he spoke as of an angel, were gone
for a fortnight or three weeks on a visit into
Oxfordshire; that Mr. Vavasour used to be
a good deal at the house when first Lady
Horatia came to town; that now he was
much less frequently there; but that Mr.
Thorold was there almost every day, and
read to the ladies whole evenings; who,
since these reading parties at home, went
much less into public than they had done
before.</P>
<P>This intelligence distracted Willoughby
by redoubling every apprehension he had
felt. The man, however, was sent back
for further information, and bade to ask if
Mr. Thorold was of their party in their
present journey, and if there was any talk
<PB N="246" REF="256"/>
among the servants of an intended marriage
between him and Miss De Mornay.</P>
<P>In answer to these queries, he had the
mortification of hearing that Montague
Thorold was to meet the ladies at Oxford;
and that it was, in the family, generally
understood that he was the accepted lover
of Celestina, and highly approved by Lady
Horatia.</P>
<P>It was now that the corrosive jealousy
that had long tormented him had a decided
object, and fixed with the most envenomed
power on the heart of Willoughby. The
impossibility of his interfering, to prevent
Celestina giving herself to another while he
himself remained in such a situation as the
present, and dared not even see her; the
little probability he saw of removing the
doubts that distracted him; and the appre∣hensions
least if they were for ever effectu∣ally
withdrawn Celestina would rejoice that
they were so; the cruel idea of Montague
Thorold's possessing that heart which he
once knew to be all his own, and the pre∣ference
<PB N="247" REF="257"/>
of that elegant mind of which he
had with so much delight contemplated the
improvement; were thoughts that inces∣santly
pursued and tormented him: and he
had no means of obtaining any information
of the conduct of Celestina, or of her return
to town, but by his servant, who was now
employed whole days to gather from the do∣mestics
of Lady Horatia, intelligence,
which, when obtained, served only to en∣crease
his misery.</P>
<P>The anecdotes he gathered from his sister
served too but to aggravate his distress: yet
when he saw her, (as he generally did once
every day,) from whatever point the con∣versation
sat out, it always ended in questions
about Celestina: and Lady Molyneux,
who had insensibly familiarised her mind to
the idea of her brother's dying a bachelor
in consequence of his early disappointment,
now saw with concern that his attachment to
Celestina, though it prevented his marrying
any other, was yet so rooted in his heart,
that should he find, as she believed he
<PB N="248" REF="258"/>
would, the imagined relationship a mere
fiction, he would most undoubtedly return
to her with more ardour than before they
were parted: and notwithstanding the em∣barrassed
state of his affairs, which every
day became more serious, would marry her,
and disappoint every view of fortune—en∣crease
of fortune—which her avaricious am∣bition
foresaw might otherwise accrue to
her.</P>
<P>Actuated, therefore, by very different
motives, she co-operated with Lady Castle∣north
in endeavouring to divide him from
Celestina; and while one was strengthening
the barrier raised between them, the other
was trying to convince Willoughby that he
ought not to wish for it's removal.</P>
<P>The means of doing this were, she
thought, to keep him at a distance from
Celestina, and to pique his pride by repre∣senting
her as attached to another. The
first point was for the present secured by his
illness; and she took care so artfully to in∣sinuate
the second, that aided as she was by
<PB N="249" REF="259"/>
the report of Vavasour, and by the conti∣nual
repetitions of what he had seen on the
journey from Scotland, that every hour the
fatal impression sunk, deeper into his heart,
and his reason, or his reliance on Celestina's
affection, had not sufficient power to resist
it.</P>
<P>Thus passed five or six days after his ar∣rival
in London. He endeavoured to shake
off his illness; for by a journey into York∣shire,
which he could not till it was con∣quered
undertake, he could alone hope to
obtain any satisfaction as to the original
cause of their separation. Yet even from
thence he now no longer dared to look for∣ward
to happiness, which even while he
was employed in attempting to regain it,
seemed escaping from him for ever.</P>
<P>But that he might undertake something
to relieve himself from the wretched state
he was now in, he put himself into the care
of a physician, and set about getting out of
an illness he had hitherto neglected or ra∣ther
indulged. Though very languid, and
<PB N="250" REF="260"/>
with a great deal of fever still about him,
he went to Lady Molyneux's; and in a
day or two afterwards, as he found himself
better from change of scene and of place,
he accompanied her on some of her visits,
and called in at a card party, where she
told him she must shew herself for a quarter
of an hour. The rooms were full; and
Lady Molyneux being, notwithstanding her
declaration that she should stay so short a
time, set down to a card table, Willoughby
sauntered into one of the apartments where
the younger part of the company were
seated at a commerce table; where the first
person that met his eyes was Celestina, ele∣gantly
dressed and more beautiful than ever,
with myriads of charms playing round her
face, and cheerfulness and pleasure dancing
in her eyes; while on one side sat a young
man whom Willoughby immediately recol∣lected
to be Montague Thorold, and on
the other another gentleman, who, though
he seemed to be more a stranger to her, was
<PB N="251" REF="261"/>
evidently charmed with her, and unable to
keep his eyes from her face.</P>
<P>Fixed to the place where he stood un∣heeded
among some other idle people who
were looking on, he remained gazing at
her for several minutes. His legs trembled
so that it was with difficulty he supported
himself, and his heart beat as if it would
break. He debated with himself whether
he should speak to her, or retire unob∣served;
but while he yet argued the point,
a smile and a whisper that passed between
her and Montague Thorold determined
him to fly from the torments he felt, and
which he found it almost impossible to en∣dure
another moment: he stepped hastily
away to find his sister and entreat her to
go; but so deeply was he affected, that,
weakened as he was by illness, he staggered,
and might have fallen, had not the shame
of betraying so much weakness lent him re∣solution
to reach a chair, where he sat a
moment to recover breath and recollection.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="262"/>
Mortified tenderness and disappointed
love gave him for an instant a sensation re∣sembling
hatred. He fancied he could
quit Celestina never again to feel any inte∣rest
in her fate; but, leaving her to the
man she preferred, strengthen himself
against his fatal and till now invincible
attachment, by contemplating the fatal
barrier which he had so long been try∣ing
to destroy, and to believe that artifice
rather than nature had placed between them.
Of this cause of their separation, no part
had in fact been removed; and he re∣proached
himself for the absurdity, folly,
and even vice of his present conduct. Hav∣ing
argued himself into what he thought a
resolution to feel no longer for Celestina,
he hurried to Lady Molyneux, and told
her, that if her game was not nearly at an
end, he must leave her and go home in a
chair, as he found himself unable to bear
the heat of the room.</P>
<P>His sister answered, that she was only
settling her winnings, and would attend
<PB N="253" REF="263"/>
him in a moment if he would wait for her.
He agreed to do so, and going to the door
that led out of that into the next room, he
leaned against the side of it, turning his
eyes as much as possible from the apartment
where Celestina was.</P>
<P>Lost in the painful sensations inflicted by
distracting jealousy and bitter regret, which
he yet struggled to stisle, he distinguished
not the objects: all, to him, uninteresting
that moved before him. A croud of young
people, however, who had just risen from
their table, were pressing into another
room where refreshments were distributed.
He moved a little to make way for them,
when he saw, close to him, and even borne
against him by her companions, Celestina
herself. Her face was at first turned from
him; for she was speaking to Montague
Thorold, who was on the other side; but
finding herself crouding against somebody,
she turned to apologise for the rudeness she
was guilty of, when the well known figure,
the well known face of Willoughby, ema∣ciated
<PB N="254" REF="264"/>
and pale as they were, instantly
struck her. An involuntary and faint
shriek testified the impression they made;
and Willoughby, who caught the weak
sound of her distressful voice, was at first,
by an irresistible impulse, hurried to her
assistance; but seeing the arm of Montague
Thorold supporting her, and his counte∣nance
expressing all the interest he took in
her emotion, heimputed that emotion to her
consciousness of her attachment to her new
favourite; and darting at her a look of im∣patient
reproach, he forced himself through
the croud, and without looking back, sat
down breathless and trembling by Lady
Molyneux, who was that moment coming
forward to meet him.</P>
<P>The agitation of poor Celestina could not
be concealed, nor could she for a moment
or two escape from the enquiring eyes of
those who remarked it. As soon, however,
as she could disengage herself from the
throng, she sat down, hardly daring to en∣quire
whether what she had seen was real or
<PB N="255" REF="265"/>
visionary. She had returned from Oxford∣shire
with Lady Horatia only the evening
before, and knew nothing of Willoughby's
being in England; while, in addition to
the amazement the sight of him occasioned,
his apparent ill health impressed her with
concern, and the displeasure with which he
surveyed her, with terror.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who had seen Wil∣loughby,
and whose eyes were never a
moment away from Celestina, knew at once
the cause of her distress. He followed her,
little less affected than she was herself, to a so∣pha
where she had thrown herself, and asked
her, in a faint and tremulous voice, if he
should fetch her any thing? she answered
"if you please," so low that he scarce dis∣tinguished
what she said; but stepping a
few paces from her, he took a glass of le∣monade
from a servant and brought it to
her. She took it, and carried it to her
lips, almost unconscious of what she did,
while Montague Thorold leaned over the
arm of the sopha on which she sat, and
<PB N="256" REF="266"/>
watched the emotions of <HI>her</HI> countenance,
with all the solicitude he felt strongly
painted on his own.</P>
<P>At the same moment Willoughby ap∣peared,
leading Lady Molyneux through
the room. The first objects that he saw as
he approached the door, were Celestina and
Montague Thorold: but having once seen
them, he turned hastily from them; and
seeming to give all his attention to his sister,
he disappeared.</P>
<P>Celestina's eyes followed him with a look
of inexpressible amazement and concern.
She seemed to be in a fearful dream; and
when she no longer saw him, her eyes were
fixed on the door through which he had
gone out. She heeded no longer what
Montague Thorold said to her; but sat,
with a palpitating heart and oppressed
breath, till Lady Horatia, after twice
speaking to her, roused her from her half
formed and confused reflections by remind∣ing
her it was time to go.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="267"/>
She followed, in silence, where Lady
Horatia led, and at the coach door wished
Montague Thorold good night; for the
only distinct sensation she felt, was a wish
for his absence: but Lady Horatia, who
was immediately going home, desired him
to return and sup with her; which, without
knowing what he did, he consented to,
though too conscious while he did it that
Celestina had rather be without him, for as
he handed her into the coach, he felt her
tremble so that she could hardly support
herself, and he heard the deep sigh burst
from her heart as if it would break.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia had not seen Willoughby,
and had no idea of Celestina's sufferings.
She talked therefore in her usual way of the
people they had seen, and of some books
that had been recommended to her; till
observing that Celestina, who usually bore
her part in the conversation, did not answer,
she enquired if she was not well?</P>
<P>"Pretty well, I thank your Ladyship,"
replied Celestina; "but I am uncommonly
<PB N="258" REF="268"/>
fatigued to-night, and have the head ach."
This answer satisfied Lady Horatia, who
continued to address herself to Montague
Thorold, till they arrived in Park-street;
where Celestina would immediately have
gone to her own room, so unfit was she for
conversation and so unable to sustain it;
but Lady Horatia ordering her woman to
bring a remedy for the head ach, of which
Celestina had complained, and that had be∣fore
been of service to her, she, rather than
alarm her kind benefactress, sat down near
the supper table to wait for it.</P>
<P>But so great an effect had the violent
though short perturbation of her spirits had
on her countenance, that Lady Horatia
immediately perceived it. "The head
ach!" cried she in surprise, and taking Ce∣lestina's
hand: "my dear, you have surely
something worse the matter with you than a
common head ach"</P>
<P>"Pray, dearest Madam," replied Celes∣tina,
"pardon me if I am utterly unable
to say what is the matter. To-morrow I
<PB N="259" REF="269"/>
shall be better, and I know you will for∣give
me till then."</P>
<P>The manner in which she uttered these
few words, as, trembling and faint, she ad∣vanced
towards the door, alarmed and sur∣prised
Lady Horatia. She saw, however,
by the countenance of Montague Thorold,
that he could explain the cause of Celestina's
uneasiness; she therefore suffered her to de∣part,
and immediately made the enquiry of
him.</P>
<P>He instantly informed her of what he had
seen; and with no favourable description of
the looks and manner of Willoughby,
which had indeed appeared to him to be
extremely cruel and insulting towards Ce∣lestina.
Lady Horatia, with whom Wil∣loughby
was no favourite, and who ex∣tremely
disliked his sister Lady Molyneux,
saw his conduct in the same point of view
as Thorold represented it; and, after some
conversation on the subject, said, that
though she was much concerned for the
shock Celestina had received, yet that upon
<PB N="260" REF="270"/>
the whole it might perhaps be better for
her that this circumstance had happened.
"For now," said she, "I think she will,
possessing, as she does, so much proper
pride, be convinced, that even if the story
coming from Lady Castlenorth has no
foundation, as I myself suppose it has, that
still she ought not to indulge her early pre∣judice
in favour of a man, who, whatever
<HI>he</HI> may have pretended or <HI>she</HI> may have be∣lieved,
never intended to act honourably
by her, and now not only deserts but in∣sults
her."</P>
<P>Thorold heartily assented to this opinion,
and sat down to supper with a heart some∣what
relieved from the extreme uneasiness
which the emotion of Celestina on the ap∣pearance
of Willoughby had given him.
Still, however, he could not eat, he could
not converse; but as soon as he could dis∣engage
himself, he took leave of Lady
Horatia, and full of anxiety, and trembling
least all the hopes he had of late so fondly
cherished should be blasted, he returned to
his lodgings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, in retiring to her own
room, had hoped to recall her scattered and
oppressed spirits, and clearly recollect all
that had befallen her; but the angry, the
disdainful look which that countenance
wore where she had been accustomed to see
only the smiles of approbation or the ten∣derly
anxious looks of love, was the image
still most prevalent in her mind, joined to
the painful idea of the ruined constitution
of him whose life was ever dearer to her
than her own.</P>
<P>The cruelty of his being in London, of
his going into public without ever having
seen or wrote to her, sunk deeply into her
heart. "Ah! Willoughby," exclaimed
she, "is it thus we meet again after such
<PB N="262" REF="272"/>
a parting? Is this the end of all your as∣surances,
that you would ever be my friend?
that you would learn to consider me as your
sister if we were indeed related? alas! is it
thus then you throw me off entirely, and
seem sorry to remember that you ever saw
me?" A flood of tears followed this cruel
reflection; but after weeping some time,
her pride came to her relief: she remem∣bered
the haughty neglect with which Lady
Molyneux had treated her, and doubted
not but that her influence with Willoughby
had prevailed on him to expel her for ever
from that place in his regard which the
very reasons on which he resigned her as
his wife, ought to give her as a defenceless
and unhappy orphan, dependent on his
family. She recollected now but too well
the reserve and disdain, the look of min∣gled
anger and scorn, which Willoughby's
features spoke as she saw him the second
time leading out his sister; and her mind
dwelt on the expression of his eyes as they
first met her's; when, though he must have
<PB N="263" REF="273"/>
seen how much she was surprised and af∣fected
by the sight of him, he flew from
her without one consoling word, though it
was evident she could hardly support her∣self.</P>
<P>"All is over then," cried she: "that
tender friendship which would have been
the consolation of my life, is at an end.
Every tie that from our infancy united us
is broken, and I have now no reliance but
on the kindness of those who are compara∣tively
strangers. Ah! is it generous thus
to discard me, without even trying to
soften the blow: but go, cruel, capricious
man, go, and enjoy, with your opulent
heiress, all that affluence can give: go, and
become callous and insensible to all those
noble sentiments that once animated your
bosom, which once rendered you so de∣servedly
dear to me. They are gone. Wil∣loughby,
selfish, cruel, unfeeling, and in∣solent,
is not the Willoughby to whom my
heartwas devoted. Why therefore should I
be thus wretched about him? why let his
<PB N="264" REF="274"/>
proud malignant sister triumph in knowing
that I am mortified and unhappy. Let me
try to drive his too painful remembrance
from me; or at least to remember him only
as the son of my beloved benefactress."</P>
<P>At the mention of that revered name,
however, all her newly acquired resolution
forsook her. The memory of her tender,
her first friend, was so intimately connected
with that of Willoughby himself, that her
tears flowed for both; and against the un∣kindness
of the latter neither her pride nor
her reason could sustain her.</P>
<P>A sleepless night succeeded to this con∣flicting
evening; and it was not till towards
morning that Celestina determined to write
to Willoughby, entreating him still to al∣low
her that place in his friendship, which
no fault of her's had, she thought, forfeited,
and assuring him that whatever might be
her destiny her regard for him was un∣changeable,
though she would never in∣trude
upon him with it. Her tenderness
conquered her resentment, and the idea of
<PB N="265" REF="275"/>
what she owed to the son of her early friend,
whatever might be his conduct towards her,
came in aid of that long rooted tenderness,
and produced the resolution which she
meant to execute in the morning. Having
thus determined, her mind gradually be∣came
more tranquil, and her spirits being
quite exhausted, she sunk into slumber.</P>
<P>But the fainter though still painful ideas
of the evening before pursued her; and af∣ter
tormenting her with numberless wild
terrors, she fancied that she saw Willoughby
with the same menacing look he wore the
preceding night, with a dagger in his hand,
approaching and threatening her to plunge
it into a heart, which was, he said, perfi∣dious
and ungrateful, and had been the
means of driving him to guilt and despair.</P>
<P>From an image of such horror she wildly
started; and awaking, found Lady Hora∣tia
Howard sitting by her bed side, holding
one of her hands, and gazing on her with
great concern.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="276"/>
With the most soothing voice she spoke
to Celestina, and endeavoured to quiet the
excessive agitation of her spirits. Her rea∣sonable
and gentle arguments had their de∣sired
effect; and Celestina, ashamed of ap∣pearing
insensible to the solicitude of such
a friend, summoned all her resolution to
her aid, and was able in about an hour to
attend the breakfast table with something
like composure. Her cheeks, however,
had still that crimson glow which the per∣turbed
state of her mind had given them:
her eyes were heavy with tears, which in
despite of all her efforts continued to fill
them when the image of Willoughby, pale
and thin, with anger flashing from his eyes,
and contempt trembling on his lips, again
arose in her imagination. Lady Horatia
looked at her with more than her usual ten∣der
complacency; for it was when her fine
open countenance expressed pensive sorrow,
that she was, from her then particularly re∣sembling
the regretted brother of Lady
Horatia, to her more than usually interesting.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="277"/>
Before the breakfast table was removed,
Montague Thorold was introduced. He
was extremely dejected; and hardly able to
return the compliments of Lady Horatia,
who was always glad to see him, and who
had undoubtedly given him all her interest
with Celestina, and more encouragement to
pursue his suit than was perhaps strictly pru∣dent;
since Celestina, though she could not
avoid him, though she never could prevail
upon herself to behave to him with unkind∣ness,
and though his talents and conversa∣tion,
and perhaps that sort of respectful
idolatry by which few women can help be∣ing
gratified however they may wish to re∣press
it, were, in some degree, pleasing to
her, had yet repeatedly declared to Lady
Horatia and to Montague Thorold himself,
that she felt not, and was persuaded she never
should feel for him, that tender preference,
without which she never would marry.
This declaration they both imputed to that
affection for Willoughby, which the uncer∣tainty
<PB N="268" REF="278"/>
of her own situation continued to
nourish. Persuaded as they both were, that
Willoughby had promised to become the
husband of Miss Fitz Hayman, which every
body but Celestina had long believed,
Lady Horatia doubted not but that the
merit and attachment of Montague Tho∣rold,
the similarity of their taste, Celestina's
regard for his father, and the easy compe∣tence
which with him she could possess and
which she often declared was the condition
of life she would prefer, would altogether
induce her to reward his ardent affection
with her hand, as soon as it became certain
that Willoughby, either from interested mo∣tives
or from conviction of their too near
relationship, absolutely and for ever relin∣quished
all pretensions to it. She was,
therefore, glad that the accidental meeting
which had so much affected Celestina was
likely to hasten this period; and far from
seeing it in the unfavourable light Thorold
himself did, she told him, as soon as Ce∣lestina
<PB N="269" REF="279"/>
left the room, that for him no cir∣cumstance
could be more favourable.</P>
<P>Lady Horatia had long since transferred
entirely to Montague Thorold those good
wishes which she had at first expressed to∣wards
Vavasour. His great fortune, his
handsome figure, and his apparent affection
for Celestina, had for some time interested
her for him; and she imputed his extrava∣gant
vivacity, and even his violent irregu∣larities,
to his youth and unchecked habits
of gratification. Before her, Vavasour had
at first so far restrained the intemperate sal∣lies
of his ungovernable temper, that she
was for some time disposed to think well of
his heart and his understanding: but soon
finding that this semblance of moderation
availed him not, and that he gained no∣thing
on the inflexible heart of Celestina, he
became tired of it, and relapsed into such a
wild way of talking, and of boasting of ac∣tions
still wilder, that Lady Horatia was no
longer able to excuse him; and though she
still received him at her house with civility,
<PB N="270" REF="280"/>
she entirely approved of the resolution Ce∣lestina
had made never to listen to him as a
lover.</P>
<P>It was just at that period that Montague
Thorold, who on Celestina's first arrival in
town had not availed himself of the per∣mission
he had obtained to see her, came
to solicit of Lady Horatia that indulgence,
and accounted for his absence by relating a
long illness his father had just escaped; in
which, as Mrs. Thorold was absent with
one of her daughters, he had himself been
his only and constant attendant. "You
know," said he to Celestina, "how much I
love my father, and how well he deserves
that I should love him; and you will easily
imagine what must have been my anxiety,
when, for so many nights and days, I saw
him experience the most excruciating tor∣tures,
and knew his life to be in the most
imminent danger. Even the reigning, the
triumphant passion of my heart—my love,
my adoration of Celestina, was suspended,
<PB N="271" REF="281"/>
in the pain and solicitude I suffered for my
father."</P>
<P>His looks, which were greatly changed
since Celestina saw him before, witnessed
how severe this pain and solicitude had
been; and Celestina not only forgave, but
esteemed him the more for that neglect,
which had at first given her a slight degree
of mortification. From that time he had
constantly visited at the house of Lady Ho∣ratia,
and from his power of amusing her
by reading and conversation, he was be∣come
so great a favourite, that he had no
rival in her good opinion but Celestina her∣self.
It was at her request he had met
them at Oxford, and gone with them to
Bath and Bristol. Celestina, who saw but
too plainly that all this was but feeding a
passion already fatal to the repose of a
young man whom she highly esteemed, had
in vain remonstrated with Lady Horatia on
the subject; who answered, that <HI>her</HI> pre∣sence
was a sufficient protection, and that as
to his love, he would not indulge it the less
<PB N="272" REF="282"/>
for being refused the opportunity of speak∣ing
of it. To this doctrine Celestina could
not assent; but, in her situation, to diffent
was of little effect; and all she could do to
counteract the effects of this indiscreet in∣dulgence
of Lady Horatia towards Monta∣gue
Thorold, was, to declare to him very
solemnly, whenever he introduced the sub∣ject
of his love, which was whenever they
were alone, that though her esteem and re∣gard
for him were very great, she never
could think of him otherwise than as
her friend: and when he answered, that
content with that esteem and regard he
should be the happiest of mankind to be
permitted by time and tenderness to win her
love, she very frankly assured him, that the
sentiments which were once her's for Wil∣loughby,
though towards him they might
be at an end, could never, she was well as∣sured,
be transferred to another.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, however, young,
sanguine, and violently in love, was not
easily discouraged; while the favour of
<PB N="273" REF="283"/>
Lady Horatia, the wishes of his father, and
the complacency and kindness with which,
notwithstanding her repeated declarations,
Celestina treated him, all contributed to
cherish a passion which insensibly absorbed
his whole soul. Every action, every senti∣ment,
every look of Celestina, at once en∣creased
and justified this excessive passion;
and he lived now only to think of her when
he was absent, or gaze on her with adora∣tion
when she was present. Whenever he
knew she was to be at any public place, (in∣formation
which he was very assiduous and
very successful in obtaining,) thither he
went also; and though, unless he was in∣vited,
he never introduced himself into the
parties she was with, he contrived so to
place himself as to be able to see her, and
was content.</P>
<P>The extreme dejection with which he had
on the last morning entered the house of
Lady Horatia, all fled before her assurances
that the meeting between Willoughby and
Celestina, however she might for a little
<PB N="274" REF="284"/>
time be affected by it, would prove of ad∣vantage
to him. Elated more than ever by
hope, he left Lady Horatia, having ob∣tained
leave to meet them at the opera,
whither they were going that evening.</P>
<P>But with poor Celestina it was very dif∣ferent:
hope had now wholly forsaken her,
yet still she clung even to despair, when it
gave her an excuse for dwelling on the be∣loved
and regretted name of Willoughby.</P>
<P>She took out of her dressing box a locket,
in which his hair was interwoven with that
of his mother and of his sister, and which
she had been used when a child to wear
round her neck. She looked at it a mo∣ment,
and remembered a thousand cir∣cumstances
that brought the tears again
into her eyes. She kissed it; she put it to
her heart; and that soft heart melting at the
tender images this slight memorial pre∣sented
to it, the resentment which her pride
had made her feel the evening before was
forgotten; while, unable to bear the thoughts
of having seen the last of Willoughby, of
<PB N="275" REF="285"/>
his having taken an accidental but eternal
leave of her with anger and scorn, she de∣termined
instantly to execute her purpose
formed the evening before, and with a trem∣bling
and uncertain hand wrote as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Do not think, dear Willoughby, that
the unfortunate Celestina means to in∣trade
upon you with her complaints, or
to trouble you, after the present moment,
with even her name. But when those
recollections which she cannot all at
once subdue press upon her heart, she
finds it impossible, quite impossible, to
submit to take of you an eternal farewel,
without entreating, that though we ne∣ver
meet again, we may part in peace
with each other.</P>
<P>I might indeed urge to you, Wil∣loughby,
that if the account you gave
me of our supposed relationship be re∣alized,
it ought not to excite your anger,
but to give me a claim to your protec∣tion.
If my heart did not, I know not
<PB N="276" REF="286"/>
why, revolt from the idea of being so
nearly your relation, I might on that
score claim your protection and your
pity; I might be permitted surely to
love you as my brother, since, alas! whe∣ther
you permit it or no, I must still
love you—but with an affection so disin∣terested
and pure, that, be my situation
in regard to you what it may, I feel no∣thing
for which I ought to blush.</P>
<P>You look very ill, Willoughby. You
look unhappy: and on me you looked
unkindly. I do not ask to see you, since
my accidentally meeting you was evi∣dently
painful to you; but I ask to have
a few lines from you to tell me that you
are not ill, that you are not unhappy,
and that your once loved Celestina is
not become hateful to you. Believe me,
I shall rejoice in your happiness where∣ever
found. Do not then refuse to assist
me in obtaining—not happiness, for that
is no where to be found for me—but in
obtaining that degree of content and re∣signation
<PB N="277" REF="287"/>
which may enable me to go
through life without regretting the hour
that I ever received it. This, Willough∣by,
is in your power, and you must be
greatly changed indeed if you refuse,
when you can so easily grant the last re∣quest
that ever will be preferred to you,
by the unhappy, but ever grateful and
affectionate</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Though by no means satisfied with her
letter when she had finished it, she despaired
of pleasing herself better. She therefore
sealed and sent it away by one of the foot∣men
to the house of Lady Molyneux, as
she knew no other address to Willoughby.
The servant returned in about half an hour,
and told her that Mr. Willoughby was not
there, but that he had sent in the letter and
received a message that it should be taken
care of and delivered to him.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="288"/>
She had flattered herself that if not a
kind, at least an immediate answer would
put an end to that almost insupportable
state of anxiety which she had been in ever
since she saw him. If he wrote to her with
kindness, it would, she thought, soothe and
console her: if he treated her by letter with
as much coldness and disdain as he did dur∣ing
their short interview, she hoped that
resentment would support her: and that
though her pride might be wounded, her
affection would torment her less.</P>
<P>She was now, however, to wait—per∣haps
a whole day in anxiety; and, what was
more dreadful, be compelled to sustain this
anxiety under the appearance of calmness
if not of cheerfulness; for Lady Horatia,
who had made an engagement with some of
her friends to go to the opera, whither she
seldom went herself, on purpose to gratify
Celestina by hearing a new and celebrated
performer, did not seem at all disposed to
relish the proposal she had ventured to hint
at breakfast, of being left out of the party
<PB N="279" REF="289"/>
of the evening: and though she was gene∣rally
very desirous that Celestina should in
all such matters follow her own inclinations,
yet there were times when she seemed to
expect some sacrifices to be made to her.</P>
<P>Her grateful heart was extremely sensible
of all the kindness of Lady Horatia; who,
from having taken her into her protection
quite a stranger, was now so attached to
her that her happiness seemed her first ob∣ject.
Having no very strong affection for
her only surviving brother, who was a man
immersed in politics and without pretence
to natural affection; and having been torn
early in life from a man she loved, and mar∣ried
by her father to one towards whom she
was indifferent; having since followed her
three children, who alone had reconciled
her to her lot, to their early graves; her
heart had become insensible to what are
commonly called friendships, and she had
for some years rather sought to amuse than
to connect herself. But the graces of Ce∣lestina's
mind, the sweetness of her disposi∣tion,
<PB N="280" REF="290"/>
and the goodness of her heart, had so
won upon her, that the apathy of wearied
sensibility, which she had so long been in,
gradually gave place to an affection almost
as tender as she could have felt had she been
her mother; and this affection, created by
merit, was strengthened by the resemblance
which continually struck her between Celes∣tina
and her younger brother, who lost his
life in America, the loss, which, among all
her misfortunes, she most severely lamented.</P>
<P>Her encreasing tenderness for Celestina,
made her often reflect with uneasiness on
her situation, and very earnestly wish to see
her married. She was very sensible that her
own life was not a good one; for early ca∣lamity
had shaken her constitution and
brought on in the early autumn of her days
the infirmities of old age; and she knew,
that after having taken her as her daughter,
and accustomed her to share all the indul∣gencies
which her own rank and income
procured, it would be a very painful re∣verse
of fortune were she to leave her in the
<PB N="281" REF="291"/>
narrow circumstances in which she found
her. To save much out of her jointure had
never been her wish, and was hardly now
in her power. Her own fortune, in default
of children, returned to her brother; and
all she had to dispose of was about two
thousand pounds. This she gave, by a will
made in the fourth month of their being
together, to Celestina; and with this, and
what she before had, she thought that Ce∣lestina
might, if married to Montague Tho∣rold,
enjoy through life that easy compe∣tence
which was the utmost of her ambi∣tion.
The embarrassed circumstances of
Willoughby, which the good natured world
had always exaggerated, and which Lady
Horatia had considered as irretrievable; his
very expensive place at Alvestone, which
she knew it required a large fortune to keep
up; the doubtful birth of Celestina, whom
she always fancied too nearly related to
him; and some prejudice against him,
merely because he was the brother of Lady
Molyneux, whom she so very much dis∣liked;
<PB N="282" REF="292"/>
all combined to raise in the mind of
Lady Horatia a desire to impede every
step towards the re-union of Celestina and
Willoughby, and to promote her alliance
with Montague Thorold, near whose resi∣dence,
wherever it was, she proposed to
take a house in summer, and to have them
frequently with her in winter at her house
in town.</P>
<P>Though she had not disclosed all her in∣tentions,
Celestina yet knew enough to be
deeply sensible of the uncommon gene∣rosity
of her friend, and the whole study of
her life was to shew that she was so. She
made it a rule never to oppose the wishes of
Lady Horatia whenever they were clearly
expressed; and therefore it was that she had
often, contrary to her own judgment and
to her own inclinations, suffered the assi∣duities
of Montague Thorold; and seemed
to the world to give him that encourage∣ment,
the ill effects of which she endea∣voured
to counteract, by ingenuously de∣claring
to him the impossibility of her ever
<PB N="283" REF="293"/>
making the return he expected to his affec∣tion.</P>
<P>Too certain that Lady Horatia would be
disappointed if not displeased if she declined
on this evening to go out, and not having
courage to tell her the step she had taken
in regard to writing to Willoughby, she
was compelled to struggle with her uneasi∣ness,
and to attempt concealing if she could
not conquer it: but every rap at the door
which seemed to be that of a servant, made
her tremble; and while sitting at work be∣fore
dinner, she could not help going to
the window several times, nor listening to
every sound that she heard in the hall.
Time wore away, and her impatience en∣creased,
and at length grew so evident that
Lady Horatia remarked it. "What is
the matter, my dear?" enquired she: "do
you expect any one?"</P>
<P>Celestina, conscious that she was betray∣ing
herself, and fearing least she should be
blamed for what she had done, of which she
began already to repent as too humiliating,
<PB N="284" REF="294"/>
blushed at this question so deeply, that had
not Lady Horatia been intent at that mo∣ment
on her work, her suspicions must have
been heightened. Celestina, however, not
immediately answering, she repeated her
question—"do you expect any body?"
Twenty reasons might have been given for
her seeming anxiety, and twenty people
might have been named as likely to call;
but not one of all these occurred to Celes∣tina,
who was little practised in dissimula∣tion:
she therefore answered faintly, "no;"
and in hopes of turning Lady Horatia's at∣tention
from her, and of hiding what she
felt, she proposed finishing the perusal of a
poem which Montague Thorold had began
to read the preceding morning.</P>
<P>"Do so," said Lady Horatia.</P>
<P>Celestina took up the book and began;
but had no idea of what she was about, and
of course read so extremely ill, and so un∣like
her usual manner, that Lady Horatia,
looking at her very earnestly, said "Surely,
Celestina—surely something is the matter?"</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="295"/>
"No, indeed, Madam," replied she,
"nothing except perhaps some slight re∣mains
of nervous agitation, from the cir∣cumstances
of last night."</P>
<P>"Try, my dear, to conquer that," re∣plied
Lady Horatia, "and think of re∣gaining
the composure you possessed be∣fore;
which such a circumstance, fairly con∣sidered,
ought not to destroy."</P>
<P>Celestina sighed; and to avoid the ne∣cessity
of giving an answer, went on with
the book before her. She had hardly, how∣ever,
read ten lines, when a servant brought
in a letter and gave it her. She turned paler
than death as she took it, and the book fell
from her hands.</P>
<P>Lady Horaria, whose attention was now
fixed upon her, eagerly asked from whom
was the letter. Celestina had by this time
read it; for it was only a note from a young
friend, for whose painting she had promised
to give some pattern. She put it down:
"It is only from Miss Clayton, Madam,"
said she, "about the patterns I am drawing
for her."</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="296"/>
"Dear child," cried Lady Horatia, "and
is all this trembling and anxiety, this faul∣tering
and solicitude, about Miss Clayton's
patterns? Celestina, I am afraid you are
not ingenuous with me. Surely I deserve
that you should be so?"</P>
<P>Celestina felt that this accusation, of want
of confidence, and the claim made to it,
were equally just. The measure she had
adopted, at the risque of displeasing her
best friend, had produced nothing but
some hours of anguish, and would end pro∣bably
in the conviction that Willoughby
despised and contemned her: for it was
now five o'clock; and it was very impro∣bable
that he should not, in all the hours
that had intervened since she wrote, have
been at his lodgings, or have had time to
acknowledge the receipt of her letter. This
mortifying reflection, and the consciousness
that she ought to have consulted Lady Ho∣ratia,
quite overwhelmed her. She was
pale and silent a moment; and then reco∣vering
her voice, with difficulty said—"I
<PB N="287" REF="297"/>
believe I have acted so foolishly, so im∣properly,
that I hardly dare hope you will
forgive me."</P>
<P>Lady Horatia expressing her uneasiness
and surprise, Celestina, in a tremulous
voice, told her what she had done. Pity
rather than anger was created by the reci∣tal.
"Certainly, my dear child," said
Lady Horatia, "had you consulted me, I
should have advised you against writing to
Mr. Willoughby. Situated as you both
are, no advances should have come from
you. If he is convinced that you are so
related to him as to make every thought of
you, beyond such as that relationship autho∣rises,
guilty and odious, he should surely,
on his coming to England, have sent to
you if he was unwilling to see you, and
have behaved with humanity and brotherly,
tenderness, though love were for ever out
of the question: if he is not convinced of
it, how will you account for his conduct,
but by supposing, that, influenced by pe∣cuniary
motives or by caprice, he is de∣sirous
<PB N="288" REF="298"/>
of forgetting all his former affection
for you, and yet has not that generous
openness of character which would urge
him to quit you handsomely."</P>
<P>To the truth of these remarks Celestina
had nothing to object; but their justice
cruelly depressed her, and her sick heart
recoiled from the idea of being obliged to
appear in public. Again she ventured ve∣ry
gently to insinuate a wish to be left at
home that evening. "If you are really
ill you shall," said Lady Horatia; "but
otherwise I hope you will go."</P>
<P>"I am not really ill," replied Celestina,
"if your Ladyship means only bodily suf∣fering:
but my spirits, my mind—"</P>
<P>"For the maladies of those," interrupted
Lady Horatia, "there is no remedy more
sure than change of scene and variety of
amusement; and believe me, dear Celes∣tina—believe
me, (and I have suffered
much from the maladies of the mind,) they
only grow by indulgence: if we would
conquer, we must contend with and not
<PB N="289" REF="299"/>
encourage them.—You will suffer much less
to-night, if you are in a circle of friends,
who love and admire you, than in brooding
at home over the defection of one, who, if
he ever did, certainly does not now deserve
you.—I beg, therefore, that you will
go."</P>
<P>Celestina, unaccustomed to dispute any
wish of her friend, yielded, with as good a
grace as she could, to her remonstrances;
and with a heavy and aching heart, went to
finish her dress.</P>
<P>The hour of going out arrived; and
Celestina found Montague Thorold, and a
Mr. Howard, a relation of Lady Horatia's,
ready to attend them.—As there was no
escape, she endeavoured to assume the sem∣blance
of tranquillity, and to talk with
them on indifferent matters: but the idea
that Willoughby had left London without
seeing her; or, being still in it, disdained to
answer her letter, and utterly refused to no∣tice
her; hung so heavy on her heart, that
<PB N="290" REF="300"/>
she could with difficulty support herself;
while the protracted state, in which she had
been since the preceding evening, occa∣sioned
such a ferment in her blood, that
her cheeks were of a feverish crimson; and
the languid lustre of her fine eyes never
appeared to greater advantage.—Deep sighs,
which she tried in vain to suppress, stole
from her heart; and Mr. Howard rallied
her upon them, with that sort of common∣place
wit, which is so usual, and so irksome,
where there is real uneasiness to contend
with: while Montague Thorold answered
every sigh of hers, by one yet deeper of
his own; and watched every turn of her
countenance with trembling solicitude.—Lady
Horatia was to join another party at
the opera; and Celestina was in hopes,
that by obtaining a seat in one of the last
rows in the box, she should be excused
from the task of seeming to give any at∣tention,
either to the performance, or the
people around her.—This, therefore, she
<PB N="291" REF="301"/>
contrived to do, and Montague Thorold
placed herself by her.</P>
<P>Her thoughts were engrossed wholly by
Willoughby—and by the cruelty of his re∣fusing
to answer her letter. She saw not the
objects about her; she attended not to the
humble and plaintive voice of Thorold,
who now and then spoke to her; when
Lady Horatia Howard turning to her,
bade her remark, that into the opposite box
had just entered Lady Castlenorth and her
daughter.</P>
<P>Celestina instantly saw them, and as in∣stantly
concluded, that Willoughby's con∣duct
towards her was owing to his being on
the point of marriage with Miss Fitz∣Hayman.—She
had hardly felt her heart
sink under this cruel idea, before Wil∣loughby
himself appeared; and Lady Castle∣worth
making room for him, he sat down
between her and her daughter.</P>
<P>A look from the penetrating eyes of Lady
Horatia Howard made Celestina turn away
her head; but she then met the anxious
<PB N="292" REF="302"/>
and enquiring eyes of Montague Thorold;
and again sought refuge in looking to∣wards
the pit—hardly knowing where she
was, and not daring again to trust herself
with the sight of the group placed imme∣diately
opposite to her. Willoughby saw
her not; and after a while, her eyes, in
despite of the pain she felt, sought him
again.—His countenance did not wear ex∣pressions
of bridal felicity—he was, she
thought, paler and thinner than the night
before, and on his brow some corrosive sor∣row
seemed to hang: but Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
gay and animated, talked to him in∣cessantly;
and both she and her mother en∣deavoured
to engross his attention by a flow
of conversation.—He listened to them—but
Celestina fancied, with more politeness than
pleasure—He smiled; but she thought his
smiles were the smiles of complaisance, and
not of content. Still, however, his ap∣pearance
in public with them was enough
to convince her that his marriage was not
far off. Her heart sunk at this sad cer∣tainty;
<PB N="293" REF="303"/>
for though she had long since en∣deavoured
to wean her mind from the hopes
of ever being his, she had still too keen re∣collections
of that time when it was the
first wish of both their hearts; and she was
prepossessed with an idea, she hardly knew
why, that with Miss Fitz-Hayman, he
would be miserable.</P>
<P>That they had been parted by the arti∣fice
of Lady Castleworth, she now more
than ever suspected. But how Willoughby
could be cheated into such a belief; and if
he was, why he should entirely throw off,
as a relation, her whom, as the chosen
mistress of his heart, he had so fondly
cherished, she could not comprehend; or
could she in any way reconcile his conduct
with that manly and liberal spirit, which
had so eminently marked his character—As
she gazed on his face, as on that of a
stranger—the husband of Miss Fitz-Hay∣man—that
face which she had been ac∣customed
to contemplate with so much
tenderness; and when she considered that,
<PB N="294" REF="304"/>
lost to her for ever, she now dared no
longer look up to <HI>him</HI> as a friend, whom
she had once hoped to find, through life,
her fond and generous protector, her re∣flections
became too bitter; and had she
not feared that her going out would have
attracted his eyes towards her; and known
that Montague Thorold would have at∣tended
her, which she desired to avoid; she
would have returned home—for her suf∣ferings
were almost insupportable.</P>
<P>She hoped, however, to escape without
his seeing her; and shrunk back as much
as she could, pretending that her head-ache
made the light particularly uneasy to her.
Montague Thorold, though knowing too
well the real source of her uneasiness was
yet as anxious as she was that Willoughby
might not see her; and favoured her con∣cealment
as much as he could.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the opera, however,
Willoughby, who seemed very weary of his
seat, left it to speak to somebody he saw in
the pit—Celestina saw him very near the
<PB N="295" REF="305"/>
box where she sat; and became so faint
that she was afraid she must have sunk from
her seat.—But her sufferings still en∣creased,
when, a moment afterwards, Mr.
Howard, who sat next to her, called to
him; and got up to speak to him.—In an∣swering
his question, Willoughby turned
towards him—his eyes immediately fell on
Celestina, and Montague Thorold close
beside her.—An expression of mingled
anger and scorn rose instantly in his coun∣tenance;
he abruptly broke off his conver∣sation
with Mr. Howard, and walked away.—In
a moment Celestina saw him rejoin
Lady Castlenorth, and Miss Fitz-Hayman.—She
saw him affect to enter into conver∣sation
with them; but that it was all effort.
His eyes once or twice were turned to∣wards
her, but immediately withdrawn as if
they had met a basilisk; and after a very
few minutes, she saw, by his manner, that
he complained of the heat of the house,
pleaded indisposition, and left them.</P>
<P>Celestina, overwhelmed with sensations
<PB N="296" REF="306"/>
too much to be borne, began to think the
opera never would end; and that Lady
Horatia, who saw her distress, had never
before had so little compassion. At length
it was finished; and as Montague Thorold
handed her to the coach, she besought him
not to stay supper, if Lady Horatia should
ask him; "for I must in that case stay,
you know, to entertain you, and really I
am so unwell, that it is cruelty to expect it
of me." Gratified by the power of obeying
her, even when her wishes were contrary to
his own; and full of hope that this last
struggle, between her lingering love for
Willoughby, and the certainty of his hav∣ing
left her for another, would terminate
in his own favour, Thorold promised to be
wholly governed by her, and took his leave
at the door.</P>
<P>"Well, Celestina," said Lady Horatia,
as soon as they were alone, "you are now,
I think, convinced that Willoughby is, like
most other men, capricious, and unfeeling.—What
was his conduct to-night, but the
<PB N="297" REF="307"/>
most insulting that it was possible to assume
and after receiving a letter too from you,
which you consess was couched in the ten∣derest
and most submissive terms, which,
as a gentleman, he ought to have an∣swered,
had you never had any claim what∣ever
upon him.—I hope, and believe, how∣ever,
that such conduct will have the hap∣piest
effect—that of weaning you for ever
from that excessive partiality, which from
early prejudice you always appeared to me
to think it a merit to cherish. If he quitted
you, as he pretended, on account of the
doubts raised in his mind, by that sorceress,
Lady Castlenorth, why does he not, those
doubts being now certainties, own you as
his sister, and become your protector as
relation? Why, if they are not ascertained,
does he poorly shrink from the enquiry,
and evade, under such paltry pretences,
the engagements which you would surely
release: him from, if told that he no longer
wished to accomplish them."</P>
<P>Celestina tried to speak, but could not
<PB N="298" REF="308"/>
articulate; and Lady Horatia, whose indig∣nation
against Willoughby seemed to in∣crease
by indulgence, went on—"Let me
conjure you, then, my dear Celestina, to
exert that large share of reason, with which
you are endowed; and, expelling from your
mind all that has passed, try to look for∣ward
to happier prospects—to prospects un∣clouded,
by doubt, and undarkened by the
gloomy apprehensions of being despised by
the family of your husband, and of be∣ing
reproached as having embarrassed his
fortune. Time and reason, the assiduous
tenderness of a man who really adores you,
will conquer all remains of regret; and you
will, by degrees, learn to think of Wil∣loughby,
and of all the events of your
early life, with the most perfect indiffer∣ence.</P>
<P>Celestina thought that was impossible—but
altogether unable to enter into the ar∣gument,
she could only sigh, and in a tre∣mulous
voice intreat to be permitted to re∣tire;
saying that, in the morning, she should
<PB N="299" REF="309"/>
have, she hoped, more resolution, and have
got the better of the agitation of her spirits.
Sleep, however, refused to visit her—the
image of Willoughby, cruel and capricious
as he was, incessantly haunted her. Hav∣ing
been long used to study his counte∣nance,
she understood all its expressions;
and when she had courage to fix her eyes
on him, during the opera, no turn of it
escaped her: all the comfort she could de∣rive
to herself from those observations was,
believing that his attention to Miss Fitz∣Hayman
was forced; and that the solici∣tude
with which she herself was avoided,
arose, rather from some remains of tender∣ness,
than from total indifference. "Sure∣ly,"
said she, "if he felt nothing for me,
he would not fly from me, but treat me
with polite indifference; or, with that can∣dour
and openness of heart which used to
be so natural to him; he would avow his
designs, and give his reasons for them; for
he knows, that be his intentions or his mo∣tives
what they may, I shall never reproach
<PB N="300" REF="310"/>
him; but, whatever I may feel for myself,
rejoice, if he can find happiness."</P>
<P>Thus, the real affection of her heart for
Willoughby, counteracted the effect of that
native pride and dignity of soul, which,
under other circumstances, would have sup∣ported
her; and even of his quitting her,
without finding that unanswerable reason
for it, which was once supposed to exist,
she thought rather in sorrow, than in
anger.</P>
<P>The morning came, joyless and uninterest∣ing
to her—she expected nothing but a re∣petition
of common, irksome occurrences,
with the suspense and misery of not hearing
from Willoughby.—Lady Horatia's re∣monstrance—Montague
Thorold's silent,
but assiduous attendance—company whom
she wished not to see—or parties abroad
that could afford her no pleasure.</P>
<P>The day, and another and another, wore
away, and still no letter from Willoughby
arrived—the forlorn hope, which she had
till now fondly, cherished, that he still re∣tained
<PB N="301" REF="311"/>
a lingering preference for her in his
heart, now faded away; and an almost certain
conviction succeeded, that he not only
quitted her for ever, but disclaimed her
even as a friend; and gave her up in silent
contempt, without either offering her the
protection of a relation, or feeling for her
the regret which the loss of a pleasant ac∣quaintance
would once, she thought, have
given him.</P>
<P>She repented she had concealed the let∣ter
she had written from Lady Horatia
Howard; and while she was conscious that
she ought to have no reserves towards her,
she felt, that in her present anxious state of
suspense, it would be some consolation to
talk it over with her friend. But far from
soothing her with hope, and attempting to
account for the silent neglect of Willough∣by,
by any means that might palliate its
cruelty, Lady Horatia exhorted her, more
earnestly than ever, to call off her thoughts
from a man, who was considered in every
light so unworthy to possess them: and,
<PB N="302" REF="312"/>
she urged, more earnestly than she had
ever yet done, her wishes, that the tender
and generous attachment of Montague
Thorold might be immediately rewarded.</P>
<P>Though to the necessity of giving her∣self
to another, Celestina could by no means
agree, yet she felt, that she must either
learn to think with more calmness of her
eternal separation from Willoughby, or sink
under it—for such pain as the undecided
wretchedness of the last two or three days
had given her, human nature could not
long sustain. She promised Lady Horatia
that she would endeavour to regain her tran∣quillity;
but besought her, for a day or
two, to excuse her from mixing with com∣pany;
and that in the mean time nothing
might be said to Montague Thorold, to give
him more encouragement than he had al∣ready
received. From the looks of Wil∣loughby,
when he had seen her with him;
and from his present disdainful silence, she
supposed that he believed her engaged to
him, and either resented her having enter∣ed
<PB N="303" REF="313"/>
into such an engagement, without con∣sulting
him, or still felt some pain in be∣lieving
she had given herself to another—of
which, she could not help owning, there
was every appearance, from their being so
frequently together; and from the report
which had gone forth, which her protec∣tress
had not only left uncontradicted, but
had rather encouraged. Of Montague
Thorold, therefore, she now thought with
concern and disquiet, as being partly the
cause of the uneasiness she suffered from
the certainty which every hour in its flight
confirmed, that Willoughby had taken
leave of her for ever.</P>
