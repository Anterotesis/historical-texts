<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE present situation of Public Affairs
calls forcibly upon every good Subject,
to exert himself in the Public Service. Every
individual possesses a power, which can aid and
support his country. He can draw his sword in
her defence, contribute to her resources, or
combat with argument, and expose to just in∣dignation,
those, who have proved themselves
her internal, and consequently, her unnatural
enemies.</P>
<P>The Author of the following Essay has long
entertained an opinion, that the most formi∣dable
foes of Great Britain were nursed in her
own bosom: These, under the masque of Patri∣otism,
fomented rebellion in her Colonies; and
by exposing her pretended weakness, created a
combination of powerful States, not only against
her interest, but her very existence, as a great
and independent Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the emergency, which is the result of that
combination, two objects seem necessary to the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Public Safety. These are, the knowledge of
our friends from our enemies; and that spirited
exertion, which alone can extricate us, from our
present situation. If the facts advanced, and
encouragements exhibited, in the following Es∣say,
shall contribute to throw light, on the one;
or to add vigour to the other, the Writer has
attained his purpose.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT
HISTORY
OF THE
OPPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>IN every age, and almost in every country,
the ambition, which is inherent in human na∣ture,
has prompted individuals to aspire to dis∣tinction
and pre-eminence, among their fellow∣citizens.
The means, used to obtain those ob∣jects,
are various; as to render them success∣ful
they must be accommodated to the spirit
of the government, under which they are ap∣plied.
In despotic monarchies, the favour of
the Prince, who is the fountain of all prefer∣ment,
is generally procured by intrigue or ad∣dress.
In republics, influence and authority
are acquired, by gaining the confidence, or by
seducing the principles of the people; and, in
mixed governments, like that of Great Britain,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
the nearest road to power lies between those two
extremes.</P>
<P>The Revolution, which happened about
ninety years ago, though it made but few
changes in the forms of authority, established a
balance of influence, between the Crown and the
People. The first retained the essence, but lost
much of the terror of power. The representa∣tives
of the latter having a great deal to bestow,
as a body, thought themselves, as individuals,
entitled to a share in a government, which they
supported. A mutual dependence was created,
by the possession of the means of conferring mu∣tual
favours. A Prince, who stood in need of
supplies, was directed, by common prudence,
where to chuse his servants. But as candidates
were more numerous than offices, the disap∣pointed
never failed to persecute the successful,
till, by watching faults, errors, or misfortunes,
they obtained their point, and they them∣selves
became, in their turn, the objects of
attack.</P>
<P>As a degree of the public confidence was ne∣cessary
to direct the Sovereign in his choice of
servants, men who wished to be employed, took
care to support, in their public appearances,
the principles and perhaps the prejudices of
the people. An habitual jealousy of the power
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
of the Crown, kept open the ears of the public
to every alarm. Scarce any measure of Go∣vernment
could be so free from error, as not
to be vulnerable on some popular ground.
Every Opposition seized this obvious advan∣tage,
and assumed or obtained the title of "the
popular party." No distinction was made,
in this respect, between <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> Each
party, when out of place, adopted the same
principles; and thus both were alternately
dignified with the once honourable name of
PATRIOTS.</P>
<P>The present reign began, with advantages,
calculated to put an end to foolish distinctions,
which ought to have expired, with the preju∣dices,
on which they had been founded. A
young prince had succeeded to the throne, who
disdained to govern his people through the me∣dium
of a faction. The door of preferment
was laid open to all his subjects; but though
this liberal conduct might have pleased the un∣prejudiced,
it was incapable of extinguishing
party among the interested. These, though of
different principles and characters, by imposing
on the weak and credulous, formed new factions,
on the shadows of departed political tenets.
However heterogeneous before, the heat of re∣sentment,
and rage of disappointment, as it
were, gradually melted them into one mass;
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
and they revived in themselves the name, though
little of the principles of WHIGS.</P>
<P>The vehemence of the present Opposition
seems to have carried them to extremities,
which supersede all former descriptions of party,
and which cannot fail to defeat their views. In
former times, the candidates for public favour
thought it prudent to adhere, in their exhibi∣tions,
to public principles. But in our times,
an eagerness to thwart the measures of Govern∣ment
has expelled all regard for the opinions of
the people. The dignity and honour of the
nation were formerly the favourite themes of Op∣positions;
melancholy, meanness, and despair,
now fill the whole circle of patriotic oratory.
With a want of prudence, as well as of decency,
they tie up the hands of their country in the
hour of danger. They not only justify rebel∣lion,
against her authority, but indirectly pro∣mote
a foreign war against her very existence:
By magnifying the power of her opponents,
they endeavour to depress her spirits; by ex∣posing
her real or pretended weakness, they
wish to inspire her enemies with a confidence of
success.</P>
<P>These strange positions, and many more of
the same kind, might be established, on incon∣testible
authorities, by a plain narrative of the
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
conduct of opposition, since the commencement
of the present parliament. But, the pursu∣ing
them through such a variety of matter,
and such a length of time, would be a task
of great labour, and little entertainment. We
shall, therefore, confine ourselves to the most
striking features of the last session. In the
space of seven months, they have contrived to
croud together most of the absurdities of seven
years; and, though the studied brevity of this
disquisition must necessarily exclude many cir∣cumstances,
enough, we trust, will appear to
shew the principles, designs, and views of so
strange a confederacy.</P>
<P>On the 26th of November, 1778, the fifth
session of the present parliament was opened,
with a speech from the throne. A complaint
of the perfidy of France, in commencing hosti∣lities,
and the obstinacy of America, in refusing
terms, together with a request of support, were
the chief heads of the speech. It expressed, at
the same time, a regret "that the efforts of
his Majesty had not been attended with all
the success which the justice of the cause, and
the vigour of exertions, seemed to promise."
Unanimity was, in the usual form, recommend∣ed;
and surely no period in history more re∣quired
the unanimous exertion of the whole
nation.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
Opposition have denominated themselves
"an active Opposition;" and if zeal in thwart∣ing,
assiduity in obstructing, and success in de∣feating
public measures, merit a designation,
which implies a kind of applause, they are
certainly entitled to that name. The una∣nimity
and concert, which their Sovereign
requested, for the support of the interests
and honour of the nation, exist only among
them, for the ruin of the one, and the tarnish∣ing
of the other. A short detail of the prin∣ciples,
which they advanced in the first exhibi∣tions
of the season, will establish the truth of
this observation. The orators in the Lower
House mixed reflections on the past, with pro∣phecies
of future disasters. The first we shall
submit to the judgment of the Reader; seve∣ral
of the latter have been already refuted by
time.</P>
<P>Opposition opened the political campaign,
with assertions, which had been often refuted;
and with predictions of national disasters, which
their own conduct seemed, uniformly, calculated
to realize. As the public misfortunes may be
deduced, from the rebellion in America, they
asserted, contrary to fact, that hostilities had
been first commenced by government. They
recurred to their usual prophecies, relative to
foreign wars; and they even went so far as to arm
Holland, our ancient ally, against this devoted
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. T. T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d's Speech, Nov. 26th, 1778.</NOTE> To sow discontents, among the

scandalously neglected<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Speech of T. T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d, Nov. 26, 1778.</NOTE>. To excite mutiny in
the army and navy, they asserted that Govern∣ment
had employed no commander of an army,
no admiral of a fleet, whom they had not dis∣graced,
or with whom they had not quarrelled<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Speech of C. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>x, Nov. 26, 1778. Speech of
C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e.</NOTE>.
With a contradiction in terms, which nei∣ther
folly nor rage itself could justify, they aver∣red
that Ministry had succeeded in <HI>no instance</HI>;
yet that fortune had been favourable in <HI>every in∣stance,</HI>
during the whole campaign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. They
owned, that unanimity was absolutely necessary
for the safety of their country; yet, with pe∣culiar
<HI>honesty,</HI> avowed "that they would clog
the wheels of government, when it ought to
be assisted by every man<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Though the clogging the wheels of Govern∣ment
at home, and their encouraging the sedi∣tious
abroad, had been the obvious cause of the
rise and progress of the American war, they
traced the cause of the war to the pretended ty∣ranny
of Great-Britain<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Though America had
continued an atrocious rebellion for many years,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
against her parent and benefactress; yet they
affirmed, that a war against America "is
against our own country." Though the
Americans have been declared <HI>rebels,</HI> by all the
solemnity of law, by all the forms of the con∣stitution,
"they are still our fellow-subjects,
and every blow we strike is against our∣selves<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Speech of C. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>x, Nov. 26, 1778. Speech of
C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e.</NOTE>." Though they have broke capitu∣lations<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Governor J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>st<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ne's Speech, Nov. 26, 1778.</NOTE>,
disregarded flags of truce<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Admiral Gambier's Letter to Congress.</NOTE>, violat∣ed
conventions, trampled on every principle of
war, that governs civilized nations<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Speech of Governor J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>st<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ne.</NOTE>; "yet as
their war is a war of passion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Speech of Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>x, Nov. 26, 1778.</NOTE>," we ought
"to withdraw our forces entirely from their
coast<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>." Though "offensive war is pointed
out as proper for this country<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>," war ought
not "to be offensive with respect to America."
With unexampled absurdity, they alleged,
that rebels in arms had a better right to "a
relaxation of hostilities," than foreign ene∣mies,
whom the alliance of those rebels had
excited against their country. With a perver∣sion
of terms, unknown, in any other times,
they asserted, that men, whose hands are daily
stained with the blood of their countrymen,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
ought to be treated not as enemies, but as
peaceable fellow-subjects and friends<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Speeches of all the Opposition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the Upper Assembly the zeal of Patriotism,
as springing from higher ground, rose to a
greater height. Not content to amend the Ad∣dress
to the Throne, it was insisted, that no
Address at all should be made<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l's Speech, Nov. 26, 1778.</NOTE>. It was as∣serted
that our armies were either mouldered
away, by death, desertion, and sickness, or re∣duced
by loss in battle<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y's Speech, Nov. 26.</NOTE>. That our com∣merce
was totally lost, our public credit draw∣ing
to annihilation, our fleet on the verge of
absolute ruin<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l's Speech.</NOTE>. That nothing could save
the empire, but withdrawing our troops from
America, acknowledging her independence,
and imploring her forgiveness<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vide Opposition Speeches, <HI>passim.</HI></NOTE>. That it
would be even imprudent, if not impossible,
to persist in a war against France<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>p of P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rb<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>gh's Speech.</NOTE>. That
Spain would aid France; that Holland, as a
commercial state, would treat with America;
that the whole world would join against us;
that we were without men, without money,
without an ally; that nothing, in short, could
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
save the state, but an immediate dismission of
all his Majesty's present servants, and the plac∣ing
the reins of Government, in the hands of Opposition<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Speeches <HI>passim,</HI> Nov. 26, 1778.</NOTE></P>
<P>Assertions, which carried along with them
their own refutation, were not likely to make
converts within, nor proselytes without doors.
But what the party could not effect by facts
and arguments, they endeavoured to accom∣plish,
by address and intrigue. Mismanage∣ments,
and a consequent want of suceess, on
every side of the war, had convinced the na∣tion,
that there was an error in planning at
home, or a defect in the execution abroad.
Generals and Admirals had returned, from
their different commands, not only without
laurels, but some of them covered with disgrace
or misfortune. The coldness, with which they
had been received, by their country, had raised
their resentment, as it hurt their pride. As Go∣vernment
brought forward no accusation against
them, the presumption was, that they them∣selves
were partly to blame. As men of little
prudence and considerable names, are the fittest
tools for the hands of party, Opposition took
care to secure engines, which they hoped to
play off with advantage, on the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ne, though a man spirit, of
conducted himself, as if political prudence form∣ed
no part of his character. His enemies re∣marked,
that he came from America, where he
had lost an army, with as much confidence, as
Terentius Varro returned to Rome, from the fa∣tal
fields of Cannae. Men, in general, have
less blamed his conduct abroad, than his beha∣viour
at home. His accepting a leave of absence
from a Congress, who had shamefully evaded
hs own convention, the remembrance of recent
misfortunes, and a suspicion of former errors,
justified the court, in adhering to an <HI>etiquette,</HI>
which excludes officers, who have been unfor∣tunate,
from the Royal Presence, till they are
acquitted by a Court Martial.</P>
<P>The General forgot his own errors, if such
existed, and remembered only, what he thought,
the severity of Government. He also forgot,
that he had left his captive fellow-soldiers,
whom he ought to have protected from insult
and oppression, by his presence; and he even,
eluded orders given him to return to their aid,
in their melancholy and severe captivity. It was
observed, upon the whole, that regret and pity
were all he could hope to meet with; but,
it seems, he expected approbation. Resent∣ment
arose, in his mind, as from injustice;
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
and with a precipitancy, which cannot easily be
defended, he either sought or accepted the pro∣tection
of Opposition.</P>
<P>Sir W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="__"/>e had, indeed, lost no army,
but as he had decisively improved no advantage,
the American war rather increased, than dimi∣nished,
upon his hands. Possessed of the com∣mon
<HI>routine</HI> of military knowledge, he seems to
have been capable of securing from defeat <HI>such</HI>
troops as <HI>be</HI> led against <HI>such</HI> an enemy: But
the conducting them to any brilliant victory,
and the making a decisive use of the supe∣riority
he enjoyed, appear to have been ob∣jects
foreign to his talents. Sensible, per∣haps,
of this defect, in his own mind, he chose
to prevent any reverie of fortune by retiring
from the command of the army; but as "mi∣litary
secessions," in the midst of war, require
an explanation, his retreat was ascribed to his
having lost the confidence of men in power.
The fact might be true, but it was not sufficient,
to satisfy the people. Though he was received
with kindness by the Sovereign, and attention
by the Ministry, he perceived that he was va∣nishing
fast from the memory of the nation.
In the space of a few months, he found him∣self
of as little account, in the estimation
of the Public, as any of his own commissaries;
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
and, to recover his reputation, he closed ea∣gerly,
with Opposition; as they promised him
their hearty assistance, in a Parliamentary In∣quiry.</P>
<P>To these lucky aids from America, the party
added a still greater acquisition in Europe. An
Admiral possessed of professional reputation,
equal at least to his merit, though connected
with Opposition, was placed at the head of the
Western Squadron. The selecting men of <HI>op∣posing</HI>
principles, for the command of fleets and
armies, has been long a favourite maxim of
Government. This conduct may have had its
foundation in liberal sentiments; but it has ope∣rated
like weakness, and led to a train of mis∣fortunes.
Few officers are such "sturdy mora∣lists,"
as to exclude political prejudices from
the line of their duty.</P>
<P>Our Admiral put to sea, with one of the
most powerful squadrons, that ever sailed, from
the ports of this kingdom. He met the ene∣my;
and a running fight, rather than an en∣gagement,
ensued. No trophies were lost; but
no laurels were gained. The professional terms,
in which the accounts of naval actions are in∣volved,
render them obscure, if not unintel∣ligible,
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
to the generality of mankind. One
fact, however, was universally admitted: "A
superior British fleet had engaged an inferior
French squadron; and neither advantage nor
trophy was obtained."</P>
<P>A nation, accustomed to value themselves
upon naval victories, were not likely to be sa∣tisfied
with a drawn battle, under such circum∣stances.
But though no symptoms of approba∣tion
appeared, no signs of resentment were
shown. A cold silence certainly prevailed; a
species of censure, more mortifying to a feeling
mind, than even clamour. Had the Admiral
been permitted to remain, under this cloud, he
would have become a useless engine, in the
hands of his party. To derive benefit from his
former popularity, it was found necessary to
remove the stain, which want of success had left
upon his character. Some officers, in his suite,
were, accordingly, induced to propagate insi∣nuations,
to the disadvantage of Vice-Admiral
Sir H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r. That gentleman, by be∣ing
in place, might be supposed to act in
concert with men in power, for the ruin of his
Admiral; and to make the former the <HI>accuser</HI>
was to arm the prejudices of the people in fa∣vour
of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>
The Vice Admiral being a man of more spirit
than foresight, unfortunately fell into the trap
laid for him by the faction. Conscious of his
deserving praise, instead of censure, for his be∣haviour
on the 27th of July, he became irri∣tated
at the injustice done to his reputation.
From being the <HI>accused,</HI> he became the <HI>accuser</HI>;
and this step turned the scale of opinion in fa∣vour
of his opponent. In this circumstance
alone the gallant Vice-Admiral, as it after∣wards
appeared, was to blame. Had he de∣manded
and insisted upon his own trial, his
character would have recovered its deserved
lustre; and that of the Admiral might have lost
much of that splendour which was thrown upon
it, by his industrious friends.</P>
<P>A party, who had lost the confidence of the
nation, seized with eagerness the sudden change
which appeared in the popular tide. Whispers
artfully propagated, without doors, were im∣proved
by degrees into a general clamour.
Within doors, every opportunity was taken, and
every artifice used to feed the rising flame. The
two Admirals, if a vulgar expression may be
used, were <HI>pitted</HI> against each other. Much
sport, or what is the same thing to Opposition,
much mischief, was expected from this contest.
A man of popularity was accused, by a man
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
in office. The common changes of mini∣sterial
interference were rung, without ceas∣ing,
in the ears of the people. The helpless
condition of INNOCENCE, when persecuted by
POWER, was echoed, from every corner, by
the runners, writers, and abettors of Opposi∣tion.
The two houses of Parliament resounded
with vehement declamations, or broken accents
of whining oratory; and that amiable but much
abused virtue, pity, was excited, every where,
in the breasts of the deluded, the credulous and
the weak.</P>
<P>In vain had Sir H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r declared, in
the most solemn and public manner, that he
had not communicated his design to any man in
office. In vain did men in office affirm, upon
the faith of Gentlemen, that they knew nothing
of the accusation, till it was officially delivered
to the Admiralty. No credit was to be given to
any member of a <HI>Tory</HI> Administration. They
were leagued together in one plan of oppression,
in one dark design, in one pre-concerted conspi∣racy,
to ruin the reputation, and even to take
the life, of a <HI>Whig</HI> Admiral.</P>
<P>In this general turmoil, this intemperate
joy of faction, Opposition not only for∣got
their poor country, but even their poor
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
friends. Sir W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>could not gain
their promised support, for a moment, with all
the verdure of his laurels. The advantages
hoped from his exculpation were not equal in
themselves, and they were more distant in pro∣spect,
than the benefits to be drived from the
acquittal of Admiral K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l. In vain did
General B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ne endeavour to awake the pity
of the party, when he failed to command their
attention. In vain did he exclaim "that he was
<HI>one</HI> of those brave men who made the con∣vention
at Saratoga: That, however, he
claimed no single <HI>merit</HI> in that transaction;
that, in the face of famine, despair, and
death, he had compelled the enemy to grant
conditions, honourable, if they had been
complied with<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Almon's Debates, No. XI. p. 75.</NOTE>." The party were deaf
to "the tale of tears;" and all the attention
paid to the unfortunate general scarce amounted
to one "dolorous anhelation<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. Johnson on the Irish Howl, p. 13.</NOTE>," from the
feeling bosom of Mr. E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ke.</P>
<P>The conduct of Opposition, during the trial,
and after the acquittal of A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l, is
too recent in the recollection of the public, to
require more than a very general recapitulation.
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Their abrogating the old forms of the Admi∣ralty,
by removing a trial for a naval offence
to the land, to accommodate their own purposes,
their appearance at Portsmouth, upon the occa∣sion,
their biassing witnesses, their carrying all
the indecencies of a play-house audience into a
Court of Justice, their soliciting the officers of
the navy, their sowing discontents among the
common seamen, their parading the streets, for
the purpose of inflaming the populace, were
such mean, scandalous, and unjustifiable tricks
of faction, as can scarcely be paralleled by any
example in history.</P>
<P>The pitiful victory which they obtained over
an unfortunate, because a vehement, man, was
pursued with an intemperance inexcusable even
in boys, and with a rancour which the most pro∣fligate
and hard-hearted men, if prudent, would
have concealed, to preserve, at least, the ap∣pearance
of decency. That men of the first fa∣milies,
in this country, should disguise them∣selves
like porters to force illuminations by
breaking windows, is a circumstance which
throws an indelible stain upon the times, as
well as on the party. It even appeared, that,
with every inclination to commit mischief, the
riotous demagogues were obliged to have re∣course
to the bottle, for that courage which na∣ture
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
had denied. That in the hour of "intoxi∣cation
and adscititious boldness," they attack∣ed
the feeble and old among the men, and
terrified into fits and miscarriages several wo∣men,
by the rude barbarity of their behaviour.
That, however, as a just retribution for their
wanton cruelties, many of them suffered under
the hands and cudgels of the injured; and that
several were carried into Roundhouses, covered
with ignominious marks of the chastisement they
had received.</P>
<P>Few men of sense, who were not connected
with the views, or privy to the designs of the
party, could perceive any just grounds for this
species of vulgar ovation. Though the <HI>accuser</HI>
had not brought his charges to the standard of
legal proof, the <HI>accused</HI> had not exculpated him∣self
to the satisfaction of the public. Those who
were most willing to deny his want of conduct,
regretted his want of good fortune; and a ge∣neral
cry went forth, that an opportunity was
lost, which might never return again.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Admiral himself, on the
occasion, was not calculated to establish any
high idea of his good sense or of his principles.
If he thought that he merited a triumph for the
drawn battle of the 27th of July, 1778, what
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
are we to think of his understanding? If, on
the other hand, he made himself the tool of a
faction, what judgment must we form of that
"dignified honour" which his friends annex to
his character? A victory, which had lain con∣cealed
for seven months, and was, at length,
discovered by accident, was not, intrinsically,
worth the expence of many candles; and the
applause of a mob is the coarsest commodity
either a gentleman or his friends can purchase.</P>
<P>But the Faction, as well as their naval friend,
acted as if they really gave credit to their own
assertions and assumptions. Whilst HE paraded
the streets amidst the foolish, if not hired, ac∣clamations
of a rabble, THEY were busy in
weaving a wreath, for his brows, in both
Houses of Parliament. Thinking, at length,
they had sufficiently charged the engine with
popularity, they resolved to bring it to bear,
not only upon Administration, but upon their
Sovereign. <HI>They</HI> proposed to make motions,
against the former, on naval subjects; <HI>he</HI> un∣dertook,
with peculiar modesty, to write <HI>re∣scripts</HI>
to the latter. Even before this double
battery was opened, Opposition began to pre∣enjoy
their expected success with that childish
intemperance which has uniformly marked their
conduct.</P>

A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l having acquired, in the be∣ginning
of March, as many laurels as he was
likely to obtain, his honourable relation, Mr.
F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>x, introduced the first of a long string of mo∣tions,
which, he owned, led to an address for
the removal of the first Lord of the Admiralty,
and ultimately of all his Majesty's servants<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>x's Speech, March 3d and 8th, 1779.</NOTE>.
In support of the motion, he alleged, that the
noble Lord, who presided over the naval de∣partment,
had, as early as the month of No∣vember
1777, solemnly pledged himself, in his
official capacity, that there were thirty five ships
of the line ready for sea, and fit for actual ser∣vice.
That, notwithstanding this assertion, there
were not six ships of the line, in a state to meet
an enemy, in the month of March 1778.
That early in the month of June, his honour∣able
relation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Admiral Keppel.</NOTE> was sent to cruize, on the coast
of France, with twenty ships of the line only;
though it was known, or ought to have been
known, that there were twenty-seven ships of
force lying in Brest water. From these sup∣posed
facts, he deduced this conclusion, that
the Ministry, who had led the nation into so pe∣rilous
a situation, ought instantly to be removed,
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
as unequal to the trust committed to their
charge<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Crime enorme aux yeux du <HI>Sieur Fox.</HI> Gazette de
France, du Vendredi 26 Mars 1779.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In opposition to these assertions, it was proved,
from official documents, that, in November
1777, there were actually thirty-five ships of the
line ready for service. That in the month of
March 1778, some more ships were in a state of
great forwardness for sea. That the whole num∣ber,
fit for meeting an enemy in June, amounted
to forty-four. That when Mr. K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l was
ordered to sail, with twenty ships of the line, of
which a large proportion was three-deckers, there
were but seventeen ships in the harbour of Brest
ready for action. That should it even appear,
which was by no means the case, that there
actually was a greater number of ships in Brest,
it was well known to seamen, that an inferior
force may block up a superior one in a narrow
harbour. That, upon the whole, the Board of
Admiralty had placed a number of ships, ade∣quate
to the service, under the command of
A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l; even to the satisfaction and
approbation of the Admiral himself. That,
therefore, as the premises, endeavoured to be
established by Opposition, were not founded in
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
fact, their conclusions must of course fall to the
ground<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ve's Speech, March 3d and 8th, 1779.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such were the assertions, which Opposition,
mixed with much abuse and altercation, re∣peatedly
echoed, from side to side, in both
Houses. Though the public, as well as Par∣liament,
are frequently invited to an entertain∣ment
of politics, by some very <HI>eloquent</HI> Patriots,
the dish served up is always the same. To use
their own expression, "they have travelled so
often over the ground," that they have trod
out every appearance of vegetation; and those
who are so idle as to accompany them in the
"dreary journey," can neither expect amuse∣ment,
nor reap advantage.</P>
<P>The operations of the party, <HI>without</HI> doors,
were more decisive than their arguments <HI>within.</HI>
Confident of success, or assuming the appear∣ance
of confidence, they had previously gained
the votes of several provident members, who
<HI>wisely</HI> look into futurity. Lazy Whigs and
expecting patriots were roundly told, that to
share in the spoil it was necessary to take an
active part in obtaining the victory. Mandates
were issued for the immediate appearance of all
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
absentees, from every corner of the kingdom.
The beds of the sick, the couches of the gouty
and lame were visited; leaders were sent to the
blind. In short, patriotism crowded the lobbies
of both Houses, with all the mortifying pictures
of age, misfortune and disease.</P>
<P>To aid, with a species of mutiny among sea∣men,
the attacks of Opposition upon Admi∣ralty,
the seeds of sedition had been sown with a
lavish hand at Portsmouth. Officers had been
attacked through their ruling passions; the vain
with flattery, the weak with fallacious reason∣ings,
and the avaricious and ambitious with
promises. To add indecency to presumption
and folly, the nation was <HI>threatened,</HI> with what
is vulgarly called a <HI>Round Robin,</HI> from every
seaport. An Admiral, who had made such a
<HI>splendid</HI> figure on the 27th of July, 1778,
dared to say to his sovereign, that he would
withdraw his talents from the service, unless the
Admiralty, and every department of the State,
were placed in the hands of men whom he
could trust.</P>
<P>Opposition drove, with so much rapidity and
so little judgment, that they overturned their
own designs. Their mean, and even criminal
conduct, offended the people; and the Sove∣reign,
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
with becoming dignity, rejected their
insolent requisitions. The current turned a∣gainst
them, and their spirit vanished when their
hopes declined. The nation discovered their
insidious designs, their lust for power, their
thirst for places. It was perceived that they
meant to sacrifice Great Britain, her rights, her
interests, and even honour, to the demagogues
of America, by rendering her independent of
the parent from whom she sprung. Even those
who had been seduced by their assurances, or
gained by their promises, finding their mistake,
began to retreat. The friends whom they had
brought from the country, by a species of
<HI>habeas corpus,</HI> packed up their cloak-bags and
left the town. The beds of the sick, and cou∣ches
of the lame, were re-occupied; and even
the blind found their way home. Ad<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l
executed his threats against his <HI>devoted</HI> country,
by quitting her service. The muddy stream,
which had overflowed the whole kingdom, and
covered it with slime, returned to its old bed;
and babbled, as formerly, through the rugged
channel of Opposition<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Gazette de France, du Vendredi</HI> 26 <HI>Mars</HI> 1779,
with a kind of regret, says: Aupres touts ces débats, le
voix etant recueillés, la motion de <HI>Sieur Fox</HI> n'en eut que
170 contre 204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29"/>
The hopes of the Faction had been raised so
high, that disappointment depressed their
minds in proportion to their former elevation.
Some, who either ignorantly or fondly imagi∣ned
that the nation would take their part, be∣gan
to talk of a secession. A few orators are
said to have actually retired, to vent the tropes
of unfinished speeches to the "echo of trees
and murmur of rills" on some friend's
estate.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">A certain Baronet, who in a fit of despair relative
to the good <HI>Old Cause,</HI> has lately become a zealous <HI>Whig,</HI>
is much given to such solitary <HI>rehearsals</HI> of the Speeches
which he intends to <HI>fire off,</HI> upon the House.</NOTE>. But as "listless groves and in∣sensible
streams" are not the most encou∣raging
audiences, the solitary patriots were
induced to rejoin their friends, who, though
defeated, still remained in the field.</P>
<P>Whilst the expectations of Opposition were
at their height, by the aid received from A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l
K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l's acquittal, a new topic was started,
which, as it promised much mischief to their
country, opened a fresh prospect of advantage
to the party. The trade of Ireland, and conse∣quently
its revenue, had been on the decline
for some years past. The causes of that misfor∣tune
are more difficult to ascertain than the
fact itself. Whether this diminution of com∣merce
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
proceeded from a decrease of the do∣mestic
industry, or a failure of foreign markets,
it equally demanded a remedy, if it could be
applied. Some steps had been accordingly ta∣ken,
toward that object, in the preceding
session. But it appeared, at the time, that the
facility with which relief was granted, instead
of satisfying Opposition, was calculated to
create new demands. These demands, as they
interfered with the commerce of Great Britain,
were certain of being opposed: a circumstance,
which could not fail to create the <HI>desirable</HI> con∣fusion
which suits the views of the party.</P>
<P>To those, who really wished to remove the
evil, it appeared that the Irish legislature ought
to be the best judges of the remedy. But nei∣ther
that legislature, nor their constituents, had
signified any dissatisfaction at the relief obtain∣ed.
To convince both of the impropriety of
their <HI>peaceable</HI> conduct, Opposition, by making
demands in the name of Ireland, pointed out
what she might extort from Great Britain.
This artifice, they hoped, would reduce the
Ministry to a disagreeable dilemma. Should
they grant the demanded relief to the Irish,
they could not fail to offend the whole com∣mercial
interest in great Britain: should they
refuse it, there was a prospect, by proper ma∣nagement,
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
of creating tumults, and, perhaps,
of kindling a rebellion in Ireland.</P>
<P>Though this commercial adventure has not
yet been productive of all the profit expected
by the Faction, as the ship is still at sea, the
cargo may turn out to some account. The in∣ferior
Irish are, and have been in a distressed
situation. The nature of the government, the
tenures of the country, a listless inactivity,
which always accompanies distress, a want of
industry, created by domestic discouragements
of various kinds, have combined to render
their condition more wretched than that of
almost any other in Europe. They have long
felt their own misery, without knowing well
from whence it came. Our worthy Patriots,
by pointing out Great Britain as the author
of Irish distress, may have some chance of rou∣sing
Irish resentment. They have fomented
and encouraged resistance in America, and
why may they not excite rebellion in Ireland?
The truth is, they seem to have injured their
country beyond <HI>their</HI> degree of forgiveness;
and if they cannot satisfy their ambition by
her misfortunes, they are at least resolved to
gratify their resentment by her ruin.</P>
<P>The attacks, in both Houses were so simi∣lar,
in manner, assertion, declamation, and in∣vective,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
that it was apparent every measure had
been weighed and pre-concerted in the cabinet
of sedition without doors. In this political war∣fare,
the post of honour was given to the Pa∣triots
of the Lower Assembly, where the enemy
was supposed to be most vulnerable. After the
battle was lost <HI>below,</HI> it was generally rehearsed
<HI>above</HI>; where some noble orators wielded, with
peculiar dexterity, those very weapons of scurri∣lity
and invective, which had so little availed the
cause in the hands of their more humble friends.</P>
<P>In the slightest skirmishes, with the common
enemy, the same co-operation, the same concert
appeared. Though composed of such discordant
members, the whole party played in unison;
and every key, that was touched below, was
faithfully answered by a similar note from above.</P>
<P>The Irish business seemed to promise such
a plentiful harvest of confusion, that the whole
party employed their joint labour, in pre∣paring
the soil and sowing the feed. Indi∣viduals
were not, in the mean time, idle, in
their separate efforts, for the benefit of the
common cause. The D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d,
with his usual application, tenacity, and vehe∣mence,
had introduced and supported, in the
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
Upper House, an Inquiry into the Magagement
of Greenwich Hospital. The nature and fate of
this Inquiry, are so recent in the memory of the
Public, that a particular detail is as unnecessa∣ry
in itself, as it would be here out of place.</P>
<P>It may be sufficient to observe, that the in∣tention
of the enquiry was to criminate the first
Lord of the Admiralty. That after a most te∣dious
examination, which lasted near three
months, not one of the charges was proved.
That the E. of S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ch, instead of meriting
censure, deserved the highest praise. That he
had paid peculiar and uncommon attention to
the hospital. That he had improved its reve∣nue,
increased the number of the pensioners,
prevented the admission of improper objects,
made new regulations, for the more speedy re∣covery
of the sick, and the better accommodati∣on
of those in health. That instead of convert∣ing
his superintendency of the charity to any
advantage, he had abolished all sinecures of
inferior offices, which had formerly been in
the disposal of the first Lord. That, in direct
opposition to what had been alledged, there
is not one, out of 2169 pensioners at present in
the Hospital, who is not intitled to the chari∣ty,
by length of service, or infirmities, con∣tracted
in the discharge of duty.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34"/>
Whilst the D. of R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d derived some
hopes, to the faction, from the expected issue
of the Hospital Inquiry, a more flattering pros∣pect
of criminating men in office was open∣ed,
in the Lower Assembly. Sir W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>we,
though not publicly accused, was still anxious
to exculpate himself to the Public. Either
swayed, by a good opinion of his own con∣duct,
or trusting to the kind partiality of his
friends, he had flattered the Patriots and, per∣haps,
himself, that he should be able to lay the
burden of American misfortunes, to the ac∣count
of the minister for the American de∣partment.
The nation found itself disap∣pointed,
but till matters were examined, it
was not known decidedly where censure ought
to fall. An unwillingness in Government, to
admit of a Parliamentary Inquiry, on a military
subject, furnished their enemies with an oppor∣tunity
of drawing conclusions, unfavourable
to Ministry. These conclusions, in the usual
manner, became topics of patriotic invective
and declamation; which, in a manner, extort∣ed
an inquiry, that had been once refused, by
a vote.</P>
<P>But the result of the Inquiry, was very different
from what Opposition hoped. It appeared, that
rebellion first arose in America, from an ambi∣tious
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
faction; and not from the general sense of
the body of the people<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Evidence of Major General Robertson, before the
House of Commons, June 8, 1779, MS. p. 9. 10.</NOTE>. That the reduction
of that faction and, consequently, the extinc∣tion
of rebellion, had uniformly been the object
of Administration, and not the conquest or un∣conditional
subjection of the colonies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The object of the war was to enable the loyal sub∣jects

to accomplish that desirable end, they had not

a much greater one, than was either wished for
or expected, by the most sanguine friend of Go∣vernment
in America<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 17. "The demand of 20,000 men was

force we had was <HI>adequate</HI> to the subduing the re∣bellion." <HI>Evidence,</HI> June 10, p. 22.</NOTE>. That the army had
been amply provided, on all occasions, with
every necessary, every implement, every re∣source
of war. That the hands of the General
had been so far from being tied up, by instruc∣tions,
or his operations counteracted, by or∣ders,
from home, that the manner of carrying
on the war had been left entirely to his judg∣ment
and discretion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
It appeared, that the Americans, instead of
overpowering by numbers, had never, together,
at one place, above 16,000, and consequently
had never been so numerous in the field, as the
army under Sir W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>we<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Evidence, June 10, p. 14.</NOTE>. That our
troops were well disciplined, and uniformly
made the best and most military appearance<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>ibid.</HI> p. 16.</NOTE>.
That the enemy were an undisciplined rabble,
without order, without arms, without cloathing
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">"Except the Maryland Regiment, who were well
cloathed and accoutred.". <HI>ibid.</HI> p. 16.</NOTE>; though by procrastinating the war, they
attained discipline and acquired military know∣ledge.
That, upon all occasions, the British
troops executed their duty, with energy, brave∣ry
and effect. That, upon no occasion, those of
America behaved, with the spirit, firmness,
and intrepidity of soldiers. That the former
were victorious, in every assault, attack, and
fair battle. That the latter obtained no advan∣tage,
but by stratagem or surprise. The infe∣rences
deducible, from these facts, were, that
the British army were either unskilfully or lan∣guidly
led; or that the natural strength of the
country, and unanimity of its inhabitants, had
enabled the Americans to prevent the conse∣quences
of losses, and disasters in the field.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37"/>
In support of the first position it appeared,
That the evacuation of Boston had been too
long delayed; and undertaken, at length,
in an improper season. That the retreat to Ha∣lifax
furnished the rebels, with an opportunity
of strengthening their force at New-York.
That the victory obtained at Long-island might
have proved decisive, had it been properly pur∣sued
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">"Some of the troops were going to storm the lines.

and enabled them to obtain an advantage
which turned the scale of the war. That the
operations, which followed this disaster, were

less calculated to retrieve the misfortune, than
to encourage the enemy. That the retreat from
Quibbleton<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">"Our army (in the Jerseys in 1777) was 17,015

the tedious expedition to the Delaware, and

the surprise at German Town, the injudicious

Mud-Island, the inactive winter at Philadel∣phia,
if not proofs of incapacity, were instan∣ces
of blameable inactivity, in the General.</P>
<P>With regard to the strength of the country,
it appeared, that it presented no advantages to
the natives, which it did not hold forth to the
invaders. That, on the contrary, it was rather
more favourable to the latter, than to the
former. That its great rivers, instead of co∣vering
the retreat of the rebels, by being navi∣gable,
laid them open to fresh misfortunes,
from an enemy, possessing the command of
the sea. That Hudson's River, in particular, by
dividing the whole continent from North to
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
South, formed a natural and strong barrier,
between the revolted provinces. That the
seizing this barrier was an object of the first
consequence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Evidence, p. 51.</NOTE>, towards the extinction of the
rebellion. That this object might have been
easily obtained, as the river presents an excel∣lent
and expeditious water-communication,
between New-York and Albany<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">"An army may pass from New York to Albany
(170 miles) by means of Hudson's River, in two days."
<HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 47. 75.</NOTE>. That
this great advantage rendered the co-operation
of the main army, with the troops coming
from Canada, as obvious, as it was easy and ex∣peditious;
and that, it was the want of such
co-operation, that ruined the Northern expe∣dition<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">"Many feared that general Burgoyne's army would

with the expence and danger of a foreign war.</P>
<P>In the course of the Evidence taken at home,
and more especially by the most authentic in∣formation

<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
injudicious and inactive management of the

of peace. That a very great majority of the peo∣ple
of America are and have been, averse to the

Congress<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Evidence, June 9. p. 12. June 16, <HI>passim.</HI></NOTE>. That they were prevented, from
exhibiting their loyalty to their Sovereign and
their aversion to usurpation, by the desultory
manner, in which the war was conducted, on
our part; as it deprived them of permanent
protection, and left them exposed to the inso∣lence,
cruelty, and revenge of their enemies.</P>
<P>That the quitting of the Jerseys, and the <HI>go∣ing

terrified other provinces from submitting, for
fear of being deserred. That the three Dela∣ware

the victory at the Brandywine, the taking of
Philadelphia, the destruction of the rebel ship∣ping,
the reduction of Mud-Island and Red-Bank,
were attended with none of those ad∣vantages,
which accompany successes in war.
That no person of great consequence, and few

persons, who followed that advice, fell a sacri∣fice,
to the relentless violence and unforgiving

Though these facts came forward with a
force, which commanded conviction, the fac∣tion
adhered, with invincible obstinacy, to the
line of their former conduct. With their usual
insult, upon the common feelings and common
sense of mankind, they established false pre∣mises,
and deduced, from those premises, ar∣guments
for the total dereliction, and conse∣quently,
for the dependance of America.
They affirmed, that rebellion can never be ex∣tinguished;
though the want of vigour, in pur∣suing
our successes, has been the demonstrable
cause of its continuing so long. They asserted,
that a general unanimity prevails against Great
Britain; though the adherence of the people
to the congress proceeded, from our not af∣fording
them a permanent protection, under
the shelter of our arms. They alleged, that the
courage of the rebels, and the natural strength
of their country, are unsurmountable obsta∣cles;
though the first seldom appear in the
field, but to fly, and the latter opens every
where its bosom to invasion, by the means of
extensive arms of the sea, and many great and
navigable rivers.</P>
<P>When we deny other public virtues to Op∣position,
we must allow, that they possess the
negative merit of consistency in their political
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
conduct. They struck one key, at the begin∣ning
of the American troubles, and they have
ever since continued the same note, or impro∣ved
upon it, as events arose. When the tu∣mults
began at Boston, when licentiousness and
riot exhibited their first wild scenes, in Fa∣neuil-Hall,
they encouraged the piece, by ap∣plauding
the actors. The prints of the depar∣ting
steps of Freedom, like those of Astraea,
were only to be found, they affirmed, round
the <HI>Tree</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> on Boston Common. A
gloomy despotism had seized Great Britain at
home, and it became necessary, that her hands
should be settered, to prevent the recovery of
her authority abroad. Every effort on the part
of the Mother-country was an exertion of ty∣ranny;
every resistance, in the colonies, was
an instance of public virtue. The grim tyrant,
Arbitrary Power, had taken up arms against
that <HI>innocent</HI> little child, American Liberty;
and to defend the weak against the strong was
a service of much reputation and little danger.</P>
<P>Obvious as the deceptions, held forth by the
party, <HI>ought</HI> to have been, they were attended
with success, both <HI>without</HI> and <HI>within</HI> doors.
The people thought, that assertions, so confi∣dently
and so often repeated, had some found∣ation
in truth; and, though Government knew
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
the contrary, they acted, as if they gave them
credit. The consequence was, that languid
measures were adopted, when vigour and exer∣tion
were necessary; and, thus, by the for∣bearance
of Administration, the encourage∣ment
of Opposition, the inactivity or inability
of commanders, that monster, REBELLION,
which should have been stifled as soon as born,
was fostered and reared to maturity.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for this country, Opposition
were permitted, in a manner, to take the lead
in American measures. War, and especially
rebellion, being one of the greatest evils, that
can afflict a state, the most speedy and power∣ful
remedies must be applied, to remove the
disease. The only certain road to peace lies
through exertion and victory. An anxiety for
negociation, being generally a mark of weak∣ness,
too often encourages an enemy to a conti∣nuation
of resistance. It has also a most unfa∣vourable
effect on the spirit of the people, a∣mong
whose leaders such anxiety appears. This
double consideration had rendered the propo∣sing
terms a favourite topic of patriotic elo∣quence.
To depress the minds of their coun∣trymen,
to elevate those of the rebels; to make
the first to doubt, the second to become con∣fident
of success; to keep up, if the expression
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
may be used, the ball of contention between
the parties, were circumstances that probably
might lengthen the dispute to the verge
of some public misfortune; that misfortune,
if it favoured not the views of ambition,
might, at least, be turned to the purposes of
revenge.</P>
<P>The calamity expected, with so much anxi∣ety,
by Opposition, at length arrived. An ar∣my
was lost in America. A rebellion, which
seemed to stagger under partial and ill-pursu∣ed
defeats, became firmly established by vic∣tory.
The spirits of the country began to sink;
and the Faction added to the general depressi∣on,
by their unmanly oratory. Instead of pro∣posing
those vigorous exertions, which the ho∣nour,
as well as interest of the nation required,
they recommended a tame submission to re∣bels;
an acknowledgment of former errors,
and assurances of future amendment. The
world, in general, ascribed to artifice a con∣duct
which could not be reconciled to the prin∣ciples
of common sense. Was it probable that
insurgents, who had offered no terms during
their misfortunes, would receive any in the
moment of victory? Or could it be expected,
that a Congress, who had declared for inde∣pendence,
when thirty thousand disciplined
soldiers were ready to land on the coast, would
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
relinquish that independence, after they had
made a whole army prisoners of war?</P>
<P>The most sanguine lovers of tranquility
could scarcely derive any hopes from this pa∣cific
system; but it was adopted. The Faction
thus obtained that degradation of their own
country, which seems to have been uniformly
a part of their plan. But as it had been justly
apprehended, that American resistance might,
at last, cease, through the failure of American
resources, it had become necessary to procure
powerful allies, for the support of the cause.
The defeat and capture of the army, under
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ne, had certainly its weight in
the French cabinet. But the deplorable pic∣ture
given, in both Houses, of the state of this
kingdom, could only induce France to throw
her weight into the scale of America.</P>
<P>The weight of France having been found
insufficient in the operations of the last sum∣mer,
the necessity of obtaining <HI>another</HI> ally, to
the <HI>cause of Liberty,</HI> became apparent during
the winter. Every encouragement and every
lure were held out to Spain. Under a pretence
of bewailing their unfortunate country, Oppo∣sition
exposed her weakness. Their own decla∣mations
shewed that her councils were dis∣tracted
by faction; and their assertions, rela∣tive
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
to the state of her navy and army, repre∣sented
her to foreigners as an easy prey. To
bring the certainty of her approaching ruin to
a point of demonstration, some theorists, ac∣quainted
with figures, were employed to make
fictitious states of her finances. Even some of
the party had the folly, or rather presumption,
to assert, in public, that the very indepen∣dence
of Great Britain was in the power of
the house of Bourbon<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Contemptible as such assertions may seem, at home,
they make an impression abroad; as appears, from the
<HI>Gazette de France du Vendredi</HI> 18 <HI>Juin</HI> 1779: "Il soutint
que les forces de la France étoient presque egales a celle
de la Grand-Bretagne en Europe et en Amerique; que
I'Espagne tenoit la balance. Il osa prononcer que Il' An∣gleterre
ne domineroit plus, sur les mers, qu'autant
qu'il plairoit à la Maison de Bourbon."—L'<HI>eloquent</HI>
Burke soutint que le Sieur Hartley avoit rien avancé, qui
ne fut vrai il appuya cette opinion, par un detail circon∣stancie
de toutes les forces del'Espagne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The phlegmatic councils of Spain were, how∣ever,
too slow for the fire and vehemence of
her British friends. Though their eloquence
had its proper influence at Madrid, that <HI>desira∣ble</HI>
circumstance had been concealed in "Cas∣tilian
taciturnity." Deprived almost of every
hope, from the other side of the Bay of Biscay,
the eyes of our Patriots were again turned to
the regions beyond the Atlantic. As the treaty
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
attempted last summer had stopt the operati∣ons
of war, it was expedient to throw negoti∣ation
in the way of hostility in the present year.
Though the party had reprobated their <HI>own</HI>
measure, the conciliatory bills, as degrading
and disgraceful, they proposed the renewal of
the commission, which those bills authorized.
This mode of relief, or rather respite, to rebel∣lion,
having been refused, the old proposal, of
withdrawing the troops from America, was
renewed. This last effort was also unsuccess∣ful;
and that melancholy gloom, which usu∣ally
covers the rear of unsuccessful, political
campaigns, began to fall on the party.</P>
<P>A sudden, though not unexpected light,
broke through this gloom, and revived their
drooping spirits. Spain, being seduced by
France, and, perhaps, encouraged by the re∣presentations
given, in our public assemblies,
of our weakness<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Le Sieur Thowsend, Fox et Burke furent, parmi les
opposans, ceux qui signalérent davantage contre cette mo∣tion,
en observant que la nation dans l'etat alarmant ou
celle se trouvoit s'epuisoit par des dèpenses énormes, tan∣dis
que chaque jour lui decouvroit quelque nouvelle enne∣mi;
que l'Espagne alloit immanquablement se declarer;

pour se soulever contre le gouvernement An∣glois;
que l'ECOSSE <HI>meme</HI> etoit plein de mècontents. Ga∣zette

<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
weight in the scale of our enemies. Of <HI>One
hundred</HI> injuries, which she had received, she
only specified <HI>two,</HI> and proved <HI>none.</HI> With
peculiar attention to her worthy friends <HI>out</HI>
of office, she pointed her whole resentment
against the British Ministry. These men, it
seems, had grievously offended this froward
Dame; but how or where, she could not
tell. When she has time to recollect the cir∣cumstances,
BUCCARELLI, or some other old
Spanish acquaintance, will, no doubt, com∣municate
them to C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ré, and then we
shall know the whole.</P>
<P>The uniform conduct of Opposition seemed
calculated, if not intended, to arm Spain in fa∣vour
of France and America; yet they affect∣ed
a degree of melancholy when that event was
announced. With a pernicious consistency,
they dwelt on the weakness of Great Britain,
and on the force of her enemies. Instead of
standing forth with that manly boldness, which
other patriots have either felt or feigned, in
times of peril, they unbraced the nerves of their
country with womanish lamentations. To
magnify the danger, they pretended to recom∣mend
unanimity; and to promife support to
the S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n, whilst they undermined his just
influence and authority. But the notes of af∣fected
sorrow were soon changed for the voice
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
of discord; and it became apparent, that the
party lamented their own condition more than
the state of their country.</P>
<P>In the preceding detail, many circumstan∣ces
are omitted, equally descriptive of the
conduct, and expressive of the designs of Op∣position,
with those that have been related.
But, as the intention of this Essay is only
to give a general idea of the subject, it was
thought unnecessary to descend to every par∣ticular.
One obvious observation will natural∣ly
suggest itself to the mind of the Reader:
That an Opposition begun in ambition, has
degenerated, through disappointment, into a
species of infinity; and that, in attempting
to ruin the Ministry, the party have given a
fatal stab to the honour and interests of their
country.</P>
<P>In every popular government, opposition is
not only natural, but, when conducted on libe∣ral
principles, useful, and even necessary.
There is a kind of charm in authority, which
may induce the most virtuous magistrates to
extend it too far, if subject to no controul.
The original object of a national representative,
was to watch over the political rights of the
executive power. The trust is great; and,
strictly speaking, ought to be solely appro∣priated
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
to the public good. Those who use it
as an engine of private ambition and personal
inrerest, meet with forgiveness, on account of
the frequency of the practice. But the employ∣ing
a weapon, given for the defence of our
country, against its existence, is a species of
political assassination which no example can
justify, no state ought to pass without punish∣ment.</P>
<P>If the great lines of the conduct of Oppositi∣on,
during the last session of parliament, have
been fairly traced, in the preceding disquisiti∣on,
no terms can be too severe, no indignati∣on
too violent, in exposing the principles and
plans of the party. If the account, which has
been given of their assertions and actions, has
been exaggerated, the Public will judge of
both with more candour. But, unfortunately
for Great Britain, the stamp of truth has been
affixed to the representation, contained in this
Essay, by the most uncontrovertible of all argu∣ments,
the events of the times: events unparal∣leled
in the history of any other age or country.</P>
<P>Let the consequences of an opposite conduct,
in the party, be considered, for a moment.
Let it be supposed, that, instead of abetting re∣bellion
and encouraging foreign war, they had
declared that, when the American Congress
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
avowed Independence, and especially when they
leagued with France, the grounds of the origi∣nal
question were entirely changed. That, as
friends of their country, they had resolved to
strengthen her hands, to restore her authority,
to protect her interests, and to recover her ho∣nour.
That the object of their pursuit had been
to render Ministers responsible for remissness in
carrying on the war; or for obstinacy in refusing
adequate and honourable conditions of peace.
That they had been the first to inquire into the
failure of measures in the execution; not to
assert without examination, that the error lay
in the cabinet and not in the field. That they
had taken measures to ascertain, by what mis∣management
or misconduct, in commanders, an
army had been lost, to a contemptible enemy,
and a superior fleet had returned from action,
without a victory? That, instead of receiving
into the bosom of their party, a general, who
had quitted his command in the midst of war,
they had inquired, why the advantages, he
either possessed or obtained, had not been more
decisively improved?</P>
<P>To render still more finished the picture of
the reverse of their actual proceedings, let it be
supposed, that instead of announcing, to all
Europe, the weakness of Great Britain, they
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
had, in their speeches and their actions, exhi∣bited
a spirited and disinterested love for their
country, an unanimity to arm her exertions,
not to clog her measures, a manly boldness to
meet, to break, to disconcert the combinations
of her domestic and foreign enemies. What
would have been, in such a case, the present
situation of public affairs? What the state of
public opinion, relative to themselves? The re∣sistance
of America must have ceased. France
might have given up the contest; and the junc∣tion
of Spain would have been prevented.</P>
<P>One should suppose it hardly possible, that an
Opposition, consisting of several men, whose rank
and fortune connect their private interest with
that of the public, should follow a line of con∣duct,
that leads to the destruction of their coun∣try,
and, consequently, to their own ruin. This
is an argument which they themselves repeat, and
think unanswerable. The truth is, that every
faction may avail itself of the same argument;
but general reasoning must fall to the ground,
when contradicted by facts. There is a pride
and obstinacy in party, which disdain to ac∣knowledge
error; and, therefore, though Op∣position
may, nay must, perceive the pernicious
tendency of their conduct, they choose to persist,
rather than own a fault.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54"/>
An opportunity offered itself lately, which
might have reflected credit on Opposition, with∣out
the supposed disgrace of changing their
former opinions. The Spanish <HI>Rescript</HI> fur∣nished
this opportunity; yet the nation cannot
see, without indignation and astonishment, that
ACTS indispensably necessary for the safety of
the State have been combated, with all the vi∣rulence
and obstinacy of oratory, in every stage
of their progress. That the party clogged every
measure for arming the kingdom, by sea and
land, while they asserted, that the enemy were
ready to invade our coast, and that a few days
might bring the report of their guns to the ears
of both houses of parliament. That, when a
spirit of unanimity and exertion became the duty
of all lovers of their country, the faction an∣nounced,
with a species of savage triumph, that
the City of London would not vote a man
or a shilling, for the national defence in the pre∣sent
emergency. That, in short, they presumed to
assert in public, that the tyranny of France and
Spain would be more welcome to them, than
the continuance of their rivals in power.</P>
<P>After such proofs of aversion to the public
good, it will be in vain to hope for any reform∣ation
in Opposition. The distress in which they
have involved their country, can advance but
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
one step farther, to furnish them with an oppor∣tunity
of retreating from the line of their miscon∣duct.
That step is an invasion of this Island,
the last effort of the conspiracy of our foreign
enemies. In that critical moment, a moment
which every good subject would meet with spirit
and confidence in his cause, there is every rea∣son
to fear, that Opposition would be still an
Opposition. Such has been the inveteracy which
a consciousness of criminality, a jealousy of rivals,
a habit of opposing the interests and degrading
the dignity of their country; and a despair em∣bittered
by an unpopular and fruitless contest of
many years, have mixed with every spring of
their actions, every power of their minds.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we may fairly affirm,
that neither the talents they possess, nor the
conduct they have pursued, are likely to re∣commend
Opposition as proper persons for ma∣naging
public affairs at the present crisis. If
our situation is alarming, we must look for re∣lief
to the resources of the kingdom, and the
spirit of our countrymen, and not to those, who
have uniformly endeavoured to depreciate the
first, and to damp the second. The truth is,
that, very fortunately for this country, this
desponding party have hitherto failed in their
views of convincing us that our ruin is inevitable.
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
We feel the contrary, in the internal vigour of
the state, and in that unanimity of sentiment
among the people, which forbids us to connect
danger with despair.</P>
<P>But why should either be mentioned, upon
the present occasion? This country, with much
smaller resources, and much less unanimity, has
repeatedly weathered more dreadful storms than
those which only <HI>seem</HI> to threaten it at present.
In the first Dutch war, France and Denmark
joined the enemy against England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In 1665, 1666, &amp;c. <HI>Vide</HI> Life of Clarendon,
Burnet, Rapin, Ralph, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. She had
no friendly port on the continent, from the Pyre∣nees
to the pole; no ally but the Bishop of
Munster. The Dutch came out, to a decisive
battle, with one hundred and thirteen ships of
war, eleven fire-ships, and seven yatchts; led by
able, experienced, and brave commanders.
France, co-operating with her allies, entered
the Channel with forty ships of the line. The
usual revenue of England amounted only to the
annual sum of one million two hundred thou∣sand
pounds; and the supplies granted, for the
year, exceeded not double that sum. Our
standing army scarcely consisted of five thou∣sand
men; and there was no militia in the king∣dom.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57"/>
The nation was, in the mean time, visited
with two of the most dreadful calamities that
can afflict a people, pestilence and fire. Near
eighty thousand persons had been carried off by
the first, in London alone. The city had become
a kind of desert; and grass was observed to
grow in the middle of Cheapside<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 637.</NOTE>. The
plague followed those who fled to the country;
and terror and death filled every corner of the
kingdom. This scourge was followed by a
fire, which consumed fifteen out of the twenty∣six
wards of the city, consisting of four hundred
streets and lanes, thirteen thousand houses, and
eighty-nine parish-churches<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vide Clarendon, Heath, Burnet.</NOTE>. But these mis∣fortunes
neither damped the spirits of the
people, nor obstructed the measures of Govern∣ment.
Our fleets, though much inferior, fought,
and vanquished the enemy. The alliance against
us was broken, and an honourable and advan∣tageous
peace was obtained.</P>
<P>In the year 1690, the French fleet entered
the English channel, appeared before Plymouth,
on the 20th of June, drove the combined fleets
of England and Holland, from the back, of the
isle of Wight, engaged and totally defeated
them, in a general battle, near Beachy-head.
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
In this unfortunate action we lost eight ships of
the line, besides many more, that were rendered
unfit for service; and the shattered remains of
the fleet were forced to shelter themselves in the
Thames<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lord Torrington's Letter, July 1, 1690.</NOTE>. The French rode triumphant,
for some months, in the Channel. They in∣sulted
our sea-ports; and threatened our coasts
with invasion. There were, at the time, no
more than <HI>five thousand</HI> regular troops in Eng∣land;
the militia were not arrayed; King Wil∣liam
was, in a manner, confined to Ireland, by
the superiority of the enemy at sea.</P>
<P>The nation was, at the same time, dis∣tracted
and divided in opinion, on account
of a disputed succession. Public credit, du∣ring
the whole war, was so low, that soon
after this period, Exchequer and Navy Bills
became almost of as little value, as the paste∣board
dollars of the American Congress; and
even the notes of the Bank of England were
at <HI>forty per cent.</HI> discount<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Kennet, Ralph, Burnet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. Near <HI>six thou∣sand</HI>
trading vessels were taken by the French in
the course of the war<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vide Journals of the Commons, 169<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding
these misfortunes, the vigour of Government
and spirit of the people surmounted all difficul∣ties
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
The enemy was disappointed, in all his
ambitious views, an honourable peace was ob∣tained,
the revolution confirmed, the protest∣ant
succession secured, and public credit re∣stored.</P>
<P>In the present times, our resources are much
greater, our spirit equal, and our danger less,
than at either of those periods. We have an
ample revenue, an untainted credit, a great and
a growing navy. Instead of <HI>five thousand</HI> men,
we have above <HI>sixty thousand</HI> disciplined troops,
for our internal defence; and we have a certain
prospect of half as many more, in the space of
a few months. A spirit of unanimity, vigour,
and exertion, begins to pervade the whole king∣dom.
Our nobility and gentry, with a spirit
becoming Britons, either serve in our constitu∣tional
defence, the militia, or with their in∣fluence
and purses exert themselves, in raising
new corps. The greatest commercial society,
in the kingdom, has set a noble example to
their fellow-subjects, by an unanimous and
powerful aid to the state, in the present emer∣gency.
Voluntary subscriptions, for raising sol∣diers,
and for giving a bounty to sailors, have
been opened, in several places; and the same
spirit will diffuse itself through both the British
isles. Such as are debarred, by infirmities and
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
years, from personal service, will undoubtedly
exhibit, on the present occasion, their love for
their country, and their zeal for its safety.</P>
<P>Instead of being depressed, with a sense of
danger, all ranks and degrees of men feel that
elevation, which threatened perils excite, in
generous minds. Instead of looking forward to
future disgraces or disasters, they reflect on the
glory of former times. The posterity of those,
who conquered at Poictiers, Cressy, and Agin∣court,
and annexed France itself to the English
crown, cannot form to themselves any fears from
a French invasion. On the contrary, when they
have sufficiently prepared for security at home,
they will act offensively abroad; and carry back
to the bosom of the enemy that terror, which
he vainly hopes to create.</P>
<P>If we are at war in America, we have
not the burden of a continental war; that
sink, in which our treasure has always dis∣appeared,
without any hope of return. The
money laid out on our navy, or expended in
our Colonies, will return to the center of the
kingdom, through all the veins of commerce.
Our trade has been protected, against the ene∣my,
to a degree unknown in any former war.
We have lost, in no quarter of the world, any
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
territory without an equivalent; in some we
have gained. In the West Indies, we are still
superior to our Enemies. We have eradicated
them entirely from the East Indies, and we
have a flattering prospect of a speedy termina∣tion
of resistance, in North America.</P>
<P>In the first stage of a war, the advantage of
attack is possessed, by that nation, who first
breaks the peace. The disadvantages of de∣fence
must, for some time, remain with its op∣ponent.
A state possessing such extensive do∣minions,
as Great Britain, cannot be supposed,
to be invulnerable, on every side. We may
suffer some losses, at the beginning; for what
people was ever uniformly successful in war?
The Romans themselves were not always invinci∣ble.
They frequently lost provinces and ar∣mies;
yet they rose superior to all nations. The
profits and losses of war can only be estimated,
on the day, which concludes a peace. Let us
be unanimous among ourselves, and that day
cannot be distant, disadvantageous, or disho∣nourable;
on the contrary, it will be attended
with that glory, which the spirit and exertion of
a great state cannot fail to acquire.</P>
