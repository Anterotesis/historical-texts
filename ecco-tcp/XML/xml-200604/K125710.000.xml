<STAGE>Lady <HI>SNEERWELL</HI> and <HI>SNAKE</HI> discovered at a tea-table.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady SNEERWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE paragraphs, you say, Mr. Snake, were all
inserted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, Madam; and as I copied them
myself in a seigned hand, there can be no suspicion
from whence they came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you circulate the report of Lady
Brittle's intrigue with Captain Boastall?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's in as fine a train as your Ladyship could
wish; in the common course of things, I think it must
reach Mrs. Clacket's ears within twenty-four hours,
and then the business, you know, is as good as done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, Mrs. Clacket has talents,
and a great deal of industry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>True Madam, and has been tolerably suc∣cessful
in her day; to my knowledge she has been the
cause of six matches being broken off, and three sons
disinherited; of four forced elopments, as many close
confinements, nine separate maintenances, and two di∣vorces;
—nay, I have more than once traced her cau∣sing
a <HI>tete a tete</HI> in the Town and Country Magazine,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
when the parties never saw one another before in the
whole course of their lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, she has genius, but her
manner is too gross.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam; she has a fine tongue, and a
bold invention; but then her colouring is too dark,
and the outlines rather too extravagant; she wants that
delicacy of hint, and mellowness of sneer, which dis∣tinguishes
your Ladyship's scandal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are partial, Snake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least; every body will allow that
Lady Sneerwell can do more with a word or look than
many others with the most laboured detail, even though
they accidentally happen to have a little truth on their
side to support it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear Snake, and I'll not deny
the pleasure I feel at the success of my schemes; <STAGE>(<HI>both
rise</HI>)</STAGE> wounded myself, in the early part of my life, by
the envenomed tongue of slander, I confess nothing
can give me greater satisfaction, than reducing others
to the level of my own injured reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam; but there is one affair, in
which you have lately employed me, wherein, I confess,
I am at a loss to guess at your motives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I presume you mean with regard to my
friend Sir Peter Teazle, and his family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; here are two young men, to whom Sir
Peter has acted as guardian since their father's death;
the eldest possessing the most amiable character, and
universally well spoken of; the youngest the most dis∣sipated,
wild, extravagant young fellow in the world;
the former an avowed admirer of your Ladyship, and
apparently your favourite; the latter attached to Maria,
Sir Peter's ward, and confessedly admired by her: Now,
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
on the face of these circumstances, it is utterly un∣accountable
to me, why you, the widow of a city
Knight, with a large fortune, should not immediately
close with the passion of a man of such character and
expectation as Mr. Surface; and more so, why you are
so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual attach∣ment
subsisting between his brother Charles and Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then at once, to unravel this mystery,
I must inform you, that love has no share whatever in
the intercourse between Mr. Surface and me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! his real views are to Maria, or
her fortune, while in his brother he finds a favoured
rival; he is, therefore, obliged to mask his real inten∣tions,
and profit by my assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet still I am more puzzled why you should
interest yourself for his success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! how dull you are! can't you
surmise a weakness I have hitherto through shame con∣cealed
even from you? Must I confess it that Charles,
that profligate, that libertine, that bankrupt in fortune
and reputation, that he it is for whom I am thus anxi∣ous
and malicious; and to gain whom I would sacrifice
every thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, indeed, your conduct appears consist∣ent;
but pray how came you and Mr. Surface so con∣fidential?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>For our mutual interest; he pretends
to, and recommends sentiment and liberality, but I
know him to be artful, close and malicious. In short,
a sentimental knave, while with Sir Peter, and indeed
with most of his acquaintances he passes for a youth∣ful
miracle of virtue, good sense, and benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know Sir Peter vows he has not his
fellow in England, and has praised him as a man of
character and sentiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and with the appearance of be∣ing
sentimental, he has brought Sir Peter to favour his
addresses to Maria, while poor Charles has no friend
in the house, though I fear he has a powerful one in
Maria's heart, against whom we must direct our
schemes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SERVANT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Surface, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew him up <STAGE>(<HI>exit Servant</HI>)</STAGE> he ge∣nerally
calls about this hour—I don't wonder at peo∣ple's
giving him to me for a lover.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JOSEPH SURFACE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Sneerwell, good morning to you—
Mr. Snake your most obedient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Snake has just been rallying me up∣on
our attachment, but I have told him our real views;
I need not tell you how useful he has been to us, and
believe me, our confidence has not been ill placed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, 'tis impossible for me to sus∣pect
a man of Mr. Snake's merit and accomplish∣ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no compliments; but tell me
when you saw Maria, or what's more material to us,
your brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen either since I left you, but I
can tell you they never met; some of your stories have
had a good effect in that quarter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>The merit of this, my dear Snake, be∣longs
to you; but do your brother's distresses increase?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every hour! I am told he had another exe∣cution
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
in his house yesterday—in short, his dissipation
and extravagance exceeds any thing I ever heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Charles!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Poor Charles indeed! notwithstand∣ing
his extravagance one cannot help pitying him; I
wish it was in my power to be of any essential service
to him; for the man who does not feel for the distresses
of a brother, even though merited by his own mis∣conduct,
deserves to be—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you are going to be moral, and
forget you are among friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad, so I was, ha! ha!—I'll keep that
sentiment till I see Sir Peter, ha! ha! however it
would certainly be a generous act in you to rescue
Maria from such a libertine, who, if he is to be re∣claimed
at all, can only be so by a person of your su∣perior
accomplishments and understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snake.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Lady Sneerwell, here's company
coming; I'll go and copy the letter I mentioned to
your Ladyship. Mr. Surface, your most obedient.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Exit Snake.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Snake, your most obedient. I wonder
Lady Sneerwell, you would put any confidence in
that fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have discovered he has of late had several
conferences with old Rowley, who was formerly my
father's steward; he has never, you know, been a
friend of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think he would betray us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not unlikely; and take my word for it,
Lady Sneerwell, that fellow has not virtue enough to
be faithful to his own villanies.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<HI>Enter</HI> MARIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Maria, my dear, how do you do?
What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, Madam, only this odious lover of
mine, Sir Benjamin Backbite, and his uncle Crabtree,
just called in at my guardian's; but I took the first op∣portunity
to slip out, and run away to your Ladyship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had my brother Charles been of the party
you would not have been so much alarmed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now you are too severe; for I
dare say the truth of the matter is, Maria heard you
was here, and therefore came; but pray Maria, what
particular objection have you to Sir Benjamin, that you
avoid him so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam, he has done nothing; but his
whole conversation is a perpetual libel upon all his
acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the worst of it is, there is no ad∣vantage
in not knowing him, for he would abuse a
stranger as soon as his best friend, and his uncle is as
bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I own wit looses its respect
with me, when I see it in company with malice;—
what think you Mr. Surface?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Madam,—to smile at a jest that
plants a thorn in the breast of another, is to become a
principal in the mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pash—there is no possibility of being
witty without a little ill nature; the malice in a good
thing is the barb that makes it stick.—What is your
<HI>real</HI> opinion, Mr. Surface?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my opinion is, that where the spirit
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
of railery is suppressed, the conversation must be natu∣rally
insipid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well I will not answer how far slander may
be allowed, but in a man, I am sure it is despicable.—
We have pride, envy, rivalship, and a thousand mo∣tives
to depreciate each other; but the male slanderer,
must have the cowardice of a woman, before he can
traduce one.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SERVANT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Candour, Madam, if you are at
leisure, will leave her carriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Desire her to walk up. <STAGE>(<HI>Exit servant.</HI>)</STAGE>
Now, Maria, here's a character to your taste; though
Mrs. Candour is a little talkative, yet every body al∣lows
she is the best natured sort of woman in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—with the very gross affectation of
good nature, she does more mischief than the direct
malice of old Crabtree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith it's very true; and whenever I hear
the current of abuse running hard against the characters
of my best friends I never think them in such danger,
as when Candour undertakes their defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! Hush! here she is.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mrs.</HI> CANDOUR.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! my dear Lady Sneerwell; well,
how do you do? Mr. Surface your most obedient.—Is
there any news abroad? No! nothing good I suppose
—No! nothing but scandal!—nothing but scandal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph,</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so indeed, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but scandal!—Ah, Maria
how do you do child; what is every thing at an end
between you and Charles? What, he is too extrava∣gant.
—Aye! the town talks of nothing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, Madam, the town is so ill em∣ployed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour,</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, so am I child—but what can
one do? we can't stop people's tongues:—They hint
too, that your guardian and his Lady don't live so
agreeably together as they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure such reports are without foun∣dation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, so these things generally are:
—It's like Mr. Fashion's affair with Colonel Goterie;
though, indeed, that affair was never rightly cleared
up; and it was but yesterday Miss Prim assured me,
that Mr. and Mrs. Honeymoon were now become mere
man and wife, like the rest of their acquaintance. She
likewise hinted, that a certain widow in the next street,
had got rid of her dropsy, and recovered her shape in
a most surprizing manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>The licence of invention, some people give
themselves, is astonishing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis so—but how will you stop
people's tongues? 'Twas but yesterday Mrs. Clacket
informed me, that our old friend, Miss Prudely, was
going to elope, and that her guardian caught her just
stepping into the York Diligence, with her dancing∣master.
I was informed too, that Lord Flimsey caught
his wife at a house of no extraordinary fame, and that
Tom Saunter and Sir Harry Idle, were to measure
swords on a similar occasion.—But I dare say there is
no truth in the story, and I would not circulate such
a report for the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You report!—No, no, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no,—tale-bearers are just as
bad as the tale-makers.</P>

<P>Lady Sneerwell, your most obedient humble
servant. Mrs. Candour, I believe you don't know my
nephew, Sir Benjamin Backbite; he has a very pretty
taste for poetry, and shall make a rebus or a cherard
with any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh fie! uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>In faith he will: did you ever hear the
lines he made at Lady Ponto's route, on Miss Frizzle's
feathers catching fire; and the rebuses—his first is
the name of a fish; the next, a great naval comman∣der,
and—</P>

<P>Uncle, now prythee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, Sir Benjamin you never
publish any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to say the truth, 'tis very
vulgar to print—and as my little productions are
chiefly satyrs, and lampoons on particular persons, I
find they circulate better by giving copies in confidence
to the friends of the parties;—however, I have some
love elegies, which, when favoured by this Lady's
smiles <STAGE>(<HI>to Maria</HI>)</STAGE> I mean to give to the public.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Foregad, Madam, they'll immortalize
you <STAGE>(<HI>to Maria</HI>)</STAGE> you will be handed down to posterity,
like Petrarch's Laura, or Waller's Sacharissa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, I think you'll like
them <STAGE>(<HI>to Maria</HI>)</STAGE> when you shall see them on a beau∣tiful
quarto type, where a neat rivulet of text shall
murmur through a meadow of margin;—'foregad
they'll be the most elegant things of their kind.</P>

<P>What—do you mean the report of—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, that's not it—Miss Nicely
going to be married to her footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, indeed Madam, every
thing is fixed, and the wedding liveries bespoke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they do say there were very
pressing reasons for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard something of this before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! it cannot be; and I wonder
they'd report such a thing of so prudent a Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but Madam, that is the very
reason that it was believed at once, for she has always
been so very cautious and reserved, that every body
was sure there was some reason for it at bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, there is a sort of puny,
sickly reputation, that would outlive the robuster cha∣racter
of an hundred prudes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam, there are Valetudi∣narians
in reputation, as well as constitution, who being
conscious of their weak part, avoid the least breath
of air, and supply their want of stamina by care and
circumspection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe this may be some mis∣take;
you know, Sir Benjamin, very trifling circum∣stances
have often given rise to the most ingenious tales.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true;—but odso, Ladies did you
hear of Miss Letitia Piper's losing her lover and her
character at Scarborough.—Sir Benjamin you remem∣ber
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, to be sure, the most whimsical
circumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Sneerwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, one evening, at Lady Spadille's
assembly, the conversation happened to turn upon the
difficulty of breeding Nova-Scotia sheep in this coun∣try;
no, says a lady present, I have seen an instance
of it, for a cousin of mine, Miss Letitia Piper had one
that produced twins. What, what, says old Lady
Dundizzy (whom we all know is as deaf as a post) has
Miss Letitia Piper had twins.—This, you may easily
imagine, set the company in a loud laugh; and the
next morning it was every where reported, and be∣lieved
that Miss Letitia Piper had actually been brought
to bed of a fine boy and girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Omnes.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true upon my honour.—Oh, Mr.
Surface, how do you do; I hear your uncle, Sir Oliver
is expected in town; sad news upon his arrival, to hear
how your brother has gone on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope no busy people have already preju∣diced
his uncle against him—he may reform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, he may; for my part, I never
thought him so utterly void of principle as people
say—and though he has lost all his friends, I am told
nobody is better spoken of amongst the Jews.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crabtree.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Foregad, if the Old Jewry was a ward,
Charles would be an Alderman, for he pays as many
annuities as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish Tontine; and when he is sick,
they have prayers for his recovery in all their Syna∣gogues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Benjamin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet no man lives in greater splendor.
They tell me, when he entertains his friends, he can sit
down to dinner with a dozen of his own securities,
have a score of tradesmen waiting in the antichamber,
and an officer behind every guest's chair.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHEN an old batchelor marries a young wise,
what is he to expect?—'Tis now about six
months since my Lady Teazle made me the happiest of
men—and I have been the most miserable dog ever
since.—We tifted a little going to church, and fairly
quarrelled before the bells were done ringing. I was
more than once nearly choaked with gall during the
honey moon, and had lost every satisfaction in life, be∣fore
my friends had done wishing me joy.—And yet,
I chose with caution a girl bred wholly in the country,
who had never known luxury, beyond one silk gown,
or dissipation beyond the annual gala of a race ball.—
Yet, now she plays her part in all the extravagant fop∣peries
of the town, with as good a grace is if she had
never seen a bush, or a grass plot out of Grosvenor-Square.
—I am sneered at by all my acquaintance—
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
paragraphed in the news-papers—she dissipates my for∣tune,
and contradicts all my humours.—And yet, the
worst of it is, I doubt I love her, or I should never
bear all this—but I am determined never to be weak
enough to let her know it—No! no! no!</P>

<P>I'm sorry to hear that—what has hap∣pened
to make you uneasy since yesterday?</P>
</SP>

<P>Come, come, Sir Peter, notwithstanding
you sometimes dispute and disagree, I am sure you
love her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Master Rowley; but the worst of
it is, that in all our disputes and quarrels, she is ever
in the wrong, and continues to thwart and vex me;—
I am myself the sweetest tempered man in the world,
and so I tell her an hundred times a day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir Peter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—and then there's Lady Sneerwell,
and the set she meets at her house, encourage her to
disobedience; and Maria, my ward, she too presumes
to have a will of her own, and refuses the man I pro∣pose
for her; designing, I suppose to bestow herself
and fortune upon that profligate his brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir Peter, I have often taken
the liberty to differ in opinion with you, in regard to
these two young men, for Charles, my life on't will 
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
retrieve all one day or other.—Their worthy father,
my once honoured master, at his years, was full as wild
and extravagant as Charles now is; but at his death
he did not leave a more benevolent heart to lament
his loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are wrong, Mr. Rowley, you are
very wrong;—by their father's will, you know, I be∣came
guardian to these young men, which gave me an
opportunity of knowing their different dispositions;
but their uncle's Eastern liberality soon took them out
of my power, by giving them an early independence.
—But for Charles, whatever good qualities he might
have inherited, they are long since squandered away
with the rest of his fortune;—Joseph, indeed, is a
pattern for the young men of the age—a youth of the
noblest sentiments, and acts up to the sentiments he
professes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; Sir Peter, I shan't oppose
your opinion at present, though I am sorry you are
prejudiced against Charles, as this may probably be
the most critical period of his life, for his uncle, Sir
Oliver, is arrived, and now in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! my old friend, Sir Oliver, is he
arrived? I thought you had not expected him this
month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more we did, Sir, but his passage has
been remarkably quick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be heartily glad to see him—'tis
sixteen years since old Noll and I met—But does he still
enjoin us to keep his arrival a secret from his nephews?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does, Sir, and is determined, under
a feigned character, to make trial of their different
dispositions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! there is no need of it, for Joseph,
I am sure is the man.—But hark'ye, Rowley, does Sir
Oliver know that I am married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does, Sir, and intends shortly to wish
you joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, as we wish health to a friend in a
consumption.—But I must have him at my house—
do you conduct him, Rowley, I'll go and give orders
for his reception <STAGE>(<HI>going</HI>)</STAGE> We used to rail at matrimony
together—he has stood firm to his text.—But Rowley,
don't give him the least hint that my wife and I dis∣agree,
for I would have him think (<HI>Heaven forgive me</HI>)
that we are a happy couple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must be careful not to quarrel
whilst he is here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so we must—but that will be im∣possible!

<P>Why, don't I know that no woman of

<P>You forget the humble state I took you
from—the daughter of a poor country 'squire—when
I came to your father's, I found you sitting at your
tambour, in a linen gown, a bunch of keys to your
side, and your hair combed smoothly over a roll.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Teazle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember very well;—my daily
occupations were to overlook the dairy, superintend
the poultry, make extracts from the family receipt
book, and combany aunt Deborah's lap dog.</P>

<P>My evening employments were to draw
patterns for ruffles, which I had not materials to make
up; play at Pope Joan with the curate; read a sermon
to my aunt Deborah, or perhaps be stuck up at an old
spinnet to trum my father to sleep after a fox-chace.</P>

Now, madam, you must have your coach, viz-a-viz,
and three powdered coachmen to walk before your
chair; and in summer, two white cats to draw you to
Kensington-Gardens; and instead of your living in that
hole in the country, I have brought you home here,
made a woman of fortune of you, a woman of quality

Mrs. Quadrille's last night.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>

<P>That's very true, indeed.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Teazle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.—I'm told she absolutely lives upon
acids and small whey, laces herself with pullies;—
often in the hottest day in summer, you shall see her on
a little squat poney, with her hair platted and turned
up like a drummer, and away she goes puffing round
the ring in a full trot.</P>

<P>I vow you shan't be so severe upon

at six and thirty.</P>

she reads by candle-light, 'tis not to be wondered at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Candour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and for her manner, I
think it very graceful, considering she never had any
education; for her mother you know, was a Welch
milliner, and her father a sugar-baker at Bristol.</P>

<P>His prejudice against him is astonishing,

<P>Why, Sir, this Mr. Stanley was a near re∣lation
of their mother's, and formerly an eminent mer∣chant
in Dublin—he failed in trade, and is greatly
reduced; he has applied by letter to Mr. Surface and
Charles for assistance—from the former of whom he
has received nothing but fair promises; while Charles
in the midst of his own distresses, is at present endea∣vouring
to raise a sum of money, part of which I know
he intends for the use of Mr. Stanley.</P>

<P>Why Sir, I have persuaded him, there's
no prospect of his being paid several sums of money he
has advanced for Charles, but through the bounty of
Sir Oliver, who he knows is in town; therefore you
may depend on his being faithful to his interest—Oh!

his fortune, without being ruined by coming into

<P>'Pshaw! hold your tongue—my friend
Moses, sir, is a very honest fellow, but a little slow at
expression—I shall cut the matter very short;—
I'm an extravagant young fellow that wants to borrow

money; and you, as I take it are a prudent old fellow
who has got money to lend—I am such a fool as to
give fifty per cent. rather than go without it; and you
I suppose are rogue enough to take an hundred if you
can get it. And now we understand one another, and
may proceed to business without further ceremony.</P>

<P>Sir, I like you the better for it—How∣ever
you are mistaken in one thing; I have no money
to lend, but I believe I could procure you some from
a friend; but then he's a damn'd unconscionable dog;
is he not Moses?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moses.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but you can't help that.</P>

the truth, and scorn to tell a lye.</P>

upon my soul I shall be sincerely sorry to hear any
thing has happened to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not more than I should I assure you.
But the bond you mention happens to be the worst se∣curity
you could offer me, for I might live to be an

<P>Oh, yes you would, for the moment he
dies, you come upon me for the money.</P>

that my uncle is too good a life.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, there you are misinformed. No,—no,
poor uncle Oliver? he breaks a pace. The climate, sir,

<P>Then there's my friend Lady Sneerwell,
has propagated malicious stories about me—and what's
very provoking, all too without the least foundation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ah! there's the mischief; for when a scan∣dalous

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Teazle.</SPEAKER>

grounds for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, for when a husband grows sus∣picious,

it then becomes a part of her duty to endeavour to
out wit him.—You owe it to the natural privilege of
your sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Teazle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="62"/>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear lady Teazle, 'tis that con∣sciousness
of your innocence that ruins you.—What
is it that makes you imprudent in your conduct, and
careless of the censures of the world? The conscious∣ness
of your innocence—What is it makes you regard∣less
of forms, and inattentive to your husband's peace?
Why, the consciousness of your innocence.—Now my
dear Lady Teazel, if you could only be prevailed up∣on
to make a trifling <HI>faux pas,</HI> you cant imagine how
circumspect you would grow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Teazle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think so?</P>
</SP>

No, no, I have too much honour for that.</P>

In short, Lady Teazle's behaviour of late has given
me very great uneasiness. She not only dissipates and
destroys my fortune, but I have strong reasons to be∣lieve
she has formed an attachment elsewhere.</P>

<P>Ah, the goodness of your own mind

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Very true, Sir Peter.—The man who is
conscious of his own integrity of heart, is very slow
to credit another's baseness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, that the son of my old friend
should practise against the honour of my family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there's the case, Sir Peter,—when
ingratitude barbs the dart of injury, the wound feels
double smart.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What noble sentiments!—He never
used a sentiment, ungrateful boy! that I acted as guar∣dian
to, and who was brought up under my eye; and
I never in my life refused him—my advice.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, Sir Peter,—he may be such
a man—if it be so, he is no longer a brother of mine;
I renounce him, I disclaim him.—For the man who
can break through the laws of hospitality, and seduce
the wife or daughter of his friend, deserves to be
branded as a pest to society.</P>
</SP>

<P>And yet, Joseph, if I was to make it

<P>Why, that's very true—No, no, you
must not make it public, people would talk.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk.—They'd say it was all my own

<P>Ah, my good friend, what's her ho∣nour,
opposed against the flattery of a handsome
young fellow.—But Joseph, she has been upbraid∣ing
me of late, that I have not made her a settlement;
and I think, in our last quarrel, she told me she
should not be very sorry if I was dead. Now I have
drafts of two deeds for your perusal, and she shall
find, if I was to die, that I have not been inattentive
to her welfare while living. By the one, she will en∣joy
eight hundred pounds a year during my life; and
by the other, the bulk of my fortune after my death.</P>

<P>Who, I alienate the affections of Lady

out that she has got an old husband.</P>

Sir Peter, I cannot expect you will credit me; but
the tenderness you expressed for me, when I am cer∣tain
you did not know I was within hearing, has pe∣netrated
so deep into my soul, that could I have
escaped the mortification of this discovery, my future
life should have convinced you of my sincere repen∣tance.
As for that smooth tongued hypocrite, who

would have seduced the wife of his too credulous

a little bronze Shakespeare that stood over the chim∣ney,
flew off through the window, at right angles,

<P>Hey day! what's the matter? Why, who
the devil have we got here? What, my little Premium.
Oh, brother, you must not hurt my little broker. But
hark'ye Joseph, what have you been borrowing mo∣ney
too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Borrowing money! no brother—We ex∣pect
my uncle Oliver here every minute, and Mr. Stan∣ley
insists upon seeing him.</P>

<P>Stanley! Why his name is Premium.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Joseph.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no! I tell you his name is Stanley.</P>

<P>It don't signify what his name is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more it don't, as you say brother, for
I suppose he goes by half a hundred names, besides
A. B. at the Coffee-houses. But old Noll must not
come and catch my little broker here neither.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my old friend Sir Oliver! what's
the matter?—In the name of wonder were there
ever two such ungracious nephews, to assault their
uncle at his first visit.</P>
</SP>

<P>On my word, sir, it was well we came

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>You find, Sir Oliver, your necessitous
character of old Stanley could not protect you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! nor Premium neither. The ne∣cessities
of the former could not extract a shilling from
that benevolent Gentleman there, and with the other
I stood a worse chance than my ancestors, and had
like to have been knocked down without being bid for.
Sir Peter, my friend, and Rowley, look upon that
elder Nephew of mine▪ you both know what I have
done for him, and how gladly I would have looked
upon half my fortune as held only in trust for him.
Judge then, of my surprise and disappointment, at
finding him destitute of truth, charity, and gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Oliver, I should be as much surpri∣sed
as you, if I did not already know him to be artful,
selfish and hypocritical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L.</HI> Teazle.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he pleads not guilty to all this,
let him call upon me to finish his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I believe we need not add more,
for if he knows himself, it will be a sufficient punish∣ment
for him that he is known by the world.</P>

will they say to me by and by.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you would undertake to justify
yourself entirely.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my little Premium was let too
much into the secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, sir; but they were family se∣crets,
and should go no further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rowley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, sir Oliver, I am sure you
cannot look upon Charles's follies with anger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor with gravity neither.—Do
you know, sir Peter, the young rogue has been selling
me his ancestors: I have bought judges and staff
officers by the foot, and maiden aunts as cheap as old
china. <STAGE>(<HI>During this speech, Charles laughs behind his
hat.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that I have made free with the fa∣mily
canvas is true, my ancestors may rise in judgment
against me, there's no denying it, but believe me
when I tell you (and upon my soul I would not say it,
if it was not so) if I don't appear mortified at the ex∣posure
of my follies, it is, because I feel at this mo∣ment
the warmest satisfaction, at seeing you my liberal
benefactor. <STAGE>(<HI>embraces him.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles, I forgive you; give me your
hand again, the little ill-looking fellow over the settee
has made your peace for you.</P>

<P>Then, sir, my gratitude to the original
is still increased.</P>

<P>Sir Oliver, here is another, with whom
I dare say Charles is no less anxious to be reconciled.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of that attachment before,
and with the Lady's leave—if I construe right, that

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, child, speak for yourself.</P>

<P>I have little more to say, than that I wish
him happy, and for any influence I might once have
had over his affections, I most willingly resign them to
one who has a better claim to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> Peter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey! what's the matter now? While he
was a rake and a profligate, you would hear of nobody
else; and now that he is likely to reform, you won't
have him. What's the meaning of all this.</P>

<P>Well,—averse to sentiments, as I am

and completion of his happiness, were he to
become, for life, and in reality, what he has only
seemed to be.</P>
