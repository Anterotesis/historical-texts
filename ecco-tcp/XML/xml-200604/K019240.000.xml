<HEAD>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Late alarming BANKRUPTCIES in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WAR, famine, and pestilence, used
formerly to fill up the number of
the general calamities of man∣kind;
but, in the present age,
one has been added, <HI>viz.</HI> Bankruptcy. The
year 1772 will ever be remembered as a
year of confusion, dismay, and distress. All
<HI>Scotland</HI> has been shaken by a kind of com∣mercial
earthquake, while, like a company
connected by an electrical wire, the people
in every corner of the country have almost
instantaneously received the same shock.</P>
<P>But it is to be feared that the evil has as
yet had very little effect, in comparison of
what it will have. The term of <HI>Martinmas</HI>
is just at hand, and that of <HI>Candlemas</HI> is not
far off: at these terms payments must and
will be demanded; and there is great rea∣son
to apprehend, that very miserable con∣sequences
will ensue.</P>
<P>There cannot therefore be a fitter subject
than that which I have chosen, for a pam∣phlet
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
of such a size as to be easily purchased
and generally read. In times of national
distress, there have been very useful hints
suggested by individuals: It is related, that
during the famous siege of <HI>Leyden,</HI> when the
inhabitants, who then defended themselves
with a most determined bravery, were me∣ditating
a surrender, because they were in
absolute want of provision, an aged citizen
of no considerable note stept forth, and told
them, that while there remained an old shoe
within the walls they should not give up,
for that he had for several days supported
himself by leather, boiled long enough
to become tender, which though not a very
palatable dish, afforded sufficient nourish∣ment
to prevent him from starving: The
experiment was made, and found to succeed,
and thus the city was enabled to hold out;
till relieved by the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>At such times too the minds of men are
more than usually disposed to listen to sober
advice, and profit by friendly instruction;
and therefore it may be hoped that these
few pages will meet with an agreeable re∣ception.</P>
<P>The public odium is at present directed
against that class of men called <HI>bankers</HI>; but
it were to be wished that a proper distinc∣tion
were made between true and false, or
real and fictitious bankers. Those of the
former kind are described in so just and
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
lively a manner by a writer in England,
that his words shall be transcribed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>Bankers are an honourable and an use∣ful
set of men in civil society, and abso∣lutely
necessary in such a trading nation
as ours: they in turn trust the Lord, the
merchant, and the mechanic, with sums
that give life, vigour, and dispatch to bu∣siness.</P>
<P>Banking is a most laudable, useful, and
advantageous refinement on business. It
collects together sums of useless cash, and
brings a large fund into circulation, which
otherwise must lie unemployed for the
time each man may not want it; or, in
other words, the Iodgments at a banker's
shop are made up of such sums as each of
his customers may not want for the pre∣sent
hour. The general fund aids every
man in turn, in proportion to his credit,
and interchangeably serves each his pur∣poses,
as their various occasions may at
different periods require: like a large re∣servoir
made up from small shallow and
useless rivulets, it supplies all its neigh∣bours
in plentiful draughts, satisfies their
common and extraordinary wants at each
man's requisition, and then turns that
which was before beneficial to no one in∣to
a wonderful and extensive advantage.</P>
<P>Bankers are generally entitled to confi∣dence
by fair character, a close attention
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
to business, and by fortunes of their own;
which not only give security, but are in∣terwoven
and blended with the credit and
various purposes of their customers and
friends.</P></Q></P>
<P>Such are real bankers; and although we
have none exactly such in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet we
have among us several merchants who an∣swer
the same purposes, in somewhat a dif∣ferent
form, and I shall hold <HI>them</HI> as real
bankers on whom we can depend. Let us
comfort ourselves that we have a few such
among us. The late convulsions of the com∣mercial
world have winnowed our traders,
and separated the wheat from the chaff: we
now know the men of substance—of know∣ledge
in business—of prudence, to confine
their views within moderate bounds—and,
let me add, of honesty. A few such men
we have, and let us esteem them accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>On the other hand, what shall be said of
those who have held themselves forth to the
world as possessed of good stocks, while, at
the same time, they were conscious that
they were worse than nothing? who, in or∣der
to carry on the cheat, and at the same
time gratify the wretched vanity of figuring
for a while in borrowed feathers, have lived
with a degree of elegance, becoming in peo∣ple
of the first rank, but ridiculous and of∣fensive
in men of low extraction: Such un∣principled
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
men having been entrusted with
the money of numbers, and with the <HI>all</HI> of
some, have villanously consumed it, and
involved their creditors in the same ruin,
though not in the same guilt, with them∣selves:
On such men let the consequences
of their dishonesty fall heavy, for me. How
inconsistent is it, that in a country where
we hang a man who steals or robs to the ex∣tent
of a trifle, we should be so tender to
<HI>fraudulent bankrupts,</HI> though they have actual∣ly
deprived their neighbours of sums enor∣mous,
and occasioned universal and deep
distress. I will, however, do what is in my
power to show that I can distinguish be∣tween
good and evil: I am not to be sooth∣ed
by the whining of their artful emissa∣ries,
to accept of a paultry composition,
and suffer <HI>them</HI> to live at large; nay, better
than I can afford to do: No;—for the sake
of justice, for the sake of deterring them,
and such corrupt, hard-hearted impostors
from again making a prey of their neigh∣bours,
my voice is, <HI>Spare not:</HI> If they will
strut, let it be in prison; if they will be
merry, let it be within those walls where
culprits dwell, as well-born, as remorseless,
and as jovial as they.</P>
<P>Yet let us not forget that there are a few
unfortunate; a few whose ruin has been oc∣casioned
through their connections with the
unworthy. For these I can make all the
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
allowance that the tenderest humanity would
wish: But let us be sure that the excuse is
true, before we dispense with the punishment.
The compassionate remedy of a <HI>Cessio-bonorum</HI>
is not granted but to such debtors as have
<HI>proved that their failure has been occasioned through
misfortune.</HI> We must have some evidence in
favour of all our bankrupts or insolvent
debtors, or by whatever other name they
chuse to pass, before they have our indul∣gence.
What that evidence should be I do
not pretend to define, I leave it to the con∣science
of every enquirer; I myself am a∣greeably
satisfied with the innocence of some:
Woe be to those villains who have thrown a
cloud of suspicion over all, and made it so
hard for the truly honest to get themselves
distinguished.</P>
<P>Although men in trade have been the
prominent and first-discovered victims in the
late broad and sudden crush; we have al∣ready
seen several men of other professions,
and some too of the lowest, throwing their
shattered personal estates into the Court of
Session, which by the new bankrupt-act
is become the perpetual light-house for tem∣pestuous
fortunes, and universal guardian
of ship-wrecked goods. Were none but
traders swallowed up in this gulf of bank∣ruptcy,
less would be my regret; but it is
a melancholy truth, that almost all will be
sufferers in a greater or lesser degrace; for, I
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
am sorry to say it, that almost all are ad∣venturers
in the article of money and cre∣dit;
owing either to extravagance, negli∣gence,
or the desire of being precipitantly
rich.</P>
<P>Of the extravagance of certain men I have
already spoken with a due severity; but I
am coming round, and shall have a word
with most of my neighbours. The mischief
is, that for some years past there has been
in Scotland an abominable spirit of levelling
all those distinctions which ages of civilized
society have, through all the gradations of
politeness introduced amongst mankind.
<Q><L>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,</L>
<L>Where wealth accumulates and men decay;</L></Q>
says Dr. <HI>Goldsmith:</HI> and I apply his elegant
lines to the decay of gentlemen. Ever since
the seat of government has been removed
from among us, we have been encreasing
in riches and barbarity, as a body in pro∣portion
as it grows fat becomes coarse. In∣terest
or amusement draw the greatest num∣ber
of our people of fashion up to London;
and those who remain are hardly to be per∣ceived,
as most of them suffer themselves
to mingle undistinguished with the general
mass. Upstarts, who have picked up for∣tunes
abroad they best know how, and pup∣pies
at home, who have obtained possession
of wealth by various means, have flashed a∣mong
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
us with all the splendor of prodigality,
lavishing away perhaps in one week as much
as supported their father's family, and might
still support a family of their nearest relations
for a whole year. Our real gentry, who
have had every mechanical business, nay, in
some instances, every servile office, perform∣ed
to them by the fathers of these men, have
been mean enough to associate with them as
equals, and foolish enough to vie with them
in expence, till drowned in debt, their lands
have fallen to the lot of these very people.
And hence it has happened that there is no
distinction of tables, as there is no distinc∣tion
of ranks; all must have an equal num∣ber
of dishes, all must have wines equally
costly, as all think themselves equally <HI>gentle∣men,</HI>
as the word is now used; so that it may
be justly said, Our feasts are noble, and our
manners plebeian. This, though an iron
age with a vengeance, in the true sense of
the expression, is, in one respect, a golden
age; for gold is the object on which all in∣clinations
are fixed, and which procures all
those advantages, which, in times of higher
spirit and nobler sentiments, no riches could
obtain: I have said that gold procures such
advantages—I would alter the phrase a lit∣tle;
for, from the very nature of things, the
genuine distinction which good birth com∣mands
cannot be the subject of commerce;
therefore the low-born enjoy it not, as it
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
can never be acquired; but, like the com∣pliant
drunken companion, who said to his
friend who had fallen upon the ground,
'I cannot help you up, but I'll lie down
beside you,' our people of birth bring
themselves to a level with the mean; so that
when the genuine honours due to birth are
destroyed, gold may then purchase every
thing that remains.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> there is a court; in <HI>Ireland</HI> the
representation of a court, which nearly an∣swers
the same purpose, and in both these
countries a distinction of ranks is preserved;
whereas in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> except at a dancing∣master's
ball, the weekly assembly for dan∣cing,
or the annual levee of his Majesty's
commissioner to the general assembly of the
kirk, and sometimes a funeral, there is not
the least room for precedency. I do not de∣sire
to have a lord-lieutenant; but I could
wish that we had some deputy at the palace
of Holyrood-house, to keep us a little in mind
of the distinction of ranks. However some
factious spirits may attempt to destroy it, our
government, limited as it is, is certainly a
monarchical government, and, until it is so∣lemnly
changed to another, we ought to keep
alive the true spirit of it, which cannot be
done without observing the distinction of
ranks. "In a monarchical state, (says an
ingenious French writer,) are two orders,
essentially separate and distinct, the nobles
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
and the plebeians: the functions of the for∣mer
are to defend it; those of the latter to
feed and to enrich it, without ever aspiring
to useless honours, which are not made for
them"</P>
<P>Nor should those of the inferior ranks of
life think themselves disparaged, or treated
with tyrannical contempt, when they are
kept apart from those whom they ought ha∣bitually
to reverence: They may be esteemed
as reputable men in their station, while they
remain in their own places with content∣ment
and quietness, and do not fret their
minds by a vain and restless contention for
equality. They may lead perhaps as com∣fortable
lives as those above them, and if
ambition stirs within them, they may feed
it with some probability, while they please
themselves with the idea, that the wealth
acquired by their industry may lay the foun∣dation
of a family, which, in a long course
of time, may be as respectable and noble as
any.</P>
<P>Let me not be branded as a niggard, or
an unsocial fellow, for what I am now going
to say. Take it as you please, I am persua∣ded,
that there is truth and justice in the
remark, that one great source of extrava∣gance
at present is the practice of extensive
and indiscriminate entertaining, which pre∣vails
amongst us. I remember the time,
when no body dined or supped at our
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
houses, but relations or particular friends
and connections, except at the houses of men
of high rank, or in public offices, who were
therefore obliged, in point of decorum, and
for the purposes of good policy, to give en∣tertainments
to large and general compa∣nies.
Indifferent people paid us a morning
visit, or drank a dish of tea at our houses in
the afternoon. Whereas now, what a wide
circle of dining and supping acquaintance
has every one of us!A man resolves on
having a dinner or a supper. He sends
about cards, and he is never at rest till he
has secured as many as will fill his table.
The slightest acquaintance suffices for giving
and receiving such invitations; and, from
their being so promiscuous, and such a con∣tinual
round of them, true hospitality no
longer exists. We ask chiefly those who will
ask us again, and we ask so many, that with
one half of them we have no connection,
and no such reciprocation of regard as
should be found between the master of a
house and his guests. On the contrary, it is
very common to find them attack each other
behind their backs, if not with rancorous
abuse, at least with bitter sarcasm, or deba∣sing
buffoonery:<Q>Non hospes ab hospite tutus.</Q></P>
<P>Such indiscriminate entertaining is the
worse, that not only do we think ourselves
obliged to have our tables more plentifully
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
covered than in most houses in London, but
we must drink hard upon almost every oc∣casion.
I will venture to say, that there is
at this time more hard-drinking in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
than in any other country in Europe, <HI>Ire∣land</HI>
not excepted. The regular artillery of
the glasses, the bumpers, the varieties of
toasting in short all the
<Q>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious drinking,</Q>
are still in full observance amongst us. It
may seem extraordinary, that this fashion
should have increased in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when it is
wearing out both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; but
so is most certainly the fact; account for it
who will.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, that the fashion
of hard drinking at every table has contri∣buted
much to roughen our manners. Our
gentlemen of the last age were much more
polite than those of the present; they had
their jovial clubs of an evening, but they
rose from dinner time enough to pay their
compliments to the ladies in the drawing-room.
The Edinburgh Miscellany, Allan
Ramsay's Tea-table Miscellany, and even
Mr. Hamilton of Bangour's Poems, which
are of a much later date, shew us, that there
was in Scotland a genteel mode of society,
which seems now to be quite given up.
Our ladies and gentlemen assembled at tea
in the afternoons, where they had the most
agreeable opportunities of improving them∣selves
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
in a genteel address and gay conver∣sation.
Colonel <HI>Forrester,</HI> who wrote <HI>The
Polite Philosopher,</HI> was formed in such society.</P>
<P>Whereas now every drawing-room is like
a nunnery, and the ladies hardly see the gen∣tlemen
but at some public place, where they
often appear when much intoxicated; a
monstrous degree of indecency, peculiar to
Scotland. Surely being accustomed to see
men drunk, (a situation into which the A∣thenians
forced their slaves, that their youth
might, by beholding its ugly effects, have
an abhorrence at the vice,) must not a little
hurt the delicacy of our ladies. Although
the gentlemen should not be what is called
<HI>mortal,</HI> their being inflamed with liquor must
make their conversation and behaviour such,
as ought to shock our ladies; and, if they
are much accustomed to it, sure I am the
enamel is off their minds, and blunted are
those finer feelings of which an elegant wo∣man
ought to be possessed.</P>
<P>As another proof of our present coarse∣ness,
I cannot but observe, that, amidst all
our extravagance, we are shamefully defici∣ent
in dress, which is the least hurtful mode
of expence, as it can do no harm either to
body or mind, while it encourages the la∣bours
of the industrious, and affords a pretty
exercise for taste and fancy.</P>
<P>Negligence, or want of attention to oeco∣nomy,
is the second general cause of bank∣ruptcy.
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
Sir <HI>Francis Osborne,</HI> who wrote a
great many years ago in <HI>England,</HI> has a pas∣sage
in his advice to his son, which, with a
few variations, might be addressed at this
day to numbers in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The substance
of it will apply; so I shall give it in his own
words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">I find the <HI>oeconomicks,</HI> though most use∣ful
to being, the least esteemed with our <HI>gal∣lants,</HI>
looked upon by some as trivial, by o∣thers
as dishonourable and unbecoming a
masculine employment; yet a total neglect
of them may be found in experience the ruin
of the greatest families in <HI>England,</HI> as their
more exact prosecution keeps up men's
estates in <HI>Italy,</HI> where the inhabitants are ce∣lebrated
as most generally wise, and there∣fore
not unfitly proposed in this for an uni∣versal
pattern, but where they border too
near the confines of penury and baseness,
most unbecoming the custom and plenty of
<HI>England</HI>; and where in this particular, (till
the sword received a commission from GOD
to devour all things good and honourable
in the land,) our noblemen equalled the
princes, and our king exceeded in hospita∣lity
all the monarchs in the known world;
and might yet have done more, had the true
elements of thrift been maintained in equal
proportion, by providing all things at the
best hand, and making use of times and sea∣sons;
in which I confess, so much as purely
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
belongs to housewifery ought, if not in dis∣cretion,
yet in reverence to custom, to be
left to women, provided they own abilities
competent for the employment, which is yet
sometimes so far contradicted by experience,
as the first leak of a husband's fortune is
found to rise in the kitchen, and such rooms
as a man of quality cannot decently visit.
Nor is there a better way patent to obviate
this falling into a hectic through a dysentery,
than by an equal balancing all weekly ac∣counts;
never noted by wisdom any more
blemish to honour, than to know how many
horses he keeps in the stable, a place that
cannot be denied to be made, by use rather
than reason, more becoming his presence
than the pastry or larder: nor is the keeping
of a regulated expence (magnified rather
than decried in the highest courts of wis∣dom,)
neglected so much out of scorn as
defect; fathers, especially rich ones, being
so far to learn themselves what is most fit
their children should be taught, as they keep
them so long in their Latin school, till the
time is lapsed most proper for reading, and
to make a perfect accountant, the most ne∣cessary
part of the mathematics, and so much
as cannot be in any commerce spared: it re∣maining
indubitable, that none, so industri∣ous
as to call himself to a weekly, or at least
an annual reckoning, did ever through his
own default spend an estate; whereas the
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
want of this first rudiment of thrift hath,
within the compass of my experience,
brought divers to a bit of bread, and demo∣lished
the houses of the most ancient gentry
in <HI>England.</HI> Now, if any desire to understand
how our more illiterate fathers came to escape
this curse, an answer lies ready, That the
greatest part of their revenues did consist in
provisions of all sorts, paid punctually at a
day, and so easily accounted for and remem∣bered.
And this abundance they enjoyed
kept them pleased, and in friendship with
their estates, wanting neither company nor
respect, through which they became less li∣quorish
after the glory and small delights of
<HI>London,</HI> and the court, towards which they
did seldom look but upon constraint, having
never tasted them in youth, as now they do,
the only time to contract an affection to any
place or thing: So as that we call <HI>the breed∣ing
of our gentry</HI> is the main reason of their
undoing, the glorious aspects the city affords
rendering the more solid pleasures of the
country contemptible and distasteful. And
thus infatuated, from the hope of a redemp∣tion
by an <HI>office</HI> or <HI>wife,</HI> they drop into an
ocean of debts, between the <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Cha∣rybdis</HI>
of a <HI>London</HI> and country house, which
for want of moderating their expence, (a
thing arithmetic is the readiest, if not the
only means to reform,) it becomes no less
terrible to look upon in relation to <HI>solitude</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
and <HI>dilapidations,</HI> than unsafe to abide in for
fear of the <HI>Sheriff.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So far <HI>Sir Francis Osborne.</HI>—And, indeed,
every man of observation and reflection must
subscribe to the truth of what he has said.
As judicious divines have remarked, that
none who are constant in the duty of pray∣er,
by which their lives are daily reviewed
by them, with at least some degree of awe,
will be very wicked; so none who are re∣gular
in keeping accounts will be very ex∣travagant.
But negligence is often produ∣ced
by extravagance. People perceive their
expence to be so great, that they are afraid
to examine into the state of their affairs,
which they know are in a ruinous condition;
but they have not courage to retrieve them,
and abandon themselves to despair. Such is
the situation of some; but the greatest num∣ber
of those whom I have in my view have
not even an apprehension or suspicion of
their danger; they repose in ignorant ne∣gligence,
while debt, like corroding rust, is
silently and surely devouring their substance:
While thus deluded with easy dreams, they
are unsolicitous with regard to their own
expence, and thoughtlessly become bound
as security for others, another unhappy cir∣cumstance,
which is now so common, that
to refuse it will irritate, and you have no
thanks for granting it. And here again <HI>Sir
Francis Osborne</HI> comes in, who cautions his
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
son in a strong and lively manner, "Such
as are betrayed by their easy nature, to be
ordinary security for their friends, leave so
little to themselves, as their liberty remains
ever after arbitrary at the will of others.
Experience having recorded many (whom
their fathers had left elbow-room enough)
that by suretyship have expired in a dun∣geon.
But if you cannot avoid this laby∣rinth,
enter no further than the thread of
your own stock will reach; the observation
of which, will, at worst, enable you to bail
yourself."</P>
<P>The desire of being precipitantly rich is
the third general cause of bankruptcy. The
old prudent maxims of frugality, by which
our fathers acquired wealth and kept it, or
by which they at least left their fortunes in
no worse situation than they found them,
are exploded; and we must all attain to
riches by means of project and adventure.
A few men of enterprize may be of use in a
country, but what must become of that
country where all are men of enterprize?
The consequence must be, that labourers, me∣chanicks,
traders, and farmers, by all strug∣gling
to get into a situation higher than that
to which they have any probable means of
attaining, must, like the frog in the fable, burst
in the attempt. Our landed gentlemen again,
observing the artificial and temporary rise
in the price of all provisions, demand exor∣bitant
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
rents, which distracted men in some
cases agree to pay; and in other cases, the
gentlemen think themselves sure of getting,
after keeping their grounds for sometime in
their own possession, and laying out large
sums of money upon their improvement, not
considering that in a few years their tenants
break, and that the calculations of profits
which they have framed upon their improve∣ments
turn out to be fallacious. They are of∣fended
if you would hint such things to them
while they are living up to the full extent of
their imaginary rents. Let us see the re∣sult
of all this. Our news-papers are filled
with sales of lands, and the rolls of the court
of session crouded with adjudications and
<HI>Cessio Bonorums,</HI> in the course of which it has
come out, that footmen, common soldiers,
and in short the lowest of mankind, have
obtained credit for hundreds, nay, thou∣sands
of pounds.</P>
<P>This unhappy subject of credit brings be∣fore
us those numerous banks and banking
companies, that most astonishing circulation
of paper currency, and that amazing multi∣tude
of cash accounts which are at this time
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to which many of the bank∣ruptcies
must be imputed. Such has been
the rage of making profits by banking, and
such the flattering expectations, that if any
failures did happen, those who issued notes
would either be so fortunate as not to be the
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
sufferers, or would be indemnified by the
interest drawn for their mere paper, that
they have given cash-accounts to many peo∣ple
who, they could not but be sensible, had
neither money nor effects equal to the ex∣tent
of the sum; and such men becoming
mutual security for each other, could not
mend the matter, but only serve to encou∣rage
the delusion, by having the appearance
of some strength without any reality.</P>
<P>In the view of what I have already sup∣posed,
that at the ensuing terms, payments
must and will be demanded all over <HI>Scotland,</HI>
with a degree of rigour which we have ne∣ver
before experienced. I would say a few
words to three different classes of readers;
those who can immediately pay; those who,
if let alone for a time, may be able to pay;
and those who must be conscious that they
neither can at present, nor have a probabi∣lity
of ever being able to pay.</P>
<P>As to those who are able to pay, let them
consider that they are called upon, not only
by justice, but by every motive of humani∣ty,
not to plead any affected excuse, or avail
themselves of any evasive delays, but on the
contrary, to exert themselves with the utmost
diligence and anxiety, to make punctual pay∣ment,
because their failing so to do may be
the occasion of breaking the credit of many,
who, if they could get exact payment of
what is due to them, might still be able to
support themselves with decency, and be
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
useful members of society. They ought to
consider that delaying on this critical and
distressing occasion, to pay back the money
which they have borrowed till their creditors
have suffered, is like delaying in the time of
a famine to pay back bread, which they have
borrowed, till their neighbours are dead:
nor is it enough that the law is open to all;
for we well know, that, notwithstanding the
present dispatch in the court of session, the
forms which justice has devised to prevent
crude decisions being passed, and hasty advan∣tages
being taken, afford an opportunity for
chicane to contrive, that we shall feel what
<HI>Shakespeare</HI> justly enumerates, as one of the
most galling evils, "the law's delay;" and a
good deal more is expended on every law-suit,
than what is repaid when costs are allowed.
Besides, they ought to recollect, that there is
no proportion between the injury done to
<HI>them</HI> by a law-suit, and that which is done by
it to men of less confirmed credit than theirs.
The blasts, that hardly shake the deep-root∣ed
tree, will tear up one that is not so advan∣tageously
situated.</P>
<P>As for those who cannot pay immediately,
but, if let alone for a time, may be able to
pay, of which I do believe there will be
found a considerable number; I would ad∣vise
them, when pushed by any of their cre∣ditors,
candidly and fairly to explain their
situation and their prospects. If they are
gentlemen of estates, who have laid out mo∣ney
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
judiciously, let them shew, that in a few
years they will be able to discharge what
they owe, and be richer than at present.
Gentlemen who have estates are however the
least to be pitied; for, if their improvements
be solid, they may always command credit;
but those who have laid out their borrowed
money in farming or in trade, in the expec∣tation
of considerable profits, and of being
allowed to pay off their debt gradually as
their profits come in, must be in a very un∣happy
situation, if a sudden demand is made
upon them. Let them then be in condition
to lay their circumstances before their credi∣tors,
both with accuracy and openness, so
as to obtain their confidence and sympathy,
while they may at the same time demonstrate
to them, that it will be their own interest to
have patience, as harsh measures would have
the effect to forfeit those leases, and frustrate
those advantageous schemes, which would in
time afford a fund for full payment, instead
of the small share which would now be
drawn. I would hope, that following the
rules, which have been now pointed out,
may be attended with very beneficial conse∣quences.</P>
<P>As for those who must be conscious, that
they neither can at present, nor have a pro∣bability
of ever being able to pay. I would
earnestly exhort them to brave it out no
longer—no longer to go on accumulating
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
distress on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hers, and guilt on themselves;
they can never have a better opportunity
for stopping than the present time, when
they have so many neighbours to keep them
in countenance. I would advise them too,
to seize the opportunity for another reason,
which may strike a knell to some of their
hearts; for next session of parliament, an act
may be passed against fraudulent, and even
prodigal bankrupts, fraught with such seve∣rity,
as I wish from my soul had been passed
several years ago. All of them will yet meet
with the greater indulgence the sooner they
discover themselves, and I promise them
they will find much more ease in their own
minds than in their present state, when they
are miserably assuming a false appearance,
and hourly in terror of detection; while
every man whom they do not know they
suspect to be a messenger, and every pac∣ket
that is delivered to them, they dread
contains a charge of horning.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without expressing my
hopes, that the late bankruptcies, however
distressing to individuals, deserving and un∣deserving,
may be of general utility, if they
have the effect which we may suppose they
will have on every rational and well-dispo∣sed
person, by restoring just notions of sub∣ordination,
frugality, and every other prin∣ciple
by which the good order of society is
maintained.</P>
