<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OTHING can more strongly second the Pleasure I feel, from
the UniversalApplause which crowns this <HI>Or∣phan</HI> Play, than this
Other which I take in presuming to shelter it under Your Name. I bear so
dear an Af∣fection to the Writings and Memory of SHAKESPEARE, that, as it is my
good Fortune to retrieve this Remnant of his Pen from Obscuri∣ty, so it is
my greatest Ambition that <PB REF="5"/> this Piece should be received into
the Protection of such a Patron: And, I hope, Future Times, when they mean to
pay <HI>Shakespeare</HI> the best Compliment, will remember to say, Mr.
DODINGTON was that Friend to his <HI>Remains,</HI> which his own SOUTHAMPTON
was to his <HI>living Merit.</HI></P>
<P>It is from the <HI>fine Discernment</HI> of our Patrons, that we
can ge∣nerally best promise Ourselves the good Opinion of the Publick.
You are not only a distinguish'd <HI>Friend</HI> of the <HI>Muses,</HI>
but most in∣timately <HI>allied</HI> to them: And from hence it is I
flatter Myself, that if You shall think fit to pro∣nounce this Piece
genuine, it will silence the Censures of those <HI>Unbe∣lievers,</HI> who
think it impossible a <PB REF="6"/> Manuscript of <HI>Shakespeare</HI>
could so long have lain dormant; and who are blindly paying Me a greater
Compliment than either They de∣sign, or I can merit, while they can∣not but
confess Themselves <HI>pleased,</HI> yet would fain insinuate that they
are <HI>imposed upon.</HI> I should esteem it some Sort of
<HI>Virtue,</HI> were I able to commit so <HI>agreeable</HI> a
<HI>Cheat.</HI></P>
<P>But pardon Me, Sir, for a Di∣gression that perverts the very
Rule of Dedications. I own, I have my Reasons for it. As, SIR, your known
Integrity, and Honour en∣gages the warmest Wishes of all good Men for your
Prosperity, so your known Distinction in polite Letters, and your
generous Encouragement of Those who pretend to them, o∣bliges us to
consider your Advancement <PB REF="7"/> as our own personal Interest, and
as a good Omen, at least, if not as the surest Means of the future
flourishing Condition of those <HI>Hu∣mane</HI> Arts amongst us, which We

nor my Inability will suffer me to enter upon that Subject. Permit me
therefore, SIR, to convert <HI>Panegyrick</HI> into a most ardent Wish,
that You would look with a Tender Eye on this <HI>dear Relick,</HI> and that
you would believe me, with the most unfeigned Zeal and Respect,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Success, which this Play has met with from the Town in the
Representation, (to say nothing of the Reception it found from those
Great Judges, to whom I have had the Honour of communica∣ting it in
Manuscript;) has almost made the Pur∣pose of a Preface unnecessary:
And therefore what I have to say, is design'd rather to wipe out a flying
Objection to two, than to labour at proving it the Production of
<HI>Shake∣speare.</HI> It has been alledg'd as incredible, that such a
Curiosity should be stifled and lost to the World for above a Century.
To This my Answer is short; that tho' it never till now made its Appearance
on the Stage, yet one of the Manuscript Copies, which I have, is of above
Sixty Years Standing, in the Hand∣writing of Mr. <HI>Downes,</HI> the famous
Old Prompter; and, as I am credibly inform'd, was early in the
Possession of the cele∣brated Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> and by Him
design'd to have been usher'd into the World. What Accident prevented This
Purpose of his, I do not pretend to know: Or thro' what hands it had
suc∣cessively pass'd before that Period of Time. There is a Tra∣dition
(which I have from the Noble Person, who supply'd me with One of my Copies)
that it was given by our Author, as a Present of Value, to a Natural Daughter
of his, for whose Sake he wrote it, in the Time of his Retirement from the
Stage. Two other Copies I have, (one of which I was glad to purchase
<PB REF="9"/> at a very good Rate,) which may not, perhaps, be quite so Old as
the Former; but One of Them is much more perfect, and has fewer Flaws and
Interruptions in the Sense.</P>
<P>Another Objection has been started, (which would carry much more
Weight with it, were it Fact;) that the Tale of this Play, being built upon a
Novel in <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> Chronology is against Us, and
<HI>Shakespeare</HI> could not be the Author. But it happens, that <HI>Don
Quixot</HI> was publish'd in the Year 1611, and <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> did
not dye till <HI>April</HI> 1616, a sufficient Interval of Time for All that
We want granted.</P>
<P>Others again, to depreciate the Affair, as they thought, have been
pleased to urge, that tho' the Play may have some Resem∣blances of
<HI>Shakespeare,</HI> yet the <HI>Colouring, Diction,</HI> and
<HI>Chara∣cters,</HI> come nearer to the Style and Manner of FLETCHER. This, I
think, is far from deserving any Answer; I submit it to the Determination
of better Judgments; tho' my Partiality for <HI>Shakespeare</HI> makes me
wish, that Every Thing which is good, or pleasing, in our Tongue, had been
owing to his Pen.</P>
<P>As to the Performance of the respective <HI>Actors</HI>
concern'd in this Play, my applauding It here would be altogether
super∣fluous. The Publick has distinguish'd and given them a Praise,
much beyond Any that can flow from my Pen. But I have some particular
Acknowledgments to make to the <HI>Managers</HI> of this Company, for which I
am glad to embrace so fair an Op∣portunity.</P>
<P>I came to Them at this Juncture as an <HI>Editor,</HI> not an
<HI>Au∣thor,</HI> and have met with so much Candour, and handsome Treatment
from Them, that I am willing to believe, the Complaint, which has so commonly
obtain'd, of their Disre∣gard and ill Behaviour to Writers, has been more
severely urg'd, than it is justly grounded. They must certainly be too
good Judges of their own Interest, not to know that a Theatre cannot always
subsist on old Stock, but that the Town requires Novelty at their Hands.
On the other Hand, they must be so far Judges of their own Art and
Profession, as to know that all the Compositions, which are offer'd them,
would never go down with Audiences of so nice and deli∣cate a Taste, as in
this Age frequent the Theatres. It would be very hard upon such a Community,
where so many Interests are concern'd, and so much Merit in their
Busi∣ness allow'd, if they had not a Priviledge of refusing some crude
Pieces, too imperfect for the Entertainment of the Pub∣lick I would not be
thought to inferr, that they have ne∣ver discourag'd what They might,
perhaps, afterwards wish they had receiv'd. They do not, I believe, set up
for such a Constant <PB REF="10"/> Infallibility. But if We do but fairly
consider out of a∣bove Four Thousand Plays extant, how small a Number
will now stand the Test: if We do but consider too, how often a raw
Performance has been extoll'd by the Partiality of private Friendship; and
what a Clamour of Injury has been rais'd from that Quarter, upon such
Performance meeting a Repulse; we may pretty easily account for the Grounds
upon which they proceeded in discountenancing some Plays, and the harsh
Things that are thrown out upon their giving a Repulse to others.</P>
<P>But I should beg Pardon for interfering in this Question, in
which I am properly neither Party, nor Judge. I am only throwing out a private
Opinion, without Interest or Prejudice, and if I am right in the Notion,
<HI>Valeat quantum valere potest.</HI></P>

<L>AS in some Region, where indulgent Skies</L>
<L>Enrich the Soil, a thousand Plants arise</L>
<L>Frequent and bold; a thousand Landskips meet</L>
<L>Our ravisht View, irregularly sweet:</L>
<L>We gaze, divided, now on These, now Those;</L>
<L>While All one beauteous Wilderness compose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such <HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI>'s Genius was:—Let
<HI>Bri∣tons</HI> boast</L>
<L>The glorious Birth, and, eager, strive who most</L>
<L>Shall celebrate his Verse; for while we raise</L>
<L>Trophies of Fame to him, ourselves we praise▪</L>
<L>Display the Talents of a <HI>British</HI> Mind,</L>
<L>Where All is great, free, open, unconfin'd.</L>
<L>Be it our Pride, to reach his daring Flight;</L>
<L>And relish Beauties, he alone could write.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Most modern Authors, fearful to aspire,</L>
<L>With Imitation cramp their genial Fire;</L>
<L>The well-schemed Plan keep strict before their Eyes,</L>
<L>Dwell on Proportions, trifling Decencies;</L>
<L>While noble Nature all neglected lies.</L>
<L>Nature, that claims Precedency of Place,</L>
<L>Perfection's Basis, and essential Grace!</L>
<L><PB REF="12"/> Nature so intimately <HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI>
knew,</L>
<L>From her first Springs his Sentiments he drew;</L>
<L>Most greatly wild they flow; and, when most wild, yet
true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While These, secure in what the Criticks teach,</L>
<L>Of servile Laws still dread the dangerous Breach;</L>
<L>His vast, unbounded, Soul disdain'd their Rule,</L>
<L>Above the Precepts of the Pedant School!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! could the Bard, revisiting our Light,</L>
<L>Receive these Honours done his Shade To-night,</L>
<L>How would he bless the Scene this Age displays,</L>
<L>Transcending his <HI>Eliza</HI>'s golden Days!</L>
<L>When great <HI>AUGUSTUS</HI> fills the <HI>British</HI>
Throne,</L>
<L>And his lov'd <HI>Consort</HI> makes the Muse her own.</L>
<L>How would he joy, to see fair Merit's Claim</L>
<L>Thus answer'd in his own reviving Fame!</L>
<L>How cry with Pride—" <HI>Oblivion I forgive</HI>;</L>

<LG>
<L>WELL, Heaven defend us from these ancient Plays,</L>
<L>These Moral Bards of good Queen <HI>Bess</HI>'s Days!</L>
<L>They write from Virtue's Laws, and think no further;</L>
<L>But draw a Rape as dreadful as a Murther.</L>
<L>You modern Wits, more deeply vers'd in Nature,</L>
<L>Can tip the wink, to tell us, you know better;</L>
<L>As who shou'd say—" 'Tis no such killing
Matter—</L>
<L>" We've heard old Stories told, and yet ne'er wonder'd,</L>
<L>" Of many a Prude, that has endur'd a Hundred:</L>
<L>" And <HI>Violante</HI> grieves, or we're mistaken,</L>
<L>" Not, because ravisht; but
because—forsaken.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Had this been written to the modern Stage,</L>
<L>Her Manners had been copy'd from the Age.</L>
<L>Then, tho' she had been once a little wrong,</L>
<L>She still had had the Grace to've held her Tongue;</L>
<L>And after all, with downcast Looks, been led</L>
<L>Like any Virgin to the Bridal Bed.</L>
<L>There, if the good Man question'd her Mis-doing,</L>
<L>She'd stop him short—" Pray, who made you so
knowing?</L>
<L>" What, doubt my Virtue!—What's your base Intention?</L>
<L>" Sir, that's a Point above your Comprehension.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="14"/>
<L>Well, Heav'n be prais'd, the Virtue of our Times</L>
<L>Secures us from our <HI>Gothick</HI> Grandsires Crimes.</L>
<L>Rapes, Magick, new Opinions, which before</L>
<L>Have fill'd our Chronicles, are now no more:</L>
<L>And this reforming Age may justly boast,</L>
<L>That dreadful Sin <HI>Polygamy</HI> is lost.</L>
<L>So far from multiplying Wives, 'tis known</L>
<L>Our Husbands find, they've Work enough with one.—</L>
<L>Then, as for Rapes, those dangerous days are past;</L>
<L>Our Dapper Sparks are seldom in such haste.</L>

<L>In <HI>SHAKESPEARE</HI>'s Age the <HI>English</HI> Youth
inspir'd,</L>
<L>Lov'd, as they fought, by him and Beauty fir'd.</L>

<L>O <HI>Julio,</HI> let me whisper</L>

<L>My Heart beats thick with Fears, lest the gay Scene,</L>
<L>The Splendors of a Court, should from thy Breast</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="27"/> Banish my Image, kill my Int'rest in
thee,</L>
<L>And I be left, the Scoff of Maids, to drop</L>
<L>A Widow's Tear for thy departed Faith.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<L>O let Assurance, strong as Words can bind,</L>
<L>Tell thy pleas'd Soul, I will be wond'rous faithful;</L>
<L>True, as the Sun is to his Race of Light,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<L>Enough; I'm satisfied: and will remain</L>
<L>Yours, with a firm and untir'd Constancy.</L>
<L>Make not your Absence long: Old Men are wav'ring;</L>
<L>And sway'd by Int'rest more than Promise giv'n.</L>
<L>Should some fresh Offer start, when you're away,</L>

Re∣quiring, 'till, as I have formerly said, <HI>Camillo</HI> make known to

<SPEAKER>D. Bern.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Father is as unsettled, as he is way∣ward, in his
Disposition. If I thought young <HI>Julio</HI>'s Temper were not mended by
the Mettal of his Mo∣ther, I should be something crazy in giving my
Con∣sent to this Match: And, to tell you true, if my Eyes might be the
Directors to your Mind, I could in this Town look upon Twenty Men of more
delicate Choice. I speak not This altogether to unbend your Affections to
him: But the Meaning of what I say is, that you set such Price upon
yourself to him, as Many, and much his Betters, would buy you at; (and reckon
those Vir∣tues in you at the rate of their Scarcity;) to which if he come not
up, you remain for a better Mart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Obedience, Sir, is chain'd to your Ad∣vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Bern.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis well said, and wisely. I fear, your Lover is a
little Folly-tainted; which, shortly after it proves so, you will
repent.</P>
</SP>

<P>Sir, I confess, I approve him of all the Men I know; but
that Approbation is nothing, 'till season'd by your Consent.</P>

<P>We shall hear soon what his Father will do, and so
proceed accordingly. I have no great Heart to the Business, neither will I
with any Violence oppose <PB N="10" REF="29"/> it: But leave it to that Power
which rules in these Conjunctions, and there's an End. Come; haste We

remember too, those Oaths could not prevail; th' unpractis'd Maid trembled to
meet my Love: By Force alone I <PB N="14" REF="33"/> snatch'd th' imperfect

<P>Hold, let me be severe to my Self, but not

drove me from her. True, she did not consent; as true, she did
resist; but still in Silence all.—'Twas but the Coyness of a
mo∣dest Bride, not the Resentment of a ravisht Maid. And is the Man yet
born, who would not risque the Guilt, to meet the Joy?—The Guilt!
that's true—but then the Danger; the Tears, the Clamours of the ruin'd
Maid, pursuing me to Court. That, that, I fear will (as it already does my
Conscience) some∣thing shatter my Honour. What's to be done? But now I
have no Choice. Fair <HI>Leonora</HI> reigns confest the Tyrant Queen of my

can∣not possibly see a Duke's younger Son without falling desperately
in Love with him. Now, you know, Neighbour, when Greatness rides Post after
a Man of my Years, 'tis both Prudence, and good Breeding, to let one's self
be overtaken by it. And who can help all This? I profess, it was not my
seeking, Neigh∣bour.</P>
