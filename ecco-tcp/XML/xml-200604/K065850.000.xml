<HEAD>CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
DESIGN
OF THE
SIXTH Book of the AENEID.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE Allegorical Interpretation which
the Bishop of Glocester has given of
the Sixth Book of the Aeneid, seems
to have been very favourably received by the
Public. Many writers, both at home and
abroad, have mentioned it with approbation,
or at least with esteem; and I have more than
once heard it alledged, in the conversation of
scholars, as an ingenious improvement on the
plain and obvious sense of Virgil. As such,
it is not undeserving of the notice of a candid
critic; nor can the enquiry be void of enter∣tainment,
whilst Virgil is our constant theme.
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Whatever may be the fortune of the chace,
we are sure it will lead us through pleasant
prospects and a fine country.</P>
<P>That I may escape the imputation as well
as the danger of misrepresenting his Lordship's
Hypothesis, I shall expose it in his own words.
<Q REND="inline">The purpose of this Discourse is to shew that
Aeneas's adventure to the INFERNAL SHADES,
is no other than a figurative description of
his INITIATION INTO THE MYSTERIES; and
particularly a very exact one of the SPECTA∣CLES
of the ELEUSINIAN<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Warburton's Dissertation, &amp;c. in the third volume of Mr. Warton's Virgil. I shall quote indifferently that Dissertation or the Divine Legation itself.</NOTE>.</Q> This gene∣ral
notion is supported with singular ingenuity,
dressed up with an easy yet pompous display of
Learning, and delivered in a style much fitter
for the Hierophant of Eleusis, than for a Mo∣dern
Critic, who is observing a remote object
through the medium of a glimmering and
doubtful light: <Q>Ibant obscuri, solâ sub nocte, per umbram.</Q></P>
<P>His Lordship naturally enough pursues two
different methods which unite, as he apprehends,
in the same conclusion. From general prin∣ciples
peculiar to himself, he infers the pro∣priety
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
and even necessity of such a Description
of the Mysteries; and from a comparison of
particular circumstances he labours to prove
that Virgil has actually introduced it into the
Aeneid. Each of these methods shall be consi∣dered
separately.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>As the learned Prelate's Opinions branch
themselves out into luxuriant Systems, it is not
easy to resume them in a few words. I shall,
however, attempt to give a short idea of those
general principles, which occupy, I know not
how, so great a share of the <HI>Divine Legation
of Moses demonstrated.</HI></P>
<P><Q TYPE="inline">The whole System of Paganism, of which
the Mysteries were an essential part, was
instituted by the Antient Lawgivers for the
support and benefit of Society. The my∣steries
themselves were a School of Morality
and Religion, in which the vanity of Po∣lytheism<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">At least of the vulgar polytheism, by revealing that the <HI>Dii Majorum Gentium</HI> had been mere mortals.</NOTE>, and the Unity of the First
Cause, were revealed to the Initiated. Virgil,
who intended his immortal Poem for a Re∣public
in action, as those of Plato and
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Tully were in precept, could not avoid dis∣playing
this first and noblest art of Govern∣ment.
His perfect Law-giver must be
initiated, as the antient Founders of States
had been before him; and as Augustus him∣self
was many ages afterwards.</Q></P>
<P>What a crowd of natural reflections must
occur to an unblassed mind! Was the civil ma∣gistrate
the mover of the whole machine; the
sole contriver, or at least the sole support of
Religion? Were antient laws ALWAYS designed
for the benefit of the people, and NEVER for the
private interest of the Lawgiver? Could the
first fathers of rude societies instruct their new∣made
subjects in philosophy as well as in agri∣culture?
Did they all agree, in Britain as in
Egypt, in Persia as in Greece, to found these
secret schools on the same common principle;
which subsisted near eighteen hundred years at
Eleusis <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">From their institution, 1399 years before the Christian aera (Marm. Arundel. Ep. 14), till their suppression, towards the end of the fourth century.</NOTE> in its primaeval purity? Can these
things be? Yes, replies the learned prelate;
they are: <Q REND="inline">Egypt was the mysterious mother
of Religion and Policy; and the arts of
Egypt were diffused with her colonies over
the antient World. Inachus carried the My∣steries
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
into Greece, Zoroaster into Persia<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Though I hate to be positive, yet I would almost venture to affirm, that Zorcaster's connection with Egypt is no where to be found, except in the <HI>D. L.</HI></NOTE>
&amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>—I retire from so wide a field,
in which it would be easy for me to lose both
myself and my adversary. THE ANTIENT
WORLD, EIGHTEEN CENTURIES, and FOUR HUN∣DRED
AUTHORS GENUINE AND APOCRYPHAL<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>See a list of four hundred Authors, quoted, &amp;c. in the <HI>D. L.</HI> from St. Austin and Aristotle, down to Scarron and Rabelais. Amongst these authors we may observe Sanchoniatho, Orpheus, Zaleucus, Charondas, the Oracles of Prophry, and the History of Jeffrey of Monmouth.</P>
<P>The bishop has entered the lists with the tremendous Bentley, who treated the laws of Zaleucus and Charondas as the forgeries of a sophist. A whole section of mistakes or misrepresentations is devoted to this controversy: But Bentley is no more, and W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n may sleep in peace.</P>
<P>I shall, however, disturb his repose, by asking him on what authority he supposes that the old language of the Twelve Tables was altered for the conveniency of suc∣ceeding ages. The fragments of those laws, collected by Lipsius, Sylburgius, &amp;c. bear the stamp of the most remote antiquity. Lipsius himself (tom. i. p. 206.) was highly de∣lighted with those <HI>Antiquissima Verba:</HI> But what is much more decisive, Horace (L. II. Ep. i. Ver. 23), Seneca (Epistol. 114), and Aulus Gellius (XX. 1), rank those laws amongst the oldest remains of the Latin tongue. Their obsolete language was admired by the lawyers, ridiculed by the wits, and pleaded by the friends of antiquity as an ex∣cuse for the frequent obscurities of that code.</P>
<P>Had an adversary to the <HI>Divine Legation</HI> been guilty of this mistake, I am afraid it would have been styled an <HI>egregious blunder.</HI></P></NOTE>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
would, under tolerable management, furnish
some volumes of controversy; and since I have
perused the two thousand and fourteen pages
of the unfinished <HI>Legation,</HI> I have less inclina∣tion
than ever to spin out volumes of laborious
trifles.</P>
<P>I shall, however, venture to point out a fact,
not very agreeable to the favourite notion, that
Paganism was entirely the Religion of the ma∣gistrate.
The Oracles were not less antient, nor
less venerable than the Mysteries. Every diffi∣culty,
religious or civil, was submitted to the
decision of those infallible tribunals. During
several ages no war could be undertaken, no
colony founded, without the sanction of the
Delphic Oracle; the first and most celebrated
amongst several hundred others<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See Vandale de Oraculis, p. 559. That valuable book contains whatever can now be known of Oracles. I have borrowed his facts; and could with great ease have borrowed his quotations.</NOTE>. Here
then we might expect to perceive the directing
hand of the magistrate. Yet when we study
their history with attention, instead of the Alli∣ance
between Church and State, we can only
discover the antient Alliance between the
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Avarice of the Priest and the Credulity of the
People.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am very apt to consi∣der
the Mysteries in the same light as the
Oracles. An intimate connection subsisted be∣tween
them<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><P>The prophet Alexander, whose arts are so admirably laid open by Lucian, instituted his Oracle and his Mysteries as regular parts of the same plan. It is here we may say, with the learned Catholic, <Q REND="inline">Les nouveaux Saints me font douter des Anciens.</Q></P></NOTE>: Both were preceded and ac∣companied
with fasts, sacrifices, and lustra∣tions;
with mystic sights and preternatural
sounds: But the most essential preparation for
the ASPIRANT, was a general confession of his
past life, which was exacted of him by the Priest.
In return for this implicit confidence, the Hiero∣phant
conferred on the Initiated a sacred cha∣racter;
and promised them a peculiar place of
happiness in the Elysian fields, whilst the souls
of the Profane (however virtuous they had
been) were wallowing in the mire<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">See Diogen. Laert. vi. 39. &amp; Menag. ad loc.</NOTE>. Nor
did the Priests of the Mysteries neglect to re∣commend
to the brethren a spirit of friendship,
and the love of virtue; so pleasing even to the
most corrupt minds, and so requisite to render
any society respectable in its own eyes. Of all
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
these religious societies, that of Eleusis was the
most illustrious. From being peculiar to the
inhabitants of Attica, it became at last common
to the whole Pagan world. Indeed, I should
suspect that it was much indebted to the genius
of the Athenian writers, who bestowed fame and
dignity on whatever had the least connection
with their country; nor am I surprised that
Cicero and Atticus, who were both initiated,
should express themselves with enthusiasm, when
they speak of the sacred rites of their beloved
Athens.</P>
<P>But our curiosity is yet unsatisfied; we would
press forwards into the sanctuary; and are eager
to learn, WHAT was the SECRET which was reveal∣ed
to the Initiated, and to them alone. Many of
the Profane, possessed of leisure and ingenuity,
haved tried to guess, what has been so religiously
concealed. The SECRET of each is curious and
philosophical; for as soon as we attempt this
Enquiry, the honour of the Mysteries becomes
our own<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot"><P>I shall sum them up in a curious passage of the cele∣brated Freret. <Q REND="inline">Les sectes philosophiques cherchoient à diviner le Dogme caché sous le voile des Ceremonies; &amp; tachoient de le ramener chacune à leur doctrine. Dans l'hypothése des Epicuriens, adoptée de nos jours par M. M.

Les Stoiciens &amp; les Hylo∣zoistes supposoient qu'on enseignoit aux Initiés, qu'il n'y avoit d'autres Dieux que les élémens &amp; les parties de l'uni∣vers materiel. Enfin suivant les nouveaux Platoniciens, ces Symboles servoient à couvrir les dogmes d'une Théo∣logie &amp; d'une Philosophie sublimes, enseignées autrefois par les Egyptiens &amp; les Chaldéens.</Q> Mr. Freret inclines, though with great diffidence, to the last opinion. <HI>Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, &amp;c. tom.</HI> xxi. <HI>p.</HI> 12. <HI>Hist.</HI></P></NOTE>. I too could frame an hypothesis,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
as plausible perhaps, and as uncertain as any of
theirs, did I not feel myself checked by the
apprehension of discovering what never exist∣ed<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Je ne suis pas si convaincu de nôtre ignorance par les choses qui sont, &amp; dont la raison nous est inconnuë; que par celles qui ne sont point &amp; dont nous trouvons la raison. <HI>Oeuvres de Fontenelle, tom.</HI> xi. <HI>p.</HI> 229.</NOTE>. I admire the discretion of the Initi∣ated;
but the best security for discretion is,
the vanity of concealing that we have nothing
to reveal.</P>
<P>The examples of great men, when they
cannot serve as models, may serve as warnings
to us. I should be very sorry to have discovered,
that an ATHEISTICAL HISTORY<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Fragment of Sanchoniatho's Phoenician History.</HI> Eu∣sebius and bishop Cumberland have already observed, that the formation of the world is there attributed to the blind powers of Matter, without the least mention of an Intelli∣gent Cause.</NOTE> was used in

Eccl. p. 692), and by Dr. Jortin (Remarks on Ecclesiastical Hist. vol. 1. p. 199). The first of these, the <HI>immortal Cudworth,</HI> is often celebrated by the Bishop of Gloucester; Leclerc's literary character is established; and with respect to Dr. Jortin, I will venture to call him a learned and moderate Critic. The few who may not chuse to confess, that their objections are unanswerable, will allow that they deserved to be answered.</NOTE> was sung, for the edification of the
devout Athenians, which was most probably A
MODERN FORGERY of some Jewish or Christian
Impostor. Had I delivered THESE TWO DIS∣COVERIES,
with an air of Confidence and Tri∣umph,
I should be still more mortified.</P>
<P>After all, as I am not apt to give the name
of Demonstration to what is mere conjecture,
his Lordship may take advantage of my Scep∣ticism,
and still affirm, that his favourite Myste∣ries
were Schools of Theism, instituted by the
Lawgiver. Yet unless Aeneas is the Lawgiver
of Virgil's Republic, he has no more business
with the Mysteries of Athens, than with the
laws of Sparta. We will, therefore, reflect a mo∣ment
on the true nature and plan of the Aeneid.</P>
<P>An Epic Fable must be important as well as
interesting: Great actions, great virtues, and
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
great distresses, are the peculiar province of
Heroic Poetry. This rule seems to have been
dictated by nature and experience, and is very
different from those chains in which Genius has
been bound by artificial Criticism. The im∣portance
I speak of, is not indeed always de∣pendant
on the rank or names of the Personages.
Columbus, exploring a new world with three
sloops and ninety sailors, is a Hero worthy of
the Epic Muse; yet our imagination would be
much more strongly affected by the image of a
virtuous Prince saved from the ruins of his
country, and conducting his faithful followers
through unknown seas and through hostile lands.
Such is the Hero of the Aeneid. But his pecu∣liar
situation suggested other beauties to the
Poet, who had an opportunity of adorning his
subject with whatever was most pleasing in Gre∣cian
fable, or most illustrious in Roman his∣tory.
Aeneas had fought under the walls of
Ilium; and conducted to the Banks of the
Tyber a Colony from which Rome claimed her
origin.</P>
<P>The character of the Hero is expressed by one
of his friends in a few words; and, tho' drawn
by a friend, does not seem to be flattered: <Q><L>Rex erat Aeneas nobis; quo justior alter,</L>
<L>Nec pietate fecit, nec bello major &amp; armis<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, i. 548.</NOTE>.</L></Q><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
These three virtues, of JUSTICE, of PIETY, and
of VALOR, are finely supported throughout the
Poem<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">M. de Voltaire condemns the latter part of the Aeneid, as far inferior in fire and spirit to the former. As quoted in the <HI>Legation,</HI> he thinks that Virgil
<Q>—s'épuise avec Didon &amp; <HI>rate</HI> à la fin Lavinie;</Q> a pretty odd quotation for a Bishop; but I most sincerely hope, that neither his Lordship nor Mrs. W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n are ac∣quainted with the true meaning of the word <HI>Rater.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="1">1. I shall here mention one instance of the
Hero's justice, which has been less noticed than
its singularity seems to deserve.</P>
<P>After Evander had entertained his Guests,
with a sublime simplicity, he lamented, that his
age and want of power made him a very useless
Ally. However, he points out auxiliaries and
a cause worthy of a Hero. The Etruscans, tired
out with the repeated tyrannies of Mezentius,
had driven that monarch from his throne, and
reduced him to implore the protection of Tur∣nus.
Unsatisfied with freedom, the Etruscans
called loudly for revenge; and, in the Poet's
opinion, revenge was justice. <Q><L>Ergo omnis <HI>furiis</HI> surrexit Etruria <HI>justis</HI>:</L>
<L><HI>Regem</HI> ad <HI>supplicum</HI> praesenti Marte repos∣cunt<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, viii. 495.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
Aeneas, with the approbation of Gods and men,
accepts the command of these brave rebels, and
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
punishes the Tyrant with the death he so well
deserved. The conduct of Aeneas and the
Etruscans may, in point of justice, seem doubt∣ful
to many; the sentiments of the Poet cannot
appear equivocal to any one. Milton himself,
I mean the Milton of the Commonwealth, could
not have asserted with more energy the daring
pretensions of the people, to punish as well as
to resist a Tyrant. Such opinions, published by
a writer, whom we are taught to consider as the
creature of Augustus, have a right to surprize
us; yet they are strongly expressive of the tem∣per
of the times; the Republic was subverted,
but the minds of the Romans were still Re∣publican.</P>
<P N="2">2. Aeneas's piety has been more generally
confessed than admired. St. Evremond laughs
at it, as unsuitable to his own temper. The
Bishop of Gloucester defends it, as agreeable to
his own System of the Lawgiver's Religion.
The French wit was too superficial, the English
scholar too profound, to attend to the plain nar∣ration
of the Poet, and the peculiar circum∣stances
of antient Heroes. WE believe from
faith and reason: THEY believed from the re∣port
of their senses. Aeneas had seen the Gre∣cian
Divinities overturning the foundations of
fated Troy. He was personally acquainted with
his mother Venus, and with his persecutor Juno.
Mercury, who commanded him to leave Car∣thage,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
was as present to his eyes as Dido, who
strove to detain him. Such a knowledge of
Religion, founded on sense and experience, must
insinuate itself into every instant of our lives,
and determine every action. All this is, in∣deed,
fiction; but it is fiction in which we chuse
to acquiesce, and which we justly consider as the
charm of Poetry. If we allow, that Aeneas
lived in an intimate commerce with superior Be∣ings,
we must likewise allow, his love or his
fear, his confidence or his gratitude, towards
those Beings, to display themselves on every
proper occasion. Far from thinking Aeneas
too pious, I am sometimes surprized at his
want of faith. Forgetful of the Fates, which
had so often and so clearly pointed out the de∣stined
shores of Latium, he deliberates, whether
he shall not sit down quietly in the fields of Si∣cily.
An apparition of his father is necessary
to divert him from this impious and ungene∣rous
design.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Hero's valor will not bear the rude
breath of suspicion; yet has the courage of
Aeneas suffered from an unguarded expression
of the Poet:
<Q><L>Extemplo Aeneae solvuntur frigore membra</L>
<L>Ingemit<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Aeneid. i. 96.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
On every other occasion, the Trojan chief is
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
daring without rashness, and prudent without
timidity. In that dreadful night, when Troy
was delivered up to her hostile Gods, he per∣formed
every duty of a Soldier, a Patriot, and
a Son.
<Q><L>Moriamur &amp; in media arma ruamus.</L>
<L>Una salus victis, nullam sperare salutem<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, ii. 353.</NOTE>.</L></Q><Q><L>Iliaci cineres, &amp; flamma extrema meorum,</L>

<L>Vitavisse vices Danaûm; &amp;, si fata fuissent</L>
<L>Ut caderem, meruisse manu<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Idem, ii. 431.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
To quote other proofs of the same nature, would
be to copy the six last books of the Aeneid. I
cannot, however, forbear mentioning the calm
and superior intrepidity of the Hero, when,
after the perfidy of the Rutuli, and his wound,
he rushed again to the field, and restored Vic∣tory
by his presence alone.
<Q><L>Ipse neque aversos dignatur sternere morti;</L>
<L>Nec pede congressos aequo, nec tela ferentes</L>
<L>Insequitur: solum densa in caligine Turnum</L>
<L>Vestigat lustrans, solum in certamina poscit<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Idem, xii. 464.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
At length, indignant that his victim has escap∣ed
him, his contempt gives way to fury:
<Q><L>Jam tandem invadit medios, &amp; Marte secundo</L>
<L>Terribilis, saevam nullo discrimine caedem</L>
<L>Suscitat, irarumque omnes effundit habenas<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Idem, xii. 497.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
The Heroic character of Aeneas has been un∣derstood
and admired by every attentive reader.
But to discover the LAWGIVER in Aeneas, and
A SYSTEM OF POLITICS in the Aeneid, required
the CRITICAL TELESCOPE <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Others are furnished by Criticism with a <HI>Telescope.</HI> They see with great clearness whatever is too remote to be discovered by the rest of mankind; but are totally blind to all that lies immediately before them.

<P>There is another public occurrence, at least
as much in the character of a LAWGIVER, as
either voyaging or fighting; I mean, GIVING
LAWS. Except in a single line<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, iii. 137.</NOTE>, Aeneas
never appears in that occupation. In Sicily,
he compliments Acestes with the honour of
giving laws to the colony, which he himself
had founded.
<Q><L>Interea Aeneas urbem designat aratro,</L>

In the solemn treaty, which is to fix the fate of
his posterity, he disclaims any design of inno∣vating
the laws of Latium. On the contrary,
he only demands a hospitable seat for his Gods
and his Trojans; and professes to leave the
whole authority to king Latinus.

<P><Q REND="inline">But after all, is not the fable of the Aeneid
the establishment of an empire?</Q> Yes, in
one sense, I grant it is. Aeneas had many ex∣ternal
difficulties to struggle with. When the
Latins were defeated, Turnus slain, and Juno
appeased, these difficulties were removed. The
Hero's labor was over, the Lawgiver's com∣menced
from that moment; and, as if Virgil
had a design against the Bishop's System, at
that very moment the Aeneid ends. Virgil, who
corrected with judgment, and felt with enthu∣siasm,
thought perhaps, that the sober arts of
peace could never interest a reader, whose mind
had been so long agitated with scenes of dis∣tress
and slaughter. He might perhaps say,
like the Sylla of Montesquieu, <Q REND="inline">J'aime à rem∣porter

INSTITUTE, the Example of Fenelon, his elegant
Imitator, may give us some notion of the man∣ner
in which he would have proceeded. The
preceptor of the Duke of Burgundy professedly
designed to educate a prince for the happiness of
the people. Every incident in his pleasing Ro∣mance
is subservient to that great end. The
Goddess of Wisdom, in a human shape, con∣ducts
her pupil thro' a varied series of instructive
adventures; and every adventure is a lesson or a
warning for Telemachus. The pride of Sesostris,
the tyranny of Pygmalion, the perfidy of Adras∣tus,
and the imprudence of Idomeneus, are dis∣played
in their true light. The innocence of the
inhabitants of Boetica, the commerce of Tyre,
and the wise laws of Crete and Salentum, in∣structed
the prince of the various means by which
a people may be made happy. From the Tele∣machus
of Fenelon, I could pass with pleasure
to the Cyropoedia of Xenophon. But I should be
led too far from my subject, were I to attempt
to lay open the true nature and design of that
philosophical history. We must return from Fe∣nelon
and Xenophon to the Bishop of Glocester.</P>
<P>His Lordship props the legislative character of
Aeneas with an additional support: <Q REND="inline">Augustus,
who was shadowed in the person of Aeneas, was
initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">D. L. p. 228.</NOTE>.
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<HI>Ergo, &amp;c.</HI></Q> This doctrine of types and sha∣dows,
though true in general, has on this, as
well as on graver occasions, produced a great
abuse of reason, or at least of reasoning. To
confine myself to Virgil, I shall only say, that he
was too judicious to compliment the Emperor,
at the expence of good sense and probability.
Every age has its manners; and the poet must
suit his Hero to the Age, and not the Age to his
Hero. It is easy to give instances of this truth.
Marc Antony, when defeated and besieged in
Alexandria, challenged his competitor to decide
their quarrel by a single combat. This was re∣jected
by Augustus with contempt and derision,
as the last effort of a desperate man<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, in Vit. M. Anton. tom. i. 950. Edit. Wechel.</NOTE>; and the
world applauded the prudence of Augustus, who
preferred the part of a General to that of a Gla∣diator.
The temper and good sense of Virgil
must have made him view things in the same
light; yet, when Virgil introduces Aeneas in
similar circumstances, he gives him a quite dif∣ferent
conduct. The Hero wishes to spare the
innocent people, provokes Turnus to a single
combat, and, even after the perfidy and last de∣feat
of the Rutuli, is still ready to risk his per∣son
and victory, against the unhappy life and
desperate fortunes of his Rival. The laws of
Honor are different in different Ages; and a be∣haviour
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
which in Augustus was decent, would
have covered Aeneas with infamy.</P>
<P>We may apply this observation to the very
case of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Augustus was
initiated into them, at a time when Eleusis was
become the COMMON TEMPLE OF THE UNI∣VERSE.
The Trojan Hero could not with the
smallest propriety set him that example; as the
Trojan Hero lived in an age when those rites
were confined to the natives of Greece, and even
of Attica<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, in Vit. Thesei, tom. i. p. 16. Herodot. viii. 65. Cicero de Nat. Deor. i. 42. The gradation of Athe∣nians, Greeks, and mankind at large, may be traced in these passages.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have now wandered through the scientific
maze in which the Bishop of Gloucester has
concealed his first and general argument. It
appears (when resumed) to amount to this irre∣fragable
demonstration, <Q REND="inline">THAT IF THE MYSTE∣RIES
WERE INSTITUTED BY LEGISLATORS
(which they probably were not) AENEAS (who
was no Legislator) MUST OF COURSE BE INI∣TIATED
INTO THEM BY THE POET.</Q></P>
<P>And here I shall mention a collateral reason
assigned by his Lordship, which might engage
Virgil to introduce a description of the Myste∣ries:
the PRACTICE OF OTHER POETS. This
proof is so exceedingly brittle, that I fear to
handle it; and shall report it faithfully in the
words of our ingenious Critic<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. I. p. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/><Q REND="inline">Had the old Poem under the name of Or∣pheus
been now extant, it would perhaps have
shewn us, that no more was meant than Or∣pheus's
Initiation; and that the hint of this
Sixth Book was taken from thence.</Q></P>
<P>As nothing now remains of that old Poem,
except the title, it is not altogether so easy to
guess what it would or would not have shewn us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">But farther, it was customary for the poets
of the Augustan age to exercise themselves on
the subject of the Mysteries, as appears from
Cicero, who desires Atticus, then at Athens,
and initiated, to send to Chilius, a poet of
eminence, an account of the Eleusinian My∣steries;
in order, as it would seem, to insert
them into some poem he was then writing.</Q></P>
<P>The Eleusinian Mysteries are not mentioned
in the original Passage. Cicero using the obscure
brevity of familiar Letters, desires that Atticus
would send their friend Chilius, ΕΥΜΟΛΠΙΔΩΝ ΠΑΤΡΙΑ<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Chilius te rogat, &amp; ego ejus rogatû; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Cicero ad Attic.</HI> i. 9.</NOTE>, which may signify twenty different
things, relative either to the worship of Ceres in
particular, or to the Athenian Institutions in ge∣neral;
but which can hardly be applied to the
Eleusinian Mysteries<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>As the B. of G. alledges the authority of Victorius, I shall shelter myself under the names and reasons of Groevius and the Abbé Mongault, and even transcribe the words of the former. <Q REND="inline">Non est ut hic intelligantur ritus illi secre∣tories, qui tantùm Mystis noti erant, &amp; sine Capitis periculo vulgari non poterant, sed illa sacra &amp; ceremoniae, quibus in Eleusiniis celebrandis utebantur in omnium oculis Eumolpidae; quasque Poetae &amp; pris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i Scriptores alii comme∣morant passim: aut fortè per Eumolpidas intelligit tectè ipsos Athenienses: ut petierit Chilius, Atheniensium leges &amp; disciplinam sibi describi &amp; mitti.</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/><Q REND="inline">Thus it appears that both the antient and
modern poets afforded Virgil a pattern for
this famous episode.</Q></P>
<P>How does this appear? From an old Poem,
of whose contents the Critic is totally ignorant,
and from an obscure passage, the meaning of
which he has most probably mistaken.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Instead of conjecturing what Virgil might or
ought to do, it would seem far more natural to
examine what he has done. The Bishop of Glou∣cester
attempts to prove, that the Descent to Hell
is properly an Initiation; since the Sixth Book
of the Aeneid really contains the secret Doctrine
as well as the Ceremonies of the Eleusinian
Mysteries.</P>
<P>What was this SECRET DOCTRINE? As I pro∣fess
my ignorance, we must consult the Oracle.
<Q REND="inline">The secret Doctrine of the Mysteries revealed
to the Initiated, that JUPITER ... AND THE
WHOLE RABBLE OF LICENTIOUS DEITIES,

thing like this laid open in the Sixth Book of
Virgil? Not the remotest hint of it can be dis∣covered
throughout the whole Book; and thus,
to use his Lordship's own words, SOMETHING
(I had almost written EVERY THING) is still
wanting "to complete the IDENTIFICATION<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this disappointment, which is
cautiously concealed from the reader, the learned
Bishop still courses round the Elysian Fields in
quest of a Secret. Once he is so lucky as to find
Aeneas talking with the Poet Musaeus, whom
tradition has reckoned among the founders of
the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Critic listens to
their conversation; but, alas! Aeneas is only
enquiring, in what part of the garden he may
find his Father's shade; to which Musaeus returns
a very polite answer. Anchises himself is our last
hope. As that venerable shade explains to his son
some mysterious doctrines, concerning the Uni∣versal
Mind and the Transmigration of Souls, his
Lordship is pleased to assure us, that these are
THE HIDDEN DOCTRINES OF PERFECTION re∣vealed
only to the Initiated. Let us for a mo∣ment
lay aside Hypothesis, and read Virgil.</P>
<P>It is observable, that the three great Poets of
Rome were all addicted to the Epicurean philo∣sophy;
a System, however, the least suited to a
Poet; since it banishes all the genial and active
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
Powers of Nature, to substitute in their room a
dreary void, blind atoms, and indolent Gods. A
Description of the Infernal Shades was incompa∣tible
with the ideas of a Philosopher, whose dis∣ciples
boasted, that he had rescued the captive
World from the Tyranny of Religion, and the
Fear of a Future State. These ideas, Virgil was
obliged to reject: But he does still more; he
abandons not only the CHANCE of Epicurus, but
even these Gods, whom he so nobly employs in
the rest of his Poem, that he may offer to the
Reader's imagination a far more specious and
splendid sett of Ideas.
<Q><L>Principio coelum, ac terras, camposque liquentes,</L>
<L>Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra</L>
<L>Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus</L>
<L>Mens agitat molem, &amp; magno se corpore miscet<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, vi. 724.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
The more we examine these lines, the more we
shall feel the sublime Poetry of them. But they
have likewise an air of Philosophy and even of
Religion, which goes off on a nearer approach.
The mind which is INFUSED<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Quomodo porro Deus iste si nihil esset nisi animus, aut infixus aut <HI>infusus</HI> esset in mundo. <HI>Cicero de Naturâ Deor.</HI> l. i. c. 11.</NOTE> into the several
parts of Matter, and which MINGLES ITSELF
with the mighty mass, scarce retains any Property
of a Spiritual Substance; and bears too near an
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
affinity to the Principles, which the impious Spi∣noza
revived rather than invented.</P>
<P>I am not insensible, that we should be slow to
suspect, and still slower to condemn. The po∣verty
of human language, and the obscurity of
human ideas, makes it difficult to speak worthily
of THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE. Our most reli∣gious
Poets, in striving to express the presence
and energy of the Deity, in every part of the Uni∣verse,
deviate unwarily into images, which are
scarcely distinguished from Materialism. Thus
our Ethic Poet:
<Q><L>All are but parts of one stupendous Whole,</L>
<L>Whose body Nature is, and God the soul<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Pope's Essay on Man, Epistle I. ver. 267.</NOTE>;</L></Q>
and several passages of Thomson require a like
favourable construction. But these writers de∣serve
that favour, by the sublime manner in which
they celebrate the great Father of the Universe,
and by those effusions of love and gratitude,
which are inconsistent with the Materialist's Sy∣stem.
Virgil has no such claim to our indul∣gence.
THE MIND of the UNIVERSE is rather a
Metaphysical than a Theological Being. His
intellectual qualities are faintly distinguished
from the Powers of Matter, and his moral At∣tributes,
the source of all religious worship, form
no part of Virgil's creed.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
Yet is this creed approved<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. I. p. 278.</NOTE> by our Ortho∣dox
Prelate, as free from any mixture of Spino∣zism.
I congratulate his Lordship, on his in∣dulgent
and moderate temper. His Brethren (I
mean those of former times) had much sharper
eyes for spying out a latent Heresy. Yet I can∣not
easily persuade myself, that Virgil's notions
were ever the creed of a religious Society, like
that of the Mysteries. Luckily, indeed, I have
no occasion to persuade myself of it; unless I
should prefer his Lordship's mere authority to
the voice of Antiquity, which assures me, that
this System was either invented or imported into
Greece by Pythagoras; from the writings of
whose disciples Virgil might so very naturally
borrow it.</P>
<P>Anchises then proceeds to inform his son, that
the souls both of men and of animals were of
celestial origin, and (as I understand him) parts
of the Universal Mind; but that by their union
with earthly bodies they contracted such impuri∣ties
as even Death could not purge away. Many
expiations, continues the venerable shade, are re∣quisite,
before the soul, restored to its original
Simplicity, is capable of a place in Elysium.
The far greater part are obliged to revisit the
upper world, in other characters and in other
bodies; and thus by gradual steps to reascend
towards their first perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>
This moral Transmigration was undoubtedly
taught in the Mysteries. As the Bishop asserts
this from the best authority, we are surprized at
a sort of diffidence, unusual to his Lordship,
when he advances things from his own intuitive
knowledge. In one place, this Transmigration
is part of the hidden Doctrine of Perfection<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. I. p. 279.</NOTE>;
in another, it is one of those principles, which
were promiscuously communicated to all<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 142.</NOTE>.
The truth seems to be, that his Lordship was
afraid to rank among the secrets of the Myste∣ries,
what was professed and believed by so many
Nations and Philosophers. The pre-existence of
the human soul is a very natural idea; and from
that idea speculations and fables of its successive
revolution through various bodies will arise.
From Japan to Egypt, the Transmigration has
been part of the popular and religious creed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See our modern Relations of Japan, China, India, &amp;c. and for Egypt, Herodotus, l. ii.</NOTE>.
Pythagoras<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ovid. Metamorph. xv. 69, &amp;c. 158, &amp;c.</NOTE> and Plato<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Plato in Phaedro &amp; in Republic. l. x.</NOTE> have endeavoured
to demonstrate the truth of it, by facts, as well
as by arguments.</P>
<P>Of all these visions (which should have been
confined to the Poets) none is more pleasing and
sublime, than that which Virgil has invented.
Aeneas sees before him his posterity, the Heroes
of antient Rome; a long series of airy forms
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
<Q>Demanding life, impatient for the skies,</Q>
and prepared to assume, with their new bodies,
the little passions and transient glories of their
destined lives.</P>
<P>Having <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">I shall mention here, once for all, that I do not al∣ways confine myself to the ORDER of his Lordship's PROOFS.</NOTE> thus revealed the secret Doctrine
of the Mysteries, the learned Prelate examines
the Ceremonies. With the assistance of Meur∣sius<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Meursii Eleusinia, five de Cereris Eleusinae sacro.</NOTE>, he pours out a torrent of Erudition to
convince us, that the scenes thro' which Aeneas
passed in his descent to the Shades, were the
same as were represented to the Aspirants in the
Celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries. From
thence, his Lordship draws his great conclusion,
That the Descent is no more than an emblem
of the Hero's Initiation.</P>
<P>A staunch Polemic will feed a dispute, by
dwelling on every accessary circumstance, whilst
a candid Critic will confine himself to the more
essential points of it. I shall, therefore, readily
allow, what I believe may in general be true,
that the Mysteries exhibited a theatrical repre∣sentation
of all that was believed or imagined
of the lower world; that the Aspirant was con∣ducted
through the mimic scenes of Erebus, Tar∣tarus,
and Elysium; and that a warm Enthu∣siast,
in describing these awful Spectacles, might
express himself as if he had actually visited the
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
infernal Regions<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See D. L. vol. I. particularly p. 280.</NOTE>. All this I can allow, and
yet allow nothing to the Bishop of Gloucester's
Hypothesis. It is not surprising that the COPY
was like the ORIGINAL; but it still remains un∣determined,
WHETHER VIRGIL INTENDED TO
DESCRIBE THE ORIGINAL OR THE COPY.</P>
<P>Lear and Garrick, when on the stage, are the
same; nor is it possible to distinguish the Player
from the Monarch. In the Green-room, or after
the representation, we easily perceive, what the
warmth of fancy and the justness of imitation
had concealed from us. In the same manner it
is from extrinsical circumstances, that we may
expect the discovery of Virgil's Allegory. Every
one of those circumstances persuades me, that
Virgil described a real, not a mimic world, and
that the Scene lay in the Infernal Shades, and
not in the Temple of Ceres.</P>
<P>The singularity of the Cumoean Shores must
be present to every traveller who has once seen
them. To a superstitious mind, the thin crust,
vast cavities, sulphureous steams, poisonous ex∣halations,
and fiery torrents, may seem to trace
out the narrow Confine of the two Worlds.
The lake Avernus was the chief object of reli∣gious
horror; the black Woods which surround∣ed
it, when Virgil first came to Naples, were
perfectly suited to feed the superstition of the
People<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. v. p. 168.</NOTE>. It was generally believed, that this
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
deadly flood was the entrance of Hell<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Silius Italicus, l. xii.</NOTE>; and
an Oracle was once established on its banks,
which pretended, by magic rites, to call up the
departed Spirits<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sicul. l. iv. p. 267. edit. Wesseling.</NOTE>. Aeneas, who revolved a
more daring enterprise, addresses himself to the
Priestess of those dark Regions. Their conver∣sation
may perhaps inform us, whether an Ini∣tiation,
or a descent to the Shades, was the ob∣ject
of this enterprize. She endeavours to deter
the Hero, by setting before him all the dangers
of his rash undertaking:
<Q><L>Facilis descensus Averni:</L>
<L>Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis;</L>
<L>Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras,</L>
<L>Hoc opus, hic labor est<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, vi. 126.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>These particulars are absolutely irreconcileable
with the idea of Initiation, but perfectly agree∣able
to that of a real descent. That every step,
and every instant, may lead us to the grave is a
melancholy truth. The Mysteries were only
open at stated times, a few days at most in the
course of a year. The mimic descent of the
Mysteries was laborious and dangerous, the re∣turn
to light easy and certain. In real death,
this order is inverted:
<Q><L>Pauci, quos aequus amavit</L>
<L>Jupiter, aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus,</L>
<L>Diis geniti, potuere<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Idem, vi. 129.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34"/>
These Heroes, as we learn from the speech of
Aeneas, were Hercules, Orpheus, Castor and
Pollux, Theseus, and Pirithous. Of all these,
Antiquity believed, that before their death they
had seen the habitations of the dead; nor, in∣deed,
will any of the circumstances tally with a
supposed Initiation. The adventure of Eury∣dice,
the alternate life of the brothers, and the
forcible intrusion of Alcides, Theseus, and Piri∣thous,
would mock the endeavours of the most
subtle Critic, who should try to melt them down
into his favourite Mysteries. The exploits of Her∣cules,
who triumphed over the King of Terrors,
<Q><L>Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit,</L>
<L>Ipsius à solio regis traxitque trementem<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, vi. 395.</NOTE>,</L></Q>
was a wild imagination of the Greeks<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Homer. Odyss. l. xi. ver. 623. Apoll. Biblioth. l. ii. c. 5.</NOTE>. But
it was the duty of antient Poets, to adopt and
embellish these popular Traditions; and it is the
interest of every man of taste, to acquiesce in
THEIR POETICAL FICTIONS.</P>
<P>After this, we may leave ingenious men to
search out what, or whether any thing, gave rise
to those idle stories. Diodorus Siculus represents
Pluto as a kind of undertaker, who made great
improvements in the useful art of funerals<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Sicul. l. v. p. 386. Edit. Wesseling.</NOTE>.
Some have sought for the Poetic Hell in the
mines of Epirus<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Leclerc Biblioth. Universelle, tom. vi. p. 55.</NOTE>, and others in the Mysteries
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
of Egypt. As this last notion was published in
French<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">By the Abbé Terasson, in his Philosophical Romance of Sethos, printed at Amsterdam in the year 1732. See the Third Book, from beginning to end. The author was a Scholar and a Philosopher. His book has far more variety and originality than Telemachus. Yet Sethos is forgotten, and Telemachus will be immortal. That harmony of style, and the great talent of speaking to the heart and passions, which Fenelon possessed, was unknown to Terasson. I am not surprized that Homer was admired by the one, and criti∣cized by the other.</NOTE>, six years before it was invented in
English<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See D. L. vol. I. p. 228, &amp;c. The first edition was printed in London, in the year 1738.</NOTE>, the learned author of the <HI>D. L.</HI> has
been severely treated by some ungenerous Ad∣versaries<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Cowper's Life of Socrates, p. 102.</NOTE>. Appearances, it must be con∣fessed,
wear a very suspicious aspect: But what
are appearances, when weighed against his Lord∣ship's
declaration, <Q REND="inline">That this is a point of ho∣nor
in which he is particularly delicate; and
that he may venture to boast, that he believes
no Author was ever more averse to take to
himself what belonged to another<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Letter from a late Professor of Oxford, &amp;c. p. 133.</NOTE>?</Q> Be∣sides,
he has enriched this mysterious discovery
with many collateral arguments, which would
for ever have escaped all inferior Critics. In the
case of Hercules, for instance, he demonstrates,
that the Initiation and the descent to the Shades
were the same thing, because an Antient has
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
affirmed that they were different<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. III. p. 277.</NOTE>; and that
Alcides was initiated at Eleusis, before he set
out for Taenarus, in order to descend to the In∣fernal
Regions.</P>
<P>There is, however, a single circumstance, in
the narration of Virgil, which has justly sur∣prized
Critics, unacquainted with any, but the
obvious sense of the Poet; I mean the IVORY
GATE. The Bishop of Glocester seizes this, as
the secret mark of Allegory, and becomes elo∣quent
in the exultation of Triumph<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. I. p. 229.</NOTE>. I could,
however, represent to him, that in a work which
was deprived of the Author's last revision, Vir∣gil
might too hastily employ what Homer had
invented, and at last unwarily slide into an Epi∣curean
idea<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. I. p. 283.</NOTE>. Let this be as it may, an ob∣scure
expression is a weak basis for an elaborate
System; and whatever his Lordship may chuse
to do, I had much rather reproach my favourite
Poet with want of care in one line, than with
want of taste throughout a whole Book<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>Horace seems to have used as unguarded an expression▪

Virgil has borrowed, as usual, from Homer,
his Episode of the Infernal Shades, and, as usual,
has infinitely improved what the Grecian had in∣vented.
If, among a profusion of beauties, I
durst venture to point out the most striking
beauties of the Sixth Book, I should perhaps ob∣serve,
1. That after accompanying the Hero
through the silent realms of Night and Chaos,
we see with astonishment and pleasure a new Cre∣ation
bursting upon us; 2. That we examine,
with a delight which springs from the love of
Virtue, the just empire of Minos; in which the
apparent irregularities of the present System are
corrected; where the Patriot who died for his
Country is happy, and the Tyrant who oppressed
it is miserable. 3. As we interest ourselves in
the Hero's fortunes, we share his feelings: The
melancholy Palinurus, the wretched Deiphobus,
the indignant Dido; the Grecian Kings, who
tremble at his presence, and the venerable An∣chises,
who embraces his pious son, and displays
to his sight the future glories of his race; all
these objects affects us with a variety of pleasing
sensations.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment obey the mandate of
our great Critic, and consider these awful scenes
as a mimic shew, exhibited in the Temple of
Ceres, by the contrivance of the Priest, or, if he
pleases, of the Legislator. Whatever was ani∣mated
(I appeal to every reader of taste), what∣ever
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
ever was terrible, or whatever was pathetic, eva∣porates
into lifeless Allegory:
<Q><L>tenuem sine viribus umbram.</L>
<L>Dat inania verba,</L>
<L>Dat sine mente sonum, gressusque effingit euntis.</L></Q></P>
<P>The end of Philosophy is Truth; the end of
Poetry is Pleasure. I willingly adopt any inter∣pretation
which adds new beauties to the Origi∣nal;
I assist in persuading myself, that it is just;
and could almost shew the same indulgence to
the Critic's as to the Poet's fiction. But should
a grave Doctor lay out fourscore pages, in ex∣plaining
away the sense and spirit of Virgil, I
should have every inducement to believe, that
Virgil's soul was very different from the Doctor's.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I have almost exhausted my own, and proba∣bly
my reader's patience, whilst I have obse∣quiously
waited on his Lordship, through the
several stages of an intricate Hypothesis. He
must now permit me to alledge two very simple
reasons, which persuade me, that Virgil has not
revealed the Secret of the Eleusinian Mysteries;
the first is HIS IGNORANCE, and the second HIS
DISCRETION.</P>
<P N="1">I. As his Lordship has not made the smallest
attempt to prove that Virgil was himself ini∣tiated,
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
it is plain that he supposed it, as a thing
of course. Had he any right to suppose it? By
no means: That ceremony might naturally
enough finish the education of a young Athe∣nian;
but a Barbarian, a Roman, would most
probably pass through life without directing his
devotion to the foreign rites of Eleusis.</P>
<P>The Philosophical sentiments of Virgil were
still more unlikely to inspire him with that kind
of devotion. It is well known that he was a de∣termined
Epicurean<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See the Life of Virgil by Donatus, the Sixth Eclogue, and the Second Georgic, ver. 490.</NOTE>; and a very natural An∣tipathy
subsisted between the Epicureans and the
Managers of the Mysteries. The Celebration
opened with a solemn excommunication of those
Atheistical Philosophers, who were commanded
to retire, and to leave that holy place for pious
Believers<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lucian in Alexandro, p. 489.</NOTE>; the zeal of the people was ready
to enforce this admonition. I will not deny, that
curiosity might sometimes tempt an Epicurean
to pry into these secret rites; and that gratitude,
fear, or other motives, might engage the Athe∣nians
to admit so irreligious an Aspirant. Atti∣cus
was initiated at Eleusis; but Atticus was the
Friend and Benefactor of Athens<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit Attici, c. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE>. These
extraordinary exceptions may be proved, but
must not be supposed.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
Nay, more; I am strongly inclined to think
that Virgil was never out of Italy till the last
year of his life. I am sensible, that it is not easy
to prove a negative proposition, more especially
when the materials of our knowledge are so very
few and so very defective<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The Life of Virgil, attributed to Donatus, contains many characteristic particulars; but which are lost in confu∣sion, and disgraced with a mixture of absurd stories, such as none but a Monk of the darker ages could either invent or believe. I always considered them as the interpolations of some more recent writer; and am confirmed in that opinion, by the life of Virgil, pure from those additions, which Mr. Spence lately published, from a Florence MS. at the begin∣ning of Mr. Holdsworth's valuable observations on Virgil.</NOTE>; and yet by glanc∣ing
our eye over the several periods of Virgil's
life, we may perhaps attain a sort of probability,
which ought to have some weight, since nothing
can be thrown into the opposite scale.</P>
<P>Altho' Virgil's father was hardly of a lower
rank than Horace's, yet the peculiar character of
the latter afforded his fon a much superior edu∣cation:
Virgil did not enjoy the same opportu∣nities,
of observing mankind on the great The∣atre
of Rome, or of pursuing Philosophy, in her
favourite shades of the Academy.<Q><L>Adjecêre bonae paulò plus artis Athenae:</L>
<L>Scilicet ut possem curvo dignoscere rectum,</L>
<L>Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Horat. l. II. ep. ii. ver. 43.</NOTE>.</L></Q> <PB N="39" REF="41"/>
The sphere of Virgil's education did not extend
beyond Mantua, Cremona, Milan and Naples<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Virgil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the accidents of civil war had introduc∣ed
Virgil to the knowledge of the Great, he
passed a few years at Rome, in a state of depen∣dance,
the JUVENUM NOBILIUM CLIENS<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Horat l. IV. od. xii.</NOTE>.
It was during that time that he composed his
Eclogues, the hasty productions of a Muse ca∣pable
of far greater things<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Virgil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the liberality of Augustus and his cour∣tiers,
Virgil soon became possessed of an affluent
fortune<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Prope <HI>Centies Sestertium,</HI> about eighty thousand pounds.</NOTE>. He composed the Georgics and
the Aeneid, in his elegant Villas of Campania
and Sicily; and seldom quitted those pleasing
retreats even to come to Rome<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Virgil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After he had finished the Aeneid, he resolved
on a journey into Greece and Asia, to employ
three years in revising and perfecting that Poem,
and to devote the remainder of his life to the
study of Philosophy<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>. He was at Athens,
with Augustus, in the summer of AVC 735;
and whilst Augustus was at Athens, the Eleusi∣nian
Mysteries were celebrated<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">They always began the fifteenth of the Attic month Boedromion, and lasted nine days. Those who take the trouble of calculating the Athenian Calendar, on the princi∣ples laid down by Mr. Dodwell (de Cyclis Antiquis) and by Dr. Halley, will find, that A V C. Varr. 735, the 15th of Boedromion coincided with the 24th of August of the Julian year. But if we may believe Dion Cassius, the Celebration was this year anticipated, on account of Augustus and the Indian Philosopher. L. LIV. p. 739. edit. Reimar.</NOTE>. It is not
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
impossible, that Virgil might then be initiated,
as well as the Indian Philosopher<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. xv. p. 720.</NOTE>; but the
Aeneid could receive no improvement from his
newly-acquired knowledge. He was taken ill
at Megara. The journey encreased his disorder,
and he expired at Brundusium, the twenty-se∣cond
of September of the same year 735<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Virgil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Should it then appear probable, that Virgil
had no opportunity of learning the SECRET of
the Mysteries, it will be something more than
probable, that he has not revealed what he ne∣ver
knew.</P>
<P>His Lordship will perhaps tell me, that Vir∣gil
might be initiated into the Eleusinian Myste∣ries,
without making a Journey to Athens: since
those Mysteries had been brought to Rome long
before<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. I. p. 188.</NOTE>. Here indeed I should be apt to sus∣pect
some mistake, or, at least, a want of preci∣sion
in his Lordship's Ideas; as Salmasius<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Salmasius ad Scriptores Hist. August. p. 55.</NOTE>
and Casaubon<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Casaubon ad Scriptor. Hist. August. p. 25.</NOTE>, men tolerably versed in An∣tiquity,
assure me, that indeed some Grecian
Ceremonies of Ceres had been practised at Rome
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
from the earliest Ages; but that the Mysteries
of Eleusis were never introduced into that Ca∣pital,
either by the Emperor Hadrian, or by
any other: And I am the more induced to be∣lieve,
that these rites were not imported in Vir∣gil's
time, as the accurate Suetonius speaks of
an unsuccessful attempt for that purpose, made
by the Emperor Claudius, above threescore years
after Virgil's death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in Claud. c. 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. None but the Initiated COULD reveal the
secret of the Mysteries; and THE INITIATED
COULD NOT REVEAL IT, WITHOUT VIOLATING
THE LAWS, AS WELL OF HONORAS OF RELIGION.
I sincerely acquit the Bishop of Glocester of any
design; yet so unfortunate is his System, that it
represents a most virtuous and elegant Poet, as
equally devoid of taste, and of common honesty.</P>
<P>His Lordship acknowledges, that the Initiated
were bound to Secrecy by the most solemn obli∣gations<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. I. p. 147.</NOTE>; that Virgil was conscious of the
imputed impiety of his design; that at Athens
he never durst have ventured on it; that even
at Rome such a discovery was esteemed not
only IMPIOUS but INFAMOUS: and yet his Lord∣ship
maintains, that after the compliment of a
formal Apology,
<Q><L>Sit mihi fas, audita loqui<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 240.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
Virgil lays open the whole SECRET of the My∣steries
under the thin Veil of an Allegory,
which could deceive none but the most careless
readers<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">D. L. vol. I. p. 277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>An Apology! an Allegory! Such artifices
might perhaps have saved him from the sen∣tence
of the Areopagus, had some zealous or in∣terested
Priest denounced him to that court, as
guilty of publishing A BLASPHEMOUS POEM. But
the Laws of Honor are more rigid, and yet
more liberal, than those of Civil Tribunals.
Sense, not words, is considered; and Guilt is
aggravated, not protected, by artful Evasions.
Virgil would still have incurred the severe cen∣sure
of a Contemporary, who was himself a man
of very little Religion.
<Q><L>Vetabo, qui Cereris sacrum</L>
<L>Vulgârit arcanae, sub iisdem</L>
<L>Sit trabibus, fragilemque mecum</L>
<L>Solvat phaselum<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Horat. l. III. od. ii.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
Nor can I easily persuade myself, that the inge∣nuous
mind of Virgil could have deserved this
Excommunication.</P>
<P>These lines belong to an Ode of Horace,
which has every merit, except that of order.
That Death in our Country's cause is pleasant
and honourable; that Virtue does not depend
on the caprice of a popular Election; and that
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
the Mysteries of Ceres ought not to be disclosed,
are ideas which have no apparent connection.
The beautiful disorder of Lyric Poetry, is the
usual Apology made by Professed Critics on
these occasions:
<Q><L>Son style impetueux, souvent marche au hazard;</L>
<L>Chez elle, un beau desordre est un effet de l' art<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Boileau, Art Poetique, l. ii. v. 72.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
An insufficient Apology for the few, who dare
judge from their own feelings. I shall not deny,
that the irregular notes of an untutored Muse
have sometimes delighted me. We can very
seldom be displeased with the unconstrained
workings of Nature. But the Liberty of an Out∣law
is very different from that of a Savage. It
is a mighty disagreeable sight, to observe a Ly∣ric
Writer of Taste and Reflection striving to
forget the Laws of Composition, disjointing the
order of his Ideas, and working himself up into
artificial Madness,
<Q>Ut cum Ratione insaniat.</Q>
I had once succeeded (as I thought) in remov∣ing
this defect, by the help of an Hypothesis
which connected the several parts of Horace's
Ode with each other. My Ideas appeared (I
mean to myself) most ingeniously conceived. I
read the Ode once more, and burnt my Hypo∣thesis.
But to return to our principal subject.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
The Date of this Ode may be of use to us;
and the date may be fixed with tolerable cer∣tainty,
from the mention of the PARTHIANS,
who are described as the enemies against whom
a brave youth should signalize his valor.
<Q><L><HI>Parthos</HI> feroces</L>
<L>Vexet eques metuendus hastâ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Those who are used to the LABOURED HAPPINESS
of all Horace's expressions<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><HI>Curiosa Felicitas.</HI> The ingenious Dr. Warton has a
very strong dislike to this celebrated character of Horace. I
suspect that I am in the wrong, since, in a point of Criti∣cism, I differ from Dr. Warton. I cannot however forbear thinking, that the expression <HI>is itself</HI> what Petronius wished to describe; the happy Union of such Ease as seems the gift of fortune, with such justness as can only be the result of care and labor.</NOTE> will readily al∣low,
that if the Parthians are mentioned rather
than the Britons or Cantabrians, the Gauls or
the Dalmatians, it could be only at a time when
a PARTHIAN WAR engaged the public atten∣tion.
This reflection confines us between the
years of Rome 729 and 735. Of these six years,
that of 734 has a superior claim to the Compo∣sition
of the Ode.</P>
<P>Julius Caesar was prevented by death from
revenging the defeat of Crassus<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in Caesar. c. 44.</NOTE>. This glo∣rious
task, unsuccessfully attempted by Marc
Antony<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Plut. in Vit. Anton. Julian in Caesar. p. 324. edit. Spanheim.</NOTE>, seemed to be reserved for the pru∣dence
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
and felicity of Augustus; who became
sole master of the Roman World in the year
724; but it was not till the year 729, that,
having changed the civil administration, and
pacified the Western provinces, he had leisure
to turn his Views towards the East. From that
time, Horace, in compliance with the Public
wish, began to animate both Prince and People
to revenge the manes of Crassus<NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Horat. l. I. od. ii. L. III. od. v. L. II. serm. i. v. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The
cautious Policy of Augustus, still averse to war,
was at length roused in the year 734, by some
disturbances in Armenia. He passed over into
Asia, and sent the young Tiberius with an army
beyond the Euphrates. Every appearance pro∣mised
a glorious war. But the Parthian mon∣arch,
Phrahates, alarmed at the approach of
the Roman Legions, and diffident of the fidelity
of his subjects, diverted the storm, by a timely
and humble submission:
<Q><L>Jus, imperiumque Phraates</L>
<L>Caesaris accepit gentibus minor<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Horat. l. I. epist. xii. Vall. Pater. l. II. c. xciv. Tacit. Annal. l. II. c. i. Sueton. in Octav. c. xxi. and in Tiber. c. xiv. Justin, l.

Caesar returned in Triumph to Rome, with the
Parthian Hostages, and the Roman ensigns,
which had been taken from Crassus.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
These busy scenes, which engage the attention
of Contemporaries, are far less interesting to po∣sterity,
than the silent labours, or even amuse∣ments
of a man of Genius.<Q><L>Caesar dum magnus ad altum</L>
<L>Fulminat Euphraten bello, victorque volentes</L>
<L>Per Populos dat jura, viamque adfectat Olympo.</L>
<L>Illo Virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat</L>
<L>Parthenope, studiis florentem, ignobilis otî.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whilst Caesar humbled the Parthians, Virgil
was composing the Aeneid. It is well known,
that this noble Poem occupied the Author, with∣out
being able to satisfy him, during the twelve
last years of his life, from the year 723 to the
year 735<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Virgil.</NOTE>. The public expectation was soon
raised, and the modest Virgil was sometimes ob∣bliged
to gratify the impatient curiosity of his
friends. Soon after the death of young Mar∣cellus<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Marcellus died in the latter end of the year 731 <HI>Usserii Annales, p.</HI> 555.</NOTE>, he recited the second, fourth, and
SIXTH books of the Aeneid, in the presence of
Augustus and Octavia<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Donat. in Virgil.</NOTE>. He even sometimes
read parts of his work to more numerous com∣panies;
with a desire of obtaining their judg∣ment,
rather than their applause. In this man∣ner,
Propertius seems to have heard the SHIELD
OF AENEAS, and from that specimen he ventures
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
to foretell the approaching birth of a Poem,
which will surpass the Iliad.
<Q><L>Actia Virgilium Custodis litora Phoebi,</L>
<L>Caesaris &amp; fortes dicere posse rates</L>
<L>Qui nunc Aeneae Trojani suscitat Arma</L>
<L>Jactaque Lavinis moenia litoribus.</L>
<L>Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Graii,</L>
<L>Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Propert. l. II. el. xxv. v. 66.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
As a friend and as a Critic, Horace was entitled
to all Virgil's confidence, and was probably ac∣quainted
with the whole progress of the Aeneid,
from the first rude sketch, which Virgil drew
up in Prose, to that harmonious Poetry, which
the author alone thought unworthy of posterity.</P>
<P>To resume my Idea, which depended on this
long deduction of Circumstances; when Horace
composed the second ode of his third Book, the
Aeneid, and particularly the Sixth Book, were
already known to the Public. The detestation
of the Wretch who reveals the Mysteries of Ce∣res,
though expressed in general terms, must
be applied by all Rome to the author of the
Sixth Book of the Aeneid. Can we seriously
suppose, THAT HORACE WOULD HAVE BRANDED
WITH SUCH WANT ON IN FAMY, ONE OF THE MEN
IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVED AND HONOURED
THE MOST<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Horat. l. I. od. iii. L. I. serm. v. ver. 39, &amp;c.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50"/>
Nothing remains to say, except that Horace
was himself ignorant of his friend's allegorical
meaning, which the Bishop of Glocester has
since revealed to the World. It may be so;
yet, for my own part, I should be very well sa∣tisfied
with understanding Virgil no better than
Horace did.</P>
<P>It is perhaps some such foolish fondness for
Antiquity, which inclines me to doubt, whether
the BISHOP OF GLOCESTER has really united
the severe sense of ARISTOTLE with the sublime
imagination of LONGINUS. Yet a judicious
Critic, (who is now, I believe, ARCHDEACON
OF GLOCESTER) assures the Public, that his
Patron's mere amusements have done much
more than the joint labours of the two Gre∣cians.
I shall conclude these observations with
a remarkable passage from the Archdeacon's
Dedication<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See the Dedication of Horace's Epistle to Augustus, with an English Commentary and Notes.</NOTE>: <Q REND="inline">It was not enough, in YOUR
ENLARGED VIEW OF THINGS, to restore
either of these models (ARISTOTLE or LON∣GINUS)
to their original splendor. They were
both to be revived; or rather A NEW ORI∣GINAL
PLAN OF CRITICISM to be struck
out, WHICH SHOULD UNITE THE VIRTUES OF
EACH OF THEM. This Experiment was
made on the two greatest of our own Poets
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
(Shakespeare and Pope), and by reflecting all
the LIGHTS OF THE IMAGINATION ON THE
SEVEREST REASON, every thing was affected
which the warmest admirer of antient art
could promise himself from such a union.
BUT YOU WENT FARTHER: By joining to
these powers A PERFECT INSIGHT INTO HU∣MAN

of literary, by the justest moral censure, YOU

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS not ignorant, that, several years
since, the Rev. Dr. Jortin had favoured
the Public, with a DISSERTATION ON THE
STATE OF THE DEAD, AS DESCRIBED BY HO∣MER
AND VIRGIL<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Six Dissertations on Different Subjects, published in a Volume in Octavo, in the year 1755, It is the Sixth Dis∣sertation, p. 207-324.</NOTE>: But the Book is now
grown so scarce, that I was not able to procure
a sight of it till after these Papers had been
already sent to the press. I found Dr. Jortin's
performance, as I expected, moderate, learned,
and critical. Among a variety of ingenious
observations, there are two or three which are
very closely connected with my present subject.</P>
<P>I had passed over in silence one argument of
the Bishop of Glocester, or rather of Scarron
and the Bishop of Glocester; since the former
found the Remark, and the latter furnished the
Inference.
<Q>Discite justitiam moniti, &amp; non temnere Divos,</Q>
cries the unfortunate Phlegyas. In the midst
of his torments, he preaches Justice and Piety,
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
like Ixion in Pindar. A very useful piece of
advice, says the French Buffoon, for those who
were already damned to all Eternity:
<Q><L>Cette sentence est bonne &amp; belle:</L>
<L>Mais en enfer, de quoi sert elle?</L></Q>
From this judicious piece of Criticism his
Lordship argues, that Phlegyas was preaching
not to the Dead, but to the Living; and that
Virgil is only describing the Mimic Tartarus,
which was exhibited at Eleusis for the instruc∣tion
of the Initiated.</P>
<P>I shall transcribe one or two of the reasons,
which Dr. Jortin condescends to oppose to Scar∣ron's
Criticism.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>To preach to the Damned, says he, is la∣bour
in vain. And what if it is? It might
be part of his punishment, to exhort himself
and others, when exhortations were too late.
This admonition, as far as it relates to him∣self
and his companions in misery, is to be
looked upon not so much as an admonition
to amend, but as a bitter sarcasm, and re∣proaching
of past iniquities.</P>
<P>It is labour in vain. But in the poetical
system, it seems to have been the occupa∣tion
of the Damned to labour in vain, to
catch at meat and drink that fled from
them, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54"/>
His instruction, like that of Ixion in
Pindar, might be for the use of the living.
You will say, <HI>how can that be?</HI> Surely no∣thing
is more easy and intelligible. The
Muses hear him—The Muses reveal it to
the Poet, and the inspired Poet reveals it
to mankind. And so much for Phlegyas
and Monsieur Scarron.</P></Q></P>
<P>It is prettily observed by Dr. Jortin, <Q REND="inline">That
Virgil, after having shone out with full splen∣dor
through the Sixth Book, sets at last in a
cloud.</Q> The IVORY GATE puzzles every
Commentator, and grieves every lover of Virgil:
Yet it affords no advantages to the Bishop of
Glocester. The objection presses as hard on
the notion of an Initiation, as on that of a real
Descent to the Shades. <Q REND="inline">The troublesome
conclusion still remains as it was; and from
the manner in which the Hero is dismissed
after the Ceremonies, we learn, that in those
Initiations, the Machinery, and the whole
Shew, was (in the Poet's opinion) a repre∣sentation
of things, which had no truth or
reality.</Q><Q><L>Altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto:</L>
<L>Sed <HI>FALSA</HI> ad coelum mittunt <HI>INSOMNIA</HI> manes.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Dreams in general, may be called <HI>vain</HI> and
<HI>deceitful, somnia vana,</HI> or <HI>somnia falsa,</HI> if
you will, as they are opposed to the <HI>real</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
objects, which present themselves to us when
we are awake. But when <HI>false</HI> dreams are
opposed to <HI>true</HI> ones, there the Epithet <HI>falsa</HI>
has another meaning. True dreams represent
what is real, and shew what is true; false
dreams represent things, which are not, or
which are not true. Thus Homer and Vir∣gil,
and many other poets, and indeed the
nature of the thing, distinguish them.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Jortin, though with reluctance, acqui∣esces
in the common opinion, that by six un∣lucky
lines, Virgil is destroying the beautiful
System, which it had cost him eight hundred
to raise. He explains too this preposterous
conduct, by the usual expedient of the Poet's
Epicureism. I only differ from him in attri∣buting
to haste and indiscretion, what he consi∣ders
as the result of design.</P>
<P>Another reason, both new and ingenious, is
assigned by Dr. Jortin, for Virgil explaining
away his Hero's descent into an idle dream.
<Q REND="inline">All communication with the Dead, the in∣fernal
powers, &amp;c. belonged to the Art
Magic, and Magic was held in abomina∣tion
by the Romans.</Q> Yet if it was held in
ABOMINATION, it was supposed to be real. A
writer would not have made his court to James
the first, by representing the stories of Witch∣craft
as the Phantoms of an over-heated Ima∣gination.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56"/>
Whilst I am writing, a sudden thought oc∣curs
to me, which, rude and imperfect as it is,
I shall venture to throw out to the Public. It
is this. After Virgil, in imitation of Homer,
had described the two Gates of Sleep, the Horn
and the Ivory, he again takes up the first in a
different sense:
<Q>QUA VERIS FACILIS DATUR EXITUS UMBRIS.</Q>
The TRUE SHADES, VERAE UMBRAE, were those
airy forms which were continually sent to animate
new bodies, such light and almost immaterial
Natures as could without difficulty pass through
a thin transparent substance. In this new sense,
Aeneas and the Sybill, who were still incum∣bered
with a load of flesh, could not pretend to
the prerogative of TRUE SHADES. In their
passage over Styx, they had almost sunk Cha∣ron's
boat.<Q><L>Gemuit sub pondere cymba</L>
<L>Sutilis, &amp; multam accepit rimosa paludem.</L></Q></P>
<P>Some other Expedient was requisite for their
return; and since the Horn Gate would not af∣ford
them an easy dismission, the other passage,
which was adorned with polished Ivory, was
the only one that remained either for them, or
for the Poet.</P>
<P>By this explanation, we save Virgil's judge¦ment
and religion, though I must own, at the
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
expence of an uncommon harshness and am∣biguity
of expression. Let it only be remem∣bered,
that those, who, in desperate cases, con∣jecture
with modesty, have a right to be heard
with indulgence.</P>
