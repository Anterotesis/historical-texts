<L>COLD-BLOODED critics, by enervate sires</L>

<L>IN the first seat, in robe of various dyes,</L>

<L N="165">The other held a globe, which to his will</L>

<L>His rigid judgment Fancy's flights restrain'd,</L>

<L>The Book of Man he read with nicest art,</L>

The coxcomb felt a lash in ev'ry word,</L>
<L>And fools hung out their brother fools deterr'd.</L>

<L>BUT, hark!—The trumpet sounds, the crowd gives way,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now should I, in some sweet poetic line,</L>
<L N="190">Offer up incense at APOLLO'S shrine;</L>
<L>Invoke the Muse to quit her calm abode,</L>

<L>FIRST, Order came,—with solemn step, and slow,</L>
<L>In measur'd time his feet were taught to go.</L>
<L>Behind, from time to time, he cast his eye,</L>

<L>IN Brute he shone unequall'd: all agree</L>
<L>GARRICK'S not half so great a Brute as he.</L>
<L>When Cato's labour'd scenes are brought to view,</L>
<L>With equal praise the Actor labour'd too.</L>
<L N="655">For still you'll find, trace passions to their root,</L>
<L>Small diff'rence 'twixt the Stoic and the Brute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN fancied scenes, as in life's real plan,</L>
<L>He could not, for a moment, sink the Man.</L>
<L>In whate'er cast his character was laid,</L>
<L N="660">Self still, like oil, upon the surface play'd.</L>
<L>Nature, in spite of all his skill, crept in:</L>
<L>Horatio, Dorax, Falstaff,—still 'twas Q<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>N.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEXT follows SH<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>N.—A doubtful name,</L>
<L>As yet unsettled in the rank of Fame.</L>
<L N="665">This, fondly lavish in his praises grown,</L>
<L>Gives him all merit; That, allows him none.</L>
<L>Between them both, we'll steer the middle course,</L>
<L>Nor, loving Praise, rob Judgment of her force.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
<L>JUST his conceptions, natural and great:</L>
<L N="670">His feelings strong, his words enforc'd with weight.</L>
<L>Was speech-fam'd Q<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>N himself to hear him speak,</L>
<L>Envy would drive the colour from his cheek:</L>
<L>But step-dame Nature, niggard of her grace,</L>
<L>Deny'd the social pow'rs of voice and face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="675">Fix'd in one frame of features, glare of eye,</L>
<L>Passions, like Chaos, in confusion lie:</L>
<L>In vain the wonders of his skill are try'd</L>
<L>To form Distinction Nature hath deny'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His voice no touch of harmony admits,</L>
<L N="680">Irregularly deep and shrill by fits:</L>
<L>The two extremes appear, like man and wife,</L>
<L>Coupled together for the sake of strife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Action's always strong, but sometimes such</L>
<L>That Candour must declare, he acts too much.</L>
<L N="685">Why must Impatience fall three paces back?</L>
<L>Why paces three return to the attack?</L>
<L>Why is the right leg too forbid to stir,</L>
<L>Unless in motion semicircular?</L>
<L>Why must the Heroe with the Nailor vie,</L>
<L N="690">And hurl the close-clench'd fist at nose or eye?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
<L>IN Royal John, with Philip angry grown,</L>
<L>I thought he would have knock'd poor D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>V<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>S down.</L>
<L>Inhuman tyrant! was it not a shame</L>
<L>To fright a king so harmless and so tame?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="695">BUT, spight of all defects, his glories rise;</L>
<L>And Art, by Judgment form'd, with Nature vies.</L>
<L>Behold him sound the depth of HUBERT'S soul,</L>
<L>Whilst in his own contending passions roll.</L>
<L>View the whole scene, with critic judgment scan,</L>
<L N="700">And then—deny him Merit if you can.</L>
<L>Where he falls short, 'tis Nature's fault alone;</L>
<L>Where he succeds, the Merit's all his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LAST, GARRICK came.—Behind him throng a train</L>
<L>Of snarling critics, ignorant as vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="705">ONE finds out,—"He's of stature somewhat low,—</L>
<L>" Your Heroe always should be tall you know.—</L>
<L>" True nat'ral greatness all consists in height."—</L>
<L>Produce your voucher, Critic.—"Serjeant KYTE."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ANOTHER can't forgive the paltry arts</L>
<L N="710">By which he makes his way to shallow hearts;</L>
<L>Mere pieces of finesse, traps for applause.—</L>
<L>" Avant unnat'ral start, affected pause."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
<L>FOR me, by Nature form'd to judge with phlegm,</L>
<L>I can't acquit by wholesale nor condemn.</L>
<L N="715">The best things carried to excess are wrong;</L>
<L>The start may be too frequent, pause too long.</L>
<L>But only us'd in proper time and place,</L>
<L>Severest judgment must allow them Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IF Bunglers, form'd on Imitation's plan,</L>
<L N="720">Just in the way that Monkies mimic Man;</L>
<L>Their copied scene with mangled arts disgrace,</L>
<L>And pause and start with the same vacant face;</L>
<L>We join the critic laugh; those tricks we scorn,</L>
<L>Which spoil the scenes they mean them to adorn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="715">BUT when, from Nature's pure and genuine source,</L>
<L>These strokes of acting flow with gen'rous force;</L>
<L>When in the features all the soul's portray'd,</L>
<L>And passions, such as GARRICK'S, are display'd;</L>
<L>To me they seem from quickest feelings caught:</L>
<L N="800">Each start, is Nature; and each pause, is Thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Reason yields to Passion's wild alarms,</L>
<L>And the whole state of Man is up in arms;</L>
<L>What, but a Critic, could condemn the Play'r</L>
<L>For pausing here, when Cool Sense pauses there?</L>
<L N="805">Whilst, working from the heart, the fire I trace,</L>
<L>And mark it strongly flaming to the face;</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
Whilst, in each sound, I hear the very man;</L>
<L>I can't catch words, and pity those who can.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET Wits, like Spiders, from the tortur'd brain</L>
<L N="810">Fine-draw the critic-web with curious pain;</L>
<L>The Gods,—a kindness I with thanks must pay,—</L>
<L>Have form'd me of a coarser kind of clay;</L>
<L>Nor stung with Envy, nor with Spleen diseas'd,</L>
<L>A poor dull creature, still with Nature pleas'd:</L>
<L N="815">Hence to thy praises, GARRICK, I agree,</L>
<L>And, pleas'd with Nature, must be pleas'd with Thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now might I tell how silence reign'd throughout,</L>
<L>And deep attention hush'd the rabble rout;</L>
<L>How ev'ry claimant, tortur'd with desire,</L>
<L N="820">Was pale as ashes, or as red as fire:</L>
<L>But, loose to Fame, the Muse more simply acts,</L>
<L>Rejects all flourish, and relates mere facts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE judges, as the sev'ral parties came,</L>
<L>With Temper heard, with Judgment weigh'd each claim,</L>
<L N="825">And in their sentence happily agreed,</L>
<L>In name of both, Great SHAKESPEAR thus decreed:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
<L>" IF Manly Sense; if Nature, link'd with Art;</L>
<L>" If thorough Knowledge of the Human Heart;</L>
<L>" If Pow'rs of Acting, vast and unconfin'd;</L>
<L N="830">" If fewest Faults, with greatest Beauties join'd;</L>
<L>" If strong Expression, and strange Pow'rs, which lie</L>
<L>" Within the magic circle of the eye;</L>
<L>" If Feelings which few hearts, like His, can know,</L>
<L>" And which no Face so well as His can shew;</L>
<L>" Deserve the Pref'rence;—GARRICK take the Chair;</L>
<L N="536">" Nor quit it—'till Thou place an Equal There.</L>
