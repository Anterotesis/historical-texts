<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>JOHN DYER,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Shall not trouble my kind Reader with a tedious Apology for the Publishing of this Narrative, but as I hope I have, by the Blessing of God, a due sense of my Sins and the folly of my Youth; I think it my Duty to Almighty God and my Country, to Declare openly and truely, such Things as
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
shall be for the Publick Good, and a warning to all Honest Men, that they may secure themselves, their Houses, Goods and Money, from the vile Practices of Highwaymen, Street-Robbers, and House-Breakers, and all sorts of Thieves; and I hope my unhappy Fate will be a warning to all Persons against the committing such Crimes, as I sadly La∣ment, and am to Suffer for, as the just Rewards of my Evil Deeds: I beg leave to say, that I was born of honest Parents at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who gave me a Sober and solid Education; and when I left my School, they put me to an honest Trade, a <HI>Cordwainer,</HI> to which I serv'd my Apprenticeship: At my first falling into this wicked Course of Life; being short of Money, I made bold to Rob a <HI>Chandlers Shop</HI> of the Money-Box of about 30 s. at <HI>Collingbourn</HI> in the County of <HI>Wilts,</HI> and got clear off without being any ways sus∣pected: Some time after that, my Master sent me one <HI>Sunday</HI> to another <HI>Chandlers∣Shop</HI> to get him a Shillingsworth of Half∣pence, and there being no Body at Home, I cut the Bar of the Window off, and got in and Rifled all the Shop: I took all the Money I could find, it being about three half Crowns, and out of a merry Frolick I brought away all the Raisins and Currants that were in the Shop, and they was like to betray me, but I stood it out, with a great Assurance, and
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
so I got off. I was however, search'd for the Money, but I had hid it in a parcel of Nettles, but in their searching of me they found some of the Raisins in my Coat-Pocket; but as usual, I insisted upon it, that I bought them at <HI>Andover</HI> Market the <HI>Saturday</HI> before, and they could not disprove me, so I got clear off. Some short time after, my Master send∣ing me to <HI>Andover</HI> Market with five Pound to buy some Leather, another Boy and I agreed together to feign a Story as if I had been Robb'd of the Money, so I went home and told my Master that I was Robb'd, and brought the other Boy, who was concern'd with me, who vouch'd it to be True; so the Boy and I shared the five Pound between us: This was done near <HI>Lurgershel</HI> in <HI>Wilt∣shire.</HI></P>
<P>My Master sometime after that, sent me amongst his Customers to get in some Money which was due to him, upon which I got up about three Pound, and as soon as I receiv'd it I went off with it, and made the best of my way for <HI>Salisbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire</HI>; as soon as I came there, I got acquainted with a young Woman, and with her Assistance and my own, we soon spent the Money; when Madam found the Money gone, she march'd off too, and then I was put to my Shift. Going one Market Day into the Market, I spy'd a young Woman, and saw her receive
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
some Money, then I watch'd her till she left the Town, when I follow'd her and overtook her, and knock'd her down, and Robb'd her of what Money she had; afterwards I made her go into the Wood, where I made her comply to my Lustful desire; after I had my Will of her, I tied her to a Tree, and there left her; this Robbery was committed about two Miles from <HI>Salisbury.</HI> Afterwards I made my Addresses to a young Woman at a Place call'd <HI>Forthingbridge</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> I went there to Work Journey work, and so became acquainted with her; but after some small Acquaintance, I went to Lodge at her Mo∣thers, and that was what I wanted, after I had lodg'd some short Time there, I made bold to take up my Lodging with the Daugh∣ter, which occasion'd a Swelling in her Belly; finding herself with Child, she and I consult∣ed to Rob her Mother, which we did of twenty Pounds; after that we made the best of our way for <HI>Bristol,</HI> there we liv'd upon the Reversion of the Money till it was all gone: Then she return'd once more to pay another visit to her Mother, where the good old Woman receiv'd her and the Child, with abundance of Joy; I thought it not proper for me to appear, therefore I made the best of my way, and left the good old Woman to take care of her Dutiful Daughter and Grand∣Child.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
After this I made the best of my way to see my Mother at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> I had not been long with her, but I took an opportunity to Rob her of fifty Pounds, and went immedi∣ately for <HI>Bristol,</HI> and there Gamed best part of the Money away: Then I took to Work at my Trade again, and from <HI>Bristol,</HI> I went to a place call'd <HI>Thornbury</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire</HI>; and there I came acquainted with one Mrs. <HI>Low</HI> a Widow Woman, where we liv'd toge∣ther about six Months, and we took the Town in for about 30 <HI>l.</HI> then we Sold all off, and went to a Place call'd <HI>Weekware,</HI> and there the Biter was Bit; for I agreed with a <HI>Collier</HI> to go Partners with him, and was to give him 50 <HI>l.</HI> whereof I gave him 30 <HI>l.</HI> down, and was to pay him the other Monthly, but before I came to pay the first Payment, my very good Friend the <HI>Collier</HI> went off of the Ground, <HI>and so the Biter was Bit indeed,</HI> so I pack'd up my Awls and came packing away from thence.</P>
<P>From thence I went to a Place call'd <HI>Bart∣ley</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> and there I work'd very honestly for sometime, till I was known by a Man that came from <HI>Thornbury,</HI> and was oblig'd to move farther, for fear of being be∣tray'd, so I pack'd up my Awls there likewise, and went to <HI>Hereford</HI> City, and Work'd there very Honestly; till one Night I was in Com∣pany with a <HI>Higler,</HI> and he said he was a go∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
to a Place call'd <HI>Ross,</HI> to buy some Fowls; I readily reply'd, I don't care if I go along with you, he said he should be very glad of my Company, but poor Man, he little thought I should deprive him of his Journey; the next Day accordingly we set out, and had not gone above four Miles but I attack'd my Fellow∣Traveller, and robb'd him of two Shillings; I thought that but a very small matter of Money for him to buy Poultry with, there∣fore I had a thought came into my Head to search the Hampers, and accordingly I did, where I found twelve Pounds; so I left him his Hampers to look on, but his Horse I took, and rid him about 40 Miles, and then turn'd him loose: After that I went to <HI>Marlborough</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and stay'd there about a Fort∣night, there I was taken and put into <HI>Marl∣borough</HI> Goal for a Silver pint Mug where I remain'd about a Fortnight, but one Night I took an Opportunity and made my Escape, and never had the Manners to take my leave of my new Landlord, which gave me some uneasiness, but that soon went off.</P>
<P>From thence I went to see an <HI>Aunt</HI> of mine, at a Place call'd <HI>Douton,</HI> within seven or eight Miles of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and there I re∣main'd till my <HI>Uncle</HI> and <HI>Aunt</HI> began to have Words about me; but the first Oppor∣tunity I had, I took my Leave of my <HI>Uncle</HI> and Aunt, and went afterwards to my own
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
Sister, and there liv'd with her about six Months, and I met with an old Play∣mate, where we renew'd our former Ac∣quaintance, and began to play some of our old former Pranks; for we thought, what we took from our own Friends, was our own, and no Robbery, we having in our Opinion, as much right to it as them; so we very dishonestly, and he like an unduti∣ful Son, began with his own Mother, and robb'd her to the Value of about fifty Shil∣lings, or three Pounds; and then we re∣turn'd to our old Course of Life, Gaming, as we had done before; but we was disap∣pointed of our Aim, for we was soon ap∣prehended and taken, and brought Home to his Mother's, where we were mightily per∣suaded to own the Robbery, but we as usu∣al brazen'd it out; but after all, they carri∣ed us before a Justice of the Peace, and he very honestly committed us to <HI>Bridewell</HI>; where not approving of our new Lodging, we thought it not convenient for us to stay, therefore we made our Way thro' the Neces∣sary-House, without so much as taking Leave of our Landlord.</P>
<P>Afterwards I turn'd Jockey, and went to Horse-Coursing, and took as many Horses one Spring, out of the King's New-Forest, near <HI>Rumsay,</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> as I sold for a∣bove threescore Pounds, at thirty and forty
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Shillings a-piece; they were none of your large Horses, but only little Foresters; and indeed, I went so often, that I was asham'd to go any more, for fear that the People should think much of my Coming, so I thought it best to leave off in Time; but soon after I stole a Horse, and set up a new Trade, but do not think it proper to name the Man, that I stole the Horse from, because the Owner of it is a-live, and he knows me. I went to work, and the first Man I met with in that Way, was one Mr. <HI>Whitehead,</HI> a Painter, and I robb'd him of eighteen Shillings and a Plate-button-Coat, and coming bravely off of that, put more Courage into me; and I bought me a Pair of Pistols with some of the Money, for I had but one before, and then I was stock'd very well. And so I proceeded on too,</P>
<P>The next Adventure, which was with an old Man, that was going to Market, to buy a Pig, but I soon stopp'd his Journey, and robb'd him, and took what Money he had away from him, and sent him Home about his Business; the Man is since dead, he lived at a Place called <HI>White-Parish,</HI> near <HI>Salisbury,</HI> his Name was <HI>John Price,</HI> a Taylor. After∣wards I went on with my old, or rather new Game, and with Abundance of Cou∣rage, having pretty good Success, the next that I met with was a Butter-Woman, com∣ing
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
from <HI>Rumsay-Market,</HI> and I robb'd her of twelve Shillings, and made her go about her Business; she had not been gone long, but came by a Servant-Maid, just out of Place, so I made bold to rifle her of all the Money she had. The Sum mounted to three and fifty Shillings, and a Ring from her, and after having served her so, I thought it Pity to let her carry a Box of Luggage, and eased her of that also; in the Box I found two Suits of Cloaths, and Linnen, and other Necessaries, which served for tra∣velling Charges, so I came away about my Business.</P>
<P>From thence I went to <HI>Winchester,</HI> and there I dispos'd of the Box of Cloaths, and afterwards I went to the <HI>Cock Alehouse,</HI> in <HI>High-Street,</HI> and after sometime Drinking, I fell into Discourse with a <HI>Laceman</HI> about Travelling, till the <HI>Laceman</HI> told me he was going to <HI>Amsbury</HI> Fair, in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> I told him I was going that Way too, so at Night, when we got to <HI>Amsbury,</HI> and put up our Horses, at the Sign of the <HI>Chopping-Knife,</HI> at one Mr. <HI>Hedges</HI>'s, from whence the <HI>Lace∣man</HI> went out to take a Standing for to sell his Goods in; and the while he was gone, I went to the <HI>Landlord,</HI> and asked him for my Partner's Box of Lace, and he gave it to me, and I went to the <HI>Hostler,</HI> and got my
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
Horse, and away I went, and left the <HI>Land∣lord</HI> and the <HI>Laceman</HI> to agree.</P>
<P>The next I met with, a bonny <HI>Scot,</HI> tra∣velling over the Plain, going towards the <HI>De∣vizes,</HI> and I said, well over-taken Mr. <HI>John∣son,</HI> and he said, <HI>How Mon, how done you,</HI> but he did not know me, but I knew him, so asked him if he had any good Handker∣chiefs, and said Yea, he put down his Pack, and opened it, and showed me several Sorts of Goods, among which I saw a large Quan∣tity of Hair, which is a good Commodity; so I said to my Friend <HI>Johnson, that I did not want to buy any Thing of him, for I must have them for nothing</HI>; but he began to make Words about that, and was going to be <HI>obstropolous,</HI> till I shew'd him the Pistols; and then he begged very heartily not for to use him ill, and take all that he had, upon which I took him about forty Yards from his Pack, and there tied him to the Post of a Well, and then went and searched the Pack all over, and found therein nine Pounds odd Money, and a great Parcel of Hair, as much as I sold at <HI>Marlborough</HI> for eight Pounds. I also took six Dozen of Handkerchiefs, and a Quantity of Muslin, all that was light Carriage; and when I had took as much as I thought proper, I went and released the <HI>Scotchman</HI> from the Well, that he might take Care of his Pack again, and then I took my
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
Leave of Mr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> and he paid his Re∣spects in a very handsome Manner, but it was more out of <HI>Fear,</HI> than <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>After I had parted from the <HI>Scotchman,</HI> I met with a jolly Shepherd, that had been at a Place call'd <HI>Burfet-Fair</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and had sold a Quantity of Sheep for his Master, but that was a Mistake of mine, to say, that he sold them for his Master, <HI>I should rather have said, he had sold them for me</HI>; for I met him at a Place call'd <HI>Humington,</HI> about two Miles from the <HI>Fair,</HI> where he sold the Sheep, and there I attack'd him, but he was a good old Fellow, for before he would part with his Money, he would have a Duel; I was loth to kill him, because he was a brave Fellow, so I fought him with my Hanger, till the old Fellow yielded, and then I rifled him all over, and took from him seventy odd Pounds, which he had receiv'd for the Sheep, upon which he said, that if he had had his <HI>Crook,</HI> he would not a Lost his Money without he had been kill'd; but as I have not my Weapon, says he, I must submit, and so he went homewards about his Business. After which I went away about mine also, to a Place call'd <HI>Dortchester,</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and there I stay'd till best Part of my Money was wasted, where I took up with a broken <HI>But∣cher</HI> to be my Companion, but I was dubi∣ous of him, for fear that his Heart should
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
fail him, but it did not, for he proved to be a good Fellow, and so we agreed very well together, for some Time, till he began to sink some of the Monies out of our Stock; but I found him out, and told him of it, and he owned it, but said he never would do so no more, and so we agreed and went on together.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Butcher</HI> and I went to a Place call'd <HI>Woodbury-Hill-Fair,</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and there we tarry'd till the Fair was over, and then our Fair began. We attack'd a Man that had been selling of Cheeses, but he had but a small Matter of Money about him, for he had paid it away, for we see him receive above fourscore Pounds; but when we came to search him, he had not above twelve Pounds about him; on which we fell a <HI>Cur∣sing</HI> our hard Fortune, and we gave him four or five good Licks with our Whips, <HI>and bid him never pay Money away when Gen∣tlemen waited to receive it</HI>; but the old Man went homewards very heavy Hearted as it was, we did not take above twelve Pound from him, which was but a small Trifle to what we expected; and so we left the honest <HI>Chees∣man.</HI></P>
<P>The next was an honest <HI>Hop-Merchant,</HI> who answer'd our Expectation very well, but we may thank his Wife for our Booty, for when we begun to search him, we did not find any
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
Money about him, till we began to Curse and Swear, and said we would kill him, and then the good Wife cry'd out, do not kill him, and I will tell you where the Money is; so I ask'd her, and she said, it was in his Boots, upon which I took my Knife out of my Pocket and cut his Boots off of his Legs, and there found in his Boots fifty Guineas, which I liked the Looks of very well; so I took and put them in my Pocket, and we went smiling away about our Business; returning Thanks to the good Woman for our Booty.</P>
<P>From thence I and my Friend went away together from <HI>Woodbury-Hill,</HI> to a Place call'd <HI>Sherbourn,</HI> and there we staid and took our Pleasure for some Time, and we got each of us a fine Lass to divert us by the way, so we staid and enjoy'd our selves as well as we could for some Time, when we had Informa∣tion of a <HI>Grasier</HI> going further down into the Country to buy some lean Beast to fatten; upon which we went after him and robb'd him of all the Money he had, which was fourscore and ten Pounds; with which we diverted our selves, and came back again in hopes of more Business, and went to a place call'd <HI>Ringwood</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> and there my Friend happened to fall sick, and lay for some Time, till that Money was almost consumed; and then grow∣ing pretty well again, I took him down to the <HI>Bath</HI> with me, where we staid about six Weeks,
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
and then we fell to work again, and robb'd the Stage Coaches going from <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>London</HI>; and took them as they came back again from <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and continued that Practice till they were oblig'd to hire People to guard the Coach to and fro, as it passed from <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>Bath</HI>: We robb'd the Stage for six Weeks together, as it passed to and fro every Time; but once we were like to receive Damage by a Gentle∣man in the Coach, for as we went up to de∣mand the Money, the Gentleman fired a Blun∣derbuss at us, but miss'd us both; however, we robb'd them afterwards, and well Horse∣whipp'd the Gentleman for his Reward, and then we came away about other Business of the like Nature.</P>
<P>The next Adventure was at a Place call'd <HI>Hungerford,</HI> and there we staid for two Months, where I made up a Match for my Friend to be marry'd to a Widow Woman, one of his own Trade; so we liv'd very well there, till such time we were blow'd by somebody that knew us, and was very near being taken, but by good Conduct we got away safe, and came to <HI>Newberry,</HI> which was not a great ways from the Place where we was put to the Rout; that did not put any stop to our Proceedings, we met with a <HI>Tallow-Chandler,</HI> not far from <HI>New∣berry,</HI> and we robbed him of what he had; then we concluded to go and see one of the Wonders of
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
the Country, a Place called <HI>Stoneage,</HI> where we staid about three or four Days, and then we concluded to make our way further from our Enemies, and agreed to come to <HI>London,</HI> which accordingly we did, and proceeded on our Journey till we came to <HI>Reading,</HI> and there we was like to be taken again by the <HI>Bath</HI> Stage Coachman; but I and my Friend were pretty well mounted, and by good Luck got away, and rode that Night, and the next Day, from <HI>Reading</HI> to <HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and there we were safe; so we remained there a∣bout three Weeks; but being very uneasy in our Minds, for fear we should be taken, we agreed to part by Consent, and accordingly we did; and he went back to <HI>Dorchester</HI> again, and I set out for <HI>Salisbury</HI> to see my Friends, and staid there about a Week: After which I set out again for <HI>London</HI> once more, by a round about way, and in coming to <HI>London,</HI> I met with four young Sparks who were going for <HI>Oxford,</HI> but the merry Joke was, that after I had attack'd and had search'd them, I could not find any Money about two of them, but the other two I had rifled, and took from them their Money and Watches, and was riding away therewith; they called to me, and told me that their Companions had Money about them, so I went to Work again, and at last I found Money upon one of them, planted under the Buttons of his Coat, and eas'd him
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
of ten Guineas I found there; his Watch he had convey'd into his Cod-piece, but happening to find it there I made bold to keep it: The other had his Money planted in the Cape of his Coat that goes round his Collar, and his Watch he had convey'd to one of his Compa∣nions, but being willing that they should be serv'd all alike, he held the Watch in his Hand, with the Chain hanging down, that I might see it, which I did, and took it from him, and then they could not laugh one at another, for I am sure they had no Occasion, because they were serv'd all alike. I have laugh'd at the Fancy many Times, to think of their telling of the others having Money about them; but I did not like them never the worse when I heard them speak of it, be∣cause when I found it, I did not grudge my Time of looking for it, otherwise I should have thought much of my Time, so I took my Leave of them and came my ways for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to <HI>London,</HI> I liv'd very ho∣nest, and went to Work Journey-work at my Trade, and Lodg'd at one Mr. <HI>Rickets</HI> a Shoe-maker in <HI>Harp-Alley, Shoe-Lane,</HI> and there Work'd for about Six Months, for Mr. <HI>Holliday,</HI> Shoe-maker upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI>; and from thence I moved into <HI>Leather-Lane</HI> in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> and there I Work'd almost Twelve∣months; till at last I took up with a Harlot of the Town; I had not kept her Company
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
more then six Days, but she was Arrested and carried to the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> and the next Day I got her Bail'd out, and then they Arrested her in the <HI>Borough-Court,</HI> and I Bail'd her again, and brought her home with me to one Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s a Shoe-maker, in <HI>Three-Leg-Alley</HI> near <HI>Fetter-Lane</HI>; but all this while, this was to make a Mouth of me, and to take me in for some ready Money, but I had none then, but I had a Legacy of Ten Pounds a Year in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and they were persuading me to sell it; and at last I went to the <HI>Ex∣change,</HI> and to the Jobbers for that purpose, but I could not agree with them for it, so at last I sold it to one Mr. <HI>Littlefield,</HI> a Car∣penter, in St. <HI>Paul's Church-Yard,</HI> and he gave me Fourscore Pounds for it; and then my Mistress was pleas'd, for there was a great Score to the Landlord for Rent, and he Swore and Damn'd that he would send her to the <HI>Marshalsea</HI> again if he had not his Money; that was to make me the more fon∣der of the Froe, but I Paid them nothing at that time, but I took her out a long with me into <HI>Monmouth-street,</HI> and there I bought her a suit of blue Flower'd Sattin Cloaths, and every thing else that was agreeable to ware with them; and then we came home again, and the House was like a Mad House for Money, there was G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>m your Blood you B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>h, must you have such fine

let us take a walk and see Mrs. <HI>Shelton,</HI> and there we shall see my Sister; so away we goes, and when we came to Mrs. <HI>Shelton</HI>'s, the first Compliment was, Pray Mr. <HI>Dyer,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Dyer,</HI> how do you both do, you was the last People that my <HI>Tom</HI> and I was talking about, we was talking about that small mat∣ter that your Spouse owes us, Pray said I, how much is it? but two and forty Shillings, well I put my Hand in my Pocket and Paid him, and took a Receipt.</P>
<P>Some short Time after this Transaction, another Woman and she fell out, one of her fellow Trade, and one that knew her Secrets, and then she told me that there was no Mo∣ney due to Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> when I paid him the five Guineas, nor there was none due to Mrs. <HI>Shelton,</HI> but that she wanted the Money in her own Pocket, for she thought she would make Hay while the Sun shone. Well this passed on for some Time, and I took no far∣ther notice about it at all, but soon after that her Husband came from Sea, and came and knock'd at the Door one Morning about four o'Clock, and asked if one Mrs. <HI>Davis</HI> did not live there, and I told him yes. I did not know that she had a Husband before, for I took it for one of her Culls, till she look'd out of the Window, and then she said, my Dear <HI>Johnny</HI> it is my Husband, what shall I do; so I put my Cloaths on, and came down
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
one pair of Stairs and went to Bed to another Harlot, and there lay till Madam and her Husband came down Stairs; so I went away about my Business, and came home at twelve a Clock, and my Brother was gone Aboard a Ship, but he came home at Night and de∣priv'd me of my Bed-fellow; but the Cream of the Jest was, that my Madam sham'd Jealous of the Woman that I went to Bed to, but she was not Jealous of me, but of my Money. But however, somebody had let her Husband know that I kept her Company, but he took no notice of me, but he Curs'd and Swore every time he saw me; but in short, he Ar∣rested me, and put me into the <HI>Compter,</HI> and I got Bail'd out again, and then I Arrested him for Meat, Drink, and Lodging for his Wife, and I put him into the <HI>Compter,</HI> and there he remain'd a great while, till at last he sent for me to come to him, which I did; so we came to an agreement, he gave me a Note of Ten Pounds, and I let him out, and have not seen him never since, so farewel, Brother Tar. Soon after that, I was Married to an honest Woman, and then I took a <HI>Coblers∣Stall</HI> in <HI>Leather-lane,</HI> and liv'd very well if I could have been contented, but I was like a great many more young Men, did not love Work; but presently after that I had taken this Stall, a young Man in the Neighbour∣hood that was a little low in the World, and
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
wanted Money, but did not know how to get any, open'd his mind to me one Night as we was a walking in the Fields; and said he must go upon the Highway, or else he must go to Prison; so I asked him if ever he did any such thing? he said no; and I asked him if he had any Pistols, he said no, but he would Pledge his Watch and buy a Pair, and accordingly he did; and he and I went out one Night together, and at the old <HI>Spaw</HI> we stop'd a Man and Rob'd him of his Watch and two Rings and what Money he had, which was not much, it was about 7 or 8 <HI>s.</HI> in Silver; and from thence we went farther into the Fields, and by <HI>Sadlers-Wells</HI> we rob'd another Gentleman of his Watch and one Cypher Ring with a Heart in it, and a pair of Silver Buckles, his Hat and Wig, and then we ty'd his Hands and Legs and came away and left him. My Companion thought that was a good and quick way to get Money, therefore he liked it so well, that he kept to it; so the next time that we went out, we had better Success than we had before, for we stop'd a Gentleman's Chariot up by <HI>Pancras-wash,</HI> and robb'd the Gentle∣man and his Lady, to the Value of 30 <HI>l.</HI> in Goods and Money, and so we came home.</P>
<P>Soon after which my Friend and I met one Mr. <HI>Lewen,</HI> the late City <HI>Marshal,</HI> and robb'd him to the Sum of near eight Pounds, in <HI>Horn∣sey-Lane,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
going towards <HI>Muzzle-Hill,</HI> and got safe away. The same Night we robb'd two more Men near <HI>Pancras</HI> Church, of about four or five Pounds, and being Weary we came home that Night. The next Engagement was in the <HI>Strand,</HI> where we stopp'd a Hackney Coach, and rifled the Men all over, but to a very little Purpose. And from thence we went to <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> and there we pick'd up a <HI>Molley,</HI> and carry'd him to one Corner of the Rails, and we took from him a silver Watch, and about fifteen Shillings in Money, but the <HI>Molleying-Bitch</HI> had a Goose with him, which we made bold to take with us, and we had it roasted the next Day for Dinner, and made our selves very Merry over it. The next was a merry Frolick which happen'd in <HI>Lin∣coln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Fields</HI>: I and my Consort one Night set upon a Man in <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Fields,</HI> and robb'd him, and he went about his Business as we thought; but we staid there for some Time after we robb'd him, we were surrounded with fifteen or sixteen Watchmen; they came in all four Ways upon us, that we did not know very well what to do, but being both of a Mind, to be kill'd before we would be taken, so the Watchmen at last gather'd themselves near together, and were coming to look for us we did suppose, but we did not give them the Trouble, for we went and met them, and came as nigh them as we thought
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
might without danger of hurting them, and then we fired three Pistols at them, and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards if you would have given a Hundred Pound for a Watchman you could not see one in the Fields, for hap∣py was he that could run fastest.</P>
<P>I hope I shall not be thought tedious in gi∣ving this true and plain Account how I fell from the Paths of Virtue, and a sober Religious Life in which my Dear Parents took great care to have render'd me an honest Man; I do not boast of my Sins, nor believe there is any real satisfaction in the doing what is ill, con∣trary to the Laws of God and Man: I hum∣bly take shame to my self, and do affirm that the foregoing <HI>Narrative</HI> is in every part true; I only rehearse it to warn young Men especi∣ally to take notice by what degrees I fell into these Crimes, so that they may by the Pru∣dent use of God's Grace, be preserved from Iniquities: I have shewn how Masters may be wronged by their Servants, who follow such Vices as I own I have done, as well as to caution against the sad consequences of conversing with lewd Women, and as what I have already said was Principally done in the Country. I shall now proceed plainly and briefly as I can, to shew what Company and more pernicious Adventures I have more late∣ly been engag'd in, which has brought me to many dangerous Misfortunes, and render'd me liable to be Prosecuted, even by my vile
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Companions, whom often draw'd me into this Snare, but as a <HI>Land-mark,</HI> serves to warn the careful <HI>Marriner</HI> of Danger, so I propose in the remaining Part of this <HI>Narra∣tive,</HI> impartially to Discover such bold daring Dangers, and vile Attempts, as may secure ho∣nest Men from Danger for the future; which may in some means convince the World of my sincere Repentance: I shall only beg leave to trouble my Reader, with two or three petty Accounts of my Actions, that I may thereby render the most weighty Matters contained in the following Pages clear, and of Use to those who are so kind to read them.</P>
<P>Some little Time after our Escape in <HI>Lin∣coln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Fields</HI> before mention'd; I and my Fellowmen robb'd a Gentleman and a Woman at <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> corner in a Hackney Coach, of a silver Watch, Snuff Box, and about four or five Pounds in Money, and a small Cypher Ring, the Value of it was not very much, but they was very desiring not to part with it, which made us the more eager to keep it; but we told the People <HI>that if it was not a Diamond one, they should have it again, if they would let us know their Names, and where to direct for them, they should have it again</HI>; (upon Honour) and accordingly we sent it to them to the <HI>Devil-Tavern</HI> at <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> in a Penny-Post Letter, for it was no Service to us.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="27"/>
Some small time after, we met a <HI>Clergyman</HI> near the same Place, where we Robbed him of all his Money, Watch, Hat and Wig, and so came Home for that Night.</P>
<P>The next Prank we play'd was at <HI>Hollow∣way,</HI> going to <HI>Highgate,</HI> and there we Robbed the <HI>Barnet</HI> Stage Coach; there was but two Passengers in the Coach, and we Rifled them both, but they had but a small quantity of Money about them, not above thirty Shillings between them; we stay'd there about all Night till Morning, and met with the <HI>Hog∣Butchers</HI> going to <HI>Finchley</HI> to buy <HI>Hogs,</HI> but I believe it prevented their Journey, for they were oblig'd to go back again to fetch more Money before they could proceed on their Journey; for we took from them between forty and fifty Pounds, and came away about our Business; <HI>but I fear they were oblig'd to sell Bacon very dear to fetch up their Money we took from them.</HI></P>
<P>The next was an honest <HI>Baker</HI> (if a <HI>Baker</HI> can be so) that we met coming from <HI>Hamp∣stead,</HI> but he was very much in Liquor, and which oblig'd us to tye his Hands and Feet before we could do any thing with him, and then we rifled him of twenty-five Pounds, a Silver Watch and two plain Rings, and left him in the Fields.</P>
<P>We next met with a <HI>Hackney-Coach</HI> coming from <HI>Hampstead,</HI> with two <HI>Taylors</HI> and a Wo∣man
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
in it, we pull'd the <HI>Taylors</HI> out of the Coach to Search them, and then we handed their Lady out and rifled her also, but she was worth both the <HI>Taylors,</HI> for she had a very handsome Gold Chain about her Neck, and two good Rings on her Fingers, and a <HI>Spanker</HI> in her Pocket, and Seven or Eight Shillings in Silver, but the two poor <HI>Taylors</HI> not above four Shillings between them; so we bid the Coachman drive on, and I gave him half a Crown <HI>and bid him say nothing</HI>; but when they came to <HI>Tottenham-Court</HI> Turn-Pyke, the Coachman begun to cry out, <HI>Thieves and Rogues on the Road</HI>; but he little thought that we was so nigh them, for we heard every Word they said, and so they went on about their Business, but the Coachman had better to have held his Tongue, and then he might have got home Safe, <HI>but he fared well, and cry'd Roast-meat</HI>; upon which as soon as he had pass'd the Turn-Pyke we stop'd him and took the half Crown from him, that we had before given him, and twelve Shillings to boot, and made him go about his Business, which we said would <HI>teach the Fool more Wit another Time.</HI></P>
<P>In an other Adventure, I and my Compa∣nion undertook to rob the <HI>Salisbury</HI> Waggon, at <HI>Knightsbridge</HI>; there prov'd to be but one Passenger in it, who was a Country Fellow, and going into the Country; he had but a
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
small Store of Money about him, and was very loth to part with it, but we frighted him into a Compliance, and left him Penny∣less, all he had was twelve Shillings and Six-pence. We had not Time, nor proper Opportunity, to take out any Boxes, it be∣ing so near the Town, and People passing hard-by, who probably saw what we were Doing; but they, and the Waggoners, find∣ing our being armed with several Pistols, made free Way for our Escapes.</P>
<P>The same Day we took a Tour to <HI>Black∣heath,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> where we met with a Gen∣tleman on Horseback, well mounted; my Partner suddenly took hold of his Horse, whilst I surprized the Gentleman, laying hold of him, presented my Pistol to his Breast, cock'd and prim'd, swearing, [<HI>The Lord in Mercy pardon me,</HI>] <HI>that I would shoot him im∣mediately, if he did not instantly, without any Delay, or making any Noise, deliver what he had</HI>; and we took from him fourteen Shil∣lings in Money, and a handsome silver Watch, cutting his Stirrups, and Horse's Bridle, we left him unmounted, not imagi∣ning he could, or would attempt to follow after us; but unexpectedly, the enraged Gen∣tleman mended the broken Bridle, that he mounted again, and pursu'd us with more <HI>Rashness</HI> than with <HI>Prudence,</HI> for his own <HI>Safety</HI>; for he pursu'd us with so great Hast,
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
that he forced us to attack him, in our own Defence, whilst we ran over the Common; whereas, had he sliely followed us, as he might have done, we having not the least Apprehension of his being mounted, he might have easily apprehended us, when he had found us in a conveniently Place, where he might have had Assistance; but he, as I said before, attack'd us by himself, that we were forced to unhorse him again, to give him <HI>Blows</HI> for his <HI>Blows,</HI> and then, to bind him to strick Obedience of our Pleasure. <HI>viz. To lie quiet until we were out of Sight</HI>; and to speak the Truth, we left him secure, until some might come to relieve him; and for his Horse, we quite demolished his Furniture, and turned him loose, and by this Means got free from one of the most refractory Chaps I ever met with; in a Word, he acted as a Person <HI>drunk</HI> or <HI>mad.</HI></P>
<P>We took our Way by <HI>Peckham</HI> to <HI>Lam∣beth,</HI> and so over the Ferry, and so Home, to spend the sad Fruits of our abominable Labour; and shortly after, as our Wants required, we took a Journey to <HI>Epping-Fo∣rest,</HI> where looking for our Prey, we met with a Gentleman and his Lady in a Chaise; we civilly accost them, in our Way, desiring them, <HI>To supply our Want of Money,</HI> which we hoped they could conveniently spare; which they being unwilling to do, we took
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
the Boldness to oblige them to alight, and shewing our Pistols, the Fear of Death com∣pelled them to submit to be search'd, and we found five Guineas and some Silver, and a silver Watch from the Gentleman, and a Ring and silver Snuff-Box from the Lady, who we used with great Tenderness, obser∣ving that she was in a great Fright, inso∣much, that they freely forgave us, and would never prosecute us, if it should be in their Power, and so we parted with great Curtesy. This Booty served us a little while, but we quickly <HI>turned out</HI> again, chu∣sing to change our Horses, Apparel, Wigs, and every Thing that was remarkable about us.</P>
<P>The next Attempt we made, was on <HI>Hat∣field</HI> Common, were we met a <HI>Tallow-Chand∣ler</HI> coming from <HI>Ware,</HI> who was well moun∣ted, and somewhat obstinate; however, we took from him eleven Guineas, and about seven or eight Shillings in Silver; we left him unhors'd, and made the best and surest Way we could back to Town. Immediately after we met a Gentleman very drunk, on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> of whom we took five Pounds in Silver, his Hat and Wig, after he had been very rustical and fought with us. We were forced to prevent his Clamour and Noise, for he began to cry out aloud for Help; but we left him on the Ground, and took pru∣dently
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
to our Heels. The same Morning we made our Way Home by <HI>Doctors-Commons, where we desir'd a Gentleman to speak with us,</HI> and telling him our Business, <HI>was wanting Money,</HI> we begged that he would spare what he had about him; the Gentleman was great∣ly surpriz'd seeing our Commission, a Pistol, begged of us <HI>not to kill him,</HI> I said, <HI>no Sir, We will not hurt your Body, it's your Money we want, and that we must, and will have</HI>; we were forced to rifle him, and took about thirty five Shillings; he did (<HI>stage much</HI>) that is our <HI>Cant</HI> Word for <HI>crying out</HI>; so we left him, and found no Manner of Annoy∣ance from the Watchmen, or otherwise.</P>
<P>Coming to <HI>Fleet-Ditch,</HI> in <HI>Harp Alley,</HI> we met with a Person, who for some Reasons I believe was a <HI>Grocer,</HI> he was surprized and stopt by us, we took from him fourteen Shil∣lings, a Watch, and a Cane, which he was pretty easy to part withal, after we had put him into a trembling Fit. A few Days after we and our <HI>Doxies</HI> having consumed the Pro∣duct of our ill-gotten Pelf, we turned into <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Lane,</HI> in our common Road, like Birds of Prey, and there we met with one of the Disturbers of <HI>Human Society,</HI> I mean a <HI>Petty Fogging Lawyer</HI> (as he call'd himself) who upon our attacking him, told us his Em∣ploy, and would argue with us, with the Con∣sideration of the great Danger we should bring
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
upon ourselves, by provoking a Person of his Knowledge; how to find us out he knew ma∣ny <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Highwaymen</HI>; some had been his <HI>Clients,</HI> and as for the <HI>Thief-Takers</HI> he knew all, in or about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI> We had dragg'd him, partly by Force, and gentle Persuasions, to a convenient dark silent Place under the Walls, and found him so Di∣verting, that I desired my Partners to let him go; but one of them had felt his Pocket, and said there was <HI>Swag</HI> in it, and obliged me to consent that he might rifle his Pocket, where they found Thirty odd Shillings, and one of them took his Sword, gilt Handle, of little Value; the poor Gentleman was obliged to submit, and has since made a most sad Com∣plaint, to some of my Acquaintance, who assures me, that he pretended in <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn,</HI> to have lost a great Sum of his Clients Money. We left him in a quiet Temper, and much I fear some Thieves as well as honest Men, have dearly paid for this Robbery, which was done very lately in the last long Vacation.</P>
<P>Another very late Crime I committed with my Companion, was on a <HI>Victualler,</HI> who ha∣ving been Merry with his Friends abroad, was reeling over <HI>Bloomsbury-Market,</HI> betwixt One and Two in the Morning; we attack'd him, and he pleasantly asked, <HI>What we meant, what we wanted</HI>; our Reply was still the Same▪ <HI>We were Men of Fortune, and Money</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
<HI>was our Game.</HI> We had no Time, the Place would not admit of a long Dispute, we flung him down, stopp'd his Mouth, (not to hurt him) then took from a silver Watch, Seventeen Shillings in Money, two plain Rings, and his Buckles out of his Shoes, and so <HI>wish'd him better For∣tune for the Future.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards in <HI>Tottenham Court Road,</HI> we met with a Man coming to Town, we seized him by Surprize and took from him Forty∣four Shillings, and the Man was as Joyful to be rid of our Company, as we were to be free from him: I prevented his being stripp'd of his Cloaths, for I ever abhorr'd to leave any Person naked, or to offer any Violence to modest Women, but have often restrained the rude and cruel Behaviour of my unhap∣py Acquaintance, when such Attempts have been designed.</P>
<P>Another late Exploit was returning to <HI>Chel∣sea</HI> Road, where we met with two <HI>Gardiners,</HI> coming Drunk from Market, they prov'd very Troublesome a-while, but we were too Strong for them, and our usual Arms a∣frighted them to a Compliance, so we took 12 <HI>s.</HI> from them, and they having warm great Coats, and my Companions wanting them, took the Freedom to take them, and tied them Back to Back, disabling them from pursuing us. In the long Field we robb'd Mr. <HI>Homes,</HI> commonly call'd Lord <HI>Homes,</HI> a Clerk at <HI>Chel∣sea,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
he had a Guinea and a Steel Seal, which was all he had about him, but the Patrole coming that way, which we were aware off, we made our Escape with great Precipitation. Other Crimes we committed, and laid wait to do, to the Prejudice of great Men, and par∣ticular private Families, which may not in the Reading be unacceptable to the Reader.</P>
<P>I not long ago meet with a Person of some distinction well known in this Town of the sordid vile Company of <HI>Sodamites</HI> [I was clean drest and look'd fresh] in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn Fields,</HI> he pretended after several times turn∣ing and looking hard at me to know me, and desired me as I went along to go and drink a Glass of Wine with him at a Tavern, which I consented to do, and he going to the Draw∣er desired a good Room up Stairs, who car∣ried us into a Room next the Street, which happen'd luckily to my purpose; for this Gentleman (who is in Years) was very amo∣rous upon me, and would by all means treat me with a Fowl or any thing I could Eat, which was order'd accordingly, and whilst it was getting ready, he took a Diamond Ring from his Finger, saying it was a rich Stone; I begg'd the Favour to see if my Finger was not bigger then his, which he granted, and presently after I had it on, I being near the Window and seeing a Coach going by, I call'd out stop Coach, pretending I had a Friend in
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
the Coach that I wanted to Speak with; I ran down Stairs, and so went off with the Ring. I shortly after met the same Gentleman under the great Arch in <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Fields,</HI> who in a Surpize told me he wondered that I carried away his Ring, I gave him a surley Answer, and so he went quietly away.</P>
<P>A <HI>Whipmaker's</HI> House in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> we broke open, and took a quantity of Whips from him one <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, and we came away safe.</P>
<P>The next was a <HI>Shoemaker's</HI> Shop in <HI>Wild∣Court</HI> near <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and there I and my Companions, took away all the Shoes the Man had in his Shop, and likewise came off safe that Night.</P>
<P>I am my Companion had a mind for a hol∣low Bit, so we open'd a <HI>Poulterer's</HI> Shop in <HI>Clare-Market,</HI> (with a false Key) and took a dozen of Chickens, and two Turkeys for our Selves and Doxies, just for our own Spend∣ing; for soon after one of our Doxies lay-in, and with the help of those Chickens and two Turkeys, we made a grand Christening, were we had some of our own Fraternity and Dox∣ies; but my Companion and I never had the good Manners to Invite the <HI>Poulterer</HI> and his Wife.</P>
<P>Not long since we met a Man in <HI>Kirby∣street</HI> near <HI>Hatton-Garden,</HI> and we knock'd him down, and Robb'd him of his Hat and
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
Whig, and that was all, for we were disturb∣ed from doing any more, for the Watch came and Surrounded us, that we was oblig'd to Fire before we could get away, but by good Luck we got off Safe.</P>
<P>Then we broke open a <HI>Linnen Draper's</HI> Shop at the Sign of the <HI>Maiden-Head</HI> in <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> there we took a great Quantity of Linnen, as much as two of us could well bring away, and came off with it, without being Discover'd.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The two last Robberies I was Capi∣tally Convicted for at the last Sessions, at the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> and am to Suffer To-morrow, at <HI>Tyburn</HI> for them.</P>
