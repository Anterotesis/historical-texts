<LG>
<L>IF dying EXCELLENCE deserves a Tear,</L>
<L>If fond Remembrance still is cherished here,</L>
<L>Can we persist to bid your Sorrows flow.</L>
<L>For fabled Suffe'rers, and delusive Woe?</L>
<L>Or with quaint Smiles dismiss the plaintive Strain,</L>
<L>Point the quick Jest—indulge the Comic Vein—</L>
<L>Ere yet to buried ROSCIUS we assign—</L>
<L>One kind Regret—one tributary Line!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Fame requires we act a tenderer Part:—</L>
<L>His MEMORY claims the Tear you gave his ART!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>The general Voice, the Meed of mournful Verse,</L>
<L>The splendid Sorrows that adorned his Hearse,</L>
<L>The Throng that mourn'd as their dead Favourite pass'd,</L>
<L>The grac'd Respect that claim'd him to the last,</L>
<L>While SHAKESPEAR'S Image from its hallow'd Base,</L>
<L>Seem'd to prescribe the Grave, and point the Place,—</L>
<L>Nor these,—nor all the sad Regrets that flow</L>
<L>From fond Fidelity's domestic Woe,—</L>
<L>So much are GARRICK'S Praise—so much his DUE—</L>
<L>As on this Spot—One Tear bestow'd by YOU.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amid the Arts which seek ingenuous Fame,</L>
<L>OUR toil attempts the most precarious Claim!</L>
<L>To HIM, whose mimic Pencil wins the Prize,</L>
<L>Obedient Fame immortal Wreaths supplies:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Whate'er of Wonder REYNOLDS now may raise,</L>
<L>RAPHAEL still boasts cotemporary Praise:</L>
<L>Each dazling Light, and gaudier Bloom subdu'd,</L>
<L>With undiminish'd Awe HIS Works are view'd:</L>
<L>E'en Beauty's Portrait wears a softer Prime,</L>
<L>Touch'd by the tender Hand of mellowing Time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The patient SCULPTOR owns an humbler Part,</L>
<L>A ruder Toil, and more mechanic Art;</L>
<L>Content with slow and timorous Stroke to trace</L>
<L>The lingering Line, and mould the tardy Grace:</L>
<L>But once atchieved—tho' barbarous Wreck o'erthrow</L>
<L>The sacred Fane, and lay its Glories low,</L>
<L>Yet shall the sculptur'd Ruin rise to Day,</L>
<L>Grac'd by Defect, and worship'd in Decay;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
The' enduring Record bears the Artist's Name,</L>
<L>Demands his Honors, and asserts his Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Superior Hopes the POET'S Bosom fire,—</L>
<L>O proud Distinction of the sacred Lyre!—</L>
<L>Wide as the' inspiring PHOEBUS darts his Ray,</L>
<L>Diffusive Splendor gilds his VOTARY'S Lay.</L>
<L>Whether the Song Heroic Woes rehearse,</L>
<L>With Epic Grandeur, and the Pomp of Verse;</L>
<L>Or, fondly gay, with unambitious Guile</L>
<L>Attempt no Prize but favouring Beauty's Smile;</L>
<L>Or bear dejected to the lonely Grove</L>
<L>The soft Despair of unprevailing Love,—</L>
<L>Whate'er the Theme—thro' every Age and Clime</L>
<L>Congenial Passions meet the' according Rhyme;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
The Pride of Glory—Pity's Sigh sincere—</L>
<L>Youth's earliest Blush—and Beauty's Virgin Tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is THEIR Meed—THEIR Honors thus secure,</L>
<L>Whose Arts yield Objects, and whose Works endure.</L>
<L>The ACTOR only, shrinks from Times Award;</L>
<L>Feeble Tradition is HIS Memory's Guard;</L>
<L>By whose faint Breath his Merits must abide,</L>
<L>Unvouch'd by Proof—to Substance unallied!</L>
<L>Ev'n matchless GARRICK'S Art to Heav'n resign'd,</L>
<L>No fix'd Effect, no Model leaves behind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The GRACE of ACTION—the adapted MIEN</L>
<L>Faithful as Nature to the varied Scene;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Th' EXPRESSIVE GLANCE—whose subtle Comment draws</L>
<L>Entranc'd Attention, and a mute Applause;</L>
<L>GESTURE that marks, with Force and Feeling fraught,</L>
<L>A Sense in Silence, and a Will in Thought;</L>
<L>HARMONIOUS SPEECH, whose pure and liquid Tone</L>
<L>Gives Verse a Music, scarce confess'd its own;</L>
<L>As Light from Gems, assumes a brighter Ray</L>
<L>And cloathed with Orient Hues, transcends the Day!—</L>
<L>PASSION'S wild Break—and FROWN that awes the Sense,</L>
<L>And every CHARM of gentler ELOQUENCE—</L>
<L>All perishable!—like the' Electric Fire</L>
<L>But strike the Frame—and as they strike expire;</L>
<L>Incense too pure a bodied Flame to bear,</L>
<L>It's Fragrance charms the Sense, and blends with Air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<L>WHERE then—while sunk in cold Decay he lies,</L>
<L>And pale Eclipse for ever veils those Eyes!—</L>
<L>WHERE is the blest Memorial that ensures</L>
<L>Our GARRICK'S Fame?—whose is the Trust?—'tis YOURS.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And O! by every Charm his Art essay'd</L>
<L>To sooth your Cares!—by every Grief allay'd!</L>
<L>By the hush'd Wonder which his Accents drew!</L>
<L>By his last parting Tear, repaid by you!</L>
<L>By all those Thoughts, which many a distant Night,</L>
<L>Shall mark his Memory with a sad Delight!—</L>
<L>Still in your Heart's dear Record bear his Name;</L>
<L>Cherish the keen Regret that lifts his Fame;</L>
<L>To YOU it is bequeath'd, assert the Trust,</L>
<L>And to his WORTH—'tis all you can—be JUST.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<L>What more is due from sanctifying Time,</L>
<L>To chearful WIT, and many a favour'd RHYME,</L>
<L>O'er his grac'd Urn shall bloom, a deathless Wreath,</L>
<L>Whose blossom'd Sweets shall deck the Mask beneath.</L>
<L>For these,—when SCULPTURE'S votive Toil shall rear</L>
<L>The due Memorial of a Loss so dear!—</L>
<L>O lovliest Mourner, Gentle MUSE! be thine</L>
<L>The pleasing Woe to guard the laurell'd Shrine.</L>
<L>As FANCY, oft by Superstition led</L>
<L>To roam the Mansions of the sainted Dead,</L>
<L>Has view'd, by shadowy Eve's unfaithful Gloom,</L>
<L>A weeping Cherub on a Martyr's Tomb—</L>
<L>So thou, sweet MUSE, hang o'er HIS sculptur'd Bier,</L>
<L>With patient Woe, that loves the lingering Tear;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
With Thoughts that mourn—nor yet desire Relief,</L>
<L>With meek Regret, and fond enduring Grief;</L>
<L>With Looks that speak—He never shall return!—</L>
<L>Chilling thy tender Bosom clasp his Urn;</L>
<L>And with soft Sighs disperse the' irreverend Dust,</L>
<L>Which TIME may strew upon his sacred Bust.</L>
