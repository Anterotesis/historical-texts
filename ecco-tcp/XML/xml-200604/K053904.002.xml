</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WRAPT in Olivia's veil, Ellena de∣scended
to the music-room, and min∣gled
with the nuns, who were assembled
within the grate. Among the monks
and pilgrims without it, were some stran∣gers
in the usual dress of the country,
but she did not perceive any person who
resembled Vivaldi; and she considered,
that, if he were present, he would not
venture to discover himself, while her nun's
veil concealed her as effectually from him
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
as from the lady Abbess. It would be ne∣cessary,
therefore, to seek an opportunity
of withdrawing it for a moment at the
grate, an expedient, which must certainly
expose her to the notice of strangers.</P>
<P>On the entrance of the lady Abbess,
Ellena's fear of observation rendered her in∣sensible
to every other consideration; she
fancied, that the eyes of the Superior were
particularly directed upon herself. The
veil seemed an insufficient protection from
their penetrating glances, and she almost
sunk with the terror of instant discovery.</P>
<P>The Abbess, however, passed on, and,
having conversed for a few moments with
the <HI>padre Abate</HI> and some visitors of dis∣tinction,
took her chair; and the per∣formance
immediately opened with one of
those solemn and impressive airs, which
the Italian nuns know how to give with so
much taste and sweetness. It rescued even
Ellena for a moment from a sense of dan∣ger,
and she resigned herself to the sur∣rounding
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
scene, of which the <HI>coup-d' oeil.</HI>
was striking and grand. In a vaulted
apartment of considerable extent, lighted
by innumerable tapers, and where even
the ornaments, though pompous, partook
of the solemn character of the institution,
were assembled about fifty nuns, who, in
the interesting habit of their order, ap∣peared
with graceful plainness. The deli∣cacy
of their air, and their beauty, softened
by the lawn that thinly veiled it, were con∣trasted
by the severe majesty of the lady
Abbess, who, seated on an elevated chair,
apart from the audience, seemed the Em∣press
of the scene, and by the venerable
figures of the father <HI>Abate</HI> and his attendant
monks, who were arranged without that
screen of wire-work, extending the whole
breadth of the apartment, which is called
the grate. Near the holy father were
placed the strangers of distinction, dressed
in the splendid Neapolitan habit, whose
gay colouring and airy elegance opposed
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
well with the dark drapery of the ecclesias∣tics;
their plumed hats loftily overtopping
the half-cowled heads and grey locks of the
monks. Nor was the contrast of counte∣nances
less striking; the grave, the austere,
the solemn, and the gloomy, intermingling
with the light, the blooming, and the de∣bonaire,
expressed all the various tempers,
that render life a blessing or a burden, and,
as with the spell of magic, transform this
world into a transient paradise or purgatory.
In the back ground of the picture stood
some pilgrims, with looks less joyous and
more demure than they had worn on the
road the preceding day; and among them
were some inferior brothers and attendants
of the convent. To this part of the cham∣ber
Ellena frequently directed her atten∣tion,
but did not distinguish Vivaldi; and,
though she had taken a station near the
grate, she had not courage indecorously
to withdraw her veil before so many stran∣gers.
And thus, if he even were in the
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
apartment, it was not probable he would
venture to come forward.</P>
<P>The concert concluded without his hav∣ing
been discovered by Ellena; and she
withdrew to the apartment, where the
collation was spread, and where the Abbess
and her guests soon after appeared. Pre∣sently,
she observed a stranger, in a pil∣grim's
habit, station himself near the grate;
his face was partly muffled in his cloak,
and he seemed to be a spectator rather than
a partaker of the feast.</P>
<P>Ellena, who understood this to be Vi∣valdi,
was watchful for an opportunity of
approaching, unseen by the Abbess; the
place where he had fixed himself. Engag∣ed
in conversation with the ladies around
her, the Superior soon favoured Ellena's
wish, who, having reached the grate, ven∣tured
to lift her veil for one instant. The
stranger, letting his cloak fall, thanked her
with his eyes for her condescension, and
she perceived, that he was not Vivaldi!
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Shocked at the interpretation, which might
be given to a conduct apparently so impro∣per,
as much as by the disappointment,
which Vivaldi's absence occasioned, she
was hastily retiring, when another stranger
approached with quick steps, whom she instantly
knew, by the grace and spirit of his
air, to be Vivaldi; but, determined not to
expose herself a second time to the possibi∣lity
of a mistake, she awaited for some fur∣ther
signal of his identity, before she dis∣covered
herself. His eyes were fixed upon
her in earnest attention for some moments,
before he drew aside the cloak from his face.
But he soon did so:—and it was▪ Vivaldi
himself.</P>
<P>Ellena, perceiving that she was known,
did not raise her veil, but advanced a few
steps towards the grate. Vivaldi there de∣posited
a small folded paper, and before
she could venture to deliver her own billet,
he had retired among the crowd. As she
stepped forward to secure his letter, she
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
observed a nun hastily approach the spot
where he had laid it, and she paused. The
garment of the Recluse wafted it from the
place where it had been partly concealed;
and when Ellena perceived the nun's foot
rest upon the paper, she with difficulty
disguised her apprehensions.</P>
<P>A friar, who from without the grate ad∣dressed
the sister, seemed with much ear∣nestness,
yet with a certain air of secresy,
communicating some important intelli∣gence.
The fears of Ellena suggested that
he had observed the action of Vivaldi, and
was making known his suspicions; and she
expected, every instant, to see the nun lift
up the paper, and deliver it to the Abbess.</P>
<P>From this immediate apprehension, how∣ever,
she was released when the sister
pushed it gently aside, without examina∣tion,
a circumstance that not less surprized
than relieved her. But, when the confe∣rence
broke up, and the friar, hastily
retreating among the crowd, disappeared
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
from the apartment, and the nun ap∣proached
and whispered the Superior, all
her terrors were renewed. She scarcely
doubted, that Vivaldi was detected, and
that his letter was designedly left where it
had been deposited, for the purpose of al∣luring
her to betray herself. Trembling,
dismayed, and almost sinking with appre∣hension,
she watched the countenance of
the Abbess, while the nun addressed her,
and thought she read her own fate in the
frown that appeared there.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the intentions or the
directions of the Superior, no active mea∣sure
was at present employed; the Recluse,
having received an answer, retired quietly
among the sisters, and the Abbess resumed
her usual manner. Ellena, however, sup∣posing
she was now observed, did not dare
to seize the paper, though she believed it
contained momentous information, and
feared that the time was now escaping,
which might facilitate her deliverance.
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Whenever she ventured to look round,
the eyes of the Abbess seemed pointed up∣on
her, and she judged from the position
of the nun, for the veil concealed her face,
that she also was vigilantly regarding her.</P>
<P>Above an hour had elapsed in this state
of anxious suspense, when the collation
concluded, and the assembly broke up;
during the general bustle of which, Ellena
ventured to the grate, and secured the pa∣per.
As she concealed it in her robe, she
scarcely dared to enquire by a hasty glance
whether she had been observed, and would
have withdrawn immediately to examine
the contents, had she not perceived, at the
same instant, the Abbess quitting the apart∣ment.
On looking round for the nun, El∣lena
discovered that she was gone.</P>
<P>Ellena followed distantly in the Abbess's
train; and, as she drew nearer to Olivia, gave
a signal, and passed on to her cell. There,
once more alone, and having secured the
door, she sat down to read Vivaldi's billet,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
trying to command her impatience, and to
understand the lines, over which her sight
rapidly moved, when in the eagerness of
turning over the paper, the lamp dropt
from her trembling hand and expired.
Her distress now nearly reached despair.
To go forth into the convent for a light
was utterly impracticable, since it would
betray that she was no longer a prisoner,
and not only would Olivia suffer from a
discovery of the indulgence she had grant∣ed,
but she herself would be immediately
confined. Her only hope rested upon Oli∣via's
arrival before it might be too late to
practice the instructions of Vivaldi, if, in∣deed,
they were still practicable; and she
listened with intense solicitude for an ap∣proaching
footstep, while she yet held, ig∣norant
of its contents, the billet, that pro∣bably
would decide her fate. A thousand
times she turned about the eventful paper,
endeavoured to trace the lines with her fin∣gers,
and to guess their import, thus enve∣loped
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
in mystery; while she experienced
all the various torture that the conscious∣ness
of having in her very hand the infor∣mation,
on a timely knowledge of which
her life, perhaps, depended, without being
able to understand it, could inflict.</P>
<P>Presently she heard advancing steps, and
a light gleamed from the passage before she
considered they might be some other than
Olivia's; and that it was prudent to con∣ceal
the billet she held. The considera∣tion,
however, came too late to be acted
upon; for, before the rustling paper was
disposed of, a person entered the cell, and
Ellena beheld her friend. Pale, trembling,
and silent, she took the lamp form the nun,
and, eagerly running over Vivaldi's note,
learned, that at the time it was written, bro∣ther
Jeronimo was in waiting without the
gate of the nun's garden, where Vivaldi de∣signed
to join him immediately, and con∣duct
her by a private way beyond the walls.
He added, that horses were stationed at the
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
foot of the mountain, to convey her where∣ever
she should judge proper; and conjured
her to be expeditious, since other circum∣stances,
besides the universal engagement
of the Recluses, were at that moment parti∣cularly
favourable to an escape.</P>
<P>Ellena, desponding and appalled, gave
the paper to Olivia, requesting she would
read it hastily, and advise her how to act.
It was now an hour and a half since Vival∣di
had said, that success depended upon ex∣pedition,
and that he had probably watch∣ed
at the appointed place; in such an in∣terval,
how many circumstances might
have occurred to destroy every possibility
of a retreat, which it was certain the en∣gagement
of the Abbess and the sisters no
longered favoured!</P>
<P>The generous Olivia, having read the
billet, partook of all her young friend's dis∣tress,
and was as willing, as Ellena was
anxious, to dare every danger for the
chance of obtaining deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Ellena could feel gratitude for such
goodness even at this moment of agoniz∣ing
apprehension. After a pause of deep
consideration, Olivia said, "In every ave∣nue
of the convent we are now liable to
meet some of the nuns; but my veil,
though thin, has hitherto protected you,
and we must hope it may still assist your
purpose. It will be necessary, however, to
pass through the refectory, where such of
the sisters as did not partake of the colla∣tion,
are assembled at supper, and will re∣main
so, till the first mattin calls them
to the chapel. If we wait till then, I fear
it will be to no purpose to go at all."</P>
<P>Ellena's fears perfectly agreed with those
of Olivia; and entreating that another mo∣ment
might not be lost in hesitation, and
that she would lead the way to the nun's
garden, they quitted the cell together.</P>
<P>Several of the sisters passed them, as they
descended to the refectory, but without
particularly noticing Ellena; who, as she
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
drew near that alarming apartment, wrapt
her veil closer, and leaned with heavier
pressure upon the arm of her faithful friend.
At the door they were met by the Abbess,
who had been overlooking the nuns assem∣bled
at supper, and missing Olivia had en∣quired
for her. Ellena shrunk back to
elude observation, and to let the Superior
pass; but Olivia was obliged to answer to
the summons. Having, however, unveiled
herself, she was permitted to proceed; and
Ellena, who had mingled with the crowd
that surrounded the Abbess, and thus es∣caped
detection, followed Olivia with fal∣tering
steps, through the refectory. The
nuns were luckily too much engaged by
the entertainment, at this moment, to
look round them, and the fugitive reach∣ed,
unsuspected, an opposite door.</P>
<P>In the hall, to which they descended,
the adventurers were frequently crossed by
servants bearing dishes from the refectory
to the kitchen; and, at the very moment
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
when they were opening the door, that led
into the garden, a sister, who had observed
them, demanded whether they had vet
heard the mattin-bell, since they were go∣ing
towards the chapel.</P>
<P>Terrified at this critical interruption,
Ellena pressed Olivia's arm, in signal of si∣lence,
and was hastening forward, when the
latter, more prudent, paused, and calmly
answering the question, was then suffered to
proceed.</P>
<P>As they crossed the garden towards the
gate, Ellena's anxiety lest Vivaldi should
have been compelled to leave it, encreased
so much, that she had scarcely power to
proceed. "O if my strength should fail
before I reach it!" she said softly to Olivia,
"or if I should reach it too late!"</P>
<P>Olivia tried to cheer her, and pointed
out the gate, on which the moonlight fell;
"At the end of this walk only," said Olivia,
"see!—where the shadows of the trees
open, is our goal."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Encouraged by the view of it, Ellena
fled with lighter steps along the alley; but
the gate seemed to mock her approach, and
to retreat before her. Fatigue overtook her
in this long alley, before she could overtake
the spot so anxiously sought, and, breath∣less
and exhausted, she was once more
compelled to stop, and once more in the
agony of terror exclaimed—"O, if my
strength should fail before I reach it!—O,
if I should drop even while it is within my
view."</P>
<P>The pause of a moment enabled her to
proceed, and she stopped not again till she
arrived at the gate; when Olivia suggested
the prudence of ascertaining who was with∣out,
and of receiving an answer to the sig∣nal,
which Vivaldi had proposed, before
they ventured to make themselves known.
She then struck upon the wood, and, in the
anxious pause that followed, whispering
voices were distinctly heard from without,
but no signal spoke in reply to the nun's.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
"We are betrayed!" said Ellena softly,
"but I will know the worst at once;" and
she repeated the signal, when, to her un∣speakable
joy, it was answered by three
smart raps upon the gate. Olivia, more
distrustful, would have checked the sud∣den
hope of her friend, till some further
proof had appeared, that it was Vivaldi
who waited without, but her precaution
came too late; a key already grated in the
lock; the door opened, and two persons
muffled in their garments appeared at it.
Ellena was hastily retreating, when a well-known
voice recalled her, and she perceiv∣ed,
by the rays of a half-hooded lamp,
which Jeronimo held, Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"O heavens!" he exclaimed, in a voice
tremulous with joy, as he took her hand,
"is it possible that you are again my own!
If you could but know what I have suffer∣ed
during this last hour!"—Then observ∣ing
Olivia, he drew back, till Ellena ex∣pressed
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
her deep sense of obligation to the
nun.</P>
<P>"We have no time to lose," said Jeroni∣mo
sullenly; "we have stayed too long al∣ready,
as you will find, perhaps."</P>
<P>"Farewel, dear Ellena!" said Olivia,
"may the protection of heaven never leave
you!"</P>
<P>The fears of Ellena now gave way to
affectionate sorrow, as, weeping on the
bosom of the nun, she said "farewel! O
farewel, my dear, my tender friend! I must
never, never see you more, but I shall always
love you; and you have promised, that I
shall hear from you; remember the con∣vent
della Pieta!"</P>
<P>"You should have settled this matter
within," said Jeronimo, "we have been
here these two hours already."</P>
<P>"Ah Ellena!" said Vivaldi, as he gently
disengaged her from the nun, "do I then
hold only the second place in your heart?"</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
Ellena, as she dismissed her tears, replied
with a smile more eloquent than words;
and when she had again and again bade
adieu to Olivia, she gave him her hand,
and quitted the gate.</P>
<P>"It is moonlight," observed Vivaldi to
Jeronimo, "your lamp is useless, and may
betray us."</P>
<P>"It will be necessary in the church," re∣plied
Jeronimo, "and in some circuitous
avenues we must pass, for I dare not lead
you out through the great gates, Signor▪
as you well know."</P>
<P>"Lead on, then," replied Vivaldi, and
they reached one of the cypress walks, that
extended to the church; but, before they
entered it, Ellena paused and looked back
to the garden gate, that she might see Oli∣via
once again. The nun was still there,
and Ellena perceived her faintly in the
moonlight, waving her hand in signal of a
last adieu. Ellena's heart was full; she
wept, and lingered, and returned the sig∣nal,
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
till the gentle violence of Vivaldi with∣drew
her from the spot.</P>
<P>"I envy your friend those tears," said
he, "and feel jealous of the tenderness that
excites them. Weep no more, my El∣lena."</P>
<P>"If you knew her worth," replied El∣lena,
"and the obligations I owe her!"—Her
voice was lost in sighs, and Vivaldi
only pressed her hand in silence.</P>
<P>As they traversed the gloomy walk, that
led to the church, Vivaldi said, "Are you
certain, father, that not any of the brothers
are doing penance at the shrines in our
way?"</P>
<P>"Doing penance on a festival, Signor!
they are more likely, by this time, to be
taking down the ornaments."</P>
<P>"That would be equally unfortunate
for us," said Vivaldi; "cannot we avoid
the church, father?"</P>
<P>Jeronimo assured him, that this was im∣possible;
and they immediately entered
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
one of its lonely aisles, where he unhooded
the lamp, for the tapers, which had given
splendour, at an earlier hour, to the nu∣merous
shrines, had expired, except those
at the high altar, which were so remote,
that their rays faded into twilight long be∣fore
they reached the part of the church
where the fugitives passed. Here and
there, indeed, a dying lamp shot a tremu∣lous
gleam upon the shrine below, and va∣nished
again, serving to mark the distances
in the long perspective of arches, rather
than to enlighten the gloomy solitude;
but no sound, not even of a whisper, stole
along the pavement.</P>
<P>They crossed to a side door communi∣cating
with the court, and with the rock,
which enshrined the image of <HI>our Lady of
mount Carmel.</HI> There, the sudden glare of
tapers issuing from the cave, alarmed the
fugitives, who had begun to retreat, when
Jeronimo, stepping forward to examine the
place, assured them, there was no symp∣tom
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
of any person being within, and that
lights burned day and night around the
shrine.</P>
<P>Revived by this explanation, they fol∣lowed
into the cave, where their conduc∣tor
opened a part of the wire-work enclos∣ing
the saint, and led them to the extremity
of the vault, sunk deep within which ap∣peared
a small door. While Ellena trem∣bled
with apprehension, Jeronimo applied
a key, and they perceived, beyond the
door, a narrow passage winding away into
the rock. The monk was leading on, but
Vivaldi, who had the suspicions of Ellena,
paused at the entrance, and demanded
whither he was conducting them.</P>
<P>To the place of your <HI>destination,</HI>" replied
the brother, in a hollow voice; an answer
which alarmed Ellena, and did not satisfy
Vivaldi. "I have given myself to your
guidance," he said, "and have confided
to you what is dearer to me than existence.
Your life," pointing to the short sword
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
concealed beneath his pilgrim's vest, "your
life, you may rely upon my word, shall
answer for your treachery. If your pur∣pose
is evil, pause a moment, and repent,
or you shall not quit this passage alive."</P>
<P>"Do you menace me!" replied the
brother, his countenance darkening. "Of
what service would be my death to you?
Do you not know that every brother in the
convent would rise to avenge it?"</P>
<P>"I know only that I will make sure of
one-traitor, if there be one," said Vivaldi,
"and defend this lady against your host of
monks; and, since you also know this,
proceed accordingly."</P>
<P>At this instant it occurring to Ellena, that
the passage in question probably led to the
prison-chamber, which Olivia had described
as situated within some deep recess of the
convent, and that Jeronimo had certainly
betrayed them, she refused to go further.
"If your purpose is honest," said she,
"why do you not conduct us through
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
some direct gate of the convent; why are
we brought into these subterraneous laby∣rinths?"</P>
<P>There is no direct gate but that of the
portal," Jeronimo replied, "and this is
the only other avenue leading beyond the
walls." "And why can we not go out
through the portal?" Vivaldi asked.</P>
<P>"Because it is beset with pilgrims, and
lay brothers," replied Jeronimo, "and
though you might pass them safely enough,
what is to become of the lady? But all
this you knew before, Signor; and was
willing enough to trust me, then. The
passage we are entering opens upon the
cliffs, at some distance. I have run ha∣zard
enough already, and will waste no
more time; so if you do not chuse to go
forward, I will leave you, and you may act
as you please."</P>
<P>He concluded with a laugh of derision,
and was re-locking the door, when Vivaldi,
alarmed for the probable consequence of
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
his resentment, and somewhat re-assured by
the indifference he discovered as to their
pursuing the avenue or not, endeavoured
to appease him, as well as to encourage
Ellena; and he succeeded in both.</P>
<P>As he followed in silence through the
gloomy passage, his doubts were, however,
not so wholly vanquished, but that he
was prepared for attack, and while he sup∣ported
Ellena with one hand, he held his
sword in the other.</P>
<P>The avenue was of considerable length▪
and before they reached its extremity, they
heard music from a distance, winding
along the rocks. "Hark!" cried Ellena,
"Whence come those sounds? Lis∣ten!"</P>
<P>"From the cave we have left," replied
Jeronimo, "and it is midnight by that;
it is the last chaunt of the pilgrims at the
shrine of our Lady. Make haste, Signor,
I shall be called for."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
The fugitives now perceived, that all
retreat was cut off, and that, if they had
lingered only a few moments longer in the
cave, they should have been surprized by
those devotees, some one of whom, how∣ever,
it appeared possible might wander
into this avenue, and still interrupt their
escape. When Vivaldi told his apprehen∣sions,
Jeronimo, with an arch sneer, affirm∣ed
there was no danger of that, "for the
passage," he added, "is known only to
the brothers of the convent."</P>
<P>Vivaldi's doubts vanished when he fur∣ther
understood, that the avenue led only
from the cliffs without to the cave, and
was used for the purpose of conveying se∣cretly
to the shrine, such articles as were
judged necessary to excite the superstitious
wonder of the devotees.</P>
<P>While he proceeded in thoughtful
silence, a distant chime sounded hollowly
through the chambers of the rock. "The
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
mattin-bell strikes!" said Jeronimo, in
seeming alarm, "I am summoned. Sig∣nora
quicken your steps;" an unnecessary
request, for Ellena already passed with
her utmost speed; and she now rejoiced
on perceiving a door in the remote wind∣ing
of the passage, which she believed
would emancipate her from the convent.
But, as she advanced, the avenue appear∣ed
extending beyond it; and the door,
which stood a little open allowed her a
glimpse of a chamber in the cliff, duskily
lighted.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, alarmed by the light, enquired,
when he had passed, whether any person
was in the chamber, and received an equi∣vocal
answer from Jeronimo, who, how∣ever,
soon after pointed to an arched gate
that terminated the avenue. They pro∣ceeded
with lighter steps, for hope now
cheared their hearts, and, on reaching the
gate, all apprehension vanished. Jeroni∣mo
gave the lamp to Vivaldi, while he
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
began to unbar and unlock the door, and
Vivaldi had prepared to reward the brother
for his fidelity, before they perceived that
the door refused to yield. A dreadful ima∣gination
seized on Vivaldi. Jeronimo
turning round, coolly said, "I fear we
are betrayed; the second lock is shot! I
have only the key of the first."</P>
<P>"We <HI>are</HI> betrayed," said Vivaldi, in a
resolute tone, "but do not suppose, that
your dissimulation conceals you. I under∣stand
by whom we are betrayed. Recollect
my late assertion, and consider once more,
whether it is your interest to intercept us."</P>
<P>"My Signor," replied Jeronimo, "I
do not deceive you when I protest by our
holy Saint, that I have not caused this
gate to be fastened, and that I would open
it if I could. The lock, which holds it,
was not shot an hour ago. I am the more
surprized at what has happened, because
this place is seldom passed, even by the
holiest footstep; and I fear, whoever has
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
passed now, has been led hither by suspi∣cion,
and comes to intercept your flight."</P>
<P>"Your wily explanation, brother, may
serve you for an inferior occasion, but not
on this," replied Vivaldi, "either, there∣fore,
unclose the gate, or prepare for the
worst. You are not now to learn, that,
however slightly I may estimate my own
life, I will never abandon this lady to the
horrors, which your community have al∣ready
prepared for her."</P>
<P>Ellena, summoning her fleeting spirits,
endeavoured to calm the indignation of Vi∣valdi,
and to prevent the consequence of
his suspicions, as well as to prevail with Je∣ronimo,
to unfasten the gate. Her efforts
were, however, followed by a long alterca∣tion;
but, at length, the art or the inno∣cence
of the brother, appeased Vivaldi,
who now endeavoured to force the gate,
while Jeronimo in vain represented its
strength, and the certain ruin, that must
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
fall upon himself, if it should be discovered
he had concurred in destroying it.</P>
<P>The gate was immoveable; but, as no
other chance of escaping appeared, Vival∣di
was not easily prevailed with to desist;
all possibility of retreating too was gone,
since the church and the cave were now
crowded with devotees, attending the mat∣tin
service.</P>
<P>Jeronimo, however, seemingly did not
despair of effecting their release, but he ac∣knowledged
that they would probably be
compelled to remain concealed in this
gloomy avenue all night, and perhaps the
next day. At length, it was agreed, that
he should return to the church, to examine
whether a possibility remained of the fugi∣tives
passing unobserved to the great por∣tal;
and, having conducted them back to
the chamber, of which they had taken
a passing glimpse, he proceeded to the
shrine,</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"/>
For a considerable time after his de∣parture,
they were not without hope; but,
their confidence diminishing as his delay
encreased, their uncertainty at length be∣came
terrible; and it was only for the
sake of Vivaldi, from whom she scrupu∣lously
concealed all knowledge of the par∣ticular
fate, which she was aware must
await her in the convent, that Ellena ap∣peared
to endure it with calmness. Not∣withstanding
the plausibility of Jeronimo,
suspicion of his treachery returned upon
her mind. The cold and earthy air of this
chamber was like that of a sepulchre; and
when she looked round, it appeared exact∣ly
to correspond with the description given
by Olivia of the prison where the nun had
languished and expired. It was walled
and vaulted with the rock, had only one
small grated aperture in the roof to admit
air, and contained no furniture, except one
table, a bench, and the lamp, which dim∣ly
shewed the apartment. That a lamp
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
should be found burning in a place so re∣mote
and solitary, amazed her still more
when she recollected the assertion of Jero∣nimo,
—that even holy steps seldom passed
this way; and when she considered also,
that he had expressed no surprize at a cir∣cumstance,
according to his own assertion,
so unusual. Again it appeared, that she
had been betrayed into the very prison,
designed for her by the Abbess; and the
horror, occasioned by this supposition, was
so great, that she was on the point of dis∣closing
it to Vivaldi, but an apprehension
of the distraction, into which his desperate
courage might precipitate him, restrained
her.</P>
<P>While these considerations occupied El∣lena,
and it appeared that any certainty
would be less painful than this suspense,
she frequently looked round the chamber
in search of some object, which might con∣tradict
or confirm her suspicion, that this
was the death-room of the unfortunate
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
nun. No such circumstance appeared, but
as her eyes glanced, with almost phrenzied
eagerness? she perceived something sha∣dowy
in a remote corner of the floor; and
on approaching, discovered what seemed a
dreadful hieroglyphic, a mattrass of straw,
in which she thought she beheld the
death-bed of the miserable recluse; nay
more, that the impression it still retained,
was that which her form had left there.</P>
<P>While Vivaldi was yet entreating her
to explain the occasion of the horror
she betrayed, the attention of each was
withdrawn by a hollow sigh, that rose
near them. Ellena caught unconsciously
the arm of Vivaldi, and listened, aghast,
for a return of the sound, but all remained
still.</P>
<P>"It surely was not fancied!" said Vival∣di,
after a long pause, "you heard it also?"</P>
<P>"I did!" replied Ellena.</P>
<P>"It was a sigh, was it not?" he added.</P>
<P>"O yes, and such a sigh!"</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>
"Some person is concealed near us," ob∣served
Vivaldi, looking round; "but be
not alarmed, Ellena, I have a sword."</P>
<P>"A sword! alas! you know not—But
hark! there, again!"</P>
<P>"That was very near us!" said Vivaldi.
"This lamp burns so sickly!"—and he
held it high, endeavouring to penetrate
the furthest gloom of the chamber. "Hah!
who goes there?" he cried, and stepped
suddenly forward; but no person appear∣ed,
and a silence as of the tomb, returned.</P>
<P>"If you are in sorrow, speak!" Vivaldi,
at length, said; "from fellow-sufferers you
will meet with sympathy. If your designs
are evil—tremble, for you shall find I am
desperate."</P>
<P>Still no answer was returned, and he car∣ried
forward the lamp to the opposite end
of the chamber, where he perceived a
small door in the rock. At the same in∣stant
he heard from within, a low tremu∣lous
sound, as of a person in prayer, or in
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
agony. He pressed against. the door,
which, to his surprize, yielded immediate∣ly,
and discovered a figure kneeling before
a crucifix, with an attention so wholly en∣gaged,
as not to observe the presence of a
stranger, till Vivaldi spoke. The person
then rose from his knees, and turning,
shewed the silvered temples and pale fea∣tures
of an aged monk. The mild and sor∣rowful
character of the countenance, and
the lambent lustre of eyes, which seemed
still to retain somewhat of the fire of ge∣nius,
interested Vivaldi, and encouraged
Ellena, who had followed him.</P>
<P>An unaffected surprize appeared in the
air of the monk; but Vivaldi, notwith∣standing
the interesting benignity of his
countenance, feared to answer his enqui∣ries,
till the father hinted to him, that an
explanation was necessary, even to his own
safety. Encouraged by his manner, rather
than intimidated by this hint, and per∣ceiving,
that his situation was desperate,
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
Vivaldi confided to the friar some partial
knowledge of his embarrassment.</P>
<P>While he spoke, the father listened with
deep attention, looked with compassion al∣ternately
upon him and Ellena; and some
harassing objection seemed to contend
with the pity, which urged him to assist the
strangers. He enquired how long Jeroni∣mo
had been absent, and shook his head
significantly when he learned that the gate
of the avenue was fastened by a double
lock. "You are betrayed, my children,"
said he, "you have trusted with the sim∣plicity
of youth, and the cunning of age has deceived you."</P>
<P>The terrible conviction affected Ellena
to tears; and Vivaldi, scarcely able to com∣mand
the indignation which a view of such
treachery excited, was unable to offer her
any consolation.</P>
<P>"You, my daughter, I remember to
have seen in the church this morning,"
observed the friar; "I remember too, that
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
you protested against the vows you were
brought thither to seal. Alas! my child,
was you aware of the consequence of such
a proceeding?"</P>
<P>"I had only a choice of evils," Ellena
replied.</P>
<P>"Holy father," said Vivaldi, "I will
not believe, that you are one of those who
either assisted in or approved the persecu∣tion
of innocence. If you were acquainted
with the misfortunes of this lady, you
would pity, and save her; but there is now
no time for detail; and I can only conjure
you, by every sacred consideration, to assist
her to leave the convent! If there were
leisure to inform you of the unjustifiable
means, which have been employed to bring
her within these walls—if you knew that
she was; taken, an orphan, from her home
at midnight—that armed ruffians brought
her hither—and at the command of stran∣gers
—that she has not a single relation sur∣viving
to assert her right of independence,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
or reclaim her of her persecutors.—O!
holy father, if you knew all this!"—Vi∣valdi
was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>The friar again regarded Ellena with
compassion, but still in thoughtful silence.
"All this may be very true," at length he
said, "but"—and he hesitated.</P>
<P>"I understand you, father," said Vival∣di
—"you require proof; but how can
proof be adduced here? You must rely up∣on
the honour of my word. And, if you are
inclined to assist us, it must be immediate∣ly!—while
you hesitate, we are lost. Even
now I think I hear the footsteps of Jeronimo."</P>
<P>He stepped softly to the door of the
chamber, but all was yet still. The friar,
too, listened, but he also deliberated;
while Ellena, with clasped hands and a look
of eager supplication and terror, awaited his
decision.</P>
<P>"No one is approaching," said Vivaldi,
"it is not yet too late!—Good father!
if you would serve us, dispatch."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40"/>
"Poor innocent!" said the friar, half to
himself, "in this chamber—in this fatal
place!"—</P>
<P>"It In this chamber!" exclaimed Ellena,
anticipating his meaning. "It was in this
chamber, then, that a nun was suffered to
perish! and I, no doubt, am conducted hi∣ther
to undergo a similar fate!"</P>
<P>"In this chamber!" re-echoed Vivaldi,
in a voice of desperation, "Holy father,
if you are indeed disposed to assist us, let
us act this instant; the next, perhaps, may
render your best intentions unavailing!"</P>
<P>The friar, who had regarded Ellena
while she mentioned the nun, with the ut∣most
surprize, now withdrew his attention;
a few tears fell on his cheek, but he hastily
dried them, and seemed struggling to over∣come
some grief, that was deep in his
heart.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, finding that entreaty had no
power to hasten his decision, and expect∣ing
every moment to hear the approach of
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
Jeronimo, paced the chamber in agonizing
perturbation, now pausing at the door to
listen, and then calling, though almost
hopelessly, upon the humanity of the friar.
While Ellena, looking round the room in
shuddering horror, repeatedly exclaimed,
"On this very spot! in this very chamber!
O what sufferings have these walls witness∣ed!
what are they yet to witness!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi now endeavoured to soothe the
spirits of Ellena, and again urged the friar
to employ this critical moment in saving
her; "O heaven!" said he, "if she is now
discovered, her fate is certain!"</P>
<P>"I dare not say what that fate would
be," interrupted the father, "or what my
own, should I consent to assist you; but,
though I am old, I have not quite for∣gotten
to feel for others! They may op∣press
the few remaining years of my age,
but the blooming days of youth should
flourish; and they shall flourish, my chil∣dren,
if my power can aid you. Follow
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
me to the gate; we will see whether my
key cannot unfasten all the locks that hold
it."</P>
<P>Vivaldi and Ellena immediately fol∣lowed
the feeble steps of the old man, who
frequently stopped to listen whether Jero∣nimo,
or any of the brothers, to whom the
latter might have betrayed Ellena's situa∣tion,
were approaching; but not an echo
wandered along the lonely avenue, till they
reached the gate, when distant footsteps
beat upon the ground.</P>
<P>"They are approaching, father!" whis∣pered
Ellena. "O, if the key should not
open these locks instantly, we are lost!
Hark! now I hear their voices—they call
upon my name! Already they have disco∣vered
we have left the chamber."</P>
<P>While the friar, with trembling hands,
applied the key, Vivaldi endeavoured at
once to assist him, and to encourage El∣lena.</P>
<P>The locks gave way, and the gate opened
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
at once upon the moonlight mountains.
Ellena heard once more, with the joy of li∣berty,
the midnight breeze passing among
the pensile branches of the palms, that
loftily overshadowed a rude platform be∣fore
the gate, and rustling with fainter
sound among the pendent shrubs of the
surrounding cliffs.</P>
<P>"There is no leisure for thanks, my
children," said the friar, observing they
were about to speak. "I will fallen the
gate, and endeavour to delay your pur∣suers,
that you may have time to escape.
My blessing go with you!"</P>
<P>Ellena and Vivaldi had scarcely a mo∣ment
to bid him "farewell!" before he
closed the door, and Vivaldi, taking her
arm, was hastening towards the place
where he had ordered Paulo to wait with
the horses, when, on turning an angle of
the convent wall, they perceived a long
train of pilgrims issuing forth from the
portal, at a little distance.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Vivaldi drew back; yet dreading every
moment, that he lingered near the monas∣tery,
to hear the voice of Jeronimo, or
other persons, from the avenue, he was
sometimes inclined to proceed at any ha∣zard.
The only practicable path leading
to the base of the mountain, however, was
now occupied by these devotees, and to
mingle with them was little less than cer∣tain
destruction. A bright moonlight
shewed distinctly every figure, that moved
in the scene, and the fugitives kept within
the shadow of the walls, till, warned by an
approaching footstep, they crossed to the
feet of the cliffs that rose beyond some
palmy hillocks on the right, whose dusky
recesses promised a temporary shelter.
As they passed with silent steps along the
winding rocks, the tranquillity of the land∣scape
below afforded an affecting contrast
with the tumult and alarm of their minds.</P>
<P>Being now at some distance from the
monastery, they rested under the shade of
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
the cliffs, till the procession of devotees,
which were traced descending among the
thickets and hollows of the mountain,
should be sufficiently remote. Often they
looked back to the convent, expecting to
see lights issue from the avenue, or the por∣tal;
and attended in mute anxiety for the
sullen murmurs of pursuit; but none
came on the breeze; nor did any gleam∣ing
lamp betray the steps of a spy.</P>
<P>Released, at length, from immediate
apprehension, Ellena listened to the mat∣tin-hymn
of the pilgrims, as it came upon
the still air and ascended towards the
cloudless heavens. Not a sound mingled
with the holy strain, and even in the mea∣sured
pause of voices only the trembling of
the foliage above was distinguished. The
responses, as they softened away in dis∣tance,
and swelled again on the wafting
breeze, appeared like the music of spirits,
watching by night upon the summits of
the mountains, and answering each other
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
in celestial airs, as they walk their high
boundary, and overlook the sleeping
world.</P>
<P>"How often, Ellena, at this hour,"
said Vivaldi, "have I lingered round your
dwelling, consoled by the consciousness of
being near you! Within those walls, I
have said, she reposes; they enclose my
worlds, all without is to me a desart. Now,
I am in your presence! O Ellena! now
that you are once more restored to me, suf∣fer
not the caprice of possibility again to
separate us! Let me lead you to the first
altar that will confirm our vows."</P>
<P>Vivaldi forgot, in the anxiety of a
stronger interest, the delicate silence he
had resolved to impose upon himself, till
Ellena should be in a place of safety.</P>
<P>"This is not a moment," she replied,
with hesitation, "for conversation; our
situation is yet perilous, we tremble on the
very brink pf danger."</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>
Vivaldi immediately rose; "Into what
imminent danger," said he, "had my self∣ish
folly nearly precipitated you! We are
lingering in this alarming neighbourhood,
when that feeble strain indicates the pil∣grims
to be sufficiently remote to permit
us to proceed!"</P>
<P>As he spoke, they descended cautiously
among the cliffs, often looking back to
the convent, where, however, no light ap∣peared,
except what the moon shed over
the spires and tall windows of its cathedral.
For a moment, Ellena fancied she saw a
taper in her favourite turret, and a belief,
that the nuns, perhaps the Abbess herself,
were searching for her there, renewed her
terror and her speed. But the rays were
only those of the moon, striking through
opposite casements of the chamber; and the
fugitives reached the base of the mountain
without further alarm, where Paulo ap∣peared
with horses, "Ah! Signormio," said
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
the servant, "I am glad to see you alive
and merry; I began to fear, by the length
of your stay, that, the monks had clapped
you up to do penance for life. How glad
I am to see you Maéstro!"</P>
<P>"Not more so than I am to see you,
good Paulo. But where is the pilgrim's
cloak I bade you provide?"</P>
<P>Paulo displayed it, and Vivaldi, having
wrapt it round Ellena, and placed her on
horseback, they took the read towards
Naples, Ellena designing to take refuge in
the convent della Pieta. Vivaldi, how∣ever,
apprehending that their enemies
would seek them on this road, proposed
leaving it as soon as practicable, and reach∣ing
the neighbourhood of Villa Altieri by
a circuitous way.</P>
<P>They soon after arrived at the tremen∣dous
pass, through which Ellena had ap∣proached
the monastery, and whose hor∣rors
were considerably heightened at this
dusky hour, for the moonlight fell only
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
partially upon the deep barriers of the
gorge, and frequently the precipice, with
the road on its brow, was entirely shadow∣ed
by other cliffs and woody points that
rose above it. But Paulo, whose spirits
seldom owned the influence of local
scenery, jogged merrily along, frequently
congratulating himself and his master on
their escape, and carolling briskly to the
echoes of the rocks, till Vivaldi, appre∣hensive
for the consequence of this loud
gaiety, desired him to desist.</P>
<P>"Ah Signormio! I must obey you," said
he, "but my heart was never so full in my
life; and I would fain sing, to unburden
it of some of this joy. That scrape we got
into in the dungeon there, at what's the
name of the place? was bad enough, but it
was nothing to this, because here I was left
out of it; and you, <HI>Maestro,</HI> might have
been murdered again and again, while I,
thinking of nothing at all, was quietly air∣ing
myself on the mountain by moonlight.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>
But what is that yonder in the sky, Sig∣nor?
It looks for all the world like a
bridge; only it is perched so high, that
nobody would think of building one in
such an out-of-the-way place, unless to cross
from cloud to cloud, much less would
take the trouble of clambering up after it,
for the pleasure of going over.</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked forward, and Ellena per∣ceived
the Alpine bridge, she had former∣ly
crossed with so much alarm, in the
moonlight perspective, airily suspended
between tremendous cliffs, with the river
far below, tumbling down the rocky
chasm. One of the supporting cliffs, with
part of the bridge, was in deep shade, but
the other, feathered with foliage, and the
rising surges at its foot, were strongly illu∣mined;
and many a thicket wet with the
spray, sparkled in contrast to the dark
rock it overhung. Beyond the arch, the
long-drawn prospect faded into misty
light.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51"/>
"Well, to be sure!" exclaimed Paulo,
"to see what curiosity will do! If there
are not some people have found their way
up to the bridge already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi now perceived figures upon the
slender arch, and, as their indistinct forms
glided in the moonshine, other emotions
than those of wonder disturbed him, lest
these might be pilgrims going to the shrine
of our Lady, and who would give infor∣mation
of his route. No possibility, how∣ever,
appeared of avoiding them, for the
precipices that rose immediately above,
and fell below, forbade all excursion, and
the road itself was so narrow, as scarcely to
admit of two horses passing each other.</P>
<P>"They are all off the bridge now, and
without having broken their necks, per∣haps!"
said Paulo, "where, I wonder,
will they go next! Why surely, Signor,
this road does not lead to the bridge
yonder; we are not going to pick our way
in the air too? The roar of those waters
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
has made my head dizzy already; and the
rocks here are as dark as midnight, and
seem ready to tumble upon one; they are
enough to make one despair to look at
them; you need not have checked my
mirth, Signor."</P>
<P>"I would fain check your loquacity,"
replied Vivaldi. "Do, good Paulo, be
silent and circumspect, those people may
be near us, though we do not yet see
them."</P>
<P>"The road does lead to the bridge,
then Signor!" said Paulo dolourously.
"And see! there they are again; winding
round that rock, and coming towards us."</P>
<P>"Hush! they are pilgrims," whispered
Vivaldi, "we will linger under the shade
of these rocks, while they pass. Remem∣ber,
Paulo, that a single indiscreet word
may be fatal; and that if they hail us, I
alone am to answer."</P>
<P>"You are obeyed, Signor."</P>
<P>The fugitives drew up close under the
cliffs, and proceeded slowly, while the
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
words of the devotees, as they advanced,
became audible.</P>
<P>"It gives one some comfort," said Paulo,
to hear cheerful voices, in such a place as
this. Bless their merry hearts! theirs
seems a pilgrimage of pleasure; but they
will be demure enough, I warrant, by
and bye. I wish I"—</P>
<P>"Paulo! have you so soon forgot?"
said Vivaldi sharply.</P>
<P>The devotees, on perceiving the tra∣vellers,
became suddenly silent; till he
who appeared to be the <HI>Father-director,</HI> as
they passed, said "Hail! in the name of
<HI>Our Lady of Mount Carmel!</HI>" and they
repeated the salutation in chorus.</P>
<P>"Hail!" replied Vivaldi, "the first
mass is over," and he passed on.</P>
<P>"But if you make haste, you may come
in for the second," said Paulo, jogging
after.</P>
<P>"You have just left the shrine, then?"
said one of the party, "and can tell us"—</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54"/>
"Poor pilgrims, like yourselves," replied
Paulo, "and can tell as little. Good mor∣row,
fathers, yonder peeps the dawn!"</P>
<P>He came up with his master, who had
hurried forward with Ellena, and who now
severely reproved his indiscretion; while
the voices of the Carmelites, singing the
mattin-hymn, sunk away among the rocks,
and the quietness of solitude returned.</P>
<P>"Thank heaven! we are quit of this
adventure," said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"And now we have only the bridge to
get over," rejoined Paulo, "and, I hope, we shall all be safe."</P>
<P>They were now at the entrance of it;
as they passed the trembling planks, and
looked up the glen, a party of people ap∣peared
advancing on the road the fugitives
had left, and a chorus of other voices than
those of the Carmelites, were heard ming∣ling
with the hollow sound of the waters.</P>
<P>Ellena, again alarmed, hastened for∣ward,
and Vivaldi, though he endeavoured
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
to appease her apprehension of pursuit, en∣couraged
her speed.</P>
<P>"These are nothing but more pilgrims
Signora," said Paulo, "or they would
not send such loud shouts before them;
they must needs think we can hear."</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded as fast as the
broken road would permit; and were soon
beyond the reach of the voices; but as
Paulo turned to look whether the party
was within sight, he perceived two persons,
wrapt in cloaks, advancing under the
brow of the cliffs, and within a few paces
of his horse's heels. Before he could give
notice to his master, they were at his side.</P>
<P>"Are you returning from the shrine of
<HI>our Lady?</HI>" said one of them.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, startled by the voice, looked
round, and demanded who asked the ques∣tion?</P>
<P>"A brother pilgrim," replied the man,
"one who has toiled up these steep rocks,
till his limbs will scarcely bear him fur∣ther.
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
Would that you would take com∣passion
on him, and give him a ride."</P>
<P>However compassionate Vivaldi might
be to the sufferings of others, this was not
a moment when he could indulge his dis∣position,
without endangering the safety
of Ellena; and he even fancied the stran∣ger
spoke in a voice of dissimulation. His
suspicions strengthened when the traveller,
not repulsed by a refusal, enquired the way
he was going, and proposed to join his
party; "For these mountains, they say,
are infested with banditti," he added,
"and a large company is less likely to be
attacked than a small one."</P>
<P>"If you are so very weary, my friend,"
said Vivaldi, "how is it possible you can
keep pace with our horses?" though I ac∣knowledge
you have done wonders in over∣taking
them."</P>
<P>"The fear of these banditti," replied
the stranger, "urged us on."</P>
<P>"You have nothing to apprehend from
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
robbers," said Vivaldi, "if you will only
moderate your pace; for a large company
of pilgrims are on the road, who will soon
overtake you."</P>
<P>He then put an end to the conversation,
by clapping spurs to his horse, and the
strangers were soon left far behind. The
inconsistency of their complaints with their
ability, and the whole of their manner,
were serious subjects of alarm to the fu∣gitives;
but when they had lost sight of
them, they lost also their apprehensions;
and having, at length, emerged from the
pass, they quitted the high road to Naples,
and struck into a solitary one that led
westward towards Aquila.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM the summit of a mountain, the
morning light shewed the travellers the
distant lake of Celano, gleaming at the
feet of other lofty mountains of the Appen∣nine,
far in the south. Thither Vivaldi
judged it prudent to direct his course, for
the lake lay so remote from the immediate
way to Naples, and from the neighbour∣hood
of San Stefano, that it's, banks pro∣mised
a secure retreat. He considered,
also, that among the convents scattered
along those delightful banks, might easily
be found a priest, who would solemnize
their nuptials, should Ellena consent to
an immediate marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>
The travellers descended among olive
woods, and soon after were directed by
some peasants at work, into a road that
leads from Aquila to the town of Celano,
one of the very few roads which intrudes
among the wild mountains, that on every
side sequester the lake. As they approach∣ed
the low grounds, the scent of orange
blossoms breathed upon the morning air,
and the spicy myrtle sent forth all its fra∣grance
from among the cliffs, which it
thickly tufted. Bowers of lemon and
orange spread along the valley; and among
the cabins of the peasants, who cultivated
them, Vivaldi hoped to obtain repose and
refreshment for Ellena.</P>
<P>The cottages, however, at which Paulo
enquired were unoccupied, the owners be∣ing
all gone forth to their labour: and
the travellers, again ascending, found them∣selves
soon after among mountains inha∣bited
by the flocks, where the scent of the
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
orange was exchanged for the aromatic
perfume of the pasturage.</P>
<P>"My Signor!" said Paulo, "is not that
a shepherd's horn sounding at a distance?
If so, the Signora may yet obtain some
refreshment."</P>
<P>While Vivaldi listened, a hautboy and a
pastoral drum were heard considerably
nearer.</P>
<P>They followed the sound over the turf,
and came within view of a cabin, sheltered
from the sun by a tuft of almond trees.
It was a dairy-cabin belonging to some
shepherds, who at a short distance were
watching their flocks, and, stretched be∣neath
the shade of chestnuts, were amus∣ing
themselves by playing upon these rural
instruments; a scene of Arcadian manners
frequent at this day, upon the mountains
of Abruzzo. The simplicity of their ap∣pearance,
approaching to wildness, was
tempered by a hospitable spirit. A vene∣rable
man, the chief shepherd, advanced
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
to meet the strangers; and, learning their
wants, conducted them into his cool cabin,
where cream, cheese made of goat's milk,
honey extracted from the delicious herbage
of the mountains, and dried figs were
quickly placed before them.</P>
<P>Ellena, overcome with the fatigue of
anxiety, rather than that of travelling, re∣tired,
when she had taken breakfast, for an
hour's repose; while Vivaldi rested on the
bench before the cottage, and Paulo, keep∣ing
watch, discussed his breakfast, toge∣ther
with the circumstances of the late
alarm, under the shade of the almond trees.</P>
<P>When Ellena again appeared, Vivaldi
proposed, that they should rest here dur∣ing
the intense heat of the day; and, since
he now considered her to be in a place of
temporary safety, he ventured to renew the
subject nearest his heart; to represent the
evils, that might overtake them, and to
urge an immediate solemnization of their
marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
Thoughtful and dejected, Ellena at∣tended
for some time in silence to the ar∣guments
and pleadings of Vivaldi. She secretly acknowledged the justness of his
representations, but she shrunk, more than
ever; from the indelicacy, the degradation
of intruding herself into his family; a fa∣mily,
too, from whom she had not only
received proofs of strong dislike, but had
suffered terrible injustice, and been me∣naced
with still severer cruelty. These
latter circumstances, however, released her
from all obligations of delicacy or genero∣sity,
so far as concerned only the authors
of her suffering; and she had now but to
consider the happiness of Vivaldi and her∣self.
Yet she could not decide thus pre∣cipitately
on a subject, which so solemnly
involved the fortune of her whole life; nor
forbear reminding Vivaldi, affectionately,
gratefully, as she loved him, of the cir∣cumstances
which with-held her decision.</P>
<P>"Tell me yourself," said she, "whether
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
I ought to give my hand, while your fa∣mily
—your mother"—She paused, and
blushed, and burst into tears.</P>
<P>"Spare me the view of those tears,"
said Vivaldi, "and a recollection of the
circumstances that excite them. O, let
me not think of my mother, while I see
you weep! Let me not remember, that
her injustice and cruelty destined you to
perpetual sorrow!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi's features became slightly con∣vulsed,
while he spoke; he rose, paced the
room with quick steps, and then quitted
it, and walked under the shade of the
trees in front of the cabin.</P>
<P>In a few moments, however, he com∣manded
his emotion and returned. Again
he placed himself on the bench beside
Ellena, and taking her hand, said solemn∣ly,
and in a voice of extreme sensibility,
"Ellena, you have long witnessed how
dear you are to me; you cannot doubt
my love; you have long since promised—
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
solemnly promised, in the presence of her
who is now no more, but whose spirit may
even at this moment look down upon us,
—of her, who bequeathed you to my ten∣derest
care, to be mine for ever. By these
sacred truths, by these affecting recollec∣tions!
I conjure you, abandon me not to
despair, nor in the energy of a just resent∣ment,
sacrifice the son to the cruel and
mistaken policy of the mother! You, nor
I, can conjecture the machinations, which
may be spread for us, when it shall be
known that you have left San Stefano.
If we delay to exchange our vows, I know,
and I feel—that you are lost to me for
ever!"</P>
<P>Ellena was affected, and for some mo∣ments
unable to reply. At length, dry∣ing
her tears, she said tenderly, "Resent∣ment
can have no influence on my con∣duct
towards you; I think I feel none
towards the Marchesa—for she is your
mother. But pride, insulted pride, has a
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
right to dictate, and ought to be obeyed;
and the time is now, perhaps, arrived when,
if I would respect myself, I must renounce
you."—</P>
<P>"Renounce me!" interrupted Vivaldi,
"renounce me! And is it, then, possible
you could renounce me?" he repeated,
his eyes still fixed upon her face with ea∣gerness
and consternation. "Tell me at
once, Ellena, is it possible?"</P>
<P>"I fear it is not," she replied.</P>
<P>"You fear! alas! if you <HI>fear,</HI> it is too
possible, and I have lost you already! Say,
O! say but, that you <HI>hope</HI> it is not, and I,
too, will hope again."</P>
<P>The anguish, with which he uttered this,
awakened all her tenderness, and, forget∣ting
the reserve she had imposed upon her∣self,
and every half-formed resolution; she
said, with a smile of ineffable sweetness, "I
will neither fear nor hope in this instance;
I will obey the dictates of gratitude, of
affection, and will <HI>believe.</HI> that I never
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
can renounce you, while you are un∣changed."</P>
<P>"Believe!" repeated Vivaldi, "only
believe! And why that mention of grati∣tude;
and why that unnecessary reserva∣tion?
Yet even this assurance, feebly as it
sustains my hopes, is extorted; you see
my misery, and from pity, from <HI>gratitude,</HI>
not affection, would assuage it. Besides,
you will neither fear, nor hope! Ah, Elle∣na!
did love ever yet exist without fear—and
without hope? O! never, never! I
fear and hope with such rapid transition;
every assurance, every look of yours gives
such force either to the one, or to the
other, that I suffer unceasing anxiety.
Why, too, that cold, that heart-breaking
mention of gratitude? No, Ellena! it is
too certain that you do not love me!—My
mother's cruelty has estranged your heart
from me!"</P>
<P>"How much you mistake!" said Elle∣na.
"You have already received sacred
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
testimonies of my regard; if you doubt
their sincerity, pardon me, if I so far re∣pect
myself as to forbear entreating you
will believe them."</P>
<P>"How calm, how indifferent, how cir∣cumspect,
how prudent!" exclaimed Vi∣valdi
in tones of mournful reproach.
"But I will not distress you; forgive me
for renewing this subject at this time. It
was my intention to be silent till you should
have reached a place of more permanent
security than this; but how was it possible,
with such anxiety pressing upon my heart,
to persevere in that design. And what have
I gained by departing from it?—increase
of anxiety—of doubt—of fear!"</P>
<P>"Why will you persist in such self-in∣flictions?"
said Ellena. "I cannot endure
that you should doubt my affection, even
for a moment. And how can you suppose
it possible, that I ever can become insen∣sible
of your's; that I can ever forget the
imminent danger you have voluntarily in∣curred
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
for my release, or, remembering it,
can cease to feel the warmest gratitude?"</P>
<P>"That is the very word which tortures
me beyond all others!" said Vivaldi; "is
it then, only a sense of obligation you own
for me? O! rather say you hate me, than
suffer me to deceive my hopes with assur∣ances
of a sentiment so cold, so circum∣scribed,
so dutiful as that of gratitude!"</P>
<P>"With me the word has a very diffe∣rent
acceptation," replied Ellena smiling.
"I understand it to imply all that is tender
and generous in affection; and the sense
of duty which you say it includes, is one of
the sweetest and most sacred feelings of the
human heart."</P>
<P>"Ah Ellena! I am too willing to be de∣ceived,
to examine your definition rigo∣rously;
yet I believe it is your smile, ra∣ther
than the accuracy of your explana∣tion,
that persuades me to a confidence in
your affection; and I will trust, that the
gratitude <HI>you</HI> feel is thus tender and com∣prehensive.
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
But, I beseech you, name
the word no more! Its sound is like the
touch of the Torpedo, I perceive my con∣fidence
chilled even while I listen to my
own pronunciation of it."</P>
<P>The entrance of Paulo interrupted the
conversation, who advancing with an
air of mystery and alarm, said in a low
voice,</P>
<P>"Signor! as I kept watch under the
almond trees, who should I see mounting
up the road from the valley yonder, but
the two bare-footed Carmelites, that over took
us in the pass of Chiari! I lost them
again behind the woods, but I dare say
they are coming this way, for the moment
they spy out this dairy-hut, they will guess
something good is to be had here; and the
shepherds would believe their flocks would
all die, if"—</P>
<P>"I see them at this moment emerging
from the woods," said Vivaldi, "and now,
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
they are leaving the road and crossing this
way. Where is our host, Paulo!</P>
<P>"He is without, at a little distance,
Signor. Shall I call him?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Vivaldi, "or, stay; I
will call him myself. Yet, if they see
me"—</P>
<P>"Aye, Signor; or, for that matter, if
they see me. But we cannot help our∣selves
now; for if we call the host, we
shall betray ourselves, and, if we do not
call him, he will betray us; so they must
find us out, be it as it may."</P>
<P>"Peace! peace! let me think a mo∣ment,"
said Vivaldi. While Vivaldi un∣dertook
to think, Paulo was peeping
about for a hiding place, if occasion should
require one.</P>
<P>"Call our host immediately," said
Vivaldi, "I must speak with him."</P>
<P>"He passes the lattice at this instant,"
said Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71"/>
Paulo obeyed, and the shepherd en∣tered
the cabin.</P>
<P>"My good friend," said Vivaldi, "I
must entreat that you will not admit those
friars, whom you see coming this way, nor
suffer them to know what guests you have.
They have been very troublesome to us al∣ready,
on the road; I will reward you for
any loss their sudden departure may occa∣sion
you."</P>
<P>"Nay for that matter, friend," said
Paulo, "it is their visit only that can occa∣sion
you loss, begging the Signor's par∣don;
their departure never occasioned
loss to any body. And to tell you the
truth, for my master will not speak out,
we were obliged to look pretty sharply
about us, while they bore us company, or
we have reason to think our pockets would
have been the lighter. They are design∣ing
people, friend, take my word for it;
banditti, perhaps, in disguise. The dress
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
of a Carmelite would suit their purpose, at
this time of the pilgrimage. So be pretty
blunt with them, if they want to come in
here; and you will do well, when they go,
to send somebody to watch which way
they take, and see them clear off, or you
may lose a stray lamb, perhaps."</P>
<P>The old shepherd lifted up his eyes and
hands, "To see how the world goes!" said
he. "But thank you, Maestro, for your
warning; they shall not come within my
threshold, for all their holy seeming, and
its the first time in my life I ever said nay
to one of their garb, and mine has been a
pretty long one, as you may guess, per∣haps,
by my face. How old, Signor,
should you take me to be? I warrant you
will guess short of the matter tho'; for on
these high mountains"—</P>
<P>"I will guess when you have dismissed
the travellers," said Vivaldi, "after having
given them some hasty refreshment with∣out;
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
they must be almost at the door, by
this time. Dispatch, friend."</P>
<P>"If they should fall foul upon me, for
refusing them entrance," said the shepherd,
"you will come out to help me, Signor?
for my lads are at some distance."</P>
<P>Vivaldi assured him that they would,
and he left the cabin.</P>
<P>Paulo ventured to peep at the lattice, on
what might be going forward without.
"They are gone round to the door, Sig∣nor,
I fancy," said he, "for I see nothing
of them this way; if there was but another
window What foolish people to build a
cottage with no window. near the door!
But I must listen."</P>
<P>He stepped on tip-toe to the door, and
bent his head in attention.</P>
<P>"They are certainly spies from the mo∣nastery,"
said Ellena to Vivaldi, "they fo∣llow
us so closely! If they were pilgrims, it
is improbable, too, that their way should
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
be through this unfrequented region, and
still more so, that they should not travel in
a larger party. When my absence was
discovered, these people were sent, no
doubt, in pursuit of me, and having met
the devotees whom we passed, they were
enabled to follow our route."</P>
<P>"We shall do well to act upon this sup∣position,"
replied Vivaldi, "but, though
I am inclined to believe them emissaries
from San Stefano, it is not improbable
that they are only Carmelites returning to
some convent on the lake of Celano."</P>
<P>"I cannot hear a syllable, Signor," said
Paulo. "Pray do listen yourself! and
there is not a single chink in this door to
afford one consolation. Well! if ever I
build a cottage, there shall be a window
near—"</P>
<P>"Listen!" said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Not a single word, Signor!" cried
Paulo, after a pause, "I do not even hear
a voice!—But now I hear steps, and they
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
are coming to the door, too; they shall
find it no easy matter to open it, though;"
he added, placing himself against it. "Ay,
ay, you may knock, friend, till your
arm aches, and kick and lay about you—no
matter for that."</P>
<P>"Silence! let us know who it is," said
Vivaldi; and the old shepherd's voice
was heard without. "They are gone,
Signors," said he, "you may open the
door."</P>
<P>"Which way did they go?" asked Vi∣valdi,
when the man entered. "I cannot
say, as to that, Signor, because I did not
happen to see them at all; and I have been
looking all about, too."</P>
<P>"Why, I saw them myself, crossing
this way from the wood yonder," said
Paulo.</P>
<P>"And there is nothing to shelter them
from our view between the wood, and this
cottage, friend," added Vivaldi; "What
can they have done with themselves?"</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76"/>
"For that matter, gone into the wood
again, perhaps," said the shepherd.</P>
<P>Paulo gave his master a significant look,
and added, "It is likely enough, friend;
and you may depend upon it they are
lurking there for no good purpose, You
will do well to send somebody to look after
them; your flocks will suffer for it, else.
Depend upon it, they design no good."</P>
<P>"We are not used to such sort of folks
in these parts," replied the shepherd,
"but if they mean any harm, they shall
find we can help ourselves." As her con∣cluded,
he took down a horn from the
roof, and blew a shrill blast that made the
mountains echo; when immediately the
younger shepherds were seen running from
various quarters towards the cottage.</P>
<P>"Do not be alarmed, friend;" said
Vivaldi, "these travellers mean you no
harm, I dare say, whatever they may de∣sign
against us. But, as I think them sus∣picious
persons, and should not like to
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
overtake them on the road, I will reward
one of your lads if you will let him go a
little ways towards Celano, and examine
whether they are lurking on that route."</P>
<P>The old man consented, and, when the
shepherds came up, one of them received
directions from Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"And be sure you do not return, till
you have found them," added Paulo.</P>
<P>"No master," replied the lad, "and I
will bring them safe here, you may trust
me."</P>
<P>"If you do, friend, you will get your
head broke for your trouble. You are
only to discover where they are, and to
watch where they go," said Paulo.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, at length, made the lad com∣prehend
what was required of him, and
he departed; while the old shepherd went
out to keep guard.</P>
<P>The time of his absence was passed
in various conjectures by the party in the
cabin, concerning the Carmelites, Vivaldi
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
still inclined to believe they were honest
people returning from a pilgrimage, but
Paulo was decidedly against this opinion.
"They are waiting for us on the road, you
may depend upon it, Signor," said the
latter. "You may be certain they have
some <HI>great design</HI> in hand, or they would
never have turned their steps from this
dairy-house when once they had spied it,
and that they did spy it, we are sure."</P>
<P>"But if they have in hand the great de∣sign
you speak of, Paulo," said Vivaldi,
"it is probable that they have spied us
also, by their taking this obscure road.
Now it must have occurred to them when
they saw a dairy-hut, in so solitary a region,
that we might probably be found within—yet
they have not examined. It appears,
therefore, they have no design against
us. What can you answer to this Paulo?
I trust the apprehensions of Signora di
Rosalba are unsounded.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79"/>
"Why! do you suppose, Signor, they
would attack us when we were safe
housed, and had these good shepherds to
lend us a helping hand? No, Signor, they
would not even have shewn themselves, if
they could have helped it; and being once
sure we were here, they would skulk back
to the woods, and lurk for us in the road
they knew we must go, since, as it hap∣pens,
there is only one."</P>
<P>"How is it possible," said Ellena, "that
they can have discovered us here, since they
did not approach the cabin to enquire."</P>
<P>"They came near enough for their pur∣pose,
Signora, I dare say; and, if the
truth were known, they spied my face
looking at them through the lattice."</P>
<P>"Come, come," said Vivaldi, "you
are an ingenious tormentor, indeed, Paulo.
Do you suppose they saw enough of thy
face last night by moonlight, in that dusky
glen, to enable them to recollect it again
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
at a distance of forty yards? Revive, my
Ellena, I think every appearance is in our
favour."</P>
<P>"Would I could think, so too!" said
she, with a sigh.</P>
<P>"O! for that matter, Signora," rejoined
"Paulo, there is nothing to be afraid of;
they should find tough work of it, if
they thought proper to attack us, lady."</P>
<P>"It is not an open attack that we have
to fear," replied Ellena, "but they may
surround us with their snares, and defy re∣sistance."</P>
<P>However Vivaldi might accede to the
truth of this remark, he would not appear
to do so; but tried to laugh away her ap∣prehensions;
and Paulo was silenced for a
while, by a significant look from his
master.</P>
<P>The shepherd's boy returned much
sooner than they had expected, and he
probably saved his time, that he might
spare his labour, for he brought no intelli∣gence
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
of the Carmelites. "I looked for
them among the woods along the road
side in the hollow, yonder, too," said
the lad, "and then I mounted the hill
further on, but I could see nothing of
them far or near, nor of a single soul, ex∣cept
our goats, and some of them do stray
wide enough, sometimes; they lead me a
fine dance often. They sometimes, Sig∣nor,
have wandered as far as Monte
Nuvola, yonder, and got to the top of it,
up among the clouds, and the crags,
where I should break my neck if I climbed;
and the rogues seemed to know it, too,
for when they have seen me coming,
scrambling up, puffing and blowing, they
have ceased their capering, and stood peep∣ing
over a crag so sly, and so quiet, it
seemed as if they were laughing at me;
as much as to say, "Catch us if you
can."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who during the latter part of
this speech had been consulting with
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
Ellena, whether they should proceed on
their way immediately, asked the boy some
further questions concerning the Carme∣lites;
and becoming convinced that they
had either not taken the road to Celano,
or, having taken it, were at a considerable
distance, he proposed setting out, and pro∣ceeding
leisurely, "For I have now little
apprehension of these people," he added,
"and a great deal lest night should over take
us before we reach the place of our
destination, since the road is mountainous
and wild, and, further, we are not perfectly
acquainted with it."</P>
<P>Ellena approving the plan, they took
leave of the good shepherd, who could
with difficulty be prevailed with to accept
any recompence for his trouble, and who
gave them some further directions as to the
road; and their way was long cheered by
the sound of the tabor and the sweetness
of the hautboy, wafted over the wild.</P>
<P>When they descended into the woody
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
hollow mentioned by the boy, Ellena sent
forth many an anxious look beneath the
deep shade; while Paulo, sometimes silent,
and at others whistling and singing loudly,
as if to overcome his fears, peeped under
every bough that crossed the road, ex∣pecting
to discover his friends the Carme∣lites
lurking within its gloom.</P>
<P>Having emerged from this valley, the
road lay over mountains covered with
flocks, for it was now the season when they
had quitted the plains of Apulia, to feed
upon the herbage for which this region is
celebrated; and it was near sun-set, when,
from a summit to which the travellers had
long been ascending, the whole lake of
Celano, with its vast circle of mountains,
burst at once upon their view.</P>
<P>"Ah Signor!" exclaimed Paulo, "what
a prospect is here! It reminds me of
home; it is almost as pleasant as the bay
of Naples! I should never love it like that
though, if it were an hundred times finer."
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
The travellers stopped to admire the
scene, and to give their horses rest, after
the labour of the ascent. The evening
sun, shooting athwart a clear expanse of
water, between eighteen and twenty leagues
in circumference, lighted up all the towns
and villages, and towered castles, and spiry
convents, that enriched the rising shores;
brought out all the various tints of culti∣vation,
and coloured with beamy purple
the mountains which on every side formed
the majestic background of the landscape.
Vivaldi pointed out to Ellena the gigan∣tic
Velino in the north, a barrier moun∣tain,
between the territories of Rome and
Naples. Its peaked head towered far
above every neighbouring summit, and its
white precipices were opposed to the ver∣dant
points of the Majella, snow-crowned,
and next in altitude, loved by the flocks.
Westward, near woody hills, and rising im∣mediately
from the lake, appeared Monte
Salviano, covered with wild sage, as its
name imports, and once pompous with
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
forests of chestnut; a branch from the Ap∣pennine
extended to meet it. "See," said
Vivaldi "where Monte Corno stands like
a ruffian, huge, scared, threatening, and
horrid!—and in the south, where the sullen
mountain of San Nicolo shoots up, barren
and rocky! From thence, mark how other
overtopping ridges of the mighty Apennine
darken the horizon far along the east, and
circle to approach the Velino in the north!"</P>
<P>"Mark too," said Ellena, "how sweet∣ly
the banks and undulating plains repose
at the feet of the mountains; what an
image of beauty and elegance they oppose
to the awful grandeur that overlooks and
guards them! Observe, too, how many a
delightful valley, opening from the lake,
spreads its rice and corn fields, shaded
with groves of the almond, far among the
winding hills; how gaily vineyards and
olives alternately chequer the acclivities,
and how gracefully the lofty palms bend
over the higher cliffs."</P>
<P>"Ay, Signora!" exclaimed Paulo, "and
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
have the goodness to observe how like are
the fishing boats, that sail towards the ham∣let
below, to those one sees upon the bay
of Naples. They are worth all the rest of
the prospect, except indeed this fine sheet
of water, which is almost as good as the bay,
and that mountain, with its sharp
head, which is almost as good as Vesuvius
—if it would but throw out fire!"</P>
<P>"We must despair of finding a moun∣tain
in this neighbourhood, so <HI>good</HI> as to
do that, Paulo," said Vivaldi, smiling at
this stroke of nationality; "though, per∣haps,
many that we now see, have once
been volcanic."</P>
<P>"I honour them for that, Signor; and
look at them with double satisfaction;
but <HI>our.</HI> mountain is the only mountain in
the world. O! to see it of a dark night!
what a blazing it makes! and what a
height it will shoot to! and what a light
it throws over the sea! No other moun∣tain
can do so. It seems as if the waves
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
were all on fire. I have seen the reflec∣tion
as far off as Capri, trembling all across
the gulf, and shewing every vessel as plain
as at noon day; ay, and every sailor on
the deck. You never saw such a sight,
Signor."</P>
<P>"Why you do, indeed, seem to have
forgotten that I ever did, Paulo, and
also that a volcano can do any mischief.
But let us return, Ellena, to the scene be∣fore
us. Yonder, a mile or two within
the shore, is the town of Celano, whither
we are going."</P>
<P>The clearness of an Italian atmosphere
permitted him to discriminate the minute
through very distant features of the land∣scape;
and on an eminence rising from the
plains of a valley, opening to the west, he
pointed out the modern Alba, crowned
with the ruins of its ancient castle, still
visible upon the splendor of the horizon,
the prison and tomb of many a Prince,
who, "fallen from his high estate," was
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
sent from Imperial Rome to finish here
the sad reverse of his days; to gaze from
the bars of his tower upon solitudes where
beauty or grandeur administered no as∣suaging
feelings to him, whose life had
passed amidst the intrigues of the world,
and the feverish contentions of disappoint∣ed
ambition; to him, with whom reflec∣tion
brought only remorse, and antici∣pation
despair; whom "no horizontal
beam enlivened in the crimson evening of
life's dusty day."</P>
<P>"And to such a scene as this," said Vi∣valdi,
"a Roman Emperor came, only for
the purpose of witnessing the most barba∣rous
exhibition; to indulge the most sa∣vage
delights! Here, Claudius celebrated
the accomplishment of his arduous work,
an aqueduct to carry the overflowing wa∣ters
of the Celano to Rome, by a naval
fight, in which hundreds of wretched slaves
perished for his amusement! Its pure and
polished surface was stained with human
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
blood, and roughened by the plunging bo∣dies
of the slain, while the gilded gallies
of the Emperor floated gaily around, and
these beautiful shores were made to echo
with applauding yells, worthy of the
furies!"</P>
<P>"We scarcely dare to trust the truth of
history, in some of its traits of human na∣ture,"
said Ellena.</P>
<P>"Signor," cried Paulo, "I have been
thinking that while we are taking the air,
so much at our ease, here, those Carmelites
may be spying at us from some hole or
corner that we know nothing of, and may
swoop upon us, all of a sudden, before we
can help ourselves. Had we not better go
on, Signor?"</P>
<P>"Our horses are, perhaps, sufficiently
rested," replied Vivaldi, "but, if I had not
long since dismissed all suspicion of the
evil intention of those strangers, I should
not willingly have stopped for a moment."</P>
<P>"But pray let us proceed," said Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90"/>
"Ay, Signora, it is best to be of the
safe side," observed Paulo. "Yonder, be∣low,
is Celano, and I hope we shall get safe
housed there, before it is quite dark, for
here we have no mountain, that will light
us on our way! Ah! if we were but within
twenty miles of Naples, now,—and it was
an <HI>illumination.</HI> night!"—</P>
<P>As they descended the mountain, Elle∣na,
silent and dejected, abandoned herself
to reflection. She was too sensible of the
difficulties of her present situation, and
too apprehensive of the influence, which
her determination must have on all her fu∣ture
life, to be happy, though escaped
from the prison of San Stefano, and in the
presence of Vivaldi, her beloved deliverer
and protector. He observed her dejec∣tion
with grief, and, not understanding all
the finer scruples that distressed her, in∣terpreted
her reserve into indifference towards
himself. But he forbore to disturb
her again with a mention of his doubts,
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
or fears; and he determined not to urge the
subject of his late entreaties, till he should
have placed her in some secure asylum▪
where she might feel herself at perfect li∣berty
to accept or to reject his proposal.
By acting with an honour so delicate, he
unconsciously adopted a certain means of
increasing her esteem and gratitude, and
deserved them the more, since he had to
endure the apprehension of losing her by the
delay thus occasioned to their nuptials.</P>
<P>They reached the town of Celano be∣fore
the evening closed; when Vivaldi was
requested by Ellena to enquire for a con∣vent,
where she might be lodged for the
night. He left her at the inn, with Paulo
for her guard, and proceeded on his search.
The first gate he knocked upon belonged
to a convent of Carmelites. It appeared
probable, that the pilgrims of that order,
who had occasioned him so much disquie∣tude,
were honest brothers of this house;
but as it was probable also, that if they
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
were emissaries of the Abbess of San Stefa∣no,
and came to Celano, they would take
up their lodging with a society of their
own class, in preference to that of any
other, Vivaldi thought it prudent to retire
from their gates without making himself
known. He passed on, therefore, and
soon after arrived at a convent of Domi∣nicans,
where he learned, that there were
only two houses of nuns in Celano, and
that these admitted no other boarders than
permanent ones.</P>
<P>Vivaldi returned with this intelligence
to Ellena, who endeavoured to reconcile
herself to the necessity of remaining where
she was; but Paulo, ever active and zea∣lous,
brought intelligence, that at a little
fishing town, at some distance, on the
bank of the lake, was a convent of Ursa∣lines,
remarkable for their hospitality to
strangers. The obscurity of so remote a
place, was another reason for preferring it
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
to Celano, and Vivaldi proposing to re∣move
thither, if Ellena was not too weary
to proceed, she readily, assented, and they
immediately set off.</P>
<P>"It happens to be a fine night," said
Paulo, as they left Celano, "and so, Sig∣nor,
we cannot well lose our way; be∣sides,
they say, there is but one. The town
we are going to lies yonder on the edge of
the lake, about a mile and a hair off. I
think I can see a gray steeple or two, a
little to the right of that wood where the
water gleams so."</P>
<P>"No, Paulo," replied Vivaldi, after
looking attentively. "I perceive what
you mean; but those are not the points of
steeples, they are only the tops of some
tall cypresses."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Signor, they are too ta∣pering
for trees; that must surely be the
town. This road, however, will lead us
right, for there is no other to puzzle us,
as they say,"</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94"/>
"This cool and balmy air revives me,"
said Ellena; "and what a soothing shade
prevails over the scene! How softened,
yet how distinct, is every near object;
how sweetly dubious the more removed
ones; while the mountains beyond cha∣racter
themselves sublimely upon the still
glowing horizon."</P>
<P>"Observe, too," said Vivaldi, "how
their broken summits, tipt with the beams
that have set to our lower region, exhibit
the portraiture of towers and castles, and
embattled ramparts, which seemed design∣ed
to guard them against the enemies,
that may come by the clouds."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Ellena, "the mountains
themselves display a sublimity, that seems
to belong to a higher world; their be∣siegers
ought not to be of this earth; they
can be only spirits of the air."</P>
<P>"They can be nothing else, Signora,"
said Paulo, "for nothing of this earth can
reach them. See! lady, they have some
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
of the qualities of your spirits, too; see!
how they change their shapes and colours,
as the sun-beams sink. And now, how
gray and dim they grow! See but how
fast they vanish!"</P>
<P>"Every thing reposes," said Vivaldi."
"who would willingly travel in the day,
when Italy has such nights as this!"</P>
<P>"Signor, that <HI>is</HI> the town before us,"
said Paulo, "for now I can discern, plain
enough, the spires of convents; and there
goes a light! Hah, hah! and there is a
bell, too, chiming from one of the spires!
The monks are going to mass; would we
were going to supper, Signor!"</P>
<P>"That chime is nearer than the place
you point to, Paulo, and I doubt whether
it comes from the same quarter."</P>
<P>"Hark! Signor, the air wafts the sound!
and now it is gone again."</P>
<P>"Yes, I believe you are right, Paulo,
and that we have not far to go."</P>
<P>The travellers descended the gradual
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
slopes, towards the shore; and Paulo,
some time after, exclaimed, "See, Signor,
where another light glides along See! it
is reflected on the lake."</P>
<P>"I hear the faint dashing of waves,
now," said Ellena, "and the sound of
oars, too. But observe, Paulo, the light
is not in the town, it is in the boat that
moves yonder."</P>
<P>"Now it retreats, and trembles in a
lengthening line upon the waters," said
Vivaldi. "We have been too ready to be∣lieve
what we wish and have yet far to
go."</P>
<P>The shore they were approaching form∣ed
a spacious bay for the lake, immediate∣ly
below. Dark woods seemed to spread
along the banks, and ascend among the
cultivated slopes towards the mountains;
except where, here and there, cliffs, bend∣ing
over the water, were distinguished
through the twilight by the whiteness of
their limestone precipices. Within the
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
bay, the town became gradually visible;
lights twinkled between the trees, appear∣ing
and vanishing; like the stars of a cloudy
night; and, at length was heard the me∣lancholy
song of boatmen, who were fish∣ing
near the shore.</P>
<P>Other sounds soon after struck the ear.
"O, what merry notes!" exclaimed Paulo,
"they make my heart dance. See! Sigr∣nora,
there is a group, footing it away so
gaily on the bank of the lake, yonder, by
those trees. O, what a merry set! Would
I were among them! that is, I mean, if
you, <HI>Maestro,</HI> and the Signora were not
here."</P>
<P>"Well corrected, Paulo."</P>
<P>"It is a festival, I fancy," observed Vi∣valdi.
"These peasants of the lake can
make the moments fly as gaily as the vo∣luptuaries
of the city, it seems."</P>
<P>"O! what merry music!" repeated
Paulo. "Ah! how often I have footed it
as joyously on the beach at Naples, after
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
sun-set, of a fine night, like this; with
such a pleasant fresh breeze to cool one!
Ah! there are none like the fishermen of
Naples for a dance by moonlight; how
lightly they do trip it! O! if I was but
there now! That is, I mean, if you,
<HI>Maestro,</HI> and the Signora were there too.
O! what merry notes!"</P>
<P>"We thank you, good Signor Paulo,"
said Vivaldi, "and I trust we shall all be
there soon; when you shall trip it away,
with as joyous an heart as the best of
them."</P>
<P>The travellers now entered the town,
which consisted of one street, straggling
along the margin of the lake; and having
enquired for the Ursaline convent, were
directed to it's gates. The portress ap∣peared
immediately upon-the ringing of the
bell, and carried a message to the Ab∣bess,
who as quickly returned an invita∣tion
to Ellena. She alighted, and fol∣lowed
the portress to the parlour, while
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
Vivaldi remained at the gate, till he should
know whether she approved of her new
lodging. A second invitation induced him,
also, to alight; he was admitted to the
grate, and offered refreshment, which,
however, he declined staying to accept,
as he had yet a lodging to seek for the
night. The Abbess, on learning this cir∣cumstance,
courteously recommended him
to a neighbouring society of Benedictines,
and desired him to mention her name to
the Abbot.</P>
<P>Vivaldi then took leave of Ellena, and,
though it was only for a few hours, he left
her with dejection, and with some degree
of apprehension for her safety, which,
though circumstances could not justify
him in admitting, he could not entirely
subdue. She shared his dejection, but not
his fears, when the door closed after him,
and she found herself once more among
strangers. The forlornness of her feelings
could not be entirely overcome by the at∣tentions
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
of the Abbess; and there was a
degree of curiosity, and even of scrutiny,
expressed in the looks of some of the sisters,
which seemed more than was due to a
stranger. From such examination she
eagerly escaped to the apartment allotted
for her, and to the repose from which she
had so long been withheld.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, meanwhile, had found an hos∣pitable
reception with the Benedictines,
whose sequestered situation made the visit
of a stranger a pleasurable novelty to
them. In the eagerness of conversation,
and, yielding to the satisfaction which the
mind receives from exercising ideas that
have long slept in dusky indolence, and
to the pleasure of admitting new ones, the
Abbot and a few of the brothers sat with
Vivaldi to a late hour. When, at length,
the traveller was suffered to retire, other
subjects than those, which had interested
his host, engaged his thoughts; and he
revolved the means of preventing the
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
misery that threatened him, in a serious
separation from Ellena. Now, that she
was received into a respectable asylum,
every motive for silence upon this topic
was done away. He determined, there∣fore,
that on the following morning, he
would urge all his reasons and entreaties
for an immediate marriage; and among
the brothers of the Benedictine, he had
little doubt of prevailing with one to so∣lemnize
the nuptials, which he believed
would place his happiness and Ellena's
peace, beyond the influence of malignant
possibilities.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE Vivaldi and Ellena were on
the way from San Stefano, the Marchese
Vivaldi was suffering the utmost vexation,
respecting his son; and the Marchesa felt
not less apprehension, that the abode of
Ellena might be discovered; yet this
fear did not withhold her from mingling
in all the gaieties of Naples. Her assem∣blies
were, as usual, among the most
brilliant of that voluptuous city, and she
patronized, as zealously as before, the
strains of her favourite composer. But,
notwithstanding this perpetual dissipation,
her thoughts frequently withdrew them∣selves
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
from the scene, and dwelt on gloomy
forebodings of disappointed pride.</P>
<P>A circumstance, which rendered her
particularly susceptible to such disappoint∣ment
at this time, was, that overtures of
alliance had been lately made to the Mar∣chese,
by the father of a lady, who was held
suitable, in every consideration, to become
his daughter; and whose wealth rendered
the union particularly desirable at a time,
when the expences of such an establish∣ment
as was necessary to the vanity of the
Marchesa, considerably exceeded his in∣come,
large as it was.</P>
<P>The Marchesa's temper had been thus
irritated by the contemplation of her son's
conduct in an affair, which so materially
affected the fortune, and, as she believed,
the honour of his family; when a courier
from the Abbess of San Stefano brought
intelligence of the flight of Ellena with Vi∣valdi.
She was in a disposition, which
heightened disappointment into fury; and
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
she forfeited, by the transports to which
she yielded, the degree of pity that other∣wise
was due to a mother, who believed
her only son to have sacrificed his family and
himself to an unworthy passion. She be∣lieved,
that he was now married, and irre∣coverably
lost. Scarcely able to endure
the agony of this conviction, she sent for
her ancient adviser Schedoni, that she
might, at least, have the relief of express∣ing
her emotions; and of examining whe∣ther
there remained a possibility of dissolv∣ing
these long-dreaded nuptials. The
phrenzy of passion, however, did not so far
overcome her circumspection as to compel
her to acquaint the Marchese with the
contents of the Abbess's letter, before she
had consulted with her Confessor. She
knew that the principles of her husband
were too just, upon the grand points of
morality, to suffer him to adopt the mea∣sures
she might judge necessary; and she
avoided informing him of the marriage of
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
his son, until the means of counteracting
it should have been suggested and accom∣plished,
however desperate such means
might be.</P>
<P>Schedoni was not to be found. Tri∣fling
circumstances encrease the irritation
of a mind in such a state as was her's.
The delay of an opportunity for unbur∣thening
her heart to Schedoni, was hardly
to be endured; another and another
messenger were dispatched to her Con∣fessor.</P>
<P>"My mistress has committed some
great sin, truely!" said the servant, who
had been twice to the convent, within the
last half hour. "It must lie heavy on
her conscience, in good truth, since she
cannot support it for one half hour. Well!
the rich have this comfort, however, that,
let them be ever so guilty, they can buy
themselves innocent again, in the twink∣ling
of a ducat. Now a poor man might
be a month before he recovered his inno∣cence,
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
and that, too, not till after many a∣bout
of hard flogging.".</P>
<P>In the evening Schedoni came, but it
was only to confirm her worst fear. He,
too, had heard of the escape of Ellena, as
well as that she was on the lake of Celano,
and was married to Vivaldi. How he had
obtained this information he did not chuse
to disclose, but he mentioned so many mi∣nute
circumstances in confirmation of it's
truth, and appeared to be so perfectly con∣vinced
of the facts he related, that the
Marchesa believed them, as implicitly as
himself; and her passion and despair trans∣gressed
all bounds of decorum;</P>
<P>Schedoni observed, with dark and silent
pleasure, the turbulent excess of her feel∣ings;
and perceived that the moment was
now arrived, when he might command
them to his purpose, so as to render his
assistance indispensable to her repose; and
probably so as to accomplish the revenge
he had long meditated against Vivaldi,
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
without hazarding the favour of the Mar∣chesa.
So far was he from attempting to
sooth her sufferings, that he continued to
irritate her resentment, and exasperate her
pride; effecting this, at the same time,
with such imperceptible art, that he ap∣peared
only to be palliating the conduct of
Vivaldi, and endeavouring to console his
distracted mother.</P>
<P>"This is a rash step, certainly," said
the Confessor;" but he is young, very
young, and, therefore, does not foresee the
consequence to which it leads. He does
not perceive how seriously it will affect the
dignity of his house;—how much it will
depreciate his consequence with the court,
with the nobles of his own rank, and even
with the plebeians, with whom he has con∣descended
to connect himself. Intoxi∣cated
with the passions of youth, he does
not weigh the value of those blessings,
which wisdom and the experience of ma∣turer
age know how to estimate. He ne∣glects
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
them <HI>only</HI> because he does not per∣ceive
their influence in society, and that
lightly to resign them, is to degrade him∣self
in the view of almost every mind.
Unhappy young man! he is to be pitied
fully as much as blamed."</P>
<P>"Your excuses, reverend father," said
the tortured Marchesa, "prove the good∣ness
of your heart; but they illustrate,
also, the degeneracy of his mind, and detail
the full extent of the effects which he has
brought upon his family. It affords me
no consolation to know, that this degra∣dation
proceeds from his head, rather than
his heart; it is sufficient that he has in∣curred
it, and that no possibility remains
of throwing off the misfortune."
"Perhaps that is affirming too much,"
observed Schedoni.</P>
<P>"How, father!" said the Marchesa.</P>
<P>"Perhaps a possibility does remain,"
said he.</P>
<P>"Point it out to me, good father! I
do not perceive it."
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
"Nay, my lady," replied the subtle
Schedoni, correcting himself, "I am by no
means assured, that such possibility does
exist. My solicitude for your tranquillity,
and for the honour of your house, makes
me so unwilling to relinquish hope, that,
perhaps, I only imagine a possibility in your
favour. Let me consider.—Alas! the
misfortune, severe as it is, must be en∣dured;
—there remain no means of escap∣ing
from it."</P>
<P>"It was cruel of you, father, to suggest
a hope which you could not justify," ob∣served
the Marchesa.</P>
<P>"You must excuse my extreme solici∣tude,
then," replied the Confessor. "But
how is it possible for me to fee a family of
your ancient estimation brought into such
circumstances; its honours blighted by
the folly of a thoughtless boy, without feel∣ing
sorrow and indignation, and looking
round for even some desperate means of
delivering it from disgrace." He paused.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110"/>
"Disgrace!" exclaimed the Marchesa;
"father, you—you—Disgrace!—The
word is a strong one, but—it is, alas!
just. And shall we submit to this?—Is
it possible we <HI>can</HI> submit to it?"</P>
<P>"There is no remedy," said Schedoni,
coolly.</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed the Marche∣sa,
"that there should be no law to pre∣vent,
or, at least, to punish such criminal
marriages!"</P>
<P>"It is much to be lamented," replied
Schedoni.</P>
<P>"The woman who obtrudes herself up∣on
a family, to dishonour it," continued
the Marchesa, "deserves a punishment
nearly equal to that of a state criminal,
since she injures those who best support
the state. She ought to suffer"—</P>
<P>"Not nearly, but quite equal, "inter∣rupted
the Confessor, "she deserves—death!"</P>
<P>He paused, and there was a moment
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
of profound silence, till he added—"for
death only can obliviate the degradation
she has occasioned; her death alone can
restore the original splendor of the line she
would have sullied."</P>
<P>He paused again, but the Marchesa still
remaining silent, he added, "I have often
marvelled that our lawgivers should have
failed to perceive the justness, nay the ne∣cessity,
of such punishment!"</P>
<P>"It is astonishing," said the Marchesa,
thoughtfully, "that a regard for their own
honour did not suggest it."</P>
<P>"Justice does not the less exist, because
her laws are neglected," observed Schedoni.
A sense of what she commands lives in our
breasts; and when we fail to obey that sense,
it is to weakness, not to virtue, that we
yield."</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied the Marchesa,
"that truth never yet was doubted;"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, I am not so certain as to
that," said the Confessor, "when justice
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
happens to oppose prejudice, we are apt to
believe it virtuous to disobey her. For in∣stance,
though the law of justice demands
the death of this girl, yet because the law
of the land forbears to enforce it, you, my
daughter, even you! though possessed of a
man's spirit, and his clear perceptions,
would think that virtue bade her live, when
it was only fear!"</P>
<P>"Hah!" exclaimed the Marchesa, in a
low voice, "What is that you mean? You
shall find I have a man's courage also."</P>
<P>"I speak without disguise," replied Sche∣doni,
"my meaning requires none."</P>
<P>The Marchesa mused, and remained
silent.</P>
<P>"I have done my duty," resumed Sche∣doni,
at length. "I have pointed out the
only way that remains for you to escape
dishonour. If my zeal is displeasing—but
I have done."</P>
<P>" No, good father, no," said the Mar∣chesa;
you mistake the cause of my emo∣tion.
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
New ideas, new prospects, open!—they
confuse, they distract me! My mind
has not yet attained sufficient strength to
encounter them; some woman's weakness
still lingers at my heart."</P>
<P>"Pardon my inconsiderate zeal," said
Schedoni, with affected humility, "I hBve
been to blame. If your's is a weakness, it
is, at least, an amiable one, and, perhaps,
deserves to be encouraged, rather than
conquered."</P>
<P>"How, father! If it deserves encou∣ragement,
it is not a weakness, but a vir∣tue.".</P>
<P>"Be it so," said Schedoni, coolly, "the
interest I have felt on this subject, has,
perhaps, misled my judgment, and has
made me unjust. Think no more of it,
or, if you do, let it be only to pardon the
zeal I have testified."</P>
<P>"It does not deserve pardon, but
thanks," replied the Marchesa, "not thanks
only, but reward. Good father, I hope it
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
will some time be in my power to prove
the sincerity of my words."</P>
<P>The Confessor bowed his head.</P>
<P>"I trust that the services you have ren∣dered
me, shall be gratefully repaid—re∣warded,
I dare not hope, for what benefit
could possibly reward a service so vast, as it
may, perhaps, be in your power to confer
upon my family! What recompence could
be balanced against the benefit of having
rescued the honour of an ancient house!"</P>
<P>"Your goodness is beyond my thanks,
or my desert," said Schedoni, and he was
again silent.</P>
<P>The Marchesa wished him to lead her
back to the point, from which she herself
had deviated, and he seemed determined,
that she should lead him thither. She
mused, and hesitated. Her mind was not
yet familiar with atrocious guilt; and the
crime which Schedoni had suggested, some∣what
alarmed her. She feared to think,
and still more to name it; yet, so acutely
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
susceptible was her pride, so stern her in∣dignation,
and so profound her desire of
vengeance, that her mind was tossed as on
a tempestuous ocean, and these terrible
feelings threatened to overwhelm all the
residue of humanity in her heart. Sche∣doni
observed all its progressive move∣ments,
and, like a gaunt tyger, lurked in
silence, ready to spring forward at the mo∣ment
of opportunity.</P>
<P>"It is your advice, then, father," re∣sumed
the Marchesa, after a long pause,—"it
is your opinion—that Ellena."—She
hesitated, desirous that Schedoni
should anticipate her meaning; but he
chose to spare his own delicacy rather than
that of the Marchesa.</P>
<P>"You think, then, that this insidious
girl deserves"—She paused again, but
the Confessor, still silent, seemed to wait
with submission for what the Marchesa
should deliver.</P>
<P>"I repeat, father, that it is your opi∣nion
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
this girl deserves severe punish∣ment."—</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly," replied Schedoni, "Is
it not also your own?"</P>
<P>"That not any punishment can be too
severe?" continued the Marchesa. "That
justice, equally with necessity, demands
—her life? Is not this your opinion
too?"</P>
<P>"O! pardon me," said Schedoni, "I
may have erred; that only <HI>was</HI> my opi∣nion;
and when I formed it, I was proba∣bly
too much under the influence of zeal
to be just. When the heart is warm, how
is it possible that the judgment can be
cool."</P>
<P>"It is <HI>not</HI> then, your opinion, holy fa∣ther,"
said the Marchesa with displeasure.</P>
<P>"I do not absolutely say that," replied
the Confessor.—But I leave it to your bet∣ter
judgment to decide upon its justness."</P>
<P>As he said this, he rose to depart. The
Marchesa was agitated and perplexed,
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
and requested he would stay; but he ex∣cused
himself by alledging, that it was
the hour when he must attend a particular
mass.</P>
<P>"Well then, holy father, I will occupy
no more of your valuable moments at pre∣sent;
but you know how highly I estimate
your advice, and will not refuse, when I
shall at some future time request it.</P>
<P>"I cannot refuse to accept an honour,"
replied the Confessor, with an air of meek∣ness,
"but the subject you allude to is
delicate"—</P>
<P>"And therefore I must value, and re∣quire
your opinion upon it," rejoined the
Marchesa.</P>
<P>"I would wish you to value your own,"
replied Schedoni; "you cannot have a
better director."</P>
<P>"You flatter, father."</P>
<P>"I only reply, my daughter."</P>
<P>"On the evening of to-morrow," said
the Marchesa, gravely, "I shall be at vespers
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
in the church of San Nicolo; if you should
happen to be there, you will probably see
me, when the service is over, and the con∣gregation
is departed, in the north cloister.
We can there converse on the subject
nearest my heart, and without observation.
—Farewell!"</P>
<P>"Peace be with you, daughter! and
wisdom council your thoughts!" said Sche∣doni,
"I will not fail to visit San Nicolo."</P>
<P>He folded his hands upon his breast,
bowed his head, and left the apartment
with the silent footstep, that indicates wea∣riness
and conscious duplicity.</P>
<P>The Marchesa remained in her closet,
shaken by ever-varying passions, and ever-fluctuating
opinions; meditating misery
for others, and inflicting it only upon
herself.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Marchesa repaired, according to
her appointment, to the church of San Ni∣colo,
and, ordering her servants to remain
with the carriage at a side-door, entered the
choir, attended only by her woman.</P>
<P>When vespers had concluded, she lin∣gered
till nearly every person had quitted
the choir, and then walked through the so∣litary
aisles to the north cloister. Her
heart was as heavy as her step; for when
is it that peace and evil passions dwell to∣gether?
As she slowly paced the cloisters,
she perceived a monk passing between the
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
pillars, who, as he approached, lifted his
cowl, and she knew him to be Schedoni.</P>
<P>He instantly observed the agitation of
her spirits, and that her purpose was not
yet determined, according to his hope.
But, though his mind became clouded, his
countenance remained unaltered; it was
grave and thoughtful. The sternness of
his vulture-eye was, however, somewhat
softened, and its lids were contracted by
subtlety.</P>
<P>The Marchesa bade her woman walk
apart, while she conferred with her Con∣fessor.</P>
<P>"This unhappy boy," said she, when
the attendant was at some distance, "How
much suffering does his folly inflict upon
his family! My good father, I have need
of all your advice and consolation. My
mind is perpetually haunted by a sense of
my misfortune; it has no respite; awake
or in my dream, this ungrateful son alike
pursues me! The only relief my heart re∣ceives
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
is when conversing with you—my
only counsellor, my only disinterested
friend."</P>
<P>The Confessor bowed. "The Marchese
is, no doubt, equally afflicted with your∣self,"
said he; "but he is, notwithstand∣ing,
much more competent to advise you
on this delicate subject than I am."</P>
<P>"The Marchese has prejudices, father,
as you well know; he is a sensible man,
but he is sometimes mistaken, and he is
incorrigible in error. He has the faults of
a mind that is merely well disposed; he is
destitute of the discernment and the ener∣gy
which would make it great. If it is
necessary to adopt a conduct, that departs
in the smallest degree from those common
rules of morality which he has cherished,
without examining them, from his infancy,
he is shocked, and shrinks from action.
He cannot discriminate the circumstances,
that render the same action virtuous or
vicious. How then, father, are we to sup∣pose
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
he would approve of the bold inflic∣tions
we meditate?"</P>
<P>"Most true!" said the artful Schedoni,
with an air of admiration.</P>
<P>"We, therefore, must not consult him,"
continued the Marchesa," lest he should
now, as formerly, advance and maintain
objections, to which we cannot yield.
What passes in conversation with you,
father, is sacred, it goes no farther."</P>
<P>"Sacred as a confession!" said Schedoni,
crossing himself.</P>
<P>"I know not,"—resumed the Marche∣sa,
and hesitated; "I know not"—she re∣peated
in a yet lower voice, "how this girl
may be disposed of; and this it is which
distracts my mind."</P>
<P>"I marvel much at that," said Schedo∣ni.
"With opinions so singularly just,
with a mind so accurate, yet so bold as you
have displayed, is it possible that you can
hesitate as to what is to be done! You, my
daughter, will not prove yourself one of
those ineffectual declaimers, who can think
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
vigorously, but cannot act so! One way,
only, remains for you to pursue, in the
present instance; it is the same which your
superior sagacity pointed out, and taught
me to approve. Is it necessary for me
to persuade <HI>her,</HI> by whom I am con∣vinced!
There is only one way."</P>
<P>"And on that I have been long medi∣tating,"
replied the Marchesa, "and, shall
I own my weakness? I cannot yet decide."</P>
<P>"My daughter! can it be possible that
you should want courage to soar above vul∣gar
prejudice, in action, though not in
opinion?" said Schedoni, who, perceiving
that his assistance was necessary to fix her
fluctuating mind, gradually began to steal
forth from the prudent reserve, in which he
had taken shelter.</P>
<P>"If this person was condemned by the
law," he continued, "you would pro∣nounce
her sentence to be just; yet you
dare not, I am humbled while I re∣peat
it, you dare not dispense justice your∣self!"</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124"/>
The Marchesa, after some hesitation,
said, "I have not the shield of the law to
protect me, father: and the boldest virtue
may pause, when it reaches the utmost
verge of safety."</P>
<P>"Never!" replied the Confessor, warmly;
"virtue never trembles; it is her glory,
and sublimest attribute to be superior to
danger; to despise it. The best principle
is not virtue till it reaches this elevation."</P>
<P>A philosopher might, perhaps, have
been surprized to hear two persons serious∣ly
defining the limits of virtue, at the very
moment in which they meditated the most
atrocious crime; a man of the world
would have considered it to be mere hypo∣crisy;
a supposition which might have dis∣closed
his general knowledge of manners,
but would certainly have betrayed his
ignorance of the human heart.</P>
<P>The Marchesa was for some time silent
and thoughtful, and then repeated delibe∣rately,
"I have not the shield of the law
to protect me."</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125"/>
"But you have the shield of the
church," replied Schedoni; "you should
not only have protection, but absolution."</P>
<P>"Absolution!—Does virtue—justice,
require absolution, father?"</P>
<P>"When I mentioned absolution for the
action which you perceive to be so just and
necessary," replied Schedoni, "I accom∣modated
my speech to vulgar prejudice,
and to vulgar weakness. And, forgive me,
that since you, my daughter, descended
from the loftiness of your spirit to regret
the shield of the law, I endeavoured to
console you, by offering a shield to con∣science.
But enough of this; let us re∣turn
to argument. This girl is put out of
the way of committing more mischief, of
injuring the peace and dignity of a distin∣guished
family; she is sent to an eternal
sleep, before her time.—Where is the
crime, where is the evil of this? On the
contrary, you perceive, and you have con∣vinced
me, that it is only strict justice,
only self-defence."</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126"/>
The Marchesa was attentive, and the
Confessor added, "She is not immortal;
and the few years more, that might have
been allotted her, she deserves to forfeit,
since she would have employed them in
cankering the honour of an illustrious house."</P>
<P>"Speak low, father," said the Marche∣sa,
though he spoke almost in a whisper;
"the cloister appears solitary, yet some
person may lurk behind those pillars.
Advise me how this business may be ma∣naged;
I am ignorant of the particular
means."</P>
<P>"There is some hazard in the accom∣plishment
of it, I grant," replied Schedo∣ni;
"I know not whom you may confide
in.—The men who make a trade of
blood"—</P>
<P>"Hush!" said the Marchesa, looking
round through the twilight—"a step!"</P>
<P>"It is the Friar's, yonder, who crosses to
the choir," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127"/>
They were watchful for a few moments,
and then he resumed the subject. "Mer∣cenaries
ought not to be trusted,"—</P>
<P>"Yet who but mercenaries"—inter∣rupted
the Marchesa, and instantly checked
herself. But the question thus implied,
did not escape the Confessor.</P>
<P>"Pardon my astonishment," said he,
"at the inconsistency, or, what shall I ven∣ture
to call it? of your opinions! After
the acuteness you have displayed on some
points, is it possible you can doubt, that
principle may both prompt and perform
the deed? Why should we hesitate to do
what we judge to be right?"</P>
<P>"Ah! reverend father," said the Mar∣chesa,
with emotion," but where shall we
find another like yourself—another, who
not only can perceive with justness, but
will act with energy."</P>
<P>Schedoni was silent.</P>
<P>"Such a friend is above all estimation;
but where shall we seek him?"</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="128"/>
"Daughter!" said the Monk, emphati∣cally,
"my zeal for your family is also
above all calculation."</P>
<P>"Good father," replied the Marchesa,
comprehending his full meaning, "I know
not how to thank you."</P>
<P>"Silence is sometimes eloquence," said
Schedoni, significantly.</P>
<P>The Marchesa mused; for her con∣science
also was eloquent. She tried to
overcome its voice, but it would be heard;
and sometimes such starts of horrible con∣viction
came over her mind, that she felt
as one who, awaking from a dream, opens
his eyes only to measure the depth of the
precipice on which he totters. In such
moments she was astonished, that she had
paused for an instant upon a subject so
terrible as that of murder. The sophistry
of the Confessor, together with the incon∣sistencies
which he had betrayed, and
which had not escaped the notice of the
Marchesa, even at the time they were ut∣tered,
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
though she had been unconscious of
her own, then became more strongly appa∣rent,
and she almost determined to suffer
the poor Ellena to live. But returning
passion, like a wave that has recoiled from
the shore, afterwards came with recollect∣ed
energy, and swept from her feeble mind
the barriers, which reason and conscience
had begun to rear.</P>
<P>"This confidence with which you have
thought proper to honour me," said Sche∣doni,
at length, and paused; "This affair,
so momentous"—</P>
<P>"Ay, this affair," interrupted the Mar∣chesa,
in a hurried manner,—"but when,
and where, good father? Being once con∣vinced,
I am anxious to have it settled."</P>
<P>"That must be as occasion offers," re∣plied
the Monk, thoughtfully.—"On the
shore of the Adriatic, in the province of
Apulia, not far from Manfredonia, is a
house that might suit the purpose. It is
a lone dwelling on the beach, and con∣cealed
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
from travellers, among the forests,
which spread for many miles along the
coast."</P>
<P>"And the people?" said the Marchesa.</P>
<P>"Ay, daughter, or why travel so far as
Apulia? It is inhabited by one poor man,
who sustains a miserable existence by fish∣ing.
I know him, and could unfold the
reasons of his solitary life;—but no mat∣ter,
it is sufficient that <HI>I know him.".</HI></P>
<P>"And would trust him, father?"</P>
<P>"Ay, lady, with the life of this girl—though
scarcely with my own."</P>
<P>"How! If he is such a villain he may not
be trusted! think further. But now, you
objected to a mercenary, yet this man is
one!"</P>
<P>"Daughter, he may be trusted, when it
is in such a case; he is safe and sure. I
have reason to know him."</P>
<P>"Name your reasons, father."</P>
<P>The Confessor was silent, and his coun∣tenance
assumed a very peculiar character;
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
it was more terrible than usual, and over∣spread
with a dark, cadaverous hue of
mingled anger and guilt. The Marchesa
started involuntarily as, passing by a win∣dow,
the evening gleam that fell there, dis∣covered
it; and for the first time she wish∣ed,
that she had not committed herself so
wholly to his power. But the die was now
cast; it was too late to be prudent; and
she again demanded his reasons.</P>
<P>"No matter," said Schedoni, in a stifled
voice—"she dies!"</P>
<P>"By his hands?" asked the Marchesa,
with strong emotion. "Think, once more,
father."</P>
<P>They were both again silent and thought∣ful.
The Marchesa, at length, said, "Fa∣ther,
I rely upon your integrity and pru∣dence;"
and she laid a very flattering em∣phasis
upon the word integrity. "But I
conjure you to let this business be finished
quickly, suspense is to me the purgatory
of this world, and not to trust the accom∣plishment
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
of it to a second person." She
paused, and then added, "I would not
willingly owe so vast a debt of obligation
to any other than yourself."</P>
<P>"Your request, daughter, that I would
not confide this business to a second per∣son,"
said Schedoni, with displeasure, "can∣not
be accorded to. Can you suppose,
that I, myself"—</P>
<P>"Can I doubt that principle may both
prompt and perform the deed," inter∣rupted
the Marchesa with quickness,
and anticipating his meaning, while she
retorted upon him his former words.
"Why should we hesitate to do what we
judge to be right?"</P>
<P>The silence of Schedoni alone indicated
his displeasure, which the Marchesa imme∣diately
understood.</P>
<P>"Consider, good father," she added
significantly, "how painful it must be to
me, to owe to infinite an obligation to
a stranger, or to any other than so highly
valued a friend as yourself."</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133"/>
Schedoni, while he detected her mean∣ing,
and persuaded himself that he despis∣ed
the flattery, with which she so thinly
veiled it, unconsciously suffered his self-love
to be soothed by the compliment.
He bowed his head, in signal of consent to
her wish.</P>
<P>"Avoid violence, if that be possible,"
she added, immediately comprehending
him, "but let her die quickly! The pu∣nishment
is due to the crime."</P>
<P>The Marchesa happened, as she said this,
to cast her eyes upon the inscription over
a Confessional, where appeared, in black
letters, these awful words, "<HI>God hears
thee!".</HI> It appeared an awful warning.
Her countenance changed; it had struck
upon her heart. Schedoni was too much
engaged by his own thoughts to observe,
or understand her silence. She soon reco∣vered
herself; and considering that this
was a common inscription for Confes∣sionals,
disregarded what she had at first
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
considered as a peculiar admonition; yet
some moments elapsed, before she could
renew the subject.</P>
<P>"You was speaking of a place, father,"
resumed the Marchesa—"you men∣tioned
a"—</P>
<P>"Ay," muttered the Confessor, still
musing,—"in a chamber of that house
there is"—</P>
<P>"What noise is that?" said the Mar∣chesa,
interrupting him. They listened. A few low and querulous notes of the
organ sounded at a distance, and stopped
again.</P>
<P>"What mournful music is that?" said
the Marchesa in a faultering voice, "It
was touched by a fearful hand! Vespers
were over long ago!"</P>
<P>"Daughter," said Schedoni, some∣what
sternly, "you said you had a man's
courage. Alas! you have a woman's
heart."</P>
<P>"Excuse me, father; I know not why
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
I feel this agitation, but I will command
it. That chamber?"—</P>
<P>"In that chamber," resumed the Con∣fessor,
"is a secret door, constructed long
ago."—</P>
<P>"And for what purpose constructed?"
said the fearful Marchesa.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, daughter; 'tis sufficient
that it is there; we will make a good use
of it. Through that door—in the night—when
she sleeps"—</P>
<P>"I comprehend you," said the Marche∣sa,
"I comprehend you. But why, you
have your reasons, no doubt, but why the
necessity of a secret door in a house which
you say is so lonely—inhabited by only
one person?"</P>
<P>"A passage leads to the sea," continued
Schedoni, without replying to the ques∣tion.
"There, on the shore, when dark∣ness
covers it; there, plunged amidst the
waves, no stain shall hint of"—</P>
<P>"Hark!" interrupted the Marchesa,
starting, "that note again!"</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136"/>
The organ sounded faintly from the
choir, and paused, as before. In the next
moment, a slow chaunting of voices was
heard, mingling with the rising peal, in a
strain particularly melancholy and so∣lemn.</P>
<P>"Who is dead? said the Marchesa,
changing countenance; "it is a requiem!"</P>
<P>"Peace be with the departed!" ex∣claimed
Schedoni, and crossed himself;
"Peace rest with his soul!"</P>
<P>"Hark! to that chaunt!" said the Mar∣chesa,
in a trembling voice; "it is a first
requiem; the soul has but just quitted
the body!"</P>
<P>They listened in silence. The Marche∣sa
was much affected; her complexion
varied at every instant; her breathings
were short and interrupted, and she even
shed a few tears, but they were those of
despair, rather than of sorrow. "That
body is now cold," said she to herself,
"which but an hour ago was warm and
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
animated! Those fine senses are closed in
death! And to this condition would I re∣duce
a being like myself! Oh, wretched,
wretched mother! to what has the folly of
a son reduced thee!"</P>
<P>She turned from the Confessor, and
walked alone in the cloister. Her agita∣tion
encreased; she wept without restraint,
for her veil and the evening gloom con∣cealed
her, and her sighs were lost amidst
the music of the choir.</P>
<P>Schedoni was scarcely less disturbed,
but his were emotions of apprehension and
contempt. "Behold, what is woman!"
said he—"The slave of her passions, the
dupe of her senses! When pride and re∣venge
speak in her breast, she defies ob∣stacles,
and laughs at crimes! Assail but
her senses, let music, for instance, touch
some feeble chord of her heart, and echo
to her fancy, and lo! all her perceptions
change:—she shrinks from the act she had
but an instant before believed meritorious,
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
yields to some new emotion, and sinks—the
victim of a sound! O, weak and con∣temptible
being!"</P>
<P>The Marchesa, at least, seemed to justi∣fy
his observations. The desperate pas∣sions,
which had resisted every remon∣strance
of reason and humanity, were van∣quished
only by other passions; and, her
senses touched by the mournful melody of
music, and her superstitious fears awaken∣ed
by the occurrence of a requiem for the
dead, at the very moment when she was
planning murder, she yielded, for a while,
to the united influence of pity and terror.
Her agitation did not subside; but she
returned to the Confessor.</P>
<P>"We will converse on this business at
some future time," said she; "at present,
my spirits are disordered. Good night,
father! Remember me in your ori∣sons."</P>
<P>"Peace be with you, lady!" said
the Confessor, bowing gravely, "You
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
shall not be forgotten. Be resolute, and
yourself."</P>
<P>The Marchesa beckoned her woman to
approach, when, drawing her veil closer,
and leaning upon the attendant's arm, she
left the cloister. Schedoni remained for
a moment on the spot, looking after her,
till her figure was lost in the gloom of the
long perspective; he then, with thought∣ful
steps, quitted the cloister by another
door. He was disappointed, but he did
not despair.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE the Marchesa and the Monk
were thus meditating conspiracies against
Ellena, she was still in the Ursaline con∣vent
on the lake of Celano. In this ob∣scure
sanctuary, indisposition, the conse∣quence
of the long and severe anxiety she
had suffered, compelled her to remain. A
fever was on her spirits, and an universal
lassitude prevailed over her frame; which
became the more effectual, from her very
solicitude to conquer it. Every approach∣ing
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
day she hoped she should be able to
pursue her journey homeward, yet every day
found her as incapable of travelling as the
last, and the second week was already gone,
before the fine air of Celano, and the tran∣quillity
of her asylum, began to revive her.
Vivaldi, who was her daily visitor at the
grate of the convent; and who, watching
over her with intense solicitude, had hi∣therto
forbore to renew a subject, which,
by agitating her spirits, might affect her
health, now, that her health strengthened,
ventured gradually to mention his fears left
the place of her retreat should be disco∣vered,
and left he yet might irrecoverably
lose her, unless she would approve of their
speedy marriage. At every visit he now
urged the subject, represented the dangers
that surrounded them, and repeated his ar∣guments
and entreaties; for now, when
he believed that time was pressing forward
fatal evils, he could no longer attend to
the delicate scruples, that bade him be
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
sparing in entreaty. Ellena, had she obey∣ed
the dictates of her heart, would have
rewarded his attachment and his services,
by a frank approbation of his proposal;
but the objections which reason exhibited
against such a concession, she could neither
overcome or disregard.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after he had again represented
their present dangers, and claimed the pro∣mise
of her hand, received in the presence
of her deceased relative, Signora Bianchi,
gently ventured to remind her, that an
event as sudden as lamentable, had first
deferred their nuptials, and that if Bianchi
had lived, Ellena would have bestowed,
long since, the vows he now solicited.
Again he intreated her, by every sacred and
tender recollection, to conclude the fearful
uncertainty of their fate, and to bestow up∣on
him the right to protect her, before they
ventured forth from this temporary asylum.</P>
<P>Ellena immediately admitted the sacred∣ness
of the promise, which she had formerly
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
given, and assured Vivaldi that she consi∣dered
herself as indissolubly bound to wed
him as if it had been given at the altar;
but she objected to a confirmation of it,
till his family should seem willing to re∣ceive
her for their daughter; when, forget∣ting
the injuries she had received from
them, she would no longer refuse their al∣liance.
She added, that Vivaldi ought to
be more jealous of the dignity of the wo∣man,
whom he honoured with his esteem,
than to permit her making a greater con∣cession.</P>
<P>Vivaldi felt the full force of this appeal;
he recollected, with anguish, circum∣stances
of which she was happily ignorant,
but which served to strengthen with him
the justness of her reproof. And, as the
aspersions which the Marchese had thrown
upon her name, crowded to his memory,
pride and indignation swelled his heart,
and so far overcame apprehension of ha∣zard,
that he formed a momentary resolu∣tion
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
to abandon every other consideration,
to that of asserting the respect which was
due to Ellena, and to forbear, claiming her
for his wife, till his family should make
acknowledgment of their error, and wil∣lingly
admit her in the rank of their child.
But this resolution was as transient as
plausible; other considerations, and for∣mer
fears pressed upon him. He per∣ceived
the strong improbability, that they
would ever make a voluntary sacrifice of
their pride to his love; or yield mistakes,
nurtured by prejudice and by willing indul∣gence,
to truth and a sense of justice. In
the mean time, the plans, which would be
formed for separating him from Ellena,
might succeed, and he should lose her for
ever. Above all, it appeared, that the best,
the only method, which remained for con∣futing
the daring aspersions that had af∣fected
her name, was, by proving the high
respect he himself felt for her, and present∣ing
her to the world in the sacred charac∣ter
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
of his wife. These considerations
quickly determined him to persevere in
his suit; but it was impossible to urge
them to Ellena, since the circumstances
they must unfold, would not only shock
her delicacy and afflict her heart, but
would furnish the proper pride she cherish∣ed
with new arguments against approach∣ing
a family, who had thus grossly insulted
her.</P>
<P>While these considerations occupied
him, the emotion they occasioned did not
escape Ellena's observation; it encreased,
as he reflected on the impossibility of urg∣ing
them to her, and on the hopelessness
of prevailing with her, unless he could pro∣duce
new arguments in his favour. His
unaffected distress awakened all her ten∣derness
and gratitude; she asked herself
whether she ought any longer to assert
her own rights, when by doing so, she sa∣crificed
the peace of him, who had incur∣red
so much danger for her sake, who had
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
rescued her from severe oppression, and had
so long and so well proved the strength
of his affection.</P>
<P>As she applied these questions, she ap∣peared
to herself an unjust and selfish be∣ing,
unwilling to make any sacrifice for the
tranquillity of him, who had given her
liberty, even at the risk of his life. Her
very virtues, now that they were carried
to excess, seemed to her to border upon
vices; her sense of dignity, appeared to be
narrow pride; her delicacy weakness; her
moderated affection cold ingratitude; and
her circumspection, little less than pru∣dence
degenerated into meanness.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as apt in admitting hope as fear,
immediately perceived her resolution be∣ginning
to yield, and he urged again every
argument which was likely to prevail over
it. But the subject was too important
for Ellena, to be immediately decided
upon; he departed with only a faint as∣surance
of encouragement; and she for∣bade
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
him to return till the following day,
when she would acquaint him with her
final determination.</P>
<P>This interval was, perhaps, the most
painful he had ever experienced. Alone,
and on the banks of the lake, he passed
many hours in alternate hope and fear;
in endeavouring to anticipate the decision,
on which seemed suspended all his future
peace, and abruptly recoiling from it, as
often as imagination represented it to be
adverse.</P>
<P>Of the walls, that enclosed her, he
scarcely ever lost sight; the view of them
seemed to cherish his hopes, and, while he
gazed upon their rugged surface, Ellena
alone was pictured on his fancy; till his
anxiety to learn her disposition towards him
arose to agony, and he would abruptly leave
the spot. But an invisible spell still seemed
to attract him back again, and evening
found him pacing slowly beneath the shade
of those melancholy boundaries that con∣cealed
his Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148"/>
Her day was not more tranquil. When∣ever
prudence and decorous pride forbade
her to become a member of the Vivaldi
family, as constantly did gratitude, affec∣tion,
irresistible tenderness plead the cause
of Vivaldi The memory of past times re∣turned;
and the very accents of the deceas∣ed
seemed to murmur from the grave, and
command her to fulfil the engagement,
which had soothed the dying moments of
Bianchi.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Vivaldi was
at the gates of the convent, long before the
appointed hour, and he lingered in dreadful
impatience, till the clock struck the signal
for his entrance.</P>
<P>Ellena was already in the parlour; she
was alone, and rose in disorder on his ap∣proach.
His steps faultered, his voice was
lost, and his eyes only, which he fixed with
a wild earnestness on her's, had power to
enquire her resolution. She observed the
paleness of his countenance, and his emo∣tion,
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
with a mixture of concern and ap∣probation.
At that moment, he perceived
her smile, and hold out her hand to him;
and fear, care, and doubt vanished at once
from his mind. He was incapable of
thanking her, but sighed deeply as he
pressed her hand, and, overcome with joy,
supported himself against the grate that
separated them.</P>
<P>"You are, then, indeed my own!" said
Vivaldi, at length recovering his voice—"We
shall be no more parted—you are
mine for ever! But your countenance
changes! O heaven! surely I have not
mistaken! Speak! I conjure you, Ellena;
relieve me from these terrible doubts!"</P>
<P>"I am yours, Vivaldi," replied Ellena
faintly, "oppression can part us no more."</P>
<P>She wept, and drew her veil over her
eyes.</P>
<P>"What mean those tears?" said Vival∣di,
with alarm. "Ah! Ellena," he added
in a softened voice, "should tears mingle
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
with such moments as these! Should your
tears fall upon my heart now! They tell
me, that your consent is given with reluc∣tance—with
grief; that your love is fee∣ble,
your heart—yes Ellena! that your
whole heart is no longer mine!"</P>
<P>"They ought rather to tell you," re∣plied
Ellena, "that it is all your own;
that my affection never was more powerful
than now, when it can overcome every
consideration with respect to your family,
and urge me to a step which must degrade
me in their eyes,—and, I fear, in my own."</P>
<P>"O retract that cruel assertion!" inter∣rupted
Vivaldi, "Degrade you in your
own!—degrade you in their eyes!" He
was much agitated; his countenance was
flushed, and an air of more than usual
dignity dilated his figure.</P>
<P>"The time shall come, my Ellena," he
added with energy, "when they shall un∣derstand
your worth, and acknowledge
your excellence. O! that I were an Em∣peror,
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
that I might shew to all the world
how much I love and honour you!"</P>
<P>Ellena gave him her hand, and, with∣drawing
her veil, smiled on him through
her tears, with gratitude and reviving cou∣rage.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi retired to the convent,
he obtained her consent to consult with an
aged Benedictine, whom he had engaged
in his interest, as to the hour at which the
marriage might be solemnized with least
observation. The priest informed him,
that at the conclusion of the vesper-service,
he should be disengaged for several hours;
and that, as the first hour after sun-set was
more solitary than almost any other, the
brotherhood being then assembled in the
refectory, he would meet Vivaldi and El∣lena
at that time, in a chapel on the edge
of the lake, a short distance from the Bene∣dictine
convent, to which it belonged,
and celebrate their nuptials.</P>
<P>With this proposal, Vivaldi imme∣diately
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
returned to Ellena; when it was
agreed that the party should assemble at
the hour mentioned by the priest. Ellena,
who had thought it proper to mention her
intention to the Abbess of the Ursalines,
was, by her permission, to be attended by a
lay-sister; and Vivaldi was to meet her with∣out
the walls, and conduct her to the al∣tar.
When the ceremony was over, the
fugitives were to embark in a vessel, hired
for the purpose, and, crossing the lake, pro∣ceed
towards Naples. Vivaldi again with∣drew
to engage a boat, and Ellena to
prepare for the continuance of her jour∣ney.</P>
<P>As the appointed hour drew near, her
spirits sunk, and she watched with melan∣choly
foreboding, the sun retiring amidst
stormy clouds, and his rays fading from the
highest points of the mountains, till the
gloom of twilight prevailed over the scene.
She then left her apartment, took a
grateful leave of the hospitable Abbess,
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
and, attended by the lay-sister, quitted the
convent.</P>
<P>Immediately without the gate she was
met by Vivaldi, whose look, as he put her
arm within his, gently reproached her for
the dejection of her air.</P>
<P>They walked in silence towards the cha∣pel
of San Sebastian. The scene appeared
to sympathize with the spirits of Ellena.
It was a gloomy evening, and the lake,
which broke in dark waves upon the shore,
mingled its hollow sounds with those of
the wind, that bowed the lofty pines, and
swept in gusts among the rocks. She ob∣served
with alarm the heavy thunder
clouds, that rolled along the sides of the
mountains, and the birds circling swiftly
over the waters, and scudding away to
their nests among the cliffs; and the no∣ticed
to Vivaldi, that, as a storm seemed
approaching, she wished to avoid crossing
the lake. He immediately ordered Paulo
to dismiss the boat, and to be in waiting
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
with a carriage, that, if the weather should
become clear, they might not be detained
longer than was otherwise necessary.</P>
<P>As they approached the chapel, Ellena
fixed her eyes on the mournful cypresses
which waved over it, and sighed. "Those,"
she said, "are funereal mementos—not
such as should grace the altar of marriage!
Vivaldi, I could be supperstitious.—Think
you not they are portentous of future mis∣fortune?
But forgive me; my spirits are
weak."</P>
<P>Vivaldi endeavoured to soothe her mind,
and tenderly reproached her for the sadness
she indulged. Thus they entered the
chapel. Silence, and a kind of gloomy se∣pulchral
light, prevailed within. The ve∣nerable
Benedictine, with a brother, who
was to serve as guardian to the bride, were
already there, but they were kneeling, and
engaged in prayer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi led the trembling Ellena to the
altar, where they waited till the Benedic∣tines
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
should have finished, and these were
moments of great emotion. She often
looked round the dusky chapel, in fearful
expectation of discovering some lurking
observer; and, though she knew it to be
very improbable, that any person in this
neighbourhood could be interested in in∣terrupting
the ceremony, her mind in∣voluntarily
admitted the possibility of it.
Once, indeed, as her eyes glanced over a
casement, Ellena fancied she distinguished
a human face laid close to the glass, as if to
watch what was passing within; but when
she looked again, the apparition was gone.
Notwithstanding this, she listened with
anxiety to the uncertain sounds without,
and sometimes started as the surges of the
lake dashed over the rock below, almost
believing she heard the steps and whisper∣ing
voices of men in the avenues of the
chapel. She tried, however, to subdue
apprehension, by considering, that if this
were true, an harmless curiosity might
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
have attracted some inhabitants of the
convent hither, and her spirits became
more composed, till she observed a door
open a little way, and a dark countenance
looking from behind it. In the next in∣stant
it retreated, and the door was closed.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who perceived Ellena's com∣plexion
change, as she laid her hand on
his arm, followed her eyes to the door, but,
no person appearing, he enquired the
cause of her alarm.</P>
<P>"We are observed," said Ellena, "some
person appeared at that door!"</P>
<P>"And if we are observed, my love," re∣plied
Vivaldi, "who is there in this neigh∣bourhood
whose observation we can have
reason to fear? Good father, dispatch," he
added, turning to the priest, "you forget
that we are waiting."</P>
<P>The officiating priest made a signal that
he had nearly concluded his orison; but
the other brother rose immediately, and
spoke with Vivaldi, who desired that the
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
doors of the chapel might be fastened to
prevent intrusion.</P>
<P>"We dare not bar the gates of this holy
temple," replied the Benedictine, "it is a
sanctuary, and never may be closed."</P>
<P>"But you will allow me to repress idle
curiosity," said Vivaldi, "and to enquire
who watches beyond that door? The
tranquillity of this lady demands thus
much."</P>
<P>The brother assented, and Vivaldi step∣ped
to the door; but perceiving no person
in the obscure passage beyond it, he re∣turned
with lighter steps to the altar,
from which the officiating priest now
rose.</P>
<P>"My children," said he," I have made
you wait,—but an old man's prayers are
not less important than a young man's
vows, though this is not a moment when
you will admit that truth."</P>
<P>"I will allow whatever you please,
good father," replied Vivaldi, "if you will
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
administer those vows, without further
delay;—time presses."</P>
<P>The venerable priest took his station at
the altar, and opened the book. Vivaldi
placed himself on his right hand, and with
looks of anxious love, endeavoured to en∣courage
Ellena, who, with a dejected coun∣tenance,
which her veil but ill concealed,
and eyes fixed on the ground, leaned on
her attendant sister. The figure and home∣ly
features of this sister; the tall stature
and harsh visage of the brother, clothed in
the gray habit of his order; the silvered
head and placid physiognomy of the offici∣ating
priest, enlightened by a gleam from
the lamp above, opposed to the youthful
grace and spirit of Vivaldi, and the milder
beauty and sweetness of Ellena, formed
altogether a group worthy of the pencil.</P>
<P>The priest had begun the ceremony, when
a noise from without again alarmed Elle∣na,
who observed the door once more cau∣tiously
opened, and a man bend forward his
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
gigantic figure from behind it. He car∣ried
a torch, and its glare, as the door gra∣dually
unclosed, discovered other persons
in the passage beyond, looking forward
over his shoulder into the chapel. The
fierceness of their air, and the strange pe∣culiarity
of their dress, instantly convinced
Ellena that they were not inhabitants of
the Benedictine convent, but some terrible
messengers of evil, Her half-stifled shriek
alarmed Vivaldi, who caught her before
she fell to the ground; but, as he had not
faced the door, he did not understand the
occasion of her terror, till the sudden rush
of footsteps made him turn, when he ob∣served
several men armed, and very sin∣gularly
habited, advancing towards the
altar.</P>
<P>"Who is he that intrudes upon this
sanctuary?" he demanded sternly, while he
half rose from the ground where Ellena
had sunk.</P>
<P>"What sacrilegious footsteps," cried
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
the priest "thus rudely violate this holy
placed?"</P>
<P>Ellena was now insensible; and the men∣continuing
to advance, Vivaldi drew his
sword to protect her.</P>
<P>The priest and Vivaldi now spoke toge∣ther,
but the words of neither could be
distinguished, when a voice, tremendous
from its loudness; like bursting thunder,
dissipated the cloud of mystery.</P>
<P>"You Vincentio di Vivaldi, and of Na∣ples;"
it said, "and you Ellena di Rosal∣ba,
of Villa Altieri, we summon you to sur∣render,
in the name of the most holy In∣quisition!"</P>
<P>"The Inquisition!" exclaimed Vivaldi,
scarcely believing what he heard. "Here
is some mistake!"</P>
<P>The official repeated the summons,
without deigning to reply.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, yet more astonished, added,
"Do not imagine you can so far impose
upon my credulity, as that I can believe
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
myself to have fallen within the cognizance
of the Inquisition."</P>
<P>"You may believe what you please,
Signor," replied the chief officer, "but you
and that lady are our prisoners."</P>
<P>"Begone, impostor!" said Vivaldi,
springing from the ground, where he had
supported Ellena," or my sword shall teach
you to repent your audacity!"</P>
<P>"Do you insult an officer of the Inqui∣sition!"
exclaimed the ruffian. "That
holy Community will inform you what
you incur by resisting it's mandate."</P>
<P>The priest interrupted Vivaldi's retort,
"If you are really officers of that tremen∣dous
tribunal," he said, "produce some
proof of your office. Remember this place
is sanctified, and tremble for the conse∣quence
of imposition. You do wrong to
believe, that I will deliver up to you per∣sons
who have taken refuge here, with∣out
an unequivocal demand from that
dread power."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162"/>
"Produce your form of summons,"
demanded Vivaldi, with haughty impa∣tience.</P>
<P>"It is here," replied the official, draw∣ing
forth a black scroll, which he deli∣vered
to the priest, "Read, and be satis∣fied!"</P>
<P>The Benedictine started the instant he
beheld the scroll, but he received and de∣liberately
examined it. The kind of parch∣ment,
the impression of the seal, the par∣ticular
form of words, the private signals,
understood only by the initiated—all an∣nounced
this to be a true instrument of ar∣restation
from the <HI>Holy Office.</HI> The scroll
dropped from his hand, and he fixed his
eyes, with surprize and unutterable com∣passion,
upon Vivaldi, who stooped to
reach the parchment, when it was snatch∣ed
by the official.</P>
<P>"Unhappy young man!" said the priest,
"it is too true; you are summoned by
that awful power, to answer to your crime,
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
and I am spared from the commission of a
terrible offence!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi appeared thunderstruck. "For
what crime, holy father, am I called upon
to answer? This is some bold and artful
imposture, since it can delude even you!
What crime—what offence?"</P>
<P>"I did not think you had been thus
hardened in guilt!" replied the priest,
"Forbear! add not the audacity of falfe∣hood,
to the headlong, passions of youth.
You understand too well your crime,"</P>
<P>"Falsehood!" retorted Vivaldi, "But
your years, old man, and those sacred vest∣ments,
protect you. For these ruffians,
who have dared to implicate that inno∣cent
victim," pointing to Ellena, "in the
charge, they shall have justice from my
vengeance."</P>
<P>"Forbear! forbear!" said the priest,
seizing his arm, "have pity on yourself
and on her. Know you not the punish∣ment
you incur from resistance.?"</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164"/>
"I know nor care not," replied Vivaldi,
"but I will defend Ellena di Rosalba to
the last moment. Let them approach if
they dare."</P>
<P>"It is on her, on her who lies senseless
at your feet," said the priest, "that they
will wreck their vengeance for these in∣sults;
on her—the partner of your guilt."</P>
<P>"The partner of my guilt!" exclaimed
Vivaldi, with mingled astonishment and
indignation—"of my guilt!"</P>
<P>"Rash young man! does not the very
veil she wears betray it? I marvel how it
could pass my observation!"</P>
<P>"You have stolen a nun from her con∣vent,"
said the chief officer, "and must
answer for the crime. When you have
wearied yourself with these heroics, Signor,
you must go with us; our patience is
wearied already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi observed, for the first time, that
Ellena was shrouded in a nun's veil; it
was the one which Olivia had lent, to con∣ceal
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
her from the notice of the Abbess,
on the night of her departure from San
Stefano, and which, in the hurry of that
departure, she had forgotten to leave with
the nun. During this interval, her mind
had been too entirely occupied by cares
and apprehension to allow her once to no∣tice,
that the veil she wore was other than
her usual one; but it had been too well
observed by some of the Ursaline sisters.</P>
<P>Though he knew not how to account
for the circumstance of the veil, Vivaldi
began to perceive others which gave co∣lour
to the charge brought against him,
and to ascertain the wide circumference of
the snare that was spread around him.
He fancied, too, that he perceived the
hand of Schedoni employed upon it, and
that his dark spirit was now avenging it∣self
for the exposure he had suffered in the
church of the Spirito Santo, and for all the
consequent: mortifications. As Vivaldi
was ignorant of the ambitious hopes which
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
the Marchesa had encouraged in father
Schedoni, he did not see the improbabili∣ty,
that the Confessor would have dared to
hazard her favour by this arrest of her son;
much less could he suspect, that Schedoni,
having done so, had secrets in his posses∣sion,
which enabled him safely to defy her
resentment, and bind her in silence to his
decree.</P>
<P>With the conviction, that Schedoni's
was the master-hand that directed the pre∣sent
manoeuvre, Vivaldi stood aghast, and
gazing in silent unutterable anguish on El∣lena,
who, as she began to revive, stretched
forth her helpless hands, and called upon
him to save her, "Do not leave me," said
she in accents the most supplicating, "I
am safe while you are with me."</P>
<P>At the sound of her voice, he started
from his trance, and turning fiercely
upon the ruffians, who stood in sullen
watchfulness around, bade them depart,
or prepare for his fury. At the same in∣stant
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
they all drew their swords, and the
shrieks of Ellena, and the supplications of
the officiating priest, were lost amidst the
tumult of the combatants.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, most unwilling to shed blood,
stood merely on the defensive, till the vio∣lence
of his antagonists compelled him to
exert all his skill and strength. He then
disabled one of the ruffians; but his skill
was insufficient to repel the other two, and
he was nearly overcome, when steps were
heard approaching, and Paulo rushed into
the chapel. Perceiving his master beset,
he drew his sword, and came furiously to
his aid. He fought with unconquerable
audacity and fierceness, till nearly at the
moment when his adversary fell, other ruf∣fians
entered the chapel, and Vivaldi with
his faithful servant was wounded, and, at
length, disarmed.</P>
<P>Ellena, who had been withheld from
throwing herself between the combatants,
now, on observing that Vivaldi was wound∣ed,
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
renewed her efforts for liberty, accom∣panied
by such agony of supplication and
complaint, as almost moved to pity the
hearts of the surrounding ruffians.</P>
<P>Disabled by his wounds, and also held
by his enemies, Vivaldi was compelled to
witness her distress and danger, without a
hope of rescuing her. In frantic accents
he called upon the old priest to protect
her.</P>
<P>"I dare not oppose the orders of the In∣quisition,"
replied the Benedictine, "even
if I had sufficient strength to defy it's offi∣cials.
Know you not, unhappy young
man, that it is death to resist them?"</P>
<P>"Death!" exclaimed Ellena, "death!"</P>
<P>"Ay lady, too surely so!"</P>
<P>"Signor, it would have been well for
you," said one of the officers, "if you had
taken my advice; you will pay dearly for
what you have done," pointing to the ruffian,
who lay severely wounded on the
ground.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169"/>
"My master will not have that to pay
for, friend," said Paulo, "for if you must
know, that is a piece of my work; and, if
my arms were now at liberty, I would try
if I could not match it among one of you,
though I am so slashed."</P>
<P>"Peace, good Paulo! the deed was
mine," said Vivaldi; then addressing the
official, "For myself I care not, I have
done my duty—but for her!—Can you
look upon her, innocent and helpless as
she is, and not relent! Can you, will you,
barbarians! drag her, also, to destruc∣tion,
upon a charge too so daringly
false?"</P>
<P>"Our relenting would be of no service
to her," replied the official, "we must do
our duty. Whether the charge is true or
false, she must answer to it before her
judges."</P>
<P>"What charge?" demanded Ellena.</P>
<P>"The charge of having broken your
nun's vows," replied the priest.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170"/>
Ellena raised her eyes to heaven "Is it
even so!" she exclaimed.</P>
<P>"You hear she acknowledges the
crime," said one of the ruffians.</P>
<P>"She acknowledges no crime," replied
Vivaldi; "she only perceives the extent of
the malice that persecutes her. O! El∣lena,
must I then abandon you to their
power! leave you for ever!"</P>
<P>The agony of this thought re-animated
him with momentary strength; he burst
from the grasp of the officials, and once
more clasped Ellena to his bosom, who,
unable to speak, wept, with the anguish of
a breaking heart, as her head sunk upon
his shoulder. The ruffians around them
so far respected their grief, that, for a mo∣ment,
they did not interrupt it.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's exertion was transient; faint
from sorrow, and from loss of blood, he
became unable to support himself, and was
compelled again to relinquish Ellena.</P>
<P>"Is there no help?" said she, with
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
agony; "will you suffer him to expire on
the ground?"</P>
<P>The priest directed, that he should be
conveyed to the Benedictine convent,
where his wounds might be examined,
and medical aid administered. The dis∣abled
ruffians were already carried thither;
but Vivaldi refused to go, unless Ellena
might accompany him. It was contrary
to the rules of the place, that a woman
should enter it, and before the priest could
reply, his Benedictine brother eagerly said,
that they dared not transgress the law of
the convent.</P>
<P>Ellena's fears for Vivaldi entirely over∣came
those for herself, and she entreated,
that he would suffer himself to be con∣veyed
to the Benedictines; but he could
not be prevailed with to leave her. The
officials, however, prepared to separate
them; Vivaldi in vain urged the useless
cruelty of dividing him from Ellena, if, as
they had hinted, she also was to be carried
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
to the Inquisition; and as ineffectually de∣manded,
whither they really designed to
take her.</P>
<P>"We shall take good care of her, Signor,"
said an officer, "that is sufficient for you.
It signifies nothing whether you are go∣ing
the same way, you mull not go toge∣ther."</P>
<P>"Why, did you ever hear, Signor, of
arrested persons being suffered to remain
in company?" said another ruffian, "Fine
plots they would lay; I warrant they
would not contradict each other's evidence
a tittle."</P>
<P>"You shall not separate me from my
master, though," vociferated Paulo; "I
demand to be sent to the Inquisition with
him, or to the devil, but all is one for
that."</P>
<P>"Fair and softly," replied the officer;
"you shall be sent to the Inquisition first,
and to the devil afterwards; you must be
tried before you are condemned."</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173"/>
"But waste no more time," he added
to his followers, and pointing to Ellena,
"away with her."</P>
<P>As he said this, they lifted Ellena in
their arms. "Let me loose!" cried Pau∣lo,
when he saw they were carrying her
from the place, "let me loose, I say!" and
the violence of his struggles burst asunder
the cords which held him; a vain release,
for he was instantly seized again.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, already exhausted by the loss
of blood and the anguish of his mind,
made, however, a last effort to save her;
he tried to raise himself from the ground,
but a sudden film came over his sight, and
his senses forsook him, while yet the name
of Ellena faultered on his lips.</P>
<P>As they bore her from the chapel,
she continued to call upon Vivaldi, and
alternately co supplicate that she might
once more behold him, and take one last
adieu. The ruffians were inexorable, and
she heard his voice no more, for he no
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
longer heard—no longer was able to reply
to her's.</P>
<P>"O! once again!" she cried in agony,
"One word, Vivaldi! Let me hear the
sound of your voice yet once again!"
But it was silent.</P>
<P>As she quitted the chapel, with eyes
still bent towards the spot where he lay,
she exclaimed, in the piercing accents of
despair, "Farewell, Vivaldi!—O! for ever
—ever, farewel!"</P>
<P>The tone, in which she pronounced the
last "farewel!" was so touching, that even
the cold heart of the priest could not resist
it; but he impatiently wiped away the few
tears, that rushed into his eyes, before they
were observed. Vivaldi heard it—it seem∣ed
to arouse him from death!—he heard
her mournful voice for the last time, and,
turning his eyes, saw her veil floating away
through the portal of the chapel. All
suffering, all effort, all resistance were vain;
the ruffians bound him, bleeding as he
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
was, and conveyed him to the Benedictine
convent, together with the wounded Pau∣lo,
who unceasingly vociferated on the way
thither, "I demand to be sent to the In∣quision!
I demand to be sent to the In∣quisition!"</P>

<BIBL>COLLINS'S ODE to FEAR.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE wounds of Vivaldi, and of his ser∣vant,
were pronounced, by the Benedic∣tine
who had examined and dressed them,
to be not dangerous, but those of one of
the ruffians were declared doubtful. Some
few of the brothers displayed much com∣passion
and kindness towards the prison∣ers;
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
but the greater part seemed fearful of
expressing any degree of sympathy for
persons who had fallen within the cogni∣zance
of the Holy Office, and even kept
aloof from the chamber, in which they were
confined. To this self-restriction, how∣ever,
they were not long subjected; for
Vivaldi and Paulo were compelled to be∣gin
their journey as soon as some short rest
had sufficiently revived them. They were
placed in the same carriage, but the pre∣sence
of two officers prevented all inter∣change
of conjecture as to the destination
of Ellena, and with respect to the imme∣diate
occasion of their misfortune. Paulo,
indeed, now and then hazarded a surmise,
and did not scruple to affirm, that the Ab∣bess
of San Stefano was their chief enemy;
that the Carmelite friars, who had over∣taken
them on the road, were her agents;
and that, having traced their route, they
had given intelligence where Vivaldi and
Ellena might be found.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177"/>
"I guessed we never should escape the
Abbess," said Paulo, "though I would not
disturb you, Signor mio, nor the poor lady
Ellena, by saying so. But your Abbesses
are as cunning as Inquisitors, and are so
fond of governing, that they had rather,
like them, send a man to the devil, than
send him no where."</P>
<P>Vivaldi gave Paulo a significant look,
which was meant to repress his imprudent
loquacity, and then sunk again into silence
and the abstractions of deep grief. The offi∣cers,
mean while, never spoke, but were ob∣servant
of all that Paulo said, who per∣ceived
their watchfulness, but because he
despised them as spies, he thoughtlessly de∣spised
them also as enemies, and was so far"
from concealing opinions, which they
might repeat to his prejudice, that he had
a pride in exaggerating them, and in dar∣ing
the worst, which the exasperated tem∣pers
of these men, shut up in the same
carriage with him, and compelled to hear
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
whatever he chose to say against the insti∣tution
to which they belonged, could
effect. Whenever Vivaldi, recalled from
his abstractions by some bold assertion,
endeavoured to check his imprudence,
Paulo was contented to solace his con∣science,
instead of protecting himself, by
saying, "It is their own fault; they would
thrust themselves into my company; let
them have enough of it; and, if ever they
take me before their reverences, the Inqui∣sitors,
<HI>they</HI> shall have enough for it too.
I will play up such a tune in the Inquisi∣tion
as is not heard there every day.
I will jingle all the bells on their fool's
caps, and tell them a little honest truth, if
they make me smart for it ever so."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, aroused once more, and serious∣ly
alarmed for the consequences which ho∣nest
Paulo might be drawing upon him∣self,
now insisted on his silence, and was
obeyed.</P>
<P>They travelled during the whole night,
stopping only to change horses. At
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
every post house, Vivaldi looked for a car∣riage
that might inclose Ellena, but none
appeared, nor any sound of wheels told
him that she followed.</P>
<P>With the morning light he perceived
the dome of St. Peter, appearing faintly
over the plains that surrounded Rome, and
he understood, for the first time, that he
was going to the prisons of the Inquisition
in that city. The travellers descended
upon the Campania, and then rested for
a few hours at a small town on its borders.</P>
<P>When they again set forward, Vivaldi
perceived that the guard was changed, the
officer who had remained with him in the
apartment of the inn only appearing
among the new faces which surrounded
him. The dress and manners of these men
differed considerably from those of the
other. Their conduct was more temper∣rate,
but their countenances expressed a
darker cruelty, mingled with a sly demure∣ness,
and a solemn self-importance, that an∣nounced
them at once as belonging to the
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
Inquisition. They were almost invariably
silent; and when they did speak, it was
only in a few sententious words. To the
abounding questions of Paulo, and the few
earnest entreaties of his master, to be in∣formed
of the place of Ellena's destination,
they made not the least reply; and listen∣ed
to all the flourishing speeches of the
servant against Inquisitors and the Holy
Office with the most profound gravity.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was struck with the circum∣stance
of the guard being changed, and
still more with the appearance of the par∣ty,
who now composed it. When he com∣pared
the manners of the late, with those
of the present guard, he thought he disco∣vered
in the first the mere ferocity of rus∣sians;
but in the latter, the principles of
cunning and cruelty, which seemed parti∣cularly
to characterize Inquisitors; he was
inclined to believe, that a stratagem had
enthralled him, and that now, for the first
time, he was in the custody of the <HI>Holy
Office.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181"/>
It was near midnight when the prisoners
entered the <HI>Porto del Popolo,</HI> and found
themselves in the midst of the Carnival at
Rome. The <HI>Corso,</HI> through which they
were obliged to pass, was crowded with gay
carriages and masks, with processions of
musicians, monks, and mountebanks, was
lighted up with innumerable flambeaux,
and resounded with the heterogeneous
rattling of wheels, the music of serenaders,
and the jokes and laughter of the revel∣lers,
as they sportively threw about their
sugar-plumbs. The heat of the weather
made it necessary to have the windows of
the coach open; and the prisoners, there∣fore,
saw all that passed without. It was
a scene, which contrasted cruelly with the
feelings and circumstances of Vivaldi;
torn as he was from her he most loved, in
dreadful uncertainty as to her fate, and
himself about to be brought before a tri∣bunal,
whose mysterious and terrible pro∣ceedings
appalled even the bravest spirits.
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
Altogether, this was one of the most strik∣ing
examples, which the chequer-work of
human life could shew, or human feelings
endure, Vivaldi sickened as he looked upon
the splendid crowd, while the carriage
made its way slowly with it; but Paulo,
as he gazed, was reminded of the Corso of
Naples, such as it appeared at the time of
Carnival, and, comparing the present scene
with his native one, he found fault with
every thing he beheld. The dresses were
tasteless, the equipages without splendor,
the people without spirit; yet, such was
the propensity of his heart to sympathize
with whatever was gay, that, for some mo∣ments,
he forgot that he was a prisoner on
his way to the Inquisition; almost forgot
that he was a Neapolitan; and, while he
exclaimed against the dullness of a Roman
carnival, would have sprung through the
carriage window to partake of its spirit, if
his fetters and his wounds had not with∣held
him. A deep sigh from Vivaldi re∣called
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
his wandering imagination; and,
when he noticed again the sorrow in his
master's look, all his lightly joyous spirits
fled.</P>
<P>"My <HI>maestro,</HI> my dear <HI>maestro!"</HI>—he
said, and knew not how to finish what he
wished to express.</P>
<P>At that moment they passed the theatre
of San Carlo, the doors of which were
thronged with equipages, where Roman
ladies, in their gala habits, courtiers in
their fantastic dresses, and masks of all de∣scriptions,
were hastening to the opera. In
the midst of this gay bustle, where the car∣riage
was unable to proceed, the officials
of the Inquisition looked on in solemn
silence, not a muscle of their features re∣laxing
in sympathy, or yielding a single
wrinkle of the self-importance that lifted
their brows; and, while they regarded
with secret contempt those, who could be
thus lightly pleased, the people, in return,
more wisely, perhaps, regarded with con∣tempt
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
the proud moroseness, that refused
to partake of innocent pleasures, because
they were trifling, and shrunk from coun∣tenances
surrowed with the sternness of
cruelty. But, when their office was dis∣tinguished,
part of the crowd pressed back
from the carriage in affright, while ano∣ther
part advanced with curiosity; though,
as the majority retreated, space was left
for the carriage to move on. After quit∣ting
the Corso, it proceeded for some
miles through dark and deserted streets,
where only here and there a lamp, hung on
high before the image of a saint, shed it's
glimmering light, and where a melancholy
and universal silence prevailed. At inter∣vals,
indeed, the moon, as the clouds pass∣ed,
away, shewed, for a moment, some of
those mighty monuments of Rome's eter∣nal
name, those sacred ruins, those gigan∣tic
skeletons, which once enclosed a soul,
whose energies governed a world! Even Vi∣valdi
could not behold with indifference the
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
grandeur of these reliques, as the rays fell
upon the hoary walls and columns, or
pass among these scenes of ancient story,
without feeling a melancholy awe, a sa∣cred
enthusiasm, that withdrew him from
himself. But the illusion was transient;
his own misfortunes pressed too heavily
upon him to be long unfelt, and his eh∣thusiasm
vanished like the moonlight.</P>
<P>A returning gleam lighted up, soon after,
the rude and extensive area, which the car∣riage
was crossing. It appeared, from it's
desolation, and the ruins scattered distant∣ly
along its skirts, to be a part of the city
entirely abandoned by the modern inhabi∣tants
to the reliques of its former grandeur.
Not even the shadow of a human being
crossed the waste, nor any building appear∣ed,
which might be supposed to shelter
one. The deep tone of a bell, however,
rolling on the silence of the night, an∣nounced
the haunts of man to be not far
off; and Vivaldi perceived in the distance,
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
to which he was approaching, an extent of
lofty walls and towers, that, as far as the
gloom would permit his eye to penetrate,
bounded the horizon. He judged these
to be the prisons of the Inquisition. Pau∣lo
pointed them out at the same moment.
"Ah, Signor!" said he despondingly; "that
is the place! what strength! If, my Lord,
the Marchese were but to see where we
are going! Ah!"—</P>
<P>He concluded with a deep sigh, and
sunk again into the state of apprehension
and mute expectation, which he had suf∣fered
from the moment that he quitted the
Corso.</P>
<P>The carriage having reached the walls,
followed their bendings to a considerable
extent. These walls, of immense height,
and strengthened by innumerable massy
bulwarks, exhibited neither window or
grate, but a vast and dreary blank; a
small round tower only, perched here and
there upon the summit, breaking their
monotony.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187"/>
The prisoners passed what seemed to be
the principal entrance, from, the grandeur
of its portal, and the gigantic loftiness of
the towers that rose over it; and soon af∣ter
the carriage stopped at an arch-way in
the walls, strongly barricadoed. One of
the escort alighted, and, having struck up∣on
the bars, a folding door within was im∣mediately
opened, and a man bearing a
torch appeared behind the barricado,
whose countenance, as he looked through
it, might have been copied for the
"Grim-visaged comfortless Despair"
of the Poet.</P>
<P>No words were exchanged between him
and the guard; but on perceiving who
were without, he opened the iron gate,
and the prisoners, having alighted, passed
with the two officials beneath the arch,
the guard following with a torch. They
descended a flight of broad steps, at the
foot of which another iron gate admitted
them to a kind of hall; such, however, it
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
at first appeared to Vivaldi, as his eyes
glanced through its gloomy extent, im∣perfectly
ascertaining it by the lamp, which
hung from the centre of the roof. No
person appeared, and a death-like silence
prevailed; for neither the officials nor the
guard yet spoke; nor did any distant
found contradict the notion, that they were
traversing the chambers of the dead. To
Vivaldi it occurred, that this was one of
the burial vaults of the victims, who suf∣fered
in the Inquisition, and his whole
frame thrilled with horror. Several ave∣nues,
opening from the apartment, seemed
to lead to distant quarters of this immense
fabric, but still no footstep whispering
along the pavement, or voice murmuring
through the arched roofs, indicated it to
be the residence of the living.</P>
<P>Having entered one of the passages,
Vivaldi perceived a person clothed in black,
and who bore a lighted taper, crossing si∣lently
in the remote perspective; and he
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
understood too well from his habit, that
he was a member of this dreadful tribunal.</P>
<P>The found of footsteps seemed to reach
the stranger, for he turned, and then
paused, while the officers advanced. They
then made signs to each other, and ex∣changed
a few words, which neither Vi∣valdi
or his servant could understand,
when the stranger, pointing with his taper
along another avenue, passed away. Vi∣valdi
followed him with his eyes, till a door
at the extremity of the passage opened,
and he saw the Inquisitor enter an apart∣ment,
whence a great light proceeded, and
where several other figures, habited like
himself, appeared waiting to receive him.
The door immediately closed; and, whe∣ther
the imagination of Vivaldi was af∣fected,
or that the sounds were real, he
thought, as it closed, he distinguished
half-stifled groans, as of a person in agony.</P>
<P>The avenue, through which the pri∣soners
passed, opened, at length, into an
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
ment gloomy like the first they had enter∣ed,
but more extensive. The roof was
supported by arches, and long arcades
branched off from every side of the cham∣ber,
as from a central point, and were lost
in the gloom, which the rays of the small
lamps, suspended in each, but feebly pe∣netrated.</P>
<P>They rested here, and a person soon af∣ter
advanced, who appeared to be the jai∣lor,
into whose hands Vivaldi and Paulo
were delivered. A few mysterious words
having been exchanged, one of the officials
crossed the hall, and ascended a wide stair∣case,
while the other, with the jailor and
the guard, remained below, as if awaiting
his return.</P>
<P>A long interval elapsed, during which
the stillness of the place was sometimes
interrupted by a closing door, and, at
others, by indistinct sounds, which yet
appeared to Vivaldi like lamentations and
extorted groans. Inquisitors, in their long
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
black robes, issued, from time, to time from
the passages, and crossed the hall to other
avenues. They eyed the prisoners with
curiosity, but without pity. Their visages,
with few exceptions, seemed stamped with
the characters of demons. Vivaldi could
not look upon the grave cruelty, or the
ferocious impatience, their countenances
severally expressed, without reading in
them the fate of some fellow creature,
the fate, which these men seemed going,
even at this moment, to confirm; and, as
they passed with soundless steps, he shrunk
from observation, as if their very looks
possessed some supernatural power, and
could have struck death. But he followed
their fleeting figures, as they proceeded on
their work of horror, to where the last
glimmering ray faded into darkness, ex∣pecting
to see other doors of other cham∣bers
open to receive them. While medi∣tating
upon these horrors, Vivaldi lost
every selfish consideration in astonishment
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
and indignation of the sufferings, which
the frenzied wickedness of man prepares
for man, who, even at the moment of in∣fliction,
insults his victim with assertions of
the justice and necessity of such procedure.
"Is this possible!" said Vivaldi internally,
"Can this be in human nature!—Can
such horrible perversion of right be per∣mitted!
Can man, who calls himself en∣dowed
with reason, and immeasurably su∣perior
to every other created being, argue
himself into the commission of such horri∣ble
folly, such inveterate cruelty, as exceeds
all the acts of the most irrational and fero∣cious
brute. Brutes do not deliberately
slaughter their species; it remains for man
only, man, proud of his prerogative of rea∣son,
and boasting of his sense of justice,
to unite the most terrible extremes of folly
and wickedness!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi had been no stranger to the ex∣istence
of this tribunal; he had long un∣derstood
the nature of the establishment,
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
and had often received particular accounts
of its customs and laws; but, though he
had believed before, it was now only that
conviction appeared to imprese his under∣standing.
A new view of human nature
seemed to burst, at once, upon his mind,
and he could not have experienced greater
astonishment, if this had been the first
moment, in which he had heard of the in∣stitution.
But, when he thought of Elle∣na,
considered that she was in the power
of this tribunal, and that it was probable
she was at this moment within the same
dreadful walls, grief, indignation, and de∣spair
irritated him almost to frenzy. He
seemed suddenly animated with superna∣tural
strength, and ready to attempt im∣possibilities
for her deliverance. It was by
a strong effort for self command, that he
forbore bursting the bonds, which held
him, and making a desperate attempt to
seek her through the vast extent of these
prisons. Reflection, however, had not so
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
entirely forsaken him, but that he saw the
impossibility of succeeding in such an ef∣fort,
the moment he had conceived it, and
he forbore to rush upon the certain de∣struction,
to which it must have led. His
passions, thus restrained, seemed to become
virtues, and to display themselves in the
energy of his courage and his fortitude.
His soul became stern and vigorous in
despair, and his manner and countenance
assumed a calm dignity, which seemed to
awe, in some degree, even his guards. The
pain of his wounds was no longer felt; it
appeared as if the strength of his intellect∣tual
self had subdued the infirmities of
the body, and, perhaps, in these moments
of elevation, he could have endured the
torture without shrinking.</P>
<P>Paulo, meanwhile, mute and grave, was
watchful of all that passed; he observed
the revolutions in his master's mind, with
grief first, and then with surprize, but he
could not imitate the noble fortitude, which
now gave weight and steadiness to Vivaldi's
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
thoughts. And when he looked on the
power and gloom around him, and on the
visages of the passing Inquisitors, he began
to repent, that he had so freely delivered
his opinion of this tribunal, in the pre∣fence
of its agents, and to perceive, that
if he played up the kind of tune he had
threatened, it would probably be the last
he should ever be permitted to perform in
this world.</P>
<P>At length, the chief officer descended the
stair-case, and immediately bade Vivaldi
follow him. Paulo was accompanying
his master, but was withheld by the guard,
and told he was to be disposed of in a dif∣ferent
way. This was the moment of his
severest trial; he declared he would not
be separated from his master▪</P>
<P>"What did I demand to be brought
here for," he cried, "if it was not that I
might go shares with the Signor in all his
troubles? This is not a place to come to
for pleasure, I warrant; and I can promise
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
ye, gentlemen, I would not have come
within an hundred miles of you, if it had
not been for my master's sake."</P>
<P>The guards roughly interrupted him,
and were carrying him away, when Vival∣di's
commanding voice arrested them.
He returned to speak a few words of con∣solation
to his faithful servant, and, since
they were to be separated, to take leave of
him.</P>
<P>Paulo embraced his knees, and, while
he wept, and his words were almost stifled
by sobs, declared no force should drag
him from his master, while he had life;
and repeatedly appealed to the guards,
with—"What did I demand to be
brought here for? Did ever any body
come here to seek pleasure? What right
have you to prevent my going shares with
my master in his troubles?"</P>
<P>"We do not intend to deny you that
pleasure, friend," replied one of the guards!</P>
<P>"Don't you? Then heaven bless you!"
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
cried Paulo, springing From his knees, and
shaking the man by the hand with a vio∣lence,
that would nearly have dislocated
the shoulder of a person less robust.</P>
<P>"So come with us," added the guard,
drawing him away from Vivaldi. Paulo
now became outrageous, and, struggling
with the guards, burst from them, and
again fell at the feet of his master, who
raised and embraced him, endeavouring
to prevail with him to submit quietly to
what was inevitable, and to encourage him
with hope.</P>
<P>"I trust that our separation will be
short" said Vivaldi, "and that we shall
meet in happier circumstances. My
innocence must soon appear."</P>
<P>"We shall never, never meet again,
Signormio, in this world," said Paulo, sob∣bing
violently, "so don't make me hope
so. That old Abbess knows what she is
about too well to let us escape; or she
would not have catched us up so cunningly
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
as she did; so what signifies innocence!
O! if my old lord, the Marchese, did but
know where we are!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi interrupted him, and turning to
the guards said, "I recommend my faith∣ful
servant to your compassion; he is inno∣cent.
It will some time, perhaps, be in
my power to recompence you for any in∣dulgence
you may allow him, and I shall
value it a thousand times more highly,
than any you could shew to myself! Fare∣well,
Paulo,—farewel! Officer, I am
ready."</P>
<P>"O stay! Signor, for one moment—stay!"
said Paulo.</P>
<P>"We can wait no longer," said the
guard, and again drew Paulo away, who
looking piteously after Vivaldi, alternately
repeated, Farewel, dear maestro! farewel
dear, dear maestro!" and "What did I
demand to be brought here for? What
did I demand to be brought here for?—what
was it for, if not to go shares with my
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
maestro?" till Vivaldi was beyond the
reach of sight and of hearing.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having followed the officer up
the stair-case, passed through a gallery to
an anti-chamber, where, being delivered
into the custody of some persons in wait∣ing,
his conductor disappeared beyond a
folding door, that led to an inner apart∣ments.
Over this door was an inscription in
Hebrew characters, traced in blood-colour.
Dante's inscription on the entrance of the
infernal regions, would have been suitable to
a place, where every circumstance and fea∣ture
seemed to say, "<HI>Hope, that comes to
all, comes not here!".</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi conjectured, that in this cham∣ber
they were preparing for him the in∣struments,
which were to extort a confes∣ion;
and though he knew little of the re∣gular
proceedings of this tribunal, he had
always understood, that the torture was
inflicted upon the accused person, till he
made confession of the crime, of which he
was suspected. By such a mode of pro∣ceeding,
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
the innocent were certain of suf∣fering
longer than the guilty; for, as they
had nothing to confess, the Inquisitor,
mistaking innocence for obstinacy, perse∣vered
in his inflictions, and it frequently
happened that he compelled the innocent
to become criminal, and assert a falsehood,
that they might be released from an∣guish,
which they could no longer sustain.
Vivaldi considered this circumstance un∣dauntedly;
every faculty of his soul was
bent up to firmness and endurance. He
believed that he understood the extent of
the charge, which would be brought
against him, a charge as false, as a specious
confirmation of it, would be terrible in it's
consequence both to Ellena and himself.
Yet every art would be practised to bring
him to an acknowledgment of having car∣ried
off a nun, and he knew also, that,
since the prosecutor and the witnesses are
never confronted with the prisoner in cases
of severe accusation, and since their very
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
names are concealed from him, it would
be scarcely possible for him to prove his
innocence. But he did not hesitate an
instant whether to sacrifice himself for
Ellena, determining rather to expire be∣neath
the merciless inflictions of the In∣quisitors,
than to assert a falsehood, which
must involve her in destruction.</P>
<P>The officer, at length, appeared, and,
having beckoned Vivaldi to advance, un∣covered
his head, and bared his arms. He
then led him forward through the folding
door into the chamber; having done
which, he immediately withdrew, and the
door, which shut out Hope, closed after
him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi found himself in a spacious
apartment, where only two persons were
visible, who were seated at a large table,
that occupied the centre of the room.
They were both habited in black; the one,
who seemed by his piercing eye, and ex∣traordinary
physiognomy, to be an Inqui∣sitor,
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
wore on his head a kind of black
turban, which heightened the natural fe∣rocity
of his visage; the other was unco∣vered,
and his arms bared to the elbows.
A book, with some instruments of singular
appearance, lay before him. Round the
table were several unoccupied chairs, on
the backs of which appeared figurative
signs, at the upper end of the apart∣ment,
a gigantic crucifix stretched nearly
to the vaulted roof; and, at the lower end,
suspended from an arch in the wall, was a
dark curtain, but whether it veiled a win∣dow,
or shrowded some object or person,
necessary to the designs of the Inquisitor,
there were little means of judging. It was,
however, suspended from an arch such as
sometimes contains a casement, or leads to
a deep recess.</P>
<P>The Inquisitor called on Vivaldi to ad∣vance,
and, when he had reached the ta∣ble,
put a book into his hands, and bade
him swear to reveal the truth, and keep
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
for ever secret whatever he might see or
hear in the apartment.</P>
<P>Vivaldi hesitated to obey so unqualified
a command. The Inquisitor reminded
him, by a look, not to be mistaken, that
he was absolute here; but Vivaldi still he∣sitated.
"Shall I consent to my own
condemnation?" said he to himself, "The
malice of demons like these may convert
the most innocent circumstances into mat∣ter
of accusation, for my destruction, and
I must answer whatever questions they
choose to ask. And shall I swear, also, to
conceal whatever I may witness in this
chamber, when I know that the most dia∣bolical
cruelties are hourly practised here?"</P>
<P>The Inquisitor, in a voice which would
have made a heart less fortified than was
Vivaldi's tremble, again commanded him
to swear; at the same time, he made a
signal to the person, who sat at the oppo∣site
end of the table, and who appeared to
be an inferior officer.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204"/>
Vivaldi was still silent, but, he began to
consider that, unconscious as he was of
crime, it was scarcely possible for his words
to be tortured into a self-accusation; and
that, whatever he might witness, no retri∣bution
would be prevented, no evil with∣held
by the oath, which bound him to
secresy, since his most severe denunciation
could avail nothing against the supreme
power of this tribunal. As he did not
perceive any good, which could arise from
refusing the oath; and saw much imme∣diate
evil from resistance, he consented to
receive it. Notwithstanding this, when
he put the book to his lips, and uttered
the tremendous vow prescribed to him,
hesitation and reluctance returned upon
his mind, and an icy coldness struck to his
heart. He was so much affected, that
circumstances, apparently the most trivial,
had at this moment influence upon his
imagination. As he accidentally threw
his eyes upon the curtain, which he had
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
observed before without emotion, and
now thought it moved, he almost started
in expectation of seeing some person, an
Inquisitor perhaps, as terrific as the one
before him, or an Accuser as malicious as
Schedoni, steal from behind it.</P>
<P>The Inquisitor having administered the
oath, and the attendant having noted it in
his book, the examination began. After
demanding, as is usual, the names and
titles of Vivaldi and his family, and his
place of residence, to which he fully re∣plied,
the Inquisitor asked, whether he
understood the nature of the accusation
on which he had been arrested.</P>
<P>"The order for my arrestation informed
me." replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Look to your words!" said the Inqui∣sitor,
"and remember your oath. What
was the ground of accusation?"</P>
<P>"I understood," said Vivaldi, "that I
was accused of having stolen a nun from
her sanctuary."</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206"/>
A faint degree of surprise appeared on
the brow of the Inquisitor. "You confess
it, then?" he said, after the pause of a
moment, and making a signal to the Se∣cretary,
who immediately noted Vivaldi's
words.</P>
<P>"I solemnly deny it," replied Vivaldi,
"the accusation is false and mali∣cious."</P>
<P>"Remember the oath you have taken!"
repeated the Inquisitor, "learn also, that
mercy is shewn to such as make full con∣fession;
but that the torture is applied to
those, who have the folly and the obstinacy
to withhold the truth."</P>
<P>"If you torture me till I acknowledge
the justness of this accusation," said Vi∣valdi,
"I must expire under your inflic∣tions,
for suffering never shall compel me
to assert a falsehood. It is not the truth,
which you seek; it is not the guilty, whom
you punish; the innocent, having no
crimes to confess, are the victims of your
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
cruelty, or, to escape from it, become cri∣minal,
and proclam a lie."</P>
<P>"Recollect yourself," said the Inquisi∣tor,
sternly. "You are not brought hi∣ther
to accuse, but to answer accusation.
You say you are innocent; yet acknow∣ledge
yourself to be acquainted with
the subject of the charge which is to be
urged against you! How could you
know this, but from the voice of con∣science?"</P>
<P>"From the words of your own sum∣mons,"
replied Vivaldi, "and from those
of your officials who arrested me."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed the Inquisitor,
"note that," pointing to the Secretary;
"he says by the words of our summons;
now we know, that you never read that
summons. He says also by the words of
our officials;—it appears, then, he is igno∣rant,
that death would follow such a breach
of confidence."</P>
<P>"It is true, I never did read the sum∣mons,"
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
replied Vivaldi, "and as true, that
I never asserted I did; the friar, who read
it, told of what it accused me, and your
officials confirmed the testimony."</P>
<P>"No more of this equivocation!" said
the Inquisitor, "Speak only to the ques∣tion."</P>
<P>"I will not suffer my assertions to be
misrepresented," replied Vivaldi, "or my
words to be perverted against myself. I
have sworn to speak the truth only; since
you believe I violate my oath, and doubt
my direct and simple words, I will speak
no more."</P>
<P>The Inquisitor half rose from his chair,
and his countenance grew paler. "Auda∣cious
heretic!" he said, "will you dispute,
insult, and disobey, the commands of our
most holy tribunal! You will be taught
the consequence of your desperate im∣piety.
—To the torture with him!"</P>
<P>A stern smile was on the features of
Vivaldi, his eyes were calmly fixed on the
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
Inquisitor, and his attitude was undaunted
and firm. His courage, and the cool
contempt, which his looks expressed,
seemed to touch his examiner, who per∣ceived
that he had not a common mind to
operate upon. He abandoned, therefore,
for the present, terrific measures, and, re∣suming
his usual manner, proceeded in the
examination.</P>
<P>"Where were you arrested?"</P>
<P>"At the chapel of San Sebastian, on the
lake of Celano."</P>
<P>"You are certain as to this?" asked
the Inquisitor, "you are sure it was not
at the village of Legano, on the high road
between Celano and Rome?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, while he confirmed his asser∣tion,
recollected with some surprize that
Legano was the place where the guard
had been changed, and he mentioned the
circumstance. The Inquisitor, however,
proceeded in his questions, without ap∣pearing
to notice it. "Was any person
arrested with you?"</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210"/>
"You cannot be ignorant," replied Vi∣valdi,
"that Signora di Rosalba, was
seized at the same time, upon the false
charge of being a nun, who had broken
her vows, and eloped from her convent;
nor that Paulo Mendrico, my faithful
servant! was also made a prisoner, though
upon what pretence he was arrested I am
utterly ignorant."</P>
<P>The Inquisitor remained for some mo∣ments
in thoughtful silence, and then
enquired slightly concerning the family of
Ellena, and her usual place of residence.
Vivaldi, fearful of making some assertion
that might be prejudicial to her, referred
him to herself; but the inquiry was
repeated.</P>
<P>"She is now within these walls," re∣plied
Vivaldi, hoping to learn from the
manner of his examiner, whether his fears
were just, "and can answer these questions
better than myself."</P>
<P>The Inquisitor merely bade the Notary
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>
write down her name, and then remained
for a few moments meditating. At length,
he said, "Do you know where you now
are?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, smiling the question, replied,
"I understand that I am in the prisons of
the Inquisition, at Rome."</P>
<P>"Do you know what are the crimes
that subject persons to the cognizance of
the Holy Office?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was silent.</P>
<P>"Your conscience informs <HI>you,</HI> and your
silence confirms <HI>me.</HI> Let me admonish
you, once more, to make a full confession
of your guilt; remember that this is a
merciful tribunal, and shews favour to
such as acknowledge their crimes?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi smiled; but the Inquisitor pro∣ceeded.</P>
<P>"It does not resemble some severe, yet
just courts, where immediate execution
follows the confession of a criminal. No!
it is merciful, and though it punishes
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
guilt, it never applies the torture but in
cases of necessity, when the obstinate si∣lence
of the prisoner requires such a mea∣sure.
You see, therefore, what you may
avoid, and what expect."</P>
<P>"But if the prisoner has nothing to
confess?" said Vivaldi,—"Can your tor∣tures
make him guilty? They may force
a weak mind to be guilty of falsehood;
to escape present anguish, a man may un∣warily
condemn himself to the death!
You will find that I am not such an one."</P>
<P>"Young man," replied the Inquisitor,
"you will understand too soon, that we
never act, but upon sure authority; and
will wish, too late, that you had made an
honest confession. Your silence cannot
keep from us a knowledge of your of∣fences;
we are in possession of facts; and
your obstinacy can neither wrest from us
the truth, or pervert it. Your most se∣cret
offences are already written on the
tablets of the Holy Office; your con∣science
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
cannot reflect them more justly.—Tremble,
therefore, and revere. But un∣derstand,
that, though we have sufficient
proof of your guilt, we require you to
confess; and that the punishment of ob∣stinacy
is as certain, as that of any other
offence."</P>
<P>Vivaldi made no reply, and the Inquisi∣tor,
after a momentary silence, added,
"Was you ever in the church of the Spi∣rito
Santo, at Naples?"</P>
<P>"Before I answer the question," said
Vivaldi, "I require the name of my
accuser."</P>
<P>"You are to recollect that you have no
right to demand any thing in this place,"
observed the Inquisitor, "nor can you be
ignorant that the name of the Informer is
always kept sacred from the knowledge of
the Accused. Who would venture to do
his duty, if his name was arbitrarily to be
exposed to the vengeance of the criminal
against whom he informs? It is only in a
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
particular process that the Accuser is
brought forward,"</P>
<P>"The names of the Witnesses?" demand∣ed
Vivaldi. The same justice conceals them
also from the knowledge of the Accused,
replied the Inquisitor.</P>
<P>"And is no justice left for the Ac∣cused?"
said Vivaldi. "Is he to be tried
and condemned without being confront∣ed
with either his Prosecutor, or the
Witnesses!"</P>
<P>"Your questions are too many," said
the Inquisitor, and your answers too few.
The Informer is not also the Prosecutor;
the Holy Office, before which the inform∣ation
is laid, is the Prosecutor, and the
dispenser of justice; its Public Accuser
lays the circumstances, and the testimonies
of the Witnesses, before the Court. But
too much of this."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "is the
tribunal at once the Prosecutor, Witness,
and Judge! What can private malice
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
wish for more, than such a court of <HI>justice,</HI>
at which to arraign it's enemy? The
stiletto of the Assassin is not so sure, or
so fatal to innocence. I now perceive,
that it avails me nothing to be guiltless;
a single enemy is sufficient to accomplish
my destruction."</P>
<P>"You have an enemy then?" observed
the Inquisitor.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was too well convinced that he
had one, but there was not sufficient proof,
as to the person of this enemy, to justify,
him in asserting that it was Schedoni.
The circumstance of Ellena having been
arrested, would have compelled him to
suspect another person as being at least
accessary to the designs of the Confessor,
had not credulity started in horror from
the supposition, that a mother's resent∣ment
could possibly betray her son into
the prisons of the Inquisition, though this
mother had exhibited a temper of re∣morseless
cruelty towards a stranger, who
had interrupted her views for that son.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216"/>
"You have an enemy then?" repeated
the Inquisitor.</P>
<P>"That I am here sufficiently proves it,"
replied Vivaldi. "But I am so little any
man's enemy, that I know not who to call
mine."</P>
<P>"It is evident, then, that you have no
enemy," observed the subtle Inquisitor,
"and that this accusation is brought
against you by a respecter of truth, and
a faithful servant of the Roman interest."</P>
<P>Vivaldi was shocked to perceive the
insidious art, by which he had been be∣trayed
into a declaration apparently so
harmless, and the cruel dexterity with
which it had been turned against him. A
lofty and contemptuous silence was all
that he opposed to the treachery of his
examiner, on whose countenance appear∣ed
a smile of triumph and self-congratula∣tion,
the life of a fellow creature being, in
his estimation, of no comparative impor∣tance
with the self-applauses of success∣ful
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
art; the art, too, upon which he most
valued himself—that of his profession.</P>
<P>The Inquisitor proceeded, "You per∣sist
then, in withholding the truth?"
He paused, but Vivaldi making no reply,
he resumed.</P>
<P>"Since it is evident, from your own
declaration, that you have no enemy,
whom private resentment might have in∣stigated
to accuse you; and, from other
circumstances which have occurred in
your conduct, that you are conscious of
more than you have confessed,—it appears,
that the accusation which has been urged
against you, is not a malicious slander. I
exhort you, therefore, and once more con∣jure
you, by our holy faith, to make an
ingenuous confession of your offences, and
to fare yourself from the means, which
must of necessity be enforced to obtain a
confession before your trial commences.
I adjure you, also, to consider, that by
such open conduct only, can mercy be
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
won to soften the justice of this most
righteous tribunal!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, perceiving that it was now ne∣cessary
for him to reply, once more so∣lemnly
asserted his innocence of the crime
alledged against him in the summons, and
of the consciousness of any act, which
might lawfully subject him to the notice
of the Holy Office.</P>
<P>The Inquisitor again demanded what
was the crime alledged, and, Vivaldi having
repeated the accusation, he again bade the
Secretary note it, as he did which, Vivaldi
thought he perceived upon his features
something of a malignant satisfaction, for
which he knew not how to account.
When the Secretary had finished, Vivaldi
was ordered to subscribe his name and
quality to the depositions, and he
obeyed.</P>
<P>The Inquisitor then bade him consider
of the admonition he had received, and
prepare either to confess on the morrow,
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
or to undergo the question As he con∣cluded,
he gave a signal, and the officer,
who had conducted Vivaldi into the
chamber, immediately appeared.</P>
<P>"You know your orders," said the In∣quisitor, "receive your prisoner, and see
that they are obeyed."</P>
<P>The official bowed, and Vivaldi fol∣lowed
him from the apartment in melan∣choly
silence.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLENA, meanwhile, when she had been
carried from the chapel of San Sebastian,
was placed upon a horse in waiting, and,
guarded by the two men who had seized
her, commenced a journey, which conti∣nued
with little interruption during two
nights and days. She had no means of
judging whither she was going, and listened
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
in vain expectation, for the feet of horses,
and the voice of Vivaldi, who, she had
been told, was following on the s same
read.</P>
<P>The steps of travellers seldom broke
upon the silence of these regions, and,
during the journey, she was met only by
some market-people passing to a neigh∣bouring
town, or now and then by the
vine-dressers or labourers in the olive
grounds; and she descended upon the vast
plains of Apulia, still ignorant of her si∣tuation.
An encampment, not of war∣riors,
but of shepherds, who were leading
their flocks to the mountains of Abruzzo,
enlivened a small tract of these levels,
which were shadowed on the north and
east by the mountainous ridge of the
Garganus, stretching from the Apennine
far into the Adriatic.</P>
<P>The appearance of the shepherds was
nearly as wild and savage as that of the
men, who conducted Ellena; but their
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
pastoral instruments of flageolets and ta∣bors
spoke of more civilized feelings, as
they sounded sweetly over the desert.
Her guards rested, and refreshed them∣selves
with goats milk, barley cakes, and
almonds, and the manners of these shep∣herds,
like those she had formerly met
with on the mountains, proved to be more
hospitable than their air had indicated.</P>
<P>After Ellena had quitted this pastoral
camp, no vestige of a human residence ap∣peared
for several leagues, except here and
there the towers of a decayed fortress,
perched upon the lofty acclivities she was
approaching, and half concealed in the
woods. The evening of the second day
was drawing on, when her guards drew
near the forest, which she had long ob∣served
in the distance, spreading over the
many-rising steeps of the Garganus. They
entered by a track, a road it could not be
called, which led among oaks and gigantic
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
chestnuts, apparently the growth of centu∣ries,
and so thickly interwoven, that their
branches formed a canopy which seldom
admitted the sky. The gloom which they
threw around, and the thickets of cystus,
juniper, and lenticus, which flourished be∣neath
the shade, gave a character of fearful
wildness to the scene.</P>
<P>Having reached an eminence, where the
trees were more thinly scattered, Ellena
perceived the forests spreading on all sides
among hills and vallies, and descending to∣wards
the Adriatic, which bounded the
distance in front. The coast, bending in∣to
a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty
pinnacles, wooded to their summits, rose
over the shores, and cliffs of naked marble
of such gigantic proportions, that they
were awful even at a distance, obtruded
themselves far into the waves, breasting
their eternal fury. Beyond the margin of
the coast, as far as the eye could reach,
appeared pointed mountains, darkened with
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
forests, rising ridge over ridge in many suc∣cessions.
Ellena, as she surveyed this wild
scenery, felt as if she was going into eternal
banishment from society. She was tran∣quil,
but it was with the quietness of ex∣hausted
grief, not of resignation; and she
looked back upon the past, and awaited
the future, with a kind of out-breathed
despair.</P>
<P>She had travelled for some miles through
the forest, her guards only now and then ut∣tering
to each other a question, or an ob∣servation
concerning the changes which
had taken place in the bordering scenery,
since they last passed it, when night began
to close in upon them.</P>
<P>Ellena perceived her approach to the sea,
only by the murmurs of its surge upon the
rocky coast, till, having reached an emi∣nence,
which was, however, no more than the
base of two woody mountains that tower∣ed
closely over it, she saw dimly it's gray
surface spreading in the bay below. She
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
now ventured to ask how much further she
was to go, and whether she was to be taken
on board one of the little vessels, appa∣rently
fishing smacks, that she could just
discern at anchor.</P>
<P>"You have not far to go now," replied
one of the guards, surlily; "you will
soon be at the end of your journey, and at
rest."</P>
<P>They descended to the shore, and pre∣sently
came to a lonely dwelling, which
stood so near the margin of the sea, as al∣most
to be washed by the waves. No light
appeared at any of the lattices; and, from
the silence that reigned within, it seemed
to be uninhabited. The guard had pro∣bably
reason to know otherwise, for they
halted at the door, and shouted with all
their strength. No voice, however, an∣swered
to their call, and, while they perse∣vered
in efforts to rouse the inhabitants,
Ellena anxiously examined the building,
as exactly as the twilight would permit.
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
It was of an ancient and peculiar structure,
and, though scarcely important enough for
a mansion, had evidently never been de∣signed
for the residence of peasants.</P>
<P>The walls, of unhewn marble, were high,
and strengthened by bastions; and the edi∣fice
had turretted corners, which, with
the porch in front, and the sloping roof,
were falling fast into numerous symptoms
of decay. The whole building, with it's
dark windows and soundless avenues, had
an air strikingly forlorn and solitary. A
high wall surrounded the small court in
which it stood, and probably had once
served as a defence to the dwelling; but
the gates, which should have closed against
intruders, could no longer perform their
office; one of the folds had dropped from
it's fastenings, and lay on the ground al∣most
concealed in a deep bed of weeds,
and the other creaked on its hinges to
every blast, at each swing seeming ready to
follow the fate of it's companion.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227"/>
The repeated calls of the guard, were,
at length, answered by a rough voice
from within; when the door of the porch
was lazily unbarred, and opened by a man,
whose visage was so misery-struck, that
Ellena could not look upon it with indif∣ference,
though wrapt in misery of her
own. The lamp he held threw a gleam
athwart it, and shewed the gaunt ferocity
of famine, to which the shadow of his hol∣low
eyes added a terrific wildness. Ellena
shrunk while she gazed. She had never
before seen villainy and suffering so strong∣ly
pictured on the same face, and she ob∣served
him with a degree of thrilling cu∣riosity,
which for a moment excluded from
her mind all consciousness of the evils to
be apprehended from him.</P>
<P>It was evident that this house had not
been built for his reception; and she
conjectured, that he was the servant of
some cruel agent of the Marchesa di
Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="228"/>
From the porch, she followed into an
old hall, ruinous, and destitute of any kind
of furniture. It was not extensive but
lofty, for it seemed to ascend to the roof
of the edifice, and the chambers above
opened around it into a corridor.</P>
<P>Some half-sullen salutations were ex∣changed
between the guard and the stran∣ger,
whom they called Spalatro, as they
passed into a chamber, where, it appeared
that he had been sleeping on a mattress
laid in a corner. All the other furniture
of the place, were two or three broken
chairs and a table. He eyed Ellena with
a shrewd contracted brow, and then look∣ed
significantly at the guard, but was si∣lent,
till he desired them all to sit down,
adding, that he would dress some fish for
supper. Ellena discovered that this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was the master of the place; it appear∣ed
also that he was the only inhabitant;
and, when the guard soon after informed
her their journey concluded here, her worst
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
apprehensions were confirmed. The ef∣forts
she made to sustain her spirits,
were no longer successful. It seemed that
she was brought hither by ruffians to a
lonely house on the sea-shore, inhabited
by a man, who had "villain" engraved in
every line of his face, to be the victim of
inexorable pride and an insatiable desire of
revenge. After considering these circum∣stances,
and the words, which had just told
her, she was to go no further, conviction
struck like lightning upon her heart; and,
believing she was brought hither to be as∣sassinated,
horror chilled all her frame, and
her senses forsook her.</P>
<P>On recovering, she found herself sur∣rounded
by the guard and the stranger,
and she would have supplicated for their
pity, but that she feared to exasperate
them by betraying her suspicions. She
complained of fatigue, and requested to
be shewn to her room. The men looked
upon one another, hesitated, and then
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
asked her to partake of the fish that was
preparing. But Ellena having declined
the invitation with as good a grace as she
could assume, they consented that she
should withdraw. Spalatro, taking the
lamp, lighted her across the hall, to the
corridor above, where he opened the door
of a chamber, in which he said she was to
sleep.</P>
<P>"Where is my bed?" said the afflicted
Ellena, fearfully as she looked round.</P>
<P>"It is there—on the floor," replied
Spalatro, pointing to a miserable mattress,
over which hung the tattered curtains of
what had once been a canopy. "If you
want the lamp," he added, "I will leave
it, and come for it in a minute or two."</P>
<P>"Will you not let me have a lamp for
the night," she said in a supplicating and
timid voice.</P>
<P>"For the night!" said the man
gruffly; "What! to set fire to the
house."</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231"/>
Ellena still entreated that he would al∣low
her the comfort of a light.</P>
<P>"Ay, ay," replied Spalatro, with a
look she could not comprehend, "it would
be a great comfort to you, truly! You do
not know what you ask."</P>
<P>"What is it that you mean?" said El∣lena,
eagerly; "I conjure you, in the name
of our holy church, to tell me!"</P>
<P>Spalatro stepped suddenly back, and
looked upon her with surprise, but with∣out
speaking.</P>
<P>"Have mercy on me!" said Ellena,
greatly alarmed by his manner; "I am
friendless, and without help!"</P>
<P>"What do you fear," said the man, re∣covering
himself; and then, without wait∣ing
her reply, added—"Is it such an
unmerciful deed to take away a lamp?"</P>
<P>Ellena, who again feared to betray the
extent of her suspicions, only replied, that
it would be merciful to leave it, for that
her spirits were low, and she required light
to cheer them in a new abode.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232"/>
"We do not stand upon such conceits
here," replied Spalatro, "we have other
matters to mind. Besides, it's the only
lamp in the house, and the company be∣low
are in darkness while I am losing time
here. I will leave it for two minutes, and
no more." Ellena made a sign for him
to put down the lamp; and, when he left
the room, she heard the door barred upon
her.</P>
<P>She employed these two minutes in ex∣amining
the chamber, and the possibility
it might afford of an escape. It was a
large apartment, unfurnished and unswept
of the cobweps of many years. The only
door she discovered was the one, by which
she had entered, and the only window a
lattice, which was grated. Such prepara∣tion
for preventing escape seemed to hint
how much there might be to escape from.</P>
<P>Having examined the chamber, with∣out
finding a single circumstance to encou∣rage
hope, tried the strength of the bars,
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
which she could not shake, and sought in
vain for an inside fastening to her door, she
placed the lamp beside it, and awaited the
return of Spalatro. In a few moments
he came, and offered her a cup of sour wine
with a slice of bread; which, being some∣what
soothed by this attention, she did not
think proper to reject.</P>
<P>Spalatro then quitted the room, and
the door was again barred. Left once
more alone, she tried to overcome appre∣hension
by prayer; and after offering up
her vespers with a fervent heart, she be∣came
more confiding and composed.</P>
<P>But it was impossible that she could so
far forget the dangers of her situation, as
to seek sleep, however wearied she might
be, while the door of her room remained
unsecured against the intrusion of the ruf∣fians
below; and, as she had no means of
fastening it, she determined to watch dur∣ing
the whole night. Thus left to soli∣tude
and darkness, she seated herself upon
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
the mattress to await the return of morn∣ing,
and was soon lost in sad reflection;
every minute occurrence of the past day,
and of the conduct of her guards, moved
in review before her judgment; and, com∣bining
these with the circumstances of her
present situation, scarcely a doubt as to the
fate designed for her remained. It seemed
highly improbable, that the Marchesa di
Vivaldi had sent her hither merely for im∣prisonment,
since she might have confined
her in a convent, with much less trouble;
and still more so, when Ellena considered the
character of the Marchesa, such as she had
already experienced it. The appearance
of this house, and of the man who inha∣bited
it, with the circumstance of no wo∣man
being found residing here, each and
all of these signified, that she was brought
hither, not for long imprisonment, but for
death. Her utmost efforts for fortitude
or resignation could not overcome the cold
tremblings, the sickness of heart, the faint∣ness
<PB N="234" REF="235"/>
and universal horror, that assailed her.
How often, with tears of mingled terror
and grief, did she call upon Vivaldi—Vi∣valdi,
alas! sar distant—to save her; how
often exclaim in agony, that she should
never, never see him more!</P>
<P>She was spared, however, the horror of
believing that he was an inhabitant of the
Inquisition. Having detected the impo∣sition,
which had been practised towards
herself, and that she was neither on the
way to the Holy Office, nor conducted by
persons belonging to it, she concluded,
that the whole affair of Vivaldi's arrest, had
been planned by the Marchesa, merely as
a pretence for confining him, till she
should be placed beyond the reach of his
assistance. She hoped, therefore, that he
had only been sent to some private resi∣dence
belonging to his family, and that,
when her fate was decided, he would be
released, and she be the only victim. This
was the sole consideration, that afforded
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
any degree of assuagement to her suf∣ferings.</P>
<P>The people below sat till a late hour,
She listened often to their distant voices, as
they were distinguishable in the pauses of
the surge, that broke loud and hollow on
the shore; and every time the creaking
hinges of their room door moved, appre∣hended
they were coming to her. At
length, it appeared they had left the apart∣ment,
or had fallen asleep there, for a pro∣found
stilness reigned whenever the mur∣mur
of the waves sunk. Doubt did not
long deceive her, for, while she yet listened,
she distinguished footsteps ascending to
the corridor. She heard them approach
her chamber, and stop at the door; she
heard, also, the low whisperings of their
voices, as they seemed consulting on what
was to be done, and she scarcely ventured
to draw breath, while she intensely attend∣ed
to them. Not a word, however, dis∣tinctly
reached her, till, as one of them
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
was departing, another called out in a
half-whisper, "It is below on the table,
in my girdle; make haste." The man
came back, and said something in a
lower voice, to which the other replied,
"she sleeps," or Ellena was deceived by
the hissing consonants of some other
words. He then descended the stairs;
and in a few minutes she perceived his
comrade also pass away from the door; she
listened to his retreating steps, till the roar∣ing
of the sea was alone heard in their
stead.</P>
<P>Ellena's terrors were relieved only for a
moment. Considering the import of the
words, it appeared that the man who had
descended, was gone for the stiletto of the
other, such an instrument being usually
worn in the girdle, and from the assurance,
"she sleeps," he seemed to fear that his
words had been overheard; and she listen∣ed
again for their steps; but they came
no more.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238"/>
Happily for Ellena's peace, she knew
not that her chamber had a door, so con∣trived
as to open without sound, by which
assassins might enter unsuspectedly at any
hour of the night. Believing that the in∣habitants
of this house had now retired to
rest, her hopes and her spirits began to re∣vive;
but she was yet sleepless and watch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul.
She measured the chamber with un∣equal
steps, often starting as the old
boards shook and groaned where she pas∣sed;
and often pausing to listen whether
all was yet still in the corridor. The
gleam, which a rising moon threw between
the bars of her window, now began to
shew many shadowy objects in the cham∣ber,
which she did not recollect to have
observed while the lamp was there. More
than once, she fancied she saw something
glide along towards the place where the
mattress was laid, and, almost congealed
with terror, she stood still to watch it;
but the illusion, if such it was, disappeared
<PB N="238" REF="239"/>
where the moon-light faded, and even her
fears could not give shape to it beyond.
Had she not known that her chamber-door
remained strongly barred, she would
have believed this was an assassin stealing
to the bed where it might be supposed she
slept. Even now the thought occurred
to her, and vague as it was, had power to
strike an anguish, almost deadly, through
her heart, while she considered that her im∣mediate
situation was nearly as perilous as
the one she had imaged. Again she listened,
and scarcely dared to breathe; but not the
lightest sound occurred in the pauses of
the waves, and she believed herself con∣vinced
that no person except herself was
in the room. That she was deceived in
this belief, appeared from her unwillingness
to approach the mattress, while it was yet
involved in shade. Unable to over∣come
her reluctance, she took her station
at the window, till the strengthening rays
should allow a clearer view of the cham∣ber,
<PB N="239" REF="240"/>
and in some degree restore her confi∣dence;
and she watched the scene without
as it gradually became visible. The moon,
rising over the ocean, shewed it's restless
surface spreading to the wide horizon;
and the waves, which broke in foam upon
the rocky beach below, retiring in long
white lines far upon the waters. She
listened to their measured and solemn
sound, and, somewhat soothed by the soli∣tary
grandeur of the view, remained at the
lattice till the moon had risen high into
the heavens; and even till morning began
to dawn upon the sea, and purple the
eastern clouds.</P>
<P>Re-assured, by the light that now per∣vaded
her room, she returned to the mat∣tress;
where anxiety at length yielded to
her weariness, and she obtained a short
repose.</P>

<Q><L>And yet I fear you;for you are fatal then,</L>

<L>Alas! why gnaw you so your nether lip?</L>

<BIBL>SHAKSPEARE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLENA was awakened from profound
sleep, by a loud noise at the door of her
chamber; when, starting from her mat∣tress,
she looked around her with surprise
and dismay, as imperfect recollections or
the past began to gather on her mind.
She distinguished the undrawing of iron
bars, and then the countenance of Spalatro
at her door, before she had a clear remem∣brance
of her situation—that she was a
prisoner in a house on a lonely shore, and
that this man was her jailor. Such sick∣ness
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
of the heart returned with these con∣victions,
such faintness and terror, that
unable to support her trembling frame,
she sunk again upon the mattress, with∣out
demanding the reason of this abrupt
intrusion.</P>
<P>"I have brought you some breakfast,"
said Spalatro, "if you are awake to take
it; but you seem to be asleep yet. Surely
you have had sleep sufficient for one night;
you went to rest soon enough."</P>
<P>Ellena made no reply, but, deeply af∣fected
with a sense of her situation, looked
with beseeching eyes at the man, who ad∣vanced,
holding forth an oaten cake and
a bason of milk. "Where shall I set them?"
said he, "you must needs be
glad of them, since you had no supper."</P>
<P>Ellena thanked him, and desired he
would place them on the floor, for there
was neither table nor chair in the room.
As he did this, she was struck with the
expression of his countenance, which ex∣hibited
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
a strange mixture of archness and
malignity. He seemed congratulating
himself upon his ingenuity, and anticipa∣ting
some occasion of triumph; and she
was so much interested, that her observa∣tion
never quitted him while he remained
in the room. As his eyes accidentally met
her's, he turned them away, with the ab∣ruptness
of a person who is conscious of
evil intentions, and fears lest they should
be detected; nor once looked up till he
hastily left the chamber, when she heard
the door secured as formerly.</P>
<P>The impression, which his look had
left on her mind, so wholly engaged her
in conjecture, that a considerable time
elapsed before she remembered that he
had brought the refreshment she so much
required; but, as she now lifted it to her
lips, a horrible suspicion arrested her hand;
it was not, however, before she had swal∣lowed
a small quantity of the milk. The
look of Spalatro, which occasioned her sur∣prise,
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
had accompanied the setting down of
the breakfast, and it occurred to her, that
poison was infused in this liquid. She
was thus compelled to refuse the suste∣nance,
which was become necessary to her,
for she feared to taste even of the oaten
cake, since Spalatro had offered it, but the
little milk she had unwarily taken, was so
very small that she had no apprehension
concerning it.</P>
<P>The day, however, was passed in terror,
and almost in despondency; she could nei∣ther
doubt the purpose, for which she had
been brought hither, nor discover any possi∣bility
of escaping from her persecutors; yet
that propensity to hope, which buoys up
the human heart, even in the severest hours
of trial, sustained, in some degree, her
fainting spirits.</P>
<P>During these miserable hours of soli∣tude
and suspense, the only alleviation to
her suffering arose from a belief, that Vi∣valid
was safe, at least from danger, though
<PB N="244" REF="245"/>
not from grief; but she now understood
too much of the dexterous contrivances
of the Marchesa, his mother, to think it
was practicable for him to escape from
her designs, and again restore her to
liberty.</P>
<P>All day Ellena either leaned against the
bars of her window, lost in reverie, while
her unconscious eyes were fixed upon the
ocean, whose murmurs she no longer
heard; or she listened for some sound
from within the house, that might assist
her conjectures, as to the number of
persons below, or what might be pas∣sing
there. The house, however, was
profoundly still, except when now and
then a footstep sauntered along a distant
passage, or a door was heard to close; but
not the hum of a single voice arose from
the lower rooms, nor any symptom of
there being more than one person, beside
herself, in the dwelling. Though she had
not heard her former guards depart, it
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
appeared certain that they were gone, and
that she was left alone in this place with
Spalatro. What could be the purport of
such a proceeding, Ellena could not ima∣gine;
if her death was designed, it seemed
strange that one person only should be left
to the hazard of the deed, when three must
have rendered the completion of it certain.
But this surprise vanished, when her suss∣picion
of poison returned; for it was pro∣bable,
that these men had believed their
scheme to be already nearly accomplished,
and had abandoned her to die alone, in a
chamber from whence escape was imprac∣ticable,
leaving Spalatro to dispose of her
remains. All the incongruities she had
separately observed in their conduct, seem∣ed
now to harmonize and unite in one
plan; and her death, designed by poison,
and that poison to be conveyed in the dis∣guise
of nourishment, appeared to have
been the object of it. Whether it was that
the strength of this conviction affected her
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
fancy, or that the cause was real, Ellena,
remembering at this moment that she
had tasted the milk, was seized with an
universal shuddering, and thought she
felt that the poison had been sufficiently
potent to affect her, even in the inconsi∣derable
quantity she might have taken.</P>
<P>While she was thus agitated, she dis∣tinguished
footsteps loitering near her door,
and attentively listening, became con∣vinced,
that some person was in the corri∣dor.
The steps moved softly, some∣times
stopping for an instant, as if to al∣low
time for listening, and soon after
passed away.</P>
<P>"It is Spalatro!" said Ellena; "he be∣lieves
that I have taken the poison, and he
comes to listen for my dying groans!
Alas! he is only come somewhat too soon,
perhaps!"</P>
<P>As this horrible supposition occurred,
the shuddering returned with encreased
violence, and she sunk, almost fainting, on
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
the mattress; but the fit was not of long
continuance. When it gradually left her,
and recollection revived, she perceived,
however, the prudence of suffering Spala∣tro
to suppose she had taken the beve∣rage
he brought her, since such belief
would at least procure some delay of fur∣ther
schemes, and every delay afforded
some possibility for hope to rest upon.
Ellena, therefore, poured through the bars
of her window, the milk, which she believed
Spalatro had designed should be fatal in its
consequence.</P>
<P>It was evening, when she again fancied
footsteps were lingering near her door, and
the suspicion was confirmed, when, on
turning her eyes, she perceived a shade on
the floor, underneath it, as of some person
stationed without. Presently the shadow
glided away, and at the same time she
distinguished departing steps treading cau∣tiously.</P>
<P>"It is he!" said Ellena; "he still listens
for my moans!"</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249"/>
This further confirmation of his designs
affected her nearly as much as the first;
when anxiously turning her looks towards
the corridor, the shadow again appeared
beneath the door, but she heard no step.
Ellena now watched it with intense solici∣tude
and expectation; fearing every in∣stant
that Spalatro would conclude her
doubts by entering the room. "And O!
when he discovers that I live," thought
she, "what may I not expect during the
first moments of his disappointment!
What less than immediate death!"</P>
<P>The shadow, after remaining a few mi∣nutes
stationary, moved a little, and then
glided away as before. But it quickly re∣turned,
and a low sound followed, as of
some person endeavouring to unfasten
bolts without noise. Ellena heard one
bar gently undrawn, and then another;
she observed the door begin to move, and
then to give way, till it gradually unclos∣ed,
and the face of Spalatro presented it∣self
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
from behind it. Without immediate∣ly
entering, he threw a glance round the
chamber, as if he wished to ascertain some
circumstance before he ventured further.
His look was more than usually haggard
as it rested upon Ellena, who apparently
reposed on her mattress.</P>
<P>Having gazed at her for an instant, he
ventured towards the bed with quick and
unequal steps; his countenance expressed
at once impatience, alarm, and the con∣sciousness
of guilt. When he was within
a few paces, Ellena raised herself, and he
started back as if a sudden spectre had
crossed him. The more than usual wild∣ness
and wanness of his looks, with the
whole of his conduct, seemed to confirm
all her former terrors; and, when he rough∣ly
asked her how she did, Ellena had not
sufficient presence of mind to answer that
she was ill. For some moments, he re∣garded
her with an earnest and sullen at∣tention,
and then a sly glance of scrutiny,
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>
which he threw round the chamber, told
her that he was enquiring whether she had
taken the poison. On perceiving that the
bason was empty, he lifted it from the
floor, and Ellena fancied a gleam of satis∣faction
passed over his visage.</P>
<P>"You have had no dinner." said he, "I
forgot you; but supper will soon be ready;
and you may walk up the beach till then,
if you will."</P>
<P>Ellena, extremely surprised and per∣plexed
by this offer of a seeming indul∣gence,
knew not whether to accept or re∣ject
it. She suspected that some treachery
lurked within it. The invitation appear∣ed
to be only a stratagem to lure her to
destruction, and she determined to decline
accepting it; when again she considered,
that to accomplish this, it was not necessary
to withdraw her from the chamber, where
she was already sufficiently in the power of
her persecutors. Her situation could not
be more desperate than it was at pre∣sent,
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
and almost any change might make it
less so.</P>
<P>As she descended from the corridor, and
passed through the lower part of the house,
no person appeared but her conductor;
and she ventured to enquire, whether the
men who had brought her hither were de∣parted.
Spalatro did not return an an∣swer,
but led the way in silence to the
court, and, having passed the gates, he
pointed toward the west, and said she
might walk that way.</P>
<P>Ellena bent her course towards the "ma∣ny-sounding
waves," followed at a short dis∣tance
by Spalatro, and, wrapt in thought,
pursued the windings of the shore, scarce∣ly
noticing the objects around her; till,
on passing the foot of a rock, she lifted her
eyes to the scene that unfolded beyond,
and observed some huts scattered at a con∣siderable
distance, apparently the residence
of fishermen. She could just distinguish
the dark sails of some skiffs turning the
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
cliffs, and entering the little bay, where the
hamlet margined the beach; but, though
she saw the sails lowered, as the boats ap∣proached
the shore, they were too far off
to allow the figures of the men to appear.
To Ellena, who had believed that no hu∣man
habitation, except her prison, inter∣rupted
the vast solitudes of these forests
and shores, the view of the huts, remote
as they were, imparted a feeble hope, and
even somewhat of joy. She looked back,
to observe whether Spalatro was near; he
was already within a few paces; and, cast∣ing
a wistful glance forward to the remote
cottages, her heart sunk again.</P>
<P>It was a lowering evening, and the sea
was dark and swelling; the screams of the
sea-birds too, as they wheeled among the
clouds, and sought their high nests in the
rocks, seemed to indicate an approaching
storm. Ellena was not so wholly engaged
by selfish sufferings, but that she could
sympathise with those of others, and
<PB N="253" REF="254"/>
she rejoiced that the fisherman, whose
boats she had observed, had escaped the
threatening tempest, and were safely shel∣tered
in their little homes, where, as they
heard the loud waves break along the
coast, they could look with keener plea∣sure
upon the social circle, and the warm
comforts around them. From such consi∣derations
however, she returned again to
a sense of her own forlorn and friendless
situation.</P>
<P>"Alas!" said she, "I have no longer a
home, a circle to smile welcomes upon
me! I have no longer even one friend to
support, to rescue me! I—a miserable
wanderer on a distant shore! tracked, per∣haps,
by the footsteps of the assassin, who
at this instant eyes his victim with silent
watchfulness and awaits the moment of
opportunity to sacrifice her!"</P>
<P>Ellena shuddered as she said this, and
turned again to observe whether Spalatro
was near. He was not within view; and,
while she wondered, and congratulated
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
herself on a possibility of escaping, she per∣ceived
a Monk walking silently beneath the
dark rocks that overbrowed the beach. His
black garments were folded round him;
his face was inclined towards the ground,
and he had the air of a man in deep medi∣tation.</P>
<P>"His, no doubt, are worthy musings!"
said Ellena, as she observed him, with
mingled hope and surprise. "I may ad∣dress
myself, without fear, to one of his
order. It is probably as much his wish,
as it is his duty, to succour the unfortu∣nate.
Who could have hoped to find
on this sequestered shore so sacred a pro∣tector!
his convent cannot be far off."</P>
<P>He approached, his face still bent to∣wards
the ground, and Ellena advanced
slowly, and with trembling steps, to meet
him. As he drew near, he viewed her
askance, without lifting his head; but she
perceived his large eyes looking from un∣der
the shade of his cowl, and the upper
<PB N="255" REF="256"/>
of his peculiar countenance. Her confi∣dence
in his protection began to fail, and
she faultered, unable to speak, and scarce∣ly
daring to meet his eyes. The Monk
stalked past her in silence, the lower part
of his visage still, muffled in his drapery,
and as he passed her looked neither with
curiosity, nor surprise.</P>
<P>Ellena paused, and determined, when
he should be at some distance, to endea∣vour
to make her way to the hamlet, and
throw herself upon the humanity of it's
inhabitants, rather than solicit the pity of
this forbidding stranger. But in the next
moment she heard a step behind her, and,
on turning, saw the Monk again approach∣ing.
He stalked by as before, surveying
her, however, with a sly and scrutinizing
glance from the corners of his eyes. His
air and countenance were equally repulsive,
arid still Ellena could not summon courage
enough to attempt engaging his compas∣sion;
but shrunk as from an enemy.
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
There was something also terrific in the
silent stalk of so gigantic a form; it an∣nounced
both power and treachery. He
passed slowly on to some distance, and
disappeared among the rocks.</P>
<P>Ellena turned once more with an in∣tention
of hastening towards the distant
hamlet, before Spalatro should observe her,
whose strange absence she had scarcely
time to wonder at; but she had not pro∣ceeded
far, when suddenly she perceived
the Monk again at her shoulder. She
started, and almost shrieked; while he re∣garded
her with more attention than be∣fore.
He paused a moment, and seemed
to hesitate; after which he again passed
on in silence. The distress of Ellena en∣creased;
he was gone the way she had de∣signed
to run, and she feared almost equal∣ly
to follow him, and to return to her pri∣son.
Presently he turned, and passed her
again, and Ellena hastened forward. But,
when fearful of being, pursued, she again
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
looked back, she observed him conver∣sing
with Spalatro. They appeared to
be in consultation, while they slowly ad∣vanced,
till, probably observing her rapid
progress, Spalatro called on her to stop, in
a voice that echoed among all the rocks.
It was a voice, which would not be dis∣obeyed.
She looked hopelessly at the still
distant cottages, and slackened her steps.
Presently the Monk again passed before
her, and Spalatro had again disappeared.
The frown, with which the former now re∣garded
Ellena, was so terrific, that she
shrunk trembling back, though she knew
him not for her persecutor, since she had
never conscibusly seen Schedoni. He was
agitated, and his look became darker.</P>
<P>"Whither go you?" said he in a voice
that was stifled by emotion.</P>
<P>"Who is it, father, that asks the ques∣tion?"
said Ellena, endeavouring to ap∣pear
composed.</P>
<P>"Whither go you, and who are you?"
repeated the Monk more sternly.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259"/>
"I am an unhappy orphan," replied
Ellena, sighing deeply, "If you are, as your
habit denotes, a friend to the charities,
you will regard me with compassion."</P>
<P>Schedoni was silent, and then said—"Who,
and what is it that you fear?"</P>
<P>"I fear—even for my life," replied
Ellena, with hesitation. She observed a
darker shade pass over his countenance.
"For your life!" said he, with apparent
surprise, "who is there that would think
it worth the taking."</P>
<P>Ellena was struck with these words.</P>
<P>"Poor insect!" added Schedoni, "who
would crush thee?"</P>
<P>Ellena made no reply; she remained
with her eyes fixed in amazement upon
his face. There was something in his
manner of pronouncing this, yet more ex∣traordinary
than in the words themselves.
Alarmed by his manner, and awed by the
encreasing gloom, and swelling surge, that
broke in thunder on the beach, she at
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
length turned away, and again walked
towards the hamlet which was yet very
remote.</P>
<P>He soon overtook her; when rudely
seizing her arm, and gazing earnestly on
her face, "Who is it, that you fear?" said
he, "say who!"</P>
<P>"That is more than I dare say," replied
Ellena, scarcely able to sustain herself;</P>
<P>"Hah! is it even so!" said the Monk,
with encreasing emotion. His visage how
became so terrible, that Ellena struggled to
liberate her arm, and supplicated that he
would not detain her. He was silent and
still gazed upon her, but his eyes, when
she had ceased to struggle, assumed the
fixt and vacant glare of a man, whose
thoughts have retired within themselves,
and who is no longer conscious to sur∣rounding
objects.</P>
<P>"I beseech you to release me!" re∣peated
Ellena, "it is late, and I am far
from home."</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="261"/>
"That is true," muttered Schedom, still
grasping her arm, and seeming to reply to
his own thoughts rather than to her words,
—"that is very true."</P>
<P>"The evening is closing fast," continued
Ellena, "and I shall be overtaken by the
storm."</P>
<P>Schedoni still mused, and then mut∣tered
—"The storm, say you? Why ay,
let it come."</P>
<P>As he spoke, he suffered her arm to
drop, but still held it, and walked slowly
towards the house. Ellena, thus com∣pelled
to accompany him, and yet more
alarmed both by his looks, his incoherent
answers, and his approach to her prison,
renewed her supplications and her efforts
for liberty, in a voice of piercing distress,
adding, "I am far from home, father;
night is coming on. See how the rocks
darken! I am far from home, and shall
be waited for."</P>
<P>"That is false!" said Schedoni, with
emphasis; "and you know it to be so."</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262"/>
"Alas! I do," replied Ellena, with
mingled shame and grief, "I have no
friends to wait for me!"</P>
<P>"What do those deserve, who delibe∣rately
utter falsehoods," continued the
Monk, "who deceive, and flatter young
men to their destruction?"</P>
<P>"Father!" exclaimed the astonished
Ellena.</P>
<P>"Who disturb the peace of families—who
trepan, with wanton arts, the heirs
of noble houses—who—hah! what do such
deserve?"</P>
<P>Overcome with astonishment and terror,
Ellena remained silent. She now under∣stood
that Schedoni, so far from being like∣ly
to prove a protestor, was an agent of her
worst, and as she had believed her only
enemy; and an apprehension of the im∣mediate
and terrible vengeance, which
such an agent seemed willing to accom∣plish,
subdued her senses; she tottered,
and sunk upon the beach. The weight,
<PB N="262" REF="263"/>
which strained the arm Schedoni held,
called his attention to her situation.</P>
<P>As he gazed upon her helpless and faded
form, he became agitated. He quitted
it, and traversed the beach in short turns,
and with hasty steps; came back again,
and bent over it—his heart seemed sensi∣ble
to some touch of pity. At one mo∣ment,
he stepped towards the sea, and
taking water in the hollows of his hands,
threw it upon her face; at another, seem∣ing
to regret that he had done so, he
would stamp with sudden fury upon the
shore, and walk abruptly to a distance.
The conflict between his design and his con∣science
was strong, or, perhaps, it was only
between his passions. He, who had hitherto
been insensible to every tender feeling, who,
governed by ambition and resentment had
contributed, by his artful instigations, to
fix the baleful resolution of the Marchesa
di Vivaldi, and who was come to execute
her purpose,—even he could not now
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
look upon the innocent, the wretched
Ellena, without yielding to the momentary
weakness, as he termed it, of compassion.</P>
<P>While he was yet unable to baffle the
new emotion by evil passions, he despised
that which conquered him. "And shall
the weakness of a girl," said he, "subdue
the resolution of a man! Shall the view
of her transient sufferings unnerve my firm
heart, and compel me to renounce the
lofty plans I have so ardently, so labori∣ously
imagined, at the very instant when
they are changing into realities! Am I
awake! Is one spark of the fire, which
has so long smouldered within my bosom,
and consumed my peace, alive! Or am
I tame and abject as my fortunes? hah! as
my fortunes! Shall the spirit of my fa∣mily
yield for ever to circumstances? The
question rouses it, and I feel it's energy
revive within me."</P>
<P>He stalked with hasty steps towards
Ellena, as if he feared to trust his resolu∣tion
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>
with a second pause. He had a dag∣ger
concealed beneath his Monk's habit;
as he had also an assassin's heart shrouded
by his garments. He had a dagger—but
he hesitated to use it, the blood which it
might spill, would be observed by the pea∣sants
of the neighbouring hamlet, and
might lead to a discovery. It would be
safer, he considered, and easier, to lay Elle∣na,
senseless as she was, in the waves; their
coldness would recal her to life, only at the
moment before they would suffocate her.</P>
<P>As he stooped to lift her, his resolution
faultered again, on beholding her innocent
face, and in that moment she moved.
He started back, as if she could have
known his purpose, and, knowing it, could,
have avenged herself. The water, which
he had thrown upon her face, had gra∣dually
revived her; she unclosed her eyes,
and, on perceiving him, shrieked, and at∣tempted
to rife. His resolution was sub∣dued,
so tremblingly fearful is guilt in the
<PB N="265" REF="266"/>
moment when it would execute it's atro∣cities.
Overcome with apprehensions, yet
agitated with shame and indignation
against himself for being so, he gazed at
her, for an instant in silence, and then ab∣ruptly
turned away his eyes and left her.
Ellena listened to his departing steps, and,
raising herself, observed him retiring
among the rocks that led towards the
house. Astonished at his conduct, and sur∣prised
to find that she was alone, Ellena
renewed all her efforts to sustain herself, till
she should reach the hamlet so long the
object of her hopes; but she had pro∣ceeded
only, a few paces, when Spalatro
again appeared swiftly approaching. Her
utmost exertion availed her nothing; her
feeble steps were soon overtaken, and El∣lena
perceived herself again his prisoner.
The look with which she resigned herself,
awakened no pity in Spalatro, who ut∣tered
some taunting jest upon the swiftness
of her flight, as he led her back to her
<PB N="266" REF="267"/>
prison, and proceeded in sullen watchful∣ness.
Once again, then, she entered the
gloomy walls of that fatal mansion, never
more, she now believed, to quit them with
life, a belief, which was strengthened when
she remembered that the Monk, on leav∣ing
her, had taken the way hither; for,
though she knew not how to account for
his late forbearance, she could not suppose
that he would long be merciful. He ap∣peared
no more, however, as she passed
to her chamber, where Spalatro left her
again to solitude and terror, and she heard
that fateful door again barred upon her.
When his retreating steps had ceased to
sound, a stilness, as of the grave, prevailed
in the house; like the dead calm, which
sometimes precedes the horrors of a tem∣pest.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SCHEDONI had returned from the beach
to the house, in a state of perturbation,
that defied the controul of even his own
stern will. On the way thither he met
Spalatro, whom, as he dispatched him to
Ellena, he strictly commanded not to ap∣proach
his chamber till he should be
summoned.</P>
<P>Having reached his apartment, he se∣cured
the door, though not any person,
except himself, was in the house, nor any
one expected, but those who he knew
would not dare to intrude upon him.
Had it been possible to have shut out
all consciousness of himself, also, how wil∣lingly
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
would he have done so! He threw
himself into a chair, and remained for a
considerable time motionless and lost in
thought, yet the emotions of his mind
were violent and contradictory. At the
very instant when his heart reproached
him with the crime he had meditated,
he regretted the ambitious views he must
relinquish if he failed to perpetrate it, and
regarded himself with some degree of con∣tempt
for having hitherto hesitated on the
subject. He considered the character of
his own mind with astonishment, for cir∣cumstances
had drawn forth traits, of
which, till now, he had no suspicion. He
knew not by what doctrine to explain the
inconsistencies, the contradictions, he ex∣perienced,
and, perhaps, it was not one of
the least that in these moments of direful
and conflicting passions, his reason could
still look down upon their operations, and
lead him to a cool, though brief examina∣tion
of his own nature. But the subtlety
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
of self-love still eluded his enquiries, and
he did not detect that pride was even at
this instant of self-examination, and of cri∣tical
import, the master-spring of his mind.
In the earliest dawn of his character this
passion had displayed its predominancy,
whenever occasion permitted, and it's in∣fluence
had led to some of the chief events
of his life.</P>
<P>The Count di Marinella, for such had
formerly been the title of the Confessor,
was the younger son of an ancient family,
who resided in the duchy of Milan, and
near the feet of the Tyrolean Alps, on such
estates of their ancestors, as the Italian
wars of a former century had left them.
The portion, which he had received at
the death of his father, was not large, and
Schedoni was not of a disposition to im∣prove
his patrimony by slow diligence, or
to submit to the restraint and humiliation,
which his narrow finances would have im∣posed.
He disdained to acknowledge an
<PB N="266" REF="271"/>

<PB N="270" REF="275"/>
inferiority of fortune to those, with whom
he considered himself equal in rank; and,
as he was destitute of generous feel∣ing,
and of sound judgment, he had not
that loftiness of soul, which is ambitious
of true grandeur. On the contrary, he
was satisfied with an ostentatious display
of pleasures and of power, and, thoughtless
of the consequence of dissipation, was con∣tented
with the pleasures of the moment, till
his exhausted resources compelled him to
pause, and to reflect. He perceived, too
late for his advantage, that it was necessary
for him to dispose of part of his estate, and
to confine himself to the income of the re∣mainder.
Incapable of submitting with
grace to the reduction, which his folly
had rendered expedient, he endeavoured
to obtain by cunning, the luxuries that
his prudence had failed to keep, and which
neither his genius or his integrity could
command. He withdrew, however, from
the eyes of his neighbours, unwilling to
<PB N="271" REF="276"/>
submit his altered circumstances to their
observation.</P>
<P>Concerning several years of his life,
from this period, nothing was generally
known; and, when he was next discovered,
it was in the Spirito Santo convent at
Naples, in the habit of a Monk, and under
the assumed name of Schedoni. His air
and countenance were as much altered as
his way of life; his looks had become
gloomy and severe, and the pride, which
had mingled with the gaiety of their for∣mer
expression, occasionally discovered it∣self
under the disguise of humility, but
more frequently in the austerity of silence,
and in the barbarity of penance.</P>
<P>The person who discovered Schedoni,
would not have recollected him, had not
his remarkable eyes first fixed his atten∣tion,
and then revived remembrance. As
he examined his features, he traced the
faint resemblance of what Marinella had
been, to whom he made himself known.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="277"/>
The Confessor affected to have forgotten
his former acquaintance, and assured him,
that he was mistaken respecting himself,
till the strenger so closely urged some cir∣cumstances,
that the former was no longer
permitted to dissemble. He retired, in
some emotion, with the stranger, and,
whatever might be the subject of their con∣ference,
he drew from him, before he quit∣ted
the convent, a tremendous vow, to
keep secret from the brotherhood his
knowledge of Schedoni's family, and never
to reveal without those walls, that he had
seen him. These requests he had urged
in a manner, that at once surprised and
awed the stranger, and which at the same
time that it manisested the weight of Sche∣doni's
fears, bade the former tremble for
the consequence of disobedience; and he
shuddered even while he promised to obey.
Of the first part of the promise he was
probably strictly observant; whether he
was equally so of the second, does not ap∣pear;
<PB N="273" REF="278"/>
it is certain, that after this period,
he was never more seen or heard of at
Naples.</P>
<P>Schedoni, ever ambitious of distinction,
adapted his manners to the views and pre∣judices
of the society with whom he resid∣ed,
and became one of the most exact ob∣servers
of their outward forms, and almost
a prodigy for self-denial and severe disci∣pline.
He was pointed out by the fathers
of the convent to the juniors as a great
example, who was, however, rather to be
looked up to with reverential admiration,
than with an hope of emulating his sublime
virtues. But with such panegyrics their
friendship for Schedoni concluded. They
found it convenient to applaud the auste∣rities,
which they declined to practise; it
procured them a character for sanctity,
and saved them the necessity of earning
it by mortifications of their own; but
they both feared and hated Schedoni for
his pride and his gloomy austerities, too
<PB N="274" REF="279"/>
much, to gratify his ambition by any thing
further than empty praise. He had been
several years in the society, without obtain∣ing
any considerable advancement, and with
the mortification of seeing persons, who
had never emulated his severity, raised to
high offices in the church. Somewhat too
late he discovered, that he was not to ex∣pect
any substantial favour from the bro∣therhood,
and then it was that his restless
and disappointed spirit first sought prefer∣ment
by other avenues. He had been
some years Confessor to the Marchesa di
Vivaldi, when the conduct of her son
awakened his hopes, by showing him, that
he might render himself not only useful
but necessary to her, by his councils. It
was his custom to study the characters of
those around him, with a view of adapting
them to his purposes, and, having ascer∣tained
that of the Marchesa, these hopes
were encouraged. He perceived that her
passions were strong, her judgment weak,
<PB N="275" REF="280"/>
and he understood, that, if circumstances
should ever enable him to be serviceable in
promoting the end at which any one of
those passions might aim, his fortune
would be established.</P>
<P>At length, he so completely insinuated
himself into her confidence, and became
so necessary to her views, that he could de∣mand
his own terms, and this he had not
failed to do, though with all the affected de∣licacy
and finesse that his situatio seemed
to require. An office of high dignity in the
church, which had long vainly excited his
ambition, was promised him by the Mar∣chesa,
who had sufficient influence to ob∣tain
it; her condition was that of his preserv∣ing
the honour of her family, as she delicately
termed it, which she was careful to make
him understand could be secured only by the
death of Ellena. He acknowledged, with
the Marchesa, that the death of this fasci∣nating
young woman was the only means of
preserving that honour, since, if she lived,
<PB N="276" REF="281"/>
they had every evil to expect from the at∣tachment
and character of Vivaldi, who
would discover and extricate her from any
place of confinement, however obscure or
difficult of access, to which she might be
conveyed. How long and how arduously
the Confessor had aimed to oblige the Mar∣chesa,
has already appeared. The last
scene was now arrived, and he was on the
eve of committing that atrocious act,
which was to secure the pride of her house,
and to satisfy at once his ambition and his
desire of vengeance; when an emotion new
and surprising to him, had arrested his
arm, and compelled his resolution to fal∣ter.
But this emotion was transient, it
disappeared almost with the object that
had awakened it; and now, in the silence
and retirement of his chamber, he had lei∣sure
to recollect his thoughts, to review his
schemes, to re-animate his resolution, and
to wonder again at the pity, which had al∣most
won him from his purpose. The
<PB N="277" REF="282"/>
ruling passion of his nature once more re∣sumed
it's authority, and he determined to
earn the honour, which the Marchesa had
in store for him.</P>
<P>After some cool, and more of tumultuous,
consideration, he resolved that Ellena should
be assassinated that night, while she slept,
and afterwards conveyed through a passage
of the house communicating with the sea,
into which the body might be thrown and
buried, with her sad story, beneath the
waves. For his own sake, he would have
avoided the danger of shedding blood,
had this appeared easy; but he had too
much reason to know she had suspicions
of poison, to trust to a second attempt by
such means; and again his indignation
rose against himself, since by yielding to a
momentary companion, he had lost the
opportunity afforded him of throwing her
unresistingly into the surge.</P>
<P>Spalatro, as has already been hinted,
was a former confident of the Confessor,
<PB N="278" REF="283"/>
who knew too truly, from experience, that
he could be trusted, and had, therefore,
engaged him to assist on this occasion. To
the hands of this man he consigned the
fete of the unhappy Ellena, himself recoil∣ing
from the horrible act he had willed;
and intending by such a step to involve
Spalatro more deeply in the guilt, and
thus more effectually to secure his secret.</P>
<P>The night was far advanced before
Schedoni's final resolution was taken, when
he summoned Spalatro to his chamber to
instruct him in his office. He bolted the
door, by which the man had entered, for∣getting
that themselves were the only per∣sons
in the house, except the poor Ellena,
who, unsuspicious of what was conspiring,
and her spirits worn out by the late scene,
was sleeping peacefully on her mattress
above. Schedoni moved softly from the
door he had secured, and, beckoning Spa∣latro
to approach, spoke in a low voice,
as if he feared to be overheard. "Have
<PB N="279" REF="284"/>
you perceived any sound from her cham∣ber
lately?" said he, "Does she sleep,
think you?"</P>
<P>"No one has moved there for this hour
past, at least," replied Spalatro, "I have
been watching in the corridor, till you
called, and should have heard if she had
stirred, the old floor shakes so with every
step."</P>
<P>"Then hear rue, Spalatro," said the
Confessor. "I have tried, and found thee
faithful, or I should not trust thee in a bu∣siness
of confidence like this. Recollect
all I said to thee in the morning, and be
resolute and dexterous, as I have ever
found thee."</P>
<P>Spalatro listened in gloomy attention,
and the Monk proceeded, "It is late;
go, theresore, to her chamber; be certain
that she sleeps. Take this," he added,
"and this," giving him a dagger and a
large cloak—"You know how you are to
use them."</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="285"/>
He paused, and fixed his penetrating
eyes on Spalatro, who held up the dagger
in silence, examined the blade, and conti∣nued
to gaze upon it, with a vacant stare,
as if he was unconscious of what he did.</P>
<P>"You know your business," repeated
Schedoni, authoritatively, "dispatch! time
wears; and I must set off early."</P>
<P>The man made no reply.</P>
<P>"The morning dawns already," said the
Confessor, still more urgently, "Do you
faulter? do you tremble? Do I not know
you?"</P>
<P>Spalatro put up the poinard in his bo∣som
without speaking, threw the cloak
over his arm, and moved with a loitering
step towards the door.</P>
<P>"Dispatch!" repeated the Confessor,
"why do you linger?"</P>
<P>"I cannot say I like this business,
Signor," said Spalatro surlily. "I know
not why I should always do the most, and
be paid the least."</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="286"/>
"Sordid villain!" exclaimed Schedoni,
"you are not satisfied then!"</P>
<P>"No more a villain than yourself,
Signor," retorted the man, throwing down
the cloak, "I only do your businss; and
'tis you that are sordid, for you would
take all the reward, and I would only have
a poor man have his dues. Do the work
yourself, or give me the greater profit."</P>
<P>"Peace!" said Schedoni, "dare no
more to insult me with the mention of
reward. Do you imagine I have sold
myself! 'Tis my will that she dies;
this is sufficient; and for you—the price
you have asked has been granted."</P>
<P>"It is too little," replied Spalatro, and
besides, I do not like the work.—What
harm has she done me?"</P>
<P>"Since when is it, that you have taken
upon you to moralize?" said the Con∣fessor,
"and how long are these cowardly
scruples to last? This is not the first
time you have been employed; what harm
<PB N="282" REF="287"/>
had others done you! You forget that I
know you, you forget the past."</P>
<P>"No, Signer, I remember it too well, I
wish I could forget; I remember it too
well.—I have never been at peace since.
The bloody hand is always before me!
and often of a night, when the sea roars,
and storms shake the house, <HI>they</HI> have
come, all gasned as I left them, and stood
before my bed! I have got up, and ran
out upon the shore for safety!"</P>
<P>"Peace!" repeated the Confessor,
"where is this frenzy of fear to end? To
what are these visions, painted in blood, to
lead? I thought I was talking with a
man, but find I am speaking only to a
baby, possessed with his nurse's dreams!
Yet I understand you,—you shall be
satisfied."</P>
<P>Schedoni, however, had for once misun∣derstood
this man, when he could not be∣lieve
it possible that he was really averse to
execute what he had undertaken. Whe∣ther
<PB N="283" REF="288"/>
the innocence and beauty of Ellena
had softened his heart, or that his con∣science
did torture him for his past deeds,
he persisted in refusing to murder her.
His conscience, or his pity, was of a very
peculiar kind however; for, though he re∣fused
to execute the deed himself, he con∣sented
to wait at the foot of a back stair-case,
that communicated with Ellena's chamber,
while Schedoni accomplished it, and after∣ward
to assist in carrying the body to the
shore. "This is a compromise between
conscience and guilt, worthy of a demons,"
muttered Schedoni, who appeared to be
insensible that he had made the same com∣promise
with himself not an hour before;
and whose extreme reluctance at this mo∣ment,
to perpetrate with his own hand,
what he had willingly designed for ano∣ther,
ought to have reminded him of that
compromise.</P>
<P>Spalatro, released from the immediate
office of an executioner, endured silently
<PB N="284" REF="289"/>
the abusive, yet half-stifled, indignation
of the Confessor, who also bade him re∣member,
that, though he now shrunk from
the most active part of this transaction, he
had not always been restained, in offices of
the same nature, by equal compunction;
and that not only his means of subsistence,
but his very life itself, was at his mercy.
Spalatro readily acknowledged that it was
so; and Schedoni knew, too well, the
truth of what he had urged, to be re∣strained
from his purpose, by any appre∣hension
of the consequence of a discovery
from this ruffian.</P>
<P>"Give me the dagger, then," said the
Confessor, after a long pause, "take up the
cloak, and follow to the stair-cafe. Let me
see, whether your valour will carry you
thus far."</P>
<P>Spalatro resigned the stiletto, and threw
the cloak again over his arm. The Con∣fessor
stepped to the door, and, trying to
open it, "It is fastened!" said he in alarm,
<PB N="285" REF="290"/>
"some person has got into the house,—it
is fastened!"</P>
<P>"That well may be, Signor," replied
Spalatro, calmly, "for I saw you bolt it
yourself, after I came into the room."</P>
<P>"True," said Schedoni, recovering
himself; "that is true."</P>
<P>He opened it, and proceeded along the
silent passages, towards the private stair∣case,
often pausing to listen, and then
stepping more lightly;—the terrific Sche∣doni,
in this moment of meditative guilt,
feared even the feeble Ellena. At the
foot of the stair-cafe, he again stopped to
listen. "Do you hear any thing?" said
he in a whisper.</P>
<P>"I hear only the sea," replied the man.</P>
<P>"Hush! it is something more!" said
Schedoni; "that is the murmur of
voices!"</P>
<P>They were silent. After a pause of
some length, "It is, perhaps, the voice of
the spectres I told you of, Signor," said
<PB N="286" REF="291"/>
Spalatro, with a sneer. "Give me the
dagger," said Schedoni.</P>
<P>Spalatro, instead of obeying, now grasp∣ed
the arm of the Confessor, who, looking
at him for an explanation of this extraor∣dinary
action, was still more surprised to
observe the paleness and horror of his coun∣tenance.
His starting eyes seemed to fol∣low
some object along the passage, and
Schedoni, who began to partake of his feek∣ings,
looked forward to discover what oc∣casioned
this dismay, but could not per∣ceive
any thing that justified it. "What
is it you fear?" said he at length.</P>
<P>Spalatro's eyes were still moving in hor∣ror,
"Do you see nothing!" said he point∣ing.
Schedoni looked again, but did not
distinguish any object: in the remote gloom
of the passage, whither Spalatro's sight was
now fixed.</P>
<P>"Come, come," said he, ashamed of
his own weakness, "this is not a moment
for such fancies. Awake from this idle
dream."</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="292"/>
Spalatro withdrew his eyes, but they
retained all their wildness. "It was no
dream," said lie, in the voice of a man
who is exhausted by pain, and begins to
breathe somewhat more freely again. "I
saw it as plainly as I now see you."</P>
<P>"Dotard! what did you see!" enquir∣ed
the Confessor.</P>
<P>"It came before my eyes in a mo∣ment,
and shewed itself distinctly and out∣spread."</P>
<P>"What shewed itself?" repeated Sche∣doni.</P>
<P>"And then it beckoned—yes, it beck∣oned
me, with that blood-stained finger!
and glided away down the passage, stilll
beckoning—till it was lost in the dark∣ness."</P>
<P>"This is very frenzy!" said Schedoni,
excessively agitated. "Arouse yourself,
and be a man!"</P>
<P>"Frenzy! would it were, Signor. I
saw that dreadful hand—I see it now—it
is there again!—there!"</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="293"/>
Schedoni, shocked, embarrassed, and
once more infected with the strange emo∣tions
of Spalatro, looked forward expect∣ing
to discover some terrific object, but still
nothing was visible to him, and he soon
recovered himself sufficiently to endeavour
to appease the fancy of this conscience∣struck
ruffian. But Spalatro was insen∣sible
to all he could urge, and the Con∣fessor,
fearing that his voice, though weak
and stifled, would awaken Ellena, tried to
withdraw him from the spot, to the apart∣ment
they had quitted.</P>
<P>"The wealth of San Loretto should not
make me go that way. Signor," replied he,
shuddering—"that was the way <HI>it.</HI> beck∣oned,
it vanished that way!"</P>
<P>Every emotion now yielded with Sche∣doni,
to that of apprehension lest Ellena,
being awakened, should make his task
more horrid by a struggle, and his embar∣rassment
encreased at each instant, for nei∣ther
command, menace, or entreaty could
<PB N="289" REF="294"/>
prevail with Spalatro to retire, till the Monk
luckily remembered a door, which opened
beyond the stair-case, and would conduct
them by another way to the opposite
side of the house. The man consented
so to depart, when, Schedoni unlock∣ing
a suit of rooms, of which he had
always kept the keys, they passed in silence
through an extent of desolate chambers,
till they reached the one, which they had
lately left.</P>
<P>Here, relieved from apprehension re∣specting
Ellena, the Confessor expostulat∣ed
more freely with Spalatro, but neither
argument or menace could prevail, and the
man persisted in refusing to return to the
stair-case, though protesting, at the same
time, that he would not remain alone in
any part of the house; till the wine, with
which the Confessor abundantly supplied
him, began to overcome the terrors of his
imagination. At length, his courage was
so much re-animated, that he consented to
resume his station, and await at the foot
<PB N="290" REF="295"/>
of the stairs the accomplishment of Sche∣doni's
dreadful errand, with which agree∣ment
they returned thither by the way they
had lately passed. The wine, with which
Schedoni also had found it necessary to
strengrhen his own resolution, did not se∣cure
him from severe emotion, when he
found himself again near Ellena; but he
made a strenuous effort for self-subjec∣tion,
as he demanded the dagger of Spa∣latro.</P>
<P>"You have it already, Signor," replied
the man.</P>
<P>"True," said the Monk; "ascend
softly, or our steps may awaken her."</P>
<P>"You said I was to wait at the foot of
the stairs, Signor, while you"—</P>
<P>"True, true, true!" muttered the Con∣fessor,
and had begun to ascend, when his
attendant desired him to stop. "You
are going in darkness, Signor, you have
forgotten the lamp. I have another
here."</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="296"/>
Schedoni took it angrily, without speak∣ing,
and was again ascending, when he he∣sitated,
and once more paused. "The
glare will disturb her," thought he, "it is
better to go in darkness.—Yet—". He
considered, that he could not strike with
certainty without light to direct his hand,
and he kept the lamp, but returned once
more to charge Spalatro not to stir from
the foot of the stairs till he called, and
to ascend to the chamber upon the first
signal.</P>
<P>"I will obey, Signor, if you, on your
part, will promise not to give the signal
till all is over."</P>
<P>"I do promise," replied Schedoni. "No
more!"</P>
<P>Again he, ascended, nor stopped till he
reached Ellena's door, where he listened
for a sound; but all was as silent as if
death already reigned in the chamber.
This door was, from long disuse, difficult
to be opened; formerly it would have
<PB N="292" REF="297"/>
yielded without sound, but now Schedoni
was fearful of noise from every effort he
made to move it. After some difficulty,
however, it gave way, and he perceived,
by the stilness within the apartment, that
he had not disturbed Ellena. He shaded
the lamp with the door for a moment,
while he threw an enquiring glance for∣ward,
and when he did venture farther,
held part of his dark drapery before the
light, to prevent the rays from spreading
through the room.</P>
<P>As he approached the bed, her gentle
breathings informed him that she still
slept, and the next moment he was at her
side. She lay in deep and peaceful slum∣ber,
and seemed to have thrown herself
upon the mattress, after having been wea∣ried
by her griefs; for, though sleep pres∣sed
heavily on her eyes, their lids were yet
wet with tears.</P>
<P>While Schedoni gazed for a moment
upon her innocent countenance, a faint
<PB N="293" REF="298"/>
smile stole over it. He stepped back. "She
smiles in her murderer's face!" said he,
shuddering, "I must be speedy."</P>
<P>He searched for the dagger, and it was
some time before his trembling hand could
disengage it from the folds of his garment;
but, having done so, he again drew near,
and prepared to strike. Her dress perplex∣ed
him; it would interrupt the blow, and
he stooped to examine whether he could
turn her robe aside, without waking her.
As the light passed over her face, he per∣ceived
that the smile had vanished—the
visions of her sleep were changed, for tears
stole from beneath her eye-lids, and her
features suffered a slight convulsion. She
spoke! Schedoni, apprehending that the
light had disturbed her, suddenly drew
back, and, again irresolute, shaded the
lamp, and concealed himself behind the
curtain, while he listened. But her words
were inward and indistinct, and con∣vinced
him that she still slumbered.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="299"/>
His agitation and repugnance to strike
encreased with every moment of delay, and,
as often as he prepared to plunge the poi∣nard
in her bosom, a shuddering horror
restrained him. Astonished at his own
feelings, and indignant at what he termed
a dastardly weakness, he found it necessary
to argue with himself, and his rapid
thoughts said, "Do I not feel the necessity
of this act! Does not what is dearer to
me than existence—does not my conse∣quence
depend on the execution of it? Is
she not also beloved by the young Vival∣di?—have
I already forgotten the church
of the Spirito Santo?" This consideration
re-animated him; vengeance nerved his
arm, and drawing aside the lawn from her
bosom, he once more raised it to strike;
when, aster gazing for an inslant, some new
cause of horror seemed to seize all his frame,
aud he stood for some moments aghast
and motionless like a statue. His respi∣ration
was short and laborious, chilly drops
<PB N="295" REF="300"/>
stood on his forehead, and all his faculties
of mind seemed suspended. When he re∣covered,
he stooped to examine again the
miniature, which had occasioned this revo∣lution,
and which had lain concealed be∣neath
the lawn that he withdrew. The
terrible certainty was almost confirmed,
and forgetting, in his impatience to know
the truth, the imprudence of suddenly dis∣covering
himself to Ellena at this hour of
the night and with a dagger at his feet,
he called loudly "Awake! awake! Say,
what is your name? Speak! speak quick∣ly!"</P>
<P>Ellena, aroused by a man's voice, start∣ed
from her mattress, when, perceiving
Schedoni, and by the pale glare of the
lamp, his haggard countenance, she shriek∣ed,
and sunk back on the pillow. She had
not fainted; and believing that he came
to murder her, she now exerted herself to
plead for mercy. The energy of her feelings
enabled her to rise and throw herself at
<PB N="296" REF="301"/>
his feet, "Be merciful, O father! be merci∣ful!"
said she, in a trembling voice.</P>
<P>"Father!" interrupted Schedoni, with
earnestness; and then, seeming to restrain
himself, he added, with unaffected sur∣prise,"
Why are you thus terrified?" for he
had lost, in new interests and emotions, all
consciousness of evil intention, and of the
singularity of his situation. "What do
you fear?" he repeated.</P>
<P>"Have pity, holy father!" exclaimed
Ellena in agony.</P>
<P>"Why do you not say whose portrait
that is?" demanded he, forgetting that
he had not asked the question before.</P>
<P>"Whose portrait!" repeated the Con∣fessor
in a loud voice.</P>
<P>"Whose portrait!" said Ellena, with
extreme surprise.</P>
<P>"Ay, how came you by it? Be quick
—whose resemblance is it?"</P>
<P>"Why should you wish to know?"
said Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="302"/>
"Answer my question," repeated Sche∣doni,
with encreasing sternness.</P>
<P>"I cannot part with it, holy father,"
replied Ellena, pressing it to her bosom,
"you do not wish me to part with
it!"</P>
<P>"Is it impossible to make you answer my
question!" said he, in extreme perturba∣tion,
and turning away from her, "has
fear utterly confounded you!" Then,
again stepping towards her, and seizing
her wrist, he repeated the demand in a
tone of desperation.</P>
<P>"Alas! he is dead! or I should not now
want a protector," replied Ellena, shrink∣ing
from his grasp, and weeping.</P>
<P>"You trifle," said Schedoni, with a
terrible look, "I once more demand an
answer—whose picture?"—</P>
<P>Ellena lifted it, gazed upon it for a
moment, and then pressing it to her lips
said, "This was my father."</P>
<P>"Your father!" he repeated in an inward
<PB N="298" REF="303"/>
voice, "your father!" and shuddering,
turned away.</P>
<P>Ellena looked at him with surprise.
"I never knew a father's care," she said,
"nor till lately did I perceive the want of
it.—But now."—</P>
<P>"His name?" interrupted the Con∣fessor.</P>
<P>"But now" continued Ellena—"if you
are not as a father to me—to whom can I
look for protection?"</P>
<P>"His name? "repeated Schedoni, with
sterner emphasis.</P>
<P>"It is sacred," replied Ellena, "for he
was unfortunate!"</P>
<P>"His name?" demanded the Confessor,
furiously.</P>
<P>"I have promised to conceal it, father."</P>
<P>"On your life, I charge you tell it;
remember, on your life!"</P>
<P>Ellena trembled, was silent, and with
supplicating looks implored him to desist
from enquiry, but he urged the question
<PB N="299" REF="304"/>
more irresistibly. "His name, then," said
she, "was Marinella."</P>
<P>Schedoni groaned and turned away;
but in a few seconds, struggling to com∣mand
the agitation that shattered his
whole frame, he returned to Ellena, and
raised her from her knees, on which she
had thrown herself to implore mercy.</P>
<P>"The place of his residence?" said; the
Monk.</P>
<P>"It was far from hence," she replied; but
he demanded an unequivocal answer, and
she reluctantly gave one.</P>
<P>Schedoni turned away as before, groan∣ed
heavily, and paced the chamber with∣out
speaking; while Ellena, in her turn,
enquired the motive of his questions, and
the occasion of his agitation. But he
seemed not to notice any thing she said
and, wholly given up to his feelings, was
inflexibly silent, while he stalked, with
measured steps, along the room, and his
face, half hid by his cowl, was bent towards
the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="305"/>
Ellena's terror began to yield to astonish∣ment,
and this emotion encreased, when,
Schedoni approaching her, she perceived
tears swell in his eyes, which were fixt on
her's, and his countenance soften from the
wild disorder that had marked it. Still
he could not speak. At length he yielded
to the fulness of his heart, and Schedoni,
the stern Schedoni, wept and sighed!
He seated himself on the mattress beside
Ellena, took her hand, which she af∣frighted
attempted to withdraw, and
when he could command his voice, said,
"Unhappy child!—behold your more
unhappy father!" As he concluded, his
voice was overcome by groans, and he drew
the cowl entirely over his face.</P>
<P>"My father!" exclaimed the astonished
and doubting Ellena—"my father!" and
fixed her eyes upon him. He gave no
reply, but when, a moment after, he lifted
his head, "Why do you reproach me with
those looks!" said the conscious Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="306"/>
"Reproach you!—reproach my fa∣ther!"
repeated Ellena, in accents soften∣ing
into tenderness, <HI>Why</HI> should I reproach
my father!"</P>
<P>"<HI>Why!</HI>". exclaimed Schedoni, starting
from his feat, "Great God!"</P>
<P>As he moved, he stumbled over the
dagger at his foot; at that moment it
might be said to strike into his heart. He
pushed it hastily from sight. Ellena had
not observed it; but she observed his la∣bouring
breast, his distracted looks, and
quick steps, as he walked to and fro in the
chamber; and she asked, with the most
soothing accents of compassion, and looks
of anxious gentleness, what made him so
unhappy, and tried to assuage his suffer∣ings.
They seemed to encrease with every
wish she expressed to dispel them; at one
moment he would pause to gaze upon her,
and in the next would quit her with a
frenzied start.</P>
<P>"Why do you look so piteously upon
<PB N="302" REF="307"/>
me, father?" Ellena said, "why are you
so unhappy? Tell me, that I may com∣fort
you."</P>
<P>This appeal renewed all the violence of
remorse and grief, and he pressed her to his
bosom, and wetted her cheek with his
tears. Ellena wept to see him weep, till
her doubts began to take alarm. What∣ever
might be the proofs, that had con∣vinced
Schedoni of the relationship be∣tween
them, he had not explained these to
her, and, however strong was the eloquence
of nature which she witnessed, it was not
sufficient to justify an entire confidence in
the assertion he had made, or to allow her
to permit his caresses without trembling.
She shrunk, and endeavoured to disengage
herself; when, immediately understanding
her, he said, "Can you doubt the cause of
these emotions? these signs of paternal
affection?"</P>
<P>"Have I not reason to doubt," replied
Ellena, timidly, "since I never witnessed
them before?"</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="308"/>
He withdrew his arms, and, fixing his
eyes earnestly on hers, regarded her for
some moments in expressive silence
"Poor Innocent!" said he, at length,
"you know not how much your words
convey!—It is too true, you never
have known a father's tenderness till
now!"</P>
<P>His countenance darkened while he
spoke, and he rose again from his seat.
Ellena, meanwhile, astonished, terrified
and oppressed by a variety of emotions,
had no power to demand his reasons for
the belief that so much agitated him, or
any explanation of his conduct; but she
appealed to the portrait, and endeavoured,
by tracing some resemblance between it
and Schedoni, to decide her doubts.
The countenance of each was as diffe∣rent
in character as in years. The mi∣niature
displayed a young man rather
handsome, of a gay and smiling coun∣tenance;
yet the smile expressed triumph,
<PB N="304" REF="309"/>
rather than sweetness, and his whole air
and features were distinguished by a con∣sciousness
of superiority that role even to
haughtiness.</P>
<P>Schedoni, on the contrary, advanced in
years, exhibited a severe physiognomy,
furrowed by thought, no less than by
time, and darkened by the habitual in∣dulgence
of morose passions. He looked
as if he had never smiled since the por∣trait
was drawn; and it seemed as if the
painter, prophetic of Schedoni's future
disposition, had arrested and embodied
that smile, to prove hereafter that cheer∣fulness
had once played upon his fea∣tures.</P>
<P>Though the expression was so different
between the countenance, which Schedoni
formerly owned, and that he now wore,
the same character of haughty pride was
visible in both; and Ellena did trace a
resemblance in the bold outline of the
features, but not sufficient to convince
<PB N="305" REF="310"/>
her, without farther evidence, that each
belonged to the same person, and that
the Confessor had ever been the young
cavalier in the portrait. In the first
tumult of her thoughts, she had not had
leisure to dwell upon the singularity of
Schedoni's visiting her at this deep hour
of the night, or to urge any questions, ex∣cept
vague ones, concerning the truth of
her relationship to him. But now, that
her mind was somewhat recollected, and
that his looks were less terrific, she ven∣tured
to ask a fuller explanation of these
circumstances, and his reasons for the
late extraordinary assertion. "It is past
midnight, father," said Ellena, "you
may judge then how anxious I am to
learn, what motive led you to my cham∣ber
at this lonely hour?"</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply.</P>
<P>"Did you come to warn me of
danger?" she continued, "had you dis∣covered
the cruel designs of Spalatro?</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="311"/>
Ah! when I supplicated for your com∣passion
on the shore this evening, you
little thought what perils surrounded
me! or you would—"</P>
<P>"You say true!" interrupted he, in
a hurried manner, "but name the sub∣ject
no more. Why will you persist in
returning to it?"</P>
<P>His words surprized Ellena, who had
not even alluded to the subject till now;
but the returning wildness of his coun∣tenance,
made her fearful of dwelling
upon the topic, even so far as to point
out his error.</P>
<P>Another deep pause succeeded, during
which Schedoni continued to pace the
room, sometimes stopping for an instant,
to fix his eyes on Ellena, and regarding
her with an earnestness that seemed to
partake of frenzy, and then gloomily
withdrawing his regards, and sighing
heavily, as he turned away to a distant
part of the room. She, meanwhile, agi∣tated
<PB N="307" REF="312"/>
with astonishment at his conduct,
as well as at her own circumstances, and
with the fear of offending him by further
questions, endeavoured to summon courage
to solicit the explanation which was so
important to her tranquillity. At length
she asked, how she might venture to be∣lieve
a circumstance so surprising, as that
of which he had just assured her, and to
remind him that he had not yet disclosed
his reason for admitting the belief.</P>
<P>The Confessor's feelings were eloquent
in reply; and, when at length they were
sufficiently subdued, to permit him to
talk coherently, he mentioned some cir∣cumstances
concerning Ellena's family,
that proved him at least to have been
intimately acquainted with it; and others,
which she believed were known only to
Bianchi and herself, that removed every
doubt of his identity.</P>
<P>This, however, was a period of his
life too big with remorse, horror, and
<PB N="308" REF="313"/>
the first pangs of parental affection, to
allow him to converse long; deep soli∣tude
was necessary for his soul. He
wished to plunge where no eye might
restrain his emotions, or observe the
overflowing anguish of his heart. Hav∣ing
obtained sufficient proof to convince
him that Ellena was indeed his child,
and assured her that she should be re∣moved
from this house on the follo∣ing
day, and be restored to her home,
he abruptly left the chamber.</P>
<P>As he descended the stair-case, Spa∣latro
stepped forward to meet him, with
the cloak which had been designed to
wrap the mangled form of Ellena, when
it should be carried to the shore. "Is
it done?" said the ruffian, in a stifled
voice, "I am ready;" and he spread
forth the cloak, and began to ascend.</P>
<P>"Hold! villain, hold!" said Schedoni,
lifting up his head for the first time,
"Dare to enter that chamber, and your
life shill answer for it."</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="314"/>
"What!" exclaimed the-man, shrink∣ing
back astonished—"will not <HI>her</HI>'s sa∣tisfy
you!"</P>
<P>He trembled for the consequence of
what he had said, when he observed the
changing countenance of the Confessor.
But Schedoni spoke not: the tumult in
his breast was too great for utterance, and
he pressed hastily forward. Spalatro fol∣lowed.
"Be pleased to tell me what I
am to do," said he, again holding forth the
cloak.</P>
<P>"Avaunt!" exclaimed the other, turn∣ing
fiercely upon him; "leave me."</P>
<P>"How!" said the man, whose spirit was
now aroused, "has <HI>your</HI> courage failed too,
Signor? If so, I will prove myself no das∣tard,
though you called me one; I'll do
the business myself."</P>
<P>"Villain! fiend!" cried Schedoni, seiz∣ing
the ruffian by the throat, with a grasp
that seemed intended to annihilate him;
when, recollecting that the fellow was only
<PB N="310" REF="315"/>
willing to obey the very instructions he
had himself but lately delivered to him,
other emotions succeeded to that of rage;
he slowly liberated him, and in accents
broken, and softening from sternness, bade
him retire to rest. "Tomorrow," he ad∣ded,
"I will speak further with you. As
for this night—I have changed my pur∣pose.
Begone!"</P>
<P>Spalatro was about to express the in∣dignation,
which astonishment and fear had
hitherto, overcome, but his employer re∣peated
his command in a voice of thun∣der,
and closed the door of his apartment
with violence, as he shut out a man, whose
presence was become hateful to him. He
felt relieved by his absence, and began to
breathe more freely, till, remembering that
this accomplice had just boasted that he
was no dastard, he dreaded lest, by way of
proving the assertion, he should attempt
to commit the crime, from which he had
lately shrunk. Terrified at the possibili∣ty,
<PB N="311" REF="316"/>
and even apprehending that it might
already have become a reality, he rushed
from the room, and found Spalatro in the
passage leading to the private stair-case;
but, whatever might have been his pur∣pose,
the situation and looks of the latter
were sufficiently alarming. At the ap∣proach
of Schedoni, he turned his sullen
and malignant countenance towards him,
without answering the call, or the demand
as to his business there; and with slow
steps obeyed the order of his master, that
he should withdraw to his room. Thither
Schedoni followed, and, having locked him
in it for the night, he repaired to the apart∣ment
of Ellena, which he secured from the
possibility of intrusion. He then returned
to his own, not to sleep, but to abandon
himself to the agonies of remorse and hor∣ror;
and he yet shuddered like a man, who
has just recoiled from the brink of a pre∣cipice,
but who still measures the gulf with
his eye.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLENA, when Schedoni had left her,
recollected all the particulars, which he
had thought proper to reveal concerning
her family, and, comparing them with such
circumstances as the late Bianchi had re∣lated
on the same subject, she perceived
nothing that was contradictory between the
two accounts. But she knew not even yet
enough of her own story, to understand
why Bianchi had been silent as to some
particulars, which had just been disclosed.
From Bianchi she had always understood,
that her mother had married a nobleman
of the duchy of Milan, and of the house of
<PB N="313" REF="318"/>
Marinella; that the marriage had been
unfortunate; and that she herself, even
before the death of the Countess, had been
committed to the care of Bianchi, the only
sister of that lady. Of this event, or of
her mother, Ellena had no remembrance;
for the kindness of Bianchi had obliterated
from her mind the loss and the griefs of
her early infancy; and she recollected
only the accident which had discovered
to her, in Bianchi's cabinet, after the
death of the latter, the miniature and
the name of her father. When she had
enquired the reason of this injunc∣tion,
Bianchi replied, that the degrad∣ed
fortune of her house rendered pri∣vacy
desirable; and answered her fur∣ther
questions concerning her father, by
relating, that he had died while she was
an infant. The picture, which Ellena
had discovered, Bianchi had found among
the trinkets of the departed Countess, and
<PB N="314" REF="319"/>
designed to present it at some future pe∣riod
to. Ellena, when her discretion might
be trusted with a knowledge of her family.
This was the whole of what Signora Bian∣chi
had judged it necessary to explain,
though in her last hours it appeared that
she wished to reveal more; but it was
then too late.</P>
<P>Though Ellena perceived that many
circumstances of the relations given by
Schedoni, and by Signora Bianchi, coin∣cided,
and that none were contradictory,
except that of his death, she could not yet
subdue her amazement at this discovery,
or even the doubts which occasionally re∣curred
to her as to it's truth. Schedoni,
on the contrary, had not even appeared
surprised, when she assured him, that she
always understood her father had been
dead many years; though when she asked
if her mother too was living, both his dis∣tress
and his assurances confirmed the rela∣tion
made by Bianchi.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="320"/>
When Ellena's mind became more tran∣quil,
she noticed again the singularity of
Schedoni's visit to her apartment at so sa∣cred
an hour; and her thoughts glanced
back involuntarily to the scene of the pre∣ceding
evening on the sea-shore, and the
image of her father appeared in each, in
the terrific character of an agent of the
Marchesa di Vivaldi. The suspicions,
however, which she had formerly admit∣ted,
respecting his designs, were new impa∣tiently
rejected, for she was less anxious to
discover truth, than to release herself from
horrible suppositions; and she willingly
believed that Schedoni, having misunder∣stood
her character, had only designed to
assist in removing her beyond the reach of
Vivaldi. The ingenuity of hope suggested
also, that, having just heard from her con∣ductors,
or from Spalatro, some circum∣stances
of her story, he had been led to a
suspicion of the relationship between them,
<PB N="316" REF="321"/>
and that in the first impatience of paren∣tal
anxiety, he had disregarded the hour,
and come, though at midnight, to her
apartment to ascertain the truth.</P>
<P>While she soothed herself with this ex∣planation
of a circumstance, which had oc∣casioned
her considerable surprise, she per∣ceived
on the floor the point of a dagger
peeping from beneath the curtains! Emo∣tions
almost too horrible to be sustained,
followed this discovery; she took the in∣strument,
and gazed upon it aghast and
trembling, for a suspicion of the real mo∣tive
of Schedoni's visit glanced upon her
mind. But it was only for a moment; such
a supposition was too terrible to be willing∣ly
endured; she again believed that Spa∣latro
alone had meditated her destruction,
and she thanked the Confessor as her deli∣verer,
instead of shrinking from him as an
assassin. She now understood that Sche∣doni,
having discovered the ruffian's design,
<PB N="317" REF="322"/>
had rushed into the chamber to save a
stranger from his murderous poniard, and
had unconsciously rescued his own daugh∣ter,
when the portrait at her bosom in∣formed
him of the truth. With this
conviction Ellena's eyes overflowed with
gratitude, and her heart was hushed to peace.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, shut up in his
chamber, was agitated by feelings of a ve∣ry
opposite nature. When their first ex∣cess
was exhausted, and his mind was
calm enough to reflect, the images that
appeared on it struck him with solemn
wonder. In pursuing Ellena at the crimi∣nal
instigation of the Marchesa di Vivaldi,
it appeared that he had been persecuting
his own child; and in thus consenting to
conspire against the innocent, he had in the
event been only punishing the guilty, and
preparing mortification for himself on the
exact subject to which he had sacrificed
his conscience. Every step that he had
<PB N="318" REF="323"/>
taken with a view of gratifying his ambi∣tion
was retrograde, and while he had been
wickedly intent to serve the Marchesa and
himself, by preventing the marriage of
Vivaldi and Ellena, he had been laboriouss∣ly
counteracting his own fortune. An alli∣ance
with the illustrious house of Vivaldi,
was above his loftiest hope of advance∣ment,
and this event he had himself nearly
prevented by the very means which had
been adoped, at the expence of every vir∣tuous
consideration, to obtain an infe∣rior
promotion. Thus by a singular re∣tribution,
his own crimes had recoiled
upon himself.</P>
<P>Schedoni perceived the many obstacles,
which lay between him and his newly
awakened hopes, and that much was to be
overcome before those nuptials could be
publicly solemnized, which he was now
still more anxious to promote, than he
had lately been to prevent. The appro∣bation
of the Marchesa was, at least, desir∣able,
<PB N="319" REF="324"/>
for she had much at her disposal, and
without it, though his daughter might be
the wife of Vivaldi, he himself would be no
otherwise benefited at present than by the
honour of the connection. He had some
peculiar reasons for believing, that her con∣sent
might be obtained, and, though there
was hazard in delaying the nuptials till
such an experiment had been made, he re∣solved
to encounter it, rather than forbear
to solicit her concurrence. But, if the
Marchesa should prove inexorable, he de∣termined
to bestow the hand of Ellena,
without her knowledge, and in doing so,
he well knew that he incurred little dan∣ger
from her resentment, since he had se∣crets
in his possession, the consciousness of
which must awe her into a speedy neutrali∣ty.
The consent of the Marchese, as he
despaired of obtaining it, he did not mean
to solicit, and the influence of the Mar∣chesa
was such, that Schedoni did not re∣gard
that as essential.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="325"/>
The first steps, however, to be taken,
were those that might release Vivaldi from
the Inquisition, the tremendous prison in∣to
which Schedoni himself, little foreseeing
that he should so soon wish for his libera∣tion,
had caused him to be thrown. He
had always understoood, indeed, that if
the Informer forbore to appear against the
Accused in this Court, the latter would
of course be liberated; and he also believ∣ed,
that Vivaldi's freedom could be ob∣tained
whenever he should think proper to
apply to a person at Naples, whom he
knew to be connected with the <HI>Holy Office</HI>
of Rome. How much the Confessor had
suffered his wishes to deceive him, may ap∣pear
hereafter. His motives for having
thus confined Vivaldi, were partly those
of self-defence. He dreaded the discovery
and the vengeance, which might follow the
loss of Ellena, should Vivaldi be at liberty
immediately to pursue his enquiries. But
he believed that all trace of her must be
<PB N="321" REF="326"/>
lost, after a few weeks had elapsed, and
that Vivaldi's sufferings from confinement
in the Inquisition would have given inte∣rests
to his mind, which must weaken the
one he felt for Ellena. Yet, though in
this instance self-defence had been a prin∣cipal
motive with Schedoni, a desire of
revenging the insult he had received in
the church of the Spirito Santo, and all
the consequent mortifications he expe∣rienced,
had been a second; and, such was
the blackness of his hatred, and the avarice
of his revenge, that he had not considered
the suffering, which the loss of Ellena would
occasion Vivaldi, as sufficient retaliation.</P>
<P>In adopting a mode of punishment so
extraordinary as that of imprisonment in
the Inquisition, it appears, therefore, that
Schedoni was influenced, partly by the dif∣ficulty
of otherwise confining Vivaldi, du∣ring
the period for which confinement was
absolutely necessary to the success of his
own schemes, and partly by a desire of in∣flicting
<PB N="322" REF="327"/>
the tortures of terror. He had
also been encouraged by his discovery of
this opportunity for conferring new obli∣gations
on the Marchesa. The very con∣duct,
that must have appeared to the first
glance of an honest mind fatal to his in∣terests,
he thought might be rendered
beneficial to them, and that his dexterity
could so command the business, as that the
Marchesa should eventually thank him
as the deliverer of her son, instead of dis∣covering
and execrating him as his Accu∣ser;
a scheme favoured by the unjust and
cruel rule enacted by the tribunal he ap∣proached,
which permitted anonymous In∣formers.</P>
<P>To procure the arrestation of Vivaldi, it
had been only necessary to send a written
accusation, without a name, to the <HI>Holy
Office,</HI> with a mention of the place where
the accused person might be seized; but
the suffering in consequence of this did
not always proceed further than the <HI>ques∣tion;.</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="328"/>
since, if the Informer failed to disco∣ver
himself to the Inquisitors, the prisoner,
after many examinations, was released,
unless he happened unwarily to criminate
himself. Schedoni, as he did not intend
to prosecute, believed, therefore, that
Vivaldi would of course be discharged
after a certain period, and supposing it
also utterly impossible that he could
ever discover his Accuser, the Confessor
determined to appear anxious and active
in effecting his release. This character of
a deliverer, he knew he should be the bet∣ter
enabled to support by means of a per∣son
officially connected with the <HI>Holy Of∣fice,</HI>
who had already unconsciously assisted
his views. In the apartment of this man,
Schedoni had accidentally seen a formula
of arrestation against a person suspected of
Heresy, the view of which had not only
suggested to him the plan he had since
adopted, but had in some degree assisted
him to carry it into effect. He had seen
<PB N="324" REF="329"/>
the scroll only for a short time, but his
observations were so minute, and his me∣mory
so clear, that he was able to copy
it with at least sufficient exactness to impose
upon the Benedictine priest, who had,
perhaps, seldom or never seen a real in∣strument
of this kind. Schedoni had em∣ployed
this artifice for the purpose of im∣mediately
securing Vivaldi, apprehending
that, while the Inquisitors were slowly de∣liberating
upon his arrest, he might quit
Celano, and elude discovery. If the de∣caption
succeeded, it would enable him
also to seize Ellena, and to mislead Vivaldi
respecting her destination. The charge of having
carried off a nun might appear to
be corroborated by many circumstances,
and Schedoni would probably have made
these the subject of real denunciation, had
he not foreseen the danger and the trouble
in which it might implicate himself; and
that, as the charge could not be substan∣tiated,
Ellena would finally escape. As
<PB N="325" REF="330"/>
far as his plan now went, it had been suc∣cessful;
some of the bravoes whom he
hired to personate officials, had conveyed
Vivaldi to the town, where the real officers
of the Inquisition were appointed to re∣ceive
him; while the others carried Ellena
to the shore of the Adriatic. Schedoni
had much applauded his own ingenuity, in
thus contriving, by the matter of the
forged accusation, to throw an impene∣trable
veil over the fate of Ellena, and to
secure himself from the suspicions or ven∣geance
of Vivaldi, who, it appeared, would
always believe that she had died, or was
still confined in the unsearchable prisons
of the Inquisition.</P>
<P>Thus he had betrayed himself in endea∣vouring
to betray Vivaldi, whose release,
however, he yet supposed could be easily
obtained; but how much his policy
had, in this instance, outrun his sagacity,
now remained to be proved.</P>
<P>The subject of Schedoni's immediate
<PB N="326" REF="331"/>
perplexity was, the difficulty of convey∣ing
Ellena back to Naples; since, not chus∣ing
to appear at present in the character
of her father, he could not decorously
accompany her thither himself, nor could
he prudently entrust her to the conduct
of any person, whom he knew in this neigh∣bourhood.
It was, however, necessary to
form a speedy determination, for he could
neither endure to pass another day in a
scene, which must continually impress him
with the horrors of the preceding night,
nor that Ellena should remain in it; and
the morning light already gleamed upon
his casements.</P>
<P>After some further deliberation, he re∣solved
to be himself her conductor, as far
at least as through the forests of the Garga∣nus,
and at the first town where conve∣niencies
could be procured, to throw aside
his Monk's habit, and, assuming the dress
of a layman, accompany her in this dis∣guise
towards Naples, till he should either
<PB N="327" REF="332"/>
discover some secure means of sending her
forward to that city, or a temporary asy∣lum
for her in a convent on the way.</P>
<P>His mind was scarcely more tranquil,
after having formed this determination,
than before, and he did not attempt to
repose himself even for a moment. The
circumstances of the late discovery were
almost perpetually recurring to his af∣frighted
conscience, accompanied by a
fear that Ellena might suspect the real
purpose of his midnight visit; and he
alternately formed and rejected plausible
falsehoods, that might assuage her curio∣sity,
and delude her apprehension.</P>
<P>The hour arrived, however, when it
was necessary to prepare for departure,
and found him still undecided as to the
explanation he should form.</P>
<P>Having released Spalatro from his
chamber, and given him directions to
procure horses and a guide immediately
from the neighbouring hamlet, he re∣paired
<PB N="328" REF="333"/>
to Ellena's room, to prepare her
for this hasty removal. On approaching
it, a remembrance of the purpose, with
which he had last passed through these same passages and stair-case, appealed so
powerfully to his feelings, that he was
unable to proceed, and he turned back
to his own apartment to recover some
command over himself. A few moments
restored to him his usual address, though
not his tranquillity, and he again ap∣proached
the chamber; it was now, how∣ever,
by way of the corridor. As he un∣barred
the door, his hand trembled; but,
when he entered the room, his counte∣nance
and manner had resumed their usual
solemnity, and his voice only would have
betrayed, to an attentive observer, the agi∣tation
of his mind.</P>
<P>Ellena was considerably affected on
seeing him again, and he examined with
a jealous eye the emotions he witnessed.
The smile with which she met him was
<PB N="329" REF="334"/>
tender, but he perceived it pass away
from her features, like the aërial colouring
that illumines a mountain's brow; and
the gloom of doubt and apprehension again
overspread them. As he advanced, he held
forth his hand for her's, when, suddenly per∣ceiving
the dagger he had left in the cham∣ber,
he involuntarily withdrew his prof∣fered
courtesy, and his countenance chang∣ed.
Ellena, whose eyes followed his to the
object that attracted them, pointed to the
instrument, took it up, and approaching
him said, "This dagger I found last
night in my chamber! O my father!"—</P>
<P>"That dagger!" said Schedoni, with
affected surprize.</P>
<P>"Examine it," continued Ellena, while
she held it up, "Do you know to whom
it belongs? and who brought it hither?"</P>
<P>"What is it you mean?" asked Sche∣doni,
betrayed by his feelings.</P>
<P>"Do you know, too, for what pur∣pose
<PB N="330" REF="335"/>
it was brought?" said Ellena mourn∣fully.</P>
<P>The Confessor made no reply, but irre∣solutely
attempted to seize the instrument.</P>
<P>"O yes, I perceive you know too
well," continued Ellena, "here, my
father, while I slept"—</P>
<P>"Give me the dagger," interrupted
Schedoni, in a frightful voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, my father, I will give it as an
offering of my gratitude," replied Ellena,
but as she raised her eyes, filled with
tears, his look and fixed attitude terrified
her, and she added with a still more persua∣sive
tenderness, "Will you not accept the
offering of your child, for having preserved
her from the poniard of an assassin?"</P>
<P>Schedoni's looks became yet darker;
he took the dagger in silence, and threw
it with violence to the furthest end of
the chamber, while his eyes remained
fixed on her's. The force of the action
<PB N="331" REF="336"/>
alarmed her; "Yes, it is in vain that
you would conceal the truth," she added,
weeping unrestrainedly, "your goodness
cannot avail; I know the whole."—</P>
<P>The last words aroused Schedoni again
from his trance, his features became con∣vulsed,
and his look furious."What
do you know?" he demanded in a
subdued voice, that seemed ready to
burst in thunder.</P>
<P>"All that I owe you," replied Ellena,
"that last night, while I slept upon this
mattress, unsuspicious of what was de∣signed
against me, an assassin entered the
chamber with that instrument in his
hand, and—"</P>
<P>A stisled groan from Schedoni checked
Ellena; she observed his rolling eyes, and
trembled; till, believing that his agitation
was occasioned by indignation against the
assassin, she resumed, "Why should you
think it necessary to conceal the danger
which has threatened me, since it is to you
<PB N="332" REF="337"/>
that I owe my deliverance from it? O!
my father, do not deny me the pleasure
of shedding these tears of gratitude, do
not refuse the thanks, which are due to
you! While I slept upon that couch,
while a ruffian stole upon my slumber—it
was you, yes! can I ever forget that
it was my father, who saved me from his
poniard!"</P>
<P>Schedoni's passions were changed, but
they were not less violent; he could
scarcely controul them, while he said in
a tremulous tone—"It is enough, say
no more;" and he raised Ellena, but
turned away without embracing her.</P>
<P>His strong emotion, as he paced in
silence the furthest end of the apartment,
excited her surprize, but she then attri∣buted
it to a remembrance, of the peri∣lous
moment, from which he had rescued
her.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, to whom her
thanks were daggers, was trying to sub∣due
<PB N="333" REF="338"/>
he feelings of remorse that tore his
heart; and was so enveloped in a world
of his own, as to be for some time un∣conscious
of all around him. He con∣tinued
to stalk in gloomy silence along
the chamber, till the voice of Ellena,
entreating him rather to rejoice that he
had been permitted to save her, than so
deeply to consider dangers which were past,
again touched the chord that vibrated to
his conscience, and recalled him to a
sense of his situation. He then bade her
prepare for immediate departure, and
abruptly quitted the room.</P>
<P>Vainly hoping that in flying from the
scene of his meditated crime, he should
leave with it the acuteness of remem∣brance,
and the agonizing stings of re∣morse,
he was now more anxious than
ever to leave this place. Yet he should
still be accompanied by Ellena, and her
innocent looks, her affectionate thanks,
inflicted an anguish, which was scarcely
<PB N="334" REF="339"/>
endurable. Sometimes, thinking that her
hatred, or what to him would be still
severer, her contempt, must be more
tolerable than this gratitude, he almost
resolved to undeceive her respecting his
conduct, but as constantly and impa∣tiently
repelled the thought with horror,
and finally determined to suffer her to
account for his late extraordinary visit in
the way she had chosen.</P>
<P>Spalatro, at length, returned from the
hamlet with horses, but without having
procured a guide to conduct the tra∣vellers
through a tract of the long-devolving
forests of the Garganus, which
it was necessary for them to pass. No
person had been willing to undertake so
arduous a task; and Spalatro, who was
well acquainted with all the labyrinths
of the way, now offered his services.</P>
<P>Schedoni, though he could scarcely
endure the presence of this man, had no
alternative but to accept him, since he
<PB N="335" REF="340"/>
had dismissed the guide who had con∣ducted
him hither. Of personal violence
Schedoni had no apprehension, though he
too well understood the villainy of his pro∣posed
companion; for he considered that
he himself should be well armed, and he
determined to ascertain that Spalatro was
without weapons; he knew also, that in
case of a contest, his own superior stature
would easily enable him to overcome such
an antagonist.</P>
<P>Every thing being now ready for de∣parture,
Ellena was summoned, and the
Confessor led her to his own apartment,
where a slight breakfast was prepared.</P>
<P>Her spirits being revived by the speed
of this departure, she would again have
expressed her thanks, but he peremptorily
interrupted her, and forbade any further
mention of gratitude.</P>
<P>On entering the court where the horses
were in waiting, and perceiving Spalatro,
Ellena shrunk and put her arm within
<PB N="336" REF="341"/>
Schedoni's for protection. "What recol∣lections
does the presence of that man re∣vive!"
said she, "I can scarcely venture to
believe myself safe, even with you, when he
is here."</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply, till the remark
was repeated, "You have nothing to fear
from him," muttered the Confessor, while
he hastened her forward, "and we have
no time to lose in vague apprehension."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Ellena, "is not
he the assassin from whom you saved me!
I cannot doubt, that you know him to be
such, though you would spare me the
pain of believing so."</P>
<P>"Well, well, be it so," replied the Con∣fessor;
"Spalatro, lead the horses this way."</P>
<P>The party were soon mounted, when,
quitting this eventful mansion, and the
those of the Adriatic, as Ellena hoped for
ever, they entered upon the gloomy wil∣derness
of the Garganus. She often turn∣ed
her eyes back upon the house with
<PB N="326" REF="342"/>
emotions of inexpressible awe, astonish∣ment,
and thankfulness, and gazed while
a glimpse of it's turretted walls could be
caught beyond the dark branches, which,
closing over it, at length shut it from her
view. The joy of this departure, however,
was considerably abated by the presence
of Spalatro, and her fearful countenance
enquired of Schedoni the meaning of his
being suffered to accompany them. The
Confessor was reluctant to speak con∣cerning
a man, of whose very existence he
would willingly have ceased to think. El∣lena
guided her horse still closer to Sche∣doni's,
but, forbearing to urge the enquiry
otherwise than by looks, she received no
reply, and endeavoured to quiet her appre∣hensions,
by considering that he would
not have permitted this man to be
their guide, unless he had believed he
might be trusted. This consideration,
though it relieved her fears, encreased her
perplexity respecting the late designs
<PB N="338" REF="343"/>
of Spalatro, and her surprise that Sche∣doni,
if he had really understood them to
be evil, should endure his presence.
Every time she stole a glance at the dark
countenance of this man, rendered still
barker by the shade of the trees, she
thought "assassin" was written in each
line or it, and could scarcely doubt that
he, and not the people who had conducted
her to the mansion, had dropped the dag∣ger
in her chamber. Whenever she looked
round through the deep glades, and on the
forest-mountains that on every side closed
the scene, and seemed to exclude all cheer∣ful
haunt of man, and then regarded her
companions, her heart sunk, notwith∣standing
the reasons she had for believing
herself in the protection of a father. Nay,
the very looks of Schedoni himself, more
than once reminding her of his appearance
on the sea-shore, renewed the impressions
of alarm and even of dismay, which she
had there experienced. At such moments
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
it was scarcely possible for her to consider
him as her parent, and, in spite of every
late appearance, strange and unaccounta∣ble
doubts began to gather on her mind.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, lost in thought,
broke not, by a single word, the deep
silence of the solitudes through which they
passed. Spalatro was equally mute, and
equally engaged by his reflections on the
sudden change in Schedoni's purpose, and
by wonder as to the motive, which could
have induced him to lead Ellena in safety,
from the very spot whither she was
brought by his express command to be
destroyed. He, however, was not so
wholly occupied, as to be unmindful of
his situation, or unwatchful of an oppor∣tunity
of serving his own interests, and re∣taliating
upon Schedoni for the treatment
he had received on the preceding night.</P>
<P>Among the various subjects that dis∣tracted
the Confessor, the difficulty of
disposing of Ellena, without betraying at
<PB N="340" REF="345"/>
Naples that she was his relative, was not
the least distressing. Whatever might be
the reason which could justify such feelings,
his fears of a premature discovery of the
circumstance to the society with whom
he lived, were so strong, as often to
produce the most violent effect upon his
countenance, and it was, perhaps, when
he was occupied by this subject, that it's
terrific expression revived with Ellena the
late scene upon the shore. His embar∣rassment
was not less, as to the excuse to
be offered the Marchesa, for having failed to
fulfil his engagement, and respecting
the means by which he might interest her in
favour of Ellena, and even dispose her to
approve the marriage, before she should
be informed of the family of this unfortu∣nate
young woman. Perceiving all the ne∣cessity
for ascertaining the probabilities of
such consent, before he ventured to make
an avowal of her origin, he determined not
to reveal himself till he should be perfectly
<PB N="341" REF="346"/>
sure that the discovery would be accepta∣ble
to the Marchesa. In the mean time,
as it would be necessary to say something
of Ellena's birth, he meant to declare, that
he had discovered it to be noble, and her
family worthy, in every respect, of a con∣nection
with that of the Vivaldi.</P>
<P>An interview with the Marchesa, was
almost equally wished for and dreaded by
the Confessor. He shuddered at the ex∣pectation
of meeting a woman, who had
instigated him to the murder of his own
child, which, though he had been happily
prevented from committing it, was an act
that would still be wished for by the
Marchesa. How could he endure her
reproaches, when she should discover that
he had failed to accomplish her will! How
conceal the indignation of a father, and
dissimulate all a father's various feelings,
when, in reply to such reproaches, he must
form excuses, and act humility, from
which his whole soul would revolt! Ne∣ver
<PB N="342" REF="347"/>
could his arts of dissimilation have
been so severely tried, not even in the late
scenes with Ellena, never have returned
upon himself in punishment so severe, as
in that which awaited him with the Mar∣chesa.
And from it's approach, the cool
and politic Schedoni often shrunk in such
horror, that he almost determined to avoid
it at any hazard, and secretly to unite Vi∣valdi
and Ellena, without even soliciting
the consent of the Marchesa.</P>
<P>A desire, however, of the immediate
preferment, so necessary to his pride, con∣stantly
checked this scheme, and finally
made him willing to subject every honest
feeling, and submit to any meanness,
however vicious, rather than forego the
favourite object of his erroneous ambition.
Never, perhaps, was the paradoxical union
of pride and abjectness, more strongly ex∣hibited
than on this occasion.</P>
<P>While thus the travellers silently proceed∣ed,
Ellena's thoughts often turned to Vi∣valdi,
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
and she considered, with trembling
anxiety, the effect which the late discovery
was likely to have upon their future lives.
It appeared to her, that Schedoni must
approve of a connection thus flattering to
the pride of a father, though he would pro∣bably
refuse his consent to a private mar∣riage.
And, when she further considered
the revolution, which a knowledge of her
family might occasion towards herself in the
minds of the Vivaldi, her prospects seemed
to brighten, and her cares began to dissi∣pate.
Judging that Schedoni must be
acquainted with the present situation of
Vivaldi, she was continually on the point
of mentioning him, but was as constantly
restrained by timidity, though, had she
suspected him to be an inhabitant
of the Inquisition, her scruples would
have vanished before an irresistible interest.
As it was, believing that he, like herself,
had been imposed upon by the Marchesa's
agents, in the disguise of officials, she con∣cluded,
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
as has before appeared, that he
how suffered a temporary imprisonment
by order of his mother, at one of the
family villas. When, however, Schedoni,
awaking from his reverie, abruptly men∣tioned
Vivaldi, her spirits fluttered with
impatience to learn his exact situation,
and she enquired respecting it.</P>
<P>"I am no stranger to your attach∣ment,"
said Schedoni, evading the ques∣tion,
"but I wish to be informed of some
circumstances relative to it's commence∣ment."</P>
<P>Ellena, confused, and not knowing
what to reply, was for a moment silent,
and then repeated her enquiry.</P>
<P>"Where did you first meet?" said the
Confessor, still disregarding her question.
Ellena related, that she had first seen
Vivaldi, when attending her aunt from
the church of San Lorenzo. For the
present she was spared the embarrassment
of further explanation by Spalatro, who,
<PB N="345" REF="350"/>
riding up to Schedoni, informed him they
were approaching the town of Zanti. On
looking forward, Ellena perceived houses
peeping from among the forest-trees, at a
short distance, and presently heard the
cheerful bark of a dog, that sure herald
and faithful servant of man!</P>
<P>Soon after the travellers entered Zanti,
a small town surrounded by the forest,
where, however, the poverty of the inha∣bitants
seemed to forbid a longer stay
than was absolutely necessary for repose,
and a flight refreshment. Spalatro led
the way to a cabin, in which the few per∣sons,
that journied this road were usually
entertained. The appearance of the peo∣ple,
who owned it, was as wild as their
country, and the interior of the dwelling
was so dirty and comfortless, that Sche∣doni,
preferring to take his repast in the
open air, a table was spread under the
luxuriant shade of the forest-trees, at a
little distance. Here, when the host
<PB N="346" REF="351"/>
had withdrawn, and Spalatro had been
dispatched to examine the post-horses, and
to procure a lay-habit for the Confessor,
the latter, once more alone with Ellena,
began to experience again somewhat of
the embarassments of conscience; and
Ellena, whenever her eyes glanced upon
him, suffered a solemnity of fear that rose
almost to terror. He, at length, termi∣nated
this emphatic silence, by renewing
his mention of Vivaldi, and his command
that Ellena should relate the history of
their affection. Not daring to refuse, she
obeyed, but with as much brevity as pos∣sible,
and Schedoni did not interrupt her
by a single observation. However eligible
their nuptials now appeared to him, he for∣bore
to give any hint of approbation, till
he should have extricated the object of her
regards from his perilous situation. But,
with Ellena, this very silence implied the
opinion it was meant to conceal, and,
encouraged by the hope it imparted, she
<PB N="347" REF="352"/>
ventured once more to ask, by whose order
Vivaldi had been arrested; whither he had
been conveyed, and the circumstances of
his present situation.</P>
<P>Too politic to intrust her with a know∣ledge
of his actual condition, the Confessor
spared her the anguish of learning that he
was a prisoner in the Inquisition. He af∣fected
ignorance of the late transaction at
Celano, but ventured to believe, that both
Vivaldi and herself had been arrested by
order of the Marchesa, who, he conjec∣tured,
had thrown him into temporary
confinement, a measure which she, no
doubt, had meant to enforce also towards
Ellena.</P>
<P>"And you, my father," observed Elle∣na,
"what brought you to my prison,—you
who was not informed with the Mar∣chesa's
designs? What accident conducted
you to that remote solitude, just at the
moment when you could save your
child!"</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="353"/>
"Informed of the Marchesa's designs!"
said Schedoni, with embarrassment and dis∣pleasure:
"Have you ever imagined that
I could be accessary—that I could consent
to assist, I mean could consent to be a con∣fidant
of such atrocious"—Schedoni,
bewildered, confounded, and half betrayed,
checked himself.</P>
<P>"Yet you have said, the Marchesa meant
only to confine me,!" observed Ellena;
"was that design so atrocious? Alas, my
father! I know too well that her plan was
more atrocious, and since you had too
much reason to know this, why do you
say that imprisonment only was intended
for me? But your solicitude for my tran∣quillity
leads you to"—</P>
<P>"What means," interrupted the suspi∣cious
Schedoni, "can I particularly have
of understanding the Marchesa's schemes?
I repeat, that I am not her confidant; how
then is it to be supposed I should know
that they extended further than to impri∣sonment?"</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="354"/>
"Did you not save me from the arm of
the assassin!" said Ellena tenderly; "did
not you wrench the very dagger from his
grasp!"</P>
<P>"I had forgotten, I had forgotten," said
the Consessor, yet more embarrassed.</P>
<P>"Yes, good minds are ever thus apt to
forget the benefits they confer," replied
Ellena. "But you shall find, my father,
that a grateful heart is equally tenacious to
remember them; it is the indelible regi∣ster
of every act that is dismissed from the
memory of the benefactor."</P>
<P>"Mention no more of benefits," said
Schedoni, impatiently; "let silence on this
subject henceforth indicate your wish to
oblige me."</P>
<P>He rose, and joined the host, who was
at the door of his cabin. Schedoni wish∣ed
to dismiss Spalatro as soon as possible,
and he enquired for a guide to conduct
him through that part of the forest, which
remained to be traversed. In this poor
<PB N="350" REF="355"/>
town, a person willing to undertake that
office was easily to be found, but the host
went in quest of a neighbour whom he had
recommended.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Spalatro returned, without
having succeeded in his commission. Not
any lay-habit could be procured, upon so
short a notice, that suited Schedoni. He
was obliged, therefore, to continue his
journey to the next town at least, in his
own dress, but the. necessity was not very
serious to him, since it was improbable that
he should be known in this obscure re∣gion.</P>
<P>Presently the host appeared with his neighbour,
when Schedoni, having receiv∣ed
satisfactory answers to his questions,
engaged him for the remainder of the fo∣rest-road,
and dismissed Spalatro. The
ruffian departed with sullen reluctance and
evident ill-will, circumstances which the
Confessor scarcely noticed, while occupied
by the satisfaction of escaping from the
<PB N="351" REF="356"/>
presence of the atrocious partner of his
conscience. But Ellena, as he passed her,
observed the malignant disappointment of
his look, and it served only to heighten
the thankfulness his departure occasioned
her.</P>
<P>It was afternoon before the travellers
proceeded. Schedoni had calculated that
they could easily reach the town, at which
they designed to pass the night, before the
close of evening, and he had been in no
haste to depart during the heat of the day.
Their track now lay through a country less
savage, though scarcely less wild than that
they had passed in the morning. It
emerged from the interior towards the
border of the forest; they were no lon∣ger
enclosed by impending mountains;
the withdrawing shades were no longer
impenetrable to the eye, but now and
then opened to gleams of sunshine-land∣scape,
and blue distances; and in the im∣mediate
scene, many a green glade spread
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
it's bosom to the sun. The grandeur of
the trees, however, did not decline; the
plane, the oak, and the chestnut still
threw a pomp of foliage round these smil∣ing
spots, and seemed to consecrate the
mountain streams, that descended beneath
their solemn shade.</P>
<P>To the harassed spirits of Ellena the
changing scenery was refreshing, and she
frequently yielded her cares to the in∣fluence
of majestic nature. Over the
gloom of Schedoni, no scenery had, at any
moment, power; the shape and paint of
external imagery gave neither impression
or colour to his fancy. He contemned the
sweet illusions, to which other spirits are
liable, and which often confer a delight
more exquisite, and not less innocent,
than any, which deliberative reason can
bestow.</P>
<P>The same thoughtful silence, that had
wrapt him at the beginning of the jour∣ney,
he still preserved, except when occa∣sionally
<PB N="353" REF="358"/>
he asked a question of the guide con∣cerning
the way, and received answers too
loquacious for his humour. This loqua∣city,
however, was not easily repressed, and
the peasant had already begun to relate
some terrible stories of murder, committed
in these forests upon people, who had been
hardy enough to venture into them with∣out
a guide, before the again abstracted
Schedoni even noticed that he spoke.
Though Ellena did not give much credit
to these narratives, they had some effect
upon her fears, when soon after she entered
the deep shades of a part of the forest, that
lay along a narrow defile, whence every
glimpse of cheerful landscape was again ex∣cluded
by precipices, which towered on ei∣ther
side. The stilness was not less effectual
than the gloom, for no sounds were heard,
except such as seemed to characterize soli∣tude,
and impress it's awful power more
deeply on the heart,—the hollow dash∣ing
of torrents descending distantly, and the
<PB N="354" REF="359"/>
deep sighings of the wind, as it passed
among trees, which threw their broad arms
over the cliffs, and crowned the highest
summits. Onward, through the narrow∣ing
windings of the defile, no living object
appeared; but, as Ellena looked fearfully
back, she thought she distinguished a hu∣man
figure advancing beneath the dusky
umbrage that closed the view. She com∣municated
her suspicion to Schedoni,
though not her fears, and they stopped
for a moment, to observe further. The
object advanced slowly, and they perceived
the stature of a man, who, having conti∣nued
to approach, suddenly paused, and
then glided away behind the foliage that
crossed the perspective, but not before
Ellena fancied she discriminated the figure
of Spalatro, None but a purpose the
most desperate, she believed, could have
urged him to follow into this pass, instead
of returning, as he had pretended, to his
home. Yet it appeared improbable, that
<PB N="355" REF="360"/>
he alone should be willing to attack two
armed persons, for both Schedoni and the
guide had weapons of defence. This con∣sideration
afforded her only a momentary
respite from apprehension, since it was pos∣sible
that he might not be alone, though
only one person had yet been seen among
the shrouding branches of the woods.
"Did you not think he resembled Spala∣tro?"
said Ellena to the Confessor, "was
he not of the same stature and air? You are
well armed, or I should fear for you, as
well as for myself."</P>
<P>"I did not observe a resemblance,"
replied Schedoni, throwing a glance back,
"but whoever he is, you have nothing
to apprehend from him, for he has dis∣appeared."</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor, so much the worse,"
observed the guide, "so much the
worse, if he means us any harm, for he
can steal along the rocks behind these
thickets, and strike out upon us before
<PB N="356" REF="361"/>
we are aware of him. Or, if he knows
the path that runs among those old oaks
yonder, on the left, where the ground
rises, he has us sure at the turning of
the next cliff."</P>
<P>" Speak lower," said Schedoni, " un∣less
you mean that he should benefit by
your instructions."</P>
<P>Though the Confessor said this without
any suspicion of evil intention from the
guide, the man immediately began to
justify himself, and added, " I'll give him
a hint of what he may expect, however,
if he attacks us." As he spoke, he fired
his trombone in the air, when every rock
reverberated the sound, and the faint
and fainter thunder retired in murmurs
through all the windings of the defile.
The eagerness, with which the guide had
justified himself, produced an effect upon
Schedoni contrary to what he designed;
and the Confessor, as he watched him
suspiciously, observed, that after he had
<PB N="357" REF="362"/>
fired, he did not load his piece again.
" Since you have given the enemy suffi∣cient
intimation where to find us," said
Schedoni, " you will do well to prepare
for his reception; load again, friend. I
have arms too, and they are ready."</P>
<P>While the man sullenly obeyed, El∣lena,
again alarmed, looked back in search
of the stranger, but not any person ap∣peared
beneath the gloom, and no foot∣step
broke upon the stilness. When,
however, she suddenly heard a rustling
noise, she looked to the bordering thick∣ets,
almost expecting to see Spalatro break
from among them, before she perceived
that it was only the sounding pinions of
birds, which, startled by the report of
the trombone from their high nests in
the cliffs, winged their way from danger.</P>
<P>The suspicions of the Confessor had,
probably, been slight, for they were tran∣sient;
and when Ellena next addressed
him, he had again retired within himself.
He was ruminating upon an excuse to be
<PB N="358" REF="363"/>
offered the Marchesa, which might be
sufficient both to assuage her disappoint∣ment
and baffle her curiosity, and he
could not, at present, fabricate one that
might soothe her resentment, without
risk of betraying his secret.</P>
<P>Twilight had added its gloom to that
of the rocks, before the travellers distin∣guished
the town, at which they meant to
pass the night. It terminated the defile,
and its grey houses could scarcely be dis∣cerned
from the precipice upon which
they hung, or from the trees that em∣bosomed
them. A rapid stream rolled
below, and over it a bridge conducted
the wanderers to the little inn, at which
they were to take up their abode. Here,
quietly lodged, Ellena dismissed all present
apprehension of Spalatro, but she still
believed she had seen him, and her suspi∣cions,
as to the motive of his extraordinary
journey, were not appeased.</P>
<P>As this was a town of ampler accom∣modation
than the one they had left, Sche∣doni
<PB N="359" REF="364"/>
easily procured a lay-habit, that
would disguise him for the remainder of
the journey; and Ellena was permitted to
lay aside the nun's veil, for one of a more
general fashion; but, in dismissing it, she
did not forget that it had been the veil of
Olivia, and she preserved it as a sacred
relique of her favourite recluse.</P>
<P>The distance between this town and
Naples was still that of several days jour∣ney,
according to the usual mode of tra∣velling;
but the most dangerous part of
the way was now overcome, the road
having emerged from the forests; and
when Schedoni, on the following morn∣ing,
was departing, he would have dis∣charged
the guide, had not the host
assured him, he would find one still neces∣sary
in the open, but wild, country through
which he must pass. Schedoni's distrust
of this guide had never been very serious,
and, as the result of the preceding even∣ing
proved favourable, he had restored
him so entirely to his confidence, as will∣ingly
<PB N="360" REF="365"/>
to engage him for the present day.
In this confidence, however, Ellena did not
perfectly coincide; she had observed the
man while he loaded the trombone, on
Schedoni's order, and his evident reluc∣tance
had almost persuaded her, that he
was in league with some person who de∣signed
to attack them; a conjecture, per∣haps,
the more readily admitted while her
mind was suffering from the impression of
having seen Spalatro. She now ventured
to hint her distrust to the Confessor, who
paid little attention to it, and reminded
her, that sufficient proof of the man's
honesty had appeared, in their having been
permitted to pass in safety, a defile so con∣venient
for the purpose of rapine as that
of yesterday. To a reply apparently so
reasonable, Ellena could oppose nothing,
had she even dared to press the topic;
and she re-commenced the journey with
gayer hopes.</P>
