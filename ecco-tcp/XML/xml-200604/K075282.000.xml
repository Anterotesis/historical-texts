<HEAD>THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS GRAY was born in Cornhill, in the
city of London, on the 26th of December, 1716.
His father, Philip Gray, was a money-scrivener; but
being of an indolent and profuse disposition, he rather
diminished than improved his paternal fortune. Our
Author received his classical education at Eton school,
under Mr. Antrobus, his mother's brother, a man
of sound learning and refined taste, who directed his
nephew to those pursuits which laid the foundation of
his future literary fame.</P>
<P>During his continuance at Eton, he contracted a
friendship with Mr. Horace Walpole, well known for
his knowledge in the fine arts; and Mr. Richard
West, son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, a youth
of very promising talents.</P>
<P>When he left Eton school in 1734, he went to
Cambridge, and entered a pensioner at Peterhouse, at
the recommendation of his uncle Antrobus, who had
been a fellow of that college. It is said that, from
his effeminacy and fair complexion, he acquired,
among his fellow students, the appellation of <HI>Miss</HI>
Gray, to which the delicacy of his manners seems not
a little to have contributed. Mr. Walpole was at
that time a fellow-commoner of King's College, in the
same University; a fortunate circumstance, which af∣forded
Gray frequent opportunities of intercourse with
his Honourable Friend.</P>
<P>Mr. West went from Eton to Christ Church. Ox∣ford;
and in this state of separation, these two vo∣taries
of the Muses, whose dispositions were conge∣nial,
commenced an epistolary correspondence, part of
which is published by Mr. Mason, a gentleman whose
character stands high in the republic of letters.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Gray, having imbibed a taste for poetry, did not
relish those abstruse studies which generally occupy
the minds of students at College; and therefore, as he
found very little gratification from academical pursuits,
he left Cambridge in 1738, and returned to London,
intending to apply himself to the study of the law:
but this intention was soon laid aside, upon an invita∣tion
given him by Mr. Walpole, to accompany him
in his travels abroad; a situation highly preferable,
in Gray's opinion, to the dry study of the law.</P>
<P>They set out together for France, and visited most
of the places worthy of notice in that country: from
thence they proceeded to Italy, where an unfortunate
dispute taking place between them, a separation ensued
upon their arrival at Florence. Mr. Walpole after∣wards,
with great candour and liberality, took upon
himself the blame of the quarrel; though, if we
consider the matter coolly and impartially, we may be
induced to conclude that Gray, from a conscious su∣periority
of ability, might have claimed a deference
to his opinion and judgment, which his Honourable
Friend was not at that time disposed to admit: the
rupture, however, was very unpleasant to both par∣ties.</P>
<P>Gray pursued his journey to Venice on an economic
plan, suitable to the circumscribed state of his finan∣ces;
and having continued there some weeks, returned
to England in September, 1741. He appears, from
his letters, published by Mr. Mason, to have paid the
minutest attention to every object worthy of notice
throughout the course of his travels. His descriptions
are lively and picturesque, and bear particular marks
of his genius and disposition. We admire the sub∣limity
of his ideas when he ascends the stupendous
heights of the Alps, and are charmed with his display
of nature, decked in all the beauties of vegetation.
Indeed, abundant information, as well as entertain∣ment,
may be derived from his casual letters.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
In about two months after his arrival in England,
he lost his father, who, by an indiscreet profusion, had
so impaired his fortune, as not to admit of his son's
prosecuting the study of the law with that degree of
respectability which the nature of the profession re∣quires,
without becoming burthensome to his mother
and aunt. To obviate, therefore, their importunities
on the subject, he went to Cambridge, and took his
bachelor's degree in civil law.</P>
<P>But the inconveniencies and distress attached to a
scanty fortune were not the only ills our Poet had to
encounter at this time: he had not only lost the friend∣ship
of Mr. Walpole abroad, but poor West, the
partner of his heart, fell a victim to complicated ma∣ladies,
brought on by family misfortunes, on the 1st
of June, 1742, at Popes, a village, in Hertfordshire,
where he went for the benefit of the air.</P>
<P>The excessive degree in which his mind was agita∣ted
for the loss of his friend, will best appear from the
following beautiful little sonnet:
<Q><L>" In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,</L>
<L>" And redd'ning Poebus lifts his go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den fire:</L>
<L>" The birds in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain their am'rous descant join,</L>
<L>" Or cheerful fields resume their green attire:</L>
<L>" These ears, alas! for other notes repine;</L>
<L>" A different object do these eyes require;</L>
<L>" My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine,</L>
<L>" And in my breast th' imperfect joys expire;</L>
<L>" Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,</L>
<L>" And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;</L>
<L>" The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;</L>
<L>" To warn their little loves the birds comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain:</L>
<L>" I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear;</L>
<L>" And weep the more, because I weep in vain.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gray now seems to have applied his mind very
sedulously to poetical composition: his <HI>Ode to Spring</HI>
was written early in June, to his friend Mr. West,
before he received the melancholy news of his death:
how our Poet's susceptible mind was affected by that
melancholy incident, is evidently demonstrated by the
lines quoted above; the impression, indeed, appears
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
to have been too deep to be soon effaced; and the te∣nour
of the subjects which called for the exertions of his
poetical talents subsequent to the production of this
Ode, corroborates that observation; these were his
<HI>Prospect of Eton,</HI> and his <HI>Ode to Adversity.</HI> It is also
supposed, and with great probability, that he began
his <HI>Elegy in a Country Church Yard</HI> about the same
time. He passed some weeks at Stoke, near Windsor,
where his mother and aunt resided, and in that pleasing
retirement finished several of his most celebrated
Poems.</P>
<P>From thence he returned to Cambridge, which,
from this period, was his chief residence during the
remainder of his life. The conveniencies with which
a college life was attended, to a person of his narrow
fortune, and studious turn of mind, were more than
a compensation for the dislike which, for several rea∣sons,
he bore to the place: but he was perfectly re∣conciled
to his situation, on Mr. Mason's being elected
a fellow of Pembroke-Hall; a circumstance which
brought him a companion, who, during life, re∣tained
for him the highest degree of friendship and
esteem.</P>
<P>In 1742 he was admittted to the degree of Batchelor
in the Civil Law, as appears from a letter written to
his particular friend Dr. Wharton, of Old Park,
near Durham, formerly fellow of Pembroke Hall,
Cambridge, in which he ridicules, with much point
and humour, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lies and foibles, and the dullness
and formality, which prevailed in the University.</P>
<P>In order to enrich his mind with the ideas of others,
he devoted a considerable portion of his time to the
study of the best Greek authors; so that, in the course
or six years, there were hardly any writers of emi∣nence
in that language whose works he had not only
read, but thoroughly digested.</P>
<P>His attention, however, to the Greek classics, did
not wholly engross his time; for he found leisure
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
to advert, in a new sarcastical manner, to the igno∣rance
and dullness with which he was surrounded,
though situated in the centre of learning. There is
only a fragment remaining of what he had written on
this subject, from which it may be inferred, that it
was intended as an <HI>Hymn to Ignorance.</HI> The fragment
is wholly introductory; yet many of the lines are so
pointed in signification, and harmonious in versifica∣tion,
that they will be admitted, by the admirers of
verse, to display his poetical talents with more bril∣liancy
than appears in many of his lyric productions.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Hail, horrors, hail! ye ever gloomy bowers,</L>
<L>Ye Gothic fanes, and antiquated towers!</L>
<L>Where rushy Camus' slowly-winding flood</L>
<L>Perpetual draws his humid train of mud:</L>
<L>Glad I revisit thy neglected reign:</L>
<L>Oh, take me to thy peaceful shade again:</L>
<L>But chiefly thee, whose influence, breath'd from high,</L>
<L>Augments the native darkness of the sky.</L>
<L>Ah, Ignorance! soft, salutary power!</L>
<L>Prostrate with filial reverence I adore.</L>
<L>Thrice hath Hyperion roll'd his annual race,</L>
<L>Since weeping I forsook thy fond embrace.</L>
<L>Oh, say, successful dost thou still oppose,</L>
<L>Thy leaden Aegis 'gainst our ancient foes?</L>
<L>Still stretch, tenacious of thy right divine,</L>
<L>The massy sceptre o'er thy slumbering line?</L>
<L>And dews Lethean through the land dispense,</L>
<L>To steep in slumbers each benighted sense?</L>
<L>If any spark of wit's delusive ray</L>
<L>Break out, and flash a momentary day,</L>
<L>With damp, cold touch forbid it to aspire,</L>
<L>And huddle up in fogs the dangerous fire.</L>
<L>Oh, say—She hears me not, but, careless grown,</L>
<L>Lethargic nods upon her ebon throne.</L>
<L>Goddess! awake, arise; alas! my fears;</L>
<L>Can powers immortal feel the force of years?</L>
<L>Not thus of old, with ensigns wide unfurl'd,</L>
<L>She rode triumphant o'er the vanquish'd world:</L>
<L>Fierce nations own'd her unresisted might;</L>
<L>And all was ignorance, and all was night;</L>
<L>Oh sacred age! Oh times for ever lost!</L>
<L>(The schoolman's glory, and the churchman's boast,)</L>
<L>For ever gone—yet still to fancy new,</L>
<L>Her rapid wings the transient scene pursue,</L>
<L>And bring the buried ages back to view.</L>
<L>High on her car, behold the grandam ride,</L>
<L>Like old Sefostris with barbaric pride;</L>
<L>***** a team of harness'd monarchs' bend</L><L>*****</L></Q>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>
In 1744 he seems to have given up his attention to
the Muses. Mr. Walpole, desirous of preserving
what he had already written, as well as perpetuating
the merit of their deceased friend, West, endea∣voured
to prevail with Gray, to whom he had previ∣ously
become reconciled, to publish his own Poems,
together with those of West; but Gray declined it,
conceiving their productions united would not suffice
to fill even a small volume.</P>
<P>In 1747 Gray became acquainted with Mr. Mason,
then a scholar of St. John's College, and afterwards
Fellow of Pembroke Hall. Mr. Mason, who was
a man of great learning and ingenuity, had written,
the year before, his "Monody on the Death of Pope,"
and his "II Bellicoso," and "Il Pacifico;" and Gray
revised these pieces at the request of a friend. This
laid the foundation of a friendship that terminated
but with life: and Mr. Mason, after the death of
Gray, testified his regard for him, by superintending
the publication of his works.</P>
<P>The same year he wrote a little Ode on the Death
of a favourite Cat of Mr. Walpole's, in which hu∣mour
and instruction are happily blended: but the fol∣lowing
year he produced an effort of much more im∣portance;
the Fragment of an <HI>Essay on the Alliance of
Education and Government.</HI> Its tendency was to de∣monstrate
the necessary concurrence of both to form
great and useful Men. It opens with the two follow∣ing
similies. The exordium is rather uncommon;
but he seems to have adopted it as a kind of clue to
the subject he meant to pursue in the subsequent part
of the Poem.</P>

<L>As sickly plants betray a niggard earth,</L>
<L>Whose barren bosom starves her gen'rous birth,</L>

<L>And as in climes, where Winter holds his reign,</L>
<L>The soil, tho' fertile, will not teem in vain,</L>
<L>Forbids her gems to swell, her shades to rise,</L>
<L>Nor trusts her blossoms to the charlish skies;</L>
<L>So draw mankind in vain the vital airs,</L>

<L><PB N="xi" REF="10"/> That health and vigour to the soul impart,</L>

<L>Light golden show'rs of plenty o'er the land:</L>
<L>But Tyranny has fix'd her empire there,</L>
<L>To check their tender hopes with chilling fear,</L>

<L>That rise and glitter o'er the ambient tide?</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>It is much to be lamented that our Author did not
finish what was so successfully begun, as the Fragment
is deemed superior to every thing in the same style of
writing which our language can boast.</P>
<P>In 1750 he put his finishing stroke to his <HI>Elegy writ∣ten
in a Country Church-yard,</HI> which was communi∣cated
first to his friend Mr. Walpole, and by him to
many persons of rank and distinction. This beauti∣ful
production introduced the author to the favour of
Lady Cobham, and gave occasion to a singular compo∣sition,
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
called, <HI>A Long Story</HI>; in which various effu∣sions
of wit and humour are very happily interspersed.</P>
<P>The Elegy having found its way into the "Maga∣zine
of Magazines," the Author wrote to Mr. Wal∣pole,
requesting he would put it into the hands of Mr.
Dodsley, and order him to print it immediately, in
order to rescue it from the disgrace it might have in∣curred
by its appearance in a Magazine. The Elegy
was the most popular of all our Author's productions;
it ran through eleven editions, and was translated
into Latin by Anstey and Roberts; and in the same
year a version of it was published by Lloyd. Mr.
Bentley, an eminent Artist of that time, wishing to
decorate this elegant composition with every ornament
of which it is so highly deserving, drew for it a set of
designs, as he also did for the rest of Gray's
produc∣tions,
for which the artist was liberally repaid by the
Author in some beautiful Stanzas, but unfortunately
no perfect copy of them remains. The following,
however, are given as a specimen:
<Q><LG>
<L>" In silent gaze the tuneful choir among,</L>

<P>It appears, by a letter to Dr. Wharton, that Gray
finished his Ode on the <HI>Progress of Poetry</HI> early in 1755.
The <HI>Bard</HI> also was begun about the same time; and
the following beautiful Fragment on the <HI>Pleasure ari∣sing
from Vicissitude</HI> the next year. The merit of the
two former pieces was not immediately perceived, nor
generally acknowledged. Garrick wrote a few lines
in their praise. Lloyd and Colman wrote, in concert,
two Odes to "Oblivion" and "Obscurity," in which
they were ridiculed with much ingenuity.</P>

<P>Our Author's reputation, as a Poet, was so high,
that, on the death of Colley Cibber, in 1757, he had
the honour of refusing the office of Poet-Laureat, to
which he was probably induced by the disgrace brought
upon it through the inability of some who had filled it.</P>
<P>His curiosity some time after drew him away from
Cambridge to a lodging near the British Museum,
where he resided near three years, reading and tran∣scribing.</P>
<P>In 1762, on the death of Mr. Turner, Professor
of Modern Languages and History at Cambridge, he
was, according to his own expression, "cockered and
spirited up" to apply to Lord Bute for the succession.
His Lordship refused him with all the politeness of a
courtier, the office having been previously promised to
Mr. Brocket, the tutor of Sir James Lowther.</P>
<P>His health being on the decline, in 1765 he under∣took
a journey to Scotland, conceiving he should de∣rive
benefit from exercise and change of situation.
His account of that country, as far as it extends, is
curious and elegant; for as his mind was comprehen∣sive,
it was employed in the contemplation of all the
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
works of art, all the appearances of nature, and all
the monuments of past events.</P>
<P>During his stay in Scotland, he contracted a friend∣ship
with Dr. Beattie, in whom he found, as he him∣self
expresses it, a poet, a philosopher, and a good
man. Through the intervention of his friend the
Doctor, the Marischal College at Aberdeen offered
him the degree of Doctor of Laws, which he thought
it decent to decline, having omitted to take it at
Cambridge.</P>
<P>In December, 1767, Dr. Beattie, still desirous that
his country should leave a memento of its regard to
the merit of our Poet, solicited his permission to
print, at the University of Glasgow, an elegant edi∣tion
of his works. Gray could not comply with his
friend's request, as he had given his promise to Mr.
Dodsley. However, as a compliment to them both,
he presented them with a copy, containing a few
notes, and the imitations of the old Norwegian poetry,
intended to supplant the Long Story, which was printed
at first to illustrate Mr. Bentley's designs.</P>
<P>In 1768 our Author obtained that office without
solicitation, for which he had before applied without
effect. The Professorship of Languages and History
again became vacant, and he received an offer of it
from the Duke of Grafton, who had succeeded Lord
Bute in office. The place was valuable in itself, the
salary being 400l. a year; but it was rendered peculi∣arly
acceptable to Mr. Gray, as he obtained it with∣out
solicitation.</P>
<P>Soon after he succeeded to this office, the impaired
state of his health rendered another journey necessary;
and he visited, in 1769, the counties of Westmoreland
and Cumberland. His remarks on the wonderful
scenery which these northern regions display, he trans∣mitted
in epistolary journals to his friend, Dr. Whar∣ton,
which abound, according to Mr. Mason's elegant
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
diction, with all the wildness of Salvator, and the
softness of Claude.</P>
<P>He appears to have been much affected by the anxiety
he felt at holding a place without discharging the du∣ties
annexed to it. He had always designed reading
lectures, but never put it in practice; and a consci∣ousness
of this neglect contributed not a little to in∣crease
the malady under which he had long laboured:
nay, the office at length became so irksome, that he
seriously proposed to resign it.</P>
<P>Towards the close of May, 1771, he removed from
Cambridge to London, after having suffered violent
attacks of an hereditary gout, to which he had long
been subject, notwithstanding he had observed the most
rigid abstemiousness throughout the whole course of
his life. By the advice of his physicians, he removed
from London to Kensington; the air of which place
proved so salutary, that he was soon enabled to return
to Cambridge, whence he designed to make a visit to
his friend Dr. Wharton, at Old Park, near Durham;
indulging a fond hope that the excursion would tend
to the re-establishment of his health: but, alas! that
hope proved delusive. On the 24th of July he was
seized, while at dinner in the College hall, with a sud∣den
nausea, which obliged him to retire to his cham∣ber.
The gout had fixed on his stomach in such a
degree as to resist all the powers of medicine. On the
29th he was attacked with a strong convulsion, which
returned with increased violence the ensuing day; and
on the evening of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st of May, 177<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he departed
this life in the 55th year of his age.</P>
<P>From the narrative of his friend, Mr. Mason, it
appears, that Gray was actuated by motives of self
improvement, and self gratification, in his application
to the Muses, rather than any view to pecuniary emo∣lument.
His pursuits were in general disinterested;
and as he was free from avarice on the one hand, so
was he from extravagance on the other; being one of
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
those few characters in the annals of literature, espe∣cially
in the poetical class, who are devoid of self in∣terest,
and at the same time attentive to economy; but
Mr. Mason adds, that he was induced to decline tak∣ing
any advantage of his literary productions by a de∣gree
of pride, which influenced him to disdain the idea
of being thought an author by profession.</P>
<P>It appears, from the same narrative, that Gray
made considerable progress in the study of architecture,
particularly the gothic. He endeavoured to trace this
branch of the science, from the period of its com∣mencement,
through its various changes, till it ar∣rived
at its perfection in the time of Henry VIII.
He applied himself also to the study of heraldry, of
which he obtained a very competent knowledge, as
appears from his <HI>Remarks on Saxon Churches,</HI> in the
introduction to Mr. Bentham's <HI>History of Ely.</HI></P>
<P>But the favourite study of Gray, for the last two
years of his life, was natural history, which he rather
resumed than began, as he had acquired some know∣ledge
of botany in early life, while he was under the
tuition of his uncle Antrobus. He wrote copious
marginal notes to the works of Linnaeus, and other
writers in the three kingdoms of nature: and Mr.
Mason further observes, that, excepting pure mathe∣matics,
and the studies dependent on that science,
there was hardly any part of human learning in which
he had not acquired a competent skill; in most of them
a consummate mastery.</P>
<P>Mr. Mason has declined drawing any formal charac∣ter
of him; but has adopted one from a letter to
James Boswell, Esq. by the Rev. Mr. Temple, Rec∣tor
of St. Gluvias, in Cornwall, first printed anony∣mously
in the London Magazine, which, as we con∣ceive
authentic, from the sanction of Mr. Mason, we
shall therefore transcribe.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Perhaps he was the most learned man in Europe.
He was equally acquainted with the elegant and pro∣found
parts of science, and that not superficially, but
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
thoroughly. He knew every branch of history, both
natural and civil; had read all the original historians
of England, France, and Italy; and was a great anti∣quarian.
Criticism, metaphysics, morals, and politics,
made a principal part of his study; voyages and tra∣vels
of all sorts were his favourite amusements; and
he had a fine taste in painting, prints, architecture,
and gardening. With such a fund of knowledge, his
conversation must have been equally instructive and
entertaining; but he was also a good man, a man of
virtue and humanity. There is no character without
some speck, some imperfection; and I think the greatest
defect in his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather
effeminacy, and a visible fastidiousness, or contempt and
disdain of his inferiors in science. He also had, in
some degree, that weakness which disgusted Voltaire
so much in Mr. Congreve: though he seemed to value
others chiefly according to the progress they had made
in knowledge, yet he could not bear to be considered
himself merely as a man of letters; and though with∣out
birth, or fortune, or station, his desire was to be
looked upon as a private independent gentleman, who
read for his amusement. Perhaps it may be said, What
signifies so much knowledge, when it produced so little?
Is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial
but a few Poems? But let it be considered that Mr.
Gray was, to others, at least innocently employed;
to himself, certainly beneficially. His time passed
agreeably; he was every day making some new ac∣quisition
in science; his mind was enlarged, his heart
softened, his virtue strengthened; the world and man∣kind
were shewn to him without a mask; and he was
taught to consider every thing as trifling, and unworthy
of the attention of a wise man, except the pursuit of
knowledge and practice of virtue, in that state wherein
God hath placed us.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to this character, Mr. Mason has re∣marked,
that Gray's effeminacy was affected most
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
before those whom he did not wish to please; and that
he is unjustly charged with making knowledge his
sole reason of preference, as he paid his esteem to none
whom he did not likewise believe to be good.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson makes the following observations:—
<Q REND="inline">What has occurred to me, from the slight inspection
of his letters, in which my undertaking has engaged
me, is, that his mind had a large grasp; that his
curiosity was unlimited, and his judgment cultivated;
that he was a man likely to love much where he loved
at all, but that he was fastidious, and hard to please.
His contempt, however, is often employed, where I
hope it will be approved, upon scepticism and inside∣lity.
His short account of Shaftesbury I will insert.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">You say you cannot conceive how lord Shastes∣bury
came to be a philosopher in vogue; I will tell
you: first, he was a lord; secondly, he was as vain
as any of his readers; thirdly, men are very prone to
believe what they do not understand; fourthly, they
will believe any thing at all, provided they are under
no obligation to believe it; fifthly, they love to take
a new road, even when that road leads no where;
sixthly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and seems al∣ways
to mean more than he said. Would you have
any more reasons? An interval of above forty years has
pretty well destroyed the charm. A dead lord ranks
with commoners: vanity is no longer interested in the
matter; for a new road is become an old one.</Q></P>
<P>As a writer he had this peculiarity, that he did not
write his pieces first rudely, and then correct them,
but laboured every line as it arose in the train of com∣position;
and he had a notion not very peculiar, that
he could not write but at certain times, or at happy
moments; a fantastic foppery, to which our kindness
for a man of learning and of virtue wishes him to
have been superior.</P>
<P>As a Poet he stands high in the estimation of the
candid and judicious. His works are not numerous;
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
but they bear the marks of intense application, and
careful revision. The Elegy in the Churchyard is
deemed his master-piece; the subject is interesting, the
sentiment simple and pathetic, and the versification
charmingly melodious. This beautiful composition
has been often selected by orators for the display of
their rhetorical talents. But as the most finished pro∣ductions
of the human mind have not escaped censure,
the works of our Author have undergone illiberal
comments. His Elegy has been supposed defective in
want of plan. Dr. Knox, in his Essays, has ob∣served,
<Q REND="inline">that it is thought by some to be no more
than a confused heap of splendid ideas, thrown toge∣ther
without order and without proportion.</Q> Some
passages have been censured by Kelly in the <HI>Babbler</HI>;
and imitations of different authors have been pointed
out by other critics. But these imitations cannot be
ascertained, as there are numberless instances of coin∣cidence
of ideas; so that it is difficult to say, with pre∣cision,
what is or is not a designed or accidental imitation.</P>
<P>Gray, in his Elegy in the Church-yard, has great
merit in adverting to the most interesting passions of
the human mind; yet his genius is not marked alone
by the tender sensibility so conspicuous in that elegant
piece; but there is a sublimity which gives it an equal
claim to universal admiration.</P>
<P>His Odes on <HI>The Progress of Poetry,</HI> and of <HI>The
Bard,</HI> according to Mr. Mason's account, <Q REND="inline">breathe
the high spirit of lyric enthusiasm. The transitions
are sudden and impetuous; the language full of fire
and force; and the imagery carried, without impro∣priety,
to the most daring height. They have been
accused of obscurity: but the one can be obscure to
those only who have not read Pindar; and the other
only to those who are unacquainted with the history of
our own nation.</Q></P>
<P>Of his other lyric pieces, Mr. Wakefield, a learned
and ingenious commentator, observes, that, though,
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
like all other human productions, they are not with∣out
their defects, yet the spirit of poetry, and exqui∣site
charms of the verse, are more then a compensation
for those defects. The Ode on <HI>Eton College</HI> abounds
with sentiments natural, and consonant to the feelings
of humanity, exhibited with perspicuity of method,
and in elegant, intelligible, and expressive language.
The Sonnet on <HI>the Death of West,</HI> and the Epitaph on
Sir <HI>William Williams,</HI> are as perfect compositions of
the kind as any in our language.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson was confessedly a man of great genius;
but the partial and uncandid mode of criticism he
has adopted in his remarks on the writings of Gray,
has given to liberal minds great and just offence. Ac∣cording
to Mr. Mason's account, he has subjected
Gray's poetry to the most rigorous examination. De∣clining
all consideration of the general plan and con∣duct
of the pieces, he has confined himself solely to
strictures on words and forms of expression; and Mr.
Mason very pertinently adds, that <HI>verbal</HI> criticism is
an ordeal which the most perfect composition cannot
pass without injury.</P>
<P>He has also fallen under Mr. Wakefield's severest
censure. This commentator affirms, that <Q REND="inline">he thinks
a refutation of his strictures upon Gray a necessary
service to the public, without which they might ope∣rate
with a malignant influence upon the national taste.
His censure, however, is too general, and expressed
with too much vehemence; and his remarks betray,
upon the whole, an unreasonable fastidiousness of taste,
and an unbecoming illiberality of spirit. He appears
to have turned an unwilling eye upon the beauties of
Gray, because his jealousy would not suffer him to
see such superlative merit in a cotemporary.</Q> These
remarks of Mr. Wakefield appear to be well founded;
and it has been observed, by another writer, that
Dr. Johnson, being strongly influenced by his politi∣cal
and religious principles, was inclined to treat with
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>
the utmost severity some of the productions of our
best writers; to which may be imputed that severity
with which he censures the lyric performances of Gray.
It is highly probable that no one poetical reader will
universally subscribe to his decisions, though all may
admire his vast intuitive knowledge, and power of
discrimination.</P>
<P>In the first copy of this exquisite Poem, Mr. Mason
observes, the conclusion was different from that which
the Author afterwards composed; and though his
after-thought was unquestionably the best, yet there
is a pathetic melancholy in the four stanzas that were
rejected, following, "With incense kindled at the
Muses' flame," which highly claim preservation.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>The thoughtless wor'd to Majesty may bow,</L>
<L>Exalt the brave, and idolize success;</L>
<L>But more to innocence their safety owe,</L>

<LG>
<L>Hark! how the sacred calm, that breathes around,</L>

<L>Pursue the silent tenor or thy doom.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>In one instance, the Doctor's inconsistency, and de∣viation
from his general character, does him honour.
After having commented with the most rigid severity
on the poetical works of Gray, as it conscious of the
injustice done him, he seems to apologize by the fol∣lowing
declaration, which concludes his Criticism, and
shall conclude the Memoirs of our Author.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">In the character of his Elegy (says Johnson) I
rejoice and concur with the common reader; for, by
the common sense of readers, uncorrupted with literary
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>
prejudices, after all the refinements of subtilty, and
the dogmatism of learning, must be finally decided all
claim to poetical honours. The <HI>Church-yard</HI> abounds
with images which find a mirror in every mind, and
with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo.
The four stanzas beginning, <HI>Yet e'en these bones</HI> are
to me original; I have never seen the notions in any
other place; yet he that reads them here, persuades
himself that he has always felt them. Had Gray
written often thus, it had been vain to blame, and
useless to praise him.</Q></P>

<P>IN the 11th Century, Sigurd, Earl of the Orkney Islands, went with a Fleet
of Ships and a considerable Body of Troops, into Ireland, to the Assistance of
Sigtryg with the silken Beard, who was then making War on his Father-in Law,
Brian, King of Dublin. The Earl and all his Forces were cut to Pieces, and
Sigtryg was in Danger of a total Defeat; but the Enemy had a greater Loss
by the Death of Brian, their King, who fell in the Action. On Christmas-day
(the Day of the Battle) a Native of Caithness in Scotland, saw, at a Distance,
a Number of Persons on Horseback riding full speed towards a Hill, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeming
to enter into it. Curiosity led him to follow them, till, looking through an opening
in the Rocks, he saw Twelve gigantic Figures, resembling Women: they were all
employed about a Loom; and as they wove they sung the following dreadful Song,
which, when they had finished, they tore the Web into twelve Pieces, and each
taking her Portion, gallopped six to the North, and as many to the South.</P>
