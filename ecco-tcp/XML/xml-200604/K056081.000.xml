<HEAD>An ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MEN, in delineating the divine attri∣butes,
have too generally blended with
them all their own imperfections. Their
several, separate interests, and contradictory pas∣sions,
have led them, even under the character of
<HI>the One God,</HI> to represent to us almost as many dif∣ferent
gods, as impeached the wisdom, disgraced
the worship, and sullied all the glory of the antient
Greeks and Romans. Nay, the same persons, in
their very <HI>Harmonies,</HI> have represented one attri∣bute,
as a flat contradiction to another. Blind
and presumptuous creatures! It is well for your∣selves,
that your jarring systems cannot at all af∣fect
the real character of the Supreme Being. To
the joy of the whole universe, whatever you have
said, and whatever you may still say, <HI>God is the
same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But, should it be still asked, To what causes are
we to ascribe the monstrous misrepresentations of
the Deity which daily occur? After what has been
said above, I need only reply, Is not the cause
quite obvious? Or, if desired to explain myself
more particularly, I would observe, That men,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
instead of seriously consulting the works and will
of God, and hence inferring what his perfections
are, have, on the contrary, regarded only their
own tempers and inclinations, and, to vindicate
all the follies and impieties arising from these, have
endeavoured to persuade the world, that the
peerless Jehovah is <HI>altogether such a one as them∣selves.</HI>
As men have been interchangeably actuated
with different malignant passions, they have pro∣portionably
represented to themselves a God, who
would be pleased with such worshippers. And thus
have they, at different times, endeavoured to di∣vest
him of his most honourable perfections: they
have repeatedly, indeed, been so glaringly incon∣sistent
with themselves, as to adore him, in the
same breath, as <HI>the Father of all mercies,</HI> and as <HI>a
Being without any mercy at all,</HI> that is, a <HI>reprobating
God.</HI></P>
<P>But, of all the perfections of the ever blessed
God, his justice has perhaps, in general, been the
least understood. However, under no other cha∣racteristic
whatever, has he been so shockingly
misrepresented and blasphemed. The justice of
God, indeed, has been frequently described in
such a light, as supposed him dispossessed of every
endearing excellency, as declared him not the
Friend and Father, but the merciless Tyrant of the
universe, and as led us to think upon his holy
name, not with hope, confidence, and joy. but
with all the trembling horrors of despair. Men, in
vindicating what they called the Justice of God, have
too often lost fight of his goodness; nay, have en∣tertained
and propagated such ideas of justice, as
absolutely militated against the possibility of good∣ness,
and as forbad us to consider him as at all
merciful, gracious, compassionate, forbearing, and
long-suffering. This has been always the case,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
when justice has been represented as an essential
obligation, or unchangeable disposition in the Su∣preme
Being, to punish every the least offence,
iniquity, transgression, or sin, in every rational
creature, or, when by saying, that <Q>God was
just,</Q> it was meant, that, <Q>there was no for∣giveness
with him, without an equivalent satis∣faction.</Q>
But, the bare mention of such an idea
of justice, must, I should think, convince every
rational being, that it is false. It must be plainly
seen, that justice, in this light, or, rather in this
darkness, is only another term for rigour, for in∣flexible
rigour, and implacable severity; a cha∣racter
that we detest even in man, and which we
cannot therefore apply to the infinitely adorable
God, without being guilty of the most outrageous
impiety. It must, I say, plainly be seen, that if
justice signified rigour, God could not be just and
good, at the same time: for the one is as contrary
to the other, as light is to darkness. This will be
evident, from the universally allowed acceptation
of the terms.</P>
<P>In the first place then, goodness implies, it is
well known, that benefits are bestowed without the
prospect of any return. But rigour implies, as the
proverb goes, that <HI>nothing is done for nothing.</HI>
Again, the goodness of God implies, that he is not
strict to mark our iniquities. But rigour, if this
could be supposed to be one of his attributes, must
make him punish, with exact weight and measure,
every failing, not excepting the smallest, of which
any being is guilty. Hence, then, it is obvious,
that those who understand, by the justice of God,
his unchangeable disposition not to pardon the
least violation of his laws, without an equivalent
satisfaction, inasmuch as they thus declare, that
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
there is no forgiveness with him, expressly de∣clare,
at the same time, that he is neither mer∣ciful,
nor good. Nor do they at all alter the case,
by supposing that he will accept that debt from
another, which the delinquent himself is not able
to pay; for, this is still supposing, that there is no
forgiveness with him, or that there is no goodness
with him, for a good being must have forgiveness
in himself. Accordingly, we never ascribe for∣giveness,
or goodness, to the man, who insists
upon the whole of his debt, and who will never
be satisfied until the whole is paid, though he
should consent. at the same time, to accept this
debt from another besides the person who owes it;
for, by accepting it even from another, he has all
he could demand, and all he could form any pre∣tensions
to have a right to receive. Nor do we
ever ascribe any merit or praise to such a man;
these are due only to him who paid the debt, not
at all to him who received it to the full, though
from the hand of a third person: Surely, then,
we cannot compare the ever blessed God to such
a man; we cannot divest him of goodness; we
cannot represent him in a light that would fix a
reproach upon any of his imperfect creatures.
We cannot suppose, that there is any goodness or
mercy in the universe, if not with him, the foun∣tain
of the whole. We cannot suppose, that
any of his creatures are more benevolently dis∣posed
than the great Creator. We must suppose
that, if there be any love, any tenderness, or com∣passion,
in any being whatever, these must reside,
in their infinite fullness, in the Almighty and ever∣lasting
God. Rigour, therefore, cannot be one
of his attributes. His justice must be such, as ren∣ders
him the object of our most delightful con∣templations,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
and as is consistent, therefore, with
all his other most glorious perfections. This, I
shall now endeavour to shew, is not only the doc∣trine
of reason, but is likewise deducible from the
whole volume of scripture.</P>
<P>To this purpose, then, a fine field for satisfying
all our enquiries is opened to us in the eighteenth
chapter of the book of Genesis, which, from the
twentieth to the end of the thirty-second verse, ex∣pressly
treats of the justice of God. <HI>The LORD
said,</HI> to Abraham, <HI>because the cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is great, and their sin is very grievous;
I will go down now, and see whether they have done
altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me, and if not, I will know</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mere cavillers only can object to the familiarity of the language used in this passage.</NOTE>.—<HI>And Abraham
drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righ∣teous
with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city: wilt Thou also destroy and
not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are</HI>
therein? <HI>That be far from Thee, to do after this
manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and
that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far
from thee: SHALL NOT THE JUDGE OF ALL
THE EARTH DO RIGHT? And the Lord said,
If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And
Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, who am but
dust and ashes. Peradventure, there shall lack five of
the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for</HI> lack
of <HI>five? And he said, If I find there forty and five,
I will not destroy</HI> it. <HI>And he spake unto him yet
again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty
found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
sake. And he said unto him, O let not the LORD
be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall
thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it
if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I
have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Per∣adventure
there shall be twenty found there. And he
said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. And he
said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be
found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for
ten's sake.</HI></P>
<P>Now, there is not a single circumstance in this
history, which can lead us to conclude, that the
Justice of God is repugnant to his merey, but only
that it essentially belongs to him, as a just being,
to make a distinction between the righteous and
the wicked, and not to destroy the innocent with
the guilty. Abraham intreated God not to punish,
but to spare, to spare even the guilty, if it should
seem good to his infinite wisdom, or, if they were
found to be past hopes, to be incorrigibly hardened
and impenitent, to vindicate his justice, by send∣ing
redemption to the righteous. Nor did the
LORD threaten to destroy Sodom and Gomor∣rah,
because the inhabitants were imperfect crea∣tures,
or because they had fallen into involuntary
errors, or because that, though they might be then
penitent, they had formerly been wicked; but be∣cause
that they were totally depraved, because
they had irreclaimably given themselves up to the
foulest vices that could be perpetrated or invented,
and that no means of salvation that were offered
them, could work a reformation in them, <Q>And
the Lord said, because the cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is <HI>great,</HI> and because their sin is <HI>very
grievous,</HI> I will see whether they have done ac∣cording
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
to the cry of it that is come unto me.</Q>
From which it may be concluded, that, if their
sins had not been of the deepest dye, and such as
admitted of no sort of extenuation; and had they
not resolved to continue in them too, against all
possible means of conviction, God would still have
been gracious to them, and granted them a space
for repentance. We learn accordingly, that, after
the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah had been
greatly corrupted, sentence was not suddenly exe∣cuted
against them, but that Lot, on the contrary,
was sent to sojourn among them, to reprove them
for their impieties, and to admonish and persuade
them, if possible, to repent and live: and it was
not until they had rejected these means of grace,
abused the divine forbearance and long-suffering,
waxed still worse and worse, and wholly given them∣selves
up to work all iniquity with greediness, that
the impending judgments of God were let loose
upon them. In his whole conduct towards this
people, his justice did not at all interfere with his
mercy, his justice did not hinder the calls of grace
and reconciliation for a longtime to take place; his
mercy was extended towards them until the farther
extension of it could be of no use to them; indeed
until mercy and goodness to other nations rendered
their destruction necessary. Abraham, therefore,
did not address God, saying, that his justice re∣quired
immediate vengeance upon all his adversa∣ries,
or that his justice was irreconcileable with his
pardoning, or forbearing to punish, any criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, must have been his language, had he entertained the common shocking ideas of the divine justice, or any ideas of this divine attribute at all similar to these.</NOTE>,
but that his justice could not suffer any evil to be∣fal
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
the righteous. <Q>Abraham drew near and said,
Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the
wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous
within the city: wilt thou also destroy, and not
spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
therein? That be far from thee, to do after this
manner: and, that the righteous should be as
the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the
judge of all the earth do right?</Q> Here, the line
of justice is exactly drawn. And it has not, we see,
the least respect to any kind of implacability in the
Divine Mind, nor does it suppose that God cannot
<HI>freely</HI> pardon the truly penitent, in perfect consis∣tency
with the full exercise of his justice, but is
wholly confined to this rule, that God will make a
proper distinction between the righteous and the
wicked, and that he will punish none more than
their iniquities deserve. In other words, the Jus∣tice
of God signifies that he is a being of absolute
and unchangeable rectitude, and that there is not
the most distant shadow of any kind of injustice
with him; or, as Moses describes him, cloathed
with this attribute, that, <HI>he is the rock, his work is
perfect; for all his ways are judgment; a God of
truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he.</HI>
But here it should be particularly observed, (when
we say that the Justice of God signifies that there
is no <HI>injustice</HI> with him) that forgiveness of sin is
not to be included in our idea of injustice: for, if
it was, what should become of the whole universe
of dependant beings? God chargeth his very an∣gels
with folly; and as to the rational beings in this
world, <HI>what man is he, that liveth and sinneth not?</HI>
If God was, therefore, strict to mark our iniqui∣ties,
or if his justice and pardoning mercy were
at variance, misery must inevitably be the portion
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
of the whole human race. But, it is our comfort,
that God is not strict to mark our iniquities, that
he delighteth not in the death of a sinner, that he
is gracious, forbearing, and long-suffering towards
us, and not willing that any should perish. It is
our comfort that his justice is in no respect repug∣nant
to his goodness, that his justice freely admit∣teth
of the infinite riches of his grace, that his jus∣tice
does not at all imply, that he is <HI>an inflexibly ri∣gorous
judge,</HI> but only, that, <Q>he will make a pro∣per
distinction between the righteous and the
wicked, that he will not punish the wicked more
than their iniquities deserve, that he will not dis∣appoint
the hopes, nor frustrate the expectations
that he has raised in his creatures, and that he
is no respecter of persons.</Q></P>
<P>In the first place, <Q>The Justice of God implies,
that he will make a proper distinction between
the righteous and the wicked.</Q> That the righ∣teous
should be as the wicked, that be far from
God? Shall not the judge of all the earth do
right? It would be obviously wrong to slay the
righteous with the wicked, or to put the wicked on
a level with the righteous: and it would be more
wrong still, it would be truly diabolical, to prefer
any of the wicked to any of the righteous, and,
merely to display his power, to introduce any of
the wicked to a place of happiness, and to consign
any of the righteous to a place of misery. God,
therefore, as a just being, cannot admit the wicked
to the joys of the righteous; a distinction must
take place, and a distinction among the righteous
themselves, according as they severally have been
more or less obedient to his voice. But, then, it
can be no injustice to the righteous, to grant the
wicked a space for repentance; nay, to bear long
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
with them, to see if they will turn from their evil
ways, and to give them peace and reconciliation,
when influenced by that wisdom which descended
from above, and following the innate dictates of
their own minds, they truly <HI>seek the Lord and find
him.</HI> If this was injustice, the righteous themselves
could have no hope; for they have not been al∣ways
found perfect before God, they could, there∣fore,
only look, in this case, for a less degree of
punishment than would be inflicted on the wicked.
But all the ends of justice must, it is obvious, be
completely answered, by rewarding the righteous,
according to their sincere though imperfect obe∣dience,
and by punishing the wicked, only when
their punishment becomes necessary, when they
become reprobate to every good work; when,
therefore, farther forbearance towards them, not
being sufficient to reform them, could be of no use
to themselves, and might be cruelty to the rest of
the creation.</P>
<P>Secondly, <Q>The Justice of God implies, that,
he will not punish the wicked more than their
iniquities deserve.</Q> This is obvious, at first view:
for, strict justice can never exceed in its sentence
the proportion of guilt in any offender. God,
therefore, as a just being, cannot punish us for
what we could not do, nor for what we could
not avoid doing, nor for any iniquities of
others, to which we were no way accessary, nor
consenting. On the contrary, as the most just
of all beings, he may be long-suffering towards us,
and delay his judgments until the ruin of the inno∣cent
would be the consequence of any farther de∣lay;
and, as the most holy of all beings, he may
likewise graciously accept the returning penitent.
How infinitely injurious is it to his justice, there∣fore,
even to insinuate, that he will inflict endless
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
torments upon a very great majority of his crea∣tures,
for a crime that was committed before they
existed, six thousand years before <HI>many</HI> of them
existed, and that <HI>there are millions of infants in hell
not a span long?</HI> I cannot so much as mention this
doctrine of devils without the utmost horror. Nor
should I mention it at all, it reflects such dishonour
and reproach upon the children of men, to suppose
that any individual of them is capable of believing
it, was it not known that there are still some who
zealously maintain and propagate it. Let such en∣joy
their sentiments, if they can. But, while rea∣son
and revelation have any influence upon the
human mind, their God will be considered as a
fictitious being, the work of a bewildered imagina∣tion,
and as such will be discarded out of the
world.</P>
<P>But, thirdly, <Q>The Justice of God requires, that
he will not disappoint the hopes, nor frustrate the
expectations which he has raised in his creatures.</Q>
Justice, even among mankind, requires, that we
should perform all our obligations to the full; that,
if we have made any promises, we should keep
them, that, if we have cherished any particular
confidence in us, if we have even encouraged of∣fenders
to hope for our favour, we should not
cruelly deceive them. Therefore the Justice of
God requires, that he will fulfil all those expecta∣tions
which we are emboldened to form of his
goodness. Though Justice could not oblige him
to promise immortality to those who never deserved
it; yet justice ensures immortality to the righteous
after it is promised; and justice ensures pardon to
the truly penitent, after they are once encouraged
to hope for it at the throne of grace. Justice, there∣fore,
must satify those desires of living beyond the
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
grave, which for ever animate us, must crown us
with unfading glory and honour, if we live up to
the terms of the blessed gospel, must give us at all
times free access to the throne of mercy, and
crown all our <HI>sincere</HI> though <HI>imperfect</HI> endeavours,
to humble ourselves before God, and to serve him
in spirit and in truth, with all those rewards that
are represented to us in the sacred treasury of his
word. The apostle, therefore, says, <Q>God is not
<HI>unrighteous</HI> to forget your labour of love;</Q> signi∣fying,
that after God has encouraged us, by a pa∣tient
continuance in well doing, to seek for glory,
honour, and immortality, he cannot, consistently
with his justice, disappoint the hopes of his faithful
servants.</P>
<P>But, lastly, <Q>The Justice of God requires, that
he should be no respecter of persons.</Q> Justice,
in the distribution of gifts or rewards, can only
consider the worthiness or unworthiness of any par∣ticular
person, cannot respect any one man in pre∣ference
to any other man of exactly the same pre∣tensions
to favour. In the court of justice, the
rich and the poor, the bond and the free, the
prince and the peasant, must be upon the same
common level. In the court of justice, there can
be no taking of bribes, nor distinction of country,
fect, or party. And, here, the good that we would
have done but could not. must set us in the same
light with those, who had the opportunity and abi∣lity,
as well as the will to do the same good. God,
therefore as a just being▪ can have no favou∣rites
among his children, independently of their
devotedness to his service. He cannot respect
their persons, nor be biassed by pompous appear∣ances:
but as he has made of one blood all nations
of men to dwell upon the face of the whole earth,
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
whether you be Jew or Greek, ruler or subject,
master or servant, born in the first or in the last
ages of the world, it makes no difference in his
eye. The only difference that he can make must
arise from the different circumstances in which
mankind have been placed. But, this difference
he must make as no respecter of persons. He can∣not
require brick where there was no straw. He
can only require a benevolent heart, where there
is neither silver nor gold: and, he cannot judge
those by the law, who had not the law, nor those
by the gospel who had not the gospel. Where he
has given ten talents, though there he must be ex∣pected
to look for the improvement of ten; yet,
where he has given only five talents, he can only
look for the improvement of five; and, where he
has given only two talents, he can only look for
the improvement of two. In short, the equally,
sincere and upright in his service, all the advan∣tages
or disadvantages of their situation being con∣sidered,
must be equally acceptable with him, and
equally rewarded by him.</P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to give the reader
right apprehensions of the divine justice, and such
as represent the great God to us, not in a forbid∣ding,
but in an amiable and endearing light, I
shall now proceed to shew that the justice of God
is, and must be such as I have here described it.</P>
<P>This I shall, first, endeavour to shew, upon the
principles of reason, from his other perfections;
and, secondly, from the scriptural account of his
dealings with the children of men.</P>
<P>There can, then, it is obvious, in the first place,
be no temptation to injustice, but from depen∣dency
or want, or from motives of benefitting our∣selves
at the expence of others. God, therefore,
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
being supremely exalted above all principalities and
powers, the fountain of all being, the Lord of the
whole creation, and possessing in himself an infi∣nite
and independant fullness of all possible bliss,
and it being impossible that he can derive any be∣nefit
from the oppression, or total extinction of
any, or of all his creatures: God, therefore, I say,
cannot possibly do an unjust thing. As all men
in common are equally his own offspring, so far
he can make no distinction between them, but
every one man must be as much the object of his
care and bounty as every other man. And, as he
could have no possible motive to create any being,
but to make that being happy, he therefore cannot
possibly take pleasure in the misery of any creature,
nor suffer any creature to labour under oppression
without sufficient reason, unless it be its own fault,
or he should know perplexed and cloudy circum∣stances
to be necessarily conducive to improve it
in knowledge, virtue, and happiness. Farther, as
the infinite mind must delight in those perfections
in others which he exerciseth himself, must love
his own image in his creatures, must approve of the
grateful and upright heart, must consequently dis∣approve
of the profane and disobedient wretch;
he must, therefore, make a proper distinction be∣tween
the righteous and the wicked, must crown
the righteous with greater or with lesser dignity and
glory, according to their several attainments in ho∣liness
and perfection, and must debar the wicked
of the joys of the righteous. But, that the justice
of God, at the same time, is in no case repugnant
to his mercy, is demonstrable from our own exis∣tence,
from the numberless unceasing blessings
which we daily receive, and from the animating
hopes, we are taught to entertain, of more enlarged
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
communications of the divine favour in a future
scene. We know, that we have all sinned against
him, and that if he should strictly deal with us <HI>after
our transgressions,</HI> or determine not to pardon any
of our trespasses against him, we must long ago
have been consumed. We know, therefore, that
his justice and mercy are not at variance, that his
justice is consistent with his patience, forbear∣ance,
and long-suffering, that his justice can be
slow to punish, and ready to pardon, and that it
can spare the guilty themselves, until they have
repeatedly rebelled against the divine laws, thrown
off the divine government entirely, and rejected
all those means of conviction and salvation, that
could be reasonably extended towards them, or
be reasonably expected from infinite benevolence.
Once more, as the only end of deferring punish∣ment
can be the reformation of the offender, and
as we have a relish for, and are taught to look for∣ward
to a future and everlasting state of happiness,
upon our sincere though imperfect endeavours to
serve God; God, therefore, because so great, so
glorious, and independant a sovereign, could have
no possible motives to mock the creatures of his
power, but certainly intendeth us for such a state,
and certainly will introduce us to such a state, if
we make the best preparations in our power for it.
Those hopes of the righteous, <HI>these longings after
immortality,</HI> which his infinite goodness, without
any claim or merit on our part, originally infused
into the soul, his infinite justice must fully satisfy.
He cannot, as the universal Father, and the all-sufficient
God, disappoint any of those expectations
which he has raised in his rational creatures. His
justice, I say, must complete those views, and, if
we live up to the dictates of his wisdom, satisfy
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
those boundless desires with which his adorable
and infinite goodness has inspired us.</P>
<P>These are the sentiments of reason upon this
subject: and, in perfect harmony with these, are
the history of God's dealings with the children of
men from the beginning of the world, and the
plain declaration of his revealed will, which are
recorded for our instruction in the holy scriptures.
The first man, Adam, experienced no kind of re∣pugnancy
between the divine justice and the divine
mercy. It was said even to Cain, after he <HI>was
very wroth, and his countenance fell—If thou doest
well shalt thou not be accepted?</HI> Nay, the justice,
which afterwards punished him for his great wicked∣ness,
admitted of the extension of mercy, upon
his repentance; and his punishment seems to have
been purposely calculated to lead him to repen∣tance.
The doctrine, which I have been endea∣vouring
to establish is still farther confirmed, from
the history of David, Manasseh, and many other
remarkable delinquents. But, as it would be an
endless work, so it does not seem necessary to
examine the divine dispensations towards each
individual, whose virtues, or vices, or whose
virtues and vices together, are held up to
our observation in the scriptures. The his∣tory
of the antediluvian world, the whole his∣tory
of the Jews, from the beginning to end,
the history of Nineveh and Babylon, and Tyre
and Sidon, and the deplorable state of the
world, when the man Christ Jesus revealed all the
riches of God's grace to his most abandoned off∣spring,
are all to my purpose. To my purpose
likewise are the innate sentiments of the human
mind, as these are successively represented to us in
the scriptures. <Q>Doth God pervert judgment,
says Bildad, or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</Q>
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Meaning, that God could not do an unjust thing.
<Q>Is it good unto thee,</Q> says Job, <Q>that thou
should'st oppress? that thou should despise the
work of thine hands? and shine upon the council
of the wicked? He is excellent—in plenty of
justice,</Q> says Elihu; <Q>he will not afflict,</Q> but ac∣cording
to wisdom and equity; <Q>and he shall judge
the world in righteousness,</Q> says the Psalmist, not
meaning with rigour, but without injustice; <Q>he
shall minister judgment to the people in upright∣ness,
The LORD also will be a refuge for the
oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they
that know thy name, will put their trust in thee;
for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that
seek thee.</Q> Again, the Psalmist says, <Q>Justice
and judgment are the habitation of thy throne;
mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</Q> In
like manner, God is represented, by the prophet
Jeremiah, as proclaiming his own character, <Q>I
am the LORD, who exercise loving kindness,
judgment, and righteousness in the earth; for in
these things I delight, saith the LORD.</Q> Here,
<HI>loving-kindness</HI> can evidently bear no opposition to
<HI>righteousness</HI> or <HI>justice,</HI> though God will make a
distinction between the righteous and the wicked,
and inflict tremendous punishments upon the in∣corrigibly
wicked, according to the preceding and
following verses. This is also the sentiment of
Eliphaz, when he says. <Q>Shall mortal man be
more just than his Maker?</Q> Farther, the ideas
which I endeavoured to convey of the <HI>impartial</HI>
justice of God, are likewise uniformly handed
down to us by the sacred penmen. <Q>He accepteth
not the persons of princes, nor re gardeth the rich
more than the poor,</Q> <HI>Job</HI> xxxiv. 19. <Q>Are ye
not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
children of Israel, saith the LORD.</Q> <Q>Of a
truth I perceive, says Peter, that God is no re∣specter
of persons.</Q> Paul repeatedly says the same
thing, and asks the Romans, <Q>Is he the God of
the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the
Gentiles? Yea, of the Gentiles also.</Q> Again,
that the Justice of God implies, that he will fulfil
those expectations which he has raised in his crea∣tures,
is likewise expressly asserted in the scrip∣tures.
<Q>I will not leave thee,</Q> said he to Jacob,
<Q>until I have done that which I have spoken to
thee of.</Q> <Q>Thy councils of old are faithfulness
and truth, <BIBL><HI>Isa.</HI> xxv. 1.</BIBL></Q> <Q>All the promises of
God in him, are yea. and in him amen, unto
the glory of God, <BIBL>2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 20.</BIBL></Q> <Q>The LORD
thy God, he is God, the faithful God, <BIBL><HI>Deute∣ron.</HI>
vii. 9.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>More testimonies from the sacred writings will
come in our way as we proceed. At present we
see that the scriptural accounts of the Justice of
God, do not, any more than the positive deduc∣tions
of Reason, represent him in a forbidding,
but, on the contrary, in an endearing light, en∣courage
our trust and confidence in him, and lead
us, if we love him, and keep his commandments,
to cast all our cares and burthens upon him. If
we search the scriptures from beginning to end, we
shall not meet with a single passage, which informs
us, that he cannot pardon the least transgression
without a proportionable recompence, but, on the
contrary, that <HI>he knoweth our frame, and remem∣bereth
that we are dust,</HI> that he will not, therefore,
make a rigorous enquiry into our past transgressions,
but that, <HI>if we turn unto him, he will turn
unto us,</HI> and that, if the wicked man turneth away
from his wickedness which he has committed, He
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
will <HI>abundantly pardon, and save his soul alive.</HI> In
the scriptures, the Justice of God is no where re∣presented
as the cause of confusion and terror to
the righteous, but as their strong hold and security,
that they shall never be moved. Thus we have al¦ready
seen, that Abraham understood it, when he
pleaded for the people of Sodom, and expressed
his confidence in God, as the Righteous judge of all
the earth. He did not mean, in any part of his ad∣dress,
that those righteous persons for whom he
pleaded, had never sinned in thought, word, or
deed. He only supposed that their hearts were
right towards God for the present, and that, of
whatever imperfections they had been guilty in
time past, they were now sincerely devoted to his
service. Upon this foundation, he presumes that
it would be <HI>unjust</HI> in God to involve them in the
same destruction with the inflexibly impenitent. To
the same purpose Jehosaphat instructed the judges
of Israel.—<Q>There is no iniquity with the LORD
our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of
gifts:</Q> by which he did not mean that the judges
should punish, with the utmost rigour, every mis∣demeanor
in those delinquents that should come
before them, but only that they should not be bias∣sed,
by any rewards, to wink at the oppression of
the innocent, or to patronize the evil-doer. Be∣sides,
we are repeatedly told, that God <HI>delighteth
not in the death of a sinner, but rather that he should
turn from his wickedness and live:</HI> which could not
be the case, if the Justice of God was at all repug∣nant
to his mercy. Nay, when God himself ap∣peals
to his justice, he not only shews that it was
tempered with mercy, but that it was wholly regu∣lated
by the most tender, boundless mercy.
<Q>Judge, I pray you,</Q> says he, <Q>between me and my
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
vineyard. What could have been done more to
my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</Q> Where
he signifies, that the glory of his justice, consists in
kindness and compassions, and in applying every
reasonable means that can be offered for the reco∣very
and salvation of his back-sliding people.
Words cannot more strongly express this sentiment
than we find it in <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xviii. 25. <Q>Hear now,
O house of Israel, is not my way equal?</Q> The
<HI>way,</HI> or <HI>dispensation</HI> of God referred to here, is
that the children should not bear the iniquities of
the fathers, that the soul which sinned alone should
die, and that God has not any pleasure at all that
the wicked should die, but rather that they should
turn from their evil ways and live. Are not my
ways equal? Am not I just? when, instead of pu∣nishing
one for the iniquities of another, or rigo∣rously
marking every iniquity committed against my
authority, I am even willing to pardon all the
transgressions, however enormous and inexcusable,
of the truly penitent. But, as full a proof as can
be given, that no implacability is to be included in
our ideas of the divine justice, is to be drawn from
the directions that are given us for our own con∣duct.
We learn, then, that to please God, we
must not only do justly, but likewise love mercy,
and exercise forgiveness. Now, here it is evident,
that if, <HI>to do justly,</HI> was to punish with rigour every
offence committed against us, then, if we would
please God by doing justly, we could cxercise no
mercy or forgiveness. Doing justly, therefore, can
only signify, that we do no violence ourselves, that
we should deprive no fellow-creatures of their rights
and privileges, but do unto all others as we would
that they should do unto us. And, in this light we
are to view the divine justice; it is slow to wrath,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and keepeth the door of mercy for ever open to
the penitent. <Q>Because God is LORD of all,</Q>
as the author of the Book of Wisdom says, <Q>it
maketh him to be gracious to all.</Q> And this
<HI>grace</HI> is without respect of persons. He regardeth
not the high more than the low, but, as the Apo∣stle
Peter says, <Q>In every nation, he that feareth
him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with
him,</Q> It is not, till after repeated trials, and men
have been guilty of the most daring impieties,
and become totally abandoned, that his judgments
take place. He is not speedy in executing sen∣tence
upon them, but chasteneth them by little
and little, that they might fly from the wrath
to come. And, when he comes forth to judg∣ment,
we are told, and may be assured, that every
mouth shall be stopped, and that none shall be
able to accuse him of unrighteousness. <Q>He will
judge the world in righteousness, and the people
with equity.</Q> When this grand and important
day arrives, <HI>salvation and glory, and honour and
power,</HI> shall be ascribed <HI>unto the Lord our God, for
his true and righteous judgments;</HI> and, it will then
be found, beyond all question, I dare say, that
God inflicteth punishment even upon the incor∣rigibly
wicked, not because his justice cannot par∣don,
but because mercy to the universe renders
their punishment necessary, and because too, per∣haps,
there can be no way, consistent with infinite
wisdom, of making the wicked happy. Besides,
God, in punishing the wicked, will eminently dis∣play
his justice, in proportioning the punishment
of every particular criminal, to his lesser or greater
degree of impenitency and hardness of heart.
Those, that have sinned without law, shall also
perish without law; and while some are beaten
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
with many stripes, others, comparatively speaking,
shall be beaten with few stripes. <Q>With the judg∣ment
they judge, they shall be judged; and with
the measure they mete, it shall be measured to
them again.</Q> The same justice also will display
itself in rewarding the righteous. To some it will
be said. <HI>Come up hither.</HI> He, that soweth sparingly,
shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth boun∣tifully,
shall reap also bountifully. While all shall
be exempted from every labour, pain, and sorrow,
the joy of some shall transcendantly exceed that of
others. <Q>They that be wise shall shine as the bright∣ness
of the firmament; and they that have turned
many to righteousness, <HI>and have been righteous
themselves,</HI> as the stars for ever.</Q> The Justice of
God, will pardon all their infirmities, and all
their transgressions, of which they have re∣pented,
that is, from which they have turned
away; and, according to the works of righ∣teousness,
which they have done, <HI>he will divide to
each his portion.</HI> His goodness has promised this.
His justice therefore will bring it to pass. Yes,
Though we have sinned, yet if we have forsaken
our sins, acquired a new heart, and a new spirit,
and approved ourselves holy in all manner of con∣versation
and godliness; if, in preference to all the
honours, and riches, and pleasures of the world,
we have, by a patient continuance in well-doing,
sought for glory and honour, and immortality, then,
notwithstanding those doings that have not been
good, and which we have seriously amended, God
will grant us all we want, all the riches of eternal
life. <HI>He is not unrighteous,</HI> as we have already af∣firmed
with the apostle, <HI>to forget our labour of love.</HI>
He is faithful in all his promises, and cannot dis∣appoint
those hopes, nor frustrate those noble ex∣pectations
which he has raised. Nay, he will not
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
only not frustrate those expectations, not only give
us the victory over death and the grave, and intro∣duce
us to happiness, but, <HI>eye has not seen, nor ear
heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man
to conceive the things which God has prepared for
them that love him. Thy righteousness,</HI> O Lord,
<HI>is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the
truth.</HI> The heavens <HI>shall declare his righteousness;
for God is judge himself. Lord God of Israel, there
is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth
beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy ser∣vants,
that walk before thee with all their hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Such are the notions which reason and scripture,
clearly, I think, lead us to form of the divine jus∣tice.
A great variety of objections, however, it
will possibly be said, may still be urged against it.
With all my heart, say I, if the objections will go
upon the same ground upon which I have endea∣voured
to tread, that is, if reason and scripture be
the testimonies to which they appeal. But the most
common objection to this doctrine, or the most
common argument by which the contrary doctrine
is supported, is nothing more than an impertinent
quotation from the apostle Paul. A man rises up,
and harangues to me, upon a multitude of <HI>unin∣telligibles,</HI>
ascribes certain random, arbitrary de∣crees
to the infinitely wise governor of the universe,
then describes his justice to be such as I have shewn
must be an absolute bar to mercy, and after work∣ing
himself into a tolerable heat, by much speak∣ing,
<HI>Who art thou,</HI> says he, <HI>that repliest against God?</HI>
Now, to such a reasoner I have only to say, <HI>Infal∣lible
Sir! though thou art a God to thyself, thou art
not my God.</HI> But farther, it cannot be seriously
objected to the doctrine I have been vindicating,
<Q>that the wicked frequently bear rule in this life,
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
and that their eyes stand out with fatness; while
the righteous are afflicted, and mourn, and some∣times
go down to the grave, labouring under the
rod of oppression and sorrow.</Q> This, I say, can∣not
be seriously objected; because this is the very
nature of a state of trial. Besides, amply to satisfy
us upon this head, it is enough to say, that all these
things will be set right on a future day, and that,
for every suffering, into which we have fallen for
righteousness sake, or for the trial of our faith,
we shall be infinitely recompenced at the resurrec∣tion
of the just. Besides, we are often in our pros∣perity,
too apt to forget God; but adversity natu∣rally
leads us to the rock that is higher than we.
The Psalmist, therefore, said, that it was good for
him to have been afflicted, because that before he
was afflicted, he went astray. Solomon says to
the same purpose, <Q>My son, despise not the chas∣tening
of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor∣rection;
for whom the Lord loveth he chasten∣eth,
even as a father the son in whom he de∣lighteth.</Q>
And, our own experience testifies,
that scenes of sorrow naturally humble the mind,
arrest our wandering desires, and dissipated
thoughts, admonish us of our follies and trans∣gressions,
and point out to us our true duty and
happiness, and our only refuge from every cala∣mity.
It would be unnecessary, I hope, to make
a formal reply to many other equally frivolous ob∣jections,
which the reader can answer as soon as
they occur. I shall now, therefore, only conclude
with some obvious reflections, which naturally
arise from what has been said.</P>
<P>I would observe, first of all, that the Justice of
God, as I have here endeavoured to represent it,
is, like all his other perfections, glorious. It is not
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
strict to mark our iniquities. It admitteth of grace
and reconciliation. It is founded on mercy and
goodness. It is a security to the righteous, that
they shall never be moved. And it is a pledge to
the truly penitent of their future crown. It is,
therefore, endearing, and adorable, our refuge in
difficulties, our hope in trouble, our haven of rest
from all the storms of life, and our tower of de∣fence
against every enemy, <HI>while we incline our
hearts unto the law, and to the testimonies</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The man, whose heart does not condemn him (says Abernethy) has a confidence toward God, because he is a perfectly just governor, by whom no service sincerely per∣formed to him, nor instance of respect to his command∣ments, will ever be forgotten—a self-approving mind is naturally secure, supported by this persuasion, that right shall finally prevail in the universe, and therefore looks forward, without consternations, to the last result of things, when all irregularities shall be rectified, when the proud shall be no more prosperous, nor innocence oppressed, but all men shall receive according to their deeds done in the body, and not according to their outward actions only, but the prevalent affections, and purposes of their hearts.</Q> See the following note but one at the beginning.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, secondly, we should learn, from this de∣scription
of the divine justice, what ought to be
the rules of justice among men. It should have
no likeness, we see, to that narrow, unfeeling, vin∣dictive
spirit, which actuates the <HI>priestly</HI> magistrate,
when the trembling wretch, who wanted a morsel
of bread, is brought before him. It should exert
its strength against tyranny and oppression, against
villainy in power. And, if it should not be allowed,
to pull down the despotic monarch from his throne,
and should at the same time, most inconsistently,
and unmercifully, wave its heavy scourge over the
necessitous delinquent, it should not, however,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
transgress the boundaries of plain equity. But, it
is manifestly unjust, it is most cruel, and iniqui∣tous,
to put the life of one man upon a level with
the property of another, to murder the fellow∣creature
who, though wantonly, and must unjus∣tifiably,
and wickedly, hath made inroads upon
the property of his neighbour This is punishing
beyond the utmost stretch of <HI>rigour,</HI> and much
more beyond the line of <HI>justice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye shedders of blood, what motives can ye have, for still preaching up the doctrine of capital punishments, and putting your doctrine in practice? Ye cannot plead the pre∣vention of crimes: for experience must convince you, that all your sanguinary laws are but a feeble fence against the worst crimes. And the reason of this is evident. Labour, and not death, is the great evil, which the malefactor dreads. Make, then, the malefactor work, and you will have no malefactors. Nor will ye then, while ye would be ac∣counted the servants of Christ, most shamefully oppose, both the example and the laws of Christ. He came not to <HI>de∣stroy</HI> men's lives, but to <HI>save</HI> them; not to deprive sinners of the power of repenting, but to call them to repentance. Far∣ther, as lewdness, debauchery, and gambling, <HI>these works of dishonesty,</HI> lead to the commission of all those other offences that dis;turb the peace of society; let not the example of those in superior stations countenance and encourage those destroying vices. Let those of distinguished rank, who are too often as eminently infamous, once shew themselves <HI>men,</HI> and they will find none but <HI>men</HI> among their inferiors.</NOTE> And, the di∣vine
justice is so far from bearing any kind of
similitude to this, that it is, we have seen, entirely
contrary to it. The divine justice is slow to pu∣nish
even sinners according to their deserts, is for∣bearing
and long-suffering towards them, at first
only punisheth them with the accusations of con∣science,
to try to reform them, time after time,
useth every possible means to bring them back to
their duty and obedience; and, if they will re∣form,
cease to do evil, and learn to do well, is
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
ready to blot out all their iniquities, to receive
them into favour, and to admit them to the riches
of eternal life. We should, therefore, to copy af∣ter
the divine justice, proportion our mode of pu∣nishment
to the offence that is committed; we
should aim at the reformation of the sinner, and
endeavour to make his situation such, as will both
answer this end, and at the same time repay society
for the wrongs he has done. Or, while we do
<HI>justly</HI> towards all, and injure no man in body or
estate, we should likewise shew <HI>mercy</HI> to the guilty,
and forgive them when they repent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the author had written these sheets, he turned to a discourse of the great Abernethy upon the same subject; from whom he has transcribed the following passage, being, in his apprehension, perfectly in point with the sentiments delivered in the above paragraph. <Q>God, in his justice,</Q> said this most learned and excellent man, <Q>as well as his other moral perfections, is the best example for us to imi∣tate, as far as the frailty of our nature will allow. It is our glory, as reasonable creatures, to be capable of imi∣tating him, and as our consciences bear as full testimony to the rectitude of this, as to any other part of his law written in our hearts, we must be self-condemned, and therefore unhappy, in acting contrary to it.— The exercise of human authority, should, as exactly as possible, follow the pattern of that perfect righteousness that governs the world. Princes</Q> and magistrates <Q>are called Gods upon earth—Shall they govern by arbitrary will, or by ca∣price and passion, instead of justice.</Q> Shall they?— But, how shall we prevail with them, or those around them, to take the trouble of thinking what is right, or of amend∣ing what is wrong?.</NOTE></P>
<P>But, thirdly, from the view that we have here
taken of the divine justice, we may see that there
was none occasion for that infinite satisfaction for
sin, which, among many other strange inventions,
the busy children of men have found out, and still
confidently proclaim to the world. The divine
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
justice is surrounded with mercy. The divine
justice, therefore, is fully satisfied with the refor∣mation
of the offender. The divine justice sitteth
upon a throne of grace, to which every contrite
sinner has free access, has <HI>always</HI> free access. And
if mercy was not to be obtained thence, where else
could it possibly be found? Could any other being,
could all the other beings, in the universe, over∣power
the infinite mind? Could any other
being be more benevolent than he? Or, indeed,
dare any other being presume to direct him, to al∣ter
the purpose he had formed? But there was not
any occasion for any other being to attempt this.
God was <HI>of himself</HI> eternally disposed to have mercy
upon us, and was <HI>never</HI> willing that any should pe∣rish,
but that all should come to repentance and
eternal life. Nay, so far was he from being ir∣reconcileable
to his creatures, or from demanding
an infinite satisfaction for every sin, that he, <HI>of his
own will, gave us his only begotten son,</HI> to assure us,
that, upon our sincere repentance, all our sins
should be blotted out, and that, upon our renewed
obedience, we should be made partakers of eternal
life. <Q><HI>God</HI> so loved the world, that <HI>he</HI> gave us his
only begotten son, that whoever believeth in him,
might not perish, but have everlasting life.</Q> Or,
this is his covenant with us, <HI>Repent, and live ye,</HI>
and <HI>turn unto me, and I will turn unto you.</HI> The
blessed Christ has sealed, or ratified to us,
this covenant with his own blood, that is, by his
death and resurrection. The everlasting Jehovah,
has raised Christ from the dead, to assure us, that
he has sent him, and that he will, consequently,
fulfil, to the truly penitent, all those promises of
pardon, peace, and love, and everlasting salvation
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
in the heavens, which are given to us in his holy
word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Why, if such a doctrine has any foundation in truth, have we no account in the scriptures of this infinite satisfac∣tion for sin? Why, if this be necessary to salvation, is it not so much as mentioned in those books that are able to make us wise unto salvation? Why did not Nathan, when he was sent to David to display to him the pardoning mercy of God, refer him to such a satisfaction as the only means of escaping the wrath to come? Why did not David himself, when he humbled himself before God for his great transgres∣sion, rely upon any such satisfaction, nor speak of any such satisfaction, but pray for <HI>a clean heart and a right spirit?</HI> Why, after Christ died, did all the apostles, instead of referring sinners to such a satisfaction, teach them, <HI>that denying ungod∣liness, and worldly lust, they should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world?</HI> Why did Paul in particular, who gloried so much in preaching Christ, expresly declare that <HI>if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are found sinners, we deceive ourselves?</HI> Without shewing at large, that this notion of a satisfaction destroys all distinction of charac∣ter, and expunges every idea of the malignity of evil, why did not our Lord himself, who was the true way to eternal life, ever recommend any other means of attaining the mercy of God, than a sincere repentance, and a thorough reformation? He certainly foreknew that he was to suffer death, and re∣peatedly intimated this to his disciples; but, in none of his conversations upon this subject, did he in the least insinuate that his death would be necessary to satisfy the justice of God, or that it was to be considered as an indispensable pre∣requisite to appease his wrath. Accordingly, he did not pray to God, that sinners might learn to rely upon the merits of his blood, but that the apostles might be kept from falling, and he prayed for all who should believe on him through their word. He likewise, in the last scene of all, prayed for very murderers—<HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI> But, to what purpose any of these prayers, if the justice of God was fully satisfied by the death of his son? Our Lord would not then, surely, have prayed for criminals, but would, as he had the spirit above measure, and as he could not therefore be deceived, have demanded their for∣giveness as his purchased right.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31"/>
But, finally, the doctrine we have been consi∣dering
can afford no kind of encouragement to
the sinner. On the contrary, the goodness, for∣bearance,
and long-suffering of God, should, above
all things, lead him to repentance. Besides, though
God is gracious, slow to anger, and ready to for∣give,
yet he will at last take vengeance upon his ad∣versaries,
upon those who despised his grace, and
rejected all the offers of his mercy. This he hath
repeatedly, and solemnly declared, <HI>There is no
peace,</HI> saith my God, <HI>to the wicked:</HI> and, <HI>all the
workers of iniquity shall be destroyed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>If any man serve me,</Q> says our Lord, <Q>let him follow me, and where I am, there also shall my servant be: If any man serve me, him will my Father honour—and, except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</Q> Paul says, accordingly, <Q>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die,</Q> and, <Q>whoremongers and adulterers God will condemn.</Q> And John, and all the prophets and apostles teach, that <Q>he only who doeth righ∣teousness is righteous,</Q> or shall find acceptance at the throne of grace.</NOTE> Since these,
then, are his declarations, since judgment will be
his work, we may assure ourselves that infinite
mercy will render judgment necessary, and that
infinite goodness will execute all the threatenings
denounced against the finally impenitent. And,
oh, what an aggravation of the wretchedness of
the sinners doom will it be, that infinite mercy
itself could not save him!</P>
<P>Let us think of this; and as we know not what a
day or a night may bring forth, let us now, in the
accepted time, seek the Lord while he may be
found, desire his favour better than life, and run
with pleasure in the way of all his commandments;
that we may hereafter receive those crowns which
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
he has promised and prepared for those that love
him, that we may drink for ever at the river of his
pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that
fear him, both small, and great.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
Let us be glad, and rejoice, and give honour to him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad:
let the sea roar and the fulness thereof; let the field
be joyful, and all that is therein; then shall all the
trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for he
cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: HE
SHALL JUDGE THE WORLD WITH RIGH∣TEOUSNESS,
AND THE PEOPLE WITH
HIS TRUTH.</HI></P>
