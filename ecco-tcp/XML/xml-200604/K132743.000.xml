<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is not my intention, in this preface, to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece. I am afraid there are too many: But those who are best able to discover, will be most ready to pardon them. They alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is: and this is a first attempt.</P>
<P>I beg leave only to mention the reason that determined me to make choice of this subject. What pleased me par∣ticularly, tho' perhaps it will not be least liable to ob∣jection with ordinary readers, was the great simplicity of the story. It is one, regular, and uniform, not charged with a multiplicity of incidents, and yet afford∣ing several revolutions of fortune; by which the passions may be excited, varied, and driven to their full tu∣mult of emotion</P>
<P>This unity of design was always sought after, and admired by the antients: and the most eminent among the moderns, who understood their writings, have cho∣sen to imitate them in this, from an intire conviction that the reason of it must hold good in all ages. And here al∣low me to translate a passage from the celebrated <HI>Mon∣sieur Racine,</HI> which contains all that I have to say on this head.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">We must not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of those who made it. No∣thing can touch us in tragedy, but what is probable. And what probability is there, that, in one Day, should happen a multitude of things, which could scarce happen in several Weeks? There are some wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think that this simplicity is a mark of barrenness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> invention. But they do not consider, that, on the
<PB REF="5"/>
contrary, invention consists in making something out of nothing: and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets, who did not find in their genius either richness or force enough to engage their spectators, for five acts together, by a simple action, supported by the violence of passions, the beauty of sentiments, and the nobleness of expression.</Q>—I would not be understood to mean that all these things are to be found in my performance: I only shew the reader what I aimed at, and how I would have pleased him, had it been in my power.</P>
<P>As to the character of <HI>Sophonisba</HI>; in drawing it, I have confined myself to the truth of history. It were an affront to the age, to suppose such a character out of nature; especially in a country which has produced so many great examples of public spirit and heroic virtues, even in the softer sex: and I had destroyed her character intirely, had I not marked it with that strong love to her country, disdain of servitude, and inborn aversion to the <HI>Romans,</HI> by which all historians have distinguished her. Nor ought her marrying <HI>Masinissa,</HI> while her former husband was still alive, to be reckoned a blemish in her character. For, by the laws both of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage,</HI> the captivity of the husband dissolved the marriage of course; as among us impotence, or adultery: not to mention the reasons of a moral and public nature, which I have put into her own mouth in the scene be∣twixt her and <HI>Syphax.</HI></P>
<P>This is all I have to say of the play itself. But I cannot conclude without owning my obligations to those concerned in the representation. They have indeed done me more than justice. Whatever was designed as amia∣ble and engaging in <HI>Masinissa</HI> shines out in Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s action. Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> in the character of <HI>Sophonisba,</HI> has excelled what, even in the fondness of an author, I could either wish or imagine. The grace, dignity, and happy variety of her action have been universally applaud∣ed, and are truly admirable.</P>

<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. WILLIAMS.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>WHEN learning, after the long <HI>Gothic</HI> night,</L>
<L>Fair, o'er the western world, renew'd his light,</L>
<L>With arts arising <HI>Sophonisba</HI> rose:</L>
<L>The tragic muse, returning, wept her woes.</L>
<L>With her th' <HI>Italian</HI> scene first learnt to glow;</L>
<L>And the first tears for her were taught to flow.</L>
<L>Her charms the <HI>Gallic</HI> muses next inspir'd:</L>
<L><HI>Corneille</HI> himself saw, wonder'd, and was fir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What foreign theatres with pride have shewn,</L>
<L><HI>Britain,</HI> by juster title, makes her own.</L>
<L>When freedom is the cause, 'tis hers to fight;</L>
<L>And hers, wken freedom is the theme, to write.</L>
<L>For this, a <HI>British Author</HI> bids again</L>
<L>The heroine rise, to grace the <HI>British</HI> scene.</L>
<L>Here, as in life, she breathes her genuine flame:</L>
<L>She asks what bosom has not felt the same?</L>
<L>Asks of the <HI>British Youth</HI>—Is silence there?</L>
<L>She dares to ask it of the <HI>British Fair.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To night, our home-spun author would be true,</L>
<L>At once, to nature, history, and you.</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd to give our neighbours due applause,</L>
<L>He owns their learning, but disdains their laws.</L>
<L>Not to his patient touch, or happy flame,</L>
<L>'Tis to his <HI>British</HI> heart he trusts for fame.</L>
<L>If <HI>France</HI> excel him in one free-born thought,</L>
<L>The man, as well as poet, is in fault.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Nature!</HI> informer of the poet's art,</L>
<L>Whose force alone can raise or melt the heart,</L>
<L>Thou art his guide; each passion, every line,</L>
<L>Whate'er he draws to please, must all be thine.</L>
<L>Be thou his judge: in every candid breast,</L>
<L>Thy silent whisper is the sacred test.</L>

<L>A crown, a kingdom, and a queen he loves</L>

<L>He loves me with the madness of desire;</L>
<L>His every passion is a slave to love;</L>
<L>Nor heeds he danger where I bid him go,</L>
<L>Nor leagues, nor interest. Hence these endless wars,</L>
<L>These ravag'd countries, these successless fights,</L>
<L>Sustain'd for <HI>Carthage</HI>; whose defence alone</L>
<L>Engag'd my loveless marriage-vows with his.</L>

<L>I have a lover too; a gallant, brave,</L>

<L>Who has not heard the story of his woes?</L>
<L>How hard he came to his paternal reign;</L>
<L>Whence soon by <HI>Syphax</HI>' unrelenting hate,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>
And jealous <HI>Carthage</HI> driven, he with a few</L>
<L>Fled to the mountains. Then, I think, it was</L>
<L>Hem'd in a circle of impending rocks,</L>
<L>That all his followers fell, save fifty horse;</L>
<L>Who, thence escap'd thro' secret paths abrupt,</L>
<L>Gain'd the <HI>Clupean</HI> plain. There overtook,</L>
<L>And urg'd by fierce surrounding foes, he burst</L>
<L>With four alone, sore wounded, thro' their ranks,</L>
<L>And all amidst a mighty torrent plung'd.</L>
<L>Seiz'd by the whirling gulph, two sunk; and two,</L>
<L>With him obliquely hurried down the stream,</L>
<L>Wrought to the farther shore. Th'astonish'd troops</L>
<L>Stood check'd, and shivering on the gloomy brink,</L>
<L>And deem'd him lost in the devouring flood.</L>
<L>Mean time the dauntless, undespairing youth</L>
<L>Lay in a cave conceal'd; curing his wounds</L>
<L>With mountain-herbs, and on his horses fed:</L>
<L>Nor here, even at the lowest ebb of life,</L>
<L>Stoop'd his aspiring mind. What need I say,</L>
<L>How once again restor'd, and once again</L>
<L>Expell'd, among the <HI>Garamantian</HI> hills</L>
<L>He since has wander'd, till the <HI>Roman</HI> arm</L>
<L>Reviv'd his cause? And who shall reign alone,</L>
<L><HI>Syphax</HI> or he, this day decides.</L>

<L>Enough.</L>
<L>Thou need'st not blazon thus his fame, <HI>Phoenissa.</HI></L>
<L>Were he as glorious as the pride of woman</L>
<L>Could wish, in all her wantonness of thought;</L>
<L>The joy of humankind; wise, valiant, good;</L>
<L>With every praise, with every laurel crown'd;</L>
<L>The warriour's wonder, and the virgin's sigh:</L>
<L>Yet this would cloud him o'er, this blemish all;</L>
<L>His mean submission to the <HI>Roman</HI> yoke;</L>
<L>That, false to <HI>Carthage, Afric,</HI> and himself,</L>
<L>With proferr'd hand and knee, he hither led</L>
<L>These ravagers of earth.—But while we talk,</L>
<L>The work of fate goes on; even now perhaps</L>

<L>Is there no dungeon in this city? dark,</L>

<L>I will not wound thee, not insult thee, <HI>Syphax,</HI></L>
<L>With a recital of thy tyrant crimes.</L>
<L>A captive here I see thee, fallen below</L>
<L>My most revengeful wish; and all the rage,</L>
<L>The noble fury that inspir'd this morn</L>
<L>Is sunk to soft compassion. In the field,</L>
<L>The flaming front of war, there is the scene</L>
<L>Of brave revenge; and I have sought thee there,</L>
<L>Keen as the hunted lyon seeks his foe.</L>
<L>But when a broken enemy, disarm'd,</L>
<L>And helpless lies; a falling sword, an eye</L>
<L>With pity flowing, and an arm as weak</L>
<L>As infant softness, then becomes the brave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now sleeps the sword; the passions of the field</L>
<L>Subside to peace; and my relenting soul</L>
<L>Melts at thy fate.</L>

<L>This, this, is all I dread,</L>

<L>This barbarous pity, this affected goodness.</L>
<L>Pitied by thee!—Is there a form of death,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="17"/>
Of torture, and of infamy like that?</L>
<L>It kills my very soul!—Ye partial gods!</L>
<L>I feel your worst; why should I fear you more?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hear me, vain youth! take notice—I abhor</L>
<L>Thy mercy, loath it.—Poison to my thoughts!</L>
<L>Wouldst thou be merciful? One way alone</L>
<L>Thou canst oblige me.—Use me like a slave;</L>
<L>As I would thee, (delicious thought!) wert thou</L>
<L>Here crouching in my power.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASINISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Outragious man!</L>
<L>If that is mercy, I'll be cruel still.</L>
<L>Nor canst thou drive me, by thy bitterest rage,</L>
<L>To an unmanly deed; not all thy wrongs,</L>
<L>Nor this worse triumph in them.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SYPHAX.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! ha! wrongs?</L>
<L>I cannot wrong thee. When we lanch the spear</L>
<L>Into the monster's heart, or crush the serpent;</L>
<L>Destroy what in antipathy we hold,</L>
<L>The common foe; can that be call'd a wrong?</L>
<L>Injurious that? Absurd! it cannot be.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASINISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm loth to hurt thee more.—The tyrant works</L>
<L>Too fierce already in thy rankled breast.</L>
<L>But since thou seem'st to rank me with thy self,</L>
<L>With great destroyers, with perfidious kings;</L>
<L>I must reply to thy licentious tongue,</L>
<L>Bid thee remember, whose accursed sword</L>
<L>Began this work of death; who broke the ties,</L>
<L>The holy ties, attested by the gods,</L>
<L>Which bind the nations in the bond of peace;</L>
<L>Who meanly took advantage of my youth,</L>
<L>Unskill'd in arms, unsettled on my throne,</L>
<L>And drove me to the desart, there to dwell</L>
<L>With kinder monsters; who my cities sack'd,</L>
<L>My country pillag'd, and my subjects murder'd;</L>
<L>Who still pursu'd me with inveterate hate,</L>
<L>When generous force prov'd vain, with ruffian arts,</L>
<L>The villain's dagger, base assassination.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="18"/>
And for no reason all. Brute violence</L>
<L>Alone thy plea.—What the least provocation,</L>
<L>Say, canst thou but pretend?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SYPHAX.</SPEAKER>
<L>I needed none.</L>
<L><HI>Nature</HI> has in my being sown the seeds</L>
<L>Of enmity to thine.—Nay mark me this.</L>
<L>Couldst thou restore me to my former state,</L>
<L>Strike off these chains, give me the sword again,</L>
<L>The sceptre, and the wide-obedient war:</L>
<L>Yet must I still, implacable to thee,</L>
<L>Seek eagerly thy death, or die my self.</L>
<L>Life cannot hold us both!—Unequal gods!</L>
<L>Who love to disappoint mankind, and take</L>
<L>All Vengeance to your selves; why to the point</L>
<L>Of my long-flatter'd wishes did ye lift me,</L>
<L>Then sink me thus so low? Just as I drew</L>
<L>The glorious stroke that was to make me happy,</L>
<L>Why did you blast my strong extended arm?</L>
<L>Strike the dry sword unsated to the ground?</L>
<L>But that to mock us is your cruel sport?</L>
<L>What else is human life?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASINISSA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus always join'd</L>
<L>With an inhuman heart, and brutal manners,</L>
<L>Is irreligion to the ruling gods;</L>
<L>Whose schemes our peevish ignorance arraigns,</L>
<L>Our thoughtless pride.—Thy lost condition, <HI>Syphax,</HI></L>
<L>Is nothing to the tumult of thy breast.</L>
<L>There lies the sting of evil, there the drop</L>
<L>That poisons nature.—Ye mysterious powers!</L>
<L>Whose ways are ever-gracious, ever-just,</L>
<L>As ye think wisest, best, dispose of me;</L>
<L>But, whether thro' your gloomy depths I wander,</L>
<L>Or on your mountains walk; give me the calm</L>
<L>The steady, smiling soul; where wisdom sheds,</L>
<L>Eternal sunshine and eternal joy.</L>
<L>Then, if misfortune comes, she brings along</L>

<L>—'Tis true, my friend,</L>
<L>Thou good old man, by whom my youth was form'd,</L>
<L>The firm companion of my various life,</L>
<L>I own, 'tis true, that <HI>Sophonisba</HI>'s image</L>

<L>To nobler <HI>Rome</HI>; beneath whose laurel'd brow,</L>
<L>And ample eye, the nations grow polite,</L>
<L>Humane and happy. Then thou may'st remember,</L>
<L>Such is this woman's high impetuous spirit,</L>
<L>That all-controuling love she bears her country,</L>
<L>Her <HI>Carthage</HI>; that at this she sacrific'd</L>

<L>I thank thy honest zeal. But never dread</L>
<L>The firmness of my heart, my strong attachment,</L>
<L>Severe to <HI>Rome,</HI> to <HI>Scipio,</HI> and to Glory.</L>
<L>Indeed, I cannot, would not quite forget</L>

<L>Gave her quick spirit into gayer life.</L>
<L>Then every word was liveliness, and wit;</L>
<L>We heard the Muses' song; and the dance swam</L>

<L>Was mark'd the general's prize. She wept, and blush'd,</L>
<L>Young, fresh, and blooming like the morn. An eye,</L>
<L>As when the blue sky trembles thro' a cloud</L>
<L>Of purest white. A secret charm combin'd</L>
<L>Her features, and infus'd enchantment thro' them.</L>
<L>Her shape was harmony.—But eloquence</L>
<L>Beneath her beauty fails; which seem'd, on purpose,</L>
<L>Pour'd out by lavish nature, that mankind</L>
<L>Might see this action in its highest lustre.</L>
<L>Soft, as she pass'd along, with downcast eyes,</L>
<L>Where gentle sorrow swell'd, and now and then</L>
<L>Dropt o'er her modest cheek a trickling tear,</L>
<L>The <HI>Roman</HI> legions languish'd; and hard war</L>
<L>Felt more than pity. Even <HI>Scipio</HI>'s self,</L>
<L>As on his high tribunal rais'd he sat,</L>
<L>Turn'd from the piercing sight, and chiding ask'd</L>

<L>Ambition sickens at the very thought.—</L>
<L>To puff, and bustle here from day to day,</L>

<L>Why should we kill the best of passions, love?</L>
<L>It aids the heroe, bids ambition rise,</L>
<L>Turns us to please, inspires immortal deeds,</L>
<L>Even softens brutes, and makes the good more good.</L>

<SPEAKER>SCIPIO.</SPEAKER>
<L>There is a holy tenderness indeed,</L>
<L>A nameless sympathy, a fountain-love;</L>
<L>Branch'd infinite from parents to their children,</L>
<L>From child to child, from kindred on to kindred,</L>

<L>While I the hardest office of a friend</L>
<L>Discharge; and, with a necessary hand,</L>
<L>A hand tho' harsh at present really tender,</L>

<L>O luxury to think!—But while he rages,</L>
<L>Burns in a fever, shall I let him quaff</L>
<L>Delicious poison for a cooling draught,</L>
<L>In foolish pity to his thirst? shall I</L>
<L>Let a swift flame consume him as he sleeps,</L>
<L>Because his dreams are gay? shall I indulge</L>
<L>A frenzy flash'd from an infectious eye?</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="70"/>
A sudden impulse unapprov'd by reason?</L>
<L>Nay by thy cool deliberate thought condemn'd?</L>
<L>Resolv'd against?—A passion for a woman,</L>
<L>Who has abus'd thee basely? left thy youth,</L>
<L>Thy love as sweet as tender as the spring,</L>
<L>The blooming heroe for the hoary tyrant?</L>
<L>And now who makes thy sheltering arms alone</L>
<L>Her last retreat, to save her from the vengeance,</L>
<L>Which even her very perfidy to thee</L>
<L>Has brought upon her head?—Nor is this all.—</L>
<L>A woman who will ply her deepest arts,</L>
<L>(Ah too prevailing, as appears already)</L>
<L>Will never rest, till <HI>Syphax</HI>' fate is thine;</L>
<L>Till friendship weeping flies; we join no more</L>
<L>In glorious deeds, and thou fall off from <HI>Rome?</HI></L>
<L>I too could add, that there is something mean,</L>
<L>Inhuman in thy passion. Does not <HI>Syphax,</HI></L>
<L>While thou rejoicest, die? The generous heart</L>
<L>Should scorn a pleasure which gives others pain.</L>

<L>If this, my friend, all this consider'd deep,</L>

<L>The happy groves of heroes and of lovers:</L>
<L>But the divinity that breathes in thee</L>
<L>Has broke the charm, and I am in a desart;</L>
<L>Far from the land of peace. It was but lately</L>
<L>That a pure joyous calm o'erspread my soul,</L>
<L>And reason tun'd my passions into bliss;</L>
<L>When love came hurrying in, and with rash hand,</L>
<L>Mix'd them delirious, till they now ferment</L>
<L>To misery.—There is no reasoning down</L>

<L>While slaves at heart? while by fantastick turns</L>
<L>Our frantic passions rage? The very thought</L>

<L>Whisper reproach.—O ye celestial powers!</L>
<L>What is it, in a torrent of success,</L>

<L>Our squeamish author scruples this proceeding;</L>

<L>A glaring model, of no private use.</L>
<L>Ladies, he bid me say, behold your <HI>Cato.</HI></L>
<L>What tho' no <HI>Stoic</HI> she, nor read in <HI>Plato?</HI></L>
<L>Yet sure she offer'd, for her country's sake,</L>
<L>A sacrifice, which <HI>Cato</HI> could not make—</L>
<L>—Already, now, these wicked men are sneering,</L>
<L>Some wresting what one says, and others leering.</L>
<L>I vow they have not strength for—public spirit.</L>
<L>That, ladies, must be your superior merit.</L>

<L>—Lard! how could such a creature shew her face?</L>
<L>How?—Just as you do there—thro' <HI>Brussels</HI> Lace.</L>
<L>The <HI>Roman</HI> fair, the public in distress,</L>
