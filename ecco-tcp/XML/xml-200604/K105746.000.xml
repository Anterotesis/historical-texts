<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT gave Occasion to the
following <HI>Essay</HI> is briefly
what follows, my learned and
worthy Friend Dr. <HI>Cheyne,</HI>
some rears ago published an Essay upon
<HI>Health and long Life,</HI> in which he
gave a Proof both of his Judgment
and Humanity. This Book was receiv'd
by the Publick, with the Respect that
was due to the Importance of its Con∣tents;
it became the Subject of Con∣versation,
and produc'd even Sects in
the dietetick Philosophy. In some of
those symposiac Disputations amongst my
Acquaintance, being appeal'd to; I
happen'd to affirm that the dietetick Part
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
of Medicine depended, as much as any
of the rest, upon scientifick Principles:
Being call'd upon to make good my As∣sertion,
I compos'd the following short
Treatise which is properly speaking only
an Essay or Attempt of a <HI>Physiology
of Aliment.</HI> The most of it was wrote
in a Situation, where I had no As∣sistance
except from Extracts out of some
imperfect Editions of the Works of the
most learned and industrious <HI>Boerhaave,</HI>
and from a very excellent Edition of his
Chymistry by Dr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cham∣bers.</HI>
This I am oblig'd to say once
for all, to save my self the Trouble of
perpetual Quotations: The Circumstan∣ces
of ill Health, and Absence from my
Books in which I compos'd it, and the
Want of Leisure since to correct it suf∣ficiently,
may he some Excuse for the
Want of that Accuracy which the Sub∣ject
deserves, and which I frankly
own, I have discover'd in some Things
of small moment since the Book was
printed off. I am likewise obliged to
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
make use of a very common and tri∣vial
Reason for publishing it at this
Time, <HI>viz.</HI> the Approbation of some
Friends who perus'd it, and persuaded
me that it might be of some Use to the
Publick. I can say but little of the
Merit of the Performance, but a great
deal of that of the Subject; for surely
the Choice and Measure of the Mate∣rials
of which the whole Body is com∣pos'd,
and what we take daily by
Pounds, is at least of as much Impor∣tance,
as of what we take seldom, and
only by Grains and Spoonfuls.</P>
<P>The Reader must not be surpriz'd to
find the most common and ordinary
Facts taken notice of: In Subjects of
this Nature there is no room for In∣vention;
many important Consequences
may be drawn from the Observation of
the most common Things, and analogous
Reasonings from the Causes of them.</P>
<P>I believe a Reader with as much
Anatomy as a Butcher knows, and mo∣derate
Skill in Mechanicks, may un∣derstand
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
the whole Essay, provided he
goes through it at Leisure, and with
Attention: To a Person so qualify'd
many Observations concerning his own
Constitution will occur, which I was
not capable of making; as for the hard
Words which I was oblig'd to use,
they are either Terms of Art, or such
as I substituted in the place of others,
that were too low, and vulgar; the
Reader will find most of them explain'd
at the Beginning of the Book: And
I hope an Indulgence to a few, will
not be reckon'd an Indignity to the rest;
and that I shall not be suspected of
Affectation, where my principal Inten∣tion
was Perspicuity. In Subjects of
this Kind, one is oblig'd in the same
Paragraph, to join many Particulars
together in one Proposition; because the
Repetition of the Substantive Verb
would be tedious and unnecessary. This
hinders the Stile from being smooth,
but not from being perspicuous.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
I have laid a Plan for treating the
other Parts of Diet, as Air, Rest, and
Motion after the same Manner; but I
am oblig'd to delay the Execution of
my Design till I have more Leisure.</P>
<P>I do not presume to instruct the Gen∣tlemen
of my own Profession; and if
any of them shall instruct me better, I
declare before-hand that I am very
willing to be convinc'd: I will not de∣fend
any Mistake, and at the same
time I do not think my self oblig'd to
answer every frivolous Objection.</P>

<HEAD>THE
EXPLANATION
OF SOME
CHYMICAL TERMS
Used in the following
ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>AS the following Treatise is chief∣ly
design'd for Persons not bred
up in the Profession of Phy∣sick,
it is necessary to give a
general Notion of the Mean∣ing
of some Chymical Words that fre∣quently
occur in it.</P>
<P>The Principles of Natural Bodies ac∣cording
to the Chymists, are Water, Earth,
Oil, Salt, Spirit, of all which every one
has some general Notion; but the Diver∣sity
<PB N="xxvi" REF="24"/>
of the Names and Qualities of Salts
and Spirits occasions some Confusion in
the Minds of such as are ignorant of Chy∣mistry.</P>
<P>The Chymists define Salt from some
of its Properties, to be a Body fusible in
the Fire, congealable again by Cold into
britle Glebes or Crystals, soluble in Wa∣ter
so as to disappear, not malleable, and
having something in it which affecteth
the Organs of Taste with a Sensation of
Acrimony or Sharpness. Of Native Salts
there are,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Sea-Salt and Sal Gemmae, or
Rock-Salt which are of the same Nature.
The first in all appearance being a Solu∣tion
of the Second in the Water of the
Ocean; these two are perfect Salts, fixt,
and immutable by any Power in Animal
Bodies; for the other Salts are never
found in the Urine of any Animal that
swallows them down, but Sea-Salt is al∣ways
found in the Urine of every Animal
that takes it, and in no other.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Sal Nitre, or Sal Petre, which
is more easily dissolv'd by Fire, and less
easily by Water than any other Salt, it is
cold and affects the Tongue like a saltish
Ice: It seems to be of a middle Nature
between Fossile and Animal, being pro∣ducible
from Animal Excrements inter∣mix'd
with vegetable Salts.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvii" REF="25"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Sal Ammoniac of two Sorts,
the ancient described by <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Dios∣corides</HI>
no more to be found: And the
Modern which is a Compound of Fossile,
Animal and Vegetable Salt. This Salt
cools Water, it is fix'd in a gentle Fire
and sublimes in a great one, its Taste is
quicker than that of common Salt re∣sembling
that of Urine.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Borax, a Fossile Salt of a
sweetish Taste, it promotes the Fusion of
Metals.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Alum, which tho' no pure Salt,
has most of the Properties of Salts, being
soluble in Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Salts are divided into Acid and Alka∣line:
Of Acid or Sour, one has a Notion
from Taste; Sourness being one of those
simple Ideas, which one cannot more
plainly describe. What being mix'd with
an Acid causeth an Effervescence, is call'd
an Alkali.</P>
<P>Effervescence in the Chymical Sense,
signifies an intestine Commotion, produ∣ced
by mixing two Bodies together, that
lay at rest before; attended sometimes
with a hissing Noise, Froathing, and E∣bullition:
For Example, let us place in
the first Class, Acids as Vinegar, Juice of
Lemons, Juice of Oranges, Spirit of Ni∣tre,
Spirit of Alum: In the second Class,
other Saline Substances obtain'd from A∣nimals
<PB N="xxviii" REF="26"/>
and Vegetables, by Distillation,
Putrefaction, Calcination, as Spirit of
Urine, Spirit of Harts-horn, Salt of Tar∣tar;
because the Substances of the second
Class, being mix'd with the Substances of
the first raise an Effervescence, they are
call'd Alkalis. There is a third Class of
Substances, commonly call'd Absorbents,
as the various Kinds of Shels, Coral,
Chalk, Crabs-eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which being
mix'd with the first Class, likewise raise
an Effervescence, and are therefore call'd
Alkalis, tho' not so properly; for they
are not Salts and have nothing common
with the second Class, except this Quality
of fermenting with Acids.</P>
<P>It is observable that a violent Cold, as
well as Heat may be produced by this
Ebullition; for if Sal Ammoniac, or any
pure volatile Alkali dissolv'd in Water be
mix'd with an Acid; an Ebullition with
a great Degree of Cold will ensue, there∣fore,
I think (with leave of the Chy∣mists)
Effervescence not so proper a Word
to express this intestine Motion. There
is another Criterion of Acid and Alkali
by the Change of Colour which they pro∣duce
in some Bodies; for Example, those
Liquors, which being pour'd to the Syrup
of Violets turn it red, are Acids; those
which change it into a green Colour, are
reckon'd Alkalis. Thus Oil of Vitriol
<PB N="xxix" REF="27"/>
Syrup of Violets red, and Oil of
Tartar green.</P>
<P>The Word Alkali, comes from an Herb
call'd by the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> Kali. This Herb
they burnt to Ashes, boil'd them in Wa∣ter;
and after having evaporated the Wa∣ter,
there remain'd at the bottom a white
Salt, this they call'd Sal Kali, or Alkali.
It is corrosive, producing Putrefaction in
Animal Substances, to which it is ap∣ply'd.</P>
<P>Substances which are not perfectly A∣cid
but naturally turn so, I call Acescent.
Substances which are not perfectly Alka∣line
but naturally turn so, I call Alka∣lescent.</P>
<P>These are not Qualities in Bodies mere∣ly
imaginary, but have very different and
contrary Effects upon Human Bodies.</P>
<P>Salts which are neither Acid nor Al∣kaline,
are call'd Neutral, so are Sal Am∣moniac,
Sea-Salt, Sal Gemmae, Borax,
Alum, Nitre, which as long as they re∣tain
their Saline Quality, are neither A∣cid
nor Alkaline. But the Chymical Pro∣ducts
of them all (except Sal Ammoniac)
are generally Acid.</P>
<P>Fix'd Salts are such as sustain the Fire
without flying away.</P>
<P>Volatile Salts fly away with a small
Heat, affecting the Nose with an urinous
Smell.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="28"/>
There are volatile and fix'd Alkalis.</P>
<P>The essential Salts of Plants are such
as shoot upon the Sides of the Vessels,
which contain their express'd Juices.</P>
<P>In Distillations what trickles down the
Sides of the Receiver in certain unctious
Rivulets, if it will not mix with Water,
it is call'd Oil, if it will mix with Wa∣ter,
it is call'd Spirits; Spirits are either
inflammable, or not inflammable. The last
either Acid or Alkaline. Alkaline Spi∣rits,
are subtile volatile Liquors, that run
in Veins down the Sides of the Receiver
in Distillations, which will not take Fire,
mix with Water, and contain some Al∣kaline
Salt, as Spirit of Harts-horn. Such
are obtain'd from all the Parts of Ani∣mals,
from all Plants by Putrefaction, and
from the pungent Kind, as Mustard,
Horse-Radish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without it. Acid Spi∣rits
are subtile Liquors which come over
in Distillations, not inflammable, miscible
with Water, such are obtain'd from Ve∣getables
distill'd with Water, and like∣wise
from Fossils; inflammable Spirits are
subtile volatile Liquors which come over
in Distillations, miscible with Water, and
wholly combustible; such Spirits are ob∣tainable
from Plants by a previous Fer∣mentation,
and not without it. By the
Spirit of a Plant or that of an Animal,
we understand that pure elaborated Oil,
<PB N="xxxi" REF="29"/>
which by reason of its extreme Volatility
exhales spontaneously, in which the Odour
or Smell consists.</P>
<P>Soap is a Mixture of a fix'd Alkaline
Salt and Oil, in common Use its Virtues
are cleansing, penetrating, attenuating and
resolving. Any Mixture of any oily Sub∣stance
with Salt may be call'd a Soap.</P>
<P>Bodies of this Nature are call'd Sapo∣naceous.</P>
<P>He who would skilfully treat of the
Nature and Choice of different Sorts of
Aliment, ought to draw his Observations
from the following Particulars. <HI>First,</HI>
From the Alterations which the Aliment
undergoes in its Passage into the Blood.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> From the Alteration it under∣goes
during its Circulation with the
Blood. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> From the Nature and
most simple Analysis of Vegetable Sub∣stances.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> From the Nature and
most simple Analysis of Animal Substan∣ces.
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> He ought to treat of the
Effects of different Sorts of Alimentary
Substanees upon the Fluids and Solids of
a Human Body. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> Of the diffe∣rent
Intentions to be pursued in the
Choice of Aliment in different Constitu∣tions.
Tho' I have neither Time, Abi∣lity,
nor Observations sufficient to handle
those Particulars so fully as they deserve,
<PB N="xxxii" REF="30"/>
I hope at least to give a Specimen how
they ought to be treated.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to the Doctrine of
<HI>Hippocrates,</HI> who tells you in his first
Book of Diet, that to write duly upon it,
one must understand the Nature of Ali∣ment,
and of the Person it is given to.</P>
<P>For the Ease of the Reader, I have set
down every thing in distinct Propositions
with Inferences and Observations; the
first in <HI>Roman,</HI> the other in common
Numbers.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. I.</HEAD>
<P>MASTICATION is a very
necessary Preparation of solid
Aliment, without which there can
be no good Digestion. By chewing,
solid Aliment is divided into small
<PB N="2" REF="32"/>
Parts; in a human Body, there is no
other Instrument to perform this
Action, but the Teeth. By the Action
of chewing, the Spittle and Mucus is
squeez'd from the Glands, and mix'd
with the Aliment, which Action if
it be long continued, will turn the
Aliment into a sort of Chyle. The
Spittle is an active Liquor, immedi∣ately
deriv'd from the arterial Blood.
It is saponaceous, as appears by its
froathing, and likewise by distilla∣tion,
and consequently is attenuating,
resolving, penetrating, and deter∣ging.
After long Abstinence, it is ex∣tremely
acrid, and copious, it fer∣ments
with the juices of Vegetables,
and consequently disposeth them to
be chang'd into inflamable Spirits,
it discovereth its Virtues in several
Chirurgical uses. Besides, in the action
of chewing, the Mucus (which is an
Humour different from the Spittle,
and by its Viscidity collects Air) mix∣eth
with the Aliment, and helps to
<PB N="3" REF="33"/>
attenuate it. The necessity of Saliva
or Spittle to dissolve the Aliment, ap∣pears
from the contrivance of Na∣ture
in making the salivary Ducts of
Animals, which ruminate or chew the
Cud, extremely open. Such Animals
as swallow their Aliment without
chewing, want salivary Glands; and
Birds have them placed in their Maw.
There are instances of Men who
swallow'd their Meat whole, but
Ruminated or chew'd the Cud after∣wards.
(Rumination is given to A∣nimals
to enable them at once to lay
up a great store of Food and after∣wards
to chew it.) And Animals ru∣minate
more upon Hay than Grass,
the Food being harder. From all
which Observations it appears, that
the Solution of the Aliment by Ma∣stication
is very necessary; and that
without it the Aliment could not be
duly disposed; for the other changes
which it receives as it passeth through
the Alimentary duct.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="34"/>
<HI>First,</HI> A great loss of Spittle causeth
a decay of Appetite. This has been
confirm'd by Experience in several,
who have made it their constant cu∣stom
to chew Mastick; chewing and
smoaking of Tobacco is only good
in phlegmatick People.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The humour of Saliva∣tion
is not properly Spittle, but pu∣trified
Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The depravation of the
Instruments of Mastication, by a
paralytical disposition, or by the want
of Teeth, as in old Men and Infants,
is a natural Indication of a liquid
Dyet, as of Milk and Broaths, and
even such of them as take Solids
ought to chew in order to make an
expression of the Spittle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The Change which is made of the
Aliment in the Stomach, is effected
by Attrition of the solid Parts, or
inward Coat of the Stomach, and
<PB N="5" REF="35"/>
the action of a dissolvent Liquor
assisted with Heat.</P>
<P>The Liquor in the Stomach con∣sists
of that which is separated from
its inward Coat; of the Spittle,
which is almost continually swal∣low'd,
and the Liquor which distills
from the Gullet. By the help of this
Liquor, and the constant Attrition
of the solid Parts, the Aliment is
dissolv'd by an Operation resembling
that of making an Emulsion, in
which Operation the Oyly parts of
Nutts and Seeds being gently ground
in a Marble Mortar, and gradually
mix'd with some watery Liquor, are
dissolv'd into a sweet, thick, turbid
milky Liquor, resembling the Chyle
in an Animal Body. That the Sto∣mach
in Animals levigates the Sub∣stances,
which it receives, is evident
from the Dissection of some Animals
which have swallow'd Metals,
which have been found polish'd on
the side next the Stomach. Birds being
<PB N="6" REF="36"/>
without Teeth to make the first
preparation of their Aliment, have
strong and nervous Stomachs, to
make this Attrition the stronger;
and this motion in them hath been
both seen and heard. The Rugae or
Plyes of the inward Coat of the
Stomach contribute to the detain∣ing
the Aliment in the Stomach.
The Heat in Land Animals helps
likewise to the Solution of the Ali∣ment,
but not much, for Fishes
have a strong digestion without it,
tho' by the tryal of the Thermo∣scope,
they have more heat than the
Element which they swim in. It has
been show'd before that the Spittle
is a great Dissolvent, and there is a
great quantity of it in the Stomach,
being swallow'd constantly, at least
in Sleep. He who eats a Pound of
Bread swallows at least as much Spit∣tle
as Bread. This Liquor of the
Stomach in a sound state is not Acid,
for it has been found by Experiments,
<PB N="7" REF="37"/>
that Pearls have pass'd through Cocks
and Hens undissolv'd.</P>
<P>1. The Liquor of the Stomach,
which with fasting grows extremely
Acrid, and the quick sensation of the
inward villous Coat of the Stomach,
seem to be the cause of the Sense of
Hunger.</P>
<P>2. Such as have, by the use of
spirituous Liquors, weaken'd and de∣stroy'd
some of the solid parts of the
Stomach, cannot recover a right
Digestion, for this inward villous Coat
when destroy'd cannot be restor'd.</P>
<P>3. This Liquor of the Stomach
may (by reason of some saline Acri∣mony)
be made of some determined
quality, and affect human Creatures
with Appetites of other Animals,
which in that case they can take
without hurt; or it may likewise
occasion an exorbitant Appetite of
usual things, which they will take in
such quantities till they vomit it up
like Dogs, from whence it is call'd
<PB N="8" REF="38"/>
Canine; in the first case the Organs
of Taste are vitiated; both Diseases
are cur'd by Dyet, opposite to this
Acrimony, whether Alkaline, Acid or
Muriatick.</P>
<P>4. Thirst and Hunger denote the
state of the Spittle, and Liquor of
the Stomach. Thirst is the sign of
an Acrimony commonly Alkales∣cent
or Muriatick.</P>
<P>5. A Paralytical disposition of the
Nerves of the Stomach, a deprav'd
condition of the Liquor of the Sto∣mach,
something viscous, fat and
oyly remaining there, destroys the
Sensation of Hunger.</P>
<P>6. The Action of the Stomach is
totally stop'd by too great Repleti∣on,
in which case both the Orifices
of the Stomach by a necessary Me∣chanism
close, and neither will ad∣mit
nor expel any thing. In which
case relaxing, as by warm Water, is
the only proper Expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="39"/>
The Signs of the Functions of the
Stomach being deprav'd, are Pains
in the Stomach many Hours after
Repast; Eructations either with the
Taste of the Aliment Acid, Nido∣rose,
or Foetid, resembling the Taste
of rotten Eggs; Inflations, or the Sen∣sation
of Fulness; Sickness, Hickup,
Vomiting, a Flushing in the Coun∣tenance,
Foulness of the Tongue. In
general, whatever be the State of the
Tongue, the same is that of the in∣ward
Coat of the Stomach. When
the Taste of the Mouth is bitter, it
is a Sign of a Redundance of a bi∣lious
Alkali, and demands a quite
different Dyet from the case of Aci∣dity
or Sowerness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>By Digestion in the Alimentary
Duct the specifick Difference of all
Substances is abolish'd, and the whole
Action resembles Putrefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="40"/>
Digestion is a Fermentation be∣gun,
because there is all the Requi∣sites
of such a Fermentation, Heat,
Air and Motion, but it is not a
compleat Fermentation, because that
requires a greater Time than the Con∣tinuance
of the Aliment in the Sto∣mach.
Vegetable Putrefaction resem∣bles
very much Animal Digestion.
Vegetable Putrefaction is produced
by throwing Green succulent Vege∣tables
in a Heap in open warm Air,
and pressing them together, by which
all Vegetables acquire, <HI>First,</HI> A Heat
equal to that of a Human Body.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> A putrid stercoraceous Taste
and Odour, in Taste resembling pu∣trid
Flesh, and in Smell Human Foe∣ces.
This putrid Matter being di∣still'd,
affords, <HI>First,</HI> A Water im∣pregnated
with an urinous Spirit,
like that obtainable from Animal
Substances, which Water is seperable
into Elementary Water, and a vola∣tile
Animal Salt. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A vola∣tile
<PB N="11" REF="41"/>
oyly Alkaline Salt. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A
volatile thick Oyl. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> The
remainder being calcin'd affords no
fixt Salt; in short, every thing hap∣pens
as if the Subject had not been
Vegetable, but Animal. Putrefaction
utterly destroys the specifick Diffe∣rence
of one Vegetable from ano∣ther,
converting them into a pulpy
Substance of an Animal Nature:
Making the same Alteration very
near as if the Vegetable had gone
through the Body of a sound Ani∣mal,
for tho' such an Animal should
entirely live upon Acids, no Part of
its Body affords any acid fix'd Salt.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Philosophical Transactions.</NOTE> This is so far true, that even the
Herbs taken out of the <HI>Omasus</HI> of
ruminating Animals afford the same
Contents as putrefied Vegetables. But
tho' this Action of Putrefaction comes
the nearest to Animal Digestion, it
so far differs from it, that the Salts
<PB N="12" REF="42"/>
and Oyls are only detain'd in the
Animal Body so long as they remain
benign and friendly to it; but as
soon as they putrefy entirely, are ei∣ther
thrown off, or must produce
mortal Distempers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>The Gall is the principal Dissol∣vent
of the Aliment, and when it is
peccant or deficient, there can be no
right Digestion.</P>
<P>The Bile is of two Sorts, the Cy∣stick
or that contain'd in the Gall∣Bladder,
which is a sort of Repository
for the Gall, and the Hepatick or what
flows immediately from the Liver. The
Cystick Gall is thick and intensly bit∣ter,
so that one Drop of it will make a
whole Pint of Water bitter. The He∣patick
Gall is more fluid and not so
bitter. There is no other bitter Hu∣mour
in a Human Body, besides
Gall, except the Wax of the Ear.
<PB N="13" REF="43"/>
The Gall is not a perfect Alkali, for
it does not ferment with an Acid,
but it is Alkalescent, entirely oppo∣site
to Acescents, and soon corrupti∣ble,
and convertible into a Corrosive
Alkali. It is a saponaceous Sub∣stance,
being compos'd of an Alka∣line
Salt, Oyl and Water, all which
can be extracted from it. The Bile,
like Soap, takes out Spots from Wool
or Silk, and the Painters use it to
mix their Colours; by this sapona∣ceous
Quality, it mixeth the oyly
and watery Parts of the Aliment to∣gether.
But tho' the Bile be an Oyl,
it is not combustible till dry. These
Qualities make it a most powerful
and proper Dissolvent, which ap∣pears
by Experience. The Milk in
the Stomach of Calves, which is co∣agulated
by the Runnet, is again dis∣solv'd,
and rendered fluid by the Gall
in the <HI>Duodenum.</HI> Voracious Ani∣mals,
and such as do not chew, have
a great Quantity of Gall, and some
<PB N="14" REF="44"/>
of them have the Biliary Duct in∣serted
into the <HI>Pylorus.</HI> It is like∣wise
the chief Instrument (by its Ir∣ritation)
of the peristaltick Motion of
the Guts. Such as have the Bile
peccant or deficient are reliev'd by
Bitters, which are a sort of subsidia∣ry
Gall. The learned <HI>Boorhaave</HI> has
found the Gall of an Eel, which is
most intensely bitter, a most effectual
Remedy in such Cases. The com∣mon
Symptoms of the Excretion of
the Bile being vitiated, are a yel∣lowish
Colour of the Skin, white
hard Foeces, a Loss of Appetite, a
lixivial Urine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. V.</HEAD>
<P>The Bile is so acrid, that of itself
it could not be admitted into the
Lacteal Vessels. Therefore Nature
has furnish'd another Humour, <HI>viz.</HI>
the pancreatick Juice to temper its
Bitterness and Acrimony, after it has
done its Office.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="45"/>
The Pancreas is a large salivary
Gland separating about a Pound of
an Humour like Spittle, in twelve
Hours. The Bile mix'd with Spit∣tle
loseth its Bitterness in time, and
even Wormwood eat with Bread
will do so, because it is mix'd with
a great quantity of Spittle. The pan∣creatick
Juice likewise mixeth the
Parts of the Aliment rendring the
Chyle Homogeneous. When the Bile
is not separated in the Liver the Foe∣ces
are white, but this is not occa∣sion'd
by the Mixture of the pan∣creatick
Juice.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>Acrimony and Tenacity are the
two Qualities in what we take in∣wardly
most to be avoided.</P>
<P>The papillous inward Coat of the
Intestines is extremely sensible, and
when the Acrimony is so great as to
affect the solid Parts, the Sensation of
<PB N="16" REF="46"/>
Pain is intolerable. The peristaltick
Motion of the Guts, and the conti∣nual
Expression of the Fluids, will
not suffer the least Matter to be ap∣ply'd
to one Point the least instant
of Time; for the smallest quantity
of Turpentine or Pitch will stick to
the Fingers, but not to the Guts.
But this Motion in some Human
Creatures may be weak in respect to
the Viscidity of what is taken so as
not to be able to propell it, the
consequence of which is dangerous,
and perhaps fatal to the Life of the
Creature. Substances hard, cannot
be dissolv'd, but they will pass; but
such whose Tenacity exceeds the
Powers of Digestion will neither pass
nor be converted into Aliment. Be∣sides,
the Mouths of the Lacteals
may permit Aliment too acrimoni∣ous,
or not sufficiently attenuated, to
enter in People of Lax Constitutions,
whereas their Sphincters will shut a∣gainst
them in such as have strong
<PB N="17" REF="47"/>
Fibres. The Mouths of the Lacteals
may be shut up by a viscid <HI>Mucus,</HI>
in which case the Chyle passeth by
Stool, and the Person falleth into an
Atrophy.</P>
<P>1. Fat or Oyl is necessary, as for
Animal Motion, so likewise for this
peristaltick Motion, of the Intestines,
and lean People often suffer for want
of it, as fat People may by Obstru∣ction
of the Vessels. The <HI>Omentum</HI>
will melt by strong Motion, as has
been found in Horses by hard run∣ning.</P>
<P>2. This peristaltick Motion, or re∣peated
Changes of Contraction and
Dilatation, is not the Lower Guts,
else one would have a continual need∣ing
to go to stool. Wind and Di∣stention
of the Bowels are Signs of
a bad Digestion in the Intestines, (for
in dead Animals when there is no
Digestion at all, the Distention is in
the greatest Extremity) and Diarhaeas
which proceed from Acrimony, La∣xity
<PB N="18" REF="48"/>
of the Bowels or Obstruction of
the Lacteals.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>The Mechanism of Nature in con∣verting
our Aliment; into Animal
Substances consists chiefly in two
Things. <HI>First,</HI> By mixing constant∣ly
with it Animal, Juices already pre∣par'd.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> By the Action of
the solid Parts as it were churning
them together. This is evident, if
we consider first the vast quantity of
<HI>Saliva</HI> mix'd with the Aliment in
chewing. He that eats a Pound of
Bread mixeth it very near with as
much Spittle, and this separated from
Glands that weigh only about four
Ounces. Afterwards, the same Ali∣ment
is mix'd with the Liquor of
the Stomach, the Bile and pancrea∣tick
Juice, and if we compute the
quantity of Bile and Pancreatick,
from the Weight of these <HI>Viscera</HI> in
<PB N="19" REF="49"/>
respect of the salivary Glands, we shall
find still a vastly greater quantity of
these Animal Juices mix'd with the
Aliment; this is not all, for when
the Chyle passeth through the Me∣sentery,
it is mix'd with the Lymph
(which is the most spirituous and e∣laborated
Part of the Blood) from
the Glands of the Mesentery: So
that the Juices of an Animal Body
are as it were<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> new distill'd</NOTE> cohobated, being
excreted and admitted again into the
Blood with the fresh Aliment; all
the while the solid Parts act upon
the Mixture of Aliment and Animal
Juices so as to make the Mixture
more perfect; besides, none of these
Juices, except the Liquor of the Inte∣stines,
are mix'd with the Foeces of
an Animal, which in a sound State
are hard. So that one may com∣pute
that a Pound of Bread before
it enters the Blood, is mix'd perhaps
<PB N="20" REF="50"/>
with four times the quantity of Ani∣mal
Juices. The same Oeconomy
is observ'd in the Circulation of the
Chyle with the Blood, by mixing it
intimately with the Parts of the Fluid
to which it is to be assimilated.</P>
<P>1. From whence it follows, that
an Animal whose Juices are unsound
or solid Parts weak can never be duly
nourish'd, for unsound Juices can never
duly repair the Fluids and Solids of
an Animal Body, and without a due
Action of the solid Parts, they never
can be well mix'd. The Stomach,
the Intestines, the Muscles of the
lower Belly, all act upon the Ali∣ment;
besides, the Chyle is not suck'd
but squeez'd into the Mouths of the
Lacteals by the Action of the Fibres
of the Guts: The Mouths of the
Lacteals are open'd by the intestinal
Tube, affecting a streight instead of
a spiral Cylinder. Thus it is plain,
that the Chyle must be peccant in
Quantity or Quality when these Acti∣ons
<PB N="21" REF="51"/>
and Organs are too weak, and
whatever strengthens the solid Parts
must help the Digestion.</P>
<P>2. Diarhaeas and strong Purgati∣ons
must spoil the first Digestion,
because of the great Quantities of
Animal Liquids which they expel
out of the Body; a vast Quantity and
Variety of Animal Liquors are car∣ried
off by Purging, Air, Spittle,
<HI>Mucus,</HI> all the Liquors that are sepa∣rated
in the Glands of the Alimenta∣ry
Duct, both Sorts of Bile, the pan∣creatick
Juice, Lymph, and sometimes
Blood; computing the Quantity of
these Secretions, makes it plain that
the whole Juices may be carried off
by purging, and when those Liquors
are expell'd out of the Body, which
by their Mixture convert the Ali∣ment
into an Animal Liquid, this
cannot so well be perform'd.</P>
<P>3. The peristaltick Motion of the
Intestines is the last that ceaseth in
an Animal Body, for it remains af∣ter
<PB N="22" REF="52"/>
the Motion of the Heart is ceas'd.
By the Entry of the Chyle and Air
into the Blood, by the Lacteals, the
Animal may again revive.</P>
<P>The Obstruction of the Glands of
the Mesentery, is a great Impediment
to Nutrition, for the Lymph in those
Glands is a necessary Constituent of
the Aliment before it mixeth with
the Blood, and for the same Reason
young Animals are most and best
nourish'd, for the mesenterick Glands
are largest in the Vigour of Youth;
in old Age they vanish, and are ly∣able
to Obstructions. Therefore
scrophulous Persons can never be
duely nourish'd, for such as have Tu∣mors
in the Parotids often have them
in the Pancreas and Mesentery.</P>
<P>4. In tabid Persons Milk is the
best Restorative, for it is Chyle al∣ready
prepar'd; if a Nurse after be∣ing
suck'd dry eats Broath, the In∣fant
will suck the Broath almost un∣alter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="53"/>
5. The Chyle by Reason of the
Smoothness of its Particles is white,
it grows more grey in the thoracick
Duct where it still retains the Fla∣vour
of the Aliment.</P>
<P>6. Animals which take a large
quantity of Aliment by the Mouth
may be less nourish'd, than those that
take a smaller, for according to the
Force of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which make the Chyle.</NOTE> chylopooetick Or∣gans,
a larger or less quantity of
Chyle may be extracted from the
same quantity of Food.</P>

<P>The most subtile Part of the Chyle
passeth immediately into the Blood
by the absorbent Vessels of the Guts,
which discharge themselves into the
<PB N="24" REF="54"/>
meseraick Veins; their Largeness and
Number demonstrate this, for they
are numerous and vastly larger than
their correspondent Arteries; besides,
wherever there are Emissaries, there
are absorbent Vessels, <HI>ex. gr.</HI> in the
Skin, by the absorbent Vessels of which
Mercury will pass into the Blood.</P>
<P>Birds which have strong and large
Breasts, small Bellies, and their Ribs
upon their Backs have no Lacteals
nor thoracick Duct, and their Ali∣ment
passeth immediately into the
meseraick Veins. If one considers
the Capacity of the Thoracick Duct,
and the Slowness of the Passage of
the Aliment by the Lacteals through
it, and at the same time the great
quantity of some Liquors, as of cha∣lybeat
Water, which in some pass in

Calculation he will be able to de∣monstrate
that such a Quantity could
not pass into the Blood by the Tho∣racick

as will appear by what fol∣lows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The Lungs are the first and chief
Instrument of Sanguification.</P>
<P>The Chyle first mixeth with the
Blood, in the Subclavian Veins, and
enters with it into the Heart, where it
is very imperfectly mix'd, there being
no Mechanism nor Fermentation by
extraordinary Heat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to convert it
immediately into Blood, which is first
effected by the Lungs. The Wind∣pipe
divides it self into a great num∣ber
of Branches call'd <HI>Bronchia,</HI>
these end in small Air-Bladders dila∣table
and contractible, capable to be
inflated by the admission of Air, and
<PB N="27" REF="57"/>
to subside at the Expulsion of it.
The Pulmonary Artery and Vein pass
along the surfaces of these Air-Blad∣ders
in an infinite number of Rami∣fications.
A great number of those
Air-Bladders form what we call Lo∣buli,
which hang upon the Bronchia,
like bunches of Grapes upon a Stalk.
These Lobuli constitute the Lobes,
and the Lobes the Lungs. Let us see
what effect an Engine so contriv'd
will have upon the crude mixture of
Blood and Chyle; first, as the Blood
and Chyle pass through the Ramifi∣cations
of the Pulmonary Artery,
they will be still more perfectly mix'd,
a red Liquor, and a white Liquor
passing through only one Tube, will
both retain their Original Colours;
but if this Pipe is divided into
Branches, and these again subdivided,
the red and white Liquors, as they
pass through the Ramifications, will
be more intimately mix'd, and both
Colours will be blended together;
<PB N="28" REF="58"/>
the more Ramifications, the mixture
will be the more perfect; but this
is not all, for as this mixture of
Blood and Chyle passeth through the
Arterial Tube, it is press'd by two
contrary forces, that of the Heart
driving it forward against the sides
of the Tube, and the elastick force
of the Air pressing it on the opposite
side of those Air-Bladders, along the
surface of which (as was said before)
this Arterial Tube creeps. By those
two opposite forces, the parts of the
Liquor are compress'd together, and
as it were churn'd, and more inti∣mately
mix'd. Moreover by the al∣ternate
motion of those Air-Bladders,
whose surfaces are by turns freed
from mutual contact, and by a sud∣den
Subsidence meet again by the
ingress and egress of the Air; the
Liquor is still further attenuated,
dissolv'd, and chang'd into a homo∣geneous
Fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="59"/>
1. The force of the Air upon the
Pulmonary Artery is but small, in
respect of that of the Heart, but it
is still something, and whatever the
effect of it be, it encreaseth, and di∣minisheth
with the Gravity of the
Air, to which the Elasticity is pro∣portional.</P>
<P>As to the admittance of the
weighty and elastick parts of the Air
into the Blood, through the Coats
of the Vessels, it seems contrary to
Experience. The spumous and florid
state which the Blood acquires in
passing through the Lungs, is easily
accounted for, from its own Elasti∣city,
and the violent motion before
describ'd: The Aerial Particles in the
Blood and Chyle expanding them∣selves.
That the air in the Blood
Vessels has a communication with
the outward Air, I think seems plain
from the Experiments of Human
Creatures being able to bear Air of
much greater Density in diving, and of
<PB N="30" REF="60"/>
much less upon the tops of Moun∣tains,
provided the Changes be made
gradually; otherwise the Air within
the Vessels being of a less Density,
the outward Air would press their
sides together, and being of a greater
Density, would expand them so as
to endanger the Life of the Ani∣mal.</P>
<P>1. As much Blood passeth through
the Lungs, as through all the rest of
the Body. The Circulation is quicker
and Heat greater, and their Texture
is extremely delicate; upon all which
Accounts they are extremely sensible
of any Force either from the too vio∣lent
Motion or Acrimony of the
Blood.</P>
<P>2. Since the Lungs are the first
and chief Instrument of Sanguifica∣tion,
the Animal that has that Or∣gan
faulty, can never be duly nou∣rish'd,
nor have the Vital Juices,
(which are all deriv'd from the Blood)
in a good State; and this is true, un∣derstanding
<PB N="31" REF="61"/>
the Lungs only as an
Instrument of Digestion, and ab∣stracting
from an Acrid and Purulent
Matter, that mixeth with the Blood
in such as have their Lungs ulce∣rated;
therefore such as have a faulty
Circulation through the Lungs, ought
to eat very little at a time, because
the encrease of the quantity of fresh
Chyle must make that Circulation
still more uneasy, which indeed is the
case of Consumptive, and some
Asthmatick Persons, and accounts
for the Symptoms they are troubled
with after eating. The great Rule
of Dyet for Consumptive People, and
upon which the whole Cure depends,
is taking their Aliment in small
Quantities. It happens very often
unfortunately for Asthmatick Persons
that they have Voracious Appetites,
and consequently for want of a right
Sanguification are often Leucophleg∣matick.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="62"/>
3. The Choice as well as Quan∣tity
of Dyet, is of great Importance
to such as have weak Lungs, for it was
observ'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. I. Prop. VII. 5.</NOTE> that the Chyle in the
Thoracick Duct retain'd the Origi∣nal
Taste of the Aliment, which
not being yet converted into Blood,
and intirely subdued by Circulation,
must operate upon the Lungs into
which it enters in this Condition,
according to its original qualities.
The Lungs being the chief Instru∣ment
of Sanguification, and acting
strongly upon the Chyle to bring it
to an Animal Fluid, must be reacted
upon as strongly.</P>
<P>4. Good Air assists the Digestion,
as it is an Instrument of Sanguifica∣tion
in the Lungs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>The Chyle is not perfectly assi∣milated
into Blood by its Circulation
<PB N="33" REF="63"/>
through the Lungs, for it is known
by Experiments of Blood-letting,
that several Parts of it remain un∣mix'd
with the Blood, swimming a
top like an oily Substance, even
eight Hours after repast, and no
doubt this Digestion, as well as that
through the Alimentary Duct, is
different in different Subjects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>After the Chyle has pass'd through
the Lungs, Nature continues her
usual Mechanism to convert it into
Animal Substances, during its Cir∣culation
with the Blood, <HI>viz.</HI> by in∣timately
mixing the Parts of the
Aliment; with these of the Animal
Juices, by the action of the solid Parts.</P>
<P>The mixture of Blood and Chyle
after its Circulation through the
Lungs, being brought back into the
left Ventricle of the Heart is drove
again by the Heart into the Aorta,
<PB N="34" REF="64"/>
through the whole Arterial System,
every Particle of the Body receives
some Branch from the Aorta, except
some of the solid Parts of the Liver.
The Arteries are Elastick Tubes, en∣dued
with a Contractile Force, by
which they squeeze, and drive the
Blood still forward, it being hin∣der'd
from going backward by the
Valves of the Heart. The Arteries
are Conical Vessels, with their Ba∣ses
towards the Heart, and as they
pass on, their Diameters grow still less
and less. The Celerity of the Motion
diminisheth by the encrease of the
Friction of the Fluid, against the
sides of the Tubes. Without this
Motion, both the Blood and the
Chyle, would be converted into one
solid Mass, but on the contrary by
the continuance of it, the Fluid be∣ing
compress'd by the sides, of the
Tube; especially in the small Ves∣sels,
where the Points of Contact
are more; the Blood and Chyle are
<PB N="35" REF="65"/>
still more intimately mix'd, and by
Attrition or Friction attenuated, by
which the mixture acquires a greater
Degree of Fluidity, and Similarity or
Homogenerety of Parts. Therefore,</P>
<P>1. Good Blood and a due Pro∣jectile
Motion or Circulation, are ne∣cessary
to convert the Aliment into
laudible Animal Juices.</P>
<P>2. The Strength of the Aliment
(by which I understand its Resistance
to the solid Parts) ought to be pro∣portion'd
to the Strength of the solid
parts, and as Animals that use a
great deal of Labour or Exercise,
have their solid Parts more elastick
and strong, they can bear and ought
to have stronger Food, too thin Nou∣rishment
being quickly dissipated by
the vigorous Action of the solid Parts.</P>
<P>3. The Defects of the first Con∣coction
are not to be mended by
the second; for if the Chyle passeth
into the Blood in a bad State, as the
force of Fibres, which contribute to
<PB N="36" REF="66"/>
the second Digestion is limited, it is
not sufficient to convert a Peccant
Liquor, into laudable Animal Juices.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. V.</HEAD>
<P>The Aliment as it circulates
through an Animal Body, is reduc'd
almost to an imperceptible tenuity, be∣fore
it can serve the Animal Purposes.</P>
<P>The Blood in live Animals, con∣sists
of red Globules, swimming
in a Serum or watery Liquor. The
smallest Vessels which carry the
Blood, or red Fluid by Lateral
Branches separate the next thinner
Fluid or Serum, the Diameters of
which Lateral Branches are less than
the Diameters of the Blood Vessels,
and will not in a healthy State ad∣mit
the red Fluid. Such may be
call'd Serous Arteries. Those Serous
Arteries emit Lateral Branches which
carry Lymph, a Liquor still more
Limpid than Serum, and from the
<PB N="37" REF="67"/>
Liquor which they carry may be
call'd Lymphatick Arteries, trans∣mitting
their Liquor into the Lym∣phatick
Veins, those Lymphatick
Arteries will not admit Serum. How
far this progression goes is not cer∣tain;
ten capillary Arteries in some
parts of the Body as in the Brain,
are not equal to one Hair, and the
smallest Lymphatick Vessels are a
hundred times smaller than the smal∣lest
Capillary Artery. What Mecha∣nism
is that which can attenuate a
Fluid compounded of the Ingredients
of Human Aliment, as Oil, Salts,
Earth, Water, so as to make it flow
freely through such Tubes?</P>
<P>1. Hence one can easily perceive
the inconveniency of Viscidity which
obstructs, and Acrimony that destroys
the Capillary Vessels.</P>
<P>2. Obstructions must be most
incident to such parts of the Body,
where the Circulation and the E∣lastick
force of the Fibres are both
<PB N="38" REF="68"/>
smallest, and those are the Glands
which are the extremities of Arte∣ries
form'd into Cylindrical Canals.</P>
<P>3. Hence too solid or viscous
Aliment is hurtful to scrophulous
Persons.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>The Fluids and Solids of an Animal
Body demand a constant Reparation.</P>
<P>An Animal in order to be
moveable must be flexible, and there∣fore
is fitly made of separate and
small solid Parts replete with proper
Fluids. The whole Body is nothing
but a System of such Canals, which
all communicate with one another,
mediately or immediately (for a Lym∣phatick
Vessel communicates with
the Artery, by the intermediate
Gland.) In this moveable Body the
fluid and solid Parts, must be con∣sum'd
by the Muscular Motion, and
the perpetual Flux of the Liquids;
<PB N="39" REF="69"/>
a great part of which are thrown
out of the Body by proper Emissa∣ries,
and the smaller Solids are like∣wise
rubb'd off, mix'd with the
Fluids, and in that form exhal'd.
Therefore both Fluids and Solids de∣mand
a constant Reparation.</P>
<P>1. The Quantity of Solids not
Morbid in an Animal Body is very
small, as appears by Atrophies, or
Decays; and likewise by Microscopes,
those Solids are entirely Nervous
and proceed from the Brain, and
Spinal Marrow, which by their bulk
appear sufficient to furnish all the
Stamina or Threads of the solid
Parts. The Solids are originally form'd
of a Fluid, from a small Point, as
appears by the gradual Formation
of a Foetus. The Solids and Fluids
differ, only in the degree of Cohe∣sion,
which being a little encreas'd
turns a Fluid into a Solid. How
the Fluids are repair'd has been
already explain'd. The Nutrition
<PB N="40" REF="70"/>
of the Solids is somewhat more ob∣scure.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>Nutrition of the Solids is per∣form'd
by the circulating Liquid in
a due degree of tenuity in the
smallest Vascular Solids.</P>
<P>The Fluids and Solids of an Ani∣mal
Body, are easily transmutable
into one another. The white of an
Egg (a Fluid resembling the Serum
of the Blood, and of which a whole
Animal is made) will coagulate and
turn Solid by a moderate Heat, and
the hardest of Animal Solids are re∣solvable
again into Gellys.</P>
<P>As the white of an Egg by Incu∣bation,
so can the Serum by the
action of the Fibres be still more
and more attenuated. A Fluid
moving through a flexible Canal,
when the Canal grows extremely
small and slender, by its Friction,
<PB N="41" REF="71"/>
will naturally lengthen, and as it
were Wire-draw, the Sides of the
Canal, according to the Direction
of its Axis, and as the Canal is leng∣then'd
or Wire-drawn, it grows still
smaller and slenderer so as that the
evanescent solid and fluid scarce dif∣fering,
the Extremities of these small
Canals will by Propulsion be carried
off with the Fluid continually, and
likewise continually repair'd and new
ones made in their room. The Force
of the Fluid will likewise separate the
smallest Particles which compose the
Fibres so as to leave vacant Intersti∣ces
in those Places where they co∣her'd
before, which vacant Places
will be again fill'd up by Particles
carried on by the succeeding Fluid
(as a Bank by the Mud of the Cur∣rent)
and which of course must be
reduced to that Figure which gives
the least Resistance to the Current,
and consequently must apply them∣selves
to the inward Surface of the
<PB N="42" REF="72"/>
Canal so as to preserve the Tube, the
System of Tubes that is the Animal
entire.</P>
<P>1. Those Tubes that are most re∣cently
made of Fluids are most fle∣xible
and most easily lengthen'd, such
Tubes as have often suffer'd this Force
grow rigid, and hardly more extendi∣ble
therefore.</P>
<P>2. An Animal the nearer to its
Original, the more it grows.</P>
<P>3. To this Motion of Elongation
of the Fibres is owing the Union
or Conglutination of the Parts of the
Body, when they are separated by a
Wound.</P>
<P>4. From the foregoing Doctrine
it is easy to explain the Formation
of the most solid Parts of the Body,
for when the Fluid moves in several
small Vessels, which by the Contact
of their Sides stop the Current of
the Fluid those Canals by degrees
are abolish'd and grow solid, several
of them united grow a Membrane,
<PB N="43" REF="73"/>
these Membranes further consolidated
become Cartilages, and Cartilages,
Bones; consequently, an Animal the
nearer it is to its Original, the more
Pipes it hath, and as it advanceth in
Age still the fewer. Many of our
Vessels degenerate into Ligaments the
very Sutures of the Skull are abolish'd
in old Age.</P>
<P>5. Many practical Rules may be
drawn from the foregoing Doctrine,
for the Diet of Human Creatures
according to their different States of
Life, and the Condition of the So∣lids,
it is evident that the Diet of
Infants ought to be extremely thin,
such as lengthens the Fibres without
Rupture; but in a young Animal,
when the Solids are too Lax (the
Case of rickety Children) the Diet
ought to be gently Astringent.</P>
<P>The Aliment likewise ought to be
different according to the State of
the Solids, in Animals full grown:
tho' an Animal arrives at its full
<PB N="44" REF="74"/>
Growth at a certain Age, perhaps it
never comes to its full Bulk, till the
last Period of Life. The <HI>Membra∣na
adiposa</HI> invests almost every Part
of the Body, so that there is hard∣ly
any Fibre, but is sheath'd with a
Part of it. This Membrane sepa∣rates
an oily Liquor call'd Fat, ne∣cessary
for many Purposes of Life;
when the Fibres are Lax, and the
Aliment too redundant, great part
of it is converted into this oily Li∣quor,
all the superfluous Weight of
an Animal beyond the Vessels, Bones
and Muscles is nothing but Fat; but
the Conversion of the Aliment into
Fat is not properly Nutrition, which
is a Reparation of the Solids and
Fluids, and Fat properly speaking is
neither. But I shall treat more par∣ticularly
of these Subjects in their
proper Place.</P>
<P>7. The Matter of Nutrition is
most subtile, and Nutrition the last
and most perfect Animal Action, to
<PB N="45" REF="75"/>
perform it by the foregoing Propo∣sitions,
there must be a due Degree
of projectile Motion, or Celerity of
Circulation to which Attrition and
Heat is proportional. The Heat e∣qual
to Incubation, is only nutri∣tious;
any thing less or more is in∣sufficient,
and the nutritious Juice it∣self
resembles the White of an Egg,
in all its Qualities. By too weak a
Circulation the Aliment approacheth
to these Qualities which it would ac∣quire
by a small Degree of Heat
without Motion, is viscous imper∣fectly
mix'd, and the Person in this
Condition is subject to all the Acci∣dents
of a <HI>Plethora,</HI> by too strong a
projectile Motion the Aliment tends
to Putrefaction is dissipated; and
the solid Parts instead of being re∣pair'd
are destroy'd. Hence may be
deduc'd the Force of Exercise in help∣ing
Digestion, and likewise the Rules
for regulating the Times and Degrees
of it. But those are foreign to my
Subject.</P>

<P>The frequent Repetition of Ali∣ment
is not only necessary for re∣pairing
the Fluids and Solids of an
Animal Body, but likewise to keep
the Fluids from the putrescent alka∣line
State, which they would ac∣quire,
by constant Motion, and At∣trition,
without being diluted, by a
fresh Emulsion of new Chyle.</P>
<P>An Animal that starves of Hunger
dies feverish, and delirious as appears
by Experiments upon Cats and Dogs,
for the most fluid Parts are dissipat∣ed,
what remains turns alkaline and
corrosive affecting the tender Fibres
of the Brain. The most severe Or∣ders

hot Eructations and Head-Aches.
Long Abstinence does not kill by
want of Blood, for twenty Days fast∣ing

much as one great Hoemorage. An
Animal can never dye for want of
Blood, while there is a quantity suf∣ficient
for the continuity of the Pres∣sure,
it makes, so apply'd to the

Besides the Diminution both of the
Fluids and Solids in an Atrophy, is
much greater than what can happen
by being starv'd. Therefore fasting
kills by the bad State, not by the
insufficient quantity of Fluids.</P>

Spirit-Water, Salt, Oil, Earth; all
which are contain'd in the Sap, they
derive from the Earth, which con∣sists
of Rain-Water, Air, putrified
juices of Plants, and Animals; and
even Minerals for the Ashes of Plants
yield something which the Loadstone
attracts. Plants are either eat raw,
or prepar'd by the Arts of Cookery.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>The Sap is diversify'd, and still
more and more elaborated and ex∣alted
as it circulates through the Ves∣sels
of the Plant.</P>
<P>The Sap when it first enters the
Root, and is not subdued by the Ac∣tion
of the Plant retains much of its
own Nature, and has not much of the
Vegetable; being earthy, watery, poor,
and scarce oleaginous. The Sap after
it has enter'd the Root is more and
<PB N="50" REF="80"/>
more elaborated as it passeth into the
Stem, Branches, Leaves, Flowers, Fruit
and Seeds. The Juice of the Stem is
like the Chyle in an Animal Body,
not sufficiently concocted by Circu∣lation,
and is commonly subacid in
all Plants. This Juice is yielded in
great Plenty by Incision in some
Plants. The Juices of the Leaves are,
<HI>First,</HI> That obtain'd by Expression
which is the nutritious Juice ren∣der'd
somewhat more oleaginous;
from this Juice proceeds the diffe∣rence
of the Taste of the Leaves
of Plants. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Wax which is
scrap'd off by the Bees and is a ve∣getable
Substance. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Manna
which is an essential Sacharine Salt
sweating from the Leaves of most
Plants.</P>
<P>The Juices of the Flowers are,
<HI>First,</HI> The express'd Juice a little
more elaborated. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A vola∣tile
Oil and Spirit wherein the par∣ticular
Smell of the Plant resides.
<PB N="51" REF="81"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Honey exuding from all
Flowers the Bitter not excepted, this
is gather'd by the Bees, and suck'd
in by their Trunks into their Sto∣machs.
The Juice of the Fruit is
still the Juice of the Plant more ela∣borated.
The Juice of the Seed is
an essential Oil or Balm design'd by
Nature to preserve the Seed from
Corruption. The Bark contains be∣sides
the common Juice, an oily
Juice which sweats out of divers
Plants, when this Juice is in greater
Plenty than can be exhal'd by the Sun,
it renders the Plant ever Green. This
Oil farther inspissated by Evaporati∣on
turns by degrees into Balm, Pitch,
Rosin, &amp;c. Besides all these there
is a peculiar Juice in each Species
not reduceable to Water, Oils, Bal∣sam,
which may be call'd the Blood
of the Plant. Thus some Plants up∣on
breaking their Vessels yield a
milky Juice; others a Yellow of pe∣culiar
Tastes and Qualities.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="82"/>
1. Hence it follows, that he who
eats a whole raw Plant, or the ex∣press'd
Juice of it, takes in a greater
Variety of Substances, than he who
feeds on the same Plant prepar'd or
on some of the Parts of it, for all
Plants have the most of the fore∣mention'd
Ingredients, at least in
small Quantities.</P>
<P>2. Vegetables differ from Fossils,
and Animals in that being burnt to
Ashes they yield a fix'd Alkaline Salt
which in those of a sharp Scent, as
Mustard, Onions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is in a very
small Quantity.</P>
<P>3. The Effects of vegetable Sub∣stances
upon Human Bodies are more
Various than these of Animal Sub∣stances;
and the Mechanism of
Plants seems to be more various than
that of Animals, for the, same Plant
produceth as great a variety of Juices
as there is in the same Animal, and
the different Plants a greater Varie∣ty,
and yet the Aliment of Plants is
<PB N="53" REF="83"/>
one uniform Juice; for from the
same Soil may be produc'd a great
variety of Plants, whereas different
Species of Animals live upon very
different sorts of Substances; both
Mechanisms are equally curious, from
one uniform Juice to extract all the
variety of vegetable Juices, or from
such variety of Food to make a Fluid
very near uniform, the Blood of an
Animal.</P>
<P>4. The specifick Qualities of Plants
reside in their native Spirit, Oil and
essential Salt; for the Water, fix'd
Salt and Earth appear to be the same
in all Plants.</P>
<P>The Effects of the foremention'd
Ingredients of Plants are as follows,
Vegetable Salts are capable of resolv∣ing
the coagulated Humours of a
Human Body, and of attenuating,
by stimulating the Solids and dis∣solving
the Fluids: Salts likewise pro∣mote
Secretions, Oils relax the Fibres,
are Lenient, Balsamick, and abate
<PB N="54" REF="84"/>
Acrimony in the Blood. It is by
Virtue of this Oil, that Vegetables
are nutrimental, for this Oil is ex∣tracted
by Animal Digestion as an
Emulsion, and abounds most in
Plants of full Growth, and when the
Salts and Water are in least abun∣dance.
Aromatick Plants tho' they
abound with Oil, yet it is not soft
and nutritious, but as it is mix'd with
a Spirit, is too heating.</P>
<P>The Volatile Salt and Spirit of
Vegetables is penetrating, heating
and active, contrary to the Proper∣ties
of Acids. The Balsams of Plants
contain a Volatile Salt, such Balsams
when depriv'd of their Acids change
into Oils. Wax consists of an acid
Spirit of a nauseous Taste, and an
Oil or Butter which appears white.
This Oil is Emollient, Laxative and
Anodyne.</P>
<P>Honey is the most elaborate Pro∣duction
of the Vegetable Kind, be∣ing
a most exquisite vegetable Soap,
<PB N="55" REF="85"/>
resolvent of the Bile, Balsamick and
Pectoral. Honey contains no in∣flammable
Spirit before it has felt
the Force of Fermentation, for the
Distillation of it affords nothing that
will burn in the Fire.</P>
<P>The Fruits of most Vegetables are
likewise Soaps, all Soaps (which are
a Mixture of Salt and Oil) are at∣tenuating
and deobstruent resolving
viscid Substances; for meer Water
dissolves nothing but Salts: but as
the Substance of Coagulations is not
merely Saline, nothing dissolves them
but what penetrates and relaxes at
the same time, that is a Soap or
a Mixture of Oil and Salt.</P>
<P>6. Tastes are the Indexes of the
different Qualities of Plants as well
as of all sorts of Aliment: Different
Tastes proceed from different Mix∣tures
of Water, Earth, Oil and Salt,
but chiefly from the Oil and Spirit
mix'd with some Salt of a peculiar
Nature. A Muriatick or Briny Taste
<PB N="56" REF="86"/>
seems to be produced by a Mixture
of an acid and alkaline Salt, for Spi∣rit
of Salt and Salt Tartar mix'd, pro∣duce
a Salt like Sea Salt. Bitter and
acrid differ only by the sharp Parti∣cles
of the first, being involv'd in a
greater quantity of Oil than those
of the last. Acid or sowr proceeds
from a Salt of the same Nature With∣out
a Mixture of Oil; in austere
Tastes the oily Parts have not disen∣tangled
themselves from the Salts, and
earthy Parts, such is the Taste of un∣ripe
Fruits. In sweet Tastes, the a∣cid
Particles seem to be so atte∣nuated,
and dissolv'd in the Oil, as
to produce only a small and grate∣ful
Titillation. In oily Tastes, the
Salts seem to be intirely disentan∣gled.</P>
<P>Vegetables have very different Ef∣fects
on Human Bodies as they con∣tain
acid or alkaline Salts, and are
to be us'd according to the different
Constitution of the Body at that
<PB N="57" REF="87"/>
time, as will appear by what will be
said afterwards. All the Tetrapeta∣lous
siliquose Plants are Alkalescent.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>Mankind take as Aliment all the
parts of Vegetables, but their proper∣est
Food of the Vegetable King∣dom
is taken from the Farinaceous,
or mealy Seeds of some Culmiferous
Plants, as Oats, Barley, Wheat,
Rice, Rye, Maes, Panick Millet;
or of some of the siliquose legumi∣nous,
as Pease, Beans, &amp;c. Those
as they are Seeds (by what was said,
Prop. III.) contain the most elabo∣rate
part of the Plant, are oily, and
therefore proper to make the Ani∣mal
Emulsion of Chyle, and their
Oil is not highly exalted, and hot
as that of Acrid and Aromatical
Plants, but mild and benign to hu∣man
Bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="88"/>
Barley is Emollient, moistning
and expectorating. Oats have some
of the same qualities. Barley was
chosen by <HI>Hippocrates</HI> as proper Food
in inflammatory Distempers. Rice is
the Food of perhaps two thirds of
Mankind, it is most kindly and be∣nign
to human Constitutions, pro∣per
for the Consumptive, and such
as are subject to Haemorages, next
to Rice is Wheat, the Bran of which
is highly Acescent and Stimulating.
Therefore the Bread that is not too
much purged from it is more whole∣some
for some Constitutions; Rye
is more Acid, Laxative and less
nourishing than Wheat; Millet is
diraetick, deterging and useful in
Diseases of the Kidneys. Panick af∣fords
a soft Demulcent Nourishment
both for Granivorous Birds, and Man∣kind.
Mays affords a very strong
Nourishment, but more viscous than
Wheat. Pease being depriv'd of any
Aromatick parts are mild, and de∣mulcent
<PB N="59" REF="89"/>
in the highest degree; but
being full of Aerial Particles are fla∣tulent,
when dissolv'd by Digestion.
Beans resemble them in most of their
qualities. All the foremention'd
Plants are highly acescent except Pease
and Beans.</P>
<P>The mealy parts of the foremen∣tion'd
Plants dissolv'd in Water,
make too viscid an Aliment to be
constantly us'd, and justly condemn'd
by <HI>Hippocrates.</HI> Therefore Mankind
have found the means to make them
more easy of Digestion by ferment∣ing,
and making some of them into
Bread, which is the lightest and pro∣perest
Aliment for human Bodies,
Leaven by its Acid Salt, dividing the
Mucous and oily parts of the Meal.</P>
<P>The next sort of Substances which
Mankind feed on, are Fruits of Trees,
and Shrubs, these all contain Water
or Flegm, a great Quantity of Oil,
much elaborated, and an essential
Salt, upon the different mixtures of
<PB N="60" REF="90"/>
these Ingredients, depend their diffe∣rent
Qualities, by which they are
sharp, sweet, sow'r or Styptick. Of
Fruits some are Pulpy, others contain'd
within a hard Shell, which last are
indeed the Seeds of the Plants, to
which they belong, and contain a
great deal of Oil, entangled with
Earthly Parts and Salts, which often∣times
make them hard of Digestion,
and pass the Alimentary Duct un∣dissolv'd.
There are other Fruits
which contain a great deal of cooling
viscid Juice, combin'd with a Ni∣trous
Salt, which sometimes makes
them offensive to the Stomach; such
are many of the low Pomiferous kind,
as Cucumbers, Pompions, tho' a∣mongst
those, Melons when good,
have a rich Juice, and somewhat A∣romatick;
they are Diuretick, and
there are instances of their having
thrown People into bloody Urine.</P>
<P>Of Alimentary Leaves, the O∣lera
or Pot Herbs afford an excel∣lent
<PB N="61" REF="91"/>
Nourishment, amongst those are
the Cole or Cabbage kind, Emol∣lient,
Laxative, and resolvent Alka∣lescent,
and therefore proper in cases
of Acidity. Red Cabbage is reckon'd
a Medicine in Consumptions and
spittings of Blood. Amongst the
Pot Herbs are some Lactescent Pa∣pescent
Plants, as Lettuce, and En∣dive,
which contain a most whole∣some
Juice, resolvent of the Bile,
Anodyne and Cooling, extremely
useful in all Diseases of the Liver.
Artichokes contain a rich Nutritious
Stimulating Juice.</P>
<P>Of the Stems of Plants, some
contain a sine Aperient Salt, and
are Diaretick and Saponaceous, as
Asparagus which affects the Urine
with a Fetid Smell (especially if cut
when they are White) and therefore
have been suspected by some Physi∣cians
as not friendly to the Kidneys,
when they are older and begin to
ramify they lose this quality.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="92"/>
Of Alimentary Roots, some are
Pulpy, and very Nutritious, as Tur∣neps,
Carrots, these have a fattening
Quality, which they manifest in feed∣ing
of Cattle. There are other Roots
which contain an Acrid Volatile Salt,
as Onions, Garlick, Leeks, Ra∣dishes,
the mildest of these is Selery.
Those sorts of Roots are Alkalescent
and heating; and therefore proper in
cases of Acidity. The Fungus kind,
as Mushrooms, Truffles afford an
Alkaline Salt, and much Oil, some
of them being poisonous make the
others suspicious if taken in too great
Quantities.</P>
<P>There are many Vegetable Sub∣stances
us'd by Mankind, as season∣ings,
which abound with a highly
exalted Aromatick Oil, as Thyme,
Savoury, and all Spices. Those are
heating and the most of them
hard of Digestion. The most
friendly to the Stomach, is Fennel:
Mustard, which is us'd in Seasoning
<PB N="63" REF="93"/>
abounds with a most Pungent Salt
and Oil, extremely active, and heat∣ing.
Sugar is an essential Salt of a
Plant combin'd with an Oil, which
renders it Inflammable.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. V.</HEAD>
<P>To give an Account of the In∣gredients
into which Vegetables re∣solve
themselves by the most simple O∣perations
of Cookery and Chymistry.</P>
<P>The Operations of Cookery
and Chymistry fall much short of
the, vital force of an Animal. Body,
no Chymist can make Milk or Blood
of Grass, yet it gives some light to
this Subject, to show into what Parts
Vegetables resolve themselves by such
Simple Operations, as barely sepa∣rate
their Parts without confounding
or destroying them.</P>
<P>The two Operations already men∣tion'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> making an Emulsion
and Vegetable Putrefaction resemble
Animal Digestion the most.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="94"/>
1. In making an Emulsion, the
oily Parts of Vegetables dissolve in∣to
a white Liquor, resembling Chyle.
Our Vegetable Food consists of mealy
Seeds, Fruits, Bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon which
the Teeth and Jaws act as the Pestle
and Mortar, the Spittle, Bile, Pancrea∣tick
Juice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> art the Men∣struum
instead of the Water, which
the Chymist employs, the Stomach
and Intestines are the Press, and the
Lacteal Vessels the Strainers, to se∣parate
the pure Emulsion from its
Foeces. The Chyle is white, as con∣sisting
of Salt, Oil, and Water of
our Food, much levigated or smooth.
This likewise constitutes the white∣ness
of Emulsions.</P>
<P>2. Vegetable Putrefaction (by
what has been mention'd before)
turns Vegetable Substances into an
Animal Nature.</P>
<P>3. Amongst the Ingredients of
Vegetables that which constitutes the
most spiritous and fragrant part of
<PB N="65" REF="95"/>
the Plant, is what passeth by Per∣spiration,
and exhales by the action
of the Sun. This is as it were the
presiding Spirit of the Plant, from
which it draws its peculiar flavour,
and is the most active Principle in
the Vegetable. Thus every Plant has
its Atmosphere, which have very
various effects on these who stay
near them, producing Head Achs,
Sleep, Fainting, Vapours; and o∣thers,
a great refreshment of the Spi∣rits.
It is reported, that in <HI>Brazil</HI>
there are Trees which kill those that
sit under their shade in a few Hours.
This fragrant Spirit is obtain'd from
all Plants which are in the least Aro∣matick,
by a cold Still, with a heat
not exceeding that of Summer.</P>
<P>4. If to a Plant you pour hot Wa∣ter,
and let it stand a sufficient time,
the Liquor strain'd is call'd the infu∣sion
of the Plant, if the Plant be boil'd
in the same Water, the strain'd Li∣quor
is call'd the Decoction of the
<PB N="66" REF="96"/>
Plant. The Infusions and Decoctions
of Plants contain the most separable
parts of the Plants, and convey not
only their Nutritious but Medicinal
Qualities into the Blood. This is
plain by many Experiments. The
Infusion of <HI>Cassia Fistularis</HI> makes the
Urine Green. The Infusions and De∣coctions
of Rhubarb, and Saffron
will in a quarter of an Hour tinge
the Urine with a high Yellow.</P>
<P>5. The most oily parts are not
separated by a slight Decoction, till
they are disentangl'd from the Salts,
for if what remains of the Subject
after the Infusion and Decoction, be
continu'd to be boil'd down with
the addition of fresh Water, a fat
sapid odorous viscous inflammable
frothy Water will constantly be found
floating a top of the boiling Liquor,
which being scumm'd off and gently
dry'd, will flame away in the Fire.
This Liquor is a kind of Soap consi∣sting
of the Oil and Salt of the Plant.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="97"/>
6. Infusions and slight De∣coctions
contain more of the Speci∣fick
Qualities of the Plant than these
which are more violent, for by a
strong Decoction some part of the
Taste and Smell fly off every Mo∣ment.</P>
<P>7. The Infusion and Decocti∣on
prepar'd as before being evapo∣rated
to a thicker Consistence, ac∣cording
to the several Degrees of
Thickness passeth into a Jelly, Defru∣tum,
sapa Rob extract which contain
all the virtues of the Infusion or De∣coction
freed only from some of the
watery parts.</P>
<P>8. The utmost force of boiling
Water is not able to destroy the
structure of the tenderest Plant. The
Lineaments of a White Lily will re∣main
after the strongest Decoction.</P>
<P>9. The Extract obtain'd by the
former Operation burnt to Ashes,
and those Ashes boil'd in Water, and
filtrated, yield a fiery Salt.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="98"/>
10. The greater Quantity of vo∣latile
Salt any Plant contains, which
is the case of the more pungent in
Taste, and Odour, the less it affords
of this fixt Alkali: Those fix'd Al∣kaline
Salts do not preexist in the
same form in the Plant, for Acid
Plants as Sorel will afford by this O∣peration,
an Alkaline Salt. Those
Salts grow still more fiery and
Alkaline by a greater degree of Heat.
Of all the Essential Salts of Plants,
that which is in most common use
in Aliment, is Sugar, which rather
dissolves Flegm, than increaseth it;
fot it grows tenacious only by long
boiling, it is a Sal Oleosum, for
it is both soluble in Water, and fu∣sible
in Fire.</P>
<P>11. Another manner of preparing
Vegetables is by expressing their
Juices. Those express'd Juices, con∣tain
the true Essential Salt of the
Plant, for if they be boil'd into the
consistence of a Syrup, and fet in a
<PB N="69" REF="99"/>
cool place; the Essential Salt of the
Plant will shoot upon the sides of
the Vessels. Those Essential Salts of
Plants differ according to the Plant
unto which they belong, but are re∣duc'd
into three Classes. <HI>First,</HI> Those
of Acid Astringent, Austere Vege∣tables
as of unripe Fruits which re∣semble
the Tartar. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Those
of succulent watery Plants, as En∣dive,
Cichory which afford a fine
nitrous kind of Salt soluble in Wa∣ter,
and very cooling. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Those
from oily Aromatick and odorife∣rous
Vegetables, which will hardly
afford any till their Oils be extract∣ed
from them: feom hence it ap∣pears
that the express'd Juices of Ve∣getables
not filtrated very clear con∣tain
their whole Specifick Virtues.</P>
<P>12. In the preparations of Coo∣kery
the most volatile parts of Ve∣getables
are destroy'd; if any of them
are retain'd it is in Decoctions which
are made in Balneo.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="100"/>
Decoctions, when we take the Li∣quor,
contain the Specifick Virtues
of the Plants, when we feed upon
the Plant it makes their solid parts
more tender, and deprives them of
a great deal of their more subtile
Oils.</P>
<P>13. The vascular and solid parts
of Plants are incapable of any change
in the Animal Body, for the remain∣der
of a strong Decoction held over
a clear Fire will burn to Ashes,
which is true Elementary Earth.
The fibrous and solid parts of Plants,
pass unalter'd through the Intestines,
and sometimes by sticking there oc∣casion
great disorders. Grains and
Nuts pass often through Animals
unalter'd. The Excrements of Horses
are nothing but Hay, and as such
combustible.</P>
<P>14. Vegetable Substances contain
a great deal of Air, which as they
are dissolv'd in the Alimentary Duct
expands itself, producing all the dis∣orders
of Flatulency.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="101"/>
15. There are other Preparations
of Vegetables by Fermentation,
whereby they are wrought up into
spirituous Liquors, which may be call'd
by the general name of Wines. Such
fermented Liquors have quite diffe∣rent
qualities from the Plant itself,
for no Fruit taken Crude has the
intoxicating Quality of Wine.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Observations from the nature and most
simple Analysis of Animal Sub∣stances.</HEAD>
<P>AN Animal consider'd in its
material part, cannot well be
defin'd from any particular origanical
part, which in some species are want∣ing,
in others are more than one,
nor from its locomotive Faculty;
for there are some which adhere to
Rocks, and other places. The. Cha∣racteristick
<PB N="72" REF="102"/>
of an Animal is to take
its Aliment by a voluntary action,
by some aperture of the Body,
which may be call'd a Mouth, and
to convey it into another call'd the
Intestines, into which its Roots are
implanted, whereby it draws its
Nourishment much after the manner
of Vegetables, only a Vegetable has
its Root planted without itself, and
an Animal its Root within its self.
A Foetus in the Womb is indeed
nourish'd like a Plant, but after∣wards
by a Root planted within
itself, perhaps too an Animal may
be distinguish'd from a Vegetable in
that its Juices move through the Ca∣nals
by a projectile Motion.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. I.</HEAD>
<P>To give a short account of the con∣stituent
Parts of Animal Substances.</P>
<P>An Animal consists of solid and fluid
Parts, unless one should reckon some
<PB N="73" REF="103"/>
of an intermediate nature as Fat and
Flegm.</P>
<P>1. The solids sèem to be Earth
bound together with some Oil, for
if a Bone be calcin'd so, as the least
force will crumble it, being im∣mers'd
in Oil it will grow firm
again.</P>
<P>The last Animal Solids are Earth
in its greatest Simplicity, for the
Chymists make Vessels of Animal
Substances calcin'd, which will not
vitrify in the Fire; for all Earth which
hath any Salt or Oil in it, will turn
to Glass.</P>
<P>2. The Fluids of Animals are
more crude, and resemble those of
Vegetables, as they are nearer the
Root of the Animal. Thus Chyle
may be said to be a, vegetable Juice
in the Stomach and Intestines, and
pour'd upon Blood it seems like Oil;
as it passeth into the Lacteals it
grows still more Animal, and when
it has circulated often with the Blood,
it is entirely so.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="104"/>
3. Blood is the most universal
Juice in an Animal Body, and from
which all the rest are deriv'd, the red
part of it differs from the Serum, the
Serum from the Lymph, the Lymph
from the nervous Juice, and that
from the several other Humours that
are separated in the Glands.</P>
<P>4. Animal Substances differ from
Vegetable in two Things. <HI>First,</HI> In
that being reduc'd to Ashes they are
perfectly insipid, all Animal Salts
being volatile, flying off with great
Heat. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In that there is no
sincere Acid in any Animal Juice.</P>
<P>5. And yet the Parts of the one
are transmutable into the nutritious
Juice of the other. An Animal can
nourish a Plant, and a Plant an Ani∣mal,
by which it seems probable that
Vegetables have the Power of con∣verting
the alkaline Juices of Ani∣mals
into Acids. From the two
foremention'd Differences of Vegeta∣ble
and Animal Substances follows,
<PB N="75" REF="105"/>
<HI>First,</HI> That all Animal Diet is alka∣lescent,
or anti-acid. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
Animal Substances containing no fixt
Salt, want the assistance of those for
Digestion, which preserve them both
within and without the Body from
Putrefaction.</P>
<P>6. The constituent Parts of Ani∣mals
are, <HI>First,</HI> Earth. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A
peculiar Spirit analogous to that of
Plants. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Water. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Salts.
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> Oil.</P>
<P>7. The Earth as was before ob∣serv'd
is sincere, and immutable.</P>
<P>8. The Spirit is an oily Substance
so attenuated as to become volatile.
This Spirit seems to be distinguish'd
in every Species, and Individual; a
Blood-Hound will follow the Tract
of the Person he pursues, and all
Hounds the particular Game they
have in Chase, and the Faculty by
which they distinguish particular Men
seems to be analogous to ours of dis∣tinguishing
the different Species of
Vegetables by their Scent.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="106"/>
9. Therefore, since the Animals
of the wild kind have their Scent,
and consequently this presiding Spi∣rit
more high, it is probable that
their Juices are more exalted in Pro∣portion.</P>
<P>10. Water is the chief Ingredient
in all the Animal Fluids and Solids;
for a dry Bone distill'd affords a great
quantity of insipid Water. There∣fore
Water seems to be proper Drink
for every sort of Animal.</P>
<P>11. The Juices of Animals con∣sist
of Water impregnated with Salts
of a peculiar Nature (excepting
Chyle which as was said before may
be reputed a vegetable Juice, and
often contain Acids) These Salts are
neither acid, nor perfectly volatile;
for in the Evaporation of Human
Blood by a gentle Fire the Salt will
not rise, but only the Spirit, and
Water, not perfectly fix'd; for Hu∣man
Blood calcin'd yields no fix'd
Salt, nor is it a <HI>Sal Ammoniac;</HI> for
<PB N="77" REF="107"/>
that remains immutable after repeat∣ed
Distillations; and Distillation de∣stroys
the ammoniacal Quality of
Animal Salts, and turns them alka∣line,
so that it is a Salt neither quite
fix'd, nor quite volatile, nor quite
acid, nor quite alkaline, nor quite
ammoniacal, but soft and benign,
approaching nearest to the Nature of
a <HI>Sal Ammoniac.</HI> The elementary
Salts of Animals are not the same, as
they appear by Distillation; these
Alterations being made by Fire. Those
Salts are of a peculiar benign mild
Nature in healthy Persons who have
a vital Force to subdue all the sapid
Substances which they feed upon, but
in such who have not that vital Force,
or commit some Error in their Diet,
these Salts are not sufficiently atte∣nuated,
and retain their original Qua∣lities,
which they discover in Cahe∣xies,
Scurvies of several kinds and
other Distempers. The Cure of which
chiefly lies in the choice of Aliment
<PB N="78" REF="108"/>
with Qualities opposite to the Na∣ture
of these Salts.</P>
<P>12. Animal Oil is various accord∣ing
to Principles inherent in it, but
being freed from the Earth, Salts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
it is a simple unactive principle, and
the same in all Animals.</P>
<P>13. Animal Substances are more
easily assimulated into Animal Sub∣stances,
and therefore it seems pro∣bable
that they are more nourishing
to Human Bodies than Vegetable.</P>
<P>The Nature of Animal Food must
depend upon the Nature, Age, Diet,
and other Circumstances of the Ani∣mal
we feed upon.</P>
<P>Animal Juices as well as Vegetable
are in their greatest Perfection when
the Animal is full grown; young A∣nimals
participate of the Nature of
their tender Aliment, as Sucklings of
Milk.</P>
<P>Animal Nourishment differs con∣siderably
as the Animal is terrestrial,
amphibious, or aquatick. Fishes con∣tain
<PB N="79" REF="109"/>
more of Animal Salts and Oil,
for they corrupt sooner than terres∣trial
Animals, some Fishes as the
Thornback when dry'd, taste of <HI>Sal
Ammoniac.</HI></P>
<P>The muscular Fibres of Fishes are
generally more small and tender than
those of terrestrial Animals, and their
whole Substance more watery. Some
Fishes as Whitings, can be almost
entirely dissolv'd into Water.</P>
<P>From which Qualities a Diet of
Fish is more rich and alkalesccnt than
that of Flesh, and therefore very im∣proper
for such as practise Mortifi∣cation.
The Inhabitants of Sea-Port
Towns are generally prolifick.</P>
<P>The Oils with which Fishes a∣bound
often turn rancid, and lie hea∣vy
on the Stomach, and effect the
very Sweat with a rancid Smell, which
is found to be true in some Places
where the Inhabitants live entirely
upon Fish.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="110"/>
Notwithstanding the redundant
Oil in Fishes they do not increase
Fat so much as Flesh, by reason of
their watery Quality.</P>
<P>Water-Fowl abound with the same
rancid Oil as Fish.</P>
<P>Fish being highly alkalescent, wants
to be qualified by Salt and Vinegar.</P>
<P>14. Another Difference of the Flesh
of Animals depends upon the diffe∣rence
of their Food, from which it
is not hard to determine their Qua∣lities
consider'd as Aliment. Those
Animals that live upon other Ani∣mals
have their Flesh and Juices more
alkalescent, than those that live upon
Vegetables.</P>
<P>15. The difference of the Quali∣ties
of the Flesh of the same Species,
depends upon the manner of living
of the Animal.</P>
<P>Abstracting from other Conside∣rations,
the most healthy Animal
affords the best Aliment, and the
castrated; than those that are not so.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="111"/>
An Animal that feeds itself takes
the most proper Food, in the pro∣perest
Quantities (if it has plenty
enough) has better Air, and more
Exercise, all which contribute to
make the Animal more healthy; for
these Reasons <HI>Hippocrates</HI> commends
the Flesh of the wild Sow above the
tame. The wild Kinds of Animals
having more Exercise, have their Jui∣ces
more elaborated and exalted; but
for the same Reason the Fibres are
harder, especially when old. For this
Reason perhaps the Roe-Buck is the
finest of the Venison Kind. This
Rule in some measure holds true with
Fishes; Sea-Fish living in an Ele∣ment
more agitated, and River-Fish
are better than those in Ponds.</P>
<P>Eels for want of Exercise are fat
and slimy, for this Reason perhaps
Fish without Fins and Scales were for∣bid
the <HI>Israelites.</HI></P>
<P>As the Fibres of fat Animals are
often more tender and moist than
<PB N="82" REF="112"/>
those of lean, they are more coveted
by Mankind, and tame Fowls of∣fering
themselves as it were to Man∣kind,
seem to be their natural Food.</P>
<P>16. The Juices of the same Ani∣mal
in Decoctions are often more
nourishing, when the solid Parts are
not so good, and the Broth made
of grown Animals more nourishing
than that of young; for of the Parts
of the same Animal the muscular
Flesh with the nervous Parts, afford
the best Nourishment as containing
the most spirituous Parts. The dif∣ference
of the muscular Flesh taken
in Substance depends upon the Hard∣ness,
Tenderness, Moisture or Dry∣ness
of the Fibres. The Glands dif∣fer
according to the particular Juices
which they separate from the Blood.
Of all the Glands the Livers are the
most corruptible. Stall-fed Oxen
and cramm'd Fowls are often diseas'd
in their Livers.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>To give an Account of the Na∣ture
and most simple Analysis of A∣nimal
Fluids and Solids.</P>
<P>The properest Subjects for such
an Enquiry are, <HI>First,</HI> The Fluid which
begins to receive an Animal Nature
without having perfectly attain'd to
it, and approaches nearest to the
Nature of Chyle, <HI>viz.</HI> Milk. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
That which having attain'd
an Animal Nature by Circulation is
noxious if retain'd in the Animal; U∣rine.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> An Animal Fluid no
ways excrementitious, mild, elabo∣rated
and nutritious, and from which
every part of a perfect Animal can
be form'd; the White of an Egg.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> The nutritious Juice of a
healthy Human Body which resem∣bles
the White of an Egg in most
of its Qualities. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> The Bones.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="114"/>
1. None of the Animal Fluids a∣bove
mention'd, in a sound State is
either acid or alkaline. <HI>First,</HI> If to
any quantity of warm new Milk you
pour Oil of Tartar <HI>per deliquium,</HI> or
any other Alkali, no Effervescence
will follow, but the whole Body of
the Liquor will remain at rest, though
it appear somewhat thinner. To
another Quantity of warm Milk pour
Spirit of Nitre, or any strong Acid,
and again no Motion nor Ebullition
will appear, only the Milk presently
after will become thicker than it was;
mix together the two Parcels of Milk,
upon which the Experiments were
made, and a great Effervescence will
immediately arise; from whence the
Proposition is evident, that Milk is
neither an Acid nor Alkali, but when
there is an Acid and Alkali mix'd in
it, they manifest themselves by their
Conflict: Milk doth not discover it∣self
to be Acid or Alkaline by Trials
with the Syrup of Violets.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="115"/>
The same Experiments hold in
two Parcels of the Urine of a heal∣thy
Person before it has stood twelve
Hours.</P>
<P>The same Experiments succeed on
two Parcels of a White of an Egg,
only it grows somewhat thicker up∣on
mixing with an acid. The Serum
of the Blood stands the same Trials
of Acids and Alkalis.</P>
<P>2. The Milks of several Animals
differ but very little as to their sensi∣ble
Qualities; Womens Milk is the
sweetest, as to their nutritious Quali∣ties
they seem to stand in the fol∣lowing
Order. That of Women,
Asses, Mares, Goats, Sheeps, Cows.
The Milk of Animals which make
hard Dung is most nourishing.</P>
<P>3. Milk standing some time, na∣turally
separates into an oily Liquor,
call'd Cream, and a thinner, blue
and more ponderous Liquor, call'd
skimm'd Milk, neither of which Parts
is naturally acid or alkaline (but may
<PB N="86" REF="116"/>
turn so by standing for some time)
nor in the least acrimonious, for be∣ing
let fall into the Eye they cause
no Pain or Sensation of Sharpness.
Milk is a kind of Emulsion, or white
Animal Liquor resembling Chyle pre∣pared
chiefly from Vegetables, and
after it has been mix'd with the Ani∣mal
Juices of the Saliva, Bile, pan∣creatick
Juice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is easily separated
from them again in the Breasts.</P>
<P>4. It differs from a vegetable E∣mulsion
by coagulating into a curdy
Mass with Acids, which Chyle and
vegetable Emulsions will not: Acids
mix'd with them precipitate a to∣phaceous
chalky Matter, but not a
chyly Substance; for as was before
observ'd, if you pour Spirit of Nitre
into any Quantity of boiling new
Milk, and no Conflict or Efferves∣cence
will follow, but the Liquor di∣vides
itself into Curd and Whey,
which Whey turns spontaneously a∣cid,
and the Curd will turn into
<PB N="87" REF="117"/>
Cheese as hard as a Stone; which
shows that the most solid Parts of
Animals may be made of Milk. The
same Effect of turning Milk into a
hard Curd, may happen in a Human
Body that abounds with Acids.</P>
<P>5. Milk drawn from a sound Ani∣mal
fed on Vegetables, standing in
a Heat equal to that of a Man in
Health, will soon separate itself into
a Cream, and a more serous and
ponderous Liquor, which after twelve
Days attains to the highest Degree
of Acidity. But if the Milk be
drawn from some Animals that feed
only upon Flesh, that have fast'd
long, are feverish, or have under∣gone
hard Labour, it will be more
apt to turn rancid and putrify than
turn acid, acquiring first a saline
Taste which is a Sign of Putrefacti∣on,
and then it will turn into an
Ichor.</P>
<P>6. If to a quantity of boiling
new Milk you add by Degrees any
<PB N="88" REF="118"/>
fix'd Alkali, as Salt of Tartar, or
Oil of Tartar <HI>per deliquium,</HI> there
will be a lighter <HI>Coagulum</HI> form'd than
by an acid. The Milk by boiling
will change into a yellow Colour,
and run through all the intermediate
Degrees, till it stops in an intense
red. The same thing happens by
the alkaline Powers of the Body; for
when an Animal that gives Suck
turns feverish, that is, its Juices more
alkaline, the Milk turns from its na∣tive
genuine Whiteness to Yellow;
to which the Suckling has an Aver∣sion:
This was the Case (as the
learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> tells us) of the
Cows of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>7. If a Nurse should abstain from
all acid Vegetables, from Wine,
Malt-Drink, and feed only on Flesh,
and drink Water, her Milk instead
of turning sour will turn putrid, and
smell like Urine. An alkalescent
Diet except that of Water is often
the Case of Nurses in great Fami∣lies.
<PB N="89" REF="119"/>
Their Milk subjects the Child
to Fevers; on the other Hand the
Milk of poor People that feed upon
an Acescent Vegetable Diet, subjects
the Child to Diseases, that depend
upon Acidity in the Bowels, as
Cholick: The Symptoms of such a
Constitution are a sour Smell in
the Faces, sour Belchings, 'Disten∣sions
of the Bowels, and Paleness of
the Flesh. The Cure of both Dis∣eases
is effected by a change of Diet
in the Nurse from Alkalescent to
Acescent or contrary ways as the case
requires. The best Diet for Nurses is
a Mixture of both.</P>
<P>It follows likewise from the forego∣ing
Observations, that no Nurse should
give Suck after twelve Hours fasting,
and that a tendency to Yellow, is an
early Sign of a Fever in the Nurse.</P>
<P>8. Recent Urine as it is neither
Acid, nor Alkaline, distill'd yields a
Limpid Water, neither Acid nor Al∣kaline,
Saline nor Inflammable, and
<PB N="90" REF="120"/>
what remains at the Bottom of the
Retort is neither Acid nor Alkaline;
but being exhal'd by the Consistence
of a Syrup, passeth through all the
degrees of Colours, Yellow, Red,
Brown and Black; and this soapy
Water being calcin'd affords some
Quantity of Sea Salt, but only in
the case of the Animal's taking Sea Salt
with its Food.</P>
<P>9. Hence Sea Salt passeth unal∣ter'd
through all the Strainers of a
human Body, the moderate use of
it is very proper to preserve Bodies
through which it passeth from Cor∣ruption,
it detergeth the Vessels, and
keeps the Fluids from Putrefaction.
The Ancients gave the <HI>Sal Gemmoe</HI>
in putrid Fevers.</P>
<P>All human Urine distill'd affords
a Water of a fetid Odour which
that of Animals fed on Vegetables
does not. The Urine of hard
Drinkers and feverish Persons affords
a Liquor extremely fetid, but no
<PB N="91" REF="121"/>
Inflammable Spirit, what is Inflam∣mable
stays in the Blood, and affects
the Brain. Great Drinkers commonly
die Apoplectick.</P>
<P>10. The Urine is a Lixivium of
the Salts that are in a human Body,
and the proper Mark of the State
and Quantity of such Salts, and
therefore very certain Indications for
the choice of Diet may be taken
from the state of Urine. Though
the Salts of human Urine be neither
Acid nor Alkaline, these Salts may
by the violent Motion of the Blood
be turn'd Alkaline, and even Corro∣sive,
and when they begin to turn so,
they affect the small and tender Fibres
of the Brain more sensibly than other
Parts.</P>
<P>11. Recent Urine distill'd with a
great Heat, and dry Sand will afford
a Volatile Alkaline Salt, and after
the same manner the Heat of a hu∣man
Body as it grows more intense
makes the Urine smell still more
<PB N="92" REF="122"/>
strong, and of a deeper Colour.
But as long as those Alkaline Salts
are carried off by Urine, the Brain
and Nerves are less affected, but on
the contrary, when in a Fever these
Salts are left behind, that is when
the Urine turns pale, the Patient is
in danger.</P>
<P>12. Recent Urine distill'd with a
fix'd Alkali is turn'd into an Alka∣line
Nature, whence it seems proba∣ble
that Alkaline Salts taken into a
human Body, have the power of
turning its benign Salts into fiery and
volatile, on which account they
seem improper in inflammatory Di∣stempers,
where the Salts are already
too much attenuated. <HI>Hippocrates</HI>
who found out this by Experience
order'd in such a case Things of an
Acid Nature. In general a high co∣lour'd
Urine indicates an Acid cool∣ing
Diet, for it is certain an Acid
or Alkalescent Diet makes a great
difference in the Salts of a human
Body.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="123"/>
13. The Rob or Sapa of Urine
distill'd with quick Lime affords a
siery, but not an Alkaline Spirit,
and Lime Water given inwardly in
the Case of a Diabetes, will bring
the Urine from Limpid Pale to be
of a higher Colour, which shows the
Power of a Lixivium of quick Lime
to unlock the Salts that are entangled
in the viscid Juices of some scorbutic
Persons.</P>
<P>14. Recent Urine will likewise
crystalize by Inspissation and afford
a Salt neither Acid nor Alkaline,
but of an active Nature, which may
be properly call'd the essential Salt
of a human Body. Urine becomes
Alkaline by Digestion in a heat not
greater than that of a human Body,
and throws off a stony Matter to the
Sides of the Vessel.</P>
<P>15. The Urine long detain'd in
the Bladder as well as a Glass will grow
red, fetid, cadaverous and alka∣line.
The Case is the same with the
<PB N="94" REF="124"/>
stagnant Water of Hydropical Per∣sons,
which at last produce a Drought
and feverish Heat.</P>
<P>16. From hence very good Rules
may be drawn for the Diet of Ne∣phritick
and Dropsical Persons, that
it ought to be such as is opposite to
and subdueth the Alkalescent Nature
of the Salts in the Serum of their
Blood; those manifest themselves in
the Urine, which as was said before
is the Lixivium of the whole Body.
Sal Ammoniac may likewise be ob∣tain'd
from Urine, which is nearest
to the Nature of an Animal Salt.</P>
<P>17. The White of an Egg resem∣bles
the Nutritious Juice of an Ani∣mal
Body, from the White of an Egg
every part of a perfect Animal is
form'd, for during the Incubation of
the Hen, there is nothing of the Egg
consum'd but the White.</P>
<P>18. The White of an Egg is a
viscous, unactive, insipid, inodorous
Liquor capable of mixing with Wa∣ter,
<PB N="95" REF="125"/>
and so mild that appply'd to the
most sensible part, the Eye, it causeth
no Pain.</P>
<P>19. It is neither Acid nor Alka∣line,
for if the Juices of an Animal
Body were either, so as by the mix∣ture
of the opposites, to cause an
Ebullition, they would burst the
Vessels.</P>
<P>20. The White of an Egg gra∣dually
dissolves by Heat, exceeding a
little the Heat of a human Body, a
greater degree of Heat will thicken it
into a white, opaque, dry, viscous
Mass, and this is the Case of the Se∣rum
of the Blood, upon which dif∣ferent
Degrees of Heat produce con∣trary
Effects.</P>
<P>Attention ought to be had to this
Maxim in the Management of Diet,
Exercise and all outward and inward
Application to human Bodies and
warm Cataplasms discuss, but scalding
hot may confirm the Tumor. Heat in
general doth not resolve and attenuate
<PB N="96" REF="126"/>
the Juices of a human Body, for too
great Heat will produce Concre∣tions.</P>
<P>21. Spirit of Wine mix'd cold
with the White of an Egg, coagu∣lates
it as much as boil'd Water,
which shows that Spirit of Wine is
an immediate Styptick; so that in∣jected
into the Veins it is sudden
Death, and taken by the Mouth in
great Quantities is sometimes sudden,
but always certain Death. Spirituous
Liquors are so far from attenuating,
volatilizing and rendring perspirable
the Animal Fluids, that it rather
condenseth them and hardneth the
Solids, and therefore properly us'd
to hinder the growth of young Ani∣mals,
and this it will do by mere
external Friction; thereby coagulating
the Juices in the Extremities of the
Vessels, hardening and abolishing the
Canals, and so increasing their Re∣sistance
against the Force of the in∣fluent
Liquid, which would other∣wise
<PB N="97" REF="127"/>
stretch them. This plainly de∣monstrates
the bad Effects of inflam∣mable
Spirits on human Bodies.</P>
<P>22. The Water gain'd from the
White of an Egg by a gentle Distil∣lation,
is neither Acid nor Alkaline;
but by a strong Distillation it affords
an Alkaline Spirit, Salt, two kinds of
Oil, and an Earth, which is another
instance of the Alterations great de∣grees
of Heat cause in Animal Sub∣jects;
and hence we may conclude
that Volatile Salts never exist in
their own form, in an Animal Bo∣dy,
that the Heat requir'd to make
them Volatile endangers the life of
the Animal; hence a highly Alkas∣cent
Diet in hot Constitutions must
be hurtful,</P>
<P>23. The White of an Egg will
putrify and turn Alkaline by Di∣gestion,
a single Grain of this pu∣trify'd
Substance has operated like a
Poison, causing Vomiting and a Loose∣ness,
the Antidote of this Poison is some
<PB N="98" REF="128"/>
Acid Liquor, and such are indeed in∣dicated
when the Juices of a human
Body verge to Putrefaction. The
White of an Egg during Incubation
is dissolv'd, but not properly speak∣ing
putrify'd, for in such a State it
would be unfit for Nutrition.</P>
<P>24. It seems probable that the
Bile in a human Body by stagnating
putrifies, causing a Cholera Morbus
in the first Passages, and a Pestilen∣tial
Distemper when it mixeth with
the Blood. In such a state of the
Bile, the Aliment ought to be thin
to dilute, demulcent to temper, or
acid to subdue and destroy an Alka∣line
Acrimony.</P>
<P>The Nutritious Juice of a healthy
Animal resembles the White of an
Egg in most of its Qualities, but
this nutritious Juice being a subtile
Liquor, scarce obtainable from a
human Body, the Serum of the
Blood is fairly substituted in its
place.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="129"/>
25. The Serum of the Blood
stands the foremention'd Trials, and
discovers itself to be neither Acid
nor Alkaline, only Oil of Vitriol
thickens and the Oil of Tartar thins
it a little.</P>
<P>26. The Serum of the Blood di∣gested
in a Heat not greater than
that of a human Body in health,
will gradually become thinner, be∣gin
to smell Cadaverous and putrify,
and at last, like the White of an Egg,
turn to an Alkaline Ichor, that fer∣ments
with Acids, and committed
to Distillation affords like the White
of an Egg, an Alkaline Salt. This
shows the Effect of gentle Heat in dis∣solving
Coagulations, for even the
Viscous Matter which lies like Leather
upon the extravasated Blood of Pleu∣ritick
People may be dissolv'd by a
due Degree of Heat.</P>
<P>27. When the Blood stagnates in
any part of the Body, it first coa∣gulates
<PB N="100" REF="130"/>
then resolves, turns Alkaline,
Putrid and Corrosive.</P>
<P>28. As the Serum of the Blood
is resolvable by a small Heat, a
greater Heat coagulates it so as to
turn it horny like Parchment, but
when it is throughly putrified it will
no longer concrete. The Blood of
some Persons who have dy'd of the
Plague could not be made to con∣crete,
by reason of the Putrefaction
already begun.</P>
<P>29. The Serum of Blood coa∣gulates
like the White of an Egg
with cold Spirit of Wine.</P>
<P>30. The Serum of the Blood is
more Saline than the White of an
Egg, perhaps by the Salts taken in
Nourishment, and has something of
a more fetid urinous Scent.</P>
<P>31. The Serum of the Blood af∣fords
by Distillation an exceeding
limpid Water, neither Acid nor Al∣kaline,
which shows that the most
<PB N="101" REF="131"/>
subtile part of the Blood approacheth
nearer to Water than any other Li∣quor,
and that the Blood naturally
contains no volatile Salt.</P>
<P>32. These Experiments are to be
made on the Blood of healthy Ani∣mals:
It is possible in a lax and
weak habit of Body, where the Chyle
is not throughly assimilated by Cir∣culation,
but floats on the Blood like
Oil, that such a Serum might af∣ford
quite other Contents, and per∣haps
even an inflammable Spirit,
by reason of the Vegetable Nature of
the Chyle.</P>
<P>33. The Serum of the Blood by
a strong Distillation affords a Spirit,
or Volatile Alkaline Salt, and two
kinds of Oil, and an Earth which
still proves the Effect of Heat in hu∣man
Bodies, in changing the benign
Salts into Alkaline.</P>
<P>34. The Serum of the Blood is
attenuated by Circulation, so as to
pass into the minutest Channels of an
<PB N="102" REF="132"/>
Animal Body, and become fit Nutri∣ment
for it, but by the continual At∣trition,
and Heat of some of its Particles
becomes sharp and offensive to the
Body: Nature has provided the Kid∣neys
to discharge them. Hence ap∣pears
as by Prop. VIII. Chap. II.
the continual Necessity of a fresh Re∣cruit
of Chyle, which like an Emul∣sion
dilutes the Serum, the Mischiefs
arising from the Retention of Salts,
that ought to pass by Urine, and
likewise the proper Indications for
cooling and diluting, in such an Al∣kalescent
State of the Fluids.</P>
<P>35. It appears by Experiments
made upon Bones, and other Ani∣mal
Solids, that they consist of the
same Principles with the Fluids, a
dry Bone distill'd affords a great
Quantity of insipid Water, after the
Bones have undergone the Violence
of the Fire, the Ashes afford no fixt
Salt, only sometimes in Animals
that take Sea Salt, there will be a
<PB N="103" REF="133"/>
very small Proportion of that in the
Ashes.</P>
<P>36. The Animal Fluids and So∣lids
are resolvable into the same
Principles, and this is true not only
of the Fluids and Solids themselves,
but likewise of all Preparations of
them. The Gellies made of the
Decoction of lean Flesh, and Bones
in clear Water are resolvable into
the same Principles as the Flesh and
Bones themselves, and if these De∣coctions
be repeated till the Water
comes off clear, the Remainder yields
no Salt by Distillation and little Oil;
therefore it is possible to extract the
whole Virtues of Animal Substances
by Decoctions, but the gentlest, ex∣tract
the most volatile and finest
Parts after the Oil or Fat is sepa∣rated.</P>
<P>37. Preparations by Cookery of
Fish or Flesh ought to be made with
regard to rectifying their most noxi∣ous
and slimy Substances, and to re∣tain
<PB N="104" REF="134"/>
those that are most Nutritious;
such Preparations as retain the Oil
or Fat are most heavy to the Sto∣mach,
which makes bak'd Meat hard
of Digestion.</P>
<P>38. By Experiments of the Mix∣ture
of different Substances with the
Serum of the Blood, it appears that
all Volatile Alkalis thin it, and Acids
coagulate it. I said Volatile Alkalis
for the Serum being mix'd with an
equal Quantity of Oil of Tartar <HI>per
deliquium,</HI> will grow somewhat thicker,
and an Alkaline Vapour ariseth from
the Mixture; but the fame Propor∣tion
of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac
makes the Serum thinner without
causing any Alteration in the Scent
or Colour.</P>
<P>39. Spirit of Vitriol pour'd to
pure unmix'd Serum coagulates it
as if it had been boil'd. Spirit
of Sea Salt makes a perfect Coagu∣lation
of the Serum likewise, but
with some different Phenomena from
<PB N="105" REF="135"/>
the former. The Spirit of Nitre pro∣duceth
the same Effect.</P>
<P>The Serum which is mix'd with
an Alkali being pour'd to that which
is mix'd with an Acid raiseth an Ef∣fervescence,
at the Cessation of which
the Salts, of which the Acid was com∣pos'd,
will be regenerated.</P>
<P>40. Vinegar is an Acid of a very
peculiar Nature cooling and yet not
coagulating; for Spirit of Vinegar
gently dilutes the Serum of the Blood,
and even the Oil of Tartar being
pour'd to this Mixture causeth no
Effervescence; tho' <HI>Honiberg</HI> says, that
Spirit of Vinegar concentrated, and
reduc'd to its greatest strength will
coagulate the Serum.</P>
<P>41. The Mixture of the Solutions
of Sea-Salt, Sal Gemmae, Borax Ni∣tre,
and Sal Ammoniac, cause no
change of Colour in the Serum; but
dissolve its Texture a little, all except
that of the Borax. Glaubers Salt
maketh a strong Coagulation of the
<PB N="106" REF="136"/>
Serum by reason of the Oil of Vi∣triol
it contains.</P>
<P>42. All saponaceous Substances,
which are a Mixture of Oil and al∣kaline
Salt, thin the Blood without
causing any Effervescence; Spirit of
Harts-Horn given in great Quanti∣ties
will produce Hemorrhages,
which I have known by Experience,
and therefore is very improper in ma∣ny
Cases. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> in his Chymis∣try,
says, That <HI>Sal volatile oleosum</HI>
will coagulate the Serum on Ac∣count
of the Alcahol or rectify'd Spi∣rit
it contains.</P>
<P>43. The Tincture of Salt of Tar∣tar,
<HI>viz.</HI> a Preparation of the high∣est
rectify'd Spirit of Wine, and the
strongest fix'd Alkali, preserves the
Serum in a neutral State; for the Spi∣rit
of Wine tends to coagulate, and
the Alkali on the contrary to dissolve
it, whence it becomes neither thicker
nor thinner.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="137"/>
44. What we take in common
Aliment is endued with the above
mention'd Qualities in some degree.
Therefore from these Experiments ve∣ry
useful Indications for Diet may be
taken according to the different State
of the Blood, as will appear by what

vital Force of a Human Body so in∣tirely,
as to be divested of their ori∣ginal
Qualities; but while they re∣pair
the Fluids and Solids, act va∣riously
upon them, according to
<PB N="108" REF="138"/>
their different Natures. There∣fore,</P>
<P>1. The proper Way of treating
the Subject of Aliment is to consider
the Actions of the several Sorts of it
upon the Fluids and Solids of Hu∣man
Bodies, and to separate at least
in Idea their Alimentary from their
Medicinal Qualities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>The Diseases of Human Bodies
often require Substances of more
active Principles, than what are
found in common Aliment, in or∣der
to produce sudden Alterations:
But where such Alterations are not
necessary, the same Effect may be
obtained by the repeated Force of
Diet, with more Safety to the Bo∣dy,
where the less sudden Chan∣ges
are less dangerous. The smal∣ler
Activity of Aliment is compen∣sated
by its Quantity, for accord∣ing
<PB N="109" REF="139"/>
to the Laws of Motion, if the
Bulk and Activity of Aliment and
Medicines are in reciprocal Propor∣tion,
the Effect will be the same.</P>
<P>1. All Bodies which by the Ani∣mal
Faculties can be changed into
the Fluids and Solids of our Bodies
are call'd Aliment. But to take it
in the largest Sense, by Aliment I
understand every thing which a Hu∣man
Creature takes in common Diet,
as Meat, Drink, and Seasoning, as
Salt, Spice, Vinegar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. It has been explain'd <HI>Prop.</HI> VII.
<HI>Chap.</HI> II. how the Aliment in moving
through the capillary Tubes at last,
as it were stagnates and unites itself
to the Vessel or Tube through which
it flows. But in this Motion it will
act differently, both upon the Fluid
and Solid, according to its different
Nature. Every thing that acts up∣on
the Fluids must at the same time
act upon the Solids, and contrary∣wise,
yet one may separate these two
Actions in Idea.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<PB N="110" REF="140"/>
<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>To enumerate the different Acti∣ons
upon the Fluids and Solids of a
Human Body.</P>
<P>There is a multitude of Words to
express the various Alterations which
are produc'd in a Human Body by
Diet and Medicines, but as far as
relates to our present Subject, they
may be reduc'd to the following ge∣neral
Heads.</P>
<P>1. The Actions upon the Solids
are, <HI>First,</HI> Stimulating or increasing
their Vibrations or oscillatory Mo∣tions.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Contracting, that is
diminishing their Length, and in∣creasing
their Thickness. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Re∣laxing
or making them more flexible
in their less coherent Parts. And
<HI>Lastly,</HI> Constipating or shutting up
the Cavity of the capillary Tubes.</P>
<P>2. The Actions upon the Fluids
are either changing their Qualities or
their Quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="141"/>
3. Their Qualities are chang'd by,
<HI>First,</HI> Attenuating and condensing, that
is diminishing or increasing the Bulk
of their Particles. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By rend∣ring
them acrimonious or mild.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> By coagulating and diluting,
that is, making their Parts more or
less coherent. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> By increasing
or diminishing their Motion through
the Vessels.</P>
<P>4. The Quantity of the Fluids is
increas'd or diminish'd by the Increase
or Diminution of the Quantity of A∣liment;
or by the suppressing or pro∣moting
Animal Secretions.</P>
<P>5. That all these Actions can be
perform'd by Aliment as well as Me∣dicines,
is plain from Reason, Ex∣perience
and in some Cases by ocu∣lar
Demonstration, by observing the
Effects of different Substances upon
the Fluids and Solids of a Human
Body when the Vessels are open, and
gape by a Wound or Sore. The Ef∣fects
of tepid Water and farmaceous
<PB N="112" REF="142"/>
Substances in relaxing; of Spirits, in
stopping Hemorrages, and consolidat∣ing
the Fibres; the Power of al∣kaline
Absorbents in subduing Acri∣mony,
and of Oil in stopping Per∣spiration
is well known to Chirur∣geons,
who are likewise well ac∣quainted
with the Influence of Diet
upon the Wounds and Sores of their
Patients, and from the Condition of
the one, can guess at the Errors or
Regularity of the other. Acrid Sub∣stances
will break the Vessels, and
produce an Ichor instead of laudable
Pus. The chief Intention of Chi∣rurgery
as well as Medicine, is keep∣ing
a just <HI>Equilibrium</HI> between the in∣fluent
Fluids, and vascular Solids,
when the Vessels are too lax, and
don't sufficiently resist the Influx of
the Liquid, it begets a <HI>Fungus</HI> or
proud Flesh; when the Balance is on
the other side, it produceth a Cica∣trice.
Were it not criminal to try
Experiments upon Patients, which
<PB N="113" REF="143"/>
they too often try upon themselves,
I could answer that the Doctrine of
this Chapter would be verify'd by
Experience in Wounds and Sores, as
it is often perceptible even in an
Issue.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Effects of diffe∣rent
alimentary Substances upon the
Fluids and Solids of a Human Body.</P>
<P>1. The first sort of Alimentary
Substances are such as are of so mild
a Nature, that they act with small
Force upon the Solids, and as the
Action and Re-action are equal, the
smallest Degree of Force in the Solids
digests and assimilates them; of such
sort is Milk and Broths made of the
muscular Parts of Animals, which are
as it were already prepar'd, and easi∣ly
converted into Animal Substances;
these are proper. Nourishment for
weak Bodies, and agree perfectly
<PB N="114" REF="144"/>
well with them, unless there be some
particular Acrimony in the Stomach,
which sometimes makes them offen∣sive,
and which Custom at last will
overcome.</P>
<P>2. Those Things which stimulate
the Solids, produce the greatest Al∣terations
in an Animal Body. This
is seen in many Instances. Violent
Sneezing produceth Convulsions in
all the Muscles of Respiration, and
an universal Secretion of all the Hu∣mours,
Tears, Spittle, Sweat, U∣rine,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> So great an Alteration can
be produc'd only by the Tickling of
a Feather, and if the Action of
Sneezing should be continu'd by some
very acrid Substance, it will at last
produce Head-ach, Vomiting, uni∣versal
Convulsions, Fever and Death,
Therefore such active Substances as
taken inwardly in small Quantities
make great Alterations in the Fluids,
must produce this Effect by their sti∣mulating
Quality.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="145"/>
3. Acrid Substances, which are
small enough to pass into the capil∣lary
Tubes, must stimulate the small
Fibres, and irritate them into greater
Contraction, and stronger Vibrati∣ons.</P>
<P>4. Many things which we take
as Aliment, or with our Aliment
have this Quality in some degree:
As the Juices of acid Vegetables,
fermented Liquors, especially sharp
Wines, fermented Spirits, aromatical
Vegetables as Fennel, Savory, Thyme,
Garlick, Onions, Leeks, Mustard,
which abound with a volatile pun∣gent
Salt, all Spices, in general all
Vegetables, which being corrupted
easily resolve themselves into a fetid
oily Alkali. Onions, Garlick, Pep∣per,
Salt, and Vinegar taken in great
Quantities by their <HI>Stimulus,</HI> excite
a momentary Heat and Fever, and
therefore in some Cases to be men∣tion'd
afterwards are very proper.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="146"/>
5. The solid Parts may be con∣tracted
various Ways. <HI>First,</HI> By dis∣solving
their Continuity, for when
a Fibre is cut through, it contracts
itself at both Ends; therefore all
Things which are so acrimonious as
to destroy the small Fibres must
contract them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whatever
makes a Depletion of the Vessels
gives room to the Fibres to contract;
therefore Abstinence produceth this
Effect in the best Manner. What∣ever
shortens the Fibres, by insinuat∣ing
itself into their Parts, as Water
in a Rope, contracts; fermented
Spirits possess their Quality in a great
Degree.</P>
<P>6. The more oily any Spirit is,
the more pernicious, because it is
harder to be eluted by the Blood.
Brandy is more easy to be so, than
Spirit of Juniper, and that than Spi∣rit
of Aniseseed. Compound aro∣matical
Spirits destroy, <HI>First,</HI> By
their fermentative Heat. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By
<PB N="117" REF="147"/>
their oily Tenacity. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By a
caustick Quality residing in Spices
apt to destroy the solid Parts, but
these Qualities render them proper
in some Cases taken in small Quan∣tities.</P>
<P>7. Fermented Spirits contract,
harden and consolidate many Fibres
together, abolishing many Canals, es∣pecially
where the Fibres are the ten∣derest
as in the Brain, by which Qua∣lity
they destroy the Memory and
intellectual Faculties.</P>
<P>8. Acid austere Vegetables have
this Faculty of Contracting and
strengthning the Fibres without some
of the bad Effects of fermented Spi∣rits,
as all Kinds of Sorrel (the Vir∣tues
of which lie in an acid astrin∣gent
Salt, a sovereign Antidote a∣gainst
the putrescent bilious Alkali)
several Kinds of Fruits, as Quinces,
some sorts of Pears with the Marma∣lades
made of them, Medlars, Ca∣pers,
Barberries, Pomegranates, Purs∣lain,
<PB N="118" REF="148"/>
such are easily distinguish'd by
a rough styptick Taste. Amongst
Drinks Austere Wines, unripe Fruits
likewise have the same Quality, but
are apt to obstruct the Nerves, and
occasion Palsies.</P>
<P>9. Relaxing the Fibres is making
them flexible, or easy to be leng∣then'd
without Rupture, which is done
only in the capillary vascular Solids.
Amongst Liquids endued with this
Quality of relaxing, warm Water
stands first, next watery Decoctions
of farinaceous Vegetables, or Grains,
as Oats, Barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All sweet and
mild Garden-fruits, almost all Pot∣Herbs,
Spinage, Betes, Cabbage, Cole∣worts,
and all that Tribe. Red Cab∣bage
besides is reckon'd a good Pec∣toral;
some of the lactescent and
papescent Plants, as Lettuce, Cicho∣ry,
whose Milk is anodyne and re∣solvent,
therefore good in Diseases
of the Liver; but all such Vegeta∣bles
must be unfermented, for Fer∣mentation
<PB N="119" REF="149"/>
changes their Nature. Oils
express'd from mild Plants, Animal
Oils, Cream, Butter, Marrow, which
last is of all oily Substances the most
penetrating.</P>
<P>10. It is not probable that any
thing which Human Creatures take
as Aliment, should have the Quality
of entirely constipating or shutting
up the capillary Vessels, because such
Substances could hardly enter the
Lacteals, and if they did, would stop
the Circulation in the Lungs, but all
viscid Aliment such as is made of
farinaceous Substances unsermented,
neither pass the Lacteals, nor circu∣late
so easily as the same Substances
fermented. Some of the <HI>Fungus</HI> Kind
gather'd by mistake for edible Mush∣rooms,
have produced a Difficulty
of Breathing.</P>
<P>11. The Qualities of the Fluids
can be likewise chang'd by Diet, as
<HI>First,</HI> By attenuating or diminishing
the Cohesion of the Parts of the
<PB N="120" REF="150"/>
Fluid. The Cohesion of the Parts
depends upon the Weight and Quan∣tity,
therefore Abstinence and a slen∣der
Diet attenuates, because Deple∣tion
of the Vessels gives room to the
Fluid to expand itself.</P>
<P>12. Whatever penetrates and di∣lutes
at the same time; therefore
Water impregnated with some pene∣trating
Salt, attenuates most strongly;
Water with <HI>Sal Ammoniac</HI> will pass
through a Human Skin. To this
Quality may be justly ascrib'd the
great Effects of medicated Waters,
all stimulating Substances by increas∣ing
the Motion of the Blood atte∣nuate,
unless they increase the Mo∣tion
so much, as at last to produce
Coagulation.</P>
<P>13. Thickening the Blood is most
easily brought about by exhaling the
most liquid Parts by sudorisick or
watery Evaporations; but this brings
it into a morbid State. Acid austere
Vegetables before mention'd, have
<PB N="121" REF="151"/>
this Quality of condensing the
Fluids, as well as strengthning the
Solids.</P>
<P>14. The Blood of labouring Peo∣ple
is more dense and heavy than of
those who live a sedentary life, and
the Diseases which People imagine
proceed from the Thickness of Blood,
come often from the contrary Cause;
too thin Blood strays into the im∣mediately
subordinate Vessels which
are destin'd to carry Humours secre∣ted
from the Blood, according to
what was said Prop. V. Chap. II.
This causes an Obstruction falsly
ascrib'd to the Thickness of the Blood.</P>
<P>The Qualities of Blood in a healthy
State are to be florid when let out
of the Vessel, the red Part congeal∣ing
strongly and soon together in a
Mass moderately tenaceous,swimming
in the Serum, which ought to be with∣out
any very yellow or greenish cast.
The Gravity of Blood to Sea-Water
is as 26 is to 25, that of the Serum to
<PB N="122" REF="152"/>
the same Water, as 300 to 353, it's
an easy matter to examine extrava∣sated
Blood by these Marks.</P>
<P>15. Acrimony is not Natural, but
induc'd into the Fluids of an Ani∣mal
Body. Acrimony may be intro∣duc'd
by Diet, that is either Muria∣tick,
(Briny) or Acid, which likewise
is of two sorts, of things naturally
Acid; or (made so by Fermentation)
Aromatick, consisting of Salts, and
highly exalted Oils, intimately uni∣ted.
Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> by increasing the
Velocity of the Blood, and conse∣quently
the Attrition of the Parts.</P>
<P>16. Acrimony in the Blood it self
is commonly of three Sorts accord∣ing
to the Nature of the Salts in
which it resides. Acid, Alkaline or
Muriatick as in the Sea Scurvy, but
the last approaches more towards the
Alkaline, and admits of the same
Cure: Acid Acrimony resides chiefly
in the first Passages, proceeding often
from the Weakness of Digestion, and
<PB N="123" REF="153"/>
the too long Duration of Vegetables,
and Milk in the Stomach. Animal
Substanccs are all Alkalescent, of
Vegetable Substances some are Acid,
others Alkalescent, and each Sort is
to be used according to the two dif∣ferent
Intentions.</P>
<P>17. Antiacid Vegetables are, <HI>First,</HI>
All kinds of Garlick, Onions, Leeks,
and Selery, the Actiscorbutick
Plants, Carrots, Turnips, Eringo
Roots, Asparagus, Horse-radish, Mu∣stard,
Cabbage. <HI>Secondly,</HI> All Ani∣mal
Substances especially of such as
live on other Animals; the Juices
of which are more Alkalescent than
of the Animals which live upon
Vegetables, such are most Fishes, es∣pecially
some of the Testaceous kind.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Water as it dilutes and subdues
Acidity. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Oils are Antia∣cids
so far as they blunt Acri∣mony,
but as some times they
are hard of Digestion they produce
Acrimony of another Sort.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="154"/>
18. On the other Hand when the
Acrimony is Alkaline, which is more
frequently the Case in the circulating
Juices. The proper Diet is Decocti∣ons
of Farinaceous Vegetables which
seem appointed by Nature, for the
Vegetable Diet of human Creatures.
This Alkaline Acrimony indicates
the copious use of Vinegar, and
Acid Fruits, as Oranges, which con∣tain
a Juice most effectual in the
Cure of the Muriatick Scurvy of Ma∣riners;
the Juice of Lemons is like∣wise
more proper and more cooling
and astringent than that of Oranges.
In this case all the mild Antiscorbu∣ticks
are indicated as Sorrel, Cichory,
Lettuce, Apples, and of Liquids
Whey: On the contrary all the A∣crid
Antiscorbuticks, as Scurvygrass,
Horseradishes, Mustard, &amp;c. are hurt∣ful
in this hot Scurvy.</P>
<P>19. There is a third sort of
Antiscorbuticks proper in this Alka∣lescent
State of the Fluids, which
<PB N="125" REF="155"/>
is call'd Astringent, such as Pome∣granates,
Capers, and most of the
common Pickles prepar'd with Vine∣gar.
The Extremity of Alkali is
Putrefaction. All Acid Substances,
and Sea Salt resist Putrefaction, but
as it is a sharp solid Body unalterable
in an Animal Body, when it is taken
in too great Quantities in a constant
Diet of Salt Meat, it breaks the
Vessels, produceth Erosions of the
solid Parts, and all the Symptoms of
the Sea-Scurvy, which is to be cured
by Acid Vegetables, and not by hot
Antiscorbutick; all Spices likewise
induce this Acrimony, as was hinted
before.</P>
<P>20. There are other Substances
which are opposite to both Sorts of
Acrimony which are call'd demul∣cent
or mild, because they blunt or
sheath these sharp Salts, as Farinaceous
Legumes, such as Pease, Beans, Len∣tils.
Native Oils of Animals, as
Cream, Butter, Marrow, which last
<PB N="126" REF="156"/>
is a Specifick in that Scurvy which
occasions a Crackling of the Bones,
in which case Marrow performs its
natural Function of moistening them.
All Plants which are without Smell
or pungent Taste are demulcent, as
likewise all the Alimentary Parts of
sound Animals, for none of their
Juices will hurt the Eye or a fresh
Wound. Acrimony which is not
viscid may be cur'd by Diet, but Vis∣cidity
requires more active Substances
to dissolve it.</P>
<P>21. Whatever renders the motion
of the Blood more languid than na∣tural
disposeth to an Acid Acrimo∣ny:
What accelerates the Motion of
the Blood beyond what is natural
disposeth to an Alkaline Acrimony.</P>
<P>22. The next Alteration which
is made in the Fluids is rendering it
more thin, which is perform'd by
Diluting, there is no real Diluent but
Water, every Fluid is diluent as it
contains Water in it. Water dilutes,
<PB N="127" REF="157"/>
but at the same time relaxeth, this
last Quality is taken off by mixing
some Acid Juice with it: Water
mix'd with Acids resists the Heat
and Alkalescent State of the Fluids,
as long as there is Thirst, a quick
Pulse, Dryness, with a free Passage by
Urine, and Stricture of the Vessels, so
long is Water safely taken.</P>
<P>23. Opposite to Dilution is Co∣agulation
or Thickening, which is
perform'd by dissipating the most
liquid Parts by Heat, or by insi∣nuating
some Substances which make
the Parts of the Fluid cohere more
strongly. All Vegetables which make
a black Tincture with the Vitriol of
Steel have this Quality, they have
commonly a rough styptick Taste:
Vinegar as was said before is an A∣cid
very particular, for it doth not
coagulate: Inflammable Spirits co∣agulate
the Fluids, and harden the
Solids in a strong Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="158"/>
24. Resolving what is congeal'd
is turning it into a Fluid again; this
can be perform'd by watery Liquors,
impregnated with some penetrating
Salt, but more effectually by sapa∣naceous
Substances compos'd of Oil
and Salt, such are Honey, and the
Robs and Gellies of most Fruits.
Vinegar and Honey mix'd is a strong
resolvent. Spissitude is subdu'd by
Acrid things, and Acrimony by in∣spissitating.</P>
<P>25. The second Manner of Ope∣rating
upon the Fluids is by in∣creasing
or diminishing their Quan∣tity,
the first is perform'd by a plen∣tiful
Diet, and the Suppression of E∣vacuations,
the second either by a
spare Diet or promoting the Animal
Secretions, that is expelling the
Fluids out of the Body. Tho' Secre∣tions
of the laudable Juices are best
accomplish'd by increasing the Fluids.</P>
<P>26. Whatever generates a Quan∣tity
of good Chyle, must likewise
<PB N="129" REF="159"/>
generate Milk, such is new Milk
season'd with Sugar or Salt. This
will increase the Milk when it is di∣minish'd
by the too great use of
Flesh Meat: Gruels made of Grains,
Broths, Malt Drink not much
hopp'd, Posset Drinks, and in gene∣ral
whatever relaxeth, have the same
Effect.</P>
<P>27. There are as many good
Pectorals of the Alimentary, as of
the Medicinal kind, as all Prepara∣tions
of Barley, Oats, Honey, all
Saponaceous Substances before-men∣tion'd
which attenuate Flegm.</P>
<P>28. There is Aliment lenitive ex∣pelling
the faeces without stimulating
the Bowels, such are Anim al Oils
quite fresh (for by standing they
grow Acrid) as Cream, Butter, Mar∣row,
Broths made of the Parts of
Animals about the Mesentery, Oils
express'd from ripe Fruits (from un∣ripe
they are austere and astringent)
the Juices of mild and ripe Fruits,
<PB N="130" REF="160"/>
Decoctions of farinaceous Vegeta∣bles,
natural Soaps as Honey, Sugar,
such Diet is proper for the hot Con∣stitutions
of warm Countries, where
strong Perspiration exhales the Mois∣ture.
Water, Milk, Whey, taken in
the open Air without much exercise
so as to make them perspire, relax
the Belly.</P>
<P>29. There are Aliments which
besides this lubricating Quality, sti∣mulate
in a small Degree. Gellies
made of the solid parts of Animals,
as of their Horns, stimulate by the
Salts that are in them. Salted Flesh
which often throws Ships-crews into
Fluxes, Shell Fishes which have a Sa∣line
Taste, Garden Fruits which have
any Acrimony, most sorts of Berries,
some of which will produce Diarrhoeas,
warm Water mix'd with Honey,
and Honey mix'd with Acids dissolve
Flegm in the Bowels. There are o∣thers
which promote the Secretion of
Bile, such as all natural Soaps, the
<PB N="131" REF="161"/>
Juices of Fruits sharp, and sweet, es∣pecially
Grapes, the immoderate use
of which will produce a Cholera Mor∣bus.</P>
<P>30. Diureticks are Decoctions,
Emulsions and Oils of Emollient
Vegetables, in so far as they relax
the Urinary Passages: Such as relax
ought to be try'd before such as force
and stimulate. Those Emollients
ought to be taken in open Air to
hinder them from perspiring, and on
empty Stomachs. Vegetables which
abound with essential Salt, are Diu∣retick
by stimulating, as Sorrel,
Chervil, Parsly, Eringo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
likewise all such as contain an Aro∣matical
Balsam as Asparagus, Fen∣nel,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>31. As to Sudorificks, it ought
to be consider'd that the Liquid which
goes off by Sweat, is often the most
subtile part of the Blood, and ought
not to be forc'd away without ma∣nifect
necessity. The Matter of in∣sensible
<PB N="132" REF="162"/>
Perspiration is mild, that of
Sweat resembles Urine, and yields a
Volatile Salt, oily and fetid. When
Sweat is vehement it will grow Bloody.
The Matter of Sweat is the watery
part of our Drink impregnated with
this Salt, sometimes in weak and
consumptive People, Crude, Chyle,
and sometimes (as was said before)
the most elaborate subtile part of
our Blood, as in fat People who
have a small insensible Perspiration.</P>
<P>32. Sweat is produc'd by chang∣ing
the balance between the Fluids
and Solids (in which it must be
confest that true Health consists) so
as the projectile Motion of the
Fluids overcome the Resistance of
the Solids; therefore it is produc'd
by relaxing the Passages of the Skin.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> By diluting. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By
dissolving the Blood. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> By
accelerating its Motion. Water dilutes
and relaxes at the same time, therefore
the best and safest Sudorifick, watery
<PB N="133" REF="163"/>
and Acid things mix'd prove strong
Sudorificks; Spices by Heating, and
dissolving the Blood are not so pro∣per
and safe Sudorificks.</P>
<P>33. Insensible Perspiration is the
last and mod perfect Action of A∣nimal
Digestion; the keeping it up
in due measure, is the cause as well
as sign of Health, and the least
Deviation from that due Quantity,
the certain forerunner of a Disease,
therefore the best Indications for Diet
are taken from the Measure of Per∣spiration.</P>
<P>The Food which is most Vapo∣rish
and Perspirable is certainly the
most easily digested, but such may
be proper or improper, for the A∣nimal
according to its Circumstances,
especially the Quantity of its Mus∣cular
Motion. By Prop. IV. Chap. II.
The strength of the Aliment must
be proportion'd to the action of the
Solids upon it, which in an Animal
under a course of exercise or hard
<PB N="134" REF="164"/>
labour is much stronger; therefore
Aliment too Vaporose or Perspira∣ble,
will subject it to the inconve∣niences
of too strong a Perspiration,
which are Debility, Faintings, and
sometimes sudden Death. What di∣minisheth
Sweating, or the sensible
Perspiration increaseth the insensible,
for that reason a Strengthning and
Astringent Diet often conduceth to
this purpose. According to the Ex∣periments
of <HI>Sanctorius</HI> the most
nourishing Aliment is the least per∣spirable
except Mutton, which of
all others is most so, and Hog's
Flesh the least; and for the same rea∣son
Eels, and all very fat and oily
Substances: copious Food of small
Nourishment perspires much.</P>
<P>A Stomach too void or too full
stops Perspiration. The Fruits of the
low Pomiferous Plants as Cucum∣bers,
Melons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> stop Perspira∣tion,
therefore they are wisely provi∣ded
by Nature in a Season when the
<PB N="135" REF="165"/>
Perspiration is too great. Variety of
Meats diminish Perspiration, Honey
in cold Constitutions increaseth Per∣spiration,
except when it promotes
too great a Secretion of the Bile,
and then it diminisheth it: Drinking
excessively during the time of Chy∣lification,
stops Perspiration. Let
those who sit long at their Bottle af∣ter
Meals consider this.</P>
<P>The most sure sign of a deficient
Perspiration is Flatulency or Wind.</P>
<P>34. The Menses are promoted.
<HI>First,</HI> By every thing which occasi∣ons
a Plethora, such are all Aliments
of easy Digestion, taken in sufficient
Quantity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By all Sapona∣ceous
Substances, which incide the
Mucus in the first Passages. <HI>Thirdly,</HI>
By Spices and warm Vegetables
which abound with a Volatile oily
Salt. Of these we have spoken be∣fore.</P>
<P>35. Heat in Animal Bodies is
produc'd by the Attrition of the Fluids
<PB N="136" REF="166"/>
and Solids, for when that ceaseth as
in Death, there is extremity of Cold,
The solid parts of Animals rubbing
against one another would in time
produce a Heat capable to destroy
the Parts, had not Nature provided
an oily Substance to lubricate and
moisten them; when that fails as
happens sometimes in the Scurvy,
Gout, and Rheumatism, an Inflam∣matory
Heat is often produc'd.</P>
<P>36. Stimulating Substances taken
in Diet increase Heat, because they
increase the Oscillatory Motion of
the Solids, but most of all In∣flammatory
Spirits. Whatever in∣creaseth
the Density of the Blood,
even without increasing its Celerity,
heats, because a denser Body is hot∣ter
than a rarer. Extreme Cold at last
heats. Cold in Animal Bodies is
produc'd by Causes contrary to those
productive of Heat, as <HI>First,</HI> by di∣minishing
the force of any Stimulus,
as by Whey, Milk, Water, <HI>&amp;c.
<PB N="137" REF="167"/>
Secondly,</HI> By all Things which relax.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> Alkaline Substances in re∣spect
of Acid, and Acid in respect
of Alkaline are cooling.</P>
<P>37. Cephalick are all such Things
as attenuate the Blood so as to make
it circulate easily through the capil∣lary
Vessels of the Brain. A Cor∣dial
properly speaking is not always
what increaseth the Force of the
Heart; for by increasing that the
Animal may be weaken'd as in in∣flammatory
Diseases. Whatever in∣creaseth
the Natural or Animal
Strength, the Force of moving the
Fluids and the Muscles is a Cordial,
such are such Substances, as bring
the Serum of the Blood into the
properest Condition for Circulation
and Nutrition, as Broths made of
Animal Substances, Milk, ripe Fruits,
and whatever is endued with a
wholesome but not pungent Taste.
Whatever relaxes the too strict, or
strengthens the too lax Fibres, what
<PB N="138" REF="168"/>
in some Cases dispels Wind, what
excites and takes off the sluggish Mo∣tion
of the Animal Spirits, as Spi∣ces,
Wine, and spirituous Liquors.</P>
<P>38. Carminative are such Things
as dilute and relax at the same time,
because Wind occasions a Spasm or
Convulsion in some Part; whatever
promotes insensible Perspiration is
Carminative, for Wind is perspirable
Matter retain'd in the Body.</P>
<P>39. All emollient relaxing Diet,
and all things which destroy Acrimo∣ny,
abate Pain.</P>
<P>40. There are several Things ta∣ken
in Diet which kill Worms, as
Oil, and Honey.</P>
<P>Whoever attends to the Particu∣lars
barely hinted at in this Chapter,
will easily perceive that all the In∣tentions
pursued by Medicines, may
be obtain'd and inforc'd by Diet.</P>
<P>It may be expected that I should
say something in this Chapter of the
Qualities of three exotick Plants,
<PB N="139" REF="169"/>
whose Infusions and Decoctions are
now much us'd in common Aliment,
Tea, Coffee and Chocolate: There
are many Treatises wrote about them,
which ascribe to them both good
and bad Qualities, which they have
not. There is lately published a ve∣ry
learned and elaborate Dissertation
upon Tea, by Doctor <HI>Thomas Short,</HI>
in which the Author with great
Knowledge, Industry, and Skill, has
not only given us the natural Histo∣ry
of the Plant, but likewise its A∣nalysis.</P>
<P>But as the Infusions and Decocti∣ons
of the foremention'd Vegetables
in common Water, are the only Pre∣parations
of them in Use, there is no
necessity in this Place of considering
any of their Contents, but such as
are extracted by those simple Opera∣tions
of Cookery.</P>
<P>The green Leaves of Tea contain
a narcotick Juice, which exudes by
Roasting. This is perform'd with
<PB N="140" REF="170"/>
great Care before it is expos'd to sale.
The several Methods of discovering
the Adulterations of Tea by Coppe∣ras,
Galls, Spirit of Harts-horn, one
may see in the foremention'd Trea∣tise.
Tea by its manner of affecting
the Organs of Taste and Smell, con∣tains
very little of a volatile Spirit;
its Rosin or fix'd Oil which is bit∣ter
and astringent, cannot be ex∣tracted
by Water, but demands recti∣fy'd
Spirit. The active Principles of
it extracted by Infusion, are the most
separable Parts of its Oil or Gum,
and its Salt.</P>
<P>Its Salt and Gum are astringent;
chalybeat Water draws from it a
Tincture of the same Colour as that
from Oak-leaves. It is acescent as
appears by its Effects upon Stomachs
troubled with Acidity. So that Tea
is an Infusion of a Plant acescent,
and moderately astringent in warm
Water.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="171"/>
As a watery Liquor, it is diluting
and stimulating by its Salt: By its
astringent Quality it moderates the
relaxing Quality of warm Water.
By what has been said before in this
Chapter, Water endu'd with any sa∣line
stimulating Substance is very pe∣netrating,
and goes into the most
inward Recesses of the circulating
Juices by its Quality, and re∣fresheth
the Brain and Animal Spi∣rits;
but by its styptick and stimu∣lating
Quality it affects the Nerves,
very often occasioning Tremors, by
its Heat it promotes Perspiration, by
its watery Quality it dissolves what
is viscid in the Stomach, and so
ay help Digestion; but a strong
Decoction of it is emetick, and
drinking too great Quantities may
relax and weaken the Tone of the
Stomach.</P>
<P>As stimulating and diluting it is
diuretick, but as it is astringent, it
is not quite so proper where relax∣ing
<PB N="142" REF="172"/>
the urinary Passages is neces∣sary.</P>
<P>Milk abates some of the foremen∣tion'd
Qualities, making it more soft
and nutritious, and Sugar as a Salt
increaseth its <HI>Stimulus.</HI> From those
Hints it follows, <HI>First,</HI> That Tea is
proper only for such whose Bodies
are in such a State as demands some
of the foremention'd Alterations.
Who these are, will be shown more
plainly in the following Chapter. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
That the immoderate Strength
and Quantity of this Liquor may be
hurtful in many Cases, and to most
People.</P>
<P>Coffee has in common with all
Nuts an Oil strongly combin'd, and
entangled with earthy Particles.</P>
<P>The most noxious Part of its Oil
exhales in roasting to the Abatement
of near 1/4 of its Weight.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Philos. Transact.</NOTE> One Pound of Coffee by Dis∣tillations
afforded of volatile Spirit,
<PB N="143" REF="173"/>
six Ounces six Drachms: of Oil, two
Ounces, two Drachms, two Scruples:
of <HI>Caput mortuum</HI> five Ounces three
Drachms. Tho' the Chymist did
not, or could not calcine the <HI>Caput
mortuum</HI> so as to obtain its fix'd Salt,
to be sure it must have some.</P>
<P>What is extracted by Water from
Coffee, is the most separable Parts of
Oil which often swims a-top of the
Decoction. This Oil is Volatile,
and consequently very little Nutri∣tious.</P>
<P>Volatile Oils refresh the Animal
Spirits, but likewise are endued with
all the bad Qualities of such Sub∣stances,
producing all the Effects of
an oily and aromatical Acrimony
mention'd in the following Chapter,
as Dryness, Heat, Stimulation, Tre∣mors
of the Nerves, from whence it
has been accus'd of causing Palsies,
Leanness, Watchfulness, and destroy∣ing
masculine Vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="174"/>
From these Qualities it is easy to
imagine that it must be hurtful to
hot, dry, bilious Constitutions, and
perhaps beneficial to Phlegmatick,
and that drank in too great a Degree
of Strength or Quantity hurtful to
every Body.</P>
<P>Chocolate is certainly much the
best of those three exotick Liquors,
its Oil seems to be both rich, ali∣mentary,
and anodyne; for an Oil
as soft as that of sweet Almonds can
be extracted from the Nut, and the
<HI>Indians</HI> made Bread of it. This Oil
combin'd with its own Salt and Su∣gar,
makes it saponaceous and de∣tergent,
by which Quality it often
helps Digestion and excites Appetite,
when it is mix'd with Vanillios or
Spices; it acquires likewise the good
and bad Qualities of aromatick Oils,
which are proper in some Cases and
Constitutions, and very improper in
others.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the different Intentions to be pur∣sued

<P>WHolesome and unwholesome
are relative not real Quali∣ties,
therefore to affirm that such a

<P>To make these Terms of whole∣some

there are two Things ne∣cessary,
<HI>First,</HI> To shew what Aliment
is proper for what Intention. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
What Intention is proper to
be pursued in such a Constitution of
a Human Body The <HI>First</HI> is the
Subject of the foregoing Chapter,
and the <HI>Second</HI> of this.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="146" REF="176"/>
<HEAD>PROP. I.</HEAD>
<P>To enumerate the most common
Diversities of the Constitutions of
Human Bodies.</P>
<P>The most common Diversities of
Human Constitutions arise either
from the solid Parts as to their dif∣ferent
Degrees of Strength and Ten∣sion;
in some being too lax and
weak, in others too elastick and
strong; or from the different State
of the Fluids, which, as they consist
of Spirit, Water, Salts, Oil and ter∣restrial
Parts, differ according to the
Redundance of the whole, or of a∣ny
of these Ingredients, and there∣fore
are plethorick, phlegmatick, oily
or fat, saline, earthy or dry by the
Dissipation of the most fluid Parts,
which last Constitution is call'd, by
the Antients, Atrabilarian or Melan∣cholick.
A plethorick Constitution
in which true Blood abounds, is
<PB N="147" REF="177"/>
call'd Sanguineous. A saline Constitu∣tion
is either Acid, Alkaline, or Mu∣riatick,
according to the Difference
of the Salts which occasion it.</P>
<P>2. In some of these Senses, tho'
every Human Constitution is mor∣bid,
yet are their Diseases consistent
with the common Functions of Life,
and leave them under their own
Conduct as to their Manner of liv∣ing,
and therefore are a proper Sub∣ject
for this Discourse in which I am
far from pretending to instruct the
Brethren of the Profession, or antici∣pating
their Directions to such as are
under their Government.</P>
<P>3. I think it proper to advertise
the Reader of two Things. <HI>First,</HI>
That I endeavour to give the most
simple Idea of the Distemper of the
Constitution, and the proper Diet,
abstracting from the Complications
of the First, or the Contra-indicati∣ons
to the Second. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
in a Discourse of this Nature, the
<PB N="148" REF="178"/>
Reasonings must be precise, tho' the
Practice may admit of great Lati∣tude.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. II.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Causes, Symptoms
and proper Diet of such as have
weak and lax Fibres.</P>
<P>1. In all the Fibres of an Animal
Body, and in the Sides of all the
Canals, there is a contractile Power
whereby the Fibres endeavour to
shorten themselves. This is evident;
for if a Fibre be cut transversly, both
the Ends shrink, and make the
Wound gape; the Force oppos'd to
this contractile Power of the Fibres,
is the influent Liquid. Health con∣sists
in the <HI>Equilibrium</HI> between those
two Powers, when the Fluids move
so equally, that they don't press up∣on
the Solids with a greater Force
than they can bear, and no more in
one Part than in another; and on
<PB N="149" REF="179"/>
the other hand when the Solids re∣sist,
and act upon the Fluids so e∣qually
that there is no uneasy Sensa∣tion,
the Animal is in Health; on
the contrary when ever this <HI>Equili∣brium</HI>
between the influent Fluids and
Solids is taken away the Animal is
in a morbid State; and whatever
destroys it in any Point, destroys it
in some measure through the whole
Body.</P>
<P>2. The first and most simple So∣lids
of our Body are perhaps merely
terrestrial, incapable of any Change
or Disease; of these Elements are
constituted the smallest Fibres, of
those Fibres the Vessels, of those Ves∣sels
the <HI>Viscera</HI> or Organs of the Bo∣dy;
therefore the Weakness and La∣xity
of the Fibres, Vessels, Viscera,
and all Parts of the Body may be
considered as one Disease, tho' it
must be own'd that the Disease is
not always universal, and there will
be sometimes a Weakness in some
<PB N="150" REF="180"/>
Organ with a great Degree of mus∣cular
Strength.</P>
<P>3. A Fibre is said to be weak
when the Cohesion of its Parts is so
small that it may be broken, or re∣solved
by a Force not much greater
than what happens commonly in the
Body of a healthy Person: Debility
of the Vessels or Organs is so small
a Cohesion of the constituent Parts
as makes them unable to discharge
the common Functions of Life, con∣sider'd
in a State of Health. Tho'
there is a Debility of Fibres in In∣fants
absolutely speaking, yet it is
no Disease, because their Fibres be∣ing
lax, lengthen by the Influx of
the Liquids which is the Cause of
their Growth; but in adult Persons,
when the Fibres cannot any more
yield, they must either break or lose
their Spring.</P>
<P>4. Laxity of a Fibre is such a
small Cohesion of its Parts, as suf∣fers
it to be lengthen'd by a small
<PB N="151" REF="181"/>
Force: Laxity is a Species of Debi∣lity.</P>
<P>5. The most common Causes of
Debility of Fibres are, <HI>First,</HI> A De∣fect
or great Loss of the vital nutri∣tious
Juices: If there is not Blood
enough the Chyle cannot be easily
assimilated. A Person who loseth
daily great Quantities of Blood turns
Dropsical and Leucophlegmatick.
An elastick Fibre like a Bow, the
more it is extended, restores itself
with the greater Force; if the Spring
be destroy'd, it is like a Bag only
passive as to the Influx of the Li∣quid.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Nourishment too
viscid and glutinous to be subdu'd
by the vital Force; of this Sort <HI>Hip∣pocrates</HI>
reckoned unfermented Bread.
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> A sedentary Life, for Mo∣tion
increaseth the Circulation of the
Juices, and consequently the Appli∣cation
of the solid Parts to one an∣other.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> Too great an Ex∣tention
of the Fibres by Plenitude;
<PB N="152" REF="182"/>
a Lute-string will bear a hundred
Weight without Rupture; but at
the same time cannot exert its Elasti∣city,
take away fifty, and imme∣diately
it raiseth the Weight. <HI>Fifth∣ly,</HI>
A moist Atmosphere. The At∣mosphere
is what keeps the Fibres
of an Animal Body together, we
feel our Fibres grow strict or lax ac∣cording
to the State of the Air; ma∣ny
who live healthy in a dry Air, fall
into all the Diseases that depend up∣on
Relaxation in a moist one. <HI>Last∣ly,</HI>
A natural Weakness from the
Frame and Constitution of the Body.</P>
<P>6. The common Signs and Ef∣fects
of weak Fibres are Paleness,
Smoothness, Coldness of the Skin,
Colour of the Blood not Florid (for
what maketh that is a strong action
of the Solids) a weak Pulse, Tume∣factions
in the whole Body or Parts,
Stagnation of Humours, and its
consequence Putrefactions; for when
the force of the Vessels and Pressure
<PB N="153" REF="183"/>
of the Air is taken off, all the Hu∣mours
expand themselves, and what
stagnates must putrify; if a Person
of a firm Constitution begins to
bloat, and from being warm grows
cold, his Fibres grow weak. Anxiety
and Palpitations of the Heart are a
sign of weak Fibres: Acid Eructati∣ons
upon taking Vegetable Food, or
Nidorose upon taking Animal is a
sign of weak Organs of Digestion.
Depravation of the Humours from a
sound State, to what the Physicians
call by the general Name of a Caco∣chymy,
Spots and Discolorations of
the Skin are signs of weak Fibres;
for the lateral Vessels which lie out
of the Road of Circulation, let gross
Humours pass, which could not if the
Vessels had their due Degree of
stricture. Atrophy as denoting a De∣struction
or Obstruction of the Ves∣sels,
which carry the Nourishment,
and Dropsies proceed from a Laxity
of the Fibres being too weak to re∣turn
the Fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="184"/>
7. It is evident that the Aliment
of Persons with weak Fibres, ought
to be such as requires but a small
force to convert it into Animal Sub∣stances,
such is that mention'd
Chap. V. Prop. IV. V. Milk is the
Chylous part of an Animal already
prepar'd, the Cheesy part is separa∣ted
and dissolv'd by the Bile, and the
more Serous and Spiritous Part en∣ters
into the Blood, meer Whey is
too relaxing, Eggs taken warm from
the Hen; for the most elaborate and
spiritous Part is lost in the dressing
Broths made of Flesh, which are
the Nutritious Animal Juices separated
from the solid Parts. The Alkales∣cent
Quality of them may be corre∣cted,
if necessary, by mixing them with
some Acid. Decoctions, and Creams,
or Jellies of well fermented Bread, (for
Fermentation as was hinted Chap. III.
Prop. IV. destroys the glutinous
oily Viscidity with which mealy Sub∣stances
abound) austere Wines di∣luted
<PB N="155" REF="185"/>
with Water, which cool more
than Water alone, and at the same
time do not relax, Vegetables with
an acid austere Juice mention'd
Chap V. Prop. IV. VIII. are all pro∣per
in this Case. Relaxation from Ple∣nitude
is cur'd by spare Diet, and from
any Cause by that which is contrary to
it. Care must be taken in contracting
the Fibres, not to obstruct the Vessels.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Symptoms, Causes,
and proper Diet of such as have too
strong and too elastick Fibres.</P>
<P>1. A State opposite to the former
is too great Rigidity and Elasticity
of the Fibres, which is such a Degree
of Cohesion as makes them inflexible
to the Causes, to which they ought
to yield, so as to preserve the Ani∣mal
in Health: Too great Elasticity
is that Quality by which they not
only resist against Elongation, but
<PB N="156" REF="186"/>
restore themselves with too great
Pressure and Force upon the moving
Fluid.</P>
<P>Rigidity of the Organs is such a
State as makes them resist that Ex∣pansion,
which is necessary to carry
on the Vital Functions. Rigidity of
the Vessels and Organs must neces∣sarily
follow from Rigidity of the
Fibres, both as the Fibres are their
constituent Parts, and likewise be∣cause
by the strong Force of the
Heart and Motion of the Fluids,
many of the Solids are compacted into
one, and the Canals, through which
they flow'd, abolish'd as by Prop. VII.
Chap. II.</P>
<P>2. True Health consists in such a
Flexibility of Fibres as yield to the
Force of the Heart, so as to admit
the influent Fluid, and then such a
due Spring to restore themselves so
as to drive it forward; for if the Ca∣nals
were entirely rigid, or the Force
of the Fibres in restoring themselves
<PB N="157" REF="187"/>
were either in Equilibrium with, or
exceeding that of the Heart, there
could be no Circulation, even if the
Vessels drive back the Blood with
too great a Force upon the Heart,
it will produce Polypose Concreti∣ons
in the Ventricles of the Heart,
especially when the Valves of the
Heart are apt themselves to grow too
rigid, if but one Drop of Blood re∣main
in the Heart at every Pulse;
those in many Pulses will grow to a
considerable Mass.</P>
<P>3. It is easy by the Laws of Hy∣draulicks
to determine the natural
Effects of such a Constitution, which
is the Parent of acute Diseases, as
Laxity of Chronical.</P>
<P>4. The Cause of such a Disease
besides the Natural Constitution
and Frame of the Body is too long
a Continuance of such Diet as
strengthens the Fibres, hard Exercise
or Labour, such as use it, according
to <HI>Hippocrates</HI> are not easily cur'd of
<PB N="158" REF="188"/>
Pleurisies; such a Constitution is
easily known by the outward ap∣pearances
of the Body being lean,
warm, hairy, scraggy, dry without a
Disease, with hard and firm Muscles,
for the great Force by which the
small Vessels restore themselves, makes
them grow narrow, expelling the
Liquor they contain, and scarce ad∣mitting
what is influent by which
the Vessels grow hard and contract∣ed;
lastly by the Strength of the
Pulse, and the Force of the vital
Actions.</P>
<P>5. The Rules of Diet for such a
Constitution may be drawn from
Prop. IV. of the foregoing Chapter.
<HI>First,</HI> Abstinence from things us'd
in the contrary State of too great
Laxity. Milk is too nourishing, but
Whey proper as an Emollient. Au∣stere
and strong Wines are improper
but much more so are inflammable
Spirits which harden the Fibres; Wa∣ter
is the proper Drink being strongly
<PB N="159" REF="189"/>
relaxing, there is no better way of
suppling a Carcass then by drenching
it in Water. All Emollient Nourish∣ment,
such as Fruits which contain a
Mucilage, and may be boil'd into Jel∣lies.
Pot Herbs of the Emollient kind,
such things as resolve and cleanse,
that is take away any tenacious So∣lid
which adheres to the Fibres, such
are Vegetable Soaps, the chief of
which is Honey. The Animal Food
should be prepar'd in Broths rather
than in any other form, all things
which increase Fat, all oily Substan∣ces.
The Animal Oils, Cream, But∣ter,
Marrow, farinaceous Substances
unfermented, as little Salt in the A∣liment
as possible, for Salt hardens.</P>
<P>6. From those two Causes of the
Laxity and Rigidity of the Fibres,
the Methodists an ancient Set of
Physicians deriv'd all Diseases of hu∣man
Bodies with a great deal of
Reason, for the Fluids derive their
Qualities from the Solids. There
<PB N="160" REF="190"/>
seems hardly any other Account to
be given of the different Animal Se∣cretions,
than the different Configu∣ration,
and Action of the solid
Parts, which from one Homogene∣ous
Liquor separate so many various
Fluids in an Animal Body, and I
am of Opinion, that in most cases
where the Juices are in a morbid
State, if one could suppose all the
unsound Juices taken away, and
sound Juices immediately transfus'd,
the Quality of the solid Parts re∣maining
the same, after many
Circulations the sound Juices would
grow morbid. The Methodists err'd
in so far as they consider'd the Dis∣ease
inhering only in the Vascular
Solids, and applied their Remedies
chiefly to them, not reflecting that
the Solids themselves can be changed
by working upon the Fluids.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<PB N="161" REF="191"/>
<HEAD>PROP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Causes and proper
Diet of Plethorick Constitutions.</P>
<P>The Diseases of the Fluids are first a
Plethora, or too great abundance of
laudable Juices, the Causes of which
are strong Chylopoetick Organs,
plenty of wholesome Diet, a middle
Age, sanguineous Temperament (of
which afterwards) Laziness or want
of muscular Motion, moist Air, Sup∣pression
of usual Evacuations. The
Effects are Impatience of Heat or La∣bour,
Extension of the greater Ves∣sels,
Compression of the lesser, Lace∣rations
upon small Causes, a Stoppage
of Circulation by too great a weight
upon the Heart, Suffocation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
the Remedies for this Constitution
are opposite to the Causes of it, spare
Diet, Exercise and proper Evacutions,
only it must be observ'd that Pletho∣rick
Bodies are not to be cur'd by
<PB N="162" REF="192"/>
long Abstinence; because in that case
the most liquid parts fly off, and the
grosser remain: Blood-letting re∣moves
a Symptom, but often in∣creases
the force of the Chylopoe∣tick
Organs, and consequently the
Disease.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PROP. V.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Symptoms and
proper Diet of sanguineous Consti∣tutions.</P>
<P>1. A sanguineous Constitution (in
the common Acceptation of the
word) that is of a Person who abounds
with Blood is different from a Ple∣thorick;
the common outward Sign
of such a Constitution is a florid
Appearance in the Countenance, a
Blueness and Fullness of the Veins,
Softness of the Flesh, a particular
vivid, fair, but not pale Colour of
the Skin, such a Constitution with
a great Appearance of Health is sub∣ject
to many Diseases.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="193"/>
2. The Blood as was observed,
Prop. V. Chap. II. consists of red
Globules swimming in a thin Li∣quor
call'd Serum, the red part is
smallest in quantity. The red Glo∣bules
are Elastick, and will break,
one red Globule into six small, and
then they will turn yellow, those
yellow Globules break into o∣thers
still smaller, and then they
grow more white and transparent; the
Vessels, which admit the smaller Glo∣bules,
cannot admit the greater with∣out
a Disease. Therefore as the Blood
passeth through narrower Channels,
the Redness disappears more and more.
All the Chyle is white, and acquires
this red Colour by Circulation. A
free and strong Projectile Motion of
the Blood must occasion a florid Ap∣pearance
upon the Skin in such
Constitutions, because a stronger
Motion forceth the red part into
more capillary Vessels. To which
likewise there is commonly another
<PB N="164" REF="194"/>
Cause that concurs, the greater Trans∣parency
of the Vessels occasioned by
the Thinness and Delicacy of their
Coats. That this is the Case of san∣guineous
Persons is plain, from their
great Veins appearing blue and trans∣parent
by the Colour of the Blood
in them.</P>
<P>3. Therefore such Persons seem to
be susceptible of Diseases, that de∣pend
upon a strong projectile Mo∣tion
of the Blood, and too great
Thinness and Delicacy of the Vessels;
by the first they are subject to In∣flammatory
Distempers, for the greater
Action or Reaction of the Fluids and
Solids produceth a greater Attrition,
to which Heat is proportional: This
great Attrition must produce a great
Propensity to the putrescent alkaline
Condition of the Fluids, and conse∣quently
to Suppuration: a stronger
projectile Motion of the Blood, must
likewise occasion greater Secretions,
and loss of liquid Parts; and from
<PB N="165" REF="195"/>
thence perhaps Spissitude and corea∣ceous
Concretions, which are always
found in Animals that die of too
strong a Circulation.</P>
<P>If the Vessels are in a state of too
great Rigidity so as not to yield, a
strong projectile Motion occasions
their Rupture and Haemorragies; es∣pecially
in the Lungs, where the
Blood is abundant; if the Vessels in∣stead
of breaking yield, it subjects
the Person to all the Inconveniences
of an erroneous Circulation, (that is,
when the Blood strays into the Vessels
destin'd to carry Serum or Lymph,
according to Prop. V. Chap. II.)
From whence will follow Obstructions
and Inflammations, and as the Thin∣ness
and Delicacy of the Vessels pro∣bably
reigns through the whole Sys∣tem,
it must affect the Glands and
Lymphatick, as well as the Blood
Vessels; and such Constitutions must
be subject to glandulous Tumours,
and Ruptures of the Lymphatick,

and all the Diseases thereon depen∣dent.</P>
<P>4. The natural Helps from Diet
are first Moderation in the quantity,
and all things which relax the Veins;
for what does so, prevents too vigo∣rous
a Motion through the Arteries:
Therefore relaxing and cooling are
proper Intentions in the Diet, only
where there are signs of too great a
Thinness in the Fluids. Subacid Sub∣stances
are proper, tho' they are a
little Astringent; for Persons who take
a great deal of Vinegar, abate their
florid Colour, which is the Disease
of such a Constitution.</P>
<P>For such a Diet the Reader is re∣fer'd
to the foregoing Chapter.</P>
<P>A Saline Constitution of the Fluids
is either Acid, Alkaline, or Muria∣tick,
as in the Sea-Scurvy: Of these in
their turns.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Symptoms, Cau∣ses,
and proper Diet of Acid Con∣stitutions.</P>
<P>1. It has been demonstrated b∣fore,
that the Juices of a sound Ani∣mal,
are neither Acid nor Alkaline,
by the Experiments mention'd
Chapter IV. All the Substances
Fluid, and Solid, of an Animal fed,
even with acescent Substances, yield
by fire, nothing but Alkaline Salts.
Those Experiments which endeavour
to shew the contrary, have been made
upon Animals, which had taken
much Sea-Salt, which is never totally
changed in an Animal Body. The
ingenious and learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> fed
a Sparrow with Bread four Days, in
which time it eat more than its own
weight, and yet there was no Acid
found in its Body or Excrements.
The reason of this is, that the vital
<PB N="168" REF="198"/>
Force of a sound Animal is capable
to transmute the Acid Substances it
takes in Aliment, into soft nutritious
animal Liquids by its vital Force (by
which is understood the summ of all
those Powers in an Animal Body,
which converts its Aliment into
Fluids of its own Nature) a Cow
fed with Trefoil, Daisies, Sorrel,
gives Milk, in which there is not
the least Acidity; but if this vital
Force is weak, it is insufficient to sub∣due
the Acidity of the Substances
taken by the Mouth. The Liquors,
which are made of fermented Plants,
as Wine and Malt Liquors standing
in a Heat not greater than that of
a human Body, turn sour; and so
they will in a human Body that has
not sufficient vital Force to change
them, which makes no more Alteration
in such Substances, than a Vessel
with the same degree of Heat and
Moisture. Thus weak Stomachs vo∣mit
up the Wine that they drink in
<PB N="169" REF="199"/>
too great Quantities to be digested,
in me form of Vinegar. Put Bread
into the Stomach of a dying Man,
and it will follow its own Nature,
and undergo the Alteration that is
merely the Effect of Heat. A weak
Stomach will turn Rye-Bread into
Vinegar, and a Plough-Man will
digest it. Mealy Substances ferment∣ed
turn sour, and unfermented be∣ing
mix'd with a small Quantity of
Water they turn viscid, and then
hard like Stones: accordingly given
to a weak Child they still retain
their Nature; for Bread will give
him the Cholick, and unfermented
farinaceous Substances will fill his
Belly with a viscous Humour.</P>
<P>2. As no Acid is naturally in an
Animal Body, but must be taken in
by the Mouth; so if it is not sub∣du'd
in the Passages of the Chyle,
it may get into the Blood; and if
there is not a sufficient Quantity of
Blood, and Strength of Circulation
<PB N="170" REF="200"/>
to subdue it, it may infect the
whole Mass of the Fluids; but this
is a morbid State. The Experi∣ments
made upon Chyle have never
discover'd any Acidity in it; but the
Subject of these Experiments has
been always the Chyle of healthy
Animals.</P>
<P>3. The first and principal Seat of
Acidity is the Stomach; this Quali∣ty
of the Chyle is in some measure
taken off in the <HI>Duodenum,</HI> and by the
Mixture of Bile with it, grows less in
the other Parts of the alimentary
Duct, and still less in the Thoracick
Duct, because great Quantities of
Animal Liquors have been mix'd with
it; but at last it may (as was said
before) infect the Blood: Thus it is
found by Experience, that the Sweat
is sometimes acid, which is a Sign
of Recovery after acute Distempers,
where the Blood was in the contra∣ry
alkalescent Disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="201"/>
4. The Antecedent Concomitants
and Effects of such a Constitution,
are Acids taken in too great Quan∣tities:
Sour Eructations, a craving Ap∣petite,
especially of terrestrial and ab∣sorbent
Substances, the Case of Girls
in the Green Sickness, Sourness in
the Stomach, Pain in the Stomach
(which tho' sometimes occasion'd by
an acrid Bile, this Cause may be
distinguish'd by the Absence of other
Symptoms) Colical Pains about the
Navel, the <HI>West-India</HI> dry Gripes are
perhaps occasion'd by the too great
Quantities of Acids, as Lime-juice in
Punch. The Colicks of Infants
proceed from Acidity, and the Air
in the Aliment expanding itself while
the Aliment ferments; for Oil of Vi∣triol
will throw the Stomach into
involuntary Contractions, Inactivity
and Change of Colour in the Bile;
for Acids change the Colour and
Consistence of it. Bile is the chief
Instrument of Digestion, and as was
<PB N="172" REF="202"/>
said before, <HI>Prop.</HI> V. <HI>Chap.</HI> I. can
attenuate the cheesy Substance in the
Stomach of a Calf, and render it
fluid; hence bilious Constitutions ea∣sily
digest Cheese, a sour Smell of
the Faeces (when the Bile is redun∣dant,
they smell cadaverous) acid
Sweats, Paleness of the Skin; for as
was observ'd before, taking much
Vinegar will make the Lips pale. It
is possible that Tumors in the Breasts
may be the Effect of Acidity in the
Milk, and Convulsions in Infants
may be occasion'd from Acidity pas∣sing
into the Blood, and affecting
the tender Fibres of the Brain. Some
Sorts of cutaneous Eruptions are oc∣casion'd
by feeding much on acid
unripe Fruits, and farinaceous Sub∣stances.</P>
<P>5. Acidity, as it is not the natu∣ral
State of the Animal Fluids, but
induc'd by Aliment, is to be cur'd
by Aliment, with the contrary Qua∣lities;
for which the Reader is re∣ferr'd
<PB N="173" REF="203"/>
to the foregoing Chapter. An∣ti-acid
Medicines are ineffectual with∣out
a Diet of the same Kind; all
Animal Diet is Alkalescent, especial∣ly
of such as feed upon other Ani∣mals,
as Infects, Fish; and especially
Shell-Fish. Acidity in the Infant
may be cur'd by a Flesh-Diet; in
the Nurse. There are a great many
anti-acid Vegetables which do not
easily ferment, but putrify, as all the
warm Anti-scorbuticks: Selery, As∣paragus,
Cabbage, Turnips, Carrots,
Onions, Leeks, Radishes, Mustard,
Eringo-Roots and Nettles, are An∣ti-acid.
In Cases of Acidity, Water is
the proper Drink, its Quality of re∣laxing
too much may be corrected
by boiling it with some Animal Sub∣stances,
as Ivory, Harts-horn: Absti∣nence
from fermented Liquors is ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>6. This Distemper is most inci∣dent
to Children, because of the De∣bility
of their Fibres and Milk-Diet,
<PB N="174" REF="204"/>
to such as lead a sedentary Life, to
those who take much Bread and
Wine, and vegetable Acids, to Girls
dispos'd to the Green Sickness, and
to Artificers who deal in the Prepa∣rations
of Acids, as Distillers, Dyers.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>To explain the Symptoms, Cau∣ses,
and proper Diet of Constituti∣ons,
which abound with a spontane∣ous
Alkali.</P>
<P>1. A Constitution opposite to the
former is that which abounds with a
spontaneous Alkali. No Animal un∣putrify'd
being burnt, yields any al∣kaline
Salt, but putrify'd yields a
volatile Alkali, therefore in a healthy
Animal no true Alkali is found; but
as an Animal degenerates from this
State, by such Diseases as increase
the Attrition and Heat of the Fluids,
the Animal Salts formerly benign
approach towards an alkaline Nature,
<PB N="175" REF="205"/>
Human Blood, when it is first let, is
mild, and will not make the Eye or
a fresh Wound smart. Let it stand
in a Degree of Heat equal to that of
a Human Body, it will grow in three
Days, fetid, the Salt of it volatile and
alkaline fermenting with Acids, the
Oil that remains volatile and rancid;
the Blood in the Vessels may at last
arrive at the same State, but must
pass thro' infinite Degrees, and be∣fore
it comes to the last, the Ani∣mal
will be destroyed. All Animal
Substances expos'd to the Air turn
Alkaline of their own accord, and
some Vegetables by Heat will not
turn acid but alkaline: Every Plant in
that State of Putrefaction by <HI>Prop.</HI>
III. <HI>Chap.</HI> I. is converted as it were
into an Animal Substance, by Chy∣mical
Trials yielding the same Con∣tents.</P>
<P>2. The Causes of such a Distem∣per,
is a Diet of alkalescent Substan∣ces.
If a Woman should live upon
<PB N="176" REF="206"/>
Vegetables, Bread, and fermented
Liquors, her Milk would be acescent
or ready to turn sour; if only on
Animal Food her Milk would be
apt to turn fetid and putrid, but not
sour.</P>
<P>If it was possible to take Mustard
in great Quantities, it would quick∣ly
bring the Blood into this alkaline
State, and destroy the Animal; the
warm antiscorbutical Plants taken in
Quantities will occasion stinking
Breath, and corrupt the Blood. All
Animals that live upon other Ani∣mals
have their Juices more alkales∣cent,
than such as live upon Vegeta∣bles,
and for that Reason perhaps
Fishes have this Quality more than
terrestrial Animals; for in the open
Air they putrify sooner, by what
was said <HI>Prop.</HI> I. <HI>Chap.</HI> IV. An Ani∣mal
with a strong vital Force of Di∣gestion
will turn Acids into Animal
Substances; but if its Food be in∣tirely
alkalescent, its Juices will be
<PB N="177" REF="207"/>
more so. No Person is able to sup∣port
a Diet of Flesh and Water with∣out
Acids, as Salt, Vinegar, and
Bread, without falling into a putrid
Fever. If his Diet consisted of Snails,
Fish, especially their Livers, Shell-Fish,
Vipers, ravenous Birds, as some
who feed upon Insects and alka∣lescent
Vegetables, the Effect would
happen sooner. Eggs and <HI>Spanish</HI>
Wines, taken in great Quantities with∣out
Exercise, will occasion a Fever. A∣bundance
of good Blood and laudable
Juices disposeth towards this alkales∣cent
State. Likewise long Abstinence,
(by which the Fluids are depriv'd of
a Dilution of the cooling Emulsion
of fresh Chyle. See <HI>Prop.</HI> VIII. <HI>Chap.</HI>
II.) great Strength of the Bowels, and
a right State and Abundance of Bile.
Bile is an anti-acid. Another Cause
is a vigorous Action of the Vessels,
through which the Juices circulate,
which is the Reason strong healthy
and young People are more in peril
<PB N="178" REF="208"/>
by pestilential Fevers, than the Weak
and Old.</P>
<P>Violent Animal Motion produ∣ceth
this alkaline State. Two hard
Bones rubb'd hard against one ano∣ther,
or with a File, produce a fetid
Smell. It is possible to produce a
Gangrene by strong Friction, and
yet Stagnation of the Fluids turns
them putrid.</P>
<P>The Effects of such an alkalescent
State in any great Degree, are Thirst,
and a Dejection of Appetite, which pu∣trid
Things occasion more than any
other; (those who are troubled with
Acidity have often a bad Digestion,
but a craving Appetite) nidorose e∣ructations,
which are different from a∣cid,
Foulness of the Tongue and
Palate, a bitter and hot Taste in the
Mouth, Thirst, Sickness, Loathing,
bilious Vomitings and Dejections of
a cadaverous Smell, iliacal Pains with
Heat. These are the Effects of it
in the alimentary Diet. Such a
<PB N="179" REF="209"/>
State dissolves the Blood, and dispo∣seth
it towards Putrefaction, hinders
Nutrition; for no Chicken can be
hatch'd of a rotten Egg, the Blood
turning acrimonious corrodes the
Vessels producing Hemorrhages, Pus∣tules
red, lead-colour'd, black and
gangrenous, and almost all Diseases
of the inflammatory Kind.</P>
<P>3. The Aliment of such Persons
ought to be acescent Substances, as
Bread, Vinegar, such as are describ'd
in the foregoing Chapter. Acids
keep Animal Substances from Putre∣faction;
for neither Blood, Flesh or
Fat will putrify in Vinegar, or sour
Wine: The Effect of the strongest
Acids, even Oil of Vitriol in putrid
Fevers, is known by Experience, in
which your alkaline Spirits must be
hurtful, farinaceous Things, especial∣ly
such as are made of Oats, are
proper as having an acescent Quali∣ty;
it is a common Mistake that
People in such a State should for∣bear
<PB N="180" REF="210"/>
Wine. Thin Wines, as Rhenish,
Moselle mix'd with Water are pro∣per
in a Fever. But when the Dis∣temper
is attended with great Heat,
Milk mixed with Water is the pro∣perest
Drink. The properest Sea∣soning
is Salt-petre; Sea-salt creates
Thirst, Water is the only Diluent;
but as it has no Acidity in it, it is
better mix'd with Limon, or with
the Rob or Jelly of some acid Fruit,
sometimes the demulcent Aliment
mention'd <HI>Prop.</HI> IV. of the foregoing
Chapter, will be of great Use.</P>
<P>The muriatick Scurvy induced
commonly by too great Quantity
of Sea-salt, and common among
Mariners, is rather an artificial than
a natural Disease, spontaneous only
in few who have a great Disposition
towards it. Its common Symptoms
are a saline Taste in the Spittle, Itch∣ing
and red Erosions of the Skin,
great Thirst, Dryness of the Skin, a
lixivial Urine sometimes with a fatty
<PB N="181" REF="211"/>
Substance like a thin Skin a-top,
Relief from watery and acid Sub∣stances.
The Cure of this Distem∣per
lies in a Diet of fresh unsalted
Things, watery Liquors acidulated,
farinaceous emollient Substances, sour
Milk, Butter Milk, acid Fruits, and
avoiding of the hot Antiscorbuticks
of the Mustard Kind, the Rule of
Diet is not much different from that
in the alkaline Scurvy before men∣tion'd.</P>
<P>5. It is of great Importance to
know whether cutaneous Distempers
proceed from an acid or alkaline
Cause, because, according to the dif∣ference
of the Cause, there must be
quite opposite Methods of Cure;
they may be distinguish'd first by the
difference of the Diet that occasion'd
them, crude Aliment, farinaceous Sub∣stances,
unripe Fruits, and other Aces∣cents
will sometimes produce the Scur∣vy
and Itch, and even Leprosies de∣pending
on the same cause, in which
<PB N="182" REF="212"/>
volatile Salts, and such as are taken
from Animal Substances are indica∣ted.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> From the Absence of
the concomitant Symptoms of the
one, and the other: in the acid Acri∣mony,
there is not Thirst, Heat nor
so great a Dejection of Appetite as
in the Alkaline. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Ero∣sions
of the Skin are not of so deep
a Colour in the Acid as Alkaline. In
general, an Attention to the Symp∣toms
before enumerated may be a
Guide to the Diet.</P>
<P>6. Another Constitution of the
Fluids of a Human Body, may be
properly call'd Glutinous or Phleg∣matick:
Phlegm amongst the An∣cients
signified a cold viscous Hu∣mour
contrary to the Etymology of
the Word which comes from <ADD><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></ADD>,
to burn; but amongst them there
were two Sorts of Phlegm, cold and
hot. A cold Tumor they call'd sim∣ply
Phlegmonem; when it came from
glutinous Blood, they call'd it Phleg∣monem
Phlegmenodem.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="213"/>
7. Phlegm or Pituite is a Sort of
semi-fluid, it being so far solid, that
one Part draws along several other
Parts adhering to it, which doth not
happen in a perfect Fluid, and yet
no Part will draw the whole Mass,
as happens in a perfect Solid.</P>
<P>8. The Pituite or Mucus secern'd
in the Nose, Mouth, Palate, Stomach,
Intestines, and Wind-Pipe, is not an
excrementitious but a laudable Hu∣mour,
necessary for defending those
Parts from which it is secern'd, from
Excoriations, as happens in the Nose,
when the Pituite is too thin. The
Want of it in the Wind-Pipe occa∣sions
Hoarseness, in the Gullet and
Difficulty of Swallowing. The Pituite
defends the Intestines from the Acri∣mony
of the Ingesta, and lubricates
the Extremities of the Joints. There∣fore
those are mistaken who imagine
that Phlegm cannot be too much
purg'd off; but when the Phlegm is
either too viscous, or separates in too
<PB N="184" REF="214"/>
great a Quantity, it brings the Body
into a morbid State; this viscous
Phlegm seems to be the vitrious Pi∣tuite
of the Ancients.</P>
<P>9. The first Seat of it is the ali∣mentary
Duct where it creates Cru∣dity,
Dejection of Appetite, a Sense
of Repletion and Sickness; for it
hinders the natural Contraction of
the Fibres, and that Sense of Irrita∣tion
which produceth Hunger. A
Sensation of Fullness without eating
is a sure Sign of a phlegmatick Sto∣mach.
In the Intestines it occasions
a Tumor of the Belly, with an Atro∣phy
in the rest of the Body; for
the viscous Crust stops the Entry of
the Chyle into the Lacteals. The
Case of rickety Children. In the
Body it often affects the Lungs,
Phlegm may be so concocted in the
Lungs by the Evaporation of its
most liquid Parts as to shut up the
Passages of the Bronchea, and it makes
Paleness in the Skin; for as it was
<PB N="185" REF="215"/>
observ'd before, our Aliment in the
form of Chyle before it circulates
with the Blood is whitish, by the
Force of Circulation, it runs through
all the intermediate Colours till it
settles in an intense Red; as much
as the Force of Circulation is defi∣cient,
so much will the Blood fall
short of that florid Colour, and Per∣sons
in that Condition are call'd
Leucophlegmatick; from this Phlegm
proceed white cold Tumors, Visci∣dity,
and consequently Immeability
of the Juices; hence Lethargies in
old People.</P>
<P>10. The Causes of this phlegma∣tick
Constitution are, <HI>First,</HI> Viscid
Aliment as of unripe Fruits, farina∣ceous
Substances unfermented and
taken in great Quantities. The Flowers
of Grains mix'd with Water will
make a sort of Glue. Meals have
an Oil in them which makes their
Parts adhere. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Great Loss
or Want of Blood which is a natu∣ral
<PB N="186" REF="216"/>
Soap, preserving itself and the
Aliment from Coagulation by con∣stant
Motion. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Weakness and
Indigestion in the alimentary Duct
which leaves the Aliment viscous.
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> A Defect or bad Consti∣tution
of the Bile (which is the chief
Resolvent of the Aliment) phlegma∣tick
and bilious Constitutions are
opposite. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> Dissipation of the
most fluid Parts by Heat or some
great Evacuation, therefore profuse
Sweats, and Fluxes of Urine dispose
towards this Constitution by thicken∣ing
the Phlegm. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> Stagna∣tion
from the Debility of Instru∣ments
of Excretion for if the Pi∣tuite
stagnates, it must grow viscid
from Heat. These are the Causes
and Symptoms of a phlegmatick
cold Constitution, but Spissitude at∣tended
with Heat grows inflamma∣tory.</P>
<P>11. The Symptoms point to the
Cure. All the Methods of atte∣nuating,
<PB N="187" REF="217"/>
mention'd <HI>Chap.</HI> V. <HI>Prop.</HI> IV.
well fermented Bread, and well fer∣mented
Liquors, Fermentation de∣stroys
the Viscidity of farinaceous
Substances. High season'd Aliment
is proper for Phlegmaticks. Spices,
Onions, Garlick, dissolve Viscidity.
Water impregnated with some stimu∣lating
Substance which both dilutes
and attenuates. Hot Mineral Wa∣ters
are the best Dissolvers of Phlegm.
All Sorts of Nourishment which pro∣mote
Heat, and a vigorous Motion
of the Blood, and for that Reason
Broths made of the most volatile and
alkalescent Parts of Animals.</P>
<P>12. A Disease opposite to this
Spissitude is too great Fluidity, the
Symptoms of which are Excess of
Animal Secretions as of Perspiration,
Swear, Urine, Liquid, Dejectures,
Leanness, Weakness, and Thirst. The
Methods in such a Case must be op∣posite
to the former. Farinaceous
Substances, and watery Liquors, un∣fermented
<PB N="188" REF="218"/>
Gellies of Animal and Ve∣getable
Substances, all such Things
as are describ'd <HI>Prop.</HI> IV. <HI>Chap.</HI> V.</P>
<P>13. Another Constitution is the oily
or fat; Animal Fat is a Sort of am∣phibious
Substance, it is scissile like
a Solid, resolvable by Heat not greater
than what is incident to Human
Bodies, circumscrib'd and contain'd
in proper Vessels, like a Fluid. The
Symptoms of this Constitution are
too manifest to want a Description,
it co-incides often with the pletho∣rick
and phlegmatick Constitutions
above describ'd. It is but one Spe∣cies
of Corpulency, for there may
be Bulk without Fat, from the great
Quantity of muscular Flesh, the Case
of robust People. An Animal in the
Course of hard Labour seems to be
nothing, but Vessels, Bones and mus∣cular
Flesh. Let the same Animal
continue long in Rest, it will per∣haps
double in Weight and Bulk.
This Superaddition is nothing but
<PB N="189" REF="219"/>
Fat or Oil, and in this Sense an A∣nimal
perhaps never arrives at its full
Growth.</P>
<P>14. The common Causes of this
Distemper are a particular, and per∣haps
a gentilitious Disposition of Bo∣dy,
which seems to consist in the Chy∣lopoetick
or Organs of the first Di∣gestion
being strong, and the Fibres
of the circulating Vessels, especially
those about the <HI>Panniculus carnosus</HI>
being lax, according to the Doctrine
of the second Chapter. By the Ac∣tion
of the Fibres of the Vessels up∣on
the Fluids the oily Parts of the
Chyle are intimately mix'd with the
Blood, which by <HI>Prop.</HI> III. <HI>Chap.</HI> II.
will swim a top of it several Hours
after Repast; when this Action is not
strong enough, and the Chyle ex∣tremely
copious, perhaps the thicker
Oil is never entirely subdu'd; some
Sorts of cramm'd Fowl have always
a milky Juice swimming a-top of
their Blood. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Quantities of
<PB N="190" REF="220"/>
oily Nourishment, Milk, Butter, and
oily fermented Liquors. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> All
Things which occasion Coldness in
the Skin so as to stop Perspiration,
by which the oily Parts are con∣geal'd,
which Heat resolves and at∣tenuates.
The Inhabitants of cold
moist Countries are generally more
fat than those of warm and dry; but
the most common Cause is too great
a Quantity of Food, and too small
a Quantity of Motion, in plain <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
Gluttony, and Laziness. I am
of Opinion that spare Diet and La∣bour
will keep Constitutions, where
this Disposition is the strongest, from
being fat. You may see in an Ar∣my
forty thousand Foot-Soldiers with∣out
a fat Man amongst them; and I
dare affirm that by Plenty and Rest,
twenty of the forty shall grow fat.</P>
<P>15. The Oil in Animals is ne∣cessary
for many Purposes; in all for
Motion, in some for Nourishment;
such accumulate Fat in the Summer
<PB N="191" REF="221"/>
which serves to refresh the Blood in
the Penury of Aliment during the
Winter, and for that purpose some
Animals have a quadruple Omen∣tum.
But the too great abundance
of Fat subjects Human Constitutions
to the following Inconveniences.</P>
<P>16. <HI>First,</HI> It hinders the Motion
of the Joints by making them more
heavy by filling the Spaces, occupy'd
by the Muscles when they contract
and swell. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It subjects them
to all the Diseases depending upon a
defective projectile Motion of the
Blood; for the Blood flows through
the Vessels by the Excess of the Force
of the Heart above the incumbent
Pressure, which in fat People is ex∣cessive;
and as want of a due Quan∣tity
of Motion of the Fluids increas∣eth
Fat, the Disease is the Cause of
itself. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To Suppurations, of
which the <HI>Membrana adiposa</HI> is the
chief Seat. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> To danger in
inflammatory Distempers, a Fever re∣solves
<PB N="192" REF="222"/>
many Things which stagnate,
and amongst others the Fat, which
being mix'd with the Blood turns
volatile, and occasions an Acrimony
much more dangerous than the sa∣line;
for Salts can be diluted with
Water which Oils cannot. That the
Fat is dissolv'd by Fevers, is evident
from the great loss of Fat which
People undergo in Fevers. Amongst
those and many other bad Effects of
this oily Constitution, there is one
Advantage that such of them who
arrive to an advanc'd Age, are not
subject to the Stricture and Hard∣ness
of Fibres, the Effect of old
Age.</P>
<P>17. The Causes above mention'd
lead directly to the Cure; as it is the
Product of Gluttony and Laziness,
Exercise and Abstinence is the Anti∣dote;
it has been observ'd that a fe∣verish
Heat resolves Fat, and there∣fore
what produceth this Effect in a
small Degree so as not to endanger,
<PB N="193" REF="223"/>
the Life of the Patient, must be pro∣per,
such are all acrid and stimulat∣ing
Substances. Salt, Pepper, Gar∣lick,
Onions, Vinegar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taken
in Quantities will produce a mo∣mentary
Fever. Salt taken in great
Quantities will reduce an Animal Bo∣dy
to the great Extremity of Aridity
or Dryness. The Ancients were so
sensible of the Force of Stimulating
in this Case, that the celebrated Re∣medy
against Fat was a certain Quan∣tity
of the Vinegar of Squills taken
every Morning; for the same Reason,
saponaceous Substances, as Sugar,
Honey, the Juices of ripe Fruits, Pot
Herbs with Abstinence from fat
Meat, and even an entire Milk-Diet
by its Thinness are very effectual.
Unfermented watery Liquors are hurt∣ful
only as they relax, but on the other
hand Quantities of oily fermented
Liquors commonly increase the Dis∣ease.
All Things which promote the
Animal Secretions, especially Sweat,
<PB N="194" REF="224"/>
and insensible Perspiration, and for
that Purpose even Water taken in
Quantities is sometimes useful. Salts
mix'd with Fat harden it, and acid
Things congeal Oil; Spirit of Nitre
will turn Oil of Olives into a Sort
of fatty Substance; but Acids may be
us'd as stimulating. If acid Things
were us'd only as Coolers, they would
not be so proper in this Case, in
which it is necessary to keep up a
considerable Degree of Heat; but
for their foremention'd Qualities they
are strongly indicated in the inflam∣matory
Distempers of fat People,
where the Oil disposeth to a rancid
Putrefaction; but Abstinence being
the chief dietetick Method of pre∣venting
or curing the Disease, leads
me to say somewhat of the Quantity
of Aliment in general.</P>
<P>18. By <HI>Prop.</HI> VIII. <HI>Chap.</HI> II. The
frequent Repetition of Aliment is
necessary, not only for repairing the
Fluids and Solids, but to keep the
<PB N="195" REF="225"/>
Fluids from the putrescent alkaline
State, which they acquire by constant
Attrition without being diluted; from
whence it follows, <HI>First</HI> That long
Abstinence may be the Parent of
great Diseases, especially in hot bi∣lious
Constitutions, and extremely
painful to acid Constitutions by the
uneasy Sensation it creates in the Sto∣mach.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Quantity
of Aliment necessary to keep the A∣nimal
in a due State of Vigour ought
to be divided into Meals at proper
Intervals in the natural Day, by
which Method neither the chylopoe∣tick
Organs, nor the Blood-Vessels
are overcharg'd, nor the Juices de∣priv'd
too long of fresh Recruits of
Chyle. <HI>Sanctorius</HI> confirms this Ma∣xim
in his Doctrine of Perspira∣tion.</P>
<P>19. The great Secret of Health
is keeping the Fluids in due Propor∣tion
to the Capacity and Strength of
the Channels through which they
<PB N="196" REF="226"/>
pass; but the Danger is less when
the Quantity of the Fluid is too
small; than when it is too great, for
a smaller Quantity of Fluid will pass
where a larger cannot, but not con∣trariwise.</P>
<P>20. When the Quantity of the
Fluid is too small, the elastick Pow∣er
of the Canal (in which Life con∣sists)
exerts itself with too great a
Strength upon the Fluid. In which
Case there must follow too great a
Dissipation of the Fluid, Dryness
and a gradual Decay. In too great
Repletion either the elastick Force
of the Tube is totally destroy'd; or
if it continue proportional to the
Degree of Extension like a Bow too
strongly drawn, it throws the Fluid
with too great a projectile Force
forward through the Vessels, and
back upon the Heart, and subjects
the Animal to all the Diseases de∣pending
upon a Plethory, and may
bring it into immediate Danger.
<PB N="197" REF="227"/>
Therefore the Diseases depending up∣on
Repletion are more acute and
dangerous than those that depend
upon the contrary State. The In∣stances
of Longevity are chiefly a∣mongst
the Abstemious. Abstinence
in Extremity will prove a mortal
Disease, but the Experiments of it
are very rare.</P>
<P>21. Such as have an imperfect
Circulation through any Organ of
the Body, should never charge their
Vessels with too great a Quantity of
Chyle, this was observ'd <HI>Prop.</HI> II.
<HI>Chap.</HI> II. of the Lungs, and is equal∣ly
true in any other Case, as in Head∣aches,
which eating little relieves,
and eating and drinking much occa∣sion.
A Sensation of Drousiness,
Oppression, Heaviness and Lassitude
are Signs of a too plentiful Meal,
especially in young People.</P>
<P>22. The Measure of insensible
Perspiration discover'd by weighing
is the best Rule of Diet; therefore
<PB N="198" REF="228"/>
in fat People the Use of vaporose or
perspirable Food, and exercise (both
which increase Perspiration) are pro∣per.</P>
<P>23. The Constitution of the Air
disposeth the Inhabitants of one
Country more to be fat than that of
another. <HI>Sanctorius's</HI> Experiment of
Perspiration being to the other Se∣cretions
as 5 to 3 does not hold in
this Country, except in the hottest
Time of Summer; so that the Acti∣on
of <HI>Paduan</HI> Air in promoting Per∣spiration
the whole Year round, is
equal to ours in the Month of <HI>Au∣gust.</HI></P>
<P>24. From the foregoing Doctrine,
a common Case both of fat and lean
Men having great Stomachs may be
accounted for: by the last having a
great Perspiration, and some of the
perspirable Matter in the first not
sufficiently attenuated, stopping at
the Surface of the Skin, and as it
were carried about him. Hunger is
<PB N="199" REF="229"/>
only a Warning of the Vessels being
in such a State of Vacuity as to re∣quire
a fresh Supply of Aliment, af∣ter
Secretions, the Vessels of the fat
and lean Man are equally empty; for
the Fat is as much out of the Thread
of Circulation as what is evaporated,
and perhaps the Fat in that Case
becomes like a morbid Excrescence,
requiring a superfluous Nutrition.</P>
<P>25. Infants and old People sup∣port
Abstinence worst. The first
from the Quantity of Aliment con∣sum'd
in Accretion, the last from
their Weakness, and the small Quan∣tity
of Aliment taken at once. The
Middle-aged support it the best, be∣cause
of the oily Parts abounding in
the Blood.</P>
<P>26. From the foregoing Princi∣ples
follow naturally the Hippocrati∣cal
Rules of Diet in Fevers, of giv∣ing
more or less, more thick, or more
thin Aliment, according to the fore∣seen
time of the Duration of the Fe∣ver;
<PB N="200" REF="230"/>
for Example, in an Ephemera
none, because of its Termination in
one Day, in a Fever of four Days
Duration less than in one of eight.
And as the Fever comes to its
Height still subtracting from the
Quantity of Aliment, and making it
more diluent and thin.</P>
<P>27. We come now to what we
may call the earthy or atrabilarian
Constitution, where the spirituous
and most fluid Parts of the Blood
are dissipated, that is the Spirit, Wa∣ter
and subtile Oil so much evapo∣rated,
as to leave the Salts, Earth,
and grosser Oil in too great a Pro∣portion.
The Blood grows darkish
and thick, such a Constitution the
Ancients call'd Atrabilarian or melan∣cholick:
Melancholy, signifying in
<HI>Greek,</HI> black Gall; whether there be
any such Humour as black Gall, is
only a Dispute about Words. <HI>Hip∣pocrates</HI>
gave such an Humour this
Name, and that is sufficient; besides
<PB N="201" REF="231"/>
it is matter of fact, that in the Ex∣tremity
of this Disease, the Gall it∣self
will turn of a blackish Colour,
and the Blood verge towards a pitchy
Consistence.</P>
<P>28. The Signs of a Tendency to
such a State, are Darkness or Lividi∣ty
of the Countenance, Dryness of
the Skin, Leanness, a penetrating
quick Genius, a slow Pulse and Re∣spiration.
The Causes of it are all
such as expel the most volatile Parts
of the Blood, and fix the Residue:
Great Applications of the Mind to
one Object, either such as produce
Sadness, or great Joy, both which
equally dissipate the Spirits, and im∣moderate
Exercise in hot Air with un∣quench'd
Thirst: Aliments of hard
Digestion, as dry'd and salted Flesh,
unripe Fruits, farinaceous Substances
unfermented, and likewise immode∣rate
Use of spirituous Liquors.</P>
<P>The Effects of such a vapid and
viscous Constitution of Blood, are
<PB N="202" REF="232"/>
Stagnation, Obstructions, Acrimo∣ny,
Putrefactions, Viscidity, and im∣perfect
Secretion of the Gall, a de∣fective
Circulation, especially in the
lateral Branches destined to separate
the more fluid Parts, and therefore
viscous, and sparing Secretions in
the Glands: The Blood moving too
slowly through the celiack and me∣senterick
Arteries, produce various
Complaints in the lower Bowels and
Hypochondres; from whence such
Persons are call'd Hypochondriack:
Such as Sensation of Weight, Anxie∣ty
and Repletion, a bad Digestion;
from whence different Kinds of Ali∣ment
acquire such a State as they
affect of their own Nature, acescent,
if the Diet is of acid Vegetables,
and alkaline or nidorose, if of Ani∣mal
Substances, especially Fat, which
remains rancid so as the Spittle will
sometimes flame in the Fire. This
Indigestion proceeds from the Inac∣tivity
of the Gall, which likewise oc∣casions
<PB N="203" REF="233"/>
a Constipation of the Belly,
and a Difficulty of being purg'd.
The Urine is sometimes limpid,
sometimes thick, which latter is of∣ten
a Sign of Recovery. The Ob∣struction
of the Pituite in the lower
Belly, forceth it upon the salivary
Glands, and produceth Spitting.</P>
<P>29. Such a State of the Fluids at
last affects the tender capillary Ves∣sels
of the Brain by the Viscidity and
Immeability of the Matter impacted
in them, and disorders the Imagi∣nation,
and at last produceth Cor∣ruption
in the Bowels of the lower
Belly.</P>
<P>30. It is plain, that the Removal
of such a Disease is not to be at∣tempted
by active Remedies, any
more than a Thorn in the Flesh, or
pitchy Matter adhering to a Thread
of Silk is to be taken away by Vio∣lence;
what is viscid, ought to be
gently attenuated, diluted and carried
off. That all Substances, which do
<PB N="204" REF="234"/>
heat, will still dissipate the fluid Parts
more, and consequently increase the
Disease. Therefore Water impregnat∣ed
with some penetrating Salt, is
found to have great Effects in this
Distemper. The Diet ought to be
opposite to the particular Acrimony,
whether acid or alkaline, which it is
easy to guess at by N<SUP>o</SUP>. 5. of this
Proposition. It ought to be demul∣cent,
in both Cases light, and of ea∣sy
Digestion, moistening and resol∣vent
of the Bile; of such Nature are
vegetable Soaps, as Honey, and the
Juices of ripe Fruits, some of the
cooling, lactescent, papescent Plants,
as Cichory, Letuce, Dandelion, which
are found effectual in hot Countries.
The Diet proper for all the Intentions
in this Case, the Reader may see in
the foregoing Chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="part">
<PB N="205" REF="235"/>
<HEAD>PROP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>To draw a few general Inferences
from the foregoing Doctrine.</P>
<P>From the Doctrine of this short
Essay, it is as easy to determine the
Rules of Diet in the different natu∣ral
States, as in the different morbid
States of a Human Body.</P>
<P>1. By <HI>Prop.</HI> VII. <HI>Chap.</HI> II. Infan∣cy
and Childhood demand thin co∣pious
nourishing Aliment, such as
lengthens their Fibres without break∣ing
or hardening, because of their
Weakness and State of Accretion.
Milk has all those Qualities.</P>
<P>2. By <HI>Prop.</HI> IV. <HI>Chap.</HI> II. The So∣lidity,
Quantity and Strength of the
Aliment is to be proportion'd to the
Labour or Quantity of muscular
Motion, which in Youth is greater
than any other Age, upon which Ac∣count
a strong and solid Diet would
seem to be indicated; but as that
<PB N="206" REF="236"/>
Age is still in a State of Accretion,
their Diet ought still to be emollient,
and relaxing, copious, and without
Acrimony.</P>
<P>3. The Diet of a Human Crea∣ture
full grown, and in the State of
Manhood ought to be solid, with a
sufficient Degree of Tenacity, with∣out
Acrimony, their chief Drink Wa∣ter
cold, because in such a State it
has its own natural Spirit and Air,
(which Heat destroys) with a Quanti∣ty
of fermented Liquors propor∣tion'd
to their natural Constitutions.</P>
<P>4. The Course of the Fluids
through the vascular Solids, and the
common Animal Functions without
any Violence, must in length of
Time harden the Fibres, abolish ma∣ny
of the Canals, and make the So∣lids
grow together; from whence
Dryness, Weakness, Immobility, De∣bility
of the vital Force both of the
first and second Digestion. Loss of
Teeth, Depravation of Mastication,
<PB N="207" REF="237"/>
the Condition of old Age, which
therefore demands a Diet resembling
that of Childhood often repeated, but
not so copious in Proportion to the
Bulk, emollient and diluting.</P>
<P>5. From the Doctrine of the fifth
Chapter, it is likewise easy to de∣termine
the Inconveniences arising
from the Excess of any one sort of
Diet. Too much Sea-salt produceth
Thirst, Hoarseness, Acrimony in the
Serum (which destroys its soft nutri∣tious
Quality) Erosion of the small
Fibres, Pains, and all the Symptoms
of the muriatick Scurvy.</P>
<P>6. Acids taken in too great Quan∣tities,
especially such as are austere,
as unripe Fruits, produce too great a
Stricture of the Fibres, incrassate and
coagulate the Fluids; from whence
Pains, Rheumatism and Gout, Pale∣ness,
Itch, and other Eruptions of
the Skin: Substances extremely stip∣tick
are hurtful to the Nerves, and
occasion Palsies.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="238"/>
7. Spices in too great Quantities
occasion Thirst; Dryness and Heat,
quicken the Pulse, and accelerate the
Motion of the Blood, dissipate the
Fluids; from whence Leanness, Pains
in the Stomach, Loathings, and Fe∣vers.</P>
<P>8. Strong Liquors, especially in∣flammable
Spirits, taken in great
Quantities, intoxicate, constringe, har∣den,
dry, and stimulate the Fibres,
and coagulate the Fluids. They cor∣rode
and destroy the inward Coat of
the Stomach and Intestines, and if
Digestion be a Putrefaction, Spirits
must by their natural Quality hinder
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Chiselton's</HI> Anatomy.</NOTE> they produce Debility, Flatu∣lency,
Obstructions, especially in
the Liver, Fevers, Leucophlegmacy,
and Dropsies, as by their stimulat∣ing
they raise the Spirits for a Mo∣ment,
to which succeeds a propor∣tional
Depression; they create a Ha∣bit
<PB N="209" REF="239"/>
and Necessity of continuing the
same Course, and increasing the
Quantity. Liquors in the Act of
Fermentation, as Must and new Ale,
are apt to produce Spasms in the
Stomach, Cholick and Diarrhaeas.</P>
<P>9. A Diet of viscid Aliment creates
Flatulency and Crudities in the Sto∣mach,
Obstructions in the small
Vessels of the Intestines, in the
Mouths of the Lacteals and Glands,
Tumors and Hardness of the Belly,
Coldness, Paleness of the Skin, and
Viscidity in the Fluids.</P>
<P>10. A Diet of oily Nourishment
relaxeth the Solids, and particular∣ly
the Stomach and the Intestines,
(Monks who take a great deal of Oil
are subject to intestinal Hernias) it
creates nidorose Eructations, Loath∣ings,
Oily and bitter Vomitings, ob∣structs
the capillary Vessels by hin∣dering
the Entrance of the watery
and fluid Part, with which it will not
mix; it creates Thirst and Inflamma∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="240"/>
11. A constant Adherence to one
sort of Diet, may have bad Effects
on any Constitution. Nature has
provided a great Variety of Nou∣rishment
for Human Creatures, and
furnish'd us with Appetites to desire,
and Organs to digest them (there is
a most curious Bill of Fair in Sir
<HI>Hans Sloan's</HI> Natural History of <HI>Ja∣maica)</HI>
as Aliments have different
Qualities; a constant Adherence to
one Sort, may make the Constitu∣tion
verge to some of the Extremes
mention'd in this Chapter; for heal∣thy
People, <HI>Celsus's</HI> Rule I. Chap. I.
is a good one, <HI>Sanus homo qui bene
valet &amp; suae spontis est, nullis obliga∣re
se Legibus debet, nullum cibi genus
fugere quo populus utitur, interdum in
couvivio esse, interdum ab eo se absti∣nere,
modo plus, modo amplius assumere,</HI>
&amp;c. The Sense of the whole Pas∣sage,
is, That a healthy Man under
his own Government, ought not to tie
himself up to strict Rules, nor to ab∣stain
<PB N="211" REF="241"/>
from any sort of Food in com∣mon
Use, that he ought sometimes
to feast, sometimes to fast, some∣times
to sleep, sometimes to watch
more than ordinary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An un∣erring
Regularity is almost impracti∣cable,
and the swerving from it,
when it is grown habitual, dange∣rous;
for every unusual thing in a
Human Body becomes a Stimulus,
as Wine, or Flesh-Meat to one not
us'd to them; therefore <HI>Celsus's</HI> Rule
with the proper moral Restrictions,
is a good one for People in Health,
and even in Persons diseas'd in any
of the Senses of this Chapter, as too
strict, too lax, acid and bilious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
A constant Adherence to one Sort of
Diet, may carry the Case beyond a
Cure to the contrary Extreme.</P>
<P>12. General Rules about Diet,
without Regard to particular Consti∣tutions,
are absurd.</P>
<P>13. That with regard to diffe∣rent
Constitutions, the common Dis∣tinction
<PB N="212" REF="242"/>
of Diet into Vegetable
with Water, and Animal with fer∣mented
Liquors, is not proper and
compleat. <HI>First,</HI> Because in the E∣numeration
of Constitutions in this
Chapter, there is not one that can
be limited and restricted by such a
Distinction, nor can perhaps the
same Person in different Circumstan∣ces
be properly confin'd to one or
the other. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Because a ve∣getable
Diet is not characteriz'd, there
is not a general alimentary Quality
in which all Vegetables agree; there
are Vegetables, acid, alkaline, cool∣ing,
hot, relaxing, astringent, acrid,
and mild, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Useful or hurtful, ac∣cording
to the different Constituti∣ons
to which they are apply'd, there
may be a stronger Broth made of
Vegetables than any Gravy-soup.</P>
<P>14. As Flesh-Diet is generally al∣kalescent,
and many Vegetables are
acid and cooling; People of hot bi∣lious
Constitutions find themselves
<PB N="213" REF="243"/>
extremely well in a vegetable Diet
and Water, and the same Persons
perhaps had enjoy'd their Health as
well with a Mixture of Animal Diet
qualify'd with a sufficient Quantity of
Acescents, as Bread, Vinegar, and
fermented Liquors.</P>
<P>15. The Oil of most Vegeta∣bles
in which their nutritious Qua∣lity
chiefly consists, seems not to
be so hard of Digestion as that of
Animals; fat Meat is harder to di∣gest
than the most oily Plant taken
as Aliment: Sick People could not
take so great a Quantity of melted
Fat, as they can of Oil of sweet Al∣monds.</P>
<P>16. Animal Substances are more
nourishing, and more easily transmu∣table
into Animal Juices, than Vege∣table,
and therefore a vegetable Diet
is more proper for some Constituti∣ons,
as being less nourishing.</P>
<P>17. As the Qualities of Plants are
more various than those of Animal
<PB N="214" REF="244"/>
Substances, a Diet of some Sorts of
Vegetables may be more effectual in
the Cure of some chronical Distem∣pers,
than an Animal Diet.</P>
<P>18. The fibrous or vascular Parts
of Vegetables seem scarce changeable
in the Alimentary Duct. The Dung
of Horses is nothing but the Fila∣ments
of the Hay, and as such Com∣bustible.</P>
<P>19. Vegetables abound more with
aerial Particles, than Animal Substan∣ces;
and therefore are more flatulent.</P>
<P>20. Man is by his Frame as well
as his Appetite a carnivorous Ani∣mal;
the Instruments of Digestion
are so well adapted to the proper
Food of each Animal, that from the
Structure of the First, it is easy to
guess at the Second. Most Quadru∣pedes
that live upon Herbs, have
incisor Teeth to pluck and divide
them: after they are swallow'd, they
are brought up again from one Sto∣mach
to receive a new Alteration
<PB N="215" REF="245"/>
by a second Mastication, after that
the Mass so prepar'd, passeth through
four Stomachs of different Figures
and Structure before it comes into
the Intestines. This is the Case of
ruminating Animals, except some
few; as of Hares who have but one
Stomach, by which it appears, that
Nature is at a great deal of Labour
to transmute Vegetable into Animal
Substances: Therefore Herb-eating
Animals, which don't ruminate, have
strong Grinders, and chew much.
There have been several Instances of
ruminating Men, and that Quality
leaving them, was a Symptom of
approaching Sickness, Vid. <HI>Philosoph.
Transact. &amp; Bonet. Sepulchret. Ana∣tom.</HI>
Granivorous Birds have the
Mechanism of a Mill, their Maw is
the Happer, which holds and softens
the Grain, letting it drop by Degrees
into the Stomach where it is ground
by two strong Muscles, in which
Action they are assisted by small
<PB N="216" REF="246"/>
Stones which they swallow for the
Purpose, and because this Action of
Grinding; cannot be perform'd by
the weaker Stomachs of their Young;
many of them, as Pigeons, half di∣gest
the Aliment before they give it.
Some Birds that live upon Substan∣ces
easily dissolvable, as Worms,
Eggs, have the Coats of the Sto∣machs
smooth; as Cuckows. Birds
of Prey that live upon Animal Sub∣stances,
have membranaceous not
muscular Stomachs.</P>
<P>The best Instruments for dividing
of Herbs are incisor Teeth; for crack∣ing
of hard Substances, as Bones
and Nuts; Grinders or Mill-Teeth;
for dividing of Flesh; sharp-pointed
or Dog-Teeth, which seem to be so
necessary for that Purpose, that an
Eagle has such Teeth not in his Bill,
but two at the Root of his Tongue
to hold his Prey, and three Rows in
his Jaws at the Entry of his Gullet.
A Human Creature has all the three
<PB N="217" REF="247"/>
Sorts of Teeth; the Teeth and Sto∣machs
of some carnivorous Beasts,
don't differ much from the Human.
A Lion has generally fourteen in
each Jaw; four Incisors, four Ca∣nine,
and six Grinders, sharpish, for
dividing of Flesh as well as cracking
of Bones. A Human Creature has
commonly sixteen Teeth in each
Jaw, two of them only Canine.
The inward Coat of a Lion's Sto∣mach
has stronger Folds than a Hu∣man,
but in other Things not much
different. The Stomachs of Water-Fowl
that live upon Fish are Hu∣man;
therefore it seems that Nature
has provided Human Creatures with
Instruments to prepare and digest al∣most
all Sorts of alimentary Sub∣stances,
as Herbs, Grain, Nuts, by
the Structure of their Parts as well
as Appetites, they are plainly carni∣vorous.</P>
<P>21. It has been objected against
this Doctrine, that Granivorous
<PB N="218" REF="248"/>
Animals have a long Colon and a
Caecum which in Carnivorous are
wanting. Now it is well known
that a Man has both, Vid. <HI>Philoso∣phical
Transactions;</HI> to this it is an∣swer'd
that the Observation is not
true without Exceptions; many car∣nivorous
Animals have neither Co∣lon
nor Caecum, and many Grani∣vorous
have both. There are Ani∣mals
not carnivorous that have a
large Caecum and no Colon, and
others that have neither.</P>
<P>There are carnivorous Animals, I
mean such as eat Flesh sometimes,
that have both Colon and Caecum;
but as the Observation is generally
true, it proves at least that Mankind
is design'd to take vegetable Food
sometimes, and it is a fresh Instance
of Nature's being at more Labour to
assimilate Vegetable into Animal Sub∣stances,
by affording them a longer
and more retarded Passage.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="249"/>
22. Carnivorous Animals have
more Courage, muscular Strength,
Activity in Proportion to their Bulk,
which is evident by comparing the
Cat-Kind, as Lions, Tigers; and
likewise the Dog-Kind with Herb
eating Animals of the same Bulk.
Birds of Prey excell Granivorous, in
Strength and Courage. I know more
than one Instance of irascible Passi∣ons
being much subdu'd by a vege∣table
Diet.</P>
<P>23. Fermented Liquors are pro∣per,
and perhaps necessary for such
as live upon an Animal Diet; for
Flesh without being qualify'd with
Acids, as Bread, Vinegar, and fer∣mented
Liquors, is too alkalescent a
Diet; and Wine moderately taken,
rather qualifies the Heat of Animal
Food than increaseth it. Water is
the only Diluter, and the best Dis∣solvent
of most of the Ingredients
of our Aliment. It is found by Ex∣perience,
that Water digesteth a full
<PB N="220" REF="250"/>
Meale, sooner than any other Liquor;
but as it relaxeth, the constant Use
of it, may hurt some Constitutions.
As it contains no Acid, it is impro∣per
with a Diet that is entirely Alka∣lescent.</P>
<P>The Doctrine laid down in this
<HI>Essay,</HI> is in most Particulars (I do
not say in all) conform to that of
the divine <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as appears
by several Passages of his Works;
particularly of his Books of Diet,
of his Method of Diet in acute Dis∣eases,
and <HI>Galen's</HI> Commentaries both
upon those Books, and some others
of his Works. I shall instance in
some few Particulars as far as relates
to that Part of Diet call'd Aliment,
without refering to the Editions,
Books and Pages, which would be
of small Use to my Readers. The
Maxims of this great Man are, That
Health depends chiefly upon the
Choice of Aliment.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="251"/>
That the Physicians before his
Time were to be blam'd, for not pre∣scribing
Rules of Diet.</P>
<P>That he who would skilfully treat
the Subject of Aliment, must consi∣der
the Nature of Man, the Nature
of Aliments, and the Constitution
of the Person who takes them.</P>
<P>In his Books of Diet, he de∣scribes
the Qualities of all the Sub∣stances
which Mankind generally feed
upon.</P>
<P>As of all Sorts of Flesh, many of
which are not in Use amongst us,
as of Dogs, Foxes, Asses, Horses.</P>
<P>That the Flesh of Wild Animals
is dryer than that of Tame, of Stall∣fed,
than of those fed by Pasto∣rage.</P>
<P>That the Flesh of Animals, in the
Vigor of their Age, and of such as
are castrated, is best.</P>
<P>That of Animals, which have not
us'd hard Labour, is tenderest.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="252"/>
That Beef is bilious that is alka∣lescent,
as all Flesh Meat is.</P>
<P>That the Flesh of hot dry Coun∣tries
is most nourishing.</P>
<P>He is very particular as to Man∣ner
of Cookery, that Roasting destroys
the Humidity.</P>
<P>That salted Flesh should be mace∣rated
and moisten'd.</P>
<P>That salted Flesh dries, attenuates,
and moves the Belly.</P>
<P>He is likewise very curious in
tempering the Qualities of his Meats,
by Seasonings of contrary Qualities.</P>
<P>He describes the Qualities of the
Flesh of most Sorts of Fowl, that
the Flesh of granivorous Birds is not
so moist and oily as that of Ducks;
he is particular as to the Qualities
of Fishes fresh and salted, and of all
Vegetables both Alimentary and Me∣dicinal;
that Onions, Leeks, Ra∣dishes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are hot and acrimonious,
that some of them, as Mustard, and
Cresses, will occasion a Disury; that
<PB N="223" REF="253"/>
others as Letuce, are cooling and re∣laxing;
Selery, diuretick; Mint, hot;
that the Cabbage Kind resolve the
Bile, that such Herbs as are odorous
are Heating, Legumes are flatulent,
ripe Fruits laxative, and unripe, astrin∣gent.</P>
<P>That unripe Cucumbers are hard
of Digestion.</P>
<P>That the Fruits of the Earth in
hot Countries, are dryer and hotter
than in cold.</P>
<P>He is no less exact in describing
the Qualities of Milk, Whey, all
Sorts of Bread and Water, which he
chooses clear, light, without Taste or
Smell, drawn not from Snow, but
from Springs with an Easterly Expo∣sition;
tho' he seems to have known
something of Mineral Waters, he says
nothing of the Use of them.</P>
<P>He is no less accurate in the De∣scription
of the Qualities of several
Sorts of Wines, black, white, austere,
oily, thin, with the proper Uses of
<PB N="224" REF="254"/>
them, by which it appears, that
Wine was seldom or never drunk in
his Country without Water. He
allows Wine unmix'd after great Dis∣sipations
of the Spirits by Fatigue,
and regulates the Quantities of it ac∣cording
to the Seasons.</P>
<P>He likewise consider'd the Medi∣cinal
Qualities of Aliments, and tells
you, that of Aliments some are laxa∣tive,
some moisten, some dry, some
bind, some move Urine.</P>
<P>Indeed the Qualities which he a∣scribes
to alimentary Substances, are
the four in common Use amongst
the Ancients, as hot, cold, moist,
and dry; according to those, his No∣tions
are often very just and instruc∣tive,
and nothing can be more so
than what follows, that acid, acrid,
austere and bitter Substances do not
nourish; but by their Astringency
create Horror, that is, stimulate the
Fibres; that sweet, oily and fat Things
are nourishing and anodyne, that Wa∣ter
<PB N="225" REF="255"/>
dilutes and cools, than Honey
is detergent, and Vinegar profita∣ble
to bilious Constitutions: No less
judicious are his Intentions in the
Cure of Diseases by Aliment.</P>
<P>That Diseases depend on the Parts
contain'd, and the Parts containing,
that is, on the Fluids and Solids.</P>
<P>That the solid Parts were to be re∣lax'd
or astricted as they let the Hu∣mours
pass, either in too small or too
great Quantities.</P>
<P>That Animals consist of Fire and
Water, which Division is not so un∣compleat
as one may imagine; for
by Water he seems to understand the
unactive, and even the solid Parts,
and by Fire all the volatile and active
Parts, and that the difference of Con∣stitutions,
consists in the Excess or De∣fect
of these Principles, and he com∣pares
the due Mixture of them to a
Sort of Harmony.</P>
<P>That there are in a Human Body
Bitter, Salt, Sweet, Acrid and Insipid.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="256"/>
That Contraries are the Remedies
of their Contraries.</P>
<P>That Health consists in a due Pro∣portion
of Blood, Pituite and Gall.</P>
<P>That Redundance of Blood and
Gall, are the Causes of acute Distem∣pers.</P>
<P>That long Abstinence occasions
Bitterness in the Mouth and beating
of the Temples, and he finds fault
with the Physicians that starv'd their
Patients in the beginning of a Dis∣temper,
and gives a Reason for it
conformable to the Principles laid
down in this <HI>Essay</HI> that it dry'd too
much, that is, the liquid Parts were
dissipated.</P>
<P>That a Man cannot be healthy
and digest his Aliment without La∣bour,
and that the Quantity and
Kind of Diet must bear a due Pro∣portion
to the Labour. His Com∣mentator
<HI>Galen</HI> lays down this Apho∣rism.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="257"/>
Young, hot, strong and labour∣ing
Men may feed on Meats giv∣ing
both a hard and gross Juice (as
Beef, Bacon, powdered Flesh and
Fish, hard Cheese, Rye-Bread, and
hard Eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) which may nou∣rish
slowly, and be concocted by
Degrees; for if they should eat
Things of light Nourishment, ei∣ther
their Meat would be too soon
digested, or else converted into Cho∣ler.</P>
<P>And again, Milk is fittest for
young Children, tender Flesh Meat
for them that are growing, and li∣quid
Meats for such as have acute
Diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> observes, that Paleness
is the Effect of Acidity.</P>
<P>That the Choice of Diet should
be according to the difference of
Constitutions, as in phlegmatick
Constitutions, Fish and Flesh well
season'd: The Flesh of Fowls (which
is an alkalescent Diet) not many
<PB N="228" REF="258"/>
Vegetables, black austere Wines. In
dry Temperaments, lenitive Fruits,
Figs, Raisins, and soft Wines. In
such as have a bad Digestion, and
moist Bellies (the Case of acid Con∣stitutions)
the Flesh of Fowl, which
is a Diet both alkalescent and of easy
Digestion; for such as have dry Bel∣lies,
Pot-Herbs.</P>
<P><HI>Galen</HI> his Commentator tells you,
that bitter Substances engender Cho∣ler
and burn the Blood, giving no
general Nourishment to the whole;
howsoever they may be acceptable
to some one Part, that is (according
to what was said in this <HI>Essay</HI>) that
they are a Sort of subsidiary Gall:
And again, sharp Spices are most
unfit for tender Bodies, whose Sub∣stance
is easily melted and inflam'd.
However, strong Men may eat them
with gross Meats, and consequently
by the Principles of the <HI>Essay;</HI> Spi∣ces
by their melting Quality are pro∣per
for fat People: Meats over-salted
<PB N="229" REF="259"/>
are dangerous: Inflammations, Le∣prosies,
Sharpness of Urine, and
great Obstructions happening to such
as use them much, agreeing with
none but strong Bodies, as Sailers,
Soldiers, and Husband Men, accus∣tom'd
to hard Labour, and much
Toiling.</P>
<P>Fat Meats are not good but for
dry Stomachs; for in sanguine and
cholerick Stomachs, they are soon
corrupted; in phlegmatick Stomachs,
they procure Looseness, and hinder
Retention.</P>
<P>When any Man is sick or distem∣per'd,
let his Meats be of contrary
Qualities to his Disease; for Health
itself is but a Kind of Temper got∣ten
and preserv'd by a convenient
Mixture of Contrarieties. According∣ly,
in Fevers the Aliments prescrib'd
by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> were Ptisans and
Cream of Barley. Decoctions of
some Vegetables likewise with the
Mixture of some acid, Hydromel,
<PB N="230" REF="260"/>
that is, Honey and Water, Oxymel,
Honey and Vinegar, then Wines
without Flavour diluted with Water,
when there was no Tendency to a
<HI>Dilirium.</HI> Water, Vinegar and Ho∣ney
in Pleurisies and Inflammations
of the Lungs. Sometimes he mixeth
Spices, which seems odd; but that
must have been for promoting Ex∣pectoration;
and even in Ulcers of
the Lungs, he prescribes Fat and Salt
for the same Purpose; and to Wo∣men
troubled with Pains after Child∣bearing,
he mixeth his Ptisan with
Leeks and Fat; which Practice no
doubt he had found successful.</P>
<P>He prescribes great Quantities of
Asses Milk as far as an <HI>English</HI> Gal∣lon
in proper Cases, especially as a
Restorative; and to such as had hot,
dry Constitutions, Asses Milk, Whey
and Abstinence from Fat and Oil.</P>
<P>No less judicious are his general
Maxims for preserving of Health.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="261"/>
A Diet moderate in Quantity with
a due Degree of Exercise.</P>
<P>That such as are of hot Constitu∣tions,
should abstain from violent
Exercises, use Bathing in hot Water,
rather than Unctions, feed upon Maize
(which is his favourite Food) and Pot
Herbs.</P>
<P>That one must not accustome one's
self to a too regular Diet, because
the least Error is dangerous.</P>
<P>That all sudden Alterations in Ex∣tremes,
either of Repletion, Evacua∣tion,
Heat or Cold are dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Galen</HI> speaking the Mind of <HI>Hip∣pocrates,</HI>
tells us, That the whole Con∣stitution
of Body may be chang'd
by Diet.</P>
<P>That we should take those Kinds
of Meats which are best for our
own particular Bodies for our parti∣cular
Age, Temperature, Distempera∣ture,
and Complexions; for as eve∣ry
particular Member of the Body is
nourish'd with a several qualify'd
<PB N="232" REF="262"/>
Juice; so Labourers, and idle Per∣sons,
Children and Striplings, old
Men and young Men, cold and hot
Bodies, phlegmatick and cholerick
Complexions must have diverse Diets.
It is easy to produce a great many
more Instances to prove the Con∣formity
of the Doctrine of the <HI>Essay,</HI>
with the Notions and Practice of <HI>Hip∣pocrates;</HI>
but those already mention'd
are sufficient, and may be of use to
some Readers to confirm by Autho∣rity,
what they will not be at the
Trouble to deduce by Reasoning.</P>
