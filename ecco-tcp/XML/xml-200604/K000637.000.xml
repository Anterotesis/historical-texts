<HEAD>The Publisher's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE World is much indebted to the famous Sir
<HI>Humphry Polesworth,</HI> for his ingenious and im∣partial
Account of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Law-Suit; yet
there is just Cause of Complaint against him,
in that he retails it only by Parcels, and won't give
us the whole Work; This forces me, who am only the
Publisher, to bespeak the Assistance of his Friends and
Acquaintance, to engage him to lay aside that stingy
Humour, and gratify the Curiosity of the Publick, at
once. He pleads in excuse, that they are only private
Memoirs, wrote for his own Use, in a loose Style, to
serve as a help to his ordinary Conversation. I repre∣sented
to him the good Reception the two first Parts
had met, that tho' they had been calculated by him,
only for the Meridian of <HI>Grubstreet,</HI> yet they were ta∣ken
Notice of by the better sort; that the World was
now sufficiently acquainted with <HI>John Bull,</HI> and intere∣sted
it self in his little Concerns. He Answer'd with
a Smile, that he had indeed some trifling Things to
impart that concerned <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Relations and Do∣mestick
Affairs; if these would satisfy me, he gave
me free leave to make use of them, because they would
serve to make the History of the Law-Suit more intel∣ligible.
When I had look'd over the Manuscript, I
found likewise some further Account of the Composi∣tion,
which perhaps may not be unacceptable to such
as have read the two former Parts.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Character of <HI>John Bull's</HI> Mother.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> had a Mother, whom he Lov'd and Honour'd
extremely, a Discreet, Grave, Sober Good Con∣dition'd,
Cleanly Old Gentlewoman, as ever
liv'd; she was none of your Cross-grain'd termagant
<PB REF="5"/>
scolding Jades, that one had as good be hang'd as
live in the House with, such as are always censuring
the Conduct, and telling scandalous Stories of their
Neighbours, extolling their own good Qualities, and
undervaluing those of others. On the contrary, she
was of a Meek Spirit, and as she was strictly Virtuous
her self, so she always put the best Construction upon
the Words and Actions of her Neighbours, except
where they were irreconcileable to the Rules of Honesty
and Decency. She was neither one of your precise
<HI>Prudes,</HI> nor one of your phantastical old <HI>Belles,</HI> that
Dress themselves like Girls of Fifteen; as she neither
wore a Ruff, Fore-head Cloth, nor High-crown'd
Hat, so she had laid aside Feathers, Flowers, and
crimpt Ribons in her Head-dress, Furbulow Scarfs and
Hoop'd Petticoats. She scorn'd to Patch and Paint,
yet she lov'd to keep her Hands and her Face Clean.
Tho' she wore no flaunting lac'd Ruffles, she would
not keep her self in a constant Sweat with greasy Flan∣nel:
Tho' her Hair was not stuck with Jewels, she
was not asham'd of a Diamond Cross; she was not
like some Ladies, hung about with Toys and Trinkets,
Twiser Cases, Pocket-Glasses and Essence Bottles; she
us'd only a Gold Watch and an Almanack, to mark
the Hours and the Holy-Days. Her Furniture was
neat and genteel, well fancy'd with <HI>a bon Goust.</HI> As
she affected not the Grandeur of a State with a Cano∣py,
she thought there was no Offence in an Elbow
Chair; she had laid aside your Carving, Gilding and
Japan Work, as being too apt to gather Dirt, but
she never could be prevail'd upon to part with plain
Wainscot and clean Hangings. There are some La∣dies
that affect to smell a stink in every Thing; they
are always highly perfum'd, and continually burning
Frankincense in their Rooms; she was above such Af∣fectation,
yet she never would lay aside the Use of
Brooms and scrubbing Brushes, and scrupl'd not to lay
her Linnen in fresh Lavender: She was no less genteel
in her Behaviour, well-bred without Affectation, in
the due mean between one of your affected Cursying
<PB REF="6"/>
pieces of Formality, and your Romps that have
no regard to the common Rules of Civility. There
are some Ladies that affect a Mighty regard for their
Relations; <HI>We must not Eat to Day, for my Uncle</HI> Tom<HI>,
or my Cousin</HI> Betty <HI>dy'd this time ten Years</HI>; <HI>Let's have
a Ball to Night, it is my Neighbour such a ones Birth-day</HI>;
she look'd upon all this as Grimace; yet she constant∣ly
observ'd her Husband's Birth-day, her Wedding-day,
and some few more. Tho' she was a truly good
Woman, and had a sincere Motherly Love for her Son
<HI>John,</HI> yet there wanted not those who endeavour'd to
create a Misunderstanding between them, and they
had so far prevail'd with him once, that he turn'd her
out of Doors to his geeat Sorrow, as he found after∣wards,
for his Affairs went all at sixes and sevens. She
was no less Judicious in the turn of her Conversation
and Choice of her Studies, in which she far exceeded
all her Sex; your Rakes that hate the Company of all
sober, grave Gentlewomen, would bear hers, and she
would by her handsome manner of proceeding sooner
reclaim than some that were more sower and reserv'd;
she was a zealous Preacher up of Chastity, and Con∣jugal
Fidelity in Wives, and by no means a Friend to
the new-fangl'd Doctrine of the <HI>Indispensible Duty of
Cuckoldom:</HI> Tho she advanc'd her Opinions with a
becoming Assurance, yet she never usher'd them in,
as some positive Creatures will do, with dogmatical
Assertions, <HI>This is infallible; I cannot be mistaken;
none but a Rogue can deny it.</HI> It has been observ'd that
such People are oftner in the Wrong than any Body;
tho' she had a thousand good Qualities, she was not
without her Faults, amongst which one might perhaps
reckon too great Lenity to her Servants, to whom
she always gave good Counsel, but often too gentle
Correction. I thought I could not say less of <HI>John
Bull</HI>'s Mother, because she bears a part in the following
Transactions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Character of <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Sister <HI>Peg,</HI> with the Quarrels
that happen'd between Master and Miss, in their Child∣hood.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN</HI> had a Sister a poor Girl that had been starv'd
at Nurse; any Body would have guess'd Miss to
have been bred up under the Influence of a cruel
Step-Dame, and <HI>John</HI> to be the Fondling of a tender
Mother. <HI>John</HI> look'd ruddy and plump, with a pair
of Cheeks like a Trumpeter; Miss look'd pale and
wan, as if she had the Green-Sickness; and no wonder
for <HI>John</HI> was the Darling, he had all the good Bits,
was cramm'd with good Pullet, Chicken, Pig, Goose
and Capon; while Miss had only a little Oatmeal and
Water, or a dry Crust without Butter. <HI>John</HI> had his
golden Pippens, Peaches and Nectarnes; poor Miss
a Crap Apple, Sloe or Blackberry. Master lay in the
best Apartment, with his Bed Chamber toward the
South Sun. Miss lodg'd in a Garret, expos'd to the
North Wind, which shrevel'd her Countenance;
however, this Usage tho it stunted the poor Girl in
her Growth, gave her a hardy Constitution; she had
Life and Spirit in abundance, and knew when she was
ill used; Now and then she would seize upon <HI>John</HI>'s
Commons, snatch a Leg of a Pullet, or a bit of good
Beef, for which they were sure to go to Fisticuffs.
Master was indeed too strong for her, but Miss would
not yield in the least Point, but ev'n when Master
had got her down, she would scratch and bite like a
Tyger; when he gave her a Cuff on the Ear, she
would prick him with her Knitting-Needle. <HI>John</HI>
brought a great Chain one Day to tye her to the Bed
Post, for which Affront Miss aim'd a Pen-knife at his
Heart: In short, these Quarrels grew up to rooted
Aversions, they gave one another Nicknames, she
call'd him <HI>Gundyguts,</HI> and he call'd her Lousy <HI>Peg:</HI>
Tho' the Girl was a right clever Wench as any was,
and thro' her pale Looks, you might discern Spirit and
Vivacity, which made her not indeed a perfect Beauty,
but something that was agreeable. It was barbarous
<PB REF="8"/>
in Parents not to take Notice of these early Quarrels,
and make them live better together, such Domestick
Fewds proving afterwards the occasion of Misfortunes
to them both. <HI>Peg</HI> had indeed some odd Humours and
comical Antipathy, for which <HI>John</HI> would jeer her.
<HI>What think you of my Sister</HI> Peg (<HI>says he</HI>) <HI>that faints at
the Sound of an Organ, and yet will dance and frisk at the
Noise of a Bagpipe? What's that to you,</HI> Gundy-guts<HI>,
(quoth</HI> Peg<HI>) every Body's to chuse their own Musick.</HI>' Then
Peg had taken a Fancy not to say her <HI>Pater-noster,</HI>
which made People imagine strange things of her. Of
the three Brothers that have made such a Clutter in
the World, Lord <HI>Peter, Martin</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI>; <HI>Jack</HI> had of
late been her Inclinations; Lord <HI>Peter</HI> she detested;
nor did <HI>Martin</HI> stand much better in her good Graces,
but <HI>Jack</HI> had found the way to her Heart. I have
often admir'd what Charms she discover'd in that
aukward Booby, till I talk'd with a Person that was
acquainted with the Intrigue, who gave me the follow∣ing
Account of it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Jack</HI>'s Charms, or the Method by which he gain'd <HI>Peg</HI>'s
Heart.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first place, <HI>Jack</HI> was a very young Fellow, by
much the youngest of the three Brothers, and Peo∣ple
indeed wonder'd how such a young upstart Jack∣anapes
shou'd grow so pert and saucy, and take so
much upon him. (2.) <HI>Jack</HI> brag'd of greater Abilities
than other Men; he was well gifted, as he pretended;
I need not tell you what secret Influence that has upon
the Ladies. (3.) <HI>Jack</HI> had a most scandalous Tongue,
and persuaded <HI>Peg</HI> that all Mankind besides himself
were pox'd by that scarletfac'd Whore <HI>Signiora Bubo∣nia.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">As for his Brother Lord <HI>Peter,</HI> the Tokens
were evident in him Blotches, Scabs, and the Co∣rona:
His Brother <HI>Martin</HI> though he was not quite
so bad, had some nocturnal Pains, which his Friends
pretended were only Scorbutical; but, he was sure,
proceeded from a worse Cause.</Q> By such malicious
Insinuations, he had possess'd the Lady, that he was
<PB REF="9"/>
the only Man in the World, of a sound, pure, and
untainted Constitution: Tho' there were some that
stuck not to say, that <HI>Signiora Bubonia</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> rail'd
at one another, only the better to hide an Intrigue;
and, that <HI>Jack</HI> had been found with <HI>Signiora</HI> under
his Cloak, carrying her home in a dark stormy Night.
(4.) <HI>Jack</HI> was a prodigious Ogler; he would Ogle
you the outside of his Eye inward, and the White up∣ward.
(5.) <HI>Jack</HI> gave himself out for a Man of great
Estate in the Fortunate Islands, of which the sole Pro∣perty
was vested in his Person; by this Trick he chea∣ted
abundance of poor People of small Sums, pre∣tending
to make over Plantations in the said Islands;
but, when the poor Wretches came there with <HI>Jack</HI>'s
Grant, they were beat, mock'd, and turn'd out of
Doors. (6.) I told you that <HI>Peg</HI> was whimsical, and
lov'd any thing that was particular: In that way <HI>Jack</HI>
was her Man; for he neither thought, spoke, dress'd,
nor acted like other Mortals: He was for your bold
Strokes; he rail'd at Fops, tho' himself the most af∣fected
in the World; instead of the common Fashion,
he would visit his Mistress in a Mourning Cloak, Band,
short Cuffs, and a peaked Beard. He invented a way
of coming into a Room backwards, which he said shew'd
more Humility, and less Affectation: where other
People stood, he sat; where they sat, he stood; when
he went to Court, he us'd to kick away the State, and
sit down by his Prince Cheek by Choul, <HI>Confound these
States</HI> (says he) <HI>they are a modern Invention</HI>; when he
spoke to his Prince he always turn'd his Br<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ch
upon him; if he was advis'd to fast for his Health he
would eat Roast beef; if he was allow'd a more plen∣tiful
Diet, then he would be sure that Day to live
upon Watergruel; he would cry at a Wedding, laugh
and make Jests at a Funeral. He was no less singular
in his Opinions; you would have burst your sides to
hear him talk Politicks: <Q REND="inline">All Governments (says
he) is founded upon the right Distribution of Pu∣nishments;
decent Executions keep the World in
awe; for that Reason the Majority of Mankind
<PB REF="10"/>
ought to be hang'd every Year; for Example, I
suppose, the Magistrate ought to pass an irreversible
Sentence upon all blue-ey'd Children from the Cra∣dle;
but that there may be some shew of Justice in
his proceeding, these Children ought to be Train'd
up, by Masters appointed for that purpose, to all
sorts of Villany, that they may deserve their Fate,
and the Execution of them may serve as an Object
of Terror to the rest of Mankind.</Q> As to the giving
of Pardons he had this singular Method, That when
these Wretches had the Ropes about their Necks, it
should be enquired, who believ'd they should be
hanged, and who not? The first were to be Pardon'd,
the last hang'd out-right: Such as were once par∣don'd,
were never to be hang'd afterwards, for any
Crime whatsoever. He had such Skill in Physiogno∣my,
that he would pronounce peremptorily upon a
Mans Face, That Fellow (says he) do what he will,
can▪t avoid Hanging; he has a hanging Look. By
the same Art, he would prognosticate a Principality
to a Scoundrel. He was no less particular in the
Choice of his Studies; they were generally bent to∣wards
exploded Chimera's, the <HI>perpetum Mobile,</HI> the
circular Shot, Philosopher's Stone, and silent Gun∣powder,
making Chains for Flea's, Nets for Flies,
and Instruments to unrevel Cobwebs, and split Hairs.
Thus, I think, I have given you a distinct Account of
the Methods he practis'd upon <HI>Peg.</HI> Her Brother would
now and then ask her. <Q REND="inline">What a Devil dost thou see
in that pragmatical Coxcomb, to make thee so in
Love with him? He is a fit Match for a Tailor or a
Shoemaker's Daughter, but not for you that are a
Gentlewoman. Fancy is free (quoth <HI>Peg</HI>) I'll take
my awn way, do you take yours; I do no care for
your flaunting Beaus, that gang with their Breasts
open, and their Sarks over their Waistcoats, that
accost me with set Speeches out of <HI>Sidney</HI>'s <HI>Arcadia,</HI>
or, <HI>The Academy of Compliments. Jack</HI> is a sober grave
Youngman; tho' he has none of your study'd Ha∣rangues,
his Meaning is sincere: He has a great Re∣gard
<PB REF="11"/>
to his Father's Will; and he that shews himself
a good Son, will make a good Husband; besides, I
know he has the Original Deed of Conveyance to
the Fortunate Islands; the others are Counterfeits.</Q>
There is nothing so obstinate as young Ladies in their
Amours; the more you Cross them, the Worse they
are.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. How the Relations reconcil'd <HI>John</HI> and his Sister <HI>Peg,</HI> and
what return <HI>Peg</HI> made to <HI>John's</HI> Message.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN BULL,</HI> otherwise a good natur'd Man,
was very hard-hearted to his Sister <HI>Peg,</HI> chiefly
from an Aversion he had conceived in his Infancy.
While he flourish'd, kept a warm House, and drove a
plentiful Trade, poor <HI>Peg</HI> was forc'd to go hawking
and pedling about the Streets, selling Knives, Scissars
and Shoe-buckles; now and then carry'd a Basket of
Fish to the Market; sow'd, spun and knit for a poor
Livelihood, till her Fingers-end were sore; and when
she could not get Bread for her Family, she was forc'd
to hire 'em out at Journey-work to her Neighbours;
Yet in these her poor Circumstances, she still preserv'd
the Air and Mien of a Gentlewoman; a certain decent
Pride, that extorted Respect from the haughtiest of
her Neighbours; when she came into any full Assem∣bly,
she would not yield the <HI>pas</HI> to the best of them.
If one ask'd her, Are not you related to <HI>John Bull</HI>?
Yes (says she) he has the Honour to be my Brother.
So <HI>Peg</HI>'s Affairs went, till all the Relations cry'd out
shame upon <HI>John,</HI> for his barbarous Usage of his own
Flesh and Blood; that it was an easie matter for him
to put her in a credible way of living, not only with∣out
Hurt, but with Advantage to himself, being she
was an industrious Person, and might be serviceable
to him in his way of Business. Hang her, Jade, (quoth
<HI>John</HI>) I can't endure her, as long as she keeps that
Rascal <HI>Jack</HI>'s Company. They told him, the way to
reclaim her was to take her into his House; that by
Conversation, the childish Humours of their younger
days might be worn out. These Arguments were en∣forc'd
<PB REF="12"/>
by a certain Incident. It happen'd that <HI>John</HI>
was at that time about making his Will, and entailing
his Estate, the very same in which <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> is nam▪d
Executor. Now his Sister <HI>Peg</HI>'s Name being in the
Entail, he could not make a thorough Settlement
without her Consent. There was indeed a malicious
Story went about as if <HI>John</HI>'s last Wife had fall'n in
love with <HI>Jack,</HI> as he was eating Custard a Horseback;
that she perswaded <HI>John</HI> to take his Sister <HI>Peg</HI> into
the House the better to drive on her Intrigue with
<HI>Jack,</HI> concluding he would follow his Mistress <HI>Peg.</HI> All
I can infer from this Story is, that when one has got
a bad Character in the World, People will report
and believe any thing of them, true or false. But to
return to my Story; when <HI>Peg</HI> receiv'd <HI>John</HI>'s Message,
she huff'd and storm'd like the Devil: <Q REND="inline">My Brother
<HI>John</HI> (quoth she) is grown wondrous kind hearted
all of a suddain, but I meikle doubt, whether it be
not mair for his awn Conveniency than my good; he
draws up his Weits and his Deeds forsooth, and I
mun set my Hand to them, unsight unseen. I like
the young Man he has settled upon well enough, but
I think I ought to have a valuable Consideration
for my Consent: He wants my poor little Farm,
because it makes a Nook in his Park Wall; ye may
e'en tell him, he has mair than he makes good use
of; he gangs up and down drinking, roaring and
quarrelling through all the Countrey Merkats ma∣king
foolish Bargins in his Cups, which he repents
when he is sober; like a thriftless Wretch, spending
the Goods and Gear that his Fore-Fathers won with
the Sweat of their Brows; light come, light go▪ he
cares not a Farthing: But why should I stand Surety
for his silly contracts? the little I have is free, and
I can call it my own; Hame's hame be it never so
hamely; I ken him well enough, he could never a∣bide
me, and when he has his ends he'll e'en use me
as he did before; I'm sure I shall be treated like a
poor Drudge; I shall be set to tend the Bairns, darn
the Hose, and mend the Linnen. Then there's no
<PB REF="13"/>
living with that auld Carline his Mother, she rails
at <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI>'s an honester man than any of her
Kin: I shall be plagu'd with her Spells and her <HI>Pater∣nosters</HI>
and silly auld warld Ceremonies: I mun ne∣ver
pair my Nails on a Friday, nor begin a Journy
on <HI>Childermas day,</HI> and I mun stand becking and bin∣ging
as I gang out and into the Hall: Tell him he
may e'en gan his get, I'll have nothing to do with
him, I'll stay like the poor Country Mouse, in my
own Habitation.</Q> So <HI>Peg</HI> talkt; but for all that,
by the Interposition of good Friends, and by many a
bonny thing that were sent and many more that were
promis'd <HI>Peg,</HI> the matter was concluded, and <HI>Peg</HI> ta∣ken
into the House upon certain Articles; one of
which was, That she might have the Freedom of <HI>Jack</HI>'s
Conversation, and might take him for Better and for
Worse, if she pleas'd; provided always, he did not
come into the House at unseasonable Hours, and di∣sturb
the Rest of the Old Woman, <HI>John</HI>'s Mother.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of some Quarrels that happen'd after <HI>Peg</HI> was taken into
the Family.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an old Observation, that the Qnarrels of Rela∣tions
are harder to reconcile than any other; Inju∣ries
from Friends fret and gall more and the Memo∣ry
of them is not so easily obliterated: This is cunning∣ly
represented by one of your old Sages, called <HI>Aesop,</HI> in
the Story of the Bird, that was griev'd extremely,
for being wounded with an Arrow feather'd with his
own Wing; as also of the Oak that let many a heavy
Groan, when he was cleft with a Wedge of his own
Timber. There was no Man in the World less sub∣ject
to Rancour than <HI>John Bull,</HI> considering how often
his good Nature had been Abus'd; yet I don't know,
but he was too apt to hearken to tatling People, that
carried Tales between him and his Sister <HI>Peg,</HI> on pur∣pose
to sow Jealousies, and set them together by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars: They say that there were some Hardships put
upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that had been better let alone; but it was
the Business of good People to restrain the Injuries on
<PB REF="14"/>
one side, and moderate the Resentments on the other;
a good Friend acts both parts, the one without the
other will not do. The Purchase-Money of <HI>Peg</HI>'s Farm
was ill paid; then <HI>Peg</HI> lov'd a little good Liquor, and
the Servants shut up the Wine-Cellar, but for that <HI>Peg</HI>
found a Trick, for she made a false Key; <HI>Peg's</HI> Ser∣vants
complain'd that they were debar'd from all man∣ner
of Business, and never suffer'd to touch the least
thing within the House; if they offered to come into
the Warehouse, then strait went the Yard slap over
their Noddle; if they ventur'd into the Counting-Room,
a Fellow would throw an Ink bottle at their
Head; if they came into the best Apartment, to set
any thing there in order, they were saluted with a
Broom; if they meddl'd with any thing in the Kit∣chen,
it was odds but the Cook laid them over the
Pate with a Ladle; one that would have got into the
Stables, was met by two Rascals, who fell to work
with him with a Brush and a Curry-comb; some climb∣ing
up into the Coach box, were told, that one of
their Companions had been there before that could
not drive, then slap went the long Whip about their
Ears: On the other Hand it was complain'd, that <HI>Peg</HI>'s
Servants were always asking for Drink-Money, that they
had more than their share of the <HI>Christmas-box</HI>; to say
the Truth, <HI>Peg</HI>'s Lads bustl'd pretty hard for that, for
when they were endeavouring to Lock it up, they got
in their great Fists, and pull'd out Handfuls of Half-Crowns,
some Shillings and Six-pences, others in the
Scramble pick'd up Guineas and Broad-pieces. But
there happen'd a worse thing than all this, it was com∣plain'd
that <HI>Peg</HI>'s Servants had great Stomachs, and
brought too many of their Friends and Acquaintance

out of House and Home. Instead of regulating this
Matter as it ought to be, <HI>Peg</HI>'s young Men were thrust
away from the Table; then there was the Devil and
all to do, Spoons, Plates and Dishes, flew about the
Room like mad, and Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> who was now <HI>Major
Domo,</HI> had enough to do to quiet them. <HI>Peg</HI> said this

was contrary to Agreement, whereby she was in all
things to be treated like a Child of the Family; then
she call'd upon those that had made her such fair Pro∣mises,
and undertook for her Brother <HI>John</HI>'s good Be¦haviour;
but alas! to her Cost, she found that they
were the first and readiest to do her the Injury. <HI>John</HI>
at last agreed to this Regulation, that <HI>Peg</HI>'s Footme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
might sit with his Book-keeper, Journey-men and Ap∣prentices;
and <HI>Peg</HI>▪s better sort of Servants might sit
with his Footmen, if they pleas'd.</P>
<P>Then they began to order-Plumb Porridge and
Minc'd Pies for <HI>Peg</HI>'s Dinner: <HI>Peg</HI> told them she had
an Aversion to that sort of Food; that upon forcing
down a Mess of it some Years ago, it threw her into
a Fit, 'till she brought it up again: Some alledg'd it
was nothing but Humour, that the same Mess should
be serv▪d up again for Supper, and Breakfast next
Morning; others would have made use of a Horn,
but the Wiser sort bid let her alone, and she might
take to it of her own Accord.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Conversation between <HI>John Bull</HI> and his Wife.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>THO' our Affairs, Honey are in a bad
Condition. I have a better Opinion
of them since you seem to be convinc'd
of the Ill Course you have been in, and are resolv'd
to submit to proper Remedies. But when I consider
your immense Debts▪ your foolish Bargains and the
general Disorder of your Business, I have a Curiosity
to know what Fate or Chance has brought you into
this Condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would talk of some other Sub∣ject,
the Thoughts of it make me mad, our Family
must have their run.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>But such a strange thing as this, never
happen'd to any of your Family before; they have had
Law Suits, but tho' they spent the Income, they never
Mortgag'd the Stock: Sure you must have some of the
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> or the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Blood in you; prithee give me

<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who could help it? There lives not such
a Fellow by Bread, as that Old <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> it is
the cheatingest, contentious Rogue, upon the Face of
the Earth. You must know, one Day as <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> and
I were over a Bottle making up an old Quarrel, the
old Knave would needs have us drink a Bottle of his
<HI>Champaigne,</HI> and so one after another, till my Friend
<HI>Nic.</HI> and I, not being used to such heady Stuff got
bloody Drunk. <HI>Lewis</HI> all the while, either by the
Strength of his Brain, or Flinching his Glass, kept him∣self
sober as a Judge. <Q REND="inline">My worthy Friends (quoth
<HI>Lewis</HI>) henceforth let us live Neighbourly, I am as
peaceable and quiet as a Lamb, of my own Temper,
but it has been my Misfortune to live among quarrel∣som
Neighbours. There is but one thing can make
us fall out, and that is the Inheritance of Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>▪s
Estate; I am content, for Peace sake to wave my
Right, and submit to any Expedient to prevent a
Law-Suit; I think an equal Division will be the fair∣est
way. Well mov'd Old <HI>Lewis</HI> (quoth <HI>Frog</HI>) and I
hope my Friend <HI>John</HI> here will not be Refractory.</Q> At
the same time he clap'd me on the Back, and slabber▪d
me all over from Cheek to Cheek, with his great
Tongue. Do as you please, Gentlemen (quoth I) 'tis
all one to <HI>John Bull.</HI> We agreed to part that Night,
and next Morning to meet at the Corner of Lord
<HI>Strutt</HI>'s Park Wall, with our surveying Instruments,
which accordingly we did. Old <HI>Lewis</HI> carried a Chain
and a Semicircle, <HI>Nic</HI> Paper, Rulers and a Lead Pen∣cil,
and I follow'd at some distance with a long Pole.
We began first with surveying the Meadow-Grounds,
afterwards we measur'd the Corn Fields Close by Close,
then we proceeded to the Wood-Lands, the Copper
and Tin Mines. All this while <HI>Nic.</HI> laid down every
thing exactly upon Paper, calculated the Acres and
Roods to a great Nicety. When we had finish'd the
Land, we were going to break into the House and
Gardens, to take an Inventory of his Plate, Pictures,
and other Furniture.</P>

<P>As we had almost finish'd our Concern, we
were accosted by some of Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s Servants:
<Q REND="inline">Hey day, what's here? What a Devils the mean∣ing
of all these Trangams and Gimcracks, Gentle∣men?
What, in the name of Wonder, are you go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could you Answer to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly my Neighbour <HI>Frog</HI> and I were
still hot-headed; we told him his Master was an Old
doating Puppy that minded nothing of his own Busi∣ness;
that we were Surveying his Estate, and settling
it for him, since he would not do it himself. Upon this
there happen'd a Qurrrel but we being stronger than
they, sent them away with a Flea in their Ear. They
went home, and told their Master, <Q REND="inline">My Lord (say
they) there are three odd sort of Fellows going a∣bout
your Grounds with the strangest Machines that
ever we beheld in our Life; I suppose they are going
to Rob your Orchard, fell your Trees, or drive a∣way
your Cattle; they told us strange things of set∣tling
your Estate: One is a lusty old Fellow, in a
black Wig, with a black Beard, without Teeth; there's
another thick squat Fellow in Trunk-Hose; the third is
a little long Nos'd, thin Man. (I was then Lean, being
just come out of a fit of Sickness.) I suppose it is fit to
send after them, lest they carry something away.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy this put the Old Fellow in a rare
Tweag.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Weak as he was, he call'd for his long <HI>To∣ledo</HI>
swore and bounc'd about the Room, <Q REND="inline">Sdeath!
what am I come to, to be Affronted so by my Trades∣men?
I know the Rascals! my Barber, Clothier and
Linnen-Draper, dispose of my Estate! bring hither
my Blunderbuss I'll warrant ye you shall see Day∣light
through them. Scoundrels! Dogs! the Scum
of the Earth! <HI>Frog,</HI> that was my Fathers Kitchen∣boy,
he pretend to meddle with my Estate! with my
Will! Ah poor <HI>Strutt,</HI> what art thou come to at last,
thou hast liv'd too long in the World, to see thy Age
<PB REF="18"/>
and Infirmity so despis'd? How will the Ghosts of my
noble Ancestors receive these Tidings? They cannot,
must not sleep quietly in their Graves. In short,
the Old Gentleman was carried off in a Fainting Fit,
and after bleeding in both Arms hardly recover▪d.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really this was a very extraordinary way
of Proceeding: I long to hear the rest of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>After we had come back to the Tavern, and
taken t'other Bottle of <HI>Champaigne,</HI> we quarrell'd a
little about the Division of the Estate; <HI>Lewis</HI> hall'd
and pull'd the Map on one side, and <HI>Frog</HI> and I on t'o∣ther,
till we had like to have tore the Parchment to
pieces. At last <HI>Lewis</HI> pull'd out a pair of great Tay∣lor's
Shears and clip'd off a Corner for himself, which
he said was a Mannor that lay convenient for him,
and left <HI>Frog</HI> and me the rest to dispose of, as we pleas'd.
We were over-joy'd, to think <HI>Lewis</HI> was contented with
so little, not smelling what was at the bottom of the
Plot. There happen'd, indeed, an Incident, that
gave us some Disturbance; A Cunning Fellow, one
of my Servants, two Days after, peeping through the
Key-hole, observ'd that Old <HI>Lewis</HI> had stole away
our part of the Map, and saw him fiddling and turn∣ing
the Map from one Corner to the other, trying to
join the two pieces together again: He was mutte∣ring
something to himself, which he did not well hear,
only these Words, <HI>'Tis great Pity, 'tis great Pity</HI>! My
Servant added, that he believ'd this had some ill-meaning;
I told him he was a Coxcomb, always pre∣tending
to be Wiser than his Companions; <HI>Lewis</HI> and
I are good Friends, he's an honest Fellow, and, I dare
say, will stand to his Bargain. The Sequel of the
Story prov'd this Fellow's Suspicion to be too well-grounded;
for <HI>Lewis</HI> reveal▪d our whole Secret to the
Deceas'd Lord <HI>Strutt,</HI> who, in Reward to his Trea∣chery,
and Revenge to <HI>Frog</HI> and me, settled his whole
Estate upon the present <HI>Philip Baboon</HI>: Then we un∣derstood
what he meant by piecing the Map toge∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was you surpris'd at this? Had not
Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> reason to be Angry? Would you have been
contented to have been so us'd your self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly Wife, it was not easily recon∣ciled
to the common Methods, but then it was the
Fashion to do such things: I have read of your Golden
Age, your Silver Age, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one might justly call this
the Age of the Lawyers. There was hardly a Man
of Substance in all the Country, but had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Counterfeit
that pretended to his Estate: As the Philosophers
say, that there is a Duplicate of every Terrestrial A∣nimal
at Sea, so it was in this Age of the Lawyers,
there was at least two of every thing; nay, o' my
Conscience, I think there were three Esquire <HI>Hackums</HI>
at one time. <HI>Lewis Baboon</HI> entertain▪d a Fellow that
call'd himself <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Heir; I knew him no more
than the Child unborn, yet he brought me into some
Trouble and Expence. There was another that pre∣tended
to be Esq. <HI>South</HI>; and two Lord <HI>Strutts,</HI> you
know. In short, it was usual for a parcel of Fellows
to meet, and dispose of the whole Estates in the Coun∣try:
<HI>This lies convenient for me</HI> Tom; <HI>Thou would do
more good with that</HI> Dick, <HI>than the Old Fellow that has it</HI>▪
So to Law they went with the true Owners; the
Lawyers got well by it, every Body else was undone.
It was a common thing for an honest Man, when he
came Home at Night, to find another Fellow domi∣neering
in his Family, hectoring his Servants, calling
for Supper, and pretending to go to Bed to his Wife.
In every House you might observe two <HI>Sofia</HI>'s quar∣relling
who was Master: For my own part, I am still
afraid of the same Treatment, that I should find some
Body behind my Counter selling my Broad Cloath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are a sort of Fellows that they call
Banterers, and Bambouzlers, that play such Tricks;
but, it seems, these Fellows were in earnest.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the hard Shifts Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> was put to, to preserve the
Mannor of <HI>Bullock's Hatch</HI>; with Sir <HI>Roger</HI>'s Method
to keep off importunate Duns.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>John Bull</HI> and his Wife were talking together,
they were surpriz▪d with a sudden knocking at
<PB REF="20"/>
the Door, <HI>those wicked Scriveners and Lawyers
no doubt</HI> (quoth <HI>John</HI>) and so it was; some asking for
the Money he ow'd, and others warning to prepare
for the approaching Term: <HI>What a cursed Life do I
lead</HI> ▪quoth <HI>John</HI>)? <HI>Debt is like deadly Sin; for God-sake,
Sir</HI> Roger<HI>, get me rid of these Fellows. I'll warrant you</HI>
(quoth Sir <HI>Roger</HI>) <HI>leave them to me.</HI> And in eed it
was pleasant enough to observe Sir <HI>Roger</HI>'s Method
with these importunate Duns; his sincere Friendship
for <HI>John Bull,</HI> made him submit to many things, for his
Service, which he would have scorn▪d to have done
for himself. Sometimes he would stand at the Door
with his long Poll to keep off the Duns, 'till <HI>John</HI> got
out at the Back-Door. When the Lawyers and Trades∣men
brought extravagant Bills, Sir <HI>Roger</HI> us'd to bar∣gain
before hand, for leave to cut off a quarter of a
Yard in any part of the Bill he pleased; he wore a
pair of Scissars in his Pocket for this purpose, and
would snip it off so nicely, as you cannot imagine;
like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Goldsmith he kept all your Holydays;
there was not one wanting in his Calendar; when
ready Money was scarce, he would set them a telling
a tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="5+ letters" DISP="•••••…"/> Pounds and Six-pences, Groats, and Three
pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/> Pieces: It would have done your Heart good
to have seen him charge thro' an Army of Lawyers,
Attorney's, Clerks and Tradesmen; sometimes with
Sword in Hand, at other times nuzling like an Eel in
the Mud: When a Fellow stuck like a Bur, that there
was no shaking him off, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be a mighty inqui∣sitive
about the Health of his Uncles and Aunts in the
Country; he could call them all by their Names, for
he knew every Body, and could talk to them in their
own way. The extremely Impertinent he would send
away to see some strange Sight, as the Dragon at <HI>Hock∣ley
the Hole</HI>; or bid him call the 30th of next <HI>February.</HI>
Now and then you would see him in the Kitchen,
weighing the Beef and Butter, paying ready Money,
that the Maids might not run a-tick at the Market;
and the Butchers, by bribing of them, sell Damag▪d
and Light Meat. Another time he would slip into the
Cellar, and gage the Casks: In his leisure Minutes he
<PB REF="21"/>
was posting his Books, and gathering in his Debts;
uch frugal Methods were necessary where Money was
so scarce, and Duns so numerous. All this while <HI>John</HI>
kept his Credit, could show his Head both at <HI>Change</HI>
and <HI>Westminister-Hall</HI>; no Man protested his Bill, nor
refus'd his Bond, only the Sharpers and the Scrive∣ners;
the Lawyers and other Clerks pelted Sir <HI>Roger</HI>
as he went along. The Squirters were at it with their
Kennel-Water, for they were mad for the loss of their
Bubble, and that they could not get him to Mortgage
the Mannor of <HI>Bullocks Hatch.</HI> Sir <HI>Roger</HI> shook his Ears
and nuzled along, well-satisfied within himself that he
was doing a charitable Work, in rescuing an honest
Man from the Claws of <HI>Harpies</HI> and Blood-suckers.
Mrs. Bull did all that an affectionate Wife, and a good
Housewife, could do; yet the Boundaries of Virtues
are indivisible Lines, it is impossible to march up close
to the Frontiers of Frugality, without entering the
Territories of Parsimony. Your good Housewifes,
are apt to look into the minutest Things: Therefore
some blam'd Mrs. Bull for new heel-piecing her Shoes,
grudging a quarter of a Pound of <HI>Soap</HI> and <HI>Sand</HI> to
scowre the Rooms, but especially, that she would not
allow her Maids and Apprentices the Benefit of <HI>John

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. A Continuation of the Conversation betwixt <HI>John Bull</HI> and

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull,</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is a most sad Life we lead, my Dear
to be so teaz'd paying Interest for Old
Debts, and still contracting new Ones.
However I don't blame you for vindicating your Ho∣nour
and chastizing old <HI>Lewis</HI>; to curb the Insolent,
protect the Opprest, recover ones own, and defend
what one has, are good Effects of the Law: The only
thing I want to know is how you came to make an End
of your Money before you finish'd your Law Suit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was told by the Learned in the Law,
that my Suit stood upon three firm Pillars: <HI>More Mo∣ny
for more Law, more Law for more Mony, and no</HI>
<PB REF="22"/>
<HI>Composition.</HI> More Money for more Law was plain
Demonstration, for who can go to Law without Mony?
and it was as plain, that any Man that has Mony,
may have Law for it. The third was as Evident as
the other two; for what Composition could be made
with a Rogue that never kept a Word he said?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are most likely to get out of
this Labyrinth by the second Door, by want of ready
Money to purchase this precious Commodity: But you
seem not only to have bought too much of it, but have
paid too dear for what you have bought; else how was
it possible to run so much in Debt, when, at this very
time the yearly Income of what is Mortgag'd to those
Usurers would discharge <HI>Hocus</HI>'s Bills, and give you
your Belly full of Law, or all your Life, without run∣ning
one Six Pence in Debt? You have been bred up
to Business; I suppose you can Cypher, I wonder you
never us'd your Pen and Ink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you urge me too far; prithee, dear
Wife, hold thy Tongue. Suppose a young Heir,
heedless, raw, and unexperienced, full of Spirit and
Vigour, with a favourite Passion, in the Hands of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Scriveners: Such Fellows are like your Wire
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mills, if they get hold of a Man's Finger,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Blood and Guts out of him. When I
wanted Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, half a dozen of these Fellows were al∣ways
waiting in my Antichamber, with their Securi∣ties
ready drawn. I was tempted with the Ready,
some Farm or other went to Pot. I receiv'd with one
Hand, and paid it away with the other, to Lawyers;
that, like so many Hell hounds, were ready to devour
me. Then the Rogues would plead Poverty, and
Scarcity of Money, that always ended in receiving
Ninety for the Hundred After they had got Possessi∣on
of my best Rents, they were able to supply me with
my own Mony. But what was worse, when I look'd
into the Securities, there was no Clause of Redemp∣tion.</P>
</SP>

<P>No Clause of Redemption, say you; that's
hard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>No great matter, for I cannot pay them.
They had got a worse Trick than that; the same
Man bought and Sold to himself, paid the Mony, and
gave the Acquittance: The same Man was Butcher
and Grasier, Brewer and Butler, Cook and Poulterer.
There is something still worse than all this; there came
twenty Bills upon me at once, which I had given Mo∣ny
to discharge; I was like to be pull'd to Pieces, by
Brewer, Butcher, and Baker, even my Herb-Woman
dun'd me as I went along the Streets (thanks to my
Friend Sir <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger,</HI> else I must have gone to Goal). When
I askd the meaning of this, I was told, the Mony went
<HI>to the Lawyers</HI>; Counsel won't tick, Sir; <HI>Hocus</HI> was
urging; my Book-keeper sat Sotting all Day, playing
at Purt, and All-fours: In short, by griping Usurers,
devouring Lawyers, and negligent Servants, I am
brought to this pass.</P>

<P>'Tis true, yet consider my Circumstances, my

I should have retain'd every single Person within the

the Lawyers, their Wives and Daughters, with Fid∣dles,
Hautboys, Drums and Trumpets. I was always
hot-headed; then they plac▪d me in the middle, the

<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the things that first alarm'd me
was, that they shew'd a Spite against my poor Old
Mother; <Q REND="inline">Lord (quoth I) what makes you so Jealous
<PB REF="24"/>
of a poor, old, innocent Gentlewoman, that minds
only her Prayers, and her Practice of Piety, she
never meddles in any of your Concerns? Foh (say
they) to see a handsome▪ brisk, genteel▪ young Fel∣low,
so much govern'd by a doating old Woman;
why don't yo and suck the Bubby? Do you consider
she keeps you of a good Jointure? she has the best of
your Estate settled upon her for Rent-Charge: Hang
her, old Thief, turn her out of Doors, seize her Lands,
and let her go to Law if she dares. Soft and fair,
Gentlemen (quoth I) my Mother's my Mother, our
Family are not of an unnatural Temper. Tho I
don't take all her Advice, I won't seize her Jointure;
long may she enjoy it, good Woman, I don't grudge
it her: She allows me now and then a Brace of Hun∣dreds
for my Law-Suit; that's pretty fair.</Q> About
this time the old Gentlewoman fell ill of an odd sort
of a Distemper; it began with a Coldness and Numb∣ness
in her Limbs, which by degrees affected the Nerves
(I think the Physicians call them) seiz'd the Brain,
and at last ended in a Lethargy. It betray'd it self
at first in a sort of Indifference and Carelesness in all
her Actions, Coldness to her best Friends, and an A∣version
to stir or go about the common Offices of Life.
She that was the cleanliest Creature in the World, ne∣ver
shrunk now if you set a Close-stool under her Nose.
She that would sometimes rattle off her Servants pretty
sharply, now if she saw them drink, or heard them talk
profanely, never took any notice of it. Instead of her
usual Charities to deserving Persons, she threw away
her Money upon roaring swearing Bullies, and randy
Beggars, that went about the Streets. <HI>What is the mat∣ter

us'd to do in this manner?</HI> At last the Distemper grew
more violent, and threw her downright into ravi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Fits; in which she shriek'd out so loud, that she d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦sturb'd the whole Neighbourhood. In her Fits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

differ'd strangely at the Consultation. At last they
divided into two Parties, one sided with <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>th,</HI>
and the other with <HI>R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ff. Dr.</HI> G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>th. <HI>This
Case seems to me to be plainly Hysterical; the Old Woman
is Whimsical; it is a common thing for your Old Women to
be so: I'll pawn my Life, Blisters with the Steel Diet, will
recover her.</HI> Others suggested strong Purging and Let∣ting
of Blood because she was Plethorick. Some went
so far as to say the Old Woman was mad, and nothing
would do better than a little Corporal Correction.
<HI>R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ff. Gentlemen, you are mistaken in this Case, it is
plainly an accute Distemper, and she cannot hold out three
Days, without she is supported with strong Cordials.</HI> I
came into the Room with a good deal of Concern, and
ask'd them what they thought of my Mother? <HI>In no
manner of Danger, I vow to God</HI> (quoth <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>th</HI>) <HI>the Old
Woman is Hysterical, Fanciful, Sir, I vow to God. I tell
you, Sir</HI> (says R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ff) <HI>she can't live three Days to an end,
unless there is some very effectual Course taken with her, she
has a Malignant Fever.</HI> Then Fool, Puppy, and Block∣head,
was the best Words they gave. I could hardly
restrain them from throwing the Ink-Bottles at one
another's Heads. I forgot to tell you, that one Party
of the Physicians desir'd I would take my Sister <HI>Peg</HI>
into the House to Nurse her, but the Old Gentlewoman
would not hear of that. At last one Physician ask'd
if the Lady had ever been us'd to take <HI>Laudanum</HI>; her
Maid answer'd, not that she knew; that indeed there
was a <HI>High German</HI> Livery-Man of hers, one <HI>Van Pts∣chirnsooker,</HI>
that gave her a sort of a Quack Powder.
The Physician desir'd to see it; <HI>Nay,</HI> says he, <HI>there is</HI>
Opium <HI>in this, I am sure.</HI></P>

<P>I did indeed, and discover'd a great My∣stery
of Iniquity. The Witnesses made Oath, That they
had heard some of the Livery-men frequently railing at
their Mistress. <Q REND="inline">They said, She was a troublesome
fiddle faddle old Woman, and so ceremonious that
there was no bearing of her. They were so plagu'd
with bowing and cringing as they went in and out of
the Room, that their Backs ach'd; she us'd to scold
at one for his dirty Shoes, at another for his greasie
Hair, and not combing his Head: Then she was so
passionate and fiery in her Temper, that there was no
living with her; she wanted something to sweeten
her Blood; that they never had a quiet Night's rest,
for getting up in the Morning to early Sacraments;
that they wish'd they could find some way or another
to keep the old Woman quiet in her Bed.</Q> Such Dis∣courses
were often overheard among the Livery-men,
that the said <HI>Van Ptschirnsooker</HI> had undertook this
Matter. A Maid made Affidavit, <Q REND="inline">That she had seen
the said <HI>Van Ptschirnsooker</HI> one of the Livery-Men,
frequently making up of Medicines and administring
them to all the Neighbours; that she saw him one
Morning make up the Powder which her Mistress
took; that she had the Curiosity to ask him whence
he had the Ingredients? They come (says he) from
several Parts of de World; dis I have from <HI>Geneva,</HI>
dat from <HI>Rome,</HI> this White Powder from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
and the Red from <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; but the chief Ingredi∣ent
of all comes from <HI>Turkey.</HI></Q> It was likewise proved,
that the said <HI>Van Ptschirnsooker</HI> had been frequent∣ly
seen at the <HI>Rose</HI> with <HI>Jack,</HI> who was known to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><HI>WHat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="5+ letters" DISP="•••••…"/>lum is it that makes thee jea∣lous
of thy old Friend</HI> Nicholas? <HI>Hast
thou forgot how some Years ago he took
thee out of the Spunging House?</HI> ['Tis true, my Friend
<HI>Nic.</HI> did so, and I thank him; but he made me pay a
swinging Reck'ning.] <HI>Thou begins now to repent the Bar∣gain
that thou wast so fond of; and, if thou durst, would
forswear thy own Hand and Seal. Thou sayst, that thou
hast purchas'd me too great an Estate already; when at the
same time thou knowest I have only a Mortgage: 'Tis true,
I have Possession, and the Tenants own me for Master; but,
has not Esquire</HI> South <HI>the Equity of Redemption?</HI> [No
doubt, and will redeem it very speedily; poor <HI>Nic.</HI>
has only Possession, eleven Points of the Law] <HI>As
for the Turnpikes I have set up they are for other People
not for my Friand</HI> John<HI>: I have order'd my Servant con∣stantly
to attend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et thy Carriages through without paying
any thing: only I hope thou wilt not come too heavy laden
to spoil my Ways. Certainly I have just Cause of Offence
against thee my Friend, for supposing it possible that thou and
I should ever quarrel: What Hounsfoot is it that puts these
Whims in thy Head? Ten Thousand Last of Devils haul
me if I don't love thee as I love my Life.</HI> [No question,
as the Devil loves Holy-Water!] <HI>Does not thy own
Hand and Seal oblige <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to purchase for me, till I say it is
enough? Are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Words plain. I say it is not enough.
Dost thou think thy Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd</HI> Nicholas Frog <HI>made a
Child's Bargain? Mark the Words of thy Contract,</HI>

purchas'd with my own Money, my Childrens, and
my Grand childrens Money, is not that enough? Well
<PB REF="28"/>
<HI>tota pecunia</HI> let it be, for at present I have none at all;
He would not have me purchase with other Peoples
Money sure, since <HI>tota pecunia</HI> is the Bargain; I think
it is plain, no more Money, no more Purchase.] <HI>And
whatever the World may say,</HI> Nicholas Frog <HI>is but a poor
Man in comparison of the rich, the opulent</HI> John Bull <HI>great
Clothier of the Warld. I have had many Losses, six of my
best Sheep were drown'd, and the Water has come into my
Cellar, and spoil'd a Pipe of my best Brandy: It would be a
more friendly Act in thee to carry a Brief about the Country
to repair the Losses of thy poor Friend. Is it not evident to
all the World, that I am still hem'd in by</HI> Lewis Baboon?
<HI>is he not just upon my Borders</HI>? [And so he will be if I
Purchase a thousand Acres more, unless he gets some
Body betwixt them.] I tell thee Friend <HI>John</HI> thou hast
Flatterers, that persuade thee that thou art a Man of
Business; do not believe them: If thou would'st still
leave thy Affairs in my Hands thou should'st see how
handsomly I would deal by thee. That ever thou
should'st be dazzled with the inchanted Islands, and
Mountains of Gold, that old <HI>Lewis</HI> promises thee!
'Dswounds! Why dost thou not lay out thy Money to
Purchase a Place at Court, of honest <HI>Israel</HI>? I tell
thee, thou must not so much as think of a Composition.
[Not think of a Composition, that's hard indeed; I
can't help thinking of it, if I would.] Thou complainst
of want of Money, let thy Wife and Daughter burn
the God Lace upon their Petticoats, sell thy fat Cat∣tle;
retrench but a Sirloin of Beef, and a Peck-Loaf
in a Week from thy gormandizing Guts [Retrench
my Beef, a Dog! Retrench my Beef! then it is plain
the Rascal has an ill Design upon me, he would starve
me.] Mortgage thy Manor of <HI>Bullocks Hatch,</HI> or Pawn
thy Crop for Ten Year. [A Rogue! Part with my

the World, I▪ll see him hang'd first.] Why hast thou
chang'd thy Attorney? Can any Man manage thy
Cause better for thee? [Very pleasant! because a Man
has a good Attorney, he must never make an End of
his Law-Suit.] Ah <HI>John, John,</HI> I wish thou knevvest

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of some extraordinary Things that pass'd at the <HI>Salutation</HI>
Tavern, in the Conference between <HI>Bull, Frog,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
<HI>South,</HI> and <HI>Lewis Baboon.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Frog</HI> had given his Word, that he would meet the
above mention'd Company at the Salutation, to
talk of this Agreement; tho' he durst not directly
break his Appointment, he made many a shuffling Ex∣cuse;
one time he pretended to be seized with the
Gout in his right Knee; then he got a great Cold
that had struck him deaf of one Ear; afterwards two
of his Coach-Horses fell sick, and he durst not go by
Water, for fear of catching an Ague. <HI>John</HI> would take
no Excuse but hurry'd him away: Come <HI>Nic.</HI> (<HI>says he</HI>)
let's go and hear at least what this old Fellow has to
propose; I hope there's no hurt in that. Be it so (<HI>quoth</HI>
Nic.) but if I catch any harm, woe be to you; my
Wife and Children will curse you as long as they live.
When they were come to the Salutation, <HI>John</HI> conclu∣ded
all was sure then, and that he shou'd be troubled
no more with Law affairs; he thought every Body as
plain and sincere as he was. Well Neighbours (quoth
he) let's now make an end of all Matters, and live
peaceably together for the time to come; if every bo∣dy
is as well inclin'd as I, we shall quickly come to the
upshot of our Affair: And so pointing to <HI>Frog</HI> to say
something, to the great surprize of all the Company,
<HI>Frog</HI> was seizd with a dead Palsy in the Tongue.
<HI>John</HI> began to ask him some plain Questions, and hoop'd
and hollow'd in his Ear. <HI>John Bull,</HI> Let's come to
the Point, <HI>Nic</HI>' Who would'st thou have to be the
Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>? Would'st thou have <HI>Philip Baboon</HI>? <HI>Nic,</HI>
shook his head and said nothing. <HI>John Bull</HI> Wilt thou
then have Esquire <HI>South</HI> to be Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>? <HI>Nic.</HI> shook
his Head a second time. <HI>John Bull. Then who the Devil
wilt thou have? say something or another. Nic.</HI> open▪d
his Mouth, and pointed to his Tongue, and cry'd A,
a a, a! which was as much as to say, he could not
speak. <HI>John Bull.</HI> Shall I serve <HI>Philip Baboon</HI> with
<PB REF="30"/>
Broad cloth, and accept of the Composition that he
offers, with the Liberty of his Parks and Fishponds?
Then <HI>Nic.</HI> roar'd like a Bull, O, o, o, o! If thou wilt not let me have them, wilt thou take
them thy self? Then <HI>Nic.</HI> grin'd, cackled and laugh'd,
till he was like to kill himself, and seem'd to be so
pleas'd, that he fell a frisking and dancing about the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>oom. <HI>John Bull. Shall I leave all this Matter to thy
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anagement,</HI> Nic. <HI>and go about my Business?</HI> Then <HI>Nic.</HI>
got up a Glass, and drank to <HI>John,</HI> shaking him by the
Hand till he had like to have shook his shoulder out of
Joint. <HI>John Bull. I understand thee,</HI> Nic. <HI>but I shall
make thee speak before I go.</HI> Then <HI>Nic.</HI> put his Finger in
his Cheek, and made him cry <HI>Buck,</HI> which was as much
as to say, I care not a Farthing for thee. <HI>John Bull.
I have done</HI> Nic. <HI>If thou wilt not speak, I'll make my own
Terms with old</HI> Lewis <HI>here.</HI> Then <HI>Nic</HI> loll▪d out his
Tongue, and turn'd up his Bumm to him; which was
as much as to say, Kiss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. <HI>John</HI> perceiving that <HI>Frog</HI>
would not speak, turns to old <HI>Lewis: Since we cannot
make this obstinate Fellow speak,</HI> Lewis <HI>pray condescend a
little to his Humour, and set down thy meaning upon Paper,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may answer it in another Scrap. I am infinitely
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (quoth <HI>Lewis</HI>) <HI>that it happens so unfortunately; for
playing a little at Cudgels t'other Day, a Fellow has given
me such a Rap over the Right Arm, that I am quite Lame:
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have lost the Use of my Forefinger and Thumb, so that I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hold my Pen.</HI> John Bull<HI>, That's all one, let me
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for you.</HI> Lewis. <HI>But I have a Misfortune, that I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnot read any bodies hand but my own.</HI> John Bull. <HI>Try
what you can do with your Left Hand.</HI> Lewis. <HI>That's
impossible; it will make such a Scrawl, that it will not be
legible.</HI> As they were talking of this Matter, in came
Esquire <HI>South</HI> all drest up in Feathers and Ribbons,
stark staring mad, brandishing his Sword, as if he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>ld have cut off their Heads; crying, <HI>Room, room,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the grand Esquire of the World! the Flower of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quires! What, cover'd in my Presence; I'll crush your
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouls, and crack you like Lice!</HI> With that he had like to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave struck <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Hat into the Fire; but <HI>John,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was pretty strong fisted, gave him such a Squeeze,
<PB REF="31"/>
as made his Eyes Water. He went on still in his mad
Pranks; <HI>When I am Lord of the Universe, the sun shall
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and adore me! Thou,</HI> Frog, <HI>shalt be my Bailiff;
Lewis my Taylor, and thou,</HI> John Bull<HI>, shalt be my Fool!</HI>
All this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Frog</HI> laugh▪d in his Sleeve, gave the
Esquire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Noggan of Brandy, and clap▪d him on
the Back which made him ten times madder. Poor
<HI>John</HI> stood in amaze, talking thus to himself: <HI>Well</HI>
John thou art got into rare Company! One has a dumb De∣vil▪
t'other a mad Devil, and the third a Spirit of Infir∣mity.
An honest Man has a fine time on▪t amongst such
Rogues. What art thou asking of them after all? Some
mighty Boon one would think! Only to sit quietly at thy own
Fireside. 'Sdeath, what have I to do with such Fellows!
John Bull <HI>after all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Losses and Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses can live better
without them, than they can without him. Would to God
I liv'd a thousand Leagues off them: But the Devil's in't:</HI>
John Bull <HI>is in, and</HI> John Bull <HI>must get out as well as be
can.</HI> As he was talking to himself, he observ▪d <HI>Frog</HI>
and <HI>Old Lewis</HI> edgng towards one another to Whisper;
so that <HI>John</HI> was forced to sit with his Arms a-kimbo,
to keep them asunder. Some People advis'd <HI>John</HI> to
Blood <HI>Frog</HI> under the Ton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>ue, or take away his Bread
and Butter, which would certainly make him speak;
to give Esquire <HI>South</HI> Hellebore; as for <HI>Lewis,</HI> some
were for emollient Poltass, others for opening his
Arm with an Incision knife.</P>
<P>I could not obtain from Sir <HI>Humphry,</HI> at this time,
a Copy of <HI>John</HI>▪s Letter, which he sent to his Nephew
by the young <HI>Necromancer</HI>; wherein he advises him
not to eat Butter, Ham, and drink Old Hock in a
Morning, with the Esquire and <HI>Frog,</HI> for fear of giving
him a sour Breath.</P>
