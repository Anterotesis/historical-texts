<BIBL>MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the evening, when Emily was at length
informed, that Count De Villefort requested
to see her, she guessed that Valancourt was
below, and, endeavouring to assume com∣posure
and to recollect all her spirits, she
rose and left the apartment; but on reach∣ing
the door of the library, where she ima∣gined
him to be, her emotion returned with
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
such energy, that, fearing to trust herself in
the room, The returned into the hall, where
she continued for a considerable time, un∣able
to command her agitated spirits.</P>
<P>When she could recall them, she found in
the library Valancourt, seated with the Count,
who both rose on her entrance; but she did
not dare to look at Valancourt, and the
Count, having led her to a chair, immediate∣ly
withdrew.</P>
<P>Emily remained with her eyes fixed
on the floor, under such oppression of
heart, that she could not speak, and with
difficulty breathed; while Valancourt threw
himself into a chair beside her, and, sighing
heavily, continued silent, when, had she
raised her eyes, she would have perceived
the violent emotions, with which he was
agitated.</P>
<P>At length, in a tremulous voice, he said,
"I have solicited to see you this evening,
that I might, at leasd, be spared the further
torture of suspense, which your altered
manner had occasioned me, and which the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
hints I have just received from the Count
have in part explained. I perceive I have
enemies, Emily, who envied me my late
happiness, and who have been busy in
searching out the means to destroy it: I
perceive, too, that time and absence have
weakened the affection you once felt. for
me, and that you can now easily be taught
to forget me."</P>
<P>His last words faltered, and Emily, less
able to speak than before, continued silent.</P>
<P>"O what a meeting is this!" exclaimed
Valancourt, starting from his seat, and pac∣ing
the room with hurried steps, "what a
meeting is this, aster our long—long sepa∣ration!"
Again he sat down, and, after the
struggle of a moment, he added in a firm
but despairing tone, "This is too much—I
cannot bear it! Emily, will you not speak
to me?"</P>
<P>He covered his face with his hand, as if
to conceal his emotion, and took Emily's,
which she did not withdraw. Her tears
could no longer be restrained; and, when
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
he raised his eyes and perceived that she
was weeping, all his tenderness returned,
and a gleam of hope appeared to cross his
mind, for he exclaimed, "O! you do pity
me, then, you do love me! Yes, you are
still my own Emily—let me believe those
tears, that tell me so!"</P>
<P>Emily now made an effort to recover her
firmness, and, hastily drying them, "Yes,"
said she, "I do pity you—I weep for you—but,
ought I to think of you with affec∣tion?
You may remember, that yester-even∣ing
I said, I had still sufficient confidence
in your candour to believe, that, when I
should request an explanation of your
words, you would give it. This explana∣tion
is now unnecessary, I understand them
too well; but prove, at least, that your
candour is deserving of the confidence I
give it, when I ask you, whether you are
conscious of being the same estimable Valan∣court—whom
I once loved."</P>
<P>"Once loved!" cried he,—"the same—the
same!" He paused in extreme emotion,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and then added, in a voice at once solemn,
and dejected,—"No—I am not the same!—I
am lost—I am no longer worthy of
you!"</P>
<P>He again concealed his face. Emily was
too much affected by this honest confession
to reply immediately, and, while she strug∣gled
to overcome the pleadings of her heart,
and to act with the decisive firmness, which
was necessary for her future peace, she per∣ceived
all the danger of trusting long to her
resolution, in the pretence of Valancourt,
and was anxious to conclude an interview,
that tortured them both; yet, when she
considered, that this was probably their last
meeting, her fortitude sunk at Once, and
she experienced only emotions of tenderness
and of despondency.</P>
<P>Valancourt, meanwhile, lost in emotions
of remorse and grief, which he had neither
the power, or the will to express, sat insen∣sible
almost of the presence of Emily, his
features still concealed, and his breast agi∣tated
by convulsive sighs.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
"Spare me the necessity," said Emily, re∣collecting
her fortitude, "spare me the ne∣cessity
of mentioning those circumstances of
your conduct, which oblige me to break
our connection forever.—We must part, I
now see you for the last time."</P>
<P>"Impossible!" cried Valancourt, roused
from his deep silence, "You cannot mean
what you say!—you cannot mean to throw
me from you forever!"</P>
<P>"We must part," repeated Emily, with
emphasis,—"and that forever! Your own
conduct has made this necessary,"</P>
<P>"This is the Count's determination,"
said he haughtily, "not yours, and I shall
enquire by what authority he interferes be∣tween
us." He now rose, and walked
about the room in great emotion.</P>
<P>"Let me save you from this error," said
Emily, not less agitated—"it is my deter∣mination,
and, if you reflect a moment on
your late conduct, you will perceive, that
my future peace requires it."</P>
<P>"Your future peace requires, that we
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
should part—part forever!" said Valan∣court,
"How little did I ever expect to
hear you say so!"</P>
<P>"And how little did I expect, that it
would be necessary for me to say so!" re∣joined
Emily, while her. voice softened into
tenderness, and her tears flowed again.—"That
you—you, Valancourt, would ever
fall from my esteem!"</P>
<P>He was silent a moment, as if over∣whelmed
by the consciousness of no longer
deserving this esteem, as well as the certain∣ty
of having lost it, and then, with impas∣sioned
grief, lamented the criminality of his
late conduct and the misery to which it had
reduced him, till, overcome by a recollec∣tion
of the past and a conviction of the
future, he burst into tears, and uttered only
deep and broken sighs.</P>
<P>The remorse he had expressed, and the
distress he suffered could not be witnessed
by Emily with indifference, and, had she
not called to her recollection all the cir∣cumstances,
of which Count De Villefort had
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
informed her, and all he had said of the
danger of confiding in repentance, formed
under the influence of passion, she might
perhaps have trusted to the assurances of her
heart, and have forgotten his misconduct in
the tenderness, which that repentance ex∣cited.</P>
<P>Valancourt, returning to the chair beside,
her, at length, said, in a calm voice, "'Tis
true, I am fallen—fallen from my own es∣teem!
but could you, Emily, so soon, so
suddenly resign, if you had not before ceased
to love me, or, if your conduct was not
governed by the designs, I will say, the self∣ish
designs of another person! Would you
not otherwise be willing to hope for my re∣formation—and
could you bear, by estran∣ging
me from you, to abandon me to mi∣sery—to
myself!"—Emily wept aloud.—"No,
Emily—no—you would not do this,
if you still loved me. You would find
your own happiness in saving mine."</P>
<P>"There are too many probabilities
against that hope," said E.mily, "to jus∣tify
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
me in trusting the comfort of my whole
life to it. May I not also ask, whether
you could wish me to do this, if you really
loved me?"</P>
<P>"Really loved you!" exclaimed Valan∣court—"is
it possible you can doubt my
love! Yet it is reasonable, that you should
do so, since you see, that I am less ready to
suffer the horror of parting with you, than
that of involving you in my ruin. Yes,
Emily—I am ruined—irreparably ruined—I
am involved in debts, which I can never
discharge!" Valancourt's look, which was
wild, as he spoke this, soon settled into an
expression of gloomy despair; and Emily,
while she was compelled to admire his sin∣cerity,
saw, with unutterable anguish, new
reasons for fear in the suddenness of his feel∣ings
and the extent of the misery, in which
they might involve him. After some
minutes, she seemed to contend against her
grief and to struggle for fortitude to con∣clude
the interview. I will not prolong these
moments," said she, "by a conversation,
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
which can answer no good purpose. Va∣lancourt,
farewell!"</P>
<P>"You are not going?" said he, wildly
interrupting her—"You will not leave me
thus—you will not abandon me even be∣fore
my mind has suggested any possibility
of compromise between the last indulgence of
my despair and the endurance of my loss!"
Emily was terrified by the sternness of his
look, and said, in a soothing voice, "You
have yourself acknowledged, that it is ne∣cessary
we mould part;—if you wish, that
I should believe you love me, you will re∣peat
the acknowledgment."—"Never—never,"
cried he—"I was distracted when
I made it. O! Emily—this is too much;—though
you are not deceived as to my
faults, you must be deluded into this ex∣asperation
against them. The Count is the
barrier between us; but he shall not long
remain so."</P>
<P>"You are, indeed, distracted," said
Emily, "the Count is not your enemy; on
the contrary, he is my friend, and that
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
might, in some degree, induce you to con∣sider
him as yours."—"Your friend!" said
Valancourt, hastily, "how long has he
been your friend, that he can so easily make
you forget your lover? Was it he, who re∣commended
to your favour the Monsieur
Dupont, who, you say, accompanied you
from Italy, and who, I say, has stolen your
affections? But I have no right to question
you;—you are your own mistress. Du∣pont,
perhaps, may not long triumph over
my fallen fortunes! Emily, more frightened
than before by the frantic looks of Valan∣court,
said, in a tone scarcely audible,
"For heaven's sake be reasonable—be com∣posed.
Monsieur Dupont is not your rival,
nor is the Count his advocate. You have
no rival; nor, except yourself, an enemy.
My heart is wrung with anguish, which must
increase while your frantic behaviour shews
me, more than ever, that you are no longer
the Valancourt I have been accustomed to
love."</P>
<P>He made no reply, but sat with his arms
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
rested on the table and his face concealed
by his hands; while Emily stood, silent and
trembling, wretched for herself and dread∣ing
to leave him in this state of mind.</P>
<P>"O excess of misery!" he suddenly ex∣claimed,
"that I can never lament my suf∣ferings,
without accusing myself, nor re∣member
you, without recollecting the folly
and the vice, by which I have lost you!
Why was I forced to Paris, and why did
I yield to allurements, which were to make
me despicable for ever! O! why cannot I
look back, without interruption, to those
days of innocence and peace, the days of
our early love!"—The recollection seem∣ed
to melt his heart, and the frenzy of de∣spair
yielded to tears. After a long pause,
turning towards her and taking her hand,
he said, in a softened voice, "Emily, can
you bear that we should part—can you re∣solve
to give up an heart, that loves you like
mine—an heart, which, though it has
erred—widely erred, is not irretrievable
from error, as you well know, it never can
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
be retrievable from love?" Emily made no
reply, but with her tears. "Can you,"
continued he, "can you forget all our
former days of happiness and confidence—when
I had not a thought, that I might
wish to conceal from you—when I had no
taste—no pleasures, in which you did not
participate?"</P>
<P>"O do not lead me to the remembrance
of those days," said Emily, "unless you
can teach me to forget the present; I do
not mean to reproach you; if I did, I
should be spared these tears; but why will
you render your present sufferings more
conspicuous, by contrasting them with your
former virtues?"</P>
<P>"Those virtues," said Valancourt,
"might, perhaps, again be mine, if your
affection, which nurtured them, was un∣changed;—but
I fear, indeed, I see, that
you can no longer love me; else the happy
hours, which we have passed together, would
plead for me, and you could not look back
upon them unmoved. Yet, why should I
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
torture myself with the remembrance—why
do I linger here? Am I not ruined—would
it not be madness to involve you in
my misfortunes, even if your heart was still
my own? I will not distress you further.
Yet, before I go," added he, in a solemn
voice, "let me repeat, that, whatever may∣be
my destiny—whatever I may be doomed
to suffer, I must always love you—most
fondly love you! I am going, Emily, I am
going to leave you—to leave you, forever!"
As he spoke the last words, his voice trem∣bled,
and he threw himself again into the
chair, from which he had risen. Emily
was utterly unable to leave the room, or
to say farewell. All impression of his cri∣minal
conduct and almost of his follies was
obliterated from her mind, and she was sen∣sible
only of pity and grief.</P>
<P>"My fortitude is gone," said Valancourt
at length; "I can no longer even struggle
to recall it. I cannot now leave you—I
cannot bid you an eternal farewell; say, at
least, that you will see me once again."
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Emily's heart was somewhat relieved by
the request, and she endeavoured to be∣lieve,
that she ought not to refuse it. Yet
she was embarrassed by recollecting, that
she was a visitor in the house of the Count,
who could not be pleased by the return of
Valancourt. Other considerations, how∣ever,
soon overcame this, and she granted
his request, on the condition, that he would
neither think of the Count, as his enemy,
nor Dupont as his rival. He then left
her, with a heart, so much lightened by
this short respite, that he almost lost every
former sense of misfortune.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew to her own room, that she
might compote her spirits and remove the
traces of her tears, which would encourage
the censorious remarks of the Countess and
her favourite, as well as excite the curiosity
of the rest of the family. She found it, how∣ever,
impossible to tranquillize her mind,
from which she could not expel the remem∣brance
of the late scene with Valancourt, or
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
the consciousness, that she was to see him
again, on the morrow. This meeting now
appeared more terrible to her than the last,
for the ingenuous confession he had made
of his ill conduct and his embarrassed cir∣cumstances,
with the strength and tenderness
of affection, which this confession discovered,
had deeply impressed her, and, in spite of
all she had heard and believed to his disad∣vantage,
her esteem began to return. It fre∣quently
appeared to her impossible, that he
could have been guilty of the depravities,
reported of him, which, if not inconsistent
with his warmth and impetuosity, were en∣tirely
so with his candour and sensibility.
Whatever was the criminality, which had
given rise to the reports, she could not now
believe them to be wholly true, nor that his
heart was finally closed against the charms
of virtue. The deep consciousness, which
he felt as well as expressed of his errors,
seemed to justify the opinion; and, as she un∣derstood
not the instability of youthful dis∣positions,
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
positions, when opposed by habit, and that
prosessions frequently deceive those, who
make, as well as those, who hear them, she
might have yielded to the flattering persua∣sions
of her own heart and the pleadings of
Valancourt, had she not been guided by the
superior prudence of the Count. He repre∣sented
to her, in a clear light, the danger of
her present situation, that of listening to
promises of amendment, made under the in∣fluence
of strong passion, and the slight hope,
which could attach to a connection, whose
chance of happiness rested upon the retrie∣val
of ruined circumstances and the reform
of corrupted habits. On these accounts, he
lamented, that Emily had consented to a se∣cond
interview, for he saw how much it
would shake her resolution and increase the
difficulty of her conquest.</P>
<P>Her mind was now so entirely occupied
by nearer interests, that she forgot the old
housekeeper and the promised history, which
so lately had excited her curiosity, but which
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Dorothée was probably not very anxious to
disclose, for night came; the hours passed;
and she did not appear in Emily's chamber.
With the latter it was a sleepless and dismal
night; the more she suffered her memory
to dwell on the late scenes with Valancourt,
the more her resolution declined, and she
was obliged to recollect all the arguments,
which the Count had made use of to
strengthen it, and all the precepts, which she
had received from her deceased father, on
the subject of self-command, to enable her
to act, with prudence and dignity, on this
the most severe occasion of her life. There
were moments, when all her fortitude for∣sook
her, and when, remembering the con∣fidence
of former times, she thought it im∣possible,
that she could renounce Valan∣court.
His reformation then appeared cer∣tain;
the arguments of Count De Villefort
were forgotten; she readily believed all she
wished, and was willing to encounter any
evil, rather than that of an immediate se∣paration.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Thus passed the night in ineffectual strug∣gles
between affection and reason, and she
rose, in the morning, with a mind, weakened
and irresolute, and a frame, trembling with
illness.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>VALANCOURT, meanwhile, suffered the
tortures of remorse and despair. The sight
of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with
which he first loved her, and which had suf∣fered
a temporary abatement from absence
and the passing scenes of busy life. When, on
the receipt of her letter, he set out for Lan∣guedoc,
he then knew, that his own folly
had involved him in ruin, and it was no part
of his design to conceal this from her. But
he lamented only the delay which his ill-conduct
must give to their marriage, and did
not foresee, that the information could in∣duce
her to break their connection forever.
While the prospect of this separation over∣whelmed
his mind, before stung with self-reproach,
he awaited their second inter∣view,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
in a state little short of distraction,
yet was still inclined to hope, that his plead∣ings
might prevail upon her not to exact
it. In the morning, he sent to know at
what hour she would see him; and his note
arrived, when she was with the Count, who
had sought an opportunity of again conver∣sing
with her of Valancourt; for he per∣ceived
the extreme distress of her mind,
and feared, more than ever, that her forti∣tude
would desert her. Emily having dis∣missed
the messenger, the Count returned to
the subject of their late conversation, urging
his fear of Valancourt's entreaties, and again
pointing out to her the lengthened misery,
that must ensue, if she should refuse to en∣counter
some present uneasiness. His re∣peated
arguments could, indeed, alone have
protected her from the affection she still felt
for Valancourt, and she resolved to be go∣verned
by them.</P>
<P>The hour of interview, at length, arrived.
Emily went to it, at least, with composure
of manner, but Valancourt was so much
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
agitated, that he could not speak, for several
minutes, and his first words were alternately
those of lamentation, entreaty and self-re∣proach.
Afterward, he said, "Emily, I have
loved you—I do love you, better than my life;
but I am ruined by my own conduct. Yet
I would seek to entangle you in a connec∣tion,
that must be miserable for you, rather
than subject myself to the punishment,
which is my due, the loss of you. I am a
wretch, but I will be a villain no longer.—I
will not endeavour to shake your resolu∣tion
by the pleadings of a selfish passion. I
resign you, Emily, and will endeavour to
find consolation in considering, that, though
I am miserable, you, at least, may be happy.
The merit of the sacrifice is, indeed, not
my own, for I should never have attained
strength of mind to surrender you, if your
prudence had not demanded it."</P>
<P>He paused a moment, while Emily at∣tempted
to conceal the tears, which came to
her eyes. She would have said, "You
speak now, as you were wont to do," but
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
she checked herself.—"Forgive me, Emi∣ly,"
said he, "all the sufferings I have oc∣casioned
you, and, sometimes, when you
think of the wretched Valancourt, remem∣ber,
that his only consolation would be to
believe, that you are no longer unhappy by
his folly." The tears now fell fast upon her
cheek, and he was relapsing into the phrensy
of despair, when Emily endeavoured to re∣call
her fortitude and to terminate an inter∣view,
which only seemed to increase the dis∣tress
of both. Perceiving her tears and that
she was rising to go, Valancourt struggled,
once more, to overcome his own feelings
and to sooth hers. "The remembrance
of this sorrow," said he, "shall in future
be my protection. O! never again will ex∣ample,
or temptation have power to seduce
me to evil, exalted as I shall be by the re∣collection
of your grief for me."</P>
<P>Emily was somewhat comforted by this
assurance. "We are now parting for ever,"
said she; "but, if my happiness is dear to
you, you will always remember, that no∣thing
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
can contribute to it more, than to be∣lieve,
that you have recovered your own es∣teem."
Valancourt took her hand;—his eyes
were covered with tears, and the farewell he
would have spoken was lost in sighs. After a
few moments, Emily said, with difficulty and
emotion, "Farewell, Valancourt, may you
be happy!" She repeated her "farewell,"
and attempted to withdraw her hand, but
he still held it and bathed it with his tears.
"Why prolong these moments?" said Emily,
in a voice scarcely audible, "they are too
painful to us both." "This is too—too
much," exclaimed Valancourt, resigning her
hand and throwing himself into a chair,
where he covered his face with his hands
and was overcome, for some moments, by
convulsive sighs. After a long pause, du∣ring
which Emily wept in silence, and Va∣lancourt
seemed struggling with his grief,
she again rose to take leave of him. Then,
endeavouring to recover his composure, "I
am again afflicting you," said he, "but let
the anguish I suffer plead for me." He
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
then added, in a solemn voice, which fre∣quently
trembled with the agitation of his
heart, "Farewell, Emily, you will always be
the only object of my tenderness. Sometimes
you will think of the unhappy Valancourt,
and it will be with pity, though it may not
be with esteem. O! what is the whole
world to me, without you—without your
esteem!" He checked himself—"I am
falling again into the error I have just la∣mented.
I must not intrude longer upon
your patience, or I shall relapse into de∣spair."</P>
<P>He once more bade Emily adieu, pressed
her hand to his lips, looked at her,
for the last time, and hurried out of the
room.</P>
<P>Emily remained in the chair, where he
had left her, oppressed with a pain at her
heart, which scarcely permitted her to
breathe, and listening to his departing steps,
sinking fainter and fainter, as he crossed
the hall. She was, at length, roused by the
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
voice of the Countess in the garden, and,
her attention being then awakened, the
first object, which struck her sight, was the
vacant chair, where Valancourt had sat. The
tears, which had been, for some time, repress∣ed
by the kind of astonishment, that fol∣lowed
his departure▪ now came to her relief,
and she was, at length, sufficiently composcd
to return to her own room.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE now return to the mention of
Montoni, whose rage and disappointment
were soon lost in nearer interests, than any,
which the unhappy Emily had awakened.
His depredations having exceeded their usual
limits, and reached an extent, at which neither
the timidity of the then-commercial senate
of Venice, nor their hope of his occasional
assistance would permit them to connive,
the same effort, it was resolved, should com∣plete
the suppression of his power and the
correction of his outrages. While a corps
of considerable strength was upon the point
of receiving orders to march for Udolpho,
a young officer, prompted partly by resent∣ment,
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
for some injury, received from Mon∣toni,
and partly by the hope of distinction,
solicited an interview with the Minister,
who directed the enterprise. To him he
represented, that the situation of Udolpho
rendered it too strong to be taken by open
force, except after some tedious operations;
that Montoni had lately shewn how capable
he was of adding to its strength all the ad∣vantages,
which could be derived from the
skill of a commander; that so considerable
a body of troops, as that allotted to the
expedition, could not approach Udolpho
without his knowledge, and that it was not
for the honour of the republic to have a
large part of its regular force employed,
for such a time as the siege of Udolpho
would require, upon the attack of a hand∣ful
of banditti. The object of the expedi∣tion,
he thought, might be accomplished
much more safely and speedily by mingling
contrivance with force. It was possible to
meet Montoni and his party, without their
walls, and to attack them then; or, by ap∣proaching
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
the fortress, with the secrecy, con∣sistent
with the march of smaller bodies of
troops, to take advantage either of the
treachery, or negligence of some of his
party, and to rush unexpectedly upon the
whole even in the castle of Udolpho.</P>
<P>This advice was seriously attended to, and
the officer, who gave it, received the com∣mand
of the troops, demanded for his pur∣pose.
His first efforts were accordingly those
of contrivance alone. In the neighbour∣hood
of Udolpho, he waited, till he had secu∣red
the assistance of several of the condottieri,
of whom he found none, that he addressed,
unwilling to punish their imperious master
and to secure their own pardon from the senate.
He learned also the number of Montoni's
troops, and that it had been much increased,
since his late successes. The conclusion of
his plan was soon effected. Having returned
with his party, who received the watch-word
and other assistance from their friends with∣in,
Montoni and his officers were surprised
by one division, who had been directed to
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
their apartment, while the other maintained
the slight combat, which preceded the sur∣render
of the whole garrison. Among the
persons, seized with Montoni, was Orsino,
the assassin, who had joined him on his first
arrival at Udolpho, and whole concealment
had been made known to the senate by
Count Morano, after the unsuccessful at∣tempt
of the latter to carry off Emily. It
was, indeed, partly for the purpose of cap∣turing
this man, by whom one of the senate
had been murdered, that the expedition
was undertaken, and its success was so ac∣ceptable
to them, that Morano was instantly
released, notwithstanding the political suspi∣cions,
which Montoni, by his secret accu∣sation,
had excited against him. The ce∣lerity
and ease, with which this whole trans∣action
was completed, prevented it from at∣tracting
curiosity, or even from obtaining
a place in any of the published records of
that time; so that Emily, who remained in
Languedoc, was ignorant of the defeat and
signal humiliation of her late persecutor.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Her mind was now occupied with suf∣ferings,
which no effort of reason had yet been
able to controul. Count de Villefort, who
sincerely attempted whatever benevolence
could suggest for softening them, sometimes
allowed her the solitude she wished for,
sometimes led her into friendly parties, and
constantly protected her, as much as possi∣ble,
from the shrewd enquiries and critical
conversation of the Countess. He often in∣vited
her to make excursions, with him and
his daughter, during which he conversed
entirely on questions, suitable to her taste,
without appearing to consult it, and thus
endeavoured gradually to withdraw her
from the subject of her grief, and to awake
other interests in her mind. Emily, to
whom he appeared as the enlightened friend
and protector of her youth, soon felt for him
the tender affection of a daughter, and her
heart expanded to her young friend Blanche,
as to a sister, whose kindness and simplicity
compensated for the want of more brilliant
qualities. It was long before she could suf∣ficiently
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
abstract her mind from Valancourt
to listen to the story, promised by old Do∣rothée,
concerning which her curiosity had
once been so deeply interested; but Doro∣thée,
at length, reminded her of it, and
Emily desired, that she would come, that
night, to her chamber.</P>
<P>Still her thoughts were employed by con∣siderations,
which weakened her curiosity,
and Dorothée's tap at the door, soon after
twelve, surprised her almost as much as if
it had not been appointed. "I am come,
at last, lady," said she; "I wonder what
it is makes my old limbs shake so, to∣night.
I thought, once or twice, I should
have dropped, as I was a coming." Emily
seated her in a chair, and desired, that she
would compose her spirits, before she entered
upon the subject, that had brought her
thither. "Alas," said Dorothée, "it is
thinking of that, I believe, which has dis∣turbed
me so. In my way hither too, I
passed the chamber, where my dear lady died,
and every thing was so still and gloomy
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
about me, that I almost fancied I saw her,
as she appeared upon her death-bed."</P>
<P>Emily now drew her chair near to Doro∣thée,
who went on. "It is about twenty
years since my lady Marchioness came a
bride to the chateau. O! I well remember
how she looked, when she came into the
great hall, where we servants were all assem∣bled
to welcome her, and how happy my
lord the Marquis seemed. Ah! who would
have thought then!—But, as I was saying,
ma'amselle, I thought the Marchioness,
with all her sweet looks, did not look happy
at heart, and so I told my husband, and he
said it was all fancy; so I said no more, but
I made my remarks, for all that. My lady
Marchioness was then about your age, and,
as I have often thought, very like you.
Well! my lord the Marquis kept open
house, for a long time, and gave such en∣tertainments
and there were such gay doings
as have never been in the chateau since. I
was younger, ma'amselle, then; than I
am now, and was as gay as the best of
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
them. I remember I danced with Philip,
the butler, in a pink gown, with yellow
ribbons, and a coif, not such as they wear
now, but plaited high, with ribbons all about
it. It was very becoming truly;—my lord,
the Marquis, noticed me. Ah! he was a
good-natured gentleman then—who. would
have thought that he!"—</P>
<P>"But the Marchioness, Dorothée," said
Emily, "you was telling me of her."</P>
<P>"O yes, my lady Marchioness, I thought
she did not seem happy at heart, and once,
soon after the marriage, I caught her crying
in her chamber; but, when she saw me, she
dried her eyes, and pretended to smile. I
did not dare then to ask what was the mat∣ter;
but, the next time I saw her crying, I
did, and she seemed displeased;—so I said
no more. I found out, some time after, how
it was. Her father, it seems, had commanded
her to marry my lord, the Marquis, for his
money, and there was another nobleman, or
else a chevalier, that she liked better and
that was very fond of her, and she fretted
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
for the loss of him, I fancy, but she never
told me so. My lady always tried to conceal
her tears from the Marquis, for I have often
seen her, after she has been so sorrowful,
look so calm and sweet, when he came
into the room! But my lord, all of a sudden,
grew gloomy and fretful, and very unkind
sometimes to my lady. This afflicted her
very much, as I saw, for she never com∣plained,
and she used to try so sweetly to
oblige him and to bring him into a good
humour, that my heart has often ached to see
it. But he used to be stubborn, and give her
harsh answers, and then, when she found it all
in vain, she would go to her own room, and
cry so! I used to hear her in the anti-room,
poor dear lady! but I seldom ventured to go
to her. I used, sometimes, to think my lord
was jealous. To be sure my lady was
greatly admired, but she was too good to
deserve suspicion. Among the many; che∣valiers,
that visited at the chateau, there
was one, that I always thought seemed just
suited for my lady; he was so courteous, yet
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
so spirited, and there was such a grace, as it
were, in all he did, or said. I always ob∣served,
that, whenever he had been there,
the Marquis was more gloomy and my lady
more thoughtful, and it came into my head,
that this was the chevalier she ought to have
married, but I never could learn for cer∣tain."</P>
<P>"What was the chevalier's name Doro∣thée?"
said Emily.</P>
<P>"Why that I will not tell even to you,
ma'amselle, for evil may come of it. I once
heard from a person, who is since dead, that
the Marchioness was not in law the wife of
the Marquis, for that she had before been
privately married to the gentleman she was
so much attached to, and was afterwards
afraid to own it to her father, who was a very
stern man; but this seems very unlikely,
and I never gave much faith to it. As I
was saying, the Marquis was most out of
humour, as I thought, when the chevalier
I spoke of had been at the chateau, and, at
last, his ill treatment of my lady made her
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
quite miserable. He would see hardly any
visitors at the castle, and made her live almost
by herself. I was her constant attendant,
and saw all she suffered, but still she never
eomplained.</P>
<P>"After matters had gone on thus, for near
a year, my lady was taken ill, and I thought
her long fretting had made her so,—but,
alas! I fear it was worse than that."</P>
<P>"Worse! Dorothée," said Emily, "can
that be possible?"</P>
<P>"I fear, it was so, madam, there were
strange appearances! But I will only tell
what happened. My lord, the Marquis—"</P>
<P>"Hush, Dorothée, what sounds were
those?" said Emily.</P>
<P>Dorothée changed countenance, and,
while they both listened, they heard, on the
stillness of the night, music of uncommon
sweetness.</P>
<P>"I have surely heard that voice before!"
said Emily, at length.</P>
<P>"I have often heard it, and at this same
hour," said Dorothée, solemnly, "and, if spirits
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
ever bring music—that is surely the music
of one!"</P>
<P>Emily, as the sounds drew nearer, knew
them to be the same she had formerly heard
at the time of her father's death, and, whether
it was the remembrance they now revived
of that melancholy event, or that she was
struck with superstitious awe, it is certain
she was so much affected, that she had nearly
fainted.</P>
<P>"I think I once told you, madam," said
Dorothée, "that I first heard this music,
soon after my lady's death! I well remem∣ber
the night!"—</P>
<P>"Hark! it comes again!" said Emily,
"let us open the window, and listen."</P>
<P>They did so; but, soon, the sounds
floated gradually away into distance, and all
was again still; they seemed to have sunk
among the woods, whose tufted tops were
visible upon the clear horizon, while every
other feature of the scene was involved in
the night-shade, which, however, allowed
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
the eye an indistinct view of some objects in
the garden below.</P>
<P>As Emily leaned on the window, gazing
with a kind of thrilling awe upon the obscu∣rity
beneath, and then upon the cloudless
arch above, enlightened only by the stars,
Dorothée, in a low voice, resumed her nar∣rative.</P>
<P>"I was saying, ma'amselle, that I well
remember when first I heard that music.
It was one night, soon after my lady's death,
that I had sat up later than usual, and I
don't know how it was, but I had been
thinking a great deal about my poor mis∣tress,
and of the sad scene I had lately wit∣nessed.
The chateau was quite still, and
I was in a chamber at a good distance from
the rest-of the servants, and this, with the
mournful things I had been thinking of,
I suppose, made me low spirited, for I felt
very lonely and forlorn, as it were, and list∣ened
often, wishing to hear a sound in the
chateau, for you know, ma'amselle, when
one can hear people moving, one does not
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
so much mind, about, one's fears. But all
the servants were gone to bed, and I sat,
thinking and thinking, till I was almost
afraid to look round the room, and my
poor lady's countenance often came to my
mind, such as I had seen her when she was
dying, and, once or twice, I almost thought
I saw her before me,—when suddenly I
heard such sweet mosic! It seemed just at
my window, and I shall never forget what
I felt. I had not power to move from my
chair, but then, when I thought it was my
dear lady's voice, the tears came to my
eyes. I had often heard her sing, in her
life-time, and to be sure she had a very fine
voice; it had made me cry to hear her,
many a time, when she has sat in her oriel,
of an evening, playing upon her lute such
sad songs, and singing so. O! it went to
one's heart! I. have listened in the anti∣chamber,
for the hour together, and she
would sometimes sit playing, with the win∣dow
open, when it was summer time, till
it was quite dark, and when I have gone
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
in, to shut it, she has hardly seemed to know
what hour it was. But, as I said, madam,
continued Dorothée, "when first I heard
the music, that came just now, I thought
it was my late lady's, and I have often
thought so again, when I have heard it, as
I have done at intervals, ever since. Some∣times,
many months have gone by, but
still it has returned."</P>
<P>"It is extraordinary," observed Emily,
"that no person has yet discovered the mu∣sician."</P>
<P>"Aye, ma'amselle, if it had been any
thing earthly it would have been discover∣ed
long ago, but who could have courage
to follow a spirit, and if they had, what
good could it do?—for spirits, <HI>you know,</HI>
ma'am, can take any shape, or no shape,
and they will be here, one minute, and, the
next perhaps, in a quite different place!"</P>
<P>"Pray resume your story of the Mar∣chioness,"
said Emily, "and acquaint me
with the manner of her death."</P>
<P>"I will, ma'am," said Dorothée, "but
shall we leave the window?"</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44"/>
"This cool air refreshes me," replied
Emily, "and I love to hear it creep along
the woods, and to look upon this dusky
landscape. You was speaking of my lord,
the Marquis, when the music interrupted
us."</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, my lord, the Marquis, be∣came
more and more gloomy; and my lady
grew worse and worse, till, one night, she was
taken very ill, indeed. I was called up, and,
when I came to her bed-side, I was shocked
to see her countenance—it was so changed!
She looked piteously up at me, and de∣sired
I would call the Marquis again, for
he was not yet come, and tell him she had
something particular to say to him. At last,
he came, and he did, to be sure, seem very
sorry to see her, but he said very little. My
lady told him she felt herself to be dying,
and wished to speak with him alone, and
then I left the room, but I shall never for∣get
his look as I went."</P>
<P>"When I returned, I ventured to remind
my lord about sending for a doctor, for I
fupposed he had forgot to do so, in his
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
grief; but my lady said it was then too
late; but my lord, so far from thinking so,
seemed to think lightly of her disorder—till
she was seized with such terrible pains!
O, I never shall forget her shriek! My lord
then sent off a man and horse for the doc∣tor,
and walked about the room and all
over the chateau, in the greatest distress;
and I staid by my dear lady, and did what
I could to ease her sufferings. She had in∣tervals
of ease, and in one of these she sent
for my lord again; when he came, I was
going, but she desired I would not leave
her. O! I shall never forget what a scene
passed—I can hardly bear to think of it
now! My lord was almost distracted, for
my lady behaved with so much goodness,
and took such pains to comfort him, that,
if he ever had suffered a suspicion to enter his
head, he must now have been convinced he
was wrong. And to be sure he did seem
to be overwhelmed with the thought of his
treatment of her, and this affected her so
much, that she fainted away.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
"We then got my lord out of the room;
he went into his library, and threw himself
on the floor, and there he staid, and would
hear no reason, that was talked to him.
When my lady recovered, she enquired for
him, but, afterwards, said she could not bear
to see his grief, and desired we would let her
die quietly. She died in my arms, ma'am∣selle,
and she went off as peacefully as a
child, for all the violence of her disorder
was passed."</P>
<P>Dorothée paused, and wept, and Emily
wept with her; for she was much affected
by the goodness of the late Marchioness,
and by the meek patience, with which she
had suffered.</P>
<P>"When the doctor came," resumed Do∣rothée,
"alas! he came too late; he ap∣peared
greatly shocked to see her, for soon
after her death a frightful blackness spread
all over her face. When he had sent the
attendants out of the room, he asked me se∣veral
odd questions about the Marchioness,
particularly concerning the manner, in
which she had been seized, and he often
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
shook his head at my answers, and seemed
to mean more, than he chose to say. But
I understood him too well. However, I
kept my remarks to myself, and only told
them to my husband, who bade me hold
my tongue. Some of the other servants,
however, suspected what I did, and strange
reports were whispered about the neigh∣bourhood,
but nobody dared to make any
stir about them. When my lord heard that
my lady was dead, he shut himself up, and
would see nobody but the doctor, who
used to be with him alone, sometimes for an
hour together; and, after that, the doctor
never talked with me again about my lady.
When she was buried in the church of the
convent, at a little distance yonder, if the
moon was up you might see the towers
here, ma'amselle, all my lord's vassals fol∣lowed
the funeral, and there was not a dry
eye among them, for she had done a deal
of good among the poor. My lord, the
Marquis, I never saw any body so melan∣choly
as he was asterwards, and sometimes
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
he would be in such fits of violence, that
we almost thought he had loft his senses.
He did not stay long at the chateau, but
joined his regiment, and, soon after, all the
servants, except my husband and I, received
notice to go, for my lord went to the wars.
I never saw him after, for he would not re∣turn
to the chateau, though it is such a fine
place, and never finished those fine rooms
he was building on the west side of it, and
it has, in a manner, been shut up ever since,
till my lord the Count came here."</P>
<P>"The death of the Marchioness appears
extraordinary," said Emily, who was anx∣ious
to know more than she dared to ask.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," replied Dorothée, "it
was extraordinary; I have told you all I
saw, and you may easily guess what I think.
I cannot say more, because I would not
spread reports, that might offend my lord
the Count."</P>
<P>"You are very right," said Emily;—"where
did the Marquis die?"—" In the
north of France, I believe, ma'amselle," re∣plied
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
Dorothée. "I was very glad, when I
heard my lord the Count was coming, for
this had been a sad desolate place, these
many years, and we heard such strange
noises, sometimes, after my lady's death,
that, as I told you before, my husband and
I left it for a neighbouring cottage. And
now, lady, I have told you all this sad his∣tory,
and all my thoughts, and you have
promised, you know, never to give the least
hint about it."—"I have," said Emily,
"and I will be faithful to my promise,
Dorothée;—what you have told has inter∣ested
me more than you can imagine. I
only wish I could prevail upon you to tell
the name of the chevalier, whom you
thought so deserving of the Marchioness."</P>
<P>Dorothée, however, steadily refused to
do this, and then returned to the notice of
Emily's likeness to the late Marchioness.
"There is another picture of her," added
she," hanging in a room of the suite, which
was shut up. It was drawn, as I have
heard, before she was married, and is much
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
more like you than the miniature." When
Emily expressed a strong desire to see this,
Dorothée replied, that she did not like to
open those rooms; but Emily reminded
her, that the Count had talked the other
day of ordering them to be opened; of
which Dorothée seemed to consider much,
and then she owned, that she should feel
less, if she went into them with Emily first,
than otherwise, and at length promised to
shew the picture.</P>
<P>The night was too far advanced and
Emily was too much affected by the nar∣rative
of the scenes, which had passed in
those apartments, to wish to visit them at
this hour, but she requested that Dorothée
would return on the following night, when
they were not likely to be observed, and
conduct her thither. Besides her wish to
examine the▪ portrait, she felt a thrilling
curiosity to see the chamber, in which
the Marchioness▪ had died, and which Do∣rothée
had said remained, with the bed
and furniture, just as when the corpse was
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
removed for interment. The solemn emo∣tions,
which the expectation of viewing
such a scene had awakened, were in unison
with the present tone of her mind, depressed
by severe disappointment. Cheerful objects
rather added to, than removed this depres∣sion;
but, perhaps, she yielded too much to
her melancholy inclination, and imprudent∣ly
lamented the misfortune, which no vir∣tue
of her own could have taught her to
avoid, though no effort of reason could
make her look unmoved upon the self-de∣gradation
of him, whom she had once es∣teemed
and loved.</P>
<P>Dorothée promised to return, on the fol∣lowing
night, with the keys of the cham∣bers,
and then wished Emily good repose,
and departed. Emily, however, continued
at the window, musing upon the melan∣choly
fate of the Marchioness and listening,
in awful expectation, for a return of the
music. But the stillness of the night re∣mained
long unbroken, except by the mur∣muring
sounds of the woods, as they wav∣ed
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
in the breeze, and then by the distant
bell of the convent, linking one. She now
withdrew from the window, and, as she
sat at her bed-side, indulging melancholy
reveries, which the loneliness of the hour
assisted, the stillness was suddenly interrupt∣ed
not by music, but by very uncommon
sounds, that seemed to come either from the
room, adjoining her own, or from one be∣low.
The terrible catastrophe, that had been
related to her, together with the mysterious
circumstances, said to have since occurred
in the chateau, had so much shocked her
spirits, that she now sunk, for a moment,
under the weakness of superstition. The
sounds, however, did not return, and she
retired, to forget in sleep the disastrous sto∣ry
she had heard.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the next night, about the same hour
as before, Dorothée came to Emily's cham∣ber,
with the keys of that suite of rooms,
which had been particularly appropriated
to the late Marchioness. These extended
along the north side of the chateau, form∣ing
part of the old building; and, as
Emily's room was in the south, they had to
pass over a great extent of the castle, and by
the chambers of several of the family, whose
observations Dorothée was anxious to avoid,
since it might excite enquiry and raise re∣ports,
such as would displease the Count.
She, therefore, requested, that Emily would
wait half an hour, before they ventured
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
forth, that they might be certain all the ser∣vants
were gone to bed. It was nearly one,
before the chateau was perfectly still, or
Dorothée thought it prudent to leave the
chamber. In this interval, her spirits seem∣ed
to be greatly affected by the remem∣brance
of past events, and by the prospect
of entering again upon places, where these
had occurred, and in which she had not
been for so many years. Emily too was
affected, but her feelings had more of so∣lemnity,
and less of fear. From the si∣lence,
into which reflection and expectation
had thrown them, they, at length, roused
themselves, and left the chamber. Doro∣thée,
at first, carried the lamp, but her hand
trembled so much with infirmity and alarm,
that Emily took it from her, and offered
her arm, to support her feeble steps.</P>
<P>They had to descend the great stair-case,
and, after passing over a wide extent of the
chateau, to ascend another, which led to the
suite of rooms they were in quest of. They
stepped cautiously along the open corridor,
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
that ran round the great hall, and into
which the chambers of the Count, Coun∣tess,
and the lady Blanch, opened, and, from
thence, descending the chief stair-case, they
crossed the hall itself. Proceeding through
the servants hall, where the dying embers
of a wood fire still glimmered on the
hearth, and the supper table was surrounded
by chairs, that obstructed their passage,
they came to the foot of the back stair-case.
Old Dorothée here paused, and looked
around; "Let us listen," said she, "if any
thing is stirring; Ma'amselle, do you hear
any voice?" "None," said Emily, "there
certainly is no person up in the chateau,
besides ourselves."—"No, ma'amselle," said
Dorothée "but I have never been here at
this hour before, and, after what I know, my
fears are not wonderful."—"What do
you know?" said Emily.—"O ma'am∣selle,
we have no time for talking now; let
us go on. That door on the left is the one
we must open."</P>
<P>They proceeded, and, having reached the
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
top of the stair-case, Dorothée. applied the
key to the lock. "Ah," said she, as she
endeavoured to turn it, "so many years
have passed since this was opened, that I fear
it will not move." Emily was more success∣ful,
and they presently entered a spacious
and ancient chamber.</P>
<P>"Alas! exclaimed Dorothée, as she en∣tered,
"the last time I passed through this
door—I followed my poor lady's corpse!"</P>
<P>Emily, struck with the circumstance, and
affected by the dusky and solemn air of
the apartment, remained silent, and they
passed on through a long suite of rooms, till
they came to one more spacious than the
rest, and rich in the remains of faded magni∣ficence.</P>
<P>"Let us rest here awhile, madam," said
Dorothée faintly, "we are going into the
chamber, where my lady died! that door
opens into it. Ah, ma'amselle! why did
you persuade me to come?"</P>
<P>Emily drew one of the massy arm-chairs,
with which the apartment was furnished,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
and begged Dorothée would sit down, and
try to compose her spirits.</P>
<P>"How the sight of this place brings all
that passed formerly to my mind!" said Do∣rothée;
"it seems as if it was but yester∣day
since all that sad affair happened!"</P>
<P>"Hark! what noise is that?" said
Emily.</P>
<P>Dorothée, half starting from her chair,
looked round the apartment, and they lis∣tened—but,
every thing remaining still, the
old woman spoke again upon the subject of
her sorrow. "This saloon, ma'amselle,
was in my lady's time the finest apartment
in the chateau, and it was fitted up accord∣ing
to her own taste. All this grand furni∣ture,
but you can now hardly see what it is
for the dust, and our light is none of the
bed—ah! how I have seen this room lighted
up in my lady's time!—all this grand fur∣niture
came from Paris, and was made after
the fashion of some in the Louvre there, ex∣cept
those large glasses, and they came from
some outlandish place, and that rich tapes∣try.
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
How the colours are faded already!—since
I saw it last!"</P>
<P>"I understood, that was twenty years
ago," observed Emily.</P>
<P>"Thereabout, madam," said Dorothée,
"and well remembered, but all the time
between then and now seems as nothing.
That tapestry used to be greatly admired at,
it tells the stories out of some famous book,
or other, but I have forgot the name."</P>
<P>Emily now rose to examine the figures it
exhibited, and discovered, by verses in the
Provençal tongue, wrought underneath each
scene, that it exhibited stories from some of
the most celebrated ancient romances.</P>
<P>Dorothée's spirits being now more com∣posed,
she rose, and unlocked the door that
led into the late Marchioness's apartment,
and Emily passed into a lofty chamber,
hung round with dark arras, and so spa∣cious,
that the lamp she held up did not shew
its extent; while Dorothée, when she en∣tered,
had dropped into a chair, where,
sighing deeply, she scarcely trusted herself
with the view of a scene so affecting to her.
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
It was some time before Emily perceived,
through the dusk, the bed on which the
Marchioness was said to have died; when,
advancing to the upper end of the room,
she discovered the high canopied tester of
dark green damask, with the curtains de∣scending
to the floor in the fashion of a
tent, half drawn, and remaining apparently,
as they had been left twenty years before▪
and over the whole bedding was thrown a
counterpane, or pall, of black velvet, that
hung down to the floor. Emily shuddered,
as she held the lamp over it, and looked
within the dark curtains, where she almost
expected to have seen a human face, and,
suddenly remembering the horror she had
suffered upon discovering the dying Ma∣dame
Montoni in the turret-chamber of
Udolpho, her spirits fainted, and she was
turning from the bed, when Dorothée, who
had now reached it, exclaimed, "Holy
Virgin! methinks I see my lady stretched
upon that pall—as when last I saw hen!"</P>
<P>Emily, shocked by this exclamation,
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
looked involuntarily again within the cur∣tains,
but the blackness of the pall only ap∣peared;
while Dorothée was compelled to
support herself upon the side of the bed,
and presently tears brought her some relief.</P>
<P>"Ah!" said she, after she had wept
awhile, "it was here I sat on that terrible
night, and held my lady's hand, and heard
her last words, and saw all her sufferings—<HI>here</HI>
she died in my arms!"</P>
<P>"Do not indulge these painful recollec∣tions,"
said Emily, "let us go. Shew me
the picture you mentioned, if it will not
too much affect you."</P>
<P>"It hangs in the oriel," said Dorothée
rising, and going towards a small door near
the bed's head, which she opened, and
Emily followed with the light, into the
closet of the late Marchioness.</P>
<P>"Alas! there she is, ma'amselle," said
Dorothée, pointing to a portrait of a lady,
"there is her very self! just as she looked
when she came first to the chateau. You
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
see, madam, she was all blooming like you,
then—and so soon to be cut off!"</P>
<P>While Dorothée spoke, Emily was at∣tentively
examining the picture, which
bore a strong resemblance to the miniature,
though the expression of the countenance
in each was somewhat different; but still
she thought she perceived something of
that pensive melancholy in the portrait,
which so strongly characterised the minia∣ture.</P>
<P>"Pray, ma'amselle, stand beside the pic∣ture,
that I may look at you together,"
said Dorothée, who, when the request was
complied with, exclaimed again at the resem∣blance.
Emily also, as she gazed upon it,
thought that she had somewhere seen a per∣son
very like it, though she could not now
recollect who this was.</P>
<P>In this closet were many memorials of
the departed Marchioness; a robe and se∣veral
articles of her dress were scattered
upon the chairs, as if they had just been
thrown off. On the floor, were a pair of
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
black sattin slippers, and, on the dressing∣table,
a pair of gloves and a long black
veil, which, as Emily took it up to exa∣mine,
she perceived was dropping to pieces
with age.</P>
<P>"Ah!" said Dorothée, observing the
veil, "my lady's hand laid it there; it has
never been moved since!"</P>
<P>Emily, shuddering, immediately laid it
down again. "I well remember seeing
her take it off," continued Dorothée, "it
was on the night before her death, when she
had returned from a little walk I had per∣suaded
her to take in the gardens, and she
seemed, refreshed by it. I told her how
much better she looked, and I remember
what a languid smile she gave me; but,
alas! she little thought, or I either, that
she was to die, that night."</P>
<P>Dorothée wept again, and then, taking
up the veil, threw it suddenly over Emily▪
who shuddered to find it wrapped round
her, descending even to her feet, and, as she
endeavoured to throw it off, Dorothée in∣treated
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
that she would keep it on for one
moment. "I thought," added she, "how
like you would look to my dear mistress in
that veil;—may your life, ma'amselle, be
a happier one than hers!"</P>
<P>Emily, having disengaged herself from
the veil, laid it again on the dressing-table,
and surveyed the closet, where every object,
on which her eye fixed, seemed to speak of
the Marchioness. In a large oriel window
of painted glass, stood a table, with a silver
crucifix, and a prayer-book open; and
Emily remembered with emotion what Do∣rothée
had mentioned concerning her cus∣torn
of playing on her lute in this window,
before she observed the lute itself, lying on
a corner of the table, as if it had been care∣lessly
placed there by the hand, that had so
often awakened it.</P>
<P>"This is a sad forlorn place!" said Do∣rothée,
"for, when my dear lady died, I had
no heart to put it to rights, or the chamber
either; and my lord never came into the
rooms after, so they remain just as they
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
did when my lady was removed for inter∣ment."</P>
<P>While Dorothée spoke, Emily was still
looking on the lute, which was a Spanish
one, and remarkably large; and then, with
a hesitating hand, she took it up, and passed
her fingers over the chords. They were
out of tune, but uttered a deep and full
sound. Dorothée started at their well∣known
tones, and, seeing the lute in Emily's
hand, said, "This is the lute my lady
Marchioness loved so! I remember when
last she played upon it—it was on the night
that she died. I came as usual to undress
her, and, as I entered the bed-chamber, I
heard the sound of music from the oriel,
and perceiving it was my lady's, who was
sitting there, I stepped softly to the door,
which stood a little open, to listen; for the
music—though it was mournful—was so
sweet! There I saw her, with the lute in
her hand, looking upwards, and the tears
fell upon her cheeks, while she sung a vesper
hymn, so soft, and so solemn! and her voice
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
trembled, as it were, and then she would
stop for a moment, and wipe away her
tears, and go on again, lower than before.
O! I had often listened to my lady, but ne∣ver
heard any thing so sweet as this; it
made me cry, almost, to hear it. She had
been at prayers, I fancy, for there was the
book open on the table beside her—aye,
and there it lies open still! Pray, let us
leave the oriel, ma'amselle," added Do∣rothée,
"this is a heart-breaking place!"</P>
<P>Having returned into the chamber, she
desired to look once more upon the bed,
when, as they came opposite to the open
door, leading into the saloon, Emily, in the
partial gleam, which the lamp threw into
it, thought she saw something glide along
into the obscurer part of the room. Her
spirits had been much affected by the sur∣rounding
scene, or it is probable this cir∣cumstance,
whether real or imaginary, would
not have affected her in the degree it did;
but she endeavoured to conceal her emo∣tion
from Dorothée, who, however, observ∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
her countenance change, enquired if she
was ill.</P>
<P>"Let us go," said Emily, faintly, "the
air of these rooms is unwholesome▪" but,
when she attempted to do so, considering
that she must pass through the apartment
where the phantom of her terror had ap∣peared,
this terror increased, and, too faint
to support herself, she sat down on the side
of the bed.</P>
<P>Dorothée, believing that she was only af∣fected
by a consideration of the melancholy
catastrophe, which had happened on this
spot, endeavoured to cheer her; and then,
as they sat together on the bed, she began
to relate other particulars concerning it,
and this without reflecting, that it might
increase Emily's emotion, but because they
were particularly interesting to herself. "A
little before my lady's death," said she,
"when the pains were gone off, she called
me to her, and, stretching out her hand to
me, I sat down just there—where the cur∣tain
falls upon the bed. How well I re∣member
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
her look at the time—death was in
it!—I can almost fancy I see her now.—There
she lay, ma'amselle—her face was
upon the pillow there! This black coun∣terpane
was not upon the bed then; it was
laid on, after her death, and she was laid
out upon it."</P>
<P>Emily turned to look within the dusky
curtains, as if she could have seen the coun∣tenance
of which Dorothée spoke. The
edge of the white pillow only appeared
above the blackness of the pall, but, as her
eyes wandered over the pall itself, she fan∣cied
she saw it move. Without speaking,
she caught Dorothée's arm, who, surprised
by the action, and by the look of terror that
accompanied it, turned her eyes from Emily
to the bed, where, in the next moment she,
too, saw the pall slowly lifted, and fall
again.</P>
<P>Emily attempted to go, but Dorothée
stood fixed and gazing upon the bed; and,
at length, said—"It is only the wind, that
waves it, ma'amselle; we have left all the
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
doors open: see how the air waves the
lamp, too.—It is only the wind."</P>
<P>She had scarcely uttered these words,
when the pall was more violently agitated
than before; but Emily, somewhat ashamed
of her terrors, stepped back to the bed,
willing to be convinced that the wind only
had occasioned her alarm; when, as she
gazed within the curtains, the pall moved
again, and, in the next moment, the appa∣rition
of a human countenance rose above
it.</P>
<P>Screaming with terror, they both fled,
and got out of the chamber as fast as their
trembling limbs would bear them, leaving
open the doors of all the rooms, through
which they passed. When they reached
the stair-case, Dorothée threw open a cham∣ber-door,
where some of the female servants
slept, and sunk breathless on the bed;
while Emily, deprived of all presence of
mind, made only a feeble attempt to con∣ceal
the occasion of her terror from the
astonished servants; and, though Dorothée,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
when she could speak, endeavoured to laugh
at her own fright, and was joined by Emily,
no remonstrances could prevail with the
servants, who had quickly taken the alarm,
to pass even the remainder of the night in a
room so near to these terrific chambers.</P>
<P>Dorothée having accompanied Emily to
her own apartment, they then began to talk
over, with some degree of coolness, the
strange circumstance, that had just occurred;
and Emily would almost have doubted her
own perceptions, had not those of Doro∣thée
attested their truth. Having now men∣tioned
what she had observed in the outer
chamber, she asked the housekeeper, whe∣ther
she was certain no door had been left
unfastened, by which a person might se∣cretly
have entered the apartments? Doro∣thée
replied, that she had constantly kept
the keys of the several doors in her own
possession; that, when she had gone her
rounds through the castle, as she frequently
did, to examine if all was safe, she had
tried these doors among the rest, and had
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
always found them fastened. It was, there∣fore,
impossible, she added, that any person
could have got admittance into the apart∣ments;
and, if they could—it was very im∣probable
they should have chose to sleep in
a place so cold and forlorn.</P>
<P>Emily observed, that their visit to these
chambers had, perhaps, been watched, and
that some person, for a frolic, had followed
them into the rooms, with a design to
frighten them, and, while they were in the
oriel, had taken the opportunity of conceal∣ing
himself in the bed.</P>
<P>Dorothée allowed, that this was possible,
till she recollected, that, on entering the
apartments, she had turned the key of the
outer door, and this, which had been done
to prevent their visit being noticed by any
of the family, who might happen to be up,
must effectually have excluded every per∣son,
except themselves, from the chambers;
and she now persisted in affirming, that the
ghastly countenance she had seen was no∣thing
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
human, but some dreadful appa∣rition.</P>
<P>Emily was very solemnly affected. Of
whatever nature might be the appearance
she had witnessed, whether human or super∣natural,
the fate of the deceased Marchioness
was a truth not to be doubted; and this un∣accountable
circumstance, occurring in the
very scene of her sufferings, affected Emily's
imagination with a superstitious awe, to
which, after having detected the fallacies at
Udolpho, she might not have yielded, had
she been ignorant of the unhappy story, re∣lated
by the housekeeper. Her she now so∣lemnly
conjured to conceal the occurrence
of this night, and to make light of the ter∣ror
she had already betrayed, that the Count
might not be distressed by reports, which
would certainly spread alarm and confusion
among his family. "Time," she added,
"may explain this mysterious affair; mean∣while
let us watch the event in silence."</P>
<P>Dorothée readily acquiesced; but she
now recollected that she had left all the
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
doors of the north suite of rooms open, and,
not having courage to return alone to lock
even the outer one, Emily, after some ef∣fort,
so far conquered her own fears, that
she offered to accompany her to the foot of
the back stair-case, and to wait there while
Dorothée ascended, whose resolution being
re-assured by this circumstance, she con∣sented
to go, and they left Emily's apart∣ment
together.</P>
<P>No sound disturbed the stillness, as they
passed along the halls and galleries; but,
on reaching the foot of the back stair-case,
Dorothée's resolution failed again; having,
however, paused a moment to listen, and no
sound being heard above, she ascended,
leaving Emily below, and, scarcely suffer∣ing
her eye to glance within the first cham∣ber,
she fastened the door, which shut up
the whole suite of apartments, and returned
to Emily.</P>
<P>As they stepped along the passage, lead∣ing
into the great hall, a sound of lamenta∣tion
was heard, which seemed to come from
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
the hall itself, and they stopped in new
alarm to listen, when Emily presently dis∣tinguished
the voice of Annette, whom she
found crossing the hall, with another female
servant, and so terrified by the report, which
the other maids had spread, that, believing
she could be safe only where her lady was,
she was going for refuge to her apartment.
Emily's endeavours to laugh, or to argue
her out of these terrors, were equally vain,
and, in compassion to her distress, she con∣sented
that she should remain in her room
during the night.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Hail, mildly-pleasing Solitude!</L>
<L>Companion of the wise and good—</L>
<L>Thine is the balmy breath of morn,</L>
<L>Just as the dew-bent rose is born.</L>
<L>But chief when evening scenes decay</L>
<L>And the faint landscape swims away,</L>
<L>Thine is the doubtful, soft decline,</L>
<L>And that best hour of musing thine.</L></Q>
<BIBL>THOMPSON.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY's injunctions to Annette to be silent
on the subject of her terror were ineffectual,
and the occurrence of the preceding night
spread such alarm among the servants, who
now all affirmed, that they had frequently
heard unaccountable noises in the chateau,
that a report soon reached the Count of the
north side of the castle being haunted. He
treated this, at first, with ridicule, but, per∣ceiving,
that it was productive of serious
evil, in the confusion it occasioned among
his household, he forbade any person to re∣peat
it, on pain of punishment.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75"/>
The arrival of a party of his friends soon
withdrew his thoughts entirely from this
subject, and his servants had now little lei∣sure
to brood over it, except, indeed, in the
evenings after supper, when they all assembled
in their hall, and related stories of ghosts,
till they feared to took round the room;
started, if the echo of a closing door mur∣mured
along the passage, and refused to go
singly to any part of the castle.</P>
<P>On these occasions Annette made a distin∣guished
figure. When she told not only of
all the wonders she had witnessed, but of all
that she had imagined, in the castle of Udol∣pho,
with the story of the strange disappear∣ance
of Signora Laurentini, she made no tri∣fling
impression on the mind of her attentive
auditors. Her suspicions, concerning Mon∣toni,
she would also have freely disclosed,
had not Ludovico, who was now in the ser∣vice
of the Count, prudently checked her
loquacity, whenever it pointed to that sub∣ject.</P>
<P>Among the visitors at the chateau was
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
the Baron de Saint Foix, an old friend of
the Count, and his son, the Chevalier St.
Foix, a sensible and amiable young man,
who, having in the preceding year seen the
Lady Blanche, at Paris, had become her de∣clared
admirer. The friendship, which the
Count had long entertained for his father,
and the equality of their circumstances made
him secretly approve of the connection; but,
thinking his daughter at this time too young
to fix her choice for life, and wishing to prove
the sincerity and strength of the Chevalier's
attachment, he then rejected his suit, though
without forbidding his future hope. This
young man now came, with the Baron, his
father, to claim the reward of a steady affec∣tion,
a claim, which the Count admitted and
which Blanche did not reject.</P>
<P>While these visitors were at the chateau, it
became a scene of gaiety and splendour. The
pavilion in the woods was fitted up and fre∣quented,
in the fine evenings, as a supper∣room,
when the hour usually concluded with
a concert, at which the Count and Countess,
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
who were scientific performers, and the Che∣valiers
Henri and St. Foix, with the Lady
Blanche and Emily, whose voices and fine
taste compensated for the want of more skil∣ful
execution, usually assisted. Several of the
Count's servants performed on horns and
other instruments, some of which, placed at
a little distance among the woods, spoke, in
sweet response, to the harmony, that pro∣ceeded
from the pavilion.</P>
<P>At any other period, these parties would
have been delightful to Emily; but her spi∣rits
were now oppressed with a melancholy,
which she perceived that no kind of what is
called amusement had power to dissipate,
and which the tender and, frequently, pa∣thetic,
melody of these concerts sometimes
increased to a very painful degree.</P>
<P>She was particularly fond of walking in
the woods, that hung on a promontory,
overlooking the sea. Their luxuriant shade
was soothing to her pensive mind, and, in
the partial views, which they afforded of the
Mediterranean, with its winding shores and
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
passing sails, tranquil beauty was united
with grandeur. The paths were rude and
frequently overgrown with vegetation, but
their tasteful owner would suffer little to be
done to them, and scarcely a single branch
to be lopped from the venerable trees. On
an eminence, in one of the most sequestered
parts of these woods, was a rustic seat,
formed of the trunk of a decayed oak, which
had once been a noble tree, and of which
many lofty branches still flourishing united
with beech and pines to over-canopy the
spot. Beneath their deep umbrage, the eye
passed over the tops of other woods, to the
Mediterranean, and, to the left, through an
opening, was seen a ruined watch-tower,
standing on a point of rock, near the sea,
and rising from among the tufted foliage.</P>
<P>Hither Emily often came alone in the
silence of evening, and, soothed by the
scenery and by the faint murmur, that rose
from the waves, would sit, till darkness
obliged her to return to the chateau. Fre∣quently,
also, she visited the watch-tower,
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
which commanded the entire prospect, and,
when she leaned against its broken walls,
and thought of Valancourt, she not once
imagined, what was so true, that this tower
had been almost as frequently his resort, as
her own, since his estrangement from the
neighbouring chateau.</P>
<P>One evening, she lingered here to a late
hour. She had sat on the steps of the build∣ing,
watching, in tranquil melancholy, the
gradual effect of evening over the exten∣sive
prospect, till the gray waters of the
Mediterranean and the massy woods were
almost the only features of the scene, that re∣mained
visible; when, as she gazed alter∣nately
on these, and on the mild blue of the
heavens, where the first pale star of evening
appeared, she personified the hour in the
following lines:—</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONG OF THE EVENING HOUR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Last of the Hours, that track the fading Day,</L>
<L>I move along the realms of twilight air,</L>
<L>And hear, remote, the choral song decay</L>
<L>Of sister-nymphs, who dance around his car.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
<L>Then, as I follow through the azure void,</L>
<L>His partial splendour from my straining eye</L>
<L>Sinks in the depths of space; my only guide</L>
<L>His faint ray dawning on the farthest sky;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Save that sweet, lingering strain of gayer Hours!</L>
<L>Whose close my voice prolongs in dying notes,</L>
<L>While mortals on the green earth own its pow'rs,</L>
<L>As downward on the evening gale it floats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When fades along the West the Sun's last beam</L>
<L>As, weary, to the nether world he goes,</L>
<L>And mountain-summits catch the purple gleam,</L>
<L>And slumbering ocean faint and fainter glows,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Silent upon the globe's broad shade I steal,</L>
<L>And o'er its dry turf shed the cooling dews,</L>
<L>And ev'ry fever'd herb and flow'ret heal,</L>
<L>And all their fragrance on the air diffuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where'er I move, a tranquil pleasure reigns;</L>
<L>O'er all the scene the dusky tints I send,</L>
<L>That forests wild and mountains, stretching plains</L>
<L>And peopled towns, in soft confusion blend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wide o'er the world I waft the fresh'ning wind,</L>
<L>Low breathing through the woods and twilight vale,</L>
<L>In whispers soft, that woo the pensive mind</L>
<L>Of him, who loves my lonely steps to hail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His tender oaten reed I watch to hear,</L>
<L>Stealing its sweetness o'er some plaining rill,</L>
<L>Or soothing ocean's wave, when storms are near,</L>
<L>Or swelling in the breeze from distant hill!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
<L>I wake the fairy elves, who shun the light;</L>
<L>When, from their blossom'd beds, they slily peep,</L>
<L>And spy my pale star, leading on the night,—</L>
<L>Forth to their games and revelry they leap;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Send all the prison'd sweets abroad in air,</L>
<L>That with them slumber'd in the flow'ret's cell;</L>
<L>Then to the shores and moon-light brooks repair,</L>
<L>Till the high larks their matin-carol swell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wood nymphs hail my airs and temper'd shade,</L>
<L>With ditties soft and lightly sportive dance,</L>
<L>On river margin of some bow'ry glade,</L>
<L>And strew their fresh buds as my steps advance:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, swift I pass, and distant regions trace,</L>
<L>For moon-beams silver all the eastern cloud,</L>
<L>And Day's last crimson vestige fades apace;</L>
<L>Down the steep west I fly from Midnight's shroud.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>The moon was now rising out of the
sea. She watched its gradual progress, the
extending line of radiance it threw upon
the waters, the sparkling oars, the sail faint∣ly
silvered, and the wood-tops and the bat∣tlements
of the watch-tower, at whose foot
she was sitting, just tinted with the rays.
Emily's spirits were in harmony with this
scene. As she sat meditating, sounds stole
by her on the air, which she immediately
knew to be the music and the voice she
had formerly heard at midnight, and the
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
emotion of awe, which she felt, was not
unmixed with terror, when she considered
her remote and lonely situation. The
sounds drew nearer. She would have risen
to leave the place, but they seemed to come
from the way she must have taken towards
the chateau, and she awaited the event in
trembling expectation. The sounds con∣tinued
to approach, for some time, and
then ceased. Emily sat listening, gazing
and unable to move, when she saw a figure
emerge from the shade of the woods and
pass along the bank, at some little distance
before her. It went swiftly, and her spirits
were so overcome with awe, that, though
she saw, she did not much observe it.</P>
<P>Having left the spot, with a resolution
never again to visit it alone, at so late an
hour, she began to approach the chateau,
when she heard voices calling her from the
part of the wood, which was nearest to it.
They were the shouts of the Count's ser∣vants,
who were sent to search for her; and
when she entered the supper-room, where
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
he sat with Henri and Blanche, he gently
reproached her with a look, which she
blushed to have deserved.</P>
<P>This little occurrence deeply impressed
her mind, and, when she withdrew to her
own room, it recalled so forcibly the cir∣cumstances
she had witnessed, a few nights
before, that she had scarcely courage to re∣main
alone. She watched to a late hour,
when, no sound having renewed her fears,
she, at length, sunk to repose. But this
was of short continuance, for she was dis∣turbed
by a loud and unusual noise, that
seemed to come from the gallery, into
which her chamber opened. Groans were
distinctly heard, and, immediately after, a
dead weight fell against her door, with a
violence, that threatened to burst it open.
She called loudly to know who was there,
but received no answer, though, at inter∣vals,
she still thought she heard something
like a low moaning. Fear deprived her of
the power to move. Soon after, she heard
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
footsteps in a remote part of the gallery,
and, as they approached, she called more
loudly than before, till the steps paused at
her door. She then distinguished the voices
of several of the servants, who seemed too
much engaged by some circumstance with∣out,
to attend to her calls; but, Annette
soon after entering the room for water,
Emily understood, that one of the maids
had fainted, whom she immediately desired
them to bring into her room, where she as∣sisted
to restore her. When this girl had
recovered her speech, she affirmed, that, as
she was passing up the back stair-case, in
the way to her chamber, she had seen an
apparition on the second landing-place;
she held the lamp low, she said, that she
might pick her way, several of the stairs
being infirm and even decayed, and it was
upon raising her eyes, that she saw this ap∣pearance.
It stood for a moment in the
corner of the landing-place, which she was
approaching, and then, gliding up the
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
stairs, vanished at the door of the apart∣ment,
that had been lately opened. She
heard afterwards a hollow sound.</P>
<P>"Then the devil has got a key to that
apartment," said Dorothée, "for it could
be nobody but he; I locked the door my∣self!"</P>
<P>The girl, springing down the stairs and
passing up the great stair-case, had run,
with a faint scream, till she reached the gal∣lery,
where she fell, groaning, at Emily's
door.</P>
<P>Gently chiding her for the alarm she had
occasioned, Emily tried to make her asham∣ed
of her fears; but the girl persisted in say∣ing,
that she had seen an apparition, till she
went to her own room, whither she was ac∣companied
by all the servants present, ex∣cept
Dorothée, who, at Emily's request, re∣mained
with her during the night. Emily
was perplexed, and Dorothée was terrified,
and mentioned many occurrences of former
times, which had long since confirmed her
superstitions; among these, according to
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
her belief, she had once witnessed an appear∣ance,
like that just described, and on the very
same spot, and it was the remembrance of it,
that had made her pause, when she was go∣ing
to ascend the stairs with Emily, and
which had increased her reluctance to open
the north apartments. Whatever might be
Emily's opinions, she did not disclose them,
but listened attentively to all that Dorothée
communicated, which occasioned her much
thought and perplexity.</P>
<P>From this night the terror of the ser∣vants
increased to such an excess, that se∣veral
of them determined to leave the cha∣teau,
and requested their discharge of the
Count, who, if he had any faith in the sub∣ject
of their alarm, thought proper to dis∣semble
it, and, anxious to avoid the incon∣venience
that threatened him, employed ri∣dicule
and then argument to convince them
they had nothing to apprehend from super∣natural
agency. But fear had rendered
their minds inaccessible to reason; and it
was now, that Ludovico proved at once
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
his courage and his gratitude for the kind∣ness
he had received from the Count, by
offering to watch, during a night, in the
suite of rooms, reputed to be haunted.
He feared, he said, no spirits, and, if any
thing of human form appeared—he would
prove that he dreaded that as little.</P>
<P>The Count paused upon the offer, while
the servants, who heard it, looked upon one
another in doubt and amazement, and An∣nette,
terrified for the safety of Ludovico,
employed tears and entreaties to dissuade
him from his purpose.</P>
<P>"You are a bold fellow," said the
Count, smiling, "Think well of what you
are going to encounter, before you finally
determine upon it. However, if you per∣severe
in your resolution, I will accept your
offer, and your intrepidity shall not go un∣rewarded."</P>
<P>"I desire no reward, your <HI>Excellenza,</HI>"
replied Ludovico, "but your approbation.
Your <HI>Excellenza</HI> has been sufficiently good
to me already; but I wish to have arms,
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
that I may be equal to my enemy, if he
should appear."</P>
<P>"Your sword cannot defend you against
a ghost," replied the Count, throwing a
glance of irony upon the other servants,
"neither can bars, or bolts; for a spirit,
you know, can glide through a key-hole, as
easily as through a door."</P>
<P>"Give me a sword, my lord Count,"
said Ludovico, "and I will lay all the
spirits, that shall attack me, in the red
sea."</P>
<P>"Well," said the Count, "you shall
have a sword, and good cheer, too; and
your brave comrades here will, perhaps,
have courage enough to remain another
night in the chateau, since your boldness
will certainly, for this night, at least, con∣fine
all the malice of the spectre to your∣self."</P>
<P>Curiosity now struggled with fear in the
minds of several of his fellow servants, and,
at length, they resolved to await the event
of Ludovico's rashness.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89"/>
Emily was surprised and concerned, when
she heard of his intention, and was frequent∣ly
inclined to mention what she had wit∣nessed
in the north apartments to the Count,
for she could not entirely divest herself of
fears for Ludovico's safety, though her
reason represented these to be absurd. The
necessity, however, of concealing the secret,
with which Dorothée had entrusted her,
and which must have been mentioned, with
the late occurrence, in excuse for her hav∣ing
so privately visited the north apart∣ments,
kept her entirely silent on the sub∣ject
of her apprehension; and she tried on∣ly
to sooth Annette, who held, that Ludo∣vico
was certainly to be destroyed; and who
was much less affected by Emily's conso∣latory
efforts, than by the manner of old
Dorothée, who often, as she exclaimed Lu∣dovico,
sighed, and threw up her eyes to
heaven.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Ye gods of quiet, and of sleep profound!</L>
<L>Whose soft dominion o'er this castle sways,</L>
<L>And all the widely-silent places round,</L>
<L>Forgive me, if my t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>embling pen displays</L>
<L>What never yet was sung in mortal lays.</L></Q>
<BIBL>THOMPSON.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Count gave orders for the north
apartments to be opened and prepared for
the reception of Ludovico; but Dorothée,
remembering what she had lately witnessed
there, feared to obey, and, not one of the
other servants daring to venture thither, the
rooms remained shut up till the time when
Ludovico was to retire thither for the night,
an hour, for which the whole household
waited with impatience.</P>
<P>After supper, Ludovico, by the order of
the Count, attended him in his closet, where
they remained alone for near half an hour,
and, on leaving which, his Lord delivered
to him a sword.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91"/>
"It has seen service in mortal quarrels,"
said the Count, jocosely, "you will use it
honourably, no doubt, in a spiritual one.
To-morrow, let me hear that there is not
one ghost remaining in the chateau."</P>
<P>Ludovico received it with a respectful
bow. "You shall be obeyed, my Lord,"
said he; "I will engage, that no spectre
shall disturb the peace of the chateau after
this night."</P>
<P>They now returned to the supper-room,
where the Count's guests awaited to accom∣pany
him and Ludovico to the door of the
north apartments, and Dorothée, being sum∣moned
for the keys, delivered them to Lu∣dovico,
who then led the way, followed by
most of the inhabitants of the chateau.
Having reached the back stair-case, several
of the servants shrunk back, and refused to
go further, but the rest followed him to the
top of the stair-case, where a broad landing∣place
allowed them to flock round him,
while he applied the key to the door,
during which they watched him with as
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
much eager curiosity as if he had been per∣forming
some magical rite.</P>
<P>Ludovico, unaccustomed to the lock,
could not turn it, and Dorothée, who had
lingered far behind, was called forward,
under whose hand the door opened slowly,
and, her eye glancing within the dusky
chamber, she uttered a sudden shriek, and
retreated. At this signal of alarm, the
greater part of the crowd hurried down the
stairs, and the Count, Henri and Ludovico
were left alone to pursue the enquiry, who
instantly rushed into the apartment, Ludo∣vico
with a drawn sword, which he had just
time to draw from the scabbard, the Count
with the lamp in his hand, and Henri car∣rying
a basket, containing provision for the
courageous adventurer.</P>
<P>Having looked hastily round the first
room, where nothing appeared to justify
alarm, they passed on to the second; and,
here too all being quiet, they proceeded to
a third in a more tempered step. The
Count had now leisure to smile at the dis∣composure,
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
into which he had been sur∣prised,
and to ask Ludovico in which room
he designed to pass the night.</P>
<P>"There are several chambers beyond
these, your <HI>Excellenza,</HI>" said Ludovico,
pointing to a door, "and in one of them is
a bed, they say. I will pass the night there,
and when I am weary of watching, I can
lie down."</P>
<P>"Good;" said the Count, "let us go on.
You see these rooms shew nothing, but damp
walls and decaying furniture. I have been
so much engaged since I came to the cha∣teau,
that I have not looked into them till
now. Remember, Ludovico, to tell the
housekeeper, to-morrow, to throw open
these windows. The damask hangings are
dropping to pieces, I will have them taken
down, and this antique furniture removed."</P>
<P>"Dear sir!" said Henri, "here is an
arm-chair so massy with gilding, that it re∣sembles
one of the state chairs at the Lou∣vre,
more than any thing else."</P>
<P>"Yes," said the Count, stopping a mo∣ment
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
to survey it, "there is a history be∣longing
to that chair, but I have not time
to tell it.—Let us pass on. This suite runs
to a greater extent than I had imagined; it
is many years since I was in them. But
where is the bed-room you speak of, Ludo∣vico?—these
are only anti-chambers to the
great drawing-room. I remember them in
their splendour!"</P>
<P>"The bed, my Lord," replied Ludovico,
"they told me, was in a room that opens be∣yond
the saloon, and terminates the suite."</P>
<P>"O, here is the saloon," said the Count,
as they entered the spacious apartment, in
which Emily and Dorothée had rested. He
here stood for a moment, surveying the re∣liques
of faded grandeur, which it exhi∣bited—the
sumptuous tapestry—the long
and low sophas of velvet, with frames hea∣vily
carved and gilded—the floor inlaid
with small squares of fine marble, and co∣vered
in the centre with a piece of very
rich tapestry-work—the casements of paint∣ed
glass; and the large Venetian mirrors, of
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
a size and quality, such as at that period
France could not make, which reflected, on
every side, the spacious apartment. These
had formerly also reflected a gay and bril∣liant
scene, for this had been the state-room
of the chateau, and here the Marchioness
had held the assemblies, that made part of the
festivities of her nuptials. If the wand of
a magician could have recalled the vanished
groups, many of them vanished even from
the earth! that once had passed over these
polished mirrors, what a varied and con∣trasted
picture would they have exhibited
with the present! Now, instead of a blaze
of lights, and a splendid and busy crowd,
they reflected only the rays of the one glim∣mering
lamp, which the Count held up,
and which scarcely served to shew the three
forlorn figures, that stood surveying the
room, and the spacious and dusky walls
around them.</P>
<P>"Ah!" said the Count to Henri, awak∣ing
from his deep reverie, "how the scene
is changed since last I saw it! I was a
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
young man, then, and the Marchioness was
alive and in her bloom; many other per∣sons
were here, too, who are now no more!
There stood the orchestra; here we tripped
in many a sprightly maze—the walls echo∣ing
to the dance! Now, they resound only
one feeble voice—and even that will, ere
long, be heard no more! My son, remem∣ber,
that I was once as young as yourself,
and that you must pass away like those, who
have preceded you—like those, who, as they
sung and danced in this once gay apart∣ment,
forgot, that years are made up of
moments, and that every step they took
carried them nearer to their graves. But
such reflections are useless, I had almost said
criminal, unless they teach us to prepare for
eternity, since, otherwise, they cloud our
present happiness, without guiding us to a
future one. But enough of this; let us go
on."</P>
<P>Ludovico now opened the door of the
bed-room, and the Count, as he entered,
was struck with the funereal appearance,
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
which the dark arras gave to it. He ap∣proached
the bed, with an emotion of so∣lemnity,
and, perceiving it to be covered
with the pall of black velvet, paused;
"What can this mean?" said he, as he
gazed upon it.</P>
<P>"I have heard, my Lord," said Ludovico,
as he stood at the feet, looking within the
canopied curtains, "that the Lady Mar∣chioness
de Villeroi died in this chamber,
and remained here till she was removed to
be buried; and this, perhaps, Signor, may
account for the pall."</P>
<P>The Count made no reply, but stood for
a few moments engaged in thought, and
evidently much affected. Then, turning
to Ludovico, he asked him with a seri∣ous
air, whether he thought his courage
would support him through the night? "If
you doubt this," added the Count, "do not
be ashamed to own it; I will release you
from your engagement, without exposing
you to the triumphs of your fellow ser∣vants."</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98"/>
Ludovico paused; pride, and something
very like fear, seemed struggling in his
breast; pride, however, was victorious;—he
blushed, and his hesitation ceased.</P>
<P>"No, my Lord," said he, "I will go
through with what I have begun; and I am
grateful for your consideration. On that
hearth I will make a fire, and, with the
good cheer in this basket, I doubt not I
shall do well."</P>
<P>"Be it so," said the Count; "but how
will you beguile the tediousness of the
night, if you do not sleep?"</P>
<P>"When I am weary, my Lord," replied
Ludovico, "I shall not fear to sleep; in
the meanwhile I have a book, that will en∣tertain
me."</P>
<P>"Well," said the Count, "I hope no∣thing
will disturb you; but if you should be
seriously alarmed in the night, come to my
apartment. I have too much confidence in
your good sense and courage, to believe you
will be alarmed on slight grounds; or suffer
the gloom of this chamber, or its remote
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
situation, to overcome you with ideal ter∣rors.
To-morrow, I shall have to thank
you for an important service; these rooms
shall then be thrown open, and my people
will be convinced of their error. Good
night, Ludovico; let me see you early in
the morning, and, remember what I lately
said to you."</P>
<P>"I will, my Lord; good night to your
<HI>Excellenza;</HI> let me attend you with the
light."</P>
<P>He lighted the Count and Henri through
the chambers to the outer door; on the land∣ing-place
stood a lamp, which one of the
affrighted servants had left, and Henri, as
he took it up, again bade Ludovico good
night, who, having respectfully returned
the wish, closed the door upon them, and
fastened it. Then, as he retired to the
bed-chamber, he examined the rooms,
through which he passed, with more mi∣nuteness
than he had done before, for he
apprehended, that some person might have
concealed himself in them, for the purpose
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
of frightening him. No one, however,
but himself, was in these chambers, and,
leaving open the doors, through which he
passed, he came again to the great drawing∣room,
whose spaciousness and silent gloom
somewhat awed him. For a moment he
stood, looking back through the long suite
of rooms he had quitted, and, as he turned,
perceiving a light and his own figure, re∣flected
in one of the large mirrors, he start∣ed.
Other objects too were seen obscurely
on its dark surface, but he paused not to
examine them, and returned hastily into
the bed-room, as he surveyed which, he
observed the door of the oriel, and opened
it. All within was still. On looking
round, his eye was arrested by the por∣trait
of the deceased Marchioness, upon
which he gazed, for a considerable time,
with great attention and some surprise;
and then, having examined the closet, he
returned into the bed-room, where he kin∣dled
a wood fire, the bright blaze of which
revised his spirits, which had begun to yield
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
to the gloom and silence of the place, for gusts
of wind alone broke at intervals this silence.
He now drew a small table and a chair near
the fire, took a bottle of wine, and some
cold provision out of his basket, and regaled
himself. When he had finished his repast,
he laid his sword upon the table, and, not
feeling disposed to sleep, drew from his poc∣ket
the book he had spoken of.—It was a
volume of old Provençal tales. Having
stirred the fire into a brighter blaze, trim∣med
his lamp, and drawn his chair upon
the hearth, he began to read, and his atten∣tion
was soon wholly occupied by the
scenes, which the page disclosed.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, had returned to
the supper-room, whither those of the party,
who had attended him to the north apart∣ment,
had retreated, upon hearing Doro∣thée's
scream, and who were now earnest in
their enquiries concerning those chambers.
The Count rallied his guests on their pre∣cipitate
retreat, and on the superstitious in∣clination
which had occasioned it, and his
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
led to the question, Whether the spirit, af∣ter
it has quitted the body, is ever permit∣ted
to revisit the earth; and if it is, whether
it was possible for spirits to become visible
to the sense. The Baron was of opinion,
that the first was probable, and the last was
possible, and he endeavoured to justify this
opinion by respectable authorities, both an∣cient
and modern, which he quoted. The
Count, however, was decidedly against him,
and a long conversation ensued, in which the
usual arguments on these subjects were on
both sides brought forward with skill, and
discussed with candour, but without convert∣ing
either party to the opinion of his oppo∣nent.
The effect of their conversation on
their auditors was various. Though the
Count had much the superiority of the Baron
in point of argument, he had considerably
fewer adherents; for that love, so natural to
the human mind, of whatever is able to dis∣tend
its faculties with wonder and astonish∣ment,
attached the majority of the company
to the side of the Baron; and, though many
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
of the Count's propositions were unanswer∣able,
his opponents were inclined to believe
this the consequence of their own want of
knowledge, on so abstracted a subject, rather
than that arguments did not exist, which
were forcible enough to conquer his.</P>
<P>Blanche was pale with attention, till the
ridicule in her father's glance called a blush
upon her countenance, and she then endea∣voured
to forget the superstitious tales she
had been told in her convent. Meanwhile,
Emily had been listening with deep atten∣tion
to the discussion of what was to her a
very interesting question, and, remembering
the appearance she had witnessed in the
apartment of the late Marchioness, she was
frequently chilled with awe. Several times
she was on the point of mentioning what she
had seen, but the fear of giving pain to the
Count, and the dread of his ridicule, re∣strained
her; and, awaiting in anxious expec∣tation
the event of Ludovico's intrepidity,
she determined that her future silence should
depend upon it.</P>
<P>When the party had separated for the
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
night, and the Count retired to his dressing∣room,
the remembrance of the desolate
scenes he had lately witnessed in his own
mansion deeply affected him, but at length
he was aroused from his reverie and his
silence. "What music is that I hear?"—said
he suddenly to his valet, "Who plays
at this late hour?"</P>
<P>The man made no reply, and the Count
continued to listen, and then added, "That
is no common musician; he touches the in∣strument
with a delicate hand; who is it,
Pierre?"</P>
<P>"My Lord!" said the man, hesitatingly.</P>
<P>"Who plays that instrument?" repeated
the Count.</P>
<P>"Does not your lordship know, then?"
said the valet.</P>
<P>"What mean you?" said the Count,
somewhat sternly.</P>
<P>"Nothing, my Lord, I meant nothing,"
rejoined the man submissively—"Only—that
music—goes about the house at mid∣night
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
often, and I thought your lordship
might have heard it before."</P>
<P>"Music goes about the house at mid∣night!
Poor fellow!—does nobody dance
to the music, too?"</P>
<P>"It is not in the chateau, I believe, my
Lord; the sounds come from the woods,
they say, though they seem so near;—but
then a spirit can do any thing!"</P>
<P>"Ah, poor fellow!" said the Count, "I
perceive you are as silly as the rest of them;
to-morrow, you will be convinced of your
ridiculous error. But hark!—what voice
is that?"</P>
<P>"O my Lord! that is the voice we of∣ten
hear with the music."</P>
<P>"Often!" said the Count, "How often,
pray? It is a very fine one."</P>
<P>"Why, my Lord, I myself have not
heard it more than two or three times, but
there are those who have lived here longer,
that have heard it often enoush."</P>
<P>"What a swell was that!" exclaimed
the Count, as he still listened, "And now,
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
what a dying cadence! This is surely some∣thing
more than mortal!"</P>
<P>"That is what they say, my Lord," said
the valet; "they say it is nothing mortal,
that utters it; and if I might say my
thoughts"—</P>
<P>"Peace!" said the Count, and he listened
till the strain died away.</P>
<P>"This is strange!" said he, as he turned
from the window, "Close the casements,
Pierre."</P>
<P>Pierre obeyed, and the Count soon after
dismissed him, but did not so soon lose the
remembrance of the music, which long vi∣brated
in his fancy in tones of melting sweet∣ness,
while surprise and perplexity engaged
his thoughts.</P>
<P>Ludovico, meanwhile, in his remote
chamber, heard, now and then, the faint
echo of a closing door, as the family retired
to rest, and then the hall clock, at a great
distance, strike twelve. "It is midnight,"
said he, and he looked suspiciously round
the spacious chamber. The fire on the
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
hearth was now nearly expiring, for his at∣tention
having been engaged by the book
before him, he had forgotten every thing
besides; but he soon added fresh wood,
not because he was cold, though the night
was stormy, but because he was cheerless;
and, having again trimmed his lamp, he
poured out a glass of wine, drew his chair
nearer to the crackling blaze, tried to be deaf
to the wind, that howled mournfully at the
casements, endeavoured to abstract his mind
from the melancholy, that was stealing upon
him, and again took up his book. It had
been lent to him by Dorothée, who had for∣merly
picked it up in anobscure corner of the
Marquis's library, and who, having opened
it and perceived some of the marvels it re∣lated,
had carefully preserved it for her
own entertainment, its condition giving her
some excuse for detaining it from its proper
station. The damp corner into which it had
fallen, had caused the cover to be disfigured
and mouldy, and the leaves to be so dis∣coloured
with spots, that it was not without
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
difficulty the letters could be traced. The
fictions of the Provençal writers, whether
drawn from the Arabian legends, brought
by the Saracens into Spain, or recounting
the chivalric exploits performed by the
crusaders, whom the Troubadours accom∣panied
to the east, were generally splendid
and always marvellous, both in scenery and
incident; and it is not wonderful, that Do∣rothée
and Ludovico should be fascinated by
inventions, which had captivated the careless
imagination in every rank of society, in a
former age. Some of the tales, however, in
the book now before Ludovico, were of
simple structure, and exhibited nothing of
the magnificent machinery and heroic man∣ners,
which usually characterized the fables
of the twelfth century, and of this descrip∣tion
was the one he now happened to open,
which, in its original style, was of great
length, but which may be thus shortly re∣lated.
The reader will perceive, that it is
strongly tinctured with the superstition of
the times.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROVENÇAL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived, in the province of Bretagne,
a noble Baron, famous for his-magnificence
and courtly hospitalities. His castle was
graced with ladies of exquisite beauty, and
thronged with illustrious knights; for the
honours he paid to feats of chivalry invited
the brave of distant countries to enter his
lists, and his court was more splendid than
those of many princes. Eight minstrels were
retained in his service, who used to sing to
their harps romantic fictions, taken from
the Arabians, or adventures of chivalry, that
befel knights during the crusades, or the
martial deeds of the Baron, their lord;—while
he, surrounded by his knights and
ladies, banqueted in the great hall of his
castle, where the costly tapestry, that adorned
the walls with pictured exploits of his an∣cestors,
the casements of painted glass, en∣riched
with armorial bearings, the gorgeous
banners, that waved along the roof, the
sumptuous canopies, the profusion of gold
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
and silver, that glittered on the sideboards,
the numerous dishes, that covered the tables,
the number and gay liveries of the atten∣dants,
with the chivalric and splendid attire
of the guests, united to form a scene of
magnificence, such as we may not hope to
see in these <HI>degenerate days.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Baron, the following adventure is
related. One night, having retired late from
the banquet to his chamber, and dismissed
his attendants, he was surprised by the ap∣pearance
of a stranger of a noble air, but of
a sorrowful and dejected countenance. Be∣lieving,
that this person had been secreted
in the apartment, since it appeared impos∣sible
he could have lately passed the anti∣room,
unobserved by the pages in waiting,
who would have prevented this intrusion on
their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his
people, drew his sword, which he had not
yet taken from his side, and stood upon his
defence. The stranger slowly advancing,
told him, that there was nothing to fear;
that he came with no hostile design, but to
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
communicate to him a terrible secret, which
it was necessary for him to know.</P>
<P>The Baron, appeased by the courteous
manners of the stranger, after surveying him,
for some time, in silence, returned his sword
into the scabbard, and desired him to explain
the means, by which he had obtained access
to the chamber, and the purpose of this ex∣traordinary
visit.</P>
<P>Without answering either of these enqui∣ries,
the stranger said, that he could not then
explain himself, but that, if the Baron would
follow him to the edge of the forest, at a
short distance from the castle walls, he would
there convince him, that he had something
of importance to disclose.</P>
<P>This proposal again alarmed the Baron,
who could scarcely believe, that the stranger
meant to draw him to so solitary a spot, at
this hour of the night, without harbouring
a design against his life, and he refused to
go, observing, at the same time, that, if the
stranger's purpose was an honourable one, he
would not persist in refusing to reveal the
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
occasion of his visit, in the apartment where
they were.</P>
<P>While he spoke this, he viewed the
stranger still more attentively than before,
but observed no change in his countenance,
or any symptom, that might intimate a
consciousness of evil design. He was ha∣bited
like a knight, was of a tall and ma∣jestic
stature, and of dignified and courteous
manners. Still, however, he refused to com∣municate
the subject of his errand in any
place, but that he had mentioned, and, at
the same time, gave hints concerning the
secret he would disclose, that awakened a de∣gree
of solemn curiosity in the Baron, which,
at length, induced him to consent to follow
the stranger, on certain conditions.</P>
<P>"Sir knight," said he, "I will attend
you to the forest, and will take with me only
four of my people, who shall witness our
conference."</P>
<P>To this, however, the Knight objected.</P>
<P>"What I would disclose," said he, with
solemnity, "is to you alone. There are
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
only three living persons, to whom the cir∣cumstance
is known; it is of more conse∣quence
to you and your house, than I shall
now explain. In future years, you will look
back to this night with satisfaction or re∣pentance,
accordingly as you now determine.
As you would hereafter prosper—follow
me; I pledge you the honour of a knight,
that no evil shall befall you;—if you are
contented to dare futurity—remain in your
chamber, and I will depart as I came."</P>
<P>"Sir knight," replied the Baron, "how
is it possible, that my future peace can de∣pend
upon my present determination?"</P>
<P>"That is not now to be told," said the
stranger, "I have explained myself to the
utmost. It is late; if you follow me it must
be quickly;—you will do well to consider
the alternative."</P>
<P>The Baron mused, and, as he looked
upon the knight, he perceived his counte∣nance
assume a singular solemnity.</P>
<P>[Here Ludovico thought he heard a noise,
and he threw a glance round the chamber,
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
and then held up the lamp to assist his ob∣servation;
but, not perceiving any thing to
confirm his alarm, he took up the book
again and pursued the story.]</P>
<P>The Baron paced his apartment, for
some time, in silence, impressed by the last
words of the stranger, whose extraordinary
request he feared to grant, and feared, also,
to refuse. At length, he said, "Sir knight,
you are utterly unknown to me; tell me
yourself,—is it reasonable, that I should
trust myself alone with a stranger, at this
hour, in a solitary forest? Tell me, at least,
who you are, and who assisted to secrete you
in this chamber."</P>
<P>The knight frowned at these latter words,
and was a moment silent; then, with a coun∣tenance
somewhat stern, he said,</P>
<P>"I am an English knight; I am called
Sir Bevys of Lancaster,—and my deeds are
not unknown at the Holy City, whence
I was returning to my native land, when
I was benighted in the neighbouring forest."</P>
<P>"Your name is not unknown to fame,"
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
said the Baron, "I have heard of it."
(The Knight looked haughtily.) "But
why, since my castle is known to entertain
all true knights, did not your herald an∣nounce
you? Why did you not appear at
the banquet, where your presence would
have been welcomed, instead of hiding your∣self
in my castle and stealing to my cham∣ber,
at midnight?"</P>
<P>The stranger frowned, and turned away in
silence; but the Baron repeated the questions.</P>
<P>"I come not," said the Knight, "to an∣swer
enquiries, but to reveal facts. If you
would know more, follow me, and again I
pledge the honour of a Knight, that you
shall return in safety.—Be quick in your de∣termination—I
must be gone."</P>
<P>After some further hesitation, the Baron
determined to follow the stranger, and to
see the result of his extraordinary request;
he, therefore, again drew forth his sword,
and, taking up a lamp, bade the Knight lead
on. The latter obeyed, and, opening the
door of the chamber, they passed into the
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
anti-room, where the Baron, surprised to find
all his pages asleep, stopped, and, with hasty
violence, was going to reprimand them for
their carelessness, when the Knight waved
his hand, and looked so expressively upon
the Baron, that the latter restrained his re∣sentment,
and passed on.</P>
<P>The Knight, having descended a stair∣case,
opened a secret door, which the Baron
had believed was known only to himself,
and, proceeding through several narrow and
winding passages, came, at length, to a small
gate, that opened beyond the walls of the
castle. Meanwhile, the Baron followed in
silence and amazement, on perceiving that
these secret passages were so well known to
a stranger, and felt inclined to return from
an adventure, that appeared to partake of
treachery, as well as danger. Then, con∣sidering
that he was armed, and observ∣ing
the courteous and noble air of his con∣ductor,
his courage returned, he blushed,
that it had failed him for a moment, and he
resolved to trace the mystery to its source.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117"/>
He now found himself on the heathy
platform, before the great gates of his castle,
where, on looking up, he perceived lights
glimmering in the different casements of the
guests, who were retiring to sleep; and,
while he shivered in the blast, and looked
on the dark and desolate scene around him,
he thought of the comforts of his warm
chamber, rendered cheerful by the blaze of
wood, and felt, for a moment, the full con∣trast
of his present situation.</P>
<P>[Here Ludovico paused a moment, and,
looking at his own fire, gave it a brightening
stir.]</P>
<P>The wind was strong, and the Baron
watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting
every moment to see it extinguished; but,
though the flame wavered, it did not expire,
and he still followed the stranger, who often
sighed as he went, but did not speak.</P>
<P>When they reached the borders of the
forest, the Knight turned, and raised his head,
as if he meant to address the Baron, but then,
closing his lips in silence, he walked on.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
As they entered, beneath the dark and
spreading boughs, the Baron, affected by
the solemnity of the sccne, hesitated whe∣ther
to proceed, and demanded how much
further they were to go. The Knight replied
only by a gesture, and the Baron, with hesi∣tating
steps and a suspicious eye, followed
through an obscure and intricate path, till,
having proceeded a considerable way, he
again demanded whither they were going,
and refused to proceed unless he was in∣formed.</P>
<P>As he said this, he looked at his own
sword, and at the Knight alternately, who
shook his head, and whose dejected counte∣nance
disarmed the Baron, for a moment,
of suspicion.</P>
<P>"A little further is the place, whither I
would lead you," said the stranger; "no evil
shall befall you—I have sworn it on the ho∣nour
of a knight."</P>
<P>The Baron, re-assured, again followed in
silence, and they soon arrived at a deep re∣cess
of the forest, where the dark and lofty
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
chesnuts entirely excluded the sky, and which
was so overgrown with underwood, that they
proceeded with difficulty. The Knight sighed
deeply as he passed, and sometimes paused;
and having, at length, reached a spot, where
the trees crowded into a knot, he turned,
and, with a terrific look, pointing to the
ground, the Baron saw there the body of
a man, stretched at its length, and welter∣ing
in blood; a ghastly wound was on the
forehead, and death appeared already to have
contracted the features.</P>
<P>The Baron, on perceiving the spectacle,
started in horror, looked at the Knight for
explanation, and was then going to raise the
body and examine if there were yet any re∣mains
of life; but the stranger, waving his
hand, fixed upon him a look so earnest and
mournful, as not only much surprised him,
but made him desist.</P>
<P>But, what were the Baron's emotions,
when, an holding the lamp near the features
of the corpse, he discovered the exact resem∣blance
of the stranger his conductor, to
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
whom he now looked up in astonishment
and enquiry? As he gazed, he perceived
the countenance of the Knight change, and
begin to fade, till his whole form gradually
vanished from his astonished sense! While
the Baron stood, fixed to the spot, a voice
was heard to utter these words:—</P>
<P>[Ludovico started, and laid down the
book, for he thought he heard a voice in
the chamber, and he looked toward the bed,
where, however, he saw only the dark cur∣tains
and the pall. He listened, scarcely
daring to draw his breath, but heard only
the distant roaring of the sea in the storm,
and the blast, that rushed by the casements;
when, concluding, that he had been de∣ceived
by its sighings, he took up his book
to finish the story.]</P>
<P>While the Baron stood, fixed to the
spot, a voice was heard to utter these
words:—</P>
<P>"The body of Sir Bevys of Lancaster,
a noble knight of England, lies before you.
He was, this night, way laid and murdered,
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
as he journeyed from the Holy City towards
his native land. Respect the honour of
knighthood and the law of humanity; inter
the body in christian ground, and cause his
murderers to be punished. As ye observe,
or neglect this, shall peace and happiness,
or war and misery, light upon you and your
house for ever"</P>
<P>The Baron, when he recovered from the
awe and astonishment, into which this ad∣venture
had thrown him, returned to his
castle, whither he caused the body of Sir
Bevys to be removed; and, on the following
day, it was interred, with the honours of
knighthood, in the chapel of the castle, at∣tended
by all the noble knights and ladies,
who graced the court of the Baron de
Brunne.</P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Ludovico, having finished this story, laid
aside the book, for he felt drowsy, and, after
putting more wood on the fire and taking
another glass of wine, he reposed himself in
the arm chair on the hearth. In his dream he
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
still beheld the chamber where he really was,
and, once or twice, started from imperfect
slumbers, imagining he saw a man's face,
looking over the high back of his arm-chair.
This idea had so strongly-impressed him, that,
when he raised his eyes, he almost expected to
meet other eyes, fixed upon his own, and he
quitted his seat and looked behind the chair,
before he felt perfectly convinced, that no
person was there.</P>
<P>Thus closed the hour.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Count, who had slept little during
the night, rose early, and, anxious to speak
with Ludovico, went to the north apart∣ment;
but, the outer door having been fast∣ened,
on the preceding night, he was ob∣liged
to knock loudly for admittance.
Neither the knocking, or his voice was
heard; but, considering the distance of this
door from the bed-room, and that Ludo∣vico,
wearied with watching, had probably
fallen into a deep sleep, the Count was not
surprised on receiving no answer, and, leav∣ing
the door, he went down to walk in his
grounds.</P>
<P>It was a gray autumnal morning. The
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
sun, rising over Provence, gave only a feeble
light, as his rays struggled through the va∣pours
that ascended from the sea, and sloated
heavily over the wood-tops, which were now
varied with many a mellow tint of autumn.
The storm was passed, but the waves were
yet violently agitated, and their course was
traced by long lines of foam, while not a
breeze sluttered in the sails of the vessels,
near the shore, that were weighing anchor
to depart. The still gloom of the hour
was pleasing to the Count, and he pur∣sued
his way through the woods, sunk in
deep thought.</P>
<P>Emily also rose at an early hour, and
took her customary walk along the brow
of the promontory, that overhung the Me∣diterranean.
Her mind was now not oc∣cupied
with the occurrences of the chateau,
and Valancourt was the subject of her
mournful thoughts; whom she had not
yet taught herself to consider with indiffer∣ence,
though her judgment constantly re∣proached
her for the affection, that lingered
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
in her heart, after her esteem for him was
departed. Remembrance frequently gave
her his parting look and the tones of his
voice, when he had bade her a last farewel;
and, some accidental associations now recall∣ing
these circumstances to her fancy, with
peculiar energy, she shed bitter tears to the
recollection.</P>
<P>Having reached the watch-tower, she
seated herself on the broken steps, and, in
melancholy dejection, watched the waves,
half hid in vapour, as they came rolling to∣wards
the shore, and threw up their light
spray round the rocks below. Their hollow
murmur and the obscuring mists, that came
in wreaths up the cliffss, gave a solemnity
to the scene, which was in harmony with
the temper of her mind, and she sat, given
up to the remembrance of past times, till
this became too painful, and she abruptly
quitted the place. On passing the little
gate of the watch-tower, she observed let∣ters,
engraved on the stone postern, which
she paused to examine, and, though they
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
appeared to have been rudely cut with a
pen-knife, the characters were familiar to
her; at length, recognizing the hand-writ∣ing
of Valancourt, she read, with trembling
anxiety, the following lines, entitled</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SHIPWRECK.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis solemn midnight! On this lonely steep,</L>
<L>Beneath this watch-tow'r's desolated wall,</L>
<L>Where mystic shapes the wonderer appall,</L>
<L>I rest; and view below the desert deep,</L>
<L>As through tempestuous clouds the moon's cold light</L>
<L>Gleams on the wave. Viewless, the winds of night</L>
<L>With loud mysterious force the billows sweep,</L>
<L>And sullen roar the surges, far below.</L>
<L>In the still pauses of the gust I hear</L>
<L>The voice of spirits, rising sweet and slow,</L>
<L>And oft among the clouds their forms appear.</L>
<L>But hark! what shriek of death comes in the gale,</L>
<L>And in the distant ray what glimmering sail</L>
<L>Bends to the storm?—Now sinks the note of fear!</L>
<L>Ah! wretched mariners!—no more shall day</L>
<L>Unclose his cheering eye to light ye on your way!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>From these lines it appeared, that Va∣lancourt
had visited the tower; that he had
probably been here on the preceding night,
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
for it was such an one as they described,
and that he had left the building very late∣ly,
since it had not long been light, and
without light it was impossible these letters
could have been cut. It was thus even
probable, that he might be yet in the gar∣dens.</P>
<P>As these reflections passed rapidly over
the mind of Emily, they called up a variety
of contending emotions, that almost over∣came
her spirits; but her first impulse was
to avoid him, and, immediately leaving
the tower, she returned, with hasty steps,
towards the chateau. As she passed along,
she remembered the music she had lately
heard near the tower, with the figure, which
had appeared, and, in this moment of agi∣tation,
she was inclined to believe, that
she had then heard and seen Valancourt;
but other recollections soon convinced her
of her error. On turning into a thicker
part of the woods, she perceived a person,
walking slowly in the gloom at some little
distance, and, her mind engaged by the
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
idea of him, she started and paused, ima∣gining
this to be Valancourt. The person
advanced with quicker steps, and, before
she could recover recollection enough to
avoid him, he spoke, and she then knew the
voice of the Count, who expressed some
surprise, on finding her walking at so early
an hour, and made a feeble effort to rally
her on her love of solitude. But he soon
perceived this to be more a subject of con∣cern
than of light laughter, and, changing
his manner, affectionately expostulated with
Emily, on thus indulging unavailing regret;
who, though she acknowledged the justness
of all he said, could not restrain her tears,
while she did so, and he presently quitted
the topic. Expressing surprise at not hav∣ing
yet heard from his friend, the Advo∣cate
at Avignon, in answer to the questions
proposed to him, respecting the estates of
the late Madame Montoni, he, with friend∣ly
zeal, endeavoured to cheer Emily with
hopes of establishing her claim to them;
while she felt, that the estates could now
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
contribute little to the happiness of a life,
in which Valancourt had no longer an in∣terest.</P>
<P>When they returned to the chateau,
Emily retired to her apartment, and Count
De Villefort to the door of the north cham∣bers.
This was still fastened, but, being now
determined to arouse Ludovico, he renewed
his calls more loudly than before, after
which a total silence ensued, and the Count,
finding all his efforts to be heard ineffec∣tual,
at length began to fear, that some ac∣cident
had befallen Ludovico, whom ter∣ror
of an imaginary being might have de∣prived
of his senses. He, therefore, left
the door with an intention of summon∣ing
his servants to force it open, some of
whom he now heard moving in the lower
part of the chateau.</P>
<P>To the Count's enquiries, whether they
had seen or heard Ludovico, they replied
in affright, that not one of them had ven∣tured
on the north side of the chateau, since
the preceding night.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>
"He sleeps soundly then," said the
Count, "and is at such a distance from the
outer door, which is fastened, that to gain
admittance to the chambers it will be neces∣sary
to force it. Bring an instrument, and
follow me."</P>
<P>The servants stood mute and dejected,
and it was not till nearly all the household
were assembled, that the Count's orders
were obeyed. In the mean time Dorothée
was telling of a door, that opened from a
gallery, leading from the great stair-case
into the last anti-room of the saloon, and,
this being much nearer to the bed-cham∣ber,
it appeared probable, that Ludovico
might be easily awakened by an attempt to
open it. Thither, therefore, the Count
went, but his voice was as ineffectual at
this door as it had proved at the remoter
one; and now, seriously interested for Lu∣dovico,
he was himself going to strike upon
the door with the instrument, when he ob∣served
its singular beauty, and with-held
the blow. It appeared, on the first glance,
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
to be of ebony, so dark and close was its
grain and so high its polish; but it proved
to be only of larch wood, of the growth of
Provence, then famous for its forests of
larch. The beauty of its polished hue and
of its delicate carvings determined the
Count to spare this door, and he returned
to that leading from the back stair-case,
which being, at length, forced, he entered
the first anti-room, followed by Henri
and a few of the most courageous of his
servants, the rest awaiting the event of
the enquiry on the stairs and landing-place.</P>
<P>All was silent in the chambers, through
which the Count passed, and, having reach∣ed
the saloon, he called loudly upon Ludo∣vico;
after which, still receiving no answer,
he threw open the door of the bed-room,
and entered.</P>
<P>The profound stillness within confirmed
his apprehensions for Ludovico, for not even
the breathings of a person in sleep were
heard; and his uncertainty was not soon ter∣minated,
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
since, the shutters being all closed,
the chamber was too dark for any object to
be distinguished in it.</P>
<P>The Count bade a servant open them,
who, as he crossed the room to do so,
stumbled over something, and fell to the
floor, when his cry occasioned such panic
among the few of his fellows, who had
ventured thus far, that they instantly fled,
and the Count and Henri were left to finish
the adventure.</P>
<P>Henri then sprung across the room, and,
opening a window-shutter, they perceived,
that the man had fallen over a chair near
the hearth, in which Ludovico had been
sitting;—for he sat there no longer, nor
could any where be seen by the imperfect
light, that was admitted into the apartment.
The Count, seriously alarmed, now opened
other shutters, that he might be enabled to
examine further, and, Ludovico not yet ap∣pearing,
he stood for a moment, suspended
in astonishment and scarcely trusting his
senses, till, his eyes glancing on the bed, he
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
advanced, to examine whether he was there
asleep. No person, however, was in it,
and he proceeded to the oriel, where every
thing remained as on the preceding night,
but Ludovico was no where to be found.</P>
<P>The Count now checked his amazement,
considering, that Ludovico might have left
the chambers, during the night, overcome
by the terrors, which their lonely desolation
and the recollected reports, concerning
them, had inspired. Yet, if this had been
the fact, the man would naturally have
sought society, and his fellow servants had
all declared they had not seen him; the
door of the outer room also had been
found fastened, with the key on the inside;
it was impossible, therefore, for him to
have passed through that, and all the outer
doors of this suite were found, on examina∣tion,
to be bolted and locked, with the
keys also within them. The Count, being
then compelled to believe, that the lad had
escaped through the casements, next exa∣mined
them, but such as opened wide
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
enough to admit the body of a man were
found to be carefully secured either by iron
bars, or by shutters, and no vestige appear∣ed
of any person having attempted to pass
them; neither was it probable, that Ludo∣vico
would have incurred the risque of
breaking his neck, by leaping from a win∣dow,
when he might have walked safely
through a door.</P>
<P>The Count's amazement did not admit
of words; but he returned once more to ex∣amine
the bed-room, where was no appear∣ance
of disorder, except that occasioned by
the late overthrow of the chair, near which
had stood a small table, and on this Lu∣dovico's
sword, his lamp, the book he
had been reading, and the remnant of
his flask of wine still remained. At the
foot of the table, too, was the basket with
some fragments of provision and wood.</P>
<P>Henri and the servant now uttered their
astonishment without reserve, and, though
the Count said little, there was a seriousness
in his manner, that expressed much. It ap∣peared,
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
that Ludovico must have quitted
these rooms by some concealed passage, for
the Count could not believe, that any super∣natural
means had occasioned this event, yet,
if there was any such passage, it seemed inex∣plicable
why he should retreat through it,
and it was equally surprising, that not even
the smallest vestige should appear, by which
his progress could be traced. In the rooms
every thing remained as much in order as
if he had just walked out by the common
way.</P>
<P>The Count himself assisted in lifting the
arras, with which the bed-chamber, saloon
and one of the anti-rooms were hung, that
he might discover if any door had been
concealed behind it; but, after a laborious
search, none was found, and he, at length,
quitted the apartments, having secured the
door of the last anti-chamber, the key of
which he took into his own possession. He
then gave orders, that strict search should
be made for Ludovico not only in the cha∣teau,
but in the neighbourhood, and, retir∣ing
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
with Henri to his closet, they remained
there in conversation for a considerable
time, and whatever was the subject of it,
Henri from this hour lost much of his vi∣vacity,
and his manners were particularly
grave and reserved, whenever the topic,
which now agitated the Count's family
with wonder and alarm, was introduced.</P>
<P>On the disappearing of Ludovico, Baron
St. Foix seemed strengthened in all his for∣mer
opinions concerning the probability of
apparitions, though it was difficult to dis∣cover
what connection there could possibly
be between the two subjects, or to account
for this effect otherwise than by supposing,
that the mystery attending Ludovico, by
exciting awe and curiosity, reduced the
mind to a state of sensibility, which ren∣dered
it more liable to the influence of su∣perstition
in general. It is, however, cer∣tain,
that from this period the Baron and
his adherents became more bigoted to their
own systems than before, while the terrors
of the Count's servants increased to an ex∣cess,
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
that occasioned many of them to quit
the mansion immediately, and the rest re∣mained
only till others could be procured,
to supply their places.</P>
<P>The most strenuous search after Ludo∣vico
proved unsuccessful, and, after several
days of indefatigable enquiry, poor An∣nette
gave herself up to despair, and the
other inhabitants of the chateau to amaze∣ment.</P>
<P>Emily, whose mind had been deeply af∣fected
by the disastrous fate of the late Mar∣chioness
and with the mysterious connec∣tion,
which she fancied had existed between
her and St. Aubert, was particularly im∣pressed
by the late extraordinary event, and
much concerned for the loss of Ludovico,
whose integrity and faithful services claim∣ed
both her esteem and gratitude. She
was now very desirous to return to the quiet
retirement of her convent, but every hint
of this was received with real sorrow by the
Lady Blanche, and affectionately set aside
by the Count, for whom she felt much of
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
the respectful love and admiration of a
daughter, and to whom, by Dorothée's con∣sent,
she, at length mentioned the appear∣ance,
which they had witnessed in the cham∣ber
of the deceased Marchioness. At any
other period, he would have smiled at such
a relation, and have believed, that its object
had existed only in the distempered fancy of
the relater; but he now attended to Emily
with seriousness, and, when she concluded,
requested of her a promise, that this occur∣rence
should rest in silence. "Whatever
may be the cause and the import of these
extraordinary occurrences," added the
Count, "time only can explain them. I
shall keep a wary eye upon all that passes
in the chateau, and shall pursue every pos∣sible
means of discovering the fate of Lu∣dovico.
Meanwhile, we must be prudent
and be silent. I will myself watch in the
north chambers, but of this we will say no∣thing,
till the night arrives, when I purpose
doing so."</P>
<P>The Count then sent for Dorothée, and
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
required of her also a promise of silence,
concerning what she had already, or might
in future witness of an extraordinary na∣ture;
and this ancient servant now related
to him the particulars of the Marchioness
de Villeroi's death, with some of which he
appeared to be already acquainted, while
by others he was evidently surprised and
agitated. After listening to this narrative,
the Count retired to his closet, where he
remained alone for several hours; and,
when he again appeared, the folemnity of
his manner surprised and alarmed Emily,
but she gave no utterance to her thoughts.</P>
<P>On the week following the disappearance
of Ludovico, all the Count's guests took
leave of him, except the Baron, his son
Mons. St. Foix, and Emily; the latter of
whom was soon after embarrassed and di∣stressed
by the arrival of another visitor,
Mons. Du Pont, which made her deter∣mine
upon withdrawing to her convent im∣mediately.
The delight, that appeared in
his countenance, when he met her, told
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
that he brought back the same ardour of
passion, which had formerly banished him
from Chateau-le-Blanc. He was received
with reserve by Emily, and with pleasure by
the Count, who presented him to her with
a smile, that seemed intended to plead his
cause, and who did not hope the less for
his friend, from the embarrassment she be∣trayed.</P>
<P>But M. Du Pont, with truer sympathy,
seemed to understand her manner, and his
countenance quickly lost its vivacity, and
sunk into the languor of despondency.</P>
<P>On the following day, however, he sought
an opportunity of declaring the purport of
bis visit, and renewed his suit; a declara∣tion,
which was received with real concern
by Emily, who endeavoured to lessen the
pain she might inslict by a second rejection,
with assurances of esteem and friendship; yet
she left him in a state of mind, that claimed
and excited her tenderest compassion; and,
being more sensible than ever of the impro∣priety
of remaining longer at the chateau,
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
she immediately sought the Count, and
communicated to him her intention of re∣turning
to the convent.</P>
<P>"My dear Emily," said he, "I observe,
with extreme concern, the illusion you are
encouraging—an illusion common to young
and sensible minds. Your heart has re∣ceived
a severe shock; you believe you can
never entirely recover it, and you will en∣courage
this belief, till the habit of in∣dulging
sorrow will subdue the strength of
your mind, and discolour your future views
with melancholy and regret. Let me dissi∣pate
this illusion, and awaken you to a sense
of your danger."</P>
<P>Emily smiled mournfully, "I know
what you would say, my dear sir," said she,
"and am prepared to answer you. I feel,
that my heart can never know a second af∣fection;
and that I must never hope even to
recover its tranquillity—if I suffer myself
to enter into a second engagement."</P>
<P>"I know, that you feel all this," replied
the Count; "and I know, also, that time
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
will overcome these feelings, unless you che∣rish
them in solitude, and, pardon me, with
romantic tenderness. Then, indeed, time
will only confirm habit. I am particularly
empowered to speak on this subject, and to
sympathize in your sufferings," added the
Count, with an air of solemnity, "for I
have known what it is to love, and to la∣ment
the object of my love. Yes," conti∣nued
he, while his eyes filled with rears, "I
have suffered!—but those times have passed
away—long passed! and I can now look
back upon them without emotion."</P>
<P>"My dear sir," said Emily, timidly,
"what mean those tears?—they speak, I
fear, another language—they plead for me."</P>
<P>"They are weak tears, for they are use∣less
ones," replied the Count, drying them,
"I would have you superior to such weak∣ness.
These, however, are only faint traces
of a grief, which, if it had not been
opposed by long continued effort, might
have led me to the verge of madness!
Judge, then, whether I have not cause to
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
warn you of an indulgence, which may pro∣duce
so terrible an effect, and which must
certainly, if not opposed, overcloud the
years, that otherwise might be happy. M.
Du Pont is a sensible and amiable man, who
has long been tenderly attached to you;
his family and fortune are unexceptionable;—after
what I have said, it is unnecessary
to add, that I should rejoice in your felicity,
and that I think M. Du Pont would pro∣mote
it. Do not weep, Emily," continued
the Count, taking her hand, "there is hap∣piness
reserved for you."</P>
<P>He was silent a moment; and then
added, in a firmer voice, "I do not wish,
that you should make a violent effort to
overcome your feelings; all I, at present,
ask, is, that you will check the thoughts,
that would lead you to a remembrance of
the past; that you will suffer your mind to be
engaged by present objects; that you will al∣low
yourself to believe it possible you may
yet be happy; and that you will sometimes
think with complacency of poor Du Pont,
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
and not condemn him to the state of despon∣dency,
from which, my dear Emily, I am
endeavouring to withdraw you."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear sir," said Emily, while
her tears still fell, "do not suffer the bene∣volence
of your wishes to mislead Mons.Du
Pont with an expectation that I can ever ac∣cept
his hand. If I understand my own
heart, this never can be; your instruction I
can obey in almost every other particular,
than that of adopting a contrary belief."</P>
<P>"Leave me to understand your heart,"
replied the Count, with a faint smile. "If
you pay me the compliment to be guided by
my advice in other instances, I will pardon
your incredulity, respecting your future con∣duct
towards Mons. Du Pont. I will not
even press you to remain longer at the cha∣teau
than your own satisfaction will permit;
but though I forbear to oppose your present
retirement, I shall urge the claims of friend∣ship
for your future visits."</P>
<P>Tears of gratitude mingled with those of
tender regret, while Emily thanked the
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
Count for the many instances of friendship
she had received from him; promised to
be directed by his advice upon every sub∣ject
but one, and assured him of the plea∣sure,
with which she should, at some future
period, accept the invitation of the Countess
and himself—if Mons. Du Pont was not at
the chateau.</P>
<P>The Count smiled at this condition. "Be
it so," said he, "meanwhile the convent is
so near the chateau, that my daughter and
I shall often visit you; and if, sometimes,
we should dare to bring you another visitor—will
you forgive us?"</P>
<P>Emily looked distressed, and remained
silent.</P>
<P>"Well," rejoined the Count, "I will
pursue this subject no further, and must
now entreat your forgiveness for having
pressed it thus far. You will, however, do
me the justice to believe, that I have been
urged only by a sincere regard for your hap∣piness,
and that of my amiable friend Mons.
Du Pont."</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
Emily, when she left the Count, went to
mention her intended departure to the Coun∣tess,
who opposed it with polite expressions
of regret; after which, she sent a note to
acquaint the lady abbess, that she should
return to the convent; and thither she with∣drew
on the evening of the following day.
M. Du Pont, in extreme regret, saw her de∣part,
while the Count endeavoured to cheer
him with a hope, that Emily would some∣times
regard him with a more favourable
eye.</P>
<P>She was pleased to find herself once more
in the tranquil retirement of the convent,
where she experienced a renewal of all the
maternal kindness of the abbess, and of the
sisterly attentions of the nuns. A report of
the late extraordinary occurrence at the
chateau had already reached them, and, after
supper, on the evening of her arrival, it was
the subject of conversation in the convent
parlour, where she was requested to men∣tion
some particulars of that unaccountable
event. Emily was guarded in her conver∣sation,
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
on this subject, and briefly related a
few circumstances concerning Ludovico,
whose disappearance, her auditors almost
unanimously agreed, had been effected by
supernatural means.</P>
<P>"A belief had so long prevailed," said a
nun, who was called sister Frances, "that the
chateau was haunted, that I was surprised,
when I heard the Count had the temerity to
inhabit it. Its former possessor, I fear, had
some deed of conscience to atone for; let us
hope, that the virtues of its present owner
will preserve him from the punishment due
to the errors of the last, if, indeed, he was
criminal."</P>
<P>"Of what crime, then, was he suspected?"
said a Mademoiselle Feydeau, a boarder at
the convent.</P>
<P>"Let us pray for his soul!" said a nun,
who had till now sat in silent attention.
"If he was criminal, his punishment in
this world was sufficient."</P>
<P>There was a mixture of wildness and so∣lemnity
in her manner of delivering this,
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
which struck Emily exceedingly; but Ma∣demoiselle
repeated her question, without
noticing the solemn eagerness of the nun.</P>
<P>"I dare not presume to say what was his
crime," replied sister Frances; "but I have
heard many reports of an extraordinary na∣ture,
respecting the late Marquis de Villeroi,
and among others, that, soon after the death
of his lady, he quitted Chateau-le-Blanc,
and never afterwards returned to it. I was
not here at the time, so I can only mention
it from report, and so many years have
passed since the Marchioness died, that few
of our sisterhood, I believe, can do more."</P>
<P>"But I can," said the nun, who had be∣fore
spoke, and whom they called sister
Agnes.</P>
<P>"You then," said Mademoiselle Fey∣deau,
"are possibly acquainted with cir∣cumstances,
that enable you to judge, whe∣ther
he was criminal or not, and what was
the crime imputed to him."</P>
<P>"I am," replied the nun; "but who
shall dare to scrutinize my thoughts—who
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
shall dare to pluck out my opinion? God
only is his judge, and to that judge he is
gone!"</P>
<P>Emily looked with surprise at sister
Frances, who returned her a significant
glance."</P>
<P>"I only requested your opinion," said
Mademoiselle Feydeau, mildly; "if the
subject; is displeasing to you, I will drop it."</P>
<P>"Displeasing!"—said the nun, with em∣phasis.—"We
are idle talkers; we do not
weigh the meaning of the words we use;
<HI>displeasing</HI> is a poor word. I will go pray."
As she said this she rose from her seat, and
with a profound sigh quitted the room.</P>
<P>"What can be the meaning of this?"
said Emily, when she was gone.</P>
<P>"It is nothing extraordinary," replied sister
Frances, "she is often thus; but she has no
meaning in what she says. Her intellects
are at times deranged. Did you never see
her thus before?"</P>
<P>"Never," said Emily. "I have, indeed,
Sometimes, thought, that there was the me∣lancholy
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
of madness in her look, but never
before perceived it in her speech. Poor
soul, I will pray for her!"</P>
<P>"Your prayers then, my daughter, will
unite with burs," observed the lady abbess,
"she has need of them."</P>
<P>"Dear lady," said Mademoiselle Fey∣deau,
addressing the abbess, "what is your
opinion of the late Marquis? The strange
circumstances, that have occurred at the
chateau, have so much awakened my curi∣osity,
that I shall be pardoned the question.
What was his imputed crime, and what the
punishment, to which sister Agnes alluded?"</P>
<P>"We must be cautious of advancing our
opinion," said the abbess, with an air of
reserve, mingled with solemnity, "we must
be cautious of advancing our opinion on so
delicate a subject. I will not take upon me
to pronounce, that the late Marquis was
criminal, or to say what was the crime of
which he was suspected; but, concerning
the punishment our daughter Agnes hinted,
I know of none he suffered. She probably
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
alluded to the severe one, which an exaspe∣rated
conscience can inflict. Beware, my
children, of incurring so terrible a punish∣ment—it
is the purgatory of this life!
The late Marchioness I knew well; she was
a pattern to such as live in the world; nay,
our sacred order need not have blushed to
copy her virtues! Our holy convent re∣ceived
her mortal part; her heavenly spirit,
I doubt not, ascended to its sanctuary!"</P>
<P>As the abbess spoke this, the last bell of
vespers struck up, and she rose. "Let us
go, my children," said she, "and intercede
for the wretched; let us go and confess our
sins, and endeavour to purify our souls for
the heaven, to which <HI>she</HI> is gone!"</P>
<P>Emily was affected by the solemnity of
this exhortation, and, remembering her fa∣ther,
"The heaven, to which <HI>he,</HI> too, is
gone!" said she, faintly, as she suppressed
her sighs, and followed the abbess and the
nuns to the chapel.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>COUNT DE VILLEFORT, at length, received
a letter from the advocate at Avignon, en∣couraging
Emily to assert her claim to the
estates of the late Madame Montoni; and,
about the same time, a messenger arrived
from Monsieur Quesnel with intelligence,
that made an appeal to the law on this sub∣ject
unnecessary, since it appeared, that the
only person, who could have opposed her
claim, was now no more. A friend of M.
Quesnel, who resided at Venice, had sent
him an account of the death of Montoni,
who had been brought to trial with Orsino,
as his supposed accomplice in the murder
of the Venetian nobleman. Orsino was
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
found guilty, condemned and executed upon
the wheel, but, nothing being discovered to
criminate Montoni, and his colleagues, on
this charge, they were all released, except.
Montoni, who, being considered by the se∣nate
as a very dangerous person, was, for
other reasons, ordered again into confine∣ment,
where, it was said, he had died in a
doubtful and mysterious manner, and not
without suspicion of having been poisoned.
The authority, from which M. Quesnel
had received this information, would not al∣low
him to doubt its truth, and he told
Emily, that she had now only to lay claim
to the estates of her late aunt, to secure
them, and added, that he would himself assist
in the necessary forms of this business. The
term, for which La Vallée had been let being
now also nearly expired, he acquainted her
with the circumstance, and advised her to
take the road thither, through Tholouse,
where he promised to meet her, and where it
would be proper for her to take possession
of the estates, of the late Madame Montoni;
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
adding, that he would spare her any diffi∣culties,
that might occur on that occasion
from the want of knowledge on the subject,
and that he believed it would be necessary
for her to be at Tholouse, in about three
weeks from the present time.</P>
<P>An increase of fortune seemed to have
awakened this sudden kindness in M. Quesnel
towards his niece, and it appeared, that he
entertained more respect for the rich heiress,
than he had ever felt compassion for the
poor and unfriended orphan.</P>
<P>The pleasure, with which she received
this intelligence, was clouded when she con∣sidered,
that he, for whose sake she had once
regretted the want of fortune, was no longer
worthy of sharing it with her; but, remem∣bering
the friendly admonition of the Count,
she checked this melancholy reflection, and
endeavoured to feel only gratitude for the
unexpected good, that now attended her;
while it formed no inconsiderable part of her
satisfaction to know, that La Vallée, her na∣tive
home, which was endeared to her by it's
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
having been the residence of her parents,
would soon be restored to her possession.
There she meant to fix her future residence,
for, though it could not be compared with
the chateau at Tholouse, either for extent,
or magnificence, its pleasant scenes and the
tender remembrances, that haunted them,
had claims upon her heart, which she was
not inclined to sacrifice to ostentation. She
wrote immediately to thank M. Quesnel for
the active interest he took in her concerns,
and to say, that she would meet him at Tho∣louse
at the appointed time.</P>
<P>When Count de Villefort, with Blanche,
came to the convent to give Emily the ad∣vice
of the advocate, he was informed of the
contents of M. Quesnel's letter, and gave
her his sincere congratulations, on the occa∣sion;
but she observed, that, when the first
expression of satisfaction had faded from his
countenance, an unusual gravity succeeded,
and she scarcely hesitated to enquire its
cause.</P>
<P>"It has no new occasion," replied the
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
Count; "I am harassed and perplexed by
the confusion, into which my family is
thrown by their foolish superstition. Idle
reports are floating round me, which I can
neither admit to be true, or prove to be
false; and I am, also, very anxious about
the poor fellow, Ludovico, concerning whom
I have not been able to obtain information.
Every part of the chateau and every part of
the neighbourhood, too, has, I believe, been
searched, and I know not what further can
be done, since I have already offered large
rewards for the discovery of him. The keys
of the north apartment I have not suffered
to be out of my possession, since he disap∣peared,
and I mean to watch in those
chambers, myself, this very night."</P>
<P>Emily, seriously alarmed for the Count,
united her entreaties with those of the Lady
Blanche, to dissuade him from his pur∣pose.</P>
<P>"What should I fear?" said he. "I
have no faith in supernatural combats, and
for human opposition I shall be prepared;
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
nay, I will even promise not to watch
alone."</P>
<P>"But who, dear sir, will have courage
enough to watch with you?" said Emily.</P>
<P>"My son," replied the Count. "If I
am not carried off in the night," added he,
smiling, "you shall hear the result of my
adventure, to-morrow."</P>
<P>The Count and Lady Blanche, shortly
afterwards, took leave of Emily, and re∣turned
to the chateau, where he informed
Henri of his intention, who, not without
some secret reluctance, consented to be the
partner of his watch; and, when the design
was mentioned after supper, the Countess
was terrified, and the Baron, and M. Du
Pont joined with her in entreating, that
he would not tempt his fate, as Ludo∣vico
had done. "We know not," added
the Baron, "the nature, or the power of an
evil spirit; and that such a spirit haunts those
chambers can now, I think, scarcely be
doubted. Beware, my lord, how you pro∣voke
its vengeance, since it has already
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
given us one terrible example of its malice.
I allow it may be probable, that the spirits
of the dead are permitted to return to the
earth only on occasions of high import; but
the present import may be your destruc∣tion."</P>
<P>The Count could not forbear smiling;
"Do you think then, Baron," said he, "that
my destruction is of sufficient importance to
draw back to earth the soul of the departed?
Alas! my good friend, there is no occasion
for such means to accomplish the destruc∣tion
of any individual. Wherever the mys∣tery
rests, I trust I shall, this night, be able
to detect it. You know I am not supersti∣tious."</P>
<P>"I know that you are incredulous," in∣terrupted
the Baron.</P>
<P>"Well, call it what you will, I meant to
say, that, though you know I am free from
superstition—if any thing supernatural has
appeared, I doubt not it will appear to me,
and if any strange event hangs over my
house, or if any extraordinary transaction
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
has formerly been connected with it, I shall
probably be made acquainted with it. At
all events I will invite discovery; and, that
I may be equal to a mortal attack, which
in good truth, my friend, is what I most ex∣pect,
I shall take care to be well armed."</P>
<P>The Count took leave of his family, for
the night, with an assumed gaiety, which but
ill concealed the anxiety, that depressed his
spirits, and retired to the north apartments,
accompanied by his son and followed by the
Baron, M. Du Pont and some of the do∣mestics,
who all bade him good night at the
outer door. In these chambers every thing
appeared as when he had last been here;
even in the bed-room no alteration was visi∣ble,
where he lighted his own fire, for none
of the domestics could be prevailed upon to
venture thither. After carefully examining
the chamber and the oriel, the Count and
Henri drew their chairs upon the hearth, set
a bottle of wine and a lamp before them, laid
their swords upon the table, and, stirring
the wood into a blaze, began to converse on
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
indifferent topics. But Henri was often
silent and abstracted, and sometimes threw
a glance of mingled awe and curiosity round
the gloomy apartment; while the Count
gradually ceased to converse, and sat either
lost in thought, or reading a volume of Ta∣citus,
which he had brought to beguile the
tediousness of the night.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Baron St. Foix, whom anxiety for
his friend had kept awake, rose early to en∣quire
the event of the night, when, as he
passed the Count's closet, hearing steps
within, he knocked at the door, and it was
opened by his friend himself. Rejoicing to
see him in safety, and curious to learn the
occurrences of the night, he had not imme∣diately
leisure to observe the unusual gravity,
that overspread the features of the Count,
whose reserved answers first occasioned him
to notice it. The Count, then smiling, en∣deavoured
to treat the subject of his curio∣sity
with levity; but the Baron was serious,
and pursued his enquiries so closely, that
the Count, at length, resuming his gravity,
said, "Well, my friend, press the subject
no further, I entreat you; and let me re∣quest
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
also, that you will hereafter be silent
upon any thing you may think extraordi∣nary
in my future conduct. I do not scru∣ple
to tell you, that I am unhappy, and that
the watch of the last night has not assisted
me to discover Ludovico; upon every oc∣currence
of the night you must excuse my
reserve."</P>
<P>"But where▪ is Henri?" said the Baron,
with surprise and disappointment at this
denial.</P>
<P>"He is well in his own apartment," re∣plied
the Count. "You will not question
him on this topic, my friend, since you know
my wish."</P>
<P>"Certainly not," said the Baron, some∣what
chagrined, "since it would be displeas∣ing
to you; but methinks, my friend, you
might rely on my discretion, and drop this
unusual reserve. However, you must allow
me to suspect, that you have seen rea∣son
to become a convert to my system, and
are no longer the incredulous knight you
lately appeared to be."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163"/>
"Let us talk no more upon this sub∣ject,"
said the Count; "you may be as∣sured,
that no ordinary circumstance has
imposed this silence upon me towards a
friend, whom I have called so for near thirty
years; and my present reserve cannot make
you question either my esteem, or the sin∣cerity
of my friendship."</P>
<P>"I will not doubt either," said the Baron,
"though you must allow me to express my
surprise, at this silence."</P>
<P>"To me I will allow it," replied the
Count, "but I earnestly entreat that you
will forbear to notice it to my family, as
well as every thing remarkable you may
observe in my conduct towards them."</P>
<P>The Baron readily promised this, and,
after conversing for some time on general
topics, they descended to the breakfast∣room,
where the Count met his family with
a cheerful countenance, and evaded their
enquiries by employing light ridicule, and
assuming an air of uncommon gaiety, while
he assured them, that they need not appre∣hend
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
any evil from the north chambers,
since Henri and himself had been permit∣ted
to return from them in safety.</P>
<P>Henri, however, was less successful in dis∣guising
his feelings. From his counte∣nance
an expression of terror was not entire∣ly
faded; he was often silent and thought∣ful,
and, when he attempted to laugh at the
eager enquiries of mademoiselle Bearn, it
was evidently only an attempt.</P>
<P>In the evening, the Count called, as he
had promised, at the convent, and Emily
was surprifed to perceive a mixture of play∣ful
ridicule and of reserve in his mention
of the north apartment. Of what had oc∣curred
there, however, he said nothing, and,
when she ventured to remind him of his
promise to tell her the result of his enqui∣ries,
and to ask if he had received any
proof, that those chambers were haunted, his
look became solemn, for a moment, then,
seeming to recollect himself, he smiled, and
said, "My dear Emily, do not suffer my
lady abbess to infect your good understand∣ing
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
with these fancies; she will teach you
to expect a ghost in every dark room. But
believe me," added he, with a profound
sigh, "the apparition of the dead comes
not on light, or sportive errands, to terrify,
or to surprise the timid." He paused, and
fell into a momentary thoughtfulness, and
then added, "We will say no more on this
subject."</P>
<P>Soon after, he took leave, and, when
Emily joined some of the nuns, she was
surprised to find them acquainted with a
circumstance, which she had carefully
avoided to mention, and expressing their
admiration of his intrepidity in having dar∣ed
to pass a night in the apartment, whence
Ludovico had disappeared; for she had not
considered with what rapidity a tale of
wonder circulates. The nuns had acqui∣red
their information from peasants, who
brought fruit to the monastery, and whose
whole attention had been fixed, since the
disappearance of Ludovico, on what was
passing in the castle.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>
Emily listened in silence to the various
opinions of the nuns, concerning the con∣duct
of the Count, most of whom condemn∣ed
it as rash and presumptuous, affirming,
that it was provoking the vengeance of an
evil spirit, thus to intrude upon its haunts.</P>
<P>Sister Frances contended, that the Count
had acted with the bravery of a virtuous
mind. He knew himself guiltless of aught,
that should provoke a good spirit, and did
not fear the spells of an evil one, since he
could claim the protection of an higher
Power, of Him, who can command the
wicked, and will protect the innocent.</P>
<P>"The guilty cannot claim that protec∣tion!"
said sister Agnes, "let the Count
look to his conduct, that he do not forfeit
his claim! Yet who is he, that shall dare
to call himself innocent!—all earthly inno∣cence
is but comparative. Yet still how
wide asunder are the extremes of guilt, and
to what an horrible depth may we fall!
Oh!"—</P>
<P>The nun, as she concluded, uttered a
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
shuddering sigh, that startled Emily, Who,
looking up, perceived the eyes of Agnes
fixed on hers; after which the sister rose,
took her hand, gazed earnestly upon her
countenance, for some moments, in silence,
and then said,</P>
<P>"You are young—you are innocent!
I mean you are yet innocent of any great
crime!—But you have passions in your
heart,—scorpions; they sleep now—be∣ware
how you awaken them!—they will
sting you, even unto death!"</P>
<P>Emily, affected by these words and by
the solemnity, with which they were de∣livered,
could not suppress her tears.</P>
<P>"Ah! is it so?" exclaimed Agnes, her
countenance softening from its sternness—"so
young, and so unfortunate! We are
sisters, then indeed. Yet, there is no bond
of kindness among the guilty," she added,
while her eyes resumed their wild expres∣sion,
"no gentleness,—no peace, no hope!
I knew them all once—my eyes could
weep—but now they burn, for now, my
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
soul is fixed, and fearless!—I lament no
more!"</P>
<P>"Rather let us repent, and pray," said
another nun. "We are taught to hope,
that prayer and penitence will work our
salvation. There is hope for all who re∣pent!"</P>
<P>"Who repent and turn to the true
faith," observed sister Frances.</P>
<P>"For all but me!" replied Agnes so∣lemnly,
who paused, and then abruptly
added, "My head burns, I believe I am
not well. O! could I strike from my me∣mory
all former scenes—the figures, that
rise up, like furies, to torment me!—I see
them, when I sleep, and, when I am awake,
they are still before my eyes! I see them
now—now!</P>
<P>She stood, in a fixed attitude of horror,
her straining eyes moving slowly round the
room, as if they followed something. One
of the huns gently took her hand, to lead
her from the parlour. Agnes became calm,
drew her other hand across her eyes, look∣ed
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
again, and, sighing deeply, said, "They
are gone—they are gone! I am feverish, I
know not what I say. I am thus, some∣times,
but it will go off again, I shall soon
be better. Was not that the vesper∣bell?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Frances, "the evening
service is passed. Let Margaret lead you
to your cell."</P>
<P>"You are right," replied sister Agnes,
"I shall be better there. Good night, my
sisters, remember me in your orisons!"</P>
<P>When they had withdrawn, Frances, ob∣serving
Emily's emotion, said, "Do not be
alarmed, our sister is often thus deranged,
though I have not lately seen her so fran∣tic;
her usual mood is melancholy. This
fit has been coming on, for several days;
seclusion and the customary treatment will
restore her."</P>
<P>"But how rationally she conversed, at
first!" observed Emily," "her ideas fol∣lowed
each other in perfect order."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied the nun, "this is no∣thing
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
new; nay, I have sometimes known
her argue not only with method, but with
acuteness, and then, in a moment, start off
into madness."</P>
<P>"Her conscience seems afflicted," said
Emily, "did you ever hear what circum∣stance
reduced her to this deplorable con∣dition?"</P>
<P>"I have," replied the nun, who said no
more till Emily repeated the question, when
she added in a low voice, and looking sig∣nificantly
towards the other boarders, "I
cannot tell you now, but, if you think it
worth your while, come to my cell, to-night,
when our sisterhood are at rest, and you
shall hear more; but remember we rise to
midnight prayers, and come either before,
or after midnight."</P>
<P>Emily promised to remember, and, the
abbess soon after appearing, they spoke no
more of the unhappy nun.</P>
<P>The Count, meanwhile, on his return
home, had found M. Du Pont in one of
those fits of despondency, which his attach∣ment
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
to Emily frequently occasioned him,
an attachment, that had subsisted too long
to be easily subdued, and which had already
outlived the opposition of his friends. M.
Du Pont had first seen Emily in Gascony,
during the lifetime of his parent, who, on
discovering his son's partiality for mademoi∣selle
St. Aubert, his inferior in point of for∣tune,
forbade him to declare it to her fa∣mily,
or to think of her more. During the
life of his father, he had observed the first
command, but had found it impracticable
to obey the second, and had, sometimes,
soothed his passion by visiting her favourite
haunts, among which was the fishing-house,
where, once or twice, he addressed her in
verse, concealing his name, in obedience to
the promise he had given his father. There
too he played the pathetic air, to which she
had listened with such surprise and admira∣tion;
and there he found the miniature, that
had since cherished a passion fatal to his re∣pose.
During his expedition into Italy, his
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
father died; but he received his liberty at a
moment, when he was the least enabled to
profit by it, since the object, that rendered
it most valuable, was no longer within the
reach of his vows. By what accident he
discovered Emily, and assisted to release her
from a terrible imprisonment, has already ap∣peared,
and also the unavailing hope, with
which he then encouraged his love, and the
fruitless efforts, that he had since made to
overcome it.</P>
<P>The Count still endeavoured, with friend∣ly
zeal, to sooth him with a belief, that pa∣tience,
perseverance and prudence would
finally obtain for him happiness and Emi∣ly;
"Time," said he, "will wear away
the melancholy impression, which disap∣pointment
has left on her mind, and she
will be sensible of your merit. Your ser∣vices
have already awakened her gratitude,
and your sufferings her pity; and trust me,
my friend, in a heart so sensible as hers,
gratitude and pity lead to love. When her
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
imagination is rescued from its present de∣lusion,
she will readily accept the homage
of a mind like yours."</P>
<P>Du Pont sighed, while he listened to these
words; and, endeavouring to hope what his
friend believed, he willingly yielded to an
invitation to prolong his visit at the cha∣teau,
which we now leave for the monastery
of St. Claire.</P>
<P>When the nuns had retired to rest, Emily
stole to her appointment with sister Frances,
whom she found in her cell, engaged in
prayer, before a little table, where appeared
the image she was addressing, and, above,
the dim lamp, that gave light to the place.
Turning her eyes, as the door opened, she
beckoned to Emily to come in, who, having
done so, seated herself in silence beside the
nun's little mattress of straw, till her orisons
should conclude. The latter soon rose from
her knees, and, taking down the lamp and
placing it on the table, Emily perceived there
a human scull and bones, lying beside an
hour-glass; but the nun, without observing
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
her emotion, sat down on the mattress by
her, saying, "Your curiosity, sister, has
made you punctual, but you have nothing
remarkable to hear in the history of poor
Agnes, of whom I avoided to speak in the
presence of my lay-sisters, only because I
would not publish her crime to them."</P>
<P>"I shall consider your confidence in me
as a favour," said Emily, "and will not
misuse it."</P>
<P>"Sister Agnes," resumed the nun, "is
of a noble family, as the dignity of her air
must already have informed you, but I will
not dishonour their name so much as to re∣veal
it. Love was the occasion of her crime
and of her madness. She was beloved by a
gentleman of inferior fortune, and her fa∣ther,
as I have heard, bestowing her on a
nobleman, whom she disliked, an ill-go∣verned
passion proved her destruction.—Every
obligation of virtue and of duty was
forgotten, and she prophaned her marriage
vows; but her guilt was soon detected, and
she would have fallen a sacrifice to the ven∣geance
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
of her husband, had not her father
contrived to convey her from his power. By
what means he did this, I never could learn;
but he secreted her in this convent, where he
afterwards prevailed with her to take the
veil, while a report was circulated in the
world, that she was dead, and the father, to
save his daughter, assisted the rumour, and
employed such means as induced her hus∣band
to believe she had become a victim to
his jealousy. You look surprised," added
the nun, observing Emily's countenance;
"I allow the story is uncommon, but not, I
believe, without a parallel."</P>
<P>"Pray proceed," said Emily, "I am in∣terested."</P>
<P>"The story is already told," resumed the
nun, "I have only to mention that the
long struggle, which Agnes suffered, between
love, remorse and a sense of the duties she
had taken upon herself in becoming of our
order, at length unsettled her reason. At first,
she was frantic and melancholy by quick al∣ternatives;
then, she sunk into a deep and
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
settled melancholy, which still, however,
has, at times, been interrupted by fits of
wildness, and, of late, these have again been
frequent."</P>
<P>Emily was affected by the history of the
sister, some parts of whose story brought to
her remembrance that of the Marchioness
de Villeroi, who had also been compelled by
her father to forsake the object of her affec∣tions,
for a nobleman of his choice; but, from
what Dorothée had related, there appeared
no reason to suppose, that she had escaped
the vengeance of a jealous husband, or to
doubt for a moment the innocence of her
conduct. But Emily, while she sighed over
the misery of the nun, could not forbear
shedding a few tears to the misfortunes of
the Marchioness; and, when she returned to
the mention of sister Agnes, she asked Fran∣ces
if she remembered her in her youth, and
whether she was then beautiful.</P>
<P>"I was not here at the time, when she
took the vows," replied Frances, "which is
so long ago, that few of the present sister∣hood,
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
I believe, were witnesses of the cere∣mony;
nay, even our lady mother did not
then preside over the convent: but I can re∣member,
when sister Agnes was a very beau∣tiful
woman. She retains that air of high
rank, which always distinguished her, but
her beauty, you must perceive, is fled; I
can scarcely discover even a vestige of the
loveliness, that once animated her features."</P>
<P>"It is strange," said Emily, "but there
are moments, when her countenance has ap∣peared
familiar to my memory! You will
think me-fanciful, and I think myself so, for
I certainly never saw sister Agnes, before I
came to this convent, and I must, therefore,
have seen some person, whom she strongly
resembles, though of this I have no recol∣lection."</P>
<P>"You have been interested by the deep
melancholy of her countenance," said Fran∣ces,
"and its impression has probably de∣luded
your imagination; for I might as rea∣sonably
think I perceive a likeness between
you and Agnes, as you, that you have seen
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
her any where but in this convent, since this
has been her place of refuge, for nearly as
many years as make your age."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" said Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes," rejoined Frances, "and why
does that circumstance excite your sur∣prise?"</P>
<P>Emily did not appear to notice this ques∣tion,
but remained thoughtful, for a few
moments, and then said, "It was about that
same period that the Marchioness de Ville∣roi
expired."</P>
<P>"That is an odd remark," said Frances.</P>
<P>Emily, recalled from her reverie, smiled,
and gave the conversation another turn, but
it soon came back to the subject of the un∣happy
nun, and Emily remained in the cell
of sister Frances, till the mid-night bell
aroused her; when, apologizing for having
interrupted the sister's repose, till this late
hour, they quitted the cell together. Emily
returned to her chamber, and the nun,
bearing a glimmering taper, went to her de∣votion
in the-chapel.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179"/>
Several days followed, during which Emi∣ly
saw neither the Count, or any of his fa∣mily;
and, when, at length, he appeared,
she remarked, with concern, that his air was
unusually disturbed.</P>
<P>"My spirits are harassed," said he, in
answer to her anxious enquiries, "and I
mean to change my residence, for a little
while, an experiment, which, I hope, will
restore my mind to its usual tranquillity.
My daughter and myself will accompany
the Baron St. Foix to his chateau. It lies
in a valley of the Pyrenées, that opens to∣wards
Gascony, and I have been thinking,
Emily, that, when you set out for La Val∣lée,
we may go part of the way together; it
would be a satisfaction to me to guard you
towards your home.</P>
<P>She thanked the Count for his friendly
consideration, and lamented, that the neces∣sity
for her going first to Tholouse would
render this plan impracticable, "But, when
you are at the Baron's residence," she added,
"you will be only a short journey from La
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
Vallée, and I think, sir, you will not leave
the country without visiting me; it is unne∣cessary
to say with what pleasure I should
receive you and the Lady Blanche."</P>
<P>"I do not doubt it," replied the Count,
"and I will not deny myself and Blanche
the pleasure of visiting you, if your affairs
should allow you to be at La Vallée, about
the time when we can meet you there."</P>
<P>When Emily said that she should hope to
see the Countess also, she was not sorry to
learn that this lady was going, accompanied
by Mademoiselle Bearn, to pay a visit, for a
few weeks, to a family in lower Languedoc.</P>
<P>The Count, after some further conversa∣tion
on his intended journey and on the
arrangement of Emily's, took leave; and
many days did not succeed this visit, before
a second letter from M. Quesnel informed
her, that he was then at Tholouse, that La
Vallée was at liberty, and that he wished
her to set off for the former place, where he
awaited her arrival, with all possible dis∣patch,
since his own affairs pressed him to
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
return to Gascony. Emily did not hesitate
to obey him, and, having taken an affecting
leave of the Count's family, in which M.
Du Pont was still included, and of her
friends at the convent, she set out for Tho∣louse,
attended by the unhappy Annette,
and guarded by a steady servant of the
Count.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Lull'd in the countless chambers of the brain,</L>
<L>Our thoughts are link'd by many a hidden chain:</L>
<L>Awake but one, and lo! what myriads rise!</L>
<L>Each stamps its image as the other flies!</L></Q>
<BIBL>PLEASURES OF MEMORY.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY pursued her journey, without
any accident, along the plains of Langue∣doc
towards the north-west; and, on this
her return to Tholouse, which she had last
left with Madame Montoni, she thought
much on the melancholy fate of her aunt,
who, but for her own imprudence, might now
have been living in happiness there! Mon∣toni,
too, often rose to her fancy, such as
she had seen him in his days of triumph,
bold, spirited and commanding; such also
as she had since beheld him in his days of
vengeance; and now, only a few short
months had passed—and he had no longer
the power, or the will to afflict;—he had become
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
come a clod of earth, and his life was va∣nished
like a shadow! Emily could have
wept at his fate, had she not remembered
his crimes; for that of her unfortunate aunt
she did weep, and all sense of her errors was
overcome by the recollection of her misfor∣tunes.</P>
<P>Other thoughts and other emotions suc∣ceeded,
as Emily drew near the well-known
scenes of her early love, and considered, that
Valancourt was lost to her and to himself,
for ever. At length, she came to the brow
of the hill, whence, on her departure for
Italy, she had given a farewell look to this
beloved landscape, amongst whose woods and
fields she had so often walked with Valan∣court,
and where he was then to inhabit,
when she would be far, far away! She saw,
once more, that chain of the Pyrenées, which
overlooked La Vallée, rising, like faint
clouds, on the horizon. "There, too, is
Gascony, extended at their feet!" said she,
"O my father,—my mother! And there,
too, is the Garonne!" she added, drying
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
the tears, that obscured her sight,—" and
Tholouse, and my aunt's mansion—and the
groves in her garden!—O my friends! are
ye all lost to me—must I never, never see
ye more!" Tears rushed again to her eyes,
and. she continued to weep, till an abrupt
turn in the road had nearly occasioned the
carriage to overset, when, looking up, she
perceived another part of the well-known
scene around Tholouse, and all the reflec∣tions
and anticipations, which she had suf∣fered,
at the moment, when she bade it last
adieu, came with recollected force to her
heart. She remembered how anxiously she
had looked forward to the futurity, which
was to decide her happiness concerning Va∣lancourt,
and what depressing fears had as∣sailed
her; the very words she had uttered,
as she withdrew her last look from the pro∣spect,
came to her memory. "Could I but
be certain," she had then said, "that I
should ever return, and that Valancourt
would still live for me—I should go in
peace!"</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185"/>
Now, that futurity, so anxiously antici∣pated,
was arrived, she was returned—but
what a dreary blank appeared!—Valancourt
no longer lived for her! She had no longer
even the melancholy satisfaction of contem∣plating
his image in her heart, for he was
no longer the same Valancourt she had
cherished there—the solace of many a mourn∣ful
hour, the animating friend, that had en∣abled
her to bear up against the oppression
of Montoni—the distant hope, that had
beamed over her gloomy prospect! On per∣ceiving
this beloved idea to be an illusion of
her own creation, Valancourt seemed to be
annihilated, and her soul sickened at the
blank, that remained. His marriage with
a rival, even his death, she thought she
could have endured with more fortitude,
than this discovery; for then, amidst all her
grief, she could have looked in secret upon
the image of goodness, which her fancy had
drawn of him, and comfort would have
mingled with her suffering!</P>
<P>Drying her tears, she looked, once more,
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
upon the landscape, which had excited them,
and perceived, that she was passing the very
bank, where she had taken leave of Valan∣court,
on the morning of her departure from
Tholouse, and she now saw him, through her
returning tears, such as he had appeared,
when she looked from the carriage to give
him a last adieu—saw him leaning mourn∣fully
against the high trees, and remembered
the fixed look of mingled tenderness and
anguish, with which he had then regarded
her. This recollection was too much for
her heart, and she sunk back in the carriage,
nor once looked up, till it stopped at the
gates of what was now her own mansion.</P>
<P>These being opened, and by the servant,
to whose care the chateau had been entrust∣ed,
the carriage drove into the court, where,
alighting, she hastily passed through the great
hall, now silent and solitary, to a large oak
parlour, the common sitting room of the late
Madame Montoni, where, instead of being
received by M. Quesnel, she found a letter
from him, informing her, that business of
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
consequence had obliged him to leave Tho∣louse
two days before. Emily was, upon
the whole, not sorry to be spared his pre∣sence,
since his abrupt departure appeared
to indicate the same indifference, with which
he had formerly regarded her. This letter
informed her, also, of the progress he had
made in the settlement of her affairs, and
concluded with directions, concerning the
forms of some business, which remained for
her to transact. But M. Quesnel's unkind∣ness
did not long occupy her thoughts,
which returned to the remembrance of the
persons she had been accustomed to see in this
mansion, and chiefly of the ill-guided and un∣fortunate
Madame Montoni. In the room,
where she now sat, she had breakfasted with
her on the morning of their departure for
Italy; and the view of it brought most for∣cibly
to her recollection all she had herself
suffered, at that time, and the many gay ex∣pectations,
which her aunt had formed, re∣specting
the journey before her. While
Emily's mind was thus engaged, her eyes
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
wandered unconsciously to a large window,
that looked upon the garden, and here new
memorials of the past spoke to her heart,
for she saw extended before her the very
avenue, in which she had parted with Va∣lancourt,
on the eve of her journey; and all
the anxiety, the tender interest he had shewn,
concerning her future happiness, his earnest
remonstrances against her committing her∣self
to the power of Montoni, and the truth
of his affection, came afresh to her memory.
At this moment, it appeared almost impossi∣ble,
that Valancourt could have become un∣worthy
of her regard, and she doubted all that
she had lately heard to his disadvantage, and
even his own words, which had confirmed
Count De Villefort's report of him. Over∣come
by the recollections, which the view of
this avenue occasioned, she turned abruptly
from the window, and sunk into a chair be∣side
it, where she sat, given up to grief, till
the entrance of Annette, with coffee, aroused
her.</P>
<P>"Dear madam, how melancholy this place
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
looks now," said Annette, "to what it used
to do! It is dismal coming home, when
there is nobody to welcome one!"</P>
<P>This was not the moment, in which
Emily could bear the remark; her tears fell
again, and, as soon as she had taken the
coffee, she retired to her apartment, where
she endeavoured to repose. her fatigued spi∣rits.
But busy memory would still supply
her with the visions of former times: she
saw Valancourt interesting and benevolent,
as he had been wont to appear in the days
of their early love, and, amidst the scenes,
where she had believed that they should
sometimes pass their years together!—but,
at length, sleep closed these afflicting scenes
from her view.</P>
<P>On the following morning, serious occu∣pation
recovered her from such melancholy
reflections; for, being desirous of quitting
Tholouse, and of hastening on to La Val∣lee,
she made some enquiries into the condi∣tion
of the estate, and immediately dis∣patched
a part of the necessary business
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
concerning it, according to the directions of
Mons. Quesnel. It required a strong effort
to abstract her thoughts from other interests
sufficiently to attend to this, but she was re∣warded
for her exertions by again experi∣encing,
that employment is the surest anti∣dote
to sorrow.</P>
<P>This day was devoted entirely to busi∣ness;
and, among other concerns, she em∣ployed
means to learn the situation of all
her poor tenants, that she might relieve
their wants, or confirm their comforts.</P>
<P>In the evening, her spirits were so much
strengthened, that she thought she could
bear to visit the gardens, where she had so
often walked with Valancourt; and, know∣ing,
that, if she delayed to do so, their
scenes would only affect her the more,
whenever they should be viewed, she took
advantage of the present state of her mind,
and entered them.</P>
<P>Passing hastily the gate leading from the
court into the gardens, she hurried up the
great avenue, scarcely permitting her me∣mory
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
to dwell for a moment on the circum∣stance
of her having here parted with Valan∣court,
and soon quitted this for other walks
less interesting to her heart. These brought
her, at length, to the flight of steps, that led
from the lower garden to the terrace, on
seeing which, she became agitated, and hesi∣tated
whether to ascend, but, her resolution
returning, she proceeded.</P>
<P>"Ah!" said Emily, as she ascended,
"these are the same high trees, that used to
wave over the terrace, and these the same
flowery thickets—the liburnum, the wild
rose, and the cerinthe—which were wont to
grow beneath them! Ah! and there, too,
on that bank, are the very plants, which
Valancourt so carefully reared!—O when
last I saw them!"—She checked the thought,
but could not restrain her tears, and, after
walking slowly on for a few moments, her
agitation, upon the view of this well-known
scene, increased so much, that she was obliged
to stop, and lean upon the wall of the ter∣race.
It was a mild, and beautiful evening.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
The sun was setting over the extensive land∣scape,
to which his beams, sloping from be∣neath
a dark cloud, that overhung the
west, gave rich and partial colouring, and
touched the tufted summits of the groves,
that rose from the garden below, with a
yellow gleam. Emily and Valancourt had
often admired together this scene, at the
same hour; and it was exactly on this spot,
that, on the night preceding her departure
for Italy, she had listened to his remon∣strances
against the journey, and to the
pleadings of passionate affection. Some ob∣servations,
which she made on the landscape,
brought this to her remembrance, and with
it all the minute particulars of that conver∣sation;—the
alarming doubts he had ex∣pressed
concerning Montoni, doubts, which
had since been fatally confirmed; the rea∣sons
and entreaties he had employed to pre∣vail
with her to consent to an immediate
marriage; the tenderness of his love, the
paroxysms of his grief, and the conviction
he had repeatedly expressed, that they should
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
never meet again in happiness! All these
circumstances rose afresh to her mind, and
awakened the various emotions she had then
suffered. Her tenderness for Valancourt
became as powerful as in the moments,
when she thought, that she was parting with
him and happiness together, and when the
strength of her mind had enabled her to
triumph over present suffering, rather than
to deserve the reproach of her conscience
by engaging in a clandestine marriage.—"Alas!"
said Emily, as these recol∣lections
came to her mind, "and what
have I gained by the fortitude I then prac∣tised?—am
I happy now?—He said, we
should meet no more in happiness; but, O!
he little thought his own misconduct would
separate us, and lead to the very evil he
then dreaded!"</P>
<P>Her reflections increased her anguish,
while she was compelled to acknowledge,
that the fortitude she had formerly exerted,
if it had not conducted her to happiness,
had saved her from irretrievable misfortune
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
—from Valancourt himself! But in these
moments she could not congratulate herself
on the prudence, that had saved her: she
could only lament, with bitterest anguish,
the circumstances, which had conspired to
betray Valancourt into a course of life so
different from that, which the virtues, the
taste, and the pursuits of his early years
had promised; but she still loved him too
well to believe, that his heart was even now
depraved, though his conduct had been cri∣minal.
An observation, which had fallen
from M. St. Aubert more than once, now
occurred to her. "This young man,"
said he, speaking of Valancourt, "has ne∣ver
been at Paris;" a remark, that had sur∣prised
her at the time it was uttered, but
which me now understood, and she ex∣claimed
sorrowfully, "O Valancourt! if
such a friend, as my father had been with
you at Paris—your noble, ingenuous na∣ture
would not have fallen,!".</P>
<P>The sun was now set, and, recalling her
thoughts from their melancholy subject, she
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
continued her walk; for the pensive shade
of twilight was pleasing to her, and the
nightingales from the surrounding groves
began to answer each other in the long∣drawn,
plaintive note, which always touched
her heart; while all the fragrance of the
flowery thickets, that bounded the terrace,
was awakened by the cool evening air,
which floated so lightly among their leaves,
that they scarcely trembled as it passed.</P>
<P>Emily came, at length, to the steps of
the pavilion, that terminated the terrace,
and where her last interview with Valan∣court,
before her departure from Tholouse,
had so unexpectedly taken place. The
door was now shut, and she trembled, while
she hesitated whether to open it; but her
wish to see again a place, which had been
the chief scene of her former happiness, at
length overcoming her reluctance to en∣counter
the painful regret it would renew,
she entered. The room was obscured by a
melancholy shade; but through the open
lattices, darkened by the hanging foliage of
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
the vines, appeared the dusky landscape,
the Garonne reflecting the evening light,
and the west still glowing. A chair was
placed near one of the balconies, as if some
person had been sitting there, but the other
furniture of the pavilion remained exactly
as usual, and Emily thought it looked as
if it had not once been moved since she set
out for Italy. The silent and deserted air
of the place added solemnity to her emo∣tions,
for she heard only the low whisper of
the breeze, as it shook. the leaves of the
vines, and the very faint murmur of the
Garonne.</P>
<P>She seated herself in a chair, near the lat∣tice,
and yielded to the sadness of her heart,
while she recollected the circumstances of
her parting interview with Valancourt, on
this spot. It was here too, that she had
passed some of the happiest hours of her
life with him, when her aunt favoured the
connection, for here she had often sat and
worked, while he conversed, or read; and
she now well remembered with what discri∣minating
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
judgment, with what tempered
energy, he used to repeat some of the sub∣limest
passages of their favourite authors;
how often he would pause to admire with
her their excellence, and with what tender
delight he would listen to her remarks, and
correct her taste.</P>
<P>"And is it possible," said Emily, as
these recollections returned—"is it possible,
that a mind, so susceptible of whatever is
grand and beautiful, could stoop to low
pursuits, and be subdued by frivolous temp∣tations?"</P>
<P>She remembered how often she had seen
the sudden tear start in his eye, and had
heard his voice tremble with emotion,
while he related any great or benevolent
action, or repeated a sentiment of the same
character. "And such a mind," said she,
"such a heart, were to be sacrificed to the
habits of a great city!"</P>
<P>These recollections becoming too painful
to be endured, she abruptly left the pavi∣lion,
and, anxious to escape from the memor∣ials
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
of her departed happiness, returned
towards the chateau. As she passed along
the terrace, she perceived a person, walking,
with a slow step, and a dejected air, under
the trees, at some distance. The twilight,
which was now deep, would not allow her
to distinguish who it was, and she imagined
it to be one of the servants, till, the sound
of her steps seeming to reach him, he turn∣ed
half round, and she thought she saw
Valancourt!</P>
<P>Whoever it was, he instantly struck
among the thickets on the left, and disap∣peared,
while Emily, her eyes fixed on the
place, whence he had vanished, and her
frame trembling so excessively, that she
could scarcely support herself, remained,
for some moments, unable to quit the spot,
and scarcely conscious of existence. With
her recollection, her strength returned, and
she hurried toward the house, where she
did not venture to enquire who had been
in the gardens, lest she should betray her
emotion; and she sat down alone, endea∣vouring
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
to recollect the figure, air and fea∣tures
of the person she had just seen. Her
view of him, however, had been so tran∣sient,
and the gloom had rendered it so im∣perfect,
that she could remember nothing
with exactness; yet the general appear∣ance
of his figure, and his abrupt depar∣ture,
made her still believe, that this per∣son
was Valancourt. Sometimes, indeed,
she thought, that her fancy, which had
been occupied by the idea of him, had
suggested his image to her uncertain sight:
but this conjecture was fleeting. If it was
himself, whom she had seen, she wondered
much, that he should be at Tholouse, and
more, how he had gained admittance into
the garden; but as often as her impatience
prompted her to enquire whether any stranger
had been admitted, she was restrained by an
unwillingness to betray her doubts; and the
evening was passed in anxious conjecture,
and in efforts to dismiss the subject from
her thoughts. But, these endeavours were
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
ineffectual, and a thousand inconsistent
emotions assailed her, whenever she fancied
that Valancourt might be near her; now,
she dreaded it to be true, and now she fear∣ed
it to be false; and, while she constantly
tried to persuade herself, that she wished
the person, whom she had seen, might not
be Valancourt, her heart as constantly con∣tradicted
her reason.</P>
<P>The following day was occupied by the
visits of several neighbouring families, for∣merly
intimate with Madame Montoni, who
came to condole with Emily on her death,
to congratulate her upon the acquisition of
these estates, and to enquire about Montoni,
and concerning the strange reports they had
heard of her own situation; all which was
done with the utmost decorum, and the vi∣sitors
departed with as much composure as
they had arrived.</P>
<P>Emily was wearied by these formalities,
and disgusted by the subservient manners of
many persons, who had thought her scarce∣ly
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
worthy of common attention, while she
was believed to be a dependant on Madame
Montoni.</P>
<P>"Surely," said she, "there is some ma∣gic
in wealth, which can thus make per∣sons
pay their court to it, when it does not
even benefit themselves. How strange it
is, that a fool or a knave, with riches,
should be treated with more respect by the
world, than a good man, or a wise man in
poverty!"</P>
<P>It was evening, before she was left alone,
and she then wished to have refreshed her
spirits in the free air of her garden; but she
feared to go thither, lest she should meet
again the person, whom she had seen on
the preceding night, and he should prove
to be Valancourt. The suspense and anx∣iety
she suffered, on this subject, she found
all her efforts unable to controul, and her se∣cret
wish to see Valancourt once more, though
unseen by him, powerfully prompted her
to go, but prudence and a delicate pride re∣strained
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
her; and she determined to avoid
the possibility of throwing herself in his
way, by forbearing to visit the gardens, for
several days.</P>
<P>When, after near a week, she again ven∣tured
thither, she made Annette her com∣panion,
and confined her walk to the lower
grounds, but often started as the leaves
rustled in the breeze, imagining, that some
person was among the thickets; and, at the
turn of every alley, she looked forward
with apprehensive expectation. She pur∣sued
her walk thoughtfully and silently,
for her agitation would not suffer her to
converse with Annette, to whom, however,
thought and silence were so intolerable, that
she did not scruple at length to talk to her
mistress.</P>
<P>"Dear madam," said she, "why do you
start so? one would think you knew what
has happened."</P>
<P>"What has happened?" said Emily, in
a faltering voice, and trying to command
her emotion.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="203"/>
"The night before last, you know, ma∣dam"—</P>
<P>"I know nothing, Annette," replied
her lady in a more hurried voice.</P>
<P>"The night before last, madam, there
was a robber in the garden."</P>
<P>"A robber!" said Emily, in an eager,
yet doubting tone.</P>
<P>"I suppose he was a robber, madam,
What else could he be?"</P>
<P>"Where did you see him, Annette?" re∣joined
Emily, looking round her, and
turning back towards the chateau.</P>
<P>"It was not I that saw him, madam,
it was Jean the gardener. It was twelve
o'clock at night, and, as he was coming
across the court to go the back way into
the house, what should he see—but some∣body
walking in the avenue, that fronts
the garden gate! So, with that, Jean guessed
how it was, and he went into the house for
his gun."</P>
<P>"His gun!" exclaimed Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, his gun; and then he
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
came out into the court to watch him.
Presently, he sees him come slowly down
the avenue, and lean over the garden gate,
and look up at the house for a long time;
and I warrant he examined it well, and set∣tled
what window he should break in at."</P>
<P>"But the gun," said Emily—"the
gun!"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, all in good time. Pre∣sently,
Jean says, the robber opened the
gate, and was coming into the court, and
then he thought proper to ask him his
business: so he called out again, and bade
him say who he was, and what he wanted.
But the man would do neither; but turned
upon his heel, and passed into the garden
again. Jean knew then well enough how
it was, and so he fired after him."</P>
<P>"Fired!" exclaimed Emily.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam, fired off his gun; but,
Holy Virgin! what makes you look so
pale, madam? The man was not killed,—I
dare say; but if he was, his comrades
carried him off: for, when Jean went in the
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
morning, to look for the body, it was gone,
and nothing to be seen but a track of blood
on the ground. Jean followed it, that he
might find out where the man got into
the garden, but it was lost in the grass,
and"—</P>
<P>Annette was interrupted: for Emily's
spirits died away, and she would have fal∣len
to the ground, if the girl had not
caught her, and supported her to a bench,
close to them.</P>
<P>When, after a long absence, her senses
returned, Emily desired to be led to her
apartment; and, though she trembled with
anxiety to enquire further on the subject
of her alarm, she found herself too ill at
present, to dare the intelligence which it
was possible she might receive of Valan∣court.
Having dismissed Annette, that she
might weep and think at liberty, she endea∣voured
to recollect the exact air of the per∣son,
whom she had seen on the terrace, and
still her fancy gave her the figure of Va∣lancourt.
She had, indeed, scarcely a
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
doubt, that it was he whom she had seen,
and at whom the gardener had fired: for
the manner of the latter person, as described
by Annette, was not that of a robber; nor
did it appear probable, that a robber would
have come alone, to break into a house so
spacious as this.</P>
<P>When Emily thought herself sufficiently
recovered, to listen to what Jean might
have to relate, she sent for him; but be
could inform her of no circumstance, that
might lead to a knowledge of the person,
who had been shot, or of the consequence
of the wound; and, after severely repri∣manding
him, for having fired with bullets,
and ordering diligent enquiry to be made
in the neighbourhood for the discovery of
the wounded person, she dismissed him,
and herself remained in the same state of
terrible suspense. All the tenderness she
had ever felt for Valancourt, was recalled
by the sense of his danger; and the more
she considered the subject, the more her
conviction strengthened, that it was he,
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
who had visited the gardens, for the pur∣pose
of soothing the misery of disappointed
affection, amidst the scenes of his former
happiness.</P>
<P>"Dear madam," said Annette, when
she returned, "I never saw you so affected
before! I dare say the man is not killed."</P>
<P>Emily shuddered, and lamented bitterly
the rashness of the gardener in having
fired;</P>
<P>"I knew you would be angry enough
about that, madam, or I should have told
you before; and he knew so too; for, says
he, "Annette, say nothing about this to my
lady. She lies on the other side of the
house, so did not hear the gun, perhaps;
but she would be angry with me, if she
knew, seeing there is blood. But then,"
says he, "how is one to keep the garden
clear, if one is afraid to fire at a robber,
when one sees him?"</P>
<P>"No more of this," said Emily, "pray
leave me."</P>
<P>Annette obeyed, and Emily returned to
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
the agonizing considerations, that had assail∣ed
her before, but which she, at length, en∣deavoured
to sooth by a new remark. If
the stranger was Valancourt, it was cer∣tain
he had come alone, and it appeared,
therefore, that he had been able to quit the
gardens, without assistance; a circumstance
which did not seem probable, had his wound
been dangerous. With this consideration,
she endeavoured to support herself, during
the enquiries, that were making by her
servants in the neighbourhood; but day
after day came, and still closed in uncer∣tainty,
concerning this affair; and Emily,
suffering in silence, at length, drooped,
and sunk under the pressure of her anx∣iety.
She was attacked by a slow fever,
and when she yielded to the persuation of
Annette to send for medical advice, the
physicians prescribed little beside air, gen∣tle
exercise and amusement: but how was
this last to be obtained? She, however,
endeavoured to abstract her thoughts from
the subject of her anxiety, by employing
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
them in promoting that happiness in others,
which she had loft herself; and, when the
evening was fine, she usually took an air∣ing,
including in her ride the cottages of
some of her tenants, on whose condition
she made such observations, as often en∣abled
her, unasked, to fulfil their wishes.</P>
<P>Her indisposition, and the business she
engaged in, relative to this estate, had al∣ready
protracted her slay at Tholouse,
beyond the period she had formerly fixed
for her departure to La Vallée; and now
she was unwilling to leave the only place,
where it seemed possible, that certainty
could be obtained on the subject of her
distress. But the time was come, when her
presence was necessary at La Vallée, a let∣ter
from the Lady Blanche now informing
her, that the Count and herself, being then
at the chateau of the Baron St. Foix, pur∣posed
to visit her at La Vallée, on their
way home, as soon as they should be in∣formed
of her arrival there. Blanche add∣ed,
that they made this visit, with the
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
hope of inducing her to return with them
to Chateau-le-Blanc.</P>
<P>Emily, having replied to the letter of her
friend, and said that she should be at La Val∣lée
in a few days, made hasty preparations
for the journey; and, in thus leaving Tho∣louse,
endeavoured to support herself with
a belief, that, if any fatal accident had hap∣pened
to Valancourt, she must in this in∣terval
have heard of it.</P>
<P>On the evening before her departure, she
went to take leave of the terrace and the
pavilion. The day had been sultry, but
a light shower, that fell just before sun-set,
had cooled the air, and given that soft ver∣dure
to the woods and pastures, which is so
refreshing to the eye; while the rain-drops,
still trembling on the shrubs, glittered in
the last yellow gleam, that lighted up the
scene, and the air was filled with fragrance,
exhaled by the late shower, from herbs and
flowers and from the earth itself. But the
lovely prospect, which Emily beheld from
the terrace, was no longer viewed by her
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
with delight; she sighed deeply as her eye
wandered over it, and her spirits were in a
state of such dejection, that she could not
think of her approaching return to La Val∣lée,
without tears, and seemed to mourn
again the death of her father, as if it had
been an event of yesterday. Having reach∣ed
the pavilion, she seated herself at the
open lattice, and, while her eyes settled on
the distant mountains, that overlooked Gas∣cony,
still gleaming on the horizon, though
the sun had now left the plains below,
"Alas!" said she, "I return to your long∣lost
scenes, but shall meet no more the pa∣rents,
that were wont to render them delight∣ful!—no
more shall see the smile of wel∣come,
or hear the well-known voice of
fondness:—all will now be cold and silent
in what was once my happy home."</P>
<P>Tears stole down her cheek, as the re∣membrance
of what that home had been,
returned to her; but, after indulging her
sorrow for some time, she checked it, ac∣cusing
herself of ingratitude in forgetting
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
the friends, that she possessed, while she
lamented those that were departed; and
she, at length, left the pavilion and the
terrace, without having observed a shadow
of Valancourt or of any other person.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the following morning, Emily left
Tholouse at an early hour, and reached La
Vallée about sun-set. With the melancholy
she experienced on the review of a place
which had been the residence of her parents,
and the scene of her earliest delight, was
mingled, after the first shock had subsided,
a tender and undescribable pleasure. For
time had so far blunted the acuteness of
her grief, that she now courted every scene,
that awakened the memory of her friends;
in every room, where she had been ac∣customed
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
to see them, they almost seemed
to live again; and she felt that La Vallée
was still her happiest home. One of the first
apartments she visited, was that, which had
been her father's library, and here she seated
herself in his arm-chair, and, while she con∣templated,
with tempered resignation, the
picture of past times, which her memory
gave, the tears she shed could scarcely be
called those of grief.</P>
<P>Soon after her arrival, she was surprised
by a visit from the venerable M. Barreaux,
who came impatiently to welcome the daugh∣ter
of his late respected neighbour, to her
long-deserted home. Emily was comforted
by the presence of an old friend, and they
passed an interesting hour in conversing of
former times, and in relating some of the
circumstances, that had occurred to each,
since they parted.</P>
<P>The evening was so far advanced, when
M. Barreaux left Emily, that she could not
visit the garden that night; but, on the fol∣lowing
morning, she traced its long-regretted
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
scenes with fond impatience; and, as she
walked beneath the groves, which her fa∣ther
had planted, and where she had so often
sauntered in affectionate conversation with
him, his countenance, his smile, even the
accents of his voice, returned with exactness
to her fancy, and her heart melted to the
tender recollections.</P>
<P>This, too, was his favourite season of the
year, at which they had often together ad∣mired
the rich and variegated tints of these
woods and the magical effect of autumnal
lights upon the mountains; and now, the
view of these circumstances made memory
eloquent. As she wandered pensively on,
she fancied the following address</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>TO AUTUMN.</HEAD>
<L>Sweet Autumn! how thy melancholy grace</L>
<L>Steals on my heart, as through these shades I wind!</L>
<L>Sooth'd by thy breathing sigh, I fondly trace</L>
<L>Each lonely image of the pensive mind!</L>
<L>Lov'd scenes, lov'd friends—long lost! around me rise,</L>
<L>And wake the melting thought, the tender tear!</L>
<L>That tear, that thought, which more than mirth I prize—</L>
<L>Sweet as the gradual tint, that paints thy year!</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="216"/>
Thy farewel smile, with fond regret, I view.</L>
<L>Thy beaming lights, soft gliding o'er the woods;</L>
<L>Thy distant landscape, touch'd with yellow hue</L>
<L>While falls the lengthen'd gleam; thy winding floods,</L>
<L>Now veil'd in shade, save where the skiff's white fails</L>
<L>Swell to the breeze, and catch thy streaming ray.</L>
<L>But now, e'en now!—the partial vision fails,</L>
<L>And the wave smiles, as sweeps the cloud away!</L>
<L>Emblem of life!—Thus checquer'd is its plan,</L>
<L>Thus joy succeeds to grief—thus smiles the varied man!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>One of Emily's earliest enquiries, after
her arrival at La Vallée, was concerning
Theresa, her father's old servant, whom it
may be remembered that M. Quesnel had
turned from the house when it was let, with∣out
any provision. Understanding that she
lived in a cottage at no great distance, Emily
walked thither, and, on approaching, was
pleased to see, that her habitation was plea∣santly
situated on a green slope, sheltered by
a tuft of oaks, and had an appearance of
comfort and extreme neatness. She found
the old woman within, picking vine-stalks,
who, on perceiving her young mistress, was
nearly overcome with joy.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="217"/>
"Ah! my dear young lady!" said she,
"I thought I should never see you again in
this world, when I heard you was gone
to that outlandish country. I have been
hardly used, since you went; I little thought
they would have turned me out of my old
master's family in my old age!"</P>
<P>Emily lamented the circumstance, and then
assured her, that she would make her latter
days comfortable, and expressed satisfaction,
on seeing her in so pleasant an habitation.</P>
<P>Theresa thanked her with tears, adding,
"Yes, mademoiselle, it is a very comfort∣able
home, thanks to the kind friend, who
took me out of my distress, when you was
too far off to help me, and placed me here!
I little thought!—but no more of that—"</P>
<P>"And who was this kind friend?" said.
Emily: "whoever it was, I shall consider
him as mine also."</P>
<P>"Ah mademoiselle! that friend forbad
me to blazon the good deed—I must not
say, who it was. But how you are altered
since I saw you last! You look so pale now,
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
and so thin, too; but then, there is my old
master's smile! Yes, that will never leave
you, any more than the goodness, that used
to make him smile. Alas-a-day! the poor
lost a friend indeed, when he died!"</P>
<P>Emily was affected by this mention of her
father, which Theresa observing, changed
the subject. "I heard, mademoiselle," said
she, "that Madame Cheron married a fo∣reign
gentleman, after all, and took you
abroad; how does she do?"</P>
<P>Emily now mentioned her death. "Alas!"
said Theresa, "if she had not been my ma∣ster's
sister, I should never have loved her;
she was always so cross. But how does that
dear young gentleman do, M. Valancourt?
he was an handsome youth, and a good one;
is he well, mademoiselle?"</P>
<P>Emily was much agitated.</P>
<P>"A blessing on him!" continued The∣resa
"Ah, my dear young lady, you need
not look so shy; I know all about it. Do
you think I do not know, that he loves
you? Why, when you was away, mademoi∣selle,
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
he used to come to the chateau, and
walk about it, so disconsolate! He would go
into every room in the lower part of the
house, and, sometimes, he would sit himself
down in a chair, with his arms across, and
his eyes on the floor, and there he would
sit, and think, and think, for the hour to∣gether.
He used to be very fond of the
south parlour, because I told him it used to
be yours; and there he would stay, look∣ing
at the pictures, which I said you drew,
and playing upon your lute, that hung up
by the window, and reading in your books,
till sun-set, and then he must go back to
his brother's chateau. And then—"</P>
<P>"It is enough, Theresa," said Emily.—"How
long have you lived in this cottage—and
how can I serve you? will you re∣main
here, or return and live with me?"</P>
<P>"Nay, mademoiselle!" said Theresa,
"do not be so shy to your poor old servant.
I am sure it is no disgrace to like such a
good young gentleman."</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="220"/>
A deep sigh escaped from Emily.</P>
<P>"Ah! how he did love to talk of you!
I loved him for that. Nay, for that matter,
he liked to hear me talk, for he did not say
much himself. But I soon found out what
he came to the chateau about. Then, he
would go into the garden, and down to
the terrace, and fit under that great tree
there, for the day together, with one of
your books in his hand; but he did not
read much, I fancy; for one day I hap∣pened
to go that way, and I heard some∣body
talking. Who can be here? says I: I
am sure I let nobody into the garden, but
the Chevalier! So I walked softly, to see
who it could be; and behold! it was the
Chevalier himself, talking to himself about
you. And he repeated your name, and
sighed so! and said he had lost you for
ever, for that you would never return for
him. I thought he was out in his reckon∣ing
there, but I said nothing, and stole
away."</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221"/>
"No more of this trifling," said Emily,
awakening from her reverie: "it displeases
me;"</P>
<P>"But, when M. Quesnel let the chateau,
I thought it would have broke the Cheva∣lier's
heart."</P>
<P>"Theresa," said Emily seriously, "you
must name the Chevalier no more!"</P>
<P>"Not name him, mademoiselle!" cried
Theresa: "what times are come up now?
Why, I love the Chevalier next to my old
master and you, mademoiselle."</P>
<P>"Perhaps your love was not well be∣stowed,
then," replied Emily, trying to con∣ceal
her tears; "but, however that might
be, we shall meet no more."</P>
<P>"Meet no more!—not well bestowed!"
exclaimed Theresa. "What do I hear?
No, mademoiselle, my love was well be∣stowed,
for it was the Chevalier Valan∣court,
who gave me this cottage, and has
supported me in my old age, ever since
M. Quesnel turned me from my master's
house."</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222"/>
"The Chevalier Valancourt!" said Emi∣ly,
trembling extremely.</P>
<P>"Yes, mademoiselle, he himself, though he
made me promise not to tell; but how could
one help, when one heard him ill spoken
of? Ah! dear young lady, you may well
weep, if you have behaved unkindly to
him, for a more tender heart than his never
young gentleman had. He found me out
in my distress, when you was too far off to
help me; and M. Quesnel refused to do so,
and bade me go to service again—Alas! I was
too old for that I—The Chevalier found
me, and bought me this cottage, and gave
me money to furnish it, and bade me seek
out another poor woman to live with me;
and he ordered his brother's steward to
pay me, every quarter, that which has sup∣ported
me in comfort. Think then, ma∣demoiselle,
whether I have not reason to
speak well of the Chevalier. And there
are others, who could have afforded it better
than he: and I am afraid he has hurt him∣self
by his generosity, for quarter day is
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
gone by long since, and no money for me!
But do not weep so, mademoiselle: you are
not sorry surely to hear of the poor Cheva∣lier's
goodness."</P>
<P>"Sorry!" said Emily, and wept the
more. "But how long is it since you have
seen him?"</P>
<P>"Not this many a day, mademoiselle."</P>
<P>"When did you hear of him?" enquired
Emily, wish increased emotion.</P>
<P>"Alas! never since he went away so
suddenly into Languedoc; and he was bur
just come from Paris then, or I should
have seen him; I am sure. Quarter day is
gone by long since, and, as I said, no
money for me; and I begin, to fear some
harm has happened to him: and if I was
not so far from Estuviere, and so lame,
I should have gone to enquire before this
time, and I have nobody to send so far."</P>
<P>Emily's anxiety, as to the fate of Va∣lancourt,
was now scarcely endurable,
and, since propriety would not suffer her
to send to the chateau of his brother, she
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
requested that Theresa would immediately
hire some person to go to his steward from
herself, and, when he asked for the quarter∣age
due to her, to make enquiries concern∣ing
Valancourt. But she first made The∣resa
promise never to mention her name in
this affair, or ever with that of the Cheva∣lier
Valancourt; and her former faithfulness
to M. St. Aubert induced Emily to confide
in her assurances. Theresa now joyfully
undertook to procure a person for this er∣rand,
and then Emily, after giving her a
sum of money to supply her with present
comforts, returned, with spirits heavily op∣pressed,
to her home, lamenting, more than
ever, that an heart, possessed of so much
benevolence as Valancourt's, should have
been contaminated by the vices of the
world, but affected by the delicate affec∣tion,
which his kindness to her old servant
expressed for herself.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MEANWHILE Count De-Villefort and
Lady Blanche had passed a pleasant fort∣night
at the chateau de St. Foix, with the
Baron and Baroness, during which they
made frequent excursions among the moun∣tains,
and were delighted with the romantic
wildness of Pyrenéan scenery. It was with
regret, that the Count bade adieu to his
old friends, although with the hope of being
soon united with them in one family; for it
was settled, that M. St. Foix, who now at∣tended
them into Gascony, should receive
the hand of the Lady Blanche, upon their
arrival at Chateau-le-Blanc. As the road,
from the Baron's residence to La Vallée, was
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
over some of the wildest tract of the Pyre∣nées,
and where a carriage-wheel had never
passed, the Count hired mules for himself
and his family, as well as a couple of stout
guides, who were well armed, informed of all
the passes of the mountains, and who boast∣ed,
too, that they were acquainted with every
brake and dingle in the way, could tell the
names of all the highest points of this chain
of Alps, knew every forest, that spread along
their narrow vallies, the shallowest part of
every torrent they must cross, and the exast
distance of every goat-herd's and hunter's
cabin they should have occasion to pass,—which
last article of learning required no
very capacious memory, for even such sim∣ple
inhabitants were but thinly scattered
over these wilds.</P>
<P>The Count left the chateau de St. Foix,
early in the morning, with an intention of
passing the night at a little inn upon the
mountains, about half way to La Vallée, of
which his guides had informed him; and,
though this was frequented chiefly by Spa∣nish
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
muleteers, on their route into France,
and, of course, would afford only sorry ac∣commodation,
the Count had no alterna∣tive,
for it was the only place like an inn,
on the road.</P>
<P>After a day of admiration and fatigue,
the travellers found themselves, about sun∣set,
in a woody valley, overlooked, on every
side, by abrupt heights. They had pro∣ceeded
for many leagues, without seeing a
human habitation, and had only heard, now
and then, at a distance, the melancholy
tinkling of a sheep-bell; but now they
caught the notes of merry music, and pre∣sently
saw, within a little green recess among
the rocks, a group of mountaineers, tripping
through a dance. The Count, who could
not look upon the happiness, any more than
on the misery of others, with indifference,
halted to enjoy this scene of simple plea∣sure.
The group before him consisted of
French and Spanish peasants, the inhabitants
of a neighbouring hamlet, some of whom
were performing a sprightly dance, the wo∣men
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
with castanets in their hands, to the
sounds of a lute and a tamborine, till, from
the brisk melody of France, the music
softened into a slow movement, to which
two female peasants danced a Spanish Pa∣van.</P>
<P>The Count, comparing this with the
scenes of such gaiety as he had witnessed at
Paris, where false taste painted the features,
and, while it vainly tried to supply the glow
of nature, concealed the charms of anima∣tion—where
affectation so often distorted the
air, and vice perverted the manners—sighed
to think, that natural graces and innocent
pleasures flourished in the wilds of solitude,
while they drooped amidst the concourse of
polished society. But the lengthening sha∣dows
reminded the travellers, that they had
no time to lose; and, leaving this joyous
group, they pursued their way towards the
little inn, which was to shelter them from
the night.</P>
<P>The rays of the setting sun now threw a
yellow gleam upon the forests of pine and
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
chesnut, that swept down the lower region
of the mountains, and gave resplendent tints
to the snowy points above. But soon, even
this light faded fast, and the scenery assumed
a more tremendous appearance, invested
with the obscurity o twilight. Where the
torrent had been seen, it was now only
heard; where the wild cliffs had displayed
every variety of form and attitude, a dark
mass of mountains now alone appeared;
and the vale, which far, far below had
opened its dreadful chasm, the eye could
no longer fathom. A melancholy gleam
still lingered on the summits of the highest
Alps, overlooking the deep repose of even∣ing,
and seeming to make the stillness of
the hour more awful.</P>
<P>Blanche viewed the scene in silence, and
listened with enthusiasm to the murmur of
the pines, that extended in dark lines along
the mountains, and to the faint voice of the
izard, among the rocks, that came at inter∣vals
on the air. But her enthusiasm sunk
into apprehension, when, as the shadows
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
deepened, she looked upon the doubtful
precipice, that bordered the road, as well
as on the various fantastic forms of dan∣ger,
that glimmered through the obscu∣rity
beyond it; and she asked her father, how
far they were from the inn, and whether he
did not consider the road to be dangerous
at this late hour. The Count repeated the
first question to the guides, who returned a
doubtful answer, adding, that, when it was
darker, it would be safest to rest, till the
moon rose. "It is scarcely safe to proceed
now," said the Count; but the guides, assur∣ing
him that there was no danger, went on.
Blanche, revived by this assurance, again in∣dulged
a pensive pleasure, as she watched the
progress of twilight gradually spreading its
tints over the woods and mountains, and
stealing from the eye every minuter feature
of the scene, till the grand outlines of na∣ture
alone remained. Then fell the silent
dews, and every wild flower, and aromatic
plant, that bloomed among the cliffs, breath∣ed
forth its sweetness; then, too, when the
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
mountain-bee had crept into its blossomed
bed, and the hum of every little infect, that
had floated gaily in the sun-beam, was
hushed, the found of many streams, not
heard till now, murmured at a distance.—The
bats alone, of all the animals inhabiting
this region, seemed awake; and, while they
slitted across the silent path, which Blanche
was pursuing, she remembered the follow∣ing
lines, which Emily had given her:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>TO THE BAT.</HEAD>
<L>From haunt of man, from day's obtrusive glare;</L>
<L>Thou shroud'st thee in the ruin's ivy'd tow'r,</L>
<L>Or in some shadowy glen's romantic bow'r,</L>
<L>Where wizard forme their mystic charms prepare,</L>
<L>Where Horror lurks, and ever-boding Care!</L>
<L>But, at the sweet and silent ev'ning hour,</L>
<L>When clos'd in sleep is ev'ry languid flow'r,</L>
<L>Thou lov'st to sport upon the twilight air,</L>
<L>Mocking the eye, that would thy course pursue,</L>
<L>In many a wanton-round, elastic, gay,</L>
<L>Thou flit'st athwart the pensive wand'rer's way,</L>
<L>As his lone footsteps print the mountain-dew.</L>
<L>From Indian isles thou com'st, with Summer's car,</L>
<L>Twilight thy love—thy guide her beaming star!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232"/>
To a warm imagination, the dubious
forms, that float, half veiled in darkness, af∣ford
a higher delight, than the most dis∣tinct
scenery, that the sun can shew. While
the fancy thus wanders over landscapes
partly of its own creation, a sweet compla∣cency
steals upon the mind, and</P>
<Q><L>Refines it all to subtlest feeling,</L>
<L>Bids the tear of rapture roll.</L></Q>
<P>The distant note of a torrent, the weak
trembling of the breeze among the woods,
or the far-off sound of a human voice, now
lost and heard again, are circumstances
which wonderfully heighten the enthusi∣astic
tone of the mind. The young St.
Foix, who saw the presentations of a servid
fancy, and felt whatever enthusiasm could
suggest, sometimes interrupted the silence,
which the rest of the party seemed by mu∣tual
consent to preserve, remarking and
pointing out to Blanche the most striking
effect of the hour upon the scenery; while
Blanche, whose apprehensions were, beguiled
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
by the conversation of her lover, yielded
to the taste so congenial to his, and they
conversed in a low restrained voice, the ef∣fect
of the pensive tranquillity, which twi∣light
and the scene inspired, rather than of
any fear, that they should be heard. Bur,
while the heart was thus soothed to ten∣derness,
St. Foix gradually mingled, with
his admiration of the country, a mention of
his affection; and he continued to speak,
and Blanche to listen till the mountains,
the woods, and the magical illusions of twi∣light
were remembered no more.</P>
<P>The shadows of evening soon shifted to
the gloom of night, which was somewhat
anticipated by the vapours, that, gathering
fast round the mountains, rolled in dark
wreaths along their sides; and the guides
proposed to rest, till the moon should rise,
adding, that they thought a storm was
coming on. As they looked round for a
spot, that might afford some kind of shelter,
an object was perceived obscurely through
the dusk, on a point of rock, a little way
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
down the mountain, which they imagined
to be a hunter's or a shepherd's cabin, and
the party, with cautious steps, proceeded
towards it. Their labour, however, was
not rewarded, or their apprehensions
soothed; for, on reaching the object of their
search, they discovered a monumental cross,
which marked the spot to have been pollut∣ed
by murder.</P>
<P>The darkness would not permit them to
read the inscription; but the guides knew
this to be a cross, raised to the memory of
a Count de Beliard, who had been mur∣dered
here by a horde of banditti, that had
infested this part of the Pyrenées, a few
years before; and the uncommon size of
the monument seemed to justify the suppo∣sition,
that it was erected for a person of
some distincion. Blanche shuddered, as
she listened to some horrid particulars of
the Count's fate, which one of the guides
related in a low, restrained tone, as if the
sound of his own voice frightened him;
but, while they lingered at the cross, at∣tending
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
to his narrative, a flash of light∣ning
glanced upon the rocks, thunder mut∣tered
at a distance, and the travellers, now
alarmed, quitted this scene of solitary hor∣ror,
in search of shelter.</P>
<P>Having regained their former track, the
guides, as they passed on, endeavoured to
interest the Count by various stories of
robbery, and even of murder, which had
been perpetrated in the very places they
must unavoidably pass, with accounts of
their own dauntless courage and wonder∣ful
escapes. The chief guide, or rather
he, who was the most completely armed,
drawing forth one of the four pistols, that
were tucked into his belt, swore, that it
had shot three robbers within the year. He
then brandished a clasp-knife of enormous
length, and was going to recount the won∣derful
execution it had done, when St,
Foix, perceiving, that Blanche was terri∣fied,
interrupted him. The Count, mean∣while,
secretly laughing at the terrible his∣tories
and extravagant boastings of the man,
<PB N="254" REF="236"/>
resolved to humour him, and, telling
Blanche in a whisper, his design, began
to recount some exploits of his own, which
infinitely exceeded any related by the
guide.</P>
<P>To these surprising circumstances he so
artfully gave the colouring of truth, that
the courage of the guides was visibly affect∣ed
by them, who continued silent, long af∣ter
the Count had ceased to speak. The
loquacity of the chief hero thus laid asleep,
the vigilance of his eyes and ears seemed
more thoroughly awakened, for he listened,
with much appearance of anxiety, to the
deep thunder, which murmured at inter∣vals,
and often paused, as the breeze, that
was now rising, rushed among the pines.
But, when he made a sudden halt before
a tuft of cork trees, that projected over
the road, and drew forth a pistol, before
he would venture to brave the banditti
which might lurk behind it, the Count
could no longer refrain from laughter.</P>
<P>Having now, however, arrived at a level
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
spot, somewhat sheltered from the air, by
overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch,
that rose over a precipice on the left, and
the guides being yet ignorant how far they
were from the inn, the travellers determined
to rest, till the moon should rise, or the
storm disperse. Blanche, recalled to a sense
of the present moment, looked on the sur∣rounding
gloom, with terror; but giving
her hand to St. Foix, she alighted, and the
whole party entered a kind of cave, if such
it could be called, which was only a shal∣low
cavity, formed by the curve of impend∣ing
rocks. A light being struck, a fire was
kindled, whose blaze afforded some degree
of cheerfulness and no small comfort, for,
though the day had been hot, the night air
of this mountainous region was chilling;
a fire was partly necessary also to keep off
the wolves, with which those wilds were
infested.</P>
<P>Provisions being spread upon a project∣tion
of the rock, the Count and his family
partook of a supper, which, in a scene less
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
rude, would, certainly have been thought
less excellent. When the repast was finish∣ed,
St. Foix, impatient for the moon,
sauntered along the precipice, to a point,
that fronted the east; but all was yet wrapt
in gloom, and the silence of night was
broken only by the murmuring of woods,
that waved far below, or by distant
thunder, and, now and then, by the faint
voices of the party he had quitted. He
viewed, with emotions of awful sublimity,
the long volumes of sulphureous clouds,
that floated along the upper and middle
regions of the air, and the lightnings that
flashed from them, sometimes silently, and,
at others, followed by sullen peals of thun∣der,
which the mountains feebly prolonged,
while the whole horizon, and the abyss, on
which he stood, were discovered in the mo∣mentary
light. Upon the succeeding dark∣ness,
the fire, which had been kindled in
the cave, threw a partial gleam, illumining
some points of the opposite rocks, and the
summits of pine-woods, that hung beetling
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
on the cliffs below, while their recesses
seemed to frown in deeper shade.</P>
<P>St. Foix stopped to observe the picture,
which the party in the cave presented,
where the elegant form of Blanche was
finely contrasted by the majestic figure of
the Count, who was seated by her on a
rude stone, and each was rendered more
impressive by the grotesque habits and
strong features of the guides and other at∣tendants,
who were in the back ground
of the piece. The effect of the light,
too, was interesting; on the surrounding
figures it threw a strong, though pale
gleam, and glittered on their bright arms;
while upon the foliage of a gigantic larch,
that impended its shade over the cliff above,
appeared a red, dusky tint, deepening almost
imperceptibly into the blackness of night.</P>
<P>While St. Foix contemplated the scene,
the moon, broad and yellow, rose over the
eastern summits, from among embattled
clouds, and shewed dimly the grandeur of
the heavens, the mass of vapours, that roll∣ed
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
half way down the precipice beneath,
and the doubtful mountains.</P>
<Q><L>What dreadful pleasure! there to stand sublime,</L>
<L>Like shipwreck'd mariner on desert coast,</L>
<L>And view th' enormous waste of vapour, tost</L>
<L>In billows length'ning to th' horizon round<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Minstrel.</NOTE>!</L></Q>
<P>From this romantic reverie he was awa∣kened
by the voices of the guides, repeat∣ing
his name, which was reverbed from
cliff to cliff, till an hundred tongues seemed
to call him; when he soon quieted the
fears of the Count and the Lady Blanche,
by returning to the cave. As the storm,
however, seemed approaching, they did not
quit their place of shelter; and the Count,
seated between his daughter and St. Foix,
endeavoured to divert the fears of the for∣mer,
and conversed on subjects, relating to
the natural history of the scene, among
which they wandered. He spoke of the
mineral and fossile substances, found in the
depths of these mountains,—the veins of
marble and granite, with which they
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
abounded, the strata of shells, discovered
near their summits, many thousand fathom
above the level of the sea, and at a vast dis∣tance
from its present shore;—of the tre∣mendous
chasms and caverns of the rocks,
the grotesque form of the mountains, and
the various phaenomena, that seem to stamp
upon the world the history of the deluge.
From the natural history he descended to
the mention of events and circumstances,
connected with the civil story of the Py∣renées;
named some of the most remark∣able
fortresses, which France and Spain
had erected in the passes of these moun∣tains;
and gave a brief account of some
celebrated sieges and encounters in early
times, when Ambition first frightened So∣litude
from these her deep recesses, made
her mountains, which before had echoed
only to the torrent's roar, tremble with the
clang of arms, and, when man's first foot∣steps
in her sacred haunts had left the
print of blood!</P>
<P>As Blanche sat, attentive to the narra∣tive,
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
that rendered the scenes doubly in∣teresting,
and resigned to solemn emotion,
while she considered, that she was on the
very ground, once polluted by these events,
her reverie was suddenly interrupted by a
sound, that came in the wind.—It was the
distant bark of a watch-dog. The travellers
listened with eager hope, and, as the wind
blew stronger, fancied, that the sound came
from no great distance; and, the guides hav∣ing
little doubt, that it proceeded from the
inn they were in search of, the Count deter∣mined
to pursue his way. The moon now
afforded a stronger, though still an uncertain
light, as she moved among broken clouds;
and the travellers, led by the sound, re-com∣menced
their journey along the brow of the
precipice, preceded by a single torch, that
now contended with the moon-light; for
the guides, believing they should reach
the inn soon after sun-set, had neglected to
provide more. In silent caution they fol∣lowed
the sound, which was heard but
at intervals, and which, after some time
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
entirely ceased. The guides endeavoured,
however, to point their course to the quarter,
whence it had issued, but the deep roaring of
a torrent soon seized their attention, and pre∣sently
they came to a tremendous chasm of
the mountain, which seemed to forbid all
further progress. Blanche alighted from
her mule, as did the Count and St. Foix,
while the guides traversed the edge in search
of a bridge, which, however rude, might
convey them to the opposite side, and they,
at length, confessed, what the Count had
begun to suspect, that they had been, for
some time, doubtful of their way, and were
now certain only, that they had lost it.</P>
<P>At a little distance, was discovered a
rude and dangerous passage, formed by an
enormous pine, which, thrown across the
chasm, united the opposite precipices, and
which had been felled probably by the hun∣ter,
to facilitate his chace of the izard, or
the wolf. The whole party, the guides ex∣cepted,
shuddered at the prospect of crossing
this alpine bridge, whose sides afforded no
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
kind of defence, and from which to fall was
to die. The guides, however, prepared to
lead over the mules, while Blanche stood
trembling on the brink, and listening to
the roar of the waters, which were seen
descending from rocks above, overhung
with lofty pines, and thence precipitating
themselves into the deep abyss, where their
white surges gleamed faintly in the moon∣light.
The poor animals proceeded over
this perilous bridge with instinctive caution,
neither frightened by the noise of the cata∣ract,
or deceived by the gloom, which the
impending foliage threw athwart their way.
It was now, that the solitary torch, which
had been hitherto of little service, was found
to be an inestimable treasure; and Blanche,
terrified, shrinking, but endeavouring to re∣collect
all her firmness and presence of mind,
preceded by her lover and supported by
her father, followed the red gleam of the
torch, in safety, to the opposite cliff.</P>
<P>As they went on, the heights contracted,
and formed a narrow pass, at the bottom of
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
which, the torrent they had just crossed, was
heard to thunder. But they were again
cheered by the bark of a dog, keeping
watch, perhaps, over the flocks of the
mountains, to protect them from the nightly
descent of the wolves. The sound was
much nearer than before, and, while they
rejoiced in the hope of soon reaching a
place of repose, a light was seen to glim∣mer
at a distance. It appeared at a height
considerably above the level of their path,
and was lost and seen again, as if the waving
branches of trees sometimes excluded and
then admitted its rays. The guides hal∣looed
with all their strength, but the sound
of no human voice was heard in return,
and, at length, as a more effectual means
of making themselves known, they fired a
pistol. But, while they listened in anxious
expectation, the noise of the explosion was
alone heard, echoing among the rocks, and
it gradually sunk into a silence, which no
friendly hint of man disturbed. The light,
however, that had been seen before, now
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
became plainer, and, soon after, voices were
heard indistinctly on the wind; but, upon
the guides repeating the call, the voices
suddenly ceased, and the light disappeared.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche was now almost sink∣ing
beneath the pressure of anxiety, fatigue
and apprehension, and the united efforts of
the Count and St. Foix could scarcely
support her spirits. As they continued to
advance, an object was perceived on a point
of rock above, which, the strong rays of the
moon then falling on it, appeared to be a
watch-tower. The Count, from its situation
and some other circumstances, had little
doubt, that it was such, and believing, that
the light had proceeded from thence, he en∣deavoured
to re-animate his daughter's spirits
by the near prospect of shelter and repose,
which, however rude the accommodation,
a ruined watch-tower might afford.</P>
<P>"Numerous watch-towers have been
erected among the Pyrenées," said the
Count, anxious only to call Blanche's atten∣tion
from the subject of her fears; "and
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
the method, by which they give intelligence
of the approach of the enemy, is, you know,
by fires, kindled on the summits of these
edifices. Signals have thus, sometimes, been
communicated from post to post, along a
frontier line of several hundred miles in
length. Then, as occasion may require,
the lurking armies emerge from their for∣tresses
and the forests, and march forth, to
defend, perhaps, the entrance of some
grand pass, where, planting themselves on
the heights, they assail their astonished ene∣mies,
who wind along the glen below, with
fragments of the shattered cliff, and pour
death and defeat upon them. The ancient
forts, and watch-towers, overlooking the
grand passes of the Pyrenées, are carefully
preserved; but some of those in inferior sta∣tions
have been suffered to fall into decay,
and are now frequently converted into the
more peaceful habitation of the hunter, or
the shepherd, who, after a day of toil, re∣tires
hither, and, with his faithful dogs, for∣gets,
near a cheerful blaze, the labour of the
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
chace, or the anxiety of collecting his wan∣dering
flocks, while he is sheltered from the
nightly storm."</P>
<P>"But are they always thus peacefully
inhabited?" said the Lady Blanche.</P>
<P>"No," replied the Count, "they are sometimes the asylum of French and Spa∣nish
smugglers, who cross the mountains
with contraband goods from their respec∣tive
countries, and the latter are parti∣cularly
numerous, against whom strong
parties of the king's troops are sometimes
sent. But the desperate resolution of these
adventurers, who, knowing, that, if they
are taken, they must expiate the breach of
the law by the most cruel death, travel in
large parties, well armed, often daunts the
courage of the soldiers. The smugglers,
who seek only safety, never engage, when
they can possibly avoid it; the military,
also, who know, that in these encounters,
danger is certain, and glory almost unattain∣able,
are equally reluctant to fight; an en∣gagement,
therefore, very seldom happens,
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
but, when it does, it never concludes till
after the most desperate and bloody conflict.
You are inattentive, Blanche," added the
Count: "I have wearied you with a dull
subject; but see, yonder, in the moon-light,
is the edifice we have been in search of,
and we are fortunate to be so near it, before
the storm bursts."</P>
<P>Blanche, looking up, perceived, that they
were at the foot of the cliff, on whose summit
the building stood, but no light now issued
from it; the barking of the dog too had,
for some time, ceased, and the guides began
to doubt, whether this was really the object
of their search. From the distance, at which
they surveyed it, shewn imperfectly by a
cloudy moon, it appeared to be of more ex∣tent
than a single watch-tower; but the
difficulty was how to ascend the height,
whose abrupt declivities seemed to afford
no kind of path-way.</P>
<P>While the guides carried forward the
torch to examine the cliff, the Count, re∣maining
with Blanche and St. Foix at its
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
foot, under the shadow of the woods, en∣deavoured
again to beguile the time by con∣versation,
but again anxiety abstracted the
mind of Blanche; and he then consulted,
apart with St. Foix, whether it would be
advisable, should a path be found, to ven∣ture
to an edifice, which might possibly
harbour banditti. They considered, that
their own party was not small, and that se∣veral
of them were well armed; and, after
enumerating the dangers, to be incurred by
passing the night in the open wild, exposed,
perhaps, to the effect of a thunder-storm,
there remained not a doubt, that they ought
to endeavour to obtain admittance to the
edifice above, at any hazard respecting the
inhabitants it might harbour; but the dark∣ness
and the dead silence, that surrounded it,
appeared to contradict the probability of its
being inhabited at all.</P>
<P>A shout from the guides aroused their at∣tention,
after which, in a few minutes, one
of the Count's servants returned with intelli∣gence,
that a path was found, and they im∣mediately
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
hastened to join the guides, when
they all ascended a little winding way cut
in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood,
and, after much toil and some danger,
reached the summit, where several ruined
towers, surrounded by a massy wall, rose
to their view, partially illumined by the
moon-light. The space around the building
was silent, and apparently forsaken, but the
Count was cautious; "Step softly," said
he, in a low voice, "while we reconnoiter
the edifice."</P>
<P>Having proceeded silently along for some
paces, they stopped at a gate, whose portals
were terrible even in ruins, and, after a mo∣ment's
hesitation, pasled on to the court of
entrance, but paused again at the head of a
terrace, which, branching from it, ran along
the brow of a precipice. Over this, rose the
main body of the edifice, which was now
seen to be, not a watch-tower, but one or
those ancient fortresses, that, from age and
neglect, had fallen to decay. Many parts
of it, however, appeared to be still entire;
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
it was built of grey stone, in the heavy
Saxon-gothic style, with enormous round
towers, buttresses of proportionable strength,
and the arch of the large gate, which seemed
to open into the hall of the fabric, was
round, as was that of a window above. The
air of solemnity, which must so strongly
have characterized the pile even in the days
of its early strength, was now considerably
heightened by its shattered battlements and
half-demolished walls, and by the huge
masses of ruin, scattered in its wide area,
now silent and grass grown. In this court
of entrance stood the gigantic remains of an
oak, that seemed to have flourished and de∣cayed
with the building, which it still ap∣peared
frowningly to protect by the few re∣maining
branches, leafless and moss-grown,
that crowned its trunk, and whose wide ex∣tent
told how enormous the tree had been in
a former age. This fortress was evidently
once of great strength, and, from its situa∣tion
on a point of rock, impending over a
deep glen, had been of great power to an∣noy,
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
as well as to resist; the Count, there∣fore,
as he stood surveying it, was somewhat
surprised, that it had been suffered, ancient
as it was, to sink into ruins, and its present
lonely and deserted air excited in his breast
emotions of melancholy awe. While he
indulged, for a moment, these emotions, he
thought he heard a sound of remote voices
steal upon the stillness, from within the
building, the front of which he again sur∣veyed
with scrutinizing eyes, but yet no light
was visible. He now determined to walk
round the fort, to that remote part of it,
whence he thought the voices had arisen,
that he might examine whether any light
could be discerned there, before he ventured
to knock at the gate; for this purpose,
he entered upon the terrace, where the re∣mains
of cannon were yet apparent in the
thick walls, but he had not proceeded
many paces, when his steps were suddenly
arrested by the loud barking of a dog
within, and which he fancied to be the same,
whose voice had been the means of bringing
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
the travellers thither. It now appeared cer∣tain,
that the place was inhabited, and the
Count returned to consult again with St.
Foix, whether he should try to obtain ad∣mittance,
for its wild aspect had somewhat
shaken his former resolution; but, after a
second consultation, he submitted to the con∣siderations,
which before determined him,
and which were strengthened by the disco∣very
of the dog, that guarded the fort,
as well as by the stillness that pervaded
it. He, therefore, ordered one of his ser∣vants
to knock at the gate, who was ad∣vancing
to obey him, when a light appeared
through the loop-hole of one of the towers,
and the Count called loudly, but, receiving
no answer, he went up to the gate himself,
and struck upon it with an iron-pointed pole,
which had assisted him to climb the steep.
When the echoes had ceased, that this blow
had awakened, the renewed barking,—and
there were now more than one dog,—was
the only sound, that was heard. The Count
stepped back, a few paces, to observe
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
whether the light was in the tower, and,
perceiving, that it was gone, he returned to
the portal, and had lifted the pole to
strike again, when again he fancied he heard
the murmur of voices within, and paused
to listen. He was confirmed in the supposi∣tion,
but they were too remote, to be heard
otherwise than in a murmur, and the Count
now let the pole fall heavily upon the gate;
when almost immediately a profound silence
followed. It was apparent, that the people
within had heard the sound, and their cau∣tion
in admitting strangers gave him a
favourable opinion of them. "They are
either hunters or shepherds," said he,
"who, like ourselves, have probably sought
shelter from the night within these walls,
and are fearful of admitting strangers, lest
they should prove robbers. I will endea∣vour
to remove their fears." So saying, he
called aloud, "We are friends, who ask
shelter from the night." In a few moments,
steps were heard within, which approached,
and a voice then enquired—"Who calls?"
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
"Friends," repeated the Count; "open
the gates, and you shall know more."—Strong
bolts were now heard to be un∣drawn,
and a man, armed with a hunting
spear, appeared. "What is it you want
at this hour?" said he. The Count beck∣oned
his attendants, and then, answered,
that he wished to enquire the way to the
nearest cabin. "Are you so little acquainted
with these mountains," said the man, "as
not to know, that there is none, within se∣veral
leagues? I cannot shew you the way;
you must seek it—there's a moon." Saying
this, he was closing the gate, and the Count
was turning away, half disappointed and
half afraid, when another voice was heard
from above, and, on looking up, he saw a
light, and a man's face, at the grate of the
portal. "Stay, friend, you have lost your
way?" said the voice. "You are hunters,
I suppose, like ourselves: I will be with
you presently." The voice ceased, and the
light disappeared. Blanche had been alarm∣ed
by the appearance of the man, who had
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
opened the gate, and she now entreated her
father to quit the place; but the Count
had observed the hunter's spear, which he
carried; and the words from the tower en∣couraged
him to await the event. The gate
was soon opened, and several men in hun∣ters'
habits, who had heard above what had
passed below, appeared, and, having listened
some time to the Count, told him he was
welcome to rest there for the night. They
then pressed him, with much courtesy, to
enter, and to partake of such fare as they
were about to sit down to. The Count,
who had observed them attentively while
they spoke, was cautious, and somewhat sus∣picious;
but he was also weary, fearful of
the approaching storm, and of encountering
alpine heights in the obscurity of night;
being likewise somewhat confident in the
strength and number of his attendants, he,
after some further consideration, determined
to accept the invitation. With this reso∣lution
he called his servants, who, advan∣cing
round the tower, behind which some of
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
them had silently listened to this conference,
followed their Lord, the Lady Blanche, and
St. Foix into the fortress. The strangers
led them on to a large and rude hall, par∣tially
seen by a fire, that blazed at its extre∣mity,
round which four men, in the hunter's
dress, were seated, and on the hearth were
several dogs stretched in sleep. In the
middle of the hall stood a large table, and
over the fire some part of an animal was
boiling. As the Count approached, the men
arose, and the dogs, half raising themselves,
looked fiercely at the strangers, but, on
hearing their masters' voices, kept their
postures on the hearth.</P>
<P>Blanche looked round this gloomy and spa∣cious
hall; then at the men, and to her father,
who, smiling cheerfully at her, addressed
himself to the hunters. "This is an hospi∣table
hearth," said he, "the blaze of a fire is
reviving after having wandered so long in
these dreary wilds. Your dogs are tired;
what success have you had?" "Such as we
usually have," replied one of the men, who
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
had been seated in the hall, "we kill our
game with tolerable certainty." "These
are fellow hunters," said one of the men who
had brought the Count hither, "that have
lost their way, and I have told them there is
room enough in the fort for us all." "Very
true, very true," replied his companion,
"What luck have you had in the chace,
brothers? We have killed two izards, and
that, you will say, is pretty well." "You
mistake, friend," said the Count, "we are
not hunters, but travellers; but, if you will
admit us to hunters' fare, we shall be well
contented, and will repay your kindness."
"Sit down then, brother," said one of the
men: "Jacques, lay more fuel on the fire,
the kid will soon be ready; bring a seat for
the lady too. Ma'amselle, will you taste
our brandy? it is true Barcelona, and as
bright as ever flowed from a keg." Blanche
timidly smiled, and was going to refuse,
when her father prevented her, by taking,
with a good humoured air, the glass offered
to his daughter; and Mons. St. Foix, who
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
was seated next her, pressed her hand, and
gave her an encouraging look, but her at∣tention
was engaged by a man, who sat
silently by the fire, observing St. Foix, with
a steady and earnest eye.</P>
<P>"You lead a jolly life here," said the
Count. "The life of a hunter is a pleasant
and a healthy one; and the repose is sweet,
which succeeds to your labour."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied one of his hosts, "our
life is pleasant enough. We live here only
during the summer, and autumnal months;
in winter, the place is dreary, and the
swoln torrents, that descend from the
heights, put a stop to the chace."</P>
<P>"'Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment,"
said the Count: "I should like to pass a
month in your way very well."</P>
<P>"We find employment for our guns
too," said a man who stood behind the
Count:" here are plenty of birds, of deli∣cious
flavour, that feed upon the wild thyme
and herbs, that grow in the vallies. Now
I think of it, there is a brace of bird's hung
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
up in the stone gallery; go fetch them,
Jacques, we will have them dressed."</P>
<P>The Count now made enquiry, concern∣ing
the method of pursuing the chace among
the rocks and precipices of these romantic
regions, and was listening to a curious de∣tail,
when a horn was sounded at the gate.
Blanche looked timidly at her father, who
continued to converse on the subjest of the
chace, but whose countenance was somewhat
expressive of anxiety, and who often turned
his eyes towards that part of the hall nearest
the gate. The horn founded again, and a
loud halloo succeeded. "These are some
of our companions, returned from their
day's labour," said a man, going lazily from
his seat towards the gate; and in a few mi∣nutes,
two men appeared, each with a gun
over his shoulder, and pistols in his belt.
"What cheer, my lads? what cheer?" said
they, as they approached. "What luck?"
returned their companions: "have you
brought home your supper? You shall have
none else."</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="262"/>
"Hah! who the devil have you brought
home?" said they in bad Spanish, on per∣ceiving
the Count's party, "are they from
France, or Spain?—where did you meet
with them?"</P>
<P>"They met with us, and a merry meet∣ing
too," replied his companion aloud in
good French. "This chevalier, and his
party, had lost their way, and asked a night's
lodging in the fort." The others made no
reply, but threw down a kind of knapsack,
and drew forth several brace of birds. The
bag sounded heavily as it fell to the ground,
and the glitter of some bright metal within
glanced on the eye of the Count, who now
surveyed, with a more enquiring look, the
man, that held the knapsack. He was a tall
robust figure, of a hard countenance, and
had short black hair, curling in his neck.
Instead of the hunter's dress, he wore a faded
military uniform; sandals were laced on
his broad legs, and a kind of short trowsers
hung from his waist. On his head he wore
a leathern cap, somewhat resembling in
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
shape an ancient Roman helmet; but the
brows that scowled beneath it, would have
characterized those of the barbarians, who
conquered Rome, rather than those of a
Roman soldier. The Count, at length,
turned away his eyes, and remained silent
and thoughtful, till, again raising them, he
perceived a figure standing in an obscure
part of the hall, fixed in attentive gaze on
St. Foix, who was conversing with Blanche,
and did not observe this; but the Count,
soon after, saw the same man looking over
the shoulder of the soldier as attentively at
himself. He withdrew his eye, when that
of the Count met it, who felt mistrust ga∣thering
fast upon his mind, but feared to
betray it in his countenance, and, forcing
his features to assume a smile, addressed
Blanche on some indifferent subject. When
he again looked round, he perceived, that
the soldier and his companion were gone.</P>
<P>The man, who was called Jacques, now
returned from the stone gallery. "A fire is
lighted there," said he, "and the birds are
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
dressing; the table too is spread there, for
that place is warmer than this."</P>
<P>His companions approved of the removal,
and invited their guests to follow to the
gallery, of whom Blanche appeared dis∣tressed,
and remained seated, and St. Foix
looked at the Count, who said, he pre∣ferred
the comfortable blaze of the fire he
was then near. The hunters, however,
commended the warmth of the other apart∣ment,
and pressed his removal with such
seeming courtesy, that the Count, half
doubting, and half fearful of betraying his
doubts, consented to go. The long and
ruinous passages, through which they went,
somewhat daunted him, but the thunder,
which now burst in loud peals above, made
it dangerous to quit this place of shelter,
and he forbore to provoke his conductors
by shewing that he distrusted them. The
hunters led the way, with a lamp; the
Count and St. Foix, who wished to please
their hosts by some instances of familiarity,
carried each a seat, and Blanche followed,
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
with faltering steps. As she passed on,
part of her dress caught on a nail in the
wall, and, while she stopped, somewhat
too scrupulously, to disengage it, the Count,
who was talking to St. Foix, and neither of
whom observed the circumstance, followed
their conductor round an abrupt angle of
the passage, and Blanche was left behind in
darkness. The thunder prevented them
from hearing her call, but, having disen∣gaged
her dress, she quickly followed, as she
thought, the way they had taken. A light,
that glimmered at a distance, confirmed
this belief, and she proceeded towards an
open door, whence it issued, conjecturing
the room beyond to be the stone gallery the
men had spoken of. Hearing voices as she
advanced, she paused within a few paces of
the chamber, that she might be certain
whether she was right, and from thence, by
the light of a lamp, that hung from the
ceiling, observed four men, seated round a
table, over which they leaned in apparent
consultation. In one of them she distin∣guished
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
the features of him, whom she had
observed, gazing at St. Foix, with such deep
attention; and who was now speaking in
an earnest, though restrained voice, till, one
of his companions seeming to oppose him,
they spoke together in a loud and harsher
tone. Blanche, alarmed by perceiving,
that neither her father, or St. Foix were
there, and terrified at the fierce countenances
and manners of these men, was turning has∣tily
from the chamber, to pursue her search
of the gallery, when she heard one of the
men say:</P>
<P>"Let all dispute end here. Who talks
of danger? Follow my advice, and there
will be none—secure <HI>them,</HI> and the rest are
an easy prey." Blanche, struck with these
words, paused a moment, to hear more.
"There is nothing to be got by the rest,"
said one of his companions, "I am never
for blood when I can help it—dispatch the
two others and our business is done; the
rest may go."</P>
<P>"May they so?" exclaimed the first ruffian,
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
with a tremendous oath—"What! To
tell how we have disposed of their masters,
and to send the king's troops to drag us to
the wheel! You was always a choice ad∣viser—I
warrant we have not yet forgot
St. Thomas's eve last year."</P>
<P>Blanche's heart now sunk with horror.
Her first impulse was to retreat from the
door, but, when she would have gone, her
trembling frame refused to support her, and,
having tottered a few paces, to a more ob∣scure
part of the passage, she was compelled
to listen to the dreadful councils of those,
who, she was no longer suffered to doubt,
were banditti. In the next moment, she
heard the following words, "Why you
would not murder the whole <HI>gang?</HI>"</P>
<P>"I warrant our lives are as good as theirs,"
replied his comrade. "If we don't kill them,
they will hang us: better they should die
than we be hanged."</P>
<P>"Better, better," cried his comrades.</P>
<P>"To commit murder, is a hopeful way of
<PB N="264" REF="268"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="266" REF="270"/>
of escaping the gallows!" said the first ruffian—"
many an honest fellow has run
his head into the noose that way, though."
There was a pause of some moments, dur∣ing
which they appeared to be considering.</P>
<P>"Confound those fellows," exclaimed
one of the robbers impatiently, "they
ought to have been here by this time; they
will come back presently with the old story,
and no booty: if they were here, our busi∣ness
would be plain and easy. I see we
shall not be able to do the business to∣night,
for our numbers are not equal to the
enemy, and in the morning they will be for
marching off, and how can we detain them
without force?"</P>
<P>"I have been thinking of a scheme, that
will do," said one of his comrades: "if we
can dispatch the two chevaliers silently, it
will be easy to master the rest."</P>
<P>"That's a plausible scheme, in good
faith," said another with a smile of scorn—"If
I can eat my way through the prison
wall, I shall be at liberty!—How can we
dispatch them <HI>silently?"</HI></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="271"/>
"By poison," replied his companions.</P>
<P>"Well said! that will do," said the se∣cond
ruffian, "that will give a lingering
death too, and satisfy my revenge. These
barons shall take care how they again tempt
our vengeance."</P>
<P>"I knew the son, the moment I saw
him," said the man, whom Blanche had ob∣served
gazing on St. Foix, "though he
does not know me; the father I had almost
forgotten."</P>
<P>"Well, you may say what you will,"
said the third ruffian, "but I don't believe
he is the Baron, and I am as likely to know
as any of you, for I was one of them, that
attacked him, with our brave lads, that suffered."</P>
<P>"And was not I another?" said the first
ruffian, "I tell you he is the Baron; but
what does it signify whether he is or not?—shall
we let all this booty go out of our
hands? It is not often we have such luck as
this. While we run the chance of the
wheel for smuggling a few pounds of to∣bacco,
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>
to cheat the king's manufactory, and
of breaking our necks down the precipices
in the chace of our food; and, now and
then, rob a brother smuggler, or a strag∣gling
pilgrim, of what scarcely repays us
the powder we fire at them, shall we let such
a prize as this go? Why they have enough
about them to keep us for—"</P>
<P>"I am not for that, I am not for that,"
replied the third robber, "let us make the
most of them: only, if this is the Baron, I
should like to have a flash the more at him,
for the sake of our brave comrades, that he
brought to the gallows."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, slash as much as you will,"
rejoined the first man, "but I tell you the
Baron is a taller man."</P>
<P>"Confound your quibbling," said the
second ruffian, "shall we let them go or
not? If we stay here much longer, they
will take the hint, and march off without
our leave. Let them be who they will,
they are rich, or why all those servants?
Did you see the ring, he, you call the Baron,
<PB N="269" REF="273"/>
had on his finger?—it was diamond; but
he has not got it on now: he saw me look∣ing
at it, I warrant, and took it off."</P>
<P>"Aye, and then there is the picture; did
you see that? She has not taken that off,"
observed the first ruffian, "it hangs at her
neck; if it had not sparkled so, I should not
have found it out, for it was almost hid by
her dress; those are diamonds too, and a
rare many of them there must be, to go
round such a large picture."</P>
<P>"But how are we to manage this busi∣ness?"
said the second ruffian: "let us talk
of that, there is no fear of there being
booty enough, but how are we to secure
it?"</P>
<P>"Aye, aye," said his comrades, "let us
talk of that, and remember no time is to be
lost."</P>
<P>"I am still for poison," observed the
third, "but consider their number; why
there are nine or ten of them, and armed too;
when I saw so many at the gate, I was not
<PB N="270" REF="274"/>
for letting them in, you know, nor you
either."</P>
<P>"I thought they might be some of our
enemies," replied the second, "I did not so
much mind numbers."</P>
<P>"But you must mind them now," re∣joined
his comrade, "or it will be worse
for you. We are not more than six, and
how can we master ten by open force? I
tell you we must give some of them a dose,
and the rest may then be managed."</P>
<P>"I'll tell you a better way," rejoined the
other impatiently, "draw closer."</P>
<P>Blanche, who had listened to this conver∣sation,
in an agony, which it would be im∣possible
to describe, could no longer distin∣guish
what was said, for the ruffians now
spoke in lowered voices; but the hope, that
she might save her friends from the plot, if
she could find her way quickly to them,
suddenly re-animated her spirits, and lent
her strength enough to turn her steps in
search of the gallery. Terror, however,
<PB N="271" REF="275"/>
and darkness conspired against her, and, hav∣ing
moved a few yards, the feeble light, that
issued from the chamber, no longer even
contended with the gloom, and, her foot
stumbling over a step that crossed the pas∣sage,
she fell to the ground.</P>
<P>The noise startled the banditti, who be∣came
suddenly silent, and then all rushed to
the passage, to examine whether any person
was there, who might have overheard their
councils, Blanche saw them approaching,
and perceived their fierce and eager looks:
but, before she could raise herself, they dis∣covered
and seized her, and, as they dragged
her towards the chamber they had quitted,
her screams drew from them horrible threat∣enings.</P>
<P>Having reached the room, they began to
consult what they should do with her. "Let
us first know what she has heard," said the
chief robber. "How long have you been in
the passage, lady, and what brought you
there?"</P>
<P>"Let us first secure that picture," said
<PB N="272" REF="276"/>
one of his comrades, approaching the trem∣bling
Blanche. "Fair lady, by your leave
that picture is mine; come, surrender it, or
I shall seize it."</P>
<P>Blanche, entreating their mercy, imme∣diately
gave up the miniature, while another
of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her,
concerning what she had overheard of their
conversation, when, her confusion and terror
too plainly telling what her tongue feared
to confess, the ruffians looked expressively
upon one another, and two of them with∣drew
to a remote part of the room, as if
to consult further.</P>
<P>"These are diamonds, by St. Peter!"
exclaimed the fellow, who had been exa∣mining
the miniature, "and here is a very
pretty picture too, faith; as handsome a
young chevalier, as you would wish to see
by a summer's sun. Lady, this is your
spouse, I warrant, for it is the spark, that
was in your company just now."</P>
<P>Blanche, sinking with terror, conjured
him to have pity on her, and, delivering
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
him her purse, promised to say nothing of
what had passed, if he would suffer her to
return to her friends.</P>
<P>He smiled ironically, and was going to
reply, when his attention was called off by
a distant noise; and, while he listened, he
grasped the arm of Blanche more firmly, as
if he feared she would escape from him, and
she again shrieked for help.</P>
<P>The approaching sounds called the ruf∣fians
from the other part of the chamber.
"We are betrayed," said they; "but let
us listen a moment, perhaps it is only our
comrades come in from the mountains, and
if so, our work is sure; listen!"</P>
<P>A distant discharge of shot confirmed this
supposition for a moment, but, in the next,
the former sounds drawing nearer, the clash∣ing
of swords, mingled with the voices of
loud contention and with heavy groans,
were distinguished in the avenue leading to
the chamber. While the ruffians prepared
their arms, they heard themselves called by
some of their comrades afar off, and then a
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
shrill horn was sounded without the for∣tress,
a signal, it appeared, they too well un∣derstood;
for three of them, leaving the
Lady Blanche to the care of the fourth,
instantly rushed from the chamber.</P>
<P>While Blanche, trembling, and nearly
fainting, was supplicating for release, she
heard amid the tumult, that approached, the
voice of St. Foix, and she had scarcely re∣newed
her shriek, when the door of the room
was thrown open, and he appeared, much
disfigured with blood, and pursued by se∣veral
ruffians. Blanche neither saw, or heard
any more; her head swam, her sight failed,
and she became senseless in the arms of the
robber, who had detained her.</P>
<P>When she recovered, she perceived, by
the gloomy light, that trembled round
her, that she was in the same chamber,
but neither the Count, St. Foix, or any
other person appeared, and she continued,
for some time, entirely still, and nearly in
a state of stupefaction. But, the dreadful
images of the past returning, she endea∣voured
<PB N="275" REF="279"/>
to raise herself, that she might seek
her friends, when a sullen groan, at a little
distance, reminded her of St. Foix, and of
the condition, in which she had seen him
enter this room; then, starting from the
floor, by a sudden effort of horror, she ad∣vanced
to the place whence the sound had
proceeded, where a body was lying stretched
upon the pavement, and where, by the glim∣mering
light of a lamp, she discovered the
pale and disfigured countenance of St. Foix.
Her horrors at that moment, may be easily
imagined. He was speechless; his eyes
were half closed, and, on the hand, which
she grasped in the agony of despair, cold
damps had settled. While she vainly re∣peated
his name, and called for assistance,
steps approached, and a person entered the
chamber, who, she soon perceived, was
not the Count, her father; but, what was
her astonishment, when, supplicating him
to give his assistance to St. Foix, she dis∣covered
Ludovico! He scarcely paused to
recognise her, but immediately bound up
<PB N="276" REF="280"/>
the wounds of the Chevalier, and, perceive∣ing,
that he had fainted probably from loss
of blood, ran for water; but he had been
absent only a few moments, when Blanche
heard other steps approaching, and, while
she was almost frantic with apprehen∣sion
of the ruffians, the light of a torch
flashed upon the walls, and then Count De
Villefort appeared, with an affrighted coun∣tenance,
and breathless with impatience,
calling upon his daughter. At the sound of
his voice, she rose, and ran to his arms,
while he letting fall the bloody sword he
held, pressed her to his bosom in a transport
of gratitude and joy, and then hastily en∣quired
for St. Foix, who now gave some
signs of life. Ludovico soon after returning
with water and brandy, the former was ap∣plied
to his lips, and the latter to his tem∣ples
and hands, and Blanche, at length, saw
him unclose his eyes, and then heard him
enquire for her; but the joy she felt, on
this occasion, was interrupted by new
alarms, when Ludovico said it would be
<PB N="277" REF="281"/>
necessary to remove Mons. St. Foix imme∣diately,
and added, "The banditti, that
are out, my Lord, were expected home, an
hour ago, and they will certainly find us, if
we delay. That shrill horn, they know,
is never sounded by their comrades but on
most desperate occasions, and it echoes
among the mountains for many leagues
round. I have known them brought home
by its sound even from the Pied de Meli∣cant.
Is any body standing watch at the
great gate, my Lord?"</P>
<P>"Nobody," replied the Count; "the
rest of my people are now scattered
about, I scarcely know where. Go, Lu∣dovico,
collect them together, and look
out yourself, and listen if you hear the feet
of mules."</P>
<P>Ludovico then hurried away, and the
Count consulted as to the means of re∣moving
St. Foix, who could not have
borne the motion of a mule, even if his
strength would have supported him in the
saddle.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="282"/>
While the Count was telling, that the ban∣ditti,
whom they had found in the fort, were
secured in the dungeon, Blanche observed
that he was himself wounded, and that his
left arm was entirely useless; but he smiled
at her anxiety, assuring her the wound was
trifling.</P>
<P>The Count's servants, except two who
kept watch at the gate, now appeared, and,
soon after, Ludovico. "I think I hear
mules coming along the glen, my Lord,"
said he, "but the roaring of the torrent be∣low
will not let me be certain; however, I
have brought what will serve the Chevalier,"
he added, shewing a bear's skin, fastened to
a couple of long poles, which had been
adapted for the purpose of bringing home such
of the banditti as happened to be wounded
in their encounters. Ludovico spread it
on the ground, and, placing the skins of
several goats upon it, made a kind of bed,
into which the Chevalier, who was however
now much revived, was gently lifted; and,
the poles being raised upon the shoulders of
<PB N="279" REF="283"/>
the guides, whose footing among these steeps
could best be depended upon, he was borne
along with an easy motion. Some of the
Count's servants were also wounded—but
not materially, and, their wounds being
bound up, they now followed to the great
gate. As they passed along the hall, a loud
tumult was heard at some distance, and
Blanche was terrified. "It is only those
villains in the dungeon, my Lady," said
Ludovico. "They seem to be bursting it
open," said the Count. "No, my Lord,"
replied Ludovico, "it has an iron door;
we have nothing to fear from them; but
let me go first, and look out
from the rampart."</P>
<P>They quickly followed him, and found
their mules browsing before the gates, where
the party listened anxiously, but heard no
sound, except that of the torrent below and
of the early breeze, sighing among the
branches of the old oak, that grew in the
court; and they were now glad to perceive
the first tints of dawn over the mountain∣tops.
<PB N="280" REF="284"/>
When they had mounted their mules,
Ludovico, undertaking to be their guide,
led them by an easier path, than that by
which they had formerly ascended, into the
glen. "We must avoid that valley to the
east, my Lord," said he, "or we may meet
the banditti; they went out that way in the
morning."</P>
<P>The travellers, soon after, quitted this
glen, and found themselves in a narrow valley
that stretched towards the north-west. The
morning light upon the mountains now
strengthened fast, and gradually discovered
the green hillocks, that skirted the winding
feet of the cliffs, tufted with cork tree,
and ever-green oak. The thunder-clouds
being dispersed, had left the sky perfectly
serene, and Blanche was revived by the fresh
breeze, and by the view of verdure, which
the late rain had brightened. Soon after,
the sun arose, when the dripping rocks,
with, the shrubs. that fringed their summits,
and many a turfy slope below, sparkled in
his rays. A wreath of mist was seen, float∣ing
<PB N="281" REF="285"/>
along the extremity of the valley, but
the gale bore it before the travellers, and
the sun-beams gradually drew it up towards
the summit of the mountains. They had
proceeded about a league, when, St. Foix
having complained of extreme faintness,
they stopped to give him refreshment, and,
that the men, who bore him, might rest.
Ludovico had brought from the fort some
flasks of rich Spanish wine, which now
proved a reviving cordial not only to St.
Foix but to the whole party, though to him
it gave only temporary relief, for it fed the
fever, that burned in his veins, and he could
neither disguise in his countenance the an∣guish
he suffered, or suppress the wish, that
he was arrived at the inn, where they had
designed to pass the preceding night.</P>
<P>While they thus reposed themselves under
the shade of the dark green pines, the Count
desired Ludovico to explain shortly, by what
means he had disappeared from the north
apartment, how he came into the hands of
the banditti, and how he had contributed
<PB N="282" REF="286"/>
so essentially to serve him and his family,
for to him he justly attributed their present
deliverance. Ludovico was going to obey
him, when suddenly they heard the echo of
a pistol-shot, from the way they had passed,
and they rose in alarm, hastily to pursue
their route.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Ah why did Fate his steps decoy</L>
<L>In stormy paths to roam,</L>
<L>Remote from all congenial joy!</L></Q>
<BIBL>BEATTIE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EMILY, mean while, was still suffering
anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt; but
Theresa, having, at length, found a person,
whom she could entrust on her errand to the
steward, informed her, that the messenger
would return on the following day; and
Emily promised to be at the cottage,
Theresa being too lame to attend her.</P>
<P>In the evening, therefore, Emily set out
alone for the cottage, with a melancholy
foreboding, concerning Valancourt, while,
perhaps, the gloom of the hour might con∣tribute
to depress her spirits. It was a grey
autumnal evening towards the close of the
season; heavy mists partially obscured the
mountains, and a chilling breeze, that sigh∣ed
<PB N="284" REF="288"/>
among the beech woods, strewed her path
with some of their last yellow leaves. These,
circling in the blast and foretelling the
death of the year, gave an image of desola∣tion
to her mind, and, in her fancy, seemed
to announce the death of Valancourt. Of
this she had, indeed, more than once so
strong a presentiment, that she was on the
point of returning home, feeling herself un∣equal
to an encounter with the certainty she
anticipated, but, contending with her emo∣tions,
she so far commanded them, as to be
able to proceed.</P>
<P>While she walked mournfully on, gazing
on the long volumes, of vapour, that poured
upon the sky and watching the swallows,
tossed along the wind, now disappearing
among tempestuous clouds, and then emerg∣ing,
for a moment, in circles upon the
calmer air, the afflictions and vicissitudes of
her late life seemed pourtrayed in these
fleeting images;—thus had she been tossed
upon the stormy sea of misfortune for the
last year, with but short intervals of peace,
<PB N="285" REF="289"/>
if peace that could be called, which was
only the delay of evils. And now, when
she had escaped from so many dangers, was
become independent of the will of those,
who had oppressed her, and found herself
mistress of a large fortune, now, when she
might reasonably have expected happiness,
she perceived that she was as distant from it
as ever. She would have accused herself of
weakness and ingratitude in thus suffering a
sense of the various blessings she possessed to
be overcome by that of a single misfortune,
had this misfortune affected herself alone;
but, when she had wept for Valancourt
even as living, tears of compassion had
mingled with those of regret, and while she
lamented a human being degraded to vice,
and consequently to misery, reason and hu∣manity
claimed these tears, and fortitude
had not yet taught her to separate them
from those of love; in the present moments,
however, it was not the certainty of his
guilt, but the apprehension of his death
(of a death also, to which she herself, how∣ever
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
innocently, appeared to have been in
some degree instrumental) that oppressed
her. This fear increased, as the means of
certainty concerning it approached; and,
when she came within view of Theresa's
cottage, she was so much disordered, and
her resolution failed her so entirely, that,
unable to proceed, she rested on a bank,
beside her path; where, as she fat, the
wind that groaned sullenly among the lofty
branches above, seemed to her melancholy
imagination to bear the founds of distant la∣mentation,
and, in the pauses of the gust,
she still fancied she heard the feeble and far-off
notes of distress. Attention convinced
her, that this was no more than fancy; but
the increasing gloom, which seemed the sud∣den
close of day, soon warned her to depart,
and, with faltering steps, she again moved
toward the cottage. Through the casement
appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire,
and Theresa, who had observed Emily ap∣proaching,
was already at the door to re∣ceive
her.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="291"/>
"It is a cold evening, madam," said
she, "storms are coming on, and I thought
you would like a fire. Do take this chair
by the hearth."</P>
<P>Emily, thanking her for this consideration,
sat down, and then, looking in her face,
on which the wood fire threw a gleam, she
was struck with its expression, and, unable
to speak, sunk back in her chair with a
countenance so full of woe, that Theresa
instantly comprehended the occasion of it,
but she remained silent. "Ah!" said Emi∣ly,
at length, "it is unnecessary for me to
ask the result of your enquiry, your silence,
and that look, sufficiently explain it;—he
is dead!"</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear young lady," replied
Theresa, while tears filled her eyes, "this
world is made up of trouble! the rich have
their share as well as the poor! But we
must all endeavour to bear what Heaven
pleases."</P>
<P>"He is dead then!"—interrupted Emily—"Valancourt
is dead!"</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="292"/>
"A-well-a-day! I fear he is," replied
Theresa.</P>
<P>"You fear!" said Emily, "do you only
fear?"</P>
<P>"Alas! yes, Madam, I fear he is!
neither the steward, or any of the Epourville
family, have heard of him since he left
Languedoc, and the Count is in great afflic∣tion
about him, for he says he was always
punctual in writing, but that now he has
not received a line from him, since he left
Languedoc; he appointed to be at home,
three weeks ago, but he has neither come,
or written, and they fear some accident has
befallen him. Alas! that ever I should
live to cry for his death! I am old, and
might have died without being missed, but
he"—Emily was faint, and asked for
some water, and Theresa, alarmed by the
voice, in which she spoke, hastened to her
assistance, and, while she held the water to
Emily's lips, continued, "My dear young
mistress do not take it so to heart; the
<PB N="289" REF="293"/>
Chevalier may be alive and well, for all this;
let us hope the best!"</P>
<P>"O no! I cannot hope," said Emily,
"I am acquainted with circumstances, that
will not suffer me to hope. I am some∣what
better now, and can hear what you
have to say. Tell me, I entreat, the parti∣culars
of what you know."</P>
<P>"Stay till you are a little better, made-moiselle,
you look sadly!"</P>
<P>"O no, Theresa, tell me all, while I have
the power to hear it," said Emily, "tell
me all, I conjure you!"</P>
<P>"Well, madam, I will then; but the
steward did not say much, for Richard says
he seemed shy of talking about Mons. Va∣lancourt,
and what he gathered was from
Gabriel, one of the servants, who said he
had heard it from my lord's gentleman."</P>
<P>"What did he hear?" said Emily.</P>
<P>"Why, madam, Richard has but a bad
memory, and could not remember half of
it, and, if I had not asked him a great
many questions, I should have; heard little
<PB N="290" REF="294"/>
indeed. But he says that Gabriel said,
that he and all the other servants were in
great trouble about M. Valancourt, for
that he was such a kind young gentleman,
they all loved him, as well as if he had
been their own brother—and now, to think
what was become of him! For he used to
be so courteous to them all, and, if any of
them had been in fault, M. Valancourt
was the first to persuade my lord to forgive
them. And then, if any poor family was
in distress, M. Valancourt was the first, too,
to relieve them, though some folks, not a
great way off, could have afforded that
much better than he. And then, said Ga∣briel,
he was so gentle to every body, and,
for all he had such a noble look with him,
he never would command, and call about
him, as some of your quality people do,
and we never minded him the less for that.
Nay, says Gabriel, for that matter, we
minded him the more, and would all have
run to obey him at a word, sooner than if
some folks had told us what to do at full
<PB N="291" REF="295"/>
length; aye, and were more afraid of dis∣pleasing
him, too, than of them, that used
rough words to us."</P>
<P>Emily, who no longer considered it to
be dangerous to Men to praise, bestowed
on Valancourt, did not attempt to interrupt
Theresa, but sat, attentive to her words,
though almost overwhelmed with grief.
"My Lord," continued Theresa, "frets
about M. Valancourt sadly, and the more,
because, they say, he had been rather harsh
against him lately. Gabriel says he had it
from my Lord's valet, that M. Valancourt
had <HI>comported</HI> himself wildly at Paris, and
had spent a great deal of money, more a
great deal than my Lord liked, for he loves
money better than M. Valancourt, who had
been led astray sadly. Nay, for that mat∣ter,
M. Valancourt had been put into pri∣son
at Paris, and my Lord, says Gabriel,
refused to take him out, and said he de∣served
to suffer; and, when old Gregoire,
the butler, heard of this, he actually bought
a walking-stick to take with him to Paris,
<PB N="292" REF="296"/>
to visit his young master; but the next
thing we hear is, that M. Valancourt is
coming home. O, it was a joyful day
when he came; but he was sadly altered,
and my Lord looked very cool upon him,
and he was very sad, indeed. And, soon
after, he went away again into Languedoc,
and, since that time, we have never seen
him."</P>
<P>Theresa paused, and Emily, sighing deep∣ly,
remained with her eyes fixed upon the
floor, without speaking. After a long
pause, she enquired what further Theresa
had heard. "Yet why should I ask?" she
added; "what you have already told is
too much. O Valancourt! thou art gone—forever
gone! and I—I have murdered
thee!" These words, and the countenance
of despair which accompanied them, alarmed
Theresa, who began to fear, that the shock
of the intelligence Emily had just received,
had affected her senses. "My dear young
lady, be composed," said she, "and do not
say such frightful words. You murder
<PB N="293" REF="297"/>
M. Valancourt,—dear heart!" Emily re∣plied
only by a heavy sigh.</P>
<P>"Dear lady, it breaks my heart to see
you look so," said Theresa, "do not sit
with your eyes upon the ground, and all
so pale and melancholy; it frightens me to
see you." Emily was still silent, and did,
not appear to hear any thing that was said
to her. "Besides, mademoiselle," con∣tinued.
Theresa, "M. Valancourt may be alive
and merry yet, for what we know."</P>
<P>At the mention of his name, Emily
raised her eyes, and fixed them, in a wild
gaze, upon Theresa, as if she was endea∣vouring
to understand what had been said.
"Aye, my dear lady," said Theresa, mis∣taking
the meaning of this considerate air,
"M. Valancourt may be alive and merry
yet."</P>
<P>On the repetition of these words, Emily
comprehended their import, but, instead of
producing the effect intended, they seemed
only to heighten her distress. She rose has∣tily
from her chair, paced the little room,
<PB N="294" REF="298"/>
with quick steps, and, often sighing deep∣ly,
clasped her hands, and shuddered.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Theresa, with simple, but
honest affection, endeavoured to comfort
her; put more wood on the fire, stirred it
up into a brighter blaze, swept the hearth,
set the chair, which Emily had left, in a
warmer situation, and then drew forth from
a cupboard a flask of wine. "It is a
stormy night, madam," said she, "and
blows cold—do come nearer the fire, and
take a glass of this wine; it will comfort
you, as it has done me, often and often, for
it is not such wine as one gets every day;
it is rich Languedoc, and the last of six
flasks that M. Valancourt sent me, the
night before he left Gascony for Paris.
They have served me, ever since, as cor∣dials,
and I never drink it, but I think of
him, and what kind words he said to me
when he gave them. Theresa, says he, you
are not young now, and should have a glass
of good wine, now and then. I will send
you a few flasks, and, when you taste them,
<PB N="295" REF="299"/>
you will sometimes remember me your
friend. Yes—those were his very words—me
your friend!" Emily still paced the
room, without feeming to hear what The∣resa
said, who continued speaking. "And
I have remembered him, often enough,
poor young gentleman!—for he gave me
this roof for a shelter, and that, which has
supported me. Ah! he is in heaven, with
my blessed matter, if ever saint was!"</P>
<P>Theresa's voice faltered; she wept, and
set down the flask, unable to pour out the
wine. Her grief seemed to recall Emily
from her own, who went towards her, but
then stopped, and, having gazed on her,
for a moment, turned suddenly away, as if
overwhelmed by the reflection, that it was
Valancourt, whom Theresa lamented.</P>
<P>While she yet paced the room, the still,
soft note of an oboe, or flute, was heard min∣gling
with the blast, the sweetness of which
affected Emily's spirits; she paused a mo∣ment
in attention; the tender tones, as
they swelled along the wind, till they were
<PB N="296" REF="300"/>
lost again in the ruder gust, came with a
plaintiveness, that touched her heart, and the
melted into tears.</P>
<P>"Aye," said Theresa, drying her eyes,
"there is Richard, our neighbour's son,
playing on the oboe; it is sad enough, to
hear such sweet music now." Emily con∣tinued
to weep, without replying. "He
often plays of an evening," added Theresa,
"and, sometimes, the young folks dance to
the sound of his oboe. But, dear young lady!
do not cry so; and pray take a glass of this
wine," continued she, pouring some into a
glass, and handing it to Emily, who reluc∣tantly
took it.</P>
<P>"Taste it for M. Valancourt's sake,"
said Theresa, as Emily lifted the glass to
her lips, "for he gave it me, you know,
madam." Emily's hand trembled, and she
spilt the wine as she withdrew it from her
lips. "For whose sake!—who gave the
wine?" said she in a faltering voice. "M.
Valancourt, dear lady. I knew you would
be pleased with it. It is the last flask I
have left."</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="301"/>
Emily set the wine upon the table, and
burst into tears, while Theresa, disappointed
and alarmed, tried to comfort her; but she
only waved her hand, entreated she might
be left alone, and wept the more.</P>
<P>A knock at the cottage door prevented
Theresa from immediately obeying her mis∣tress,
and she was going to open it, when
Emily, checking her, requested she would
not admit any person; but, afterwards, recol∣lecting,
that she had ordered her servant to
attend her home, she said it was only Phi∣lippe,
and endeavoured to restrain her tears,
while Theresa opened the door.</P>
<P>A voice, that spoke without, drew Emi∣ly's
attention. She listened, turned her eyes
to the door, when a person now appeared,
and immediately a bright gleam, that flashed
from the fire, discovered—Valancourt!</P>
<P>Emily, on perceiving him, started from
her chair, trembled, and, sinking into it
again, became insensible to all around her.</P>
<P>A scream from Theresa now told, that she
knew Valancourt, whom her imperfect sight,
<PB N="298" REF="302"/>
and the duskiness of the place had prevented
her from immediately recollecting; but his
attention was immediately called from her
to the person, whom he saw, falling from a
chair near the fire; and, hastening to her
assistance,—he perceived, that he was sup∣porting
Emily! The various emotions, that
seized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting
with her, from whom he had believed he
had parted for ever, and on beholding her
pale and lifeless in his arms—may, per∣haps,
be imagined, though they could nei∣ther
be then expressed, or now described,
any more than Emily's sensations, when, at
length, she unclosed her eyes, and, looking
up, again saw Valancourt. The intense an∣xiety,
with which he regarded her, was in∣stantly
changed to an expression of mingled
joy and tenderness, as his eye met hers, and
he perceived, that she was reviving. But
he could only exclaim, "Emily!" as he
silently watched her recovery, while she
averted her eye, and feebly attempted to
withdraw her hand; but, in these the first
<PB N="299" REF="303"/>
moments, which succeeded to the pangs
his supposed death had occasioned her,
she forgot every fault, which had formerly
claimed indignation, and beholding Valan∣court
such as he appeared, when he won her
early affection, she experienced emotions of
only tenderness and joy▪ This, alas! was
but the sunshine of a few short moments;
recollections rose, like clouds, upon her
mind, and, darkening the illusive image,
that possessed it, she again beheld Valan∣court,
degraded—Valancourt unworthy of
the esteem and tenderness she had once be∣stowed
upon him; her spirits faltered, and,
withdrawing her hand, she turned from
him to conceal her grief, while he, yet
more embarrassed and agitated, remained
silent.</P>
<P>A sense of what she owed to herself re∣strained
her tears, and taught her soon to
overcome, in some degree, the emotions of
mingled joy and sorrow, that contended at
her heart, as she rose, and, having thanked
him for the assistance he had given her, bade
<PB N="300" REF="304"/>
Theresa good evening. As she was leaving
the cottage, Valancourt, who seemed sud∣denly
awakened as from a dream, entreated,
in a voice, that pleaded powerfully for com∣passion,
a few moments attention. Emily's
heart, perhaps, pleaded as powerfully, but
she had resolution enough to resist both,
together with the clamorous entreaties of
Theresa, that she would not venture home
alone in the dark, and had already opened
the cottage door, when the pelting storm
compelled her to obey their requests.</P>
<P>Silent and embarrassed, she returned to
the fire, while Valancourt, with increasing
agitation, paced the room, as if he wished,
yet feared, to speak, and Theresa expressed
without restraint her joy and wonder upon
seeing him.</P>
<P>"Dear heart! sir," said she, "I never
was so surprised and overjoyed in my life.
We were in great tribulation before you
came, for we thought you was dead, and
were talking, and lamenting about you, just
when you knocked at the door. My young
<PB N="301" REF="305"/>
mistress there was crying, fit to break her
heart—"</P>
<P>Emily looked with much displeasure at
Theresa, but, before she could speak, Va∣lancourt,
unable to repress the emotion,
which Theresa's imprudent discovery occa∣sioned,
exclaimed, "O my Emily! am I
then still dear to you! Did you, indeed,
honour me with a thought—a tear? O
heavens! you weep—you weep now!"</P>
<P>"Theresa, sir," said Emily, with a re∣served
air, and trying to conquer her tears,
"has reason to remember you with grati∣tude,
and she was concerned, because she
had not lately heard of you. Allow me to
thank you for the kindness you have shewn
her, and to say, that, since I am now upon
the spot, she must not be further indebted
to you."</P>
<P>"Emily!" said Valancourt, no longer
master of his emotions, "is it thus you
meet him, whom once you meant to honour
with your hand—thus you meet him, who
has loved you—suffered for you?—Yet what
<PB N="302" REF="306"/>
do I say? Pardon me, pardon me, made∣moiselle
St. Aubert, I know not what I ut∣ter.
I have no longer any claim upon your
Remembrance—I have forfeited every pre∣tension
to your esteem, your love. Yes!
let me not forget, that I once possessed your
affections, though to know that I have lost
them, is my severest affiction. Affliction—do
I call it!—that is a term of mildness."</P>
<P>"Dear heart!" said Theresa, preventing
Emily from replying, "talk of once having
her affections! Why, my dear young lady
loves you now, better than she does any
body in the whole world, though she pre∣tends
to deny it."</P>
<P>"This is insupportable!" said Emily;
"Theresa, you know not what you say. Sir,
if you respect my tranquillity, you will spare
me from the continuance of this distress."</P>
<P>"I do respect your tranquillity too much,
voluntarily to interrupt it," replied Valan∣court,
in whose bosom pride now contended
with tenderness; "and will not be a volun∣tary
intruder. I would have entreated a few
<PB N="303" REF="307"/>
moments attention—yet I know not for
what purpose. You have ceased to esteem
me, and to recount to you my sufferings
will degrade me more, without exciting even
your pity. Yet I have been, O Emily! I
am indeed very wretched!" added Valan∣court,
in a voice, that softened from solem∣nity
into grief.</P>
<P>"What! is my dear young master going
out in all this rain!" said Theresa. "No, he
shall not stir a step. Dear! dear! to fee
how gentlefolks can afford to throw away
their happiness! Now, if you were poor
people, there would be none of this. To
talk of unworthiness, and not caring about
one another, when I know there are not
such a kind-hearted lady and gentleman in
the whole province, nor any that love one
another half so well, if the truth was spoken!"</P>
<P>Emily, in extreme vexation, now rose
from her chair, "I must be gone," said she,
"the storm is over."</P>
<P>"Stay, Emily, stay, mademoiselle St. Au∣bert!"
<PB N="304" REF="308"/>
said Valancourt, summoning all his
resolution, "I will no longer distress you
by my presence. Forgive me, that I did
not sooner obey you, and, if you can, some∣times,
pity one, who, in losing you—has
lost all hope of peace! May you be happy,
Emily, however wretched I remain, happy
as my fondest wish would have you!"</P>
<P>His voice faltered with the last words,
and his countenance changed, while, with
a look of ineffable tenderness and grief, he
gazed upon her for an instant, and then
quitted the cottage.</P>
<P>"Dear heart! dear heart!" cried The∣resa,
following him to the door, "why,
Monsieur Valancourt! how it rains! What
a night is this to turn him out in! Why it
will give him his death; and it was but now
you was crying, mademoiselle, because he
was dead. Well! young ladies do change
their mind in a minute, as one may say!"</P>
<P>Emily made no reply, for she heard not
what was said, while, lost in sorrow and
thought, she remained in her chair by the
<PB N="305" REF="309"/>
fire, with her eyes fixed, and the image of
Valancourt still before them.</P>
<P>"M. Valancourt is sadly altered! Ma∣dam,"
said Theresa; "he looks so thin to
what he used to do, and so melancholy, and
then he wears his arm in a sling."</P>
<P>Emily raised her eyes at these words, for
she had not observed this last circumstance,
and she now did not doubt, that Valancourt
had received the shot of her gardener at Tho∣louse;
with this conviction her pity for him
returning, she blamed herself for having oc∣casioned
him to leave the cottage, during the
storm.</P>
<P>Soon after her servants arrived with the
carriage, and Emily, having censured The∣resa
for her thoughtless conversation to Va∣lancourt,
and strictly charging her never to
repeat any hints of the same kind to him,
withdrew to her home, thoughtful and dis∣consolate.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Valancourt had returned to a
little inn of the village, whither he had
arrived only a few moments before his
visit to Theresa's cottage, on the way
<PB N="306" REF="310"/>
from Tholouse to the chateau of the Count
de Duvarney, where he had not been since
he bade adieu to Emily at Chateau-le-Blanc,
in the neighbourhood of which he
had lingered for a considerable time, un∣able
to summon resolution enough to quit
a place, that contained the object most
dear to his heart. There were times, in∣deed,
when grief and despair urged him to
appear again before Emily, and, regard∣less
of his ruined circumstances, to renew his
suit. Pride, however, and the tenderness
of his affection, which could not long en∣dure
the thought of involving her in his mis∣fortunes,
at length, so far triumphed over
passion, that he relinquished this desperate
design, and quitted Chateau-le-Blanc. But
still his fancy wandered among the scenes,
which had witnessed his early love, and, on
his way to Gascony, he stopped at Tholouse,
where he remained when Emily arrived, con∣cealing,
yet indulging his melancholy in the
gardens, where he had formerly passed with her
so many happy hours; often recurring, with
<PB N="307" REF="311"/>
vain regret, to the evening before her de∣parture
for Italy, when she had so unex∣pectedly
met him on the terrace, and endea∣vouring
to recall to his memory every word
and look, which had then charmed him, the
arguments he had employed to dissuade her
from the journey, and the tenderness of their
last farewel. In such melancholy recollec∣tions
he had been indulging, when Emily
unexpectedly appeared to him on this very
terrace, the evening after her arrival at Tho∣louse.
His emotions, on thus seeing her,
can scarcely be imagined; but he so far
overcame the first promptings of love, that
he forbore to discover himself, and abruptly
quitted the gardens. Still, however, the vi∣sion
he had seen haunted his mind; he be∣came
more wretched than before, and the
only solace of his sorrow was to return in
the silence or the night; to follow the
paths which he believed her steps had press∣ed,
during the day; and, to watch round
the habitation where she reposed. It
was in one of these mournful wanderings,
<PB N="308" REF="312"/>
that he had received by the fire of the
gardener, who mistook him for a robber, a
wound in his arm, which had detained
him at Tholouse till very lately, under the
hands of a surgeon. There, regardless of
himself and careless of his friends, whose
late unkindness had urged him to believe,
that they were indifferent as to his fate, he
remained, without informing them of his
situation; and now, being sufficiently reco∣vered
to bear traveling, he had taken La
Vallée in his way to Estuviere, the Count's
residence, partly for the purpose of hearing
of Emily, and of being again near her, and
partly for that of enquiring into the situation
of poor old Theresa, who, he had reason to
suppose, had been deprived of her stipend,
small as it was, and which enquiry had
brought him to her cottage, when Emily
happened to be there.</P>
<P>This unexpected interview, which had at
once shewn him the tenderness of her love
and the strength of her resolution, renewed
all the acuteness of the despair, that had at∣tended
<PB N="309" REF="313"/>
their former separation, and which
no effort of reason could teach him, in these
moments, to subdue. Her image, her look,
the tones of her voice, all dwelt on his
fancy, as powerfully as they had lately ap∣peared
to his senses, and banished from his
heart every emotion, except those of love
and despair.</P>
<P>Before the evening concluded, he returned
to Theresa's cottage, that he might hear her
talk of Emily, and be in the place, where
she had so lately been. The joy, felt and
expressed by that faithful servant, was
quickly changed to sorrow, when she ob∣served,
at one moment, his wild and phren∣sied
look, and, at another, the dark melan∣choly,
that overhung him.</P>
<P>After he had listened, and for a consi∣derable
time, to all she had to relate, con∣cerning
Emily, he gave Theresa nearly all
the money he had about him, though she
repeatedly refused it, declaring, that her
mistress had amply supplied her wants; and
then, drawing a ring of value from his sin∣ger,
<PB N="310" REF="314"/>
he delivered it her with a solemn charge
to present it to Emily, of whom he entreat∣ed,
as a last favour, that she would pre∣serve
it for his sake, and sometimes, when
she looked upon it, remember the unhappy
giver.</P>
<P>Theresa wept, as she received the ring,
but it was more from sympathy, than from
any presentiment of evil; and before she
could reply, Valancourt abruptly left the
cottage. She followed him to the door,
calling upon his name and entreating him to
return; but she received no answer, and
saw him no more.</P>

<P>On the following morning, as Emily sat
in the parlour adjoining the library, reflect∣ing
on the scene of the preceding night,
Annette rushed wildly into the room, and,
without speaking, sunk breathless into a
chair. It was some time before she could
answer the anxious enquiries of Emily, as to
the occasion of her emotion, but, at length,
she exclaimed, "I have seen his ghost, ma∣dam,
I have seen his ghost!"</P>
<P>"Who do you mean?" said Emily, with
extreme impatience.</P>
<P>"It came, in from the hall, madam," con∣tinued
Annette, "as I was crossing to the
parlour."</P>
<P>"Who are you speaking of?" repeated
Emily, "Who came in from the hall?"</P>
<PB N="310" REF="316"/>

<PB N="311" REF="317"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<P><PB N="312" REF="318"/>
"It was dressed just as I have seen him,
often and often," added Annette. "Ah!
who could have thought—"</P>
<P>Emily's patience was now exhausted, and
she was reprimanding her for such idle
fancies, when a servant entered the room,
and informed her, that a stranger without
begged leave to speak with her.</P>
<P>It immediately occurred to Emily, that
this stranger was Valancourt, and she told
the servant to inform him, that she was en∣gaged,
and could not see any person.</P>
<P>The servant, having delivered his message,
returned with one from the stranger, urging
the first request, and saying, that he had
something of consequence to communicate;
while Annette, who had hitherto sat▪ silent
and amazed, now started up, and crying,
"It is Ludovico!—it is Ludovico!" ran
out of the room. Emily bade the servant
follow her, and, if it really was Ludovico,
to shew him into the parlour.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Ludovico appeared, ac∣companied
by Annette, who, as joy rendered
<PB N="313" REF="319"/>
her forgetful of all rules of decorum towards
her mistress, would not suffer any person to
be heard, for some time, but herself. Emily
expressed surprise and satisfaction, on seeing
Ludovico in safety, and the first emotions
increased, when he delivered letters from
Count De Villefort and the Lady Blanche,
informing her of their late adventure, and of
their present situation at an inn among the
Pyrenées, where they had been detained by
the illness of Mons. St. Foix, and the indis∣position
of Blanche, who added, that the
Baron St. Foix was just arrived to attend
his son to his chateau, where he would re∣main
till the perfect recovery of his wounds,
and then return to Languedoc, but that her
father and herself purposed to be at La
Vallée, on the following day. She added,
that Emily's presence would be expected at
the approaching nuptials, and begged she
would be prepared to proceed, in a few days,
to Chateau-le-Blanc. For an account of
Ludovico's adventure, she referred her to
himself; and Emily, though much inter∣ested,
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
concerning the means, by which he
had disappeared from the north apartments,
had the forbearance to suspend the gratifi∣cation
of her curiosity, till he had taken
some refreshment, and had conversed with
Annette, whose joy, on seeing him in safety,
could not have been more extravagant, had
he arisen from the grave.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Emily perused again the let∣ters
of her friends, whose expressions of es∣teem
and kindness were very necessary con∣solations
to her heart, awakened as it was
by the late interview to emotions of keener
sorrow and regret.</P>
<P>The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc was
pressed with so much kindness by the Count
and his daughter, who strengthened it by a
message from the Countess, and the occa∣sion
of it was so important to her friend,
that Emily could not refuse to accept it,
nor, though she wished to remain in the
quiet shades of her native home, could she
avoid perceiving the impropriety of remain∣ing
there alone, since Valancourt was again
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>
in the neighbourhood. Sometimes, too, shw
thought, that change of scenery and the so∣ciety
of her friends might contribute, more
than retirement, to restore her to tranquil∣lity.</P>
<P>When Ludovico again appeared, she de∣sired
him to give a detail of his adventure
in the north apartments, and to tell by what
means he became a companion of the ban∣ditti,
with whom the Count had found him.</P>
<P>He immediately obeyed, while Annette,
who had not yet had leisure to ask him
many questions, on the subject, prepared
to listen, with a countenance of extreme cu∣riosity,
venturing to remind her lady of her
incredulity, concerning spirits, in the castle
of Udolpho, and of her own sagacity in
believing in them; while Emily, blushing
at the consciousness of her late credulity,
observed, that, if Ludovico's adventure
could justify Annette's supperstition, he had
probably not been, here to relate it.</P>
<P>Ludovico smiled at Annette, and bowed
to Emily, and then began as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="322"/>
"You may remember, madam, that, on
the night, when I sat up in the north cham∣ber,
my lord, the Count, and Mons. Henri
accompanied me thither, and that, while
they remained there, nothing happened to
excite any alarm. When they were gone I
made a fire in the bed-room, and, not being
inclined to sleep, I sat down on the hearth
with a book I had brought with me to di∣vert
my mind. I confess I did sometimes
look round the chamber, with something
like apprehension—"</P>
<P>"O very like it, I dare say," interrupted
Annette, "and I dare say too, if the truth
was known, you shook from head to foot."</P>
<P>"Not quite so bad as that," replied Lu∣dovico,
smiling, "but several times, as the
wind whistled round the castle, and shook
the old casements, I did fancy I heard odd
noises, and, once or twice, I got up and
looked about me; but nothing was to be
seen, except the grim figures in the tapestry,
which seemed to frown upon me, as I
looked at them. I had fat thus for above
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>
an hour," continued Ludovico, "when
again I thought I heard a noise, and glanced
my eyes round the room, to discover what
it came from, but, not perceiving any thing,
I began to read again, and, when I had
finished the story I was upon, I felt drowsy,
and dropped asleep. But presently I was
awakened by the noise I had heard before,
and it seemed to come from that part of the
chamber, where the bed stood; and then,
whether it was the story I had been reading
that affected my spirits, or the strange re∣ports,
that had been spread of these apart∣ments,
I don't know, but, when I looked
towards the bed again, I fancied I saw a
man's face within the dusky curtains."</P>
<P>At the mention of this, Emily trembled,
and looked anxiously, remembering the
spectacle she had herself witnessed there with Dorothée.</P>
<P>"I confess, madam, my heart did fail
me, at that instant," continued Ludovico,
"but a return of the noise drew my atten∣tion
<PB N="318" REF="324"/>
from the bed, and I then distinctly
heard a sound, like that of a key, turning
in a lock, but what surprised me more was,
that I saw no door where the sound seemed
to come from. In the next moment, how∣ever,
the arras near the bed was slowly
lifted, and a person appeared behind it, en∣tering
from a small door in the wall. He
stood for a moment as if half retreating,
with his head bending under the arras which
concealed the upper part of his face except
his eyes scowling beneath the tapestry as he
held it; and then, while he raised it higher,
I saw the face of another man behind, look∣ing
over his shoulder. I know not how it
was, but, though my sword was upon the
table before me, I had not the power just
then to seize it, but sat quite still, watching
them, with my eyes half shut as if I was
asleep. I suppose they thought me so, and
were debating what they should do, for I
heard them whisper, and they stood in the
same posture for the value of a minute, and
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>
then, I thought I perceived other faces in
the duskiness beyond the door, and heard
louder whispers."</P>
<P>"This door surprifes me," said Emily,
"because I understood, that the Count
had caused the arras to be lifted, and the
walls examined, suspecting, that they might
have concealed a passage through which
you had departed."</P>
<P>"It does not appear so extraordinary to
me, madam," replied Ludovico, "that this
door should escape notice, because it was
formed in a narrow compartment, which
appeared to be part of the outward wall,
and, if the Count had not passed over it,
he might have thought it was useless to
search for a door where it seemed as if no
passage could communicate, with one; but
the truth was, that the passage was formed
within the wall itself.—But, to return to
the men, whom I saw obscurely beyond
the door, and who did not suffer me to re∣main
long in suspense, concerning their de∣sign.
They all rushed into the room, and
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>
surrounded me, though not before I had
snatched up my sword to defend myself.
But what could one man do against four?
They soon disarmed me, and, having fast∣ened
my arms, and gagged my mouth,
forced me through the private door, leav∣ing
my sword upon the table, to assist, as
they said, those who should come in the
morning to look for me, in fighting against
the ghosts. They then led me through
many narrow passages, cut, as I fancied,
in the walls, for I had never seen them be∣fore,
and down several flights of steps, till
we came to the vaults underneath the cas∣tle;
and then opening a stone door, which
I should have taken for the wall itself, we
went through a long passage, and down
other steps cut in the solid rock, when
another door delivered us into a cave. Af∣ter
turning and twining about, for some
time, we reached the mouth of it, and I
found myself on the sea-beach at the foot
of the cliffs, with the chateau above. A
boat was in waiting, into which the rus∣sians
<PB N="321" REF="327"/>
got, forcing me along with them, and
we soon reached a small vessel, that was at
anchor, where other men appeared, when
setting me aboard, two of the fellows who
had seized me, followed, and the other two
rowed back to the shore, while we set fail.
I soon found out what all this meant, and
what was the business of these men at the
chateau. We landed in Rousillon, and,
after lingering several days about the shore,
some of their comrades came down from
the mountains, and carried me with them
to the fort, where I remained till my Lord
so unexpectedly arrived, for they had taken
good care to prevent my running away,
having blindfolded me, during the journey,
and, if they had not done this, I think I
never could have found my road to any
town, through the wild country we tra∣versed.
After I reached the fort I was
watched like a prisoner, and never suffered
to go out, without two or three compa∣nions,
and I became so weary of life, that I
often wished to get rid of it."</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="328"/>
"Well, but they let you talk," said An∣nette,
"they did not gagg you after they
got you away from the chateau, so I don't
see what reason there was to be so very
weary of living; to say nothing about the
chance you had of feeing me again."</P>
<P>Ludovico smiled, and Emily also, who
enquired what was the motive of these men
for carrying him off.</P>
<P>"I soon found out, madam," resumed Lu∣dovico,
"that they were pirates, who had,
during many years, secreted their spoil in
the vaults of the castle, which, being so
near the sea, suited their purpose well. To
prevent detection they had tried to have it
believed, that the chateau was haunted, and,
having discovered the private way to the
north apartments, which had been shut
up ever since the death of the lady mar∣chioness,
they easily succeeded. The house-keeper
and her husband, who were the
only persons, that had inhabited the castle,
for some years, were so terrified by the
strange noises they heard in the nights, that
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
they would live there no longer; a report
soon went abroad, that it was haunted, and
the whole country believed this the more
readily, I suppose, because it had been said,
that the lady marchioness had died in a
strange way, and because my lord never
would return to the place afterwards."</P>
<P>"But why," said Emily, "were not these
pirates contented with the cave—why did
they think it necessary to deposit their spoil
in the castle?"</P>
<P>"The cave, madam," replied Ludovico,
"was open to any body, and their treasures
would not long have remained undiscovered
there, but in the vaults they were secure so
long as the report prevailed of their being
haunted. Thus then, it appears, that they
brought at midnight, the spoil they took on
the seas, and kept it till they had oppor∣tunities
of disposing of it to advantage.
The pirates were connected with Spanish
smugglers and banditti, who live among the
wilds of the Pyrenées, and carry on various
kinds of traffic, such as nobody would think
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
of; and with this desperate horde of ban∣ditti
I remained, till my lord arrived. I shall
never forget what I felt, when I first dis∣covered
him—I almost gave him up for
lost! but I knew, that, if I shewed myself,
the banditti would discover who he was,
and probably murder us all, to prevent
their secret in the chateau being detected. I,
therefore, kept out of my lord's sight, but
had a strict watch upon the russians, and
determined, if they offered him or his fa∣mily
violence, to discover myself, and fight
for our lives. Soon after, I overheard
some of them laying a most diabolical plan
for the murder and plunder of the whole
party, when I contrived to speak to some of
my lord's attendants, telling them what was
going forward, and we consulted what was
best to be done; meanwhile my lord,
alarmed at the absence of the Lady Blanche,
demanded her, and the russians having
given some unsatisfactory answer, my lord
and Mons. St. Foix became furious, so
then we thought it a good time to discover
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
the plot, and rushing into the chamber, I
called out "Treachery! my lord count, de∣fend
yourself!" His lordship and the
chevalier drew their swords directly, and a
hard battle we had, but we conquered at
last, as, madam, you are already informed
of by my Lord Count."</P>
<P>"This is an extraordinary adventure,"
said Emily, and much praise is due, Ludo∣vico,
to your prudence and intrepidity.
There are some cifcumstances, however,
concerning the north apartments, which still
perplex me; but, perhaps, you may be able
to explain them. Did you ever hear the
banditti relate any thing extraordinary of
these rooms."</P>
<P>"No, madam," replied Ludovico, "I
never heard them speak about the rooms,
except to laugh at the credulity of the old
housekeeper, who once was very near catch∣ing
one of the pirates; it was since the
Count arrived at the chateau, he said, and
he laughed heartily as he related the trick
he had played off."</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="332"/>
A blush overspread Emily's cheek, and
she impatiently desired Ludovico to ex∣plain
himself.</P>
<P>"Why, my lady," said he, "as this
fellow was, one night in the bed-room, he
heard somebody approaching through the
next apartment, and not having time to lift
up the arras, and unfasten the door, he hid
himself in the bed just by. There he lay
for some time in as great a fright, I sup∣pose—"</P>
<P>"As you was in," interrupted Annette,
"when you sat up so boldly to watch by
yourself."</P>
<P>"Aye," said Ludovico," in as great a
fright as he ever made any body else suf∣fer;
and presently the housekeeper and some
other person came up to the bed, when
he, thinking they were going to examine
it, bethought him, that his only chance of
escaping detection, was by terrrifying them;
so he lifted up the counterpane, but that
did not do, till he raised his face above
it, and then they both set off, he said, as if
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
they had seen the devil, and he got out of
the rooms undiscovered."</P>
<P>Emily could not forbear smiling at this
explanation of the deception, which had
given her so much superstitious terror; and
was surprised, that she could have suffered
herself to be thus alarmed, till she consi∣dered,
that, when the mind has Once begun
to yield to the weakness of superstition,
trifles impress it with the force of convic∣tion.
Still, however, she remembered with
awe the mysterious music, which had
been heard, at midnight, near Chateau-le∣Blanc,
and she asked Ludovico if he could
give any explanation of it; but he could
not.</P>
<P>"I only know, madam," he added,
"that it did not belong to the pirates, for I
have heard them laugh about it, and say,
they believed the devil was in league with
them there."</P>
<P>"Yes, I will answer for it he was," said
Annette, her countenance brightening, "I
was sure all along, that he or his spirits
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
had something to do with the north apart∣ments,
and now you see, madam, I am
right at last."</P>
<P>"It cannot be denied, that his spirits
were very busy in that part of the cha∣teau,"
replied Emily, smiling. "But I am
surprised, Ludovico, that these pirates
should persevere in their schemes, after the
arrival of the Count; what could they
expect but certain detection?"</P>
<P>"I have reason to believe, madam," re∣plied
Ludovico, "that it was their intention
to persevere no longer than was necessary
for the removal of the stores, which were
deposited in the vaults; and it appeared,
that they had been employed in doing so
from within a short period after the Count's
arrival; but, as they had only a few hours
in the night for this business, and were
carrying on other schemes at the same time,
the vaults were not above half emptied,
when they took me away. They gloried
exceedingly in this opportunity of con∣firming
the superstitious reports, that had
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
been spread of the north chambers, were
careful to leave every thing there as they had
found it, the better to promote the decep∣tion,
and frequently, in their jocose moods,
would laugh at the consternation, which
they believed the inhabitants of the castle
had suffered upon my disappearing, and it
was to prevent the possibility of my betray∣ing
their secret, that they had removed me
to such a distance. From that period they
considered the chateau as nearly their own;
but I found from the discourse of their
comrades, that, though they were cautious,
at first, in shewing their power there, they
had once very nearly betrayed themselves.
Going, one night, as was their custom, to
the north chambers to repeat the noises,
that had occasioned such alarm among the
servants, they heard, as they were about to
unfasten the secret door, voices in the bed∣room.
My lord has since told me, that
himself and M. Henri were then in the
apartment, and they heard very extraordi∣nary
sounds of lamentation, which it seems
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>
were made by these fellows, with their usual
design of spreading terror; and my lord
has owned, he then felt somewhat more,
than surprise; but, as it was necessary to
the peace of his family, that no notice
should be taken, he was silent on the sub∣ject,
and enjoined silence to his son."</P>
<P>Emily, recollecting the change, that had
appeared in the spirits of the Count, after
the night, when he had watched in the
north room, now perceived the cause of it;
and, having made some further enquiries
upon this strange affair, she dismissed Lu∣dovico,
and went to give orders for the ac∣commodation
of her friends, on the follow∣ing
day.</P>
<P>In the evening, Theresa, lame as she was,
came to deliver the ring, with which Va∣lancourt
had entrusted her, and, when she
presented it, Emily was much affected, for
she remembered to have seen him wear it
often in happier days. She was, however,
much displeased, that Theresa had received
it, and positively refused to accept it her∣self,
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
though to have done so would have
afforded her a melancholy pleasure. The∣resa
entreated, expostulated, and then de∣scribed
the distress of Valancourt, when he
had given the ring, and repeated the mes∣sage,
with which he had commissioned her
to deliver it; and Emily could not con∣ceal
the extreme sorrow this recital occa∣sioned
her, but wept, and remained lost in
thought.</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear young lady!" said The∣resa,
"why should all this be? I have
known you from your infancy, and it may
well be supposed I love you, as if you was
my own, and wish as much to see you hap∣py.
M. Valancourt, to be sure, I have
not known so long, but then I have reason
to love him, as though he was my own son.
I know how well you love one another, or
why all this weeping and wailing?" Emily
waved her hand for Theresa to be silent,
who, disregarding the signal, continued,
"And how much you are alike in your
tempers and ways, and, that, if you were
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
married, you would be the happiest couple
in the whole province—then what is there
to prevent your marrying? Dear dear! to
see how some people fling away their hap∣piness,
and then cry and lament about it,
just as if it was not their own doing, and
as if there was more pleasure in wailing and
weeping, than in being at peace. Learn∣ing,
to be sure, is a fine thing, but, if it
teaches folks no better than that, why I
had rather be without it; if it would teach
them to be happier, I would say some∣thing
to it, then it would be learning and
wisdom too."</P>
<P>Age and long services had given Theresa
a privilege to talk, but Emily now endea∣voured
to check her loquacity, and, though
she felt the justness of some of her remarks,
did not choose to explain the circumstances,
that had determined her conduct towards Va∣lancourt.
She, therefore, only told Theresa,
that it would much displease her to hear
the subject renewed; that she had reasons
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
for her conduct, which she did not think it
proper to mention, and that the ring must
be returned, with an assurance, that she
could not accept it with propriety; and, at
the same time, she forbade Theresa to re∣peat
any future message from Valancourt,
as she valued her esteem and kindness.
Theresa was afflicted, and made another
attempt, though feeble, to interest her for
Valancourt, but the unusual displeasure,
expressed in Emily's countenance, soon
obliged her to desist, and she departed in
wonder and lamentation.</P>
<P>To relieve her mind, in some degree, from
the painful recollections, that intruded upon
it, Emily busied herself in preparations for
the journey into Languedoc, and, while An∣nette,
who assisted her, spoke with joy and
affection of the safe return of Ludovico,
she was considering how she might best pro∣mote
their happiness, and determined, if it
appeared, that his affection was as un∣changed
as that of the simple and honest
Annette, to give her a marriage portion,
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
and settle them on some part of her estate.
These considerations led her to the remem∣brance
of her father's paternal domain,
which his affairs had formerly compelled
him to dispose of to M. Quesnel, and which
she frequently wished to regain, because St.
Aubert had lamented, that the chief lands
of his ancestors had passed into another
family, and because they had been his birth∣place
and the haunt of his early years.
To the estate at Tholouse she had no pe∣culiar
attachment, and it was her wish to
dispose of this, that she might purchase her
paternal domains, if M. Quesnel could be
prevailed on to part with them, which, as he
talked much of living in Italy, did not ap∣pear
very improbable.</P>

and the terror she had suffered had stolen
from Blanche much of her sprightliness, but
all her affectionate simplicity remained, and,
though she appeared less blooming, she was
not less engaging than before. The unfor∣tunate
adventure on the Pyrenées had made
the Count very anxious to reach home, and,
after little more than a week's stay at La
Vallée, Emily prepared to set out with her
friends for Languedoc, assigning the care of
her house, during her absence, to Theresa.
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
On the evening, preceding her departure,
this old servant brought again the ring of
Valancourt, and, with tears, entreated her
mistress to receive it, for that she had neither
seen, or heard of M. Valancourt, since the
night when he delivered it to her. As she said
this, her countenance expressed more alarm,
than she dared to utter; but Emily, check∣ing
her own propensity to fear, considered,
that he had probably returned to the resi∣dence
of his brother, and, again refusing to
accept the ring, bade Theresa preserve it,
till she saw him, which, with extreme reluc∣tance,
she promised to do.</P>
<P>On the following day, Count De Villefort,
with Emily and the Lady Blanche, left La
Vallée, and, on the ensuing evening, arrived
at the Chateau-le-Blanc, where the Coun∣tess,
Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom Emily
was surprised to find there, received them
with much joy and congratulation. She
was concerned to observe, that the Count
still encouraged the hopes of his friend,
whose countenance declared, that his affect∣tion
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>
had suffered no abatement from absence;
and was much distressed, when, on the second
evening after her arrival, the Count, having
withdrawn her from the Lady Blanche, with
whom she was walking, renewed the subject
of M. Du Pont's hopes. The mildness,
with which she listened to his intercessions
at first, deceiving him, as to her sentiments,
he began to believe, that, her affection for
Valancourt being overcome, she was, at
length, disposed to think favourably of M.
Du Pont; and, when she afterwards con∣vinced
him of his mistake, he ventured, in
the earnestness of his wish to promote what
he considered to be the happiness of two
persons, whom he so much esteemed, gently
to remonstrate with her, on thus suffering an
ill-placed affection to poison the happiness
of her most valuable years.</P>
<P>Observing her silence and the deep dejec∣tion
of her countenance, he concluded with
saying, "I will not say more now, but I
will still believe, my dear Mademoiselle St.
Aubert, that you will nor always reject a
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
person, so truly estimable as my friend Du
Pont."</P>
<P>He spared her the pain of replying, by
leaving her; and she strolled on, somewhat
displeased with the Count for having perse∣vered
to plead for a suit, which she had re∣peatedly
rejected, and lost amidst the melan∣choly
recollections, which this topic had re∣vived,
till she had insensibly reached the
borders of the woods, that screened the mo∣nastery
of St. Clair, when, perceiving how
far she had wandered, she determined to ex∣tend
her walk a little farther, and to enquire
after the abbess and some of her friends
among the nuns.</P>
<P>Though the evening was now drawing to
a close, she accepted the invitation of the
friar, who opened the gate, and, anxious to
meet some of her old acquaintance, pro∣ceeded
towards the convent parlour. As
she crossed the lawn, that stoped from the
front of the monastery towards the sea, she
was struck with the picture of repose, exhi∣bited
by some monks, sitting in the cloisters,
<PB N="339" REF="345"/>
which extended under the brew of the
woods, that crowned this eminence; where,
as they meditated, at this twilight hour,
holy subjects, they sometimes suffered their
attention to be relieved by the scene before
them, nor thought it profane to look at na∣ture,
now that it had exchanged the bril∣liant
colours of day for the sober hue of
evening. Before the cloisters, however,
spread an ancient chesnut, whose ample
branches were designed to screen the full
magnificence of a scene, that might tempt
the wish to worldly pleasures; but still, be∣neath
the dark and spreading foliage, gleam∣ed
a wide extent of ocean, and many a pass∣ing
sail; while, to the right and left, thick
woods were seen stretching along the wind∣ing
shores. So much as this had been ad∣mitted,
perhaps, to give to the secluded vo∣tary
an image of the dangers and vicissitudes
of life, and to console him, now that he had
renounced its pleasures, by the certainty of
having escaped its evils. As Emily walked
<PB N="340" REF="346"/>
pensively along, considering how much suf∣fering
she might have escaped, had she be∣come
a votaress of the order, and remained
in this retirement from the time of her fa∣ther's
death, the vesper-bell struck up, and
the monks retired slowly toward the chapel,
while she, pursuing her way, entered the
great hall, where an unusual silence seemed
to reign. The parlour too, which opened
from it, she found vacant, but, as the even∣ing
bell was sounding, she believed the
nuns had withdrawn into the chapel, and
sat down to rest, for a moment, before she
returned to the chateau, where, however,
the increasing gloom made her now anxious
to be.</P>
<P>Not many minutes had elapsed, before a
nun, entering in haste, enquired for the ab∣bess,
and was retiring, without recollecting
Emily, when she made herself known, and
then learned, that a mass was going to be
performed for the soul of sister Agnes, who
had been declining, for some time, and who
was now believed to be dying.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="347"/>
Of her sufferings the sister gave a melan∣choly
account, and of the horrors, into which
she had frequently started, but which had
now yielded to a dejection so gloomy, that
neither the prayers, in which she was joined
by the sisterhood, or the assurances of her
confessor, had power to recall her from it,
or to cheer her mind even with a momentary
gleam of comfort.</P>
<P>To this relation Emily listened with ex∣treme
concern, and, recollecting the fren∣zied
manners and the expressions of horror,
which she had herself witnessed of Agnes, to∣gether
with the history, that sister Frances had
communicated, her compassion was height∣ened
to a very painful degree. As the even∣ing
was already far advanced, Emily did
not now desire to see her, or to join in the
mass, and, after leaving many kind remem∣brances
with the nun, for her old friends,
she quitted the monastery, and returned over
the cliffs toward the chateau, meditating
upon what she had just: heard, till, at length
<PB N="342" REF="348"/>
she forced her mind upon less interesting
subjects.</P>
<P>The wind was high, and as she drew near
the chateau, she often paused to listen to
its awful sound, as it swept over the bil∣lows,
that beat below, or groaned along the
surrounding woods; and, while she rested
on a cliff at a short distance from the cha∣teau,
and looked upon the wide waters, seen
dimly beneath the last shade of twilight, she
thought of the following address.</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>TO THE WINDS.</HEAD>
<L>Viewless, through heaven's vast vault your course
ye steer,</L>
<L>Unknown from whence ye come, or whither go!</L>

<L>In the dread storm, that o'er the ocean rolls,</L>
<L>And, while their charm the angry wave controuls,</L>

<L>Then, rising in the pause, a sweeter note,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the following evening, the view of
the convent towers, rising among the sha∣dowy
woods, reminded Emily of the nun,
whose condition had so much affected her;
and, anxious to know how she was, as well
as to see some of her former friends, she
and the Lady Blanche extended their walk
to the monastery. At the gate stood a car∣riage,
which, from the heat of the horses,
appeared to have just arrived; but a more
than common stillness pervaded the court
and the cloisters, through which Emily and
Blanche passed in their way to the great
hall, where a nun, who was crossing to the
stair-case, replied to the enquiries of the
<PB N="345" REF="351"/>
former, that sister Agnes was still living,
and sensible, but that it was thought she
could not survive the night. In the par∣lour,
they found several of the boarders,
who rejoiced to see Emily, and told her
many little circumstances that had happened
in the convent since her departure, and
which were interesting to her only because
they related to persons, whom she had re∣garded
with affection. While they thus
conversed, the abbess entered the room,
and expressed much satisfaction at seeing
Emily, but her manner was unusually so∣lemn,
and her countenance dejected. "Our
house," said she, after the first salutations
were over, "is truly a house of mourning—a
daughter is now paying the debt of na∣ture.—You
have heard, perhaps, that our
daughter Agnes is dying?"</P>
<P>Emily expressed her sincere concern.</P>
<P>"Her death presents to us a great and
awful lesson," continued the abbess; "let
us read it, and profit by it; let it teach us
to prepare ourselves for the change, that
<PB N="346" REF="352"/>
awaits us all! You are young, and have it
yet in your power to secure "the peace
that passeth all understanding"—the peace
of conscience. Preserve it in your youth,
that it may comfort you in age; for vain,
alas! and imperfect are the good deeds of
our latter years, if those of our early life
have been evil!"</P>
<P>Emily would have said, that good deeds,
she hoped, were never vain; but she consi∣dered
that it was the abbess who spoke, and
she remained silent.</P>
<P>"The latter days of Agnes," resumed
the abbess, "have been exemplary; would
they might atone for the errors of her for∣mer
ones! Her sufferings now, alas! are
great; let us believe, that they will make
her peace hereafter! I have left her with
her confessor, and a gentleman, whom she
has long been anxious to see, and who is just
arrived from Paris. They, I hope, will be
able to administer the repose, which her
mind has hitherto wante!"</P>
<P>Emily servently joined in the wish.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="353"/>
"During her illness, she has sometimes
named you," resumed the abbess; "per∣haps,
it would comfort her to see you;
when her present visitors have left her, we
will go to her chamber, if the scene will not
be too melancholy for your spirits. But,
indeed, to such scenes, however painful, we
ought to accustom ourselves, for they are
salutary to the soul, and prepare us for
what we are ourselves to suffer."</P>
<P>Emily became grave and thoughtful;
for this conversation brought to her recol∣lection
the dying moments of her beloved
father, and she wished once more to weep
over the spot, where his remains were bu∣ried.
During the silence, which followed
the abbess's speech, many minute circum∣stances
attending his last hours occurred to
her—his emotion on perceiving himself to
be in the neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc—his
request to be interred in a par∣ticular
spot in the church of this monastery—and
the solemn charge he had delivered
her to destroy certain papers, without exa∣mining
<PB N="348" REF="354"/>
them.—She recollected also the
mysterious and horrible words in those ma∣nuscripts,
upon which her eye had involun∣tarily
glanced; and, though they now, and,
indeed, whenever she remembered them, re∣vived
an excess of painful curiosity, con∣cerning
their full import, and the motives
for her father's command, it was ever her
chief consolation, that she had strictly obeyed
him in this particular.</P>
<P>Little more was said by the abbess, who
appeared too much affected by the subject
she had lately left, to be willing to con∣verse,
and her companions had been for
some time silent from the same cause, when
this general reverie was interrupted by the
entrance of a stranger, Monsieur Bonnac,
who had just quitted the chamber of sister
Agnes. He appeared much disturbed,
but Emily fancied, that his countenance
had more the expression of horror, than
of grief. Having drawn the abbess to a
distant part of the room, he conversed with
her for some time, during which she seemed
<PB N="349" REF="355"/>
to listen with earnest attention, and he to
speak with caution, and a more than com∣mon
degree of interest. When he had con∣cluded,
he bowed silently to the rest of the
company, and quitted the room. The ab∣bess,
soon after, proposed going to the
chamber of sister Agnes, to which Emily
consented, though not without some reluc∣tance,
and Lady Blanche remained with
the boarders below.</P>
<P>At the door of the chamber they met
the confessor, whom, as he lifted up his
head on their approach, Emily observed to
be the same that had attended her dying fa∣ther;
but he passed on, without noticing
her, and they entered the apartment, where,
on a mattress, was laid sifter Agnes, with
one nun watching in the chair beside her.
Her countenance was so much, changed,
that Emily would scarcely have recollected
her, had she not been prepared to do so:
it was ghastly, and overspread with gloomy
horror; her dim and hollow eyes were fixed
on a crucifix, which she held upon her bo∣som
<PB N="350" REF="356"/>
and she was so much engaged in
thought, as not to perceive the abbess and
Emily, till they stood at the bed-side,
Then, turning her heavy eyes, she fixed
them, in wild horror, upon Emily; and,
screaming, exclaimed, "Ah! that vision
comes upon me in my dying hours!"</P>
<P>Emily started back in terror, and looked
for explanation to the abbess, who made her
a signal not to be alarmed, and calmly said
to Agnes, "Daughter, I have brought
Mademoiselle St. Aubert to visit you: I
thought you would be glad to see her."</P>
<P>Agnes made no reply; but, still gazing
wildly upon Emily, exclaimed, "It is her
very self! Oh! there is all that fascination
in her look, which proved my destruction!
What would you have—what is it you
come to demand—Retribution?—It will
soon be yours—it is yours already. How
many years have passed, since last I saw
you! My crime is but as yesterday.—Yet
I am grown old beneath it; while you
are still young and blooming—blooming as
<PB N="351" REF="357"/>
when you forced me to commit that most
abhorred deed! O! could I once forget it!—yet
what would that avail?—the deed is
done!"</P>
<P>Emily, extremely shocked, would now
have left the room; but the abbess, taking
her hand, tried to support her spirits, and
begged she would stay a few moments,
when Agnes would probably be calm,
whom now she tried to sooth, But the lat∣ter
seemed to disregard her, while she still
fixed her eyes on Emily, and added,
"What are years of prayers and repent∣ance?
they cannot wash out the foulness of
murder!—Yes, murder! Where is he—where
is he?—Look there—look there!—see
where he stalks along the room! Why
do you come to torment me now?" conti∣nued
Agnes, while her straining eyes were
bent on air, "why was not I punished be∣fore?—O!
do not frown so sternly! Hah!
there again! 'tis she herself! Why do you
look so piteously upon me—and smile, too?
smile on me! What groan was that?"</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358"/>
Agnes sunk down, apparently lifeless,
and Emily, unable to support herself, leaned
against the bed, while the abbess and the
attendant nun were applying the usual re∣medies
to Agnes. "Peace," said the ab∣bess,
when Emily was going to speak,
"the delirium is going off, she will soon re∣vive.
When was she thus before, daugh∣ter?"</P>
<P>"Not of many weeks, madam," re∣plied
the nun,"but her spirits have been
much agitated by the arrival of the gentle∣man
she wished so much to see."</P>
<P>"Yes," observed the abbess, "that has
undoubtedly occasioned this paroxysm of
frenzy. When she is better, we will leave
her to repose."</P>
<P>Emily very readily consented, but, though
she could now give little assistance, she was
unwilling to quit the chamber, while any
might be necessary.</P>
<P>When Agnes recovered her senses, she
again fixed her eyes on Emily, but their
wild expression was gone, and a gloomy me∣lancholy
<PB N="353" REF="359"/>
had succeeded. It was some mo∣ments
before she recovered sufficient spirits
to speak; she then said feebly—"The
likeness is wonderful!—surely it must be
something more than fancy. Tell me, I
conjure you," she added, addressing Emily,
"though your name is St. Aubert, are you
not the daughter of the Marchioness?"
"What Marchioness?" said Emily, in ex∣treme
surprise; for she had imagined, from
the calmness of Agnes's manner, that her
intellects were restored, The abbess gave
her a significant glance, but she repeated
the question.</P>
<P>"What Marchioness?" exclaimed Ag∣nes,
"I know but of one—the Marchioness
de Villeroi."</P>
<P>Emily, remembering the emotion of her
late father, upon the unexpected mention
of this lady, and his request to be laid near
the tomb of the Villerois, now felt greatly
interested, and she entreated Agnes to ex∣plain
the reason of her question. The ab∣bess
would now have withdrawn Emily
<PB N="354" REF="360"/>
from the room, who being, however, de∣tained
by a strong interest, repeated her en∣treaties.</P>
<P>"Bring me that casket, sister," said Ag∣nes;
"I will shew her to you; yet you
need only look in that mirror, and you will
behold her; you surely are her daughter:
such striking resemblance is never found
but among near relations."</P>
<P>The nun brought the casket, and Agnes,
having directed her how to unlock it, she
took thence a miniature, in which Emily
perceived the exact resemblance of the pic∣ture,
which she had found among her late fa∣ther's
papers. Agnes held out her hand to re∣ceive
it; gazed upon it earnestly for some
moments in silence; and then, with a counte∣nance
of deep despair, threw up her eyes to
Heaven, and prayed inwardly. When she
had finished, she returned the miniature to
Emily. "Keep it," said she, "I bequeath
it to you, for I must believe it is your
right. I have frequently observed the re∣semblance
between you; but never, till this
<PB N="355" REF="361"/>
day, did it strike upon my conscience so
powerfully! Stay, sister, do not remove the
casket—there is another picture I would
shew."</P>
<P>Emily trembled with expectation, and
the abbess again would have withdrawn her.
"Agnes is still disordered," said she, "you
observe how she wanders. In these moods
she says any thing, and does not scruple,
as you have witnessed, to accuse herself of
the most horrible crimes."</P>
<P>Emily, however, thought she perceived
something more than madness in the incon∣sistencies
of Agnes, whose mention of the
Marchioness, and production of her picture,
had interested her so much, that she deter∣mined
to obtain further information, if pos∣sible,
respecting the subject of it.</P>
<P>The nun returned with the casket, and,
Agnes pointing out to her a secret drawer,
she took from it another miniature. "Here,"
said Agnes, as she offered it to Emily,
"learn a lesson for your vanity, at least;
look well at this picture, and see if you can
<PB N="356" REF="362"/>
discover any resemblance between what I
was, and what I am"</P>
<P>Emily impatiently received the miniature,
which her eyes had scarcely glanced upon,
before her trembling hands had nearly suf∣fered
it to fall—it was the resemblance of
the portrait of Signora Laurentini, which
she had formerly seen in the castle of Udol∣pho—the
lady, who had disappeared in so
mysterious a manner, and whom Montoni
had been suspected of having caused to be
murdered.</P>
<P>In silent astonishment, Emily continued
to gaze alternately upon the picture and the
dying nun, endeavouring to trace a resem∣blance
between them, which no longer
existed.</P>
<P>"Why do you look so sternly on me?"
said Agnes, mistaking the nature of Emily's
emotion.</P>
<P>"I have seen this face before" said
Emily, at length; "was it really your
re∣semblance?"</P>
<P>"You may well ask that question," re∣plied
<PB N="357" REF="363"/>
the nun,—"but it was once esteemed
a striking likeness of me. Look at me
well, and see what guilt has made me. I
then was innocent; the evil passions of my
nature slept. Sister!" added she solemnly,
and stretching forth her cold, damp hand to
Emily, who shuddered at its touch—"Sis∣ter!
beware of the first indulgence of the
passions; beware of the first! Their course,
if not checked then, is rapid—their force is
uncontroulable—they lead us we know not
whither—they lead us perhaps to the
com∣mission
of crimes, for which whole years of
prayer and penitence cannot atone!—Such
may be the force of even a single passion,
that it overcomes every other, and sears up
every other approach to the heart.
Pos∣sessing
us like a fiend, it leads us on to the
acts of a fiend, making us insensible to pity
and to conscience. And, when its purpose
is accomplished, like a fiend, it leaves us
to the torture of those feelings, which its
power had suspended—not annihilated,—to
<PB N="358" REF="364"/>
the tortures of compassion, remorse, and
conscience. Then, we awaken as from a
dream, and perceive a new world around us—we
gaze in astonishment, and horror—but
the deed is committed; not all the powers
of heaven and earth united can undo it—and
the spectres of conscience will not fly!
What are riches—grandeur—health itself,
to the luxury of a pure conscience, the
health of the soul;—and what the sufferings
of poverty, disappointment, despair—to
the anguish of an afflicted one! O! how
long is it since I knew that luxury! I be∣lieved,
that I had suffered the most agoniz∣ing
pangs of human nature, in love, jealousy
and despair—but these pangs were ease,
compared with the stings of conscience,
which I have since endured. I tasted too
what was called the sweet of revenge—but it
was transient, it expired even with the object,
that provoked it. Remember, sister, that the
passions are the seeds of vices as well as of
virtues, from which either may spring, ac∣cordingly
<PB N="359" REF="365"/>
as they are nurtured. Unhappy
they who have never been taught the art to
govern them"</P>
<P>"Alas! unhappy!" said the abbess,
"and ill-informed of our holy religion!"
Emily listened to Agnes, in silent awe,
while she still examined the miniature, and
became confirmed in her opinion of its
strong resemblance to the portrait at Udol∣pho.
"This face is familiar to me" said
she, wishing to lead the nun to an explana∣tion,
yet fearing to discover too abruptly
her knowledge of Udolpho.</P>
<P>"You are mistaken" replied Agnes,
"you certainly never saw that picture be∣fore."</P>
<P>"No," replied Emily, "but I have seen
one extremely like it" "Impossible," said
Agnes, who may now be called the Lady
Laurentini.</P>
<P>"It was in the castle of Udolpho" con∣tinued
Emily, looking stedfastly at her.</P>
<P>"Of Udolpho!" exclaimed Laurentini,
<PB N="360" REF="366"/>
"of Udolpho in Italy!" "The same," re∣plied
Emily.</P>
<P>"You know me then," said Laurentini,
"and you are the daughter of the Marchio∣ness"
Emily was somewhat surprised at
this abrupt assertion. "I am the daughter
of the late Mons. St. Aubert," said she;
"and the lady you name is an utter stran∣ger
to me."</P>
<P>"At least you believe so," rejoined Lau∣rentini.</P>
<P>Emily asked what reasons there could be
to believe otherwise.</P>
<P>"The family likeness, that yon bear her,"
said the nun. "The Marchioness, it is
known, was attached to a gentleman of
Gascony, at the time when she accepted the
hand of the Marquis, by the command of
her father. Ill-fated, unhappy woman!"</P>
<P>Emily, remembering the extreme emo∣tion
which St. Aubert had betrayed on the
mention of the Marchioness, would now
have suffered something more than surprise,
<PB N="361" REF="367"/>
had her confidence in his integrity been
less; as it was, she could not, for a mo∣ment,
believe what the words of Laurentini
insinuated; yet she still felt strongly inte∣rested,
concerning them, and begged, that
she would explain them further.</P>
<P>"Do not urge me on that subject" said
the nun, "it is to me a terrible one! Would
that I could blot it from my memory!"
She sighed deeply, and, after the pause of a
moment, asked Emily, by what means she
had discovered her name?</P>
<P>"By your portrait in the castle of Udol∣pho,
to which this miniature bears a striking
resemblance" replied Emily.</P>
<P>"You have been at Udolpho then!"
said the nun, with great emotion. "Alas!
what scenes does the mention of it revive in
my fancy—scenes of happiness—of suffer∣ing—and
of horror!"</P>
<P>At this moment, the terrible spectacle,
which Emily had witnessed in a chamber of
that casftle, occurred to her, and she shud∣dered,
while she looked upon the nun—
<PB N="362" REF="368"/>
and recollected her late words—that "years
of prayer and penitence could not wash out
the foulness of murder." She was now com∣pelled
to attribute these to another cause,
than that of delirium. With a degree of
horror, that almost deprived her of sense,
she now believed she looked upon a mur∣derer;
all the recollected behaviour of
Laurentini seemed to confirm the supposi∣tion,
yet Emily was still lost in a labyrinth
of perplexities, and, not knowing how to
ask the questions, which might lead to
truth, she could only hint them in broken
sentences.</P>
<P>"Your sudden departure from Udolpho"—said
she.</P>
<P>Laurentini groaned.</P>
<P>"The reports that followed it," conti∣nued
Emily—"The west chamber—the
mourning veil—the object it conceals!—when
murders are committed—"</P>
<P>The nun shrieked, "What! there
again!" said she, endeavouring to raise
herself, while her starting eyes seemed to
<PB N="363" REF="369"/>
follow some object round the room—"Come
from the grave! What! Blood—blood
too!—There was no blood—thou
canst not say it!—Nay, do not smile,—do
not smile so piteously!"</P>
<P>Laurentini fell into convulsions, as she
uttered the last words; and Emily, unable
any longer to endure the horror of the
scene, hurried from the room, and sent some
nuns to the assistance of the abbess.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, and the boarders, who
were in the parlour, now assembled round
Emily, and, alarmed by her manner and af∣frighted
countenance, asked a hundred ques∣tions,
which she avoided answering further,
than by saying, that she believed sister Ag∣nes
was dying. They received this as a
sufficient explanation of her terror, and had
then leisure to offer restoratives, which, at
length, somewhat revived Emily, whose
mind was, however, so much shocked with
terrible sur mises, and perplexed with doubts
by some words from the nun, that she was
<PB N="364" REF="370"/>
unable to converse, and would have left the
convent immediately, had she not wished to
know whether Laurentini would survive the
late attack. After waiting some time, she
was informed, that, the convulsions having
ceased, Laurentini seemed to be reviving,
and Emily and Blanche were departing,
when the abbess appeared, who, drawing
the former aside, said she had something
of consequence to say to her, but, as it
was late, she would not detain her then, and
requested to see her on the following day.</P>
<P>Emily promised to visit her, and, having
taken leave, returned with the Lady Blanche
towards the chateau, on the way to which
the deep gloom of the woods made Blanche
lament, that the evening was so far advanced;
for the surrounding stillness and obscurity
rendered her sensible of fear, though there
was a servant to protect her; while Emily was
too much engaged by the horrors of the
scene she had just witnessed, to be affected
by the solemnity of the shades, otherwise
<PB N="365" REF="371"/>
than as they served to promote her gloomy
reverie, from which, however, she was at
length recalled by the Lady Blanche, who
pointed out, at some distance, in the dusky
path they were winding, two persons slowly
advancing. It was impossible to avoid them
without striking into a still more secluded
part of the wood, whither the strangers
might easily follow; but all apprehension
vanished, when Emily distinguished the
voice of Mons. Du Pont, and perceived,
that his companion was the gentleman,
whom she had seen at the monastery, and
who was now conversing with so much ear∣nestness
as not immediately to perceive
their approach. When Du Pont joined
the ladies, the stranger took leave, and they
proceeded to the chateau, where the Count,
when he heard of Mons. Bonnac, claimed
him for an acquaintance, and, on learning
the melancholy occasion of his visit to Lan∣guedoc,
and that he was lodged at a small
inn in the village, begged the favour of
<PB N="366" REF="372"/>
Mons. Du Pont to invite him to the
cha∣teau.</P>
<P>The latter was happy to do so, and the
scruples of reserve, which made M. Bonnac
hesitate to accept the invitation, being at
length overcome, they went to the chateau,
where the kindness of the Count and the
sprightliness of his son were exerted to
dis∣sipate the gloom, that overhung the spirits
of the stranger. M. Bonnac was an officer
in the French service, and appeared to be
about fifty; his figure was tall and com∣manding,
his manners had received the last
polish, and there was something in his coun∣tenance
uncommonly interesting; for over
features, which, in youth, must have been
remarkably handsome, was spread a melan∣choly,
that seemed the effect of long mis∣fortune,
rather than of constitution, or tem∣per.</P>
<P>The conversation he held, during supper,
was evidently an effort of politeness, and
there were intervals in which, unable to
<PB N="367" REF="373"/>
struggle against the feelings, that depressed
him, he relapsed into silence and abstrac∣tion,
from which, however, the Count,
sometimes, withdrew him in a manner
so delicate and benevolent, that Emily,
while she observed him, almost fancied she
beheld her late father.</P>
<P>The party separated, at an early hour,
and then, in the solitude of her apartment,
the scenes, which Emily had lately wit∣nessed,
returned to her fancy, with dreadful
energy. That in the dying nun she should
have discovered Signora Laurentini, who,
instead of having been murdered by Mon∣toni,
was, as it now seemed, herself guilty
of some dreadful crime, excited both horror
and surprise in a high degree; nor did the
hints, which she had dropped, respecting
the marriage of the Marchioness de Vil∣leroi,
and the enquiries she had made con∣cerning
Emily's birth, occasion her a less
degree of interest, though it was of a dif∣ferent
nature.</P>
<P>The history, which sister Frances had for∣merly
<PB N="368" REF="374"/>
related, and had said to be that of
Agnes, it now appeared, was erroneous; but
for what purpose it had been fabricated,
un∣less the more effectually to conceal the true
story, Emily could not even guess. Above
all, her interest was excited as to the rela∣tion,
which the story of the late Marchioness
de Villeroi bore to that of her father; for,
that some kind of relation existed between
them, the grief of St. Aubert, upon hear∣ing
her named, his request to be buried
near her, and her picture, which had been
sound among his papers, certainly proved.
Sometimes it occurred to Emily, that he
might have been the lover, to whom it was
said the Marchioness was attached, when she
was compelled to marry the Marquis de
Villeroi; but that he had afterwards Che∣rished
a passion for her, she could not suffer
herself to believe, for a moment. The pa∣pers,
which he had so solemnly enjoined
her to destroy, she now fancied had related
to this connection, and she wished more
earnestly than before to know the reasons,
<PB N="369" REF="375"/>
that made him consider the injunction necessary,
which, had her faith in his princi∣ples
been less, would have led to believe,
that there was a mystery in her birth disho∣nourable
to her parents, which those manu∣scripts
might have revealed.</P>
<P>Reflections, similar to these, engaged her
mind, during the greater part of the night,
and when, at length, she fell into a slumber,
it was only to behold a vision of the dying
nun, and to awaken in horrors, like those
she had witnessed.</P>
<P>On the following morning, she was too
much indisposed to attend her appointment
with the abbess, and, before the day con∣cluded,
she heard, that sister Agnes was no
more. Mons. Bonnac received this intelli∣gence,
with concern; but Emily observed,
that he did not appear so much affected
now, as on the preceding evening, imme∣diately
after quitting the apartment of the
nun, whose death was probably less terrible
to him, than the confession he had been
then called upon to witness. However this
<PB N="370" REF="376"/>
might be, he was perhaps consoled, in some
degree, by a knowledge of the legacy be∣queathed
him, since his family was large,
and the extravagance of some part of it
had lately been the means of involving
him in great distress, and even in the hor∣rors
of a prison; and it was the grief he
had suffered from the wild career of a
favourite son, with the pecuniary anxie∣ties
and misfortunes consequent upon it,
that had given to his countenance the air
of dejection, which had so much interested
Emily.</P>
<P>To his friend Mons. Du Pont he recited
some particulars of his late sufferings, when
it appeared, that he had been consined for
several months in one of the prisons of Pa∣ris,
with little hope of release, and without
the comfort of seeing his wife, who had
been absent in the country, endeavouring,
though in vain, to procure assistance from
his friends. When, at length, she had ob∣tained
an order for admittance, she was so
much shocked at the change, which long
<PB N="371" REF="377"/>
consinement and sorrow had made in his
ap∣pearance,
that she was seized with sits,
which, by their long continuance, threatened
her life.</P>
<P>"Our situation affected those, who hap∣pened
to witness it," continued Mons. Bon∣nac,
"and one generous friend, who was
in consinement at the same time, afterwards
employed the first moments of his liberty
in efforts to obtain mine. He succeeded;
the heavy debt, that oppressed me, was dis∣charged;
and, when I would have expressed
my sense of the obligation I had received,
my benefactor was fled from my search. I
have reason to believe he was the victim of
his own generosity, and that he returned to
the state of consinement, from which he had
released me; but every enquiry after him
was unsuccessful. Amiable and unfortu∣nate
Valancourt!"</P>
<P>"Valancourt!" exclaimed Mons. Du
Pont. "Of what family?"</P>
<P>"The Valancourts, Counts Duvarney," replied Mons. Bonnac.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="378"/>
The emotion of Mons. Du Pont, when
he discovered the generous benefactor of
his friend to be the rival of his love, can
only be imagined; but, having overcome
his first surprise, he dissipated the appre∣hensions
of Mons. Bonnac by acquainting
him, that Valancourt was at liberty, and
had lately been in Languedoc; after which
his affection for Emily prompted him to
make some enquiries, respecting the conduct
of his rival, during his stay at Paris, of
which M. Bonnac appeared to be well in∣formed.
The answers he received were
such as convinced him, that Valancourt
had been much misrepresented, and, painful
as was the sacrifice, he formed the just de∣sign
of relinquishing his pursuit of Emily
to a lover, who, it now appeared, was not
unworthy of the regard, with which she ho∣noured
him.</P>
<P>The conversation of Mons. Bonnac dis∣covered,
that Valancourt, some time after
his arrival at Paris, had been drawn into
the snares, which determined vice had spread
<PB N="373" REF="379"/>
for him, and that his hours had been chiefly
divided between the parties of the captivat∣ing
Marchioness and those gaming assemblies,
to which the envy, or the avarice, of his bro∣ther
officers had spared no art to seduce him.
In these parties he had lost large sums, in ef∣forts
to recover small ones, and to such losses
the Count De Villefort and Mons. Henri
had been frequent witnesses. His resources
were, at length, exhausted; and the Count,
his brother, exasperated by his conduct, re∣fused
to continue the supplies necessary to
his present mode of life, when Valancourt,
in consequence of accumulated debts, was
thrown into consinement, where his brother
suffered him to remain, in the hope, that
punishment might effect a reform of
con∣duct,
which had not yet been confirmed by
long habit.</P>
<P>In the solitude of his prison, Valancourt
had leisure for reflection, and cause for re∣pentance;
here, too, the image of Emily,
which, amidst the dissipation of the city
had been obscured, but never obliterated
<PB N="374" REF="380"/>
from his heart, revived with all the charms
of innocence and beauty, to reproach him
for having sacrificed his happiness and de∣based
his talents by pursuits, which his no∣bler
faculties would formerly have taught
him to consider were as tasteless as they
were degrading. But, though his passions
had been seduced, his heart was not de∣praved,
nor had habit riveted the chains,
that hung heavily on his conscience; and,
as he retained that energy of will, which
was necessary to burst them, he, at length,
emancipated himself from the bondage of
vice, but not till after much effort and se∣vere
suffering.</P>
<P>Being released by his brother from the
prison, where he had witnessed the affecting
meeting between Mons. Bonnac and his
wife, with whom he had been for some time
acquainted, the first use of his liberty formed
a striking instance of his humanity and his
rashness; for with nearly all the money,
just received from his brother, he went to a
gaming-house, and gave it as a last stake
<PB N="375" REF="381"/>
for the chance of restoring his friend to
freedom, and to his afflicted family. The
event was fortunate, and, while he had
awaited the issue of this momentous stake,
he made a solemn vow never again to yield
to the destructive and fascinating vice of
gaming.</P>
<P>Having restored the venerable Mons.
Bonnac to his rejoicing family, he hurried
from Paris to Estuviere; and, in the de∣light
of having made the wretched happy,
forgot, for a while, his own misfortunes.
Soon, however, he remembered, that he had
thrown away the fortune, without which he
could never hope to marry Emily; and life,
unless passed with her, now scarcely ap∣peared
supportable; for her goodness, re∣sinement,
and simplicity of heart, rendered
her beauty more enchanting, if possible, to
his fancy, than it had ever yet appeared.
Experience had taught him to understand
the full value of the qualities, which he
had before admired, but which the con∣trasted
characters he had seen in the world
<PB N="376" REF="382"/>
made him now adore; and these reflections,
increasing the pangs of remorse and regret,
occasioned the deep dejection, that had ac∣companied
him even into the presence of
Emily, of whom he considered himself no
longer worthy. To the ignominy of having
received pecuniary obligations from the
Marchioness Chamfort, or any other lady of
intrigue, as the Count De Villefort had been
informed, or of having been engaged in the
depredating schemes of gamesters, Valan∣court
had never submitted; and these were
some of such scandals as often mingle
with truth, against the unfortunate. Count
De Villefort had received them from au∣thority,
which he had no reason to doubt,
and which the imprudent conduct he had
himself witnessed in Valancourt, had cer∣tainly
induced him the more readily to be∣lieve.
Being such as Emily could not
name to the Chevalier, he had no opportu∣nity
of refuting them; and, when he con∣fessed
himself to be unworthy of her esteem,
he little suspected, that he was confirming
<PB N="377" REF="383"/>
to her the most dreadful calumnies. Thus
the mistake had been mutual, and had re∣mained
so, when Mons. Bonnac explained
the conduct of his generous, but impru∣dent
young friend to Du Pont, who, with
severe justice, determined not only to unde∣ceive
the Count on this subject, but to re∣sign
all hope of Emily. Such a sacrifice as
his love rendered this, was deserving of a
noble reward, and Mons. Bonnac, if it had
been possible for him to forget the benevo∣lent
Valancourt, would have wished that
Emily might accept the just Du Pont.</P>
<P>When the Count was informed of the
error he had committed, he was extremely
shocked at the consequence of his credu∣lity,
and the account which Mons. Bonnac
gave of his friend's situation, while at Paris,
convinced him, that Valancourt had been
entrapped by the schemes of a set of dissi∣pated
young men, with whom his profes∣sion
had partly obliged him to associate,
rather than by an inclination to vice; and,
charmed by the humanity, and noble, though
<PB N="378" REF="384"/>
rash generosity, which his conduct towards
Mons. Bonnac exhibited, he forgave him
the transient errors, that had stained his
youth, and restored him to the high degree
of esteem, with which he had regarded him,
during their early acquaintance. But, as
the least reparation he could now make Va∣lancourt
was to afford him an opportunity
of explaining to Emily his former conduct,
he immediately wrote, to request his for∣giveness
of the unintentional injury he had
done him, and to invite him to Chateau-le∣Blanc.
Motives of delicacy with-held the
Count from informing Emily of this letter,
and of kindness from acquainting her with
the discovery respecting Valancourt, till his
arrival should save her from the possibility
of anxiety, as to its event; and this precau∣tion
spared her even severer inquietude, than
the Count had foreseen, since he was igno∣rant
of the symptoms of despair, which Va∣lancourt's
late conduct had betrayed.</P>

<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOME circumstances of an extraordinary
nature now withdrew Emily from her own
sorrows, and excited emotions, which par∣took
of both surprise and horror.</P>
<P>A few days following that, on which
Signora Laurentini died, her will was opened
at the monastery, in the presence of the su∣periors
and Mons. Bonnac, when it was
found, that one third of her personal pro∣perty
was bequeathed to the nearest surviv∣ing
relative of the late Marchioness de Vil∣leroi,
and that Emily was the person.</P>
<P>With the secret of Emily's family the
abbess had long been acquainted, and it was
<PB N="280" REF="386"/>
in observance of the earnest request of St.
Aubert, who was known to the friar, that
attended him on his death bed, that his
daughter had remained in ignorance of her
relationship to the Marchioness. But some
hints, which had fallen from Signora Lau∣rentini,
during her last interview with Emily,
and a confession of a very extraordinary na∣ture,
given in her dying hours, had made
the abbess think it necessary to converse
with her young friend, on the topic she had
not before ventured to introduce; and it
was for this purpose, that she had requested
to see her on the morning that followed
her interview with the nun. Emily's indis∣position
had then prevented the intended
conversation; but now, after the will had
been examined, she received a summons,
which she immediately obeyed, and became
informed of circumstances, that powerfully
affected her. As the narrative of the ab∣bess
was, however, deficient in many parti∣culars,
of which the reader may wish to be
informed, and the history of the nun is ma∣terially
<PB N="381" REF="387"/>
connected with the fate of the Mar∣chioness
de Villeroi, we shall omit the con∣versation,
that passed in the parlour of the
convent, and mingle with our relation a
brief history of</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO,</HEAD>
<P>Who was the only child of her parents,
and heiress of the ancient house of Udol∣pho,
in the territory of Venice. It was the
first misfortune of her life, and that which
led to all her succeeding misery, that the
friends, who ought to have restrained her
strong passions, and mildly instructed her
in the art of governing them, nurtured
them by early indulgence. But they che∣rished
their own failings in her; for their
conduct was not the result of rational kind∣ness,
and, when they either indulged, or
opposed the passions of their child, they
gratified their own. Thus they indulged
her with weakenss, and reprehended her
with violence; her spirit was exasperated
by their vehemence, instead of being cor∣rected
<PB N="382" REF="388"/>
by their wisdom; and their oppo∣sitions
became contests for victory, in
which the due tenderness of the parents,
and the affectionate duties of the child,
were equally forgotten; but, as returning
fondness disarmed the parents' resent∣ment
soonest, Laurentini was suffered to
believe that she had conquered, and her
passions became stronger by every effort,
that had been, employed to subdue them.</P>
<P>The death of her father and mother in
the same year left her to her own discretion,
under the dangerous circumstances attend∣ant
on youth and beauty. She was fond
of company, delighted with admiration, yet
disdainful of the opinion of the world,
when it happened to contradict her incli∣nations;
had a gay and brilliant wit, and
was mistress of all the arts of fascination.
Her conduct was such as might have been
expected, from the weakenss of her prin∣ciples
and the strength of her passions.</P>
<P>Among her numerous admirers was the
late Marquis de Villeroi, who, on his tour
<PB N="383" REF="389"/>
through Italy, saw Laurentini at Venice,
where she usually resided, and became her
passionate adorer. Equally captivated by
the figure and accomplishments of the
Marquis, who was at that period one of
the most distinguished noblemen of the
French court, she had the art so effectually
to conceal from him the dangerous traits
of her character and the blemishes of her
late conduct, that he solicited her hand in
marriage.</P>
<P>Before the nuptials were concluded, she
retired to the castle of Udolpho, whither
the Marquis followed, and, where her con∣duct,
relaxing from the propriety, which
she had lately assumed, discovered to him the
precipice, on which he stood. A mi∣nuter
enquiry than he had before thought
it necessary to make, convinced him, that
he had been deceived in her character, and
she, whom he had designed for his wife, af∣terwards
became his mistress.</P>
<P>Having passed some weeks at Udol∣pho,
he was called abruptly to France,
<PB N="384" REF="390"/>
whither he returned with extreme reluc∣tance,
for his heart was still fascinated by
the arts of Laurentini, with whom, how∣ever,
he had on various pretences delayed
his marriage; but, to reconcile her to this
separation, he now gave repeated promises
of returning to conclude the nuptials, as
soon as the affair, which thus suddenly
called him to France, should permit.</P>
<P>Soothed, in some degree, by these assur∣ances,
she suffered him to depart; and,
soon after, her relative, Montoni, arriving
at Udolpho, renewed the addresses, which
she had before refused, and which she now
again rejected. Meanwhile, her thoughts
were constantly with the Marquis de Ville∣roi,
for whom she suffered all the delirium
of Italian love, cherished by the solitude, to
which she consined herself; for she had now
lost all taste for the pleasures of society
and the gaiety of amusement. Her only
indulgences were to sigh and weep over a
miniature of the Marquis; to visit the
scenes, that had witnessed their happiness,
<PB N="385" REF="391"/>
to pour forth her heart to him in writing,
and to count the weeks, the days, which
must intervene before the period that he
had mentioned as probable for his return.
But this period passed without bringing him;
and week after week followed in heavy and
almost intolerable expectation. During this
interval, Laurentini's fancy, occupied in∣cessantly
by one idea, became disordered;
and, her whole heart being devoted to one
object, life became hateful to her, when
she believed that object lost.</P>
<P>Several months passed, during which she
heard nothing from the Marquis de Ville∣roi,
and her days were marked, at inter∣vals,
with the phrensy of passion and the
fullenness of despair. She secluded her∣self
from all visitors, and, sometimes, re∣mained
in her apartment, for weeks toge∣ther,
refusing to speak to every person, ex∣cept
her favourite female attendant, writing
scraps of letters, reading, again and again,
those she had received from the Marquis,
<PB N="386" REF="392"/>
weeping over his picture, and speaking to
it, for many hours, upbraiding, reproach∣ing
and caressing it alternately.</P>
<P>At length, a report reached her, that
the Marquis had married in France, and,
after suffering all the extremes of love, jea∣lousy
and indignation, she formed the de∣sperate
resolution of going secretly to that
country, and, if the report proved true, of
attempting a deep revenge. To her favour∣ite
woman only she consided the plan of
her journey, and she engaged her to par∣take
of it. Having collected her jewels,
which, descending to her from many
branches of her family, were of immense
value, and all her cash, to a very large
amount, they were packed in a trunk,
which was privately conveyed to a neigh∣bouring
town, whither Laurentini, with
this only servant, followed, and thence pro∣ceeded
secretly to Leghorn, where they em∣oarked
for France.</P>
<P>When, on her arrival in Languedoc, she
found, that the Marquis de Villeroi had
<PB N="387" REF="393"/>
been married, for some months, her de∣spair
almost deprived her of reason, and she
alternately projected and abandoned the
horrible design of murdering the Marquis,
his wife and herself. At length she con∣trived
to throw herself in his way, with
an intention of reproaching him, for his
conduct, and of stabbing herself in his pre∣sence;
but, when she again saw him, who
so long had been the constant object of her
thoughts and affections, resentment yielded
to love; her resolution failed; she trem∣bled
with the conflict of emotions, that as∣sailed
her heart, and fainted away.</P>
<P>The Marquis was not proof against her
beauty and sensibility; all the energy,
with which he had first loved, returned,
for his passion had been resisted by pru∣dence,
rather than overcome by indifference;
and, since the honour of his family would
not permit him to marry her, he had endea∣voured
to subdue his love, and had so far
succeeded, as to select the then Marchioness
for his wife, whom he loved at first with a
<PB N="388" REF="394"/>
tempered and rational affection. But the
mild virtues of that amiable lady did not
recompense him for her indifference, which
appeared, notwithstanding her efforts to
conceal it; and he had, for some time, sus∣pected
that her affections were engaged by
another person, when Laurentini arrived in
Languedoc. This artful Italian soon per∣ceived,
that she had regained her influence
over him, and, soothed by the discovery,
she determined to live, and to employ all
her enchantments to win his consent to the
diabolical deed, which she believed was ne∣cessary
to the security of her happiness.
She conducted her scheme with deep dissi∣mulation
and patient perseverance, and,
having completely estranged the affections
of the Marquis from his wife, whose gentle
goodness and unimpassioned manners had
ceased to please, when contrasted with the
captivations of the Italian, she proceeded
to awaken in his mind the jealousy of pride,
for it was no longer that of love, and even
pointed out to him the person, to whom
<PB N="389" REF="395"/>
she affirmed the Marchioness had sacrificed
her honour; but Laurentini had first ex∣torted
from him a solemn promise to for∣bear
avenging himself upon his rival. This
was an important part of her plan, for she
knew, that, if his desire of vengeance was
restrained towards one party, it would burn
more fiercely towards the other, and he
might then, perhaps, be prevailed on to
assist in the horrible act, which would re∣lease
him from the only barrier, that with∣held
him from making her his wife.</P>
<P>The innocent Marchioness, meanwhile,
observed, with extreme grief, the alteration
in her husband's manners. He became re∣served
and thoughful in her presence; his
conduct was austere, and sometimes even
rude; and he left her, for many hours
together, to weep for his unkindness; and
to form plans for the recovery of his affec∣tion.
His conduct afflicted her the more,
because, in obedience to the command of
her father, she had accepted his hand,
though her affections were engaged to ano∣ther,
whose amiable disposition, she had rea∣son
<PB N="390" REF="396"/>
to believe, would have ensured her hap∣piness.
This circumstance Laurentini had
discovered, soon after her arrival in France,
and had made ample use of it in assisting
her designs upon the Marquis, to whom she
adduced such seeming proof of his wife's
infidelity, that, in the frantic rage of
wounded honour, he consented to destroy
his wife. A slow poison was administered,
and she fell a victim to the jealousy and
subtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty
weakness of her husband.</P>
<P>But the moment of Laurentini's triumph,
the moment, to which she had looked for∣ward
for the completion of all her wishes,
proved only the commencement of a suffer∣ing,
that never left her to her dying hour.</P>
<P>The passion of revenge, which had in part
stimulated her to the commission of this
atrocious deed, died, even at the moment
when it was gratified, and left her to the hor∣rors
of unavailing pity and remorse, which
would probably have empoisoned all the
years she had promised herself with the
<PB N="391" REF="397"/>
Marquis de Villeroi, had her expectations
of an alliance with him been realized. But
he, too, had found the moment of his re∣venge
to be that of remorse, as to himself,
and detestation, as to the partner of his
crime; the feeling, which he had mistaken
for conviction, was no more; and he stood
astonished, and aghast, that no proof re∣mained
of his wife's infidelity, now that she
had suffered the punishment of guilt. Even
when he was informed, that she was dying,
he had felt suddenly and unaccountably re∣assured
of her innocence, nor was the solemn
assurance she made him in her last hour, ca∣pable
of affording him a stronger conviction
of her blameless conduct.</P>
<P>In the first horrors of remorse and despair,
he felt inclined to deliver up himself and
the woman, who had plunged him into this
abyss of guilt, into the hands of justice; but,
when the paroxysm of his suffering was
over, his intention changed. Laurentini,
however, he saw only once afterwards, and
that was, to curse her as the instigator of his
<PB N="392" REF="398"/>
crime, and to say, that he spared her life
only on condition, that she passed the rest
of her days in prayer and penance. Over∣whelmed
with, disappointment, on receiving
contempt and abhorrence from the man, for
whose sake she had not scrupled to stain her
conscience with human blood, and, touched
with horror of the unavailing crime she had
committed, she renounced the world, and
retired to the monastery of St. Claire, a
dreadful victim to unresisted passion.</P>
<P>The Marquis, immediately after the death
of his wife, quitted Chateau-le-Blanc, to
which he never returned, and endeavoured
to lose the sense of his crime amidst the tu∣mult
of war, or the dissipations of a capital;
but his efforts were vain; a deep dejection
hung over him ever after, for which his
most intimate friends could not account,
and he, at length, died, with a degree of
horror nearly equal to that, which Lauren∣tini
had suffered. The physician, who had
observed the singular appearance of the un∣fortunate
Marchioness, after death, had been
<PB N="393" REF="399"/>
bribed to silence; and, as the surmises of a
few of the servants had proceeded no further
than a whisper, the affair had never been
investigated. Whether this whisper ever
reached the father of the Marchioness, and,
if it did, whether the difficulty of obtaining
proof deterred him from prosecuting the
Marquis de Villeroi, is uncertain; but her
death was deeply lamented by some part of
her family, and particularly by her brother,
M. St. Aubert; for that was the degree of re∣lationship,
which had existed between Emily's
father and the Marchioness; and there is no
doubt, that he suspected the manner of her
death. Many letters passed between the
Marquis and him, soon after the decease
of this beloved sister, the subject of which
was not known, but there is reason to be∣lieve,
that they related to the cause of her
death; and these were the papers, together
with some letters of the Marchioness, who
had consided to her brother the occasion of
her unhappiness, which St. Aubert had so
solemnly enjoined his daughter to destroy:
<PB N="394" REF="400"/>
and anxiety for her peace had probably made
him forbid her to enquire into the melan∣choly
story, to which they alluded. Such,
indeed, had been his affliction, on the pre∣mature
death of this his favourite sister,
whose unhappy marriage had from the first
excited his tenderest pity, that he never
could hear her named, or mention her him∣self
after her death, except to Madame St.
Aubert. From Emily, whose sensibility he
feared to awaken, he had so carefully con∣cealed
her history and name, that she was
ignorant, till now, that she ever had such a
relative as the Marchioness de Villeroi; and
from this motive he had enjoined silence to
his only surviving sister, Madame Cheron,
who had scrupulously observed his request.</P>
<P>It was over some of the last pathetic let∣ters
of the Marchioness, that St. Aubert was
weeping, when he was observed by Emily,
on the eye of her departure from La Vallée,
and it was her picture, which he had so ten∣derly
caressed. Her disastrous death may
account for the emotion he had betrayed, on
<PB N="395" REF="401"/>
hearing her named by La Voisin, and for
his request to be interred near the monu∣ment
of the Villerois, where her remains
were deposited, but not those of her husband,
who was buried, where he died, in the north
of France.</P>
<P>The confessor, who attended St. Aubert
in his last moments, recollected him to be
the brother of the late Marchioness, when
St. Aubert, from tenderness to Emily, had
conjured him to conceal the circumstance,
and to request that the abbess, to whose care
he particularly recommended her, would do
the same; a request, which had been exactly
observed.</P>
<P>Laurentini, on her arrival in France, had
carefully concealed her name and family,
and, the better to disguise her real history,
had, on entering the convent, caused the
story to be circulated, which had imposed,
on sister Frances, and it is probable, that the
abbess, who did not preside in the convent,
at the time of her noviciation, was also en∣tirely
ignorant of the truth. The deep re∣morse
<PB N="396" REF="402"/>
that seized on the mind of Laurentini,
together with the sufferings of disappointed
passion, for she still loved the Marquis, again
unsettled her intellects, and, after the first
paroxysms of despair were passed, a heavy
and silent melancholy, had settled upon her
spirits, which suffered few interruptions from
fits of phrensy, till the time of her death.
During many years, it had been her only
amusement to walk in the woods near the
monastery, in the solitary hours of night,
and to play upon a favourite instrument, to
which she sometimes joined. the delightful
melody of her voice, in the most solemn and
melancholy airs of her native country, mo∣dulated
by all the energetic feeling, that
dwelt in her heart. The physician, who had
attended her, recommended it to the supe∣rior
to indulge her in this whim, as the only
means of soothing her distempered fancy;
and she was suffered to walk in the lonely
hours of night, attended by the servant, who
had accompanied her from Italy; but, as
the indulgence transgressed against the rules
<PB N="397" REF="403"/>
of the convent, it was kept as secret as pos∣sible;
and thus the mysterious music of
Laurentini had combined with other cir∣cumstances,
to produce a report, that not
only the chateau, but its neighbourhood,
was haunted.</P>
<P>Soon after her entrance into this holy
community, and before she had shewn any
symptoms of insanity there, she made a will,
in which, after bequeathing a considerable
legacy to the convent, she divided the re∣mainder
of her personal property, which
her jewels made very valuable, between the
wife of Mons. Bonnac, who was an Italian
lady and her relation, and the nearest sur∣viving
relative of the late Marchioness de
Villeroi. As Emily St. Aubert was not
only the nearest, but the sole relative, this
legacy descended to her, and thus explained
to her the whole mystery of her father's
conduct.</P>
<P>The resemblance between Emily and her
unfortunate aunt had frequently been ob∣served
by Laurentini, and had occasioned
<PB N="318" REF="404"/>
the singular behaviour, which had formerly
alarmed her; but it was in the nun's dy∣ing
hour, when her conscience gave her
perpetually the idea of the Marchio∣ness,
that she became more sensible, than
ever, of this likeness, and, in her phrensy,
deemed it no resemblance of the person she
had injured, but the original herself. The
bold assertion, that had followed, on the
recovery of her senses, that Emily was the
daughter of the Marchioness de Villeroi,
arose from a suspicion that she was so;
for, knowing that her rival, when she mar∣ried
the Marquis, was attached to another
lover, she had scarcely scrupled to believe,
that her honour had been sacrificed, like
her own, to an unresisted passion.</P>
<P>Of a crime, however, to which Emily
had suspected, from her phrensied confession
of murder, that she had been instrumental
in the castle of Udolpho, Laurentini was
innocent; and she had herself been deceiv∣ed,
concerning the spectacle, that formerly
occasioned her so much terror, arid had
<PB N="399" REF="405"/>
since compelled her, for a while, to attri∣bute
the horrors of the nun to a conscious∣ness
of a murder, committed in that castle.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that, in a cham∣ber
of Udolpho, hung a black veil, whose
singular situation had excited Emily's curio∣sity,
and which afterwards disclosed an ob∣ject,
that had overwhelmed her with horror;
for, on lifting it, there appeared, instead of
the picture she had expected, within a re∣cess
of the wall, a human figure of ghastly
paleness, stretched at its length, and dressed
in the habiliments of the grave. What added
to the horror of the spectacle, was, that the
face appeared partly decayed and disfigured
by worms, which were visible. on the fea∣tures
and hands. On such an object, it will
be readily believed, that no person could
endure to look twice. Emily, it may be re∣collected,
had, after the first glance, let the
veil drop, and her terror had prevented her
from ever after provoking a renewal of such
suffering, as she had then experienced.
<PB N="400" REF="406"/>
Had she dared to look again, her delusion
and her fears would have vanished together,
and she would have perceived, that the figure
before her was not human, but formed of wax.
The history of it is somewhat extraordinary,
though not without example in the records
of that fierce severity, which monkish su∣perstition
has sometimes inflicted on man∣kind.
A member of the house of Udolpho,
having committed some offence against the
prerogative of the church, had been con∣demned
to the penance of contemplating,
during certain hours of the day, a waxen
image, made to resemble a human body in
the state, to which it is reduced after death.
This penance, serving as a memento of the
condition at which he must himself arrive,
had been designed to reprove the pride of
the Marquis of Udolpho, which had for∣merly
so much exasperated that of the
Romish church; and he had not only su∣perstitiously
observed this penance himself,
which, he had believed, was to obtain a
<PB N="401" REF="407"/>
pardon for all his sins, but had made it a
condition in his will, that his descendants
should preserve the image, on pain of for∣feiting
to the church a certain part of his
domain, that they also might profit by the
humiliating moral it conveyed. The figure,
therefore, had been suffered to retain its
station in the wall of the chamber, but his
descendants excused themselves from ob∣serving
the penance, to which he had been
enjoined.</P>
<P>This image was so horribly natural, that
it is not surprising Emily should have mistaken
it for the object it resembled, nor,
since she had heard such an extraordinary
account, concerning the disappearing of the
late lady of the castle, and had such expe∣rience
of the character of Montoni, that,
she should have believed this to be the mur∣dered
body of the lady Laurentini, and that
he had been the contriver of her death.</P>
<P>The situation, in which she had disco∣vered
it, occasioned her, at first, much sur∣prise
and perplexity; but the vigilance, with
<PB N="402" REF="408"/>
which the doors of the chamber, where it
was deposited, were afterwards secured, had
compelled her to believe, that Montoni,
not daring to confide the secret of her death
to any person, had suffered her remains to
decay in this obscure chamber. The cere∣mony
of the veil, however, and the circum∣stance
of the doors having been left open,
even for a moment, had occasioned her
much wonder and some doubts; but these
were not sufficient to overcome her suspicion
of Montoni; and it was the dread of
his terrible vengeance, that had sealed her
lips in silence, concerning what she had
seen in the west chamber.</P>
<P>Emily, in discovering the Marchioness
de Villeroi to have been the sister of Mons.
St Aubert, was variously affected; but,
amidst. the sorrow, which she suffered for
her untimely death, she was released from
an anxious and painful conjecture, occa∣sioned
by the rash assertion of Signora Lau∣rentini,
concerning her birth and the ho∣nour
of her parents. Her faith in St. Au∣bert's
<PB N="403" REF="409"/>
principles would scarcely allow her to
suspect that he had acted dishonourably; and
she felt such reluctance to believe herself
the daughter of any other, than her, whom
she had always considered and loved as a
mother, that she would hardly admit such
a circumstance to be possible; yet the
likeness, which it had frequently been af∣firmed
she bore to the late Marchioness, the
former behaviour of Dorothée the old
housekeeper, the assertion of Laurentini, and
the mysterious attachment, which St. Au∣bert
had discovered, awakened doubts, as to
his connection with the Marchioness, which
her reason could neither vanquish, or con∣firm.
From these, however, she was now
relieved, and all the circumstances of her
father's conduct were fully explained; but
her heart was oppressed by the melancholy
catastrophe of her amiable relative, and by
the awful lesson, which the history of
the nun exhibited, the indulgence of
whose passions had been the means of lead∣ing
her gradually to the commission of a
<PB N="404" REF="410"/>
crime, from the prophecy of which in her
early years she would have recoiled in hor∣ror,
and exclaimed—that it could not be!—a
crime, which whole years of repentance
and of the severest penance had not been
able to obliterate from her conscience.</P>

<Q><L>—Then, fresh tears</L>
<L>Stood on her cheek, as doth the honey-dew</L>
<L>Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.</L></Q>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER the late discoveries, Emily was
distinguished at the chateau by the Count
and his family, as a relative of the house of
Villeroi, and received, if possible, more
friendly attention, than had yet been shewn
her.</P>
<P>Count De Villefort's surprise at the delay of
an answer to his letter, which had been di∣rected
to Valancourt, at Estuviere, was min∣gled
with satisfaction for the prudence, which
had saved Emily from a share of the anxiety
he now differed, though, when he saw her still
drooping under the effect of his former error,
<PB N="406" REF="412"/>
all his resolution was necessary to restrain him
from relating the truth, that would afford
her a momentary relief. The approaching
nuptials of the Lady Blanche now divided
his attention with this subject of his anxiety,
for the inhabitants of the chateau were al∣ready
busied in preparations for that event,
and the arrival of Mons. St. Foix was daily
expected. In the gaiety, which surrounded
her, Emily vainly tried to participate, her
spirits being depressed by the late discove∣ries
and by the anxiety concerning the fate
of Valancourt, that had been occasioned by
the description of his manner, when he
had delivered the ring. She seemed to per∣ceive
in it the gloomy wildness of despair;
and, when me considered to what that de∣spair
might have urged him, her heart sunk
with terror and grief. The state of suspense,
as to his safety, to which she believed herself
condemned, till she should return to La
Vallée, appeared insupportable, and, in such
moments, she could not even struggle to
<PB N="407" REF="413"/>
assume the composure, that had left her
mind, but would often abruptly quit the
company she was with, and endeavour to
sooth her spirits in the deep solitudes of
the woods, that overbrowed the shore.
Here, the faint roar of foaming waves, that
beat below, and the sullen murmur of the
wind among the branches around, were cir∣cumstances
in unison with the temper of
her mind; and she would sit on a cliff, or
on the broken steps of her favourite watch∣tower,
observing the changing colours of
the evening clouds, and the gloom of twi∣light
draw over the sea, till the white tops
of billows, riding towards the shore, could
scarcely be discerned amidst the darkened
waters. The lines, engraved by Valancourt
on this tower, she frequently repeated with
melancholy enthusiasm, and then would en∣deavour
to check the recollections and the
grief they occasioned, and to turn her
thoughts to indifferent subjects.</P>
<P>One evening, having wandered with her
<PB N="408" REF="414"/>
lute to this her favourite spot, she entered
the ruined tower, and ascended a winding
stair case, that led to a small chamber,
which was less decayed than the rest of the
building;, and whence she had often gazed,
with admiration, on the wide prospect of
sea and land, that extended below. The
sun was now setting on that tract of the
Pyrenées, which divides Languedoc from
Rousillon, and, placing herself opposite to
a small grated window, which, like the
wood-tops beneath, and the waves lower still,
gleamed with the red glow of the west, she
touched the chords of her lute in solemn
symphony, and then accompanied it with
her voice, in one of the simple and affecting
airs, to which, in happier days, Valancourt
had often listened in rapture, and which
she now adapted to the following lines.</P>
<Q><PB N="409" REF="415"/><LG>
<HEAD>TO MELANCHOLY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Spirit of love and sorrow—hail!</L>
<L>Thy solemn voice from far I hear,</L>
<L>Mingling with ev'ning's dying gale:</L>
<L>Hail, with this sadly-pleasing tear!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! at this still, this lonely hour,</L>
<L>Thine own sweet hour of closing day,</L>
<L>Awake thy lute, whose charmful pow'r</L>
<L>Shall call up Fancy to obey:</L>

<L>The minster's moon-light aisles along,</L>
<L>Where spectres raise the midnight chaunt.</L>

<L>I hear their dirges faintly swell!</L>

<LG>
<L>Or guide me, where the dashing oar</L>
<L>Just breaks the stillness of the vale,</L>
<L>As flow it tracks the winding shore,</L>

<L>And wild the winds of autumn sweep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There pause at midnight's spectred hour,</L>
<L>And list the long-resounding gale;</L>
<L>And catch the fleeting moon-light's pow'r,</L>
<L>O'er foaming seas and distant sail.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q>
<P>The soft tranquillity of the scene below,
where the evening breeze scarely curled
the water, of swelled the passing sail, that
<PB N="411" REF="417"/>
caught the last gleam of the sun, and where,
now and then, a dipping oar was all that
disturbed the trembling radiance, conspired
with the tender melody of her lute to lull
her mind into a state of gentle sadness,
and she sung the mournful songs of
past times, till the remembrances they
awakened were too powerful for her heart,
her tears fell upon the lute, over which she
drooped, and her voice trembled, and was
unable to proceed.</P>
<P>Though the sun had now sunk behind
the mountains, and even his reflected light
was fading from their highest points, Emily
did not leave the watch-tower, but conti∣nued
to indulge her melancholy reverie,
till a footstep, at a little distance, startled
her, and, on looking through the grate, she
observed a person walking below, whom,
however, soon perceiving to be Mons. Bon∣nac,
she returned to the quiet thoughtfulness
his step had interrupted. After some time,
she again struck her lute, and sung her fa∣vourite
air; but again a step disturbed her,
<PB N="412" REF="418"/>
and, as she paused to listen, she heard it
ascending the stair-case of the tower. The
gloom of the hour, perhaps, made her sensible
to some degree of fear, which she
might not otherwife have felt; for, only a
few minutes before, she had seen. Mons.
Bonnac pass. The steps were quick and
bounding, and, in the next moment, the
door of the chamber opened, and a per∣son
entered, whose features were veiled in
the obscurity of twilight; but his voice
could not be concealed, for it was the voice
of Valancourt! At the sound, never heard
by Emily, without emotion, she started,
in terror, astonishment and doubtful plea∣sure,
and had scarcely beheld him at, her
feet, when she sunk into a seat, overcome
by the various emotions, that contended at
her heart, and almost insensible to that voice,
whose earnest and trembling calls seemed
as if endeavouring to save her. Valancourt,
as he hung over Emily, deplored his own
rash impatience, in having thus surprised
her: for when he had arrived at the chateau,
<PB N="413" REF="419"/>
too anxious to await the return of the
Count, who, he understood, was in the
grounds, he went himself to seek him, when,
as he passed the tower, he was struck by
the sound of Emily's voice, and immedi∣ately
ascended.</P>
<P>It was a considerable time before she re∣vived,
but, when her recollection returned,
she repulsed his attentions, with an air of
reserve, and enquired, with as much dis∣pleasure
as it was possible she could feel in
these first moments of his appearance, the
occasion of his visit.</P>
<P>"Ah Emily!" said Valancourt, "that
air, those words—alas! I have, then, little
to hope—when you ceased to esteem me,
you ceased also to love me!"</P>
<P>"Most true, sir," replied Emily, endea∣vouring
to command her trembling voice;
"and if you had valued my esteem, you
would not have given me this new occa∣sion
for uneasiness."</P>
<P>Valancourt's countenance changed sud∣denly
from the anxieties of doubt to an ex∣pression
<PB N="414" REF="420"/>
of surprise and dismay: he was
silent a moment, and then said, "I had
been taught to hope for a very different re∣ception!
Is it, then true, Emily, that
I have lost your regard, forever? am I
to believe, that, though your esteem for
me may return—your affection never can?
Can the Count have meditated the cruelty,
which now tortures me with a second
death?"</P>
<P>The voice, in which he spoke this,
alarmed Emily as much as his words sur∣prised
her, and, with trembling impatience,
she begged that he would explain them.</P>
<P>"Can any explanation be necessary?"
said Valancourt, "do you not know how
cruelly my conduct has been misrepresented?
that the actions of which you once believed
me guilty (and, O Emily! how could you
so degrade me in your opinion, even for a
moment!) those actions—I hold in as much
contempt and abhorrence as yourself?
Are you, indeed, ignorant, that Count De
Villefort has detected the slanders, that have
<PB N="415" REF="421"/>
robbed me of all I hold dear on earth, and
has invited me hither to justify to you my
former conduct? It is surely impossible
you can be uninformed of these circum∣stances,
and I am again torturing myself
with a false hope!</P>
<P>The silence of Emily confirmed this sup∣position;
for the deep twilight would not
allow Valancourt to distinguish the astonish∣ment
and doubting joy, that fixed her fea∣tures.
For a moment, she continued unable
to speak; then a profound sigh deemed to
give some relief to her spirits, and she
said,</P>
<P>"Valancourt! I was, till this moment,
ignorant of all the circumstances you have
mentioned; the emotion I now suffer may
assure you of the truth of this, and, that,
though I had ceased to esteem, I had not
taught myself entirely to forget you."</P>
<P>"This moment," said Valancourt, in a
low voice, and leaning for support against
the window—"this moment brings with
it a conviction that overpowers me!—I am
<PB N="416" REF="422"/>
dear to you then—still dear to you my
Emily!"</P>
<P>"Is it necessary that I should tell you to:"
she replied, "is it necessary, that I should
say—these are the first moments of joy
I have known, since your departure, and
that they repay me for all those of pain I
have suffered in the interval?"</P>
<P>"Valancourt sighed deeply and was un∣able
to reply but as the pressed her hand
to his lips the tears that fell over it spoke
a language, which could not be mis∣taken,
and to which words were inade∣quate.</P>
<P>Emily, somewhat tranquillized, pro∣posed
returning to the chateau, and then,
for the first time recollected that the Count
had invited Valancourt thither to explain
his conduct, and that no explanation had
yet been given. But, while she acknow∣ledged,
this, her heart would not allow her
to dwell, for a moment, on the possibility of
his unworthiness; his look, his voice, his
manner, all spoke the noble sincerity, which
<PB N="417" REF="423"/>
had formerly distinguished him; and she
again permitted herself to indulge the emo∣tions
of a joy, more surprising and power∣ful,
than she had ever before experienced.</P>
<P>Neither Emily or Valancourt were con∣scious
how they reached the chateau whi∣ther
they might have been transferred by
the spell of a fairy for any thing they could
remember; and it was not till they had
reached the great hall, that either of them
recollected there were other persons in the
world besides themselves The count then
came forth with surprise and with the joy∣fulness
of pure benevolence to welcome
Valancourt and to entreat his forgivenness
of the injustice he had done him soon
after which Mons. Bonnac joined this
happy group, in which, he and Valancourt
were mutually rejoiced to meet.</P>
<P>When the first congratulations were over,
and the general joy became somewhat more
tranquil, the Count withdrew with Valan∣court
to the library, where a long conver∣sation
palled between them, in which the
<PB N="418" REF="424"/>
latter so clearly justified himself of the cri∣minal
parts of the conduct, imputed to
him, and so candidly confessed and so feel
ingly lamented the follies, which he had
committed, that the Count was confirmed
in the belief of all he had hoped; and,
while he perceived so many noble virtues
in Valancourt, and that experience had
taught him to detest the follies, which be∣fore
he had only not admired, he did not
scruple to believe, that he would pass
through life with the dignity of a wise and
good man, or to entrust to his care the fu∣ture
happiness of Emily St. Aubert, for
whom he felt the solicitude of a parent.
Of this he soon informed her, in a short
conversation, when Valancourt had left
him. While Emily listened to a relation
of the services, that Valancourt had ren∣dered
Mons. Bonnac, her eyes overslowed
with tears of pleasure, and the further con∣versation
of Count De Villefort perfectly
dissipated every doubt, as to the past and fu∣ture
conduct of him, to whom the now re∣stored,
<PB N="419" REF="425"/>
without fear, the esteem and affec∣tion,
with which she had formerly received
him.</P>
<P>When they returned to the supper-room,
the Countess and Lady Blanche met Va∣lancourt
with sincere congratulations; and
Blanche, indeed, was so much rejoiced to
see Emily returned to happiness, as to for∣get,
for a while, that Mons. St. Foix was
not yet arrived at the chateau, though he
had been expected for some hours; but her
generous sympathy was, soon after, re∣warded
by his appearance. He was now
perfectly recovered from the wounds, re∣ceived,
during his perilous adventure
among the Pyrenées, the mention of which
served to heighten to the parties, who had
been involved in it, the sense of their pre∣sent
happiness. New congratulations passed
between them, and round the supper-table
appeared a group of faces, smiling with
felicity, but with a felicity, which had in
each a different character. The smile of
<PB N="420" REF="426"/>
Blanche was frank and gay, that of Emily
tender and pensive; Valancourt's was rap∣turous,
tender and gay alternately; Mons.
St. Foix's was joyous, and that of the
Count, as he looked on the surrounding
party, expressed the tempered complacency
of benevolence; while the features of the
Countess, Henri, and Mons. Bonnac, dis∣covered
fainter traces of animation. Poor
Mons. Dupont did not, by his presence,
throw a shade of regret over the company;
for when he had discovered, that Valan∣court
was not unworthy of the esteem of
Emily, he determined seriously to endea∣vour
at the conquest of his own hopeless
affection, and had immediately withdrawn
from Chateau-le-Blanc—a conduct, which
Emily now understood, and rewarded with
her admiration and pity.</P>
<P>The Count and his guests continued to∣gether
till a late hour, yielding to the de∣lights
of social gaiety, and to the sweets of
friendship. When Annette heard of the
<PB N="421" REF="427"/>
arrival of Valancourt, Ludovico had some
difficulty to prevent her going into the
supper-room, to express her joy, for she
declared, that she had never been so re∣joiced
at any <HI>accident</HI> as this, since she had
found Ludovico himself.</P>

<P>THE marriages of the Lady Blanche
and Emily St. Aubert were celebrated, on
the same day, and with the ancient baronial
magnificence, at Chateau-le-Blanc. The
feasts were held in the great hall of
the castle, which, on this occasion, was
hung with superb new tapestry, represent∣ing
the exploits of Charlemagne and his
twelve peers; here, were seen the Saracens,
with their horrible visors, advancing to
battle; and there, were displayed the wild
<PB N="423" REF="429"/>
solemnities of incantation, and the necro∣mantic
feats, exhibited by the magician
<HI>Jarl</HI> before the Emperor. The sumptuous
banners of the family of Villeroi, which
had long slept in dust, were once more un∣furled,
to wave over the gothic points of
painted casements; and music echoed, in
many a lingering close, through every wind∣ing
gallery and colonnade of that vast
edifice.</P>
<P>As Annette looked down from the cor∣ridor
upon the hall, whose arches and
windows were illuminated with brilliant
festoons of lamps, and gazed on the splen∣did
dresses of the dancers, the costly live∣ries
of the attendants, the canopies of pur∣ple
velvet and gold, and listened to the gay
strains that floated along the vaulted roof,
she almost fancied herself in an en∣chanted
palace, and declared, that she had
not met with any place, which charmed
her so much, since she read the fairy tales;
nay, that the fairies themselves, at their
<PB N="424" REF="430"/>
nightly revels in this old hall, could display
nothing finer; while old Dorothée, as she
surveyed the scene, sighed, and said, the
castle looked as it was wont to do in the
time of her youth.</P>
<P>After gracing the festivities of Chateau∣le-Blanc,
for some days, Valancourt and
Emily took leave of their kind friends, and
returned to La Vallée, where the faithful
Theresa received them with unseigned joy,
and the pleasant shades welcomed them
with a thousand tender and affecting re∣membrances;
and, while they wandered
together over the scenes, so long inhabited
by the late Mons. and Madame St. Aubert,
and Emily pointed out, with pensive af∣fection,
their favourite haunts, her present
happiness was heightened, by consider∣ing,
that it would have been worthy of
their approbation, could they have wit∣nessed
it.</P>
<P>Valancourt led her to the plane tree on
the terrace, where he had first ventured
<PB N="425" REF="431"/>
to declare his love, and where now the re∣membrance
of the anxiety he had then suf∣fered,
and the retrospect of all the dangers
and misfortunes they had each encountered,
since last they sat together beneath its
broad branches, exalted the sense of their
present felicity, which, on this spot, sacred
to the memory of St. Aubert, they solemnly
vowed to deserve, as far as possible, by
endeavouring to imitate his benevolence,—by
remembering, that superior attainments
of every fort bring with them duties of
superior exertion,—and by affording to their
fellow-beings, together with that portion of
ordinary comforts, which prosperity always
owes to misfortune, the example of lives
passed in happy thankfulness to GOD, and,
therefore, in careful tenderness to his crea∣tures.</P>
<P>Soon after their return to La Vallée,
the brother of Valancourt came to congra∣tulate
him on his marriage, and to pay his
respects to Emily, with whom he was so
much pleased, as well as with the prospect
<PB N="426" REF="432"/>
of rational happiness, which these nuptials
offered to Valancourt, that he immediately
resigned to him a part of the rich domain,
the whole of which, as he had no family,
would of course descend to his brother, on
his decease.</P>
<P>The estates, at Tholouse, were disposed
of, and Emily purchased of Mons. Ques∣nel
the ancient domain of her late father,
where, having given Annette a marriage∣portion,
she settled her as the housekeeper,
and Ludovico as the steward; but, since
both Valancourt and herself preferred the
pleasant and long-loved shades of La Vallée
to the magnificence of Epourville, they
continued to reside there, passing, however,
a few months in the year at the birth-place
of St. Aubert, in tender respect to his me∣mory.</P>
<P>The legacy, which had been bequeathed
to Emily by Signora Laurentini, she beg∣ged
Valancourt would allow her to resigh
to Mons. Bonnac; and Valancourt, when
<PB N="427" REF="433"/>
she made the request, felt all the value of
the compliment it conveyed. The castle
of Udolpho, also, descended to the wife of
Mons. Bonnac, who was the nearest surviv∣ing
relation of the house of that name, and
thus affluence restored his long-oppressed
spirits to peace, and his family to com∣fort.</P>
<P>O! how joyful it is to tell of happiness,
such as that of Valancourt and Emily; to
relate, that, after suffering under the op∣pression
of the vicious and the disdain of
the weak, they were, at length, restored to
each other—to the beloved landscapes of
their native country,—to the securest feli∣city
of this life, that of aspiring to moral
and labouring for intellectual improve∣ment—to
the pleasures of enlightened
society, and to the exercise of the benevo∣lence,
which had always animated their
hearts; while the bowers of La Vallée be∣came,
once more, the retreat of goodness,
wisdom and domestic blessedness!</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="434"/>
O! useful-may it be to have shewn,
that, though the vicious can sometimes
pour affliction upon the good, their power
is transient and their punishment certain;
and that innocence, though oppressed by
injustice, shall, supported by patience,
finally triumph over misfortune!</P>
<P>And, if the weak hand, that has re∣corded,
this tale, has, by its scenes, be∣guiled
the mourner of one hour of sorrow,
or, by its moral, taught him to sustain it—the
effort, however humble, has not
been vain, nor is the writer unrewarded.</P>
