<HEAD>An Account of the
State of Learning
IN THE
Empire of <HI>Lilliput.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I always had a
strong Inclination
to Reading, from
the Time I first
went to <HI>Emanuel</HI>-College
in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and had
gone through the most valuable
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
ancient Writers; during my stay
in <HI>Lilliput,</HI> I was very inquisitive
about the state of Learning in
that Nation, and received the
following Information upon that
Subject.</P>
<P>IN former Ages, the Govern∣ment
of the Island <HI>Blefuscu</HI> was,
in many respects, like what we
call a Commonwealth, and for
a long time flourished both in
Arms and Learning, whilst the
<HI>Lilliputians</HI> were a barbarous
People; at this Time many ex∣cellent
Books were wrote in
Oratory, Poetry, History, and
Philosophy, but the <HI>Blefuscudi∣ans</HI>
having at length lost their
Liberties and Form of Govern∣ment,
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
which was changed into
an Empire, Learning decay'd a∣mongst
them very fast; the
faster by reason of hot Dis∣putes
which arose concerning
the proper manner of Dressing
and Eating Eggs; and in these
the whole Studies of all the
Learned Men of that Age were
consumed.</P>
<P>THE first Emperor of <HI>Ble∣fuscu,</HI>
that he might ingratiate
himself with his People, whom
he had enslaved, undertook an
Expedition against the Island of
<HI>Lilliput</HI>; which being then go∣verned
by several petty Kings,
ignorant of the Arts of War,
was, by Degrees, subdued to the
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Empire of <HI>Blefuscu.</HI> During
this Intercourse between the two
Nations, the <HI>Blefuscudian</HI> Lan∣guage
was very much changed,
by the mixture of the <HI>Lillipu∣tian</HI>;
and those Authors who
wrote in the old Language were
neglected, and understood by
very few.</P>
<P>IN process of Time the <HI>Lil∣liputians</HI>
grew weary of Sub∣jection,
flung off the Foreign
Yoke, set up an Emperor of
their own with great Success,
and ever since have been a di∣stinct
Empire from that of <HI>Blefuscu.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
As they were an Ingenious
People, and blessed with a Race
of good Emperors, they soon
excelled their Neighbours in
Learning and Arms; they got
together all the old <HI>Blefuscudian</HI>
Books, their Emperor founded
a <HI>Gomflastru,</HI> or Seminary, with
different Schools, to instruct
their Youth in the old <HI>Blefus∣cudian</HI>
Language and Learning;
and from thence chose their
<HI>Nardacs, Glumglums,</HI> and <HI>Hurgos,</HI>
and the Emperors had them∣selves
a large Collection of
these Books in a Library belong∣ing
to the Palace.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Lilliputians</HI> flou∣rished
in Politeness and Litera∣ture,
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
for some Ages; till at
length, by the Plenty of a long
Peace, they also grew Corrupt,
gave themselves up to Idleness,
Luxury, and Intriguing, and
fell into Controversies about
breaking their Eggs; the old
<HI>Blefuscudian</HI> Books were laid
aside, and nothing regarded but
Eggs and Politicks. The <HI>Gom∣flastru</HI>
indeed continued, each
School had its <HI>Mulro,</HI> or Gover∣nour
and Scholars; but the
taste of the Age being changed,
they only turned over the old
Authors to amuse themselves,
and enjoy'd the moderate Reve∣nues
bequeathed to them by for∣mer
Emperors. The present
Emperor indeed had endeavour'd
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
to bring them into Esteem again,
he encreased their Possessions,
and gave a Noble Present of
Books to the <HI>Gomflastru</HI>; but
having a debauched inconstant
People to rule over, and be∣ing
kept in continual Alarms of
Wars by his Neighbours, he
had not leisure to perfect his
good Intentions.</P>
<P>I was at this Time in his
Favour, and when He heard
that I had been inquisitive a∣bout
these Affairs, He very
graciously desired me to look
into his Library, and sent Or∣ders
to the Keeper of it to use
me with great Respect, and to
present me with Five Hun∣dred
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Books, such as I should
choose.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, upon a Day
appointed, I went to the Li∣brary,
which I took a view of
in the same manner as I had
done of the rest of the palace,
by lying down and looking in
at the Window: The Building
was ruinous, the Inside dusty,
the Books many in Number,
but scattered about in great
Disorder; the Library-Keeper,
whose Name is BULLUM, was
alone stalking amidst the Rub∣bish.
As soon as he saw my
Face at the Window, he made
his best Bow, and began his
Speech to me, which, as I was
afterwards informed, he had
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
taken a great deal of Pains a∣bout,
knowing me to be in the
Emperor's good Graces. Most
part of what he spoke was
unintelligible to me, by a ridi∣culous
Mixture of the old
<HI>Blefuscudian</HI> Language: And
what I did understand was
fulsome Flattery, and Comple∣ments
that nothing mortal could
deserve.</P>
<P>THIS was very dull Enter∣tainment
to a Man of my Mo∣desty,
and thereupon finding
his Speech would be long, and
that he was forced to strain
his Voice to make me hear at
that distance; I thought it
would be a kindness to us both
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
to put a stop to him, which
I did, returning him Thanks,
in few Words, for his great
Opinion of me, and desired to
see him the next Day, that I
might choose out the Five Hun∣dred
Books which the Emperor
had given me.</P>
<P>BULLUM, as I heard after∣wards,
was in great Wrath,
and loaded me with many op∣probrious
Names, for refusing
to hear his Speech out, and
daring to treat a Man of his
Learning with so little respect.
However, he stifled his Resent∣ment
a little for the present,
and came to me at the Time
appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
I DESIRED him to shew
me a Catalogue of the Books,
and to give me some Account
of what they treated of, that
I might be able to make a
Choice. He replied, That he
had not troubled himself to
bring a written Catalogue, but
that he had one in his Memory,
and immediately he repeated to
me the Titles of a vast Num∣ber
of old <HI>Blefuscudian</HI> Books,
and run on with a great flu∣ency
of Speech, till he was out
of Breath.</P>
<P>IT was a Pain to me to for∣bear
Laughing, to hear BULLUM
sputter out so much Jargon;
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
at last I told him, That I was
not in the least wiser for what
he had said, because I under∣stood
not a Syllable of the Lan∣guage
he spoke. At that, as
he stood on the Table before
me, he put out his Under-Lip▪
and staring me full in the Face,
said, with a great deal of Con∣tempt,
<HI>Not understand</HI> Blefuscu∣dian!
<HI>What do you understand?</HI></P>
<P>I WAS a little Discomposed
at this Treatment; but not
knowing then what Interest he
had at Court, I resolved to use
him Civilly; and replied, That
I understood eight or nine Lan∣guages,
if there was any Merit
in that; but that none of the
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
Books in his Library would be
of any Use to me, that were
not written in <HI>Lilliputian. Lil∣liputian!</HI>
says he, <HI>I cannot re∣peat
the Titles of many of them,
but I will send you Five Hun∣dred
in a few Days:</HI> And thus
he left me.</P>
<P>I WAS very impatient to re∣ceive
this curious Present; but
BULLUM broke his Word; for
about this Time my Interest
at Court began to decline. I
could not prevail upon him to
deliver the Books to me: At
last, after much Importunity,
he came to me himself, atten∣ded
by a Servant, with only
Five Books.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
I WAS surprized at this, and
asked if the rest were upon the
Road: He answer'd, That since
he had seen me last, he had
spent some Days in carefully
perusing the Emperor's Orders;
that he had discovered the
Word <HI>Hundred</HI> to be an In∣terpolation;
and that the true
Reading was <HI>Five</HI> Books, which,
in Obedience to the Emperor,
he had brought me.</P>
<P>I HAD indeed been put off
so long, that I suspected I
should have had none, and
therefore agreed to have the
Five Books, designing to have
made my Complaint afterwards,
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
but BULLUM had another
Trick to play me. It was the
Custom, he said, for all Stran∣gers
to make him a Com∣plement
in Writing, which he
desired me to comply with, and
then he would deliver the Books
to me. He had brought the
Form, which I was to transcribe
and sign with my own Name.
The Words were these:</P>
<Q><P>Be it known to all Men,
That BULLUM the Great
Library-Keeper to the Empe∣ror
of <HI>Lilliput,</HI> and <HI>Mulro</HI>
in the <HI>Gomflastru,</HI> is a Man
of vast Erudition and Learn∣ing;
all Parts of the World
ring with his Praises; and
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
whilst I was honoured with
his Acquaintance, he used me
with singular Humanity.</P><P><HI>Quinbus Flestrin.</HI></P></Q>
<P>OUT of an earnest Desire
to get Possession of the Books,
I submitted even to this Demand
of BULLUM, who then ordering
them to be flung down before
me, turned nimbly upon his
Heel and left me. He had
picked out for me the Five
worst Books in the Library,
according to his Judgment; but
when I came to peruse them
with a Microscope, (the biggest
being a Folio about half an Inch
long) I found they were very
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
Curious in their kind, but treat∣ing
of Subjects that BULLUM
was not conversant in. There
was,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Collection of Poetry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An Essay on Humility; ne∣cessary
for all <HI>Lilliputians,</HI> who
are very much inclined to think
well of themselves, and meanly
of others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A Dissertation upon <HI>Tra∣mecsans</HI>
and <HI>Slamecsans,</HI> or High-heel'd
and Low-heel'd Shoes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. A Bundle of Controversies
concerning the primitive way of
breaking Eggs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>Blundecral,</HI> or <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/></HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"/>
THESE Books I brought safe
with me to <HI>England,</HI> and design
either to publish them, or else
to present them to the Univer∣sity
which I had once the Ho∣nour
to be a Member of.</P>
<P>BUT to return to BULLUM.
I was amazed at his Behaviour
towards me, especially consider∣ing
I was a <HI>Nardac,</HI> to which
Title he generally paid a pro∣found
Respect. This made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
desirous of getting an Account
of his History and Character,
which, having something extra∣ordinary
in them, I shall lay be∣fore
my Reader.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21"/>
BULLUM is a tall raw-bon'd
Man, I believe near six Inches
and an half high; from his In∣fancy
he apply'd himself, with
great Industry, to the old <HI>Ble∣fuscudian</HI>
Language, in which he
made such a Progress, that he
almost forgot his native <HI>Lillipu∣tian</HI>;
and at this Time he can
neither Write nor speak two
Sentences, without a Mixture of
old <HI>Blefuscudian</HI>: These Qua∣lifications,
joined to an undaun∣ted
forward Spirit, and a few
good Friends, prevail'd with the
Emperor's Grandfather to make
him Keeper of his Library, and
a <HI>Mulro</HI> in the <HI>Gomflastru</HI>; tho'
most Men thought him fitter to
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
be one of the Royal Guards.
These Places soon helped him
to Riches, and upon the Strength
of them he soon began to de∣spise
every Body, and to be de∣spised
by every Body. This en∣gaged
him in many Quarrels,
which he managed in a very odd
manner; whenever he thought
himself affronted, he immediately
flung a great Book at his Ad∣versary,
and, if he could, fell'd
him to the Earth; but if his
Adversary stood his Ground and
flung another Book at him,
which was sometimes done with
great Violence, then he com∣plain'd
to the Grand Justiciary,
that these Affronts were designed
to the Emperor, and that he was
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>
singled out only as being the
Emperor's Servant. By this
Trick he got that Great Officer
to favour him, which made his
Enemies Cautious, and him In∣solent.</P>
<P>BULLUM attended the Court
some Years, but could not get
into an higher Post; for though
he constantly wore the Heels of
his Shoes High or Low, as the
Fashion was, yet having a long
Back and a stiff Neck, he never
could, with any dexterity, creep
under the Stick, which the Em∣peror
or the Chief Minister held.
As to his dancing on the Rope,
I shall speak of it presently;
but the greatest Skill at that
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
Art will not procure a Man a
Place at Court, without some
Agility at the Stick.</P>
<P>BULLUM, vexed at these
Disappointments, withdrew from
Court, and only appeared there
upon extraordinary Occasions, at
other Times he retired to his
Post of <HI>Mulro</HI> in the <HI>Gomflatu,</HI>
there he led a gloomy solitary
Life, heaped up Wealth, and
pored upon the old <HI>Blefuscu∣dian</HI>
Books. It might have been
expected, that from so long an
Acquaintance with those admi∣rable
Writers, he should have
grown more Polite and Humane;
but his Manner was never to
regard the Sence or Subject of
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
the Author, but only the Shape
of the Letters, in which he
arrived to such Perfection, that,
as I have been assured, he
could tell, very near, in what
Year of the <HI>Blefuscudian</HI> Com∣monwealth
any Book was writ∣ten;
and to this, and to re∣storing
the old Characters that
were effaced, all his Labour
was confined.</P>
<P>UPON these Points he had
wrote several Books, some in
the <HI>Blefuscudian,</HI> and some in
the mixed Language; and when∣ever
he had finished a Book,
he presented it to some Great
Man at Court, with a Panegy∣rical
Oration; so contrived that
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
it would fit any Man in a great
Post; and the highest Bidder
had it.</P>
<P>WHILST I was in <HI>Lilliput,</HI>
he proposed to publish a new
<HI>Blundecral</HI> of <HI>Alcoran</HI>; and, that
he might do something uncom∣mon,
he began at the End, and
designed to have wrote back∣wards;
but the <HI>Lilliputians,</HI>
some liking the old <HI>Blundecral,</HI>
others not caring for any, gave
him no encouragement; and
therefore he desisted from that
Project.</P>
<P>As this Nation was very
much divided about breaking
their Eggs, which they gene∣rally
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
eat in Publick once a Day,
or at least once in Seven Days,
I desired to know how BUL∣LUM
behaved himself in this
particular; and was told,
That he was thought to have
an Aversion to Eggs, for he
was never seen to eat any in
Publick, but once or twice in a
Year, when his Post obliged him
to it: At those Times he gave
Orders to have them served up
to him ready Dressed, and the
Shells and Whites being care∣fully
taken off, he gulped up
the Yolks in a very indecent
manner, and immediately drank
a Bumper of strong Liquor after
them, to wash the Taste out
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
of his Mouth, and promote the
Digestion of them.</P>
<P>WHEN any one represented
to him the ill Example of this
Practice, his Answer was, That
his Modesty would not let him
devour Eggs in Publick, when
he had so many Eyes upon
him; That he was not yet de∣termined
at which End he ought
to break them; That the Shells
and Whites were insipid, and only
fit for Children; But for the
Eggs themselves, he was so far
from hating them, that he had
a Dish at his own Table every
Day. But whether this was
Truth, or if they were at
his Table, whether he eat of
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
them or not, I could never
learn.</P>
<P>BULLUM was always of an
haughty Mind, and, in his own
School, took a great deal of
Pleasure in mimicking the Acti∣ons
of the Emperor. Thus,
he got a little Stick and used
to divert himself in seeing his
Scholars leap over, and creep
under it, as he held it between
his Hands. Those who per∣formed
best, were rewarded,
sometimes, with a pompous
Title in the old <HI>Blefuscudian</HI>
Language, signifying, MOST
LEARNED, MOST FAMOUS,
MOST ACCOMPLISHED YOUTH,
or the like: Sometimes with
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
little Sugar-Plums; and some∣times
only with the Promise of
them.</P>
<P>IN dancing on the Ropes
he took great delight himself;
and this was the only Bodily
Exercise he used. Those who
had been Eye-witnesses, inform∣ed
me, that he could cut a
Caper very high, but that he
did it in a clumsy manner,
and with little delight to the
Spectators, who were in conti∣nual
apprehensions of his fal∣ling,
which sometimes he did
very dangerously.</P>
<P>IT was observed, that he
danced best in his own House,
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
but that he never danced be∣fore
the <HI>Gomflastru</HI> with Suc∣cess.
When he first came to
his Place of <HI>Mulro,</HI> he did
nothing but Dance and cut
Capers on the Ropes, for a
Year together: As this was
a new Sport in that Part of
the Island, he got a great deal
of Money by it; but striving
to leap higher than ordinary,
he fell off from the Rope,
broke his Head, and disordered
his Brain so much, that most
People thought it would inca∣pacitate
him for his Post of
<HI>Mulro:</HI> However, at length,
he pretty well recovered; he
himself says, he is as well,
or better, than he was before
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
his Fall: But his Enemies
think his Brain is still affected
by it.</P>
<P>SOME Years after, the pre∣sent
Emperor, in a Progress
through his Dominions, came
to the <HI>Gomflastru</HI>; and BUL∣LUM,
without being asked, was
resolved to divert His Majesty
with his Performance on the
Strait-Rope; up he mounts, and
Capers bravely, for some time;
at last, endeavouring to shew
the utmost of his Skill, in the
midst of an high Caper, he
reached out his Right-Hand too
far, which gave him a terrible
Fall.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="33"/>
MOST People imputed it to
his Over-reaching himself; but
he laid the Fault partly upon
the Robes he was obliged to
wear before the Emperour,
which, as he said, entangled
his Feet; and partly upon the
maliciousness of a Bye-stander,
whom he accused of pulling
the Rope aside, as he was in
the midst of his Caper: How∣ever
that was, poor BULLUM
broke his Leg, and was carried
to his own House, where he
continued Lame above Two
Years, not being able to shew
himself in Publick all that Time;
and it was thought he would
never have recovered, if the
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
Emperor at last, had not taken
pity on him, and sent one of
his own Surgeons to him, who
cured him immediately.</P>
<P>AFTER all these Misfor∣tunes
BULLUM could not for∣sake
his beloved Diversion, but
as soon as he was recovered,
he forgot all that was past,
and danced again in his own
School every Day; where, by
his frequent Falls he so bruised
himself, that it was believed
they would come to a Mor∣tification:
Besides, he dances
so long upon the same Rope,
that through Age and Rotten∣ness,
and his great Weight, it
must break at last; and the
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
Emperor would scarce lend him
a Surgeon a second Time; which
indeed would be in vain, for
he can never leave off the
Sport, though he performs worse
and worse every Day; so that,
in all probability, he will break
his Neck for a Conclusion.</P>
