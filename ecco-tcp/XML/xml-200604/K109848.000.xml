<HEAD>Hearts of Oak.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COme chear up my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,</L>
<L>to add somthing new to this wonderfull year</L>
<L>To honour we call you, not press you like slaves</L>
<L>For who is so free as we sons of the waves?</L>
<L>Hearts of oak are our ships, hearts of oak are our men,</L>
<L>We always are ready;</L>
<L>Steddy, boys, steddy;</L>
<L>We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We never meet our foes but we wish them to stay,</L>
<L>They never meet us but they wish us away:</L>
<L>If they run then we follow, and drive them ashore,</L>
<L>For if they wont fight us, we cannot do more.</L>
<L>Hearts of Oak are our ships, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Monsieur Thurot in the absence of Boyce,</L>
<L>Went over to Ireland to brag the dear joys;</L>
<L>Near Man, Elliot met him, and gave him a blow,</L>
<L>Which sent him to tell it to Pluto below,</L>
<L>Hearts of oak are our ships, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They talk to invade us, these terrible foes,</L>
<L>They frighten our women, our children, and beaux</L>
<L>But if their flat bottoms in darkness come o'er,</L>
<L>Sure Britons they'll find to receive them on shore,</L>
<L>Hearts of oak are our ships, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We'll make them to run, and we'll make them to sweat</L>
<L>In spite of the devil and Brussels Gazette.</L>
<L>Then chear up my lads, with one heart let us sing</L>
<L>Our soldiers, our sailors, our statesmen, and king,</L>
<L>Hearts of oak are our ships, &amp;c.</L>

<HEAD>Clout the Cauldron.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HAve you any pots or pans?</L>
<L>Or any broken chandlers?</L>
<L>I am tinkler to my trade.</L>
<L>And newly come frae Fanders.</L>
<L>As scant of silver as of grace,</L>
<L>Disbanded we've a bad run;</L>
<L>Gar tell the lady of the place,</L>
<L>I'm come to clout her caldron,</L>
<L>Fa adri, didle, didle, &amp;c.</L>
<L>Madam, if you have any wark for me</L>
<L>I'll do't to your contentment,</L>
<L>And dinna care a single flea,</L>
<L>for any man's resentment;</L>
<L>For lady fair tho' I appear</L>
<L>To every one a tinker,</L>
<L>Yet to yourself I'm bold to tell,</L>
<L>I am a gentle jinker,</L>
<L>Fa adri, didle, &amp;c.</L>
<L>Love Jupiter into a swan</L>
<L>turn'd for his lovely Leda;</L>
<L>He like a bull o'er meadows ran,</L>
<L>to carry aff Europa:</L>
<L>Then may not I as well as he,</L>
<L>to hear your Argos blinker,</L>
<L>And win your love like mighty Jove</L>
<L>Thus hide me in a tinker?</L>
<L>Fa adri, didle, &amp;c.</L>
<L>Sir you appear a cunning man,</L>
<L>But this fine plot you'll fail in,</L>
<L>For there is neither pot nor pan,</L>
<L>of mine you'll drive a nail in:</L>
<L>then bind your budget on your back,</L>
<L>and nails up in your apron;</L>
<L>For I've a tinker under tack,</L>
<L>that used to clout my caldron,</L>
<L>Fa adri, didle, &amp;c.</L>
