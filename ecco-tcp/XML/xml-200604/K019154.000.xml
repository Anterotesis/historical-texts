<P>IF I take the Liberty, once more, to crave the Protection of your ROYAL HIGHNESS, for another Tra∣gedy of my writing, it is because I am led, almost unavoidably, to it, by my Subject. In the Character of ELEONORA I have endeavoured to represent, how∣ever faintly, a PRINCESS distinguish'd for all the Virtues that render Greatness

amiable. I have aimed, particu∣larly, to do justice to her inviolable Af∣fection and generous Tenderness for a PRINCE, who was the Darling of a great and free People.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IN former Times, when fierce religious Rage,</L>
<L>And priestly Sway deform'd each suffering Age,</L>
<L>All manly Wit, all useful Learning lay</L>
<L>In Darkness lost, nor hop'd returning Day.</L>
<L>Religion then was stain'd by cruel Deeds:</L>
<L>And free-born Reason stoop'd to Craft and Creeds.</L>
<L>But happier We!—And tho' to-night we show</L>
<L>What fatal Ills from blind Devotion flow,</L>
<L>'Tis not that we such Rage renew'd can fear,</L>
<L>Or dread the Hand of Persecution here—</L>
<L>Our Scene would wide Humanity impart;</L>
<L>Would breathe extensive Candour thro' the Heart;</L>
<L>Show true Religion even to Error kind,</L>
<L>And claim the perfect Freedom of the Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If too the Poet paints a noble Strife</L>
<L>'Twixt the fond Husband and the generous Wife;</L>
<L>If all the Father in <HI>his</HI> Voice complains,</L>
<L>And all the Mother in <HI>her</HI> tender Strains;</L>
<L>If these best Passions prompt the pleasing Woe,</L>
<L>Indulge it freely—Nature bids it flow:</L>
<L>Where Parent Nature leads, you cannot stray;</L>
<L>And what she wills, 'tis Virtue to obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fond of <HI>BRITANNIA</HI>'s Fame, and just to <HI>YOU,</HI></L>
<L>He bids <HI>old English Honour</HI> live anew,</L>
<L>And calls your great first <HI>EDWARD</HI> up to view.</L>
<L>But if his Line too weak, his Stroke too faint,</L>
<L>The graceful Figure, in full Light, to paint;</L>
<L>In candid part his honest Meaning take,</L>
<L>And spare the Poet for the Hero's sake.</L>

<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THese Poets are such Fools!—The Man behind,</L>
<L>Who wrote this Play—a simple Soul, I find,—</L>
<L>Believes, with all his Heart, there was a Wife,</L>
<L>Who needs would die—to save a Husband's Life!</L>
<L>He in the printed Chronicles has read it:</L>
<L>And true it is—Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> said it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why what an Ass these Books do make a Man?</L>
<L>Read Nature—then believe it—you who can.</L>
<L>Look round this Town—the question is not—whether</L>
<L>Spouse <HI>dies</HI> for Spouse: but who will <HI>live</HI> together?</L>
<L>Of old, they say, a Husband was a Lover:</L>
<L>But, thank our Stars! these foolish Days are over:</L>
<L>To such substantial Prudence are we come,</L>
<L>We wed not Heart to Heart—but Plumb to Plumb.</L>
<L>What Sense? what Beauty? are not now the Things:</L>
<L>But can <HI>he</HI> settle—<HI>up</HI> to what <HI>she</HI> brings?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet in this easy, all-forgiving Age,</L>
<L>Bear with such moral Fooleries—on the Stage.</L>
<L>Perhaps too, there may be some gentle Soul,</L>
<L>Who rather likes to weep—than win a Vole;</L>
<L>Who thinks that there <HI>are</HI> Charms in generous Love,</L>

<L>I Will no longer doubt. 'Tis plain, my Friends,</L>
<L>That with our little Band of <HI>English</HI> Troops,</L>
<L>By all Allies all western Powers deserted,</L>
<L>All but the noble Knights that guard this Land,</L>
<L>The Flower of <HI>Europe</HI> and of Christian Valour,</L>
<L>Nought can be done, nought worthy of our Cause,</L>
<L>Worthy of <HI>England</HI>'s Heir, and of the Name</L>
<L>Of <HI>Lion-hearted</HI> RICHARD; whose Renown,</L>
<L>After almost a Century elaps'd,</L>
<L>Shakes thro' its wide Extent this Eastern World.</L>
<L>What else could bend the <HI>Saracen</HI> to Peace,</L>
<L>Who might, with better Policy, refuse</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="9"/>
To grant it us? Yes, to the Prince of <HI>Jaffa</HI></L>
<L>I will accord the Peace he has demanded:</L>
<L>And tho' my Troops, impatient, wait the Signal</L>
<L>To storm yon Walls, yet will I not expose,</L>
<L>In vain Attempts, Valour that should be sav'd</L>
<L>For better days, and for the public Welfare.</L>
<L>Rash fruitless War, from wanton Glory wag'd,</L>
<L>Is only splendid Murder—What says THEALD?</L>
<L>Approves my Reverend Father of my Purpose?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THEALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>EDWARD, illustrious Heir of <HI>England</HI>'s Crown,</L>
<L>I must indeed be blinded with the Zeal</L>
<L>Of this our holy Cause, to think your Arms,</L>
<L>Thus all-forsaken, thus betray'd, sufficient</L>
<L>To reach the Grandeur of your first Design,</L>
<L>And, from the Yoke of Infidels, to free</L>
<L>The sacred City, Object of our Vows.</L>
<L>Yet this, methinks, this <HI>Jaffa</HI> might be seiz'd:</L>
<L>That still were something, an auspicious Omen</L>
<L>Of future Conquest—But, unskill'd in War,</L>
<L>To you, my Lord, and GLOSTER'S wise Experience,</L>
<L>I this submit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Speak, GLOSTER, your Advice,</L>
<L>Before I fix my latest Resolution.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GLOSTER.</SPEAKER>
<L>You know, my Lord, I never was a Friend</L>
<L>To this Crusado. My unchang'd Advice</L>
<L>Is strenuous then for Peace. Nor this, alone,</L>
<L>From your deserted Circumstance I urge,</L>
<L>But from the state of our unhappy Country.</L>
<L>Behold her, EDWARD, with a filial Eye,</L>
<L>And say, is this a time for these Adventures?</L>
<L>Behold Her still with deep Commotion shook,</L>
<L>Beneath a false delusive Face of Quiet:</L>
<L>Behold Her bleeding still from Civil War,</L>
<L>Exhausted, sunk; drain'd by ten thousand Arts</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
Of ministerial Rapine, endless Taxes,</L>
<L>Ill-manag'd Expeditions, Strangers, Legates,</L>
<L><HI>Italian</HI> Leeches, and insatiate <HI>Rome</HI>;</L>
<L>That never rag'd before with such gross Insult,</L>
<L>With such abandon'd Avarice. Besides,</L>
<L>Who knows what evil Counsellors, again,</L>
<L>Are gather'd round the Throne. In Times like these,</L>
<L>Disturb'd, and lowring with unsettled Freedom,</L>
<L>One step to lawless Power, one old Attempt</L>
<L>Renew'd, the least Infringement of our Charters,</L>
<L>Would hurl the giddy Nation into Tempest.</L>
<L>Return, my Prince. You have already sav'd</L>
<L>Your Father from his Foes, from haughty LEISTER:</L>
<L>Now save him from his Ministers, from those</L>
<L>Who hold him captive in the worst of Chains—</L>

<L>I did my Duty;</L>
<L>Even while I join'd with LEISTER, did my Duty—</L>
<L>I hope I did—He, who contends for Freedom,</L>
<L>Can ne'er be justly deem'd his Sovereign's Foe:</L>
<L>No, 'tis the Wretch that tempts him to subvert it,</L>
<L>The soothing Slave, the Traitor in the bosom,</L>
<L>Who best deserves that Name; he is the Worm</L>
<L>That eats out all the Happiness of Kingdoms.</L>
</LG>

<L>EDWARD, return; lose not a Day, an Hour,</L>
<L>Before this City. Tho' your Cause be holy,</L>
<L>Believe me, 'tis a much more pious Office,</L>
<L>To save your Father's old and broken Years,</L>
<L>His mild and easy Temper, from the Snares</L>
<L>Of low corrupt insinuating Traitors:</L>
<L>A nobler Office far! on the firm Base</L>
<L>Of well-proportion'd Liberty, to build</L>
<L>The common Quiet, Happiness and Glory,</L>

<L>True, my Friend;</L>

<L>He loves the People he must one day rule;</L>
<L>With Fondness loves them, with a noble Pride;</L>
<L>Esteems their Good, esteems their Glory his.</L>
<L>One Instance it becomes me to recount,</L>
<L>That shows the genuine Greatness of his Soul.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="13"/>
Tho' I have met him in the bloody Field,</L>
<L>He fighting for his Father, I for Freedom;</L>
<L>Yet bears his Bosom no remaining Grudge</L>
<L>Of those distracted Times: to me his Heart</L>
<L>Is greatly reconcil'd—Virtue! beyond</L>
<L>The little unforgiving Soul of Tyrants!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now will I tell thee, THEALD, whence I stoop</L>
<L>To wear the gaudy Chains of Court-Attendance,</L>
<L>At these grey Years; that should in calm Retire∣ment</L>
<L>Pass the soft Evening of a bustling Life,</L>
<L>And plume my parting Soul for better Worlds.</L>
<L>Amidst his many Virtues, youthful EDWARD</L>
<L>Is lofty, warm, and absolute of Temper:</L>
<L>I therefore seek to moderate his Heat,</L>
<L>To guide his fiery Virtues, that, misled,</L>
<L>By dazling Power and flattering Sycophants,</L>
<L>Might finish what his Father's weaker Measures</L>
<L>Have try'd in vain. And hence I here attend him,</L>
<L>In Expeditions which I ne'er approv'd,</L>
<L>In holy Wars—your Pardon, Reverend Father—</L>
<L>I must declare I think such Wars the Fruit</L>
<L>Of idle Courage or mistaken Zeal,</L>
<L>Sometimes of Rapine and religious Rage,</L>
<L>To every Mischief prompt.</L>

<L>Thus, in a barbarous Torrent, to bear down</L>
<L>All <HI>Asia, Africk,</HI> and profane their Altars?</L>

<L>Yes, when they burst their Limits, let us check them:</L>
<L>And with a firmer hand than those loose Christians,</L>
<L>The most corrupt and abject of Mankind,</L>
<L>Slaves, doubly Slaves, who suffer'd these <HI>Arabians,</HI></L>
<L>In Virtue their Superiors as in Valour,</L>
<L>To measure Conquest with a Traveller's Speed.</L>
<L>By Rage and Zeal, 'tis true, their Empire rose:</L>

<L>All rob'd in spotless White she sought her Altars;</L>

<L>The Prince her Husband, and her Orphan-Children,</L>
<L>Implor'd th' ETERNAL MIND.—As yet she held</L>
<L>Her swelling Tears, and in her Bosom kept</L>
<L>Her Sighs repress'd: nor did the near Approach</L>
<L>Of the pale King of Terrors dim her Beauty;</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="38"/>
No, rather adding to her Charms, it breath'd</L>
<L>A certain mournful Sweetness thro' her Features.</L>
<L>But as th' increasing Bane more desperate grew,</L>
<L>Wild to her Bed she rush'd, and then, indeed,</L>
<L>The lovely Fountains of her Eyes were open'd,</L>
<L>Then flow'd her Tears.—"Connubial Bed, she cry'd,</L>
<L>" Chaste Witness of my Tenderness for him,</L>
<L>" To save whose Life I unrepining die,</L>

<L>But Fear of chasing from his Eyes, too soon,</L>
<L>The salutary Sleep that heal'd his Pangs,</L>

<L>Conduct me to the Prince—I claim thy Promise.—</L>
<L>It stings my conscious Soul with sick Impatience,</L>
<L>To think what SELIM suffers. For a Man,</L>
<L>Who loves the Ways of Truth and open Virtue,</L>

To ly beneath the burning Imputation</L>
<L>Of Baseness and of Crimes—such horrid Crimes!—</L>

<L>That thou soon shalt do.</L>
<L>He strait will come this Way, the King of <HI>England,</HI></L>
<L>Such now he is. Mean time, 'tis fit to tell thee,</L>
<L>He must be manag'd softly; for his Passions</L>

<L>If, King of <HI>England,</HI> in this weighty Matter,</L>

<L><PB N="56" REF="63"/>
You love and seek the Truth, let Reason judge,</L>
<L>Cool, steady, quiet and dispassion'd Reason.</L>

<L>Of Men began to jar, did Passion give,</L>

<L>What can be clearer? This vile Prince of <HI>Jaffa!</HI></L>
<L>This Infamy of Princes! Sends a Ruffian,</L>
<L>By his own Hand and Seal commission'd, sends him,</L>
<L>To treat of Peace: And, as I read his Letters,</L>
<L>The Villain stabs me—This, if This wants Light,</L>
<L>There is no Certainty in human Reason;</L>
<L>If This not shines with all-convincing Truth,</L>
<L>Yon Sun is dark—And yet these Cowards come</L>
<L>With lying Shifts, and low elusive Arts—</L>
<L>O it inflames my Anger into Madness!</L>
<L>This added Insult on our Understanding,</L>
<L>This treacherous Attempt to steal away</L>
<L>The only Joy and Treasure of my Life,</L>
<L>Sweet sacred Vengeance for my murder'd Princess!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SELIM.</SPEAKER>
<L>The cursed Wretch who did assail thy Life,</L>
<L>O King of <HI>England,</HI> was indeed an Envoy</L>
<L>Sent by the Prince of <HI>Jaffa:</HI> This we own.</L>
<L>But then he was an execrable Bigot,</L>
<L>Who, for such horrid Purposes, had crept</L>
<L>Into the cheated Sultan's Court and Service;</L>
<L>As by the Traltor's Papers we have learn'd.</L>
<L>For know, there lives, upon the craggy Cliffs</L>
<L>Of wild <HI>Phenician</HI> Mountains, a dire Race,</L>
<L>A Nation of Assassins. Dreadful Zeal,</L>
<L>Fierce and intollerant of all Religion</L>
<L>That differs from their own, is the black Soul</L>
<L>Of that infernal State. Soon as their Chief,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="64"/>
The Old Man (so they stile him) of the Mountains,</L>
<L>Gives out his baleful Will, however fell,</L>
<L>However wicked and abhorr'd it be,</L>
<L>Tho' cloth'd in Danger the most cruel Death,</L>
<L>They, swift and silent, glide thro' every Land,</L>
<L>As fly the gloomy Ministers of Vengeance,</L>
<L>Famine and Plague; they ly for Years conceal'd,</L>
<L>Make light of Oaths, nay, sometimes change Religion,</L>
<L>And never fail to execute his Orders.</L>
<L>Of these the Villain was, these ruffian Saints,</L>
<L>The Curse of Earth, the Terror of Mankind:</L>
<L>And the Engagement, Prince, in this Crusado,</L>
<L>That was the Reason whence they sought thy Life</L>

<L>Vindictive Rage, the Thirst of Blood consumes you:</L>

<L>Be patient, Prince, be more humane and just.</L>
<L>You have your Virtues, have your Vices too;</L>

<L>Has not created us, nor any Nation,</L>
<L>Beneath the blessed Canopy of Heaven,</L>
<L>Of such malignant Clay, but each may boast</L>
<L>Their native Virtues, and their Maker's Bounty.</L>
<L>You call us Bigots.—Oh! canst thou with that</L>
<L>Reproach us, Christian Prince? What brought thee hither?</L>
<L>What else but Bigotry? What dost thou here?</L>
<L>What else but persecute?—The Truth is great,</L>
<L>Greater than thee, and I will give it Way;</L>

Even thou thyself, in all thy Rage, wilt hear it—</L>
<L>From their remotest Source, these holy Wars</L>
<L>What have they breath'd but Bigotry and Rapine?</L>
<L>Did not the first <HI>Crusaders,</HI> when their Zeal</L>
<L>Should have shone out the purest, did they not,</L>
<L>Led by the frantic Hermit who began</L>
<L>The murderous Trade, thro' their own Countries spread</L>
<L>The Woes their Vice could not reserve for ours?</L>

<L>Tho' this exceeds the Purport of my Message,</L>

<L>Of <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> when beneath</L>
<L>Your pious GODFREY, in the first Crusado,</L>
<L><HI>Jerusalem</HI> was sack'd, and when beneath</L>
<L>Our generous SALADIN it was retaken—</L>
<L>O hideous Scene! my Soul within me shrinks,</L>
<L>Abhorrent, from the View!—Twelve thousand Wretches,</L>
<L>Receiv'd to Mercy, void of all Defence,</L>
<L>Trusting to plighted Faith, to purchas'd Safety,</L>
<L>Behold these naked Wretches, in cold Blood,</L>
<L>Men, Women, Children, murder'd, basely mur∣der'd!</L>
<L>The holy Temple, which you came to rescue,</L>
<L>Regorges with the barbarous Profanation.</L>
<L>The Streets run dismal Torrents. Drown'd in Blood,</L>
<L>The very Soldier sickens at his Carnage.</L>
<L>Couldst thou, O Sun, behold the bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Sight,</L>
