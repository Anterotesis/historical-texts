<SPEAKER>CHARON.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>RITHEE, Philosopher, what
grand Affair is transacting upon
Earth? There is something of Im∣portance
going forward I am sure;
for <HI>Mercury</HI> flew over the <HI>Styx</HI> this Morn∣ing,
without paying me the usual Compli∣ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell thee, <HI>Charon</HI>; this is the
Anniversary of the Rape of <HI>Proserpine</HI>; on
which Day for the future, <HI>Pluto</HI> has per∣mitted
her to demand from him something
for the Benefit of Mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you;—his Majesty's
Passions, by a long Possession of the Lady,
are abated; and so, like a mere Mortal, he
must now flatter her Vanity, and sacrifice his
Power, to attone for Deficiencies—But what
has our Royal Mistress proposed in behalf of
her favourite Mortals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>As Mankind, you know, are ever
complaining of their Cares, and dissatisfied
with their Conditions, the generous <HI>Proser∣pine</HI>
has begg'd of <HI>Pluto,</HI> that they may
have free Access to the Waters of <HI>Lethe,</HI> as
a sovereign Remedy for their Complaints—
Notice has been already given above, and
Proclamation made: <HI>Mercury</HI> is to conduct
them to the <HI>Styx,</HI> you are to ferry 'em over
to <HI>Elysium,</HI> and I am placed here to distri∣bute
the Waters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very pretty Employment, I shall
have of it, truly! If her Majesty has of∣ten
these Whims; I must petition the
Court either to build a Bridge over the
River, or let me resign my Employment.
Do their Majesties know the Difference of
Weight between Souls and Bodies? How∣ever,
I'll obey their Commands to the best
of my Power; I'll row my crazy Boat over
and meet 'em; but many of them will be
relieved from their Cares before they reach
<HI>Lethe.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, <HI>Charon?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I shall leave half of 'em in the
<HI>Styx</HI>; and any Water is a Specifick against
Care, provided it be taken in Quantity.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Mercury.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away to your Boat, <HI>Charon</HI>; there
are some Mortals arriv'd; and the Females
among 'em will be very clamorous, if you
make 'em wait.</P>

<P>I'll make what Haste I can, rather

<STAGE>Noise within. Boat, Boat, Boat!</STAGE>
<P>Coming—coming—Zounds, you are in a
plaguy Hurry, sure!—No wonder these mortal
Folks have so many Complaints, when
there's no Patience among 'em; if they were
dead now, and to be settled here for ever, they'd
be damn'd before they'd make such a Rout
to come over,—but Care I suppose is thirsty,
and 'till they have drench'd themselves with
<HI>Lethe,</HI> there will be no Quiet among 'em;
therefore I'll e'en to work; and so Friend
<HI>Aesop,</HI> and Brother <HI>Mercury,</HI> good bye to 'ye. <STAGE>[Exit <HI>Charon.</HI></STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Act as your Wisdom directs, and

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I still retain my former Sentiments,
never to refuse Advice or Charity to those
that want either; Flattery and Rudeness
should be equally avoided; Folly and Vice
should never be spared; and tho' by acting
thus, you may offend many, yet you will
please the better few; and the Approbation
of one virtuous Mind, is more valuable than
all the noisy Applause, and uncertain Fa∣vours,
of the Great and Guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incomparable <HI>Aesop!</HI> both Men and
Gods admire thee! We must now prepare to

much Dread, I'll raise Musick shall dis∣pel
their Fears, and embolden them to ap∣proach.</P>

<P>Sir, your humble Servant—your

know your Person intimately, tho' I never
saw you before; and am well acquainted
with you, tho' I never had the Honour of
your Conversation.</P>

<P>You are a Dealer in Paradoxes,

<P>I am a Dealer in all Parts of Speech,
and in all the Figures of Rhetorick—I am a
Poet, Sir—and to be a Poet, and not ac∣quainted
with the great <HI>Aesop,</HI> is a greater
Paradox than—I honour you extremely, Sir;
you certainly, of all the Writers of Antiquity,
had the greatest, the sublimest Genius, the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Friend, I hate Flattery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My own Taste exactly;—I assure you,
Sir, no Man loves Flattery less than myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it appears, Sir, by your being
so ready to give it away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have hit it, Mr. <HI>Aesop,</HI> you have
hit it—I have given it away, indeed—I did
not receive one Farthing for my last Dedi∣cation,
and yet would you believe it?—I
absolutely gave all the Virtues in Heav'n, to
one of the lowest Reptiles upon Earth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard, indeed, to do dirty Work
for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, to do dirty Work, and still
be dirty oneself, is the Stone of <HI>Sysiphus,</HI> and
the Thirst of <HI>Tantalus</HI>—You <HI>Greek</HI> Writers,
indeed, carried your Point by Truth and Sim∣plicity,—
they won't do now a-days—our
Patrons must be tickled into Generosity—you
gain'd the greatest Favours, by shewing your
own Merits, we can only gain the smallest,
by publishing those of other People.—You
flourish'd by Truth, we starve by Fiction;
<HI>Tempora mutantur.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Friend, if we may guess
by your present Plight, you have prostituted
your Talents to very little Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>To very little, upon my word—but
they shall find that I can open another Vein
—Satire is the Fashion, and Satire they shall
have—let 'em look to it, I can be sharp as
well as sweet—I can scourge as well as tickle,
I can bite as—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can do any thing, no doubt;
but to the Business of this Visit, for I ex∣pect
a great deal of Company—What are
your Troubles, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. <HI>Aesop,</HI> I am troubled with
an odd kind of a Disorder—I have a sort of
a Whistling—a Singing—a Whizzing as
it were in my Head, which I cannot get
rid of—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Waters give no Relief to bodily
Disorders, they only affect the Memory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>From whence all my Disorder pro∣ceeds—
I'll tell you my Case, Sir—
You must know, I wrote a Play some time
ago, presented a Dedication of it to a certain
young Nobleman—He approv'd and ac∣cepted
of it, but before I could taste his
Bounty, my Piece was unfortunately damn'd:
—I lost my Benefit, nor could I have Re∣course
to my Patron, for I was told that his
Lordship play'd the best Catcall the first
Night, and was the merriest Person in the
whole Audience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what do you call damning a
Play?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot possibly be ignorant,
what it is to be damn'd, Mr. <HI>Aesop?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I am, Sir—We had no
such thing among the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir!—No Wonder then that
you <HI>Greeks</HI> were such fine Writers—It is
impossible to be describ'd, or truly felt, but
by the Author himself—If you could but
get a Leave of Absence from this World for
a few Hours, you might perhaps have an
Opportunity of seeing it yourself—There is
a Sort of a new Piece comes upon our Stage
this very Night, and I am pretty sure it will
meet with its Deserts; at least it shall not
want my helping Hand, rather than you
should be disappointed of satisfying your
Curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very obliging, Sir;—but to
your own Misfortunes, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Envy, Malice and Party destroy'd
me—You
must know, Sir, I was a great
Damner myself, before I was damn'd—So
the Frolicks of my Youth were return'd to me
with double Interest, from my Brother Au∣thors—But,
to say the Truth, my Perform∣ance
was terribly handled, before it appear'd
in publick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, some squeamish Friends
of mine prun'd it of all the Bawdy and Im∣morality,
the Actors did not speak a Line of
the Sense or Sentiment, and the Manager
(who writes himself) struck out all the
Wit and Humour, in order to lower my
Performance to a Level with his own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, I am acquainted with
your Case, what have you to propose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding the Success of my
first Play, I am strongly persuaded that my
next may defy the Severity of Criticks, the
Sneer of Wits, and the Malice of Authors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! have you been hardy enough
to attempt another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must eat, Sir—I must live—but
when I sit down to write, and am glowing
with the Heat of my Imagination, then—this
damn'd Whistling—or Whizzing in my
Head, that I told you of, so disorders me,
that I grow giddy—In short, Sir, I am
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
haunted, as it were, with the Ghost of my
deceas'd Play, and its dying Groans, are for
ever in my Ears—Now, Sir, if you will
give me but a Draught of <HI>Lethe,</HI> to forget
this unfortunate Performance, it will be of
more real Service to me, than all the Waters
of <HI>Helicon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt, Friend, you cannot pos∣sibly
write better, by merely forgetting that
you have written before; besides, if, when
you drink to the Forgetfulness of your own
Works, you should unluckily forget those of
other People too, your next Piece will cer∣tainly
be the worse for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are certainly in the right—
What then would you advise me to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose you could prevail upon the
Audience to drink the Water; their forgetting
your former Work, might be of no small Ad∣vantage
to your future Productions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir! if I could but do that—
but I am afraid—<HI>Lethe</HI> will never go down
with the Audience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since you are bent upon it, I
shall indulge you—If you please to walk in
that Grove, (which will afford you many
Subjects for your poetical Contemplation) till
I have examin'd the rest, I will dismiss you
in your Turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I in return, Sir, will let the
World know, in a Preface to my next Piece,
that your Politeness is equal to your Sagacity,

<P>I am that Person, Sir; but you
seem to have no need of my Waters; for
you must have already out-liv'd your Me∣mory.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Memory is indeed impair'd,
it is not so good as it was; but still it is bet∣ter
than I wish it, at least in regard to one
Circumstance; there is one Thing which
sits very heavy at my Heart, and which I
would willingly forget.</P>

to die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Friend, you have mistaken
the Virtue of the Waters: They can cause
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
you to forget only what is past; but if this
was in their Power, you would surely be
your own Enemy, in desiring to forget what
ought to be the only Comfort of one, so poor
and wretched as you seem. What! I suppose
now, you have left some dear loving Wife
behind, that you can't bear to think of part∣ing
with.</P>

<P>Shall I forget then that I am to

<P>No—but you shall forget that you
have it—which will do altogether as well—

perfect Ease of Mind; and as for your bodily
Pains, no Waters can relieve them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me advise you, young
Gentleman, to drink the Waters, and forget
that Ease and Familiarity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, Daddy? wou'd you
not have me well bred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but you may not always meet
with People so polite as yourself, or so pas∣sive
as I am; and if what you call Breeding,
shou'd be constru'd Impertinence, you may
have a Return of Familiarity, may make
you repent your Education as long as you
live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, old Dry-beard, egad
you have a Smattering of an odd kind of a
sort of a Humour; but come, come, prithee
give me a Glass of your Waters, and keep
your Advice to yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must first be informed, Sir, for
what Purpose you drink 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, Philosopher,
I want to forget two Qualities—My <HI>Mo∣desty,</HI>
and my <HI>Good-nature.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Modesty and Good-nature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir—I have such a con∣summate
<HI>Modesty,</HI> that when a fine Woman
(which is often the Case) yields to my Ad∣dresses,
egad I run away from her; and I am
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
so very <HI>good-natured,</HI> that when a Man af∣fronts
me, egad I run away too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for your Modesty, Sir, I am
afraid you are come to the wrong Waters;—
and if you will take a large Cup to the For∣getfulness
of your Fears, your Good-nature, I
believe, will trouble you no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this is your Advice, my
Dear, eh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Advice, Sir, would go a great
deal farther—I should advise you to drink to
the Forgetfulness of every thing you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil you would; then
I should have travell'd to a fine Purpose
truly; you don't imagine, perhaps, that I
have been three Years abroad, and have made
the Tour of <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, I guess'd you had travell'd
by your Dress and Conversation: But, pray,
(with Submission) what valuable Improve∣ments
have you made in these Travels?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I learnt Drinking in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
Musick and Painting in <HI>Italy,</HI> Dancing,
Gaming, and some other Amusements, at
<HI>Paris</HI>; and in <HI>Holland</HI>—faith, nothing at all;
I brought over with me the best Collection
of <HI>Venetian</HI> Ballads, two Eunuchs, a <HI>French</HI>
Dancer, and a Monkey, with Tooth-picks,
Pictures and Burlettas—In short, I have skim'd
the Cream of every Nation, and have the
Consolation to declare, I never was in any
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
Country in my Life, but I had Taste enough
thoroughly to despise my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Country is greatly obliged to
you,—but if you are settled in it now, how
can your Taste and Delicacy endure it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith my Existence is merely
supported by Amusements; I dress, visit,
study Taste, and write Sonnets; by Birth,
Travel, Education, and natural Abilities, I
am entitled to lead the Fashion; I am prin∣cipal
Connoisseur at all Auctions, chief Ar∣biter
at Assemblies, profess'd Critick at the
Theatres, and a fine Gentleman—every
where—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Critick, Sir, pray what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Delight of the Ingenious,
the Terror of Poets, the Scourge of Players,
and the Aversion of the Vulgar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, (for I fancy your Life
must be somewhat particular) how do you
pass your Time; the Day, for Instance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I lie in Bed all Day, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you spend your Evenings
then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dress in the Evening, and go
generally behind the Scenes of both Play∣houses;
not, you may imagine to be diverted
with the Play, but to intrigue, and shew my∣self—I
stand upon the Stage, talk loud,
and stare about—which confounds the Actors,
and disturbs the Audience; upon which the
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
Galleries, who hate the Appearance of one
of us, begin to <HI>hiss,</HI> and cry <HI>off, off,</HI> while I
undaunted, stamp my Foot so—loll with my
Shoulder thus—take Snuff with my Right-hand,
and smile scornfully—thus—This
exasperates the Savages, and they attack us
with Vollies of suck'd Oranges, and half
eaten Pippins—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you retire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, if I am sober
—for Orange will stain Silk, and an Apple
may disfigure a Feature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Sir, for all this, that
you are oblig'd to your own Imagination, for
more than three Fourths of your Importance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fine Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn the old Prig, I'll bully
him— <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Lookee, old Philoso∣pher,
I find you have pass'd your Time so
long in Gloom and Ignorance below here,
that our Notions above Stairs are too refined
for you; so as we are not likely to agree, I
shall cut Matters very short with you—Bot∣tle
me off the Waters I want, or you shall
be convinc'd that I have Courage, in the
drawing of a Cork;—dispatch me instantly,
or I shall make bold to throw you into the
River, and help myself—What say you to
that now? eh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very civil and concise! I have no
great Inclination to put your Manhood to
the Trial; so if you will be pleas'd to walk
in the Grove there, 'till I have examined
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
some I see coming, we'll compromise the
Affair between us.</P>

<P>How do you know that, eh?
What, you an't all Conjurers in this World,

<P>Your Behaviour to him is a suffici∣ent
Proof of his Condition, without the Gift
of Conjuration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I was as free with him
before Marriage, as I am now; I never was
coy or prudish in my Life.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you, Madam; pray how
long have you been married? you seem to be
very young, Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I am old enough for a Husband,

tired of one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, above three Months; I
married Mr. <HI>Tatoo</HI> without my Guardians
Consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you married him with your own
Consent, I think you might continue your
Affections a little longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies what you think,
if I don't think so?—We are quite tired of
one another, and are come to drink some of
your Le—Lethaly—Leithily, I think they
call it, to forget one another, and be unmar∣ried
again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Waters can't divorce you, Ma∣dam;
and you may easily forget him, with∣out
the Assistance of <HI>Lethe.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; how so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>By remembering continually he is
your Husband, there are several Ladies have
no other Receipt—But what does the Gen∣tleman
say to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>What signifies what he says? I
an't so young and so foolish as that comes
to, to be directed by my Husband, or to care
what either he says, or you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I was a Drummer in a March∣ing
Regiment, when I ran away with that
young Lady—I immediately bought out of
the Corps, and thought myself made for
ever; little imagining that a poor vain Fellow
was purchasing Fortune, at the Expence of
his Happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis even so, Friend; Fortune and
Felicity are as often at Variance as Man and
Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I found it so, Sir—This high
Life (as I thought it) did not agree with
me; I have not laugh'd, and scarcely slept
since my Advancement, and unless your Wis∣dom
can alter her Notions, I must e'en quit
the Blessings of a fine Lady and her Portion,
and for Content, have Recourse to Eight-pence
a Day, and my Drum again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray who has advis'd you to a Se∣paration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several young Ladies of my Ac∣quaintance,
who tell me they are not angry
at me for marrying him, but being fond of
him now I have married him; and they say
I should be as compleat a fine Lady as any
of 'em, if I would but procure a <HI>separate
Divorcement.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Madam, will you let me know
what you call a fine Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, a fine Lady, and a fine
Gentleman, are two of the finest Things
upon Earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have just now had the Honour
of knowing what a fine Gentleman is; so
pray confine yourself to the Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine Lady before Marriage,
lives with her Papa and Mama, who breed
her up till she learns to despise 'em, and re∣solves
to do nothing they bid her; this makes
her such a prodigious Favourite, that she
wants for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>When once she is her own Mi∣stress,
then comes the Pleasure!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>She lies in Bed all Morning,
rattles about all Day, and sits up all Night;
she goes every where, and sees every thing;
knows every body, and loves no body; ri∣dicules
her Friends, coquets with her Lovers,
sets 'em together by the Ears, tells Fibs,
makes Mischief, buys China, cheats at Cards,
keeps a Pug-dog, and hates the Parsons; she
laughs much, talks aloud, never blushes, says
what she will, does what she will, goes where
she will, marries whom she pleases, hates
her Husband in a Month, breaks his Heart
in four, becomes a Widow, slips from her
Gallants, and begins the World again—
There's a Life for you? What do you think
of a fine Lady now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I expected—you are very young
Lady! and if you are not very careful, your
natural Propensity to Noise and Affectation,
will run you headlong into Folly, Extrava∣vagance,
and Repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Drink a large Quantity of <HI>Lethe</HI> to
the Loss of your Acquaintance; and do you,
Sir, drink another to forget this false Step of
your Wife; for whilst you remember her
Folly, you can never thoroughly regard her,
and whilst you keep good Company, Lady,
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
as you call it, and follow their Example, you
can never have a just Regard for your Hus∣band;
so both drink and be happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Tat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, give it me whilst I am
in Humour, or I shall certainly change my
Mind again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aesop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient, till the rest of the Com∣pany
drink, and divert yourself, in the mean
time, with walking in the Grove.</P>
</SP>

<P>The Man talks of nothing but
his Money, and my Extravagance—won't re∣move
out of the filthy City, tho' he knows I
die for the other End of the Town; nor
leave off his nasty Merchandizing, tho' I've
labour'd to convince him, he loses Money
by it. The Man was once tolerable enough,
and let me have Money when I wanted it;
but now he's never out of a Tavern, and is
grown so valiant, that, do you know—he
has presum'd to contradict me, and refuse
me Money upon every Occasion.</P>
