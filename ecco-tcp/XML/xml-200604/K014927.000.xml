<P>THE Editor of Mr. SHERIDAN'S
Speech, which has been collected with
great diligence, and corrected with great
attention, will make no apology for giving to
the world the celebrated Oration, which all the
world could not possibly hear. For arrange∣ment
of matter, acuteness of observation, point∣edness
of sarcasm, and pathos of expression, this
Speech, which excited expectation without dis∣appointment,
has been seldom surpassed, and
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
seldomer equalled. It is, however, fair for
Mr. Hastings's friends to request, that judg∣ment
may be suspended till the other side shall
be heard; since brilliancy of eloquence, and
cogency of proof have very different effects on
judicious minds.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>SHERIDAN</HI>'s
SPEECH
IN
WESTMINSTER HALL,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>TUESDAY, JUNE THE 3d, 1788.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE Court being seated precisely at twelve o'clock,
MR. SHERIDAN arose.—It would be superfluous,
he observed, for him to call the attention of their
Lordships to the magnitude and importance of the subject
before them; to advert to the parties who were engaged in
the business; or to depict the situation of those multitudes
who were ultimately to be affected. All this had already
been done by the Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Burke) who opened
the prosecution;—by him, who, alone, was equal to the
task;—by him, to whom mankind was indebted for the em∣bodied
stand, which was now made in defence of the general
rights of humanity.—Neither was it his intention to enter
into any detail which might be deemed foreign to the quef∣tion
immediately before the Court:—he would only indulge
himself in a few words respecting some insinuations which
had been thrown out against the persons concerned in this
prosecution. It had been whispered, by whom he could not
say, that there was something malicious, and something,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
perhaps, too violent in the manner in which it had been con∣ducted.
Speaking for himself, and as far as the heart of
man could be known, for the other managers appointed by
the Commons, he would boldly assert, that they had acted
solely from conviction; not a conviction born in error, and
nursed by prejudice; but a conviction founded on deliberate
and well-grounded enquiry;—that they had proceeded, not as
rejoicing in punishment, but impelled by a sanguine hope of
remedy.—Personal malice! God forbid that they should
indulge such a sensation against the unfortunate gentleman
at the bar; but how, when they were to speak of Rapine,
of Cruelty, and of Extortion, could such ideas be conveyed
but in consonant language? There was undoubtedly a diffe∣rence
between Impeachment for capital Crimes, and those
for Misdemeanours only. In proceedings on the former,
every latitude had been indulged by usage, every aggrava∣tion
was employed, and every act of the Prisoner tortured
into Criminality. No such privilege was claimed by the
managers on the present occasion; but yet it should be con∣sidered
by those, whose pity seemed to rise in proportion
with the guilt of its object;—that if such a mode of proceed∣ing
was admissible in the former Case, where the life of the
Prisoner was affected, it was still more justifiable on an Im∣peachment
like the present; where the utmost consequences
of guilt, when proved, would be but a <HI>splendid exclusion</HI> of
the Criminal from that Society which he had injured, or a
<HI>trifling deduction</HI> from the spoils of a long continued Extor∣tion.</P>
<P>It had been observed what was undoubtedly true, that no
complaint from the natives of India had been presented in
the course of these proceedings. Those, however, who were
first to make this observation, were fully convinced that
meekness in suffering was there a part of the national cha∣racter,
and that their terrors had been too deeply impressed,
not to be long remembered. But though a despair of British
Justice had prevailed through that Peninsula;—though their
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
subdued hearts could not even hope for relief;—yet their
claims on the Justice and Humanity of their Lordships were
not thereby diminished, but recommended. He would not
mention this Despair, without accompanying the observation
by proof; he therefore read Extracts from two Letters, the
first, lately received from Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI>; the second, en∣closed
from Captain Kirkpatrick to his Lordship: from both
which it appeared, that such was the prevailing sense through
India, of the injuries inflicted by the English, and of their
repeated violations of every compact, that it would be long
indeed before their confidence in English faith, or their re∣liance
on English justice, could again be restored.</P>
<P>To these complaints their Lordships were now to answer,
not by professions, but by facts;—not by remedial acts di∣rected
to the future, but by an exemplary punishment in∣flicted
on past delinquency. It was incumbent on them to
shew to the oppressed natives of India, and to future Go∣vernors
and Judges, that there could be no authority so high,
no office so sacred, as not to be subject to the paramount
power of British Justice.—He did not, however, mean to
say, that the Example should be made, unless the Guilt was
first fully proved: No, God forbid, that in this free and
just land, legal proof and legal guilt should ever be sepa∣rated!
—Though the greater part of the Evidence on this
occasion had been, with a few exceptions, wrung from the
unrelenting accomplices of the prisoner—from men who had
partook of the spoils, and were involved in the guilt; yet
had he therefore no indulgence to demand, nor had he to
request that the Court should take that as evidence on this
occasion, which on any other they might deem themselves
bound to refuse. He, on the contrary, was now to bring
forward to their Lordships a Mass of Evidence, as full, as
strong, as competent, and as conclusive, as ever established
the guilt of a criminal, or ever brought conviction home to
the breasts of conscientious Judges. In the performance of
this task, he observed, he should have the less difficulty, as
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
their Lordships had attended to the whole, voluminous and
complicated as it appeared, with a diligence which did
honor to their feelings, and shewed their individual sense of
the dignity of that high Tribunal, which they collectively
formed.</P>
<P>The first part of this Evidence, to which he should call
the attention of the Court, was the Defences delivered in
by Mr. Hastings to the House of Commons, and to their
Lordships. On these, as being the voluntary admissions of
the Prisoner, unextorted by any threat, and unbiassed by
any persuasion, much stress had undoubtedly been laid. To
a part of these, however, an objection had been made, the
most extraordinary, perhaps, that had ever been advanced in
a Court of Criminal Justice:—an objection which, when
Mr. Hastings was well advised, as he undoubtedly was—
when he was saved from his own <HI>rash Guidance,</HI> the Ma∣nagers
could scarcely have expected. This objection was,
that a Part of the <HI>first</HI> Defence in particular, not having
been written by Mr. Hastings, but by some of his friends,
that Gentleman was not bound by any admissions therein
contained. Mr. Hastings, on appearing at the Bar of the
House of Commons, had pleaded the haste in which he had
written, in palliation of his inaccuracies; he had even made
a merit of doing that himself, which would be less dangerous
if he had committed it to another!—But now, said Mr.
Sheridan, that he finds that there is something more than
inaccuracy—something fraught with that actual danger
which he had apprehended—he reverts to that plea which he
had abandoned, and declares that he had committed the
trust to others!—He disclaims all his former merits, and
avers that, in making up his tale, he had not trusted solely
to his own powers,—that he had put his <HI>Memory</HI> into <HI>Com∣mission,</HI>
and <HI>parcelled</HI> out his <HI>Conscience</HI> into different depart∣ments.
The structure, it appeared, went on, whilst Mr.
Hastings was content with overseeing and cheering his La∣bourers.
—"Mr. Shore, said he, you will take care to make
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
me appear a good <HI>Financier</HI>! Major Scott, my <HI>Judgment</HI> is
reposed in your hands! Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> my HUMANITY is
your's!!!—The work being thus done, Mr. Hastings sur∣veyed
it with a careless glance, and adopted it as his own.
But now that its defects appear, the Child of his Adoption
becomes the object of his aversion, his approbation ceases,
and his language is totally changed.—The Defence is, in
general, made up of general denials of the Charges, inter∣mixed
with encomiums on his own conduct; yet Mr. Hastings
exclaims, "Subject me to all the other evidence against me;
—I know I can trust to their want of Recollection, and their
force of Attachment.—Bare my bosom to every shaft of En∣mity,
but save me from the <HI>Perils</HI> of my own <HI>Panegyric!</HI>"—
The <HI>haste</HI> in which these productions were written, was also
alledged by Mr. Hastings as an apology for every error; but
did it follow, that, because a man wrote rapidly, he should
also write falsely? or was it, that the truth and candour of
Mr. Hastings were so deeply buried in his bosom, that long
study alone could bring them upwards, whilst the natural
falshood, floating on the surface, could be transferred with
extemporaneous readiness to every topic, whether to be
written, or to be uttered?—These were the apologies offered
for the variations, the admissions, and the inconsistency, of
Mr. Hastings's Defences; but these, it was to be hoped, for
the sake of propriety and good sense, would never again be
repeated.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, on quitting this subject, entered into a very
full and happy delineation of the situation of the Princesses
of <HI>Oude.</HI> No perusal of the Turkish History, he observed,
nor attention to the precepts of the Mahometan religion, could
give their Lordships any idea of the manners of the women
of high <HI>casts</HI> in Hindostan. Educated in a profound respect
to the customs of their Persian ancestors, they maintained a
purer style of Prejudice, and a loftier degree of Superstition;
dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their Zenanas,
the Simplicity of their sentiments was equalled only by the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Purity of their conduct. In those innocent retreats, they
were circumscribed, not immured; for such was the force of
Prejudice, that Liberty would be looked on as a curse to
those, to whom the common gaze of men would be regarded
as an unexpiable violation. However mistaken their ideas,
they were placed there by the hand of Piety, and could not
be disturbed but by a sacrilege. They were as Relics on an
altar, which, though deposited by Superstition, none but the
impious would disturb.</P>
<P>In addition to those claims, Mr. Hastings himself had
borne testimony to the Duty which Children owed to Parents
in Hindostan: yet the Bhow Begum, or mother of the
reigning Nabob, had still stronger demands on the affection
of her son.—In the year 1764, when <HI>Sujah Dowlah,</HI> after
the battle of Buxar, was driven from that territory by the
English—which their politic Generosity afterwards restored—
she bore her private treasures to his assistance, and was re∣warded
by the respectful attachment of his future life, with
the devise of all his territories to her son. she had also
interfered in a quarrel between her son and her husband,
and, when the savage father was about to strike down his
son with a sabre, at the expence of her blood, preserved
that life which she gave.—These were pleas in her favor,
which would have exacted the reverence of any man—<HI>but
one!</HI> But these pleas, the sex, the age, and character of
the Begums; and what was yet more, the death-bed recom∣mendation
of Sujah Dowlah, were all of no weight with
Mr. Hastings. This was therefore the object of the present
charge;—that where he owed protection, he had been the
severest oppressor; that the weakness which should have
claimed his aid, but excited his violence; that he had sub∣jected
the son thus, to make him the ungracious instrument
of his tyranny over the parent, and had first made him a <HI>slave,</HI>
in order that he might become—a <HI>monster!</HI></P>
<P>The interference of Mr. <HI>Bristow</HI> in 1775, in the diffe∣rences
between the Begums and the Nabob, in consequence
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
of the claims of the latter, was the next ground of Mr.
SHERIDAN'S observations.—Mr. Bristow had then, in a con∣versation
with the superior or elder Begum, thrown out an
insinuation, that the treasures which she possessed were the
treasures of the State,—and on this insinuation, so termed
by Mr. Bristow himself, had Mr. Hastings founded all his
arguments on that head, and on which he lately appeared to
place so much reliance.—The Begums at that time gave up
to the <HI>Asoph ul Dowla</HI> sums amounting to five hundred and
fifty thousand pounds.—Of this a part was to be paid in
goods, which as they consisted of arms, elephants, &amp;c. the
Nabob alledged to be his property, and refused to accept as
payment. This occasioned a dispute which was referred to
the Board of <HI>Calcutta.</HI> Mr. Hastings then vindicated the
right of the Begums to all the goods in the Zenana, and
brought over the majority of the Council to his opinion.
The ideas then placed on record, he had since found it con∣venient
to disown, as belonging not to him, but to the majo∣rity
of the Council!—How these opinions could be trans∣ferred,
it might be difficult for their Lordships, though well
informed of the effects of <HI>Majorities</HI> and <HI>Minorities,</HI> to deter∣mine.
As well might Mr. BURKE, on a future day deliver
an encomium on that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> man, Mr. <HI>Hastings!</HI> and
if reminded of his share in the prosecution, alledge, that he
was not accountable for so <HI>nefarious</HI> a proceeding; that his
opinions when once delivered, were no longer his own; that
at the time, he had constantly acted in a <HI>Minority.</HI></P>
<P>The claims, however, it was observable, of the Nabob,
as to the treasure of the Begums, were at this time the only
plea alledged for the seizure. These were always founded
on a passage of that <HI>Koran</HI> which was perpetually quoted,
but never proved.—Not a word was then mentioned of the
strange rebellion which was afterwards conjured up, and of
which the <HI>existence</HI> and the <HI>notoriety</HI> were equally a secret.—
A disaffection which was at its height, at the very time when
the Begums were dispensing their liberality to the Nabob,
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
and exercising the greatest generosity to the English Officers
in distress!—a disturbance, in short, without its parallel in
history, which was raised by two <HI>Women,</HI>—carried on by two
<HI>Eunuchs,</HI>—and finally suppressed by an <HI>Affidavit!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then adverted to the negociations of Mr.
Middleton with the Begums in 1778, when the discontents
of the superior Begum would have induced her to leave the
country, unless her authority was sanctioned, and her pro∣perty
secured by the Guarantee of the Company.—This
Guarantee, the Council, or Mr. Hastings, had thought it
necessary to deny, as knowing that if the agreements with
the Elder Begum were proved, it would affix to Mr. Hast∣ings
the guilt of all the sufferings of the Women of the
Khord Mahal, the revenues for whose support were secured
by the same engagement. In treating this part of the sub∣ject,
the principal difficulty arose from the <HI>uncertain</HI> evidence
of Mr. Middleton, who though concerned in the negociation
of <HI>four</HI> treaties, could not recollect affixing his signature
to <HI>three</HI> out of that number. Mr. Sheridan proved, how∣ever,
from the evidence even of Mr. Middleton, that a
Treaty had been signed in October, 1778, wherein the rights
of the Elder Begum were fully recognized; a provision
secured for the Women and Children of the late Vizier in
the Khord Mahal; and that those engagements had received
the fullest sanction of Mr. Hastings. These facts were con∣firmed
by the evidence of Mr. Purling, a gentleman, who,
Mr. Sheridan said, had delivered himself fairly, and as
having no <HI>foul secrets</HI> to conceal. He had transmitted copies
of these engagements in 1780 to Mr. Hastings at Calcutta;
the answer returned was, that in arranging the taxes on the
other districts, he should pass over the Jaghires of the Be∣gums.
No notice was then taken of any impropriety in the
transactions in 1778, nor any notice given of an intended
revocation of those engagements.</P>
<P>But in June 1781, when General Clavering, and Colonel
Monson, being no more, and Mr. Francis having returned
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
to Europe, all the <HI>hoard</HI> and <HI>arrear</HI> of collected evil burst
forth without restraint, and Mr. Hastings determined on his
Journey to the Upper Provinces;—it was then that, without
adverting to intermediate transactions, he met with the Na∣bob
Asoph ul Dowlah, at Chunar, and received from him
the mysterious present of 100,000l.—To form a proper idea
of this transaction, it was only necessary to consider the re∣spective
situation of him who gave, and him who received,
this present.—It was not given by the Nabob from the super∣flux
of his wealth, nor in the abundance of his esteem for
the man to whom it was given: it was, on the contrary, a
prodigal bounty, drawn from a country depopulated,—no
matter whether by natural causes, or by the grinding of
Oppression. It was raised by an exaction, which took what
Calamity had spared, and Rapine overlooked;—and pursued
those angry dispensations of Providence, when a <HI>prophetic</HI>
chastisement had been inflicted on a <HI>fated</HI> realm.—The se∣crecy
which had marked this transaction, was not the smallest
proof of its criminality. When <HI>Benaram Pundit</HI> had, a
short time before, made a present to the Company of a lack
of rupees, Mr. Hastings, in his own language, deemed it
"worthy the praise of being recorded." But in this in∣stance,
when ten times that sum was given, neither Mr.
Middleton nor the Council were acquainted with the trans∣action,
until Mr. Hastings, four months after, felt himself
compelled to write an account to England, and the intelli∣gence
returned thus circuitously to his friends in India!—It
was peculiarly observable in this transaction, how much the
<HI>Distresses</HI> of the different parties were at variance. Mr.
Hastings travels to the Nabob, to see, no doubt, and enquire
into his <HI>Distresses,</HI> but immediately takes from him 130,000l.
to be applied to the necessities of the <HI>distressed</HI> East-India
Company. But, on farther deliberation, these considera∣tions
vanish: a <HI>third</HI> object arises, more worthy than either
of the former, and the money is taken from the one, and
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
demanded from the other, to be applied to the use of—the
<HI>distressed</HI> Mr. Hastings.</P>
<P>The money, it was alledged by Mr. Hastings, had been
originally taken to discharge the Arrear of the Army. It
had not been applied to that use, because it was received in
bills on Gopal Dos, a rich Banker, of Benares, who was
then kept a prisoner by Cheit Sing.—Major Scott being
questioned on the subject, declared, that bills on Gopal Dos
were as good as cash; for that, though the principal of the
house was a prisoner, that circumstance made no difference
whatsoever with the other partners. Thus Mr. Hastings was
inconsistent with himself, by alledging an objection which
should have prevented his taking the money, in the first
instance, for the purpose he had stated; and Major Scott
contradicting Mr. Hastings, removed the objection, and
restored the business to its original footing.—But, through
all those windings of mysterious Hypocrisy, and of artificial
Concealment, it was easy to mark the sense of hidden Guilt.
Mr. Hastings himself, being driven from every other hold,
advanced the stale plea of <HI>State Necessity:</HI> but of this necessity
he had brought no proof; it was a necessity which listened to
whispers, for the purpose of crimination, and dealt in ru∣mour
to prove its own existence.—To a General leading the
armies of Britain; to an Admiral bearing her thunders over
the seas,—the plea of Necessity might be indulged, if the
wants of those were to be supplied whose blood had been
spilt in the service of their country; but then, like the im∣perial
eagle descending from its nest, though it desolated
the skirts of the rock, the Motive and the Conduct would be
equally conspicuous. No concealment would then be neces∣sary,
and they would disdain the veil which covered the dark
mean arts of busy Peculation.</P>
<P>On the business of the Treaty of Chunar, which succeeded
the acceptance of this bribe, Mr. Sheridan was equally per∣spicuous
and equally severe. It was a proceeding, he ob∣served,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
which, as it had its beginning in Corruption, had
its continuance in Fraud, and its end in Violence. The first
proposition of the Nabob after his recent liberality, was,
that the army should be removed, and all the English re∣called
from his dominions. The Bribe which he had given
was the obvious price of their removal. He felt the weight
of their oppression—he knew, to speak his own language,
"that, when the English staid, they staid to ask for some∣thing."
Though their predecessors had exhausted the reve∣nue
—though they had shaken the tree until nothing remained
upon its <HI>leafless</HI> branches, yet a new flight was on the wing
to watch the first <HI>buddings</HI> of its prosperity, and to nip every
promise of future luxuriance.</P>
<P>To this demand Mr. Hastings had promised to accede,
and to recal every Englishman from the province; but by an
evasion, which Mr. Middleton disclosed with so much diffi∣culty
to their Lordships, on the last day of his appearance,
the promise was virtually recalled. No <HI>orders</HI> were afterwards
given for the establishment of Englishmen in the province,
but <HI>recommendations</HI> of the same effect, with Mr. Middleton
and the Vizier, were sent, and the practice continued.—In
the agreement respecting the Refumption of the Jaghires,
the Nabob had been duped by a similar deception. He had
demanded and obtained leave to resume those of certain indi∣viduals:
Mr. Hastings, however, defeated the permission,
by making the order general; knowing that there were some
favourites of the Nabob whom he could be by no means
brought to dispossess.—Such was the conduct of Mr. Hastings,
not in the moment of cold or crafty policy, but in the hour
of confidence, and the effervescence of his gratitude for the
favour he had just received. Soaring above every common
feeling, he could deceive the man to whose liberality he
stood indebted—even his <HI>Gratitude</HI> was <HI>perilous</HI>—and a <HI>danger</HI>
actually awaited on the return which he was to make to an
effusion of generosity!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
The transactions in which Sir <HI>Elijah Impey</HI> bore a share,
and the tenor of his evidence, were the next objects of Mr.
Sheridan's animadversion.—The late Chief Justice of Bengal,
he remarked, had repeatedly stated, that Mr. Hastings left
Calcutta with <HI>two</HI> Resources in his view,—those of <HI>Benares</HI>
and of <HI>Oude.</HI> It appeared, however, from every circum∣stance,
that the latter resource was never in his contempla∣tion,
until the insurrections in Benar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>, terminating in the
capture of Bedjeygur, had destroyed all his hopes in that
province. At that instant the min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of Mr. Hastings, fertile
in resources, fixed itself on the Treasures of the Begums,
and Sir Elijah Impey was dispatched to collect materials for
their crimination. "But I have ever thought," said Mr.
Sheridan, "the selection of such a personage, for such a
purpose, one of the greatest aggravations of the guilt of
Mr. Hastings."—That he, the purity of whose character
should have influenced his conduct, even in his most domestic
retirements; that he, who, if consulting the dignity of
British Justice, should have remained as stationary as his
Court in Calcutta;—that such a man should be called to
travel <HI>Five Hundred</HI> miles, for the transaction of such a bu∣siness,
was a deviation without a plea, and a degradation
without example.—This, however, was in some degree a
question to be abstracted for the consideration of those who
adorned and illumined the seats of Justice in Britain, and
the purity of whose character precluded the necessity of any
further observations on so different a conduct.</P>
<P>With respect to the manner in which Sir Elijah Impey
had delivered his evidence, it required some observation,
though made without imputing to that gentleman the smallest
culpability. Sir Elijah had admitted, that in giving his
evidence he had never answered without looking equally to
the probability, and the consequences of the fact in question.
Sometimes he had even admitted circumstances of which he
had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
had taken place. By consulting in this manner what was
<HI>probable,</HI> and the contrary, he might certainly have corrected
his memory at times, and Mr. Sheridan said he would
accept that mode of giving his testimony, provided that the
inverse of the proposition might also have place, and that
where a circumstance was <HI>improbable,</HI> a similar degree of
credit might be subtracted from the testimony of the witness.
<HI>Five</HI> times in the House of Commons, and <HI>twice</HI> in that
Court, for instance, had Sir Elijah Impey borne testimony,
that a rebellion was raging at Fyzabad, at the time of his
journey to Lucknow. Yet on the <HI>eighth</HI> examination, he
had contradicted all the former, and declared, that what he
meant was that the rebellion <HI>had</HI> been raging, and the
country was then in some degree restored to quiet.—The
reasons assigned for the former errors were, that he had for∣gotten
a letter received from Mr. Hastings, informing him
that the rebellion was quelled, and that he had also forgot∣ten
his own proposition of travelling through Fyzabad to
Lucknow. With respect to the letter, nothing could be
said, as it was not in evidence; but the other observation
would scarcely be admitted, when it was recollected that in
the House of Commons Sir Elijah Impey had declared that
it was his proposal to travel through Fyzabad, which had
originally brought forth the information that the way was
obstructed by the rebellion!—From this information Sir
Elijah Impey had gone by the way of Illyabad,—but what
was yet more singular, was, that on his return he would
again have returned by the way of Fyzabad, if he had not
been again informed of the danger;—so that had it not been
for these friendly informations, the Chief Justice would have
run plump into the very <HI>focus</HI> of the rebellion!—There were
two circumstances, however, worthy of remark;—the <HI>first</HI>
was, that Sir <HI>Elijah Impey</HI> should, when charged with so
dangerous a commission as that of procuring evidence, to
prove that the <HI>Begums</HI> had meditated the expulsion of their
son from the Throne, and of the English from Bengal,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
should twice intend to pass through the city of their resi∣denc;
and that he, as he alledged, from mere motives of
schoolboy coriosity, should choose the <HI>primrose</HI> path—and
with, when engaged in such a business, to loiter in the way,
and idle in the sun-shine.—The second circumstance worthy
of observation, was, that if a conclusion could be made
from a cloud of circumstances, the inference on this occasion
would undoubtedly be, that Sir Elijah Impey was dissuaded
by Mr. Hastings, and Mr. Middleton from passing by the
way of Fyzabad, as well knowing, that if, as a friend to
Mr. Hastings, he were to approach the Begums, he would
be convinced by his reception, that nothing could be more
foreign from the truth than the idea of their supposed disaf∣fection.
—It was also observable, that Sir Elijah Impey, at
Lucknow, taking evidence in the face of day in support of
this charge of rebellion against the Begums, when conversing
with the Nabob and his Minister, heard not a single word
from either of a rebellion, by which it was proposed to de∣throne
the Nabob, and to change the Government of his
dominions!—And equally unaccountable it appeared that
Sir Elijah Impey, who had advised the taking of those affi∣davits
for the safety of Mr. Hastings, had never read them
at the time, for the purpose of seeing whether they were suf∣ficient
for the purpose, or the contrary!—After so long a
reserve, however, and after declaring on oath that he thought
it unnecessary, the next step taken by Sir Elijah Impey, was
to read the affidavits, as, however late, they might contribute
something to his information. He had been led to this
study by his own allegation, from having been misted by
Mr. SHERIDAN, one of the managers on the part of the
Commons, who by looking at a book which he held in his
hand, had persuaded him to declare that a sworn interpreter
was present on the receiving of those-affidavits; that Major
Davy was present for that purpose—and that whoever it was,
he was perfectly satisfied with his conduct on the occasion;
when it was actually in evidence that no interpreter whatso∣ever
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
was present.—Now, said Mr. Sheridan, how I, by
merely looking into a book, could <HI>intimate</HI> the presence of
an interpreter, could <HI>inculcate</HI> the assistance of Major Davy,
and could also <HI>look</HI> the satisfaction conceived by Sir Elijah
Impey, are questions which I believe that Gentleman alone
is able to determine!</P>
<P>He should admit, however, he said, that Sir Elijah Impey
had not strictly attended to forms on the occasion of taking
those affidavits; that he had merely directed the bible to be
given to the Whites, and the Koran to the Blacks, and had
packed up in his wallet the returns of both without any
further enquiry; or that he had glanced over them in India,
having previously cut off all communication between his <HI>eye</HI>
and his <HI>mind,</HI> so that no consciousness was transferred from
the former to the latter; and that he had read them in Eng∣land,
if possible, with less information:—however strange
these circumstances might be, he would admit them all;—
he would even admit, that the affidavits were legally and
properly taken—and yet would prove that those affidavits
were not sufficient to sustain any one point of criminality
against those who were the subjects of the present Charge.</P>

SPEECH
CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, JUNE THE 6th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN then resumed his speech, where he
had left off on Tuesday last, with a short preface
to the following effect:</P>
<P>In obedience to the commands of the Honourable Ma∣nagers,
he said, he rose to continue the observations which
he had to make, in summing up the evidence on the second
Charge against Warren Hastings, Esq.—In doing this, he
trusted it would be believed that he had been, and would
continue to be, most guarded in quoting the evidence on
which he might have to animadvert, correctly and accurately,
and that for this purpose he had left off where he did, a part
of what he wished to observe on not being in the way. He
left off at the affidavits, and here it was that he meant to re∣sume
his speech: he considered their Lordships as in fact
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in trying the truth of the matter of those affida∣vits,
and the allegations therein contained, upon which he
would have no objection to rest the whole truth of the charge
brought against the prisoner. It was in this view, and for
this purpose, that he wished to take up some part of their
Lordships time; but, before he entered into the discussion of
the affidavits, there were two or three matters on which he
was desirous of saying a few words. In the outset of this
business, it had been held forth as an allegation on the part
of the prisoner at the bar, and as an excuse of the atrocious
proceeding against the Begums, that they had been guilty
of various acts of hostility, as well as of a wish to dethrone
the Nabob; and it was assorted that the affidavits taken at
Lucknow all tended to prove these facts. Of the first of
these two allegations, he challenged the Counsel for the pri∣soner
to produce a single instance drawn from those affidavits.
There was not a single instance,—nay, the allegation was
even abandoned by themselves;—a pretty strong proof that
it had been taken up lightly. When a charge consisted of
two parts, and one of them was abandoned, it was very na∣tural
for a man to distrust the other. It certainly was not a
proof that the other was false also, nor did he mean to assume
any such argument; he said only, that it would influence the
mind so far as to make it curious and particular in the en∣quiry,
and to make it at least distrust the truth of the other
branch of the charge also. But their Lordships, in this par∣ticular
case, would have additional reason for jealousy and
distrust: they would recollect from whom these assertions and
charges against the Begums came, and by whom they were
made: they were made by Mr. Hastings, who went forth
from Calcutta in the year 1781, for the avowed purpose of
collecting a large sum of money, and who acknowledged
that he had but two resources. Here then we had, in the
same person, the accuser and the judge—nay more, we had
a judge corruptly interested in the accusation he was to
make, and who intended to draw a profit, and reap an ad∣vantage,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
from deciding on the accusation which he himself
made. He would not take up their Lordships time, in say∣inga
word on the gross turpitude of such a double character,
nor on the frontless disregard of all the feelings which ought
to actuate the human heart, in thus mixing characters that
ought never to be joined. What did he desire from all this?
Only that an accusation, made under such circumstances,
should not meet with implicit belief, and that their Lord∣ships,
remembering that it was so made, would accompany
him through the discussion of the affidavits, free and unin∣fluenced
by those prefatory and general assertions.</P>
<P>The next matter that he was anxious to pross on their
consideration, previous to his taking up the affidavits, was
the infinite improbability of such an intention being true,
from the utter impossibility of executing the design. Esti∣mating
the power of the Begums at the most sanguine stand∣ard,
it could not evidently be in their reach to accomplish
any overthrow, decisive or momentary, of the Nabob, much
less of the English. He was not, however, so weak as to
assert a doctrine, that because a thing was improbable, it
was not therefore attempted; or that, because they had no
interest in the accomplishment of the object, they there∣fore
did not undertake it. He could not look to Mr.
Hastings without knowing, and being forced to acknowledge,
that there were people with such a perverse turn of mind as
to prosecute mischief without interest; and that there were
passions in the human soul, which lead to turpitude without
a motive.</P>
<P>He now came to the consideration of the affidavits—that
mass of legal evidence on which the prisoner meant to rest
his defence, and which he considered of so much consequence
to his acquittal on this charge. He had said, that when the
Honourable Mover of the Impeachment came to this charge,
he treated the affidavits in his peculiar manner, and loaded
them with terms of opprobrious reproach. What the pecu∣liar
manner of his Honourable Friend was, as hinted in this
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
manner, he could not tell; but he, for his own part, would
say, that if they were treated otherways than with disdain,
they had not their desert. It was asserted, that they were
taken in the desire of procuring the best possible evidence of
the state of the country, and of the circumstances of the
insurrection. This was a direct falshood;—they were taken
for no other purpose but that of justifying Mr. Hastings in
his plunder of the Begums; that no other intention was in
the minds of any of the persons concerned, and that the
design was not formed, until, by the failure of one of his
resources, this only remained for the plunderer.</P>
<P>He left off with the crippled testimony of his friend Dewen
Sing. Here then he began, and he entered into a minute
discussion of all the affidavits, reading, comparing, and
commenting on the passages. To enumerate all these would
require much space; nor, unless the reader was well ac∣quainted
with all the facts, would it be possible for us to
make him taste and feel the strength of Mr. Sheridan's rea∣soning,
which was as close, connected, and convincing, as
any speech we ever heard on any occasion. He particularly
animadverted on the affidavits of Hyder Beg Cawn, who,
though the Minister of the Nabob, and the man of all others
the best acquainted with the transactions then passing in the
country, did not say one syllable on the subject of the pre∣tended
rebellion, nor hint any thing of the kind; and this,
though the affidavit was made in November, 1781, and the
rebellion was pretended to have been at least previous to that
time:—on that of Mr. Middleton, which also was taken on
the 27th of November, and that after he knew the pleasure
of Mr. Hastings as to the plunder of the Begums. The
only passage which his affidavit contained respecting the in∣surrection,
was, that he had heard from rumour that they
had given much encouragement, and some aid, to the Jag∣hiredars,
in resisting the resumption; and that he heard
there had been a good disposition in them towards the Rajah
Cheit Sing. The whole of his evidence went on mere hear∣say
<PB N="25" REF="23"/>
and rumour, and it amounted to much encouragemet
and some aid—on which circumstance it was that he made
up his conscience to the plunder, and probably to the de∣struction
of the ladies. He knew nothing of it himself,
though he was the Resident. He saw no insurrection; he
met with no indispositions; he knew nothing of it himself,
but he had heard that they had encouraged the Jaghiredars
to resist, and on this, and no more, was this conscientious
servant of Mr. Hastings ready to execute any scheme of
plunder that he should devise.—The Hon. Manager also
particularly adverted to the affidavit of Major M 'Donald, of
Captain Gordon, and of a Frenchman, whose deposition was
quite in the French style, magnificent and glittering: it
talked of his having penetrated the desarts—of his having
seen tygers—of his having kept the best company—and
heard a vast number of important rumours, but not one
word about the rebellion of the Begums.—He went through
the affidavits of Colonel Hannay, and, among others, to
that stating that three Zemindars, on the 31st of December,
had said, that they were credibly informed that there was a
design in the Begums against the Nabob. But these consci∣entious
Serjeants would not suffer their names to be men∣tioned:
all the reward that they expected was to be con∣cealed
—although they were thus rendering service to their
Sovereign, and that that Sovereign was now in entire posses∣sion
of power, and free from all possible effects of any me∣ditated
hostility from the quarter alledged to have designs.</P>
<P>Having stated the contents of the several affidavits, he
said, he knew that in a Court of Law, if the trial were de∣pending
merely on the truth and validity of these affidavits,
he should be stopt, if he attempted to begin any answer to,
and observation upon them. He should be told from the
Bench—What do you mean to answer? There is nothing
contained in these affidavits upon which we can suffer you to
take up the time of the Court one minute. There is not,
from the beginning to the end, one particle of legal, sub∣stantial,
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
or even a defensible proof. Nothing but hearsay
and rumour. Such he knew would be the admonition
which he should receive in any Court of Law; but meaning
and wishing to meet every thing at their Lordship's bar, on
which the prisoner could build the smallest degree of depend∣ance,
it was his wish to examine separately the points which
it was the aim of the prisoner to set up by these affidavits.
They were three in number, and he should treat of each
singly.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Begums gave assistance to the Rajah Cheyt
Sing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they encouraged and assisted the Jaghiredars to
resist the resumptions of the Jaghires.</ITEM>
<ITEM>And, 3. That they were the principal movers of all the
commotions in Oude.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se were the three allegations, which it was meant to
insinuate these affidavits contained—and all these were ac∣companied
with a general charge, that the Begums were in
rebellion. He declared, that in regard to the last insinua∣tion,
he had searched with all the indefatigable industry of
an antiquary, hunting for a precious vestige that was to
decide some important point in history, for this rebellion.—
But of this rebellion, which in the mouth of Mr. Hastings
was spoken of with as much certainty as that of 1745 was
mentioned in England, no trace nor appearance could he
find.—He could neither find the place where it raged, nor
time when. No battle had been fought—no army had
marched—no blood had been spilt—not one single thing had
happened, by which any one creature in the country where
it was said to happen could possibly have discovered that a
rebellion was there. It was a rebellion that never struck a
blow, and that never was struck.—It was a rebellion, the
object of which was unnatural, but which died a natural
death. If rebellions of such a kind could be, there was no
saying where a rebellion might not exist. Perhaps, at the
very moment that he was speaking, there might be a rebel∣lion
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
raging in the heart of London. Perhaps it might be at
this moment lying perdue in some of the adjacent villages;
or like the ostentatious encampment that had given celebrity
to Brentford and Ealing, it might have taken up its head
quarters at Hammersmith, or Istington, ready to pour down
its violence on the approach of night. He was very eager
to ascertain the time of this horrid rebellion. There was
nothing so clear and manifest as this fact—that there was
none in the beginning of August 1781. On the 29th of
that month there were confidential letters from Col. Morgan
the commanding officer, and there was not one syllable in
these letters of any such thing. He afterwards detache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> troops
from Cawn Poote; and on the 27th of September he
gives an account of some insurrection at Lucknow; but of
none at Fyzabad, nor of any thing like it. There was a
letter from Major Hannay, then at the Rajah's Court, dated
the 10th of September, in which there is an account of the
state of the Rajah's affairs; but not one syllable of any de∣sign
of his being assisted by the Begums. There was after
this a letter from the same Court, communicating the re∣fources
of the Rajah. In this letter he was advised to apply
to the Nabob himself, from whom there was a probability of
his receiving succour; but not to apply to Hyder Beg, who
was stated to be interest of the English. During all
this time, therefore, there was no rebellion. The Nabob
went to see his mother, the very lady who was said to have
risen in rebellion against him. But Mr. Middleton stated,
that he was accompanied by 2000 horse, having no martial
memory on common occasions. Mr. Middleton could exactly
tell that these troops kept pace with the Nabob, who tra∣velled
very fast, so much so that he could hardly keep up
with him; but the Nabob having, according to Mr. Mid∣dleton,
taken 2000 horse with him, he observed the Coun∣sel
seized on the 2000 horse, and certainly meant to assert
that these 2000 horse were taken for no other purpose than
to quell the insurrection; unfortunately, however, for the
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
martial memory of Mr. Middleton, Captain Edwards, who
was rather more of a military man, and whose duty it was to
accompany the Nabob, stated that he had but five or six
hundred horse, and those so miserably equipped, and so bad
that they were not able to keep up with him, and but a few
indeed were near his person, or within the reach of any com∣mand,
so as to be applied to any service; for of these few,
the most were disaffected and mutinous from being ill paid;
so that the horse that he had with him were rather disposed
to assist than to quell any insurrections. Still more unfortu∣nately,
the memory of Mr. Middleton had unexpectedly
cleared up, and informed the Court that it was a constant
thing for the Princes of India to travel with a great equi∣page,
and that it was considered as a disrespect to the person
whom they visited, to come unattended. But the Counsel
should have the whole of the horse, camels, elephants, and
all, and they should all gallop as fast as they might please to
wish.—What did they mean, or wish to establish from this
fact? It never was their intention to insinuate that the Na∣bob
went to pay his respects to his mother unattended by his
retinue. He could not mean to go <HI>incog.</HI> unless he wished
to keep pace with the rebellion.—That hearing of a rebellion
of two old women without an army, he thought that it
should be quelled by a Prince in disguise, without his
guards. They did not mean to say that the Indian Princes
travelled like the Princes of Europe, who sometimes from
one motive, and sometimes from another—at times from
political views, and at times from curiosity—travelling some
to France to learn manners, others to England to learn
liberty—chose to be relieved from the pomps of state, and
from the drudgery of equipage.—It was not so in India—
where the manners required ostentation, and where it would
be considered as an insult for one Prince to visit another
without maintaining his state.</P>
<P>He then, as he said, would put to the route a thousand
audges, who were said to be dispatched by the Begums, for
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
the purpose of promoting an insurrection. He detected all
the contradictory accounts that had been given of these
matchlock-men, and having shewn the complete fallacy at∣tempted
to be imposed on the credulity of the world in this
instance, he asked why the younger son of the Bhow Begum
had not been suspected of having any concern or interest in
this rebellion? This particularly had been very thoroughly
explained. Sir Elijah Impey had been asked whether this
Prince had any wealth?—No, none—he was miserably poor,
and was a pensioner—there was the solution of the difficulty.
There never was in the mind of Mr. Hastings a suspicion
of <HI>treason</HI> where there was not <HI>treasure.</HI> Penury was a com∣plete
and satisfactory proof that he could not be disaffected—
opulence on the contrary was a manifest indication of disloy∣alty.
Mr. Hastings, in his political sagacity, took the con∣verse
of the doctrine that the experience of history had
established; that opulence and wealth, as they attached a
man to the country where they lay, made him cautious and
circumspect how he hazarded any enterprize that might
draw on himself the jealousy of Government. Poverty on
the other hand made a man giddy and desperate; having no
permanent stake, he was easily seduced into commotion.
Mr. Hastings, on the contrary, never failed to find a con∣vincing
and self-evident proof of attachment in penury, and
an unanswerable evidence of rebellion in wealth.</P>
<P>In enumerating the various strong instances of the steady
friendship and good disposition of the Begums to the English
interests, Mr. Sheridan particularly animadverted on the
representation they had made in favour of Captain—,
whose life they had saved at the very moment when, if they
had meant to strike any blow against the English interests,
the blow would have been felt.—This gentleman, whose
life the Bhow Begum had saved, and who in the first and
natural feelings of the soul, had repeatedly poured forth his
grateful acknowledgements of the obligation, had afterwards
been made the instrument of the destruction of his faviour.
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
It had been asked why the Managers had not called Captain
—to the bar.—Why call him to the bar!—He never
hoped to see him at the bar till he came there with fervent
contrition and penitentiary zeal, to make atonement to the
Princess, who was to him his second creator, and whom,
with the breath of life, the gift of the Begum, he had
accused; and in the presence of their common God; had
solemnly poured forth a part of that breath in an affidavit,
by which her ruin was to be accomplished! He would not
believe it possible, that after having repeatedly acknowledged
that he owed his life and liberty to the beneficent hand of
this Lady, he could so far forget all that he owed, as of his
own mere motion to come forward and make this affidavit.
His knowledge of human feelings would not permit him to
believe that it could be possible for any human creature to be
guilty of an act so atrocious.—He must imagine that the
Gentleman had been deluded and imposed upon—that he
had been falsely and scandalously deceived—and that at the
moment when he made that affidavit, he was ignorant of the
use to which it was to be applied.—He hoped, and trusted,
that seeing that he was made the instrument of the ruin, and
overthrow of his benefactress, he would come forward and
state the imposition that had been practised upon him—for
he could not be persuaded that any human creature could be
capable of standing up in the presence of God, and exclaim∣ing
—To this woman I owe my life, and my gratitude shall
be her destruction.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan continued in a strain of eloquence more
lofty and commanding than any thing we ever heard, to
state the circumstance of the book, the leaves of which were
torn out, and which was mutilated for the purpose of con∣cealment.
After stating all the circumstances of this fact,
and the manner in which the fact had been accounted for,
he called it a black perjury.—Then rising in his eloquence
to a flight beyond our power to trace him, he said, that
these letters, though thus torn and mangled, were brought
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
light.—That power which gives to the arms of infant inno∣cence
the strength of Hercules—which controuls the mighty,
and abashes the confident—which gives to truth persuasion
beyond the reach of eloquence—the look that appalls—the
supplicating tear that softens—the tone tender, but con∣firmed,
which at once foothes and convinces the soul—that
power, which in all the turns and windings of hypocritical
and impudent falsehood ever ranges on the side of simple and
unobtruding truth, leads the mind through all the mazes of
craft and wickedness, with which this mysterious villainy is
covered, and arousing all the indignation of justice, points
its punishment, Heaven-directed, to the head of the detested
but unrepenting author.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan proceeded to shew in how many instances,
and at what critical times the sincere friendship of the Be∣gums
had distinguished itself, and been exerted in our
favour. In that critical moment, when after the affair of
Captain Gordon, the interests of Mr. Hastings were, ac∣cording
to his own account, almost desperate; during the
whole time, from the 22d of August to the 22d of Septem∣ber,
when with a prodigality of truth he truly confessed that
the situation of himself and his small party was desperate;—
when the hoarded vengeance of Heaven was about to burst,
and seemed to wait only for the completion of his guilt in
the attempt on Cheit Sing, to break on his head, and pre∣cipitate
him to ruin—what did they do? Instead of seizing
on the crisis to carry into effect any scheme they might have
engendered against him—instead of accomplishing his over∣throw,
which with their aid would at that moment have
been certain, these women, with a nobleness worthy of the
sex, though ill applied as to the object, came forward to
share in, not to contribute to his fall.</P>
<P>So much as to the first head of charge against the Begums.
—The second charge, that of their assisting the Jaghiredars,
he should say but little on. We learned in February 1782,
of the Begums having countenanced the resistance.—True—
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
And they now gave this presumed countenance discovered in
February 1782, as a reason which operated to the ruin of
the Princesses in November 1781. He took notice also of
the curious circumstance of Mr. Middleton's sending back
the troops at the desire of the Nabob; but stating that
having done so, the Nabob must pay an extraordinary price
in future, as these troops might be employed against his
own Aumeels.</P>
<P>He now came to the third charge, said to be established
by those affidavits.—That the Begums had been the prin∣cipal
movers of all the commotions in Oude; and here he
confessed he thought there was such a body of damning evi∣dence
as required only to be stated, and which would render
all elucidation unnecessary. The commotions in Oude were
simply and solely to be attributed to the English gentlemen.
The Nabob's description of their rapacity and violence was
itself a full extention of all that was now to be attributed to
the poor old women. He gave a very particular account of
their depredations. They had but one argument, consisting
of two words. They wanted all the money that could pos∣sibly
be raised in the country, by violence, by extortion, by
rapine, or by stealth, but for two purposes, to pay the army,
and fee the administration of Justice. He stated the various
steps which had been taken by the Nabob, to deliver his
devoted country from their violence, and particularly from
the vulture grasp of Colonel Hannay, until at length, as
Major Naylor wrote, a gentleman, whose soul possessed the
qualities of his species, "the inhabitants, whose meek natures
no irritation had been theretofore able to provoke, were at
length goaded into tumult; and in their despair, that meek∣ness,
that yielding, and womanish softness which charac∣terized
every action, changed to a persevering obstinacy that
was not to be subdued."—So that on the banks of the Ganges
where the insurrection happened, the routed would not fly,
the wounded would not suffer themselves to be cured.—Here
again we had opened to us another vein of the richest and
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
purest eloquence, and which in daring to touch, we are sen∣sible
we shall debase.</P>
<P>If, exclaims Mr. Sheridan, if a stranger had at this tim
(in 1782) gone into the kingdom of Oude, ignorant of what
had happened since the death of Sujah Dowla, that man
who with a savage heart had still great lines of character,
and who with all his ferocity in war, had still with a culti∣vating
hand preserved to his country the riches which it
derived from benignant skies, and a prolific soil—if this
stranger, ignorant of all that had happened in the short in∣terval,
and observing the wide and general devastation, and
all the horrors of the scene—of plains uncloathed and brown
—of vegetation burnt up and extinguished—of villages depo∣pulated
and in ruin—of temples unroofed and perishing—of
reservoirs broken down and dry—he would naturally en∣quire,
what war has thus laid waste the fertile fields of this
once beautiful and opulent country—what civil dissensions
have happened thus to tear asunder, and separate the happy
societies that once possessed those villages—What disputed
succession—What religious rage has, with unholy violence,
demolished those temples, and disturbed servent, but unob∣truding
piety, in the exercise of its duties—What merciless
enemy has thus spread the horrors of fire and sword—What
severe visitation of Providence has thus dried up the foun∣tains,
and taken from the face of the earth every vestige of
green?—Or rather, what monsters have stalked over the
country, tainting and poisoning with pestiferous breath,
what the voracious appetite could not devour?—To such
question, what must be the answer? No wars have ravaged
these lands and depopulated these villages—No civil discords
have been felt—No disputed succession—No religious rage—
No merciless enemy—No affliction of Providence, which,
while it scourged for the moment, cut off the sources of re∣suscitation
—No voracious and poisoning monsters—No—All
this has been accomplished by the <HI>friendship, generosity,</HI> and
<HI>kindness</HI> of the English nation—They have embraced us with
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
their protecting arms—and, lo, these are the fruits of their
allian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>. What then, shall we be told, that under such
circumstances, the exasperated feelings of a whole people,
thus goaded and spurred on to clamour and resistance, were
excited by the poor and feeble influence of the Begums!
When we hear from Capt. Naylor the description that he
gives of the paroxism, fever, and delirium, into which des∣pair
had thrown the natives, when on the banks of the
polluted Ganges, panting for death, they tore more widely
open the lips of their gaping wounds, to accelerate their
dissolution, and while their blood was issuing, presented their
ghastly eyes to Heaven, breathing their last and fervent
prayer that the dry earth might not be suffered to drink their
blood, but that it might rise up to the throne of God, and
rouse the eternal Providence to avenge the wrongs of their
country. Will it be said that all this was brought about by
the incantations of these Begums in their secluded Zenana?
or that they could inspire this enthusiasm and this despair
into the breasts of a people who felt no grievance, and had
suffered no torture? What motive then could have such
influence in their bosoms? What motive! That which Na∣ture,
the common parent, plants in the bosom of man, and
which, though it may be less active in the Indian than in
the Englishman, is still congenial with, and makes a part of
his being.—That feeling which tells him, that man was
never made to be the property of man; but that when in
the pride and insolence of power, one human creature dares
to tyrannize over another, it is a power usurped, and resist∣ance
is a duty.—That feeling which tells him that all
power is delegated for the good, not for the injury of the
people, and that when it is converted from the original pur∣pose,
the compact is broken, and the power is to be re∣sumed.
—That principle which tells him that resistance to
power usurped is not merely a duty which he owes to him∣self,
and to his neighbour, but a duty which he owes to his
God in asserting and maintaining the rank which he gave
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
him in his creation!—To that common God, who, where
he gives the <HI>form</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> whatever may be the complexion,
gives also the <HI>feelings</HI> and the <HI>rights</HI> of <HI>man.</HI>—That principle,
which neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle, nor the
enervation of resinement extinguish!—That principle which
makes it base for a man to suffer when he ought to act;
which tending to preserve to the species the original designa∣tions
of Providence, spurns at the arrogant distinctions of
man, and vindicates the independent quality of his race.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, after this, proceeded to say, that he thought
an attentive perusal of all the circumstances, as he had en∣deavoured
to exhibit them to the view of their Lordships, would
satisfy them of the innocence of the Begums. But he was
sensible that the proof of their innocence carried with it no
conclusive proof of the guilt of the prisoner; and this was
the next object of his speech. In a close chain of argument,
he proved that the rebellion was not projected—was not even
in the imagination of Mr. Hastings, until their ruin
had been determined; that the rebellion was an after∣thought,
and was taken up as a means of justification, in
the consciousness that justification was necessary. To prove
this, he shewed, that he never wrote to the Council until
the month of February; that though he wrote letters to
Mr. Wheeler, and though, in his famous narrative, he called
the God of Truth to witness that he had made no conceal∣ment,
he concealed every particle, both of the rebellion and
of the plunder, until he had been able to make up the body
of rant and craft, rhapsody and enigma, which he produced
under the title of "A Narrative of the Transactions." He
shewed, that his pretended reasons for the concealment of
five months, were direct fallacies; and having taken pains
to elucidate these points, he said, that it had been a practice
with Mr. Hastings to hold himself out as a preternatural
being, gifted with good fortune, or else the peculiar favou∣rite
of Heaven, and that Providence never failed to take up
and carry, by wise but hidden means, every project of his
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
to its destined end. In this blasphemous way did the prisoner
at the bar libel the course of Providence. Thus, according
to him, when his corruptions and briberies were on the eve
of exposure, Providence inspired the heart of Nundcomar to
commit a low base crime, in order to save Mr. Hastings from
ruin. Thus also, when in his attempts on Cheyt `Sing, and
his plunder of the Begums, Providence stepped in, and in∣spired
the one with resistance, and the other with rebellion,
to forward his purposes. Thus did he arrogantly hold him∣self
forth as a man, not only the favourite of Providence,
but as one for whose sake Providence departed from the
eternal course of its own wise dispensations. Thus did he
presume to say, that he was honoured and assisted in the
administration of office by inspired felonies, heaven born
armies, and providential treasons! arraigning that Provi∣dence
whose works are goodness, and whose ways are
right.</P>
<P>It seemed, through the whole of his defence upon this
charge, that Mr. Hastings, sensible that truth would undo
him, thought that falshood of any nature would serve his
turn. In this view he had drawn together a set of false∣hoods,
without consistency, and without connection, not
knowing, or not remembering, that there is nothing which
requires so much care in the fabrication as a system of lies.
The series must be regular and unbroken; but his falshoods
were eternally at variance, and demolished one another.
Indeed, in all his conduct he seemed to be actuated but by
one principle—to do things contrary to the established form.
This architecture militated against the first principles of the
art. He begun with the frieze and the capital, and laid the
base of the column at the top. Thus having his house
turned up-side down, he plumed himself on the novelty of
his idea, till it came trembling about his ears. His fortifi∣cation
was equal to his architecture. He raised a rampart
on a spot which the enemy might command: he meant to
surround himself with a fosse, but left an opening for the
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
assailant. He built on a precipice, and encamped on a
mine.</P>
<P>Perhaps it might be said, that that guilt could not be
great, where the veil with which it was covered was so thin.
He was not of this opinion. His honourable and exalted
friend, who had opened generally to their Lordships the
articles of Impeachment, and whose name he never could
mention but with the respect and admiration due to his virtue
and his talents; whose proud disdain of vice could only be
equalled by the ability with which he corrected it; whose
eloquence was not transitory, as happily there were portions
of it that would be felt and admired, when all of the assembly
then present would be mute, and most of them forgotten—
his honourable friend had said, in opening the charges,
"that there was something in the nature and conformation
of vice, which made it inconsistent with prudence." He
could not agree implicitly with his honourable friend in this
sentiment. If the true definition of prudence were the dis∣crete
management and conduct of a purpose to its successful
end, he thought he could imagine to himself instances in
which this species of prudence might be discovered in minds
distinguished by the atrocity of their acts. When he ob∣served
the actions of a Philip of Macedon, of a Caesar, of a
Cromwell, he could perceive great guilt successfully con∣ducted
to its end, if not by legitimate prudence, at least by
consummate craft. It was therefore his opinion, that the
doctrine of his honourable friend held true only in those
minds which could not be satisfied with the indulgence of a
single crime; where, instead of one base master-passion hav∣ing
the complete sway, to which all the faculties were subject,
and on which alone the mind was bent, there was a combus∣tion
and rivalry among a number of bad passions; where
pride, vanity, avarice, lust of power, cruelty, and so forth,
all at once actuated the human soul, and distracted its func∣tions,
—all of them clamouring for destruction, and each in
it own barbarous jargon preferring its claim,—all dissonant
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
and tumultuous,—all of them struggling for pre-eminence
and each counteracting the other. In such a mind, undoubt∣edly,
great crimes could never be accompanied by prudence.
There was a fortunate disability, occasioned by the conten∣tion,
that rescued the human species from the villainy of the
intention. Such was the original denunciation of Nature.—
Not so was it with the pure passions: in the breast where
they resided, the harmony was never interrupted by the
number; a perfect and substantial agreement gave an accession
of vigour to each, and spreading their influence in every
direction, like the divine intelligence and benignity from
which they flowed, all of them filling their several spaces,
some in their larger, some in their more contracted orbits,
moving by sweet consent in their allotted place,—they se∣cured
true glory and happiness to the individual by whom
they were possessed, and extended it to the community of
which he was a member.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan was then proceeding to shew, that the Nabob
had violated the covenant of Nature, in rising up against
his mother; but that to this shameless outrage he was
driven by the tyranny of the prisoner, who, as he had be∣fore
said, had made him a <HI>slave,</HI> to compel him to become
—a <HI>monster!</HI></P>

<HEAD>MR. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>TUESDAY, JUNE THE 10th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN began without any other preface
than this, that relying on the indulgence with which
he had been hitherto so largely honored, he would resume his
speech, he said, where he had stopped on the preceding day,
without taking up any of their Lordships time in preliminary
matter. He had left off with that part of the body of evi∣dence
which proved the abject state of vassalage in which
the Nabob was held, and by which it was, in his opinion,
rendered manifest, that every act of his, particularly those
strong acts in which he violated every obligation of a son,
were done not merely at the instigation, but absolutely at
the command of the prisoner. It would not be difficult to
prove, that if he had been independent he certainly would
not have committed those acts, and this he should be able to
demonstrate to their Lordships. But first he begged leave to
say, that in the perpetration of those shameful and atrocious
crimes which made the subject of the present charge, there
were three principal, and three subordinate actors. The
three principal, or rather the one great and leading princi∣pal,
with his two chief coadjutors, were Mr. Hastings,
Mr. Middleton, and Sir Elijah Impey.—The three subordi∣nate
actors were Colonel Hannay, Hyder Beg Cawn, and
Ali Abram Cawn. Before he proceeded to shew that every
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
one of the acts were forcibly imposed on the Nabob, he
made some observations on part of the evidence of Sir Elijah
Impey. He had given as a reason for not having at any
time after he took the affidavits, conversed with Mr. Hastings
on the subject to which they alluded, that he quitted Chunar
the next day, and that therefore he had not had an oppor∣tunity
of seeing, in order to converse with him on that or
any subject. Mr. Sheridan shewed, from letters written by
Sir Elijah and Mr. Hastings, that they had quitted Chunar
in company, and had continued together for some time. Sir
Elijah had stated also, that he had delivered the affidavits
into the hands of Mr. Hastings, and knew nothing of them
afterwards. Mr. Sheridan shewed that Major Davie had
received the Persian affidavits from Sir Elijah to translate on
the 12th of December, although Sir Elijah had said that he
gave them to Mr. Hastings previous to his quitting Chunar,
which was on the 1st of December. Mr. Sheridan said, he
took notice of these facts just to shew the respect that was to
be paid to the testimony of Sir Elijah.</P>
<P>With regard to the affidavits as a body of evidence, the
whole was mere hearsay and rumour. Captain Scott, who
by being in the country where the scene of the rebellion was
said to lye, had had a good opportunity of knowing the
facts, was not examined, and the testimony of Hoolas Roy,
who of all others was the best informed on the subject, was
suppressed. That his affidavit was taken was manifest, and
he called on the prisoner to say where this affidavit was con∣cealed,
and why it was withheld. Mr. Sheridan said, that
in the celebrated letter written by Mr. Hastings, dated the
19th of December, his own knowledge of the transactions
was the most confused and contradictory that could be ima∣gined.
He enumerated the various contradictions of that
letter.—He said that Mr. Hastings had made a number of
curious assertions in regard to the plunder of the treasures,
and resumption of the jaghires.—The proposition was first
made to him, that the treasures should be taken as an alter∣native
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
for the jaghires, but in making that proposition it
was said, that they belonged of right to the Nabob.—Mr.
Hastings took it in the first sense, as he called it; that was,
he determined to seize on the treasures, not as an alternative
for the jaghires, but to take them first because the proposi∣tion
was made, and to take the jaghires afterwards. He
was very anxious to have it believed that the proposition
came from the Nabob, although, by the whole tenor of Mr.
Middleton's letters, confidential as well as public, it was
demonstrated with what difficulty they were able to extort
from him his consent to the violence. Mr. Sheridan adverted
to the curious letter written by Mr. Hastings to Mr. Middle∣ton
and Mr. Johnson, saying that the treaty made by him
with the Nabob at Chunar, from its favourable tendency,
had given rise to suspicions that money had been taken to
procure it, and calling on them to exculpate themselves.—
Upon which they with great formality declared on their
honours, and before God, that they had neither received
any bribe, nor had an idea of any; which declaration,
made with so much solemnity, satisfied Mr. Hastings, ari∣sing
a little perhaps from the consciousness that he had the
money in his pocket. Mr. Sheridan proceeded to shew,
that so far from these acts being done at the instigation of
the Nabob, it was with the utmost difficulty that they could
receive from him a formal sanction, and on this subject
several letters were read by Mr. Adam, and in particular he
reconciled the letters written by Middleton on the 1st and
6th of December, by saying that in regard to the seizure of
the treasure of the Begums he only required a hint from Mr.
Hastings, but as the resumption of the jaghires was likely to
be a service of danger, there nothing less than a public order
would satisfy Mr. Middleton. After arguing this point
with dexterity, Mr. Sheridan came to the extraordinary
letters of Mr. Middleton, dated on the 30th of December,
wherein they are intended for the confidential and private
use of Mr. Hastings; he denied the truth of what he had
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>
said in his public dispatch, which was to be submitted to the
Council, and saying at the same time that if Mr. Hastings
wished him to say any thing, or to give any other colour to
the proceedings, he was ready to do it. Mr. Sheridan,
after placing this disgraceful subserviency in so glaring a
point of view, requested Mr. Adam to read other letters
necessary to illustrate this part of the charge, and to shew
the anxious pains and solicitude of Mr. Hastings to establish
something like an excuse for the turpitude of his conduct.</P>
<P>{inverted ⁂}While these letters were reading, Mr. Sheridan, who
was seized with a sudden, though flight indisposition,
retired to the Managers room. He was, after some
refreshment, desirous of proceeding; but his friends
persuaded him to the contrary; and Mr. Fox came
into the Court, and said, that Mr. Sheridan being by
his indisposition prevented from doing that justice to
the charge which it was his wish to do, the Managers
requested that their Lordships would be pleased to
adjourn, and appoint another day on which he might
proceed.</P>
<P>Their Lordships accordingly withdrew, and sent a mes∣sage
to the House of Commons, that the Court will sit
again on Friday the 13th.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="41"/>
<HEAD>MR. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH CONTINUED,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>FRIDAY, JUNE THE 13th, 1788.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN rose, and being in a great measure
recovered from the indisposition which prevented him
from proceeding on Tuesday, resumed his speech, by thank∣ing
their Lordships for the indulgence they had shewn him,
and assured them that nothing but positive inability to pro∣ceed,
on Tuesday, in a manner worthy of the importance,
and the dignity of his cause, could have induced him to
give them the trouble of sitting another day.</P>
<P>He then reminded their Lordships, that in commenting
on the evidence respecting the resumption of the jaghires,
and the plunder of the Begums, he had left off with the
public and private correspondence between Mr. Hastings
and Mr. Middleton. This correspondence demanded the
most minute attention, for it contained all the facts of that
foul and unmanly conspiracy; it contained a true account of
the cause of that conspiracy, and also the quibbles, the
tricks, the mean shifts and evasions, by which it had been
attempted to conceal it.</P>
<P>On the public correspondence, as contrasted with the
private, he animadverted with the most penetrating acute∣ness;
and exposed the gross contradictions, the laboured
fallacies, and studied misrepresentations that pervaded the
whole.—Their Lordships would naturally enquire with some
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
degree of surprise, how the private letters that were thus to
establish the guilt of their authors had come to light.—In
the middle of December, 1782, a coldness had taken place
between Mr. Hastings and Mr. Middleton. Mr. Hastings had
been hurt at the tardiness with which Middleton proceeded,
and had charged him with the heinous offence of per∣mitting
two days forbearance from the Nabob to his mother.
—From this moment shyness and suspicion between the
principal and the agent took place. Mr. Middleton hesi∣tated
about the expediency of the measure, and began to
doubt whether the advantage would be equal to the risk.
Mr. Hastings, whether he apprehended that Middleton was
retarded by any return of humanity or sentiments of justice,
by any secret combination with the Begum and her son, or
a wish to take the lion's share of the plunder to himself, was
incensed at the delay. Mr. Middleton represented the unwil∣lingness
of the Nabob to put in execution the resumption of
the jaghires; the low state of his finances; that his troops
were mutinous for want of pay; and that his life had been
in danger from an insurrection among them. That in this
moment of distress he had offered one hundred thousand
pounds, in addition to a like sum paid before, as an equiva∣lent
for the resumption which was demanded of him. Of
this offer, however, it appeared the Nabob knew nothing.
In conferring an obligation, it was sometimes contrived,
from motives of delicacy, that the name of the donor should
be concealed from the person obliged; but here was delicacy
of a new sort—the person conferring the favour was to be
kept ignorant that he had conferred it. Yet, after the re∣turn
of Middleton in 1783, there was the same friendly col∣lusion,
the same fraudulent familiarity, between him and
Mr. Hastings, that had existed before this difference took
place. He was brought down in December, 1782, and no
charge was brought against him till April following. Then
it was that Mr. Hastings, in a sudden fit of justice, preferred
the charge against him, and threw down his letters on the
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>
Council-table. Whatever was the meaning of this charge,
whether it was a juggle to elude enquiry, or whether it was
intended to make an impression at Fyzabad; whether Mr.
Hastings drew up the charge, and instructed Mr. Middleton
to draw up an easy defence; or whether Middleton drew up
the charge, and Mr. Hastings the defence, there appeared in
the whole transaction the same habitual collusion in which
they lived—and it ended in a rhapsody, a repartee, and a
poetical quotation. By this act of providential folly, the
private letters were produced, and the production of them
was conclusive proof of the conspiracy. The private letters
were the only part of the correspondence to be looked to.
They were written in the confidence of private communica∣tion,
without any of the motives to palliate and colour
facts, to confound and mislead the judgment, which ap∣peared
on the very face of the public correspondence.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then referred to a letter from Lucknow,
written under such particular circumstances, and at such a
particular period, that had the alledged rebellion of the
Begums ever existed, but in imagination, it must have been
mentioned in that letter. Where then was the proof of the
rebellion? Not where it ought naturally to be found, but in
the affidavits collected by Sir Elijah Impey—In the fabri∣cated
public correspondence between him, Mr. Hastings,
and Mr. Middleton. In that letter there was no mention of
rebellion. It was indeed said, that if such measures were
rigorously pursued as had been set on foot, the people might
be driven from murmur to resistance, and rise up in arms
against their oppressors. Then indeed a little providential
slaughter would substantiate the rebellion which they wished
to find, and afford a pretext for premeditated plunder. But
there was a clumsiness in the fraud, a coarseness in the exe∣cution
which defeated its purpose, and exposed it to detec∣tion.</P>
<P>He animadverted with much severity on the conduct of
Sir Elijah Impey, in collecting the affidavits. At one mo∣ment
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
he appeared in Oude, at another in Chunar, at a third
in Benares, collecting affidavits. The gravity of his business
and the vivacity, the rapidity, the celerity of his move∣ments,
made a singular contrast. To him might have been
applied the words of Hamlet to the ghost, "What, True∣penny!
are you there?" Like the ghost he was heard in
every quarter crying aloud, <HI>swear!</HI> But the similitude
went no farther; he was never heard to give the injunction,
<Q><L>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</L>
<L>Against thy mother ought.</L></Q>
In the memorable private letter from Mr. Middleton of
the 28th of December, 1781, in which he acknowledged
the receipt of a private letter from Mr. Hastings, although
no private letters from the prisoner had been produced—a
circumstance which could only be accounted for, and arise
from the habitual awe in which Middleton was kept by the
domineering power and fascinating influence of his master.
In this letter, Middleton told him, that in the present fer∣mented
state of the country, the resumption could not be
accomplished but with infinite hazard—At the same time
Mr. Johnson wrote him to the same purpose. The words of
his letter were memorable. He thought it would require a
<HI>campaign</HI> to carry into execution the orders for the resump∣tion
of the Jaghires. A campaign against whom! Against
the officers and army of their ally, the Nabob, who had given
the order. This resumption was stated to be for his good,
and for the good of his country, and it was only to be ac∣complished
by a campaign. Such was the manner in which
the English, under the auspices of Mr. Hastings, protected
their allies in India. The protection of the English was the
misery and ruin of the protected. It was the protection of
the vulture to the lamb, which covers while it devours its
prey—which stretching its baleful pinions, and hovering in
mid air, disperses the kites and lesser birds of prey, and
saves the innocent and helpless victim from all talons but its
own.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45"/>
It was curious to remark, that in the correspondence of
these creatures of Mr. Hastings, and in their earnest endea∣vours
to dissuade him from the resumption of the Jaghires,
not a word is mentioned of the measure's being contrary to
honour, to faith, derogatory to national character, unmanly
or unprincipled.—No such thing—They knew the man to
whom they were writing, and their only arguments were,
that it was contrary to policy, to expediency—and that the
event was not likely to prosper in the only way in which it
could be worth the attempt—in the accumulation of money.
Not one word did they mention of the just claims which the
Nabob had to the gratitude and friendship of the English—
Not one syllable of the treaty by which we were bound to
protect him—Not one syllable of the relation which subsisted
between him and the ladies they were about to plunder—
Not one syllable was hinted about justice or mercy—nothing
was ever addressed to him but the apprehension that the
money to be procured would not be worth the danger and
labour with which it must be attended. Such was the source
and origin of all his actions, and it was that base and profli∣gate
motive that, urging him to every species of meanness
and of cruelty, did give such a stamp and impression to his
acts as made them unparalleled in ancient or modern history.
He would be bold to say, that nothing could be found in the
history of human turpitude, nothing in the nervous delinea∣tions
and penetrating brevity of Tacitus, nothing in the
luminous and luxuriant pages of Gibbon, or of any other
historian, dead or living, who, searching into measures and
characters with the rigour of truth, presented to our abhor∣rence
depravity in its blackest shapes, could equal, in the
grossness of the guilt, in the hardness of heart with which
it was conducted, or in the low and groveling motive, the
acts and character of Mr. Hastings—He, who in the base
desire of stripping two helpless women, could stir the son to
rise up in vengeance against them—who when that son had
certain touches of nature in his breast—certain feelings of
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
an awakened conscience to indicate that he was a man—ac∣cused
that son of entertaining peevish objections to the plun∣der
and sacrifice of his mother—Who having destroyed in
his bosom all thought—all reflection—all memory—all con∣science—all
tenderness and duty as a son—all dignity as a
monarch—having destroyed his character, and depopulated
his country, at length brought him to violate the dearest ties
of nature, and countenance the destruction of his parents—
and who having thus debauched this poor and miserable in∣strument
of his crimes to his purpose, deceived and ruined
him in turn. He—this inhuman violator of all ties, sacred
and profane, had in this single crime, he would be bold to
say, no parallel nor prototype in the old world, or the new,
from the day of original sin to the present hour.</P>
<P>And yet when in this climax he thought he had got to the
summit and pinnacle of his guilt, he found something still
more transcendently flagitious. He particularly alluded to
his famous letter, falsely dated the 15th of February, 1782,
in which, at the very moment that he had given the order
for the entire destruction of the Begums, and for the resump∣tion
of the jaghires, expressed to the Nabob the warm and
lively interest which he took in his welfare—the sincerity and
ardour of his friendship—and that though his presence was
imminently wanted at Calcutta, he could not rest a moment
without coming to the Nabob's assistance, and in the mean
time, he had sent four regiments to his aid.—So deliberate
and cool—so hypocritical and insinuating was the villainy of
this man! The heart was exasperated by the malignity of
this arch treason—But at length the Nabob was on his guard
—He could not be deceived by this mask—The offer of the
four regiments developed the object of Mr. Hastings.—He
perceived the dagger bunglingly concealed in the hand that
was held out with a smile to meet him—and we accordingly
heard no more from the Nabob of reliance on the friendship
of Mr. Hastings.—This letter was sent at the very time when
the troops had surrounded the walls of Fyzabad, and now
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>
began the scene of horrors, which, if he merely wished to
rouse their Lordships feelings, he should only have occasion
minutely to describe. To state the violence committed on
that palace, which the piety of the kingdom had raised for
the retreat and seclusion of the objects of its pride and vene∣ration.
He thought he saw innocence reposing in those shades,
rendered sacred by superstition.—Venerable age and helpless
infancy here found an asylum, and to the violation of this
scene were sent an Impey to invigorate the flagging consci∣ence
of a Middleton;—and an Ali Khan assisted by the stouter
villainy of a Hyder Beg. Rapine, outrage, and violence
followed in the train, while Hastings, though standing aloof,
was in fact the master general of the war, and through the
whole of the dreadful scene of horror their Lordships saw
him—"ride in the whirlwind, and direct the storm."</P>
<P>He now with an admirable accuracy and force of reasoning
went over the correspondence, which then passed between
Middleton and the Begums; he particularly alluded to the
letter sent by the Begum to Middleton, with his answer, in
which he declared himself equally the friend of the Nabob
and the Begum, although he had previously sworn in the pre∣sence
of God, that he thought she had hostile designs against
her son and the English, and had made up his conscience to
strip her of every thing she possessed. He execrated the shame∣less
sycophancy of this conduct, that like some of the mon∣sters
of India, cringed to its prey, and fawned on the objects
of its vengeance. In going over these private letters, he came
to that from Mr. Middleton, which the Council for the pri∣soner
had been anxious to have read to the end, in order to
publish an anecdote which they thought would do something
towards supporting the character of Mr. Middleton. It con∣tained
some expressions of earnest and anxious solicitude for
the recovery of a beloved son—and which they meant to in∣sinuate,
were indications of feeling, and of his sense of the
nature of the relative duty and affection which subsisted be∣tween
the parent and the child. How fortunate they had
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
been in their desire of having this anecdote heard, he knew
not—He confessed he thought it did not tend to raise the cha∣racter
of Mr. Middleton—but on the contrary, it operated
very much to his prejudice. It would not be imputed to
him, that speaking abstractedly, he considered the trait of
parental tenderness as a degrading feature in the human heart.
Their Lordships knew well the force of the soft and endear∣ing
relation which subsisted between parent and child; but
surely it would not be said, that the circumstance brought
to their Lordships view by the Counsel, of the fact of Mr.
Middleton's having this sentiment and feeling in his bosom
was therefore intitled to commendation, when with the feel∣ing
in his own bosom he was outraging it in others. Was it
not an aggravation of his guilt, that he who felt the ardent
solicitude of a parent, and who consequently must be sensible
of the reciprocal feelings of a child, could bring himself to
tear asunder, and to violate all those dear and sacred bonds!
Did it not enhance his guilt, that his cruelty was not the re∣sult
of ideotic ignorance, or of savage barbarity?—That he
whose soul was thus sensible to the impressions of tenderness
and love, should be so abandoned as to sacrifice those feelings
to the inhuman will of the tyrant whom he served. He aver∣red
that it increased and magnified his guilt. He would have
been less criminal had he been insensible of tenderness—less
criminal if he had not been so thoroughly acquainted with
the true quality of parental love and filial duty. [Here Mr.
Sheridan gave a picture of filial duty, which, as a piece of
chaste and beautiful painting in language, we know not where
to equal, and which we are utterly unable to copy.]</P>
<P>Filial duty, he said, it was impossible by words to describe,
but description by words was unnecessary. It was that duty
which they all felt and understood, and which required not
the powers of language to explain. It was in truth more
properly to be called a principle than a duty. It required
not the aid of memory—it needed not the exercise of the un∣derstanding
—it awaited not the slow deliberations of reason∣ing.
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
—It flowed spontaneously from the fountain of our feel∣ings.
—It was involuntary in our natures.—It was a quality
of our being, innate, and coeval with life, which though af∣terwards
cherished as a passion was independent of our men∣tal
powers.—It was earlier than all intelligence in our souls.
—It displayed itself in the earliest impulses of the heart, and
was an emotion of fondness that returned in smiles of grati∣tude
the affectionate solicitude—the tender anxieties—the
endearing attentions experienced before memory began, but
which were not less dear for not being remembered.—It was
the sacrament of nature in our hearts, by which the union
of parent and child was sealed and rendered perfect in the
community of love, and which, strengthening and ripening
with life, acquired vigour from the understanding, and was
most lively and active when most wanted—when those who
had supported infancy were sinking into age, and when in∣firmity
and decrepitude found their best solace in the affecti∣ons
of the children they had reared—But he was ashamed to
take up so much of their Lordships time in attempting to
give a cold picture of filial duty, when he saw so many
breathing testimonies in the assembly that surrounded him—
and when he saw every feature of that assembly beaming and
erecting itself in confession of the universal principle.</P>
<P>The manner of disposing of the goods violently seized from
the unfortunate Princesses, their jewels; their wearing appa∣rel,
their furniture even to their table utensils, though in sig∣nificant
objects when compared with other circumstances of
their unhappy situation, was marked with injustice and op∣pression.
—They were sold, or at least put up to sale, by auc∣tion
—a pretended sale, where there were no bidders, who
had not previously agreed on what they should purchase, and
how much they should pay for dividing the spoil. This the
Begum herself lamented in very affecting terms, in a repre∣sentation
to Mr. Middleton, when she says that she finds,
from woeful experience, that even bullion, gold, and jewels,
lose their value the moment it is known they come from her.
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
But the rapacity of Middleton did not stop there, for after
having thus fraudulently disposed of the goods, a new claim
was made for the deficiency, and new cruelties were perpe∣trated
to enforce the payment of a sum which did not con∣stitute
a part of the original fine. Attempts were made to
find out new crimes and new debts due by the Nabob to the
Company, though he had already offended to the amount of
600,000l. Mr. Hastings writes to Mr. Middleton not to
come to a final settlement with the Nabob till he should con∣sult
his CASH-BOOK, which was the faithful record of the
crimes of their allies, and in which he had already discovered
260,000l. worth of treason, that no person had ever before
dreamed of. He accuses by the <HI>Multiplication Table,</HI> tries
by the <HI>Rule of Three,</HI> and condemns, not by the sublime
institute of Timur, or the simple maxims of English juris∣prudence,
but by the unerring rules of <HI>Cocker's Arithmetic.</HI>
—He then proceeded to animadvert on the testimony of
Major Scott, whom he called the incomparable agent of
Mr. Hastings. He had come to the bar, and said, that
though the Defence of Mr. Hastings had not been drawn up
by himself, yet there was one paragraph which he (Mr.
Hastings) had written with his own <HI>proper</HI> hand. That pa∣ragraph
was avowing the resumption of the Jaghires, and
averring it to be consistent with the dictates of humanity,
policy, and justice. "Give me the pen, said Mr. Hastings;
"I will defend the measure as just and necessary. Do you
find <HI>memory,</HI> I will find <HI>character!</HI>" And thus the <HI>twin
warriors</HI> came into the field, each in his proper sphere of
action, and armed for either purpose. Such had been the
daring and unblushing defence of Mr. Hastings, for the
commission of an act, on which their Lordships could have
but one opinion. That it was not consistent with the dic∣tates
of justice, he appealed to those whose peculiar province
it was to administer justice. Those of your Lordships, said
be, who have been distinguished as Statesmen, will spurn at
the idea of its being a measure that can be justified on the
<PB N="53" REF="51"/>
principles of good policy; and that it is not to be defended
by the laws of humanity, he would appeal to that venerable
part of the august tribunal who heard him—they who had
ever proved themselves the distinguished advocates of reli∣gion
and truth.</P>
<P>He now came to the recital of the cruelties perpetrated by
the agents of Mr. Hastings, which he pledged himself to
bring home to the bold culprit at the bar. The first act of
their tyranny was the imprisonment of the Ministers of the
Begums, who were persons of considerable eminence and
distinction in that country, and who had enjoyed much of
the confidence and favour of the late Nabob. Not satisfied
with this, they were loaded with irons, and suffered the
combined horrors of want, imprisonment, and ignominy;
but what aggravated the scandalous injustice of this measure
was, that they had suffered without even the formality of an
enquiry, while that <HI>arch traitor,</HI> Shumshaw Cawn, though
accused of disaffection to the English Government, was suf∣fered
to go about without notice; he had been so much
neglected by those in power that he had not even been com∣plimented
with <HI>fetters,</HI> the usual badge of distinction, which
it was the practice to bestow on opulent traitors.—To his
poverty he owed his protection.—The unfortunate Ministers
of the Begums not having yet satisfied the rapacity of these
plunderers, were ordered to Chunar, where the English flag
was flying as the signal of oppression, there to have corporal
punishment inflicted on them, and one of them actually suf∣fered
it, to the disgrace of the honour, the justice, and hu∣manity
of the British nation. What must have been the
feelings of the British officers upon that occasion, he must
leave those to say who were present. To Major Gilpin he
gave much praise, not only for the candid evidence he gave
at the bar; but for his humane endeavour to alleviate the
sufferings of the unhappy women, for they were the next
objects of Mr. Middleton's <HI>humanity.</HI> The conduct of Mr.
Johnson was of a different kind, though he certainly had
<PB N="54" REF="52"/>
some claim to praise from his <HI>forbearance</HI>—he very <HI>humanely</HI>
writes to Middleton that he did not think it would be <HI>worth
while</HI> to put to death 2000 women and children for the pur∣pose
of enforcing prompt payment of their demands; but
actuated by the fear of the dreadful responsibility under
which Mr. Hastings had placed all his agents, they pro∣ceeded
to carry his orders into execution, and took possession
of the Palace. The sufferings of the women were patheti∣cally
described by Major Gilpin. In a letter dated the 30th
October, 1782, he writes as follows:—<Q REND="inline">Last night, about
eight o'clock, the women in the Khord Mohul, (Lesser
Palace) or Zenana, (womens apartment under the charge
of Latafut Ally Khan) assembled on the tops of the build∣ings,
crying in a most lamentable manner for food; that
for the last four days they had got but a very scanty allow∣ance,
and that yesterday they had got none. The melan∣choly
cries of famine are more easily imagined than
described.—</Q>After such a description of calamity, he
said, he would not trespass on the feelings of their Lordships
by any comments on it. Their indignation against the
author of those calamities rendered any further observations
on that subject unnecessary. It was now for him to prove
that Mr. Hastings was responsible for the actions of his
agents. That he was responsible for the Treaty of Chunar,
he believed, would scarcely be disputed—though Mr. Mid∣dleton
had on the last day of his examination refused to
answer some questions on that subject, lest it might criminate
himself. With an avarice for infamy, and an anxious
desire of monopolizing guilt, Mr. Middleton, when ques∣tioned
about his conduct at Fyzabad, had answered that he
alone was to blame, for Mr. Hastings had written an angry
letter to him, disapproving of what he had done; but what,
said he, will be your Lordships astonishment, when you are
told that this letter from Mr. Hastings contained a gentle
reproach to Mr. Middleton, not for his want of humanity,
but for his lenity! Such was his anxiety to court infamy,
<PB N="55" REF="53"/>
and to solicit guilt, that he scrupled not to encounter igno∣miny
when he might have claimed praise!</P>
<P>Mr. Hastings had urged in his defence, that as he was
not privy to the actions, he could not be responsible for the
guilt. This was not true. Mr. Hastings well knew what
was going forward, though, perhaps, he might be unac∣quainted
with the miserable detail. When a person in
authority desires another to do an illegal act, he certainly is,
to all intents and purposes, answerable for the consequences.
He becomes the principal in the crime, though he might not
be the actual perpetrator of it, and is considered, by every
principle of natural law and natural reason, as the first object
of punishment. What were the orders given by Mr. Hast∣ings?
They were peremptory—and it is proved by Middleton
himself, that he could not have carried them into execution
by any other means than those which had been adopted.
Would any man then be hardy enough to assert, that Mr.
Hastings was not in this instance answerable for the act of his
agent? The communications of Mr. Hastings and Mr. Mid∣dleton
had been frequent and uninterrupted; though he must
say they were more like the secret machinations of a banditti
in a cavern, plotting the destruction of some innocent family.
than the deliberations of British Representatives in India.</P>
<P>Mr. Middleton, however, had at least some regard to
decorum on particular occasions, for, in answer to Mr.
Hastings's letter, accusing him of lenity and forbearance in
the execution of his orders, he answers, "That the Nabob
was <HI>son</HI> to the Begum whom we were to proceed against;
—a <HI>son</HI> against his <HI>mother</HI> must at least save <HI>appearances</HI> in
his mode of proceeding." But Mr. Hastings all along
pretends complete ignorance of the cruelties that were perpe∣trated,
that is, he was ignorant of the exact number of
lashes which were inflected, and the precise weight of the
iron which formed the fetters.—Such was the miserable
sophistry by which he defended himself, though his guilt
<PB N="56" REF="54"/>
was the same as if he had with his own hand inflicted the
punishment.</P>
<P>He then took notice of that part of Mr. Hastings's defence,
the object of which was to criminate the rest of the Board,
or at least to prove that they were equally guilty with him.
Had Sir John Macpherson then (of whose character he
thought highly) no friend that would call him to the bar,
to vindicate himself from so foul an aspersion? Was there
nobody to do justice to the memory of Mr. Wheeler? For
his own part, he was ready to acquit the Members of the
Board from any share in the guilt of the black catalogue of
Mr. Hastings's crimes, though their agreeing to sign the
dispatch to the Court of Directors, not one paragraph of
which was true, was a very inexcusable, and even a criminal
credulity. After commenting with great ingenuity and force
of reasoning on the different paragraphs of the letter to the
Court of Directors, with a view to prove that the whole was
a fabrication, calculated solely to promote the views of
Mr. Hastings, he said, he was convinced that Sir John
Macpherson was now ashamed of his credulity, and would
be glad of an opportunity of vindicating himself from the
imputed guilt, of which Mr. Hastings had been anxious to
give to the Board more than fell to their share.</P>
<P>The tyranny of Mr. Hastings, he said, was not to be
reconciled to the common rules, nor could it be judged of
by the common standard of tyrants. The atrocious cruelties
of a Nero and a Caligula might be ascribed to the impetu∣osity
of passions inflamed to madness, which knew no check,
and which felt no correction. In their delirious career, they
suffered no reflection to intervene, and they knew of no re∣sponsibility
—they had no interval of remorse, no feeling of
equality—they were born to rule, and they considered their
subjects as creatures over whom they had a right to domineer.
That such men, with turbulent, head-strong passions, should
be tyrants, was not so wonderful as it was melancholy. But
how different was the case of Mr. Hastings. He was a cool-thinking,
<PB N="57" REF="55"/>
deliberate tyrant. Born to no rule—entitled to
no superiority—accustomed to converse, to act, and to live
with his equals—bred in mercantile habits, which forced
him to estimate on every measure—and entrusted by a mer∣cantile
Company with a government which was to be carried
on by mercantile principles—Bound to give a faithful ac∣count
of every transaction—and to expose not only the mea∣sure
itself, but the motives that led to it—Who could never
go to bed without discharging this duty—without balancing
the transactions of the day—and reconciling his acts to justice
and policy—Who held up, as it were, a glass rightly to his
own conscience, and was bound to purge it. That such a
man should become a tyrant, militated against every rational
principle of man.—Yet here we saw the monster—a philoso∣phical
tyrant—a cool, deliberate, reasoning tyrant—who
violated the rights of man, with a perfect consciousness of
what those rights were—and who, endowed with the know∣ledge
of the equal rank, as to freedom, granted by the Deity
to human kind, arraigned the wisdom of Providence, by
opposing its dispensations in favour of his species. A tyrant
against man was a libeller of God—and the Court beheld in
the prisoner a creature who had presumed to deface and dis∣order
the beauty and harmony of that system which was
originally granted by Heaven for the happiness of the
earth.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan now drew to his conclusion. He said, their
Lordships would not be surprized, if, after all that they had
heard, he should think the cause for which he stood up per∣fectly
safe, if he called on them to discharge from their
minds all that they had heard of mere language, and only
to attend to facts. A strict examination of the evidence
would so fully and thoroughly convince them of the turpi∣tude
of the prisoner, that he wished to place the whole cause
on that single ground, unornamented by eloquence, and
unassisted by reasoning. One only passage more he should
take notice of.—Mr. Hastings, in the moment when he
<PB N="58" REF="56"/>
stifled the pretended enquiry into the atrocious acts com∣mitted
under his own authority, entered a minute of the
most remarkable kind:—<Q REND="inline">If we cannot heal, let us not
inflame the wounds which have been inflicted. If the
Begums think themselves aggrieved to such a degree as
to justify them in an appeal to a foreign jurisdiction,—</Q>
speaking of wounds inflicted by his own positive orders—and
talking of a foreign jurisdiction, as if Sir Elijah Impey's
Court at Lucknow had not been a foreign jurisdiction,—<Q REND="inline">let us at least permit them to be the judges of their own
feelings, and prefer their complaints before we offer to
redress them.—</Q>But now came the magnificent paragraph,
to which he requested their Lordships attention:—<Q REND="inline">I hope
I shall not depart from the simplicity of official language,
in saying, the majesty of Justice ought to be approached
with solicitation, not descend to provoke or invite it,
much less to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs,
and the promise of redress, with the denunciation of pu∣nishments,
before trial, and even before accusation.—</Q>
This strutting and pompous apology for not listening to the
voice of real justice and mercy, he was very much surprised
to find had met the approbation of Sir John Macpherson, of
whose good sense and understanding he had heard a good
report, but who, by the minute which he added, proved
that he had not studied and corrected his taste for the sub∣lime
and beautiful from the immortal leader of this prose∣cution.
If he dad done so, he would have felt and treated
this passage as it deserved—as a piece of bombastic jargon,
unworthy of the sober approbation of the understanding.
The Majesty of Justice, in the eyes of Mr. Hastings, was a
being of terrific horror—a dreadful idol placed in the gloom
of graves, accessible only to cringing supplication, and
which must be approached with offerings, and worshipped
by sacrifice. The majesty of Mr. Hastings was a being
whose decrees were written with blood, and whose oracles
were at once obscure and terrible. From such an idol (ex∣claims
<PB N="59" REF="57"/>
Mr. Sheridan) I turn my eyes with horror—I turn
them here to this dignified and high tribunal, where the
Majesty of Justice really sits enthroned.—Here I perceive
the Majesty of Justice in her proper robes of truth and
mercy—chaste and simple—accessible and patient—awful
without severity—inquisitive without meanness.—I see her
enthroned and sitting in judgment on a great and momentous
cause, in which the happiness of millions is involved.—
Pardon me, my Lords, if I presume to say, that in the de∣cision
of this great cause you are to be envied, as well as
venerated. You possess the highest distinction of the human
character; for when you render your ultimate voice on this
cause, illustrating the dignity of the ancestors from whom
you spring—justifying the solemn asseveration which you
make—vindicating the people of whom you are a part—and
manifesting the intelligence of the times in which you live—
you will do such an act of mercy and blessing to man, as no
men but yourselves are able to grant.</P>
<P>My Lords, I have done!</P>
