<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Publick having gi∣ven
a general Approba∣tion
of the late Tryal,
between the Marquis <HI>DE
GESVRES</HI> and his Lady,
as indeed so nice and cu∣rious
a Subject deserv'd: I was inclin'd
to search our own Law-Books and Hi∣storians,
to see what adjudg'd Cases and
Precedents we had of the same Nature.</P>
<P>That which is the most considerable
in our <HI>English</HI> History was, the Case of
the Earl of <HI>ESSEX,</HI> and the Lady <HI>HOW∣ARD</HI>;
a Case that engag'd the Poli∣ticks
of the greatest Statesmen, and
the Casuistry of a Monarch himself.
There has as yet been a great Defect
of Information concerning this Case,
which the Reader will now find supplied
from an Original <HI>Manuscript</HI> of Arch-bishop
<HI>ABBOT</HI>'s, written in his own
<PB REF="3"/>
Hand. This <HI>Manuscript</HI> contains an
exact Account of all the Artifice and
Stratagem used in that Affair, and is
not only very full and particular upon
the Case, but lets us into a considerable
Part of the Secrets and Politicks of
King <HI>JAMES</HI>'s Reign. I must assure the
Publick, that it is faithfully printed
from the Original, which is now in the
Hands of a learned Lawyer.</P>
<P>To make a Collection of this Nature,
as perfect as I well could, there is
added the Lord <HI>AUDLEY</HI>'s Tryal, and
the Proceedings upon the Duke of
<HI>Norfolk</HI>'s <HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Divorce,</HI> which, as
they bear some Relation to this Subject,
so they are now very rare, and va∣luable.
The Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>'s Case,
in particular, employ'd some of our
greatest Lawyers, who have made since
very eminent Figures in their Profes∣sion,
and contains all that can be said
upon the Article of <HI>Divorce.</HI></P>
<P>In short, these Volumes complete
the Account of Cases of this kind,
and I dare promise will prove use∣ful
and entertaining to the Reader.</P>

ACCOUNT
OF
Archbishop ABBOT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>EORGE ABBOT, <HI>D.D.</HI>
was born at <HI>Guilford</HI> in
<HI>Surrey,</HI> and bred at <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI>
where he became
Master of <HI>University
College, An.</HI> 1604. upon
the Translation of Dr. <HI>Bancroft</HI> from
the See of <HI>London</HI> to the Archbishoprick
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> he was made Bishop
of that See; and in the Year 1611. at
the decease of <HI>Bancroft,</HI> succeeded him
in that honourable Post.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1619. He founded a large Hos∣pital
at the Place of his Birth, himself
laying the first Stone, and endow'd it
with a liberal Maintenance.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1621. As he was hunting in
<HI>Burnhill</HI> Park, belonging to my Lord
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>Zouch,</HI> near <HI>Hertford</HI> Bridge, he kill'd
the Keeper by chance with a forked
Arrow out of a Cross-bow, as he was
shooting at a Deer. The Quaere was,
Whether he should incur the Penalty
of Irregularity by this involuntary
Manslaughter, or Suspension? but he
was acquitted from either; yet him∣self
out of a religious Tenderness of
Mind, kept a solemn Anniversary Fast
during his whole Life; and made a
sufficient Provision for the Keeper's
Widow and Children.</P>
<P>He govern'd the Church with great
Prudence, and was in much Esteem
with the People and the moderate
Clergy, but in the Year 1627. many
Discontents arising, he was by the
Clamour of some turbulent Persons,
sequestred from his Office and Juris∣diction,
tho' in a very short Time he
was graciously receiv'd again into Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>He was an eminent Preacher, and
it is universally agreed that Gravity,
Learning, and Piety, adorn'd his Life.
He died at <HI>Lambeth, An.</HI> 1633.</P>

<HEAD>SOME
MEMORIALS
TOUCHING
The Nullity between the Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> and his Lady, pronounc'd <HI>Sept.</HI>
25, 1613, at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and the
Difficulties endur'd in the same.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing at the Court at <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
on the 12th of <HI>May,</HI>
1613, or thereabouts, his
Majesty mov'd me, that I
would be a Commissioner in
a Controversy to be begun
between the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> and his Lady,
for the separating of them; and when his
Majesty had ended those few Words with
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
me, my Lord Chamberlain, who was then
in the Gallery, spake also unto me to that
Purpose. It was unto me a Matter very
strange, having heard before of some Dis∣contentments
between that noble Couple;
but never imagining that Matters were
come to that Head. My Answer was alike
to both, <HI>That I did not know the Ground
whereupon they intended to move; but that if
I were to be a judge in any such Question, I
would pray, that other Bishops, being near the
Town and Court, might be join'd with me.</HI> The
Persons that were nam'd then, were, my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> and my
Lord of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> (for at that Time was
my Lord of <HI>Bath</HI> with the Queen's Maje∣sty
at <HI>Bath.</HI>) Besides, I pray'd both the
King's Majesty, and my Lord Chamberlain,
<HI>That before any such Thing were enter'd into,
I might speak privately with my Lord of</HI> Essex<HI>,
for the satisfying of mine own Mind</HI>; which
by both was permitted unto me. The Day
after, I sent for the Earl, and having pri∣vate
Speech with him, only about the A∣bility
of his Body, and nothing else, I
found him generally much reserv'd in Talk,
but only avowing the Ability of himself
for Generation; and that he was resolv'd
never to lay any Blemish upon himself
that Way. I knew not well what to make
of this; for I did not then understand,
that some Lords had met before at <HI>White-Hall</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
on both Parts, (the Lord Privy-Seal, the
Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of <HI>Southamp∣ton,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Knowles,</HI> as afterwards I
heard) to settle an Order by Consent, how
this Prosecution should be; that is to say,
That a Separation should be made, and my
Lord's Honour every Way preserv'd.</P>
<P>Within a Day or two, coming to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
I had speech with the Lord Cham∣berlain,
in the Gallery going towards St.
<HI>James</HI>'s Park. I might not reveal all Par∣ticulars
of that which pass'd in private;
but yet I told his Lordship, <HI>That I had spo∣ken
with the Earl of</HI> Essex, <HI>and I perceiv'd it
was like to be a Matter of great Difficulty, and
therefore wish'd his Lordship to be well advis'd,
before any thing was brought into Publick.</HI> I
told him, <HI>That he must proceed either upon
Confession or Proof: That it was probable, the
Earl would not confess his own Impotency, for
then he blemish'd himself: That my Lady's
Oath in that Case, was not sufficient; and how
other Proofs might be had, I could not conceive:
That the Earl in open Estimation was to be
thought an able Man: That his Father was not
thought in that Kind unsufficient.</HI> The Lord
Chamberlain reply'd, <HI>That, perhaps, the Fa∣ther's
Sin was punish'd upon the Son: That it
was Truth, that the Earl had no Ink in his
Pen: That himself had confess'd, that he could
not know a Woman, and that, before divers
Noblemen, and some of them his own Friends,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<HI>naming, as I remember, the Earls of</HI> Nor∣thampton
<HI>and</HI> Worcester<HI>, and the Lord</HI>
Knowles. All this while I never dream'd
of <HI>impotentia versus hanc,</HI> but conceiv'd, that
they would charge the Earl simply with
Disability. The Lord Chamberlain then
seem'd unto me fully resolv'd to procceed,
and told me whom he would have in the
Commission, <HI>The Bishops of</HI> London, Ely,
<HI>and</HI> Litchfield, <HI>the two Chancellors of the</HI> Exche∣quer
<HI>and</HI> Dutchy, <HI>my Judges</HI>; (for so he
call'd them) <HI>Sir</HI> Daniel Dun, <HI>Sir</HI> John
Bennet, <HI>Dr.</HI> James, <HI>and Dr.</HI> Edwards. I
told his Lordship, <HI>That I lik'd the Persons
very well.</HI> The next News I heard, was
about a Day or two after, <HI>That the Commis∣sion
was out under the Great Seal</HI>; which I
wonder'd at, by Reason that I thought,
that my Words to the Lord Chamberlain
being well weigh'd, would have mov'd
some longer Consideration. Well: The
Commission is brought; it is accepted, and
Proceeding decreed; the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> is
call'd; the Libel is put in. When we saw
it, and that it contain'd <HI>impotentia versus
hanc,</HI> most of us, who were not acquainted
with the Project before, were much amaz'd
at it. I told the Council for my Lady,
<HI>That they had laid a very narrow Bridge for
themselves to go over:</HI> So said my Lord of
<HI>London,</HI> and divers of the rest; only my
Lord of <HI>Ely</HI> was still silent. My Lord of
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> two several Times, utter'd Spee∣ches,
as much grieving and repining at
this Controversy: <HI>That he was Ordinary to
the Earl of</HI> Essex, <HI>and had been in his House
at</HI> Chartely, <HI>which he saw to be well govern'd;
and the Earl did bear himself most religiously
therein, to his great Comfort: That his Wife
had the Honour to be Cousin Germain to the
Countess of</HI> Suffolk<HI>; and therefore he had no
Reason but to wish well to the Earl of</HI> Essex <HI>and
his Lady both. Yet if he had been worthy to
be consulted withal, he should have thought that
seven Years had been little enough to have deli∣berated,
whether it were fit to bring such a
Business into Question before the World.</HI> Ano∣ther
Time he told us, <HI>That it was very good,
that we should proceed with great Wariness in
this Cause; for,</HI> saith he, <HI>the World looketh on
us what we do; and there were not more Eyes
upon the Earl's Father losing his Head, than
there be upon the Earl now losing his Wife.</HI> He
told me afterwards, <HI>That he had ill Will for
those Speeches, and complain'd that some among
us did tell Tales of all that was said and done.</HI>
(And so it appear'd afterwards, that Sir <HI>J.
Caesar,</HI> and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> did.) Sir <HI>Thomas
Parry,</HI> in all his Speeches, privately mur∣mur'd
against this Nullity, till he came
to <HI>Windsor</HI>; where, the Day that the
King heard us, the Lord Chamberlain,
in my Presence, spake privately with him
and Sir <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> about this Matter;
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
and from that Time forward, Mr. Chan∣cellor
of the <HI>Dutchy</HI> was alter'd. My Lord
of <HI>Ely,</HI> also, for a great while, was in Dis∣like
of the Separation, (as I have credibly
heard he open'd himself to Sir <HI>Henry Savile</HI>)
until such Time as the King spake with
him, and then his Judgment was reform'd.
But Truth it is, that among us he said no∣thing.</P>
<P>Now the Earl's Answer is taken, which
appeareth. In it there were divers Things
very observable. He us'd no ill Speech of
his Lady, for which we all much commen∣ded
him. I gave him so strict a Charge to
speak the Truth, requiring him, as he
would answer me before God at the last
Day, to deliver nothing for Favour or Af∣fection,
but to inform us in the Verity,
that it wrung from him something which I
suppos'd he intended not to speak so plain∣ly.
He gave the Reason of his having no
Motions to know his Lady carnally, and of
his thinking that he never should. <HI>When
I came out of</HI> France <HI>I lov'd her; I do not so
now, neither ever shall I.</HI> When he was to
answer to the Article, that she was <HI>Virgo
incorrupta</HI>; he smil'd, and said, <HI>She saith so,
and she is so for me.</HI> Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> catch'd
these Words, and bid the Register set down
then, <HI>credit articulum esse verum.</HI> These
Things gave me no great Encouragement
to the Business; but yet being at very lit∣tle
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
Leisure, I let Matters go on, and in
mine own Part resolv'd nothing. Then
the Witnesses were depos'd, but not pub∣lish'd.
The Inspectresses were chosen, who
came most unwillingly unto it, and howso∣ever
Sir <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI>
(whom we never suspected to be as Parties
in the Cause, as afterwards they appear'd
to be) made all clear and fair Weather;
yet my Lord of <HI>London</HI> told us openly,
<HI>That he being with them, found that the Ladies
knew not well what to make of it; that they had
no Skill, nor knew not what was the Truth;
but what they said, was upon the Credit of the
Midwives, which were but two, and I knew not
how tamper'd with.</HI> Then came the Lady
<HI>Francis,</HI> to take her Oath, with the seven
Compurgators. I noted therein some
Things. A Paper was brought, containing
<HI>Verbis praecisis,</HI> what her Ladyship would
swear. We saw it, and consider'd it, and
found it too bare and slight to enforce any
thing. The Commissioners advis'd, that
it should be more full. Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> accor∣dingly
drew it; but he must go forth to
the Lady, to know whether she would
swear it. At last it was agreed unto.
When she came to subscribe it, after the
Oath taken, one or two of her Brothers
standing at her Back, put her in Mind,
that she must not write her Name <HI>Francis
Essex,</HI> which she most willingly remem∣ber'd,
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
and subscrib'd <HI>Francis Howard.</HI> We
saw my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI>'s Wife to be one
of the seven. We were afterwards inform'd
very credibly, That the Lady <HI>Knevet</HI> had
declar'd her Sorrow, that she was us'd in
such an Action, and said, <HI>That she wept all
the Day about it.</HI> These Things pleas'd me
little, that Nobody took Comfort in the
Business.</P>
<P>Things go on in a Course 'till <HI>Midsummer-Day.</HI>
Then did the King deal with me
privately, as if he had receiv'd divers
Complaints against me. The first was,
<HI>That we delay'd the Proceeding, in as much as
the Meeting was put off, from the</HI> 18<HI>th of</HI>
June<HI>, 'till the</HI> 2<HI>d or</HI> 3<HI>d of</HI> July. My An∣swer
was, <HI>We had rather gone too fast: We
had sate Forenoon and Afternoon: The Term
now grew to an End, and we had many Busi∣nesses
to dispatch of the King's: That the Com∣mission-Day
for Causes Ecclesiastical was put off
for a Week, by Reason of</HI> Midsummer-Day
<HI>falling on a</HI> Thursday<HI>; and consequently, that
our Proceeding in this Cause, which commonly
attended the other Commission, was of Necessity
to be defer'd.</HI> But my principal Answer
was, <HI>That we could not shorten it; for the
Council on both Parts, bad agreed upon that
Day in</HI> July<HI>, and so it was upon the Acts:
Howsoever, therefore, the Council for my La∣dy
mov'd openly in Court to abreviate the Time,
yet the Council for my Lord would not renounce</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
<HI>nor alter their Term probatory, but kept them
close unto it.</HI> Another Objection was, <HI>That
I acquainted not the King, from Time to Time,
how Matters did go.</HI> I answer'd, <HI>That I
knew not my self; for as yet there was no
Publication of Witnesses. When any thing
came to my Knowledge, his Majesty should un∣derstand
it.</HI> It was added, <HI>That divers Per∣sons
repair'd unto me, who wish'd not well to the
Business. Belike,</HI> said I, <HI>they mean the Earl
of</HI> Southampton<HI>, who came in the other Day,
when we were all sitting together. But his Coming,
was about</HI> John Cotton'<HI>s Cause; and I never
had a Word with him in all my Life, touching
this Business. No,</HI> said the King, and smil'd,
<HI>it is Sir</HI> Henry Nevile. <HI>Indeed,</HI> quoth I,
<HI>he was with me the other Day, and this very
Morning: But your Majesty well knows what
was the Reason. It was touching that Cause,
which your Majesty commanded me to send for
him about. I deliver'd him your Mind the one
Day, and he gave me an Answer the other.</HI>
At this Time, his Majesty cast out some
Words, as if he wish'd well to the Nullity;
but it was so obscurely, that I did not
conceive that earnestly he desir'd it. Af∣ter
this Day, the Complaints were many
which were made to the King against me,
and many Threats were us'd, and divers
Tricks were play'd, to urge me to yield to
the Nullity. One was, <HI>That I should suffer
the Earl of</HI> Essex <HI>to go out of Town.</HI> I an∣swer'd,
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
<HI>He had made his Answer, and had his
Proctor, and it was our Custom then not to stay
Men.</HI> His Majesty commanded me to en∣quire,
if his Presence were not necessary;
and if it were, then I should stay him. I
sent to Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
and to Dr. <HI>Steward</HI>; and they all agreed,
that there was no need of his Lordship's be∣ing
in Town. And of this I sent Word to
the Lord Chamberlain, and my Lord of
<HI>Essex</HI> was permitted to depart. One while
it was given out, that I was mov'd by the
Queen to cross them; when, in Truth, I had
not spoke with her thereabout: Another
while, that I had spoke with the Earl of <HI>Es∣sex</HI>
at first, and hence his Lordship grew less
pliable; when they knew what about it
was, and were told of it before. And it
was not forgotten, that when I gave Charge
to the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> to answer truly to the
Positions in the Libel, I nam'd the Case of
my Lord of <HI>Devonshire</HI> and the Lady <HI>Rich,</HI>
as if I had compar'd this Cause unto theirs.
When afterwards the Earl's Council took
Exception to the Libel, it was given out,
that they were animated by me to oppose;
whereas I never spake with them, nor
knew any thing of their Purpose. And
ever that was one, that there were Delays
us'd. Yea, it was to my Face deliver'd as
a Threat, that Arch-Bishop <HI>Grindall</HI> had
been overthrown for not giving Consent to
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
the Divorce of Dr. <HI>Julio,</HI> as implying, that
the same would be my Case.</P>
<P>About this Time, the Lords, and the
rest of the Feofees, were to meet at Mr. <HI>Sut∣ton</HI>'s
Hospital, about the Settling of it.
The Day that we were to come thither,
my Lord Chamberlain in the Privy-Galle∣ry
at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> shew'd his Anger towards
me, that we had not sent for the Keys to
his Lordship, and that he might deliver
over the Cause. But when I came to the
<HI>Charter-house,</HI> there was deliver'd me a Let∣ter,
written all with my Lord's own Hand,
and directed to the Lord Arch-Bishop, the
Lord Chancellor, and the Lord Privy-Seal;
wherein he did twice take Exception to me
by Name, and, in a Sort, brav'd me, that
so he might pick a Quarrel to me; where∣unto
I reply'd not, but bore it with Pa∣tience.</P>
<P>A little before <HI>Whitsontide,</HI> his Lordship
was very kind to me, and of his own Ac∣cord
proffer'd me a Chamber at <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
which my Lord, my Predecessor, had; but
after twice Proffering of it, and my Ac∣cepting
of the same, his Lordship fell off
strangely, and I never spake of it more.
These Complaints and Threats made me to
suspect all was not well; for what needed
these Things to me, in a Matter of Ju∣stice?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20"/>
The Time now grew on, that his Ma∣jesty
was to go abroad in Progress on a
<HI>Sunday,</HI> which was the Day before the
Council for my Lord, were to put in their
Answers and Exceptions to the Libel.
The Lord Privy Seal shew'd me a Letter
of the King's to his Lordship, wherein he
was to expostulate with me, for delaying
the Business. I gave his Lordship Answer
what was done, and he profess'd that his
Lordship was satisfy'd, and that no Man
could do more than I did. On the <HI>Mon∣day,</HI>
the Council for my Lord, put in their
Answer, which was round and picquant.
The Lord Chamberlain had Notice of it,
and complain'd thereof to the King. I
sent his Majesty the Copy thereof, and
receiv'd from the King a Letter, written
all with his Majesty's own Hand, shew∣ing
Dislike thereof. At that Time, Sir
<HI>William Button</HI> threaten'd Sir <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Ser∣vant
hard for that Answer, as the said
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> divers Weeks after told me.
The Commissioners consider'd of the. An∣swer,
and disallow'd it, giving Order, that
no Record should remain of it, but that
it should be utterly defac'd. This was
very well accepted, and now my Lord of
<HI>Canterbury</HI> was a very honest Man. But
'till this was done, their Followers gave
out, that the King had in two Letters
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
so school'd the Arch-bishop, as he was
never school'd in all his Life.</P>
<P>Things now being quiet, I call'd Sir
<HI>William Button</HI> one Commission-Day unto
me, and spake thus to him: <HI>Sir</HI> William
Button, <HI>you have follow'd this Business from
the first, and have been present at the acting
of all Things. Have you ever seen me, in
Word or Deed, done any Matter that doth
not become me?</HI> (for indeed hitherto I had
no Way declar'd my self, because we were
not come to consider of the Proofs.) <HI>What is
then the Cause that I am thus complain'd upon,
that I cannot one Day be quiet?</HI> His An∣swer
unto me, was, <HI>That the Lord</HI> Cham∣berlain
<HI>was every way a kind Father to his
Children, but in this of his Daughter, he was
so Passionate, 'till it had an End, that he lay
as on a Grid-iron, broiling 'till the Matter
were accomplish'd.</HI> Quoth I, <HI>It shall not be
delay'd by me.</HI> Now, the Council on both
Sides grew on to inform us, wherein I
noted, that whereas the Libel was laid
in Nature of <HI>Maleficium versus hanc,</HI> my
Lady's Council upon the shutting up of
the Cause, would not apply themselves
thereunto, neither would they willingly
hear of it; which seem'd strange, since
all the Books which they brought,
particularly to the Cause, did mention
that; and Doctor <HI>Steward</HI> had publickly
and expressively said, <HI>That it was that</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
<HI>which they did mean.</HI> This troubl'd me
somewhat, because I perceiv'd that they
themselves could not tell what to make
of it. But afterwards fell out another
Matter, which very much alienated my
Judgment from the Cause: It appear'd,
that Sentence could not be given, 'till
the Time that the King entring his Pro∣gress,
was gone as far as <HI>Windsor,</HI> and then
his Majesty was soon to depart to <HI>Far∣nam.</HI>
Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> told us, <HI>That he was
to attend the King in Progress; that he must
be at</HI> Farnam<HI>; that he was Old and Lame;
that it would be too great a Trouble for him,
to come back again at the Day of Sentence.</HI>
He therefore pray'd, <HI>That we would hear
him deliver his Judgment of the whole Matter.</HI>
This Proffer seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d wondrous strange to
most of us, and putting it by handsome∣ly,
we resolv'd not to trouble him there∣with:
And in this Opinion we arose. But
afterwards my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> cometh to
my Study Door, where I and my Lord
of <HI>London</HI> were about another Business,
and telleth us, That my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> and
Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, were
very desirous to hear Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> speak;
and that he, for his Part, was of the Mind
that it would do very well, and therefore
he importun'd us both to give Consent
unto it; we imagining no great harm
could come thereby, assented, and the next
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
Day is appointed for that Purpose. There
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> cometh with a formal Decla∣ration,
divided into six Parts, to every
one of which, he spake so largely, that
with a little replying of ours, it spent
a whole Afternoon. Matters which I most
observ'd therein, were these: He told us,
<HI>That by our Commission, we might hear this
Cause summarily.</HI> He brought a Book, <HI>That
he who hath Power to hear a Matter sum∣marily,
is in Nature of an Arbiter chosen by
both Parties, and therefore may judge in Dis∣cretion,
as he shall think fit;</HI> and more to
that Purpose. I thought with my self,
that this was strange Doctrine in a Mat∣ter
of Marriage; that as Arbitrators, we
might adjudge a Wife to her Husband,
or not adjudge her, according to our Dis∣cretion.
In his discoursing of my Lord's
Impotency, <HI>Versus hanc,</HI> he beat upon the
Matter of <HI>Maleficium,</HI> and yet by no Means
he would have it to be that apparently.
He insisted much, <HI>That the Sentence was to
be given in General Terms, not naming any
particular Impotency.</HI> I told him, <HI>In such
a Sentence, the World look that we should yeild
a Reason of that which we did.</HI> He reply'd,
<HI>That it was fit to give no Reason. And
here,</HI> said Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer,
<HI>a Judge is not to give a Reason of his Sen∣tence,
but only to God. I would give no Rea∣son
to any Prince in the World.</HI> I was once
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
call'd before Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> about a Sen∣tence
which I gave, and she demanded
of me the Reason thereof; I told her,
<HI>A Judge was bound to give no Reason of
that which he pronounc'd, but only to God.</HI>
I marvell'd much at these Things, and
at last reply'd, <HI>Well, let it be, we acquaint
not the World with the Reason of that which
we do, yet is it not fit, that I who am the
Judge, and must pronounce the Sentence, know
the Ground of that which I am to pronounce.</HI>
Here, after a little pausing, one of them
said, <HI>Yes, for you may see that in the Books
and Depositions.</HI> Quoth I, <HI>But I cannot see
that there which may satisfy me. But Mr.
Chancellor said, I, and Sir</HI> Daniel Dun<HI>, Com∣missioners,
you perhaps be not driven to it,
yet I shall be forc'd of Necessity to tell Men
the Reason of the Sentence: For as soon as
this Cause is sentenc'd, every Man who is dis∣contented
with his Wise, and every Woman
discontented with her Husband, which can have
any reasonable Pretence, will repair to me for
such Nullities. If I yeild unto them, here will
be strange Violations of Marriages; if I do
not, I must not tell them, that it was fit for
my Lord of</HI> Essex<HI>, but it is not so for you;
for the Law knoweth no, Persons, but is in∣different
to all. If I then repel them, I must
shew a Reason: Your Case is not like that of
my Lord of</HI> Essex<HI>; for his Case was thus,
yours is thus. And so must I deliver the</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
<HI>Reason, or Men will not be answer'd.</HI> In
this Time of debating, I ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Sir <HI>Daniel
Dun, I pray you Master of the Requests, what
Examples have we of any Nullity in</HI> England<HI>,
pronounc'd in this kind? Might a Man see
any Precedent of it? For I would be loath
to do a thing, that never was done before.
Yes,</HI> saith he, <HI>there be Precedents thereof.
In</HI> Anne <HI>of</HI> Cleve's <HI>Case, we have an Ex∣ample,
and another in one</HI> Berry<HI>, which I
have here in my Book</HI>; and thereupon out
of a Note-Book of his own, he read now
a Line or two, and then two or three
other Lines in another Place, and so
forward. My Answer was, <HI>I did not think
that King</HI> Henry'<HI>s Separation from</HI> Anne
<HI>of</HI> Cleve<HI>, was for any such Matter, but up∣on
a Precontract.</HI> I said, <HI>King</HI> Henry <HI>the</HI>
VIIIth <HI>was a strange Prince in that kind:
He put himself into many Marriages; and when
he began that with</HI> Anne <HI>of</HI> Cleve<HI>, he
fear'd least the Emperor, and King of</HI> France<HI>,
should combine with the Pope against him,
and therefore he was desirous to strengthen
himself with the Protestant Princes in</HI> Ger∣many<HI>;
and for that he thought this Mar∣riage
was much behoveful. But afterwards
growing into Peace, with one or both of those
Princes, he grew soon weary of the Mar∣riage,
because he lik'd not the Woman.</HI> But
then I promis'd to consider further of these
two Cases. This was the End of that
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
Day's Labour, which, when at Night I
had recounted with my self, I thought it
was an audacious Part, for such a one as
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> was, to teach us out of such
poor Grounds, both what to do, and how
to do. I found by my Observation, that
it was a set Match, that thus he should
be heard; that he was prepar'd for the
Purpose: For no Man upon the sudden,
or one Day's warning, could deliver so
much, and so digested. And now I began
to assure my self, that he did not shew
himself a Judge, but was a Stickler for
the Nullity. I much suspected the Con∣science
of the Man, knowing him reaso∣nably
well before, both out of mine own
Estimation of him, and out of the Judg∣ment
of my two Predecessors, the Lords
<HI>Whitgift</HI> and <HI>Bancroft,</HI> who held him for
a Man most corrupt. Yet the next Day
I sent unto him for his Note-Book, and
I caus'd the Record of <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Cleve,</HI> to
be brought unto me. Reading over all the
latter, I found not one Word tending to
the present Case. <HI>Good Lord! thought I,
how doth this Man deceive me!</HI> Perusing
his own Book for that of <HI>Berry,</HI> I found
it to be nothing but the Pleadings of
Advocates on both Sides, when about the
40 of <HI>Eliz.</HI> there was some Question in
the Common Law Courts, about <HI>Berry</HI>'s
Land, <HI>Berry</HI> himself being dead many
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
Years before. But I saw more in this
Book against the Cause now in hand,
than for it; and by some other Writings
in my House, I discover'd that <HI>Berry</HI>'s
Divorce, <HI>Anno</HI> 1561, was for want of
his Stones, which Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> also,
being now of Council for my Lady, and
who formerly stood for <HI>Berry</HI>'s Bro∣ther
against the suppos'd Son, publickly
acknowledg'd. These Things made me
in my Heart much dislike the Cause, and
procur'd in me a hard Opinion, touching
Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> who should not have wrong'd
me, being my Officer, as Dean of the
<HI>Arches.</HI></P>
<P>Within few Days after, the Message
cometh to us, that we were all to attend
the King at <HI>Windsor.</HI> This accordingly
was done. The Morning before the Hear∣ing,
the Lord Chamberlain in my Presence,
spoke first earnestly with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and afterward with the
Chancellor of the Dutchy, who that Day
fell from us, as appear'd by the few Words
that he had before the King. Some few
Days before that, had Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
by Sir <HI>William Button,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI>
been otherwise dealt withal, earnestly
to give Consent to the Nullity; but that
Day we dealt in it more than three Hours.
His Majesty propounding the Matter,
ask'd, <HI>How Things did stand?</HI> Sir <HI>Ju∣lius</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
<HI>Caesar</HI> said, <HI>That Sir</HI> Daniel Dun <HI>was
best able to speak unto it.</HI> And then, <HI>ex
composito,</HI> Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> begins, and tells a great
Tale, and especially insisteth upon <HI>Non
potnit.</HI> When he had done, I answer'd
him, and shew'd the want of Ground for
that Conclusion, out of other the Earl's
evident Answers, <HI>That the</HI> Non potuit <HI>was
for lack of Love, and not for want of Abi∣lity.</HI>
I challeng'd Sir <HI>Daniel,</HI> for abusing
the King with a false Report, and espe∣cially
for his two Precedents of <HI>Berry</HI>'s
Case, and that of <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Cleve.</HI> Amongst
us, was divers ways shew'd the Insuffici∣ency
of the Proofs; that the Libel was
laid short of the Cause, and the Proofs
were short of the Libel: That we had
very many Times call'd upon the Council
for my Lady, that they should look that
they rightly laid their Matter, and made
their Proof strong; that in the End, they
complain'd not of the Judges, when the
Fault was in themselves: (Where my
Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> added, <HI>That himself fear∣ing
the worst, had gone to the</HI> Doctors-Com∣mons,
<HI>and warn'd the Council for my Lady,
that they should look to it.</HI>) Among other
Things there utter'd, Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI> said,
<HI>What a Disgrace will this be to my Lord
Chamberlain and his Daughter, if it should
not now go forward?</HI> My Answer was,
<HI>They should have look'd to that before they</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
<HI>did begin it: We were not the Men that set
the Matter on Foot; if it were a Disgrace,
they put it on themselves. But,</HI> quoth I,
<HI>must I, to save any Man from Disgrace,
send my Soul unto Hell, to give a Sentence
whereof, I saw no Ground? I will never do
it.</HI> My Lord of <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> did carry themselves well
that Day, altho' Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> had much
Opposition from the King himself. When
we saw the King earnest, I fell down on
my Knee, and with Tears in mine Eyes,
I said, <HI>I beseech your Majesty, if ever I
have done you any Service, whom I do serve
with a faithful Heart, or may do you any
Service, rid me of this Business.</HI> I had said
before, <HI>That I was the unfittest Man that
might be, to judge of such a Cause; I was
no marry'd Man, I was no Lawyer, and
I had not had the Time, by reason of my in∣finite
Businesses, to read so much of that Mat∣ter,
as other Men had.</HI> I observ'd that Day,
many Things in his Majesty's Carriage,
of the Matter: He was Earnest, but Gra∣cious
and Moderate. He found Fault with
the Libel, and said, <HI>That Complaints were
made, that we went too slow, but he per∣ceiv'd
we went too fast.</HI> He marvell'd that
my Lord of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Knowles,</HI>
were not examin'd as Witnesses. He con∣stantly
profess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>That he believ'd that my
Lord of</HI> Essex, <HI>was Impotent for a Woman.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
He told us, <HI>That some of the Earl's Friends
had put a Woman to him, and he would not
touch her.</HI> His Majesty said, <HI>That the Earl
was once purpos'd to have gone to</HI> Poland,
<HI>to have try'd whither he might be unwitched.</HI>
To which Things my Reply was, <HI>I would
to God we might see these Things legally
prov'd. That his Majesty much dislik'd that
Course, and therefore he set the Course now in
Prosecution; and therefore if there were any
Error in it, he had done the Lord</HI> Cham∣berlain
<HI>wrong, and he must take it upon him.</HI>
In sum, I found his Majesty much troubled
what to do, as I gather'd, especially by
these Words, If my Lord of <HI>Canterbury,</HI>
and my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> have a Negative
Voice, we must either begin all again,
and have a new Libel, or we must have
a new Commission, and put other Ad∣juncts.
The Conclusion from his Ma∣jesty
was, That we should all meet at
<HI>Lambeth</HI> on the Morrow, and if we could
unanimously consent, then go to the Sen∣tence;
if not, we should put it off unto
another Day, and certify him of it, and
so farther understand his Pleasure. When
the King was risen from his Chair, he
fell to inveighing against these Marry∣ings
of young Couples, before they be
acquainted one with another. He told us
the Inconvenience of it, how he knew in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> a Father who marry'd his only
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
Child to a Man against her Will: That
she withstood it; yet her Father forc'd her
to marry him: That being gone Home
with her Husband after a very few Days, she
came run away from him: That her Fa∣ther
jerk'd her, and sent her home again:
That not long after, she poyson'd her
Husband, and was burnt for it, while the
King was in <HI>Scotland.</HI> After his Majesty's
going out, I follow'd him, and told him,
I evidently perceiv'd, that it was in the
Earl of <HI>Essex Vitium Animi non Corporis.</HI>
His Majesty swore he thought so. There
pass'd some other Speech from the King to
me, touching his own Lying with the
Queen the first Night that he marry'd her.
But, at the last, I kiss'd his Hand and de∣parted.
After I was gone, the Lord Cham∣berlain
speaking somewhat against me, the
King reply'd, <HI>The Arch-bishop hath so adjur'd
me to be rid of this Matter, that I cannot tell
what to say to him.</HI> This did Sir <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>
tell me that Day at Dinner, at <HI>Eaton
College,</HI> letting me know, that the King
found no Fault with me. But afterward,
the King coming to Dinner, after his
Meat had stay'd for him on the Table
more than a Quarter of an Hour, he sate
him down in his Chair, and casting his
Leg over one Side of it, he eat no Meat
for a great Space of Time, neither said he
any Word, but sate musing to himself;
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
which every Man observ'd. And it was
given out by some in the Court, that I
was gone away in the King's Displeasure.
Within some few Days after, it was also
more Ways than one brought credibly to
my Ears, That the Arch-bishop and my Lord
of <HI>London,</HI> should be hereafter kept to
their Spiritualities, and should meddle no
more in temporal Matters: And within a
while it came so far, as that they should
have their Temporalities taken from them.
Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> was at <HI>Windsor</HI> mov'd by
Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> in the Lord <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Name,
and afterwards by the Lord <HI>Fenton</HI> himself,
That he should alter his Opinion, and
make his Peace with the King, for his Ma∣jesty
was not well pleas'd with him.</P>
<P>As I came Homeward from <HI>Windsor</HI> in
my Coach, and all that same Night, two
Things did run much in my Mind; the
one of them was, What a strange and fear∣ful
Thing it was, That his Majesty should
be so far engag'd in that Business: That
he should profess, that himself had set the
Matter in that Course of Judgment: That
the Judges should be dealt withal before,
and, in a Sort, directed what they should
determine: That the like Example had
not been seen: That his Majesty did win
himself much Honour in the Case of <HI>Sut∣ton</HI>'s
Hospital, that, notwithstanding all
Importunity, he had suffer'd the Judges to
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
do their Conscience. This strange moving
to the contrary, did make me marvelously
suspect that it was no direct Matter;
and, as a dutiful Servant to my most gra∣cious
Master, I wish'd in my Heart, that
his Majesty's Hand might be taken off the
Business. The other Point was, That we
had all this while, in our Debatings, never,
or very little, meddled with Points of Di∣vinity.
And I thought with my self, that
much might be said therein, against <HI>malefi∣cium,</HI>
and the Nullity to be pronounc'd
thereupon <HI>versus hanc</HI>; for out of this we
could never get in all our Talking, though
they would never cleave fast to it. I
therefore, having formerly revolv'd some
such Things in my Mind, rose early on
the Day that we were to debate Things at
large, and set down my Mind in writing
out of something in Divinity. The Copy
of this appeareth. The Day after we
came from <HI>Windsor</HI> being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> we met,
and all the Forenoon we insisted on that
which I had briefly written: But to deli∣ver
my Conscience freely before God, I re∣ceiv'd
no kind or shew of Satisfaction. My
Lord of <HI>Ely</HI> sate little less than Dumb, as
if he had never dream'd of any such Mat∣ter.
Divers of the Commissioners wonder'd
at him, that he, who had spent so much
Time in reading of the Canonists touching
this Question, should not think upon Divi∣nity.
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
Briefly up and down by others some∣what
was said, but nothing to Content∣ment.
After Dinner, Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> pro∣pounded
Reasons out of the Law, but
without any Satisfaction. I observ'd two
special Points that Afternoon: The one
was, That we all thought my Lord of <HI>Es∣sex</HI>
his Answer to the Libel, was neither
plain nor sufficient. And now it was re∣member'd,
that my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> had
put to him certain Questions, that four
Things were necessary to Generation; <HI>Mem∣brum
virile,</HI> Erection, Penetration, and <HI>Eja∣culatio
Seminis</HI>; which, altho' they were
then smil'd at, and since that Time much
Sport had been made at the Court and in
<HI>London</HI> about them; yet now our marry'd
Men on all Hands wish'd that punctually
his Lordship might have been held to give
his Answer unto them. This instructed
me, that the Proofs were not full. A se∣cond
Thing was, that when towards the
Evening, I wish'd that a Reconciliation
might be labour'd between my Lord and
my Lady, that it should best become us,
my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> who from the first Beginning
of the Process, had been always very silent,
spake home about that, much disliking
that any such Thing should now be sought;
that it was too late; that it might be the
Cause of poysoning and destroying one of
another, to bring them together again.
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
Well, when we could not agree upon our
Conclusion, we were inforc'd to put all off
unto a longer Day; and as the King com∣manded,
I was to certify his Majesty of it.
I wrote a Letter to the King, praying hum∣bly
that I might be freed from the Trouble
of this Cause, or, at least, give no Sen∣tence
in it, 'till I were a marry'd Man,
and so might better understand the Busi∣ness.
I inclos'd also six Reasons of Sir
<HI>John Bennet</HI>'s taking Exceptions in Law
against the Nullity. And withal I joyn'd
mine own Reasons in Divinity, of which
I said in my Letter, that I knew not where
to seek an Answer to them; meaning,
that the Commissioners had given me none.
These Reasons afterwards cost me a great
deal of Trouble.</P>
<P>The next Progress in this Controversy,
was, that I was advertis'd, that it was his
Majesty's Pleasure that the Cause should be
put off until the 18th of <HI>September</HI>; and
withal there was brought a new Commis∣sion
of Adjuncts, whereinto my Lords of
<HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Rochester</HI> were put. The
Day that I perceiv'd this, acquainting
the two Chancellors of the Exchequer and
Dutchy therewith, in the Gallery at
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> I told them, <HI>That I hoped now, that
for my Part, I should be freed from any Trouble
therein farther, for I did desire to be rid of it.</HI>
They both answer'd me, <HI>That they desir'd in</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
<HI>like sort to be quit of the Matter.</HI> A good
Business, thought I, that no Body taketh
Comfort of it, unless it be Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI>
of whom I forgot before to note, that on
the Day of meeting, next after our coming
from <HI>Windsor,</HI> he, with a great deal of In∣solency,
challeng'd me for my Speech be∣fore
his Majesty, the Day before. <HI>Do not
abuse the King, Sir</HI> Daniel Dun. I remem∣ber'd
it was in mine own House, and if I
had rattl'd him according to his Deserts,
my Lord Chamberlain would have said it
had been done for his Sake; and in the Pro∣gress,
Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> having the King's Ear,
would have made Things worse than they
were; and I therefore forbore him with such
Patience, that some of the Commissioners
told me afterwards, that they wonder'd
how I could endure those Behaviours, at
the Hands of a Man of his Quality: But
yet they commended me for it. Now grew
I to consider what were the Reasons why
these two Commissioners were joined to us;
and therein I had many Advertisements
from divers Friends, divers Ways. We re∣solv'd
for my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI>; that it was
suppos'd, that there was no great Amity
between him and me; that when I was
Dean there, there was some Disagreement
between us, which they suppos'd yet con∣tinu'd:
That he had an old Grudge to me,
for having the Archbishoprick, which his
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
Lordship so much desir'd. Besides, it was
some Tickling unto him, that his Gravity
and Learning should either win in the
Arch-bishop, or lay some Blemish upon
him, if he stood out. Certain it is, that
Sir <HI>William Button</HI> was with him; and,
doubtless, would tell him how acceptable
this Service would be to his Majesty. I
heard of good Credit and secretly, That he
was put in hope to be made a Privy-Coun∣sellor;
and the Fame was general, That
for the Father's Labour, the Son should be
made a Knight. It seemeth at the first,
that he had no great Fancy unto it; but
being wrought upon, he consented; so that
he might be required by his Majesty to be
present. This was done by a Letter from
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> which, at his being at <HI>Lambeth,</HI>
he shew'd me; that I should take Notice,
that he had not come, unless he had been
commanded. I leave him for the Time,
only signifying, that in the Vacation, he
sent for divers Books from <HI>London,</HI> and had
Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> much with him, to inform him
in all Particulars. Yet I may not forget,
that while he held off his Consent, some
hard Opinions were rais'd of him at Court;
as I found by a Letter from my Lord of
<HI>Litchfield</HI> to me. For there he was found
Fault with, that he attended not the King
at <HI>Farnham,</HI> or at <HI>Andover.</HI> And there
Blame was laid, that Mr. <HI>Love,</HI> who was
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
so great with my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> was like
to get the Warden's Place at <HI>Winchester,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Harmar</HI> being reported to be dead. Con∣cerning
the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> it was well
known that he had open'd himself before
the King's going in Progress, that he lik'd
well of the Nullity. Coming once or twice
while we were about it, he, with some in
my House disputed earnestly for it. He
was a great Dependant of my Lord of
<HI>Litchfield.</HI> This was a Way to make him
well esteem'd, and to arise high in Prefer∣ment.
But, in Truth, he should not have
verify'd the Report which Arch-bishop
<HI>Bancroft</HI> on his Death-Bed gave of him,
together with <HI>Butler</HI> and <HI>Carrier,</HI> to the
King by a Message, unless he did some
such Thing. When he was put into the
Commission, he in divers Places seem'd to
be much offended, that he was made one.
His Grief was, that he was set in Opposi∣tion
against me: He would never give his
Voice to it, unless I consented. These, and
the like Things, he spake, as elsewhere, so
to some of my Servants in my House at
<HI>Croydon</HI>: For, under another Colour, he
came three Times in the Vacation to me;
but I never spake a Word with him about
that Matter, as knowing it would be an
Argument against me, that I labour'd to
draw away the King's Commissioners; and
the End shew'd, that I had no great Rea∣son
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
to trust him. Besides these two Ad∣juncts,
the new Commission it self seem'd
very strange unto me. There were eight
made of the <HI>Quorum</HI>; and it was so laid,
that if three of them, with two other, con∣sented,
the Sentence might be given; so
that, by the Words thereof, if seven had
deny'd, five might have pronounc'd and
prevail'd. A Matter so uncooth, that, as
I credibly heard, my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> him∣self
found much Fault therewith. Again,
there was a Clause, <HI>Legibus, Statutis, Ordi∣nationibus,
Constitutionibus quibuscunque non
obstantibus</HI>; so resolv'd they were to have it
dispatch'd. Every thing now stood at a
Pause; and my Lord of <HI>Ely</HI> (who, at first,
deliver'd his Judgment against it to Sir
<HI>Henry Savile,</HI> as I heard it avow'd upon
good Credit; but afterwards said, he was
better instructed by the King) began to
hearken what Men said of the Matter, as
appeared by Speech which he had with Sir
<HI>John Paiton</HI>; to whom, notwithstanding,
he told some Things of the Insufficiency
of my Lord of <HI>Essex.</HI> The Weather grew
fair; he hop'd the overflowing of the Isle
of <HI>Ely</HI> would cease; he would go down
in his Visitation; he came and took his
leave of me, but not one Word of the
Nullity.</P>
<P>Now was his Majesty abroad, and I had
more Leisure to consider of this Question.
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
I read what I could; I confer'd with many
Men about divers Circumstances, so to in∣form
my self the better. I pray'd fre∣quently
to God to direct me aright. I of∣ten
perus'd the Depositions, but I found
little Satisfaction. I perceiv'd most of the
Lords had a great Dislike of this Proceed∣ing;
that the better Sort of Men had
generally a Detestation of it; that the
Judges and Lawyers much condemned it.
I heard many strange Stories of the Lady's
Carriage. Something was freely spoken
of a Woman arraign'd at <HI>Bury</HI>; and how
to shut that up, and so to free the Earl,
this Course was consented upon.</P>
<P>These Things, though out of Charity I
entertain'd not as absolutely true, yet the
Concurrence of them from so many, made
me that I could not contemn them. Be∣sides,
now grew the Rumour strong, that a
new Husband was readily provided for
her: Whereof I call'd to Mind the Opi∣nion
of Sir <HI>Henry Nevile,</HI> deliver'd to me
at <HI>Windsor</HI>; and I did not forget a Speech
of <HI>Overbury</HI>'s, once to me in that Kind. I
understood, that at <HI>Christmas</HI> last, there
was a Reconciliation wrought between
the Earl and his Lady, howsoever it fell
out. Yea, that when the Lords met at
<HI>White-Hall</HI> about the Manner of Separation,
there was three Times that Day a Likeli∣hood
to make them Friends; which we
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
thought imply'd no Disability of my Lord
of <HI>Essex,</HI> even in their own Opinion. I
farther understood, that whereas it was
whisper'd among us, the Commissioners,
That at <HI>Christmas</HI> last, my Lord of <HI>Essex</HI>
being in Bed with his Lady, should labour
a quarter of an Hour carnally to know her,
and in the End should say, Frankey, <HI>it will
not be,</HI> and so kiss'd her, and bid her good
Night: That this was not true; but that
the Earl, the Night before his going from
<HI>London,</HI> at the End of <HI>Trinity</HI> Term, said
with Tears in his Eyes, <HI>That when he went to
Bed to her at</HI> Christmas <HI>last, he had forgiven
all Things as clearly as he wish'd that God
should forgive him his Sins; but when they
were alone, she revil'd him, and miscall'd him,
terming him Cow, and Coward, and Beast:</HI>
And he added, <HI>that she was as bitter a Woman
as any was in the World: Which Things so
cool'd his Courage, that he was far from know∣ing,
or endeavouring to know her.</HI> These
Matters, together with the small Joy
which the Commissioners had to deal in
the Business, made me have no great Fan∣cy
unto it. On the other Side, I heard
that my Lord Chamberlain, or his Fol∣lowers,
gave out, that what was done,
was perform'd by the King's Direction,
otherwise it had not been begun; and
therefore, they expected that his Majesty
should see it effected; that they rested
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
themselves on him. I was much griev'd
that they had this Advantage on my Ma∣ster,
who being so engag'd, as I thought,
could not well go backward or forward:
And, to increase my Sorrow, I was private∣ly
advertis'd from Court, that his Majesty
did mean himself to give an Answer to my
Reasons above-mention'd. I heard ano∣ther
Way, that his Majesty in the Progress
wrote much with his own Hands. From
another Friend I was told, That the King
with his Answer to the Reasons, had writ∣ten
to me a sharp Letter. Yea, by ano∣ther
I learn'd the Contents of the Letter,
which was full of Sharpness.</P>
<P>These Things in the Summer kept me
full of Expectation of some great Discon∣tentment.
Yet my heart still assur'd me,
that I was guilty of no Wickedness. I
found all Persons with whom I spake of
my Mind, for the Dislike of the Nullity.
In many Businesses to and from the King
by Letters, I found nothing but well.
His Majesty sent me Warrants for three
Bucks, as formerly he had done, and with
some Kindness joyn'd.</P>
<P>Thus I was tossed in my Thoughts; and
in all my Troubles, I had Recourse to God
in Prayer.</P>
<P>By this Time, the 18th of <HI>September,</HI> draw∣eth
nigh, and I am inform'd, That my
Lord of <HI>Winchester,</HI> the <HI>Tuesday</HI> before, was
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
come to Town; and that besides my La∣dy's
Council, Sir <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and Sir <HI>Da∣niel
Dun,</HI> did, at St. <HI>Mary Overy</HI>'s House,
daily attend his Lordship. I expected no
great Good of this; only from the King I
heard nothing but well. For some few Days
before, his Majesty had been at <HI>White-hall,</HI>
where I kiss'd his Hand, and he did not
only look merrily upon me, but he gave me
Promise of the Bishoprick of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> for my
Brother, as I understood it. Some other
Matters also pass'd quietly in Speech, and I
found no Disturbance. But on the 17th of
<HI>Septemb.</HI> the Day before our new meeting at
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> being sent
from the King, bringeth divers Papers un∣to
me, seal'd up. I open'd them, and found
there my Reasons first, secondly, an Answer
to them, and, thirdly, a Letter, all writ∣ten
with the King's Hand unto me. I
read them all presently, without any
abatement, whereunto I was help'd by my
Fore-knowledge, that such Things would
come. I said little unto it, only I ask'd
my Lord of <HI>Litchfield, Whether he knew what
those Papers contain'd?</HI> He told me, <HI>That
the King had read unto him the Answers to the
Reasons, and had given him the Letter to Seal
up in a Paper; but in Reverence to his Ma∣jesty,
he held it not his Duty to look into it.</HI>
Growing afterward in some Speech of our
next Days Business, I told him plainly,
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
<HI>That having spent much Time in this Vaca∣tion,
in perusing the Books, I could not find
any where, but especially in the Answer of my
Lord of</HI> Essex<HI>, that which would give me Con∣tentment.</HI>
I read the Places, and my Lord
confess'd with me, <HI>That there was not enough.</HI>
He told me also, <HI>That unless I gave my Con∣sent
to the Separation, that he would never
give his:</HI> So much Reverence in him did I
find both then, and divers Times before,
against this Divorcement. At last he men∣tion'd
one Thing which pleas'd me won∣drous
well, and that was, That we should
call for my Lord of <HI>Essex</HI> again, and new
examine him, upon some Points to be far∣ther
declar'd, <HI>ad informandum animum Ju∣dicis.</HI>
For hence, either we should know
so much as might perswade us to decree a
Separation, or the World might be satisfy'd
that we had no Reason for it. These
Things thus settled, his Lordship separa∣teth.
Then I withdrew my self to my
Study, and read over again and again, the
Papers from the King. I found them very
sharp, and perceiv'd by the Time that they
arriv'd unto me, that they were detain'd
'till that Day, that I might be overwhelm'd
with them on the sudden, and have no
Time to deliberate, before we were to come
the second Time to sit in Judgment. These
things did much trouble me, so that I
did sleep but a little that Night. I revol∣ved
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
many things, and much tumbling I
had in my Miud. It griev'd me infinite∣ly,
that the King should make himself a
Party therein; That some Unthankful∣ness,
and other Matters, were little less
then Reproaches unto me: Methought my
faithful Heart to my Master, deserv'd no
such Sharpness. I devis'd how I might
give the King Contentment, and it was
some Comfort to me, that we had thought
upon a Course of new examining my Lord
of <HI>Essex.</HI> But as things stood, I could not
force my Conscience, which cry'd upon me,
<HI>That it was an odious Thing to GOD and
Men, to give such a Sentence, without better
warrant.</HI> I here cast what might befal
to the Church in my Disgrace; how <HI>Pa∣pists</HI>
would scorn at it; how it might be
my own Ruin, and that divers ways; a
Hazard to my Friends, and to the Com∣missioners
which were of my Mind; how
my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> had a Wife and Chil∣dren,
which might all be overthrown at
one Blow. But after Midnight sleeping,
towards the Morning I consider'd on the
other Side, That my Conscience was more
unto me than all the World; that it was
a fearful thing, in Place of Judgment, to
give a Sentence against mine own Heart;
That <HI>Olivarius,</HI> the Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI>
upon such an Occasion, grew Mad, and
dy'd in it: That the Manner of our Sen∣tence,
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
must be <HI>Solum Deum prae Oculis ba∣bentes,
a rei veritate inspecta</HI>; all which,
and the like Meditations, did much pre∣ponderate
with me. Then I slept again,
and now rising, I found my Heart much
settled, to persist in that which I held to
be Truth. I pour'd out earnestly my Pray∣ers
to God, and was now strongly resolv'd,
to leave all to God, remembring, That
he had preserv'd me from my Mother's
Womb; that he had from Time to Time,
rid me out of all my Troubles; that his
Power was the same still; that he would
never forsake me, if I turn'd not from
him. I forgot not, <HI>That the Hearts of Kings
were in the Hand of the Lord</HI>; that I had
Experience of the Graciousness, both of
GOD and the King, the Year before;
when standing earnestly in a good Cause,
that Prince <HI>Henry</HI> should not marry a
<HI>Papist,</HI> I receiv'd some sharp Words from
the King for my Labour; but the next
Day his Majesty us'd me very kindly
again. To this I added, That Poverty,
Imprisonment, Death it self, were things
contemptible to a resolv'd Mind: That
some of my Predecessors, as Arch-Bishop
<HI>Cranmer,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Grindal,</HI> had given
good Examples of these Sufferings, and
they were recorded in the Catalogue of
the Righteous. These Thoughts thus re∣volv'd,
I read again the Letter from the
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
King, and drawing out into a Paper, all
the sharp Words, I consider'd them again
and again, and methought they were
not altogether so bitter as I apprehended
them; that they were wrung from his Ma∣jesty
by my Lord Chamberlain's Impor∣tunity;
that my Master had deserv'd at
my Hands, that I should bear patiently
twenty times more; and that all was no∣thing,
so the Clearness of my Conscience
might be preserv'd. With these Resoluti∣ons
on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> I came to <HI>Lambeth,</HI>
where I met with the News of <HI>Overbury</HI>'s
Death, and the sound of some fearful Ap∣prehensions
thereupon, bruted about the
City. I made Trial of my Lord of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>'s
Constancy, telling him, <HI>aut cidendum,
aut cadendum.</HI> I found him most resolv'd,
avowing unto me, <HI>That if he should pronounce
for the Dissolution of the Marriage, he thought
the Devil would that Night fetch away his
Soul.</HI> Yea, he was earnest on me, to per∣sist
where I began, telling me, <HI>That the
Eyes of the whole Church of</HI> England <HI>were
upon me, and expected of me, that I should
shew my self a worthy Man.</HI> At last we
came to sit, where my Lords of <HI>Winchester</HI>
and <HI>Worcester,</HI> took their Places. The Com∣mission
was read, the Fact, and Manner of
the Process was open'd, and nothing notable
done, saving that my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> pro∣posing,
that it was fit that my Lord of
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
<HI>Essex</HI> should be call'd to explain himself
farther, for the fishing out of the Truth, all
the Commissioners most willing assented
thereunto, (yea, my Lords of <HI>Winchester</HI>
and <HI>Worcester</HI> expressly,) saving Sir <HI>Ju∣lius
Caesar,</HI> who softly declar'd his Dislike
thereof, in my hearing. When the Court
was risen, I spake with my Lord of <HI>Litch∣field,</HI>
and not thinking fit to return any
thing to the King in Writing, I pray'd
him to acquaint his Majesty how Things
stood; and to tell him, that upon this
Course of new calling my Lord of <HI>Essex,</HI>
I hop'd in the End, we should give his
Majesty Satisfaction. The <HI>Sunday</HI> I spent at
<HI>Croydon,</HI> and preach'd on that Text of
Christ's raising the Widow's Son of <HI>Naim,</HI>
to the great Comfort of mine own Heart.
That Day I conferr'd with a Friend, and
settled some Courses, if any Trouble should
befal unto me. I was also by a good Friend
inform'd, that my Lord of <HI>Essex,</HI> on that
<HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, having five or six Cap∣tains,
and Gentlemen of Worth in his Cham∣ber,
and Speech being made of his Inabili∣ty,
rose out of his Bed, and taking up his
Shirt, did shew to them all, so able, and
extraordinarily sufficient Matter, that they
all cry'd out Shame of his Lady, and said,
That if the Ladies of the Court knew as
much as they knew, they would tread her
to Death.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49"/>
On the <HI>Monday</HI> we met at <HI>Lambeth</HI> a∣gain,
and Information was given on the
Part of my Lady. These things pass'd
quietly. When the Court was risen, my
Lord of <HI>Litchfield</HI> told me, That he had
made his Majesty acquainted with our Pro∣position
on <HI>Saturday,</HI> but that his Majesty
was strongly against it, my Lord of <HI>Essex</HI>
should any more be call'd, and that by no
means he would endure it; for that per∣adventure,
the said Earl, either being pro∣vok'd
by the late Challenge between him
and Mr. <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> or otherwise insti∣gated
by the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> might
speak somewhat which might marr the
Business. This made me still suspect, that
all was not right, and I reply'd to my
Lord, <HI>If that be deny'd us, and we have no
farther Proof, I shall never give Sentence for
the Nullity: As good declare my Mind at first,
as at last, and I pray you so acquaint his Ma∣jesty.</HI>
When I went Homeward, I much
revolv'd this in my Heart, thinking, Good
Lord! What a Case is this? Shall any
Truth be kept from us? Are they afraid
to have all out? Do they only look to
attain their own Ends, and care not how
our Consciences be intangled and ensnar'd?
On the <HI>Wednesday</HI> we met again, and now
Dr. <HI>James</HI> is come to us, and by and by
cometh in my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> who, as it
seem'd, had meant to have kept him away,
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
but the King sent an express Messenger
for him, requiring him by a Letter, to be
there on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night. Now are we
<HI>plena Curia.</HI> Before we sate down, Sir
<HI>Thomas Lake</HI> delivereth a Message unto me
from the King, That his Majesty desir'd
a speedy End of this Business; that it had
hung long, and the World was in expecta∣tion
of it; that the Term grew on, which
would be full of Businesses: That his Ma∣jesty
on <HI>Monday,</HI> was to go to <HI>Windsor,</HI>
to meet the Queen, and my Lord <HI>Chamber∣lain</HI>
with him; that therefore he would have
us to fall close to our Work, not to trouble
our selves on the Morrow, to come see
the King, who would come late to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
because some Ceremonies were to be
perform'd, as upon the last Day of Hunt∣ing;
that we should not attend his Ma∣jesty
'till <HI>Friday,</HI> but that the Sentence must
be given on <HI>Saturday.</HI> My Answer was
publickly, <HI>That there should be no Stay in me,
and that therefore on the Morrow, we would
sit Forenoon and Afternoon, if the Commis∣sioners
so pleas'd; and if they thought good,
Is would not refuse to sit until Midnight.</HI>
But in mine own Heart I perceiv'd, that all
the Care was, that the Matter might be
dispatch'd before the Queen spake with the
King, whom they suppos'd not to wish
well to the Business. We go to our Court,
and Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> stay'd to hear the
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
Information on my Lord's Part. It was
strange, to see how my Lord of <HI>Winchester</HI>
carry'd himself that Day, partly to play
his Prizes before Sir <HI>Thomas Lake,</HI> who
might make Report of it to his Fame,
and partly to shew his Ludi-magisterial
Disposition. He snapp'd up my Lord's
Council, that they could not speak a
Word, but he catch'd it before it was out.
I know what you will say, when indeed
he knew not, neither was it any such
Matter as he imagin'd. God Almighty
will tell you a Tale for that; <HI>I tell you,
Doctor</HI> Bennet<HI>, I have as much Law as you,
I am as good a Lawyer as you are.</HI> He fell
divers Times on my Lord of <HI>London</HI> Per∣sonally,
and would needs know of him
openly, <HI>How many times in a Year, a Man was
bound Carnally to know his Wife.</HI> In a Word,
with Scoffs, and imperious Behaviour, he
play'd the Advocate all that Day, to the
great Offence of the Standers by, so that
it was publickly spoke of in <HI>London,</HI> which,
I think, came to his Ears; so that ever
afterward, he carry'd himself more tracta∣ble.
I was forc'd to bear it, because of
avoiding new Complaints.</P>
<P>The Point most observable that Day,
was, that both my Lord of <HI>Winchester,</HI>
and my Lord of <HI>Ely,</HI> did deny Maleficiati∣on,
so that by no Means they would
have this Question to proceed in that Na∣ture,
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
which I openly did thank them for,
and bound it upon, before all the Commis∣sioners
and Standers by, telling them, <HI>That
the same was my Opinion.</HI> But I ask'd my
Lord of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who sate by me, <HI>What
be then held it to be.</HI> He told me private∣ly,
<HI>That he held it to be a Natural Impotency,
which was before the Marriage.</HI> I ask'd him,
<HI>What that might be, and whence he gather'd it.</HI>
He answer'd, <HI>I have heard divers Particu∣lars,
which are enough to perswade me if they
be True. Yea,</HI> my Lord said I, <HI>if they be
True, I have heard as many to the contrary.
I wish that we might examine, whether they
be True or no; that were fair Proceeding.
It is my Grief, that it is not permitted unto
us, to try whether all these Matters be so or
not. This might satisfy a Man's Conscience.</HI>
So we parted that Night.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Thursday,</HI> at Ten of the Clock,
we met in <HI>Lambeth-Hall,</HI> where my Lady's
Council took on them, to answer some
Scruples objected by Dr. <HI>Ferrand.</HI> But Dr.
<HI>Martin,</HI> when no Body spake of it, fell
to wipe away that Objection, that my
Lord had not sworn, <HI>Cum Septima mann.</HI>
Upon his Speech, the Commissioners took
hold of it, and it then being urg'd strong∣ly,
my Lady's Council stood at first, as if
they had been blasted with Lightning.
Afterward they grew extream angry with
Dr. <HI>Martin,</HI> that he had propos'd it, but
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
the Issue was, there could no Answer be
given unto it; but in the Sight of all
the Standers by, this was broke off with
Shame and Confusion of Faces. We din'd
not that Day, but about one or two of the
Clock, we withdrew our selves privately
into the Parlour. I had thought there to
have had Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and the rest who
lik'd not of the Nullity, to propound their
Doubts, and so in Order; and last of all,
I would have spoken. But there I found
a contrary Course resolv'd, which my Lord
of <HI>Winchester</HI> seem'd much to dislike. But
my Lord of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> Sir <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> had set the Clock, and they
must have their Will. The six Reasons are
produc'd, which Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> had deli∣ver'd
the Day after we came from <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI>
and the Copy whereof, was by me sent
to the King. All these must in their Or∣der
be debated. One was about the unper∣fectness
of the Libel, in which we all re∣ceiv'd
Satisfaction, that the Libel was well
to so much purpose as now they declar'd
they would have it. The other five, my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> maintain'd: I allow'd of
three of them absolutely▪ and the other
two, that was Inspection of my Lord's Bo∣dy,
and a Time to be assign'd by the
Judge, to try whether they might Carnal∣ly
know one another, I held to be fit,
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
when those Reasons were propos'd; but
now such Flames and Quarrels were arisen,
I thought not amiss now to be forborn
My Lord of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> with a Pen, did
note what every Man resolv'd, but prin∣cipally
my Words, with a Purpose to
shew them to the King, as I conceiv'd,
and afterwards I found it to be so. I was
desirous therefore, that his Majesty might
see I was not Obstinate, but settled to yield
to Reason. And again, I suppos'd, that
this Candor of mine, would make some
of them yield to us, where they saw there
was unevitable Truth. But I found it far
otherwise, for our Afternoon's Work was,
that they gave shuffling and shifting An∣swers
to the Objections, such as themselves
had study'd all the Vacation; but no Care
was, whither they were True and Satisfacto∣ry,
or not. And to what Sir <HI>Daniel</HI> pro∣pos'd,
all Seven of them consented, without
sticking or scruple, so that I might ima∣gine
it was a set Play. Upon the first
Scruple debating, Sir <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> finding
the Difference of Opinions, and that our
Lawyers stuck strongly unto it, <HI>Let us,</HI>
saith he, <HI>put it to the Question, and let the
major Part of Voices determine it.</HI> When
I saw this to be the Proceeding, the Lord,
thought I, deliver me from such Judges.
But yet observing their Manner, I pos∣sess'd
my Soul in Patience. When it grew
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
to be dark, that the King might understand,
that I was willing to allow time to all that
might be said, I remember'd Sir <HI>John Ben∣net</HI>
to read the Sentence of the <HI>Rota Romana,</HI>
where, in the Popes own Consistory, about
the Year 1585, a Judgment was revers'd,
which an Arch-bishop in <HI>Spain,</HI> had given
for a Nullity, in a Case being ours alto∣gether,
because, after the triennial Coha∣bitation,
he had not assign'd a Time for
the marry'd Couple to make Trial again,
and to use Fasting and Prayer. This Re∣peal
was read at large, and so was another
of the <HI>Rota,</HI> in the same Kind. But both
these were slighted, as Matters of Nothing,
and so I think had St. <HI>Paul</HI> been, if he
had been there. I urg'd that of <HI>Alexan∣der</HI>
III, That even in <HI>France</HI> it self, no
Nullity had been allow'd; but that it was
<HI>Consuetudo generalis Ecclesiae Gallicanae</HI>; and
that <HI>Ecclesia Romana,</HI> did know or practice
no such thing. This was slighted like the
former, and I perceiv'd it was but in vain to
speak to them, for they were resolv'd, and
be it Good, or be it Bad, the Matter should
be done.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Friday</HI> Morning I went to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
and looking somewhat heavily, the
King cometh to me, and to my Lord Chan∣cellor,
and offereth us both his Hand to
kiss. He might perceive by my Counte∣nance
that I was not a little troubl'd, and
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
that was perceiv'd by divers of the Lords,
who privately let me know their Minds,
that we had a foul and strange Matter
in Hand at <HI>Lambeth.</HI> At last, the King
takes me aside, and after propounding
three or four Businesses, walking, he took
me to the Window, and ask'd me, <HI>How
that great Cause did go forward?</HI> I told
his Majesty, <HI>That I had no Liking of it;
that I had receiv'd a Letter and Writing from
him which very much troubled me, for I knew
my self to be his dutiful Servant, and had not
deserv'd Ill of him; that it was nothing to me
whether she remain'd Wife to the Earl of</HI> Essex<HI>,
or were marry'd to another Man; but that I
might not give Sentence where I saw no Proof;
that I had liv'd fifty one Years, almost, and had
my Conscience uncorrupted in Judgment; that
I knew not how soon I was to be call'd before
God, and I was loath, against that Time, to
give a Wound to mine own Soul; that all my
Grief was, that his Majesty's Hand was in it;
that for other Men I car'd not; that I chose
rather to die an honest Man than a wise Man;
that he must never afterward expect true Service
of me, for, how could I be true to him, who
was false unto God; that if he mark'd it
well, this was no Time to disgrace his good
Servants:</HI> I told him, <HI>That if his Majesty
pleas'd to let the Matter alone, as he did all
other Causes, I would make good my Part against
all</HI> England<HI>, on the Peril of my Head.</HI> The
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
King answer'd, <HI>That I would have no Law∣yers.</HI>
I reply'd, <HI>Yes, enough, There is not
an honest Lawyer in</HI> England <HI>that would not
be on my Side.</HI> His Majesty ask'd me, <HI>Whe∣ther
the rest of the Commissioners, Yesterday, did
not perswade me.</HI> I told him, <HI>No; but their
Dealing, rather drove me the contrary Way.
For,</HI> (said I) <HI>I came thither ingeniously to
yield to any Truth that should be shew'd me; but
they, on the contrary Part, in a factious Course
went wholly together, and what one said, ano∣ther
said, be it Well, or be it Ill, without any
Scruple.</HI> To my Speech, <HI>That it was an
Example that never had been in</HI> England;
the King said, <HI>Yes,</HI> Berry'<HI>s Case.</HI> I beseech'd
his Majesty, <HI>That he would not believe that
Cause to be any such Matter; for if he would
pardon me, it should not be long before that I
would shew, that his Separation was for Lack
of his Stones.</HI> In this debating, the King
was very desirous to know, what should be
the Reasons whereupon I stood, that I
might have Satisfaction. My Answer was,
<HI>That when I was in Place of Judgment, I would
not conceal the Reasons of my Sentence, but it
was to no Purpose to speak them now; it would
but put his Majesty to a new Trouble to hear
them, and then some Man must answer them,
who look'd to his own End, and to make a plau∣sible
Answer, which would not content me,
without ground of Truth.</HI> A great Part of
the Time, that I had this Speech with the
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
King, my Eyes were full of Tears, which
I saw, much mov'd my gracious Master,
and especially, my earnest Desire, <HI>That I
might do my Conscience.</HI> I perceiv'd the King
was much overcome, by this my honest
Dealing: And then, whilst his Majesty
went to speak with my Lord Privy-Seal,
and my Lord Chamberlain, who stood all
this while at the farther End of the Gal∣lery;
and to whom, I conceiv'd, the King
told much of that which I had spoken; I
went my ways to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to Dinner.
Now grew I confident to do my Conscience
right, whatsoever came of it. That Day
I din'd privately, but yet, my Lord Bi∣shop
of <HI>Bath</HI> was with me, whom, when I
had acquainted with so much of the Cause,
as I thought fit, I receiv'd no Discourag∣ment
from him. My Heart was much
eas'd, and now I thought I should no more
be troubled. Yet, between three and four
a Clock, after Dinner, my Lord of <HI>Litch∣field</HI>
cometh to me from the King, and
bringeth a written Treatise upon the pre∣sent
Argument, which was the Work of a
<HI>Scotchman,</HI> I know not who. I receiv'd it,
and promis'd that Night to read it; as in∣deed
I did, riding in my Coach to <HI>Croydon</HI>;
for thither I thought fit to withdraw my
self, though it were late, for avoiding of
more Perturbation. This Treatise no way
pleas'd me, but I thought it the Work of
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
some hungry Fellow, who lack'd twenty
Shillings to buy Food to his Belly. Here,
finding it the Day of the End of my Quar∣ter,
I settled much of my domestick Busi∣ness.
I forgot not to commend my self,
and the whole Cause, to God by Prayer.
I meditated many Things in my Bed: In
the Morning I rose early, and before Day,
in my Study, I set down some Heads, what
I would speak unto. Then went I early
to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and there supply'd my brief
Notes, digesting my Matter of Sentence
into Order; being resolv'd to speak large,
and home to the Cause, without Touch of
any Person more than I must needs. By
this Time, most of the Commissioners were
come. I sent for my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> Sir
<HI>John Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI>
singly and severally, into my Study: I
requir'd them, before God, not to speak
any thing for respect to me, but to do that,
which in their Learning and Conscience
they thought to be just, and to speak that
<HI>intrepid,</HI> without Blemish to any Man,
but soundly to the Matter. I found them
all avowing, that in their Souls, they found
no Warrant for the Nullity. I then
wish'd severally, Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ed∣wards,</HI>
to deliver their Sentence, with some
Reasons adjoyn'd, not many, but of the
strongest. I told Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> that this
Day, I expected he should shew himself a
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
worthy Man; that he should deliver his
Judgment <HI>per extensum</HI>; that they had
labour'd to blemish his Skill, and to slight
his Learning especially, therefore, both
for his Conscience, and his Credit, he
should shew what was in him, to maintain
an honest Cause. If Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> who came after him, should
bespatter him in their Choler, or lay any
Imputation upon him, he should find that
some of us would take it off him. To my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> I said, <HI>We have three that
speak first, who, I trust, will lay such a Founda∣tion
in the Heart of the Hearers, as shall not
be remov'd. But the other Side have this Advan∣tage
over us, they are seven of them Lawyers
and Bishops, to answer what our three have
said; and perhaps with weak Men, such a Stream
of such Persons may much prevail: But let not
that dismay you, my Lord, only take this Course;
Deliver, first, your own Meditations; and then,
having taken with your Pen, some of the Ab∣surdities,
which, in the Sentence, some of them
will deliver, blast those, and let the Auditors
see, that by you the Stream is turn'd. Then
leave it to me, and I doubt not, in Almighty
God, but to batter their Nullity to Dust. That
tho' they have it by the major part of Voices,
yet, the World shall see what the Cause is, and
they shall have little Comfort by it. I am very
well provided; I am no way afraid; and you
shall see, I will not be Tongue-ty'd.</HI> So confi∣dent
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
was I in the Honesty of the Cause,
and in the Helps of Almighty God, that I
was not now afraid of ten thousands of
People; but did long to be at the Business,
as the Lord truely knoweth.</P>
<P>When now I was alone, revolving my
Meditations, Sir <HI>J. Caesar</HI> cometh into my
Study, to me, telleth me, <HI>That he wonder'd
that my Lord of</HI> Winchester <HI>was not come,
that it was even ten a Clock, that therefore it
was fit, that the Hour should be continu'd from
ten to twelve.</HI> I assented thereto; and by
some of the Commissioners the Time was
prorogu'd. Then cometh in Sir <HI>Thomas
Lake,</HI> with a Message from the King, which
he must not deliver 'till all the Commissi∣oners
were come together. So he was forc'd
to stay. Between Ten and Eleven, cometh
in my Lord of <HI>Winchester</HI>; who, as afterwards
found, had been all the Morning at the
Court. I told him, <HI>We had stay'd for him
two Hours and a half.</HI> His Lordship slight∣ly
excus'd it. Then, in the Gallery, Sir
<HI>Thomas Lake</HI> told us, <HI>That his Majesty had
sent him unto us, to deliver two Things.</HI> The
one was, <HI>That in our Sentence, we should take
heed of gauling of any Person.</HI> My Answer
was, <HI>That from the Beginning of this Process,
we had ever been wary not to offend in that
Kind; and that he should be much to Blame,
who, in the Conclusion, would transgress that
way.</HI> And so said the rest. The other was,
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
<HI>That we should not in any long Manner, but
compendiously, deliver what we had to say.</HI> I
pray'd Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> to explain that far∣ther,
whether we were only to say Yea or
or No, and no more: For I would obey the
King's Commandment.</P>
<P><HI>Tu Regina jube, mihi jussa capessere fas est.</HI>
He answer'd, <HI>That he could not say so, but that
we were to speak briefly. Yea,</HI> but said Sir <HI>Julius
Caesar, I know the King's Mind; for I was Yester∣day
with him, and he told me, that he expected that
we should go no farther than Yea, or Nay, for
of Reasons there would be no End. Yea,</HI> saith
he, <HI>The King told me he was promis'd so much.
By whom,</HI> said I. <HI>I think,</HI> quoth he, <HI>by your
Grace. Not so,</HI> said I: But I said, indeed,
<HI>Let every Man deliver his own Conscience, I
will not perturb the Sentence. No more indeed
will I.</HI> Then he replyeth, <HI>I know the King
expecteth we should say no more, than I do like
this Sentence, or, I do not like it. And that
you know, Sir</HI> Daniel Dun<HI>, is the Manner of
the Delegates, and not to go farther. It is so,</HI>
saith Sir <HI>Daniel.</HI> Upon this, the Bishops
all said, <HI>We were best to proceed in that Fashi∣on.</HI>
To which, I reply'd, <HI>I will not be
willful, but if it be agreed upon, and it be
the King's Pleasure, I will obey. But look you
to it; for if any Man give a Reason, I am
no more bound than he, but that I will return
the Reason of my Opinion and Judgment.</HI>
They all said, they would be observant of
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
it. Thus Sir <HI>Thomas Lake</HI> was dismiss'd.
Then we call'd for the Sentences on both
Sides, which the Counsel had ready. They
dislik'd that which was Absolutory of the
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and we approv'd it. We
found Fault with the other Sentence,
Anullatory, both for the Whole, and be∣cause,
some Parts in it, in our Judgment,
were apparently false. But they persisted
in their Intention. So we went into the
Hall, where, my self, my Lord of <HI>London,</HI>
Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ed∣wards,</HI>
freed my Lord of <HI>Essex.</HI> The Bi∣shops
of <HI>Winton, Ely, Litchfield,</HI> and <HI>Ro∣chester,</HI>
together with the two Chancellors,
and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> pronounc'd for the
Nullity, and subscrib'd the Sentence, my
Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> pronouncing it. We per∣ceiv'd
that they were afraid we should at
large speak our Reasons openly, being the
last who were to speak.</P>
<P>The three Bishops, of <HI>Winton, Ely,</HI>
and <HI>Litchfield,</HI> went immediately to the
Court, hoping to receive great Thanks for
their Service, but they waited a full Hour,
e'er they could speak with the King; how∣ever
they sped afterward. And we were
glad that we were freed of the Trouble.
And now, I, who would not have given
the Sentence for all the Gold in <HI>India,</HI> do
expect God's Pleasure, what will become of
this Business hereafter, and submit my self
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
to God's Providence, who ever preserveth
those that trust in him.</P>
<CLOSER>THIS Narration is wholly written with
mine own Hand, and was finish'd the second
of <HI>October,</HI> 1613, being the eighth Day after
the giving of the Sentence. And I protest be∣fore
Almighty God, that I have not willingly
written any Untruth therein; but have deliver'd
all things fairly, to the best of my Understand∣ing;
helping my self with such Memorials
and Notes, as I took from Time to Time, that
if there were occasion, I might thus at large
set down the Truth to Posterity, when this Case
shall be rung from <HI>Rome</HI> Gates, or the Fact
hereafter be question'd. <SIGNED>GEORGE Canterbury.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>Some Observable Things, since <HI>Sept.</HI>
25, 1613, when the Sentence was
given in the Cause of the Earl of
ESSEX, continu'd unto the Day of
the Marriage, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 26, 1613.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Sentence being given for
the Nullity, the Minds of Men
in their several Places, were
wonderfully distracted, and e∣very
one spake according to
their Fancies. But for the most part there
was a Detestation of the Thing, and a great
Dislike of those that gave the Sentence,
which was express'd by all Courses that
Men durst adventure upon. On the other
Side, there was a strange applauding and
commending, of those who withstood the
Separation; and from all Parts a Testimo∣ny
came unto them, That they had done
like Honest Men, albeit the only Scope
which they aim'd at, was the Discharge of
their Conscience, and not vain Popular Ap∣plause.
The Arch-bishop the Day after
the Sentence, went to the Court, to <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
and waited on the King to Chapel,
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
standing also by him in the Closet, where
he was strangely look'd on by the King,
as he was also by some of the Lords; but
nothing being said unto him, he took no
Notice of it, but bore all patiently. This
Strangeness of the King held on at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
and elsewhere; and it came to the
Arch-bishop's Ear, that the King spake
divers Times hardly of him, but much
magnify'd them of the Affirmative Part,
and especially my Lord of <HI>Winchester,</HI> as
the worthiest Man in the Kingdom. Some
things were done also in Recompence to
divers of them; as Sir <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>'s Son
was made a Knight, my Lord of <HI>Winton</HI>'s
Son also had the same Reward, which some
merry Fellow blighted with the Name of
Sir <HI>Nullity Hilson</HI>; and the Bishop of <HI>Litch∣field</HI>
must remove to <HI>Lincoln</HI>; and as for
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> it must be bestow'd on Mr. Dean
of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, that so Doctor <HI>Cary</HI> might be
preferr'd to the Deanery of <HI>Paul</HI>'s, for which
it was generally suppos'd, he should pay
well. But now it run currant, that the
Arch-bishop must no more have to do
with Naming any to Church-Livings, but
some Lords in Court should dispose of all;
and principally it must be provided, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Abbot</HI> must never be preferr'd, no, not
so much as to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> so far was he from
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> which was formerly promis'd un∣to
him. These things grew detestable to
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
the People, who fear'd that even Religion
would smart for it; but the Parties most
malign'd, were silent and patient, expect∣ing
God's Leisure, and Malice enough from
some other Men. The first thing of Bit∣terness
that appear'd, was a Letter from
<HI>Royston,</HI> under the King's Hand and Signet,
directed to the Commissioners in the former
Sentence, but brought to the Arch-Bishop
about three Weeks after the Sentence. This
was a most sharp Letter, complaining that
they of the Negative Part, for so they
were stil'd, had hinder'd the Act to be
made upon the Sentence; had solemnly
Protested against that which was done; had
given unto themselves other Titles than
were in the King's Commission; had glo∣rify'd
themselves in that which was done;
by which they laid an Imputation upon
the King's Conscience, who had declar'd
himself for the Divorce, and other things
of the like Nature. This Letter being read
to the Commissioners, the Arch-bishop said,
That he knew not what it meant; for he
understood of no Man that Protested, nor
knew nothing of any Man's arrogating of
Titles to him, or glorifying himself: And
as for the Act, he suppos'd it to be made
up in common Form, and never heard ought
to the contrary, neither meddled with any
thing therein, but left it to the Register,
and what he had done with it, he could not
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
tell. Furthermore, he ask'd all the Com∣missioners
particularly, if they knew what
this meant, or if any of them were able
to charge those of the Negative, with
the Points quarrelled at; who all, with one
Consent, deny'd that they could, and
expressly averr'd, that there was no such
thing done at the Time of the Sentence,
as had been complain'd upon. When stand∣ing
thus in Admiration, Sir <HI>Daniel Dun</HI>
took upon him to understand the Matter,
and said, that if the Register were call'd,
it would appear there was something in it.
<HI>Barker,</HI> the Register, is sent for, and being
demanded whether he had made up the Act,
he said that he had drawn it up in a Form
that he lik'd, but some other of the Com∣missioners
did dislike it. And thereupon he
shew'd two Forms, the one more large,
the other more brief; but both of them ha∣ving
in it, that the Arch-bishop, and the
rest of the Negative Party, protested against
the Sentence. Here every Man wonder'd
at him, out of what Ground he should do
this; and all the Commissioners with one
Consent, very much rebuk'd him, profes∣sing,
that there was no such Protestation
us'd. For the rest of the Charge in the
King's Letter, <HI>Barker</HI> freed all in all things,
save only Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who was absent by
reason of his sore Eyes. The Arch-bishop
upon this, desir'd the Commissioners to sus∣pend
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
their Judgment touching Dr. <HI>Ed∣wards,</HI>
'till he might answer for himself,
saying, that Honour, Justice, and Charity,
requir'd so much in his Behalf; and adding
withal, that he doubted not but it would
prove some mistaking of the Register's Part,
to whom it was apparent, that small Credit
was to be given, since he had so grossly set
down of them, that they Protested, when
all the Commissioners could witness the
contrary. Moreover he desir'd Mr. Chan∣cellor
of the Exchequer, and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI>
to certify the Lord Chamberlain, how free
and innocent from those Aspersions, the
rest were found, and that from Top to Toe,
it was nothing but Misprision. Before this
Truth was discover'd, it was known that a
Gentleman of the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s,
had said to Sir <HI>John Levison,</HI> and that, as
from his Lordship, <HI>That there was something
descry'd, which would break the Arch-bishop</HI>'s
<HI>Back</HI>; such Account was made of his Bu∣siness.</P>
<P>Thus Things pass'd silently until the
next Week, when upon the <HI>Thursday,</HI> be∣ing
High Commission Day, Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>
being amended, repair'd to <HI>Lambeth.</HI> His
coming was watched; and then was deli∣ver'd
to the Arch-bishop a second Letter
from the King, commending the Concur∣rence
of all to the Act, to be made up in
common Form; but requiring the Com∣missioners
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
to convene Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and the
Register before them, and to charge them
with all the fore-remember'd Matters, and
to learn where the Fault did lie. It was
also commanded, that they should require
the said Doctor and Register, to set down
in Writing what had pass'd between them;
and if it were found that Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> were
to blame, he should be suspended 'till the
King's Pleasure were farther known.</P>
<P>These Things are fallen upon; and Dr.
<HI>Edwards</HI> shew'd that the Register had
wronged him, and that no Part of the Ac∣cusation
was true, <HI>in modo &amp; forma,</HI> ap∣pealing
to the Commissioners, what Faith
might be given to <HI>Barker</HI> contesting against
him; when it had been manifestly proved,
that he had forged the Matter of Prote∣station
against my Lord of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> my
Lord of <HI>London,</HI> and the rest. Time is as∣signed
to them to deliver in their Writings,
and accordingly, about two Days after,
Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> bringeth to the Arch-bishop
his Answer, denying the Points whereon
he was accus'd. But <HI>Barker</HI> brought no∣thing
till a Fortnight after; and then, by
Candle-light, when the High-Commission
was risen, and the Commissioners were de∣parted,
he delivereth a long Writing to the
Arch-bishop, who could not read it that
Night; but reproved him for detaining
it so long.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71"/>
On the Morrow, my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
perus'd this Declaration; as as he found it
to be uncertainly and diffidently set down
for some other Circumstances, so he disco∣vered
there one Thing much to be obser∣ved,
and that was, that <HI>Barker</HI> delivered,
That some few Days after the Sentence,
the Lord Chamberlain sent for him, find∣ing
Fault that the Act was not made up.
And there Speech was, That some desir'd
to have their Titles put in, as well as the
Titles of others; and for that, <HI>Barker</HI> na∣med
Sir <HI>John Bennet.</HI> Whereunto the Lord
Chamberlain said, <HI>I know no Title that he
hath</HI>: <HI>Yes,</HI> said <HI>Barker, he is Judge of the
Prerogative Court of</HI> Canterbury. But <HI>Bar∣ker</HI>
concludeth the Narration, That him∣self
finding that he had named Sir <HI>John
Bennet</HI> unjustly, therefore was in mind to
excuse him, and was about to say, that he
had done him Wrong; but the Lord Cham∣berlain
was so angry, that he could not bring
it forth; but went his Way, leaving the
Lord in that Opinion.</P>
<P>By this it was descry'd, that in the first
Letter Sir <HI>John Bennet</HI> was aim'd at, as
well as Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> to put some Disgrace
upon him, which made Men wonderously
marvel at the vindicative Mind of some
Men, who sought for an Occasion to do
other Men Disgrace. The End of the
Matter was, That no Man could be touch'd;
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
and therefore the Arch-bishop, taking Sir
<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> with him, acquainted the King
(who was now return'd from <HI>Royston</HI>) with
the State of the whole Matter; informing
his Majesty, that Fault fell on no Man
save the Register; and therefore, if his
Highness were pleased to have him pu∣nish'd,
it might be so: But for the Thing
itself, since the Report was more than
there was Cause, Mr. Chancellor of the
<HI>Exchequer</HI> said, It was better to let it die,
and stir in it no farther. To this the
King assented, being not willing that any
Punishment should be laid on the Register;
whereby it appeared, that the Intendment
was, in the stirring of these Coals, to
have burnt some greater Persons than <HI>Bar∣ker,</HI>
the Register.</P>
<P>All this while it was confidently given
out, That because the Sentence had been
oppos'd, there should a Book be written in
the Defence of it; and one while it should
be by a Divine, and that sometimes was
my Lord of <HI>Winton,</HI> and sometimes my
Lord of <HI>Ely</HI>; and it was said, they were
earnestly about it: Another while, it
should be by a Civilian, and then Sir <HI>Da∣niel
Dun</HI> must do it: But at other Times it
must be by a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> who had written
somewhat of that Argument before the
Sentence; and other while two <HI>Scotchmen</HI>
must join together about it: And to make
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
the Thing the more probable, the Lord
<HI>Felton</HI> sent to the Arch-bishop for the Copy
of the <HI>Scotch</HI>-man's Writing, which was
sent unto him; and after copying of it out,
it was return'd to my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
again. This Speech of a Book continu'd
about nine Weeks in all; but at last Dr.
<HI>Stuart,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bird,</HI> were sent for to the
Lord Chamberlain, and their Judgment
was ask'd concerning that Point. Their
Advice was, That it should by no means
be medled withal, but that Things should
die of themselves: But no Questioning
by Writing; for so it might go on to the
World's End: For one Book might breed
another; and so, they whom it concern'd
should never be in rest. This was resolv'd
on; and afterwards there was no more
Speech of Writing, saving only faintingly
and whisperingly, but nothing to the
Purpose. It seem'd that the Commissioners
who were for the Nullity had enough of it,
and desir'd no more to bring themselves
on the Stage, being so by all Men ex∣claim'd
upon for that which they had
done.</P>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Winton,</HI> after the Sen∣tence,
went down with great Jollity, full
of Hope and Glory; but within a while
after, he grew much daunted, as some a∣bout
him, and namely his own Daughter,
reported; for he heard many Ways of the
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
strange Detestation which the World had
of the Deed; and the nick-naming of his
Son, much affected him: But his Adver∣tisements
from Sir <HI>Richard Norton,</HI> his Son-in-Law
did much trouble him: For Sir <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
wrote divers Times from <HI>London</HI> to
his Wife, That he could come in no Place,
but his Father-in-Law was rail'd upon:
That Men told him, that he thought he
had a Wife, but it was no longer than my
Lord of <HI>Winton</HI> pleas'd; for whensoever he
offended him he could make a Nullity
between them. Besides, the said Sir <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
told Mr. <HI>John More</HI> of <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-Inn,
divers Times, <HI>That it was such a Disgrace
unto him to hear how the World talk'd of that
Sentence, that although my Lord of</HI> Winton
<HI>promised to give him, his Wife, and Family,
their Diet and Entertainment so long as he
lived, yet he would get him to his own House,
and live there, where he had Means sufficient,
and not be subject to that perpetual Scorn which
would follow him so long as he remain'd in his
Father-in-Law's Company.</HI></P>
<P>By these, and the like Passages, it was
guess'd, that the rest of the Commissioners,
who were for the Sentence, had little Com∣fort
in themselves of that which they had
done. On the other Part, the Arch-bishop,
and those who stood with him, had their
Honesty and Justice sounded out every Day
more and more; and many Messages were
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
brought them, and divers Letters written
unto them, or shew'd them by some Friends,
from sundry of the Bishops in the Land,
from the Universities, from many godly
Preachers out of all Parts, which was an
exceeding Consolation unto them, among
the many Frowns which they did bear,
That there was an universal Concurrence
of all honest Men to approve that which
they had done. And the Arch-bishop had
privately, from many great ones in Court,
and Nobles, and worthy Personages else∣where,
such Significations of their good
Acceptance which he did, that it cheer'd
him much inwardly, and he was nothing
dismay'd.</P>
<P>Now, about the Middle of <HI>November,</HI> the
Wheel was turn'd about: For since nothing
could be gain'd by speaking hardly of the
negative Part, they thought they would
make Use of them another Way, and that
should be by making the World believe,
that they had now given Approbation of
the Fact. And thereupon it was, in Court
and <HI>London,</HI> asseverantly given out; and
the Fame of it went far and near, That
the Arch-bishop, and the rest, after more
mature Deliberation, had testify'd their
Concurrence with the rest of the Commis∣sioners,
and all now were of one Mind.
Men did not hastily believe this; but yet
divers of good Rank came and sent to the
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
Arch-bishop and the rest, to know whether
those things were so or no. And when it
was found to be but a Jargon, it gave a
great deal of Contentment, and remov'd a∣way
much Scandal which formerly was ta∣ken.
Yet again afterward it was bruted,
the second Time, That my Lord of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>
had given the King Satisfaction in
the Matter; and my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> on
such a <HI>Sunday,</HI> had come and submitted
himself to my Lord Chamberlain, and the
rest had relented. Nay, it went so far,
that in <HI>Yelverton,</HI> the King's Solicitor, and a
great Dependent upon the House of <HI>Suf∣folk,</HI>
told Mr. <HI>Pye</HI> the Counsellor, and Mr.
<HI>Cholmeley</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Solicitor, co∣ming
unto him about Books to be drawn
up, for passing back the Jointure of the
Lady <HI>Frances</HI>'s Part, and the Portion of
the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Part, <HI>That the gainsaying
Commissioners were now consenting, and the great
Man beyond the Water was come over</HI>; which
he knew so assuredly, that <HI>he had seen it ra∣tify'd
by the Subscription of the Arch-bishop and
the rest.</HI> Yea, farther, he added, that <HI>there
was great Reason, at the first, wherefore my
Lord of</HI> Canterbury<HI>, and the others, should
stand against the Separation; for they had just
Cause, at the first, to fear that this Fact might
be drawn into Example, and so Marriages ordi∣narily
be violated; but now it was resolv'd that
no more such should be permitted, and thereupon</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
<HI>they assented.</HI> These Things were inforc'd to
be endur'd with Silence, for the avoiding
of Clamour, and making of Trouble.</P>
<P>But now behold an admirable Device of
the Bishop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> which sheweth
what his own Opinion was of the Validity
of the Sentence. I will set it down as it
came to be acted.</P>
<P>On the 26th of <HI>November, Searle</HI> the
Proctor cometh to my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and bringeth with him a Writ
of <HI>Certiorari</HI> out of the Chancery, direct∣ed
to the Commissioners in the Cause be∣tween
the Lady <HI>Frances</HI> and the Earl of
<HI>Essex.</HI> The Arch-bishop was pray'd to
open it, and so he did, and there found
that four of them, <HI>sub sigillis vestris</HI> were, re∣quired
to certify <HI>Recordum Sententiae,</HI> into
the Chancery. The Arch bishop asked
<HI>Searle, If this were an usual Thing?</HI> Who
answered, <HI>No, he had not known any such
Thing before:</HI> It is reply'd, <HI>What then should
be the Reason thereof?</HI> Answer was made,
<HI>That since the Matter was controversed in the
Sentence, least there should be Question of the
Marriage afterwards, the Earl of</HI> Somerset
<HI>would have the Sentence lying by him under the
Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>ratify'd.</HI> The Arch-bishop
thought that to be but a weak Hold,
yet charged <HI>Searle</HI> to see such an Instrument
drawn, and a Certificate should according∣ly
be made. On the <HI>Wednesday</HI> after, <HI>Bar∣ker</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
the Register, cometh to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and
sheweth a Form of a Draught in Paper,
how the Certificate should be return'd in
the Names of all the Commissioners spe∣cially
put down. The Arch-bishop, in the
Reading of it, found five or six Lines ha∣ving
a black Line drawn under them; and
thereupon, the more marking the Words
contained in them, found that which he
liked not. Thereupon he ask'd <HI>Barker,</HI>
<HI>who lined those Words? Barker</HI> said, <HI>He him∣self
did.</HI> The other asked, <HI>What was the
Reason of it?</HI> And it was answer'd, <HI>Because
Sir</HI> John Bennet <HI>and some other of the Doctors
with him had disliked that Sentence.</HI> Quoth
the Arch-bishop, <HI>And they had Reason for it:
Who put them first in?</HI> Barker said, <HI>None
but himself.</HI> Quoth the Arch-bishop then,
<HI>May not the Certificate stand as well without
those Words as with them?</HI> To which <HI>Barker</HI>
answer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then said the Arch-bishop,
<HI>Let them be stricken out.</HI> Here the Register,
with somewhat ado, faintly made Answer,
<HI>That the Commissioners on the other Side would
by no Means have them out.</HI> The Arch-bishop
said, <HI>Then I perceive it is a Device to entangle
us: I am ready to certify the Sentence as the
Writ requireth, but I will none of this.</HI> Bar∣ker<HI>,
I am first in the Commission, and for my
Place sake, I would have looked, that I should
have been conferr'd withal, what had been fit
to return, and not to have had this Trick put</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
<HI>upon me, that either I must certify that which
crosseth my Judgment at the Time of giving
the Sentence, or I must be forced not to certify
at all.</HI> So <HI>Barker</HI> departed, and all was
quiet until the <HI>Monday</HI> after; at which
Time the Arch-bishop was early at
<HI>White-Hall,</HI> the Council sitting that Mor∣ning.
There, in the waiting Chamber, at
the End of the Privy-Gallery, the Bishop
of <HI>Litchfield</HI> cometh to him, and saith, <HI>My
Lord, we have receiv'd a Writ of</HI> Certiorari
<HI>out of the Chancery, to certify the Sentence for
the Nullity. Yea,</HI> saith the Arch-bishop, <HI>and
I am ready to certify it. But,</HI> saith the Bi∣shop,
<HI>He who framed the Writ, hath made it</HI>
sub Sigillis vestris, <HI>and doth not know that
there is a Seal of Office for the Delegates; it
should have been</HI> sub Sigillo Communi. Be∣fore
the Arch-bishop could reply, in co∣meth
the Lord Chancellor, and to him
cometh out of the next Chamber the Lord
Chamberlain; and then those two Lords,
together with the Bishop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI>
drew themselves to a Window, and there
had they secret Communication about
the altering of the Form of the Writ,
as the Effect declared; for that After∣noon,
a Cause being to be heard touch∣ing
<HI>Alimony,</HI> from Sir <HI>Pexal Brocas</HI> to his
Lady; and the Committees in it being the
Bishop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and Mr. Chancellor of
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
the Dutchy, and my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI>
being Umpire; before Mr. Chancellor was
come, <HI>Bembo,</HI> Deputy to the Clerk of the
Crown, came into the Parlour at <HI>Lambeth,</HI>
and had private Speech with the Bishop of
<HI>Litchfield.</HI> The Arch-bishop going out into
the Garden, <HI>Litchfield</HI> follow'd him, and told
him, <HI>That Mr.</HI> Bembo <HI>had brought another
Form of a Writ</HI>; and thereupon shewed
him the Words <HI>sub communi sigillo.</HI> The
Arch-bishop bid him do as he thought
good, and withdrew himself into the low
Stone-Gallery, whither <HI>Litchfield</HI> follow'd
him, and used these Words: <HI>My Lord,
here is a Form of a Certificate, which hath
been thought fit to use in the Business of my
Lord Chamberlain; and I hear your Grace ta∣keth
Exception to some Things in it.</HI> Then
he pull'd out the very Paper which <HI>Barker</HI>
formerly had shew'd. The Arch-bishop
answer'd, <HI>My Lord, have I not Reason to
take Exception to these Words, that</HI> post om∣nimodam
Veritatis disquisitionem<HI>,</HI> post pro∣bationes
idoneas &amp; de jure requisitas<HI>, we gave
such a Sentence? For, to subscribe this, were
to proclaim my self a dishonest Man upon Re∣cord:
For if these Things be true, why did I
deny to join in the Sentence?</HI> Quoth <HI>Litchfield,
This here is true; for it cannot be deny'd, but
some</HI> probationes idoneae<HI>,</HI> &amp; de jure requisi∣tae
<HI>were used; and we do not say that all were.</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
The Arch-bishop answered, <HI>You shall do
well, therefore, to certify</HI> post probationes
aliquas<HI>, and I will joyn with you; but as it
standeth now indefinitely, it will be taken as if
all had been used; I pray you therefore to alter
the Certificate, and make Things plain. My
Lord,</HI> quoth <HI>Litchfield, I will deal plainly with
you; because the Words were in, and doubt was
made, whether they should pass or no: The King's
Majesty hath been acquainted with the Business;
and he, by a Letter from Sir</HI> Thomas Lake<HI>, hath
sent Word expressly, that he will have them in.</HI>
The Arch-bishop said, <HI>Let them then certify who
will avow those Words, for I cannot condescend
unto them. And hath not that Person done a
good Office, who hath informed the King hereof;
that Distraction may still be among the Com∣missioners,
and there may never be an End of
Difference.</HI> The Bishop said, <HI>My Lord, I
could wish that you would yield unto the King,
and so give him Satisfaction.</HI> The Arch-bi∣shop
answer'd, <HI>What would you have me do?
I gave the Sentence as I was perswaded in Con∣science,
and since that Time I have been silent,
and meddle no way in the Matter: I did what
I did upon long Deliberation; and I may not in
Private, upon no Ground since appearing to
me, cross that which I have done in Publick.</HI>
It was farther added, <HI>That there was Reason
to suspect, that they did ill Offices, who held
those Things still on Foot: That there never was</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
<HI>any Man, who sought to grace himself by dis∣gracing
others, but it met him at the Lane's
End, at one Time or another.</HI> These Things
passed then; and after the Cause heard be∣tween
Sir <HI>Pexal Brocas</HI> and his Wife, the
Bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> said to the Arch-bishop
at his Parting, <HI>My Lord, you will give us
leave to certify then as we purpose?</HI> To which
the Arch-bishop answer'd, <HI>Yea, with all
my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, the Arch-bishop re∣member'd,
that by the Carriage of Things
in such Fashion as was pretended, he might
be trick'd: For if the Names of all the
Commissioners were put into the Certifi∣cate,
and four of them might certify un∣der
a common Seal, it should not be
known hereafter, but that he and his Fel∣lows
concurr'd therein, and that, with the
Words which were excepted against: He
therefore sent for <HI>Barker,</HI> and in the Pre∣sence
of Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI> and two Servants,
being Publick Notaries, he expostulated
with <HI>Barker,</HI> as serving Mens Turns, ra∣ther
than caring for Peace; and then pun∣ctually
he deliver'd these Things.</P>
<P>First, <HI>The Writ requireth me to certify the
Sentence, and I am ready to do it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>If the whole Process be desir'd, I
am willing to certify that also.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83"/>
Thirdly, <HI>For the Words in Question, be∣cause
they were put in without my Privity, and
they may as well be left out as put in, by your
own Saying, I pray to be forborn for returning
of them.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>I require you to conceal these
Things as much as you may, that the World
take no new Alarm of any Difference between
the Commissioners.</HI></P>
<P>The Arch-bishop spake of returning the
whole Process, because he had heard, that
at the first, it was meant it should be so;
but Dr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> and, perhaps, some other of
the Civilians, dissuaded that by all Means;
least, if the whole were on Record in the
Chancery, every Man that list, hereafter,
might censure that Sentence, and sift
the Grounds whereon the Commissioners
proceeded; it was good, therefore, to take
away that Occasion.</P>
<P>When Matters were thus resolv'd, the
Bishop of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> who meant to play
his Prizes in this Service, speaketh to <HI>Bem∣bo,</HI>
to draw some Preface, or Conclusion, to
add to the Certificate; that it might not
only be sign'd with the great Seal, as af∣ter
the Form of an <HI>Inspeximus</HI>; but that
his Majesty might add a Confirmation to
it: And when Mr. <HI>Bembo,</HI> as unacquainted
with this Fashion, did not fit the Bishop's
Humour, his Lordship took on him to do
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
it himself. He drew up, therefore, a
strange Writing, as was inform'd by a cre∣dible
Person that saw it, containing bar∣barous
Latin, and no good Congruity of
Sense. But the Matter of it was, that his
Majesty having the Authority of the Pope
now in himself, and in <HI>scrinio pectoris,</HI> ha∣ving
Power to ratify, did, <HI>ex plenitudine
potestatis,</HI> confirm that Divorce to all In∣tents
and Purposes. In an Evening Dr.
<HI>Martin</HI> was sent for to the Lord Chamber∣lain,
and there was the Bishop with his
Papers. The Doctor, as it hath been ere∣dibly
deliver'd, being shew'd that Writing,
and his Opinion thereupon being ask'd,
did utterly dislike it, and said, <HI>That the
King claim'd nothing of the Pope's Power; but
took that as his own, which the Pope had usmp∣ed:
That the King had spoke before by his
Judges Delegate, and had nothing more to do:
That if the Sentence were not good already, no
Confirmation could make it good.</HI> And when
the Bishop was earnest in Defence of his
Device, there was a little Heat stricken be∣tween
the Doctor and him, so that these
Words passed from the said Doctor: <HI>You do,
as much as in you lyeth, spit in the Face of the
King our Master, by laying on him all the
Matter; whereas the Scandal that hath already
been, is this, that his Majesty is said to deal
so much in the Matter. My Lord, you are to</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
<HI>blame to enter into these Things without Advice
of Men skilful in the Law: Hath Dr.</HI> Stuart
<HI>or Dr.</HI> Bird <HI>been acquainted herewithal?</HI> The
Bishop saith, <HI>No; but for this Matter, I
know as much Law at the best of you all.</HI> Dr.
<HI>Martin</HI> reply'd, <HI>No: Your Lordship thinketh,
that because you have read two or three Chapters
of the Canon-Law about this late Business, you
know as much as we do, who have spent all our
Lives in that Profession: I tell your Lordship,
I have study'd the Law these two and thirty
Years; and therefore, you shall give me leave to
believe that I know more therein than you can.
I am the King's Advocate, and therefore may
suffer nothing with my Consent to pass disho∣nourable
to my Master.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these Contestations, the Lord
Chamberlain was much troubled, saying,
<HI>What a Matter is this, that Men should be of
such contrary Opinions! What shall we do?</HI>
When the Bishop murmur'd much that his
Conceit was not follow'd, Dr. <HI>Martin</HI> said
thus: <HI>My Lord, in a Business of this Impor∣tance,
I will not wish your Lordship to follow
my single Advice, but let this be done; to Mor∣row
let Sir</HI> William Button<HI>, in your Lordship's
Name, come to</HI> Doctors-Commons<HI>; and let
him get together Sir</HI> Daniel Dun<HI>, Dr.</HI> Stuart<HI>,
and Dr.</HI> Bird<HI>, and I will attend them; and
then we will consult jointly what is fit to be
done.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="86"/>
This Advice was much liked; and on
the Morrow, being <HI>Friday,</HI> they all assem∣bled,
and, for two Hours, all Points were
debated; but the Conclusion was, <HI>That
there should be no farther Confirmation: For
this was to proclaim, that the Sentence was de∣fective
in itself, which would make a great
Buzz in the World:</HI> And therefore, the
Counsel was in general, <HI>That too much had
been done, and for the Time to come, the Care
must be, how to lay it asleep fairly.</HI></P>
<P>This Resolution being taken, the next
Knack was, that so many of the Com∣missioners
as were for the Sentence, should
be call'd together; and they should be
made acquainted with this, that the Bishop
might be fairly put off. On the <HI>Saturday</HI>
Night, therefore, in the Dark, at Sir <HI>Ju∣lius
Caesar</HI>'s House in the <HI>Strand,</HI> met the
Bishops of <HI>Ely, Litchfield, Rochester,</HI> the two
Chancellors of the Exchequer and Dutchy,
and Sir <HI>Daniel Dun,</HI> and well near for an
Hour, they privately debated what they
thought fit, but, as it seemeth, resolv'd as
before, and so departed.</P>
<P>A Friend being the next Day with
the Lady <HI>Caesar,</HI> and knowing of the Meet∣ting,
asked her, <HI>What about it was?</HI> She
answer'd, <HI>It is something about the late Nul∣lity;
but what it is, I do not know. It seem∣eth,
that they who were the Doers in it, think</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="87"/><HI>somewhat is amiss. They suppose all is not well
about it, and I, for my part, think so also.</HI></P>
<P>A Man would have supposed, that all
these Things should have contented the
Bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI>; but he was so far in
Love with his own Invention, that yet he
would not be beat off; and therefore, to
merit the more, he once again moveth the
Lord Chamberlain to send to Sir <HI>Francis
Bacon,</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Yelverton,</HI> being of the
King's learned Council, to know their Opi∣nion:
Which being done; and they two,
for the Reasons above named, concurring
with the Civilians: The Bishop, as it
hath been credibly related, said of them,
together with the rest, <HI>They are all Fools,</HI>
And so ended this Stratagem; but the
Worker thereof was not yet for an End.</P>
<P>From the Beginning of this whole Questi∣on
of the Nullity, the Bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI>
had carry'd himself variously, sometimes
being vehement in Words, publickly a∣gainst
the Separation, and other Times in
Deed, giving Furtherance to it. Many
Speeches he had privately with the Arch-Bishop,
making shew of much Honesty and
Respect to him, which the Arch-bishop e∣ver
warily observ'd; thinking, notwith∣standing,
that these had been Testimonies
of the working of his Conscience, conflict∣ing
in it self, but not resolv'd what to do.
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
In the mean Time, from the Court, from
London, and out of the Country, the Arch-bishop
was still call'd upon by divers wor∣thy
Friends, <HI>That he should take heed of that
Bishop; that he was ever, and in all Things
naught: That he did all the worst Offices that
possibly he could, and was still stirring the
Coals, to procure to himself a Reputation;
that he was zealous of the House of</HI> Suffolk.
The Arch-bishop forgot not those many
Warnings, but carry'd himself very warily
towards him: Yet out of Charity, it still
came in his Mind, <HI>He is a Bishop, I know no
Evil of him; I ought not to condemn a Man
upon a Generality; I have no particular Proof
of his Misbehaviour in this behalf, although
he dealt ill with the late Lord Treasurer, and
most falsly with the Arch-bishop</HI> Bancroft <HI>in
his Life-time, and after his Death; and for
that Cause was detested by both of them; yet
an honest Man may think, that Experience hath
reform'd him, and now he is amended.</HI> Yet it
much affected the Arch-bishop, that all
Men spake so ill of him; and one Speech of
an old Courtier, a very honest Knight,
enter'd far with him. For about a Fort∣night
before the Marriage, the said Cour∣tier,
speaking privately with the Arch-Bishop,
among other Words, he us'd this.
<HI>I know not what the Bishop of</HI> Litchfield
<HI>doth among you; but he hath made a shift</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
<HI>to be taken for a Knave, generally with us
in the Court.</HI> Now, whether the next Prank
will verify so much or no, let the Reader
judge. Eight Days before the Marriage,
on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, that Bishop com∣eth
to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and in private Conference
with the Arch bishop, he telleth him, <HI>That
out of his Love and Respect to his Grace, he
was come voluntarily, as of himself, to know
his Mind about one Matter, and it was this.
On St.</HI> Stephen's <HI>Day,</HI> saith he, <HI>the Lord
Chamberlain meaneth to have this great Mar∣riage
go forward: Now it may, perhaps, be
desir'd, that a Licence should be given by you,
that the Banes may not be ask'd, which if you
like not to grant, I may be the Means to free
you from being mov'd to it.</HI> The Arch-bishop
said, <HI>What have I to do with grant∣ing
of a License; it belongeth not to me:
But wherefore should there be any Need of
a License; the Marriage is intended to be
Publick; Masks and Shews are made for the
same; all</HI> England <HI>taketh Notice of it, and
therefore it were good, that the Banes were
openly ask'd, as the Manner is of such Mar∣riages
as are made in the King's Chapel. Yea,
the Lady</HI> Elizabeth <HI>herself, had her Banes
ask'd. My Lord,</HI> saith Litchfield, <HI>there is
some Cause why it should be done without
publishing the Banes: For peradventure some
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy may step up, and make a Disturbance.</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
<HI>You know what a mad, naked Fellow, came in
to St.</HI> James's<HI>, after the Death of the Prince;
if such a one should come in now, what a
Work would it make?</HI> The Arch-bishop won∣der'd
within himself, to hear such a Re∣ply,
and thought surely, that it was no
mad Body that they should need to stand
in fear of, but they suspected somewhat
else. But his Answer was, <HI>My Lord, there
come no such into the King's Chapel; there
be Doors and Officers to keep such out. But
if it should be suspected, that any would op∣pose,
it is best the Banes be ask'd, for then
there will be some warning of the Gain-saying;
whereas, otherwise, if at the Time of the Mar∣riage,
one should suddenly start up, it would
make a greater Trouble.</HI> Notwithstanding
the Bishop went on, <HI>That a License would
cut off all the Doubt.</HI> The Arch-bishop an∣swer'd,
<HI>But what have I to do with grant∣ing
a License in the King's Chapel: It be∣longeth
to the Ordinary of the Place, and that
is my Lord of</HI> Bath<HI>, as Dean of the Chapel.</HI>
Litchfield reply'd, <HI>He never granted any, and
he hath no Seal for that Office. It was an∣swer'd,
He never granted any, because no Body
ever desir'd it; but the Manner was, that the
Banes were publish'd. But as for the Seal of
the Office, who doth not know that any Seal
will serve; and none better than his Bishop's
Seal, it being said,</HI> Datum sub sigillo nostro
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
Episcopali, quo in hoc casu<HI>; or</HI> hoc Tempore
utimur. <HI>King</HI> James <HI>at the first, did use
the Seal of Queen</HI> Elizabeth<HI>, 'till a new one
was made.</HI> The Bishop proceedeth, <HI>Yet it
would be fit that you granted the License, if
it be requested.</HI> To this the Arch-bishop
said, <HI>I shall do that which never any of my
Predecessors did. Yes,</HI> quoth Litchfield, <HI>If
you would seek your Records, you should find
some so granted.</HI> The Arch bishop answer'd,
<HI>I have enquir'd of my Officers, and they tell
me, That no such thing was heard of, in</HI>
Omni Hominum Memoria. <HI>But</HI> my Lord<HI>,
I know that my Lord of</HI> Bath <HI>hath it under
the Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>exclusively, to the
Arch-bishop; so that in direct Words there is
a Restraint, that he may not meddle there.
Yea, but,</HI> quoth Litchfield, <HI>you have an Act
of Parliament, enabling you to grant Dispen∣sations
to the King and his Children; and
therefore it belongeth to you.</HI> Said the Arch-bishop,
<HI>Do not you think that I understand
the Act of Parliament as well as you?</HI> My
Lord<HI>, Do you think that that Statute was
made for these ordinary Graces and Dispen∣sations?
Why, is not your Lordship able, with∣in
your Diocess, to grant a License, that a
Marriage may be solemniz'd, and not the Banes
ask'd? Yes,</HI> saith he, <HI>I may: Nay, every
Arch-deacon may do it within his Jurisdiction.
Then my Lord,</HI> quoth the Arch-bishop, <HI>must</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
<HI>an Act of Parliament be made to grant the
Arch-bishop Power to do that which every
Arch-deacon may do within his Precinct?
There is surely some other Matter in it. But
I marvel, my Lord, that you are now so
earnest for the Arch-bishop's Licenses, when,
as I have heard, in the Days of my Predecessor,
when you were Bishop of</HI> Rochester<HI>, you would
not suffer the Arch-bishop's Licenses to pass
within your Diocess: No,</HI> saith he, <HI>it was for</HI>
Westminster <HI>that I did strive, not for the
Diocess of</HI> Rochester. <HI>And it is true, that
there be Records in that Church, that the
Monks did contend with the King about di∣vers
Questions. I had Reason therefore, to
stand for the Privileges of my Church.</HI> It was
answer'd, <HI>So hath my Lord of</HI> Bath <HI>to stand
for the Rights of the King's Chapel.</HI> The
Arch-bishop seeing how earnest the Man
was, in so unreasonable a Thing, said
farther, <HI>My Lord,</HI> you have mine Answer,
but let me now tell you one thing. <HI>It
is six Weeks agone, that I heard from the
Court, and many Times since I have had it
reiterated, that such a Trick should be put up∣on
me: That although it needed not, yet I
should be mov'd for granting this License, be∣cause
thereby I should be constrain'd, either to
grant it, and so cross my former Sentence, and
involvedly give my Consent to the Nullity, or
I should deny it, and so grate once again up∣on</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
<HI>the King's Displeasure. You see now I
have given you a fair Answer, which may free
me from both. But, my Lord, I pray God
you do good Offices in this Business. I fear
you put your self into many Things, which
may be better forborn. But let me tell you,
there was never any Man, who sought to
raise himself by wronging another, but at one
Time or other he had enough of it. It is
now almost three Months since this Sentence
is given, and since that Time, I have not
meddled with the Matter, for offending the
King. I am silent, and no way oppose, and
Men have their End; yet cannot I be quiet.
I would have you know, that God beholdeth
these things, and remembereth them. And for
my Part, I am not blind, I see well what is
done; and I shall not always be silent. The
Time will come, that I must speak; and it shall
appear I am not Tongue-ty'd.</HI> This made
the Bishop not so forward as before, but
Occasion of a farther Speech being offer'd;
the Arch-bishop went on, and said, <HI>The
Sentence which I gave, was in the Fear of God,
and according to my Conscience: And if that
had been done, which was convenient, and we
called for, there needed not to have been any
Division in Judgment. For, my Lord, you may
remember when you came to me at</HI> Croydon<HI>,
and brought these Papers from the King, after
the reading whereof, I slept little that Night,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
<HI>how desirous I was to give his Majesty Satis∣faction;
and therefore pray'd you, fetching out
the Process unto you, to tell me whereupon I
should ground my Sentence. You shew'd me one
Article,</HI> that he had not known her, nor
he thought that he never should. <HI>I told
you then, Yea, that was for want of Love,
for he said,</HI> When I came out of <HI>France,</HI> I
lov'd her; I do not so, neither ever shall I.
<HI>It is want of Love.</HI> To this the Bishop
said, <HI>Yea, and the Earl added,</HI> That he had
done his Best oftentimes, Carnally to know
her, but he found an Imperfection in him∣self.
The Arch-bishop reply'd to this, <HI>Oh,
my Lord! Never say so; for his Lordship's
Answers upon his Oath, are to the contrary:</HI>
He found no Defect or Impediment in him∣self.
<HI>And if I shall speak my private Opi∣nion,
although I would not have you believe it,
I think the Earl as able a Man for a Wo∣man,
as any is in</HI> England. <HI>And I think to
the contrary,</HI> Quoth Litchfield. The Arch-bishop
went on: <HI>But, my Lord, when your
Lordship and I had these Difficulties in our
Mind at</HI> Croydon<HI>, you told me of one thing
which I embrac'd as an Oracle from Heaven.
And that was, that to rid our selves of these
Distractions, we had no other Way, but to call
the Earl of Essex again upon his Oath, that so
giving us a fuller Answer, we might either have
good Ground to pronounce for the Nullity, or</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
<HI>Matter to give Reason why we might not
condescend unto it. I approv'd this, and you
know how the next Day, in publick Court, it
was mov'd, and my Lords of</HI> Winchester<HI>,</HI> Ely<HI>,</HI>
Rochester<HI>, and your self, gave very good
liking to it; and no Man said any thing
against it, except Mr. Chancellor of the Exche∣quer,
who softly spake,</HI> I know not whether
that will be permitted. <HI>But you may re∣member,
you were intreated to deliver this to
the King at</HI> Theobalds<HI>, from whom you brought
Word,</HI> That it should not be granted, be∣cause
the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> being partly pro∣vok'd
by his falling out with Mr. <HI>Henry
Howard,</HI> and partly being counselled by
the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> would speak all
things to hinder the Nullity. My Answer
then was, <HI>That he was to speak upon his
Oath, and we would most strictly examine him.</HI>
When that was deny'd, which should have
led us to the Truth, I must confess I had
never any mind to pronounce for the Se∣paration.
The Bishop seem'd to take no
great Pleasure to hear these things thus
repeated, but fared, as if he could have
wish'd, that they all had been forgotten.
The Conclusion of all was, that the Bishop
seem'd to be well satisfy'd, that no License
was given, and promis'd the Arch-bishop,
to take Care that he should no farther be
troubled with it, assuring him, <HI>That he did</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
<HI>ever good Offices to him, whereof the King could
give Witness, and would; and he would ever
make the best of things.</HI> To which the Arch-bishop
said, <HI>If he did, he would take it for
a Kindness at his Hands,</HI> and so he depar∣ted.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Day the Banes
were ask'd in the Chapel, and there was
nothing but fair Weather, the Arch-bishop
attending the King in the Closet. On the
<HI>Monday</HI> the King went to <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court;
and that Day the Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI>
came to <HI>Lambeth:</HI> He told the Arch-bishop,
that he had a direct Message unto him from
the King, and that was, That his Majesty
did much marvel, that he spake not with
him about the Sentence: That the King
expected Satisfaction and Submission. His
Lordship added, That he perceiv'd that the
King had some Scruple in his Mind, which
he wish'd should be remov'd before his go∣ing
to the Communion on <HI>Christmas</HI> Day.
The Arch-bishop knew not that the Bishop
of <HI>Litchfield</HI> had dealt any Way treache∣rously
with him, and therefore was con∣strain'd
to answer, in general, that he
knew not what to say to his Highness.
He persuaded himself, that in giving of
the Sentence he had done his Duty, and
therefore could not tell how to make a
Submission where he conceiv'd no Fault.
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
If in any Circumstance he had err'd, he
was ready to testify his Sorrow for it; but
he knew no such Thing; yet, if his Maje∣sty
was displeas'd at him, to signify his
Obedience to his King and Sovereign, to
whom he was so much bound, he would
not refuse, if the King were pleas'd to re∣strain
him of his Liberty, and lay him in
the Tower all the Days of his Life, to
submit himself unto it patiently, without
Murmuring.</P>
<P>Furthermore, he pray'd the Bishop of
<HI>Bath,</HI> and (who, on the Morrow, was to go
to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court) to signify, humbly to
his Majesty, That he had nothing in this
World more precious than his Life; and
that he wish'd, that he had given that
Life as a Redemption, that the King's
Hand had never been in that Business.
And withal, he said, that at the coming
of the King, he would attend his Maje∣sty.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night, the King came to
<HI>White-Hall</HI>; and on the <HI>Thursday,</HI> after
Dinner, my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI> went to the
Court, where they were all busy about
Plate and Jewels against the Marriage. Not∣withstanding,
he had hastily Speech of
divers Matters with the King; and in
the End, he said privately unto his High∣ness,
<HI>May it please your Majesty, I understand,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
<HI>by my Lord of</HI> Bath and Wells<HI>, That your
Majesty expects that I should give you an Ac∣count
about the Matter of the Lord of</HI> Essex,
<HI>and the Lady</HI> Frances<HI>: I can say nothing more
than this, That I was put into the Commission
as a Judge, and at the Time of Sentence, I did
my Conscience; and since I have not meddled
with the Matter. Yes,</HI> saith the King, <HI>I hear
you deny'd a License to be granted, for not
asking of the Banes; which I wonder you
would do, since the Sentence was pass'd. No,</HI>
said the Arch-bishop, <HI>I deny'd no License;
but I advis'd, that the best Course was, that the
Banes should be ask'd according to the Custom
us'd in the Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I said, <HI>That if any License should
be granted, it belong'd not to me to give it,
but to the Ordinary of the Place, the Dean of
the Chapel, who hath it under your Majesty's
Great Seal, exclusive to the Arch-bishoprick.
Yea,</HI> said the King, <HI>My Lord of</HI> Bath <HI>said
so; but I am told it is otherwise.</HI> The
Arch-bishop reply'd, <HI>Nay, it is so in∣deed.</HI></P>
<P>And thirdly, said he, <HI>My Answer was,
That never any of my Predecessors granted
License for any Thing done in the King's
Chapel: I have receiv'd Information so,
from my Officers. It had then been Pre∣sumption
in me, to attempt that which
belong'd not unto me. This is another</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
<HI>ther Matter,</HI> saith the King, <HI>Were these your
Answers? I was told otherwise. But I will
take some other Time to speak with you.</HI>
The Arch-bishop, after this, attended half
an Hour, and nothing being said, he de∣parted.</P>
<P>The same Night, a Friend coming to
<HI>Lambeth,</HI> told my Lord, <HI>That he had been
that Day with the Lord</HI> Knowles<HI>, where he
found, that the Bishop of</HI> Litchfield <HI>had
exceedingly wrong'd my Lord of</HI> Canterbury:
<HI>For he had reported all the Speech about the Li∣cense,
in a spiteful Manner, said, it was abso∣lutely
deny'd: That the Arch-bishop gave out,</HI>
That the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was very Potent for
a Woman; and that he intended to que∣stion
this new Marriage, at one Time or
other, that it should never take effect.</P>
<P>This said, the Gentleman made a great
Stir among them; and the Arch-bishop
was much blamed, that he would never
make an End: But they were much trou∣bled
at it, as fearing themselves, that all
was not sure. <HI>But,</HI> quoth he, <HI>when I had
told them, that this was some ill Office of the
Bishop of</HI> Litchfield<HI>, who had every Day new
Inventions to puzzle them, that he might so much
the more indear himself unto them, by signify∣ing
his Zeal for them; and that I knew how
fairly my Lord of</HI> Canterbury <HI>had answer'd
him,</HI> (for so indeed he did) <HI>and that he was</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
<HI>so far from disturbing the Marriage, that he
intended to be present at it; they were not
only appeased, but seem'd much content, that
his Grace would be there: And this I assure
you to be true.</HI></P>
<P>When the Arch-bishop heard this, he
was now satisfy'd, that the Man who had
done him all the Wrong, was the Bishop of
<HI>Litchfield</HI>; from whom he resolv'd after∣ward
to be very wary how he trusted him.
Yet, professing that he forgave him with
all his Heart, on the <HI>Christmas-Day</HI> he at∣tended
the King, and receiv'd the Commu∣nion
with his Majesty; and so, coming
Home to Dinner, Sir <HI>Charles Cornwallis</HI>
came along with him. This Gentleman is
one, to whom, for his Love, the Arch-bishop
was much beholden; and after
Dinner they grew privately into Speech
of all these fore-remember'd Stirs; where
the Knight found much Fault that so ma∣ny
Tricks were put upon the Arch-bishop;
blam'd infinitely the Bishop of <HI>Litchfield</HI>;
promised to acquaint some of his great
Friends with his Qualities, and assured to
make, Things be rightly understood; and
took away with him that Report, wherein
he seemed much to joy, that the Arch-bi∣shop
would be at the Marriage.</P>
<P>On the Morrow, being St. <HI>Steven</HI>'s Day,
the Arch-bishop went to the Court, atten∣ded
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
the King to Chapel, went down to the
Marriage, (where, not the King, but the
Lord-Chamberlain, gave the Bride) had a
Pair of Wedding-Gloves, and so came
Home to Dinner, where he sate with
much Comfort, as being glad, that since
Things must be so, they were come to an
End: And so pray'd God to bless his
Church, the King, and Kingdom, and him∣self;
that he might be free from so many
Vexations, as for a long Space undeservedly
had follow'd him.</P>

<PB REF="102"/>
<HEAD>The SPEECH intended
to be spoken at <HI>Lambeth, Sep∣tember</HI>
25, 1613. by the
Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI>
when it came to his Turn, to
declare his Mind concerning
the Nullity of Marriage be∣tween
the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and
the Lady <HI>Frances Howard.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Seven of the Commissioners having before de∣clared
themselves that they would Sentence
for a Nullity, and great Reason being to
think, that the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> Sir <HI>John
Bennet,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>
would give Voices against the Nullity.]</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Lords, and you the rest
of the Commissioners, I
have had a great Contenti∣on
and Deliberation with∣in
my self, in what man∣ner
I should utter my Judg∣ment
in this present Cause,
<PB N="98" REF="103"/>
since, after the Speech of those Three
who first began, so great a Stream and Con∣currence
together of the rest, (my Lord
excepted, who spoke last) have given their
Opinions for the annulling of the Marriage.
But yet I hold not my self concluded thereby,
but that I may declare my Judgment, having
learned that <HI>Suffragia</HI> among Wisemen are as
well <HI>appendenda</HI> and <HI>ponderanda,</HI> as <HI>numeranda:</HI>
And it was no shame for <HI>Phocion</HI> in <HI>Athens,</HI>
upon good Ground, to contradict the whole
City; neither was <HI>Paphnusius,</HI> in the Coun∣cil
of <HI>Nice</HI> the less respected, when he
stood against the whole Synod; nay, it was
his Honour, that by delivering of his Sen∣tence,
he altered the Resolution which
that whole Assembly had intended to take,
which I freely acknowledge I have no hope
to affect at this Time. And yet, though I
have not that hope, but might very well
spare this labour, yet my Conscience tell∣eth
me, that it becometh me to speak in a
Matter of this importance, because, not
only, <HI>Deum timeo,</HI> I fear God, which I
doubt not but all of this Company doth;
but I am afraid of God, least he should be
angry with me if in this Case I be silent.
And I think it is expected of me, since I
am here present, that I should not sit as an
Idol, and only fill a room; for that were to
lay an Imputation on my self, that I had
undertaken a Cause, which in publick I
durst not offer to maintain.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="104"/>
I must acknowledge, that in delivering
of my Mind in this Business of so great
Weight, I do find two defects, that I can∣not
so pertinently speak unto the Purpose
as divers of the Judges here: The one is,
That I am no Lawyer; and the other is,
That I am no married Man; by both which
I am disabled, that I cannot speak with
that Confidence concerning some Particu∣lars,
as most of you, the Commissioners,
are able to do; but in lieu thereof, I have
endeavoured to furnish my self some other
way concurrent to this Purpose. As by
reading, by conferring with some whom I
do trust, with pondering thereupon, so that
it hath lost me much sleep at several Times,
with frequent Prayer unto God, that he
would direct me aright; which I have more
begged of God in this Cause, than ever in
any that was before me in Judgment. And
besides, I bring with me <HI>animum candidum,</HI>
a Mind devoid of Passion, or any Perturba∣tion,
which inclineth to no part for fear,
or for favour, for spleen or for hatred:
From which, I thank God, in pronouncing
of Sentence, I ever have been free, re∣membring
that Judges are in the Place of
God; and as <HI>Jehosophat</HI> said, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.
<HI>Non hominis judicia exercetis sed Domini, &amp;
quicquid judicaveritis in vos redundabit.</HI> He
then who sitteth in the Place of God, and
in pronouncing of Sentence will vary from
<PB N="100" REF="105"/>
Justice, he leaveth God, and sheweth him∣self
worthy to lye in the flames of Hell,
for abusing of the Trust which is commit∣ted
unto him, which I hope I shall not do.
And <HI>cui boni?</HI> to what end should I trans∣gress
in Judgment for either side, when I
have no reason to be partial for either, since
it is indifferent to me in any particular,
whether this Question receive one or other
determination.</P>
<P>Where least I should be mistaken, I
think it not amiss, as publickly I have done
divers Times before, to let the World
know what my Judgment is concerning the
Impotency of a Husband towards his Wife.
That since Marriage in young Couples is
for carnal Copulation and Procreation there∣upon,
and that it is the intendment of
those which contract Matrimony to receive
Satisfaction in that Kind, that if this No∣bleman
be not able to perform those mari∣tal
Rights unto his Lady, he doth unto her
a very great Injustice to retain her as his
Wife; and we shall perform a great part of
Injury and Cruelty towards her, if we do
not free her from this Burthen and Yoke.
We are bound in Conscience to do it, since
it is in truth no Marriage, but a pretended
Matrimony, that Consummation being
wanting which was one of the first Things
in Intention when they two came together:
For <HI>impossibilitas officii,</HI> by a received Maxim,
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
<HI>solvit vinculum Conjugij.</HI> But the Point is,
that before this Separation be pronounced,
it must appear unto the Church, that there
is good Cause for the same; which must not
be upon light Surmises, or questionable Sug∣gestions,
but upon evident Declarations and
Proofs, which may give full Contentment
to the Conscience of the Judge. The Mar∣riage
was overt and in the Face of the
Church, whereby they were joyned into
one; let the Reason of Separation be as
clear as that was, if it possibly may be; or
let it be so apparent, that the Church may
well know, that there is ground to stand
upon for pronouncing of a Nullity. Now
this is it which I doubt will not fall out in
this Case of my Lord of <HI>Essex</HI>; there is
not proof sufficient to inform the Minds
of the Judges that this knot should be dis∣solved,
and themselves set at liberty,
the one from the other. And then you
understand what the general Rule is,
<HI>Quod dubitas ne feceris.</HI> And in this Con∣troversy
there seems in my Judgment ma∣ny
Reasons of doubting, that the Separati∣on
desired ought not to be granted. You
shall hear some few of them.</P>
<P>1. The first Scruple which ariseth in my
Mind, is from the uncertainty of that Pro∣ceeding,
which we have had in this Busi∣siness.
For in the handling of it formerly,
we had it propounded, that there must be
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>
a Nullity <HI>propter maleficium versus hanc.</HI>
That was it which we debated, and for the
which we turned our Books; that the
Counsel for my Lady did still insist upon,
not naming the Words indeed, but by a Pe∣riphrasis,
or Circumlocution, describing the
same. And it cannot be forgotten, how
Dr. <HI>Stuard,</HI> being told by one, or more of
the Commissioners sitting then in Court,
that his whole Speech did still point out
<HI>maleficium,</HI> he answered, it is true, that is
it which we intend. The Authorities al∣ways
brought out of the Canonists were in
direct Terms upon <HI>maleficium,</HI> the Proofs
intended nothing else. And we all under∣stand,
that to have an Impotency unto a
Man's own Wife, and an Ability unto o∣ther,
and that incurably, and that for some
Latent Reason, which cannot be known, is
the Case of <HI>maleficium</HI>; and that is the mat∣ter
alledged in the Libel, and whereupon
my Lord is examined. And yet, now since
we sit upon the second Commission, <HI>male∣ficium</HI>
is disclaimed. One
of my Lords<NOTE PLACE="marg">My Lord of <HI>Winchester.</HI></NOTE> hath avowed
it, that he dislikes that
<HI>maleficium</HI>; that he hath
read <HI>Del-Rio,</HI> the Jesuit, writing upon
that Argument, and doth hold him an idle
and fabulous Fellow; that he rather suppo∣seth
it to be God's own handy Work, than
any Thing from the Devil. Another of
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>
my Lords<NOTE PLACE="marg">My Lord of <HI>Ely.</HI></NOTE> hath assented
thereunto, and <HI>maleficium</HI>
must be gone. Now I for
my part will not absolute∣ly
deny, that Witches by God's Permission
may have a Power over Men, to hurt all,
or part in them, as by God they shall be li∣mitted;
but how shall it appear that this
is such a Thing in the Person of a Man?
The Question is, <HI>An factum sit,</HI> and how
it shall be discovered. But to make it a
Thing ordinary, as the <HI>Romish</HI> Writers do
beyond the Seas, I take it to be a Fable,
acknowledging that for Truth, which a Bi∣shop
well versed in that Argument did late∣ly
write, that Maleficiation is the very gar∣bage
of Popery; a Thing so base, that we
who have learned Christ aright, should de∣spise
and contemn, allowing it no place a∣mongst
us. Which Course it were a shame
if we should not observe, since the Papists
themselves grow very weary of it; and
that even in <HI>France,</HI> where there hath been
more ado with this Maleficiation than in
any other Country; for there the common
Sort at the Time of their Marriages, were
wont to be afraid to have the Words of Con∣junction
in Matrimony to be spoken aloud,
<HI>Quos Deus conjunxit nemo separet,</HI> or the Be∣nediction
to be publickly given, lest some
Witch or Sorcerer in the same Instant
should tye a knot upon a Point, or play
<PB N="104" REF="109"/>
some other sorcering Trick, whereby the
new Bridegroom so long as that knot lasted,
should be disabled from actual Copulation
with her whom he had married. And for
avoiding of that hazard, they had there∣fore
their Matrimonies celebrated in the
Night Time, and in some private Place,
where none came but such Friends as they
dared to trust. This Superstition grew so
common, and Men were so abused by the
fright that came thereof, that the Prelates
of <HI>France,</HI> about Thirty Years since, in a
Council at <HI>Rheimes,</HI> made this Decree a∣gainst
it. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bochellus</HI> in De∣cret. Eccles. Gal∣lic. <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>tit.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 176. <HI>Anno</HI> 1583.</NOTE><HI>Peccare graviter

Rag of Popery. And yet I do now find,
that in the very Sentence which is this Day
to be given, it falleth directly upon the De∣scription
of <HI>maleficium versus hanc.</HI> So that
what should I think of this Case of my
Lords, which is built on such a Foundation
as no Man will stand to? We are on it, and
off it, and avow it we dare not, yet fly
from it we will not. This moveth Scruple
in me, how I should assent to that whereof
I can learn no certainty from the Council of
my Lady, nor from you that be the Judges,
who speak for this Nullity: I dare not rest
my Building on such a sandy Foundation.</P>
<P>2. Another Matter which troubleth my
Mind, is the Novelty of that which is now
set on Foot; a Thing unheard of in our
Church, and unknown in our Kingdom.
We have many Stories, Old and New, of
Things done in this Land; we have Regi∣sters
extant in every Diocese; we have Acts
and Records which specify those Accidents
<PB N="106" REF="111"/>
which have fallen out in the Days of our
Fore-fathers. I have caused search in ma∣ny
Places to be made, and so I know have
some of you, the Commissioners; and I
have called upon you for the same, but I
can have no Precedent of any such Exam∣ple
that hath passed in our Kingdom. No
Memory of Man can express unto me the
Name of that Person, whose Marriage was
annull'd for Impotency towards his Wife,
when he found an Ability of carnal Copu∣lation
with any other Woman. It is this
Year, 1613. that hath set Abroad this pre∣sent
Imagination, for the former Ages
knew it not. It is safe walking in the Ways
which are treaded out unto us. We have
great Reason for our doings in these Human
Actions, when we do those Deeds which
formerly were done by our Predecessors. I
have had many worthy Men, which have
gone before me in the Place which I now
hold, Men learned, Men judicious, great
discoverers of Impostures; Men that have
done great Services for the Nation where we
live; but of them never any had such a
Case before them, they never gave Sen∣tence
for a Nullity of Marriage upon such
an inability. I know not whether it be a
happiness or unhappiness, that I must be
the first to sit in a Commission for determi∣ning
such a Controversy.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="112"/>
I know to meet with this Objection, it is
whispered sometimes, that there is an Ex∣ample,
and that is <HI>Bury</HI>'s Case, which is
urged as a Precedent unto this now in Que∣stion.
But indeed, that is no Pattern of this,
the dissimilitude is great between the one
Case and the other, for <HI>Bury</HI> had his Stones
stricken off with an Horse, that nothing
but a little part of one of them remained.
I will read you the very Case, which if any
Man doubt of, shall be avowed unto him.
Thus then it doth follow.</P>
<P><HI>John Bury,</HI> Esquire, was lawfully seised
in his Demeanes as of Fee, of, and in di∣vers
Mannors, Lands and Tenements, with∣in
the County of <HI>Devon.</HI> The said <HI>John
Bury,</HI> did the 20th Day of <HI>November,</HI> in
the first Year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> marry one
<HI>Willimot Gifford,</HI> and they lived together
Three Years; and the said <HI>Bury</HI> could not
<HI>carnaliter cognoscere dictam Willimotam.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, <HI>viz.</HI> the 17th of <HI>May</HI> 1561,
the said <HI>Willimot</HI> called the said <HI>Bury</HI> before
the Ecclesiastical Judge, and charged him
to be <HI>impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta</HI> Wil∣limota,
<HI>propter vitium perpetuum, &amp; incura∣bile
impedimentum ad generationem, &amp; ejus
inhabilitatem,</HI> &amp;c. and thereupon desired
to be divorced, In the Proceeding before
the Judge, it was proved by divers Witnes∣ses,
of which two were Physicians, that
the said <HI>Bury</HI> had but one little Stone, and
<PB N="108" REF="113"/>
that no bigger than a Bean. It was also
deposed by divers Matrons, that the said
<HI>Willimot Gifford</HI> remained a Virgin, and
incorrupt; and the said <HI>Bury</HI> confessed no
less: Upon which Proof, and Confession
of <HI>John Bury,</HI> the Ecclesiastical Judge pro∣nounced
Sentence of Divorce, and did
thereby separate them.</P>
<P>Afterward the said <HI>John Bury</HI> took to
Wife one <HI>Philip Monjoy,</HI> his first Wife,
<HI>Willimot Gifford,</HI> being then alive; and the
said <HI>Philip</HI> had a Son in the Time of their
continuing together, <HI>John Bury</HI>'s first Wife
being alive.</P>
<P>Afterwards, the said <HI>Willimot</HI> being still
living, the said <HI>Monjoy,</HI> of her own ac∣cord,
without any Sentence of Divorce,
forsook the said <HI>John Bury,</HI> and married one
<HI>Langeden,</HI> with whom she continued. The
said <HI>John Bury,</HI> and his first Wife <HI>Willimot</HI>
died, the said <HI>Monjoy</HI> and <HI>Langeden</HI> then li∣ving,
married together.</P>
<P>The Question is, Whether <HI>John Bury,</HI>
being divorced from <HI>Willimot Gifford</HI> for
Impotency, the second Marriage, solemni∣zed
between the said <HI>John Bury,</HI> and <HI>Mon∣joy,</HI>
during which Time the Issue Male was
born, be in Law a Marriage or not.</P>
<P>It appeareth by the Process made in the
Cause, and the Words of the Sentence
grounded upon the same Process, that the
first Marriage was pronounced to be void,
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>
<HI>Propter defectum &amp; vitium testiculorum,</HI>
which made the said <HI>John Bury, impoten∣tem
&amp; ineptum ad actum generandi, &amp;
coitum conjugalem.</HI> And so in all Respects,
this second Marriage with <HI>Monjoy</HI> is void,
and of no effect: For either this Cause of
the Dissolution of the first Matrimony is
true, which is always to be presumed, un∣til
the contrary do appear, and then the
same Cause doth make the second Mar∣riage
void also; or else, if it any ways ap∣pear,
this Cause of the Dissolution of the
first Marriage to be false; <HI>Et Ecclesia erat
decepta, quia satis potens ad generandum, &amp;
quod in ipsa generavit.</HI> And in that Case the
first Marriage is good, in Law, <HI>&amp; debet re∣dire
ad priora connubia:</HI> And so the second
Marriage is utterly void.</P>
<P>We are of the Opinion above laid
down.</P>

<P>Whether this be true or no, I appeal to
Dr. <HI>Stuard,</HI> who is here in Presence, and
of Counsel for my Lady, who, I know,
will affirm it, because, not long since, be∣ing
asked by me of it, he confessed the
same. And here is Dr. <HI>Farrand</HI> now of
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>
Counsel for my Lord, who was used—for
his Advice in this Case of <HI>Bury</HI>; and Dr.
<HI>Hone</HI> is yet living, who can testify the
same. For I will suppose, that a Man can∣not
forget such a famous Case as that was,
wherein himself was employ'd; but if all
these were dead, I know where Records,
be, which still will continue. If this then
were the Matter in Question touching <HI>Bury,</HI>
<HI>defectus testiculorum,</HI> what is this to the
great Controversy now depending before
us? And if this be the only Precedent, that
should be the Inducement, that the Sen∣tence
to be given in this Cause is not new,
but the like hath been heard of before; I
am where I was: We are now to act a No∣velty,
a thing strange, and unheard of in
this Church of <HI>England,</HI> whereof let other
Men be the Managers, I may have no
hand in it.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be said, that in some
other Countries, and especially in <HI>France,</HI>
these things are well known, and the Ex∣amples
of one Kingdom, especially being
so near unto us, may be an Inducement for
us to do the like, since the Reason is the
same. My Answer thereunto is, That I
that live in <HI>England,</HI> am to frame my self
to those things, which I find in the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> whereof I see no reason, but
there should be as great Esteem, as of any
Church in the World. In the Days of our
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
Fore-fathers, as our Nation was held a ve∣ry
noble Nation, so was the Church of
<HI>England</HI> held a very famous Church. <HI>Eccle∣sia
Anglicana,</HI> as might easily be shewed
out of <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> and by divers things
in some later general Councils, did carry
a greater Sway. And why should we at
this time, in any thing, yield unto any
Church in the World, since it is a thing
well known, that the Knowledge of Divi∣nity
doth abound here, beyond all other
Nations? and Men of this Land have beat
down the Power of the Pope, and made e∣vident
divers Quesions in Matters of The∣ology,
beyond all the Parts of Christen∣dom!
But beyond this, I do know, that
the Customs of Churches, even by the De∣termination
of the Pope himself, ought to
be the Rule of Judgment in this Nature.
We have a famous Place interserted into
the Body of the Law, written by Pope <HI>A∣lexander</HI>
the 3d. unto the Bishop of <HI>Amiens</HI>
in <HI>France.</HI> It is worth your hearing; <NOTE PLACE="marg">De frigidis &amp; maleficiatis, cap. 2. in Supple∣mento.</NOTE><HI>Quod
sedem Apostolicam consuluisti
super his, quae tibi dubia ex∣istunt,
gratum gerimus &amp;
acceptum, &amp; tua exinde fra∣ternitas
non parum commen∣danda
videtur. Ex tua siquidem parte
nobis est intimatum, quod quaedam mulier,
tui Episcopatus cuidamviro nupserit, asserens
quod os utrius{que} inguinis rupturam, genitalia</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="117"/><HI>ejus abscissa fuissent, nec dum ab eo cognito fu∣isset,
qui uti{que} factus leprosus, se pariter &amp;
sua domui reddidit infirmorum. Mulier vero
ad domum patris reversa sicut asseris invenis,
alii viro nubere desiderat, &amp; conjugali affectu
conjungi. Ʋnde licet Romana Ecclesia non
consueverit propter talem infirmitatem, vel
propter alia maleficia legitimè conjunctos divi∣dere,
si tamen consuetudo generalis Gallicanae
Ecclesiae habet, ut hujusmodi matrimonium
dissolvatur; nos patienter tolerabimus, si secun∣dum
eandem consuetudinem, eidem mulieri cui
voluerit nubendi in Domino concesseris faculta∣tem.</HI>
By this we do find, that the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> it self doth grant no Separations in
Matters of Matrimony, where the Church
of <HI>France</HI> doth; and if the Pope permit in
<HI>France</HI> it self, that a Divorce should be
made, it is but a Toleration, and not this
neither, but where it is <HI>consuetudo generalis
Ecclesiae Gallicanae</HI>; which if you will apply
unto this Cause in Question, you must shew
me, that in <HI>England</HI> it hath been a general
Custom, that a Nullity in Marriage
may be pronounced <HI>propter impotentiam
versus hanc</HI>; which if you cannot shew,
as indeed you cannot, nor give any true
Example, that ever hath been of any such
Separation within this Church; I may both
in Law and Conscience conclude, that I
dare not introduce any Novelty, and so
consequently pronounce for the Nullity of
<PB N="113" REF="118"/>
this Marriage. Many things are done in
<HI>France,</HI> whereof if we in <HI>England</HI> had the
Examination, we should peradventure find
the Fact different from that which they
conceiv'd; or if we agree in the Fact, we
should give another Sentence. It is not
unknown how, within the Space of one
Year, there hath been much a-do in <HI>France,</HI>
about two Women, <HI>Magdalen</HI> and <HI>Louyse,</HI>
pretended to be possessed with a great ma∣ny
Devils, and how <HI>Verrine,</HI> a principal Spi∣rit
in one of them, hath avowed and main∣tained
the Mass, Invocation of Saints, Ado∣ration
of Images, and a great many other
Points of the Grossness of Popery; and a
Book hereof hath been printed and reprint∣ed
in <HI>Paris,</HI> with Approbation of the State,
and Allowance of learned Men; in which
the Church of <HI>England</HI> would certainly
dissent, and proclaim the whole Business to
be but an Imposture; as the very like was
in the Days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when the
Devils of <HI>Denham</HI> were said to possess
<HI>Sarah Williams</HI> and her Sister, and some o∣ther
Persons; and much a-do was made of
it, and divers fond People believing
those Knacks, turn'd Papists thereupon;
yet the Issue of all was, that it proved no
better than a shameful Delusion, and a
great abusing of credulous and light-belie∣ving
Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="119"/>
3. But now to proceed farther; if it shall
be said, It is not the Novelty, nor the
Want of Custom here in <HI>England,</HI> which
should prejudice the Truth; <HI>valeat veritas,</HI>
wheresoever or whensoever it appears:
The Proofs are evident whereupon we do
stand, and that will enforce the Sentence.
My Answer thereunto is, let that be made
manifest, and clear and perspicuous, unto
the Conscience of an understanding Man,
and I shall concur with you; but how shall
I find this in a Matter of this Quality?
Because it is nothing else but Truth which
we do aim at, it were fit that all Probati∣ons,
if not which are possibly, yet at the
least which reasonably may be had, should
be got together to enforce a Conclusion of
this Consequence. My Books tell me, <HI>In
valore matrimonii investigando quaecun{que} pro∣bationes
possibiles adhibendae sunt, &amp; potius de∣bent
esse superfluae quàm diminutae.</HI>
It is <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 25.</NOTE> <HI>It is the
Honour of a King to find out a
thing.</HI> And wherein can Judges bestow
their Time better in a Point of Difficulty,
than to search and search again, by all ho∣nest
and good Means, to know what is the
Bottom of that which lieth secret, that so
they may satisfy their own Conscience, and
the Conscience of others, in the Sentence
which they give, and leave no kind of
Scruple, which may trouble their own
<PB N="115" REF="120"/>
Thoughts? Whether these things have
been done in this present Case, I appeal to
your own Consciences; whether the Wri∣ters
do not mention divers things; whether
the Council for my Lord have not spoke
of sundry Matters; whether we that be the
Judges, have not thought of divers Cour∣ses
convenient to be held; of all which, no
Piece or Parcel hath been permitted unto
us. The Proofs then which we have had,
do arise only out of the Depositions, and if
there be not Proof sufficient, where shall
we seek for it? Let us then consider them.
I will tell you my Opinion of them. I find
nothing in them all, which is not in Sub∣stance
contained in the Answers of my
Lord of <HI>Essex</HI>; a noble Personage saith,
that in the hearing of divers things, the
Earl hath said, that he was not able to
know his Lady carnally; the Earl think∣ing
this to be true. But this is but a Rela∣tion
of Wonder spoken extrajudicially;
and therefore for the understanding of the
Truth therein, we are to have Recourse
unto that, which by the said Earl is judi∣cially
deposed. Divers Witnesses do speak,
that the Earl and the Lady have lived and
lain together for divers Years, my Lord
doth acknowledge it in his Answer; the
Matrons and Mid-wives do declare, that
in their Judgment, my Lady is a Virgin,
and therefore that she was never known
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>
carnally by the Earl; himself confesseth
that he did never know her. So that now,
all in Substance depending upon his Lord∣ship's
Answer, it ought to be our Labour
to scan that exactly, and to judge of it
circumspectly. Doth not he then say, <HI>in
responsione ad quartum</HI>; that tho' divers
times, in the first Year of their Cohabita∣tion,
he did attempt to know her (which
divers times may be twice or thrice, and
no more) yet in the two latter Years, he did
never attempt it? But doth he not say plain∣ly,
<HI>in responsione ad tertium</HI>; that since the
time of his Marriage, he had not, nor
hath any Sickness or Impediment, to hin∣der
him, but that he might have had, and
may have carnal Knowledge with a Wo∣man.
This is for the General, that he
hath no Impediment; but <HI>in responsione ad
quintuni,</HI> doth he not descend more parti∣cularly
unto his own Lady; that it is true
that he did never carnally know the said
Lady <HI>Frances?</HI> Mark now what followeth;
but that to the Act of carnal Copulation,
he did not find any Defect in himself. In∣deed
he was not able to penetrate into her
Body; but he layeth the Faults of that up∣on
her, as may be seen in his Answer unto
the 7th Article. And it may not be forgot∣ten,
that in the End of the Answer to the
4th Article, he saith, that sometimes she
refused him; these things are evident, and
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>
cannot be denied. The only Matter which
maketh shew against this, is, that he ac∣knowledgeth
that he hath lain by her, and
hath had no Motion to have carnal Know∣ledge
of her; but especially, that in the
End of his Answer unto the 6th Article;
and believeth he never shall. These Words
are the Shield and Buckler of the contra∣ry
part; but how easily do they vanish a∣way,
or fall to the Ground! For I appeal
unto you all, who were present at the Ex∣aminations
(and those were ten of us in
Number, who now sit here present) whe∣ther
the Earl did not openly subjoin that
to his Answer; <HI>When I came out of</HI> France,
<HI>I did love her, but I do not so now, nei∣ther
ever shall I.</HI> I appeal unto the Con∣science
of you all, except my Lord of
<HI>Winton,</HI> and my Lord of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who
were not then Commissioners, whether
this be so or no; here then is the Matter,
it is the Want of Love, which restraineth all
Motions of carnal Concupiscence, and not
any Impotency; it is <HI>defectus voluntatis,</HI> and
not <HI>defectus potestatis.</HI> Let Discontentment
be removed, and there will be an End of
all the Inability: Married Men best
know these things; but out of common
Reason, there can be no great Longing,
where there is no great Liking; many
things they say fall out between Man and
Wife, that for some good Space of time,
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
there is no carnal Conjunction, and yet no
Impotency concluded thereby may be. The
Case is famous of <HI>Pulcheria,</HI> Sister unto the
Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> the younger, who having
vowed Virginity, was notwithstanding af∣terward,
for great Reason of State, thought
fit to be marry'd unto <HI>Martianus,</HI> who
thereupon was chosen Emperor; she would
not condescend thereunto, till she had Pro∣mise
from him, that her Virginity should
be preserved, and with such a Promise he
did marry her, so that they lived toge∣ther
in Shew as Man and Wife; but indeed
as a Brother and a Sister. Our Stories do
make mention, that he who was called Saint
<HI>Edward</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> I mean King <HI>Edward</HI>
the Confessor, did marry a Lady, the
Knowledge of whose Body he never had,
neither did this wedded Couple ever en∣deavour
to break their Virginity. The
Writers do declare no other Reason hereof,
but that they had an Opinion, that to live
in Virginity, was the more meritorious, ac∣cording
to the Superstition of those times.
Now were it not a strange Argument, to
conclude in this manner, that because <HI>Mar∣tianus</HI>
had not conjugal Copulation with
<HI>Pulcheria,</HI> therefore he was a Man impo∣tent;
or, because King <HI>Edward</HI> had not
carnal Knowledge of his Wife, therefore
he could not know her. I know the Cir∣cumstances
of this present Question do
<PB N="119" REF="124"/>
differ from those, but the Ground of the
Argument is the same. Want of Act up∣on
private Reason, will never enforce a
Want of Power. And this is our Case, as
I understand it, which maketh me unwil∣ling
to consent to this Nullity.</P>
<P>4. There followeth now another Argu∣ment,
which I shall deliver briefly. We
have always agreed, that the Chapter in
the Law, which containeth our Case, is
the Chapter <HI>Litera de frigidis &amp; malefici∣atis</HI>;
for if it be not there, it is no where
to be found. When we have deliver'd ma∣ny
things appertaining to this Cause out
of the best Writers of the former Ages, or
of our own time, as that my Lord should
be inspected, or that Physicians should use
their Art to discern and remove Impoten∣cy,
if any were to be found, or that Fast∣ing,
Prayer, and Alms should be exerci∣sed
to over-come this Evil, and divers other
Points of like Nature; it hath still been
answered to us, to say the Interpreters,
but it is not in the Law; or it is in the De∣crees
which bind not, but it is not in the
Decretals; or it is a Council and Exhorta∣tion;
but it is no Mandate or Injunction.
I now therefore mention some things, which
is in the Law, and in the very Body of this
Law, and it is the Pope's Mandate; and
that is, that my Lord should have given
his <HI>juramentum cum septima manu,</HI> as well as
<PB N="120" REF="125"/>
my Lady; for Want whereof, the whole
Proceeding is annullated. This is the
Pope's Commandment, <HI>Quocirca manda∣mus,</HI>
and it requireth the Oath of both, <HI>ip∣sis
cum septima propinquorum manu firmanti∣bus
juramento, se commisceri carnaliter ne∣quivisse,</HI>
then <HI>proferatis divortii sententiam
inter eos.</HI> This is a thing so clear, that
when on <HI>Thursday</HI> last, by chance, there
fell mention of it; the Coun∣cil
for my Lady<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. Stuard, Dr. Byrde.</NOTE> were so far
from giving Answer to it, that
to speak plainly, they stood as
Men blasted or blighted with a Lightning,
and knew not which way to turn them; as
was manifest not only unto us, but to all
the Standers by; which I do not utter to
do them any wrong, for they are worthy
Men, both learned and faithful to the Cause
which they undertake; but the Note is,
that this Objection can receive no true An∣swer.
I know, that since that time, there
hath been Labour made, to give a Salve to
this Sore, but no Man's Wit can do it. I
said, and say still, that no Man's Loquence,
neither any Man's Eloquence, can perswade
me, that <HI>ipsis firmantibus juramento</HI> is of the
singular Number. I know there hath been
tumbling and turning of Books, to find
some Shew to meet with this Objection,
but nothing can be found, which will hold
out this Water. The Proceeding there∣fore
<PB N="121" REF="126"/>
doth appear to be unperfect and de∣fective
in that, which is mainly required by
the Law, which makes me to conclude in
this fashion against some unperfect Speech
touching my Lord of <HI>Essex</HI>; his affirming
or denying of his own Inability towards my
Lady; that either he doth confess it or de∣ny
it: If he do acknowledge it, where is then
his Oath <HI>cum septima Manu,</HI> which the Law
imposeth? If he do deny it, where is then
your Proof of his Inability, since you
ground the whole Substance of the Nullity
upon his Lordship's Answer, <HI>That he could
not know her carnally.</HI></P>
<P>I must yet crave Patience to go a little far∣ther.
One other Exception which I take unto
this Nullity, is the manner of the Sentence,
which by us is to be given, which hath ever
been resolved should be in general, not ex∣pressing
any Reason particular wherefore
we do give it. To say that my Lord is <HI>im∣potens
in genere versus hanc,</HI> and not to tell
wherein, is to propound a Riddle to the
World, which no Man understandeth. It
were a strange Thing in Learning, to say,
that such a Creature is Animal, and not to
tell whither it be a Man, or a Horse, or a
Fish, or a Bird. And although it hath been
said, and strongly main∣tain'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Daniel Dun.</NOTE>
<HI>That it is enough in
a Sentence to pronounce a
Thing in general, and that</HI><PB N="122" REF="127"/>
<HI>the Judge is bound to give no Reason of it</HI>;
yet I would be glad to know whether, how∣soever
I will conceal the particular Reason
from the Hearers or Standers by, yet were it
not fit, that I who am the Judge, and must
give the Sentence, or at least consent unto
it, should know the Ground whereupon I
do give it. Give me leave to speak my
Conscience, I think such a Sentence, that
<HI>propter latens aliquod impedimentum,</HI> which is
<HI>perpetuum &amp; incurabile versus hanc,</HI> is nothing
but a device to serve a present Turn, which
we must deliver in such obscure Words, to
blind Posterity that comes after, and to a∣muse
those which will inquire into it, as if
we had known something which we held
not fit to utter, when in Truth we know
nothing. I find the Texts of the Law do
still set down the Reason, and give a Case
particular, as Frigidity, or Section, or un∣fitness
of the generative Part, or some such
other Matter; but for an Inability, <HI>propter
latens impedimentum,</HI> my dulness is such,
that in the whole Book I cannot discover it:
And it is a Mystery that cannot enter into
me, how a Man should be potent unto
other Women, and impotent to his Wife,
if it be not in Case of Phrensy, which is not
<HI>latens impedimentum,</HI> and which also find∣eth
<HI>lucida intervalla.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. Litterae.</NOTE> It
was the Assertion of him
in the Law, <HI>That he did not</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="128"/>
<HI>know his Wife, but that he had a Power to know
other Women.</HI> But what wise Man doth be∣lieve
him? Or what is there in the Text
which doth declare it to be true? I will end
this Point with that of our Saviour in the
29th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> That there are three
Sorts of Eunuchs, or Men unfit to mar∣ry;
the one is of God's making, the se∣cond
is of Mens making, and the third is
of their own making. The first are they
that are past from their Mother's Belly, who
either are <HI>frigidi,</HI> or such as have not Mem∣bers
fit for Generation, or some apparent
Debility. The second are those who are
castrated by Men, or by some violence have
that hindred in them, whereunto by Nature
they are fit in respect of Procreation. I will
not here dispute that idle <HI>Maleficium,</HI> be∣cause
your selves are flown from it. The
third hath no coherence with this Noble∣man.
Let me know then, in which of the
former two you do place it. Is he past
from his Mother's Womb? why then do
you give him leave to marry again? that
he who hath deluded and frustrated one,
may also delude another. If he be in the
second Rank, why do you not tell us what
the Violence is which he hath sustained
from Men, or from any other Creature.
Let us have, I pray you, some kind of Sa∣tisfaction,
and let not this Aenigma in gene∣ral
blind us, least the World should say,
<PB N="124" REF="129"/>
that wilfully we shut our Eyes against the
Truth.</P>
<P>6. One Reason I have more, why I yield not
to this Nullity, and then I have done. It is
drawn from the Inconveniencies which will
follow thereupon, if we dissolve the Matri∣mony
in such Case as is now desired. I
look first on the detriment and harm which
will follow, if the Marriage do continue in
force, and in vigour, and I do find, that all
the inconvenience doth redound but to one
Person. Between a Lady and her Husband
there is some discontentment, which Time
and God's Grace may easily remove: There
is then an end of that Controversie. Or if
the disagreement shall never be appeased,
it is no more but one Lady doth want that
Solace which marital Conjunction would
afford unto her; which many a good Wo∣man
is enforced to endure, and yet com∣mits
no Sin, neither labours to violate the
Laws of the Church: For suppose the
Husband be sick of some long Disease, or
languishing Weakness, must not the Wife
sustain it with patience and quietness? Sup∣pose
the Husband be Captive in some For∣reign
Nation, or Prisoner in his own Coun∣try,
whereby occasion of marital Comple∣xion
is taken from the Wife, no Divine
will pronounce, that a Separation is in this
Case to be sought. Let a Woman do that
in Modesty which others are inforced to do
<PB N="125" REF="130"/>
out of Necessity; and let her expect God's
leisure, in Fasting and in Prayer, and in o∣ther
Humiliation. This is all the Inconve∣nience
which ariseth to one Person, if she
have not the Performance of conjugal Duty.</P>
<P>But look on the other side, what are the
Incongruities, or rather Absurdities which
will easily follow, if such Dissolutions of
Marriages be permitted. I will name only
two. The first is the hazard of violating
and annulling of Marriage by an ordinary
Practice; for if the Gap be open, who will
not run in: And the Judge must dispense
the Law indifferently to all, if the Proofs
be accordingly; for we may not say, that
it is for noble Personages, and great Peers
in the State, and not for others of inferiour
Rank. Whatsoever Couple therefore have no
Children, and live discontented, come pre∣sently
to take part of this general Jubilee:
And, albeit they know in their Consciences,
that it which they attempt is unlawful; yet
to satisfy their Fancy, they will collude the
one with the other, and enter a Prosecuti∣on
secretly agreed upon, howsoever in o∣pen
shew they seem to differ the one from
the other: And who can doubt, but for
Money or Favour, they may procure Wit∣nesses,
and others who are to be used by
the formality of the Law, to testify and
depose so much as serves the Turn. By
which means we are at a fair pass, when
<PB N="126" REF="131"/>
not only the Marriage Bed shall be defiled,
and Adulteries made frequent, which is a∣gainst
the second Table of the Law, but
Perjury shall be committed, and God's
Name taken in vain, which is repugnant
unto the first Table.</P>
<P>A second Inconvenience is the Danger,
least both Parties which are freed from
their Matrimony, should divers Years after
be returned to it again, when perhaps the
Husband by a second Wife hath Children,
and the Wife by a second Husband hath
store of Issue also; for there is no doubt in
the Law, but if a Man supposed to be <HI>frigi∣dus,</HI>
and therefore divorced, shall after∣wards
Marry, and by begetting of Children
shew himself not to be impotent, but apt
for Generation, this Man is to be taken
from his second Woman, and returned to
his first Wife, and the Woman for whose
Marriage a Nullity was pronounced in re∣spect
of the Insufficiency of her Mate, must
be now taken from her second Companion,
and returned to the first. Of this the Rea∣son
is apparent, <HI>quia decepta est Ecclesia,</HI>
they adjudged him to be impotent upon
wrong Information, whom Experience and
Truth hath declared to be potent. And
what Man can foretel, how variety of Times
may produce other Judgments. There may
be Question of Land or Inheritance, of Le∣gitimation
or Illegitimation; and a wise
<PB N="127" REF="132"/>
Man would be unwilling to bring it on the
Stage when he is dead and gone, and to
make it the Fable of the World, whether
his Children be born lawfully, or to be re∣puted
in the Rank of Bastards. The World
is subject to much mutability, and Judges
of future Times may peradventure be led
with the Power of some great Persons, and
perhaps may think upon other Considerati∣ons;
that it is but a Conceit, that a Man
should be potent unto another Woman, and
impotent to his Wife; or that the Common
Law doth not know any <HI>Maleficium,</HI> or that
they do not believe, that there may be <HI>la∣tens
impedimentum perpetuum,</HI> and <HI>incurabile
versus hanc,</HI> when they see that the Hus∣band
is in shew of the World, a lusty, able
Man, and hath well proved his Potency,
by begetting Three or Five, or Seven, or
Ten Children upon another Woman. These
are pretty Things, if a Man do well consi∣der
them, and will serve to make distracti∣on
between Kinsman and Kinsman, and
make work for the Lawyers, and keep the
Courts at <HI>Westminster</HI> that they shall not be
idle; which if we could not learn other∣wise,
yet <HI>Bury</HI>'s Case before remember'd
doth teach us, who was divorced from his
Wife in the 3d or 4th Year of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI>
and when his Brother had enjoyed
his Land until the 40th Year of the said
Queen, then was he thrust out of it, and
<PB N="128" REF="133"/>
the question'd Son, or his Heir, was put
into Possession of it by Trial of Law; a
great deal of Money being spent in that
Contention, and both Civilians and com∣mon
Lawyers in great Numbers were en∣tertain'd
of both Sides; and yet the Con∣troversy
was not so appeased, but that of
my certain Knowledge, within these three
Years it had been raised again, and a strong
device was laid how to bring this about a∣gain;
only my self withstood it, and would
not give way unto it, when I was divers
Times consulted thereabout; conceiving
very well, that it would not be long before
some Prohibition would come out of some
of the King's Courts, because the common
Law disliked, that Mens Inheritance, espe∣cially
after Judgments, should be disturb∣ed,
when the Parties whom most of all it
concerned, are dead long before, and can∣not
answer for themselves; whereas, per∣adventure,
if themselves had been living,
they could have answered that for them∣selves
which other Men know not. And
there ought to be a settled Course in all
Things appertaining to Inheritance.</P>
<P>By this Time, I hope you see, that it is
not out of willfulness, or prejudicate Con∣ceit,
that I have impugned this Nullity,
but out of ground of Reason, and out of
scruple of Conscience, which is it that must
accuse me, or excuse me, before the ever∣living
<PB N="129" REF="134"/>
God. I know you have heard what
other Men have said, and they have an∣swered
for themselves. Upon all which
Grounds I make this Conclusion, That
howsoever this Matter of Separation with
great earnestness hath been persued, yet
it is the surer and the safer way to leave it
as we find it, and in no Case to dissolve it.
I oft remember that Saying, which is fre∣quent
among the Canonists; <HI>Tolerabilius est
aliquos contra statuta hominum dimittere copu∣latos,
quam conjunctos legitimè contra statuta
Domini separare.</HI> That concerneth us who
be the Judges, and for the Parties them∣selves,
who perhaps can be content to be
severed, and to Marry elsewhere, let them
know this from me, that they may best
expect a Blessing from God when they live
in that State where fewest scruples shall a∣rise
in their Mind: From which, whether
they shall be free in leaving their old Con∣junction,
and betaking themselves unto a
new, I refer to their wiser Thoughts, when
in all probability, if any cross or thwart
shall arise in their new intended Matrimo∣ny,
this perplexity and anguish will still
follow their Souls, that they have done
that, whereof in their truest Meditations
they have no ground of Conscience, and
therefore that it is the Hand of God upon
them, who giveth not a Blessing unto that
which was unduly sought.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135"/>
You have thus at large heard my Opini∣on
against the annullation of this Marriage.
Now, if you ask me, what would you then
have done concerning this Couple of noble
Personages: my Answer is, that I would have
a Reconciliation by all means to be labour∣ed;
and although that be difficult to bring
about, yet it is the more Honour when it is
effected. Charity will forgive, and forget
the highest Offences. It is St. <HI>Augustine</HI>'s
Judgment, <HI>That in the greatest Breaches be∣tween
Man and Wife, Reconciliation is the
best; and the worthiest Pains that can be be∣stow'd,
is to bring that about.</HI> There want∣eth
only one or more good Mediators, and
then great Things will be compassed. The
disagreement was inconceivable between
God and Man, yet Christ, that great Me∣diator,
did take it away. The Breach was
very bitter between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> yet
our most blessed Soveraign, as a gracious
Intercessor, did give an end unto it. Let
Divines be used now, as much as Lawyers
have been used heretofore. Take the god∣ly
Counsel of the one, which will be given
freely, as you have taken the Advice of the
other with much expence of Money. This
I wish for, this I pray for, and if my Coun∣sel
had been used, before Things grew to
this height, I would have used my best
means to have wrought an Atonement.
But because there is no hope thereof, and
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>
this doth expect a legal Decision, proceed
you that please unto this Separation. Give
your Sentence in <HI>scriptis,</HI> as you have de∣clared
your Opinion in <HI>verbis.</HI> Five might
have served the turn by the Words of the
Commission, if seven had dissented, but
you have seven Suffrages, and therefore
proceed; only this I crave of the Register,
that he do make his Act, that this Sentence
is given, <HI>Joanne Episcopo</HI> London, D. <HI>Joanne
Bennet milite,</HI> D. <HI>Francisco James,</HI> D.

<P>This is the Substance of that Matter,
which the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> out of
certain Notes which he had drawn up, was
ready to have uttered, and no one material
Point is added thereunto, as appeareth unto
me, the Writer hereof, comparing it with

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER I had received, and read
your Papers, which the Bishop
of <HI>Litchfield</HI> brought me, I found
it very necessary that I should
make answer thereunto at my first lei∣sure;
for whereas, before, at my last meet∣ing
with you, ye seemed to me to be only
as yet unresolved what Sentence to give in
this Business till you had heard it throughly
disputed, that by that means ye might be
fully informed of the State of the Cause:
it appears now by these Papers, that you
have, after your last Days consultation, put
on a negative Resolution, grounded upon
Fundaments of Divinity and Conscience,
as you think, which hath mov'd me to send
you herewith my Judgment upon your Ar∣guments,
in regard that I did ever hold it
necessary that in a Matter of this Weight
all my Commissioners should be as near of
one Mind, as might be, and therefore I
would be sorry that your private Conceits
<PB N="133" REF="138"/>
should so blind your Judgment, as to make
you and your Followers draw the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perplex or torment.</NOTE> Cathar∣rows
against your Yoke-fellows; for, that I
may now open plainly my Heart unto you,
at my first reading of your Papers from the
Bishop, I chance to cast mine Eye first up∣on
the Paper of your Arguments before I
had looked upon your Letter, and lighting
upon your first Words, <HI>In as much as we do
firmly believe,</HI> &amp;c. I protest I thought it had
been some strange Confession of Faith, that
you had intercepted amongst some of the
Sectaries; but when I had read out the rest
of that first Article, God is my Judge, I
thought that Paper had been some Pasquil
made against this Divorce, which coming
to your hands ye had sent me, and therefore
without reading any farther therein, I look∣ed
upon your Letter, which resolv'd me of
all these Doubts; but after that I had fully
perused, and rightly consider'd of all your
Papers, I found your Principles so strange,
and your Doubts so far sought, that I thought
it necessary, as I have already said, to set
down unto you my Observations upon them.
But to conclude my Letter with that plain∣ness
that becometh one of my Quality, I
must freely confess, that I find the Grounds
of your Opposition so weak, as I have rea∣son
to apprehend, that the Prejudice you
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
have of the Persons, is the greatest Motive
of breeding these Doubts into you; which
Prejudice is the most dangerous Thing that
can fall in a Judge for misleading of his
Mind. And the Reason moving me to this
Apprehension, is partly grounded upon
your last Words to me at your parting from
<HI>Windsor,</HI> and partly upon a Line scrap'd
out in your Paper of Doubts, for I am sure
you think me not so blunt a Secretary, but
that I can read a Line so scraped out. In
your last Speeches with me, you remember
you told me what Assurance you had of the
Earl's Ability out of his own Mouth, which
you said you could not but trust, because he
was so religious a Nobleman. But when I
told you of the other Party's contrary Af∣firmation,
you remember how you used the
Word of Iniquity, and how far your inter∣lined
Line seems to have a Harmony with
this Word, your self can best judge. Now
then, if I would ask you what Proof you
have of the one's Religion more than the o∣ther's,
you must answer me, by judging upon
the Exterior; and how deceivable that Guess
is, daily experience teaches us. But with a ho∣ly
Protestation that I never knew any Thing
but good in the young Earl. Was not this
the Ground of Master <HI>Robert Bruse</HI>'s Incre∣dulity,
because he knew the Earl of <HI>Gowry</HI>
to be truly Religious; and did not beg a
Register. <HI>Bothwel</HI> in his Preface of his Book
<PB N="135" REF="140"/>
<HI>De viris Illustribus.</HI> And as for your Judgment
of the other Party, <HI>Christ's Precept</HI> is the
best Answer unto you, <HI>nolite judicare.</HI> But
if the Question were to judge of the Earl's
Inclination, whether is it likely that you or
I could best judge of it; I, he having been
bred with my late Son, and serv'd him so
long, or you that never spoke with him but
once or twice in your Life, and never knew
either good or evil of him but out of his
own Mouth. I will conclude therefore,
with inverting the Argument; that if a
Judge should have a Prejudice in respect of
Persons, it should become you rather, to
have a kind of Faith implicit, in my Judg∣ment,
as well in respect of some Skill I have
in Divinity; as also that I hope no honest
Man doubts of the uprightness of my Con∣science;
and the best thankfulness that you
that are so far my Creature, can use to∣wards
me, is, to reverence, and follow my
Judgment, and not to contradict it, except
where you may demonstrate unto me that I
am mistaken, or wrong imformed, and so
farewel.</P>

<P N="1">I. <SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>IRST, that She, and <HI>Ro∣bert,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> were
married by publick Rites
and Ceremonies of the
Church, on the 5th Day
of <HI>January,</HI> 1606.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="137" REF="142"/>
II. That she at that time was full Thir∣teen
Years old, and is at this present, about
Twenty Two, or Twenty Three.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the foresaid <HI>Robert,</HI> at the
time of the pretended Marriage, was a∣bout
Fourteen Years old, and is at this pre∣sent,
about Twenty Three or Twenty Four,
and at that time, and ever since, and at
this present, is a Man (as far forth as a
Man can judge) and hath been in good
Health and perfect Estate of Body, not a∣ny
way hindred by any <HI>Ague</HI> or Sickness,
but that he might have carnal Copulation
with a Woman.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That since the pretended Marriage,
at least by the Space of whole and continu∣ate
Three Years, after the said <HI>Robert</HI> had
fully attained to the Age of Eighteen Years,
as Time and Place did serve, after the
fashion of other married Couples, the said
<HI>Frances Howard,</HI> in hope of lawful Issue,
and that she might be made a Mother, li∣ved
together with the said <HI>Robert</HI> at Bed
and Board, and lay both naked and alone
in the same Bed, as married Folks use;
and desirous to be made a Mother from
time to time, again and again, yielded her
self wholly to his Power, and as much
as lay in her, offer'd her self, and her Bo∣dy
<PB N="138" REF="143"/>
to be known, and earnestly sought and
desired Conjunction and Copulation.</P>
<P N="5">V. And also the said Earl in the afore∣said
time, very often, again and again, did
try to have carnal Copulation, as with his
lawful Wife, which she refused not, but
used the best Means she could; notwith∣standing
all this, the said Earl could never
carnally know her, nor have that Copula∣tion
in any sort which the married Bed
alloweth.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Yet before the said pretended Mar∣riage,
and since the said Earl hath had and
hath Power▪ and Ability of Body, to deal
with other Women, and to know them car∣nally,
and sometimes hath felt the Motion,
and Prick of the Flesh, tending to carnal
Copulation, as he saith and believeth, and
peradventure truly; but by a perpetual,
and natural Impediment, hath been hin∣dred
all the former time, and is at this
present, that he can have no Dealing or
Copulation with the foresaid Lady
<HI>Frances.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Furthermore, the said Lady <HI>Fran∣ces</HI>
hath been, and is a Woman fit and a∣ble
to have Copulation with a Man, and
such an one, as may be carnally known,
neither hath in this regard any Impedi∣ment.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="139" REF="144"/>
VIII. Moreover the said Lady <HI>Frances</HI>
remaineth, and is at this present a Vir∣gin.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Besides, at the time of the pretend∣ed
Marriage, the said Lady <HI>Frances</HI> was
utterly ignorant and unacquainted with the
said Earl's Unability, and Impediments
formerly mentioned.</P>
<P N="10">X. Also the foresaid Earl long before
this Suit commenced, hath very often, and
at sundry times confessed in good Earnest,
before Witnesses of Credit, and his Friends
and Kinsfolk, that although he did greatly
desire, and did his best Endeavours, yet
he never could, nor at this present, can
have carnal Copulation with the said Lady
<HI>Frances,</HI> no not once.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Lastly, in regard of Womanish Mo∣desty,
the said Lady <HI>Frances</HI> hath concealed
all the former Matters, and had a Purpose
for ever to conceal them, if she had not
been forced by false Rumours of her Diso∣bedience
to the foresaid Earl to reveal
them. She requireth, that since this pre∣tended
Matrimony is but in <HI>facto,</HI> and not
in Right, it may be pronounced, declared,
and adjudged as void, and of no Force,
and that she may be freed, and quit from

all Bonds and Knots of the same, by your

<HEAD>The Lord Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>'s
Reasons against the Nullity.</HEAD>
<P>IN as much as we do firmly believe, that
the Scripture directly, or by Conse∣quence
doth contain in it sufficient Mat∣ter
to decide all Controversies, especially
in things appertaining to the Church; and
that Marriage amongst Christians can be no
less accounted than a sacred Thing, as be∣ing
instituted by God in Paradise, honou∣red
by the Presence of our Saviour himself,
declared by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> to be a Figure of the
Spiritual Conjunction between Christ and
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>
his Church; I would be glad to know, by
what Text of Scripture, either of the <HI>Old</HI>
or <HI>New Testament,</HI> a Man may have a War∣rant
to make a <HI>Nullity</HI> of Marriage, so∣lemnly
celebrated in <HI>facie Ecclesiae propter
maleficium versus hanc</HI>; which I do the ra∣ther
ask, because I find Warrant expresly
in Scripture, to make a Nullity of Mar∣riage,
<HI>propter frigiditatem,</HI> by the Words of
our Saviour, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. 12. <HI>For there are
some chast, or Eunuchs, which were so born of
their Mother's Belly; and there be some chast,
which be made chast by Men; and there be
some chast, which have made themselves chast
for the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I would also know gladly, what antient
Father, either amongst the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>La∣tins,</HI>
by Occasion of Interpretation of Scrip∣ture,
or any Disputation hath mentioned,
<HI>Maleficium versus hanc,</HI> or declared it to be
a Cause of Nullity in Marriage.</P>
<P>The like I demand touching the antient
Councils, either general or provincial, and
concerning the Stories Ecclesiastical, whether
any such Matter be to be found in them.</P>
<P>If for ought that appeareth, never men∣tion
was made of this, till the time of <HI>Hinc∣merus
Episcopus Rhemensis,</HI> who lived Nine
Hundred Years after Christ; it may well
be conceived, that this was a Concomitant
of Darkness and Popish Superstition, which
about that time, grew to so great an Height,
<PB N="145" REF="150"/>
God permitting then the Punishment to fall
upon the Children of Unbelief.</P>
<P>But since the Light of the Gospel is now
in so great Measure broken out again, why
should I not hope; but those who have em∣braced
the Gospel, should be free from this
<HI>Maleficium?</HI> especially since amongst a Mil∣lion
of Men in our Age, there is not one
found in all our Country, who is clearly
and evidently known to be troubled with
the same. And if there should be any that
might seem to be thus molested, we are
taught to use two Remedies against it; the
one spiritual Physick, the other external.</P>
<P>For the first, our Saviour said, <HI>Hoc ge∣nus
daemoniorum non ejicetur nisi per orationem
&amp; jejunium.</HI> And St. <HI>Peter</HI> speaking of the
Devil, <HI>Cui resistite firmi in fide:</HI> And the
Canonists themselves prescribe Alms, Fast∣ing,
and Prayer, to be used in that Case;
but that they join superstitiously their Ex∣orcisms
thereunto. And for corporal Phy∣sick
to be applied as against a Disease; it
is the Judgment of our late Divines, whe∣ther
they speak of <HI>Maleficium</HI> or not.</P>
<P>Now admit the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> might be i∣magined
to be troubled with <HI>Maleficium
versus hanc,</HI> I demand what Alms have been
given? What fasting hath been used, what
Prayers have been pour'd out to appease
the Indignation of God towards him, or his
Wife, or what Physick hath been taken,
<PB N="146" REF="151"/>
or Medicine applied for Eight Years toge∣ther?
Not one of these things; but the
first Hearing must be, to pronounce a Nul∣lity
in the Marriage. Of which Declara∣tion
we know the Beginning, but no mor∣tal
Man's Wit can foresee the End either in
his Person, or the Example.</P>

Impotentia alia naturalis, alia ac∣cidentaria
est. Naturalis, cum quis naturae
non est idoneus ad commixtionem conjugalem.
Accitentale, cum quis est castratus, aut vene∣ficio
corruptus. Rursus quae ex veneficio ac∣cedit
impotentia, aut curari potest medicamen∣tis,
aut est perpetua. Ex his distinctionibus
sumitur explicatio questionis, An, &amp; quomo∣do
impotentia sit causa divortii. Nam inter
impotentes, non potest constare conjugium, quiae
deest causa sufficiens &amp; finalis. Primum, ni
persona illa quae sana est, decepta fuit, &amp; ig∣norans
duxit impotentem, non igitur potuit esse
consensus, qui est causa efficiens Matrimonii.
Secundo duplex est finis conjugii, unus est ge∣neratio

<P>INhabilitas corporum ad usum matrimonii
divortii causa est, &amp; nonnunquam fascino
&amp; veneficio adeo inhabiles reduntur viri, ut
nunquam sanari possint. Sed plura sunt judicii
perpendenda, antequam divortii sententiam
serat. Primum, an impotentia praecesseret
Nuptias. Secundum, an sit subsecuta Nup∣tias.
Tertium an sit curabilis. Quartum,
an ejus rei mulier conscia fuerit ante Nuptias.
Si praecesserit Nuptias, potest liberari persona
sana divortium petens, non enim fuit verum
conjugium, siquidem non legitime consentiunt,
cum unus fallit, alter errat, fallit impotens,
errat potens. Cum ergo Deus nec fallacium
nec errorem probat, non est dicendus cos con∣junxisse.
Proinde Judex, si intellexerit ex

<HEAD>His Majesty's Answer to the Arch-bishop's
Reasons.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>TO the first Article, that the Scrip∣ture
directly, or by Consequence
doth contain sufficient Matter to decide all
<PB N="153" REF="158"/>
Controversies, especially in things appertain∣ing
to the Church; this in my Opinion is
<HI>propositio erronea,</HI> and one of the Puritan's
Grounds, without a better Distinction or
Explanation. For the Orthodox Proposi∣tion
is, That the Scripture doth directly, or
by Consequence, contain in it self suffici∣ent
Matter to decide all Controversies in
Points of Faith and Salvation; of which
sort a Nullity in Marriage cannot be ac∣counted
for one; and therefore your Con∣sequence
upon the former Proposition must
fail.</P>
<P>For farther Satisfaction to your former
Question, I say, your own Second Questi∣on
doth answer it: For if there be a War∣rant
in Scripture for pronouncing a Nullity,
<HI>propter frigiditatem,</HI> then all the Means,
which may make him <HI>frigidus versus hanc,</HI>
must be comprehended therein. For why
doth our Church justly condemn as incestu∣ous,
the Marriage of a Man with his Si∣ster's
Daughter, or the Marriage of Two
Sisters, but <HI>à Paritate Rationis?</HI> for none
of them is in <HI>terminis</HI> prohibited by the
Scripture, only the Conclusion is gather'd
<HI>à Paritate Rationis.</HI> For if it be not lawful
to marry your Father's Wife, because there∣by
you discover your Father's Shame; nor
his Sister, because she is his Kinswoman;
nor your own Sister, because thereby you
discover your Father, and Mother's Shame:
<PB N="154" REF="159"/>
It can no more be lawful to marry your
Sister's Daughter; for thereby you also
discover your own Shame. As also that
the same Reason serves for ascending or de∣scending,
in Points of Consanguinity, <HI>quia
par est Ratio.</HI> The like is in this Case, for
altho' Christ spake only of three sorts of
Eunuchs, yet <HI>ratio est quia non potest esse co∣pula
inter Eunuchum &amp; mulierem,</HI> and there∣fore
St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the 6th of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI>
telleth us clearly, that it is no <HI>Conjunction
sine copula:</HI> I conclude therefore, <HI>à paritate
rationis,</HI> that Christ did comprehend under
those three sorts of Eunuchs all Inability,
which did perpetually hinder <HI>Copulam ver∣sus
hanc,</HI> whether it were natural or acci∣dental.
For what Difference is there be∣twixt
cutting off of the Hand, and being
made impotent thereof? <HI>Amputatio &amp;
mutulatio Membri,</HI> is all one in the Civil
Law, and it is alike defrauding of the Wo∣man,
when either he who is to be her Hus∣band
is gelded, or when the Use of that
Member towards her is by any unlawful
Means taken from him. Neither is it any
way needful to crave the particular War∣rant
of Nullity, <HI>propter Maleficium,</HI> out of
the Scripture, no more than there is War∣rant
in that Place for any Nullity at all.
For Christ doth not directly say, that a
Marriage so made shall be null; neither
doth he teach us what Form of Process shall
<PB N="155" REF="160"/>
be used in it; neither maketh he mention
of a triennial Probation, no more than he
forbiddeth Marriage within the Fourth
Degree, without Leave obtained of the
Bishop of the Diocess. It is therefore suf∣ficient
to all moderate Christians, to be
taught out of the Word, that Marriage is
null <HI>sine Copula,</HI> and that the Word <HI>Quos
Deus conjunxit,</HI> is never found in the Scrip∣ture,
where <HI>erunt</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> doth not
precede, (<HI>viz. they shall be one Flesh.</HI>) But
whether the Impediment be universal, or
<HI>versus hanc</HI> only, and whether the Fault
thereof have been born with him, or done
to him by Violence, or fallen by Disease,
or by Disproportion, or Ineptitude betwixt
the Parties, or by unlawful or unnatural
Practices, it is ever <HI>par ratio:</HI> He is <HI>Eu∣nuchus
versus hanc</HI>; for he ought to be <HI>Eu∣nuchus
versus omnes alias,</HI> seeing to her only
he was married; and therefore <HI>à Paritate
Rationis,</HI> such Nullities are grounded upon
the aforesaid Warrant of Scripture; nei∣ther
had Christ then any Occasion to speak
to the <HI>Jews</HI> concerning <HI>Maleficium</HI>; for as
it is apparent, that God made King <HI>Abime∣lech</HI>
and his Family unable to abuse <HI>Sarah,</HI>
<HI>Abraham</HI>'s Wife; and so was he made by
God himself <HI>Eunuchus versus hanc:</HI> is it not
improbable, that the Devil being God's
Ape, should imitate God's Work by his
filthy Witchcraft, by making such as God
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
will permit him, <HI>inhabile versus hanc,</HI> tho'
it may be, that it was long after that time,
before the Devil put that Trick in use up∣on
the Earth.</P>
<P>As to your Third and Fourth Questions,
What mention the Fathers, and Councils
make of <HI>Maleficium versus hanc?</HI> First, I
answer, That it may be, if they be well
searched, that either something to this
purpose shall be found in them; or at least
<HI>aliquid analogum,</HI> which <HI>à paritate rationis,</HI>
or by Consequence, may serve to decide
this Question. But leaving this to the
Search, my main Answer is, That we must
distinguish of Times. For in all the first
Ages, as long as Persecution lay heavy up∣on
the Church, and before that the Empe∣rors
became Christians, the Church did
not meddle with Questions of Marriage;
for the Civil Judges determined them,
who would not suffer the Church to med∣dle
with any thing which drew a Conse∣quence
after it of Possessions, and Inheri∣tance,
as Marriage doth. Nay, even di∣vers
hundred Years, after the Conversion
of the Emperors, the Judgment and De∣cisions
of all such Questions did still remain
in <HI>foro Civili,</HI> till the Popedom began to
wax great, and assume, or rather usurp to
her self a Power of Supreme, or Indepen∣dent
Judicatory in all Ecclesiastical Causes:
And therefore the Fathers, and Councils
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>
had no Occasion to make mention of that
which was not <HI>eorum fori</HI> at that time. And
besides that, it is an evil Argument to say,
that such a thing is unlawful, because the
Fathers, and first Councils make no men∣tion
of it. For you know much beter than I,
that divers main Points in Controversy be∣twixt
the Papists and us, are never men∣tion'd
by the Fathers, because they could
never have dreamt that such Questions
would arise; and therefore we only find
the Fathers exact in such Questions, as
were most agitated, and upon the Stage in
their time; as <HI>de Trinitate: de duabus in
Christo Naturis,</HI> and such like. It is
therefore sufficient, that there can be no∣thing
found in them, which may be justly
understood to contradict this Opinion; and
it is very probable (as I said before) that
this Trick of <HI>Maleficium</HI> had not then been
put in Practice in the World, and there∣fore
not known, nor mentioned by them;
for why may not the Devil find out as well
new Tricks of Witchcraft, when God
will permit him, as he doth daily new sorts
of Heresies? for his Malice can never end,
till the End of Times.</P>
<P>To your Fifth Argument my former
Answer doth also serve. For till the Nine
Hundredth Year of God, it may be, that
that devilish Trick came never to be dis∣covered,
and you know the old Proverb,
<PB N="158" REF="163"/>
<HI>Ex malis moribus bonae leges,</HI> and it is not un∣likely
that that Time of Darkness gave the
Devil occasion of devising of such new
Tricks. Look my <HI>Demonology,</HI> and yet
was that Law, for which you cite <HI>Hincma∣rus
Episcopus Rhemensis,</HI> made by <HI>Charles the
Great,</HI> who in many great Points, as you
know, had so great Light, as I dare scarcely
term his Time a Time of Blindness. But
how great and palpable soever that Dark∣ness
was in Points of Superstition, I will
still maintain it, as I have ever done, that
for Matter of Order and Policy, all the
World shall never be able to find out any
other so good, and so old an Order of Go∣vernment
to be put in the place of it. In
sign whereof, there is no well governed
Commonwealth in the Christian World,
where the Canon Law is not received to
judge in Questions of that Nature; and it
is certain, that this Question in hand is on∣ly
a Question of Order and Policy; for the
Grounds of this Question, <HI>That the essential
Point of Matrimony cannot be accomplished, si∣ne
Copula,</HI> is warranted by express Scrip∣ture,
and confessed by your self.</P>
<P>To your Sixth Argument, or rather
Hope, I fear that Hope shall prove contra∣ry
to Faith. For as sure as God is, there
be Devils, and Devils must have some
Power, and their Power is in this World,
(for <HI>Satan</HI> is the Prince of this World:)
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
Neither are the Elect exempted from his
Power; <HI>Job</HI> was not; St. <HI>Paul</HI> was not:
Christ saith to all his Disciples, <HI>Cribravit
vos Satanas.</HI> And if the Devil hath any
Power over the Elect, it is over their Flesh;
and if over the Flesh, rather over the
fleshest, and most sinful part thereof; where∣unto
original Sin is so tyed, as God, both be∣fore
and under the Law, to shew the diffi∣culty
of purging Mans original Sin, ordain∣ed
the amputation of the Fore-skin of that
Member. And to exempt those of our
Profession from the Power of Witchcraft,
is a Paradox never yet maintained by any
Learned, or Wise Man. That the Devils
Power is not so universally unbridled a∣mongst
us, that I freely confess, but that it
is totally restrained, <HI>quoad nos,</HI> how then
was a Minister of <HI>Geneva</HI> bewitched to
Death? And how are the Witches daily
punished by our Laws? Surely if they can
harm none but the Papists, we are too Cha∣ritable
to labour for avenging them only.
<HI>Satan</HI> is permitted to punish Man as well for
the breach of the Second, as the First Ta∣ble;
and thereof are we no less Guilty
than the Papists are. And if the Power of
Witchcraft may reach to our Life, how
much more to a Member? especially to a
Member so governed by the Fantasie,
wherein the Devil hath his principal Opera∣tion,
and he may so estrange the Husband's
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>
Affection from the Wife, as he cannot be
able to perform that Duty unto her. For
it is a common Thing in many Mens Na∣ture,
that they cannot do that Act but
where they Love, nor Fight but when they
are Angry. God keep us therefore from
putting the Trial of our Profession upon
Miracles; let the Miracle-mongers live by
their own Trade.</P>
<P>To your Seventh Argument touching the
Remedies, what do you know whether both
Parties, or either of them, have used both
those Remedies or not? And that that spi∣ritual
Remedy of Fasting and Prayer should
be used publickly for them, I can see no
necessity. For <HI>non interest Reipublicae nec Ec∣clesiae.</HI>
And private Persons are command∣ed
to use their Fasting and Alms secretly,
and in private; besides, that no such Re∣medy
or Cure is likely to succeed well, ex∣cept
the Parties own Heart and Desire be
set upon it.</P>
<P>And as for your Conclusion upon the <HI>in∣commodum,</HI>
either in these Persons, or in
the Example, I can see none in either; for
as to this Couple, (betwixt whom Mar∣riage
was never truly accomplished,) they
will peradventure both of them by the de∣claratory
of this Nullity, be made capable
to accomplish lawful Marriage with others,
(which they could not do betwixt them∣selves)
wherein they may live to the satis∣faction
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>
of their Hearts, and enjoy the Bles∣sing
of Procreation of Children. And as
to the Example, the Law shall be fulfilled
by due Administration of Justice, which
cannot serve for an Example or President
of counterfeited Nullites in Time to come;
for, <HI>Notoritas facti,</HI> or rather <HI>non facti,</HI> is
<HI>luce clariorie</HI> in this Case. Besides the ma∣ny
legal Probations and Confessions of the
Parties, which have been taken in this Pro∣cess;
whereas by the contrary, if they shall
be forcibly kept together, their Names,
or shadows may well be kept together, but
never their Persons or Affections; and they
shall be forced to live either in perpetual
Misery and Scandal, or both: And what
such a forced Continency can avail, the
Monks Continency can teach us. And for
a President in time to come, it can reach no
further than to open a way of lawful Re∣lief
for any Parties who shall chance to be
distressed in that sort. <HI>Hac est mea senten∣tia.</HI></P>
<P>2. And, as for the Extract of our late
Divines Opinions upon this Question, I
confess, I cannot guess what your intent
was in sending them unto me, for they all
agree in <HI>Terminis</HI> with my Opinion, that
there is such a Thing as <HI>Maleficiati versus
hanc</HI>; and your very interlined Passages
prove it clearliest. As for their Advice
concerning the Remedies, that is, <HI>Consili∣um,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
<HI>non jus, nec Decretum</HI>; not imposing a
necessity; but is to be used by discretion,
as occasion shall serve, or require it.</P>
<P>1. As for the legal Doubts of formality,
they concern none of your Calling. If
your Conscience be resolved in the Points
of Divinity, it is your part to give your
consent to the Nullity, and let the Lawyers
take the burthen of making it formal.</P>
<P>And as for the triennial Probation, I hope
no Man can be so blind as to make a double
triennial, both <HI>Ante &amp; post litem contesta∣tam.</HI>
And in Conclusion, our new Divines
Solution of this Question proveth clearly,
that their Resolution upon this Doubt,
(howsoever it was first conceiv'd in blind∣ness,
as you think,) yet is it now approved
in the time of the greatest Light, and Pu∣rity
of the Profession of the Gospel.</P>
<P>To conclude then, if this may satisfy
your Doubts, I will end with our Saviour's
Words to St. <HI>Peter, Et cum conversus eris,
confirma fratres tuos.</HI> But I must add, <HI>vel
(si opus fuerit) converte fratres tuos.</HI> For on
my Conscience, all the Doubts I have yet
seen made in this Business, are nothing but
<HI>Nodos in Scirpo quaerere.</HI></P></Q></P>

that great Engine of the State,
by whom all Wheels moved, held an in∣timate
Correspondence with the House of
<HI>Suffolk,</HI> which he had strengthned with an
Alliance; marrying his eldest Son, the
Lord <HI>Cranborn,</HI> to <HI>Katharine,</HI> the eldest
Daughter of that Family. And being
mindful of the Asperity and Sharpness
that was betwixt him and the late Earl of
<HI>Essex,</HI> he thought it a good Act of Policy
and Piety not to suffer Malice to become
Hereditary, and therefore he was a great
Means in marrying the young Earl of
<HI>Essex</HI> to the Lady <HI>Frances Howard,</HI> ano∣ther
of those Sisters, that the Father's
Enmity might be closed up by the Son's
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
Nuptial Fraternity. The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>
was Fourteen Years of Age, and she
Thirteen, when they married; too young
to consider, but old enough to consent:
Yet by the Advice of Friends separated
after Marriage, she under her Mother's
Wing, and he visiting <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI>
till Time should mature and ripen a
happy Co-union. The Court was her
Nest, her Father being Lord Chamber∣lain;
and she was hatch'd up by her Mo∣ther,
whom the sowr Breath of that Age
(how justly I know not) had already taint∣ed;
from whom the young Lady might
take such a Tincture, that Ease, Great∣ness,
and Court Glories, would more di∣stain
and impress on her, than any way
wear out and diminish. And growing to
be a Beauty of the greatest Magnitude in
that Horizon, was an Object fit for Ad∣mirers,
and every Tongue grew an Ora∣tor
at that Shrine.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> now in his Puber∣ty,
sent many loving Glances, as Ambas∣sadors
of his good Respects; and amo∣rous
Expressions are fit Subjects for jealous
Reproaches to work on. Her Husband
having been now Three or Four Years
beyond the Seas, (sick with Absence from
her whom his Desires longed after) came
over again, and found that Beauty, which
he had left Innocent, so faded and so∣phisticated,
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
with some Court Drug which
had wrought upon her, that he became
the greatest Stranger at home. His Pa∣tience
made way for him a while, and
he bore up with a gentle Gale against the
Stream of this Woman's Affections, which
ran altogether (unknown to him) into a∣nother
Channel. Nor was her Reputa∣tion
yet become so robust, (being of a ten∣der
Growth) to strike his Ears with Re∣proaches;
and therefore he imputed her
sly Entertainments to a Maiden bashful∣ness;
till surfeited with that dull Potion
(upon better Advice) he went to the
Earl of <HI>Suffolk</HI> (her Father) and demand∣ed
his Wife, thinking himself capable to
enjoy both her and her Love. The Fa∣ther,
that thought there had been an In∣timacy
betwixt them suitable to their
Conjugal Knot, made use of his Paternal
Power to reduce his Daughter to the Obe∣dience
of a Wife. But while these
Things were struggling for, a most violent
Disease of a poysonous Nature, imputed
to, but far transcending, the Small-Pox,
seized on the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>; and had not
the Strength of Youth, and that Almigh∣ty
Power that orders all things, wrought
out the Venom of it, the Earth (as
probable wish'd by her) had been his
Marriage-Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175"/>
For this Lady being taken with the
growing Fortunes of ROBERT CAR, Vis∣count
<HI>Rochester,</HI> and grounding more
Hope upon him than the uncertain and
hopeless Love of the Prince, she cast her
Anchor there, which the Prince soon dis∣cover'd,
and slighted her accordingly.
For dancing one time among the Ladies,
and her Glove falling down, it was taken
up, and presented to him, by one that
thought he did him acceptable Service;
but the Prince refus'd to receive it, say∣ing
publickly, He would not have it, it
is stretcht by another, meaning the Vis∣count:
This was an Aggravation of Ha∣tred
betwixt the King's Son and the
King's Friend.</P>
<P>The Countess of <HI>Essex</HI> having her Heart
alienated from her Husband, and set up∣on
the Viscount, had a double Task to
undergo, for accomplishing her Ends:
One was, to hinder her Husband from
enjoying her; the other was to make the
Viscount sure unto her: For dishonest
Love is most full of Jealousy. Her Hus∣band
she look'd upon as a private Person,
and to be carried by him into the Coun∣try,
out of her Element, (being Ambi∣tious
of Glory, and a Beauty covetous of
Applause) were to close (as she thought)
with an insufferable Torment; though he
was a Man that did not only every way
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
merit her Love, but he lov'd her with an
extraordinary Affection, having a gentle,
mild, and courteous Disposition, especi∣ally
to Women, such as might win upon
the roughest Natures. But this fiery
Heat of his Wife's mounted upon the
Wings of Lust, or Love, (call it what
you will) carried her after so much Mis∣chief,
that those that saw her Face,
might challenge Nature of too much Hy∣pocrisy,
for harbouring so wicked a Heart
under so sweet and bewitching a Counte∣nance.</P>
<P>To strengthen her Designs, she finds
out one of her own Stamp, Mrs. <HI>Turner,</HI>
a Doctor of Physick's Widow, a Woman
whom Prodigality and Loosness had
brought low; yet her Pride would make
her fly any Pitch, rather than fall into
the Jaws of Want. These two consult
together, how they may stop the Current
of the Earl's Affection towards his Wife,
and make a clear Passage for the Viscount
in the Place. To effect which, one Doctor
<HI>Forman,</HI> a reputed Conjurer, (living at
<HI>Lambeth</HI>) is found out: The Women de∣clare
to him their Grievances; he promi∣ses
sudden Help; and to amuse them,
frames many little Pictures of Brass and
Wax, some like the Viscount and Countess,
whom he must unite and strengthen; o∣thers
like the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> whom he
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
must debilitate and weaken; and then
with Philtrous Powders, and such Drugs
he works upon their Persons. And to
practise what Effects his Art would pro∣duce,
Mrs. <HI>Turner,</HI> that lov'd Sir <HI>Arthur
Manwaring</HI> (a Gentleman then attending
the Prince) and willing to keep him to
her, gave him some of the Powder, which
wrought so violently with him, that,
through a Storm of Rain and Thunder,
he rode Fifteen Miles one dark Night to
her House, scarce knowing where he
was till he was there. <HI>Such is the Devil∣ish
and mad Rage of Lust, heighten'd with
Art and Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>These Things matur'd and ripen'd by
the Cunning of this Jugler <HI>Forman,</HI> gave
them Assurance of happy Hopes. Her
Courtly Invitements, that drew the Vis∣count
to observe her, she imputed to the
Operation of those Drugs he had tasted;
and that Harshness, and stubborn Com∣portment
she expressed to her Husband,
making him (weary of such Entertain∣ments)
to absent himself, she thought
proceeded from the Effects of those un∣known
Potions and Powders that were ad∣ministred
to him: So apt is the Imagina∣tion
to take Impression of those Things
we are willing to believe.</P>
<P>The good Earl finding his Wife noussed
in the Court, and seeing no Possibility to
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
reduce her to Reason, till she were estran∣ged
from the Relish and Taste of the
Delights she suck'd in there, made his
Condition again known to her Father.
The old Man being troubled with his
Daughter's Disobedience, imbitter'd her,
being near him, with wearisome and con∣tinual
Chidings, to wean her from the
Sweets she doted on, and with much a∣do,
forc'd her into the Country. But
how harsh was the parting, being rent a∣way
from the Place where she grew and
flourish'd? Yet she left all her Engines
and Imps behind her; the old Doctor,
and his Confederate, Mrs. <HI>Turner,</HI> must
be her two Supporters: She blazons all
her Miseries to them at her departure, and
moistens the Way with her Tears. <HI>Chart∣ley</HI>
was an hundred Miles from her Hap∣piness,
and a little time thus lost is her
Eternity. When she came thither (tho'
in the pleasantest time of Summer) she
shut her self up in her Chamber, not suf∣fering
a Beam of Light to peep upon her
dark Thoughts: If she stir'd out of her
Chamber, it was in the Dead of Night,
when Sleep had taken Possession of all
others but those about her. In this im∣placable,
sad, discontented Humour, she
continued some Months, always mur∣muring
against, but never giving the least
civil Respect to her Husband; which the
<PB N="174" REF="179"/>
good Man suffer'd patiently, being loath
to be the Divulger of his own Misery:
Yet having a Manly Courage, he would
sometimes break into a little Passion, to
see himself slighted and neglected by him∣self;
but having never found better from
her, it was the easier to bear with her.</P>
<P>While she was at <HI>Chartley,</HI> she writ to
her Confederates, That <HI>her Husband found
little Operation in their Drugs, complaining
of his Lustiness and her Misery: For</HI> (she
said) <HI>the Viscount would never love her, if
her Husband did meddle with her, which
with Difficulty she yet impeded, but how long
she should resist his Violence, she knew not;
therefore she implor'd their Assistance, if they
would not see her the most despicable Crea∣ture
in the World: And for Satisfaction, they
should make their own Price.</HI> With this
kind of Stuff she fill'd her Letters, which
were after found in <HI>Forman</HI>'s Closet. These
Instigations made him active; and the
Man being skilful in Natural Ma∣gick,
did use all the Artifice his Sub∣tilty
could devise, really to imbecili∣tate
the Earl; for no Linnen came near
his Body, that was not rinsed with their
Camphire Compositions, and other faint
and wasting Ingredients; and all inward
Applications were foisted on him by cor∣rupted
Servants, to lessen and debilitate
the Seminal Operations: which <HI>Venefici∣um</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
is one great part of Witchcraft, de∣structive
to Nature, and horribly abomi∣nable
to be practised. And this in time
wrought such Effects upon his Person,
that he found himself unable with her,
tho' she permitted him; yet when he had
been from her some reasonable time, to
renovate his Spirits, by shaking off those
Artificial Applications, then his Abilities
made her unwilling and refractory. Tho'
some are of Opinion, that he was not
much debilitated, but that she got (by
her virtuous Agents) an Artifice too im∣modest
to be express'd, to hinder Pene∣tration.
And thus she tormented him,
till he was contented to let her steer her
own Course, which after run her on
Ground.</P>
<P>For coming to <HI>London</HI> next Winter
with this full Sail, loaden with Lust, she
found the Viscount much prepar'd for
her; who being at first fasten'd on the
Object, Absence, and all those little Ar∣tifices
that mischievous Women and cun∣ning
Impostures could devise, had advan∣ced
him as much in his Desires, as they
had hindred the other. We could
dispute the Nature of these Operations,
how far they are contingent, and how
the Fancy works with them, tho' igno∣rant
of them, making their Impulsions
more active, being the Sparks that kin∣dle
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>
this combustible Matter; for we will
never allow there was any other Diabo∣lical
Means used, Nature being strong e∣enough
for such a Production; but being
not pertinent to the Story, will leave it,
and follow them that found the Effects of
it, and had Affections suitable to it, which
they made use of with an unbridled Ap∣petite,
yet meeting closely in Corners,
(Sin being at first shame-fac'd) but after∣wards
they grew more bold; and every
Hour that the Viscount could steal from
his Royal Master, he dedicated it to his
disloyal Mistress: Being caught in this
Net of Adulation, he becomes a willing
Prisoner; Lust only getting Liberty to
all Looseness and Licentiousness: Places
of frequent Meetings are daily renew'd;
Persons fitted for such Practices are em∣ploy'd;
and when Nature was exhaust∣ed,
Art, her subtle Imitator, brought in
her Store, to contribute new Spirits,
purchased at any rate. All outward A∣dornment,
to present Beauty in her full
Glory, were not wanting on both sides,
being Lust's Fuel, which tended to the
Consumption of all Reason: And among
the rest, yellow Starch, the Invention
and foil of Jaundice Complexions, with
great cut-work Bands, and Piccadillies,
(a thing that hath since lost the Name)
crouded in and flourish'd among us, Mrs.
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
<HI>Turner</HI> being nominated to be the first
Contriver, happily in <HI>England,</HI> but the
Original came out from <HI>France</HI>; which
Fashion and Colour did set off their lean
and sallow Countenances. Thus did the
Viscount get the Conquest of two, the
King, and this Lady, but could not sub∣due
his own lustful Appetite.</P>
<P>However, the King's Affections were
not so monopoliz'd, but that his crafty
Servant the Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> had a good
Hole, as well in his Councils as Trea∣sure:
And being not well pleas'd to see
himself bearded by a Youth, new started
into the Affairs of the World, and moun∣ted
by the Wing of Love, not of Merit,
he cast out many Mists before him, to
hinder and damp his Passage so, that
the Viscount could not rise to that Pitch
(during his Life) that he afterwards ar∣riv'd
at.</P>
<P>On the 6th Day of <HI>November,</HI> Death
depriv'd us of the King's eldest Son,
Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> a Prince as eminent in No∣bleness
as in Blood, and having a Spirit
too full of Life and Splendor, to be
long shrouded in a Cloud of Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Anno.</HI> 1613. The Viscount <HI>Rochester,</HI>
all this while (tho' plung'd in Lust) was
held up by the Chin in the Glories of the
Court; and the Prince (that interposed
betwixt him and the Beams of Ma∣jesty)
<PB N="178" REF="183"/>
being remov'd, the Earl of <HI>Salis∣bury</HI>
(another Obstacle) dying Six Months
after the Prince, in the Way from the
<HI>Bath</HI>; he now took full Possession of the
King's Favours alone. He executes the
Place of Principal Secretary, receiving
all Pacquets, and dispatching Answers
without the Knowledge of the King or
Council; or if the King did know, his
Love had hoarded up such a Confidence
in him, as he laid all out upon that Stock.
<HI>Rochester</HI>'s greatest Assistant was a pri∣vate
Gentleman, one Sir <HI>Thomas Over∣bury,</HI>
by whose Compass he steer'd his
Course, who (being a Man of Parts and
Abilities) had wrought upon the Vis∣count
so, as not only to keep him in, and
close with the King, but to make him ca∣pable
of managing the highest Affairs, if
he had kept himself within the Circle
drawn to his Hand. This Intimacy be∣twixt
them, spake <HI>Overbury,</HI> an Actor in
all his Privacies. And when he under∣stood
by the Viscount his Intention of
Marriage with the Countess of <HI>Essex,</HI> he
oppos'd it with all the powerful Argu∣ments
he could use: For tho' he might
be so active, in his Initiation of Favour
with the Viscount, to be Assistant to his
Pleasures, and for carrying forward some
of his dark Contrivances, (those Secre∣taries
being always the greatest Favou∣rites)
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>
yet having now gotten good foot∣ing
in his Affection, and building his For∣tune
thereon, his Reason might tell him,
there could be nothing more destructive
to both their growing Hopes, than to lay
a Foundation upon so much publick In∣justice,
as to marry another Man's Wife,
her Husband living; therefore he pas∣sionately
perswaded him to cast his
Thoughts upon a more honourable Ob∣ject,
and not one, whose Disloyalty (in
her present Condition) was so much
branded with Infamy, that the Marks of
it would be visible on his Face. But the
Viscount, bewitched with the Entice∣ments
of his Soul-ravishing Mistress, (un∣capable
of good Counsel) doth not only
call home his Affections from <HI>Overbury,</HI>
that had been long Leiger with him,
(denouncing Enmity) but incites his Be∣loved
against him also; who mustering
up all her Passions, with the greatest A∣crimony,
that a Feminine Malice could
devise, she never left, till she had dis∣charg'd
all the Vollies of her Rage upon
him. And the better to do it, she con∣sults
with her Uncle, the Earl of <HI>North∣ampton,</HI>
aggravating <HI>Overbury</HI>'s Offence,
as tending to the Dishonour of their
whole Family: That he (a petty Fellow)
should dare to raise such Scandals against
her Innocency. The Earl of <HI>North∣ampton,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
that knew of the Endearments
betwixt the Viscount and his Niece, (so
base and mercenary was his Spirit)
thought it good Policy to stop all Passa∣ges,
that it might not come into the pub∣lick
Mouth: For being in a Sphere elated
above others, it was a Sin of a high Pre∣sumption,
for any of an inferior Orb to
move but in its own Place, or meddle with
what is above them. He therefore closes
with the Viscount, (whom in his flattering
Acclamations by Letters, he makes a lit∣tle
Deity) and after some Dispute of the
manner how to be revenged of <HI>Overbury,</HI>
they conclude to dispatch him by Poison,
which could not be done so well in a pub∣lick
way; and therefore they subtilly
contrive to exasperate the King a∣gainst
him, that being a Prisoner, and
shackled by them to a Place, he might
be a more settled Mark for their enve∣nom'd
Arrows.</P>
<P>About the same time, the King think∣ing
fit to send an Ambassador into <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
to the Arch-Duke (some say, into
<HI>France</HI>) the Viscount recommended Sir
<HI>Thomas Overbury</HI> to the King for that
Service, (extolling his Abilities, and Fit∣ness
for the same, publickly, that more
Notice might be taken of the Affront) and
the King made choice of him for that
Employment, Which done, the Vis∣count
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
(under the Shadow of Friendship)
imparts to <HI>Overbury,</HI> what Intentions the
King had towards him; but he thought
it would not be so convenient for him to
accept of it, because he should not only
lose his Converse and Company by such
an Alienation, (which he highly valued)
but many a fair Opportunity of impro∣ving
his Respects to him, in some better
way of Advancement. <HI>Overbury</HI> had
not been so little a Courtier, or a Man of
so mean Reason, but that he was sensible
what Displeasure he should pull upon
himself, by refusing the King's Com∣mands:
And therefore he told the Vis∣count,
that betwixt the King's Favours,
and his Friendship, he had a great Con∣flict
in his Spirit, being willing to retain
both; but how he should refuse the
King's Commands with Safety, he knew
not. But the Viscount, with fair Pro∣mises,
prevail'd with him to set up his
Rest at home, upon higher Expectation,
(such a sweet Bait is Ambition!) pro∣testing
to take off the Asperity of the
King's Anger from him, and smooth his
Way so, as should be for his better Ad∣vantage.
When he had wrought <HI>Over∣bury</HI>
in this Forge, he goes to the King,
and blows the Fire, incensing him with
all the Aggravations he could; so that
the poor Gentleman, for his Contempt
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
was forthwith committed to the <HI>Tower.</HI>
And to prepare all things for his Recep∣tion
there, Sir <HI>William Wade,</HI> the late
Lieutenant, was remov'd, and Sir <HI>Jervis
Ellowis,</HI> a Person more ambitious than in∣digent
(having made his Way by Mony,
the common Merit) was admitted to the
Place.</P>
<P>Now the Countess, like another <HI>A∣lecto,</HI>
drove furiously, her Chariot ha∣ving
two Wheels, which ran over all Im∣pediments:
One was, to sue a Divorce
betwixt her and her Husband, that she
might marry the Viscount: The other
was, to take away <HI>Overbury,</HI> the Blemish
in her Eye, and that laid such a Stain
upon her, that nothing but his Blood
could expiate. For these she hath seve∣ral
Engines; the one must be acted O∣vertly;
the other Covertly, in dark
Corners; and she and her Agents find
fit Ministers for both.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> resenting his
Nieces Grievances, makes the King ac∣quainted
with her Maiden Bashfulness,
how loth she is to divulge her Husband's
Infirmities, and how long it is since her
Marriage, and yet she hath not enjoyed
the Happiness of a Wife; that her Hus∣band's
Inability must needs be an unna∣tural
Conjunction, such as neither Law
nor Reason can admit of; and that there
<PB N="183" REF="188"/>
was a great Affection betwixt the Viscount
and her, so as there seem'd to be a more
excellent Sympathy, and sweet Compo∣sition
of Soul in them, more suitable to
Reason and Nature, than in the State
she was in Which was seconded by the
Viscount's humble Submissions to the
King's great Wisdom, who (he acknow∣ledg'd)
had not only raised him to what
he is, but may yet make him more hap∣py,
by uniting him to a Lady of so much
Honour and Virtue.</P>
<P>The King, that took Delight to com∣pleat
the Happiness of them he lov'd,
commanded the Bishops to sue out a Di∣vorce
between the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> and
his Lady, that the Viscount might
marry her: For he had been practis'd
formerly in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in his Minority,
with the like Experiment. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> being
married to the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> under
pretence of Impotency, but merely for
Lust, (as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Johnston</HI>'s Hist. of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> Author reports) was Di∣vorced
from her Husband, and married
to the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> (the King's Favou∣rite)
who had been before a Partner in
her Adulterous Sheets, (so current is the
Parrallel, and so equally are Lust and
Ambition yoked together, that they both
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
(with full Violence) draw one and the
same Way.)</P>
<P>The Bishops and others, having a Com∣mission
under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI>
to convene the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and his
Countess before them, sent out their
Summons, and they made their Appea∣rance
accordingly. But before they pro∣ceeded,
they caused a Jury of Twelve
discreet Matrons to be impanell'd, to
search the Countess, whether she were
(as she pretended to be, and was repu∣ted)
a Maid still; for if she were a Maid,
they could fasten upon a Nullity, and so
separate them for the more Honour of
her Virginity. The Countess being a∣sham'd,
and bashful, to come to such a
Trial, would not expose her Face to the
Light; but being to appear before the
Matrons under a Veil, another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said to be one of Sir <HI>Thomas Monson</HI>'s Daugh∣ters, for the Countess was reported to have had a Child in the Earl's Absence.</NOTE> young
Gentlewoman, that had less offended,
was fobbed into the Place; and she pas∣sed,
in the Opinion, both of Jury and
Judges, to be a Virgin.</P>
<P>These Bishops, and the rest of the
Judges, could not be ignorant what scan∣dalous
Reports of this Lady's Actions
flew up and down, from Lip to Lip;
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
which, however sweeten'd by the Parta∣kers,
carried an ill Savour with them in
every honest Understanding, who were
not blinded with Wilfulness, or deafned
with Prejudice, which made the Bishops of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> decline the Busi∣ness,
though nominated in the Patent.
But Kings will never want fit Ministers in
corrupted Times, both in Church and
Commonwealth, as long as there are de∣grees,
and Places of Ascent to clime to.
And though these Things floated a while
upon the Streams of Greatness, yet there
is one above that moves the Waters;
who did not only see what pass'd in the
Bishop's Palace, but in the closest Prison,
which he discover'd to the Shame and
Ruin of the Actors.</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>The Countess's Attempts against the

<P>THE Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> being a Gentleman

<P>The Earl having escaped this Plot, the
hatred of the Countess still increas'd to∣wards
him, and drew her headlong into her
own Destruction. He perceiving himself
less regarded, gives her fresh Advice, en∣deavouring,
if possible, to reclaim her,
which she not in the least regarded, but
<PB N="187" REF="192"/>
grew more enrag'd, and in a great Fury she
takes her Coach, and repairs to Mrs. <HI>Tur∣ner,</HI>
who was ready to assist in any evil Act;
accordingly they repaired to one Dr. <HI>Forman</HI>
at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> who was skill'd in the Magic
Art; him they fee'd to join with them, who
tried many Devices to bewitch the Earl; all
which failing, at last they framed a waxen
Image, and got a Thorn from a Tree that
bore Leaves, and stuck them upon the <HI>Pri∣vities</HI>
of the said Image, by which means
they accomplished their desire.</P>
<P>This being done according to her expecta∣tion,
she repairs to her House at <HI>Chartley,</HI>
and thither the <HI>Earl</HI> comes to her. But
whether the <HI>Earl</HI> was more lusty than she
expected, or what other accident happen∣ed,
it is unknown. Nevertheless she grew
jealous of her Acts, and falls into a great
Fear that all their Labour was lost; where∣upon
she wrote a Letter to Dr. <HI>Forman</HI> to
this effect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>This Letter coming to the Hands of the
old Master, procures a new attempt, and
now he goes and inchants a Nutmeg, and a
Letter, one to be given the Viscount in his
Drink, the other to be sent to him as a Pre∣sent;
these Things being accomplished, he
not long after died, leaving behind him
some of those Letters, whereby the Coun∣tess
had intercourse with him, in his Poc∣ket,
which gave some light into the Busi∣ness,
amongst which this aforesaid Letter
was one.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Forman</HI> being dead, Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> wan∣ted
one to assist her; whereupon at the
Countess's coming to <HI>London,</HI> one <HI>Gresham</HI>
was nominated to be entertained in this
Business, and in process of time was wholly
interested in it.</P>
<P>The Countess upon her return, sends
Gratulations to the Viscount, and with
<PB N="189" REF="194"/>
those the Letter sent her by Dr. <HI>Forman,</HI> he
reads it, and the more he reads it, the more
he is entangled, for no Man knows the
Mysteries that are contain'd in Evil Arts,
and who can withstand the Mischiefs that
are in evil Tongues? Whereupon he re∣turns
Answer, and new Places of meeting
are assign'd; amongst the rest, one at <HI>Ham∣mersmith</HI>;
in the mean Time the Viscount
makes dispatch of his Business, leaves Things
half done, half undone, to the intent he
might meet her, who had there stay'd for
his coming above Two Hours, and being
met, they solemnly saluted each other,
fell into divers Discourses, and insinuating
<HI>Phrases,</HI> from <HI>Words</HI> to <HI>Deeds,</HI> and from
<HI>speaking</HI> to <HI>acting</HI> the Sin of Venery.</P>
<P>The Countess having obtained that she
desired, and the Viscount caught in the Net
of Adulation; the more he striveth to be
loose, is caught the faster; so that Lust ha∣ving
by this means got liberty, being cover∣ed
with Greatness, like a Fire concealed in
a pile of rotten Wood, burst forth in all
loosness and licentiousness, Places of more
frequent, and private Meetings are conclu∣ded
upon between them; Persons fitting
for their Purposes being acquainted with
their Proceedings; watch-words are given;
all Things having relation to a certain end,
make them the <HI>bolder,</HI> and more safely to
accomplish that which both Time and Me∣mory
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>
cannot demonstrate in former Histo∣ries;
now these good Parts, which seemed
heretofore to be hopeful in the Viscount,
consume to Cinders, and the Corruption
remains to brand him in the Forehead for
his <HI>evil living</HI>; his Modesty becomes eclip∣sed,
his Behaviour light, his Carriage un∣seemly;
in his Place nothing so costly; no
Attire so uncouth, but at all Costs and Char∣ges
he obtains it for the increase of Favour;
new Fashions are produced, that so he
might shew more beautiful and fair, and
that his favour and personage might be
made manifest to the World; and to this
purpose <HI>yellow Bands, dusted Hair, curled,
crisped, frisled, slicked Skins, open'd Breasts,</HI>
beyond accustomed <HI>modesty,</HI> with many o∣ther
inordinate <HI>Attires,</HI> were worn on both
sides, to the shew of the World; so that
for the increase of dishonest Appetites,
they were abundantly practised; surfeiting
thus upon their <HI>Pleasure,</HI> having been be∣fore
accustomed unto hardiness, causeth
him to fall into all manner of forgetfulness,
letting all Things go to wrack, careless in
<HI>Attendance,</HI> neglecting <HI>State Affairs,</HI> igno∣rant
of his own Worth, subjecting himself
to the lustful Appetite of an evil Woman;
accounting no Time well spent, nor Hour
deem'd so happy, as when <HI>dalliance</HI> and plea∣sant
Discourses pass between them, either
in Words or Writing.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196"/>
Time could no longer conceal these se∣cret
Meetings, but at length the Marriage
of the Viscount and Countess were brought
to light, which when made publick, every
one declaimed against her, but extoll'd the
Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>; however, an Order was
forthwith sent to him to repay her Portion
of 5000<HI>l,</HI> to do which he was forced to sell
part of his Estate, thereunto willingly con∣senting,
that he might get rid of her. The
King nevertheless continues his Favour to
the Viscount, and install'd him Earl of <HI>So∣merset.</HI>
But at last the joint Wickedness of
all these Accomplices broke out in the Mur∣der
of <HI>Overbury,</HI> upon which occasion, the
following Letters found in Dr. <HI>Forman</HI>'s
Closet after his Death, were produc'd in
Court at Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI>'s Arraignment, by the
Doctor's Widow.</P>

There were also shewed in Court certain
Pictures of a Man and Woman in Copulati∣on,
made in Lead, as also the Mould of
Brass, wherein they were cast, a black
Scarf also full of white Crosses, which Mrs.
<HI>Turner</HI> had in her Custody; at the shewing
of these, and inchanted Papers and other
Pictures in Court, there was heard a crack
from the Scaffolds, which caused great fear,
tumult, and confusion among the Specta∣tors,
and throughout the Hall, every one
fearing hurt, as if the Devil had been pre∣sent,
and grown angry to have his Work∣manship
shewed, by such as were not his
own Scholars; and this Terror coming, a∣bout
a quarter of an Hour after silence pro∣claimed,
the rest of the cunning Tricks
were likewise shewed.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Forman</HI>'s Wife being Administratix of
her Husband, found Letters in Packets, by
which much was discovered; she was in
Court, and deposed that Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> came
to her House immediately after her Hus∣band's
Death, and did demand certain Pi∣ctures
which were in her Husband's Study;
namely, one Picture in Wax, very sumptu∣ously
apparalled in Silks and Sattins, as also
one other sitting in form of a naked Woman,
spreading, and laying forth her Hair in a
Looking-glass, which Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> did con∣fidently
affirm to be in a Box, and that she
knew in what part or room of the Study
they were.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="200"/>
Mrs. <HI>Forman</HI> further deposeth, that Mrs.
<HI>Turner</HI> and her Husband would be sometimes
three or four Hours locked up in his Study
together. She did depose further, that her
Husband had a Ring would open like a
Watch.</P>
<P>There was also a Note shewed in Court,
made by Dr. <HI>Forman,</HI> and written in Parch∣ment,
signifying what Ladies loved what
Lords in the Court, but the Lord Chief Ju∣stice
would not suffer it to be read openly in
the Court.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> sent <HI>Margaret,</HI> her Maid, to
Mrs. <HI>Forman,</HI> and wished that all such Let∣ters
and Papers as concerned the Earl of <HI>So∣merset,</HI>
or the Countess of <HI>Essex,</HI> or any o∣ther
great Personages, should be burned,
telling her that the Council's Warrant should
come to search the Study, and that all his
Goods might be seized; whereupon she and
her Maid <HI>Margaret,</HI> with the Consent of
Mrs. <HI>Forman,</HI> burnt divers Letters and Pa∣pers,
but yet she kept some without their
privity.</P>
<P>There were also Inchantments shewed in
Court, written in <HI>Parchment,</HI> wherein were
contained all the Names of the Blessed Tri∣nity,
mentioned in the Scriptures; and in
another Parchment, + <HI>B.</HI> + <HI>C.</HI> +. <HI>D.</HI> +
<HI>E.</HI> and in a third likewise in Parchment were
written all the Names of the Holy Trini∣ty;
as also a Figure, in which was written
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
this word, <HI>Corpus,</HI> and upon the Parchment
was fastned a little piece of the Skin of a
Man.</P>
<P>In some of these Parchments, the Devils
had particular Names, who were conjured
to torment the Lord <HI>Somerset,</HI> and Sir <HI>Ar∣thur
Manwaring,</HI> if their Loves should not
continue, the one to the Countess, the other
to Mrs. <HI>Turner.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, These faithful Servants of the
<HI>Devil</HI> obtain'd the due Reward of their
Deeds. Mrs. <HI>Turner</HI> was serv'd first, who
being found guilty of the barbarous Murder
committed upon Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury,</HI> was
Condemn'd for the same, and Hang'd at
<HI>Tyburn</HI> on <HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 10. 1615.
Sir <HI>Jarvis Ellowis</HI> was likewise Hang'd for
the same on <HI>Monday, November</HI> the 20th
following. The Viscount and Countess
were likewise found guilty of the said Mur∣der,
for which they were committed to the
<HI>Tower</HI>; and although the King pardon'd
them, they in a short Time pined away
their Lives, dying in the utmost Disgrace.
At this Time my Lord of <HI>Somerset</HI> little
thought to have been laid in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and
made Heir of <HI>Overbury</HI>'s Bed-chamber;
but by this Course we may see, That <HI>all
Things are in the Hands of God.</HI></P>
