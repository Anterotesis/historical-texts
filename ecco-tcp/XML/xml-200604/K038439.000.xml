<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER returning my thanks to the performers of this Farce, for the great justice they have done me, I must beg leave to address my∣self in particular to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>As your wishes produced the piece, and your performance has raised it into some consequence, to whom can it be so properly address'd? You were before rank'd in the first class of our Theatrical Genuises, and now you have the additional merit of trans∣forming the GRECIAN DAUGHTER into
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
the IRISH WIDOW, that is, of sinking <HI>to the lowest note, from the top of the compass!</HI></P>
<P>Permit me, Madam, like other Cox∣combs, to boast some favours I have received—You perform the principal character, some news-papers have criticis'd the Farce, and the audiences have laugh'd heartily at it. Were not I as sensible as the severest Cri∣tick of them all, that it is a triffle not worth the owning, I should subscribe my real name, instead of,</P>

<P>IS he gone out? his card tells me to come di∣rectly—I did but lock up some papers, take my hat and cane, and away I hurried.</P>

<P>My master desires you will sit down, he will return immediately,—he had some Business with his lawyer, and went out in great haste, leaving the message I have deliver'd. Here is my young master. <STAGE>Exit <HI>Servant.</HI></STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What lively BILLY!—hold I beg your pardon—melancholy WILLIAM I think—here's fine revolu∣tion—I hear your Uncle who was last month all gravity, and you all mirth, have chang'd charac∣ters;
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
he is now all spirit, and you are in the dumps young man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for the same reason—This journey to Scar∣borough will unfold the riddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, in plain English, and before your Uncle comes—explain the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place I am undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>In love I know—I hope your Uncle is not un∣done too—that would be the devil!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has taken possession of him in every sense. In short he came to Scarborough to see the lady I had fallen in love with—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And fell in love himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and with the same lady:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the devil indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Mr. BATES! when I thought my happiness compleat, and wanted only my Uncle's consent, to give me the independance he so often has promis'd me, he came to Scarborough for that purpose, and wish'd me joy of my choice; but in less than a week, his approbation turned into a passion for her; he now hates the sight of me, and is resolv'd with the consent of the father to make her his wife directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he keeps you out of your fortune, won't give his consent, which his Brother's foolish will requires, and he would marry himself the same wo∣man, because right, title, conscience, nature, jus∣tice, and every law divine and human, are against it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus he tricks me at once both of wife and for∣tune, without the least want of either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said friend WHITTLE! but it can't be, it shan't be, and it must not be—this is murder and robbery in the strongest sense, and he shan't be hang'd in chains to be laugh'd at by the whole town if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am distracted, the widow is distress'd, and we both shall run mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A widow too!—'gad a mercy three score and five!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But such a widow! she is now in town with her father, who wants to get her off his hands; 'tis equal to him who has her, so she is provided for—I hear somebody coming—I must away to her lodgings, where she waits for me to execute a scheme directly for our delivery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is her name BILLY?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>BRADY.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>BRADY! is not she Daughter to Sir PATRICK O NEALE?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. She was sacrific'd to the most sense∣less, drunken profligate in the whole country: He lived to run out his fortune, and the only advantage she got from the union was he broke that and his neck, before he had broke her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>The affair of marriage is in this country put upon the easiest footing; there is neither love or hate in the matter; necessity brings them together; they are united at first for their mutual conveni∣ence, and seperated ever after for their particular pleasures.—O rare matrimony!—Where does she lodge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Pall-Mall, near the Hotel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll call in my way, and assist at the consultation; I am for a bold stroke, if gentle methods should fail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a plan, and a spirited one, if my sweet widow is able to go through it—pray let us have your friendly assistance—ours is the cause of love and reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get you gone, with your love and reason, they seldom pull together now-a-days—I'll give your Uncle a dose first, and then I'll meet you at the widow's—what says your Uncle's privy counseller Mr. THOMAS to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is greatly our friend, and will enter sincerely into our service—he is honest, sensible, ignorant
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
and particular,—a kind of half coxcomb, with a thorough good heart—but he's here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you go about your business, and leave the rest to me. <STAGE>Exit <HI>Nephew.</HI></STAGE></P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>THOMAS.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Mr. THOMAS, I am glad to see you; upon my word you look charmingly—you wear well, Mr. Thomas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is a wonder, considering how the times go, Mr. BATES,—they'll wear and tear me too, if I don't take care of my self—my old master has taken the nearest way to wear himself out, and all that be∣long to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why surely this strange story about town is not true, that the old gentleman is fall'n in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten times worse than that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his horns—going to be married!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You never saw such an alter'd man in your born days!—he's grown young again; he frisks, and prances, and runs about, as if he had a new pair of legs—he has left off his brown camlet surtout, which he wore all summer, and now with his hat under his arm, he goes open breasted, and he dresses, and powders, and smirks so, that you would take
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
him for the mad Frenchman in Bedlam—some∣thing wrong in his upper story—would you think it?—he wants me to have a pig-tail!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Than he is far gone indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>As sure as you are there, Mr. BATES, a pig-tail!—we have had sad work about it—I made a com-promise with him, to wear these ruffled shirts which he gave me—but they stand in my way—I am not so listless with them—tho' I have ty'd up my hands for him, I won't tie up my head, that I am resolute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>This it is to be in love THOMAS?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may make free with himself, he shan't make a fool of me,—he has got his head into a bag but I won't have a pig-tail tack'd to mine—and so I told him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you tell him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That as I, and my father, and his father before me, had wore their own hair as heaven had sent it, I thought myself rather too old to set up for a monkey at my time of life, and wear a pig-tail—he! he! he!—he took it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>With a wry face, for it was wormwood:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes he was frump'd, and call'd me old block∣head, and would not speak to me the rest of the
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
day—but the next day he was at it again—he then put me into a passion—and I could not help telling him, that I was an Englishman born and had my prerogative as well as he, and that as long as I had breath in my body, I was for liberty, and a strait head of hair!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, THOMAS—he could not answer that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>The poorest man in England is a match for the greatest, if he will but stick to the laws of the land, and the statue books, as they are deliver'd down from us to our fore fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right—we must lay our wits together, and drive the widow out of your old master's head, and put her into your young master's hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart—nothing can be more meri∣torious—marry at his years! what a terrible ac∣count would he make of it, Mr. BATES?—let me see—on the debtor side 65—and per contra creditor a buxom widow of 23.—He'll be a bankrupt in a fortnight—he! he! he!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so he would, Mr. THOMAS—what have you got in your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pamphlet my old gentleman takes in—he has left off buying histories and religious pieces by numbers, as he us'd to do, and since he has got this widow in his head he reads nothing but the
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
Amorous Repository, Cupid's Revels, Call to Marriage, Hymen's Delights, Love lies a Bleed∣ing, Love in the Suds, and such like tender com∣positions.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here he comes with all his folly about him.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the first fool from vanity-fair—Heav'n help us!—love turns man and woman topsy-turvy!<STAGE>Exit <HI>THOMAS.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(without.)</STAGE> Where is he? where is my good friend?</P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>WHITTLE.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Ha! here he is—give me your hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to see you in such spirits, my old gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so old neither—no man ought to be called old, friend BATES, if he is in health, spirits, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>In his senses—which I should rather doubt, as I never saw you half so frolicksome in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never too old to learn friend, and if I don't make use of my philosophy now, I may wear it out in twenty years—I have been always banter'd as of too grave a cast—you know when I study'd at Lincoln's-Inn, they used to call me Young Wisdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if they should now call you Old Folly, it will be a much worse name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No young jackanapes dares call me so, while I have this friend at my side— <STAGE>(touches his sword.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hero too! what in the name of common sense is come to you, my friend?—high spirits, quick honour, a long sword and a bag;—you want no∣thing but to be terribly in love, and sally forth knight of the Woeful Countenance, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. BATES—the ladies who are the best judges of countenances, are not of your opinion; and unless you'll be a little serious, I must beg pardon for giving you this trouble, and I'll open my mind to some more attentive friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, come unlock then, you wild, handsome, vigorous young dog you—I will please you if I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you never saw me look better FRANK, did you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, rather better forty years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What when I was at Merchant Taylor's School?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>At Lincoln's-Inn, TOM.</P>

<P>It can't be—I never disguise my age, and next February, I shall be fifty-four.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fifty-four! why I am sixty, and you always lick'd me at school—tho' I believe I could do as much for you now, and ecod I believe you deserve it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I am in my 55th year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you are—let me see—we were together at Cambridge, Anno Domini 25, which is near fifty years ago—you came to the college indeed surprizingly young, and what is more surprizing, by this calculation you went to school before you was born—you was always a forward child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see there is no talking or consulting with you in this humour, and so, Mr. BATES, when you are in temper to shew less of your wit, and more of your friendship, I shall consult with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fare you well my old boy—young fellow, I mean—when you have done sowing your wild oats, and have been blister'd into your right senses; when you have half kill'd yourself with being a beau, and return to your woollen caps, flannel waistcoats, worsted stockings, cork soles, and gal∣lochys, I am at your service again, so bon jour to you Monsieur Fifty-four, ha! ha!<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has certainly heard of my affair—but he is old and peevish—he wants spirit, and strength of constitution to conceive my happiness—I am in love with the widow, and must have her: Every man knows his own wants—let the world laugh, and my friends stare; let 'em call me imprudent, and
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
mad if they please. I live in good times, and among people of fashon, so none of my neigh∣bours, thank heaven, can have the assurance to laugh at me.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>KECK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right! ay, right as my leg, TOM! Life's nothing without love—hugh! hugh!—I'm happy as the day's long! my wife loves gadding, and I can't stay at home, so we are both of a mind—she's every night at one or other of the garden places; but among friends, I am a little afraid of the damp; hugh! hugh! hugh! she has got an Irish gentle∣man, a kind of cousin of hers, to take care of her; a fine fellow; and so good-natur'd—It is a vast com∣fort to have such a friend in a family!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, madam, there is no other way but to cast off your real character, and assume a feign'd one; it is an extraordinary occasion, and requires extraordinary measures; pluck up a spirit, and do it for the honour of your sex.</P>

<P>Don't make fine speeches; you men are strange creatures, you turn our heads to your purposes, and then despise us for the folly you teach us; 'tis hard to assume a character contrary to my disposi∣tion; I cannot get rid of my unfashionable preju∣dices, till I have been married in England some time, and liv'd among my betters.</P>

<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then? my sweet Widow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIDOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would desire you to run away with me as fast as you can; what a pity it is, that this money, which my heart despises, should hinder its happi∣ness, or that for want of a few dirty acres, a poor woman must be made miserable, and sacrificed twice to those who have them.</P>

<P>Heaven forbid! these exquisite sentiments en∣dear you more to me, and distract me with the dread of losing you.</P>
</SP>

<P>Young folks; let an old man who is not quite in love, and yet will admire a fine woman to the day of his death, throw in a little advice among your flames and darts.</P>

<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it can, if you will but exert it; my Uncle ador'd and fell in love with you, for your beauty, softness, and almost speechless reserve.

<P>There our taste differs, friend; I am for a lively smart girl in my house, hugh! hugh! to keep up my spirits, and make me merry; I don't admire dumb waiters, not I, no still-life for me; I love their prittle prattle, it sets me to sleep, and I can take a sound nap while my sally and her cousin, are running and playing about the house like young cats.</P>

<P>Indeed, Madam, I can't but say I am a little thoughtful—we take it by turns; you were very sorrowful a month ago for the loss of your husband, and that you could dry up your tears so soon, na∣turally makes me a little thoughtful.</P>

you have made yourself a kind of Jontleman by getting one; one runs out one way, and t'other runs in another, which makes them both meet at last, and keeps up the ballance of Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much oblig'd to you, Sir PATRICK; I am an old gentleman, you say true; and I was thinking—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I was thinking if you were ever so old, my daughter can't make you young again; she has as fine rich tick blood in her veins, as any in all Ire∣land. I wish you had a swate crater of a daugh∣ter like mine, that we might make a double cross of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be a double cross indeed!<STAGE>(aside.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I was miserable enough with my first wife, who had the devil of a spirit, and the very moddel of her daughter, yet a brave man never shrinks from danger, and I may have better luck another time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I am no brave man, Sir PATRICK, and I begin to shrink already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have bred her up in great subjiction; she is as tame as a young colt, and as tinder as a sucking chicken; you will find her a true Jontlewoman, and so knowing, that you can tache her nothing; she brings every thing but money, and you have enough of that, if you have nothing else, and that is what I call the ballance of things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have been considering your daughter's great deserts, and my great age—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a charming crater; I would venture to say that, if I was not her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, Sir, as I have been considering your daughter's great deserts, and as I own I have great demerits—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure you have, but you can't help that; and if my daughter was to mention any thing of a fleering at your age, or your stinginess, by the ballance of power but I would make her repate it a hundred times to your face, to make her asham'd of it; but mum, old gentleman, the devil a word of your infirmities will she touch upon; I have brought her up to softness, and to gentleness, as a kitten to new milk; she will spake nothing but no, and yes, as if she were dumb; and no tame rabbit or pigeon will keep house, or be more inga∣nious with her needle and tambourine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is vastly altered then, since I saw her last, or I have lost my senses, and in either case, we had much better, since I must speak plain, not come together—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Till you are married, you mean—with all my heart, it is the more gentale for that, and like our family: I never saw lady O'Nale, your mother-in-law, who poor crater is dead, and can never be a mother-in-law again, 'till the week before I married her, and I did not care if I had never seen her
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
then, which is a comfort too in case of death, or other accidents in life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you don't understand me, Sir PATRICK I say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say, how can that be, when we both spake English.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you mistake my meaning, and don't com∣prehend me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you don't comprehend yourself, Mr. WHIZZLE, and I have not the gift of prophecy, to find out after you have spoke, what never was in you.</P>

<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me intreat you to attend to me a little.</P>

<P>I do attend, man; I don't interrupt you—out with it.</P>

<P>My wife that is <HI>not</HI> to be—Zounds! will you hear me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be, or <HI>not</HI> to be, is that the question? I can swear too, if it wants a little of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir Patrick hear me. I confess myself un∣worthy of her; I have the greatest regard for you, Sir PATRICK; I should think myself honour'd by being in your family, but there are many reasons—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure there are many reasons, why an old man should not marry a young woman; but as that was your business and not mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have wrote a letter to your daughter, which I was in hopes you had seen, and had brought me an answer to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the devil, Mr. WIZZLE, do you make a letter-porter of me? Do you imagine, you dirty fellow with your cash, that Sir PATRICK O NALE would carry your letters; I would have you know that I despise letters and all that belong to 'em, nor would I carry a letter to the King, Heaven bless him, unless it came from myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Sir PATRICK, don't be in a passion for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it nothing to make a penny post-man of me? But I'll go to my daughter directly, for I have not seen her to day, and if I find that you have written any thing that I won't understand, I shall take it an affront to my family, and you shall either let out the noble blood of the O'NALES, or we will spill the last drop of the red puddle of the WIZZELS. <STAGE>(Going and returns.)</STAGE> Harkee, old Mr. WIZZLE, WHEEZLE, WHISTLE, what's your name? You must not stir till I come back; if you offer to ate, drink, or sleep, till my honour is satis∣fy'd, 'twill be the worst male you ever took in your life. You had better fast a year, and die at the end of six months, than dare to lave your house. So now, Mr. WEEZLE, you are to do as you plase. <STAGE>(Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now the devil is at work indeed! If some miracle
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
don't save me, I shall run mad like my Nephew, and have a long Irish sword through me into the bargain. While I am in my senses I won't have the woman; and therefore he that is out of them shall have her, if I give half my fortune to make the match. THOMAS!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all a judgement upon you; because your brother's foolish will says, the young man must have your consent; vou won't let him have her, but will marry the Widow yourself; that's the dog in the manger; you can't eat the oats, and won't let those who can.</P>

<P>I'll tell you what, Mr. WITTOL, were I not sure you deserv'd some pains, I would not have taken any pains for you; and don't imagine now, because I have gone a little too far for the man I love, that I shall go a little too far when I'm your wife; in∣deed I shan't: I have done more than I should be∣fore I am your wife, because I was in despair; but I won't do as much as I may, when I am your wife, tho' every Irish woman is fond of imitating her English betters.</P>

<SPEAKER>WIDOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Mr. WHITTOL, your family loves kissing better than fighting; he swears I am as like my sister, as two pigeons: I could excuse his raptures, for I had rather fight the best friend I have, than slobber and salute him a la francoise.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Mr. Whizzle, you'll excuse my coming back to give you an answer, without having any to give; I hear a grate dale of news about myself, and came to know if it be true; they say my son is in London, when he tells me himself by letter here, that he's at Limerick; and I have been with my daughter to tell her the news, but she would not stay at home to receave it, so I am come—O <HI>gra ma chree my little din ousil craw,</HI> what have we got here? a piece of mummery! here is my son and daughter too, fait; what are you waring the breeches, PAT, to see how they become you when you are Mrs. Weezel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIDOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon for that, Sir! I wear them be∣fore marriage, because, I think they become a woman better than after.</P>

<P>What, is not this your son?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but it is my daughter, and that is the same thing.</P>

<P>Mighty well! and, I suppose <HI>you</HI> have not lost your wits, young man!</P>

<P>I simpathize with you, Sir; we lost 'em together, and found 'em at the same time.</P>

<P>Here's villainy! Mr. BATES, give me the paper; not a farthing shall they have 'till the law gives it 'em.</P>

<P>He may take his own, but he shan't have a six∣pence of the five thousand pounds I promis'd him.</P>

<P>What, am I chous'd again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should not my friend be chous'd out of a little justice for the first time? Your hard usage has sharpen'd your Nephew's wits, therefore beware, don't play with edge-tools—you'll only cut your fingers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your trote too, which is all one; therefore, to make all asy, marry my daughter first, and then quarrel with her afterwards; that will be in the natural course of things.</P>

<P>I wish you joy, Sir; the best think could have happen'd to you; and as a faithful servant I have done my best to check you.</P>

<P>To check me!</P>

<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were galloping full speed and down hill too, and if we had not laid hold of the bridle, being a bad jockey, you would have hung by the horns in the stirrup, to the great joy of the whole town.</P>

<P>What have <HI>you</HI> help'd to trick me?</P>

<P>Into happiness: You have been foolish a long while, turn about and be wise; he has got the woman and his estate, give them your blessing, which is not worth much, and live like a christian for the future.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will if I can; but I can't look at 'em; I can't bear the sound of my voice, nor the sight of my face: Look ye, I am distress'd, and distracted! and can't come to yet; I will be reconcil'd if possible; but don't let me see or hear from you, if you would have me forget and forgive you—I shall never lift up my head again!<STAGE>(Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIDOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir PATRICK, that my preferring the Nephew to the Uncle will meet with your approba∣tion; though we have not so much money, we shall have more love; one mind and half a purse, in marriage, are much better than two minds and
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
two purses. I did not come to England, nor keep good company, till it was too late to get rid of my country prejudices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are out of my hands, PAT, so if you won't trouble me with your afflictions, I shall sincerely rejoice at your felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NEPHEW.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a great abatement of my present joy, could I believe that this lady should be assisted in her happiness, or be supported in her afflictions by any one but her lover and her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> PATRICK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine notions are fine tings, but a fine estate gives every ting but idaas, and them too, if you'll appale to those who help you to spend it—what say you, Widow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIDOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your, and their permission, I will tell them to this good company; and for fear my words should want ideas too, I will add an Irish tune to 'em, that may carry off a bad voice, and bad matter.</P>
