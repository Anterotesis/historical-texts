<P>THIS short Account of Inoculating the Small-Pox,
bating the later Cases annexed, was ready for the
Press some four Months since, and would then have been
Published, had not their <HI>Royal Highnesses</HI> (at whose
Command the Operation at <HI>Newgate</HI> was performed) been
all this while generously intending further to oblige the
Publick, by encouraging and promoting other Trials of that
kind, both upon Parish Children and grown Persons. But
<HI>these,</HI> for certain Reasons having hitherto been obstructed, if
yet they shall be brought to bear, Care will be taken in
due Time to give the World a true and faithful Relation
of them; or failing them, of any other observable Cases
in this Practice.</P>
<P>It has also been thought fit, for a further Confirmation
of the Truth, to subjoin some <HI>Certificates</HI> from the Coun∣try,
under the Hands of the Persons immediately con∣cerned:
Those Trials not having been made, as the
others here related were, in the Presence of any one or
more of the <HI>London</HI> Physicians.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. Maitland's
ACCOUNT
Of INOCULATING the
SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING understood, since my
Retirement into the Country,
that the late Experiment of
Inoculating the Small-Pox at
<HI>Newgate,</HI> has been pretty much
talk'd of; and finding withal, that the
Reports of that Matter are various, and
oftentimes contradictory: I thought it be∣came
me, to give the Publick a plain and
honest Account of the Truth of Facts;
both to prevent, if possible, any one's being
impos'd upon, as to the Trials already
made; or sear'd from the Practice of <HI>it</HI> for
the future.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
'Tis not here my Design to offer an
Essay on the Theory of the Small-Pox; or
to attempt the best Methods of Cure: I
leave that to the learned Gentlemen of the
Profession; who, I do not question, not∣withstanding
all their best Discoveries and
Observations hitherto made, will certainly
agree with me, That <HI>it</HI> is a Distemper of
the most fatal and destructive kind; and
that, far from being possess'd of any infal∣lible
Method or Remedy, they will own,
'tis many Times too too hard for them, and
very often baffles the most celebrated Skill.</P>
<P>They cannot then be offended, (I am
sure the better and more candid Part of
the Faculty will not) if, out of a single
View of doing good, I here publish to the
World a certain Method of Relieving Man∣kind,
and rescuing them from the Fears
and fatal Effects of that very loathsome
and malignant Disease.</P>
<P>The Method I here propose, is no other
than that very plain one of raising the
<HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation.</HI> A Method,
new indeed, and utterly unknown here,
till of late, tho' universally practis'd with
Success all over <HI>Turky</HI> these threescore
Years past; and in other Parts of the <HI>East,</HI>
an hundred, or, for ought we know, some
hundreds of Years before. The Practice
having thus obtain'd amongst an illiterate
Sort of People, what I here offer to recom∣mend
<HI>it,</HI> shall be delivered in the plainest
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
Manner, and suited to the meanest Capa∣city,
without the labour'd Embellishments
of Learning or Eloquence: And indeed,
one would think, these should not be here
wanted, to reconcile to this very safe and
useful Method, even Persons or a higher
Rank, and more delicate Taste; especially
since they, of all Sorts of People, generally
speaking, suffer the most; witness the Ha∣vock
made in great Families, not many
Months since, by that Mighty Disease,
which seem'd then to go forth like a de∣stroying
Angel, subduing all before it, and
contemning all human Means us'd to stop
<HI>its</HI> Career.</P>
<P>It may therefore be hoped, that This
Practice should meet with a kind Reception
even by them, who, of all others, are most
terribly fearful of the prodigious Loath∣someness
of the Distemper, and of the ugly
and monstrous Effects <HI>it</HI> leaves, both on
them, and their Children: Yet being ap∣prehensive,
that Sloth and Laziness, ill∣placed
Affection and Tenderness, and it
may be, some worse Dispositions too, which
I am not willing to suggest, may possibly
stifle this safe and useful Method in its
Birth; I shall here take a little Pains to
obviate the Scruples and Objections, which
are commonly rais'd against <HI>it.</HI> And in
Order to this, shall, first of all, give a
Short and Historical Account of what I
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
have seen and practis'd, both in <HI>Turky</HI> and
at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1717, when I had the Ho∣nour
to attend the <HI>English</HI> Ambassador and
his Family at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> I had a fair
Opportunity fully to inform my self of
what I had long before heard, namely, the
famous Practice of <HI>Transplanting,</HI> or raising
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>My Enquiry chiefly turn'd upon two or
three Particulars, which, I thought, could
I be well satisfied in, would go a great way
towards convincing me of the mighty Ad∣vantages
and Safety of the Method, and
resolving my greatest Scruples and Difficul∣ties
against <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>Having heard that this contagious Dis∣ease,
which for many Centuries of Years
has prov'd such a terrible Scourge to Man∣kind,
had its first Rise in <HI>Egypt, Arabia,</HI>
and other Parts of the <HI>East,</HI> I thought it
proper to enquire, <HI>First,</HI> Whether it conti∣nues
still to rage in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions
in that violent Manner it was anciently
observ'd to do; and as at times, <HI>it</HI> is known
to attack us here, and most other Parts
of <HI>Europe:</HI> For should <HI>it</HI> be found to be
always of a milder and more temperate
Sort than ours, why should that People
take so very strange and uncommon a Way
to avoid <HI>it?</HI> I quickly found the Case to
be quite otherwise, being assur'd, besides
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
what I saw with my Eyes; that the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> is rather more Malignant and Epidemic
there, than with us; insomuch that, as
some have affirmed, one half, or at least
one third Part of the Diseased, at certain
Times, do die of <HI>it</HI>; and they that escape,
are terribly disfigur'd by it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid., D. Timoni &amp; Pylarini Epist.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Again, I enquired what were the Sym∣ptoms
which attend, this new and strange
Operation? And whether the Issue is al∣ways
known to be salutary? The Dis∣order
both before and after the Eruption
was so very slight and gentle, that, in
Strictness of Speech, it could not be called
a Disease, having none of the usual Com∣plaints
of Pain in the Back, Vomitings,
Head-achs, Thirst, Inquietude, and the
like, the Pulse being only somewhat fuller
and higher than before; yet so far from a
Fever, that it scarce deserves the Name of
a <HI>Febricula,</HI> bating some singular Instances,
which are so rare, that they are not One
to a Thousand. And last of all, which I
thought not a little material, The Pustules,
whether many or few, (and they common∣ly
were from 10 to an 100, sometimes more)
never left any Marks or Pits behind them,
except only in the Incisions, or Parts In∣grafted.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
But still I had one Difficulty left, which
I took to be the most considerable; and
which, if not fully clear'd, would render,
in my Opinion, the whole of the Process
but trifling and precarious: And that is,
whether every one who has undergone this
Operation, is really secured against all fu∣ture
Danger of catching the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by
Infection? Were I but well assur'd of this,
I should then, I thought, be at Liberty to
practise <HI>it</HI> my self, and likewise with Con∣fidence
recommend <HI>it</HI> to others. All my
Enquiries here were fully answered beyond
Expression: For I was assured by all, and
they could have no Design to impose upon
me, that there was not an Instance known
of any one's being ever infected, who had
had any Pustules at all, how few so ever
rais'd by <HI>Inoculation</HI>; tho' for a further
Trial, several had been once and again
Ingrafted; and others also had been con∣fined
to the Room, and in the same Bed
too with the Infected. This I rejoiced to
hear, and from thence concluded the Pra∣ctice
to be universally safe and useful. And
indeed wonder'd not a little, that, not∣withstanding
the Authentic Accounts there∣of
more than once transmitted into <HI>England,</HI>
there had never been hitherto any fair
and full Trial made of it.</P>
<P>Hence also I could not forbear admiring
the very great Sagacity of the Men who
first invented this Method; and the lau∣dable
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
and diligent Observation of them
too, who so carefully practis'd it themselves,
and so faithfully convey'd it to their Neigh∣bours:
They all indeed were sensible of
the Benefit, and found their Account in it.</P>
<P>About this Time, the Ambassador's in∣genious
Lady, who had been at some Pains
to satisfie her Curiosity in this Matter, and
had made some useful Observations on the
Practice, was so thoroughly convinced of
the Safety of it, that <HI>She</HI> resolv'd to sub∣mit
<HI>her</HI> only Son to it, a very hopeful Boy
of about Six Years of Age: She first of all
order'd me to find out a fit Subject to take
the Matter from; and then sent for an old
<HI>Greek</HI> Woman, who had practis'd this Way
a great many Years: After a good deal
of Trouble and Pains, I found a proper
Subject, and then the good Woman went
to work; but so awkwardly by the shak∣ing
of her Hand, and put the Child to so
much Torture with her blunt and rusty
Needle, that I pitied his Cries, who had
ever been of such Spirit and Courage, that
hardly any Thing of Pain could make him
cry before; and therefore Inoculated the
other Arm with my own Instrument, and
with so little Pain to him, that he did not
in the least complain of it. The Opera∣tion
took in both Arms, and succeeded
perfectly well. After the third Day, bright
red Spots appear'd in his Face, then dis∣appear'd;
and thus interchangeably (as it
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
commonly happens) till in the Night be∣twixt
the Seventh and Eighth Day, he
was observed to be a little hot and thirsty,
yet remain'd so but a few Hours; and then
the <HI>Small Pox</HI> came out fair: They be∣came
round and yellow, like those of the
more gentle distinct kind; and the Red
Spots which appeared first, were the fullest
and largest of all: They began to crust
a few Days after, and then gently died
away; so that the young Gentleman was
quickly in a Condition to go Abroad with
Safety. He had above an hundred in all
upon his Body; but without any the least
Disorder but what I have mentioned:
And they all fell off, without leaving any
one Mark or Impression behind them. This
Operation was performed at <HI>Pera</HI> near <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
in the Month of <HI>March</HI> 1717.</P>
<P>The Honourable Lady abovementioned,
who had been happily delivered of a Daugh∣ter
some three Months before, seeing the
great Success of the Operation upon her
Son, had a Mind to have it tried also
upon the Infant: But this, for certain Rea∣sons,
was then laid aside, and I hope very
luckily, being reserv'd to set the First and
Great Example to <HI>England,</HI> of the perfect
Safety of this Practice, and especially to
Persons of the First Rank and Quality,
who have ever suffer'd so much by that
fatal Distemper.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
This Noble Lady sent for me last <HI>April,</HI>
and when I came, she told me, she was
now resolved to have her Daughter Ino∣culated,
and desir'd me forthwith to find
out Matter for the Purpose. I pleaded
for a Delay of a Week or two, the Wea∣ther
being then cold and wet; for indeed,
I was unwilling to venture on an Experi∣ment
altogether new and uncommon here,
in a cold Season; tho' I am now convinc'd
it may, with due Care, be practis'd at all
Times and Seasons, but still with more
Safety in the temperate and favourable.
I also pray'd, that any two Physicians,
whom they thought fit, might be call'd,
not only to consult the Health and Safety
of the Child, but likewise to be Eye∣witnesses
of the Practice, and contribute to
the Credit and Reputation of it. This
indeed was at first deny'd me, it may be,
out of a Design to keep it secret, or least
it should come to nothing.</P>
<P>In the mean time having found proper
Matter, I ingrafted it in both Arms, after
the usual Manner; the Child was neither
blooded nor purg'd before, nor indeed was
it necessary, considering the clean Habit
of Body, and the very cool, regular Diet
she had ever been kept to from her In∣fancy.
She continued easie and well,
without any sensible Alteration, bateing
the usual little Spots and Flushings, till
the tenth Night, when she was observ'd
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
to be a little hot and Feverish. An an∣cient
Apothecary in the Neighbourhood
being then call'd, prudently advis'd not
to give the Child any Medicine, assuring
them there was no Danger, and that the
Heat would quickly abate, which accord∣ingly
it did; and the Small Pox began
next Morning to appear, which was indeed
some two Days later than usual, by rea∣son
of the uncommon Discharge of Matter
at the Incisions from the Beginning. Three
learned Physicians of the College were ad∣mitted,
one after another, to visit the
young Lady; they are all Gentlemen of
Honour, and will on all Occasions declare,
as they have hitherto done, that they saw
<HI>Miss Wortley</HI> playing about the Room,
chearful and well, with the Small Pox
rais'd upon her; and that in a few Days
after she perfectly recover'd of them. Se∣veral
Ladies, and other Persons of Distin∣ction,
visited also this young Patient, and
can attest the Truth of this Fact. I need
not here be more particular in determining
the several Periods of this Cafe, they being
the very same with that abovementioned;
except only that here the Pustules were
not so many, nor did they ripen so soon;
which may be easily accounted for, with∣out
having Regard to the Difference of
Climates, for there is little or nothing in
that, seeing the <HI>Circassians,</HI> and others
inhabiting the Banks of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
a Climate much colder and more difficult
than ours, practise <HI>it</HI> with Safety.</P>
<P>Another Instance I shall give for the
further Confirmation of this Practice; name∣ly,
one of the learned Physicians above∣mentioned,
who had visited <HI>Miss Wortley,</HI>
having some Years since fully inform'd him∣self
of this Method of Practice, and being
thoroughly satisfied of the Safety and
Reasonableness of it, at length resolved
to try it in his own Family: He had for∣merly
lost some Children in a very malig∣nant
kind of the Small Pox, and therefore
desired me to lose no Time to ingraft the
only Son he had left. The Boy (who was
not quite Six Years of Age) being of a
pretty warm and sanguine Complexion, the
Doctor ordered about five Ounces of Blood
to be taken from him; and then, in ten
Days after, having found Matter which he
lik'd, I inoculated him in both Arms. This
was performed the 11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI>; next
Day having look'd at the Incisions, I found
them both inflam'd, which convinced me
the Thing had taken. Some Red Spots
appeared about his Temples the third
Day; and some two or three Pustules be∣tween
the seventh and eighth; the Boy
being all the while without any Thing of
Thirst, Head-ach, or any other Disorder,
only his Pulse was observ'd to be fuller
and quicker; and then about the 10<HI>th</HI> or
11<HI>th,</HI> some more Pustules appear'd round
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
and yellow; and in two or three Days
more dy'd away: The Incisions continuing
all the while inflamed, and discharging a
thick well-digested Matter.</P>
<P>Here I could bring a great many Cases
of Persons inoculated in <HI>Turky,</HI> to prove
the constant and certain Success of this
Practice; in all which I have never seen
any Miscarriage, except in One, which was
wholly owing to the Rashness and Inadver∣tence
of a Surgeon at <HI>Constantinople.</HI> I
would not here be thought to pretend to
a Secret, or to make a Mystery of this
Operation; no, my Design is, only to advise
every one that attempts it to be cautious:
For ill Consequences may sometimes hap∣pen,
and never more than in Things com∣mon
and easy, and adapted to vulgar Ca∣pacities.
In it self indeed it is simple and
obvious, and may, like other plain Chi∣rurgical
Operations, be in a manner Me∣chanically
learn'd and practis'd: For, not
to mention several Surgeons, whose Business
it is; I knew an old <HI>Greek</HI> Woman, who,
having been taught it from her Youth, had
practised it with Success a great many Years.</P>
<P>Hence, if any Regard be due to Facts,
and to the most certain Observation and
Experience of others; which, in Matters
of Practice, have ever been counted the
best and surest Direction; I am perswaded,
all impartial People will allow this Method
to be not only safe, but useful; and highly
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
worthy to be receiv'd with Esteem and
Applause. Is it not a Matter of the greatest
Importance to us, to know how to prevent
the mighty Contagion of the Small Pox;
and how to preserve our Children and Fa∣milies
from the violent Attacks, and fatal
Effects of it? What would not tender
Parents give to secure to them the Lives
and Features of their beloved Offspring;
when they behold them disfigured by the
loathsome Disease, and struggling with the
Pangs of Death? Do not we oftentimes
see great Families extinguish'd by it, as by
the Plague, and their Titles and Estates
thereby transmitted to Strangers? And if
they have the good Fortune to escape with
their Lives, what an ugly Change from
what they were before? What Pittings,
Seams, and Scars in their Faces? What
Films and Fistula's, and sometimes Blind∣ness
in their Eyes? What Ulcers and Im∣posthumes
in their Bodies; Contractions of
the Nerves, and even Lameness for Life?
Again, to avoid the Infection, what Un∣easiness
and Disquiet of Mind, what Fears
and Apprehensions do not even grown Peo∣ple
labour under, especially the more de∣licate
and tender? Don't they renounce
all Commerce with their best Friends and
dearest Relations? And if by chance they
meet an Object that has but lately reco∣ver'd,
how susceptible then are they of
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
the Distemper? And how few thus seiz'd
do ever escape?</P>
<P>In short then, to prevent all these, and
many the like Calamities, the almost univer∣sal
and inevitable Consequences of this
fatal Disease; I may truly venture to af∣firm,
that the Method here recommended
is, of all others hitherto known, the safest;
and I am sure far more infallible, than
that of the most learned and most cautious
Practice.</P>
<P>I have, however, in Conversation, met
with several Scruples and Objections against
this Method; some whereof relate to the
manner of the Operation; which, I hope,
by the Account already given, are in some
measure satisfy'd: Some again concern the
Lawfulness of it; and others would even
seem to question the Fact, denying that
the Small Pox are hereby rais'd; or that
the Eruptions ought to be deem'd of that
kind; since they are not preceded by a
Fever, nor attended with the usual Pe∣riods
of the Distemper.</P>
<P>They that scruple the Lawfulness of this
Practice, are apt to call it, a Presumption,
a forcing of Nature, a tempting of Provi∣dence,
and the like. True indeed, were
the Operation in it self dangerous; and
the Issue generally doubtful, as several,
both in Physick and Surgery sometimes are,
yet neither presumptuous nor unlawful for
all that; I should be ready to own the
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
Charge, and yield it at once to the tender∣hearted
and the scrupulous: But pray,
what are they afraid of? Is there any
Thing here frightful, or shocking to the
nicest and the most delicate? The Practice
is most plain, rational, and easie, intended
only to prevent the malignant Infection,
and to preserve Life: not to give a Disease,
and in this Sense, to force Nature before
its Time; but in effect, to cleanse Nature
from the latent <HI>Fomes</HI> or <HI>Seminium</HI>; and
to secure against that popular Contagion.
We have heard, and indeed it were much
to be wish'd we had any that truly deserve
the Name, of Preservatives against the
Plague; And why may not <HI>This,</HI> which has
elsewhere been so universally tried and ap∣proved,
pass for One against the Small Pox?</P>
<P>But again, what do they mean by tempt∣ing
of Providence? Can they imagine,
that using the fair and proper Means of
avoiding and preventing a Disease, is often∣sive
to Providence? Why then do they
Bleed, Vomit, or Purge, or use any other
Remedy, to prevent a Fever? And why
don't they trust that Providence, rather than
dare to abandon their Families, and desert
the Distressed, to flee from <HI>this</HI> or any
other Disease? Nay, so far am I from
counting this Method tempting to Provi∣dence,
that I rather esteem it a Motive of
Thankfulness to the divine Providence, and
a great one too, for, the Discovery.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19"/>
As to the Objection against the <HI>Fact,</HI> de∣nying
the Small Pox to be hereby rais'd:
Did the Eruptions come the natural and
common way, I acknowledge it to be highly
reasonable: For the only way we have to
distinguish between the genuine Small Pox
of the several kinds, and the spurious, or
what they call the <HI>Chicken Pox,</HI> is not only
by observing the Nature and Periods of the
Pustules, but also by the first Invasion, and
subsequent Progress of the Fever, and of
the usual Symptoms attending it. The
known Periods of the Small Pox are diffe∣rent,
according to their different kinds;
and this Difference ariseth, not only from
the various Dispositions of the Juices and
Habits of the Bodies affected; but likewise
from the different Degrees and Qualities
of the External Infection, howsoever com∣municated,
as it is more or less subtil,
malignant and epidemic.</P>
<P>Now in <HI>those</HI> rais'd by Inoculation, the
Periods, tho' a little different from the com∣mon
and natural, are, in their kind, as
certain and regular as the other: A Dif∣ference
indeed is observ'd of sometimes two
or three Days, as to the Time of Eruption;
but that is no more than what is common
in the natural Sort. And thus too, it is
with Respect to the other Stages of the
Disease: I mean those of the Invasion,
Maturation, and Declination; they are
equal and regular, and what is more, the
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
Process is certain, and the Prognostick in∣fallible.</P>
<P>But the principal and most material Dif∣ference
of all lies in the <HI>Fever,</HI> which here
is so gentle, that it hardly deserves the
Name; but in the natural, and especially
the confluent kind, 'tis always violent, and
often the immediate Cause of Death.</P>
<P>Were it not altogether foreign to my
Design, and inconsistent with the Brevity
I here propose, I could easily demonstrate
the Cause of this Difference; and make
it appear, that the small Quantity of the
Matter inserted into the Capillary Vessels
of the Skin, is not capable of altering or
dissolving the Mass of Blood, as it happens
in the Case of Infection; nor of raising an
Ebullition sufficient to produce a Fever, and
the dangerous Symptoms which always fol∣low
upon it: And yet it is certain, not∣withstanding
all this, that the Matter thus
inserted does produce Eruptions of the right
Small Pox kind, with good digested Matter,
as hereafter describ'd; and without any
Thing of the Danger and Loathsomeness,
ever inseparable from the other.</P>
<P>That it is the right and genuine kind,
may be further prov'd beyond all Exception,
by a few plain Instances here subjoin'd;
by which it will appear, that the Small
Pox thus rais'd by Inoculation, is truly in∣fectious
and catching; and that several
Adult Persons, who never before had them,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
have been actually seiz'd, by means of kissing
and caressing a Child, not quite three Years
of Age, while the Eruptions thus rais'd
were upon it. What stronger Proof can
reasonably be desired of the genuine Small
Pox? And what need is there of more
Words or Arguments to convince any one,
that will not be perswaded by Facts?</P>
<P>I am hastening to give you an Account
of those Facts, and do assure you, it shall
be an honest and a true one. But before
I come to it, I wou'd briefly take notice
of a Question or two, which a learned Phy∣sician,
one Day ask'd me, on the Subject.
As first, Whether I was always sure, thus
to give the Small Pox? And then, whe∣ther,
when given, I cou'd engage the Pa∣tient
should never take them again by In∣fection?</P>
<P>To the first, I answer'd, the Operation had
never yet fail'd me, or any one else, that
I know of; nor do I believe, it ever can,
when duly perform'd, but upon Persons who
have had them before: For I very much
question, what some have affirm'd, namely,
That there are People in the World, who
are not susceptible of the Disease. In the
mean time, I had a Mind, with great Sub∣mission,
to have ask'd the Doctor a plain
Question in Answer to his; and that is,
Whether, when he prescribes a Purge or a
Vomit, he is always sure, it will answer
his Intention? For I have often heard,
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
that Vomits have sometimes prov'd Purges;
and Purges, Vomits too; and, which is
worse, that People have had the Misfortune
to die under both Operations; which has
never yet happen'd, in the Case of Ingraft∣ing.</P>
<P>As to the Doctor's second Question, I have
said somewhat already; and now can add
further, that besides the frequent Experi∣ments
which have been made in <HI>Turky</HI>; as,
of Inoculating the fame Person a second
and a third Time, and the like; I my self
have lately made open and repeated Tryals,
on one of the Six Inoculated Criminals of
<HI>Newgate,</HI> reserved for that purpose, suffici∣ent
to convince any one, that there's no
Danger of their Catching the Disease by any
future Infection. This is, One <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Journal annex'd.</NOTE> <HI>Elizabeth
Harrison,</HI> of about nineteen Years of Age.
Here I must observe to you, that this Girl,
had the fewest Eruptions upon her, of any
of the five, that were Inoculated at <HI>Newgate,</HI>
but had a more than Ordinary Discharge
at the Incisions.</P>
<P>I first employ'd her as Nurse to a Servant
Maid, very ill and full of the continued-distinct
Kind of the Small Pox, in the House
of Mrs. <HI>Moss,</HI> in <HI>Christ's Hospital</HI> Buildings
at <HI>Hertford,</HI> whom she attended during the
whole Course of the Disease. This Maid
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
had hardly recover'd, when one of the Boys,
about ten Years Old, of the said Hospital,
was also seiz'd with the very same Sort; I
oblig'd her to lie every Night in the same Bed
with this Boy, and to attend him constantly
from the first Beginning of the Distemper to
the very End: And thus she continued for
Six Weeks together, without Intermission, or
feeling any the least Head-Ach or other Dis∣order;
tho', indeed, I once saw some Heats
and little Pimples upon her, as Nurses
commonly have under such Confinements.
There's no Ground to question this Fact,
being attested by a Cloud of Witnesses.</P>
<P>For a further Confirmation of what I
have said, I once intended to have here sub∣joyn'd
D. <HI>Timoni</HI> and <HI>Pylarini's</HI> Letters,
publish'd in the Philosophical Transactions,
No. 339 and 347. But being unwilling to
enlarge this Account beyond its just Bounds,
I must leave them to another Opportunity,
and withal take the Liberty to refer the
Reader to them.</P>

<P><HI>August</HI> 9. 1721. Being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> betwixt
the Hours of 9 and 10 in the Morning, I
made Incisions in both Arms and the right
Leg of all the Six.</P>
<P>10 <HI>and</HI> 11. <HI>Thursday</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> I find
little or no Alteration in any of them,
except <HI>Mary North,</HI> who sometimes was
troubled with Vapours, as usual to her:
They all sleep well, dress, and walk about
all day, and are hungry for their Food:
Their Pulse a little rais'd, but without any
sensible Disorder.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Saturday,</HI> In the Morning; observing
the Incisions not so much inflamed, and
tending to Suppuration as usual; and thence
suspecting the Matter ingrafted to have
been defective and languid, having been
kept at least 15 or 16 Hours, for a very
good, but unavoidable Reason; I search'd
for fresh Matter, and having found it in.
<HI>Christs Hospital,</HI> about 6 a Clock at Night
I made new Incisions in each Arm of five
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
of them, and ingrafted it as before. I had
no Matter left for the sixth, <HI>Evans.</HI></P>
<P>13. <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, these five complain
all of Pain in both Arms: Having taken
off the Dressings, I find all the first Incisions
inflamed and fester'd, but without any
Sickness in the Patients; their Pulse sen∣sibly
higher, and their Water turbid.</P>
<P>14. <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, red Spots and
Flushings appear on all the five; but most
of all on <HI>Mary North,</HI> especially about her
Face, Neck, and Breast: And so likewise
on <HI>Ann Tompion:</HI> But without any Sick∣ness,
Head-ach, or Thirst; except a little
they complained of in the Night; and a
higher Pulse.</P>
<P>15. <HI>Tuesday,</HI> The same Spots and Flush∣ings
appear fresh in the Morning; but turn
paler and darker towards Night, yet with∣out
any Disorder.</P>
<P>It is here to be observed, That the sixth,
<HI>viz. Richard Evans,</HI> who had had the
Small Pox in Prison last <HI>September,</HI> has had
no manner of Pain, Heat, or Inflammation
in any of his Incisions, nor any manner of
Alteration otherwise: But all continuing
pale from the Beginning, yesterday dry'd
up entirely.</P>
<P>16. <HI>Wednesday,</HI> They all continue much
as before, only their Incisions begin to dis∣charge
a thick, purulent Matter. <HI>Anne
Tompion</HI> has a large yellow Pustule on the
bending of her Thigh, and another on the
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
outside of her right, Arm, like Small Pox:
And <HI>John Alcock</HI> has more fresh Pustules
appearing on his Face and Arms; having
had a slight <HI>Febricula</HI> in the Night, with
disturb'd Water. And <HI>John Cawthery</HI> has
a large yellow Pustule on his left Cheek,
and several small ones on his Face.</P>
<P>17. <HI>Thursday,</HI> The said <HI>Alcock</HI> has these
Pustules appearing now fairly, with a yellow
digested Matter, and red Bottoms, and a
great many of them, but without Sickness.
<HI>Ann Tompion</HI> has the same yellow Pustules
on her right Arm and Thigh, with other
fresh ones struck out about her Chin and
Mouth.</P>
<P>18. <HI>Friday, Alcock's</HI> Small Pox appear
still fair and yellow, but fuller and larger,
with a bright red round them. All the
others much the same, with their Incisions
running.</P>
<P>19. <HI>Saturday,</HI> Last Night, this <HI>Alcock</HI> un∣accountably
pricks and opens all the Pustules
he could come at with a Pin; which occa∣sions
them to fall and crust sooner: But
they continue red at Bottom; and the Inci∣sions
in him abate of their Running.</P>
<P>It is here to be noted, that tho' he has had
by much the greatest Number of Pustules
or Small Pox upon him, yet the second
Time he was touch'd in one Arm only,
there not being Matter enough for the
other Arm; whereas the other four had
both Arms ingrafted, and Matter in Abun∣dance.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27"/>
20 <HI>and</HI> 21. <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Monday,</HI> All of
them continue as before: The Incisions
on the other four, run still a thick, digested,
yellow <HI>Pus.</HI></P>
<P>Here I must observe, that the second In∣cisions
in both Arms, by which a vast Dis∣charge
has been made, seem to me, in the
Issue, to have been rather a Prejudice and
Impediment to the <HI>Eruption,</HI> than to have,
in any Sort, contributed towards it: But
however, I believe them to be, in all Re∣spects,
as safe from any future Infection as
<HI>Alcock,</HI> who had 60 Small Pox, at least up∣on
him.</P>
<P>22 <HI>and</HI> 23. <HI>Tuesday</HI> and <HI>Wednesday,</HI> All
of them continue well; and their Incisions
cease running, and dry up apace.</P>
<P>24. <HI>Thursday,</HI> I purg'd <HI>Alcock</HI> and <HI>Caw∣thery</HI>
for the first Time; and did design also
to purge the three Women; but was pre∣vented
by their. <HI>Monthly Purgations,</HI> which,
I was not a little surpriz'd to hear, seiz'd
them all about the same Time; tho' some
of them had been obstructed several Months
before.</P>
<P>28. <HI>Monday, Mary North,</HI> before she was
quite free, unaccountably wash'd in cold
Water, and thence caught a violent Colic,
which lasted near two Days.</P>
<P>30. <HI>Wednesday,</HI> They all three take a
purging Potion, which answers the Intenti∣on,
and perfectly carries off <HI>Mary North's</HI>
Colic Pains.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28"/>
31. The two Men are again purg'd, in
Order to their being discharg'd: And so
likewise, next Day, are the Women.</P>
<P>And on the Sixth of <HI>September,</HI> they were
all dismiss'd to their several Counties and
Habitations.</P>
<P>To conclude, The Thing has been suc∣cessful
on all the Five, far beyond my Ex∣pectation,
considering their Age, Habit of
Body, and Circumstances; and it has per∣fectly
answer'd Doctor <HI>Timoni's</HI> Account of
this Practice, and also the Experience of all
who have seen it in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot here forbear mentioning the
very ample Testimony, which Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> an
eminent <HI>Turky</HI> Merchant, one Day gave to
this Experiment, in my Hearing at <HI>Newgate</HI>;
After having seen the Persons ingrafted,
and fully consider'd their Incisions and E∣ruptions;
He openly declared, they were
the very same with what he had ever ob∣served
in <HI>Turky,</HI> of which he had seen a
great many Instances: And that we might
be assur'd, none of these here would ever
be infected with the Small Pox again.</P>
<P>And it is particularly remarkable in this
whole Affair, that tho' there was not the
least encouraging or favourable Circumstance
attending it before the Operation; yet
after it, nothing in any sort dangerous or
unsuccessful did happen: Although no Art,
nor stimulating Medicine, was made Use of
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
to promote the Eruptions; not so much as
to oblige the Patients to keep their Bed; the
whole having been left to Nature, assisted
by a strict and regular Diet.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2. 1721. After due Preparation
of the Body, I ingrafted <HI>Mary Batt,</HI> an
Infant of two Years and an half old;
Daughter of <HI>Thomas Batt,</HI> a Quaker, living
at <HI>Temple,</HI> within three Miles of <HI>Hertford:</HI>
The red Spots and Flushings appeared on
her Face and Neck the fourth Day; and
she kept playing about well till the seventh
or eighth, when she became a little heavy
and thirsty, with a fuller and quicker Pulse;
then the Pustules came out fresh and full,
and the Incisions discharged a thick well∣digested
Matter. She had not above 20 in
all upon her; they continued about three
or four Days, then dry'd away and fell off,
and the Child recover'd perfectly.</P>
<P>Thus far all was well; but what hap∣pen'd
afterwards was, I must own, not a
little surprizing to me, not having seen or
observ'd any Thing like it before. The
Case was in short this; Six of Mr. <HI>Batt's</HI>
Domestick Servants, <HI>viz.</HI> four Men and
two Maids, who all, in their Turns, were
wont to hug and caress this Child whilst
under the Operation, and the Pustules were
out upon her, never suspecting them to be
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
catching, nor indeed did I, were all feiz'd
at once with the right natural Small Pox,
of several and very different kinds; for some
had the round distinct Sort, some the small
continued, and others the confluent; all of
'em had a great many, but especially the
last, with the usual bad Symptoms, and very
narrowly escap'd: But they all (God be
thanked) did well, (except one Maid, that
would not be govern'd under the Distem∣per,
who dy'd of it) and now enjoy a per∣fect
State of Health<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Certificates annexed, <HI>pag.</HI> 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12. 1721. I Inoculated <HI>Joseph</HI> and
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> Sons of <HI>William Heath</HI> of <HI>Hert∣ford</HI>;
the first of about seven, and the
second of three Years of Age; both with
the same <HI>Matter,</HI> and at the same Time:
the last had a very gentle and favourable
kind, in all Respects like the abovenamed
<HI>Mary Batt</HI>; but the first, <HI>viz. Joseph,</HI> be∣ing
a fat, foul, gluttonous Boy, who would
not be confined to the Rules and Directions
I had strictly charged his Mother withal,
as to Diet and keeping warm; was taken
very ill before the Eruption, and after it
had a great Load of the continued small
kind, but at last recover'd and did well.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31"/>
What a mighty Difference is here to be
observed between those two Boys! the
Reason of it seems to be plainly this; The
younger, who had the favourable kind,
was of a clean Habit, moderate Appetite,
and easily govern'd during the whole Pro∣cess.
The elder was not only, as I have
said, of a gross, foul Constitution, but like∣wise
had a voracious Appetite, always
eating and filling his Belly with the coarsest
Food; as Cheese, fat Country Pudding,
cold boil'd Beef, and the like; which I
saw my self as I came in by chance, the
third Day after the Operation; nor was
there any Care taken to restrain or keep
him within in cold, windy, frosty Weather;
he once wet his Feet in the Water; in∣somuch
that had he taken the Small Pox
by Infection, the World could not have
sav'd his Life. Hence it appears how ne∣cessary
it is to cleanse thoroughly those
foul Habits before the Operation; and
withal to keep them to a very strict <HI>Regimen</HI>
under it.</P>
<P>'Tis also here very remarkable, further
to evince the Power of Infection, and the
Genuineness of the Inoculated Small Pox;
that an Infant of about four Months old,
then on Mrs. <HI>Heath's</HI> Breast, while she nurs'd
her two Sons, and lay in Bed with them,
was also seiz'd with the distinct natural
Kind; and in due Time perfectly recover'd.
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
Mrs. <HI>Heath</HI> also, by being Night and Day
constantly with her Children, and always
embracing and caressing of 'em, tho' she
had had the Small Pox many Years before,
struck out in several Pimples or Pustules on
her Face and Hands, but without any
Thing of Sickness or Disorder: which, we
know, has often happen'd to Nurses, by at∣tending
People in this Distemper; and even
by washing their Linen.</P>
<P>Not many Days after this, I met Mr.
<HI>Hughes,</HI> Judge Advocate General of his Ma∣jesties
Forces, who requested me, upon my
Return to <HI>Hertford,</HI> to visit his two Chil∣dren
at his House in <HI>Herting for dbury,</HI> which
I promis'd to do; and found, when I came
there, his Son, a Child of about 18 Months
old, actually ill of the Small Pox; I imme∣diately
acquainted Mr. <HI>Hughes,</HI> with this,
and withal remov'd the Daughter, who
was about three Years of Age, to a neigh∣bouring
Gentleman's House. Mr. <HI>Hughes</HI>
then recommended to me the particular
Care of his Son, and pray'd me, if the
Small Pox shou'd prove of the favourable
Kind, not to fail to inoculate his Daughter
from him. The Boy had indeed the fair
distinct Kind, and not a great many, and
recover'd perfectly of them; but afterwards
dy'd of a cancerous Tumour, which had
been breeding in his Cheek and upper Jaw,
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
long before his Seizure with the Small Pox.
But to return, I took Matter from him, at
the proper Time, and with it Inoculated his
Sister, <HI>November 17th,</HI> having first gently
purg'd her. The Thing took; she sicken'd, the
24<HI>th,</HI> and two Days after the Small Pox ap∣pear'd
fair, and continu'd to fill and ripen
to <HI>December</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> then crusted and gra∣dually
fell off in the usual Manner.</P>
<P>This Young Patient had above two Thou∣sand
Pustules or Small Pox upon her, that
came out well, fill'd up, ripen'd and fell
off, observing the most regular Periods of
the natural Small Pox of the distinct Kind;
yet she did not keep her Bed one Day, nor
wanted a Nurse to watch with her one
Night during the whole Process; never
having been affected with the usual Com∣plaints
and Symptoms of the Natural Small
Pox; nor in the least pitted or scar'd with
them.</P>
<P>I thought it proper to be the more par∣ticular
in relating this Case, because of the
very false Account which had been given
of it in the <HI>Post Man</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 2, which,
in my Absence, the Gentleman himself was
pleas'd to contradict in the <HI>St. James's
Evening Post, December</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 17. I Inoculated two of Mr.
<HI>John Colt's</HI> Children, at his House in <HI>Cle∣ment's
Lane, Lombard Street:</HI> The one
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
a Boy of 7, the other a Girl of about 4 Years
of Age; their Bodies having first been duly
prepar'd by a Physician's Order. They both
sicken'd the 24<HI>th,</HI> the Small Pox appear'd
on the Girl the 26<HI>th,</HI> and on the Boy the
27<HI>th</HI>; they came out gently, fill'd and ripen'd
to the 3<HI>d</HI> and 4<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January</HI>; and then
died away as usual. Those Children had
at least 300 Small Pox each, all fair and
round; but the Boy had rather more: His
came out later, and kept out longer too
than his Sister's; which can only be ac∣counted
for (the Ingrafted Matter having
been the same, and in the same Quantity) by
the Difference of their Habits and Juices.
In the mean Time, neither of 'em from the
Beginning cou'd be said to be downright ill;
nor was oblig'd to lie in Bed; nor, in a
Word, was affected with any of the dange∣rous
or bad Symptoms ordinarily attending
that Disease, or consequential to it.</P>
<P>They being perfectly recover'd; <HI>Satur∣day
January</HI> 13<HI>th,</HI> I perform'd the Opera∣tion
upon a third Child of the said Mr.
<HI>Colt</HI>; a Boy of about 6 Years of Age, who
was also design'd to have undergone it
with the other two the Month before, had
it not been that he was then out of Order;
he continu'd chearful and well till the 20<HI>th,</HI>
when he became ill and feverish; then the
Small Pox appear'd the 22<HI>d,</HI> and three
Days after, the Eruption being quite over,
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
they grew fair, round, full and yellow;
like the natural Small Pox of the distinct
Kind, and thus went on to the 29<HI>th</HI> or
30<HI>th,</HI> when they began to crust and fall off
after the usual Manner. This Child had
a great many upon him, like the above∣named
Miss <HI>Hughes</HI>; and is also perfectly
well recover'd of them: He was visited,
while under them (as indeed were the o∣ther
two) by several eminent Physicians,
and other Persons of Distinction about the
Town, who all unamiously agreed that it
was the right Small Pox, and declar'd
themselves fully satisfied with the Trial.</P>
<P>I do not here take notice of the little
Heats and Flushings, which appear'd upon
them in the Beginning; nor of the o∣ther
more minute Circumstances generally
common to all; nor of the proper Evacua∣tions
prescrib'd before and after; that I may
avoid tedious Repetitions, as much as I
am able. But I wou'd beg leave to add one
Observation, the Reason of which is plain
and obvious, namely, that the greater the
Discharge of Matter at the Incisions is, the
fewer commonly are the Eruptions; and
on the contrary. Hence also the great
Advantage of <HI>Issues</HI> in <HI>This,</HI> and other
cuticular Diseases, may with great Proba∣bility
be evinced and demonstrated.</P>
<P>But to conclude: From these few Instan∣ces,
which I have here contracted into the
narrowest Compass, several very obvious and
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
useful Observations might be made, and un∣questionable
Proofs brought, to shew, in
the most Satisfactory Manner, that the
Small Pox thus rais'd are of the true and
genuine Kind; that they may be always
given and communicated to proper Subjects,
young or old, without any Danger of a
Relapse; and finally, that this whole Pra∣ctice,
prudently manag'd, is always Safe and
Useful, and the Issue ever Certain and Sa∣lutary.</P>
