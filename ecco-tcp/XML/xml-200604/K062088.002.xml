<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>THE reflections of Celestina when she
was alone were full of bitterness and an∣guish.
It was in vain that she wearied her∣self
with conjectures on the cause of her
misfortune: she could find no probability
in any that presented themselves. It could
not be caprice, nor that cruel delight
which men have sometimes taken in wan∣tonly
inflicting pain, and torturing by dis∣appointment
the hearts they have taught
to love them, for of such conduct she
knew Willoughby to be incapable; it
could not be a dispute with Vavasour or
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
any other young man, for such, however
alarming, must soon have been decided;
nor could it be any pecuniary difficulty
that had thus divided them, since Wil∣loughby,
in talking over their future
prospects, had related to her the situation
of his fortune with the utmost clearness
and precision; it could hardly be a prior
matrimonial engagement, for from his
infancy he had loved her, he had re∣peatedly
told her that he never had the
least partiality for any other woman, and
he was truth and candour itself; it could
not be any impediment raised by the
Castlenorths, for however great might be
their displeasure and disappointment, they
had no power over Willoughby's actions,
and he did not love them well enough to
make it probable that their persuasions or
remonstrances could induce him to give
up the favourite project of his life, and
abandon her whom he so passionately loved
to disgrace and misery.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Whatever was the cause, however, of
the sudden resolution he had taken, misery
was certain: she observed that in the dia∣logue
which Cathcart repeated as having
passed between him and Willoughby, no
mention was made of a probability of his
return—no hope thrown out, that their
union was rather suspended than put an
end to. All was dark and comfortless;
and in the mystery which surrounded the
whole affair, there was something of ter∣ror
and apprehension which seemed more
insupportable than the certainty of any evil
except Willoughby's death.</P>
<P>Cathcart, however, had given her a
motive to support her courage, in telling
her that nothing but the knowledge of her
bearing his loss without injury to her
health or her affection for him, could
soothe or diminish the anguish with which
Willoughby was himself oppressed. "Let
me endeavour then," said she, "to give
him this satisfaction, as the last proof I
shall perhaps ever be able to give him of
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
my tender, my unalterable love. Con∣demned
as I am to everlasting regret,
dashed from the summit of happiness to
long and hopeless sorrow for the rest of
my life, let my resolution in suffering with
calmness shew that I should have de∣served
the happiness which heaven once
seemed to have settled as my lot. Heaven
only knows wherefore I am condemned to
lose and lament it."</P>
<P>The solemn promise which Willoughby
had owned his mother had asked and re∣ceived
of him in her last moments now
occurred to her. "Perhaps it is for the
intended breach of that promise," cried
she, "that we are punished: yet from
whence? the ear that heard it, the anxi∣ous
maternal heart that obtained it, are
dust! My benefactress comes not from the
grave to claim it: it was known only to
her, to her son, and to me. Who is there
who could enforce it now, and to whom
would Willoughby listen, after obviating
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
all the objections I urged against it's viola∣tion?"</P>
<P>This fatal promise, however, had al∣ways
hung heavy on the heart of Celestina,
even in her happiest moments, and she
seemed now to be paying the price of hav∣ing
ever consented to break it. Still, still
the inexplicable mystery remained; and
the hand from which the blow came that
had divided her and Willoughby was
equally hid in obscurity.</P>
<P>When a misfortune, however heavy, is
certain, the mind sinks resistless beneath it;
and feeling all remedy ineffectual, it ceases
all attempt to apply any: but this was
not the case with Celestina: while the
cause of her being torn from Willoughby
was unknown, there appeared a possibility
that it might be removed; and though he
had held out no such hope in his conversa∣tion
with Cathcart, her reason now seized
this idea as her only resource. He had
besought her to bear their separation with
patience; he had hopes then surely that it
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
would end: he had entreated her not to
forget her affection for him; surely he had
expectations then that he might again
claim it. Her sanguine temper encou∣raged
these faint rays of comfort, which a
few moments before seemed to be extin∣guished
for ever. The first shock was
passed; the tears she had shed had relieved
her overburthened heart, and she prepared
with some degree of serenity to go down to
Mr. Thorold, Cathcart, and Jessy, and to
consult with them on what she ought to do.</P>
<P>When she again entered the room, the
little group which were assembled in it,
their melancholy and anxious looks, and
the different expectations with which their
meeting had been appointed, combined
to affect her, and to shake the little reso∣lution
she had with so much difficulty ac∣quired:
she sat down, however, and Mr.
Thorold, with a degree of fatherly tender∣ness,
approached her and took her hand.</P>
<P>"My dear young friend," said the ex∣cellent
man, "this dignified composure is
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
worthy of your excellent understanding.
Do you think me deserving the honour of
being your adviser, if, in the present state
of circumstances, you feel that you want
one?"</P>
<P>"I do indeed severely feel," replied
Celestina faultering, "the necessity of a
friend who is able to advise me; and where,
dear Sir, can I find one so equal to it, if
you will but undertake the trouble."</P>
<P>"Well then," replied Mr. Thorold,
"we will not go over the occurrences that
have happened, nor attempt to account
for them: some unforeseen events have
divided you and my friend Willoughby,
and I am very sure, that whatever they are,
they must, if irretrievable, embitter the
rest of his life: he wishes you, as I under∣stand
from Mr. Cathcart, to remain here at
least till you have letters from him. Do you
intend to do so?"</P>
<P>"I hardly know," answered Celestina
faintly, "what I ought to do."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
"It seems to me," said Mr. Thorold,
"that whatever reason has had so much
influence on him as to compel him to quit
you, should render your abode in his house
improper."</P>
<P>"I will return then, Sir, since that is
your opinion, to the lodging I left at
Thorpe Heath."</P>
<P>"That will be very melancholy and
unpleasant to you I fear."</P>
<P>"It certainly will: but what have I to
do now but to learn to suffer? Local cir∣cumstances
will have little power to add
to the sorrow I must endure, while uncer∣tain
of what is become of Mr. Willoughby:
doubting whether I may not have been the
cause that some evil has befallen him, and
sure of nothing—but that I must be
wretched if I never see him again."</P>
<P>"I would very fain comfort without de∣ceiving
you if I could. <HI>I hope you will</HI>
see him again: yet nothing surely but some
very extraordinary event could have taken
him from you; but you hear that he was
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
well—that he promised to write to you:
it is possible that letter may explain what
all our conjectures can do little in clear∣ing
up: let us leave them, therefore; and
do you, my dear Miss de Mornay, resolve
to fulfil his parting injunctions as far as
prudence will permit. I cannot say I ap∣prove
of your staying here, or of your go∣ing
back to indulge your uneasiness in the
mournful seclusion of your cottage; let me
propose therefore a middle way, by which
you will receive this expected letter with∣out
quitting the neighbourhood, and be
ready to obey any wish of our dear Wil∣loughby,
without receiving it at Thorpe
Heath, where you would have nobody to
assist you in it's execution. Will you go
home with me?"</P>
<P>Celestina, who already felt the value of
such a friend as she seemed to have ac∣quired
in Mr. Thorold, and who foresaw
that she must lose Jessy, who could not
stay long from her grandfather, would wil∣lingly
have embraced this offer. She knew
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
that Willoughby had the warmest friend∣ship
for Mr. Thorold, and that he would
probably approve of such a proposal; but
she was unacquainted with his wife, and
dreaded to intrude herself into a family
where she might find only the master of it
disposed to receive her: she objected there∣fore
to the trouble she should give, and to
the impropriety of introducing herself, thus
unasked, to the acquaintance of his
lady; but Mr. Thorold obviated all her
objections, assured her she should have an
apartment to herself, and that his wife
would consider her as his daughter, his
daughter as her sister; and Celestina, who
could not think without pain of going
alone to Thorpe Heath, which she had
left with prospects so very different, and
from whence her books and cloaths had
been removed, consented to go with Mr.
Thorold, and to remain with him at least
till she heard from Willoughby.</P>
<P>It was then settled that at least part of
the original errand which had brought Mr.
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Thorold to Alvestone should be completed,
and that Cathcart and Jessy should be mar∣ried,
since her father was already waiting
to give her away, and since Cathcart was
to remain at Alvestone by the particular
directions of Willoughby on their parting.
Celestina could not be present at the cere∣mony,
but while it was performing pre∣pared
herself with as much resolution as
she could for her little journey. When
they returned from the altar, she kissed in
silence the weeping Jessy, who clung round
her unable to bid her adieu: she recom∣mended
to Cathcart the closest adherence
to every injunction laid on him by Wil∣loughby,
and besought him to come him∣self
over to her with the expected letter as
soon as it arrived; and then with faulter∣ing
steps went to the chaise which was in
waiting for her by Mr. Thorold's orders.
He placed himself by her; and she was
thus removed, probably as she thought for
ever, from the house, of which, only a few
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
hours before, she considered herself as the
fortunate mistress.</P>
<P>As she passed along the avenue, the
bench under one of the great elms, where
she had so often sat with Willoughby in
their childhood, and where only a few
days before he had been recalling those
delightful times to her recollection, struck
her most: it looked like a monument to
the memory of lost happiness! As the
great gate of the park shut after the car∣riage,
she felt exiled for ever from the
only spot in the world that contained any
odject interesting to her; and though little
disposed to think of poetry, almost invo∣luntarily
repeated—</P>
<Q><L>O unexpected stroke, worse than of death,</L>
<L>Must I then leave thee paradise? thus leave</L>
<L>Thee native soil, these happy walks and shades!</L></Q>
<P>Mr. Thorold, to whom sorrow was sa∣cred,
attempted not to call off her thoughts
from their present mournful employment;
but glad to see that her sorrow broke not
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
out in those violent and convulsive expres∣sions
which many women would have
given way to, he contented himself with
administering to her in silence all the
offices of friendship; and when they ar∣rived
at his house, which was about five
miles from Alvestone, he got out and went
in first to prepare his family for the recep∣tion
of their unexpected visitor. After a
few moments he returned, and assured her
that both Mrs. Thorold and his daughter
would be happy to see her, and think
themselves honoured by her abode with
them; "but," added he, "perhaps you
had rather go to your own chamber than
be introduced immediately to strangers."
Celestina had already repented of having
accepted Mr. Thorold's offer, however
friendly it was, and felt that in her pre∣sent
state of mind the most forlorn solitude
would have been better for her than the
restraint she must unavoidably submit to,
and the enquiries that, if not by words,
the looks of all who saw her would make
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
into the cause of the strange revolution that
had happened in her circumstances: but it
was now too late to retreat, and she deter∣mined
to go through at once a ceremony,
the delay of which would not render it less
distressing.</P>
<P>She answered, therefore, with more stea∣diness
of voice than could be expected, that
she could not too soon avail herself of
Mrs. Thorold's kindness, and was imme∣diately
introduced to her and her only un∣married
daughter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thorold was what the world agrees
to call a very good sort of woman, but one
of those who are best described by nega∣tives;
she had no positive failings, but a
sort of feminine pride, which made her
very anxious that none of her neighbours,
at least none of the rank of private gentle∣women,
should have handsomer cloaths, or
better furniture, or a nicer house; and
while she carefully guarded her own dig∣nity,
she indulged somewhat too much
curiosity in enquiring into the minutest par∣ticular
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
by which the consequence of others
could be diminished or encreased.</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold, whose strong understand∣ing
taught him to see and bear her foibles,
had taken the utmost pains to check in his
daughters a propensity to imitate them.
The three elder had been married some
years, and were settled in the neighbour∣hood
of London. Arabella, the youngest,
was now about two and twenty, rather
pretty in her person, and pleasing in her
manners: with much of her father's sense,
she had a little of the vanity of her mother;
but it had taken another turn: though she
dressed fashionably, and her sisters always
took care, by sending her the newest modes
from London, to enable her to give the
<HI>ton</HI> in that remote country, she piqued her∣self
less on that advantage than on being
reckoned extremely accomplished. In
consequence of this rage, she played on
several kinds of instruments mechanically,
for she had no ear, and sung in a feigned
voice, for nature had denied her a natural
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
one. In languages she was more success∣ful:
under the instructions of her father
she had early been taught Latin, and that
knowledge facilitated her acquiring the
French and Italian, which she wrote and
understood better than she spoke them:
she took likenesses in crayons; painted
landskapes in oil; and the apartments
were furnished with her worsted works and
embroidery.</P>
<P>Celestina had hardly gone through the
first ceremonies of her reception than she
found a relief from the inquisitive looks of
the mother and daughter, in admiring
these performances. "You do my trifling
productions a great deal of honour," said
Miss Thorold, "and your praise cannot
fail of being very gratifying to me, as I
understand you are yourself so extremely
accomplished."</P>
<P>"Indeed," answered Celestina, "you
have been misinformed. I can boast of
no such advantage: but I am extremely
fond of music and of drawing, and used to
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
please a very partial friend by attempting
them: since her death, my time has passed
in a very unsettled way, and I have now
no motive to tempt me to recover what
in that desultory life I have lost of the little
I knew."</P>
<P>Miss Thorold, who had heard Celestina
represented as excelling, was not sorry to
find she possessed no such very great ad∣vantages
over her; and Celestina, to whom
any thing was preferable to conversation,
pressing her to sit down to the harpsichord,
she complied with that air of confidence
which the certainty of excelling gives; and
till dinner she continued to play sonatas
and lessons, all of which Celestina failed
not to applaud, though she had so little
idea of what she heard, that she could not
have assigned one to it's proper composer:
her thoughts were fled after Willoughby;
and from the strange reverse she had experienced,
nothing had power to detach
them. Dinner, tea, and supper, at length
were over; the presence of Mr. Thorold
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
prevented his wife from asking questions
which were every moment rising to her
lips; and Celestina was permitted to retire
to her own room at an early hour. The
extreme fatigue she had suffered the night
before, and the solicitude of spirit she had
endured for so many hours, had so ex∣hausted
nature that she sunk into slumber;
but it was disturbed and broken by hideous
dreams. In the morning, however, she
found herself better: her mind had not yet
recovered from it's consternation, but she
could now think of all that had happened
with more steadiness. In the letter she
expected from Willoughby, she had some∣thing
to look forward to, which might al∣leviate
but could not encrease her anxiety,
as whatever cleared up the mystery would,
she thought, be a relief to her, and cer∣tainty,
however painful, she was sure she
could endure better than wild conjectures
and terrifying suspense.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the following day passed without
any tidings of Cathcart, in search of
whom the anxious eyes of Celestina were
continually turned towards the window.
Mr. Thorold went out to his farm and
among his parishioners in his usual way,
and had charged his wife to let Celestina
be mistress of her time, and not to impor∣tune
her with questions or even with con∣versation:
to Arabella also he had given
the same injunctions: but the native po∣liteness
of Celestina had made both the
ladies believe she was pleased by their
conversation and interested in their con∣cerns,
and to avoid the appearance of
rudeness or singularity, Celestina now
forced herself into some degree of atten∣tion
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
to their endeavours to entertain her,
listened to the details Mrs. Thorold gave
of the affairs of the neighbourhood, and
gave her daughter her opinion of the
most elegant mixture of colours in a work∣bag
she was composing for one of her
sisters, heard with patient politeless a long
poem, written by young Thorold, who
was now at Oxford, and assented to the
justice of Arabella's complaints that there
was very little rational society in the coun∣try,
that every body now forsook their
distant seats to pass their summers at
some watering place, and that unless one
could enter into the amusements of an in∣ferior
circle, there was to be found in the
country no amusement at all.</P>
<P>So passed the long long day, and ano∣ther
and another in the same manner,
relieved by nothing but the silent though
tender sympathy with which Mr. Thorold
himself seemed to enter into the feelings of
his fair, unhappy guest. He looked at
her with eyes that told her all the concern
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
her situation gave him; and appeared
hurt that both his wife and daughter, though
they behaved to her with all the attention
and kindness possible, seemed not to un∣derstand,
that on a mind like hers, in its
present situation, the common occurrences
of life could not be obtruded but to pain
and fatigue. He however spoke not to
them, of what, he feared, they had not
delicacy of feeling enough to comprehend;
but knowing of the expected letter from
Willoughby, he became towards the noon
of the fourth day almost as anxious for
its arrival, and almost as uneasy at its long
delay, as Celestina herself.</P>
<P>Her solicitude was by that time become
insupportable. She could no longer con∣ceal
it under the appearance of attending
to her hosts; but took the opportunity of
Mrs. Thorold's being engaged in domestic
business, and Arabella at her music, to
steal into the garden; where she hid herself
in a sort of alcove cut in an hedge of holly
and other evergreens that bounded the
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
garden towards the road, and there gave
way to the tormenting apprehensions that
corroded her heart. It was now Tuesday:
Willoughby had been gone since the pre∣ceding
Wednesday evening; and had he
gone to London immediately, and written
from thence as he promised, the letter
must long since have reached Cathcart by
the return of the post: but she knew that
unless he was greatly changed it was not
to the post he would entrust the convey∣ance
of a letter on which her existence
perhaps depended; the delay therefore ag∣gravated
all the terrors she felt; but ano∣ther
day past, and she was still obliged to
endure them. To disguise her distress
however was impracticable; and without
hoping to impose upon her friends by so
common an artifice, she was at length com∣pelled
to say, that she had an head ach
which was very severe unless when she was
in the open air; and that she was rendered
by it quite incapable of conversation.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Having thus obtained the liberty of wan∣dering
alone in the garden, she passed
there the whole morning of Wednesday:
sometimes reflecting with the bitterest re∣gret
on the different prospects which were
before her on the Wednesday of the pre∣ceding
week, and sometimes bewildering
herself in conjectures, on the cause of their
having thus vanished from her.</P>
<P>Spring had within that period made a
rapid progress; but Celestina no longer
heeded the beauties that surrounded her:
hers was now that state of mind when—</P>
<Q><L>'Tis nought but gloom around; the darken'd Sun</L>
<L>Loses his light; the rosy-bosom'd Spring</L>
<L>To weeping Fancy pines, and yon bright arch,</L>
<L>Contracted, bends into a dusky vault:—</L>
<L>All Nature fades extinct—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomson.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Even flowers, of which she was passionately
fond, had lost the influence they once had
over her fancy. She saw them not; or
seeing them, only recollected that Wil∣loughby
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>
had shewn her at Alvestone a bed
of such hyacinths, whose bloom and fra∣grance
he had fondly anticipated, knowing
how much she delighted in them: she
remembered with a sigh each particular
leaf and blossom that composed the last
nosegay he gathered for her, on the morn∣ing
of that day, when they were divided,
never, as she now feared—to meet again!</P>
<P>Such were her sad recollections, as, hardly
knowing what she did, she traversed the
grass walk which was divided by a hedge
of evergreens from the road. Her mourn∣ful
reverie was interrupted by the sound of
horses feet. She flew to the gate: it was
Cathcart! who on perceiving her threw
himself from his horse and gave her the
long expected letter, which she received
with such marks of extreme agitation, that
Cathcart, afraid she would fall, left his
horse to find it's way to the stable, and
came to support her.</P>
<P>She leaned on his arm, attempting to
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
speak, and after a moment's pause said—"Cathcart,
you have had a letter also?"</P>
<P>"I have."</P>
<P>"Before I have courage to open my
own, tell me—is Willoughby well? and
are there hopes of our seeing him again?"</P>
<P>"He is well," answered Cathcart; but
of seeing him again he gives me no hopes:
to you, perhaps, he may be, and I hope
is more explicit."</P>
<P>Celestina staid not to reply; but hurry∣ing
as well as she was able to her own
room, tore open her letter, which was in
these words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>April 3, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>What must be the misery the man
endures, who only a few days since had
the immediate prospect of calling Ce∣lestina
his, and who is now compelled
not only to leave her, but to leave her
uncertain whether he may ever again
dare to entertain that hope—whether he
shall ever see her more!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
How I have loved you, Celestina—how
I still love you—I surely need not
repeat. This passion you well know—
<Q>Grew with my growth, and strengthen'd with my
strength:</Q>
you will not therefore believe that any
circumstance can diminish—any time
efface it. Yet such are the barriers
that may be between us, that perhaps
I may never dare again to see you; or
only when I have submitted to the
dreadful sacrifice required of me, and
given my hand to one to whom my
heart must ever be a stranger: and
yet, Celestina, if to this I ever do
submit, it will only be to enable me to
place you in the situation you deserve as
to fortune, and because it matters not,
if I cannot pass my life with you, with
whom it may be my destiny to pass
it; for then, it must in every event
be equally unhappy. Celestina! I am
aware of the appearance my conduct
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
must have in your eyes; aware of it
without having the power to explain
it. I have sworn that I will not un∣veil
this fatal mystery till I either can
see you, with all those delicious hopes
<HI>unempoisoned</HI> that were so lately mine,
or till I have learned to regard you—not
with less affection, for that is im∣possible,
but with—I bewilder my∣self—I
know not what I would say—only
let this be understood as my mean∣ing,
that wherever I may be, or what∣ever
I may become, my fondest affec∣tions,
my love, my esteem, must be
yours. It is more than probable that I
shall go abroad; and you, Celestina,
whither will you go? Suffer me to
name my wishes, though I hardly dare
hope you will comply with them—Why
should you not stay at Alvestone? If
<HI>ever I return to it,</HI> you will be it's
mistress; if I never return, you might
find a melancholy pleasure—But again
I am wandering from my point: I will
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
not dictate to you, my lovely friend, I,
who am incapable of judging what I
ought to do for myself; for in the midst
of my reflections a thousand bitter
possibilities distract me: Celestina may
renounce me as unworthy of her; may
learn to despise me, or what is yet
more dreadful, she may learn to love
another. Oh! Celestina! should this
ever happen—should you ever give
that heart, which it was the glory of
my life to possess, to another!—and
yet, situated as I may find myself, it
may perhaps be—But I must con∣clude
while I am able, and call off my
thoughts from myself, to promote Ce∣lestina's
future comforts, if I can yet
contribute to it, who have perhaps been
it's destroyer.</P>
<P>Do not write to me. Expressions of
your anxiety and regret I cannot bear.
It is as much as I can now do to keep
my senses. Gracious heaven! that ever
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
I should say to Celestina, do not write
to me!</P>
<P>Cathcart has my directions how to
act in all pecuniary matters at Alvestone,
and to stay in the house till he takes
possession of his own, which I suppose
will be as soon as old Winnington dies:
then he will continue to superintend the
farm, and to receive the rents, out of
which I have directed him to pay you
fifty guineas every quarter, and to an∣swer
any farther demands that you may
make upon him: and you must not,
Celestina, refuse this; for remember that
the master of the whole fortune should
now have been your's, and that you
have a right to this trifle—perhaps to
much more. But if these reasons are
insufficient to conquer your reluctance,
remember, Celestina, that Willoughby,
the unhappy Willoughby asks it of you,
as the greatest alleviation his wretched∣ness
now admits of.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
Wherever you are, let Cathcart give
me constant information; and whenever
I can tell you that the weight which now
presses on my heart is removed, I will
write—write! no I will then fly to my
Celestina from the extremity of the
earth. Perhaps I may now be in a few
days on the sea; but I go no farther
but to the South of Europe. Celestina,
it would be a very great comfort to me
to hear from Cathcart, before I go,
what you intend to do: it would be a
still greater to know that you deter∣mine
to remain at least this summer at
Alvestone: but you are now with a
most excellent man, who is capable of
advising you: in him, Celestina, you
will have a friend and protector.</P>
<P>Oh! why is it my lot to refer you
to another for protection, when to be
your friend, your lover, your husband,
was so lately the first hope, as it has
ever been the first with of my existence.
But I am running again into useless re∣petition.
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Celestina, if I ever seemed
worthy of your regard, give not away
hastily those affections which were
mine! If ever I can claim them again—we
may be happy; if not—but I can∣not
finish the sentence—I know not
what I would write, nor am I able to
read over what I have written. May
God bless and protect you! Adieu,
dearest Celestina!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>GEORGE WILLOUGHBY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Celestina read over this letter the first
time in such perturbation, that except a
general notion that notwithstanding Wil∣loughby
had <HI>involuntarily</HI> left her they
should meet no more, she had very little
idea of it's contents.</P>
<P>Her's were sensations of anguish which
no appeal to friendship, no participation of
her sentiments with another, could mitigate
or appease. Cathcart knew no more of the
motives of Willoughby's conduct than she
did herself; Mr. Thorold was equally ig∣norant;
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
and to neither of them could she
look for consolation. She tried to recover
her composure; she a second time read the
letter: it grew more and more inexplica∣ble;
and after having anxiously waited for
it so many days, it's arrival seemed now
only either to embarrass her with new
conjectures, or to torment her with appre∣hensions
of his marrying Miss Fitz-Hay∣man,
for to that the close of the first sen∣tence
evidently alluded. Nothing but the
natural strength of her understanding could
have supported her under the first tumultu∣ous
sensations of redoubled consternation
and wild conjecture, which now assailed
her. The longer she studied the letter, the
more impossible she found any explana∣tion
of Willoughby's conduct: still the
assurances of his unshaken attachment
sweetened the bitterness of her destiny; he
was living; he still loved her; her situation,
therefore, however uneasy, was not despe∣rate;
and, as the first astonishment at the
incomprehensible contents of a letter, which
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
was expected to clear up every doubt,
subsided, she saw less cause of despondence,
and again she examined every separate pa∣ragraph,
trying to extract from all that
would bear it, something to cherish that
hope, without which her existence would
have been insupportable.</P>
<P>Every request of Willoughby had with
her the force of a command; but that he
made in regard to her continuing at Al∣vestone
was so worded, as if he hardly
himself thought she ought to comply with
it. The impropriety of it appeared evi∣dent;
but in every other instance she de∣termined
to be governed by his wishes,
and as far as was now in her power to con∣tribute
to his satisfaction by affording him
all the consolation that depended upon
her. Of the pleasure of living for a
beloved object, though perhaps personally
disunited for ever, of believing that where∣ever
he was, her ease and happiness were
ever in his thoughts, she was fully sensible;
and she now found in it a consolation so
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
soothing to her mind, that she was soon
enabled to return to Cathcart, who waited
for her in the parlour, with more compo∣sure
than on her leaving him it was likely
she would soon obtain. She found herself
unequal to entering on a discussion of the
letter, which she gave Cathcart to read;
and on his returning it in silence, but with
a look sufficiently expressive of his asto∣nishment,
she told him, that nothing re∣mained
but for them to fulfil as nearly as
possible all the injunctions of Willoughby.
"He desires me not to write to him," said
she. "Even in that I shall, with what∣ever
reluctance, obey him at present, and
so I certainly shall in what relates to fol∣lowing
the advice of Mr. Thorold. A
little time will be necessary before I can
fix on any plan of life: but as my dear
Willoughby expects to hear of me from
you, tell him that I bear our separation,
cruel as it is, with fortitude and calmness,
convinced as I am that our connection is
not broken by any cause that ought to
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
make me blush that it had ever been in∣tended."
She stopped a moment to re∣cover
her voice, which faultered and almost
failed, and then added—"No, Cathcart,
whatever has divided us, I have the firmest
reliance on Willoughby's honour."</P>
<P>"And on his love," said Cathcart,
"you may, dear Madam, with equal
firmness rely: and though these perfect
convictions render this strange separation
more wonderful, they will I trust sustain
your courage through it—I say through
it, because I am almost certain it will be
of no long duration."</P>
<P>"Ah! Cathcart!" cried Celestina
mournfully, "I would I could think so!
But it is indeed very fruitless and very pain∣ful
to enter again on these bewildering
conjectures, in which, as there is no end,
there is little use: and I have need of all
my spirits to enable me to support an evil,
for which I cannot account; I will not
therefore waste them in guessing or lament∣ing
but employ them to obey him to whom
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
my heart must, in every change of circum∣stance,
and though I were certain never
more to see him, be fondly and faithfully
devoted. Tell him so, my good friend:
tell him how well I bear this severe blow,
more severe as coming from an unknown
hand; and assure him that if he will allow
me to write to him, I will not distress him
by useless complaints, or aggravate his
sorrow by representing my own."</P>
<P>Again she stopped, while Cathcart ex∣pressed
his admiration of her just and noble
resolutions; and after a moment, finding
the exertion too much for her, she added
hastily—"tell him thus much, Cathcart,
in the letter you will of course write to
him this afternoon; and tell him that your
next letter shall inform him, if it is still
uneasy to him to receive a letter from me,
of the arrangements I will make under the
guidance of Mr. Thorold for my future
life: but say, that they will be such as
will render his generous intentions as to
pecuniary matters needless. I would fain
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
explain my thoughts in that respect; but
in truth I am not able just now. Some
hours of reflection will be necessary to me.
Farewel, therefore, dear Cathcart, for this
morning; I shall of course see you again
in a few days."</P>
<P>Cathcart assured her he would be with
her again the following Friday; or the in∣tervening
day, if he received any new in∣telligence
from Willoughby. She then
charged him with many kind wishes and
remembrances to Jessy, who was now, he
told her, so confined by her grandfather
that she could not get to her, and then
took his leave to return to Alvestone, and
execute the wishes of Willoughby by giv∣ing
him a minute detail of all that had
passed with Celestina.</P>

<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Thorold, who was informed that
Celestina had received letters from Wil∣loughby,
felt a true friendly impatience to
know their contents: but feeling also how
much his lovely guest must in any event
be agitated, he not only forbore to intrude
upon her with any enquiries himself, but
in order that she might not suffer even
from the looks of his family, which he
knew could not fail to express solicitude
arising from less generous motives, he sent
her up a note to her own apartment, in
which he begged she would not come
down to dinner, to put herself, through
form, into any situation that might be in
any degree painful. This exemption was
particularly gratifying to her, as the
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
younger Thorold was this day expected at
dinner, and was to remain at home for
some weeks; and his elder brother, a
Captain in the army, who had been some
time in Ireland, was to meet him in the
evening. Celestina was unfit for com∣pany,
and above all, the company of stran∣gers;
and again she regretted that in the
first unsettled tumult of her spirits she had
agreed to Mr. Thorold's proposal, instead
of going back to the lodgings she had
formerly inhabited: she was now, how∣ever,
compelled to remain where she was,
till she could determine, with the advice
of Mr. Thorold, whither to go. She
thought it probable that he might wish
her to remain with him; but to this, ex∣cept
his friendly regard for her, and the
advantage of being near Cathcart and
Jessy, she had no inducement; and where∣ever
she was, she determined it should not
be as a mere visitor for any length of time,
but that she would pay for her board.
Again the quiet and liberty of her cottage
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
on the heath recurred to her; but when
she enjoyed that quiet, her heart had not
undergone those vicissitudes of happiness
and misery, which had now, she greatly
feared, excluded tranquillity from her
bosom for ever; what had then afforded
her a species of melancholy pleasure, the
distant view of a spot in Alvestone Park,
would now serve only to render her more
unhappy, and to encourage that tendency
to repine, which her reason told her she
should, both on Willoughby's account and
her own, rather resolve to conquer than
endeavour to indulge: she believed, how∣ever,
that if once some resolution was
formed as to her future residence, she
should be easier herself, and be better
able to satisfy Willoughby. To this sub∣ject,
therefore, she turned her thoughts,
and examined with a heavy heart several
different plans that offered themselves to
her mind.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more comfortless than
her reflections: she was not only an or∣phan,
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
and a stranger in England, but
knew not whether there was in the world
any being whose protection she had the
remotest right to claim. Lady Molyneux
had never written to her since their separa∣tion,
and even if Willoughby should ap∣prove
of her again seeking the protection
of his sister, which she had great reason to
doubt, she knew not whether Matilda and
her husband would receive her; and from
that want of heart she had too often discovered
in them both, she could not think
of making the experiment. She had no
intimacy with any other person; for though
many of the families she had been accus∣tomed
to visit while Mrs. Willoughby
lived, had daughters, who had cultivated
an acquaintance with her, she had already
seen enough of the general conduct of the
world to know that she should now be no
longer an acceptable guest, and that an
individual to whom court is made assidu∣ously,
while shining as an equal among
fashionable circles, is soon forgotten; or
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
if remembered, despised, when those ad∣ventitious
advantages surround her no lon∣ger.
She had heard from Vavasour, for
Willoughby himself had always carefully
avoided the subject, that the sudden deser∣tion
of Miss Fitz-Hayman, to whom Wil∣loughby
was supposed to be so firmly en∣gaged,
and his resolution of marrying his
mother's adopted daughter, had been very
much talked of in the extensive circle who
were connected or acquainted with the fa∣mily:
she could not doubt but that their
sudden separation on the very eve of their
marriage was as generally known; and had
she found any temptation to return to the
society she had quitted, this painful cer∣tainty,
the prying curiosity that would be
excited, and the malicious conjecture that
would be made, would effectually have
counteracted it.</P>
<P>Towards evening she found sufficient
courage to entreat Mr. Thorold's attention
for half an hour. He came to her imme∣diately,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
and she put into his hands the
letter she had received from Willoughby.</P>
<P>He read it with great attention, and as
it should seem with great concern, and
then, in the expressive manner that was
usual with him, gave it back to her with∣out
speaking.</P>
<P>Benevolence and pity were now visible
in his features, which were masculine,
strong, and frequently stern; but Celestina
was hardly enough accustomed to him to
understand his silence completely. "You
see, dear Sir," said she timidly—"you
see that Willoughby refers me to you, and
I would very fain avail myself of the bene∣fit
of your advice."</P>
<P>"It is always at your service," replied
Mr. Thorold; "but on what occasion do
you now ask it?"</P>
<P>"I wish to know," replied she with
still greater hesitation, "what you think
it advisable for me to do? where you think
I ought to settle myself?"</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
"I am sorry," answered he, "you
think it so soon necessary to turn your
thoughts that way. I hoped that you
would stay here at least for some weeks;
and really I can give you no other advice
than to do so. The mystery which I can∣not
develope, may by that time be re∣moved,
and we shall have time not only
to hear more of Willoughby, but if no∣thing
occurs on his part to re-establish you
at Alvestone, to cast about for a proper
and permanent situation for you: think no
more, therefore, my dear ward, for such
I consider you, of leaving us at present,
and rather exert your admirable under∣standing
in quieting your spirits, and in
acquiring fortitude to bear adversity and
evil, if they should be finally your por∣tion;
or equality of temper to enjoy, what
it is more difficult to enjoy well—happiness
and prosperity"</P>
<P>Celestina would now liave spoken of the
inconvenience to which so long a visit
might put his family, and the little claim
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
she had to such unusual kindness from him
and Mrs. Thorold; but he suffered her
not to continue these apologies, seemed
little pleased that she attempted to make
them; and then re-assuming his good hu∣mour,
he left her, bidding her try to re∣cover
her looks, and to dismiss as much
as she could from her mind the distressing
events of the last ten days.</P>
<P>Celestina now found that she could not
immediately remove without offending the
friend to whom Willoughby had recom∣mended
her, and prepared, since she could
not be indulged with solitude, to mix with
his family, and be as little as possible a
weight on those, who, whatever might
be their good humour, could not be ex∣pected
to enter into her sorrows; the next
morning therefore at breakfast she joined
Mrs. Thorold, her daughter, and her two
sons, to both of whom she was immediately
introduced, and from whose scrutinizing
looks she sought refuge in talking with
forced cheerfulness to Arabella.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
Captain Thorold was the eldest of the
family, and Montague the youngest.
The former of these young men had been
adopted by his uncle, who, after a life
passed in the army, had died a general
officer at a very advanced age, and had
left his nephew his whole fortune, which
was near fifteen hundred a year, after the
death of his wife, who surviving him
only a twelvemonth, Captain Thorold had
now been some time in possession of his
estate, and of a considerable sum of money.</P>
<P>But accustomed from his infancy to the
unsettled life of a soldier, he still continued
it from habit and choice; and though his
father and his family were very solicitous
to have him marry and settle near them,
he seemed to have no inclination to resign
his freedom for the pleasures of domestic
society. Novelty and amusement were
his pursuits, and his fortune gave him the
power to indulge himself. He had what
is generally called a very handsome per∣son;
but without his military air, his figure
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
would have been rather esteemed clumsy
than graceful. He had lived much among
the circles who give the ton, dressed well,
and had that sort of understanding which
recommended him to general society, and
particularly to that of the ladies, with
whom he was an almost universal favourite,
and who had agreed to call him the hand∣some
Thorold, even before he became
possessed of a fortune, which in the opinion
of most of the belles at country quarters,
and still more in the opinion of their mo∣thers,
more than redoubled his attractions.
Thus spoiled from his first entrance into
life, he had learned to consider himself as
irresistible, and supposed every woman he
saw his own, if he chose to take the trou∣ble
of securing her.</P>
<P>His air and manner were tinctured with
the consequence he derived from this per∣suasion;
and from having indulged him∣self
in the cruel vanity of extensive con∣quest,
he was incapable of any lasting or
serious attachment. At the first public
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
meeting at any town he happened to be
quartered at, he elected some goddess of
the day; with her he danced, he walked,
he rode, he coquetted; and by studied
looks, and tender speeches, soon persuaded
the inexperienced girl that she had secured
in her chains the handsome Thorold.
The delusion of the young woman herself,
and the envy of the cotemporary belles,
sometimes lasted till the removal of the
corps to another station: when he took a
cold farewel, and left her to suffer all the
pain of disappointed love and mortified
vanity: but he not unfrequently indulged
himself in witnessing the distress this wan∣ton
folly inflicted; and after some days of
attention so marked and unequivocal as to
give the lady reason to suppose an absolute
declaration of his passion was certainly to
be expected, he suddenly broke off the
acquaintance, pretended to forget their
intimacy, bowed to her when they met
with the air of a stranger, and beginning
the same career with some other pretty girl
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
of the place, he affected to treat with dis∣dain
and wonder the reports he had him∣self
raised of his permanent attachment to
the first lady, and laughed with her rival
at the melancholy moping looks, or glances
of angry disappointment, of the deserted
beauty, declaring himself amazed at her
having the vanity to suppose him serious,
because he had shewn her a few trifling at∣tentions
which meant nothing.</P>
<P>This conduct of his son had given Mr.
Thorold great uneasiness a few years be∣fore,
but lately, as he had been in Ire∣land,
and in very distant quarters, his fa∣ther
had heard no more of it, and flattered
himself that now, at near thirty, this un∣settled
temper and unjustifiable levity would
end in his marrying and quitting the army.
But though a very fond father to all his
children, Mr. Thorold loved the Captain
less than the others; partly perhaps because
he was so early removed from him, and
rendered independent of his care, and
partly because his temper and disposition
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
resembled not his own; while Mrs. Tho∣rold
doated on her eldest son, whose figure
and fortune gratified her vanity, and whom
she thought no young woman could possi∣bly
deserve, unless she possessed at once
fortune, beauty, and fashion.</P>
<P>Montague Thorold, who was but just
turned of one and twenty, and was designed
by his father for the church, was as modest
and unassuming as his brother was arrogant
and pretending. He was a very good
scholar, with a passion for poetry, and was
just of the age to be in love with every
handsome woman he saw; and without
having the courage to speak to any of them
in prose, he celebrated his divinities in
verse, and sighed forth his tender senti∣ments
in sonnets and elegies, which en∣riched
the magazines, and now and then
the public prints, under the fictitious names
of Alphonso or Lysimachus.</P>
<P>Such were the two young men who were
now added to the tea table of Mrs. Tho∣rold,
where all the family were assembled
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
except Mr. Thorold himself, who always
breakfasted early and then went out to his
farm or among his parishioners.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thorold had told her sons that a
young lady was visiting at the house, whose
history she had given them in short hand,
describing her as a dependant on the late
Mrs. Willoughby, whom her son had very
simply intended to marry at Alvestone;
but the evening before the appointed wed∣ding
day had broken off the match, from
prudential motives as she supposed, and by
the advice of some of his friends who had
come down from London.</P>
<P>This was the idea Mrs. Thorold had her∣self
conceived of the affair, and she had no
means of being undeceived; for Mr. Tho∣rold,
who knew that with her a command
was better than an argument, and whose
authority was pretty firmly established, had
ordered her positively to ask no questions
of his guest, and had peremptorily refused
to answer those she put to himself. She
obeyed, but not without many murmurs;
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
but knowing that Mr. Thorold would be
much disobliged by her refusal to entertain
Celestina with kindness, had put a restraint
upon herself, and shewed her hitherto much
civility, though not without many com∣plaints
to Arabella, when they were alone,
of her father's absurdity in forcing people
into the family, and refusing even to sa∣tisfy
her who and what they were, or what
claim they had to the kindness he exacted
for them.</P>
<P>From his mother's sketch of their visitor
the evening before, Captain Thorold had
very little curiosity to see her; and Mon∣tague,
whose heart was in one of it's most
violent paroxisms of love for the fair
daughter of an attorney at Henly, with
whom he became acquainted about a fort∣night
before, was occupied in composing
an elegy on absence, and thought he could
with indifference have beheld at that pe∣riod
Helen herself: he had enquired of
his mother and sister if their guest was
handsome: Mrs. Thorold answered—"No,
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
not at all handsome in my opinion;" and
Arabella said—"Yes, surely, Mama, she
is rather pretty-ish."</P>
<P>On her entering the room, however, both
the gentlemen were instantly of an opinion
very different from that of their mother and
their sister: yet Celestina had not now that
dazzling complexion, or that animated coun∣tenance,
which were once so dangerous to
behold; she was pale and languid; her
eyes had all their softness, but their lustre
was diminished; and the enchanting sweet∣ness
which used to play about her mouth
was now supplied by a melancholy smile,
the effect of a faint effort to conceal the
anguish of the heart.</P>
<P>Such as she now appeared, however,
the Captain thought her very lovely; and
Montague almost instantly forgot the
nymph for whom he had been dying in
song all the morning, and saw in the in∣teresting
languor of Celestina—in her faded
cheek, and downcast eyes, a sentimental
effect, which none of the fair creatures
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
whom he had celebrated had ever so emi∣nently
possessed: but if such were his
sentiments before she spoke, his admira∣tion
arose to extravagance, when, after
breakfast, his sister engaged her in a walk
in which the two gentlemen attended
them, and when he found that her mind
corresponded with the elegance of her
form; that she was very well read, had a
taste for poetry, and understood Italian, of
which he was enthusiastically fond. Cap∣tain
Thorold, on whom these advantages
made less impression, was not quite pleased
during this walk with the unusual talkative∣ness
of his brother, who generally suffered
him to take the lead in conversation. He
now attempted to put by him two or three
times, and to relate anecdotes of people in
high life: of what General Wallace said
to him at Dublin Castle upon his intro∣duction
to the Duchess of—, and of a
bon mot of Lady Mary Marsden's at sup∣per
one evening; but Celestina, who cared
nothing about the General, the Duchess,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
or Lady Mary, let the conversation drop
without expressing any pleasure in it, and
again lent her attention to Montague, who
desired her to correct his accent while he
repeated—
<Q>O primavera, gioventu dell' anno—</Q></P>
<P>Celestina modestly assured him she was
incapable of correcting him; but he be∣sought
her so earnestly to recite the lines
to him, that she inconsiderately attempted
it, and in the most enchanting accents be∣gan—
<Q><L>O primavera gioventu dell' anno,</L>
<L>Bella madre di fiori</L>
<L>D'erbe novelle e di novelli amori:</L>
<L>Tu torni ben—ma teco</L>
<L>Non tornano i sereni</L>
<L>E fortunati di delle mie gioje:</L></Q></P>
<P>The cruel remembrance that now pressed
upon her heart made her voice tremble,
and gave it additional tenderness. She
tried to recover it; and going into a lower
tone, went on with—
<Q><PB N="56" REF="58"/>
<L>Tu torni ben—tu torni</L>
<L>Ma teco altro no torna</L>
<L>Che del perduto mio caro tesoro</L>
<L>Lo rimembranza misera e dolente.</L></Q></P>
<P>She could go no farther: the tears were
in her eyes; but she tried to smile, and to
stifle the deep sigh that was rising as she
said—"I cannot go on, for really I re∣member
no more."</P>
<P>The young man, fascinated by her
manner and her voice, now recollected—with
reluctance recollected, that these se∣ducing
tones were drawn forth by the
reality of those sufferings the poet described.
He looked at her in silence; and as he
marked the sad and pensive expression that
remained on her countenance, that asto∣nishment,
which he had hardly time to
feel before, arose: he thought it impossible
that Mr. Willoughby, having the power
to marry such a woman, and having once
formed the resolution to do so, should by
any persuasions be diverted from his pur∣pose;
and he found that in the single hour
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
he had been with her, he admired her
enough to sacrifice every thing to her,
were it possible that her regard could be
transferred to him. The improbability
that it ever could, struck him forcibly,
and rendered him as silent as Celestina
herself; while the Captain, who had now
an opportunity of engrossing her attention,
rallied her on being so much affected.
"I have no notion now," said he, "of
giving way to those sort of things. I love
gay and cheerful poetry. One is tired of
weeping at the fictitious misery of fictitious
persons. I remember being some time
ago at a conversation in Dublin, where we
talked of the fashionable indifference which
every body has now for tragedy; and my
friend Hargrave, who has written, you
know, several things himself, was con∣demning
it as the certain marks of the
vitiated taste and imbecility of the age:
I took up the argument on the other side;
and Lady Mary Marsden thought as I
did. Indeed every body present allowed
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
that it was quite absurd to go to a play,
which is intended to amuse and entertain,
only to be made uneasy. She agreed with
me that people have concern enough in
real life, and need not go seek it in way of
diversion."</P>
<P>"And did her Ladyship," enquired
Montague Thorold, "give no other rea∣sons?"</P>
<P>"I think those are very good reasons,"
replied the Captain.</P>
<P>"They might be so," answered his
brother, "for a woman of fashion; but I
am persuaded literary people and people of
taste think quite otherwise; and the an∣cients,
whose superior intellectual advan∣tages
are not to be disputed—"</P>
<P>"Oh prithee Montague," interrupted
the Captain, "don't run us down with
college cant. I am talking of the world
we live in; and the opinions of people
who lived two thousand years ago are no
more in question now than their dresses."
He then went on to retail other opinions
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
of Lady Mary Marsden, who was, as it
seemed, the oracle of the hour in the society
he had just left. Celestina heard him
with apparent attention, but in truth without
knowing what he said; his brother,
rendered impatient by being interrupted
in his conversation with her, walked away;
and Arabella, who loved to hear descrip∣tions
of fine people, and to attend to fa∣shionable
conversation, kept up the dia∣logue
till the end of their walk; when
Celestina went to her own room, Arabella
to her dressing table, and the Captain,
finding his mother at work in the parlour,
thought he had a right to ask her a few
questions about Celestina, in return for the
perpetual tone of interrogation she had
kept up towards him ever since his arrival.</P>
<P>To Mrs. Thorold, the next gratification
to that of asking questions was the pleasure
of answering them: she told her son, there∣fore,
not only all she knew, but invented
answers on some points which she only
guessed at; and he understood, from her
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
information, that Celestina had been very
partial to Willoughby; and so strong was
this partiality described, that he began to
doubt whether the proposed marriage had
not been a mere finesse to throw her off
her guard, and get her wholly into his
power; and whether his abrupt departure
had not been in consequence of the success
of this disingenuous but not unprecedented
method of proceeding.</P>
<P>Captain Thorold had seen Willoughby
frequently in his last visit at home, and
knew that he had every advantage which a
fine person and engaging manners could
give him; he was well acquainted with
the society among which he lived, and had
heard some of them, but particularly Vava∣sour,
described as being very gay and un∣principled;
he had therefore little difficulty
in supposing that Willoughby resembled
those with whom he associated, and that
Celestina had been the victim of those arts
which he supposed no man ever scrupled
to practice where the object was so well
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
worth the trouble; especially one so unpro∣tected
as she was, where no rigid father
was in the way to obstruct their designs,
or Chamont-like brother to avenge the
wrong they might commit. Willoughby
now, however, seemed quite out of the
question; and he doubted not, but that
after a short interval given to sentimental
regret on the loss of a first lover, she would
listen to other vows, and encourage the
passion, which he thought it might be
very amusing to entertain her with, without
meaning however to offer himself to fill
such engagements as Willoughby had
broken. While he meditated on this pro∣ject,
he could not help smiling at the culli∣bility
of his father, who had thus, he
thought, taken into his protection, and
made the companion of his wife and daugh∣ter,
the deserted mistress of Willoughby.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE following morning Cathcart was
early at the house of Mr. Thorold; and
Celestina, who rose now earlier than usual,
(to enjoy, if it could be called enjoyment,
a few hours, before she was compelled to
hide her sorrows under the appearance of
attention to the family she was with) met
him as he came from the stable; and in∣stead
of going into the house, she desired
he would walk with her towards the village.
"You have news for me," said she;
"but if I may guess by your countenance
none that will relieve the weight I feel on
my heart."</P>
<P>"I am afraid not," replied he: "yet
indeed I have nothing to say that should
encrease it. Mr. Willoughby is well; he
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
writes to me with more cheerfulness than
I expected, and assures me that he has a
long letter for you, which he shall send
from Dover, where he shall finish it."</P>
<P>"From Dover! He is then set out on
this expedition. Ah! Cathcart! and ought
not such intelligence to add to my con∣cern?"</P>
<P>"Not at all," replied Cathcart. "You
knew before that it was his intention; and
he tells me that on the event of this jour∣ney
depends his ever seeing Alvestone
again. There is certainly a chance of it's
terminating favourably: at all events, if
this absence is to end your suspense, you
should not only submit to it, but endea∣vour,
my dear Miss De Mornay, to keep
up both your health and spirits."</P>
<P>"Alas! Cathcart," answered Celestina,
"there is nothing so easy to the happy as
to give such advice, nothing so difficult
to the wretched as to take it." She then
enquired into the other particulars con∣tained
in Willoughby's letter; and after
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
informing herself of the day when he expected
to be at Dover, and how long it might pro∣bably
be before she should receive the letter
he promised her, she turned the conversation
on Jessy, whom she expressed an eager wish
to see: and soon after Montague Thorold,
who impatiently watched her wherever she
went, came to tell her that his mother
waited breakfast for her.</P>
<P>Cathcart, however, declined the invita∣tion
to breakfast with them, and wishing
Celestina a good morning, and promising
to be with her again in a day or two, he
went in search of Mr. Thorold, with whom
he said he had some business.</P>
<P>Many succeeding days passed without
any interesting event. The Captain took
every occasion to impress on Celestina an
idea of his consequence, and the fashion∣able
style he lived in, to which she gave
very little attention; while his brother,
whenever he left him an opportunity,
talked to her of books, or read to her
passages in favourite authors of which he
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
heard her express approbation: she was
prevailed upon to sing duets with Arabella;
and he was enchanted with her voice and
manner; she sat down to draw the flowers
he gathered for her, while he hung over her
in raptures, or held her pallet, or read a bo∣tanical
description of the plants she was paint∣ing.
Captain Thorold rode out occasionally
to visit such of the neighbouring families as
he considered worth his attention; Arabella
was often of his party, and Mrs. Thorold
engaged in domestic concerns; and then
if Celestina could not escape to her own
room before Montague, who was always
upon the watch for her, could interrupt
her, he entreated her so earnestly to walk
with him, was so obligingly solicitous to
please her, and seemed so mortified when
she attempted to excuse herself, that she
could seldom resolve to refuse him her
conversation, even when she was most
willing to be alone; and in the similarity
of their tastes and studies, and in the bro∣therly
though silent sympathy he appeared
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
to feel for her sorrows, there was some∣thing
soothing to her sick heart, which
rejected every idea of love but for Wil∣loughby:
conscious of which, and suppo∣sing
that no man could consider her other∣wise
than as destined to be his wife, or to
die unmarried, she dreamed not that she
was granting to young Thorold indulgence
fatal to his repose.</P>
<P>He was himself soon aware of the dan∣ger,
but he courted it; and though he
understood that the heart of Celestina was
engaged, he fancied, that without any
pretensions to her love, he should be hap∣pier
in being admitted to her friendship,
than the unrivalled affections of any other
woman could make him. He was too
artless, and too proud of his judgment, to
attempt to conceal this attachment from his
father, who, had Celestina been disen∣gaged,
would have preferred her, with
her small fortune and uncertain birth, to
the richest heiress in the county: but know∣ing
how she was circumstanced, he saw
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
his younger son's encreasing partiality with
some concern, and took an opportunity,
when they were alone, to tell him the real
circumstances of Celestina in regard to
Willoughby. "I can consider her," said
he, "no otherwise than his affianced wife.
They are parted by some cause of which I
am ignorant, but which will probably be
removed: in the mean time her youth and
beauty render her situation very danger∣ous;
as from her being a foreigner, an or∣phan,
and probably the natural daughter
of some person of high fashion in France,
who has taken care to destroy all evidence
of her real family, she is without relations
and without protection. Willoughby's fa∣ther
was my old friend. When I was an
indigent curate he gave me a living, which,
though I have now, from being possessed
of greater preferment, resigned, I consider
as my first step towards affluence. I am
therefore, bound to the family by grati∣tude,
and to young Willoughby I am
bound by personal friendship and esteem.
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
Except something too much bordering on
rashness in his temper, I hardly know any
man so faultless and so worthy of regard.
He adores Miss De Mornay, and I am
convinced the happiness of his life depends
on their union. Finding him torn from
her for the present, at the very moment
this union was to take place, I entered at
once into all the uneasiness that must have
assailed him, and I voluntarily offered my
protection to her, which he has since ac∣knowledged
in a letter to me to be the
greatest kindness he could receive. I have
promised him to continue it as long as
she has occasion for it or will accept it. Do
not, therefore, Montague, by any of your
excentricities, make this uneasy either to
her or to me. Don't fancy yourself in
love with a young woman who is in fact
married. Any other kind of attention or
regard you shew her will oblige me; but
let us have no making love, unless you
would drive her away and greatly disoblige
me."</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71"/>
The young man readily promised what
at the moment he was sincere in, that he
would not make love to Celestina; but he
did not promise not to feel the passion,
against which it was too late already to
guard him. Mr. Thorold however sup∣posed,
that after this explanation there was
nothing to fear from the extreme suscepti∣bility
of his younger son; and for the eldest,
he was too certain that he had not a heart
on which the charms and virtues of Celes∣tina,
or of any other beautiful and interest∣ing
woman, could make any permanent
impression. He was easy therefore in a
situation which would have made many
narrow minded and selfish parents very
much otherwise; and did not think the
presence of his two sons at home, a sufficient
reason for withdrawing his generous kind∣ness
from Celestina, to whom he was in∣deed
affectionately attached for her own
sake, to whom he loved to consider himself
as a guardian and protector.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72"/>
Mrs. Thorold, always busied about the
intrigues and schemes of the rest of the
world, saw not very minutely into those of
her own family. As to her eldest son, she
contemplated him as a superior being, who
had a right to marry the greatest heiress of
the kingdom. She heard him speak so
often of Lady Marys and Lady Carolines,
that she concluded he might have any of
them whenever he pleased; and had set
her imagination so high as to his merits and
his fortune, that she never supposed he
could think of bringing her any other than
a titled daughter in law. Celestina, whom
she looked upon as a creature whose title
to respect was very questionable, a de∣pendant
from her birth, and now little
better than a dependant on herself, was
not a person likely to make any impression
on Captain Thorold; and the prejudice
operated on her person and her manners.
Mrs. Thorold could not see that she was
handsome, or feel that she was interesting;
and when the attention of young Thorold
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
was very strongly marked towards her,
his mother only ridiculed him, telling him
that he was never easy but when playing
the Philander, and that he cared not with
whom.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, interrupted the
progress of that serious passion, which
Montague Thorold determined to indulge,
and of which Celestina was perfectly un∣conscious.
The more unreserved slattery
and free address of the Captain she knew
how to repress; and received all his ad∣vances
with so much coldness, that his
pride was piqued; and unused to the
slightest repulse, he determined not to
brook it from one, who had, in his private
opinion, very little right to assume dignity
or affect disdain.</P>
<P>The manner he took up towards her in
consequence of these opinions, was so very
disagreeable to her, that it forced her more
than ever into the society of his brother;
before whom, though the Captain held
him very cheap as a boy and a pedant, he
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
could not well address to her such speeches
as he had ventured to utter several times
when he seized an opportunity of speaking
to her alone, or unheard by the rest of the
family. Whenever, therefore, she was
compelled to be below, she contrived to
have Montague Thorold sit next to her, to
accept his arm as they walked, and to ad∣dress
her discourse to him: and flattered by
this evident preference, he let no occasion
pass of proving how happy it made him.</P>
<P>So passed heavily for Celestina, the days
that intervened between that when she last
saw Cathcart, and that on which she ex∣pected
Willoughby's letter from Dover.
The day arrived at length; and Celestina,
who happened to be sitting with Arabella
and her brothers when the letters were
brought, could hardly support herself
while the Captain took them from the ser∣vant,
and reading the direction of each,
threw them across the table, now one to
his sister, now one to his brother, and bade
Montague carry a third to his father.
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
There was none for Celestina, though
Cathcart had told her it would be directed
to her at the house of Mr. Thorold. Of
this bitter disappointment, however, she
spoke not, but tried to conceal the change
it occasioned in her countenance, and
hastened, as soon as she could, to weep
alone, over the sad idea that Willoughby's
diminished, perhaps annihilated love, had
allowed him to torture her with suspense
which he might so easily have avoided by
punctuality.</P>
<P>Another almost sleepless night was the
consequence of this delay: but though
without rest in the night, Celestina rose as
soon as day appeared. At no other time
but early in the morning she had now any
chance of being alone either in the garden
or the neighbouring fields, and the air
seemed necessary to her overburthened
spirits. In the fields, she seemed to breathe
more freely, and her heart, which often
felt as if it would burst, was relieved while
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
she was allowed to weep unmarked and un∣interrupted.</P>
<P>A narrow road, shaded by thick rows
of branching elms, led towards the village,
which was that way almost a mile from
the house of Mr. Thorold, who did not
inhabit the parsonage but an house he had
built on a farm of his own. Celestina, to
avoid being seen from the windows of the
house, which commanded the garden and
the meadows near it, took her way down
this lane. Her thoughts ran over the
strange events of the preceding years, in
which she had experienced so much an∣guish,
anguish embittered by the transient
promise of supreme happiness. As she
reviewed her whole life, it seemed to have
been productive only of regret. "Why,"
cried she, "was I ever born? Alas! my
existence was the occasion of misery to
those who gave it me! Why did dearest
Mrs. Willoughby take me from a confine∣ment
where I was dead to the world, and
where perhaps neglect and hardship might
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
long since have released me? What will
now become of me? If Willoughby for∣gets
me, how shall I find courage to drag
about a wretched being? useful to no∣body,
for whom nobody is interested, and
which seems marked by heaven for cala∣mity!"</P>
<P>These melancholy reflections led her on,
till a turn out of the road brought her to
the style of the church yard. She leant
pensively over it, and read the rustic in∣scriptions
on the tomb stones. One was
that of a young woman of nineteen: it was
her own age; and Celestina felt an emo∣tion
of envy towards the village girl, whose
early death the rural poet lamented in the
inscription. "Merciful heaven!" cried
she, "is early death ever really to be la∣mented?
and should I not be happier to
die now than to live; as perhaps I shall to
be forgotten?" Insensibly this idea took
possession of her fancy; and with her pen∣cil
she wrote the following lines in her
pocket book, not without some recollection
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
of Edwards's thirty seventh and forty fourth
sonnets:</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Oh thou! who sleepest where hazle bands entwine,</L>
<L>The vernal grass, with paler violets drest,</L>
<L>I would, sweet maid! thy humble bed were mine,</L>
<L>And mine, thy calm and enviable rest.</L>
<L>For never more, by human ills opprest,</L>
<L>Shall thy soft spirit fruitlessly repine:</L>
<L>Thou canst not now thy fondest hope resign</L>
<L>Even in the hour that should have made thee blest.</L>
<L>Light lies the turf upon thy virgin breast;</L>
<L>And lingering here, to love and sorrow true,</L>
<L>The youth, who once thy simple heart possess'd,</L>
<L>Shall mingle tears with April's early dew;</L>
<L>While still for him, shall faithful Memory save,</L>
<L>Thy form and virtues from the silent grave!</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Celestina, who had a natural turn to
poetry, had very rarely indulged it; but
since she had passed so many hours with
Willoughby, his passionate fondness for it,
and his desire that she should not neglect
the talent she had received from nature,
had turned her thoughts to it's cultiva∣tion;
and now almost the first use she
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
made of it was to lament that she lived,
since none of her acquirements were to
please him, for whom alone she wished to
possess either life or talents.</P>
<P>She had finished her sonnet, and read it
over aloud: she changed a word or two,
again read it, and was putting it into her
pocket book, when she was startled by the
sight of Montague Thorold, who appeared
behind her, though she had not heard
him approach. "Do not," he cried, "be
offended, dearest Miss De Mornay, if I
thus break in upon your solitude; and do
not," continued he, taking her hand, in
which she still held the pocket book—"do
not punish me by putting away what
I have so earnest a desire to hear."</P>
<P>Celestina, half angry, replied—"I have
nothing, Sir, worth your hearing."</P>
<P>"I have offended you," said he, in the
most respectful tone—"I see you are
offended. If you knew my heart, you
would know how much better I could bear
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
any misfortune than your contempt and
anger."</P>
<P>Celestina, whose slight displeasure was
already at an end, answered with a smile,
that he certainly deserved neither: "but
come," continued she, "you were sent I
dare say to call me to breakfast and we are
loitering here."</P>
<P>"I was not sent," answered he. "I be∣lieve
it is yet earlier than you imagine it to
be. You are not then offended at my in∣terrupting
you?"</P>
<P>"Oh no! think of it no more," said
Celestina, wishing to change the discourse.
"Is it not a delicious morning?"</P>
<P>He answered not her question; but fix∣ing
his eyes on her's, said—"See how
soon a second trespass is attempted when
the first is so graciously forgiven. <HI>May</HI> I
ask, as the most inestimable favour, to
hear once more the lines you were reciting?"</P>
<P>"Once more!" repeated Celestina.
"Have you heard them once already
then?"</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="81"/>
"I will say I have <HI>not,</HI> if my acknow∣ledging
that I have will displease you."</P>
<P>"I do not think," said Celestina care∣lessly,
"that will mend your case much:
but however the lines were not worth your
hearing, and—"</P>
<P>"Every thing you even repeat from
another," cried he, eagerly interrupting
her, "is worth hearing: how much more
worth hearing, when that fascinating voice
is employed in expressing the sentiments of
that elegant and lovely mind. Oh! Ce∣lestina!—But
forgive me, Madam; it is
presumption indeed in me to address you
so freely; yet Celestina is the only name
in the world that seems to me fit for you.
The common terms of formal civility are
unworthy of you. Let me then call you
Celestina, not in familiarity, but in vene∣ration,
in adoration; and entreat you, im∣plore
you to oblige me."</P>
<P>Disconcerted at his vehemence of man∣ner
and extravagance of expression, Celes∣tina
now thought it better to put an end to
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
such very warm applications, by shewing
him the little value in her eyes of the fa∣vour
he solicited. She gave him the paper,
therefore, saying coldly—"You are anxi∣ous
for a very trifling matter; and as you
have already heard the lines, it is hardly
worth the time you must give, hastily
written as they are, and with interlineations
and erasures, to make them out."</P>
<P>"Give me then time to do it," cried he,
as he kissed the paper and put it in his
bosom.</P>
<P>Celestina, more disconcerted by his
manner than before, said yet more gravely,
"I beg I may have them again imme∣diately."</P>
<P>"You shall indeed," replied Thorold;
"but I must first read them."</P>
<P>"Read them then now," replied she.</P>
<P>"It is impossible," cried he, "for here
is Arabella and my brother coming to meet
us; and it is the first time that being with
you, I felt their interruption as a favour."</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
During this dialogue Celestina had
walked rather quickly towards the house,
so that they were by this time within sight
of the garden gate, from whence Captain
and Miss Thorold advanced slowly towards
them. Montague, as if conscious of the
impropriety of what had passed, now af∣fected
to be talking of indifferent matters;
and Celestina, ruffled by his wild enthusiasm,
and eagerly anticipating the letter which
she hoped that day would bring her from
Willoughby, felt herself made uneasy by
the steady and enquiring eyes of the Cap∣tain,
who had acquired a very rude habit
of staring people out of countenance. She
was compelled however to endure it, not
only while breakfast lasted, but afterwards
when Arabella engaged her assistance in
painting a trimming which was to compose
the ornament of a gala dress for the balls at
Tunbridge, whither she was going in June
with the eldest of her married sisters, who
was in an ill state of health.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>ARABELLA Thorold, desirous of
availing herself of the superior taste and
skill that Celestina possessed in such orna∣mental
matter as she was now busy about,
the merit of which she knew she might,
where she was going, take entirely to her∣self,
now invited her guest to the work
table at which she was employed; Monta∣gue
took up a book to read to them aloud,
while his brother sauntered idly about the
room, now praising Celestina's performance,
now correcting that of his sister; then hum∣ming
a tune, looking at his watch, or
throwing about the colours or the pencils,
he seemed determined to interrupt his bro∣ther's
reading, and particularly when by Mon∣tague's
voice and gesture he saw that he hoped
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
particularly to interest and attract the atten∣tion
of his auditors. This scene, of which
the painful anxiety of Celestina for her let∣ter
made her unusually impatient, was at
length put an end to by the entrance of the
servant from the post, and Celestina re∣ceiving,
in trembling agitation, a letter
with the Dover post mark. She flew with
it to her own room, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dover, <DATE>April 11, 17—</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>The vessel which is to carry me from
England and Celestina is now waiting
for me; and I have delayed writing to
her till this last moment; not because
I have ever ceased to think of her with
the warmest solicitude, but because I
have not till now been able to collect
courage to bid her a long adieu!</P>
<P>I am going, Celestina, to the South of
Europe. Perhaps my stay may be very
short: perhaps I may, for the rest of
my life, be doomed to be a solitary wan∣derer.
But however destiny may dispose
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
of <HI>me,</HI> let me entreat you, by all that
regard which once made the happiness
of my life, to take care of your health;
try to regain your cheerfulness; and be∣lieve
me, Celestina, strangely against
me as appearances are, I have not de∣served
to lose your confidence, nor have
I any wish so fervent as for your happi∣ness.</P>
<P>I cannot write to you on pecuniary
affairs. Cathcart has, in regard to every
thing of that sort, my full directions.
Whenever he and Jessy become house∣keepers
for themselves, you will be their
welcome guest, and my heavy heart will
be relieved of much of it's anguish:
till then, I entrust you to the care and
direction of the excellent friend you are
now with: may it not long be necessary
for me to—But I dare not trust my∣self
on this subject. Write to me; for
now the measure I have been driven to
is adopted, I can hear from you without
fearing that my resolution may be shaken.

Heaven bless and protect you, dearest
Celestina! This is the first wish I form,

returns in the morning, and the
last before I <HI>attempt</HI> to sleep at night.
Alas! it is often only an attempt!</P>
<P>But there is no end of this—Farewel!
most beloved Celestina, farewel!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>G. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter was if possible more unsatis∣factory
than the last. No reason was yet
given for his having left her, no certainty
held out of his return; but all, if not hope∣less,
was so comfortless, so obscure, that
her resolution to investigate the cause of
all that had happened, again failed. She
feared even to attempt putting aside the
fearful veil that was drawn between them.
He was now in another country, from
whence his return seemed uncertain; and
she seemed the most desolate and forlorn
being that existed on that which he had
left. Her heart sunk within her in re∣membering
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
that she might never see him
more; that he hardly seemed to wish she
should. Again she read his letter over.
He was sleepless, restless, unhappy; and
for his sufferings she wept more than for
her own.</P>
<P>The plan he mentioned of her residing
with the Cathcarts, was the only one to
which, since their separation, she had
looked forward with any degree of satis∣faction.
But that there was yet little pro∣bability
of executing: for old Winnington
was in even better health than he had been
for some years; and though the tender assi∣duity
of Jessy had won much even on his
insensible heart, he suffered her to have no
authority; and often being seized with fits
of jealousy and suspicion that she went to
meet and assist her father, he would insist
upon her not quitting him a moment; so
that she had sometimes for many days to∣gether
no opportunity of seeing her hus∣band,
and had never once, since her sepa∣ration
from Celestina, been able to reach
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
her present abode. Celestina had not been
an hour alone, before Montague Thorold
tapped at her door. She dried her eyes,
and pulling her hat over them, opened it
to him.</P>
<P>"Will you not walk," said he, apolo∣gizing
however for his intrusion. "I am∣afraid
I disturb you: but the morning is so
beautiful; and we are all going to see a
pond fished, with two friends of my bro∣ther's
from Exeter, who are just come in."</P>
<P>"I cannot indeed," answered Celestina.
"Pray excuse me."</P>
<P>"I would not press you for the world,"
said he, "to do any thing that is disagree∣ble
to you. But the air will be surely use∣ful
to you. You—have been weeping,
Miss De Mornay! and—"</P>
<P>"If I have," replied she, interrupting
him, "you may be assured, Sir, that I
have reason enough for my tears, and
would wish to enjoy them alone."</P>
<P>"Precious tears!" cried he with a deep
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
sigh. "The letter was from the fortunate
Willoughby!"</P>
<P>"Fortunate do you call him?" But
Celestina, as if offended that any tongue
but her's should name him, stopped, and
turning from the door, went into her own
room.</P>
<P>At this moment Arabella ran up stairs to
fetch her cloak and gloves, and seeing her
brother Montague at the door of Celestina's
room, cried, as she passed him—"Hey
day! are you in waiting as Page or Gen∣tleman
Usher?"</P>
<P>"As neither," answered he in some
confusion. "I was merely asking if Miss
De Mornay would walk with us."</P>
<P>"Oh! I dare say not," replied his sister,
smiling maliciously as she looked over her
shoulder at him—"I dare say not. Mon∣tague,
what are you in now? Are you
Romeo—"Oh! that I were a glove upon
"that hand, that I might touch that cheek!"
or are you Castalio?—"Sweets planted by
"the hand of heaven grow here." You al∣ways
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
make love I know by book. What!
shall I call Edmund to take the part of
Polydore? I think you will make it out
among you."</P>
<P>Celestina, who had heard this speech,
though it was not meant that she should,
was equally amazed and hurt at it. It had
however a very different effect from what
the speaker intended; who having no wish
that Celestina should join them, because
she desired to monopolize the conversation
of the two strangers, thought, by rallying
her brother, to break off his entreaty.
Montague, mild as he was, was piqued
extremely, and would resentingly have
answered, if his sister had not immediately
disappeared, and if Celestina had not at
the same moment opened her door and
said—"You compel me, Mr. Montague,
to walk whether I will or no."</P>
<P>"Pray forgive me," said he, interrupt∣ing
her. "I would purchase no pleasure
at your expence."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92"/>
Arabella now returning down stairs, was
surprised to see her preparing to go. "I
thought you declined walking Ma'am,"
said she formally. Celestina made an
effort to conquer the resentment she justly
felt, and replied coldly that the morning
was so pleasant she thought it would be a
pity to lose it.</P>
<P>Her apprehensions indeed were, that had
she remained at home, Montague, who
had persecuted her the whole day, would
have remained also; and the hint his sister
had given of the rivalry of the brothers
had at once shocked and amazed her. Af∣ter
a moment, however, she began to fancy
that her speech had more malice than mean∣ing
in it: but the uneasiness of her situa∣tion,
and the necessity of soon removing
from it, recurred to her more forcibly than
ever. She endeavoured, as she went down
stairs, to regain her composure, apprehen∣sive
that the strangers, if not the family,
might remark her emotion. But she soon
found that there was little to be appre∣hended
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
from either the one or the other:
Captain Thorold was walking arm in arm
before the house with Captain Musgrave,
the elder of the two gentlemen, and Miss
Thorold wholly monopolized the attention
of Mr. Bettenson, a very young man, heir
to a considerable fortune, who had a few
months before, on his leaving Eton, pur∣chased
a Cornetcy of horse, very much
against the inclinations of his father, whose
only son he was. He could indeed give
no other reason for his preference to a mi∣litary
life, but that he supposed it to be a
very idle life, and that he should look un∣commonly
well in the uniform of the corps.</P>
<P>This however did not succeed to his
wishes, though he was very far from being
aware how entirely they had failed. He
had a very round back, very narrow shoul∣ders,
a long forlorn face, to which the
feathered helmet gave neither grace nor
spirit; and the defects of his mean and ill
formed figure were rendered more apparent
by that dress, which is an advantage to a
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
well made and graceful man. He had twice
danced with Belle Thorold at the provin∣cial
assemblies towards the end of winter,
and now, after having been in town for a
few weeks, prevailed on Captain Musgrave
to introduce him to a family, where he
supposed he might find a <HI>monstrous good
lounge</HI> for the rest of the time he was to be
quartered in the neighbourhood. Celestina
no sooner saw Miss Thorold's behaviour to
this young man than she accounted at once
for the dissatisfaction she had shewn at her
joining the party; for she endeavoured by
more than her usual vivacity to monopolize
all his attention; she watched with uneasy
curiosity every glance of his eye towards
Celestina; and seeing that he hardly no∣ticed
her being among them, and was not
struck with that beauty which the Captain
and Montague had so admired, she pre∣sently
reassumed her usual confidence in
her own attractions, and thought only of
securing the advantage she had gained.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95"/>
Celestina, not having the remotest wish
to interfere with her conquests, and being
displeased and offended at the curious looks
and whispers of the two other military men,
who continued to saunter on before, was again
under the necessity of listening to Monta∣gue,
who never failed seizing every op∣portunity
obliquely to hint to her the en∣creasing
admiration with which she had in∣spired
him, though he at the same time
gave her to understand that he knew he had
nothing to expect but her pity and her
friendship.</P>
<P>This was however repeated till it be∣came
very uneasy to her; and the more so,
because so respectful was his address that
she seldom knew how to shew resentment,
and so sincere appeared his repentance,
when she expressed any, that she could
not long retain it.</P>
<P>As they now followed the rest of the
party, Celestina took occasion to ask
Montague for the paper she had been
teized out of in the morning. "I know
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
not," said she, on his evasive answer,
"whether my folly in giving it, or your
absurdity in keeping it, be the greater.
Pray restore it, and let us think no more
of such trifling—"</P>
<P>"I will give you," answered he, "a
copy of it, which I have already began to
write; but for the original—" He
stopped, and suddenly seizing her hand,
pressed it to his breast; where, under his
waistcoat, the paper was enfolded. "There,"
said he—"there is your paper. I have
put it next my heart, and never shall it be
displaced unless you will give me some yet
dearer memorial to remain there."</P>
<P>Celestina withdrew her hand in confu∣sion;
and feeling more than ever the neces∣sity
of putting an end to such sort of con∣duct,
she said, with evident displeasure
and concern—"You behave, Mr. Mon∣tague,
not only improperly in this foolish
matter, but cruelly and insultingly towards
me, who have, you know, at this time no
proper home to receive me; but since you
thus persecute me with conversation, from
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
which, though I cannot escape, I can only
hear with concern and resentment, I must
as soon as possible find another temporary
abode, and acknowledging all your father's
kindness, quit his house."</P>
<P>The young man, who, amidst his wild
enthusiasm, wanted neither sense nor gene∣rosity,
was now shocked at her supposing
he meant to insult her; and terrified at the
idea of her being driven to inconvenience
by leaving his father's house—"I am al∣ways
offending," said he, in a voice ex∣pressive
of the concern he felt, "and I am
afraid often wrong; but pardon me once
more, Miss De Mornay, pardon and pity
me, and I will not again trespass on your
patience with discourse which perhaps you
ought not to hear; though surely the happy
Willoughby himself would not be alarmed
at the hopeless admiration of a man—who
knows, that he can never pretend to any
other than distant and humble adoration:
<Q><L>It were all one</L>
<L>That I should love a bright particular star.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98"/>
He was going on, when Captain Tho∣rold,
who had imperceptibly slackened his
pace, caught these words, which were
spoken in a theatrical tone, and stopping
with his friend, Celestina and Montague
were immediately close to them. "So,
Montague," said he, "at the old game.
Miss De Mornay, I barr all quotations.
'Tis not fair for Montague to avail himself
at once of his own talents and those of all
the poets and sonnetteers he is acquainted
with."</P>
<P>"He will avail himself of neither, Sir,"
answered Celestina, "and I assure you I
wish our conversation to become more ge∣neral."</P>
<P>"There, Montague," cried the Cap∣tain,
"you see you have tired Miss De
Mornay in your tete a tete; let us see if
Musgrave and I cannot more successfully
entertain her.</P>
<P>Celestina, who did not promise herself
much advantage from the change, since
Captain Thorold's address to her was often
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
as warm as his brother's, but never so
respectful, now hastened forward to join
Miss Thorold; but she received no no∣tice
either from her or her little military
beau: they were by this time however
near the end of their walk, and were met
by the family of Mr. Cranfield, to whom
the pond belonged which they were to
see fished. The children, several fine
boys, now at home for their Easter holy∣days,
were assembled round it eager and
delighted. Montague, who was a great
favourite in the neighbourhood, was en∣gaged
in talking with their mother and
with them; while their father, having
civilly noticed the whole party, entered
into conversation with the gentlemen;
and Miss Thorold and Mr. Bettenson still
continuing to entertain each other, regard∣less
of every body else, Celestina, who
was fatigued by her walk, and still more
by the uneasiness of her reflections, sat
down under one of the trees which over∣shadowed
the pond; and her thoughts,
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
which had long been distracted by inter∣ruptions,
were immediately with Wil∣loughby.
So intirely indeed was she
for some moments absorbed in reflection,
that though she saw objects moving be∣fore
her, and heard the shouts of the
boys, the mixed voices of the party
who surrounded the water, and the ser∣vants
who were drawing the nets, she
totally forgot where she was, and was
insensible even of that want of common
politeness which the whole party evinced
in so entirely neglecting her. Montague,
however, could not long be guilty of it;
but disengaging himself from Mrs. Cran∣field,
who was one of those incessant
talkers from whom it is difficult to escape,
he came towards her; and fearful of re∣newing
the displeasure she had so forcibly
expressed a quarter of an hour before, he
only named his fears that she might
receive injury by fitting on the grass; to
which, as she gave a cold and re∣luctant
answer, he added a deep sigh,
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
and then leaning against the tree under
which she sat, he fell into a reverie as
deep as her own. From this mournful
silence she was roused by the sudden
appearance of an horseman, who rode
very fast near her, and who, on lifting
up her eyes, she immediately discovered to
be Vavasour.</P>
<P>A thousand painful sensations arose on
the sight of him; though the first idea
that occurred was, that he came from
Willoughby. He passed her, however,
without seeing her, and reaching the party
who were beyond her, he gave his horse to
his servant and joined them.</P>
<P>By the manner in which Vavasour ad∣dressed
Mr. Cranfield, and the manner in
which he was received by him, Celestina
immediately understood that he was an
expected guest. "He comes not to me,"
said she. "Willoughby sends no friend
to me! He is far, far off! and perhaps
his most intimate acquaintance may now
shun as assiduously as he once sought me."
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
Then the fears she had. once entertained
that some difference of opinion had occa∣sioned
a quarrel between him and Wil∣loughby
recurred to her; and remember∣ing
how different her situation had been
when he abruptly left Alvestone, and how
very cruel was the change, she grew dis∣tressed
at the thoughts of meeting Vava∣sour,
and meeting him before so many
strangers: she again repented having
walked out, and her soul sickened at the
many uncomfortable occurrences to which
she was continually exposed.</P>
<P>In a few moments, Vavasour, who
seemed to have lost none of his viva∣city,
had been introduced to the Captain
and Miss Thorold, but he hardly made
his bow to them before he said to the
latter—"Miss De Mornay is with you still,
Madam; is she not?"</P>
<P>"With us?" replied Arabella. "Oh!
yes—Miss De Mornay is with us."</P>
<P>"She is well I hope?" enquired Vava∣sour
eagerly.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103"/>
"You may satisfy yourself by personal
enquiry,". said Mrs. Cranfield, "for there
is the young lady. She and Mr. Montague
really form a very picturesque appear∣ance."</P>
<P>Vavasour, now turning his eyes on the
opposite side, saw Celestina, and instantly
advanced towards her with an eagerness
of manner which he took no pains to
check. She arose on his approach; and
hardly knowing how to receive him, so
various and painful were her sensations,
she held out her hand to him, then with∣drew
it; and when he spoke to her with
all that good humour with which he used
to approach her in her happier days, it
brought those days back to her mind so
forcibly, that she could not conquer her
emotion, and burst into tears. Vavasour
was immediately checked; and said, with
evident concern—"My dear Miss De
Mornay, the pleasure I felt in again seeing
you conquered for a moment the recollec∣tion
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
of what has happened since we parted
last."</P>
<P>"It is a subject," said Celestina, trying
to recover herself, "on which I cannot
now talk: yet—" and she moved a few
steps forward to escape the earnest looks of
Montague Thorold, which were fixed on
her face—"yet I cannot help asking if
you have seen your friend since—"</P>
<P>Vavasour, walking on with her to avoid
the observation of the company, said—"Seen
him? to be sure I have: I was con∣tinually
with him in London all the while
he remained there."</P>
<P>Celestina now proceeded in silence, struck
with the idea that Willoughby had cer∣tainly
acquainted his friend during that
time with the reason of their abrupt sepa∣ration.
She had not, however, courage to
ask him; but having wiped away the tears
which a moment before filled her eyes, she
turned them upon him with a look so ex∣pressive
of what passed in her heart, that
Vavasour, who could not misunderstand
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
her, answered, as if she had spoken to
him—"I do not <HI>certainly</HI> know the cause
of George's very sudden and extraordinary
change of measures; but I have reason to
believe the Castlenorths, though how I
cannot tell, were the occasion of it. Though
I was with him every day, I had very
little conversation with him, for he always
affected to be, or really was hurried if I saw
him in the course of the day; or, if towards
night, complaining of fatigue, and taking
laudanum, without which he said he could
not sleep. When he informed me of his
having left you at Alvestone without ac∣counting
for his absence, he saw my asto∣nishment,
and put an end at once to my
enquiries by saying—"Vavasour, you know
my unbounded confidence in you, and
that any thing that related merely to my∣self
would be known to you as the first
friend of my heart; but do not ask me
any questions now: I cannot answer
them truly, and therefore I will not be
liable to them: even your friendship
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
and zeal can here do me no good."
This," continued Vavasour, "precluded
all enquiry; nor could I obtain any farther
satisfaction, when a few days afterwards,
the very day indeed before he left Lon∣don,
he desired I would meet him at the
chambers of Edwards, our mutual attorney,
where, in spite of my resistance, he paid me
the money which you know I lent him, with
the interest, with as much regularity as if I
had fixed that time for payment; and when
I very warmly remonstrated on the un∣friendly
appearance this had, besought
him to oblige me by keeping the money,
and expressed something like resentment
at his conduct, he said, with a sort of af∣fected
calmness, and almost sternly—"Va∣vasour,
I am going abroad. I may die,
and I will not leave any thing between
us to be settled by Lady Molyneux,
who would be my heir at law; and do
not you," added he, "my good friend,
get a habit of throwing your four or five
thousands about you, but learn to value
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
money a little more—" And friends a
little less, said I, interrupting him in my
quick way; for that, Willoughby, is the
next lesson I expect to hear from you.
This money, however, Edwards shall keep
till you are quite sure you do not want it.
"I am already sure of it," said he, "and
do beg, my dear Vavasour, that you will
immediately pay it into the hands of the
person from whom you borrowed it for
my use, as the only way in which it can
now contribute to my satisfaction." Wil∣loughby
then left me with the attorney,
of whom I enquired if he could guess
where he got the money; Edwards as∣sured
me he could not, as he knew no∣thing
more of the affair than that he was
that day to pay it at his chambers to me."</P>
<P>This circumstance seemed, in the mind
of Celestina, to confirm the notion Vava∣sour
had started, that the Castlenorths were
somehow or other the cause of Willough∣by's
having left her; yet, as they could
have no power over him from affection or
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
friendship, their influence, if indeed they
possessed any, must arise from their riches;
and what was such a supposition but to
suppose him a sudden convert to merce∣nary
politics, from being generous and
disinterested even to excess, if such noble
qualities could ever lean towards error.
The mind of Celestina no sooner harboured
such an idea than her heart rejected it;
but all she heard from Vavasour tended
only to augment her perplexity and her
sorrow, which, as he perfectly under∣stood,
she saw that he would if he could
have removed.</P>
<P>Almost afraid of asking any question,
where it was easy to see he could not an∣swer
without wounding her, she acquired,
after a few moments, resolution to say—"Where,
Sir, did you at last part from
him? What did he then say to you?"</P>
<P>"I took leave of him at the hotel where
he lodged, and where I had been with him
for about an hour before the chaise came
to the door. He was sometimes very
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
grave, and even dejected for a few mo∣ments,
then tried by hurry and bustle to
drive away his dejection. I asked him why
he went to the South of France, where he
had been before, rather than to Spain and
Sicily, which he had often expressed an
inclination to see: he answered, that he
had business in France; "but it is more
than probable," continued he, "that I may
see Spain and Sicily, or Turkey for aught
I know, before I return to England."</P>
<P>"And did he," enquired Celestina
mournfully—"did he say nothing of me?
did he not even mention me?"</P>
<P>"Very often," replied Vavasour, "for
indeed I forced him into the conversation."</P>
<P>"Did there <HI>need force</HI> then?" said Ce∣lestina
in a plaintive tone, and ready to
melt into tears.</P>
<P>"Yes," answered Vavasour; "for
though I believe he thought of nothing
so much, he seemed frequently unwilling
to trust his voice with your name; and
sometimes, after we had been speaking
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
of you, he sunk into a gloomy reverie, and
reluctantly spoke at all. One great object
of his solicitude was your future residence.
He seemed however very easy while you
were under Mr. Thorold's protection.
Tell me, are you yourself happy in his fa∣mily?"</P>
<P>"Happy!" said Celestina; "<HI>can</HI> I be
<HI>happy</HI> any where?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps not just now: but you know
what I mean when I use the common term
<HI>happy.</HI> Are you satisfied with your resi∣dence?
Do you mean to continue there?"</P>
<P>"I hardly know," sighed Celestina,
"what I mean. So heavy, so unexpected
was the blow that fell upon me, that my
stunned senses have not yet recovered it;
and for happiness—I am afraid it never
can be mine."</P>
<P>"Well, my sweet friend, though I
hope and believe otherwise, we will not
talk now either of our hopes or fears: but
are the family you are with pleasant peo∣ple?
of whom do they consist?"</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111"/>
"Of Mr. Thorold, to whose worth
you have heard Willoughby do justice, of
his wife, his daughter, and, at present, of
two sons."</P>
<P>"Yes, I see the Captain is among you."</P>
<P>"You know him then?"</P>
<P>"A little. Some friends of mine are
acquainted with him. He is a man of
great gallantry I have heard, and affects
the very first world; does he not?"</P>
<P>"Really I hardly know. Yes, I believe
he may be that sort of man."</P>
<P>"Celebrated, I think, for having sent
more young women broken hearted to
Bristol than either Charles Cavendish or
Ned Hervey. That is the sort of praise
that attracts your hearts, while we rattle∣headed
fellows, who are very honest though
not very refined, who say no more than
we mean, and address you—not as god∣desses,
only to laugh at you for believing
us, but as mere mortal women, are called
rakes and libertines and I know not what;
as if twenty such careless, I had almost said
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
harmless, lads as we are, do half as much
mischief as one of those plausible, senti∣mental,
sighing sycophants, who mean no∣thing
but the gratification of their own
paltry vanity."</P>
<P>"Bless me, Mr. Vavasour," cried Ce∣lestina,
won a moment from her own an∣guish
by this odd remark, "you seem as
much discomposed as if the redoubtable
Captain had sent some favourite of your
own to Bristol."</P>
<P>"No, upon my soul—my favourities—I
speak pretty plainly you know: <HI>my ac∣quaintance</HI>
have in every instance <HI>but one</HI>
lain among people, not easily sent to Bris∣tol.
Come now don't affect prudery. I
tell you though, Celestina, that had such
a fellow sent a sister of mine to recover
health, ruined by the disappointment of
expectations he had raised, I believe I
should try if I could not stop his career."</P>
<P>"It is fortunate then, perhaps, for the
Captain, that you have no sister."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113"/>
"I may, however, have friends," added
he, earnestly fixing his eyes on the face of
Celestina—"I may have friends, for
whom I may be as much interested as
I could be for the nearest relation; and
them I would put upon their guard."</P>
<P>"I would very fain misunderstand you,"
said Celestina, "because I think you ought
to know that, situated as I am, I need no
such precaution: or you must have a mean
opinion of me indeed, if, knowing Mr.
Willoughby, you can suppose that she
who has once been attached to him, can
throw away a thought upon Captain Tho∣rold?"</P>
<P>"Aye that's true—all very true and
very fine; but look ye, my dear Celestina,
I've no way of judging of others but
from myself, and (though to be sure I
don't speak from experience in these ho∣nourable
sentimental sort of treaties) I
am confoundedly afraid that had I been
engaged to Helen, and found that by
some cursed counter stroke of fortune her
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
divinityship was not to be had, that after
a little raving and swearing and scamper∣ing
about the world to get her out of my
head, I should have fallen in love with—"</P>
<P>"With Andromache," said Celestina,
helping him to a comparison, and smiling.</P>
<P>"Oh no!" answered he, "she was
too wise and too melancholy for me:
your weeping and tragical beauties would
make me cry, but never could make me
love. Faith I think Briseis or Chryseis
would have been more to my taste."</P>
<P>"Or Cressida perhaps?"</P>
<P>"Oh! she would have suited me ex∣actly."</P>
<P>"Well Sir!" said Celestina, re-assuming
her gravity, "you undoubtedly follow
the golden rule in judging of others; but
give me leave to assure you that in the
present instance it would mislead you, and
that you are the only man in the world
from whom I could listen to such a suppo∣sition
without resentment. You, however,
do not, I know, mean to hurt me."</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115"/>
"No that I don't by heaven," cried he,
kissing her hand, "and so do now tell me
how and when I can see you again."</P>
<P>"I cannot tell; since it probably de∣pends
on your stay in this country."</P>
<P>"That depends then upon you."</P>
<P>"Upon me!"</P>
<P>"Yes, upon you: for I came down
with no other intention in the world than
to enquire after and see you; and for that
purpose only have consented to undergo
the company of Cranfield and his wife:
very good sort of people indeed, but
confounded bores; who have invited me
down these two years, and whose invi∣tation
nothing but their being within four
miles of Thorold's would have made me
accept."</P>
<P>Celestina was at a loss what answer to
make to this, because she did not know
whether he meant to impute his solicitude
to the care he took of Willoughby's inte∣rest,
or simply to his friendship for her,
for of any warmer interest than friendship
she had not the remotest idea. She had,
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
however, no time to answer, for Monta∣gue
Thorold, who had followed them
with his eyes ever since they parted from
the rest of the company, now came hastily
on towards them to say his sister was re∣turning
home.</P>
<P>Celestina rejoined them immediately;
and after Mr. and Mrs. Cranfield and
their guest had been invited and con∣sented
to dine with the Thorold family
the next day, they separated, Vavasour be∣traying
a violent inclination to attend
Celestina home, and seeming to repress it
with great difficulty from the habit he was
in of doing whatever pleased himself with∣out
considering whether what he did was,
according to the established forms of the
world, rude or polite. He felt, however,
that to quit his hospitable friends on the
moment of his arrival would be carrying
his carelesness a little too far; and there∣fore
after lingering as long as he could, he
reluctantly left her to Montague Thorold,
who had walked silently by her for some
moments, and wished her a good day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, in whose mind a
thousand painful thoughts had been re∣vived
by this interview, was too much
lost in them to attend to Montague Tho∣rold,
who still in silent dejection walked
by her, while his brother was engaged
with Arabella and his military friends.
Montague had narrowly watched her the
whole time she had been conversing with
Vavasour; and, though hopeless himself,
could not see her receive another with
such an appearance of interest as he had
remarked towards Vavasour, without mor∣tification.
"Mr Vavasour," said he at
last, "for that I think is the gentleman's
name—Mr. Vavasour is an old acquaintance
of yours?"</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
"A very particular friend of Mr. Wil∣loughby's,"
replied she; "and of course
a friend of mine."</P>
<P>"A single man I suppose?"</P>
<P>"I believe so," said Celestina; "at
least I never heard he was married; and
you see he has not a very sober, married
look."</P>
<P>"No really, very much otherwise. But he
does not seem to have communicated any
portion of his gaiety to you."</P>
<P>"I am not indeed greatly disposed to
be gay," said Celestina; "and since I am
not merry, would it not be as well to be
wise. Do Mr. Montague, give me that
silly paper: its detension is useless to you
and disagreeable to me."</P>
<P>"Pardon me then if for once I am
guilty of what offends you. I cannot part
with it. But it is my first and shall be my
last offence."</P>
<P>"I hope so," said Celestina very
gravely. "The thing is in itself of no
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
consequence, and I wonder you should be
so childishly anxious to keep it."</P>
<P>"Your hands have touched it; your
letters are upon it; you composed the
lines."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried she impatiently,
and willing to put an end to a speech to
which she feared the Captain might listen;
"since you will not give it me or destroy
it, the only favour I have to ask is, that
you will never speak of it again, either to
me or any other person."</P>
<P>"A needless precaution!" exclaimed
he, "a very needless precaution is the
latter; and, alas! in the former I cannot
trespass long, for in a few days, a very
few days, I return to Oxford, and I shall
then be no more liable to excite your dis∣pleasure:
you will cease to recollect that
such a being exists."</P>
<P>"No indeed," said Celestina; whoever
is dear to Mr. Thorold, to your father, to
whom I am so much obliged, must have
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
a claim to my recollection and my good
wishes."</P>
<P>"Oh! how cold does that sound from
those lips," said he, "and how little
those expressive eyes are calculated to talk
of mere good wishes. They are so en∣chanting
when they say more, when they
look as they did just now on Mr. Vavasour.
How I envied him the simple "God bless
"you!" and—"Adieu, Mr. Vavasour," and
the look that accompanied them."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried Celestina. "Really,
Mr. Montague, the style to which you
have accustomed yourself destroys all
conversation. If however that adieu
was so enviable, I will bid you farewel
with quite as much sincerity. God bless
you, and adieu, Mr. Montague. They
were now very near home, and Celestina,
hastening forward, crossed the garden by
a nearer way and reached her own room.</P>
<P>She there began once more to meditate
on her situation. Every day that she had
passed at Mr. Thorold's house had en∣creased
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
her desire to leave it, and she now
more than ever regretted that she knew
not whither to go. Her concern was en∣creased
by a note brought to her from the
neighbouring village, from whence she
had early that morning sent to her former
abode at Thorpe Heath to enquire whether,
if she had occasion for them, she could
again have her former lodgings: the an∣swer
imported that the old man and his
wife had died within a few days of each
other, the week before, and that the house
now belonged to one of the sons, who had
a large family of his own, and intended
to remove into it himself, as being more
convenient than his former habitation.</P>
<P>This forlorn hope being entirely over,
her reflections on her situation became
more painful, since she now knew not one
place in the world where she could with
propriety go. She had once or twice
consulted Cathcart on the subject; who
not being aware of the circumstances
which rendered her present abode uneasy
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
to her, and knowing how much Wil∣loughby
desired her to continue there,
rather discouraged than promoted any
scheme for her removal; flattering him∣self,
that the time was not far distant when
her presence would give, in the opinion of
Jessy and his own, a charm to the house
they hoped to call their own.</P>
<P>Celestina was well aware of his reasons
for wishing her to remain where she was,
and did not love to explain her's for de∣siring
to remove, least she should appear
at once fastidious and vain. She could
not relate to Cathcart, what after all
might be fancy, that Mrs. Thorold did
not love her though she was civil to her;
that Miss Thorold beheld her sometimes
with dislike and never with friendship;
and that of the two brothers, the elder
often affected to entertain her with conver∣sation,
such as, though she could not
directly complain of it, she could not hear
without being offended and mortified;
while the younger never ceased pursuing
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
her with declarations of romantic attach∣ment,
less disgusting, but equally if not
more improper for her to listen to.</P>
<P>In Mr. Thorold she had always a steady
friend and a disinterested adviser; but to
him she could not state the reasons that
made his house uncomfortable and his
kindness useless, nor complain that his
wife and daughter slighted, or his sons
made love to her; and though he pos∣sessed
a very uncommon share of discern∣ment,
he seemed determined not to per∣ceive
either himself. On no plan of re∣moval,
however, could she at present de∣termine,
and had fixed on nothing but to
find an opportunity to hint her discontent
to Vavasour, when she was called down to
dinner.</P>
<P>The two military strangers were gone;
but Celestina found they were engaged to
dine there the next day with the Cranfield
family and Mr. Vavasour; and Mrs. Tho∣rold,
who piqued herself above all other
things on giving as good entertainments
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
as some of her neighbours who kept men
cooks, was so impatient to prepare for the
dinner of the next day, that she would
hardly give herself time to eat that of the
present, but hurried away to her store
room the instant the cloth was removed.
Arabella had yet a more important concern
to attend to; Mr. Bettenson had been so
lavish of his compliments, which were in∣deed
the only sort of conversation <HI>be</HI> was
at all perfect in, that she had no doubt of
having made, if not an absolute conquest,
at least such an impression on his heart
as another interview would make inde∣lible;
and though his extravagant praises,
and the heavy language of two rolling
black eyes, (which in lustre and shape
Montague compared to two pickled wal∣nuts,)
had not so far blinded the judg∣ment
of Arabella but that she saw he was
extremely weak, she considered his great
fortune, and that if he could not lead, he
would probably submit to be driven, for
which she thought she had all possible ta∣lents
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
and was sure she had all possible
inclination. He had not a title indeed,
but was the third or fourth cousin of a man
that had; of course he was a man of fa∣mily
himself; and had he not been so, had
his birth been mean and his person less
tolerable, his fortune would not have suf∣fered
her a moment to consider either as of
any consequence. But though she enter∣tained
a very great inclination, and a very
well grounded hope to secure Bettenson,
she had not the least objection to make an
experiment at the same time on Vavasour,
who had a still better fortune with a very
handsome figure; and who she had heard
described, as one of those agreeable rakes,
who are blamed and loved by all their
acquaintance. She had heard too that he
declared himself not to be a marrying
man; the greater therefore would be her
glory, should she happen to charm him
into other sentiments; and when she
looked in the glass she thought nothing
more probable. As to Celestina, besides
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
her engagements with Willoughby, she
considered her as quite out of the question.
Neither Captain Musgrave or Bettenson
had taken any notice of her, and the latter
had declared he thought her far from
handsome. Arabella therefore saw nothing
to impede her success; and even fancied,
that as she intended to be infinitely lively
and entertaining, the melancholy air and
pensive face of Celestina would produce a
contrast extremely to her advantage. While
her mother therefore was busy with her
jelly and custards, Arabella was preparing
her artillery against the hearts of her ex∣pected
guests; and Celestina, who dared
not venture out least she should meet
Montague Thorold, who had placed him∣self
where she could not escape him, re∣mained
the whole evening alone in her
own room, where she formed a sketch of
the letter she intended to write to Wil∣loughby.</P>
<P>This employment, by fixing her thoughts
entirely on the object which broke in upon
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
every other that at any time of necessity
engaged them, quieted and soothed her
spirits; she forgot every thing but her wish to
convince him of her unfailing attachment,
and to pour out before him a heart that was
entirely his own. She determined, how∣ever,
not to finish her letter till after she
had talked to Vavasour; and then recol∣lected
that she could not tell Willoughby
the result of that conference, without as∣signing
her reasons for desiring to quit a
protection, where he had himself directed
her to remain. This was an irksome task
to her; for if he should happen to think
her objections frivolous, he would be dis∣pleased
that for those she removed, and if
he thought them just, the idea of rivalry
would add to the uneasiness which she
knew her unsettled situation would oc∣casion
to him. Thus undetermined, she
could rest on nothing but the hope that
Vavasour might, from his dislike to one
or other of the Thorolds, (for he was too
frequently extremely fastidious and disliked
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
with all his heart) agree with her in the
necessity there was for her change of
abode, without enquiring into all the
reasons that made her desire it.</P>
<P>By the bustle she heard below in the
housekeeper's room, which was under part
of her's, and by the frequent running up
and down of Arabella's maid, and the
universal hurry of the household, except
Mr. Thorold, who on these occasions re∣tired
to his study for the evening, Celestina
found she should rather accommodate than
offend if she declined supping below. She
sent down a note therefore, saying she was
much fatigued with her morning's walk,
and begged to be excused for the evening,
and received a verbal answer that Mrs.
Thorold desired she would do as was most
agreeable to her. Montague, however,
who despairing of her coming out to walk,
had at last sauntered away alone, no sooner
found on his return that he was not to see
her at supper, than he went up himself,
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
and tapping softly at the door, enquired if
she was not well?</P>
<P>"Oh! perfectly well," said she, "but
tired by my walk of this morning, and
not disposed to eat any supper."</P>
<P>"Surely," cried he, "if you are tired
you will need something. You did not
drink tea, and yet will have no supper: let
me get something for you?"</P>
<P>Celestina declined this however as po∣litely
as she could; but Montague was not
to be repulsed so easily. He went down
therefore, and returning in a few minutes,
besought her to open the door and take
some of the wine and water he had brought
her. Distressed by civility, which it seemed
so rude to refuse and so painful to accept,
she hesitated a moment, and then opened
the door, when taking one of the glasses
she thanked him and would have wished
him good night; but he looked earnestly
in her face—"Ah!" said he, "tears!
you have been weeping again! always in
tears! You have been writing too—writing
to the fortunate Willoughby?"</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>
"Pray dont teaze me so," cried Celes∣tina:
"if I have cause for tears, you
should remember that the greatest kindness
you can do me is permitting me to indulge
them; and it signifies not who I write
to."</P>
<P>"It signifies no more indeed," said
Montague, with a deep drawn sigh, "than
as it excites my envy and my regret."</P>
<P>"Well, well, good night to you," in∣terrupted
Celestina. "Pray dont let me
keep you from supper."</P>
<P>"Oh!" said he, putting his foot within
the door so as to prevent her shutting it,
"I have had my supper. One look suf∣fices
me:
<Q><L>Loose now and then</L>
<L>A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shakspeare.</NOTE></L></Q>
Ah! you remember those delicious lines
of that most elegant of our English
poetesses:
<Q><L>It is to be all bathed in tears;</L>
<L>To live upon a smile for years;</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="131"/>
To lie whole ages at a beauty's feet;</L>
<L>To kneel, to languish, to implore,</L>
<L>And still, tho' she disdain, adore.</L>
<L>It is to do all this, and think thy sufferings sweet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Barbauld.</NOTE></L></Q>
Shall I go on? for the whole of that
beautiful song is exactly descriptive of my
feelings:
<Q><L>It is to hope, tho' hope were lost,</L>
<L>Tho' heaven and earth thy passion crost.</L></Q>
But you are angry?"</P>
<P>"I am at least tired," said Celestina,
"and must beg you would no longer de∣tain
me."</P>
<P>Give me your hand then in token
that we part in peace.</P>
<Q><L>Ma poi di pace in pegno</L>
<L>La bella man mi diè.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Metastasio.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>"There, Sir," said Celestina coldly,
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
"there is my hand, and now good
night."</P>
<P>"Oh that I dared seal my forgiveness
upon it," cried he, eagerly pressing it.
"But I dare not."</P>
<P>Celestina withdrew her hand, and again
repeating a cold good night, he at length
permitted her to shut the door.</P>
<P>These frequent declarations, which she
could not affect to misunderstand, greatly
disturbed her; and so well aware was she
of the impropriety of suffering them, that
she was determined no consideration should
induce her to remain another week, if Mr.
Montague was not really returning within
that time to Oxford. She had heard him
repeatedly laughed at by his father, his
brother, and his sister, for his parox∣ysms
of love: if his present attention to
her was only a return of the fit, she felt
herself degraded by being made the object
of it; and if it was more serious, she thought
herself to blame to suffer his assiduities, on
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
account of his father, though she knew
not very well how to put an end to them.
Much less appearance of passion would
have made many young women believe
him ready to take the lover's leap, or to
apply laudanum or gunpowder as a re∣medy;
but Celestina, though not uncon∣scious
of her personal advantages, had none
of that overweening vanity which make so
many of inferior attractions fancy them∣selves
irresistible, nor any of that unfeeling
coquetry, which would be gratified by
the despair of a man capable of real attach∣ment:
she wished to put an end to Mon∣tague's
persecuting admiration both for his
sake and her own; and after some reflec∣tions,
concluded, that it would be better
to take an opportunity of speaking to him
the next day, and declaring to him that
his extravagant behaviour would compel
her to quit the house and lose the ac∣quaintance
of his family; for she thought,
notwithstanding all his romantic flights, he
had so much good sense, that he would see
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
the impropriety, and indeed the cruelty of
his conduct, if it were once fairly repre∣sented
to him. She now almost repented
that she had not listened with more pa∣tience
to the boasting egotism of the Cap∣tain,
and had taken shelter from his equi∣vocal
compliments in the more agreeable
because more literary conversation of Mon∣tague;
and again she reflected, with bitter∣ness
of heart, that whether Montague went
or stayed, his brother's character, and in∣deed
his manners towards her, made her
remaining where she was extremely im∣proper;
yet that no eligible situation of∣fered:
and for the first time, since she had
left Lady Molyneux, she formed a half
wish to be again with her, though she
knew she had there little kindness and no
real friendship to expect.</P>

<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE preparations for a splendid din∣ner
succeeded admirably, and Mrs. Tho∣rold
was in high good humour when her
guests arrived. Arabella was still better
pleased; for Bettenson, immediately on
his entrance, had protested that she never
looked so well in her life, and Musgrave
whispered to her, that "if she minded her
hits she would be sure of the pretty boy,"
for so he, the Cornet, was termed by his
Captain. Intelligence so conveyed would
have disgusted and offended a young wo∣man
of delicacy, but Belle Thorold was
too eager for conquest, and too resolutely
bent on securing a man of fortune, to
feel or to resent the freedom of this address
from Musgrave, to whose praises of her
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
she knew much of the attention of Betten∣son
was owing. Mr. and Mrs. Cranfield
and Vavasour soon after arrived; and Ce∣lestina
saw with surprise the pains Miss
Thorold took at once to attract the notice
of Vavasour, and encrease the admiration
of Bettenson. She had never before seen
her in the company of young unmarried
men of fortune, and now observed with
concern how totally she defeated her own
purpose. She threw herself into number∣less
attitudes which she fancied becoming;
applied her hand incessantly to rectify a
curl, or adjust her necklace, by which she
thought to display it's beauty as well as
that of her hair, and her throat, which she
had been taught to fancy eminently hand∣some.
 She whispered about nothing,
laughed at some joke which nobody un∣derstood
but herself and Musgrave, then
affected to be angry at something he said
to her, then talked to him by signs across
the table, and by way of being charming
was rude and childish. But this sort of
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
behaviour she had seen practised by some
very fashionable young women; it was
perfectly adapted to the level of Bettenson's
capacity; and she had not judgment enough
to see that it must offend any man who
had either good sense or good breeding.</P>
<P>Vavasour, who in the presence of Celes∣tina
would have seen perfect beauty or ex∣traordinary
merit with indifference, took
no other notice of Arabella than just served
him to remark to Celestina that she was
one of the most conceited and pert girls he
had ever seen. This served, as they
walked after tea in the garden, to intro∣duce
the discourse she wished to hold with
him: but it was extremely difficult to
escape a moment from the vigilant assiduity
of Montague Thorold. "Pray," said she
to Vavasour, "pray be more guarded: her
brother will hear you."</P>
<P>"And that brother," said he, some∣what
abruptly, "you seem very much
afraid of offending, though he seems to
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
me to be a puppy; how can you let him
prate to you as he does?"</P>
<P>"Indeed," replied Celestina, "you
would not dislike him if you knew him;
and it is amazing to me that you, who are
really so good humoured, should take such
dislikes to people before you can possibly
know them."</P>
<P>"And when I do know them I often
dislike them more. Why now, in this
family, who is there but the father that has
any understanding, and he has too much
of the priest about him. But here comes
your highflying Oxonian. Surely it's hard
not to have a moment with you, though
I want to talk to you about Willoughby."</P>
<P>"I will speak to Mr. Montague," said
she, "and tell him so." She then stepped
back a few paces, and meeting Montague
Thorold, who was approaching to join
them, she told him that Mr. Vavasour had
something to communicate to her on be∣half
of their mutual friend Willoughby,
and that she should esteem herself obliged
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
to him if he would prevent their being in∣terrupted
for a few moments.</P>
<P>Montague, with a melancholy and sub∣missive
look, laid his hand on his heart
and said—"One word from you is enough
to him who lives but to obey you." He
then went back to the rest of the party,
casting a wistful look after Celestina, who,
turning into another walk with Vavasour,
said eagerly—"Well, and now what have
you to say to me from Willoughby? have
you heard from him?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Vavasour; "I could
not well do that since yesterday, nor do I
indeed expect it for some time to come:
but do you know, Miss De Mornay, that I
consider myself as Willoughby's representa∣tive,
as a sort of guardian to you, and am
going in that character to talk to you very
seriously."</P>
<P>"Well," cried Celestina, conscious
that her own conduct was irreproachable,
"my sage guardian and reverend monitor,
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
begin then with your remonstrance or ex∣hortation,
whichever it is to be."</P>
<P>"You must give me leave to be serious
on this occasion," answered he.</P>
<P>"Most willingly," replied Celestina,
interrupting him; "and the more so be∣cause
I never remember in all our former
conversations to have had one serious dis∣course
with you, and I long to see how you
acquit yourself."</P>
<P>"I don't like the people you are with,"
said he, "and wish you were any where
else."</P>
<P>"I wish I were any where else myself;
yet I like the family, and believe them to
be very good sort of people."</P>
<P>"Come, come, Celestina, you cannot
be ignorant of what I mean: Captain Tho∣rold,
as I told you yesterday, is that dan∣gerous
and hateful character, a male co∣quet."</P>
<P>"He never coquets with me I assure
you," said she, "for I never give him an
opportunity."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141"/>
"No, because at present his brother has
the advantage of him. If you do not co∣quet
with the military man, at least you
listen to the scholar, and it may be he is
the most dangerous of the two. It is the
general idea of the country that he is in
love with you; that—</P>
<P>"The general idea of the country!"
cried Celestina; "how can the country
possibly know any thing about him or about
me?"</P>
<P>"My dear friend," interrupted Vava∣sour,
"you cannot be ignorant that in
these places the people could not exist if
their curiosity did not keep their idleness
from total stagnation. They will talk, and
let them about one another, but I won't
have them talk of you, who are of ano∣ther
order of beings: in short, I am jealous
of you <HI>for my friend,</HI> and don't like to
hear that Lord Castlenorth has paid off all
Willoughby's incumbrances, and that he
has procured him the reversion of his titles,
to engage him to break off his connection
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
with you, which it is said he formed before
he came of age, and therefore thought him∣self
obliged to fulfil."</P>
<P>Celestina cried with great emotion—"Dear
Sir! but how false and foolish is
all this."</P>
<P>"It is so," resumed Vavasour; "and
what follows is equally or more so, yet it is
I find generally believed."</P>
<P>"And what is it?"</P>
<P>"Why that Willoughby, having scru∣ples
about suddenly leaving you, and leav∣ing
you in comparative indigence, Lord
Castlenorth has given you five thousand
pounds; which, with what was before left
you by Mrs. Willoughby, and the promise
of a very considerable living in the gift of
the Castlenorths to a clergyman if you
marry one, have rendered you a desirable
object in Mr. Thorold's eyes as a wife for
his youngest son, whom finally you have
accepted of, and are to be married to very
soon; as Miss Fitz-Hayman has insisted
upon this before she gives her hand to her
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
cousin, which is also to happen very soon
in Italy."</P>
<P>"Miss Fitz-Hayman!" said Celestina;
turning pale; "and pray, my good Va∣vasour,
where have you learned this le∣gend?"</P>
<P>"In London," replied he, "I collected
enough to make-me uneasy about your si∣tuation.
I picked up more since I came
down to Cranfields, for his wife is a gos∣sip
of the first pretensions; and as to the
Fitz-Hayman part of the story, their going
abroad so soon after Willoughby has, I take
it for granted, confirmed it in the opinion
of every body."</P>
<P>"Are they gone abroad then?" said
Celestina.</P>
<P>"So say the newspapers; and I fancy
rightly." He then took one from his
pocket and read this paragraph:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dover, <DATE>April 26, 17—</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Yesterday Lord and Lady Castle∣north,
and their daughter, the Hon.
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
Miss Fitz-Hayman, with a great retinue,
sailed from hence on their way to the
South of Europe.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Celestina was silent a moment; for not
all her faith on the unchangeable affections
of her lover could guard her from a mo∣mentary
shock: recovering herself how∣ever,
she said—"They may be, and I
suppose <HI>are</HI> gone; but—certainly—cer∣tainly
Mr. Willoughby had no share in
their going. You surely do not think he
had? As we know some part—great part
of what you have heard, to be utterly
false and unfounded, why may it not all be
so? Certainly you do not believe any of it."</P>
<P>"Pardon me," answered Vavasour, "I
believe that this young man, this Monta∣gue
Thorold, is what they call in love with
you; for the rest, I know some of it is false,
and I believe the greatest part of it is so."</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven! you have doubts
then, Vavasour: doubts whether Wil∣loughby—But
it is impossible you <HI>can</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
doubt it. You know he is all honour, ge∣nerosity,
integrity, and goodness."</P>
<P>"I know I always thought so, or I
should not have loved him better than any
man breathing. But don't let me alarm
you; I cannot doubt when I recollect all I
ever knew of my friend: yet I very ho∣nestly
tell you, that the mystery he made
to me of his reasons for going abroad, the
gloomy reveries in which I so often saw
him, his evident struggles with himself,
and a thousand odd circumstances which
struck me when we were last together—upon
my soul, Celestina, I know not what
to think, and should deceive you were I
to tell you that I have no doubts: yet they
arise rather from my mistrust of human na∣ture
in general than my opinion of George
as an individual: but when I look at you,
and remember that he was within one day
of calling you his, I cannot upon any com∣mon
principles account for his conduct,
and am sure that no common motives can
justify it."</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
Celestina, whose heart sunk within her
while it could not deny the justice of this
remark, sighed deeply, but remained silent;
and Vavasour went on—"Be <HI>his</HI> motives,
however, what they may, it is certainly
your determination to await the event of
this mysterious journey?"</P>
<P>"It is certainly," said she faintly.</P>
<P>"Well then, is there not any more eli∣gible
situation for you than one where you
are the subject of such reports as I have just
repeated to you? Suppose, if it be only
for supposition sake, they were to reach
Willoughby: if he still loves you—"</P>
<P>"If!" repeated Celestina; "good hea∣ven!
you believe then that it admits of a
question."</P>
<P>"I did not mean to hurt you. But my
dear Celestina, there is nothing so insecure
as our affections I am afraid; and you
must recollect too many instances of their
change to suppose it <HI>quite</HI> impossible that—"</P>
<P>"Well, I will interrupt you no more.
If then—if Willoughby still loves me—"</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/>
"He will suffer extremely from such a
report; and should—though I allow it to
be very improbable—<HI>should</HI> any change
have happened, your apparent approbation
of Montague Thorold will justify that ca∣price
which nothing else <HI>can</HI> justify."</P>
<P>"Ah! Vavasour," said Celestina, in
faultering accents, "I see, I too evidently
see, that you believe your friend is lost to
me for ever, and that all you have now
said is merely to prepare me for a blow,
which, if it fell on me suddenly, would,
you think, destroy me; but believe me,
Vavasour, believe me, suspense such as I
have long endured—such as I at this mo∣ment
endure—is, I <HI>think,</HI> more insupporta∣ble
than any certainty could be, unless it
were the certainty that Willoughby is more
miserable than I am: that I think I could
not bear: but for the rest, however I might
suffer in my pride or in my love, I trust
that my mind would in time be reconciled
to whatever is inevitable; and perhaps,"
continued she, struggling with the violent
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
emotion she felt—"perhaps that very
pride might assist me to cure the anguish
of disappointed and improperly indulged
affection. But yet it is surely impossible
Willoughby <HI>can</HI> have acted as these sus∣picions
in regard to Miss Fitz Hayman
would make me imagine, and still write as
he writes to me! However, Vavasour, I
again entreat you, if you know more than
I do, to conceal nothing from me through
misplaced and needless tenderness."</P>
<P>"You know me very little," answered
Vavasour, "or you would know how little
concealment and dissimulation are in my
nature. My dear Miss De Mornay, I have
faithfully related to you all I know of our
friend, and even my half formed doubts I
have not attempted to conceal from you:
be now equally ingenuous with me, and
tell me, whether you think your present
situation is either the most pleasant or the
most eligible you could possibly chuse."</P>
<P>"It is not pleasant," answered Celestina,
"because I am not mistress of my time;
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
but it is eligible surely, because Willough∣by
himself in some measure placed me in it,
and it is to his wishes I am to attend while
he is yet interested about me, and not to
the vague and unfounded reports of peo∣ple
who care nothing whether I am happy
or miserable, so long as they have some∣thing
to talk of."</P>
<P>"But reflect a moment whether Wil∣loughby,
when he mentioned his desire of
your continuing here, was aware that Cap∣tain
Thorold would <HI>therefore</HI> remain at
home all the summer, or that Montague
Thorold would chuse to make you the
object of his romantic passion, and the sub∣ject
of his poetical panegyric: you cannot
but know that he does both; and were <HI>you</HI>
wilfully blind to it, his behaviour to-day
would have sufficiently convinced <HI>me.</HI>"</P>
<P>Celestina could not deny his extreme
particularity in company, and his private
declarations were less equivocal: without
however acknowledging either to Vavasour,
she said in general, that for many reasons
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
she should not be displeased to change her
residence if she knew whither to go.</P>
<P>Vavasour then began to lament that he
had no mother, no sister, of whose friendly
reception of her he could be assured; "but,"
added he, "my dear Miss De Mornay,
give me a day or two, and some proper
place will perhaps occur to me, or rather
to an excellent female friend whom I will
apply to. In the mean time I will see
Cathcart, as I propose to ride over to Al∣vestone
to-morrow, and we will talk the
business over together." He then took
her hand, and in a manner more tender
and less lively than was usual with him,
asked her if she would pardon him for any
thing he might have said to give her pain.
Celestina assured him she could not forgive
because she had never been offended, but
that she must ever be greatly obliged to
him for the friendly part he had taken; and
then, fearing that some invidious remarks
might be made by the company they had left
if they were any longer absent, she desired
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
Vavasour to rejoin them, while she went
for a few moments to her own room to re∣cover
from the still apparent emotion which
she had been thrown into from what had
passed.</P>
<P>She had hardly, however, time to breathe,
before she saw Montague Thorold walking
anxiously on the lawn before her windows,
looking towards them as if he knew she
was returned to her apartment, and almost
immediately afterwards Mr. Cranfield's
carriage drove up to the door to take them
home. Celestina now, therefore, com∣posing
herself as well as she was able,
hastened down to the company, who, ex∣cept
Montague and Vavasour, were hardly
conscious of her rejoining them: Mr.
Cranfield being busied in giving to the
elder Mr. Thorold a long detail of a cause
that had been lately decided at the sessions
in which he had a principal share; Mrs.
Thorold and Mrs. Cranfield engaged in
settling the affairs of the neighbourhood,
and comparing notes on the frequency of
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
Mr. Langly, the curate's visits to Mrs.
Poole, the widow of a rich farmer, a mat∣ter
in which these good ladies were migh∣tily
interested; while Miss Thorold was
violently flirting with Bettenson; and the
other two military men walking together,
were talking over their former adventures,
and Musgrave laughing at Captain Tho∣rold
for being thrown out, as he termed it,
by his brother with Celestina. "What
the devil," said he, "d'ye bury yourself
alive in this manner for; if Montague is to
supplant you? Faith, my dear Edmund, 'tis
so much against the honour of us all, that
if you don't make more progress I shall try
what I can do myself. Don't you see that
her attachment to Willoughby is all stuff,
and that she throws out her lure for this
Vavasour? If you like her, what a cursed
fool you must be to let her slip through
your fingers."</P>
<P>"As to liking," replied Captain Tho∣rold,
"you don't suppose I intend to
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
commit matrimony. The girl is handsome,
and has more sense than most of them—"</P>
<P>"And therefore 'tis more worth a man's
while to make a fool of her. There I
perfectly agree with you; for though, if I
were condemned by any devilish mischance
to marry, I should dread nothing so much
as one of your sensible women, yet it is
glorious to see how a little foolish flattery
can set the sense of the shrewdest of them
at nought. But by the way, Edmund,
how did you get off with that business in
Ireland?"</P>
<P>"Which? for I had so much business
upon my hands that I don't know what you
mean."</P>
<P>"Why between you and Miss Obrien:
was there not an impertinent brother or—"</P>
<P>"Oh! aye poor Fanny Obrien. 'Twas
the old story: Fanny was very pretty, and
faith I was very fond of being with them
all, for there were three others, all sweet
little dears. Their mother, a good sort of
a widow, was a little upon the <HI>qui vive</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
when she heard I had a fortune and so
forth, and somehow or other I lived a good
deal at the house, and talked nonsense to
the girls in my way you know, till this
Miss Fanny took it into her head to fancy
herself in love with me, and to suppose I
had told her that I was so with her, though
if I did upon my soul 'twas only by impli∣cation.
I dangled to be sure, and dined
and danced with her; but I meant no∣thing,
and was obliged at last to tell her
mother so, who very plainly signified to
me, one evening after I had passed the
day with them, that it was time to under∣stand
me. Well, I gave her to understand
then, as civilly as I could though, for
faith they were a good sort of a family, that
I had no thoughts of marrying, and the
good gentlewoman waxed wrath about it,
and told me I had done a very unhand∣some
thing in winning her daughter's af∣fections.
I could only lament they were
so easily won, and return them undamaged
by me. Something I said, however, gave
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
Mrs. Obrien offence, and she desired to see
me no more; a prohibition which I of
course did not attempt to disobey; and
some other pretty girl falling in my way,
faith I thought no more of my poor Fanny,
till being one night at an assembly at Dub∣lin,
I saw a great bustle soon after my en∣trance,
and was told that Miss Obrien had
fainted away upon seeing me, and was
gone home extremely ill. 'Twas no fault
of mine you know that the girl was so
simply susceptible: but her brother, a
fierce young sailor, who came a day or
two afterwards from his ship, thought
otherwise, and talking to me rather cava∣lierly,
we agreed that the matter must be
settled in the Phoenix Park by a brace of
pistols. <HI>Un beau jour</HI> we accordingly met
there, and exchanged each a couple of
shot with all possible politeness, in which
it was my fortune to lodge a bullet in the
slesh of his left arm, which was immediately
extracted. I heard there was no danger;
and as he was of course satisfied, I came
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
off to England the next day, having taken
my passage some time before."</P>
<P>"Your folks here at home never heard
of the hazard you ran?"</P>
<P>"No, I believe not. My father is a
little too apt to lecture and preach on such
occasions, and so 'tis as well sunk I be∣lieve;
and since I've been in England faith
I've had no inclination to amuse myself in
the same way, nor indeed any opportunity,
except with this Celestial beauty, and she
don't seem to take to me."</P>
<P>"The greater will be the glory," re∣plied
Musgrave. "I own I should like
of all things, were I thee, to drive out a
solemn, settled, sentimental affection from
such a heart as her's, and jockey thy bro∣ther
Montague."</P>
<P>Here the gentlemen were interrupted
by the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Cran∣field
and Vavasour; after which Musgrave
and Bettenson took leave themselves, hav∣ing
first received a general invitation from
Mrs. Thorold and her daughter; who,
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
though by no means pleased to observe
that Vavasour, entirely occupied by Celes∣tina,
had beheld and heard her with frigid
indifference, was yet much consoled by
being almost certain that she had secured
the heart of the little Cornet. She judged
very right. Musgrave, to whose care the
father of Bettenson had recommended him,
had purposely introduced him to Arabella
Thorold, under the idea of detaching him
from two milleners, to both of whom he
had been making very serious love ever
since his residence at Exeter; and the elder
Mr. Bettenson was so desirous of saving
him from a connection of that kind, which
he was thus likely to form, that he no
sooner heard of his growing partiality to
Miss Thorold, than he besought Captain
Musgrave by every possible means to en∣courage
it, declaring that fortune alone was
no object to him, and that he should consi∣der
himself happy if his son was fixed in
his choice of the daughter of so worthy and
respectable a man as Mr. Thorold.</P>

<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE short remainder of the evening
past very unpleasantly to Celestina while
she continued in company, for Montague,
to whom she could not prevail upon her∣self
to be rude, was yet so dissatisfied, either
from the constraint he observed she wore
towards him, or from her long conference
with Vavasour, that he could not conceal
his concern, and sighed so loud and so
long, as to attract notice and some very
acrimonious speeches from his mother.
Mr. Thorold too, she thought, looked un∣easy,
and Arabella evidently disliked her
more than before; while the Captain's rude
examination of her countenance, from
which she always shrunk, was now more pain∣ful
to her than ever. She got away as soon
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
as possible; but was far, very far from
finding repose in solitude. All that Va∣vasour
had said now returned to torture
her; and instead of finding sleep when she
retired to her pillow, the same uneasy
thoughts and harrassing conjectures which
had long rendered it of difficult acquire∣ment,
had now received such a reinforce∣ment
as made it impossible for her to sleep
at all.</P>
<P>She rose with the dawn of day, hoping
she might in the course of it see Cathcart;
and yet from him she had little to expect
as to her removal, unless he could find for
her some farm house in the neighbourhood
of Jessy, where she might have board and
lodging. But even to this scheme there
were objections: it would be too near the
Thorold's: the young men might still visit
her, and the reports still obtain which Va∣vasour
had repeated to her; because, though
Montague was really, she found, returning
to Oxford in a few days, there would be
other occasions of his being at home. It
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
was also too near Alvestone, which, since
she almost despaired now of seeing again
with pleasure, she wished to escape seeing
even at the distance from which she fre∣quently
beheld it; when the clump of
firs and some of the high grounds in the
park, conspicuous from almost every part
of the country within ten or fifteen miles,
often drew from her heart many a bitter
sigh.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, she saw Cathcart
enter the little lawn before the house and
immediately went down to him. He ap∣proached
her with more than ordinary
cheerfulness; but in answering her ques∣tions
told her he had not heard from Mr.
Willoughby.</P>
<P>"I flattered myself you had," said Ce∣lestina,
sinking again into dejection, "for
I thought, Cathcart, you seemed unusually
cheerful."</P>
<P>"If any thing could make me long so,"
replied he, "when you, my dear Madam,
and my noble friend are divided and un∣easy,
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
it would be the intelligence I have
received about my sister, whose situation,
you know, and my solicitude for her and
her children; was indeed the only one Mr.
Willoughby's goodness would have left
me, if he had himself been as happy as he
deserved to be."</P>
<P>"And what then have you heard," en∣quired
Celestina, "of Mrs. Elphinstone?"</P>
<P>"That her husband, who has been
long wandering about the world, is at
length settled, in a very remote situation
indeed, but one which he happens to like
and which is likely to become profitable.
He is appointed to superintend the fisheries
established by a society of gentlemen in
the western islands of Scotland, and is
already put in possession of a good house
in the isle of Skie. Thither my sister is
about to follow him; but I have prevailed
upon her to send to me her two youngest
children, whom I shall put to nurse in
some farm house where Jessy or I can
visit them every day: the other two are
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
as many as it will be possible for her to
take care of, and when she is settled, I
have engaged to conduct the little ones to
her. She has already received money
from Elphinstone to enable her to set out
well equipped, and waits only to see me
before she takes leave of London, and,
she says, she hopes for ever."</P>
<P>"And when do you go?"</P>
<P>"I propose setting out for London on
Thursday, unless you or Mr. Willoughby
have any commands for me that may de∣tain
me longer."</P>
<P>"Alas! Cathcart," said Celestina, "I
am afraid you will receive no intelligence
of Willoughby by that time: but I can
find, I believe, something for you to do
for me which will rather expedite than de∣tain
you."</P>
<P>Cathcart then assuring her how happy
every opportunity of shewing his gratitude
would make him, Celestina said—"Well
then, my commands are simply these, that
instead of going on horseback you come
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
hither in a post-chaise on Thursday morn∣ing,
and take me with you to see my dear
Jessy, as I cannot go without having that
satisfaction, and afterwards, Cathcart, you
shall take me to London with you,"</P>
<P>Cathcart expressing some surprise at her
resolution, she told him that she would
account for it as they went; that Devon∣shire
was at present very unpleasant to her,
and that she fancied change of place would
relieve her spirits more than all her reason
and her philosophy, "which, to tell you the
truth, Cathcart," said she, "may be accused
of acting a little like Horatio; and I
sometimes am tempted to say to them—
<Q><L>Is then the boasted purpose of your friendship</L>
<L>To tell Calista what a wretch she is?</L>
<L>Alas! what needed that?</L></Q>
But however, I find really, Cathcart, that
I cannot here obey our dear friend in the
points he most insists upon, those of keep∣ing
my cheerfulness and preserving my
health, and I have a mind to try his
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
remedy and ramble a little. Perhaps I
may go to Scotland with your sister. Do
you think she would admit me as a tra∣velling
companion?"</P>
<P>"Admit you, dear Madam," said
Cathcart. "Surely she would be but too
much honoured. But you can never be
serious?"</P>
<P>"It is, however, very likely that I may
become so. At present, my resolution is
to take leave of this family and go with
you to London. You will see Vavasour
to day, and you may tell him so."</P>
<P>They then settled the hour at which the
post-chaise was to be ready for her the
next morning save one. Cathcart returned
to Alvestone; and Celestina to the house,
where she proposed taking the earliest op∣portunity
of acquainting Mr. Thorold with
her determination.</P>
<P>She considered herself rather as Mr.
Thorold's visitor than as the guest of any
other of the family; and wished to have
his approbation for the step she was about
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
to take, without however assigning the
reasons that actuated her to take it. She
had frequently fancied of late that he saw
more than he chose to notice, and that,
though he was too generous to repent the
friendly invitation he had given her, he
was too prudent not to foresee ill conse∣quences
from her long continuing to ac∣cept
it. In the midst of a large family.
to which he was greatly attached, Mr.
Thorold lived much of his time alone.
His study and his parishioners divided the
day, and, except at dinner and for about
an hour afterwards, his wife and children
saw very little of him. Celestina was un∣easy
till she had spoken to him; and there∣fore
when he rose to go for his walk after
dinner, she enquired whether he would
allow her to go part of the way with him,
as she wished to speak a few words to him
alone.</P>
<P>Montague blushed deeply as she thus
addressed herself to his father; who led her
however out of the room, and taking her
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
arm within his in his usual friendly way,
took the way towards the village street,
where he had, he said, some patients to
visit that evening; for he was the physician
as well as the pastor of his people. After
a few minutes of embarrassing silence on
the part of Celestina, she collected courage
enough to tell him, that in consequence
of some intelligence she had learned from
Mr. Vavasour, she had determined to go
to London.</P>
<P>"Not under <HI>his</HI> convoy I hope?" cried
Mr. Thorold, eagerly interrupting her.</P>
<P>"No," answered Celestina, a little
startled by the manner in which he spoke:
"not by any means with him, or under
his care; but with Mr. Cathcart, who is
going on business of his own."</P>
<P>"You know, my dear Miss De Mor∣nay,"
said Mr. Thorold very gravely,
"that my house and my best advice are
equally and always at your service: you
may have reasons for quitting the one and
rejecting the other, into which were I to
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
enquire it would produce for me nothing
but mortification. I will <HI>not</HI> then enquire;
I will only entreat you to consider well,
whither and with whom you go. Mr. Va∣vasour
has, I apprehend, no mother or
sister, and you cannot be ignorant that he
has the character of indulging himself in
liberties, which even in this age of free∣dom
make him rather a marked man."</P>
<P>"My dear Sir," replied Celestina, "I
have not the most distant idea of quitting
your protection for one so little proper as
Mr. Vavasour's must be, though he is the
most intimate friend of Mr. Willoughby.
But my meaning merely is—"</P>
<P>"Come," cried Mr. Thorold, inter∣rupting
her, "I will explain your mean∣ing,
or rather the meaning of Vavasour.
He has been talking to you about my son
Montague. He has represented the im∣propriety
of your listening to such sort of
conversation as I know Montague has
more than once entertained you with. Is
it not so?"</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168"/>
"I own it is," said Celestina in some
confusion.</P>
<P>"I do not blame him," rejoined Mr.
Thorold; "and if his vigilance is the
effect of <HI>friendship,</HI> I commend him. Nor
do I, my dear ward, disapprove of your
wishing to shun the boyish importunity of
Montague. I only entreat you to reflect
well on your removal, and to remember,
that notwithstanding Mr. Vavasour's inti∣mate
connection with Willoughby, I con∣sider
myself as having some claim to your
confidence and as in some degree answer∣able
for your disposal of yourself."</P>
<P>"You are very good, dear Sir, and
deserve I am sure my gratitude as well as
my confidence. You deserve too that I
should speak to you with the utmost sin∣cerity."
She then related to him, all that
Vavasour had said to her of the reports
that had obtained relative to her and Mr.
Montague; and concluded by saying,
that though she highly esteemed his son,
and had the most grateful regard for the
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
whole family, she could not listen to these
reports without concern, because they
might be displeasing to him and injurious
to views he might have for his son, even
putting herself out of the question. "I
think therefore, dear Sir," added she,
"that it will be better for me to put an
end to my visit for this time, and to travel
into the North with a sister of Mr. Cath∣cart's,
who is going thither: change of
scene will relieve my spirits, and wandering
give me perhaps a new relish for the
beauties of Devonshire; where, believe me,
I shall be most happy to return, whenever
I can do it without subjecting my best
friends as well as myself to uneasiness."</P>
<P>"I am vexed," said Mr. Thorold,
"that the romantic temper of Montague
has made this removal necessary in your
idea. He goes very soon to Oxford: in∣deed
in a few days: and afterwards, per∣haps,
you would find my house less objec∣tionable.
As to the gossip of the country,
you are I hope too wise to mind it, and I
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
have long since learned to despise it.
<HI>That,</HI> therefore should not weigh with
me at all. But in return for your charming
sincerity, I will speak very plainly to you.
Montague is a young man of good abi∣lities,
and of an excellent heart; but the
violence of his passions keep me in perpe∣tual
concern least they should deprive me
of all the happiness that I may hope to
derive from such a son: and already I
have twice, with great difficulty, delivered
him from engagements he had made with
young women quite unworthy of him:
engagements which, though he soon saw
the folly and impropriety of them, he
fancied his honour obliged him to keep.
Another—I know not who; one perhaps
not much superior to these, (as I learned by
a friend who keeps a steady eye upon him,)
had succeeded to the imaginary possession
of his affections when he last came home.
I was uneasy at it; but perhaps considered
my own feelings too much and your's too
little, when I saw with pleasure his instant
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
admiration of you. I encouraged it,
because I hoped, that in learning what
true merit was, he would hereafter be less
liable to be misled by the poor semblance
of it, when aided by a pretty face, or a
slender shape: at the same time I thought
I had sufficiently guarded him against any
excess of attachment, by representing to
him your situation and convincing him it
would be not only presumptuous but hope∣less.
I believe, however, from some late
observations I have made, that I have
judged ill; and to save him from maladies
that might be trifling or curable, have ex∣posed
him to the severer misfortune of
feeling a real passion where he can meet
with no return."</P>
<P>Celestina could not with sincerity dis∣claim
what she had so much reason to fear
was true. Affecting, however, to believe
that Mr. Montague would soon lose the
impression when she was no longer present,
and would find many infinitely more wor∣thy
of his affection, who might be proud
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
to receive and at liberty to return it, she
renewed the subject of her going to Lon∣don,
besought Mr. Thorold still to honour
her with his friendship, and promised to
return to him again in the winter if no ob∣jection
should arise to his receiving her.
She heard with gratitude the advice he
gave her about Vavasour.—"Do not,"
said he, "put yourself too much in his
power under the idea of his being the cho∣sen
friend of Willoughby. He is called,
and I believe is, a man of honour, in the
common acceptation of the term; but I
am afraid there is little real honour among
those who are in any respect so very licen∣tious
as Vavasour is said to be in regard to
your sex; the stile in which he lives among
a certain description of women, is not
only the means of degrading all in his
opinion, but hardens the heart while it
corrupts the morals: and with all Vava∣sour's
boasted honour, I dare say he is a
man, who, if he happened to take a
fancy to the mistress of his friend, would
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
steal her affections and her person without
hesitation, and suppose, that by an appeal
to the sword or pistol to vindicate the
wrong he had done, the action, however
unprincipled, would derogate nothing
from his honour."</P>
<P>"Sure, Sir," said Celestina, "Wil∣loughby
would not have so much friendship
for Mr. Vavasour were he such a man?"</P>
<P>"I don't know, my dear," answered
Mr. Thorold, "that Vavasour is such a
man; but you will allow at least that it is
very probable; and as to Willoughby's
friendship, I am afraid that is no criterion of
merit. The college friendships of young
men—But let me not make you too
much out of humour with the world, while
I mean only to put you upon your guard
against the evil with which it too often
teems towards unprotected youth and
loveliness. It grieves my heart to let you
go. But—upon the whole, if you promise
to write to me often—to remain with this
sister of Cathcart's, who is, I conclude, a
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
woman of character, and to take no new
course without informing me; above all,
to keep yourself quite out of the power of
Vavasour, and not to be introduced to
any of his acquaintance by way of staying
with them, unless you are very certain
who they are; I say, on all these condi∣tions
I will not oppose your going, though
it hurts me to consent to it."</P>
<P>Celestina, having thus relieved her mind
by explaining herself to her generous friend,
became better satisfied than she had been
for some time, and found at least an alle∣viation
of the concern that preyed on her
heart, in the idea of change of place. She
parted soon after from Mr. Thorold, whose
business she was fearful of interrupting,
and walked back towards the house, in∣tending
to open her intentions of leaving
them, to the rest of the family, when they
were assembled to their tea.</P>
<P>Montague, however, who had never
lost sight of her, but had followed her and
his father at a distance during their walk,
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
now hastened across the field she was in to
meet her. His eagerly enquiring eyes
were fixed on her face when he came up
to her; but not daring to ask the subject
of her conference with his father, nor able
to turn his thoughts from it, he only said—"Well,
Miss De Mornay, you have
left my father?"</P>
<P>"You see I have," said Celestina,
smiling, "and I have left him well satis∣fied
with the reasons I have given for quit∣ting
his hospitable roof on Thursday."</P>
<P>"Quitting it!" exclaimed Montague,
turning pale—"quitting it! What are
you going to leave us then? and before I
go to Oxford?"</P>
<P>"My good friend," replied she, "you
did not surely suppose that I was to be a
perennial visitor at your father's. I have
now been here almost a month, and you
must certainly allow that to be a very long
visit from a person, who, till within five
weeks, had not the good fortune to be
known to your family at all."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176"/>
"I know not," said Montague, sigh∣ing,
"what I thought, or what I sup∣posed;
but I would to heaven I could for∣get
having ever seen you, as easily as I
am convinced you will lose the remem∣brance
of me."</P>
<P>Celestina, with one of those fascinating
smiles which lent such peculiar charms to
her countenance, now assured him that he
was mistaken: "indeed," said she, "I
shall always remember you all, with plea∣sure
and with gratitude."</P>
<P>"Well," answered he, "I thank you;
and I thank you for not excepting me,
and by putting us all together, shewing
that you have no particular favourite in the
family, but that one is as indifferent as
another. But however, I wish you would
not smile, for I cannot bear it."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried Celestina. "I
am amazed, Mr. Montague, that with
your understanding, you give way so fre∣quently
to such absurd fits of—I hardly
know what to call it—a romantic stile of
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
behaviour, which you seem to think wo∣men
like, whereas I assure you that to me
at least it is the most unpleasant in the
world."</P>
<P>"When did you ever see me in this ro∣mantic
stile, as you are pleased to term it,
with any woman but yourself?"</P>
<P>"I never did, because I happen not to
have seen you with any other women than
those of your own family: but you know
that yout mother, your sister and your
brother, nay, even your father, all have
repeatedly said it was your way with every

<P>"They are mistaken however; and I
own <HI>I</HI> have often mistaken a transient de∣gree
of liking for love, which I never felt—no
never—till I saw you!</P>
<Q><L>For several virtues</L>
<L>Have I liked several women; never any</L>
<L>With so full soul, but some defect in her</L>
<L>Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed</L>

<L>So perfect and so peerless, were created</L>
<L>Of every creature's best.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178"/>
"There now," said Celestina, "that
is exactly what I complain of: there is no
rational conversation with you, capable as
you are of adorning it; but, as Arabella
very truly says, you do nothing but make
speeches out of Otway or Shakspeare."</P>
<P>"Arabella did not say I made speeches,
but that I made love; and I make love
because I feel it—feel it to an excess which
is dreadful, because I know, and have
known from the beginning, that it is
hopeless! But as this hurts nobody but
myself, I don't see why it should displease
you, or why you should affect to mis∣understand,
or attempt to laugh off a
passion, which, whatever may be its effect
on me, can never disturb your tranquillity
or that of your fortunate lover."</P>
<P>Celestina finding him thus serious,
thought it would be better, and indeed
more generous, not to pretend ignorance
of his meaning, and to reason with rather
than rally him; she therefore dropped the
gayer tone with which she began the con∣versation,
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
and said gravely—"Mr. Mon∣tague,
I will not affect then to misunder∣stand
you. I am undoubtedly honoured
by your partiality, and very much con∣cerned
if it is the source of present pain to
you. Let it become rather a source of
pleasure to us both, by reducing it to that
generous and disinterested friendship which
I may return with satisfaction, and for
those warmer sentiments, which you now
suppose are entirely diverted from any
other object, seek one who can deserve
and return them, and spare me, I beseech
you, the pain of believing, even for a
moment, that I have brought solicitude
and suffering into any part of a family to
which I am so much obliged. I need not
tell you my situation: you know it is a
very comfortless and a very uncertain one:
perhaps I may never see Mr. Willoughby
again; or if I do, perhaps I may see him
the husband of another. But in either
case my attachment to him is unalterable;
and were I sure to-morrow that we are di∣vided
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
never again to meet, I should only
think of submitting in such a way as would
least wound him, to a blow, which I am
sure he will not voluntarily give me, but
never of running the hazard of making
unhappy some equally worthy man, by
giving to importunity what I can never
give to love—for my heart has been Wil∣loughby's
ever since I knew I had one,
and it will be his, till I remember it no
longer."</P>
<P>Montague gave no other answer to this
than a deep sigh; and Celestina pausing a
moment to recover herself from the emo∣tion
her words had occasioned, went on—"You
love quotations, and undoubtedly
recollect, though perhaps from an author
I ought not to quote, these words: <HI>Il
n'y a point d'bomme pour celle qui aime;
son amant est plus, tous les autres sont
moins.</HI>"</P>
<P>Montague now impatiently interrupted
her—"You need not," said he, "thus
refine on the cruelty with which you tell
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
me that you can never throw away a
thought on me. I knew it before; and in
the wildest paroxysms of that passion which
I glory in feeling and in cherishing, I
never dared flatter myself that you would.
Yet—perhaps even this fortunate Wil∣loughby
himself—this happy man, who
may neglect you, leave you for another,
and yet still be beloved—is not more ca∣pable
of an ardent, a sincere affection, than
I am. <HI>If</HI> he leaves you for ever—good
God!—Even if he entirely deserts you,
you will still love him—Even then no
other would have any hope."</P>
<P>"None," said Celestina, "for then I
will never marry. But, my good friend,
this is an uneasy subject to us both; let us
then never resume it. Allow me to offer
you my friendship and my esteem, and to
assure you that this sudden partiality, which
believe me you will soon and easily con∣quer,
is the only subject on which I cannot
listen to you with pleasure."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182"/>
They were now so immediately before
the parlour windows, that Montague, who
saw the family assembled there at tea,
dared not give way to what he felt; but
asked her, in a lower voice, when she
went. She told him the day after the
morrow. Again he sighed; and when
they got into the hall, turned towards his
own little study, which was on the same
floor, while Celestina went to join the
party in the parlour; where she found Mr.
Bettenson, who she understood was now
the professed lover of Miss Thorold; and
so entirely did he now occupy the atten∣tion
both of her and her mother, that they
hardly noticed the entrance of Celestina.
She took, however, the earliest opportunity
of a pause in their conversation, to signify
her design of going on the following Thurs∣day.</P>
<P>Miss Thorold contented herself with
coldly saying she was sorry to lose her so
soon; and her mother, even less civil, as
her husband was not by, said—"And
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
pray, Miss De Mornay, where are you
going?"</P>
<P>"To London, Madam."</P>
<P>"To London. Bless me! and pray who
are you going to there?"</P>
<P>"To a Mrs. Elphinstone, I believe,
Ma'am."</P>
<P>"You believe! and pray when do you
go?"</P>
<P>"On Thursday, Madam."</P>
<P>"And alone?"</P>
<P>"No, Madam."</P>
<P>"Not alone? then who do you go with?"</P>
<P>"With Mr. Cathcart, Madam."</P>
<P>"Oh! with Mr. Cathcart. And pray,
how do you go? In the stage?"</P>
<P>"No, Madam," replied Celestina,
blushing at the indelicacy with which all
these questions were asked before a stranger.</P>
<P>"How then pray?"</P>
<P>"In post chaises, Madam."</P>
<P>"Humph! Post chaises are expensive."
Here she stopped; being unable to find
any other questions, or rather not daring
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
to ask any more, as her husband and eldest
son that moment came in with Captain
Musgrave. Celestina however interpreted
the look she put on, as saying, "no mat∣ter
how you go, so long as you do go,"
and again she congratulated herself on the
resolution she had taken.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>CELESTINA, finding that Montague
Thorold did not join the party, constrained
herself to stay with them, least it should be
imagined they were together. Captain
Thorold, as if he took advantage of his
brother's absence, sat down by her, and be∣gan
in a half whisper to make her some of
those speeches, between a sneer and a compli∣ment,
which always confused and distressed
her. Soon after tea, however, Montague came
in, and then, the evening being rainy,
cards were proposed, to which his mother
desired him to sit down; while Celestina,
saying she had a few preparations to make
for her journey which she might as well
begin in time, went away, nobody asking
her to take a seat at the card table.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186"/>
She was no sooner gone, than Mrs. Tho∣rold,
addressing her eldest son, said—"So,
Edmund, we are to lose your father's visitor
at last, my dear."</P>
<P>"Are we?" said he carelessly. "What
is her <HI>intended</HI> come back?"</P>
<P>"Oh no," replied his mother, "the
young lady is going to London it seems."</P>
<P>"Lord, Ma'am," cried Bettenson,
"I'll tell you what Musgrave and I heard
t'other day; did'nt we Muzzy?"</P>
<P>"Faith I don't know whether we did or
no, Jacky Boy, till you tell me what it was
we heard."</P>
<P>"Why we heard—Lord why 'twas that
night we drank tea and supped, you know,
with that there family of the Killigrews—we
heard that Mr. Montague Thorold was a
going to be married to this Miss De Mor∣ning,
and that Mr. What d'ye call him—he
that was to have had her, had given Mr.
Montague a living to take her off his
hands."</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187"/>
Either the purport of this speech, or the
manner in which it was delivered, threw
Captain Thorold and his friend Musgrave
into bursts of laughter, which they very
freely indulged; but poor Montague turned
pale, and trembled with vexation; while
Mrs. Thorold, pursing her mouth and
drawing herself up, said—"Pray, Mr.
Bettenson, <HI>where</HI> did you say you heard
this story? Pray, Edmund, what do you
laugh at? I say—Mr. Bettenson, pray was
it at Mr. Killigrew's you heard this absurd
story?"</P>
<P>"Lord yes, Ma'am, and upon my soul
I've heard it elsewhere. Why, Musgrave,
don't you remember?—why half the people
at Exeter I'm sure have talked to me about
it."</P>
<P>"I'm very sorry for it," rejoined the
old lady. "People give their tongues
strange liberties methinks. My son I can
assure them will never, at least with mine
and his father's consent, form any such
connection. What! with a foreigner! an
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
alien as one may say! brought up upon
charity, and I dare say not very honourably
born, or how did Mrs. Willoughby get
her so easily from her own country. People
of fashion don't part with their children to
strangers. For my part, I would be very
civil to a young woman in distress, as
'twas Mr. Thorold's whim to have her
here for a little time, but I am very sorry
it has given rise to any such report, which
I beg the favour of you gentlemen to con∣tradict.
A living indeed! it is very likely
that Montague Thorold should accept of
a living with such an incumbrance, or on
any such conditions."</P>
<P>"But Madam," cried Captain Thorold
as he dealt his cards, "what think you if
poor Montague avows his penchant for
the lady, and talks of dying without her
instead of getting a living with her?"</P>
<P>"Think," replied his mother, redden∣ing
with anger—"why think that he is a
fool, and that you are very little better for
encouraging a silly boy in such nonsense."</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189"/>
"Nay, Madam," cried the Captain, "I
am sure I don't encourage him. I was
only pitying him, as one naturally does all
gentle youths who are crost in love."</P>
<P>Arabella, who knew that her mother
sometimes suddenly threw off her every
day character to appear in one far less amia∣ble,
when unchecked by Mr. Thorold,
now feared that she might give way to one
of these fits of ill humour and exhibit a
scene before Mr. Musgrave and Mr. Bet∣tenson
which might give them no very fa∣vourable
idea of the family temper; she
therefore gave her brother Edmund a hint
to forbear pushing the conversation any far∣ther.
He desisted; the game went in fa∣vour
of Mrs. Thorold; and in the pleasure
of winning five shillings, she forgot for
that time the displeasure she had conceived
against her youngest son.</P>
<P>Celestina was in the mean time pre∣paring
for her journey. She had nothing
now but her cloaths to pack up; for her
books and her drawing cases were at Al∣vestone,
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
where Cathcart besought her to
let them remain a little longer, promising
that if events were finally determined other∣wise
than he was still willing to hope, he
would take them all from thence and send
them to her whithersoever she might de∣sire.
She wished most earnestly the next
day over: for she had now learned to dread
more than before some extravagance on the
part of Montague Thorold, for whom,
notwithstanding the trouble she had re∣ceived
from his continual persecutions,
she could not altogether withhold her pity
and her esteem. In his figure he resem∣bled
his father, whom she had so much
reason to regard with grateful affection;
and his faults were merely those of youth
and a vivid imagination. Whether his
partiality to her was of a permanent or
transitory nature, it was pretty certain that
it now gave him pain, of which Celestina
could not consider herself as the cause with∣out
desiring to alleviate or rather to end it.
At supper, however, she learned, with
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
great satisfaction, that Mr. Thorold and his
two sons were engaged out for the whole of
the next day, and were to leave home
early in the morning. She fancied, from
several remarks she made in the course of
the evening, that this was purposely con∣trived:
and the eyes of Montague, though
he dared not otherwise speak, told her
how cruelly he suffered from an arrange∣ment
which would deprive him of almost
all the opportunities of speaking to her
which her short stay might yet afford him.
Though he saw that his mother remarked
all his looks, and was restrained only by
the fear of offending his father from
openly avowing the anger she had con∣ceived,
he could not forbear watching
every turn of Celestina's countenance; and,
when he bade her good night at the door,
sighing deeply and saying in a low whis∣per—"At
what time do you go on Thurs∣day?"</P>
<P>"Early I hope," replied she; and to
avoid all farther questions hastened away.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
The next day passed quietly enough:
for Mrs. Thorold, sure of being delivered
from a visitor who had never been agree∣able
and was now uneasy to her, thought
it as well to be tolerably civil to her; and
Arabella, who thought very little about
any thing at present but securing her con∣quest
over the heart of Mr. Bettenson, was
hardly conscious that she was with them.</P>
<P>Late in the evening the gentlemen re∣turned;
but Celestina had left the parlour
before their arrival, on pretence of going
early to bed that she might be ready the
next day for Mr. Cathcart, whom she had
appointed to meet her in a post chaise at
six o'clock. She took leave of Mrs. Tho∣rold
and her daughter therefore this even∣ing,
who received her thanks and adieus
with great formality and no kindness.
Very willingly would she have escaped
bidding farewel to Montague Thorold the
next morning, but she feared it would be
impossible: Mr. Thorold had told her he
should himself put her into the chaise;
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
and he always rose so early, that this, she
knew, would not put him out of his way.</P>
<P>As soon as her window was opened in
the morning, which was almost as soon as
it was light, she saw Montague Thorold
standing under it. He kissed his hand to
her when he perceived her, and looked so
dejected that she could not see him without
concern. She was very soon dressed, and
went down into the parlour, where he no
sooner saw her than he came to her.—"You
are ready even before the time, so
impatient are you to leave us," said he in
a mournful voice. "Ah! Miss De Mor∣nay!
this house then will never again be
blest with your presence!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir, I hope to see it very fre∣quently
again, and shall always be happy
to hear of the health and welfare of it's in∣habitants.
But is your father in his study?
I must see him before I go."</P>
<P>"Do not, Celestina," said Montague
very gravely—"do not so industriously try
to deprive me of this last poor moment.
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
Yet a little—and my unfortunate, my de∣spised
attachment will trouble you no more."</P>
<P>"You are mistaken, Mr. Montague,"
replied Celestina. "Any circumstance
that <HI>you</HI> have occasion to deem unfortu∣nate
will trouble <HI>me</HI> long, wherever and
whatever I may be: pray therefore, for
my sake as well as for your own, exert
your excellent understanding, and con∣quer
this unlucky partiality towards a per∣son,
who, whatever may be her sense of
your worth, or her gratitude for your good
opinion, can never return it otherwise than
by esteem and good wishes."</P>
<P>"I had rather you would hate, detest,
and drive me from you," cried he, starting
up and going to the window: "'twould
be less cruel than this gentle reason, which
I know to be just, but which I cannot
obey: and yet indeed, Celestina, I have
no hope: I am not quite frantic enough
to suppose there can be any for me. All
I ask is to be permitted to be miserable,
and that, after all, you cannot prevent.
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
Yes, there is yet another favour I would so∣licit,
though I know—I know you will not
grant it."</P>
<P>"Any thing I can do without impro∣priety,"
replied Celestina, "I certainly will
do."</P>
<P>"I do not know," said he, in a depressed
and solemn voice, "what <HI>you</HI> may call
propriety or impropriety; but the favour I
would solicit is to be allowed to write to
you.—Nay don't interrupt me with a re∣fusal
before you hear me—to be allowed
to write to you, so long as I confine my
letters to literary subjects only, and that
once or twice a year you would acknow∣ledge
the receipt of my letters."</P>
<P>"My dear Sir," cried she, smiling,
"you would be weary of this project long
before the first half year had elapsed.
Had you never talked to me of I know not
what particular regard, there might have
been no impropriety in this, and I am
sure the pleasure and advantage would have
been wholly mine; but after the extrava∣gantly
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
gallant things you have said, how
can I—"</P>
<P>"If I infringe the articles of our agree∣ment,"
said he, "then send my letters
back."</P>
<P>"But tell me," cried Celestina, inter∣rupting
him in her turn, "tell me what
good can this possibly do you?"</P>
<P>"Good!" replied he: "you are not
yourself insensible of a tender attachment
to Willoughby, and yet ask what <HI>good</HI> it
can do to be admitted to write to a beloved
object. Good! why it will be the softener,
the sweetener of my existence! While I am
writing to you, I shall forget that I am
never to see you—I shall forget every thing
but the pleasure of knowing that you will
read what I am writing, that your hands
will unfold my letter, your eyes pass over
the traces of my pen; that sometimes I
may amuse or interest you, and at others,
perhaps, raise in your bosom a compassion∣ate
sigh for my silent, my unhappy love!
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
Besides, I shall by that means always know
where you are.</P>
<Q><L>Soffti che in traccia almeno</L>

<L>Sempre m'avrai vicino.</L>
<L>E tu!—che sai se mai</L>
<L>Ti sovverai di me!<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Metastasio.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Celestina had no time to answer this
otherwise than by saying, that if he had
sagacity enough to find out where she was
he possessed more than she did, who could
not even guess where she might be. He
answered that he could always know of
Cathcart; and before she could urge the
many objections she saw to his request,
the chaise, with Cathcart in it, drove up
to the door, and at the same moment Mr.
Thorold came to them. He appeared sin∣cerely
concerned that she was going from
him; desired her again to write to him;
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
and while he was hastening breakfast,
which he insisted upon her taking before
she went, Vavasour rode into the court
yard, and giving his horse to his servant,
came into the room also.</P>
<P>Celestina, who knew that Cathcart had
informed him of her resolution to go, had
felt some surprise that he had not called
upon her the day before to express his ap∣probation,
and enquire how she intended
to dispose of herself: but he was so volatile
and inconsiderate, that she thought it not
impossible but that he might have forgot∣ten
on Wednesday what he so vehemently
urged on Monday; and she now rather
wished he had, as she saw Mr. Thorold
was very little pleased either with his pre∣sent
visit, or the manner in which he ad∣dressed
her, without taking either of him or
his son quite so much notice as the laws of
civility required.</P>
<P>Celestina had frequently remarked the
extreme inattention and disregard, which,
as Vavasour felt, he never chose to take
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
the trouble of concealing, for the opinions
of those to whom he was indifferent; and
he was indifferent to three fifths of the
world, and not very solicitous about the
rest, unless for a few, a very few friends,
whom he loved. He disliked the Tho∣rolds,
without knowing or enquiring of
himself why he disliked them; and eager
and solicitous only about Celestina, he
hardly gave her time to address herself to
them, or returned their invitation to par∣take
of their breakfast by the usual speech.
A party who seemed so little pleased with
each other, Celestina thought could not
too soon separate: she therefore hastily
drank her tea, and telling Cathcart she
was ready, she gave the elder Mr. Thorold
her hand, and thanked him, not without
emotion, for all the kindness he had shewn
her: she then wished Montague Thorold
health and happiness, desired him to offer
her compliments and acknowledgments to
his mother, sister, and brother, and then
Mr. Thorold leading her, and Montague
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
walking silently on her left hand, she went
out and stepped into the chaise.</P>
<P>Cathcart followed her, and Vavasour
went round to speak to her at the opposite
side. "You did not wish me good mor∣row,"
said he, "and therefore I suppose
you foresee that I intend going with you
part of the way."</P>
<P>Celestina had no time to answer; for
Mr. Thorold offering his hand once more
to bid her adieu, she gave it him, saying—"Adieu!
dear Sir; a thousand and a
thousand thanks and good wishes." Mon∣tague,
who stood by his father, at that mo∣ment
caught her eye, and there was on
his countenance an expression of sorrow
which affected her so much, that under
the sudden impulse of concern and pity
she held out to him the hand his father let
go.—"Farewel, Mr. Montague," said
she. He seized it eagerly, and held it as
if he would never part from it more:
but Cathcart at that moment bowing to the
gentlemen and bidding the postillion drive
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
on, he was compelled to release it, though
it was with a sigh as if his heart was half
broken; and when the chaise drove off,
instead of following it with his eyes, he
turned away and went into his own room,
unable either to see Celestina go or Vava∣sour
following her.</P>
<P>The concern she felt for him kept her
silent the greatest part of the way to the
cottage near old Winnington's, where
Jessy was to meet them. Cathcart, who
was unhappy at the necessity of parting
from his wife, was not disposed to inter∣rupt
her; and though Vavasour now and
then rode up to the door of the chaise and
talked, she was not in spirits to answer
the gay nothings with which he addressed
her. The meeting with Jessy was more in
unison with her feelings. Jessy threw her∣self
into the arms of her benefactress, from
whom she had been so long divided, and
who she now saw only for a moment before
they were to be separated for a yet longer
time. Neither of them could say much,
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
for their hearts were full: but had they
been disposed for conversation, Vavasour,
who felt only pleasure in having got Ce∣lestina
away from the Thorolds, was very
little inclined to give them an opportunity:
but in his rattling way rallied Jessy, and
then Celestina, whom he teazed about
Montague Thorold and his father, one of
whom he called her pedant and the other
her priest, till she was half angry. Cath∣cart
at length, however, prevailed upon
him to leave the friends alone; and as
they walked together before the door of
the cottage, he enquired whether he had
any commands in London. "Oh none,
I thank you," replied Vavasour, "for I
shall be there myself almost as soon as you.
Pray where does Miss De Mornay intend
to lodge?"</P>
<P>Cathcart declared himself entirely ig∣norant;
and then, for the first time, from
some expression or look of Vavasour's, he
suddenly entertained a notion that there
was something more than friendly solici∣tude
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
for Willoughby's betrothed wife in
the eager and assiduous attentions of Va∣vasour;
and he determined from that time
to remark more narrowly his behaviour to
her.</P>
<P>"You do not intend to set out for Lon∣don
to-day, Sir?" enquired Cathcart.</P>
<P>"Yes I do," answered Vavasour: "that
is, I just ride back and make my bow to
those honest humdrum Cranfields, and
then I am off for Oakhampton, where I've
told them I have business, and from thence
I shall take four horses, and so come up
with you, my good fellow, and your fair
<HI>compagnon du voyage,</HI> before you reach Ho∣niton."</P>
<P>"And does Miss De Mornay know of
your intentions, Sir?"</P>
<P>"No; for I know what scalping savages
all the people about here are; and though
there can be nothing you know in my
attending her on behalf of Willoughby,
yet on her account one would not set the
clacks of the old cats within twenty miles
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
round at work about it, and so I have
made up a story of having a lawyer to meet
about the affairs of my deceased aunt, who,
luckily for the honour of my veracity, had
a farm or two near Oakhampton, which
are now mine; and I intend the Cranfields,
good matter of fact souls, shall fancy me
carefully looking after my property and set∣tling
repairs and renewals with Mr. Palmer
the attorney."</P>
<P>"You intend, no doubt, to tell Miss
De Mornay of it, however, Sir?"</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, now I see her safely out of
the hands of her confessor, or else perhaps
he would have put it into her head that I
am not a fit escort for her; though I think,
Cathcart, thou art so grave and sage that
thou'lt make as proper a third to our party
as his reverence himself. Come never look
so calamitous, but go and take leave of thy
weeping wife, and let me and Celestina
have a little conversation."</P>
<P>Cathcart then went into the house, and
Celestina presently afterwards came to Va∣vasour,
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
who continued walking before it.
"Has Cathcart told you my plan?" said
he, before she could speak. "I intend to
go to London with you from Honiton,
where I shall be almost as soon as you."</P>
<P>Celestina now recollected all Mr. Tho∣rold
had said to her; but the great friend∣ship
which had for so many years subsisted
between Vavasour and Willoughby, and
the undesigning openness of Vavasour's cha∣racter,
put all the suspicions he had raised
to flight, even when this scheme seemed
most strongly to corroborate those suspi∣cions.
"I had much rather you would
not join us," said Celestina, "because,
though I should certainly be glad of your
company as well as Mr. Cathcart, yet per∣haps
a thousand ill natured things may be
said about it."</P>
<P>She was proceeding, when Vavasour in∣terrupted
her. "Yes, that's just the poli∣tics
you have learned at the Thorolds.
What does it signify to you what any body
says or thinks but Willoughby, and you
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
know that he would put you himself into
my protection on every occasion where he
could not protect you himself. Come, come,
Celestina, acknowledge that your old Men∣tor
has been warning you against having
any acquaintance with such sad young rakes
as Vavasour."</P>
<P>"If you think so," replied Celestina,
"you undoubtedly know that he has rea∣son
for his precaution; and as for his calling
you what I always fancied you rather piqued
yourself upon being, I don't see why my
Mentor, as you term him, should give you
offence by that."</P>
<P>"Rake as I am, however," answered
he, "curse me if I would do a dishonour∣able
thing towards George. No, by hea∣ven,
not if I were dying for love of you."</P>
<P>"I believe you indeed," said Celestina;
"and such perfect confidence I have in
your honour, that I should trust myself with
you as with a brother."</P>
<P>"And never, you dear candid angel,"
interrupted he, "never shall you repent
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
that confidence. But I tell you very plainly,
that though I am upon honour with Wil∣loughby
I am not so with those Thorolds,
and can allow nobody else to usurp that fa∣vour,
which perhaps I might have taken it
into my head to dispute even with my friend
George himself if he had not made out a
very early and almost an hereditary claim
to you: as it is, however, I have no pre∣tensions
for myself, but I am confoundedly
jealous for him; and now I have got you
out of the way of that prating, piping,
poetical pedant—that Montague Thorold,
I shall be quite easy when I see you situated
where you are not very likely to meet with
him again: so you won't oppose my
meeting you on the road; and, till then,
my sweet friend, adieu!" He then, with∣out
waiting for an answer, ran to his horse,
which his servant was leading about, and
mounting it, was out of sight in an instant.
Cathcart and Jessy then came towards Ce∣lestina;
and the latter hanging on her neck,
could hardly prevail on herself to bid her
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
farewel; while Celestina, melting into
tears, kissed her, and willing to shorten a
scene so uselessly painful, stepped into the
chaise, where Cathcart, having taken again
a tender leave of his wife, immediately fol∣lowed
her, and they took the road that led
across the commons to the turnpike.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<P>THE road they were travelling led
along the side of Alvestone Park for near a
mile and a half. Celestina had never
passed it before, but on the day when Mr.
Thorold had taken her to his house; and
then she had been so lost in mournful con∣templations
as hardly to notice whither she
went. Now, however, the profound si∣lence
she had fallen into on parting from
Jessy, was suddenly broken by an excla∣mation;
for on looking up, she saw one
of the park gates, and cried—"Alvestone!
is it not?—oh! yes, I see it is: there is the
house!" Cathcart answered that it was;
and after another short silence, Celestina
said—"To any body but you, Cathcart,
I should be afraid of betraying my weak∣ness;
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
but you are now in place of a bro∣ther
to me, and knowing my situation, will
indulge my regret: I have a strange fancy
to get out and go up to that tuft of beech
trees on the brow of the hill. It is not far.
I shall not be gone long. Will you wait
for me?"</P>
<P>"My time is your's," replied he. "But
will you allow me to observe that it is per∣haps
wiser to endeavour to conquer this
useless regret than to indulge it?"</P>
<P>"I know it would be wiser," answered
Celestina: "but alas! we are not always
able to be wise. I think I shall be easier
when I have once more taken, of that spot
where I have often been so happy—a last
adieu!"</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid it should be the last,"
cried Cathcart, as he assisted her to leave
the chaise. "I foresee many, many happy
days for you yet, when you will be mistress
of that house."</P>
<P>"Ah! dear Cathcart," returned Celes∣tina,
half smiling through the tears that
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
filled her eyes, "how happy a convert
shall I be to the doctrine of second sight if
your prophecy should ever be fulfilled.
But no; I feel too certainly that this is the
last time I shall ever behold this dear place."</P>
<P>She then went into the park over the
stepping stile, and walking about half a
quarter of a mile, reached the group of
beech trees which shaded a high knoll in
the park; from whence the house, half
concealed by intervening wood, appeared
to great advantage. It was now the be∣ginning
of May, and the trees under which
she stood were just coming into leaf, while
others scattered over the park were many
of them of the most vivid green, contrasted
by the darker shade of fir and cypress min∣gled
among them. One of the trees of
this clump was marked by Willoughby
with her name, his own, and his sister's,
and the date. It was five years since; and
the bark had grown rough and knotted
round the scars, but the letters still re∣mained.
It was to re-visit this well known
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
memorial that Celestina had been anxious;
and now she could hardly bear the thoughts
of leaving it. She recollected every trifling
circumstance that happened when Wil∣loughby
cut those letters: the cloaths he
wore, and his very look, were again pre∣sent
to her; while in the breeze that
sighed among the trees she fancied she
heard the sound of his voice, and that he
pronounced the name of Celestina. In
this state of mind she had almost forgotten
that Cathcart waited for her; till a herd
of deer ran bounding by her, and looking
up, she saw following them in mimic race,
several horses which grazed in the park.
There was among them a favourite little
mare, which Willoughby had been fond of
from a boy: it had always carried him to
Eton, and been the companion of all his
boyish sports; and when it became old,
had been turned into the park in summer
and carefully sheltered in winter. While
Mrs. Willoughby lived, it had been ac∣customed
to be fed with bread once or
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
twice a day from her hand, from her daugh∣ter's,
or Celestina's; and since her death
the old servants in the house, with whom
it was a sort of cotemporary, had accus∣tomed
it to the same indulgence; to which
it had become so habituated, that on sight
of any of the family it went towards them
to be fed. This creature therefore no
sooner saw Celestina's cloaths fluttering
among the trees, than it left it's compa∣nions,
and came neighing towards her.</P>
<P>Celestina fancied the animal remembered
her. She caressed it fondly, and with tears
in her eyes, and a deep sigh, cried—"Ah!
Fanchette, you recollect then your old
friend, when perhaps your still beloved
master is trying to forget her, and may al∣ready
have succeeded but too well." She
found herself too much affected with this
idea, and turning her swimming eyes to∣wards
the house, the contrast between
what she now was, and what, hardly a
month since, she expected to be—the fear∣ful
apprehension that Willoughby had sud∣denly
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
become a convert to avarice and
ambition, and that Miss Fitz-Hayman,
who had the power to gratify both those
passions, would soon possess the place
where she had fondly hoped to constitute
the happiness of <HI>his</HI> life whose happiness
was dearer to her than her own—all
crouded with cruel force on her mind; and
feeling her sensations become more and
more painful, she tore herself from the
spot which had so forcibly presented them,
Fanchette still following, and importuning
her to be fed. She walked slowly towards
the park gate, and saw Cathcart, who be∣gan
to be uneasy at her stay, coming to
meet her. He understood the nature of
her sensations too well to make any en∣quiries;
but offering her his arm, in silence
led her towards the chaise. Before she
ascended the steps of the stile, she turned
once more to look at the horse; kissed the
sensible animal as it licked her hands; and
pronouncing a half stifled and tremulous
"adieu Fanchette!" she got as hastily as
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
she could into the chaise, and desired
Cathcart to order the postillion on quickly.
"Since I must go," said she, "I would
be soon out of sight of this place, for I
find I cannot bear it."</P>
<P>"I feared indeed," replied Cathcart,
"it would too much affect you."</P>
<P>Both then returned to their former silence;
while Celestina, as her thoughts went back
to past pleasures, and as her heart felt all
the bitterness of disappointed hope, in∣dulged
herself without restraint in the sad
luxury of sorrow. She no longer saw the
objects she passed, or thought of whither
she was going: but Alvestone was still
present to her eyes, and she saw Willoughby
wandering among it's shades as if looking
for lost happiness, and returning discon∣tented
to his house; whence the sullen
magnificence and arrogant superiority of
his haughty heiress had driven all domestic
comfort. She heard him sigh forth too late
his regret, and lament that for advantages
he could not enjoy, he had relinquished the
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
competence he might have possessed, with
the tender attachment and grateful affection
of his Celestina. Tears fell slowly down
her cheeks as these distressing images pre∣sented
themselves, and insensibly the tender
adieu she had taken of the place, the ten∣der
wishes she had formed for the lamented
friend and lover to whom it belonged, ar∣ranged
themselves into verse, and produced
the following</P>
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>Farewel ye lawns! by fond remembrance blest,</L>
<L>As witnesses of gay unclouded hours,</L>
<L>Where, to maternal friendship's bosom prest,</L>

<L>Rocks, whence with shadowy grace rude Nature lours</L>
<L>O'er glens and haunted streams!—along adieu!</L>

<L>Deluded fancy heard in every grove,</L>

</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="215" REF="217"/>
This disposition of mind, mournful as
it was, afforded Celestina so much me∣lancholy
indulgence, that it was very re∣luctantly
she was roused from it by their
reaching Honiton; where she was glad to
find Vavasour not yet arrived: for though
she was sensible of the friendly interest he
took in whatever related to her, and im∣puted
it to no other motive than regard
for Willoughby, and pity for her own situ∣ation,
there was an impetuosity in his
manner, and a freedom in his discourse,
which, though it did not offend her because
she knew it was his usual way with every
body, was yet often oppressive to her, and
since Mr. Thorold's caution, had become
more so than before. She observed too,
that Cathcart was not pleased at his purpose
of accompanying them to London, and
had expressed more than once, in the little
conversation they had together during their
journey, his hope, that she would find his
sister, Mrs. Elphinstone, such a companion
as might engage her to continue with her.—
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
Celestina, who was, perhaps, a little too
fastidious in the choice of her company,
from having in her early years had her
taste set very high by Mrs. Willoughby,
was become generally indifferent now, from
the little expectation she formed of being
gratified, and though her overcharged
heart languished for the soothing pleasure
of unburthening itself to such a friend as the
simple and sensible Jessy, she knew it was
very improbable that any one whom she
might meet should replace her. She an∣swered
Cathcart, however, that she doubted
not Mrs. Elphinstone's merit, since she was
his sister, and was greatly prejudiced in her
favour by Jessy's account of her. "But,
my dear Sir," said she, "it is I who have
the greatest reason to doubt of my recep∣tion,
and I have thought since, the plan
we hastily formed a very wild one. Mrs.
Elphinstone, occupied by her family, may
have as little occasion for a companion as
taste for an intruder into her domestic cir∣cle;
and she may perhaps, on your recom∣mendation,
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
accept, what her own inclina∣tion
may be averse to receive. Besides she
has a husband, of whom I know nothing,
and to whom the presence of a stranger,
when he expects only his wife and family,
may be disagreeable. I own I have thought
of a journey into the North with more plea∣sure
than any thing else can now give me,
for it is the only part of this island I have
not seen something of, in those summer
excursions which my dear Mrs. Willoughby
was fond of making. But with whatever
satisfaction my fancy has dwelt upon it, I
ought not to think of it farther, at least till
I have seen your sister."</P>
<P>Cathcart repeated again and again his
assurances of the happiness her company
would bestow on his sister, and continued
to lay plans for the accommodation of their
journey: while Celestina could not but
think with internal anguish on her very
forlorn situation, compelled to solicit the
friendship and protection of strangers, or
remain alone, unfriended and unprotected.
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
She blest, however, again the fortunate
chance that had brought her acquainted
with Jessy and Cathcart, without whom her
condition would be yet more desolate; and
for once saw evidently the lasting good that
had been produced by a transient evil, the
troublesome impertinence of Mr. Jedwyn.</P>
<P>As they arrived at Honiton sooner than
they expected, Celestina proposed going
on as far as Axminster, nine miles farther,
before they dined. To this Cathcart con∣sented;
hesitating however a moment whe∣ther
they ought not to wait for Vavasour.
Celestina seemed averse to it, and said if
there was any rudeness in their going on
without him, she would herself be answera∣ble
for it.</P>
<P>They proceeded therefore to Axmin∣ster,
and were just set down to their dinner,
when Vavasour, at the expence of almost
killing the four horses which drew him, ar∣rived.</P>
<P>His volatile humour never forsook him,
and he seemed now unusually disposed to
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
indulge it. He gave the most ludicrous
account of the manner in which he had
misled the curiosity of Mrs. Cranfield, by
setting out very gravely for Oakhampton;
and then cried—"Oh! and I tell you
who I met as I rode back to Cranfield's;
your languishing lover, Montague Tho∣rold,
looking, poor dog! so distanced and
so dismal: he was composing, I fancy, an
elegy on your departure, for I rode almost
against him in the cross lane that leads
from old Thorold's grounds towards Cran∣field
Hall, and he had a paper in his hand,
on which he was so intent that he did not
see me, till I awakened him with a ho hoop!
ho hoop! as if I had been in at the death.
He started, and I was afraid, as I might
have spoiled a thought, that he would feel
some poetical indignation; but instead of
that, he popped the paper into his bosom,
as if he feared I should have seized it;
and then, with as much humility as if I
had been the head of his college, he
pulled off his hat, and professing himself
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
glad to see me, enquired where I had left
you: I told him on your way to London,
and that I was going back to Cranfield's;
and we parted with the utmost politeness."</P>
<P>Celestina, who had really a friendship
for Montague Thorold, could not hear of
his anxious solicitude for her, without a
mingled sentiment of regard and concern,
which, as her face expressed every emotion
of her heart, was immediately perceived by
the quick and penetrating eyes of Vavasour.
He did not spare her; but rallied her with
more success than politeness on the influ∣ence
this college lad, for so he chose to
term him, had obtained over her. "Upon
my word," said he, "I shall think it ne∣cessary
to put Willoughby upon his guard
a little."</P>
<P>"And how do you know, Sir," an∣swered
Celestina, "that Mr. Willoughby
will thank you for it? or, that admitting
Mr. Montague Thorold was really more to
me than a common acquaintance, which
you do not seriously believe, how are you
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
sure that your friend would not be rather
pleased, that the affections he may wish to
be troubled with no more, are transferred
to another?"</P>
<P>"Transferred!" exclaimed Vavasour.
"You admit then that such a transfer is
probable?"</P>
<P>"Not probable at all: but certainly it
would with most people be possible."</P>
<P>"And if it were with you, I am con∣vinced
that Montague Thorold is not the
man to whom Willoughby would wish them
to be transferred."</P>
<P>"He could, however, have very little
pretence, after having resigned them him∣self,
to dictate to whom they should be
given. But of what use, Mr. Vavasour, is
all this argument? Whether I shall ever
see Willoughby again or no is very uncer∣tain:
but it is very certain that if I do not,
I shall never marry at all."</P>
<P>Vavasour saw he had gone too far; and
Cathcart at that moment returning to them
to say the chaises were ready, the conver∣sation
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
dropped for that time; Celestina pe∣remptorily
resisting the efforts Vavasour
made to induce her to go at least the next
stage, in the chaise with him.</P>
<P>They reached Dorchester that evening;
and Celestina, after a slight supper, com∣plained
of being a good deal fatigued with
her journey, and going as soon as she could
to her chamber, left the two gentlemen to∣gether.</P>
<P>Vavasour, naturally unreserved, even to
indiscretion, and seldom taking the trouble
to conceal his sentiments, was totally off
his guard when he had drank five or six
glasses of wine; and since Willoughby,
who alone had the power to restrain any of
his excesses, had been less with him, he
had accustomed himself to take more than
double that quantity when he either dined
or supped. Celestina was no sooner gone
therefore, than he ordered in another bot∣tle
of claret, and before it was finished, he
had told Cathcart without reserve all that
he thought. Taking occasion to toast
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
Celestina, he said—"Tell me, Frank!
what do you think of her? Is she not a
charming girl?"</P>
<P>"Most undoubtedly," replied Cathcart,
she appears so to me, who know that her
very lovely person is the least of her merit;
to me, who owe her more than life, and
who throughout mine shall have reason to
bless the hour that first threw my Jessy in
her way."</P>
<P>"Yes, by heaven," cried Vavasour, "she
is an angel, and I cannot for my soul guess
at this strange mysterious business of
George's leaving her: for though it is a
desperate undertaking for a man to marry
at all, yet he had got over that, and doated
upon her to a degree that I never imagined
possible till I saw them together. I cannot
understand it; and the more I think about
it, the more incomprehensible it becomes.
Tell me, Cathcart, do you think he will
now ever marry her?"</P>
<P>"My dear Sir," replied Cathcart, "I
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
can only say with you, that the more I
think, the less I comprehend of the affair."</P>
<P>"I'll tell you, Frank: I am pretty well
persuaded that he never will marry her;
nay, that he has made up his mind to tie
himself to the fifteen thousand a year, and
the Viscount's title, which are the appen∣dages
of his cousin: yet why, unless he
had fully determined against all the temp∣tations
that match offered him—why carry
matters so far with Celestina? and who the
devil could those two women be who it
seems put the matter by and sent him off
in such a hurry?"</P>
<P>"I never could find out," replied Cath∣cart.
"He was himself the only person
who knew, and of him, as he avoided all
explanation, I could not enquire."</P>
<P>"What! did you never ask whether
they were young or old?"</P>
<P>"I asked; but the people hardly saw
their faces. They came in the evening,
and went away in the middle of the night;
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
but from the little information I could
make out, neither of them appeared young."</P>
<P>"I should have thought, (for you fel∣lows
that affect principle are not always to
be depended upon,) that George had got
into some filly scrape or other with some
wench that he might have promised to
marry: but any such entanglement might
have been easily got rid of, without his
flying away from Celestina or even from
his country. Well! there is no making
it out: but I believe it is clear enough that
Celestina will now never be <HI>his</HI> wife, and
that being once ascertained, Cathcart, do
you know she is the only woman upon
earth whom I shall ever think of making
mine?"</P>
<P>"Your's Sir!" exclaimed Cathcart.</P>
<P>"Aye, mine, Sir. I own 'tis rather ex∣traordinary
that even my divine Celestina
should make <HI>me</HI> meditate on matrimony;
but such a wonder was worthy of her only,
and she has effected it. I never was un∣easy
half an hour in my life about any
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
woman till I saw her at Alvestone, or ra∣ther
till I became acquainted with her; for
I have seen perhaps handsomer women, or
at least those that were at first view more
striking. Faith I found myself growing so
cursed foolish about her, that supposing
her then to be on the eve of marriage with
my friend George, I thought it best to fly
for it, and by going back to my old
haunts—you know my way—I got her out
of my head a little, and could have seen
her Willoughby's wife coolly enough; but
the moment I heard he had left her, this
confounded love, I suppose you call it,
began to play the devil with me again, and
I could not be easy, knowing the folks she
was with, without coming down to see
after her. However Captain Thorold, (it
was that puffing fellow I was most afraid
of,) had not, I believe, the least interest."</P>
<P>"Nor will any man have it, I fancy,"
replied Cathcart: "at least I am sure that
nothing less than the certainty of Mr. Wil∣loughby's
marriage with another, would
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
for a moment detach her from the invaria∣ble
affection she has for him. I even ques∣tion
if that would make any alteration in
her heart, though it might in her pros∣pects."</P>
<P>"Pooh, pooh," cried Vavasour, "you
have not studied women I find. Celestina
has too much spirit and too much sense to
mope away her youth and beauty, and
dwindle into the neglected ugliness of an∣cient
maidenhood, because Willoughby
did not know his own mind. Her pride,
and she is not without it, will help her to
get the better of an attachment which will
only be a source of mortification to her.
No, no, let me be once sure that Wil∣loughby
gives her up, and I don't think
it very presumptuous to say, that in a fort∣night
afterwards I carry her, to Ortney-bury,
Mrs. Vavasour."</P>
<P>"'Till then, however, Sir," said Cath∣cart—"till
you are quite sure that all is at
an end between Mr. Willoughby and Miss
De Mornay, you will of course hold it a
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
point of honour not to declare your in∣tentions.
It will distress her extremely if
you do. For thinking of you as I know
she thinks, she will conclude you are very
certain that all ties are dissolved between
them, or you would not address her in a
way, which, while those ties are undis∣solved,
she will call a breach of honour to∣wards
your friend."</P>
<P>"Aye, that's all very true," replied
Vavasour. "But let her take care then
how she shews a disposition to favour that
sucking parson—that Montague Thorold.
Though I'm willing to allow Willoughby
the preference, I am by no means disposed
to give the pas to such a green horn as
that: and to tell you the truth, Frank, If
I were sure she preferred him I might
commit some d—d folly or other."</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried Cathcart, rising to
wish him good night, "she is not likely
to be in his way; and if she were I am
very certain Mr. Willoughby has nothing
to fear from him; and as to yourself you
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
know, you agree, that while <HI>he</HI> is in question
<HI>you</HI> are entirely out of it."</P>
<P>Cathcart then left him to finish another
bottle alone, and carried with him no very
agreeable reflections. Notwithstanding all
that had passed he could not divest himself
of the hope of seeing Celestina united to
Willoughby, whom alone he thought
worthy of her. His own competence and
happiness, which they only had given him,
would, he felt, be incomplete if both or
either of them were unhappy; and un∣happy
he thought they must be if they
lived not for each other. Whatever
scheme therefore interfered with a union he
so much desired, he felt as a sort of injury
to himself; and though the extreme good
humour, generous spirit, and gay temper
of Vavasour, made it impossible to dislike
him, Cathcart was convinced, from the
little he knew of his manner of life and his
very free principles, that were Willoughby
wholly set aside, he was a man with whom
the sensibility and purity of mind of Celes∣tina
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
would never allow her to be happy:
he foresaw, therefore, nothing but uneasi∣ness
for her in his intended pursuit of her,
and thought with redoubled anxiety of
her situation.</P>
<P>As early the following morning as Va∣vasour
could be prevailed upon to move,
they renewed their journey; and about six
o'clock that evening, having taken leave
of Vavasour in Piccadilly, (who took Cath∣cart's
directions, in order to be with them
the next morning,) Celestina was set down
at the lodgings Mrs. Elphinstone had re∣moved
to in Suffolk-street, Charing Cross.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>CATHCART had given his sister no∣tice
of the arrival of Celestina, and there∣fore
the joy with which Mrs. Elphinstone
received her brother and the lovely person
to whom he had been so much obliged,
was unallayed by the surprise she might
have felt at the unexpected entrance of a
stranger.</P>
<P>Celestina was extremely pleased with her
new acquaintance, and very soon forgot
that she saw her for the first time. Her fi∣gure
was very tall and thin, and would have
had as much dignity as symmetry but that
an habitual though slight stoop seemed to
bespeak oppression of spirit and the weight
of many sorrows. Her face very much
resembled that of Cathcart; but the bloom
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
of youth and the glow of health were gone:
still it was interesting, though languid and
faded. Her eyes were eminently beauti∣ful;
and there was an air of mild resigna∣tion
over her whole countenance particu∣larly
touching, which, even in her most
cheerful moments, bespoke her rather study∣ing
how to bear the evils she seemed to
foresee, than capable of enjoying the passing
pleasure. Sorrow had left on her expres∣sive
features marks of it's cruel power, and
had anticipated the hand of time: for
though she was not yet thirty, she appeared
four or five years older; and her dress of∣fered
nothing to undeceive the imagination,
for it was so plain that nothing but it's ex∣treme
neatness and finer linen distinguished
her from women in the humblest rank
of life. Her manners, however, would, in
any dress or any situation of life, have
marked her for a well educated woman;
and her voice was particularly pleasing to
Celestina, who had been wearied by the
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
harsh monotony of Mrs. Thorold or the
affected lisp of her daughter.</P>
<P>Celestina had not been an hour in com∣pany
with Mrs. Elphinstone, before she
not only determined on going to Scotland
with her if it were practicable, but felt so
uneasy in the fear of a disappointment that
she wished to have it immediately discussed.
Cathcart, who easily understood her, then
began to talk the matter over with his sister,
and found, that from the hint of it which
he had before given her, she had been assi∣duously
removing every objection that
could arise. She answered for Mr. Elphin∣stone,
whom Cathcart had before described
to Celestina as good natured even to a fault,
and so fond of society as to have owed
great part of his misfortunes to a passion
for it; and Celestina, willing to be con∣vinced
of what she wished to believe, no
longer hesitated. Nothing then remained
but to prepare for their departure, which
was fixed to be at the distance of two days.
Cathcart undertook every preparation; and
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
having settled every thing as far as it could
be that evening, he took leave of Celestina,
for whom Mrs. Elphinstone had procured
an apartment in the same house, and went
to a coffee house, where he had bespoke
a bed, promising to be with them the next
morning.</P>
<P>Celestina early on that morning arose
to write the letter she had long meditated
to Willoughby. She was now able to give
such reasons for her quitting Mr. Thorold
as he could not disapprove; and though
he might perhaps think her present plan a
strange one, he would be easy, she thought,
in the reflection that it was attended with
no personal danger and that she was with
Cathcart's sister. One only objection now
struck her, and that was the length of time
which must elapse before she could re∣ceive
his letters: but on the other hand, if
the strange obstacles to their meeting re∣mained,
it was uncertain whether he
would write to her; and if they were re∣moved,
she hoped that he would fly to her
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
with equal eagerness whether she was in
Devonshire or in the extreme parts of
Scotland. She collected, therefore, every
thing her tenderness suggested to make
Willoughby easy about her if he still loved
her, and was shedding involuntary tears
over that painful doubt, when, as she had
just concluded her letter, Vavasour very
abruptly entered the dining room, where
Mrs. Elphinstone had not yet taken her
seat, being detained by the care of her four
children, whom she attended to entirely
herself.</P>
<P>Vavasour entered with the gay confi∣dence
of a welcome visitor; but was a little
disconcerted by the languid coldness with
which Celestina received him, and by the
air of melancholy she assumed, and the
traces of recent tears which he observed on
her cheeks. He enquired if she was not
writing to Willoughby; and on her an∣swering
"yes," asked her what she had said
to him of her future intentions as to resi∣dence.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="238"/>
"I have told him," replied she, "that
I am going to Scotland."</P>
<P>"To Scotland! impossible! you are
laughing at me."</P>
<P>"Indeed I am going to Scotland," said
she; "and I thought you had known it."</P>
<P>"To Scotland! No, I imagined you
would take lodgings either in London or
it's neighbourhood, and wait for letters
from George, which must soon be here and
be certainly decisive."</P>
<P>"That is by no means certain," an∣swered
Celestina; "and whatever the pur∣port
of those letters may be, I may hear it
there as well as here."</P>
<P>Vavasour now enquired more minutely
into her plan; against which he first le∣velled
his whole powers of ridicule, as be∣ing
wild, romantic, unpleasant, and pro∣ductive
of nothing but disappointment and
fatigue; but finding Celestina proof against
all the ludicrous lights in which he could
represent it, he became serious, and vehe∣mently
inveighed against the folly and ha∣zard
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
of a journey to the most desolate and
dreary country of Britain, to reside with
people whom she did not know, and who
were themselves only adventurers on a wild
and speculative scheme that would proba∣bly
be abortive. He represented very
forcibly the discomforts she must meet
with, and the little pleasure or knowledge
which the view of such a country could
offer to counterbalance them: but she was
as indifferent to local circumstances as to
the ridicule of those who would, he said,
laugh at her pilgrimage to the shrine of
St. Columba; and he had exhausted al∣most
all his arguments without making any
alteration in her resolution, when the en∣trance
of Mrs. Elphinstone and Cathcart
obliged him to desist.</P>
<P>From their conversation he had the mor∣tification
of hearing that every thing would
be ready for their journey the next day but
one, and of finding that Cathcart never
supposed he meant to object to any plan of
Celestina's, who was entirely mistress of her
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
actions. Unused to any opposition, Vava∣sour
could hardly brook it, even from those
who were his equals; and though he had
hitherto behaved to Cathcart as if he had
considered him as such, his spirit now re∣volted
at what he thought the opposition of
an inferior and a dependant. He became
silent during breakfast, and was very evi∣dently
displeased; and as soon as he could
he desired Cathcart to walk with him for
half an hour in the Park. He there re∣monstrated
very warmly against Celestina's
going, and urged, among many other rea∣sons,
the objections Willoughby would
make to it. Cathcart, convinced from
this conversation that it was necessary for
her to be removed as far as possible from
Vavasour, kept his temper, and referred
his impetuous opponent to Celestina her∣self.
He went back, therefore, to Mrs.
Elphinstone's lodgings to make another
effort, but had the additional mortification
of finding the ladies gone out to make pur∣chases,
and all his subsequent attempts that
<PB N="249" REF="241"/>
day to see them were abortive. The next, he
attended very early at their door, and saw
a chaise there, into which he found them
almost instantly stepping, to dine at Rich∣mond
with an old relation of Mrs. El∣phinstone's and Cathcart's, of whom it
was necessary for the former to take leave;
and all Vavasour's disregard for forms could
not authorise his intruding himself upon
them there. He called in the evening in
Suffolk-street, but they were not returned;
and was there again at ten o'clock, and
told they were gone to bed. At day
break the next morning he proposed to
beset the door, though almost hopeless now
of detaining Celestina. The habits of life,
however, he was accustomed to, and some
additional wine drank the evening before
to conquer his vexation; contributed to
keep him long after day break from being
on the watch; and on his arrival about se∣ven
o'clock, he learned from Cathcart,
who was just setting out for Devonshire
with the two little girls and a servant he
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
had hired to take care of them, that Ce∣lestina
and his sister had been gone above
two hours, and were probably many miles
on the North road. Vavasour received this
intelligence with indignation and resent∣ment,
which Cathcart pretended not to
observe; and busying himself in placing
his little girls in the chaise and settling
their baggage, he in a few moments wished
Vavasour a good morning, and left him to
curse his destiny at his leisure, which he did
very liberally for some moments; and
then determining to think no more of Ce∣lestina,
he plunged, in order to forget her,
into those scenes where he was certainly
not apprehensive of meeting any body like
her; and with a party he formed there, he
went in a few days to Ortney-bury, his seat
in Staffordshire, where he tried to persuade
himself that he hated and despised all mo∣dest
women, and never would give himself
a moment's concern about one of that de∣scription again.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="243"/>
Very differently did Montague Thorold
sustain the loss of Celestina's company,
and the cruel probability, amounting almost
he believed to a certainty, that he should
never see her again. While he remained
at his father's house, which was hardly a
week after her quitting it, he fed his un∣happy
love by collecting many little me∣morials
of her, which he preserved as sa∣cred
relics with all the fond idolatry of
romantic passion. A cambrick handker∣chief
which she had dropped, marked by
her own hands and with her own hair,
was one of the principal of these, and in it
he constantly kept folded up the sonnet,
written with a pencil, which he steeped in
milk to preserve the letters from being
erased; a card on which she had sketched
a landskape, and a profile which he at∣tempted
to make of her one evening by
a shade, though his trembling hand and
want of skill had deprived it of much re∣semblance,
were added to the packet which
he thus wore in his bosom, and which he
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
so delighted in contemplating, that he for∣got
all other claims upon his time; and
regardless of what his family said or thought,
passed whole days alone in the fields, or
when he was with them, was reserved, silent,
and restless.</P>
<P>Mr. Thorold saw all this with great con∣cern,
but still flattered himself that absence,
and returning again to his studies and his
college friends, would insensibly wean him
from the indulgence of a fruitless passion;
and sometimes he entertained a vague and
distant hope that if Willoughby resigned all
pretensions to the hand of Celestina, the
merit and attachment of Montague might
have a claim to her gratitude and her affec∣tion.
But of this he gave not the most dis∣tant
hint to his son, and parted with him
without naming Celestina, or seeming to
notice the state of his mind in regard to her.</P>
<P>Celestina in the mean time was journey∣ing
towards Scotland with Mrs. Elphin∣stone
and her two little boys. As Cathcart
had hired a chaise to carry them to Edin∣burgh,
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
where Elphinstone was to meet
them, they travelled slowly; but as the
weather was delightful, and her companion
became every day more agreeable to her,
Celestina was in no haste to reach the end
of her journey. Every thing in this part
of England was new to her; and since the
fatal hour of her separation from Willough∣by
she had never been so calm as she now
felt herself, though far enough from being
happy. The oftener she read over the let∣ters
she had received from Willoughby,
which were her constant companions, the
more steadily she reflected on his principles
and his character, more firmly she became
persuaded that whatever was the cause of
their separation, it was not owing to his pre∣ference
of another, to idle caprice, or to
any motive which should make her blush
for his morals or his heart.</P>
<P>In this reliance on the honour of the man
to whom her heart was fondly devoted, she
found so much consolation, that she drove
from her as resolutely as she could all those
suspicions which had embittered her mind
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
on the information Vavasour had given her.
She thought it very possible that the Castle∣norths
<HI>were</HI> gone abroad, because Lord
Castlenorth was never well in England;
and his lady, of more consequence among
the English in Italy than she could be in
London or even at Castlenorth, was much
fonder of being looked up to there, than in
being lost in the crowd of those who were
of equal or superior rank at home. Their
daughter too affected foreign manners and
foreign sentiments; and with the figure
and countenance of a coarse English fe∣male
peasant, assumed sometimes the ani∣mated
vivacity of the Neapolitan beauty,
and sometimes the insinuating languor of
the Venetian; and when in England, had
very frequently declared her dislike of the
people and the country, and expressed her
wonder that those who could converse in
any other, should use the harsh and vulgar
language of the English.</P>
<P>That a family thus disposed should not
remain in their native country, and above
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
all, after the mortification they must have
met with from Willoughby's rejection of
their alliance, was not extraordinary; but
Celestina endeavoured to persuade herself,
that though they were on the Continent
it was with no intention of renewing their
negociation with him, to which their pride
would never suffer them to stoop; and that,
though he should meet them there, it
would be on his part involuntary, and
only as the nephew of Lord Castlenorth,
by no means as the lover of his daughter.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all her arguments, how∣ever,
and all her dependance on Willough∣by's
love and constancy, she was sometimes
conscious of returns of suspicion and fear;
and unable wholly to stifle the pangs she
then felt, she endeavoured to think less of
herself and more of others; and above all,
to interest herself for Mrs. Elphinstone,
who seemed every hour more worthy of her
regard.</P>
<P>In the course of their conversation she
found, that Mr. and Mrs. Elphinstone,
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
reduced as they had lately been in circum∣stances,
had once been in a very different
situation of life; and she could not resist
the inclination she felt to learn what reverse
of fortune had thrown them into the dis∣tressed
condition which Jessy had described
to her, and which had made a deep and
painful impression on the generous sensi∣bility
of Celestina: but however her anxiety
was excited, she had so much delicacy as
to avoid wounding her new friend by shew∣ing
it: unlike that very common descrip∣tion
of people, who love to enquire into
the sorrows and misfortunes of others, not
with any view to relieve or even to soothe
them, but merely to gratify an impertinent
curiosity, and to rise higher in their own
idea by the comparison, while they cry like
the Pharisee—"Lord I thank thee that I
am not as other men are, even as this pub∣lican."</P>
<P>To an heart such as heaven had bestowed
on Celestina, there was something in mis∣fortune
not only respectable but sacred;
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
and she behaved towards Mrs. Elphinstone
with infinitely more attention than she could
ever prevail upon herself to shew to Mrs.
Thorold, amid all her bustle of affluence
and her claims upon the veneration of the
world from good dinners and rich connec∣tions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elphinstone, however, who was
aware that Celestina knew part of her his∣tory,
was very solicitous to relate to her the
whole of it; conscious that in her opinion
she should lose nothing, and that Celestina
had in some measure a right to enquire
into the life of a person to whom she had
given her confidence, and who was a can∣didate
for her friendship and her esteem.
She waited therefore a fit opportunity the
second day of their journey to drop some∣thing
of her family; and seeing that Celes∣tina
wished to know more, she said, smiling,—"It
is something like the personages
with whom we are presented in old ro∣mances,
and who meet in forests and among
rocks and recount their adventures; but
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
do you know, my dear Miss De Mornay,
that I feel very much disposed to enact
such a personage, and though it is but a
painful subject, to relate to you my past
life?"</P>
<P>"And do you know, dear Madam,"
replied Celestina, "that no wandering lady
in romance had ever more inclination to
lose her own reflections in listening to the
history of some friend who has by chance
met her, lost in the thorny labyrinth of
uneasy thoughts, than I have to listen to
you."</P>
<P>"Well then," rejoined Mrs. Elphin∣stone,
"you shall hear all that has be∣fallen
me, "even from my girlish days."
Mine has been a life, not marked, I think,
with any thing very extraordinary but in∣variable
ill fortune, which, though I could
not escape it, I trust I have sustained with
fortitude. But here," continued she, point∣ing
to her children, here are my little sup∣porters:
without them, without feeling
that they were a trust committed to me by
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
heaven, from my sacred attention to which,
no personal sufferings, no care for myself,
could exempt me even for a moment, I
am afraid that I should have tired long ago
in the rude and various path I have trod.
But my exordium will be longer than my
history.</P>
<P>"My family are of Scottish origin. My
father, one of it's younger branches, was
settled as a merchant in London, and was
engaged in the American trade, by which
he was making a respectable provision for
his family, of three daughters and three
sons, of whom my dear Frank was the
youngest, when the course of his business
brought him acquainted with the family of
Mr. Elphinstone, who had possessions in the
West India islands.</P>
<P>"The father of Mr. Elphinstone inhe∣rited
some of these from his family, but, of
a greater part, became possessed by pur∣chases
made of lands in the islands ceded
to England at the peace of 1762. They at
first promised to answer his most sanguine
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
expectations; and on the strength of those
promises he quitted the West Indies, where
he had lived many years on his own estate,
and came to London, establishing his
household in a stile of expence more suit∣able
to his imaginary than his real fortune.
His family consisted of a wife, who had
never been in England before, and who
brought with her all the pride she had
boundlessly indulged in Antigua, five chil∣dren,
and as many negroes.</P>
<P>"A few years convinced Mr. Elphin∣stone
that he had reckoned somewhat too
fast on his annual income; but he was not
disposed to diminish the shewy and expen∣sive
style in which he first set out; and had
he himself thought of it, the opposition he
was sure to meet with from his wife and
children would have deterred him from
any attempt to put a scheme of oeconomy
in practice.</P>
<P>"His daughters were most expensively
educated, and still more expensively
dressed, their mother wisely making a
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
point of their being always the best dressed
girls in the school to which they were sent,
though among their schoolfellows there
were many children of the nobility. The
two boys were placed at Westminster
School, where the elder was soon distin∣guished
for having more money and less
understanding than any boy of his age,
and where the tyrannical disposition which
he had been suffered to exercise over the
unfortunate black people among whom he
had passed his childhood, broke out in so
many instances, that he was as much hated
for his overbearing temper as despised and
laughed at for his ignorance and his vanity.</P>
<P>"The youngest, who is now my hus∣band,
was in every thing the reverse of his
brother: open, good humoured, and un∣designing;
too gay and careless to think,
too quick to learn, which, however para∣doxical
it may sound, is in many instances
true—the boy who knows he can learn in
half an hour a task which another cannot
conquer in a day, is very apt to let alone
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
learning it till application becomes too
late. Alexander Elphinstone however was
so much a favourite, that when he neg∣lected
to do his business somebody or other
was always willing to do it for him; and
when his father took him from school to
place him at an academy where he was to
be qualified for a merchant, he was as
much regretted as his brother was detested,
who had now acquired in the school the
name of 'Squire Squashy, which he never
afterwards lost.</P>
<P>"It was about the year 1770, that Mr.
Elphinstone, the father, in seeking for a
counting house to place his youngest son,
was introduced to my father. The pomp
with which the old gentleman was sur∣rounded,
the high style in which he ac∣customed
himself to talk, the detail of his
estates, (though some of them brought
him every year in debt,) his negroes, and
his sugar works, dazzled my father's eyes,
who had been accustomed only to a plainer
stile of life, and less flattering views of
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
profit. He was pleased with the thoughts
of taking into his counting house the son
of a man so opulent; and when he saw
the young gentleman himself, was imme∣diately
prejudiced in his favour. Elphin∣stone
was then a tall boy of sixteen: his
dark complexion was enlivened by black
eyes full of spirit and vivacity; and his
countenance, if not handsome, was expres∣sive
of an open and ingenuous mind. The
premium which my father asked was agreed
to, and young Elphinstone became one of
our family, which consisted of my father,
his second wife, by whom he had no chil∣dren,
my two sisters, and myself; for of my
three brothers, one was placed at the Tem∣ple,
another was gone to the East Indies,
and the youngest, my dear Frank, was
then at school.</P>
<P>"My mother-in-law was one of those
common characters which are so difficult to
describe unless it be by negatives. She was
not ill natured; she was not a woman of
understanding; she was not handsome;
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
she was not young; she was not well born
or well educated: but my father, who had
married her to take care of his family, and
to put the three thousand pounds she pos∣sessed
into his business, was well enough
contented to see that she did not behave
ill to his children, that she brought him no
more, and that she had always a plain din∣ner
ready for him when he came from
'Change; was satisfied with going on a
Saturday to a country house at Clapton,
near Hackney, and receiving the visits of
the wives and daughters of traders like
himself; and had been brought up with
no higher ideas of elegance than what were
answered by their society, or fancied any
superior entertainment was to be found
than what she enjoyed in the front boxes at
a play twice a year, or in a Christmas at∣tendance
at Hackney Assembly.</P>
<P>"It is true that on these occasions she
loved to be fine, to wear rich silks and
good lace, to clean and exhibit her mo∣ther's
rose-diamond ear rings, and to wear
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
my father's picture by way of bracelet,
fastened by garnets on her comfortable
round arm. But these were indulgences
about which he never contended; and was
rather pleased that Mrs. and the Miss
Cathcarts began to be considered as people
of some consequence in the circle in which
they moved, while he gradually obtained
in the city the name of a warm man.</P>
<P>"I was not more than eleven years old
when Mr. Elphinstone became a member
of our family. One of my sisters was four
years older, and the other a year younger;
but my eldest sister, at about the age of
seventeen, was married to a young West
Indian of whom my father had the care,
and went with him to settle in Barbadoes.
My sister Emily and I grew up to consider
Elphinstone as our brother; but I soon
learned to think of him with particular par∣tiality,
and to grieve at the frequent oc∣casions
which my father had to complain
of him. He was wild, eccentric, and un∣governable:
sometimes rode away to races
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
when he ought to have been settling with
the grocers, (for my father was now deeply
engaged in the West India trade,) and
sometimes got into scrapes with his old
schoolfellows, and was found at the watch-house
instead of the counting house; or if
he attended those solemn meetings at which
the price of freight or the quality of Osna∣burghs
was discussed, he turned the vene∣rable
persons of the old merchants and
grocers into ridicule; and while they
thought he was making calculations, was
frequently drawing caricatures of them in
all their majesty of wig, upon the leaves
of his memorandum book. But with all
this, he was so capable of business, so
ready with his pen, and so perfectly master
of accounts, that my father often said he
could do more business in an hour than he
himself could do in three; and that if once
he became steady, he would make a great
figure as a merchant.</P>
<P>"His father, the elder Mr. Elphinstone,
found it convenient, after his son had been
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
with us a year or two, to cultivate very as∣siduously
an acquaintance with our family.
Mrs. Elphinstone, who had reluctantly
consented that her youngest son should be
brought up a merchant, now condescended
to visit us, and in her drawling way to at∣tempt
civility. The Miss Elphinstone's
were directed to forget the distance between
Cavendish-square and Mincing lane, and
to visit us often; while we were of course
mightily delighted to receive invitations to
their routs, and to be admitted to add to
the croud which four or five times in a
winter filled their rooms in Cavendish
square.</P>
<P>"Insensibly my good mother in law ac∣quired
a taste for what was then called the
other end of the town; and no longer
contented with the gratifications of Haber∣dasher's
Hall, or the Crown and Anchor,
which had once been the utmost limits of
her ambition, she learned to sigh for the
Soho Assembly, for five and twenty tables,
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
and the company of "titled Dowagers
and Yellow Admirals."</P>
<P>"If this unfortunate mania seized her,
it was not wonderful that it extended it∣self
to us. Emily had a very fine voice,
and the Miss Elphinstones had concerts to
which she was invited. We both had
learned among ourselves to act parts of
plays; the Miss Elphinstones had at their
house at Ealing a private theatre, and we
were promoted to parts in their drama.
Looking upon us as inferior to them in
our persons, in our education, in our fa∣mily
and in our fortunes, no idea of rivalry
ever disturbed this intercourse, and insen∣sibly
we passed more time with them than
we did at home; whither I should always
have returned with murmurs and regret, if
it had not been the only place where I
could meet young Elphinstone without
witnesses, the only place where some folly
of the moment did not seem to make him
forget the preference he professed to give
me.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261"/>
"Such was the situation of the two fa∣milies,
when the eldest son of the Elphin∣stone's,
the gentleman who had been dis∣tinguished
at Westminster by the appella∣tion
of 'Squire Squashy, arrived from a
twelvemonth's tour in France and Italy,
and with him a sort of tutor who had been
sent with him at a very exorbitant salary.
To all the native arrogance and invincible
stupidity of his original character, this
elder brother had added the pertness of
fancied knowledge and the consciousness
of travelled superiority; a more disgusting
character could hardly be imagined. He
was now not only above all the rest of the
world, but infinitely above his own family:
his mother was silenced by—"Good Ma∣dam!
how is it possible <HI>you</HI> should know?"
his father, by a silent shrug of contempt
and a disdain of argument; while his
sisters, who piqued themselves upon their
elegance and fashion, were ridiculed for
being <HI>si bourgoise,</HI> that they were hardly
within the possibility of being made <HI>comme∣il
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
faut.</HI> As to my sister and myself, who
were with them when he arrived, he
looked at us once through his opera glass,
enquired who we were, and hearing we
were the daughters of his father's merchant
and lived in the city, he never, on any oc∣casion
that I can recollect, deigned to no∣tice
us again. Unhappily, the gentleman
who had travelled and who still continued
with him, saw with different eyes my poor
little Emily, then not quite fifteen: he
affected to be highly pleased with her sing∣ing,
and undertook to give her instructions.
He would teach us both French, and cor∣rected
our acting. We were invited to
pass two months at Ealing, at a house
which Mr. Elphinstone rented, and to
which his daughters had given the name
of Cypress Grove, though not a cypress
higher than a gooseberry-bush was near it;
and there we were to act plays: in which,
though the elder hope of the family de∣clined
taking a part and absented himself
from the set entirely, his travelling friend,
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
whose name was Beresford, was of great
consequence; and Alexander Elphinstone
was permitted by my father to quit, on
those occasions, the high counting stool
and sharp desk for the throne of King
Pyrrhus, or the triumphal car of his name∣sake
Alexander.</P>
<P>"I will own, that young as I then was,
being not quite sixteen, my childish heart
was enchanted with these amusements, es∣pecially
when <HI>he</HI> bore a part in them to
whom that heart was already so fondly
attached. Unsuspecting and artless, I
dreamed not of the mischief which lurked
under all this festive pleasure; and inca∣pable
of thinking for myself, I was a very
insufficient guard to my sister, who was
still younger and more thoughtless; yet to
me was she entrusted; unless, which did
not very often happen, my mother left
the card table to be a spectator of the
amusements of the younger part of the
company.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="264"/>
"Emily, however, was always with me;
but it is true that young Elphinstone was
always with me too, and in listening to
him, I heard not or attended not to the
more dangerous conversation with which
Mr. Beresford entertained my sister. He
contrived most artfully to put her upon her
guard against all confidence, which he
knew must ruin his scheme; and the first
idea I had of my poor Emily's misfortune,
was, when on awaking one morning I
found she was already risen, contrary to
her usual custom. I was not, however,
alarmed, till, on beginning to dress myself,
I found the drawers where we kept our
cloaths were emptied of every thing of
her's: even then I had only a confused idea
of what had happened, 'till, in looking
wildly round the room, I saw a note upon
the table, which I opened in trembling
astonishment, and read thus:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>To avoid any arguments in regard to
a step I was determined to take, I have
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
said nothing to you that I meant to leave
you. I hope you will forgive it: and
assure yourself I am safe, and in the care
of a man of strict honour, who will him∣self
write to my father; and I do not
know that I am accountable to any body
else but to him for my actions. You
shall hear of me soon; when I shall have
exchanged the name of Emily Cathcart
for that of your still affectionate sister,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Emily Beresford</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"My ideas were at once so painful and
so confused, that I lost all recollection for
a moment, and running down stairs half
dressed as I was, I asked in breathless agi∣tation
for my sister—my sister Emily! The
servants who were up, (for it was yet early
morning,) stared at me without compre∣hending
my distress; and I found nobody
disposed to attend to me till the younger
Elphinstone met me and eagerly enquired
what was the matter. I put the note I held
into his hand, sat down in the seat of a
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
window, and burst into tears. He saw in
a moment what my ignorance of the world
had in some measure concealed from me;
and knowing that Beresford was the last
man in the world likely to marry, he knew
that Emily was lost. Neither my father or
his wife were then at Ealing; and he
paused a moment on what could be done.</P>
<P>"He then endeavoured to console and
reassure me, and went to his father and his
mother to inform them of what had hap∣pened.
The old gentleman came to me in
a few moments, advised me to go imme∣diately
home and acquaint my parents, and
sent a servant for a post chaise, in which
he said his younger son should attend me.
I hardly know how I left the house; but
I remember Mrs. Elphinstone did not ap∣pear,
and that the young ladies expressed
none of that concern which I thought I
should have felt for the rest, had any one
of them disappeared under circumstances
so prejudicial to their fame."</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267"/>
The travellers now arrived at Stilton,
where they were to rest that night. It was
late, and Mrs. Elphinstone appearing a
good deal fatigued, Celestina besought her
to delay any farther gratification of her
curiosity till the next day. She then as∣sisted
her friend in giving her children their
supper and putting them to bed; and after
a short repast together, they retired to rest
in two beds in the same room, where the
children were already asleep.</P>

<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE following day they proceeded
early on their journey, and Mrs. Elphin∣stone
thus reassumed her narrative.—"In
our way from Ealing to London, Alexan∣der
Elphinstone endeavoured by every ar∣gument
in his power to strengthen my re∣solution,
and calm those fears I expressed
at meeting with my father and mother; who
would, I apprehended, be enraged against
me for a misfortune they had themselves
taken no pains to prevent. This dreadful
meeting must however be hazarded: I
tottered as well as I was able into the dining-room,
and sending for my father out of
his counting-house, I put into his hands
the fatal note, and informed him as well
as I could of what had happened. He
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
was too reasonable to blame me for an
error he had as little foreseen himself; but
hastening out of the room with Elphin∣stone,
enquired, as I afterwards learned,
whether he thought Beresford meant to
marry my sister? Elphinstone, with some
hesitation, answered that he feared not. "Let
us then," said he, "endeavour to find
her, and if it be possible, hush up this un∣happy
affair before it becomes more known."</P>
<P>"Elphinstone most willingly agreed to
assist him in the search, and my elder bro∣ther
was sent for from the Temple for the
same purpose. <HI>His</HI> anger and indignation
were much more turbulent than my father's.
He vowed vengeance against Beresford,
and sat out in pursuit of him in such a
temper of mind as made me dread the
consequence should he find him.</P>
<P>"To find him, however, every effort
proved abortive. Among other places, my
Mr. Elphinstone went to enquire for him
at the lodgings his elder brother had taken
in Piccadilly. The 'Squire received him
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
with that contemptuous coldness which he
thought was all he owed to a merchant's
clerk; and upon his eager enquiry after
Berresford, and learning the reason of it,
he said—"What a fuss is here, indeed,
about a little grisette: why, one would
think Beresford had carried off an
heiress. Let him alone, and I dare say
he will bring her back again." His bro∣ther,
enraged at this insult, spoke to him
very freely, which he returned no other∣wise
than by calling him quill-driver, and
maccaroni of Mincing-lane. The brothers
parted in wrath; and the younger returned
home lamenting his fruitless search, and
devising new measures for the next day.
These, however, were equally successless.
Poor Emily was lost to us for ever; and
the feeble hope that Beresford might have
married her every day became fainter.</P>
<P>"This unhappy affair put an end to our
intercourse with the Elphinstone family,
and was indeed the first signal of a long
long series of calamities. I observed that
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
my father grew extremely uneasy at some∣thing
that related to the situation of his
affairs: he began to complain that Mr.
Elphinstone's remittances fell very short of
what he expected; that he was paid no in∣terest
for the large sums he had advanced
for him; and while he was deliberating
how to get out of the difficulties these cir∣cumstances
threw him into, he received
information, that Mr. Elphinstone, deeply
involved before, had been overwhelmed
by the expences of his eldest son, and the
failure of his remittances, had gone off in
the night from his house at Ealing to Fal∣mouth,
whence he had embarked in the
packet for Antigua; while his lady and fa∣mily
had shut up their houses at Ealing
and in Cavendish-square, and were gone
to Bath.</P>
<P>"These terrible tidings fell on my fa∣ther
like a stroke of thunder, and for some
time he was unable to attempt applying
any remedy to the evils he saw gathering
around him. But from the torpor of imme∣diate
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
anguish, he was roused by the pres∣sing
demands of those, of whom he had on
his own security borrowed money for the
supply of Mr. Elphinstone. It was at a
season when many months were to intervene
before he could receive any remittances from
his correspondent, even if his correspondent
should have honour enough to send them,
and bankruptcy and ruin seemed inevi∣table.
He had however, as he thought, a
friend in a very eminent banker, who a
few months before, on his engaging so
largely with Mr. Elphinstone, had heard
some report that that gentleman, had in∣fluenced
him in favour of the banker with
whom <HI>he</HI> was connected; on which my
father's friend, a man of immense pro∣perty,
had then written to him thus—</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The intimation I have this day re∣ceived
of your connection about to be
formed with Mr. Elphinstone, is the oc∣casion
of this address.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="273"/>
It would be injurious to that friend∣ship
you so constantly professed towards
me, to doubt a moment, that, to have
an occasion of serving me, would be a
real pleasure to your good self. From
a conversation between Mr. Elphinstone
and my brother Peter, (who were ac∣quainted
by meeting at the house of
Sibley and Co.) I am very apprehensive
we run the risk of losing a connection so
pleasing to me, by <HI>his</HI> influence and
inclination to another house. Upon
your friendship, dear Sir, I rely to save
me from so great a mortification and
concern: as I flattered myself the con∣nection
between your house and ours,
was formed for many many years. Let
your goodness towards me, therefore,
prevent your other connections from
breaking it; and I hope your friendship
for me admits of no diminution, as
mine towards you never will assuredly.

<P>To this <HI>affectionate</HI> and <HI>sincere</HI> gentle∣man
(whom my father had instantly obliged
in dropping all thoughts of complying with
Elphinstone's request,) he now wrote; and
describing with great simplicity his pre∣sent
embarrassment, which he hoped would
be only temporary, besought him to ad∣vance

sorry it is not in our power to comply

</LETTER>
<P>"The eyes of my poor father were now
compleatly opened, and all the horrors of
his fate were before him. Young Elphin∣stone,
still sanguine as to his father's pro∣perty
and his father's honour, was on this
occasion his great resource. He was in∣defatigable
in stemming the torrent of ill∣fortune
thus brought upon us; and suc∣ceeded
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
so well by various expedients, as
to support for a while the sinking credit of
the house; but seeing my father become
every day more and more anxious, and
doubtful about the elder Mr. Elphinstone,
he proposed to go over to Antigua himself;
and to this proposal added, that of marry∣ing
me and taking me with him. My fa∣ther,
who found his health giving way un∣der
the accumulated calamities that had
lately befallen him, now thought it better
to accept this proposal, and by a union of
families make it Mr. Elphinstone's interest
to be just. We were married then, after
a reluctant consent wrung from the haughty
mother of my lover, and three weeks after∣wards
embarked for the West Indies.</P>
<P>"I was not yet old enough to consider the
situation of our fortune with any great con∣cern:
but I parted from my own father
with a sad presentiment that we were to
meet no more, and I dreaded my intro∣duction
to the father of my husband. But
I loved <HI>him;</HI> he was the most cheerful and
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
sanguine creature in the world; and painted
to me only scenes of prosperity and
happiness, which I was well pleased to con∣template
as true representations. Gracious
heaven! could I <HI>then</HI> have foreseen all
the misery that was in store for me, how
should I have shrunk from a destiny so in∣supportable!
how should I have wished
that in a violent storm we met in the Bay
of Biscay, we might perish.</P>
<P>"We arrived, however, after a tedious
passage, at Antigua; and I was relieved
from the discomforts of a long voyage, to
encounter, as I believed, what I dreaded
more—the disdain and rudeness of my fa∣ther
in law. I landed, trembling with this
apprehension, disgusted with every thing I
saw, and overcome with heat and sickness:
but the first intelligence we heard was,
that Mr. Elphinstone had been dead about
a week of an epidemical distemper, and
that his houses and plantations were in the
possession of the agents of his eldest son.</P>
<P>"It was in vain that my husband desired
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
to be admitted to reside on one of them
till he could see into his father's affairs: the
people who had been placed there refused
him any satisfaction; and it was only by
applying to the Governor that he at length
obtained a sight of the will, by which he
found that his father had left every thing to
his elder brother, and an annuity to his
mother of eight hundred a year, with five
thousand pounds, to each of his daughters
and to his youngest son: but as the estates
were not charged with these last legacies,
nor able to pay them if it had, his nominal
fortune gave him but little comfort, nor
alleviated the concern with which he saw
too evidently that all the sums of money
lent by <HI>my</HI> father to <HI>his,</HI> were entirely
lost.</P>
<P>"The pain this gave him, the incessant
fatigue to which he exposed himself in go∣ing
to Granada and St. Vincents, where
his father had made purchases, at length
overcame the natural strength of his con∣stitution.
After we had been about four
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
months in the West Indies, living with
his friends, he was seized at Granada with
one of those severs so common in that cli∣mate.
An old French lady, who lived on
her own estate near the lonely habitation
where he was taken ill, had pity upon him,
took him to her house, and by her extra∣ordinary
care carried him through the disor∣der:
but he was very long in a state of infan∣tine
weakness, and could articulate nothing
but a request that he might see his wife.
It was some time before I received intel∣ligence
of his situation, and some time lon∣ger
before I could get to him. The kind∣ness
of our foreign friend did not stop
there: I was now in a state which excited
her generous compassion towards me, and
she insisted, that instead of returning to
Europe in a situation so unfit for a voyage,
I should stay with her, till the birth of my
child.</P>
<P>"Poor Elphinstone's weak condition of
health indeed, rendered such a voyage as im∣practicable
for him as for me. We accepted
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
therefore the generous hospitality of Ma∣dame
Du Moulinet, and at her house in
Granada my eldest child was born.</P>
<P>"During the five months we remained
there, we heard that the elder brother
was come over himself to Antigua and had
taken possession of every thing. We had
therefore no business to go back, where
we had no authority nor indeed any provi∣sion;
but as soon as our hostess would
give us leave, embarked again, to return
to England more destitute than we had left
it, and with a little unfortunate baby to
share our distresses.</P>
<P>"We arrived there, after an absence of
thirteen months; and hastened to London
as cheaply as we could, for we had very little
money. My poor Elphinstone left me at
the inn where we stopped, and went to
my father's house. Never shall I forget the
look with which he returned to me: his
bloodless cheeks, his wild eyes, his trem∣bling
lips, spoke before he could utter a
syllable. He sat down; looked earnestly
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
on me a moment, then on his child, which
was sleeping in my arms, started up, ran
from us, staggered towards the wainscot,
and fell.</P>
<P>"My screarns brought the people of the
inn into our miserable room. They took
up the unhappy young man, and gave him
what assistance they could, supposing that
he had fallen into a fit. After a moment,
he recovered his speech, and entreating to
be left alone with me, told me that my fa∣ther
was dead insolvent, all his effects
sold, and my mother in law gone to reside
with her relations in the North: "and 'tis I
have undone thee, my Sophy," cried he—tis
I and my family who have reduced
thee to beggary, and now I have not a
place wherein to shelter thee and this dear
hapless innocent."</P>
<P>"Agony now choaked his utterance; and
all my resolution was necessary to prevent
his relapsing into the state he had just reco∣vered
from. Stisling therefore my own an∣guish,
I besought him to take courage; de∣clared
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
that I feared nothing while he was
with me and well, and urged him to think of
some place where we might pass the night
and recover courage to encounter what was
before us.</P>
<P>"He seemed comforted by my calmness,
and recollected an old servant of his father's
who kept a lodging house in Northum∣berland-street.
Thither we determined to
go; the man was gone from thence, but
some other people who let lodgings now in∣habited
the house: they had a bed cham∣ber
on the second floor to let; and know∣ing
something of us, took us in.</P>
<P>"Fatigue of body overcame for a short
time the agony of mind my poor husband
had felt. He was asleep by me; my infant
was at my breast; but <HI>I</HI> could not sleep;
all the horrors of poverty were before me,
and my agitated spirit ran over every hope
which yet remained for us, but rested se∣curely
on none.</P>
<P>"The morning at last came; and I now
desired Elphinstone to enquire out my el∣dest
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
brother, who when we went away had
chambers in the Temple; and to discover
what was become of my dear Frank, whom
we had left at school, and to whom I was
always fondly attached. Poor Emily too
recurred to me, but for her, alas! I
dared not enquire.</P>
<P>"He went out, therefore, after break∣fast,
and returned in about an hour with
looks that gave me no favourable impres∣sion
of his success. My eldest brother, he
told me, had left his chambers, and had
been married some months to a young wo∣man
of some fortune, at least in expectancy,
being the only child of her parents, with
whom they lived; and that her father, an
attorney of practice in Warwick-court Hol∣born,
had taken my brother into his busi∣ness.
"I saw him however," said Elphin∣stone;
"but he received me so coldly
that I shall hardly repeat the visit."</P>
<P>"My heart sunk cold within me, and
I had hardly courage to ask what was be∣come
of Frank.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="284"/>
"He is at I know not what academy,
replied Elphinstone. "Your brother John
told me, very coolly, that though he was
so lucky as to have a provision by mar∣riage
himself, it was out of his power to
provide for all his father's family; and
thought it quite enough, that he had been
at so much expence for Frank, who must
now," said he, "do something for himself,
for I cannot undertake to pay his school∣ing
another year: and you, Sir, as it is
owing to your family that my father was
ruined, I hope you will now take this
burthen off my hands; for my wife's fa∣mily
are very much discontented at my
bearing it."</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" cried I, "what will
become of us! Oh, my poor baby! why
wert thou ever born!"</P>
<P>"To embitter our calamities," cried El∣phinstone.
"Rather ask, my Sophy, why
<HI>I</HI> was ever born, who brought them upon
thee, and on that dear little victim."</P>
<P>"We had so little money left, that it
was necessary to think of something di∣rectly:
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
Elphinstone therefore went out
again to enquire after his mother and his
sisters, from some of those families who
had, during their splendour, been the
fondest of their society and the most fre∣quently
at their house. Among these was
one lady who had always professed the
greatest affection in the world for them
all; never spoke to Mrs. Elphinstone
but as her dear friend, nor to her
children under any other appellation
than her sweet creatures, or her amiable
young friends. Elphinstone gave me, as
nearly as he could, the words in which she
answered his enquiry.</P>
<P>"Why, my dear, dear Sir, you must
think how shocked and amazed I was—your
poor good mother!—to be sure I
had a most sincere regard for her—and
your sisters too; good sweet young wo∣men—so
amiable, so accomplished!—I'm
amazed they never married.—Well,
poor things—God knows, to be sure,
what is best for us:—Whatever is, is
right, as Pope observes."</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="286"/>
"But, dear Madam, I must beg to learn
where my mother and my sisters are?—I
am but just come from the ship that
brought me back to England."</P>
<P>"Is it possible!—Poor young gentle∣man!—I'm
sure I wish I could inform
you of any thing agreeable. You don't
know, then, perhaps, that every thing in
Cavendish-square, and at Ealing, was
sold under executions, as I heard; but I
heartily hope it was not so. Such a re∣spectable
family! and so many fine young
people! and your poor good mother!—I
saw her at Bath last winter, after those
disagreeable affairs, and was sorry to see
that she had lost a great deal of her
cheerfulness. To be sure that was not to
be wondered at. I told her how sincerely
I wished her a pleasant voyage, poor
worthy woman!" After being compelled
to listen to a great deal more of this ful∣some
cant, he at length learned that one of
his sisters boarded with an apothecary's fa∣mily
at Bath, being in an ill state of health;
and that his mother, and the other two
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
sisters, finding Mr. Elphinstone, who was
distinguished as 'Squire Squashy, little dis∣posed
to do them justice, had, by advice of
their friends, embarked for Antigua; so
that we probably passed them at sea.</P>
<P>"This was terrible! Every resource
seemed to fail us, and in a few days fa∣mine
was likely to stare us in the face.
My beloved brother Frank, however, was,
among all my own distresses, ever near my
heart; and I determined for his sake, and
because I would leave nothing unattempted
for Elphinstone and my child, to go myself
to my eldest brother, to implore the kind∣ness
of one, and obtain a sight of the other.
I said nothing, however, to Elphinstone
of this intention, fearing he might op∣pose
it. I set forth alone, with my baby
in my arms, for I could not leave it,
nor could I afford to hire a coach. I rap∣ped
at the door; and enquiring for Mr.
Cathcart, was told by the footman who
opened it, that I might wait in the passage,
and he would see. In the passage I waited
some minutes, and was then told that Mr.
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
Cathcart was busy with some gentlemen,
and that I must send in my business and
call again.</P>
<P>"Ah! Miss De Mornay, you have no
relations, I think; nor can ever, nor will
ever, I hope, "feel how sharper than a ser∣pent's
tooth it is" to meet cruelty and
scorn from those to whom the sick heart
looks for pity and protection.</P>
<P>"I was unwilling to send in my name
and a verbal message, as there were people
with him; I therefore sat down on a bench
where porters and servants sit in those pas∣sages,
and wrote with a pencil—"It is
your sister Sophy, who cannot call again."
This brought out the great man, for great
he suddenly was become. His likeness to
my father, the tender recollection that he
was my brother, made me forget all his
unkindness the moment I saw him, and
I was throwing myself and my child into
his arms, when a cold—how d'ye do Mrs.
Elphinstone? fixed me to the place. I
suppose he thought by my looks that I
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
should faint, and was afraid of being ex∣posed
to his servants and new relations,
for he took my hand, faintly kissed my
cheek, and leading me into a little dark
parlour where there was no fire, and desired
me to sit down.</P>
<P>"Some remains of natural affection,
which, in a young man, is very rarely
totally extinguished, seemed to be contend∣ing
with pride, avarice, and mean policy,
and for a while kept him silent: he then
enquired coldly into our situation, and as
I related it, (for he had no idea it was so
bad,) I saw those affections gradually shrink
from the detail: his heart seemed to become
harder as it's tenderness became more ne∣cessary;
and he declared to me at last,
that I had formed erroneous ideas of his
situation if I thought it was in his power
to be of any service to me. I rose to go;
but desired a direction to Frank, which he
gave me very unwillingly; for since I
could contribute nothing to his support,
he thought it useless for me to see him.
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
I do not now very well know how I got out
of the house of this cruel brother, who ne∣ver
introduced me to his family, or seemed
to wish to see me again: but I recollect
that when I came into Holborn I became
so very faint and sick, that I was obliged
to get into a coach to return home, which
I paid for by changing the last guinea I had
in the world.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear Miss De Mornay!
veteran in sorrow as I have since been, I
look back with wonder on the scene I af∣terwards
passed through; I wonder how
I supported it. We lingered on for three
months at these lodgings; my beloved
Frank often, and always happy to be with
us. He was now near sixteen; very tall and
very manly, and repeatedly declared to
Elphinstone that he was well able to get
his bread, or to assist him in any way of
business he could enter into. Business
however was not to be obtained without
money; but my father's creditors knowing
how well Elphinstone was acquainted with
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
his affairs, engaged him to assist them in
recovering debts due to him, and allowed
him from time to time some very trifling
compensation, which was our only sup∣port.</P>
<P>As long, however, as he was well—as
long as my little boy blest me by it's
innocent smiles, I murmured at nothing;
and the little time I could spare from nurs∣ing
him, and after he was in his cradle of
a night, I found exquisite pleasure in ap∣plying
those little arts I had learned as
matters of amusement, to the purposes of
profit. They produced not much; but in
our situation every thing was an help; and
our simple meal, partly the produce of my
industry, and shared with my brother
Frank, after Elphinstone came home of a
night, was infinitely a sweeter banquet
than the insipid though splendid tables of
the affluent had formerly afforded me. At
length, however, the persecution of ill for∣tune,
which seemed to have relaxed a
little, began anew, and misery fell upon me
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
where I could least bear it. Elphinstone
was seized again with an infectious fever,
differing only from that he had at Gre∣nada,
in the symptoms occasioned by dif∣ference
of climate. On his attendance on
the creditors, our daily and scanty subsist∣ence
depended: with his confinement,
every aid of that sort ceased; and I saw
him languishing in a sick bed, in all the
depression of a malignant fever, without the
means of giving him the necessary assist∣ance.</P>
<P>"A neighbouring apothecary, however,
attended him, who told me that wine was
absolutely necessary to be given him in
large quantities. Where was I to get it?—For
the first time, I had recourse to a
pawnbroker, and my dear, dear Frank was
my agent: for now, attached entirely to
us, he quitted his school, where, indeed,
he knew more than the master, and gave
himself up wholly to our service: while
my brother John, not sorry to be relieved
from the expence of supporting him, re∣monstrated,
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
or rather quarrelled with him
once, and, obtaining an excuse for shak∣ing
him off, saw him no more.</P>
<P>"I had a watch, and a few trinkets;
these were first disposed off, and then such
clothes as I could spare; for I could not
endure the thoughts of taking any thing that
belonged to Elphinstone, though my trem∣bling
heart too often whispered that he
would want them no more. Youth, and
the strength of his constitution, carried him
on many days through a rapid and gene∣rally
fatal distemper; and, at length, my
fainting courage was sustained by the hope
of his recovery, when my lovely infant
was seized with the same terrible disorder;
and I was told, that as it was almost
always fatal to children, I must not hope.</P>
<P>"I know not, then, what became of
me; but I think, that for some hours I was
not in my senses. I recollect being seized
with an earnest wish to have my child
attended by a physician I had heard named,
as eminent for his humanity as for his
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
peculiar skill in this disorder; and, as Frank
was not at that moment with us, I wrap∣ped
myself in an old cloak, and leaving
my poor infant to the care of his father,
who was just able to sit by the cradle and
look at him with eyes of hopeless agony, I
went away myself to implore this physician
to come to us; and had just sense enough
to remember the direction I had received
to his house, but none to notice the objects
around me, or to care what people might
think, who saw me, with wild looks and
uncertain steps, hurrying through the crowd
of the busy and the happy.</P>
<P>"I had proceeded as far as the corner
of Cecil-street, when a croud of carriages
and passengers impeded the crossing; I
was making my way through them, heed∣less
of the danger, and hardly hearing the
noise, when a footman, in a livery glitter∣ing
with lace, stopped me, and told me he
was ordered by his lady to beg I would
step to the door of her carriage and speak
to her.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="295"/>
"Oh! I cannot; I cannot, indeed," re∣plied
I, without enquiring who his lady
was: "my child—my child is ill—I am
"going for advice for him." I would have
passed the man; but he followed me, and
pointed to an elegant vis-a-vis that was
drawn up close to the broad pavement.
"Here is my lady, Ma'am," said the man.</P>
<P>"I looked up:—it was my Emily, my
long lost, lamented Emily! I gave a faint
shriek, and hardly heard her in a low and
tremulous voice articulate—"My sister!
"my sister Sophy!"</P>
<P>"Not quite in my senses when I left
my lodgings, this interview quite robbed
me of them. I caught hold of the door of
the carriage, or I should have fallen in the
street. Every object swam before me; and
I retained only recollection enough to cry,
"My child! my child! save my child!"
and to hear Emily repeat—"What child?
"what can I do for you? Good Heaven!
what can I do for you?" But I was unable
to answer. I found myself, however, in
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
a few moments, placed in the carriage, and
Emily holding her salts to my nose, and
chafing my temples. When my senses
returned, my child was their first object;
and again I exclaimed—"Oh! do not, do
not detain me; I must go to save my
child—my poor little boy!"</P>
<P>"My dear, dear sister," cried Emily,
pray summons your recollection, and tell
me whither you would go; we will drive
"to the place directly." In my anxiety
for the life of my infant; I forgot the
culpable conduct of my sister; and, telling
her where the physician lived, she gave
orders to her coachman to hasten thither
instantly. A strange stupor overwhelmed
me; I could not speak till we came to the
door of the house: I then looked out;
I would have flown out of the carriage.
He was not at home: but just as we were
leaving the door, he drew up to it.</P>
<P>"Then my voice and recollection re∣turned
to me. I besought him most ear∣nestly
to go with me. He was that mo∣ment
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
come from his first round of visits to
change his horses, and begged we would
wait a few moments: but Emily urged
him so earnestly to get into her carriage,
saying she would take him to my lodgings
and bring him back, that he could not
resist her importunity. He went with us
then; and so totally was my mind absorbed
in the danger of my child, that I heeded
not the strange contrast between my appear∣ance
and the gay splendour of my sister; I
forgot what she was, and almost who she
was; and only enquired, when the phy∣sician
had seen my child, whether he
would live.</P>
<P>"I saw by his looks his opinion to the
contrary; nor, indeed, did he attempt to
conceal it: but he besought me to attend
to my own health, and to that of my hus∣band;
gave directions about us all, and
departed with my sister, refusing the fee I
offered him, and telling me he would
come again early the next day.</P>
<P>"Elphinstone, amazed as he was at
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
the scene that had passed, had no power to
enquire the meaning of it, and I had none
to explain it: all my resolution was roused
to attend my dying infant; but all could
not save him—he died: and I now tell it
with dry eyes, though, when it besel me, I
thought no blow could be so severe, and
that I could not survive it:
<Q><L>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,</L>
<L>To him that did but yesterday suspire</L>
<L>Never was such a gracious creature born!</L></Q></P>
<P>"Yet I have lived now above ten years
longer, my dear Miss De Mornay; and
have learned that there are such evils in
life as make an early death a blessing.</P>
<P>"I was delirious, I know not how long,
between the excess of my affliction and the
opiates that were given me to deliver me
awhile from the sense of my misery. In
the mean time my sister sent a careful per∣son
to attend me, and saw me every day
herself, though I no longer knew her, or
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
any body but Elphinstone, whose hand I
held for hours, imploring him not to let
them take my child from me. Emily did
yet more: she supplied us with every thing
we wanted, attended herself to the funeral
of my poor baby, and then took lodgings
for us at Kensington, that we might be re∣moved
from the place where we had suf∣fered
so much calamity. In her frequent
visits she spoke not either to Elphinstone
or Frank, unless they first spoke to her;
and never but on the subjects of my health
and ease. I was not yet quite restored to
my senses when we removed. She sent us,
by a porter, the next day, a forty pound
note, with these words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY EVER DEAR SOPHY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Having been lucky enough to be of
some use to you, I rejoice that we have
met: but now, if our future meetings
should be unpleasant to you, it depends
entirely on you whether they shall be
repeated. Whatever may be my failings,
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
or my errors, I trust that among them
will never be reckoned, want of love
to my relations, whether they will ac∣knowledge
or no,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>your still affectionate EMILY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"As soon as I was capable of reading
and understanding this, all that had passed
came back to my recollection. I had been
supported, then, for many days, by the
wages of shame; and now had nothing
but a gift from the same hand, to save my
husband, my brother, and myself, from
actual hunger. "Oh! my dear father,"
cried I, "can you forgive your unfortunate
child; or rather, your unfortunate chil∣dren!
and ought I to refuse taking this
lovely lost one, whose heart, so generous,
so full of sensibility, cannot surely be
quite hardened in a course of evil!"—I
shall tire you, my dear Madam, if I am so
minute: suffice it to say, that I saw my
sister; that she owned all her guilt, and all
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
her folly; without having the power, or, at
that time, perhaps, the wish, to quit a man∣ner
of life, where she possessed boundless
splendour and luxury, for such a preca∣rious
subsistence as women can earn in bu∣siness.
My remonstrances she heard with
gentleness, and mingled her tears with
mine: but she pleaded gratitude to the
friend who supported her, and the impossibility
of her abandoning him, or existing if
she did. I was afraid of enquiring who
this was; but I found that it was some
man of high rank who had taken her from
the worthless Beresford, and with whom
she had lived ever since.</P>
<P>"Her purpose seemed to be to detach
my thoughts as much as possible from her
situation, and to fix them on my own: and
indeed it was very necessary; for we had
now, in consequence of Elphinstone's long
illness, no support whatever but what her
tenderness afforded us.</P>
<P>"As Elphinstone recovered his health,
his sanguine temper returned, and again
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
he formed various projects of entering into
business. It was now the midst of the
American troubles; and some part of my
father's property, which was thought reco∣verable,
was there. Elphinstone, who now
from long habit and from his natural dispo∣sition,
was become unsettled and fond of
speculative schemes, proposed to the credi∣tors
to go over there in search of these sums.
I was still too ill and too much depressed by
past sufferings to give very minute atten∣tion
to this plan: I only resolved not to be
left behind, but to share his destiny what∣ever
it might be. In a fortnight or three
weeks he was every day in town, and the
latter part of that time returned in remark∣ably
gay spirits, and told me of I know
not what prospects that were opening to
him; to which, indifferent to every thing
beyond a mere subsistence, now that I had
lost my boy, and long accustomed to hear
of visionary fortune, I gave very little ap∣plause,
till he came home one day elated
beyond what I had ever seen before, and
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
told me that an offer had that day been
made him to become a sort of under secre∣tary
to a man high in administration, into
whose house he was to be taken; that he
was to enter on his place the following
week, had taken a lodging for me in the
neighbourhood, and hired two female ser∣vants
and a footman to attend.</P>
<P>"I wondered at, and rather blamed his
precipitancy; but he assured me he was
right. Frank went with us, as he was to
be a sort of secretary, in his turn, to El∣phinstone,
who was now domesticated with
his patron, while my brother and I were in
very handsome lodgings in Westminster.
I do not know by what means the money
came, but from this time it was as plen∣ty
with Elphinstone as it had before been
scarce. In a few months his views were so
much enlarged that he took a house for me,
increased the number of his servants, and
from one thing to another our establish∣ment
was at length on a footing of splen∣dour,
against which I remonstrated in vain.
<PB N="302" REF="304"/>
He assured me that his future success
depended on his keeping up such an ap∣pearance;
that the emoluments of his
place fully entitled him to it; and that
I should soon see him permanently fixed
in a situation, such as would put us out
of the power of fortune.</P>
<P>"In the mean time, as I never loved
London, and as my health was very much
hurt by a long continuance in it, I pre∣vailed
on him to let me have a small house
at Shene, near Richmond, where it would
not be necessary, for me at least, to be
always in company, which began to be
unavoidable in London. To this propo∣sal
he consented at first with reluctance;
but afterwards, I thought he was not sorry
to have his house in town at liberty to
receive the parties he now made there, by
which it became distinguished for good
cheer and high living. I had by this
time two boys; one of whom I have since
lost, and the other is the eldest of these:
and with many a silent and stisled sigh I
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
wished their father would think, while
in this prosperous train of fortune, of
making some provision for his increasing
family.</P>
<P>"He heard me always with his usual
good temper, and as constantly assured me
that he was laying by money every year;
though I never could guess how or from
whence it came.</P>
<P>"Frank, however, was not only sup∣ported
like a gentleman, but had really
more money than, had he been less pru∣dent
and steady, would have been proper
for so young a man.</P>
<P>"Of this, notwithstanding the infec∣tious
example of the people among whom
he lived, and even of Elphinstone himself,
he always brought a part to me to put by
for him. On these occasions I sometimes
questioned him of their manner of life in
London, whence I now entirely absented
myself; and though he gave me such
answers as would, he thought, prevent
my inquietude, he was too ingenuous to
<PB N="304" REF="306"/>
be able to conceal the whole truth. Thus
my prosperity was embittered by the fear of
falling again into the adversity, from which
we had been delivered by miracle; and I
lived in perpetual dread of evils I had no
power to prevent. Alas! the greatest evil
was already arrived—the estrangement of
Elphinstone's heart!—I saw it in a thou∣sand
instances; but I knew that reproaches
and importunity would not recal it; and I
endeavoured, whenever he came down to
Shene, to appear cheerful, lest he should
be quite won from me by those whom he
now frequented.</P>
<P>"Though he has an excellent under∣standing,
he became insensibly intoxicated
with his good fortune, and never gave
himself time to think how soon it might
be at an end, till this fatal period actually
arrived. His patron was dismissed from
his employment, and the golden dream
vanished at once.</P>
<P>"I then knew, that out of immense
sums of money he had made, by means, of
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
which I understand nothing, he had not
reserved five hundred pounds; and I knew
that a mistress whom he had supported in
great splendour, had pillaged him of twenty
times that sum. But he was now hum∣bled
and unhappy! I forgave all his fail∣ings;
and should have blessed the chance
that had restored him to me, had we but
had a competence to live upon.</P>
<P>"After all our plate and fine furniture
in London was sold, and our debts called
in, we found ourselves about two hundred
pounds worse than nothing. But Elphin∣stone
still told me he had friends; and now
commenced a course of folicitation and
attendance, to which the humblest and
severest labour is in my mind infinitely
preferable: and in the mean time our
subsistence was derived from his writing
for the papers, and now and then by
an eighteen-penny political pamphlet.</P>
<P>"I did not notice, that in the height
of our prosperity my brother John assi∣duously
courted our regard; and Elphin∣stone
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
had procured him many advantages:
among others, that of being steward to
a nobleman, by whom he made a great
deal of money; so that he was, on our de∣cline,
more prosperous than ever. With
our failure, however, his love failed also;
and all we could now obtain of him was,
to take Frank as a sort of assistant into his
business.</P>
<P>"My poor Emily, who from gratitude
and pity I could never wholly forsake, was
at this time abroad with her friend; and I
had nothing to support me against the
heavy tide of adversity but the conscious∣ness
of having done my duty, and the firm
reliance on heaven which that conscious∣ness
gave me. Four years we lingered on,
sometimes flattered by hope of some tri∣fling
place, and sometimes supported by
small remittances from Elphinstone's mo∣ther;
while she complained heavily of the
conduct of her eldest son, who had de∣prived
her and his sisters of every thing he
could take from them.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309"/>
"Oh! never may those who have it in
their power to secure an independance,
foolishly throw it away, and trust to the fal∣lacious
assurances of that friendship which
flourishes only in the sunshine of affluence!</P>
<P>"Day after day did poor Elphinstone
now attend those men, who but a few
months ago were his assiduous friends:
many, into whose pockets he had been the
means of putting thousands, now shut their
doors against him; while, of those who could
not so easily escape from his importunity,
some blamed him for the expence at
which he had lived, talked of the ad∣vantages
of oeconomy, and of the de∣mands
of their own family—others very
gravely harangued on the caprice of for∣tune,
the ups and downs of the world,
thanked God they had but a little, but
that little was, they hoped, secure; yet
most truly lamented that it was <HI>too</HI> little to
enable them to follow the warm dictates of
their hearts, in aiding a friend they so
much respected and esteemed; and with
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
this sort of language bowed <HI>him</HI> out, whose
favour and recommendation they had only
a few months before solicited with mean∣ness
equal to their present ingratitude.</P>
<P>"Wearied at length by this sad ex∣perience
of a world to which he was still
too much attached, and where, from the
vivacity of his sanguine temper, he was
long unwilling to relinquish the hope of
rising again into consideration, he took up
once more his old projects of recovering the
money due to his father in America: and
though that country was no longer under
the government of Britain, and his ex∣pectations
of success greatly diminished,
he contrived to persuade those persons
who were interested, to furnish him with a
small supply of money; and we went, a
wandering and unhappy family, to Ame∣rica.</P>
<P>"I could give you, my dear Miss
De Mornay, a long detail of our pilgrim∣age—of
our being once fixed on a farm
in the back settlements, and exposed to
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
terrors from the Indians, which, with all
my courage, it was utterly out of my
power to support; but I have already
been too prolix, and tired you with a
long history of sorrow, from which your
sensible heart requires some relief.</P>
<P>"Alas! I cannot give it you while
I dwell on my own sad story; I will there∣fore,
as briefly as I can, conclude it,
by telling you that we were four years in
America, and two in Antigua; where my
husband joined his own family, and tried
to establish himself as a merchant. But
he was, by this time, considered as a
schemer—as an unlucky man—as one not
born to be prosperous; and this design
ended, like the rest, in disappointment.</P>
<P>"I have obtained, however, some ad∣vantages
by my itinerant life; I have
learned resignation, and have seen, that
almost every condition of humanity has
evils equal to mine, though I have some∣times
thought them insupportable. But
in acquiring patience, hope, I own, has
escaped me: nor have I now any other
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
wish, than to see my children well, and to
be able to find them bread.</P>
<P>"The distinctions of rank have long
since too been lost to me, who have passed
from competence to extreme poverty, from
extreme poverty to high affluence, and
have again fallen to all the miseries of
dependence and indigence. When Frank,
therefore, first declared to me his attach∣ment
to Jessy Woodburn, I opposed his
marriage, not from pride, but from the
apprehension of redoubling his difficulties.
I then, it is true, depended almost entirely
on the generous assistance of that excellent
brother; but, believe me, that would never
have induced me to oppose what was
requisite to his happiness. I had not
known Jessy long before I lost every idea
of opposition to it, and I wished to see
them married long before I knew what
favourable prospects might one day open
to the object of his affection. To foresee
to whom she would owe the realizing those
prospects, to whom she would afterwards
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
be the means of my being known, was,
you know, impossible."</P>
<P>"And where, my dear Madam," en∣quired
Celestina, "where was Mr. Elphin∣stone
at the time you speak of?"</P>
<P>"He was gone again to Antigua, on ac∣count
of his mother's death. I was left with
four children, and so little money, that
heaven only knows what would have
become of them and of me, had it
not been for Frank."</P>
<P>"And your sister Emily!—I cannot help
being interested for her with all her
failings."</P>
<P>"Ah! would to heaven I knew what
was now her lot! I lost all traces of her
after my going to America; nor could
mine or Frank's most assiduous enquiries
ever since, gain any intelligence. She
has changed her name, or taken some
other means to avoid us; circumstances
that make me fear she is sunk below her
former brilliant but discreditable and de∣structive
condition. When I think of
<PB N="312" REF="314"/>
her and of my children, my stoicism
forsakes me—and of her, unless I could
snatch her from a manner of life so
terrible, I endeavour not to think; for
the thoughts of what she is, and of what
she may be, I am very frequently unable
to bear. You will allow, my dear Miss De
Mornay, that my own situation requires
all my courage. A new and perhaps an
abortive project now carries me to the
remotest part of Scotland—with a heart,
I hope not callous, but exhausted by
long suffering. My husband is amiable,
good tempered, and, I believe, truly at∣tached
to me; but he is so volatile!
so unsteady! misfortune has made him
restless, and his desultory life encreased
the original blemish of his temper—a
want of firmness; from which have arisen
some of the evils that have pursued us.</P>
<P>"One of his some-time friends procured
him the little appointment he now holds,
rather to get rid of his importunity, I
think, than to do him real service. It
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
may, however, afford us a residence and a
support, and I need not say that its dis∣tance
from the scene of our former pros∣perity
and former adversity is to me its
greatest recommendation. If my husband
can learn to be content among the cold
and dreary Hebrides, if my children have
there health, food, and shelter, never shall I
be heard to repine; and indeed my journey,
in having you for my companion, begins
under auspices so favourable, that my heart,
dead to hope as it has long been, is yet not
insensible of something that nearly resem∣bles
it."</P>
<P>This conversation brought the travellers
to the end of their third day's stage; and
Celestina, more than ever interested for Mrs.
Elphinstone, forgot for a moment every
thing but the series of undeserved calami∣ties
to which she had been listening.</P>
