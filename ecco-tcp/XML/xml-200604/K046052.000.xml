<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Honour YOUR ROYAL HIGH∣NESS has done me in the Pro∣tection you was pleased to give to this Tragedy, emboldens me to lay it now at your Feet, and beg your Permission to publish it under your Royal Patro∣nage. The Favouring and Protecting of Letters has been, in all Ages and Countries, one distinguishing Mark of a great Prince; and That with good rea∣son, not only as it shews a Justness of Taste, and Elevation of Mind, but as
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
the Influence of such a Protection, by ex∣citing good Writers to labour with more Emulation in the Improvement of their several Talents, not a little contributes to the Embellishment, and Instruction of Society. But of all the different Species of Writing, none has such an Effect upon the Lives and Manners of Men, as the Dramatick; and therefore That of all others most deserves the Attention of Princes, who by a judi∣cious Approbation of such Pieces as tend to promote all Publick and Private Virtue, may more than by any coercive Methods secure the Purity of the Stage, and in conse∣quence thereof greatly advance the Morals and Politeness of their People. How eminently YOUR ROYAL HIGH∣NESS has always extended your Favour and Patronage to every Art and Science, and in a particular Manner to Drama∣tick Performances, is too well known to the World for me to mention it here. Allow me only to wish, that what I have now the Honour to offer your
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
ROYAL HIGHNESS may be judged not unworthy of your Protection, at least in the <HI>Sentiments</HI> which it inculcates. A warm and grateful Sense of your Goodness to me makes me desirous to seize every Occasion of declaring in Publick, with what profound Respect and dutiful Attachment, I am,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BOLD is the Man! who, in this nicer Age,</L>
<L>Presumes to tread the chaste corrected Stage.</L>
<L>Now, with gay tinsel Arts, we can no more</L>
<L>Conceal the Want of Nature's sterling Ore.</L>
<L>Our Spells are vanish'd, broke our magic Wand,</L>
<L>That us'd to waft you over Sea and Land.</L>
<L>Before your <HI>Light</HI> the fairy People fade,</L>
<L>The Demons fly—The Ghost itself is laid.</L>
<L>In vain of martial Scenes the loud Alarms,</L>
<L>The mighty Prompter thundering out to Arms,</L>
<L>The Playhouse Posse clattering from afar,</L>
<L>The close-wedg'd Battle, and the Din of War.</L>
<L>Now, even the Senate seldom we convene;</L>
<L>The yawning Fathers nod behind the Scene.</L>
<L>Your Taste rejects the glittering false Sublime,</L>
<L>To sigh in Metaphor, and die in Rhime.</L>
<L>High <HI>Rant</HI> is tumbled from his Gallery Throne:</L>
<L>Description, Dreams—nay Similies are gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What shall we then? to please you how devise?</L>
<L>Whose Judgment sits not in your Ears and Eyes.</L>
<L>Thrice happy! could we catch great <HI>SHAKESPEAR</HI>'s Art,</L>
<L>To trace the deep Recesses of the Heart;</L>
<L>His simple plain Sublime, to which is given</L>
<L>To strike the Soul with darted Flame from Heaven:</L>
<L>Could we awake soft <HI>OTWAY</HI>'s tender Woe,</L>
<L>The Pomp of Verse and golden Lines of <HI>ROWE.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We to your Hearts apply: let them attend;</L>
<L>Before their silent candid Bar we bend.</L>
<L>If warm'd they listen, 'tis our noblest Praise;</L>
<L>If cold, they wither all the Muse's Bays.</L>

<L>The Death of those distinguish'd by their Station,</L>
<L>But by their Virtue more, awakes the Mind</L>
<L>To solemn Dread, and strikes a saddening Awe:</L>
<L>Not that we grieve for them, but for ourselves,</L>
<L>Left to the Toil of Life—And yet the Best</L>
<L>Are, by the playful Children of this World,</L>
<L>At once forgot, as they had never been.</L>
</LG>

<L>LAURA, 'tis said—the Heart is sometimes charg'd</L>
<L>With a prophetick Sadness: Such, methinks,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
Now hangs on mine. The King's approaching Death</L>
<L>Suggests a thousand Fears. What Troubles thence</L>
<L>May throw the State once more into Confusion,</L>

<L>May rise, and part me from my dearest TANCRED,</L>
<L>Alarms my Thought.</L>

<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Fears of Love-sick Fancy!</L>
<L>Perversely busy to torment it self.</L>
<L>But be assur'd, your Father's steady Friendship,</L>
<L>Join'd to a certain Genius, that commands,</L>
<L>Not kneels to Fortune will support and cherish,</L>
<L>Here in the publick Eye of <HI>Sicily,</HI></L>
<L>This—I may call him—his adopted Son,</L>
<L>The noble TANCRED, form'd to all his Virtues.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIGISMUNDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah form'd to charm his Daughter!—This fair Morn</L>
<L>Has tempted far the Chace. Is he not yet</L>
<L>Return'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No.—When your Father to the King,</L>
<L>Who now expiring lies, was call'd in haste,</L>
<L>He sent each way his Messengers to find him;</L>
<L>With such a Look of Ardor and Impatience,</L>
<L>As if this near Event was to Count TANCRED</L>
<L>Of more Importance than I comprehend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIGISMUNDA.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>There lies, my LAURA, o'er my TANCRED'S Birth</L>
<L>A Cloud I cannot pierce. With princely Cost,</L>
<L>Nay, with Respect, which oft I have observ'd,</L>
<L>Stealing at times submissive o'er his Features,</L>
<L>In <HI>Belmont's</HI> Woods my Father rear'd this Youth—</L>
<L>Ah Woods! where first my artless Bosom learnt</L>
<L>The Sighs of Love.—He gives him out the Son</L>
<L>Of an old Friend, a Baron of <HI>Apulia,</HI></L>
<L>Who in the late Crusado b avely fell.</L>
<L>But then 'tis strange; is all his Family</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
As well as Father dead? and all their Friends,</L>
<L>Except my Sire, the generous good SIFFREDI?</L>
<L>Had he a Mother, Sister, Brother left,</L>
<L>The last Remain of Kindred, with what Pride,</L>
<L>What Rapture, might they fly o'er Earth and Sea,</L>
<L>To claim this rising Honour of their Blood!</L>
<L>This bright Unknown! this all-accomplish'd Youth!</L>
<L>Who charms—too much—the Heart of SIGIS∣MUNDA!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LAURA, perhaps your Brother knows him better,</L>
<L>The Friend and Partner of his freest Hours.</L>
<L>What says RODOLPHO? Does he truely credit</L>
<L>This Story of his Birth?</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>He has sometimes,</L>
<L>Like you, his Doubts; yet, when maturely weigh'd,</L>
<L>Believes it true. As for Lord TANCRED'S Self,</L>
<L>He never entertain'd the slightest Thought</L>
<L>That verg'd to Doubt; but oft laments his State,</L>
<L>By cruel Fortune so ill-pair'd to yours.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIGISMUNDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Merit like his, the Fortune of the Mind,</L>
<L>Beggars all Wealth—Then to your Brother, LAURA,</L>
<L>He talks of me?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of nothing else. Howe'er</L>
<L>The Talk begin, it ends with SIGISMUNDA.</L>
<L>Their Morning, Noon-tide, and their Evening Walks</L>
<L>Are full of you; and all the Woods of <HI>Belmont</HI></L>
<L>Inamour'd with your Name—</L>

<SPEAKER>SIGISMUNDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Away, my Friend;</L>
<L>You flatter—yet the dear Delusion charms.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, SIGISMUNDA, 'tis the strictest Truth,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
Nor half the Truth, I tell you. Even with Fond∣ness</L>
<L>My Brother talks for ever of the Passion,</L>
<L>That fires young TANCRED'S Breast. So much it strikes him,</L>
<L>He praises Love as if he were a Lover.</L>
<L>He blames the false Pursuits of vagrant Youth,</L>
<L>Calls them gay Folly, a mistaken Struggle</L>
<L>Against best-judging Nature. Heaven, he says,</L>
<L>In lavish Bounty form'd the Heart for Love;</L>
<L>In Love included all the finer Seeds</L>
<L>Of Honour, Virtue, Friendship, purest Bliss—</L>

<L>Then his pleasing Theme</L>
<L>He varies to the Praises of your Lover—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIGISMUNDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what, my LAURA, says he on that Subject?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LAURA.</SPEAKER>
<L>He says that, tho' he were not nobly born,</L>
<L>Nature has form'd him noble, generous, brave,</L>
<L>Truely magnanimous, and warmly scorning</L>
<L>Whatever bears the smallest Taint of Baseness:</L>
<L>That every easy Virtue is his own;</L>
<L>Not learnt by painful Labour, but inspir'd,</L>
<L>Implanted in his Soul—Chiefly one Charm</L>
<L>He in his graceful Character observes:</L>
<L>That tho' his Passions burn with high Impatience,</L>
<L>And sometimes, from a noble Heat of Nature,</L>
<L>Are ready to fly off, yet the least Check</L>
<L>Of ruling Reason brings them back to Temper,</L>
<L>And gentle Softness.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIGISMUNDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>True! O true, RODOLPHO!</L>
<L>Blest be thy kindred Worth for loving his!</L>
<L>He is all Warmth, all amiable Fire,</L>
<L>All quick Heroic Ardor! temper'd soft</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
With Gentleness of Heart, and manly Reason!</L>
<L>If Virtue were to wear a human Form,</L>
<L>To light it with her Dignity and Flame,</L>
<L>Then softening mix her Smiles and tender Graces,</L>
<L>O she would chuse the Person of my TANCRED!</L>
<L>Go on, my Friend, go on, and ever praise him;</L>
<L>The Subject knows no Bounds, nor can I tire,</L>
<L>While my Breast trembles to that sweetest Musick!</L>
<L>The Heart of Woman tastes no truer Joy,</L>
<L>Is never flatter'd with such dear Enchantment—</L>
<L>'Tis more than selfish Vanity—as when</L>
<L>She hears the Praises of the Man she loves—</L>

<L>'Tis true. But at his Years</L>
<L>Death gives short Notice—Dropping Nature then,</L>

<L>His Death, my Daughter, was that happy Period</L>
<L>Which few attain. The Duties of his Day</L>
<L>Were all discharg'd, and gratefully enjoy'd</L>

<L>Was his pure Mind, and lighted up with Hopes</L>

<L>Tho' dead, the Tyrant still is to be fear'd;</L>
<L>His Daughter's Party still is strong, and numerous:</L>
<L>Her Friend, Earl OSMOND, Constable of <HI>Sicily,</HI></L>

<L>But wherefore fear? The Right is clearly his;</L>
<L>And, under your Direction, with each Man</L>
<L>Of Worth, and stedfast Loyalty, to back</L>
<L>At once the King's Appointment and his Birthright,</L>
<L>There is no ground for Fear. They have great Odds,</L>

<L>Pardon my Warmth—but That, my Lord, will never</L>

<L>Lose not a Moment to awaken in him</L>
<L>The Royal Soul. Perhaps he now desponding</L>

<L>Where dwell the tender, oft unhappy Loves;</L>
<L>Where Shades of Heroes roam, each mighty Name,</L>
<L>And court my Aid to rise again to Fame;</L>
<L>To you I come, to Freedom's noblest Seat,</L>
<L>And in <HI>BRITANNIA</HI> fix my last Retreat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>GREECE,</HI> and <HI>ROME,</HI> I watch'd the Publick Weal;</L>
<L>The purple Tyrant trembled at my Steel:</L>
<L>Nor did I less o'er private Sorrows reign,</L>
<L>And mend the melting Heart with softer Pain.</L>
<L>On <HI>FRANCE</HI> and <HI>YOU</HI> then rose my brightning Star,</L>
<L>With social Ray—The <HI>ARTS</HI> are ne'er at War.</L>
<L>O as your Fire and Genius stronger blaze,</L>
<L>As yours are generous Freedom's bolder Lays,</L>
<L>Let not the <HI>Gallick</HI> Taste leave yours behind,</L>
<L>In decent Manners and in Life refin'd;</L>
<L>Banish the motley Mode, to tag low Verse,</L>
<L>The laughing Ballad to the mournful Herse.</L>
<L>When thro' five Acts your Hearts have learnt to glow,</L>
<L>Touch'd with the sacred Force of honest Woe;</L>
<L>O keep the dear Impression on your Breast,</L>
<L>Nor idly lose it for a wretched Jest!</L>
