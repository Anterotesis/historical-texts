<HEAD>THE
SICK MONKEY,
A
FABLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADDRESSED
To Mr. GARRICK, upon his ARRIVAL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>RETURN'D from travel to your native shore</L>
<L>Again to make us laugh or cry,</L>
<L>To turn your back, we hope, no more,</L>
<L>Nor from your colours fly;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether you fled for health, or quiet,</L>
<L>Harrass'd with rule, or sick of riot,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Or whether you have kept us lean,</L>
<L>As slander says,</L>
<L>With lenten plays,</L>
<L>To make our appetites more keen;</L>
<L>Whether it be or this or that,</L>
<L>No matter what,</L>
<L>For we before the curtain see but blindly;</L>
<L>Now you are come,</L>
<L>To us, and home,</L>
<L>We greet you, Sir, and greet you kindly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Muse is honest, as she's bold,</L>
<L>A forward Miss,</L>
<L>Who loves to prate—but hold—</L>
<L>I quite forgot;</L>
<L>Before I tell you what she <HI>is,</HI></L>
<L>I'll tell you what she's <HI>not.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
No bird of prey, with wild uproar,</L>
<L>Like CHURCHILL, to disturb the grove;</L>
<L>Nor comes she, like the harmless dove,</L>
<L>To bill, and coo, and love,</L>
<L>—And nothing more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short, to speak more plainly,</L>
<L>Nor be it thought I speak it vainly,</L>
<L>Averse to flattery and spite,</L>
<L>She is a modest, sober dame,</L>
<L>I wish all females were the same,</L>
<L>And will not scratch or bite:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She is not one of those</L>
<L>Who shew their genius in their dress,</L>
<L>Whose inky fingers, unpinn'd cloaths,</L>
<L>The slip-shod shoe, and snuffy nose,</L>
<L>Denote her wit, and sluttishness:</L>
<L>Who with a Play, like pistol cock'd, in hand,</L>
<L>Bid Managers to stand:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
" Deliver, Sir,</L>
<L>" Your thoughts on this</L>
<L>" Before you stir—</L>
<L>" —<HI>But, Madam—Miss</HI>—</L>
<L>" Your answer strait;</L>
<L>" I will not wait—</L>
<L>" —<HI>'Tis fit you know</HI>—</L>
<L>" I'll hear no reason,</L>
<L>" This very season,</L>
<L>" AY or NO."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not to kill more precious time,</L>
<L>In dropping sense to pick up rhime;</L>
<L>Or, like friend SHANDY, rattle,</L>
<L>And lose my matter in my prattle;</L>
<L>Without much wit digression's tame,</L>
<L>So I shall give it o'er,</L>
<L>And beat about the bush no more,</L>
<L>But start my game.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
The Critick's pen has various uses,</L>
<L>It praises now, and now abuses,</L>
<L>Does this and that,</L>
<L>Or both together,</L>
<L>As fancy strikes or rhimes come pat,</L>
<L>Stabs with the point, or tickles with the feather.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Authors, like bees, buz round, and round</L>
<L>Dramatic ground;</L>
<L>For all they meet</L>
<L>Have sharp and sweet;</L>
<L>They do no ill,</L>
<L>Would fools sit still;</L>
<L>Provoke 'em, and they're dangerous things;</L>
<L>And ev'ry Player</L>
<L>Should equally beware</L>
<L>Their honey as their stings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GARRICK! thou mighty chief of kings and queens,</L>
<L>Despotic tyrant of the scenes!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Think'st thou all human race to mock,</L>
<L>In buskin, and in sock,</L>
<L>And will not fools</L>
<L>Thy mock'ry ridicules,</L>
<L>From CHALKSTONE's Lord, to dainty FRIBBLE,</L>
<L>Rave, chatter, write,</L>
<L>In various ways display their spite?</L>
<L>For all can talk, and some can scribble.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Others again</L>
<L>Take up the pen,</L>
<L>In panegyrick's gaudy colours paint thee;</L>
<L>As humour flows,</L>
<L>Now friends, now foes,</L>
<L>In prose and verse, and verse and prose,</L>
<L>Bedevil thee, and saint thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And can such Criticks teaze thee?</L>
<L>And can such praises please thee?</L>
<L>O, if they can,</L>
<L>Alas! poor man,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
No more deride</L>
<L>Thy neighbour's weakness, folly, pride,</L>
<L>But cure thy own,</L>
<L>If thou art able,</L>
<L>While I make known</L>
<L>My friendship to thee, in a Fable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An APE there was, an APE of merit,</L>
<L>A lively, sportive, pleasant thing,</L>
<L>Had so much fancy, whim, and spirit,</L>
<L>And made such sport,</L>
<L>He got to Court,</L>
<L>And shew'd his tricks before the LION-KING.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such honour gave him fame,</L>
<L>And rais'd his name;</L>
<L>From far and near they came to see</L>
<L>This MONKEY-prodigy!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Though none were more expert and quick,</L>
<L>In tumbling backward o'er a stick;</L>
<L>Though none with a more lordly pride,</L>
<L>And happy ease, did e'er bestride</L>
<L><HI>The rugged, Russian bear</HI>;</L>
<L>Though he could skip it up and down,</L>
<L>And pick the pocket of a clown,</L>
<L>Or whip away his hat,</L>
<L>Or fondle with a cat,</L>
<L>The wonder of the Fair!</L>
<L>This was not all—he had the art</L>
<L>Of acting still a higher part:</L>
<L>To each profession that he saw,</L>
<L>Physick, Divinity, or Law,</L>
<L>He ludicrously shap'd him:</L>
<L>So much possess'd of all their notions,</L>
<L>Their humours, oddities, and motions,</L>
<L>That not a soul escap'd him.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
In ridicule's enchanted glass,</L>
<L>Whatever forms are shewn,</L>
<L>We all can see another's face,</L>
<L>But never find our own.</L>
<L>To flatter SELF we all incline,</L>
<L>For SELF we plan and labour;</L>
<L>" Pluck not, good Sir, a hair of mine,</L>
<L>" And you may scalp my neighbour."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each laugh'd to see his friend the jest,</L>
<L>And prais'd the MONKEY highly,</L>
<L>Not openly, but slily,</L>
<L>At court you find a thousand such:</L>
<L>But what was best,</L>
<L>Though there were none</L>
<L>By turns he did not fall upon,</L>
<L>Each thought himself the only one</L>
<L>The MIMIC could not touch:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Blest fools! who boast your happy lot</L>
<L>From ridicule secure,</L>
<L>Though leopard-stain'd, you see no spot,</L>
<L>INIMITABLY pure!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whether the JACKANAPES was clever,</L>
<L>Or the Court not over nice,</L>
<L>By various tricks he crept in favour,</L>
<L>And for those tricks had DOUBLE PRICE!</L>
<L>Thus FORTUNE, in a whim,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to turn his brain,</L>
<L>And fill'd his cup up to the brim,</L>
<L>Th'intoxicating cup of joy,</L>
<L>Which better heads than his destroy,</L>
<L>No wonder he was vain!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whenever gossip FAME prates loud,</L>
<L>ENVY, in turn, as loud will tattle,</L>
<L>And scribblers to her standard croud,</L>
<L>Cry, HAVOCK! and prepare for battle.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
MALEVOLENCE, with lynx's eye,</L>
<L>The most minute defects will spy;</L>
<L>And even FRIENDSHIP, shame upon our kind!</L>
<L>Is to those faults not always blind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The looking up fatigues the sight,</L>
<L>And mortals when they soar,</L>
<L>Should they once reach a certain height,</L>
<L>All wish to have them lower:</L>
<L>And friends there are in this good town</L>
<L>Will lend a hand to help them down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>About, about my pen,</L>
<L>Nor lose the Fable in thy railing!</L>
<L>But to our MONKEY back again,</L>
<L>Who found that Brutes, as well as Men,</L>
<L>Have this same cursed failing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The moment he got fame and wealth</L>
<L>(How ill exchang'd for ease and health!)</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
The envious crew</L>
<L>Poor PUG pursue,</L>
<L>Abuse his active, pliant spirit;</L>
<L>But chiefly those</L>
<L>Were mark'd his foes,</L>
<L>Who felt a satire in his merit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dull and sluggish were the first</L>
<L>To shew their teeth, if not to bite;</L>
<L>The HOG, the BEAR, the ASS, had burst,</L>
<L>Had they not grunted, roar'd, and bray'd their spite.</L>
<L>This furious stir,</L>
<L>Awak'd the Critic CUR;</L>
<L>HOUND, GREYHOUND, MASTIFF, answer to the call,</L>
<L>THE LITTLE DOGS AND ALL.</L>
<L>The game's in view:</L>
<L>For man and beast</L>
<L>Scandal's a feast,</L>
<L>Where both with appetite fall to.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
The bloated TOAD, in silence, stole</L>
<L>To gather poison in her hole:</L>
<L>As mischief never knows delay,</L>
<L>She rouz'd the VIPER in her way;</L>
<L>A neighbour, and her bosom friend:</L>
<L>For though she crawl'd and could not run,</L>
<L>She kept this maxim strictly,</L>
<L>(Ye sons of Law, attend!)</L>
<L>That mischief, if it must be done,</L>
<L><HI>'Twere well it were done quickly.</HI></L>
<L>But then his <HI>friends</HI>—Did they oppose?</L>
<L>(A luke-warm friend's the worst of foes)</L>
<L>The GOAT look'd wise, and wagg'd his beard;</L>
<L>The SPANIEL shook his ears;</L>
<L>The Fox turn'd up his pointed nose;</L>
<L>Thoughtful and dull the CAT appear'd,</L>
<L>Or else in whispers purr'd her fears:</L>
<L>The STEED alone was firm and fast,</L>
<L>The generous STEED stood by him to the last.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
PUG sickens, mopes, and looks like death,</L>
<L>Speaks faintly, and scarce draws his breath;</L>
<L>Some call it Megrim, some the Spleen;</L>
<L>Words often us'd that little mean:</L>
<L>But Scandal, with her face demure,</L>
<L>Hints it is heat of blood,</L>
<L>By which is understood,</L>
<L><HI>An old Amour:</HI></L>
<L>In short, they ransack all diseases,</L>
<L>And give him that their fancy pleases.</L>
<L>Among the rest,</L>
<L>That fits him best,</L>
<L>Which best the Doctor serves:</L>
<L>Of which he most avails him,</L>
<L>When knowledge fails him,</L>
<L>And, with a face of wisdom, calls it—NERVES.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The HORSE, who saw his friend's distress,</L>
<L>Did thus his honest mind express:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
" Come, prithee, rouze; this life's the devil;</L>
<L>" What sigh and sob, and keep within?</L>
<L>" What YOU, who us'd to frisk and revel,</L>
<L>" For ever chatter, and for ever grin?</L>
<L>" Zounds—it would make a parson swear;—</L>
<L>" Get on my back, and take the air."—</L>
<L>Away they went, and as they pass,</L>
<L>The HOG, the DOG, the BEAR, the ASS,</L>
<L>PUG's diff'rent foes in diff'rent places;</L>
<L>If in the least they shew'd their spite,</L>
<L>The HORSE would winny, snort, and bite,</L>
<L>And throw <HI>the dirt</HI> into their faces.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For all this care,</L>
<L>This exercise and air,</L>
<L>Yet still the MONKEY pin'd,</L>
<L>For well we are assured,</L>
<L>That when the grief is in the mind,</L>
<L>'Tis sooner got than cur'd</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
In this condition,</L>
<L>What to prescribe him?—a Physician.</L>
<L>There is a certain way of life,</L>
<L>Which all must take,</L>
<L>For fashion's sake,</L>
<L>Or be with all the world at strife:</L>
<L>The rich must to the Doctor give,</L>
<L>The poor to Nature trust, and live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It must be so;—or could the tribe</L>
<L>Of those who quack, or who prescribe,</L>
<L>In folly find such ample gain?</L>
<L>Could nostrums swell the <HI>Advertiser?</HI></L>
<L>Or the wise heads of <HI>Warwick-lane</HI></L>
<L>Buy Wig enough to make them wiser?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our patient cannot wait;</L>
<L>" Send for a doctor strait!"</L>
<L>But not a formal, half-bred fool,</L>
<L>Who cures by chance, and kills by rule,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
A perriwig-pated block:</L>
<L>Physicians for the Brutes were Fowls,</L>
<L>And though the sworn practitioners were OWLS,</L>
<L>They chose a neighbouring COCK.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He enters with a stately tread,</L>
<L>His comb and wattles dignify his head:</L>
<L>No outward fign was ever seen,</L>
<L>That promis'd half so much within;</L>
<L>And yet—ye sons of Physick, blush!</L>
<L>The wine was better than the bush.</L>
<L>His learning back'd by penetration,</L>
<L>A kind of Radcliffe-inspiration,</L>
<L>Bound by no partial, pedant laws,</L>
<L>Shot through each symptom to its cause:</L>
<L>A rarity without dispute!</L>
<L>He was <HI>an honest</HI> COCK to boot.</L>
<L>Yet with this genius, worth, and knowledge,</L>
<L>He had a stain, a deep disgrace,</L>
<L>No mortal merit could efface,—</L>
<L>—He was not of the College!</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
But hold—our hero out of sight,</L>
<L>Must now again be brought to light:</L>
<L>We left him in the Doctor's care,</L>
<L>Who with a serious face,</L>
<L>Attending to the case,</L>
<L>Did thus his mind declare:</L>
<L>" I could, like any learned brother,</L>
<L>" With a hard name my ign'rance smother:</L>
<L>" 'Tis one of our establish'd laws,</L>
<L>" Which daily we fulfil,</L>
<L>" Whene'er our skill can't find a cause,</L>
<L>" To make a cause to suit our skill:</L>
<L>" Thus we seldom meet disgrace;</L>
<L>" We only can mistake the case.</L>
<L>" What are these papers by your side?</L>
<L>" <HI>'Tis physick, Sir, to cure my pride:</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>This heap of papers, verse and prose,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>Is the joint malice of my foes;</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>There's not a day but something's sent me,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>To fret me, and torment me.</HI>"</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
This said, the conversation stops:</L>
<L>For PUG was faint, and calls for drops;</L>
<L>With rage subdu'd, the patient panted,</L>
<L>Which struck a light the Doctor wanted,</L>
<L>Who thus pronounc'd—"I know your ail:</L>
<L>" 'Tis not in your heart or head,</L>
<L>" As some have said;</L>
<L>" <HI>Where then, good Doctor?</HI>—in your <HI>tail.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Tail of most uncommon make,</L>
<L>In action like the serpent kind,</L>
<L>A thousand diff'rent forms could take,</L>
<L>Twirl, twist, and vary to his mind.</L>
<L>If Lords were ap'd—this pliant queue</L>
<L>Was cross his breast a ribbon blue,</L>
<L>Or green, or red—and then slap-dash,</L>
<L>A Chaplain's scarf, or Col'nel's sash:</L>
<L>When e'er the city struck his brain,</L>
<L>'Twas round his neck a Lord Mayor's chain:</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Or were his part to lisp and trip it,</L>
<L>Hey, prefto!—'twas a Lady's tippet!</L>
<L>But now depriv'd of spirit, life, and strength,</L>
<L>It lies a languid, lank, inanimated length.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Doctor paus'd—then silence broke,</L>
<L>" I'll strike a master stroke!</L>
<L>" This Tail of yours we must amend,</L>
<L>" Give it new life and force,</L>
<L>" And if we gain that end,</L>
<L>" The rest will come of course:</L>
<L>" With that same malice of your foes,</L>
<L>" Both verse and prose,</L>
<L>" Curl it each night and morning;</L>
<L>" But then take warning—</L>
<L>" Never again to cast your eyes</L>
<L>" On what is wrote, or may be writ,</L>
<L>" Whether it is, or is not wit;</L>
<L>" For <HI>there</HI> the magic lies."</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
'Tis best by craft, and not by book,</L>
<L>To cure these mental fevers;—</L>
<L>The MONKEY all for gospel took,</L>
<L>The sick are great believers.</L>
<L>So well the Doctor's words he noted,</L>
<L>His tail that night was <HI>papilloted</HI>;</L>
<L>His greedy eyes, to cure his head,</L>
<L>No more on paper-diet fed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The cause remov'd effects will cease,</L>
<L>Depriv'd of oil, the flame goes out,</L>
<L>Our APE began to be at peace,</L>
<L>His Tail to move about:</L>
<L>The more 'twas curl'd,</L>
<L>The more it twirl'd;</L>
<L>With head and heart</L>
<L>The Tail took part,</L>
<L>Life frisks in ev'ry vein,</L>
<L>—PUG <HI>was himself again!</HI>—</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
The MONKEY got his health,</L>
<L>The Doctor wealth,</L>
<L>Of patients he had plenty:</L>
<L>For though the cure was half a joke,</L>
<L>'Twas wonder'd at by silly folk,</L>
<L>And that's nineteen in twenty.</L>
<L>To fix his cure, Historians say,</L>
<L>That, like Sir WILFULL in the play,</L>
<L>He talk'd of foreign parts:</L>
<L>Left all his griefs and cares behind,</L>
<L>Sail'd with the first fair wind,</L>
<L>And hey for ITALY, and Arts!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What he got there no creature knows,</L>
<L>Nor he himself can tell us;</L>
<L>What lightly comes as lightly goes,</L>
<L>With all such pretty fellows.</L>
<L>He skip'd the country o'er,</L>
<L>And then return'd,</L>
<L>With what he learn'd,</L>
<L>A greater MONKEY than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
<L>THE Fable told, the Moral comes;—</L>
<L>GARRICK, don't fret, and bite your thumbs,</L>
<L>But take the MONKEY's place;</L>
<L>The same's your case,</L>
<L>The same prescription we advise:</L>
<L>Should Spleen and Spite,</L>
<L>Nay, though Critic Truth should write,</L>
<L>(For who is always in the right?)</L>
<L>Shut your ears, and close your eyes:</L>
<L>Whate'er is publish'd, buy the heap,</L>
<L>You'll have it cheap,</L>
<L>But not to read, or hear it read:</L>
<L>Would you strike detraction dead,</L>
<L>The Doctor's method cannot fail;</L>
<L>Keep the poison from your HEAD,</L>
<L>And clap it to your TAIL.</L>
