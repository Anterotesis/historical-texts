<HEAD>A
CONVERSATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN February, 1767, there happened one of the most remarkable incidents
of Johnson's life, which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm, and which he
loved to relate with all its circumstances, when requested by his friends. This
was his being honoured by a private conversation with his Majesty, in the
library at the Queen's house. He had frequently visited those splendid rooms
and noble collection of books<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Johnson had the honour of contributing his assistance towards the formation of this library; for I have read a long letter from him to Mr. Barnard, giving the most masterly instructions on the subject. I wished much to have gratified my readers with the perusal of this letter, and have rea∣son to think that his Majesty would have been graciously pleased to permit its publication; but Mr. Barnard, to whom I applied, declined it "on his own account."</NOTE>, which he used to say was more numerous and
curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the
King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he should
have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience,
while indulging his literary taste in that place; so that he had here a very
agreeable resource at leisure hours.</P>
<P>His Majesty having been informed of his occasional visits, was pleased to
signify a desire that he should be told when Dr. Johnson came next to the
library. Accordingly, the next time that Johnson did come, as soon as he
was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he sat by the fire, he seemed
quite intent, Mr. Barnard stole round to the apartment where the King was,
and, in obedience to his Majesty's commands, mentioned that Dr. Johnson was
then in the library. His Majesty said he was at leisure, and would go to him;
upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that stood on the King's table,
and lighted his Majesty through a suite of rooms, till they came to a private
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
door into the library, of which his Majesty had the key. Being entered, Mr.
Barnard stepped forward hastily to Dr. Johnson, who was still in a profound
study, and whispered him, "Sir, here is the King." Johnson started up, and stood
still. His Majesty approached him, and at once was courteously easy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The particulars of this conversation I have been at great pains to collect with the utmost authenticity, from Dr. Johnson's own detail to myself; from Mr. Langton, who was present when he gave an account of it to Dr. Joseph Warton, and several other friends, at Sir Joshua Reynolds's; from Mr. Barnard; from the copy of a letter written by the late Mr. Strahan the printer, to Bishop Warburton; and from a minute, the original of which is among the papers of the late Sir James Caldwell, and a copy of which was most obligingly obtained for me from his son Sir John Caldwell, by Sir Francis Lumm. To all these gentlemen I beg leave to make my grateful acknowledgements, and particularly to Sir Francis Lumm, who was pleased to take a great deal of trouble, and even had the minute laid before the King by Lord Caermarthen, now Duke of Leeds, one of his Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, who announced to Sir Francis the Royal pleasure concerning it by a letter, in these words: "I have the King's commands to assure you, Sir, how sensible his Majesty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the conversation previous to its publication. As there appears no objection to your complying with Mr. Boswell's wishes on the subject, you are at full liberty to deliver it to that gentleman, to make such use of in his Life of Dr. Johnson, as he may think proper."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His Majesty began by observing, that he understood he came sometimes to
the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been
lately at Oxford, asked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which
Johnson answered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford sometimes,
but was likewise glad to come back again. The King then asked him what
they were doing at Oxford. Johnson answered, he could not much commend
their diligence, but that in some respects they were mended, for they had put
their press under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius.
He was then asked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge.
He answered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam∣bridge;
at the same time adding, "I hope, whether we have more books or
not than they have at Cambridge, we shall make as good use of them as they
do." Being asked whether All-Souls or Christ-Church library was the largest,
he answered, "All-Souls library is the largest we have, except the Bodleian."
"Aye, (said the King,) that is the publick library."</P>
<P>His Majesty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He answered,
he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and must
now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it should seem with a
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
view to urge him to rely on his own stores as an original writer, and to continue
his labours, then said, "I do not think you borrow much from any body."
Johnson said, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. "I should
have thought so too, (said the King,) if you had not written so well."—
Johnson observed to me, upon this, that "No man could have paid a hand∣somer
compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was decisive." When
asked by another friend, at Sir Joshua Reynolds's, whether he made any reply
to this high compliment, he answered, "No, Sir. When the King had said
it, it was to be so. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign."
Perhaps no man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shewn a
more nice and dignified sense of true politeness, than Johnson did in this instance.</P>
<P>His Majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read a
great deal; Johnson answered, that he thought more than he read; that he
had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill
health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for
instance, he said he had not read much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon
which the King said, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of such general
knowledge, that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he
was not qualified to speak; and that his learning resembled Garrick's acting,
in its universality. His Majesty then talked of the controversy between
Warburton and Lowth, which he seemed to have read, and asked Johnson
what he thought of it. Johnson answered, "Warburton has most general,
most scholastick learning; Lowth is the more correct scholar. I do not know
which of them calls names best." The King was pleased to say he was of
the same opinion; adding, "You do not think then, Dr. Johnson, that there
was much argument in the case." Johnson said, he did not think there was.
"Why truly, (said the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argu∣ment
is pretty well at an end."</P>
<P>His Majesty then asked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton's history,
which was then just published. Johnson said, he thought his style pretty good,
but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. "Why, (said
the King,) they seldom do these things by halves." "No, Sir, (answered
Johnson,) not to Kings." But fearing to be misunderstood, he proceeded to
explain himself; and immediately subjoined, "That for those who spoke
worse of Kings than they deserved, he could find no excuse, but that he could
more easily conceive how some might speak better of them than they deserved,
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give,
those who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exagge∣rate
their praises; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly
excuseable, as far as errour could be excuseable."</P>
<P>The King then asked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. Johnson answered,
that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately
mentioned, as an instance of it, an assertion of that writer, that he had
seen objects magnified to a much greater degree by using three or four micro∣scopes
at a time, than by using one. "Now, (added Johnson,) every one
acquainted with microscopes knows, that the more of them he looks through,
the less the object will appear." "Why, (replied the King,) this is not only
telling an untruth, but telling it clumsily; for, if that be the case, every one
who can look through a microscope will be able to detect him."</P>
<P>"I now, (said Johnson to his friends, when relating what had passed,)
began to consider that I was depreciating this man in the estimation of his
sovereign, and thought it was time for me to say something that might be
more favourable." He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwithstanding,
a very curious observer; and if he would have been contented to tell the
world no more than he knew, he might have been a very considerable man,
and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his
reputation.</P>
<P>The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the
<HI>Journal des Savans,</HI> and asked Johnson if it was well done. Johnson said,
it was formerly very well done, and gave some account of the persons who
began it, and carried it on for some years; enlarging at the same time, on the
nature and use of such works. The King asked him if it was well done now.
Johnson answered, he had no reason to think that it was. The King then
asked him if there were any other literary journals published in this kingdom,
except the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and on being answered there were
no other, his Majesty asked which of them was the best: Johnson answered,
that the Monthly Review was done with most care, the Critical upon the best
principles; adding, that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies
to the Church. This the King said he was sorry to hear.</P>
<P>The conversation next turned on the Philosophical Transactions, when
Johnson observed, that they had now a better method of arranging their
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
materials than formerly. "Aye, (said the King,) they are obliged to Dr.
Johnson for that;" for his Majesty had heard and remembered the circum∣stance,
which Johnson himself had forgot.</P>
<P>His Majesty expressed a desire to have the literary biography of this country
ably executed, and proposed to Dr. Johnson to undertake it. Johnson signified
his readiness to comply with his Majesty's wishes.</P>
<P>During the whole of this interview, Johnson talked to his Majesty with
profound respect, but still in his firm manly manner, with a sonorous voice,
and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in
the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnson shewed himself highly
pleased with his Majesty's conversation and gracious behaviour. He said to
Mr. Barnard, "Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the
finest gentleman I have ever seen." And he afterwards observed to Mr.
Langton, "Sir, his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may
suppose Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second."</P>
<P>At Sir Joshua Reynolds's, where a circle of Johnson's friends was collected
round him to hear his account of this memorable conversation, Dr. Joseph
Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in pressing him to
mention the particulars. "Come now, Sir, this is an interesting matter; do
favour us with it." Johnson, with great good humour, complied.</P>
<P>He told them, "I found his Majesty wished I should talk, and I made
it my business to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his
sovereign. In the first place, a man cannot be in a passion—" Here some
question interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would
have pointed out and illustrated many circumstances of advantage, from being in
a situation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous
exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</P>
<P>During all the time in which Dr. Johnson was employed in relating to the
circle at Sir Joshua Reynolds's the particulars of what passed between the
King and him, Dr. Goldsmith remained unmoved upon a sopha at some
distance, affecting not to join in the least in the eager curiosity of the com∣pany.
He assigned as a reason for his gloom and seeming inattention, that he
apprehended Johnson had relinquished his purpose of furnishing him with a
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it
was strongly suspected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the
singular honour Dr. Johnson had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankness
and simplicity of his natural character prevailed. He sprung from the sopha,
advanced to Johnson, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining himself in the
situation which he had just been hearing described, exclaimed, "Well, you
acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have done; for I
should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it."</P>
